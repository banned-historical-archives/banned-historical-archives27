 RESTRUCTURING ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS IS A REVOLUTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 2-5
 [Article by Editorial Department]
 [Text] The party Central Committee has grasped restructuring administrative
 organizations as its number one task since the beginning of this year.  At
 present, this task is being carried out first by the central party and
 government organizations and will then be carried out level by level in a
 planned way throughout the country.  The vast numbers of cadres and the
 broad masses of the people are inspired and they enthusiastically support
 the current restructuring.   There is no doubt that the party Central Com-
 mittee's important policy decision on restructuring administrative organiza-
 tions enjoys immense support from the whole party, the whole army and the
 people of the whole country.
 Why do we now have to restructure administrative organizations?  With the
 promotion of our socialist modernization programs, the situation in which
 our country's production relations and certain aspects of the superstructure
 are not suited to the development of productive forces is becoming increas-
 ingly serious and conspicuous.  For example, the intolerably serious bureau-.
 cratic tendencies and low efficiency have resulted from overlapping and
 overstaffed administrations with their multitiered departments crammed full
 of superfluous personnel who are in posts with no clearly defined duties and
 who are engaged in endless haggling and shifting of responsibility.  These
 have actually become serious obstacles to the promotion of our moderniza-
 tion programs.   If we are not determined to go in for restructuring, it will
 be hard to keep up no matter how correct the party's line, guiding principles
 and policies are and no matter how fruitful our work has been.  We cannot
 just sit here and unfeelingly watch our party and government organizations
 becoming devoid of vigor and efficiency.  Being devoid of vigor and effi-
 cience obstructs the full implementation of the party's correct line, guid-
 ing principles and policies and stops us from scoring greater achievements
 in our work.  Of course, our whole party must not remain different toward
 this state of affairs; otherwise, as executors of the people's instructions,
 can we still have a clear conscience?
 Let us look back on the historical events of the past 5 years.   Since October
 1976 our party has fulfilled three very important tasks of profound historic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 significance.  The first very important task was the smashing of the counter-
 revolutionary clique of Jiang Qing.  This smashing extricated the party from
 calamity and saved the revolution.  The second very important task was the
 convocation of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.
 This convocation revived the party's ideological line of seeking truth from
 facts, began bringing order out of chaos in an all-round way and determined
 the shift of the focus of the party's work.  The third very important task
 was the convocation of the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Com-
 mittee, which approved the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History
 of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC," summed up both positive and
 negative experiences, correctly evaluated the historical role played by
 Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought in the Chinese revolution and
 pointed out the orientation for the continued advance of our country's
 socialist cause and the work of our party.  At the same time, this plenary
 session also readjusted the leading group of the CCP Central Committee,
 thus enabling the party Central Committee to have a very strong and united
 leadership core.  The decision to restructure administrative organizations
 and thoroughly reform the cadre system is the fourth very important task
 which is being carried out by our party.  This very important task has a
 great bearing on making continued efforts to open up new prospects and give
 full play to the superiority of the socialist system.  It also has a very
 vital bearing on whether we can carry forward the organizational line and
 forge ahead into the future so as to guarantee the successful promotion of
 our modernization programs, and will affect the rise or fall of our party
 and our country.   If this task is fulfilled successfully, our country will
 have great order and stability for a long time to come and will also prosper.
 It is quite clear that due to the successful fulfillment of the three very
 important tasks mentioned above, the major policies of our party and our
 country have been determined and the situation of unity and stability is
 being consolidated day by day,  thus creating conditions for successfully
 carrying out the fourth very important task.   Vast numbers of cadres and the
 masses have longed for the streamlining of administrative organizations and
 the reforming of the cadre system for a very long period of time and the
 great majority of the people of our country have achieved a common under-
 standing of the streamlining and the reform.                     The longing and the common
 understanding have laid the ideological foundation for successfully ful-
 T illing this important task.  The party Central Committee has conscientiously
 summed up historical experiences and adopted, after careful consideration,
 the correct guiding principles, policies and measures for carrying out the
 restructuring.  This offers a solid and reliable guarantee for the successful
 fulfillment of this task.   In particular, while proletarian revolutionaries
 of the older generation and many of our party's long-tested, loyal and
 devoted comrades are still living and in good health, we should avail our-
 selves of this golden opportunity to rely on their experiences, wisdom and
 prestige to carry out the restructuring.   Therefore, we must be resolute,
 surmount difficulties in and obstacles to the restructuring and strive for
 victory in the restructuring.
 With regard to the current restructuring, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly
 noted:   In a certain sense, restructuring administrative organizations is
 a revolution.  However, this is aimed at revolutionizing administrative
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 organizations and the system, and it is not a revolution against people.
 This is a very penetrating judgment which clearly points out the character
 and the mission of this revolution.   Of course, it is not a political revo-
 lution in which one class overthrows another class.  We have drawn a conclu-
 sion from the "Great Cultural Revolution," which was a civil disturbance:
 Under the socialist conditions, this kind of political revolution had neither
 an economic basis nor a political basis.  In this sense, we deem that
 restructuring administrative organizations is imbued with a revolutionary
 character.  This is because the restructuring is aimed at reforming those
 parts of our party and government organizations that are incompatible with
 our socialist modernization programs.  In other words, this is a revolution
 against overstaffed organizations, irrational systems and all sorts of
 bureaucratism.  There should be no misunderstanding of this point.  A revolu-
 tion that is imbued with  this kind of character must be carried out under
 the leadership of our party and through the socialist system.  Moreover, we
 must adopt measures that conform to the PRC Constitution and the party con-
 stitution so that we can carry out a well-guided, systematic and orderly
 revolution and further improve and strengthen, within the framework of the
 leadership system, the state system of the people's democratic dictatorship.
 This is essentially the socialist superstructure going through a process of
 self-regulation and self-perfection to eliminate its own defects.  It is
 imperative to go through a long process in turning those relatively imperfect
 and unsound parts of our country's socialist superstructure into relatively
 perfect sound ones.   The development of socialist productive forces will cer-
 tainly require the timely and resolute reform of those specific systems that
 hamper the development of the productive forces.  This is the demand made of
 us by the logic of historical development.
 In fact, the basic theory of the current revolution was advanced long ago at
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.   The communique of
 the third plenary session noted:  "Carrying out the four modernizations
 requires great growth in the productive forces, which in turn requires
 diverse changes in those aspects of the production relationships and the
 superstructure that are not in harmony with the growth of the productive
 forces, and requires changes in all methods of management, actions and
 thinking that stand in the way of such growth.  It is, therefore, a profound
 and extensive revolution."  This theory has been further expounded in the
 "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC."  The "Resolution" noted:  The process, from the
 implementation of socialism until communism is finally realized, is a great
 revolution, unprecedented in human history.  "Differing from the revolutions
 before the overthrow of the system of exploitation, this revolution is carried
 out not through fierce class confrontation and conflict, but through the
 strength of the socialist system itself, under leadership, step by step and in
 an orderly way."  The "Resolution" added:  Our present endeavor to build a
 modern socialist China constitutes but one stage of this great revolution.
 Our current restructuring of administrative organizations is precisely a
 major strategic move at this stage.   It essentially demands that we use the
 revolutionary spirit to thoroughly restructure our country's leadership and
 management systems including the cadre system.  Historical experience gained
 since the founding of the PRC shows that with the exception of the "Great
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Cultural Revolution," which was a civil disturbance, although the streamlin-
 ing of administrative organizations and the fight against bureaucratism have
 been carried out many times, the "streamlining" always ended up with more
 unwieldy organizations and with bureaucratic phenomena as rife as before.
 Practice has proved that if we just treat symptoms and not the disease, we
 will never be able to solve fundamental problems.  The current accumulated
 problems in party and government organizations at all levels and also in the
 cadre system are more serious and complicated than those before the "Great
 Cultural Revolution."  If we are not determined to carry out a revolution,
 we will not be able to streamline administrative organizations, will not
 succeed in reforming the management system and the cadre system and will
 also fail to overcome bureaucratism.  If things continue this way, our
 modernization programs will become hopeless programs and our party and our
 country will even be in danger of being subjugated.
 First, it is imperative to conscientiously streamline administrative organi-
 zations.  To promote our socialist modernization programs, all our adminis-
 trative organizations must have'scientific division of labor, clearly define
 the duties incumbent on each person and post, handle affairs promptly and
 correctly and reach unanimity through consultation.  Therefore, the current
 restructuring must proceed from actual needs; determine the organic struc-
 ture, the number of required personnel and the tasks of each organization;
 and establish a stringent system for checking on working personnel of the
 state and a stringent system of rewards and penalties for working personnel
 of the state.  Through the restructuring, we must turn our administrative
 organizations into able and efficient ones and raise work efficiency.
 We must conscientiously eliminate the malpractices resulting from overlapping
 and overstaffed administrations with their multitiered departments crammed
 full of superfluous personnel who have no clearly defined duties in their
 posts and resolutely overcome the phenomena of shirking responsibility and
 taking a dilatory and irresponsible attitude toward work.
 Second, it is imperative to carry out a fundamental reform of the cadre
 system.  This means abolishing the existing life-tenure system of leading
 cadres.  On the one hand, we must establish a system to enable old cadres
 to retire,  to leave jobs for convalescence or to withdraw to the second line.
 This system is fundamentally different from "remaining a revolutionary to the
 end of one's life."  On the other hand, we must also pick the good and
 select the capable for public posts.  This means promoting a large number of
 young and middle-aged cadres to leading posts at all levels and, depending
 on their integrity and ability, to turn our leading groups into revolu-
 tionary, young, learned and professional groups.   Only by so doing can we
 put an end once and for all to the aging circle within leading groups.   The
 key to reforming the cadre system lies in selecting young cadres.   We must
 select good cadres and insist on having cadres who have both ability and
 integrity.  We absolutely must not promote those people who built them-
 selves up by following Lin Biao and Jiang Qing and their partners and by
 becoming rebels; those people who are imbued with serious factional ideas;
 those people who were engaged in beating, smashing and looting; and those

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 people who have violated the law and discipline in either the political field
 or the economic field during the past few years.  Such people who have
 already been promoted to leading posts must be resolutely dismissed from
 their posts.
 Third, it is imperative to do well in training cadres in rotation.  According
 to the new demand set on our cadres by the historical tasks of the new
 period, our cadres not only must have lofty revolutionary ideals and the
 spirit of being brave in devoting themselves to the revolutionary cause but
 must also have competent scientific and cultural knowledge and the profes-
 sional ability to carry out work.  Many of our cadres have met the require-
 ments after tempering and educating themselves over a long period of time.
 However, a considerable number of cadres, for various reasons, have not met
 or have not fully met the requirements.  Therefore, it is quite necessary to
 train cadres by stages and in groups, strengthen the building of the cadre
 ranks, enhance the quality of the cadre ranks and enable our cadres to
 master the skills needed for organizing domestic economic construction and
 developing economic relations with foreign countries.
 Fourth, it is imperative to lay the foundation for the reform of the whole
 country's implementation of an overcentralized management system in the
 economic, political and cultural fields and also in social life, our party
 and government organizations and departments administered many affairs
 that should not be and cannot be administered by them, and administered
 many affairs that can never be successfully administered by them.  There-
 fore, we must take the current restructuring of administrative organizations
 as the forerunner and further reform the whole country's management system.
 Affairs that should be handled by enterprises and public units must be reso-
 lutely given to such enterprises and units, and such affairs must no longer
 be handled by party or government organizations.  We must also draw a dis-
 tinction between party and government work and truly change the long-standing
 phenomena of there being no distinction between party and government work and
 of the party neglecting party work.
 Obviously, the task of completing, within a relatively short period of time,
 this restructuring, which is of such great revolutionary significance, is a
 very arduous task.  How, then, are we to fulfill this task?  A revolutionary
 cause must be accomplished with a revolutionary spirit.  The revolutionary
 spirit we are referring to is the thoroughgoing revolutionary spirit that
 embodies the intrinsic quality of the proletariat.  The proletariat is the
 last exploited class in history.   Only by emancipating all mankind can the
 proletariat achieve its own complete emancipation.  The historical mission
 of the proletariat is to remold the whole society and to realize communism.
 The accomplishment of this great cause demands that within a very long
 historical period of time, many generations must carry on the struggle
 unremittingly and with strict discipline, solidarity and the courage to
 devote themselves to the cause.  This is precisely the thoroughgoing revolu-
 tionary spirit of the proletariat.  As a major strategic move during the
 historical period of carrying out our socialist modernization programs, the
 great task of restructuring administrative organizations can only be
 accomplished with this kind of thoroughgoing revolutionary spirit.   The

 unwieldy administrative organizations we established have become our custo-
 mary form of management.   To reform this form of management, we must change
 our patterns of action, our mode of thinking and those old habits, ideas and
 styles which were created by the narrow view of small producers.  This is
 bound to conflict and clash with our own feelings, habits and personal
 interests.  Certainly, the reshuffling of administrative organizations, the
 division of labor and work coordination in all fields, formulating stipula-
 tions concerning the limits of authority and duties and particularly person-
 nel changes that affect tens of thousands of people are all very arduous
 tasks.  In addition, it is possible that some out-and-out individualists and
 some people with ulterior motives will seize the opportunity to make trouble.
 Therefore, we have to maintain due vigilance.  We must use the revolutionary
 spirit to overcome all difficulties and obstructions.  When this kind of
 revolutionary spirit is manifested in the guiding thought for the restruc-
 turing, it means pressing forward with indomitable will and being fully con-
 fident of achieving the inevitable victory.                   When this kind of revolutionary
 spirit is manifested in actions for the restructuring, it means being firm
 and unshakable and also means that no matter how complicated and difficult
 the conditions are, one must not hesitate or compromise, still less give up
 halfway.  When this kind of revolutionary spirit is manifested in the
 measures for the restructuring, it means that the criterion of giving all
 to meet the needs of the revolution and the construction should be adopted,
 that administrative organizations must be streamlined and that each staff
 member must be charged with specific responsibilities.  When this kind of
 revolutionary spirit is manifested in the demands set on each individual,
 it means that every individual must take the interests of the whole into
 account, set store by the revolutionary cause and subordinate one's personal
 interests to the overall, long-term and fundamental interests.   The current
 restructuring must meet the following demands made by the party Central Com-
 mittee:  Improve the quality of work and raise work efficiency in all admin-
 istrative organizations and guarantee a successful realization of our
 modernization programs.  In short, during the current restructuring, we must
 attach primary importance to having great determination and attach secondary
 importance to being meticulous in work.  We must conduct thoroughgoing and
 painstaking ideological and political work, and inspire and heighten all
 party members' and cadres' awareness and sense of discipline in responding
 to the call of the party Central Committee.  However, being meticulous does
 not mean being overcautious.   If we are bogged down in meaningless worries,
 are pinned down by minor questions, cannot step forward and cannot make a
 breakthrough, we will not be able to fulfill any major task for the revolu-
 tion or the construction.
 We should especially point out that the presence of our veteran cadres is
 the major factor that will guarantee the success of this revolution.   Our
 country is a socialist country established after going through a protracted
 revolutionary war.   Our country has a group of"veteran cadres who withstood
 tests in different revolutionary periods and who are now the precious riches
 of the party and the state.   Our veteran cadres performed feats that can
 never be obliterated, for the party and the people during the war years,
 during the period of White terror and during the struggles to establish and
 consolidate state power and to develop the socialist cause.  The history of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 the Chinese revolution and construction has repeatedly proved that veteran
 cadres of our party are worthy of the title, backbone of the great cause of
 the Chinese people.  However, the life of an individual is limited and the
 knowledge and experience of an individual are also limited.  An individual
 can only play a certain role for a certain period of time in the long
 process of history.  With the passage of time, many of these veteran cadres,
 who are still living and in good health, become, after all, senescent and
 weak.  Their ability to shoulder heavy burdens is steadily decreasing.  This
 is a natural law that is irresistible.  We must solve in an orderly manner
 and in a planned way the problem of replacing veteran cadres with new cadres
 in order to carry forward the cause pioneered by proletarian revolutionaries
 of the older generation.  We must guarantee the continuity of the party's
 line, guiding principles and policies, the inheritability of the party cause
 and the maintenance of the situation of unity and stability in our country.
 If the replacement of veteran cadres with new cadres ends in failure, our
 party and state may face upheavals once again.  All our veteran cadres must
 take on these important political responsibilities.  They should regard com-
 pleting the current restructuring of administrative organizations, retiring
 from office or withdrawing to the second line according to regulations, pick-
 ing the good and selecting the capable for public posts and recommending and
 promoting able and politically reliable successors as the greatest contribu-
 tions they can make to the party in their later years and also as their most
 glorious historical mission.  As a big party and a big country, the CCP and
 China need several dozen veteran cadres to stay at the central leading
 posts of the party and state so that they can stabilize our battle forma-
 tion.  The several dozen veteran cadres must be world-famous, circumspect
 and farsighted, have the aptitude of being able to take the whole situation
 into account and plan accordingly and still be very energetic.  Other
 veteran cadres must gloriously "retire from military service" according to
 regulations after reaching a certain age.  In their later years, veteran
 comrades must attach primary importance to taking good care of their own
 health and attach secondary importance to maintaining links with the masses
 and developing public welfare business.   In particular, they should partici-
 pate in the social activities of educating the younger generation and con-
 tinue writing and complete their own revolutionary memoirs.
 This will be a rigorous test, related to a reform in the fundamental interest
 of the people of our country, of the party spirit of every party member and
 cadre.  We believe that in this test the great number of our party members and
 cadres will prove to be loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and not
 disappoint the expectations of the party and people.

 WILLINGLY SACRIFICE ONESELF FOR THE PARTY'S CAUSE--NOTES ON 'HOW TO BE A
 GOOD COMMUNIST'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6,
 16 Mar 82 pp 6-9
 [Article by Chen Yeping [7115 6851

 [Text]  Liu Shaoqi's "How To Be a Good Communist" stands out as a master-
 piece in the Marxist literature of the party and has had a profound impact
 on our party.  In the course of long revolutionary struggle and reconstruc-
 tion it has helped the healthy development of millions of Communist Party
 members, and has played a very important role in the establishment of party
 members' proletarian world outlook, the strengthening of party spirit, the
 preservation of the party's nature as the vanguard of the proletariat and the
 raising of the party's fighting force.  By studying this brilliant document
 "How To Be a Good Communist," contained in the first volume of the "Selected
 Works of Liu Shaoqi," we will come to appreciate the immortality of its
 thinking and also to realize that it is a sharp weapon that can be used to
 strengthen the party's construction.  It should be used to guide the party's
 comrades in their efforts to improve self-cultivation in their struggle and
 self-sacrifice for the completion of the great communist cause.
 Communist Party members should willingly sacrifice themselves for the party's
 cause.  They must first of all develop an unshakable faith in the invincible
 nature of the communist cause and the great ideals of communism.   Only when
 one has ideals and faith can one attain a lofty realm of thought, clearly
 determine the target of struggle and direction for work, protect vigorous
 and revolutionary ambition, willingly sacrifice oneself for the great com-
 munist cause, and struggle one's whole life for the party's cause.
 Faithful and unyielding in their commitment, innumerable revolutionary martyrs
 and old proletarian revolutionaries dedicated their own blood and lives to the
 heroic cause of opening up the broad revolutionary path.  The revolutionary
 martyr Xia Minghan righteously shouted:  "As long as we are right it does not
 matter whether or not you decapitate me.  You may have killed Xia Minghan but
 there will always be others to take my place."  Filled with the faith the
 martyrs had in the invincible cause of communism, these resonant words
 express a boundless faith in those "people who will take my place."  It was

 their commitment to the communist ideal and their faith in the certain vic-
 tory of the communist cause that allowed them to have such lofty sentiments
 and to willingly dedicate, without any fear of hardship or sacrifice, all
 their energies and even their life to the communist cause. The vast majority
 of party members today, whether they be party members who withstood the test
 of war and the period of White terror or those who joined the party during
 peacetime, all of them are filled with confidence in the cause of the
 martyrs and old revolutionaries.  They will struggle resolutely and tire-
 lessly for the lofty ideal of communism and using the sweat of their own
 arduous labor, they will write the glorious historical poem that the martyrs
 left unwritten.
 However, there are also a few party members, including certain old party
 members, whose communist ideals have begun to flag and whose faith has begun
 to waver owing to the corrosive influence of bourgeois thinking.  Caring
 only for personal gain they have forgotten the aim of communism and have no
 concern for the future of either the party's or country's cause.  Some even
 go so far as to say, "Ideals, ideals--if there is no profit it's not worth
 thinking about; future, future--forget it if there is no money."  Some
 people are dispirited, losing confidence and becoming depressed as soon as
 they run into difficulties or suffer a setback.  As soon as they see the
 bleak side of a situation they either lose all hope and become pessimistic
 or stand to one side spreading negative feelings.  It is quite clear that
 such ways of thinking have nothing in common with the lofty spirit of the
 revolutionary martyrs.  Anyone who has such an attitude cannot be called a
 member of the proletarian vanguard.
 Struggling through to the end for the communist ideal is the loftiest of our
 party's principles and is the sacred and lifelong task of all party members.
 As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, "It is our responsibility to follow the laws of
 human social development and promote the development of the communist and
 socialist causes so that communist and socialist society may soon become a
 reality."   ("Selected Works of Liu Shaoqi," Vol 1, p 123)  Whether a com-
 munist is worthy of the name hinges primarily on whether he has the deter-
 mination to struggle to the end for the communist cause and whether or not
 he will willingly sacrifice his life to the party's cause without a moment's
 hesitation.  Irrespective of the time or circumstances, every true communist
 should maintain an unshakable faith in the invincibility of the communist
 cause and should adopt the heroic attitude of "sacrifice for the revolu-
 tion."  Striving to overcome all difficulties that obstruct their heroic
 advance, the communist should work for the thorough victory of the communist
 cause and must be willing to shed his own blood in writing this new chapter.
 The communist cause marks a completely new stage in human history.  It is
 inevitable that as it advances forward it will run into various problems
 and difficulties.  This was true during our country's period of democratic
 revolution as well as during the period of socialism.  During the 32 years
 that have passed since the founding of the PRC, we have had both the
 experience of success and the lessons of failure, times of smooth develop-
 ment and also times of serious setback.  Certain mistakes made in the
 guidance of our work have been detrimental to our cause.  Some unhealthy

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 thinking and work styles still exist in our party, seriously damaging the
 relations between the party and the masses.  The 10 years of destruction
 brought about by the counterrevolutionary cliques of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing
 were catastrophic for both the party and the people of the whole nation.
 We should adopt an attitude of historical materialism in dealing with
 these difficulties and setbacks, and should reach a correct understanding
 through analysis based on seeking truth from facts.  We must certainly
 not allow these mistakes and shortcomings in our party's work to undermine
 our firm faith in the party.  Even less should we see the catastrophic
 destruction wrought by Lin Biao and the "gang of four" as the product of the
 socialist system itself.  Whether or not a party is a truly Marxist politi-
 cal party depends not on whether or not it makes mistakes but on whether or
 not it has the courage and strength to overcome its own mistakes.  The ques-
 tion, therefore, is not whether complications occur during the forward march
 of socialism, but whether or not we can draw the lessons and summarize the
 experiences of these complications and continue to move forward along the
 correct road.  Facts show that our party is not only good at following the
 tide of history, courageous in fighting the forces of evil, and overcoming
 difficulty and hardship, but also dares to reveal its own shortcomings and
 errors, and actively seeks to correct and overcome them.  Especially since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, our party has
 pursued a policy of bringing order out of chaos, establishing a Marxist
 ideological, political and organizational line and determining a series of
 important principles and policies.  By correctly summarizing historical
 experience, our party has found a.path toward socialist modernization that
 suits the national characteristics of our country.  As a result, the national
 economy is now advancing healthily and steadily along the correct track.
 Our future prospects are glorious.  Our cause has great hope.  Feelings of
 pessimism, hopelessness and dispiritedness are all incorrect.
 Addressing himself to those comrades who lacked ambitious ideals and a prac-
 tical spirit, Liu Shaoqi in "How To Be a Good Communist" emphasized that,
 "We Communist Party members must have the highest goals in our struggle and
 the highest ideals, while at the same time we must have a practical spirit
 and do real practical work."  "Only by combining the great and lofty ideals
 of communism with a real practical spirit can one be a good communist."
 (ibid., pp 128-129)  These words still have great significance today and
 merit serious attention.  A person without lofty ideals will never be any-
 thing more than a shortsighted and ineffectual mediocrity.  A person who
 lacks a practical spirit and does no real work will be a prattling onlooker.
 Grand and imposing buildings are always built brick by brick.   The success
 of an undertaking does not come about through talking, even less through
 waiting, but depends on real work.  While communism has lofty ideals, if
 these ideals are to be realized each item of work must be carried out in a
 concrete fashion.   For this reason, a Communist Party member must combine
 these lofty ideals with a determination to do a good job of one's own work.
 Our country is now going through a historical period of great change and
 development, moving from chaos into order and from poverty into wealth.
 The whole party and the whole nation is involved in the struggle to create
 a powerful socialist nation with a high degree of material and spiritual
 civilization.   Communism must inevitably pass through this stage; it is an

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 indispensable aspect of the communist cause.  Only when this historical task
 has been completed will it be possible to provide the material base and
 spiritual conditions necessary for the realization of true communism.  Every
 party member should devote himself to the party's cause and should have
 concern and deep love for this cause.  Dedicated heart and soul to the
 same cause they must struggle in an earnest and down-to-earth way.  And
 by working selflessly at their posts and by scoring outstanding results
 they will be able to make a personal contribution to-the ..four moderniza-
 tions.
 The personal interests of a Communist Party member must be sacrificed uncon-
 ditionally to the interests of the party as a whole.  It might at times be
 necessary to sacrifice personal interests in order to protect the interests
 of the party.  This basic demand that personal interests be sacrificed for
 the party's cause is a principle that should govern the thinking and deeds
 of every Communist Party member.  It is a condition that every Communist
 Party member must satisfy.
 Our party is a political party that works wholeheartedly for the interests
 of the people.  Aside from the interests of the working class and the people
 as a whole, the party has no special interests of its own.  A party member
 who pursues his own special interests at the expense of the interests of
 the party and the people is not a true Communist Party member.  A true
 Communist Party member must correct the relationship existing between his
 own personal interest and the party's interest and must, irrespective of
 time or place, put the interests of the party before his own individual
 interests.  Our party has always acknowledged the individual interests of
 party members and has done as much as possible to accommodate these inter-
 ests and to help resolve practical difficulties.  However, at no time is
 it permissible to place these individual interests before those of the
 party or to sacrifice the interests of the party for those of the individual.
 Whenever a contradiction emerges between the party's interests and those of
 the individual, one must be willing to protect the party's interests without
 the least hesitation and voluntarily sacrifice one's own individual inter-
 ests, and even one's life.  This provides us with an important criterion
 for measuring whether or not a Communist Party member has the true party
 spirit.
 If a party member's personal interests are to be unconditionally subordi-
 nated to the interests of a party, it is essential for each party member
 to have a lofty and selfless moral character and strive resolutely to over-
 come every form of individualism.  Individualist ideology is rampant among
 certain comrades and has in some cases given rise to the corruption of
 extreme individualism.   These people see the party's interests and lofty
 ideas as being empty and without relevance to their own lives.  "Material
 benefits" are the only things they recognize.  They fight for position and
 special treatment, demanding both official posts and authority; if they
 are unable to reach their goal they lose faith in the party and begin
 sulking and complaining.  They pursue a life of luxury and ease; caring

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 nothing for either the policy or principles of the party, they use every
 means possible to win favors for their families and sons and daughters.
 Their minds are obsessed with thoughts of advantage and material profit;
 they refuse to exert themselves if there is no profit to be had.  They con-
 tinually watch out for money, pull strings, go through the back door and
 engage in other crooked practices.  Some people have no qualms whatsoever
 about various illegal practices such as using official privilege for
 private gain, speculation and profiteering, corruption, smuggling, bribery
 and even embezzling state property.  Their deeds have already sullied the
 glorious reputation of Communist Party members, and there are some people
 who are becoming or have already become nothing more than common criminals.
 Whether one performs. one's duties honestly or decides instead to seek
 personal.gain is the fundamental difference between the proletarian and
 capitalist world views.  Personal gain is the very nature of capitalism and
 has nothing in common with proletarian ideology.   Communist Party members
 are vanguard fighters who oppose the capitalist class and any other
 exploiting class.  After overthrowing the exploiting class, how could these
 vanguard fighters possibly adopt the capitalist class' emphasis on profit
 as an article of faith?  Individualism forces people to forget collectivism
 and Marxism and gives rise to the lust for personal gain.  The history of
 our party is not without examples of the disgrace and ruin brought about
 by individualism, and we should take careful note of these painful lessons.
 The problem now facing us is that if individualism is to be overcome, party
 members and cadres must be. able to handle and employ their authority of
 office in a correct way and must under no circumstances use this authority
 to serve personal ends.  Many members of our party hold important leadership
 positions or exercise a certain amount of authority at their work posts.
 It must be understood that this power has been conferred upon them by the
 party and the people in accordance with the needs of work and that in exer-
 cising this power they represent the party and government.   No matter how
 great one's power might be, one always has a duty to serve the people and
 under no circumstances does one have the right to use one's authority of
 office for personal ends or to commit other illegal acts.   Seeing the
 authority conferred by the people as a privilege and abusing this privilege
 for private gain violates the aim of the party, betrays the trust of the
 people and damages the prestige of the party among the masses.   A Communist
 Party member must be faithful in the discharge of his duties no matter what
 the job.   He must be rigorous in carrying out the responsibilities of his
 office.   Using the power conferred upon him by the people to serve the
 people, he should become a diligent and conscientious public servant who
 lives up to the trust and expectations of the party and people through his
 own exemplary behavior.
 If we are to sacrifice ourselves for the party's cause, we need to con-
 stantly cleanse ourselves of the dirt on our bodies, dare to carry out
 struggles against all erroneous ideologies and unhealthy tendencies, adhere
 to truth, rectify mistakes, distinguish between right and wrong, be open and
 aboveboard, and struggle to maintain the purity of the ranks.

 Our country is in an historical period where we are carrying forward the
 revolutionary cause and forging ahead into the future.  Profound social
 changes are taking place.  Under such circumstances, all kinds of ideologies
 and tendencies will emerge.  Capitalist and feudal ideological influences
 constantly come to the fore.  The venom of Lin Biao and the "gang of four"
 has not yet been thoroughly eradicated.  This, together with the fact that
 we are expanding contacts with foreign countries, enables the bourgeois
 ideology and lifestyle to corrupt some of our comrades.  At present, the
 struggle between corruption and anticorruption is a struggle to uphold the
 purity of the party and sternly tests party members.  Consequently, party
 members should, as required by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, strengthen self-
 cultivation on all sides, self-consciously resist the corruption of bour-
 geois and all nonproletarian ideological styles, and struggle against all
 phenomena that endanger the interests of the people.
 Bourgeois ideology and various unhealthy influences are always present.
 However, they do not necessarily affect everybody.   It all depends on
 whether that person's resistance is strong.   The existence and size of this
 resistance, though there are many factors involved, depend primarily on
 whether you can be like a person who washes his face and sweeps the floor
 every day, that is, can constantly cleanse your body of political dirt.  By
 self-consciously examining and overcoming your own shortcomings and errors,
 you will be adopting a sure way of improving yourself and doing your work
 well, and this will be a significant sign of being responsible to yourself
 and the people.   Some comrades are reluctant to face up to their own short-
 comings and errors.  They always like to regard themselves as "consistently
 correct," have blind faith in themselves, claim credit for themselves and
 are arrogant, try to save face at the expense of truth, like to be flattered
 and dislike criticism.   This attitude makes them dirty all over and causes
 them to degenerate further and further along the path of error.  Owing to
 differences in background, experience, ideology, moral character and level
 of consciousness, everyone is bound to have one weakness or another, and
 this is bound to give rise to one or another shortcoming or error.  No one
 is perfect in this world.   Therefore, every comrade must know his own
 limitations and look at himself from the point of view that in everything
 one divides into two.  He must constantly carry out self-criticism and self-
 transformation, cast off all burdens, travel light, raise his consciousness,
 increase his party spirit and be happy to perform the various items of work
 assigned by the party.
 A good Communist Party member must-not only dare to struggle against his own
 shortcomings and errors, but also dare to struggle against the various
 erroneous ideologies and unhealthy tendencies.  At present, there are some
 party members who are pursuing a vulgar philosophy of life.   They say that
 "making one more friend means having one more opportunity, while offending
 one more person means having one more obstacle" and "we should plant more
 flowers and less thorns, because work is easier if you spare other people's
 feelings."  In the face of right and wrong, they fail to take a clear-cut
 stand, are not determined enough in their attitude, and fail to take charge
 of what they should take charge.  They fail to criticize what they should
 criticize and fail to restrain and struggle against erroneous ideological

 tendencies, allowing them unbridled freedom and even join with them and
 get soiled.  This attitude of "you're all right and I'm all right, so let's
 not interfere in each other's business" does not befit a member of the
 Communist Party.  When considering and dealing with problems, Communist
 Party members should proceed from the interests of the party and not from
 personal loss and gain.  In the face of principles and of right and wrong,
 they must take a clear-cut stand and be resolute and not vague.  As for
 erroneous ideologies and unhealthy tendencies which are detrimental to the
 party and the people, Communist Party members should step forward bravely,
 stick to their principles and carry on the struggle.  No matter whom they
 are dealing with, they must take charge of what they must take charge,
 criticize what needs to be criticized and restrain what must be restrained.
 They must on no account adopt an attitude that is liberal and which abets
 evil by tolerating it, or allow erroneous things to develop and spread.  As
 long as it is for the sake of upholding the interests of the party and
 people, they should struggle against evil phenomena, even if this means
 offending some people or suffering themselves some temporary loss.  It is
 worth doing so; ultimately, they will get the support and protection of the
 party and the people.  If, when they know something to be wrong, they think
 it best not to comment and sacrifice the interests of the party in order to
 win over someone's "feelings," that will be a sign that. they have abandoned
 their principles and soiled the party spirit, something which is incompati-
 ble with the glorious title of Communist Party member.  All of our party's
 comrades must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of being selfless and
 fearless and carry out an unrelenting struggle to correct the party's work
 style, promote the people's work style and maintain the party's prestige.
 They must play an exemplary role in restoring and carrying forward the fine
 tradition and work style of the party and in building a socialist spiritual
 civilization.   They must be Communist Party members in the real sense of
 the word.

 IT IS IMPERATIVE TO RECTIFY STUDY STYLE WHILE RECTIFYING PARTY STYLE--READING
 VOLUME ONE OF 'SELECTED WORKS OF LIU SHAOQI'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 10-13, 20
 [Article by Ma Wenrui]
 [Text] Comrade Liu Shaoqi was a great Marxist-Leninist who made outstand-
 ing contributions to the shaping and development of Mao Zedong Thought.
 The publication of volume one of "Selected Works of Liu Shaoqi" has added
 valuable spiritual wealth to our party and people.  Moreover, this work is
 permeated with a very important idea, that is, the good study style of
 integrating theory with practice.  When studying the "Selected Works of
 Liu Shaoqi," we should properly study this Marxist study style, conscien-
 tiously rectify party style, and effectively strengthen and improve party
 leadership on various fronts.
 The question of study style is closely related to the question of party
 style.  Only if we have the Marxist study style of integrating theory with
 practice can we gradually foster the Marxist style of thinking and style of
 work.  If we go against this principle, we will inevitably become separated
 from reality and from the masses, and even hurt the interests of the people
 and go against the Marxist style of thinking and style of work.  As Comrade
 Mao Zedong said:  "Study style is a question of the ideological method of
 comrades in our leading bodies, of all cadres and of party members, a ques-
 tion of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism and of the attitude of all
 party comrades in their work."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3,
 p 771)
 Comrade Liu Shaoqi was a paragon in upholding the Marxist study style and
 he made many brilliant expositions on the question of study style.  He
 said:  "We must modestly study the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and
 method, study the noble proletarian quality of the founders of Marxism-
 Leninism, and apply all this in our practice, in our words and deeds, our
 daily life and work, constantly correcting or eliminating anything in our
 ideology contrary to it, and strengthening our own proletarian communist
 ideology and character.  This means that we should listen modestly to the
 opinions and criticisms of our party comrades and of the masses, make a

 careful study of the practical problems in our life and work, carefully sum
 up and draw lessons from our experience in work.  In light of all this, we
 should ascertain whether our understanding of Marxism-Leninism and our use
 of the Marxist-Leninist method are correct, and check up on our short-
 comings and mistakes so as to overcome them and improve our work.  Further-
 more, on the basis of new experiences we should ascertain whether there are
 any individual conclusions or aspects of Marxism-Leninism that need supple-
 menting, enriching and developing.  In short, we must integrate the universal
 truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of revolution."
 ("Selected Works of Liu Shaoqi," Vol 1, p 110; hereafter only the page num-
 ber will be given)  Here, Comrade Liu Shaoqi put forward three basic demands
 for upholding the Marxist study style:  1) use Marxism to purge all things
 contrary to this in our ideology; 2) use Marxism to examine the shortcomings
 and mistakes in our work and correct them; and 3) develop Marxist principles
 in the light of the new experience.  If all our party members, especially
 the party's leading cadres, can examine their own thinking and work on the
 basis of these three demands, conscientiously and not perfunctorily carry
 out criticism and self-criticism, and overcome unhealthy tendencies
 together, our party style will certainly take a quicker turn for the better
 and we will certainly create a new situation in various items of work.
 At present, some of our comrades are, to varying degrees, affected by the
 problem of impure work style, and this work style is closely related to
 their incorrect study style.  This is mainly manifested in the following
 three aspects.
 First, they are politically unable to completely fall into line with the CCP
 Central Committee.  Some of them suspect and resist the line, policies and
 principles of the party since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central
 Committee, or verbally support them but act otherwise.  Some of them go
 against the four basic principles, disregard party discipline and practice
 bourgeois liberalization.   Practice has already fully proved that the four
 basic principles and the line, policies and principles of the party since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee are completely
 'correct.  Why is it that some of our comrades still do not understand them
 at present and even go against them?  They have one trait in common, that
 is, they are unable to use the correct attitude of integrating theory with
 practice in dealing with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  As Comrade
 Liu Shaoqi pointed out:  These people "have a lot of old junk accumulated
 in their heads and many stubborn habits, prejudices and selfish desires, and
 lack the determination to remold themselves."   (p 114)  "These people are
 absolutely incapable of guiding their lives by the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism, and hence incapable of dealing with practical problems promptly,
 correctly and realistically according to these principles; sometimes they
 even adopt a negative attitude when practical problems have already been
 correctly solved according to these principles by the party organization,
 or by comrades other than themselves."   (p 115)   Today, are not some of the
 comrades with "leftist" and rightist erroneous tendencies clinging to their
 "stubborn habits, prejudices and selfish desires" and "adopting a negative
 attitude" toward the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee?  This
 attitude is dangerous and intolerable and must be quickly corrected.

 Second, they have a bureaucratic style.  At present, some of our cadres are
 suffering from the bureaucratic style of languidness, indulging in rhetoric
 and divorcing themselves from the masses and from reality.  This style is
 completely incompatible with seeking truth from facts and the mass line
 consistently maintained by our party.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his work "The
 Leadership Style That Eliminates Empty Talk" sharply criticized some com-
 rades for their bad style of "using a bureaucratic and rhetorical attitude
 in dealing with party resolutions."  (p 45)  Those comrades with bureau-
 cratic style will also rhetorically talk about supporting the line, policies
 and principles of the party, serving the people wholeheartedly and making
 contributions to the four modernizations.  The problem is that what they say
 is one thing and what they actually do is another.  We must get rid of the
 bureaucratic style and arouse our revolutionary spirit.  We must truly adopt
 necessary organizational measures, but, what is more important, we must call
 on every party member and cadre to restore and carry forward the Marxist
 study style of integrating theory with practice.
 Third, they use their power for private ends.  This is another significant
 sign of impurity in the work style of some comrades, and it is also a prob-
 lem the masses are deeply dissatisfied with and worried about.   Comrade Liu
 Shaoqi repeatedly said that the proletarian nature of our party determines
 the sole objective of our party, which is to serve the people wholeheartedly.
 Our party members and cadres must never use their position and power to seek
 private gain.  He pointed out:  "Our revolution is not for getting a wife,
 getting food or getting into the limelight, but for the sake of emancipating
 the masses.  Everything is for the masses; otherwise, the revolution will be
 meaningless."  (p 234)  "One must never regard the Communist Party as a
 narrow clique, like a guild pursuing the interests of its members.  Anyone
 who does so is not a communist."  (p 134)  He called upon "every party mem-
 ber to use proletarian ideology to combat whatever nonproletarian ideas he
 has, use the communist world outlook to combat whatever noncommunist world
 outlook he has, and use the principle of the supremacy of the interests of
 the proletariat, the people and the party to combat his inadequacy."   (p 121)
 Quite obviously, whether one serves the people wholeheartedly on takes
 advantage of one's position and power to seek private gain is a question of
 world outlook as well as a question of Marxist study style.
 To rectify the style of study, it is imperative to oppose dogmatism and
 empiricism.   Dogmatists reduce revolutionary theory to a rigid dogma.  They.
 do not understand that theory comes from practice and must be integrated
 with practice, and also must be examined and developed in practice.   Comrade
 Liu Shaoqi called these comrades "lame Marxists."  Empiricists regard their
 own narrow experience as universal truth.  They do not understand that revo-
 lutionary practice cannot be separated from the guidance of revolutionary
 theory.   Therefore, they are unable to stand high or see far, and might even
 lose their bearings.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi called these comrades "crawling
 Marxists."  Dogmatism and empiricism are both characterized by a division
 between the subjective and the objective and by the separation of theory
 from practice.  They are both subjectivism, and they both run counter to the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Marxist style of practice.  Dogmatism and empiricism often depend on, and
 take advantage of, each other.  Just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out:
 Dogmatism "can browbeat and mislead many worker and peasant comrades and
 immature young comrades; even very mature comrades who are very experienced
 in work but immature in their ability to discriminate in theory, are fre-
 quently tricked and captivated by them.  Therefore, they can put the party
 cause in serious jeopardy."  (p 299)  This analysis made by Comrade Liu
 Shaoqi in opposing dogmatism and empiricism is identical to the exposition
 made by Comrade Mao,Zedong.
 Our party suffered incalculable damages and paid a heavy price as a result
 of dogmatism and empiricism.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi's correct thesis on oppos-
 ing dogmatism and empiricism was precisely summed up from the historical
 experiences of our party.  This judgment has again been borne out in prac-
 tice since the smashing of the "gang of four."  The comrades who put forward
 the erroneous policy of "two whatevers" held that the things said by Comrade
 Mao Zedong were unchangeable.  Apart from other factors, judging from their
 method of thinking, this is also a dogmatic tendency.   If some people on the
 top put forward this erroneous policy, those comrades below whose theoreti-
 cal foundation was not strong and who simply worked in accordance with the
 instructions and narrow experiences of those at the higher level naturally
 blindly followed.  This resulted in the situation of 2 years of uncertainty
 in work.  By discussing the question of the criterion of truth and particu-
 larly by the work of bringing order out of chaos carried out since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the erroneous policy of
 "two whatevers" has been basically rectified.  However, these two erroneous
 tendencies of dogmatism and empiricism still exist.   For example, on the
 ideological and theoretical front, some comrades have not devoted their
 main energy to studying the new situation and new problems in the building
 of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization, and have not
 paid attention to theoretically expounding the four basic principles and
 the line, policies and principles of the party, or to solving the problems
 in actual work and in the life of the masses.   Rather, under the banner of
 emancipating the mind and breaking through forbidden areas,  they have
 hankered after the ancient bourgeois skeleton and fashionable things of the
 West and placed blind faith in the foreign dogmas of capitalist countries,
 as though all academic and cultural things of the Western countries were
 good.   In actual work, some comrades have looked down on theory and showed
 no interest in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.   They have paid even
 less attention to conducting a Marxist analytical study of problems in
 actual work.   Consequently, they are unable to break out of the framework
 of narrow experience, blaze new trails or create new situations.  In the
 examination, promotion and employment of cadres, they have not considered
 the consciousness and level of Marxism to be an important condition, and
 have even erroneously regarded some cadres who have theoretical training as
 "bookworms," as though cadres with a theoretical level will inevitably be
 dogmatic and incapable of doing actual work.
 After the Yanan rectification campaign, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out at
 the seventh party congress:   "Having overcome thought-stifling dogmatism in
 the party, we must make further efforts to remove the obstacle of empiricism
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 and start a campaign in the party to study Mao Zedong's theory of the
 Chinese revolution.  We may then anticipate a great upsurge of Marxist
 culture in the party."   (p 337)  This analysis by Comrade Liu Shaogi is also
 applicable to today's situation.   In recent years, in opposing the "two
 whatevers" and in developing the discussion of the criterion of truth, the
 tendency toward dogmatism has been criticized, but the tendency toward
 empiricism has still not been properly criticized.  At present, some cadres
 do not understand the policies and principles adopted since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, and some intellectuals, particu-
 larly young people, are suspicious of the four basic principles.  All this,
 of course, has something to do with being divorced from reality, but an
 even more important reason is the lack of education and training in Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  Therefore, in continuing to oppose dogmatism,
 we should at the same time pay special attention to the empiricism which
 looks down on theory.  Starting with the leadership organs and cadres, we
 should urge the broad masses of party members and cadres to conscientiously
 study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.
 To rectify the style of study, it is also imperative for there to be no
 discrepancy between words and deeds.  What Liu Shaoqi meant by no discrep-
 ancy between words and deeds was:   "Their speech is Marxist and their
 actions are also Marxist."   (p 296) This requires our party members and
 cadres to always adhere to the Marxist world outlook of dialectical mate-
 rialism and historical materialism, conform to the norms of communist
 ideals, conviction and morality, and use them to guide our words, deeds,
 work and lives.  Only in this way can we play the role of vanguards of the
 proletariat in socialist modernization.   Otherwise, we will become divorced
 from the party and people and make this or that kind of mistake.   The people
 are most realistic, and they often appraise our party by the actual actions
 of the party members and cadres.   Therefore, whether there is an accord
 between words and deeds among the party. members and cadres has a powerful
 influence on the masses.   Some of our comrades talk Marxism and also preach
 Marxism to others, but their actions are not Marxist.   What they preach to
 others is Marxism, but what they practice is individualism and liberalism.
 This has damaged our party's image among the people.
 The Marxist style of study requires us to seek truth from facts, to be loyal
 and honest,  to speak the truth and to be pragmatic in work and opposes the
 unhealthy style of indulging in empty talk and using high-flown words.
 Engels said:   "All revolutionary high-flown words and clamoring will
 inevitably lead to defeat."   ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 36,
 p 540)  Comrade Liu Shaoqi said:  "Certainly we must study theory, but we
 also practice what we learn.   The study is for the sake of practice." (p 111)
 In accordance with this teaching, we must study Marxism, practice Marxism,
 make words accord with deeds and think and act in a unified way to set a
 good example for the masses, and lead all the people in progressively and
 solidly fostering a fine social atmosphere.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 For the sake of rectifying study-style, it is also imperative to adopt
 effective measures in the direction of organizational leadership.
 First, we must organize the party members and cadres to conscientiously
 read books.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi said:  "Party members must bury themselves
 in books and studies.  This is not an expression of the 'academic school,'
 but what every party member engaged in the study of Marxism-Leninism must
 do.  Anyone who is more accomplished in Marxism-Leninism must go through
 this stage of burying himself in books and studies.   This was particularly
 the case with Marx and Lenin."   (p 219)   Comrade Liu Shaoqi on many occa-
 sions mentioned that for most party members, inadequate theoretical train-
 ing was a great shortcoming of our party, and this led to mistakes in
 guiding ideology on several occasions in the democratic revolution.  In
 the 30 years and more since the founding of the People's Republic, we have
 also encountered setbacks and the 10 years of internal disorder.  These have
 likewise been caused by mistakes in guiding ideology as a result of mistakes
 in theory.  At present the CCP Central Committee has already correctly summed
 up the historical experiences and accomplished the historical task of bring-
 ing order out of chaos in the guiding ideology of the party.   However, to
 enable our whole party to properly digest and assimilate these experiences
 and accomplish the historical task of bringing order out of chaos in the
 thinking and work style of the whole party, we must also advocate the con-
 scientious reading of books and the comprehensive and accurate mastering of
 the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. In the first
 half of this year, our party members and cadres of Shaanxi must continue to
 master politics and economics in accordance with the arrangements of the
 Central Committee.   Beginning from the second part of the year, they must
 conscientiously study Marxist philosophy, further enhance their conscious-
 ness and level of Marxism in world outlook, and unify their understanding
 and action.
 Second, we must correctly develop criticism and self-criticism.   At present,
 there are many problems in party style and study style.   How can we solve
 them?  We must conscientiously take up this weapon of criticism and self-
 criticism.   Comrade Liu Shaoqi laid special emphasis on self-criticism by
 the leadership cadres.  He pointed out:   "Experience proves that wherever a
 comrade in a responsible position seriously practices sincere and necessary
 self-criticism before the party membership and the masses, criticism and
 self-criticism by the people and the party membership, they will also
 develop,  their enthusiasm will be heightened, their internal solidarity
 will develop, their work will improve and their defects will be overcome.
 At the same time, the prestige of the responsible comrades will increase
 instead of being undermined."   (p 364)   Therefore, whether criticism and
 self-criticism can be properly developed has a great deal to do with whether
 the party members and leadership cadres have the spirit of conscientiously
 carrying out self-criticism.   Leadership cadres of our party at various
 levels must set the pace in carrying out self-criticism in daily political
 life for the purpose of rectifying their study style and party style.

 Third, we must carry out thoroughgoing investigation and study under the
 guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.  Comrade Liu Shaoqi said:
 "To authentically reflect conditions and independently make decisions, we
 must go everywhere to look and make inquiries, and we must read the works
 of Marx and Lenin and do a great deal of research."  (p 405)  In the last 2
 years, there has been a great interest in investigation and study with the
 impetus given by the leading comrades of the Central Committee.  However,
 judging from conditions in Shaanxi, there is still not enough investigation
 and study with the leadership comrades personally taking a hand in the work,
 especially in the direction of economic work.  Even if certain investiga-
 tions have been carried out, they are mostly sporadic and perfunctory and
 seldom thorough and meticulous.  More attention has been paid to investi-
 gation and less attention has been paid to study.  There are many problems
 which have been posed by understanding conditions but there have been few
 schemes based on serious analysis, proposed for solving problems.  Comrade
 Chen Yun has called on our leadership organs and leadership comrades at
 various levels to devote more than 90 percent of their time to investigation
 and study and less than 10 percent of their time to policymaking.  Our local
 party committees should devote more than 90 percent of their time and energy
 to inspecting and directing the implementation of party policies and prin-
 ciples and less than 10 percent of their time and energy to making arrange-
 ments for work.  Only in this way can we improve our level of Marxist
 leadership and can we propose and implement plans, schemes and measures
 consistent with objective reality and effectively fulfill various tasks of
 the party.
 Fourth, we must use the criterion of integrating theory with practice to
 examine theoretical study by party members and cadres and set up the neces-
 sary system of rewards and penalties.  The principal content of the examina-
 tion is to judge whether the cadres can use Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong
 Thought in directing their own words, deeds, work and lives.  As Comrade
 Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi repeatedly stressed, we must regard the
 ability to understand and implement Marxism as an important condition in the
 selection and employment of cadres.  Comrades who do not study or who have
 not done well in studying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and whose
 words and deeds are at complete variance, should be criticized and should not
 be allowed to hold important posts.  Those who are diligent in their study
 and can correctly adjust their deeds to their words should be commended,
 rewarded and promoted.
 At this historical turning point, fresh study is of especially great sig-
 nificance.   Comrade Liu Shaoqi said:   "How can we rectify our past mistakes?
 All comrades should study.  They should study past experiences, study the
 theories of Marxism-Leninism and study the methods of Marxism-Leninism.
 Only in this way can we go forward." (p 71)   I am of the opinion that as
 long as we do as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, we will certainly be able to
 restore and carry forward our fine party style and-study style and keep on
 scoring fresh triumphs in our socialist modernization.

 HOW DOES THE CAPITAL IRON AND STEEL COMPANY CARRY OUT ITS ECONOMIC
 RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 14-20
 [Report by the joint investigation team of the System Restructuring Office
 and the Economic Research Center under the State Council]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  The Capital Iron and Steel
 Company has achieved remarkable results in carrying out
 its economic responsibility system and has thus provided
 us with valuable experience in perfecting the economic
 responsibility system in our industrial enterprises and
 promoting the overall reorganization of our enterprises.
 In the Capital Iron and Steel Company, the economic
 responsibility system has been carried out in combina-
 tion with fulfilling in an overall manner the state plan,
 and thus the relationship between the interests of the
 state and the enterprise has been correctly handled.  By
 combining the implementation of the economic responsi-
 bility system with the improvement of administration and
 management, the company has correctly handled the rela-
 tionships between all its sectors.  Moreover, by combin-
 ing the implementation of the economic responsibility
 system with the carrying out of the principle of distri-
 bution according to labor, the company has correctly
 handled the relationships among its staff members and
 workers.  All localities should pay attention to learning
 from the experience of the Capital Iron and Steel Company
 in carrying out the economic responsibility system.
 The Capital Iron and Steel Company is a large-scale iron and steel integrated
 complex.   It is one of the key enterprises where the expansion of enterprise
 decisionmaking power was first carried out on a trial basis.   Over the past
 few years,  the various basic tasks in the enterprise have been strengthened,
 the system of personal responsibility has been restored and perfected, and
 production management has been improved.   This was especially true during
 the latter half of 1981, when the company established the economic respon-
 sibility system that combined responsibility, power and interests and
 brought about another great change in the enterprise.  As a result, the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 broad masses have become more concerned for their enterprise, their sense of
 responsibility as masters of their enterprise in making greater contribu-
 tions to the state has been intensified, and their spirit in cooperating
 in a united manner and in striving to scale new heights has further developed.
 Improving the administration and management has become the conscious demand
 of the staff and workers.  They have done a better job in carrying out and
 improving the original managerial system and have succeeded in shifting the
 focus of the production and management activities of the enterprise onto
 improving economic results, resulting in a remarkable rise in the economic
 results of their enterprise.  For example, during the first half of 1981,
 their monthly profit averaged 23 million yuan, and from August to December
 of that year the profit of each of the 5 months exceeded 30 million yuan.
 Thus they set a new record of the amount of yearly profit that they handed
 over to the state.  Among the 52 comparable technical economic indexes, 30
 have been raised to the advanced domestic level and 6 to the international
 level.
 In carrying out the economic responsibility system, the Capital Iron and
 Steel Company has followed a correct orientation and a correct path and has
 thus achieved good results.   It has provided very useful experience in
 establishing and perfecting the economic responsibility system and we
 should attach importance to its experience.
 I.  Giving Priority To Fulfilling in an Overall Manner the State Plan
 In the course of implementing the economic responsibility system, it is an
 important matter of principle for an enterprise to ensure the overall ful-
 fillment of the state plan.   In 1981, owing to the needs of readjusting the
 national economy, the Capital Iron and Steel Company was required by the
 state plan to reduce its output of iron and steel by 360,000 tons less
 than that of 1980.  This meant a cut of 4.7 percent in steel output and a
 cut of 7.6 percent in iron output.  Nevertheless, the state plan also
 demanded an increase in the profit to be handed over to the state by 270
 million yuan, which was 22 million yuan more than that in 1980.  Faced with
 these contradictory requirements, what should the company do?  Should it
 insist on changing the state plan by stressing the difficulties, or should
 it consciously shoulder the responsibility and conscientiously find ways to
 fulfill the plan?  After repeated discussions, the CCP committee of the
 company was of the opinion that fulfilling the production plan and financial
 tasks of the state is an unshirkable duty for a socialist enterprise, and
 that people had to fully estimate the latent potential in the enterprise as
 well as the difficulties in fulfilling the tasks.   It mobilized the masses
 to make budgetary calculations in 18 respects, organized them to analyze
 the favorable conditions for the production of the enterprise and to do
 research on ways to increase income and cut expenditure.   By so doing, it
 made them see the possibility of fulfilling the plan and imbued them with
 confidence in overcoming the difficulties and in completely fulfilling the
 state plan.
 How did the Capital Iron and Steel Company completely fulfill the state
 plan?

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 In arranging their production, they have not blindly pursued profit but
 strictly produced each kind of product in accordance with the state plan
 whether it was in excess or short supply and whether it was profitable or
 unprofitable.  Regarding products in excess supply, the company has reso-
 lutely carried out the plan for reducing their output.  In 1980, it reduced
 its iron output from 2.94 to 2.65 million tons and cut its steel output by
 70,000 tons.  As for products in short supply, such as pig iron for civilian
 use, which had only a small profit margin but for which there was an urgent
 demand in society and for which the state required the company to double
 the output, the company resolutely fulfilled the plan for increasing its
 output.  It did this despite the fact that pig iron for civilian use was
 70 yuan lower per ton in price than iron for use in steel production, and
 that the fulfillment of the planned target for-its production would result
 in a 2 million yuan reduction in profit.
 Where the implementation of the state plan for reducing output might cause
 a corresponding reduction in profit, in order to ensure the fulfillment of
 the financial task of handing over profits, the Capital Iron and Steel Com-
 pany did not copy the malpractices of some backward enterprises that adopted
 means other than improving administration and management and tapping the
 potential of the enterprise.  Instead it persisted in obtaining income by
 appropriate means and through proper channels and in conscientiously find-
 ing ways to make up for the possible deficit in fulfilling the state plan.
 First, it tried by every means to conserve energy, reduce the consumption
 of raw materials, save on various expenditures and vigorously lower produc-
 tion costs.  In producing a ton of iron, it used only 514 kilograms of coke,
 which was 56 kilograms less than the 570 kilograms of coke consumption
 stipulated by the state.  In producing 1 ton of steel, it used only 1,870
 kilograms of standard comprehensive fuel, which was 230 kilograms less than
 the 2,100-kilogram consumption level stipulated by the state.  During the
 latter half of that year, it reduced costs by 5.48 percent after a 3.08
 percent rise in the first half of that year over that of the same period
 the year before, and thus achieved a 2.4 percent net reduction for the year,
 resulting in a 13 million yuan rise in profit.   Second, it conscientiously
 investigated the market, readjusted its product variety in accordance with
 market demand, changed the orientation of its services and produced market-
 able products.  At the same time, it vigorously marketed products that had
 been produced according to the plan but could not be allocated to customers
 in accordance with the plan.   It reprocessed the 192,000 tons of iron it had
 produced without a contracted buyer and turned the iron into marketable
 steel billets and steel products.   Last year, it sent its staff to 25
 provinces and cities to conduct investigations on the steel products needed
 in manufacturing bicycles and found that there was an urgent demand for
 strip and slab steel.  It supplies the steel for 12 million pairs of wheels
 to 15 manufacturers of bicycle spare parts.   It also signed contracts with
 30 manufacturers of bicycles and of bicycle spare parts in 10 provinces and
 cities for supplying 12 varieties of steel and sold more than 11,000 tons of
 steel to them.   It expanded the sizes of iron pipes it manufactures from
 3 to 7, and supplied 17,000 tons of iron pipes to 68 water and gas companies
 during the latter half of that year.   These iron pipes constituted 40 per-
 cent of the nation's total output of iron pipes in that period.   Throughout

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 last year, the company marketed 14.8 percent of its products.  This caused a
 20 million yuan rise in profit.  Third, it utilized its surplus manpower and
 technical superiority to open up new prospects for its production.   For
 example, it produced steel structures for housing construction in rural
 areas and contracted for performing the tasks of processing and overhauling.
 This caused a 4 million yuan increase in profit.  By adopting the above
 means of saving on expenditures and increasing income, it. raised its profits
 by more than 40 million yuan.  As a result, its profits totaled 314 million
 yuan last year, which was 29 million yuan or 8.2 percent more than in the
 previous year.
 In balancing the interests of the state and the enterprise, the Capital Iron
 and Steel Company always gave priority to the interests of the state and
 adhered to the principle of ensuring that the state would get the larger
 share of the extra profit.   In 1981, the profit handed over to the state
 increased by 8.9 percent over that of the previous year, the profit trans-
 ferred to the company's reserve funds increased by 7.9 percent, and the
 profit allocated to the bonus funds for its staff and workers increased by
 2.4 percent.   The increase in the state's share of the profits exceeded that
 of the enterprise and that allocated for bonuses.  What the state obtained
 from its increase in profits in 1981 over 1980 was much more than what the
 company obtained.
 The practice in the Capital Iron and Steel Company has proved that so long
 as we correctly treat the relationships between the interests of the state,
 the enterprise, and the staff and workers as individuals, and so long as
 we give full play to the initiative of the enterprises, we will be able to
 combine the implementation of the economic responsibility system with the
 intensification of planned management.  At the same time, the company has
 also proved that, under the premise of ensuring the fulfillment of the
 state plan, the implementation of regulation by market mechanism within a
 certain scope and the increase of the output of the products needed in the
 market even by such a large-scale enterprise as the Capital Iron and Steel
 Company not only will not cause confusion in fulfilling the state plan, but
 will provide the necessary supplement to the state plan.
 II.  Implementing the Economic Responsibility System Level by Level Within
 the Enterprise
 In order to ensure that the company discharges its economic responsibility
 to the state, it must implement the economic responsibility system level by
 level within the company to combine the interests of the staff and workers
 with their responsibility and thus make overall fulfillment the common aim
 of struggle for all staff and workers.
 What characterized the Capital Iron and Steel Company's implementation of
 the economic responsibility system level by level?
 1.  Allocating the economic responsibility of the company level by level to
 all its departments and sectors:  In the Capital Iron and Steel Company, it
 was stressed that the economic responsibility system could not really be
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 regarded as implemented unless the implementation involved specific persons.
 If a department failed to implement the economic responsibility system in
 the sectors at its lower levels, it would not be able to discharge its
 economic responsibility.  The company first allocated its economic responsi-
 bility to the factories and mines under the company.  It required them to
 do the following things:  1) fulfill the targets assigned to them concerning
 the number of personnel, profit and increase in profit; 2) ensure the ful-
 fillment of the targets and tasks concerning quality, varieties, contracts,
 consumption, costs, employment of floating capital, safety in production,
 protection of the environment and trial-production of new products; and
 3) ensure the implementation of coordination inside the company and the
 fulfillment of the work requirements.  While stipulating the economic respon-
 sibility of its factories and mines, it adopted the method of transferring
 part of the profits of the factories and mines to their reserve funds so as
 to combine their responsibility and power with their interests.  Furthermore,
 the factories and mines allocated their economic responsibility to their
 workshops, then to their groups and teams, and finally to every staff member
 and worker.   Not only the departments that-directly took part in production
 but all the functional offices have established the system of personal
 economic responsibility.  The main content of this system is:  1) basic
 duties and work quotas based on professional division of labor; 2) specific
 tasks performed in conformity with the general tasks of the company;
 3) requirements in cooperation and coordination; and 4) development of the
 basic professional capacity of the offices and the temporary tasks assigned
 by the leadership.  Thus, every department and sector, whether it is a pro-
 duction unit or a functional office and whether it is on or behind the front-
 line, has been assigned its corresponding responsibility in accordance with
 the requirements resulting from the relationships and coordination between
 various production sectors.   Every person, whether he is a worker or a
 cadre, has been assigned in the same way.   The system of personal economic
 responsibility has been established in all the 31 major factories and mines,
 the 31 offices and the 242 workshops, and for 98 percent of its workers.
 As a result, the company has become an organic, integrated entity with
 close links.
 2.  Persisting in assigning advanced and rational targets to all its produc-
 tion and administrative units and to all its staff and workers:                    The economic
 and technical indexes in the Capital Iron and Steel Company are advanced
 domestically and some of the indexes are even advanced internationally.
 Under such circumstances, the company has relied on the masses to carry out
 careful investigation and make scientific forecasts, and thus has succeeded
 in persisting in assigning advanced and rational targets.   Moreover, it has
 placed even more exacting requirements on its units and people.   For example,
 in 1980 the proportion of coke for the blast furnaces in its ironworks was
 443 kilograms.   During the first half of 1981, it dropped to 420 kilograms,
 which was already an advanced index domestically.   During the latter half of
 1981, when the economic responsibility system was being established, the
 target was further reduced to 408 kilograms.  At the same time, it was
 required that more than 99.5 percent of the iron produced should be up to
 standard, that the costs of iron should be reduced by 2.2 percent and that
 there should be no breaches of contract.  All the ironworks succeeded in
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 meeting these requirements.  Furthermore, the proportion of coke dropped
 to 398 kilograms in the fourth quarter of 1981, and 99.9 percent of the
 iron produced was up to standard.  The establishment of advanced and
 rational targets encouraged the people at all posts and in all sectors to
 do their best to choose and employ the best technology, the best operations
 and the most efficient management possible in order to achieve the aim of
 increasing economic results.  By so doing, they promoted the widespread
 development of the movement of rationalization proposals and technical reno-
 vation and boosted the technical reform of the enterprise.  For example,
 the heavy.oil consumption index for the heating furnaces in medium-sized
 and small steel rolling mills was 22.6 kilograms during the first half of
 1981, but the target assigned by the company for the latter half of 1981 was
 only 20 kilograms.  Without technical renovation, it would be hard for them
 to attain this target.  They applied their wisdom and were determined to
 find a way out by technical renovation.  They substituted gas for heavy oil
 in heating the steel from below, and thus ,reduced the heavy oil consumption
 from 10 to 15 kilograms, resulting in a savings of 5,000 tons of heavy oil
 per annum.
 3.   Being strict and fair in assessing performance and meting out rewards
 and punishments:  In order to ensure the attainment of the various advanced
 and rational economic technical targets, the company had to be strict in
 assessing the performance and be strict and fair in meting out rewards and
 punishments.  Otherwise, the system of personal responsibility would remain
 only on paper and could not be really implemented.   Strict assessment of
 performance and strict and fair rewards and punishments must be scien-
 tifically based.   For this purpose, the Capital Iron and Steel Company has
 established and perfected in an all-round manner its basic work.  Using a
 series of quotas, measurements, original data and statistics, the produc-
 tion results of each post have been calculated in a fairly exact manner.
 At all its factories and mines, a statistical system was set up to record
 the performance of every worker,. which is publicized daily, analyzed weekly
 and summed up monthly.  An assessment handbook has been introduced to record
 daily each cadre's performance at his post.  The handbooks have to be signed
 and marked weekly by the leaders at a higher level, and rewards have to be
 meted out monthly in accordance with the marks.
 After the establishment of the assessment system, there was still the prob-
 lem of whether people were courageous enough to carry it out.  The Capital
 Iron and Steel Company has adhered to the' principle of everybody being given
 an equal standard in performance assessment.  All delinquents should be
 strictly punished without exception, and the practice of avoiding hurting
 anybody's feelings should be eliminated.   The company's clear and definite
 performance standard, strict assessment system, and strict and fair methods
 in meting out rewards and punishments has guaranteed the implementation of
 the economic responsibility system.
 The experiences of the Capital Iron and Steel Company has proved that only by
 persisting in making the targets advanced and rational, in fully implementing
 the economic responsibility system level by level, and in being strict and
 fair in assessing performance and meting out rewards and punishments'can we

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 mobilize the masses to combine the implementation of the economic responsi-
 bility system with the all-round improvement of administration and manage-
 ment.  Thus we will be able to tap the internal potential of the enter-
 prises and raise the economic effect.
 III.   Overcoming Egalitarianism in Distributing Bonuses
 In order to implement level by level the economic responsibility system
 inside an enterprise, we should link the degree of responsibility that a
 specific staff member or worker is charged with and the results of his labor
 with the economic results of the enterprise.  We should also overcome
 egalitarianism in distributing bonuses and conscientiously implement the
 principle of distribution according to labor so as to give full play to the
 initiative of all the staff and workers.
 In distributing bonuses, the Capital Iron and Steel Company has adhered to
 the following three principles:
 1.  Resolutely controlling the total amount of bonuses in accordance with
 state regulations:   Over the past 3 years, the profits of the Capital Iron
 and Steel Company increased at an average annual rate of 22 percent.   How-
 ever, the company strictly carried out the relevant stipulations that were
 laid down by the higher level in deciding the total amount of bonuses.   In
 1981, the Beijing Municipal People's Government gave the company permission
 to pay a maximum total yearly bonus as much as the standard wage for 3
 months (this was the highest bonus level that had ever been allowed in
 Beijing), under the condition that the company fulfill the tasks of reducing
 production and increasing income.  In order to control the total amount of
 bonuses, the company adopted the method of paying a conservative amount of'
 bonuses in advance every month so as to have leeway in paying the rest of
 the bonuses at the end of the year.  Every month all the units in the com-
 pany have to report to the company on the amount of bonuses they plan to
 pay, and the company then carefully examines them one by one.  If the
 amount is planned in strict accordance with the regulations and within the
 limit of the maximum amount that the company has stipulated, the company will
 give permission for payment; if not, the company will not give permission.
 Every month the company transfers 5 percent of the allocated amount of
 bonuses to its bonus fund reserve, and all the factories and mines in the
 company also transfer a part of the allocated bonus funds to their reserve
 funds instead of completely paying them out.   Last year the monthly bonus
 for each person throughout the company averaged 12.8 yuan, which meant that
 the average bonus for each person last year was equal to the standard wage
 for 2.9 months.   The bonus that was paid to each person in its production
 factories and mines averaged 13.2 yuan per month, which meant that the
 average bonus for each person last year was the equivalent of the standard
 wage for 2.99 months.   Over the past few years, the Capital Iron and Steel
 Company has transferred a total of 95.7 million yuan of its allocated bonus
 funds to its bonus fund reserve.   Some of this money will be used to fund
 housing for its staff and workers, and the remainder will be kept in
 reserve and will be used to cover any possible deficits in future allocated
 bonus funds.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 2.  The bonuses of the staff and workers are linked with the economic
 results of their collectives and should be adjusted upward or downward
 accordingly.  In the company there is a stipulation related to bonus pay-
 ment that if the factory, mine or office fails to fulfill the task that the
 company has assigned to it, no one in it will get any bonus; and that if a
 workshop, group or team fails to perform the economic responsibility that
 the factory or the mine has assigned to it, no bonus funds will be allo-
 cated to it nor will any person in it be paid any bonuses.  The monthly
 bonus that the same person gets in the same unit fluctuates in accordance
 with how the unit fulfills its monthly task.   For example, in the company's
 ironworks sometimes the average monthly bonus for each person reached as
 high as 24 yuan, but sometimes it dropped to as low as 10.5 yuan.  During
 June and July of last year, the ironworks failed to fulfill its tasks;
 therefore, no one there was paid any bonuses.  This stipulation encourages
 everyone to be concerned about his group or team, every group or team to be
 concerned about the workshop that it belongs to, every workshop to be con-
 cerned about the factory or mine that it belongs to, and all the units to'be
 concerned about the company.  As a result, all the staff and workers in the
 company are concerned about the fulfillment of the targets that the company
 is striving for, and, the units and people at all levels strive to increase
 economic results,   The company is using the common economic interests as a
 tie to closely link all its production sectors, and thus ensure its internal
 coordination and its final achievement of the goal of increasing economic
 results.  As the workers t}tere said, "This method of bonus payment means a
 team competition as well as an individual competition."
 3.  Acknowledging differences and reasonably dividing bonuses into grades:
 In order to overcome egalitarianism, we should, in paying bonuses, take into
 account the differences in the nature of the posts, in work attitude, in
 technical skill, in working capacity and in achievements.   First, bonus
 payments should vary from unit to unit.  The constant and coefficient in the
 formula for calculating bonuses for the company's offices has been set by
 taking into account the difference in the importance of their economic
 responsibility.  The formula for calculating bonuses for the company's
 factories and mines takes into consideration their. importance in production,
 the levels of their economic and technical indexes, their managerial
 standards and their work conditions.  Second,"bonus payments should vary for
 individuals.  The constant and coefficient in the formula for calculating
 the bonuses for individuals have also been set by taking into consideration
 the difference in the responsibility of the cadres, the difference in impor-
 tance of the workers' posts, in their technical skill, in the intensity of
 their labor and in their work conditions.  Thus the bonuses for every unit
 and every individual fluctuate in accordance with how tasks have been ful-
 filled.  Considerable rewards and heavy punishments have especially been
 stipulated for key posts, weak sectors and key problems that must be solved.
 By so doing, the company has fairly satisfactorily overcome the egalitarian-
 ism in distribution among its units and among its individuals.  According to
 statistics for a certain month, in its 20 factories and mines, 10.37 percent
 of the staff and workers received a bonus of 25 yuan or more; 68.14 percent
 received a bonus from 11 to 24 yuan; 13 percent, 10 yuan or below; and 8.49
 percent received nothing.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 The experience of the Capital Iron and Steel Company has proved that so long
 as we reasonably draw up the standard for assessing bonuses under the condi-
 tion of controlling the total amounts of bonuses within a prescribed limit,
 so long as we publicize the formula, constants and coefficients by which we
 calculate the bonuses, and so long as we strengthen our ideological and
 political work, we will be able to put an end to the practice of "eating out
 of the same big pot," overcome egalitarianism, and integrate the implementa-
 tion of the economic responsibility system with the principle of distribution
 according to labor by allowing reasonable disparities in bonuses.  We will
 also be able to give play to the positive role of bonuses in encouraging the
 advanced and spurring on those who lag behind, and avoid and overcome the
 negative role of bonuses, thus fully mobilizing the initiative of the staff
 and workers.
 IV.   Boosting the Overall Reorganization of the Enterprise
 Over the past few years the Capital Iron and Steel Company has done a great
 deal of work in reorganizing the company and has achieved great results.
 The implementation of the economic responsibility system put new demands on
 the various tasks of the company.  People in the company have focused their
 efforts on increasing economic results while continuously paying attention
 to the work of reorganizing the company.  As a result, they have raised the
 administration and management in the company to a new level.  They have paid
 serious attention to the following things:
 1.  Reorganizing the various kinds of professional managerial work:  For
 many years,  the company's planning was invariably related only to produc-
 tion, technology and finance.  As a result, in formulating plans the company
 paid attention only to production and neglected management, and it blindly
 pursued high output and neglected economic results.  Along with the estab-
 lishment and implementation of the economic responsibility system, the com-
 pany first reorganized and reformed its management of planning and then
 included its production, technology, accounting, purchasing and marketing
 into comprehensive production and management planning.   Thus the company
 began to organize all its activities related to production, technology,
 administration and management and formulated a planning system that is, in
 depth and scale, far more comprehensive, detailed, concrete, harmonious and
 thorough than before in order to actually carry out the state plan and to
 bring the company onto the path of increasing its economic results.
 According to the above-mentioned requirements, the company not only arranges
 its production monthly or weekly, but at the same time also arranges for the
 fulfillment of tasks concerning marketing, costs and profit growth.   The
 business of the control room in the company has been extended from solely
 controlling production to mastering the comprehensive changes in production,
 delivery of goods, marketing, profit and costs.   It draws up a production
 and management plan every day and strictly examines its fulfillment.   The
 purchasing work has changed from solely ensuring supplies to paying atten-
 tion to management in making the best choice of purchases by comparing the
 prices of different suppliers.   In the past the company's marketing was
 mainly concerned with carrying out procedures related to deliveries of the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 goods it sold, but now the marketing department has begun to pay visits to
 customers, to serve the customers where they are,-to make investigations,
 analyses and forecasts about the market and to supply information to the
 planning department.  The accounting work has also changed:  analyses and
 forecasts are made beforehand to promptly provide information for the
 decisionmaking of management instead of merely keeping historical accounts.
 Cost management has also been developed and has become the integration of
 professional management with mass management, and it is an all-round cost
 management with the participation of the masses.  The standards of all
 professional managers have been raised to new heights.
 In order to achieve the economic goals of the entire company, the relation-
 ships between all departments have also changed.                       For example, in order to
 garner 312 million yuan of profit in 1981, the company had to ensure that
 during the last 4 months more than 9,330 tons of its products were sent out
 every day:  220 railroad freight cars were used every day and 1 million yuan
 was earned every day.   This demanded close coordination and cooperation of
 the work in all departments in the company, including planning, controlling,
 producing, accounting, purchasing and marketing.  This also required putting
 an end to the old practice of each professional management department going
 its own way and shifting responsibility onto another.   Thus a fairly vigor-
 ous command system of production and management has taken shape under the
 leadership of the company's manager.
 2.  Reorganizing the basic work of the enterprise:  In implementing the
 economic responsibility system, they have strengthened their data manage-
 ment in addition to continuously perfecting and improving various regula-
 tions and systems.   Data are the basis on which the enterprise analyzes,
 readjusts and controls its production.  Technical and managerial activities
 are also the basis on which it carries out the strict examination and assess-
 ment of performance and on which it carries out distribution according to
 labor.   Since establishment of the economic responsibility system, the com-
 pany has decided to strengthen its data management.   They have vigorously
 reorganized the work of taking measurements and the work of making source
 documents, and have also reorganized the quota management.   Moreover, they'
 have designed a series of shop record forms and other forms for assessing
 performance in implementing the economic responsibility system and have
 established a general office of statistical control.  Throughout the company,
 they must manage 80,000 pieces of information and have gradually established
 a data management and feedback system.  At the end of 1981, the proportion
 of raw materials and fuel that the company checked the weight of when it
 received them was raised to 99.3 percent from 57.7 percent, and meters were
 installed to measure 95.22 percent of the company's consumption of elec-
 tricity, steam, oxygen, nitrogen, coke-oven gas, blast-furnace gas and
 compressed gas.   This meant that they had made significant progress in
 developing scientific management.
 3.  Reorganizing its management of labor and fixing a standard number of
 personnel in every department in organizing production:  In reorganizing its
 structure the company stressed that every worker or cadre had to work "with
 high efficiency and to the best of his ability" in order to make more
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 contributions to the motherland.  Having quite a few redundant personnel,
 the company has persisted in fixing a standard number in every department
 in accordance with production needs.  It has made a clear distinction
 between the staff and workers employed in the state-owned enterprises and
 the collective enterprises under it and has refrained from appointing any
 state-employed persons to collective posts or vice versa.  it has refrained
 from appointing the children of its retired workers to their parents' posts,.
 but has trained them, examined them and appointed them according to their
 abilities under the unified authority of the company.  In order to find out
 where the company has employed excessive personnel, the company has
 organized a technical assessment group, which has drawn up the standard
 number of personnel for every part of the company by recording the job
 activities and measuring the time these activities take and by sampling.
 From 1978 to 1981, the company found that 8,700 of its personnel were
 redundant, which was 12 percent of the present number of the company's
 personnel.  By trying every means to find employment for these redundant
 personnel, the company succeeded in appointing them to new posts that
 served the production and the livelihood of its staff and workers.  This
 reorganization of the company's work force through fixing standard numbers
 of personnel and strengthening work discipline facilitated the implementa-
 tion of the economic responsibility system.
 4.  Reorganizing and improving the leading groups:  The reason why the
 Capital Iron and Steel Company can successfully implement the economic
 responsibility system level by level lies in the company CCP committee's
 conscientious reorganization and improvement of the leading groups at all
 levels.  It has promptly promoted to leading posts at various levels the
 cadres who have been able to conscientiously carry out the party's prin-
 ciples and policies, who understand production and who know management well.
 At the same time, it has promptly helped and educated and even demoted the
 cadres who have fallen short of-the demands of the new situation and of the
 new tasks.   By so doing it has adhered to the principle that cadres can be
 demoted as well as promoted.  At present, among the 419 leading cadres at
 the factory and bureau levels, 70 percent have received education above the
 junior middle school level and 46 percent have been granted professional
 titles.  The average age of the 419 cadres is 50.1 years.  The company's
 leading groups are fairly crack and strong groups.
 The experience of the Capital Iron and Steel Company proves that the
 reorganization of an enterprise will create favorable conditions for imple-
 mentation of the economic responsibility system, and that the implementation
 of the economic responsibility system will in turn promote the overall
 reorganization of the enterprise.   So long as we integrate the implementation
 of the economic responsibility system with the overall reorganization of an
 enterprise and so long as we give priority to improving and perfecting the
 economic responsibility system in reorganizing our enterprises, we will be
 able to lead the staff and workers in our enterprises onto the path of
 improving administration and management and raising economic effect.

 V.  Vigorously Strengthening Political and Ideological Work
 The implementation of the economic responsibility system is an important
 reform in the administrative and managerial system in our industrial enter-
 prises.                        Every step in improving the system involves the correct handling
 of the relationships between the interests of the state, of the enter-
 prises, of the departments inside the enterprises, and of the staff and
 workers.  Therefore, various ideological problems and various problems of
 understanding will inevitably crop up.  In implementing the economic respon-
 sibility system and in paying attention to material incentives, we should
 never abandon the principle of giving priority to ideological work nor
 slacken our efforts in doing political and ideological work.  At the begin-
 ning of the establishment of the economic responsibility system, the company
 clearly set forth the tasks of building the two civilizations by achieving
 good results both in increasing economic results and in inspiring the revo-
 lutionary spirit of its staff and workers.
 In conducting political and ideological education the company has done the
 following things:
 First, it has corrected people's understanding of the economic responsibility
 system.  When the economic responsibility system had just been established,
 some cadres and masses did not understand the system.  Therefore, some of
 them had doubts about it and resisted it, thinking that "establishing the
 economic responsibility system in an industrial enterprise means using the
 methods of small production in developing large-scale production and that
 this means a retrogression."  Others were of the opinion that "this system
 is neither socialist nor capitalist and therefore will not work."  There
 were also a few cadres who thought that the economic responsibility was
 nothing but shouldering the assigned responsibility for profits and bonuses.
 As a result, they endlessly haggled in fixing the assigned quota and the
 bonuses.  In order to solve these ideological problems, the company con-
 ducted education in the aims and significance of the economic responsibility
 system.  Through study and through listening to the explanation of the aims
 and significance of the system, all the staff and workers in the company
 began to understand that in carrying out socialist large-scale production,
 they had to establish a strict responsibility system to ensure the normal
 operation of production.  This is precisely the demand of large-scale produc-
 tion.  Through studying the resolution of the 6th Plenary Session of the
 11th CCP Central Committee, which summed up 'both the positive and the nega-
 tive experiences in the past 30-odd years, they have begun to understand that
 ,the past practice of "eating out of the same big pot" and engaging in
 egalitarianism did not comply with the principles of socialism and that only
 by implementing the economic responsibility system and the principle of
 distribution according to labor and by acting in accordance with objective
 laws, can we really achieve socialism.   On the other hand, they have also
 begun to understand that the economic responsibility system does not merely
 mean shouldering the assigned responsibility for making profits, but it is
 an enterprise managerial system that combines responsibility, power and
 interests under the guidance of state planning.  By conducting these educa-
 tional activities, the company has succeeded in teaching its broad ranks of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 staff and workers to have a relatively correct understanding of the aims
 and significance of the economic responsibility system.
 Second, the company has conducted education on correctly handling the rela-
 tionships between the interests of the three parties.  In this respect,
 some staff members and workers had some muddled ideas.  They thought that
 "it is better for the quota to be fixed as low as possible in order to get
 more bonuses."  Some of them even upheld the practice of "paying out all the
 bonus funds," and were of the opinion that they would suffer if the company
 complied with the regulations in paying bonuses.  In order to correct these
 erroneous ideas, the company has conducted various forms of education to
 teach its staff and workers to understand the country's economic situation
 and to teach them to put the interests of the state first and make greater
 contributions to the state.   In the company's sintering plant, the management
 used the figures in the state budget report of the Ministry of Finance to
 give the staff and workers the following account:  In 1980, the state spent
 more than 20 billion yuan in providing various kinds of subsidies, from
 which each staff member or worker was benefited to the extent of more than
 400 yuan a year.  This meant that in 1980 the state spent a total of
 26 million yuan in providing subsidies for the staff and workers in the com-
 pany.   This account made the staff and workers understand that state
 revenues are drawn from the people and used for the people and that the
 fundamental interests of the state, of the collective and of the individual
 conform with one another.  Therefore, the enterprise had to make greater
 contributions to the state.  By comparing the ratios of increase in labor
 productivity with the ratios of increase in bonuses and by comparing the
 ratios of increase in the purchasing power of the community and the ratios
 of increase in supply of goods, it taught its staff and workers to under-
 stand the reason why the amount of bonus payments should be controlled.
 Thus they fixed in people's minds. the idea that "one has to strive to make
 greater contributions and should not haggle for more bonuses."
 Third, the company has conducted education on taking the whole situation into
 account.  After establishment of the economic responsibility system, there
 were a few units that paid attention only to striving to obtain more bonuses
 for themselves regardless of the interests of the whole company and the
 demands of the whole situation.   There were also comrades who worried that
 the establishment of the economic responsibility system would give rise to a
 tendency of "each striving for his own interests in the manner of everyone
 for himself and let the devil take the hindmost," and then the company would
 become a complex that existed in name only.  In order to correct these wrong
 ideas, the company has taught its staff and workers to take the whole situa-
 tion into account and to correctly handle the coordinated and cooperative
 relationships between different sectors inside the company.   Only when the
 staff and workers know how to take the whole situation into account and to
 correctly handle the coordinated and cooperative relationships between dif-
 ferent sectors can harmony between various items of work in the company be
 ensured and can comprehensive economic results be achieved.   The motive
 power plant has organized its staff and workers to make the following calcu-
 lation:   If the plant blindly lowers its expenditures and causes a drop in'
 the pressure of compressed gas below standard, this will cause a loss of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 760 yuan per minute to the pipe-welding plant, a loss of 1,530 yuan per
 minute to the Nos 2 and 3 blast furnaces, and a loss of 200 yuan per
 minute to the pilot plant.  This calculation made the masses see that.they
 should not restrict their calculations to what they can save on in their
 own unit, but they should also conduct the even more important calculation
 of the impact of their activities on other units and on the whole situation
 of the company.  Thus the masses have become more conscious in intensifying
 their unity and coordination with other units.
 In conducting political and ideological work, the company not only relies
 on a small number of propaganda cadres, but also mobilizes the ranks of its
 party members and key staff members and workers to take part in the work.
 In the company, there are 93 report writers at the factory or bureau levels
 and 2,018 propagandists who are not withdrawn from production.  These report
 writers and propagandists have written as much as 210,000 characters of
 propaganda material.   The company CCP committee requires its party members
 to play the exemplary role of pioneers and to do a good job of conducting
 political and ideological work in their groups and teams.  It has also given
 play to the role of the worker congresses in making the staff and workers
 take part in the company's decisionmaking on major issues related to plan-
 ning, production, benefits and distribution and in making them concerned
 with the collective and the factory.
 The experience of the Capital Iron and Steel Company proves that in imple-
 menting the economic responsibility system, we can by no means weaken our
 political and ideological work.  On the contrary, we should strengthen it.
 Therefore,  the political and ideological work is and will forever be the
 lifeline of our economic work.  Political and ideological work must be
 integrated with economic work and only thus can the economic responsibility
 system be developed healthily.
 The company's basic work in enterprise management is in relatively good
 order and its managerial standard is relatively high.   It has favorable
 conditions for implementing the economic responsibility system.  The key
 reason why it has achieved remarkable results in implementing the economic
 responsibility system lies in its having a strong leading group that is able
 to correctly understand the aims and significance in implementing the
 economic responsibility system and to conscientiously carry out the party's
 policies and principles.  As the economic responsibility system was imple-
 mented a short time ago, in some units of the company the system has not yet
 been carried out well, and some measures the company has adopted to imple-
 ment the system need to be further improved.  Moreover, the company should
 continue to improve its manner in handling its relations with the state.
 What form of distribution of profit should be adopted in a large-scale
 complex like the Capital Iron and Steel Company, which is mainly conducting
 its production according.to the plans of the state that are in the nature
 of directives?  What is the rational limit to the proportion of profit that
 a large-scale enterprise can retain for its own disposal?    These questions
 and a number of other, questions such as those related to the division of
 authority in the company and those related to the limit of the powers of its
 factories and mines, are to be solved through carrying out practical research.

 THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF SOCIALISM AND THE REALITY OF SOCIALISM IN CHINA
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 21-31
 [Article by Duan Ruofei [3009 5387 7236]]
 [Text]  In modern world history, following the development of the contradic-
 tions in capitalism, a new branch of learning--the theory of socialism--
 emerged as the times required.  When the theory came into being, took shape
 and was still in its initial stage of development, the historical conditions
 were immature, so it had to have a utopian nature.  After the 1840's, along
 with the gradually ripening historical conditions and the development of the
 movement for the working class to win liberation, through the discriminating
 and revolutionary creations of Marx and Engels, the theory of socialism
 proceeded from fantasy to science.
 Scientific socialism emerged on the basis of the international socialist
 movement.  After its emergence, it directed and promoted, in turn, the
 development of the socialist movement.   The victory of the Russian October
 Revolution helped turn scientific socialism from theory into reality in a big
 country.  After World War II, socialism developed from the practice of a
 specific country to the practice of countries on an international scale.
 At the same time, proceeding from the actual conditions in their own coun-
 tries, the working class and communists of the other countries in the world
 were all exploring roads leading to socialism.
 Under the leadership of the CCP and the guidance of the theory of scientific
 socialism, in 1949 the Chinese working class and laboring people won nation-
 wide victory in the revolution and established the state regime under the
 people's democratic dictatorship.   Through new democracy and the transitional
 'period of advancing to socialist revolution, the establishment of socialist
 society began in China.   This was the greatest and most profound social
 change in Chinese history.   The eighth national CCP congress, held in 1956,
 affirmed this great victory, summed up our experiences and clearly charted
 the path for the development of China's socialist society.
 From the establishment of our socialist society up to this day, more than
 20 years have elapsed.   During this period of time, owing to the serious
 faults and errors caused by "leftist" guiding ideology, and particularly the
 sabotage by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques during

 the 10 years of internal disorder, our socialist cause suffered colossal
 setbacks and the superiority inherent in the socialist system was not
 brought into proper play.  Despite all this, the socialist nature of our
 society has not changed.  On the contrary, it is precisely because our
 socialist system possesses outstanding stability and powerful vitality that
 we could victoriously smash the Lin Biao and.Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary
 cliques and corrected our own serious faults and errors.  Since the 3d
 Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, in proceeding from China's
 national condition and applying the theory of scientific socialism, the CCP
 Central Committee corrected once and for all the "leftist" mistakes in its
 guiding ideology, made a strategic decision to readjust the economy and
 restructure the economic system, and formulated a series of correct policies
 for perfecting and developing the socialist system, thus ensuring the healthy
 development of our socialist society.
 China's present-day society is a society established by the working class
 and laboring people under the leadership of the CCP and the guidance of the
 theory of scientific socialism by following the inevitable laws of histori-
 cal development.   The economic and political readjustment and reform we are
 'carrying out now under the direction of the line formulated by the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee are aimed at perfecting and devel-
 oping China's socialist society.  The reality of socialism in China is the
 concrete embodiment of the theory of scientific socialism founded by Marx
 and Engels and its development under new. historical conditions.
 Socialism is a social formation more advanced than. any social formations in
 human history and is an integral whole of the economic forms (the relations
 of production) which suits the more advanced stage of development of the
 social productive forces and the political and cultural systems which
 correspond to the former.  A survey of the economic formation (the relations
 of production) as the foundation will elucidate the problems we are going
 to discuss.
 In the theoretical system of scientific socialism, socialized productive
 force is a prerequisite for, and of basic significance to, socialism.  A
 socialist society without any socialized productive force would be nothing
 but a castle in the air.  Adherence to the thesis that only on the basis-of
 socialization of productive force can socialist society be established is by
 no means philistine economic materialism but rather Marxist historical
 materialism.  The most important ground for the argument which doubts the
 nature of China's present-day society is that we have not, as they see it,
 established a socialized productive force of the socialist society.  Whether
 we have established, after all, the socialized productive force of a social-
 ist society is indeed a basic prerequisite for judging whether our society
 is a socialist society.
 The reason why the theory of scientific socialism founded by Marx and Engels
 is scientific is that, generally speaking, it does not proceed from the
 concepts of rationality and equality and from wishes, ethics and ideals, as

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 the theory of utopian socialism does, to draw conclusions about socialism
 and to take socialism as an embodiment of such concepts as the realm of
 equality divorced from the state of the development of the material produc-
 tive forces; on the contrary, it proceeds from the observation and study of
 the laws of the development of the material productive forces and estab-
 lishes the objective grounds for the inevitable realization of socialism.
 Under the relationships of the capitalist commodity economy, in terms of the
 theory of scientific socialism, the historically developed socialized pro-
 ductive forces and all forms of the system of private ownership, including
 the system of capitalist private ownership, are diametrically mutually
 exclusive.  The result of the development of the contradictions between the
 socialization of productive force and the system of private ownership is
 the replacement of the system of private ownership by the system of social-
 ist public ownership which suits the socialization of productive force.  It
 means the birth and establishment of socialism.  All theories that depart
 from the survey of the socialization of productive force are idle dreams.
 It is impossible to build a genuine socialist society by leaping over the
 historical stages of the development of productive force.  What social
 forces to depend on and what path to take in realizing socialism as distinct
 from utopian socialism, but not the fundamental indication, is whether the
 socialization of productive force is regarded as the point of departure for
 theory; practice is the most fundamental demarcation line between scientific
 socialism and utopian socialism.
 Then, in terms of the theory of scientific socialism, what ultimately is
 socialized productive force?  In his work "The Development of Socialism
 From Utopian to Scientific," Engels summarized the description by Marx in
 his "Das Kapital" on the historical process from individual production to
 socialized mass production, as follows:
 "As testified by Marx, if the bourgeoisie does not turn those limited means
 of production from personal means of production into socialized ones, that is,
 turn them into means of production for the common use of large numbers of
 people, it will be impossible to turn them into powerful productive forces.
 Spinning machines, motorized weaving machines and steam hammers have
 replaced spinning wheels, manually operated weaving machines and manually
 operated forging hammers; factories which need the cooperation of hundreds
 or thousands of people have replaced small workshops.  Like the means of
 production, production itself has turned from a series of individual actions
 into a series of social actions and, in addition, the products have been
 turned from personal products into social products.  Now yarn, cloth and
 metal articles produced by factories are common products of numerous
 workers, which must go through their hands before they become finished
 products.   No one of them can say:   'I produced this product.   It is mine."'
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 426)
 Thus it can be seen that so-called socialized mass production, as Marx and
 Engels saw it, means the socialization of the means of production, the
 process of production and the finished products of production, and also
 means that the means of production are those which are commonly used by
 many people,  the process of production is that which is carried on by

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 hundreds or thousands of people in the spirit of a proper division of labor
 and coordination, and the finished products are those which are commonly
 produced and owned by them.
 Socialism is, in terms of its economic form, the inevitable demand of this
 kind of socialized productive force and the relations of production which
 suit the nature of the former; in other words, the socialist relations of
 production are established on the basis of this kind of socialized produc-
 tive force.  Then does present-day China actually have the socialized
 productive forces on which the socialist relations of production can be
 established as Marx and Engels mentioned?
 The social productive forces during the stage of socialist transformation
 and at the present stage (after the basic completion of the socialist trans-
 formation of the private ownership of the means of production up to now)
 were, generally speaking, in a state of uneven development, in which
 advanced and backward social productive forces coexisted.  However, in this.
 uneven development, the socialized productive forces have reached a certain
 level.
 The socialization of the productive forces can be analyzed from different
 aspects.   In the following passage, we are going to make a separate and
 rough survey of the situation of China's socialized productive forces
 during these two historical stages through some figures and dates and from
 different aspects.
 Let us first have a look at the basic situation of China's socialized pro-
 ductive forces during the stage of socialist transformation.
 First, after the founding of the PRC, we confiscated bureaucrat-capitalist
 enterprises and revived production.  By the end of 1952, that is, on the eve
 of the all-round implementation of socialist transformation, China's steel
 output totaled 1.35 million tons (the total world steel output in 1870
 including that of Britain, the United States, France, Germany and other
 advanced countries was 520,000 tons); electricity was 7.3 billion kilowatt-
 hours; the ratio of the total industrial output value to the total value of
 industrial and agricultural output constituted 41.5 percent; that of modern
 industry to the total industrial output value accounted for 64.2 percent and
 the number of staff and workers was 16 million.  Second, we adopted the
 principle of effecting socialist transformation simultaneously with socialist
 construction.  The socialist transformation made rapid progress and, at the
 same time, the socialized productive forces also developed at a very fast
 pace.  Between 1953 and 1956, the annual progressive increase in the total
 national industrial output value was 19.6 percent.   Third, what is particu-
 larly important is that while observing and studying the problem of the
 relations between socialized productive force and socialist revolution,
 instead of isolatedly and exclusively concentrating on the quantitative
 targets of socialized productive force (in the theory of scientific social-
 ism, there is no such mechanical definition relating to this target; of
 course, this does not mean that there is no need to have a certain quantity,
 and this point must not be misunderstood), we must put the question into a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 certain historical context and make a concrete survey of it.  It must be
 realized that the important part of the section of socialized productive
 force we possessed was highly centralized.  It controlled the economic life-
 lines of the whole country and furthermore had been in the hands of the
 state under the leadership of. the working class and become an economy that
 was socialist in nature.  This fact was of decisive significance.  The con-
 tradiction between this newborn socialist economy on the one hand and the
 continued existence of a substantial capitalist economy and individual
 economy on the other hand constituted the principal contradiction in China's
 new democratic society.  Dialectics tells us that contradictions push things
 forward.  It was precisely this contradiction, and the sharpening of the
 spread and struggle of this contradiction, that pushed our country forward
 from the new democratic society to the socialist society.   (Please note:
 In making a survey of capitalist society, Marx and Engels analyzed its
 contradictions between the socialized mass production and the capitalist
 private possession and pointed out that the spread and sharpening of this
 contradiction--centering on cyclical economic crises--would lead to the
 collapse of capitalism and the birth of socialism.  The contradiction within
 the range of history which Marx and Engels analyzed and which would propel
 history to socialism and the contradiction within the range of history which
 we are now analyzing are different and must not be analogized simplistically
 or applied mechanically.  To fail to ascertain that kind of contradiction
 manifested by the cyclical economic crises within the range of history we
 are observing and studying, and then to categorically assert that China does
 not have the historical grounds for realizing socialism, is to commit the
 major logical mistake of drawing an erroneous analogy.)   The pace of history
 is certainly not deranged.   China's transition from a new democratic society
 to a socialist society was a necessity of historical development.
 Let us take a further look at the situation of China's socialized productive
 force at the present stage.
 The number of industrial enterprises between 1957 and 1980 increased from
 170,000 to 377,000.   (China had 580,000 forging presses, of which 3 were.
 10,000-ton and above hydraulic pressure machines; there were 21 such machines
 abroad; of the 580,000 forging presses, 35 were 1,000-ton and above hydraulic
 presses, which was equal to the number of such presses owned by the European
 Economic Community.   It had 2.52 million cutting machine tools, only
 exceeded by the United States and the Soviet Union, ranking third in the
 world.)   The number of staff and workers between 1957 and 1980 increased
 from over 30 million to 100 million.  The output of steel between 1957 and
 1980 increased from 5.35 million tons to 37.12 million tons.  The proportion
 of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output
 value between 1957 and 1980 increased from 56 percent to 75 percent.  Elec-
 tricity was extensively used.   Such industries as machine building, automo-
 bile manufacturing, ship building, aircraft manufacture, electronics, petro-
 chemistry, plastics, chemical fiber and synthetic rubber had already been
 set up.   The use of the most advanced present-day branches of science and
 technology, such as electronic computers, automatic control, atomic energy
 and lasers, had already begun to be used in some departments.  Machinery,
 electricity and chemical fertilizers were extensively applied to agriculture.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 In 1980, the power-driven equipment for agricultural use totaled over 200
 million horsepower; electricity used in rural areas totaled 32 billion
 kilowatt-hours, and more than 12 million tons of chemical fertilizers were
 applied.  The area of farmland plowed by tractors was over 610 million mu,
 accounting for 41 percent of all farmland, and the area of farmland under
 drainage and irrigation totaled more than 670 million mu, constituting 45
 percent of all farmland.  The application of modern science and technology
 to agriculture had already begun.  An independent and comprehensive national
 economic system with socialized productive force as the leading factor had
 been gradually set up.
 The above figures and data are far from complete and precise.  However, from
 them we can see that China actually has a considerable socialized productive
 force.   In accordance with the theory of scientific socialism of Marx and
 Engels, the socialist relations of production can be established on the basis
 of such a productive force.   Our socialist relations of production are
 established on a material foundation of socialized productive force.  Pre-
 cisely because of this, our socialism is scientific socialism.                        Therefore,
 it has the outstanding stability and powerful vitality which can surmount
 serious setbacks and difficulties.  The categorical argument that we do not
 have the socialized productive force on which to establish the socialist
 relations of production as specified by Marx and Engels is groundless.  As
 for the argument that socialist relations of production can be established
 ,so long as we have certain political conditions regardless of the state of
 the productive force, this is of coursea misunderstanding or misinterpreta-
 tion of the socialist nature of the society we have established on the
 foundation of socialized productive force, and is not a Marxist scientific
 explanation of the socialist nature of our society.
 In accord with the theory of scientific socialism, socialized productive
 force is the material foundation of a socialist society, but on no account
 does this mean that the level of development of productive force is the
 only factor for the emergence and victory of socialist revolutions.  Marxism
 holds that the emergence and victory of any socialist revolution and the
 replacement of old social formations by new social formations are the out-
 come of the interaction of various social and historical factors on the.
 basis of the movement of productive force, and not the product of the single
 factor of the movement of productive force.  That is the case with the
 social change of the replacement of feudalism by capitalism and is much
 more so with regard to a socialist revolution in which the working class
 conscientiously establishes the socialist system under the guidance of the
 theory of scientific socialism.   The essential socialized productive forces
 are the ultimate decisive factor for realizing socialism but not the only
 factor;  they are the necessary conditions for establishing a socialist
 society but not the sufficient conditions.   The emergence, development and
 victory of socialist revolution in a certain country are the outcome of the
 common actions of numerous economic, political, ideological and cultural,
 practical and historical, domestic and international as well as objective
 and subjective conditions.  That is to say, a socialist revolution moves
 forward amid the "coordinated actions" into which various social forces are
 synthesized on the basis of economic strength.   One must not suppose that

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 this process of revolution is merely an economic process.  In addition, the
 maturity of the many conditions which promote the emergence, development
 and victory of the revolution in a certain country by no means corresponds
 mechanically with the level of the social productive forces of that country.
 Therefore, the world socialist movement is characterized by uneven develop-
 ment.  In the early 20th century, the Russian socialized productive forces
 developed on a considerably large scale, but compared with those of the
 European and other developed countries, its socialized productive forces
 were still low.  Owing to historical, theoretical, political and other
 reasons, the Russian socialist movement came to the forefront of the world
 ranks.  Moreover, the special environment created by World War I constituted
 favorable conditions for the Russian proletariat to seize political power.
 In light of the historical conditions of the Russian proletariat, Lenin
 pointed out that the process of historical development could be altered.
 He adopted the principle of first seizing political power and then wielding
 this political power to develop the social productive forces and led Russia
 in taking the socialist road.   In answering the accusations of Sukhanov and
 others that "the Russian productive forces have not developed to the degree
 necessary to realize socialism," Lenin pointed out:  "You say that civiliza-
 tion is necessary for the building of socialism.   Very good.   But why could
 we not first create such prerequisites of civilization in our country,
 ...and then start moving toward socialism?  Where, in what books, have you
 read that such variations of the customary historical sequence of events
 are impermissible or impossible?"  "While the development of world history
 as a whole follows general laws it is by no means precluded, but on the
 contrary presumed, that certain points of development may display peculiari-
 ties in either the form or the sequence of this development.".   ("Selected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 4, pp 692, 690)   This theoretical exposition on the
 rationality of the October Revolution (being in conformity with the laws of
 historical development) is of universal significance.  On the basis of this
 exposition, Lenin predicted:   "Subsequent revolutions in oriental countries,
 which possess much bigger populations and much more diverse social condi-
 tions, will undoubtedly display even greater distinctions than the Russian
 revolution."   (ibid., p 692)  The course of the development of the Chinese
 revolution has fully confirmed this prophesy of Lenin's.
 In modern times, since China was a semicolonial, semifeudal big oriental
 country, its social productive forces were, generally speaking, quite back-
 ward and also exceedingly uneven.   There was an advanced sector in the
 backward social productive forces, that is, the modern industry, which
 constituted about 10 percent of the national economy.  Although this sector
 .of socialized productive force was not a large proportion, it was quite
 concentrated, and thus it controlled the state's economic lifelines.   It is
 precisely this economic fact that fundamentally determined the course of
 development,  the future and characteristics of the Chinese revolution.   In
 analyzing this question, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:   "China already
 has a modern industry comprising about 10 percent of its economy; this is
 progressive and different from ancient times.  As a result, China has new
 classes and new political parties--the proletariat and the bourgeoisie,
 proletarian and bourgeois parties.  The proletariat and its party, because
 they have been oppressed by a multitude of enemies, have become steeled and

 are qualified to lead the Chinese people's revolution."  ("Selected Works
 of Mao Zedong," Vol 4, p 1320)
 In leading the Chinese revolution, the Chinese communists inherited and
 developed. Lenin's thinking--first, when the conditions for seizing political
 power were ripe, we first seized political power, then revived and developed
 the econony; second, on the basis of a certain scale of socialized produc-
 tive force, we formulated and carried out the principle of simultaneously
 carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction and creatively
 opened the path for socialist transformation which was suited to China's
 national condition.  Under the correct and strong leadership of the CCP,
 China entered the socialist stage at a relatively rapid pace.  Despite some
 shortcomings in that the changes were too rapid and the work was far from
 meticulous in the later stage of the socialist transformation, viewing the
 situation as a whole, great successes were really scored.  The brilliant
 successes in the rapid development of the social productive forces and the
 marked improvements in the people's living standards during the stage of
 the first-5-year plan forcefully prove this point.   That China entered
 socialist society earlier than some countries whose socialized productive
 forces were more developed was the result of the interaction of numerous
 conditions on the basis.of the required socialized productive forces, the
 result of the efforts of the CCP to lead the Chinese working class and the.
 masses of the people in active struggles by following the laws of historical
 development, the embodiment of the Marxist creative power of the Chinese
 working class and the Chinese people, and the pride and glory of the
 Chinese nation.
 When we say that China really has the socialized productive forces on which
 .socialist relations of production can be established, we do not mean that
 all the productive forces of our country, have reached the level of socializa-
 tion.   Viewed from the situation as a whole and compared with the world's
 developed countries at present, the level of our productive forces is rela-
 tively low; the level of development of the productive forces is also quite
 uneven, in terms of the national scale.  Simple manual tools, modern large
 machines and automated mechanical systems exist side by side.
 It is because of this state of affairs that our country cannot adopt a
 unitary system of socialist ownership at the present stage.  In any case,
 our socialized productive forces occupy a dominant position in the whole
 production of the country, and socialized mass production dominates all
 of the country's economic lifelines.  Therefore, our system of socialist
 ownership also occupies a. dominant position. In addition, "this is a kind
 of general light illuminating all things and it will act on all other
 colors within it and change their hue."   ("Selected Works of Marx and
 Engels," Vol 2, p 109)  Illuminated by the brilliance of the system of
 socialist ownership, the economy under the system of individual ownership
 by the working people, within certain prescribed limits, has changed its
 own color and become a necessary complement to the socialist economy.

 In regard to the nature of China's present-day society, no matter what
 comments some people at home and abroad might make and what judgments they
 might pass, in the whole social and economic relations of our country, the
 system of socialist ownership occupies a dominant position, and this is a
 hard fact which speaks louder than any words.   Please look at:
 Industry (1980)--The total industrial output value under the state owner-
 ship system constituted 78.7 percent and that under the system of collective
 ownership, 20.7 percent; the two added together comprised 99.4 percent.
 That was largely the case with fixed assets and the number of staff and
 workers.
 Agriculture (1980)--The area of cultivated farmland under the state owner-
 ship system accounted for 5.7 percent and that. under the system of collec-
 tive ownership, 94.2 percent (which included the 7.1 percent of private
 plots of the commune members); the two added together comprised 99.9 per-
 cent.   The grain output under the state ownership system made up 3 percent
 and that under the system of collective ownership, 91.2 percent; the two
 added together comprised 94.2 percent.  The total agricultural output value
 under the state ownership system accounted for 3.8 percent and that under
 the system of collective ownership, 77.2 percent; the two added together
 comprised 81 percent.
 Commerce (1980)--The total retail sales of commodities under the state
 ownership system occupied 84.2 percent and that under the system of collec-
 tive ownership, 11.9 percent; the two added together comprised 96.1 percent.
 Finance--As the national centers for settling accounts, credit centers and
 centers for receipts and payments, the banks were already in the hands of
 the state and the system of socialist ownership dominated all positions.
 Then, is this society, in which the system of socialist ownership occupies
 a leading and predominant position, not socialist in nature?   Can we doubt
 the socialist nature of our society just because the system of socialist
 ownership has not, in the whole economic relations, reached the extent of
 "being perfect and pure"?  Or must a society be regarded as a socialist
 society only after the whole society has entered the "perfect and pure"
 socialist relations of production?
 Here.we can make a historical survey and comparison.
 In the slave society, the system of ownership by the slave owners consti-
 tuted the basic economic relationships of the society and thus determined
 the nature of the society.  However, in addition to this, there were still
 large numbers of people free from the system of ownership by the slave
 owners.   The society was actually not "perfect and pure."  Ancient Greece
 serves as an example.
 In the feudal society, the system of feudal ownership constituted the basic
 economic relationships of the society and thus determined the nature of the
 society.  However, in addition to this, there were still remnants of the old

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 society of ownership by the slave owners, the seeds of future capitalism,
 and also a large number of individual economies of the land-holding peasants
 and small handicraftmen.  The society was actually not "perfect and pure."
 The European medieval feudal societies and the Chinese feudal society were
 the same in this respect.
 In the capitalist society, the system of capitalist ownership constitutes
 the basic economic relationships of the society and thus determines the
 nature of the society.  However, in addition to this, there are still a
 great number of multifarious forms of individual economy and other economic
 forms.  Neither is it actually "perfect and pure."  The most developed
 countries in modern history and at the present time, such as the United
 States, Britain and France are all societies like this.  Just as Lenin
 said:  "There is not a country in the world, even the most developed, where
 capitalism is to be found exclusively in its most pure form."  ("Collected
 Works of Lenin," Vol 29, p 163)
 The form of ownership system of a society which constitutes a basic economic
 relationship and occupies a predominant position in that society determines
 the nature of that society.  In accordance with this principle, ancient Greece
 can thus be called a slave society; the various European medieval countries
 can be called feudal societies; and countries in modern history and at the
 present time such as the United States, Britain and France can be called
 capitalist societies.   Why then, can present-day China, where socialist pro-
 duction relationships occupy a leading and predominant position, not be
 called a socialist society?
 In fact, in his "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx discussed this problem:
 "What we have to deal with here is a communist society (note:   this refers
 to its first stage, that is, the socialist society as we now call it) which
 has not developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, has just
 emerged from capitalist society..  It is thus in every respect, economically,
 morally and intellectually, stamped with the birthmarks of the old society
 from whose womb it emerged."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3,
 p 10)  Marx here depicted the general characteristics of a socialist society..
 The reality of China's present-day socialism has confirmed this depiction by
 Marx.  A socialist society, and especially in the early stages of development
 after its emergence, economically and in other respects "is still stamped
 with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerged."  Thus it
 is not perfect and pure.  It is a phenomenon which is in conformity with the
 course of historical development rather than something strange.  Everything
 has its historical course of coming into being and developing.  A socialist
 society will inevitably undergo its own course of development, a course from
 "imperfect and impure" to relatively "perfect and pure."  Today's Chinese
 socialist society is still in its infancy, but it has already the regularity
 of a socialist society.  We must not negate its fundamental nature because
 of its "imperfection and impurity."
 It must be acknowledged here that the course of development of the socialist
 society, which is from "imperfect and impure" to relatively "perfect and
 pure," is a.course of development which "is based on its own foundations"

 rather than being a "transition period."  The characteristics of the transi-
 tion period of socialism are just as Lenin pointed out:  "This transition
 period must combine the features and properties of both these forms of social
 economy.  This transition period has to be a period of struggle between dying
 capitalism and nascent communism--or, in other words, between capitalism
 which has been defeated but not destroyed and communism which has been born
 but is still very weak."  ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol 4, p 84)  When
 China began its transition from the new democratic society to the socialist
 society (1952), the proportions of the state-run economy, the capitalist
 economy and the individual economy in the national economy were 19.2 percent,
 6.9 percent and 71.8 percent respectively.  But the present situation is that
 the socialist economy occupies a leading and predominant position.  This
 state of affairs and the situation in which socialism and capitalism were
 in a state of decisive struggle of "who is beating whom" cannot be mentioned
 in the same breath.  The difference in quantity has changed into a differ-
 ence in quality.   In the mid-1950's, our country victoriously pulled through
 the "transition period," abolished the exploiting system and the system of
 private ownership, established the basic socialist economic, political and
 cultural institutions and thus entered the socialist society.  It is possible
 that the lumping together of these two historical stages of different natures
 will lead to "leftist" mistakes of inappropriately applying the economic and
 political categories in the transition period to the socialist society.
 These include the struggle between the two classes and the two roads being
 the principal contradiction in the society, and continuing to indulge in
 taking class struggle as the key link.  This is not merely a logical analogy
 but has been proved profoundly by historical lessons.
 It must be noted that the theory that it is still necessary to carry on
 "uninterrupted revolution" after our country has entered the socialist
 society (namely, the so-called theory of "continuing revolution under the
 dictatorship of the proletariat" or of "continuing revolution under social-
 ism") is in fact a theory which negates the socialist nature of our present-
 day society.   Engels said:   "The so-called 'socialist society' must, like any
 other social system, be regarded as a society which undergoes constant
 changes and reforms rather than a fixed and unchangeable thing."   ("Collected
 Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 37, p 443)  The changes and reforms of social-
 ist society mentioned here by Engels referred to those which took place on
 the socialist society's own foundations.  These social changes and reforms
 are fundamentally different from the political revolution and economic
 revolution of one social system replacing another social system.   These must
 not be jumbled together.   The course of the growth and development of social-
 ist society belongs to the course of a qualitative change on the foundations
 of its own quantitative regularities rather than a historical transitional
 period which undergoes a qualitative change.   Therefore, we cannot and must
 not carry on "uninterrupted revolution," because according to the definition
 made by Marx and Engels, "uninterrupted revolution" falls into the category
 of political revolution and economic revolution.   (Of course, this does not
 mean that we have fulfilled the tasks of our socialist revolution, and by
 no means does this mean that we need no longer do our work in the revolu-
 tionary spirit.   This must not be misunderstood.)                    At the first stage of
 communist society, the socialist society is a society with a relatively

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 stable social nature.  China has entered the historical stage of a stable
 development of socialist society.  The argument that China's present-day
 society is still in the course of "interrupted revolution" is, in essence,
 negating the fact that our country has entered the historical stage of
 socialism and is negating the socialist nature of our society.
 In short, our history has really entered the socialist society.  This is the
 foundation for our future progress and development.  All theories which
 negate the fact that our history has entered the socialist society in what
 ever form do not tally with China's realities.
 True, while achieving brilliant successes after the establishment of our
 socialist society, we also suffered tremendous setbacks and grievous losses.
 In surveying the reasons for the emergence of these problems, apart from
 the obvious factor of the sabotage caused by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing
 counterrevolutionary cliques, they include:  1) "leftist" mistakes committed
 in our guiding ideology; 2) drawbacks in the system which were shaped in
 history; and 3) failure of some of our concrete forms of the socialist
 ownership system and the distribution and management forms to correspond
 with the basic system of socialism.  Our mistakes are definitely not the
 result of'the establishment of the socialist system.  On the contrary, it is
 precisely because of the establishment of the socialist system that we were
 still in a position to promote a considerable development of the productive
 forces when we suffered all kinds of obstructions and sabotage.  The problem
 we are now facing is to restructure actively and steadily the system; to
 establish and perfect the operation and management forms which suit differ-
 ent systems of ownership, different regions and different departments; to
 promote the productive forces to develop at a proper speed; and to con-
 stantly improve and develop our socialist system while upholding the basic
 system of socialism.  We must do this after bringing order out of chaos in
 the guiding ideology and continually bring order out of chaos in practical
 work.  This must be done on the basis of a thorough and well-conceived
 investigation and study and when conditions are ripe, rather than changing
 the already established socialist system and turning around to go in for new
 democracy or state capitalism, as some comrades have advocated.
 The reality of China's present-day society is significantly different from
 the depiction on socialist society by Marx in his "Critique of the Gotha
 Program,'! and the assertion made by Marx and Engels that a socialist
 society is a society in which all the means of production are owned by the
 whole society and which has no commodities or money.   In the eyes of some
 comrades, it is imperative to take this idea of Marx' and Engels' as the
 criterion in deciding whether China's present-day society is a socialist
 society or not.  This kind of viewpoint and method. are, in our opinion,
 incorrect.
 In the theoretical system of scientific socialism founded by Marx and Engels,
 the depiction on the future socialist society is an important component part.
 Engels said:  "Since socialism has become a science, people are required to
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 regard it as a science, that is, people are required to study it."
 ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, p 301)  In regard to this
 depiction of a socialist society by the founders of scientific socialism,
 we must integrate the historical grounds on which they made this kind of
 depiction in their times with the socialist practice in the 20th century
 and study it in a scientific way.
 In the literature of scientific socialism, Marx' "Critique of the Gotha
 Program" occupies an important position.  In the history of the theory of
 scientific socialism, this work for the first time divided communism into
 the stages of different degrees of economic development and depicted the
 fundamental characteristics of the two stages.  Even now, it is still an
 important document for us in studying the theory of socialism.
 However, can we consider that, since the depiction of socialist society in
 "Critique of the Gotha Program" provided us with a scientific definition of
 socialist society, we must take it as the only and absolute criterion or
 pattern and use it to rule our present-day socialist society?
 First of all, we must clarify whether Marx' depiction on socialist society
 is a scientific conjecture and assumption or a scientific definition of
 socialist society.
 Marx' criticisms of the Gotha program, namely, the "marginal notes to the
 program of the German Workers Party" were originally marginal notes for
 criticism, written by Marx in the draft program of the German Social Demo-
 cratic Party into which the two parties in the German workers' movement
 (the Eisenaches and the Lassalleans) were going to merge.   In criticizing
 the Lassallean articles of creed in the Gotha draft program, such as
 "undiminished" proceeds of labor, "equal rights" and "fair distribution,"
 Marx discussed in passing some economic properties of socialist society.
 He made the following expositions:
 1.   Socialism is "a society based on common ownership of the means of pro-
 duction";
 '2.  Socialist society is a society "just as it emerges from capitalist
 society, which is thus in every respect, economically, morally and intel-
 lectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose
 womb it emerged";
 '3.  For this reason, in the distribution of personal consumer goods in a
 socialist society, distribution according to work should be practiced after
 various deductions are made from the total social products;
 4.   The labor of the individuals directly constitutes a component part of
 the total social labor.  Therefore, the forms of "value" vanish and com-
 modities and money are withdrawn from social economic life.
 So long as we make a careful survey, we will realize that the "Critique of
 the Gotha Program" was not a special work of Marx' which aimed at studying

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 the socialist society and solving the problem of its scientific definition.
 While criticizing the Lassallean articles of creed, Marx here only dis-
 cussed in passing matters relating to socialism and did not expound the
 various characteristics of socialist society in an all-round way.  For
 instance, in it there were no expositions on such principles as socialized
 mass production being the fundamental prerequisite and material foundation
 for the socialist society, or the extremely important economic property that
 production should be regulated in accordance with the needs of society and
 individuals in a planned way.  No further detailed deliberations were made
 to the already involved matters relating to socialism.
 What is particularly important is that the nature of these expositions by
 Marx is a kind of scientific conjecture of future things rather than a
 scientific summarization of the nature of the objects which people have
 fully understood.  On this matter, Lenin gave a reasonable explanation.
 He pointed out:
 "All Marx' theories are the application of the theory of development--in its
 most consistent, complete, considered and pithy form--to modern capitalism.
 Naturally, Marx was faced with the problem of applying these theories both
 to the forthcoming collapse of capitalism and to the future development of
 future communism.
 "On the basis of what facts, then can the question of the future development
 of future communism be dealt with?
 "On the basis of the fact that it has its origin in capitalism, that is,
 develops historically from capitalism, that it is the result of the action
 of a social force to which capitalism gave birth.  There is no trace of an
 attempt on Marx' part to invent a utopia or to indulge in idle guesswork
 about what cannot be known.  Marx treated the question of communism in the
 same way as a naturalist would treat the question of the development of,
 say, a new biological variety.   Once he knew that it has originated in such
 and such a way and was changing in such and such a definite direction, he
 would be able to expound the question of the development of the biological
 variety."  (See "Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 3, p 243.  The passages
 quoted here are retranslated.)
 Thus it can be seen that Marx' expositions on future socialism is only a
 scientific conjecture rather than a scientific definition or final conclu-
 sion on the socialist society.
 Marx did not define the socialist society and, in addition, it was impossible
 for him to do so at that time.  This is because, in order to make a scien-
 tific definition of an object, it is necessary to make such a definition
 after, and not before, one has had a relatively full understanding of its
 rich contents and nature.   Furthermore, only after the object has taken
 shape and developed fully, can a full understanding of it be obtained.  Just
 as Marx profoundly pointed out:  "In pondering the forms of life of mankind
 and proceeding to make scientific analyses of it, a road contrary to the
 real development is invariably taken.  This pondering is started after the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 event, in other words, is`.started with the results of the completion of the
 course of development."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 23, p 92)
 In the 19th century in which Marx and Engels lived, socialism, as a brand-
 new social formation and social system, had not emerged on earth.  How
 could they possibly gain a full understanding of the socialist society and
 give it a scientific definition?
 We do not regard Marx' expositions on socialist society as a scientific
 definition.  This does not at the least mean negating their scientific value.
 Conversely, we hold the view that Marx' expositions are of quite important
 and scientific theoretical significance, some of which contain great truth.
 This is because, although his depiction was a conjecture and assumption, it
 was formulated by Marx after making a strict scientific study of the
 developmental trends of the contradictions between the socialized produc-
 tive forces which took shape in the capitalist society and the system of
 private ownership under capitalism.   He applied the materialist dialectical
 viewpoint of development, and thus it was a scientific assumption and
 hypothesis.   It plays an important instructive role in the practical.move-
 .ment of socialism and will be verified, revised, enriched and developed in
 this practical movement.  Engels said:  "So long as natural science is
 pondering, the form of its development is hypothesis....  At first it is
 only based on limited facts and observation.   Further observed material will
 help these hypotheses become more pure.  Some are discarded and some revised
 until the pure form of a law is eventually reached."  ("Selected Works of
 Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 561)   Engels here brought to light the laws of
 scientific development.  The theory of the future socialist society develops
 in the form of an hypothesis.   This is a phenomenon entirely in conformity
 with the laws of scientific development.
 Judged from the standpoint of Marxist materialism, any theory of social
 science is nothing but a generalized reflection and abstract manifestation
 of a certain stage of historical movement.   This is also the case with
 scientific socialism itself, which was founded by Marx and Engels.   Engels
 said:   "Our theory is a theory of development rather than a dogma which
 should be recited fluently and repeated mechanically."  ("Collected Works
 of Marx and Engels," Vol 36, p 584)   The method of taking some conjectures
 and assumptions about socialist society, which were formulated by Marx and
 Engels and were based on the situation of the historical movement of the
 European capitalist countries and the United States in the 19th century,
 and their cognitive results belonging to certain historical conditions,
 as unalterable absolute truth and as an a priori pattern and sole criterion
 and using them to rule present socialist reality runs fundamentally counter
 to the viewpoint of Marxist materialist theory.   Theory is the expression of
 historical movement.   The socialist movement is advancing and the theory
 must also develop along with it.  Pushing the theory of scientific socialism
 founded by Marx and Engels forward on the basis of the present great
 socialist practice is the Marxist correct attitude in handling theory.
 By the 20th century, a tremendous leap has occurred in the socialist move-
 ment under the guidance of scientific socialism--scientific socialism has
 developed from theory to reality and the socialist system has been

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 established in large groups of countries.  On the one hand, the reality of
 socialism has confirmed the scientific hypothesis by Marx and Engels about
 socialist society, and on the other hand, some of the expositions in their
 assumptions (like their argument that there are no commodities or money in
 the socialist society) have been revised.  The present magnificent reality
 of socialism of the working class and the masses of the people has created
 and continues to create forms of realizing and developing socialism, which
 suit the national condition of various countries.  Because of the different
 national conditions and different courses of historical development, in
 present socialist practice, it is inevitable that there have emerged
 multifarious forms different from the original assumptions by Marx and
 Engels.   This is important development of the assumptions by Marx and
 Engels about socialist society and great progress in historical development.
 Under the direction of the line of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee, China's socialist practice has fundamentally corrected
 the "leftist" mistakes existing in our guiding ideology for a period of time
 in the past and ensured the new stage of development.  Having summed up the
 experiences and lessons in socialist practice since the founding of the PRC
 and studied the experiences and lessons in international socialist practice,
 the CCP Central Committee pointed out:  "There is no rigid pattern for the
 development of the socialist production relationships. At every stage our
 task is to create those specific forms of the production relationships that
 correspond to the needs of the growing productive forces and facilitate
 their continued advance."  ("Resolution on Certain Questions in the History
 of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC")  At the present stage (this
 historical stage is very long), the state-run economy and the collective
 economy constitute the basic socialist economic forms of our country and
 the working people's individual economy within certain prescribed limits is
 a necessary complement to the economy under the system of socialist public
 ownership.   Socialist economic units should become relatively independent
 major economic bodies in the unified socialist economic system.   It is
 necessary to fully develop socialist commodity production and commodity
 exchange.  It is essential to practice a planned economy on the basis of the
 system of socialist ownership and at the same time bring into play the
 'supplementary role of regulation by market mechanism.  In drawing up plans,
 it is necessary for the state to give full consideration to and use the law
 of value.  The point of departure and fundamental aim of socialist economic
 activities are to meet the increasingly growing material and cultural needs
 of the people.
 The system of socialist ownership, that is, the socialist production rela-
 tionships is realized through a series of economic activities, such as pro-
 duction, exchange and distribution.  Exploring the operation and management
 forms and distribution forms which are aimed at realizing the socialist prin-
 ciples is an important task in improving and developing the socialist system.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, we have
 exerted herculean efforts in this respect. In the vast rural areas, the
 implementation of various forms of production responsibility system has
 helped closely integrate the responsibility, power and interests of the
 various major economic bodies and the laborers and tremendously aroused

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 the enthusiasm and the creative power of the peasants.  Coordinated with
 other conditions, the production responsibility system has at one stroke
 swept away the many difficult problems which have existed since the agri-
 cultural cooperativization.   (Of course, many new problems have inevitably
 arisen which need to be constantly solved by the CCP, the people's govern-
 ment and the masses of people together.)  As a result, the situation
 suddenly cleared up.  Where does the secret lie?  Obviously, this state of
 affairs is not the result of the enthusiasm of individual production, much
 less the result of capitalism, but instead the result of effectively giving
 full play to the enthusiasm of socialism.  On the basis of public owner-
 ship of the principal means of production like land, the practice of unified
 leadership and decentralized operations have been introduced.  This practice
 is essentially different from the individual economy before the agricultural
 cooperativization or the practice of dividing the fields and working alone.
 This is a necessary readjustment of some aspects of the socialist production
 relationships and a restructuring of the management and distribution systems,
 rather than the replacement of the socialist collective economy by the indi-
 vidual economy.   The production responsibility system of linking remuneration
 to output which is clear in regard to responsibility, simple and convenient
 to calculate, and easy to supervise is a good form of socialist operation
 and management, which is suited to the rural reality at the present stage.
 It is also a good form of implementing the socialist principle of distribu-
 tion according to work.  Exploratory reforms have begun to be carried out in
 industry, communications, finance and commerce under the prerequisite that
 they should be subject to and serve the readjustment.  Marked achievements
 have been made in the experimental work of expanding the decisionmaking
 power of enterprises and implementing the forms of the economic responsi-
 bility system.                     All this has initially and forcefully shown that this form
 of management is a good form of socialist management.  In socialist rela-
 tions, the individual interests and those of the collective are integrated.
 This is the essential basic feature which distinguishes socialism from any
 society based on the system of private ownership and whose interests are
 antagonistic.   "Socialism integrates individual interests with those of the
 collective instead of denying the former."   ("Selected Works of Stalin,"
 Vol 2, p 355)   The whole problem lies in into what forms we can properly
 integrate the two.   (The interests of the collective we refer to here
 include the interests of the state.   The interests of the state are first
 and foremost.)  Only in socialist practice can this problem be solved.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the explora-
 tion and efforts we have made in improving the socialist forms of management
 and of distribution have been aimed, essentially, at seeking specific forms
 suited to the characteristics of the different regions, trades and depart-
 ments.   They are aimed at properly integrating individual interests with the
 interests of the collective and the state and fully arousing the enthusiasm
 of all laborers for socialism.  Practice has proved that our efforts have
 produced remarkable successes.  Over the past 3 years, production has
 steadily developed; the economic results have gradually improved; an all-
 round increase in agricultural output has been achieved; market prosperity
 has been promoted; and some improvements in the people's livelihood have
 been obtained.   Thus bright prospects are emerging.   Our socialist system
 is gradually improving and developing.   The argument for the whole society

 owning all means of production and which excludes production and exchange
 of commodities is completely wrong.  The overcentralized form of management
 which justifiably existed in a certain historical stage, but which now is
 not suited to the new situation as a fixed pattern of and absolute criterion
 for the socialist society (a commonly used or popular expression is the so-
 called "the larger the scale and the higher the level of public ownership
 of the means of production and the more unified the operation and manage-
 ment, the better")  and uses it to rule the socialist form created by the
 industrial and agricultural laborers in their hundreds and millions in the
 new socialist practice and denounces the socialist form as "retrogression"
 and even as "capitalist restoration" is also completely wrong.  The
 restructuring of the economic system, which we have initially begun to
 carry out and will continue to substantially and steadily carry out, will
 be another extensive and profound change in China's social and economic
 relations.  This follows the basic completion of the socialist transforma-
 tion of private ownership of the means of production.  As a result of this,
 our socialist economic system has become more perfect and our socialist
 society has become increasingly mature.  Our highly developed material and
 spiritual civilizations will certainly emerge.  China's socialist society
 will inevitably stand erect before the world with a much more majestic and
 magnificent image.

 IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UPHOLD THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MARX' THEORY OF
 REPRODUCTION--PART TWO
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 32-36
 [Article by Deng Liqun [6772 0550 5028]]
 [Text]   II.  Harmonious Correlation Between the Two Major Categories Is the
 Basic Prerequisite for Normal Reproduction of Society
 Based on the premise of his theory of reproduction, Marx first and emphati-
 cally analyzed the conditions for realizing simple reproduction, namely,
 variable capital plus surplus value of the first sector equals constant
 capital which consists of the second group.  The formula which expresses
 this relationship is I(v + m) = IIc.   The formula I(v + m) = IIc is the
 objective law of the process of simple reproduction, which also holds true
 for reproduction in a socialist society.  While studying the problem of
 reproduction in our society, we must divide the total output of society into
 the two major categories of means of production and means of consumption and
 by value divide it into. three component parts, that is, c, v and m.  In a
 socialist economy, there is no more surplus value, but surplus labor and
 surplus product remain.   C represents the replacement of the machinery,
 equipment, raw materials and other means of production worn out or used up
 in the course of production; v + m represents the new value created by work-
 ers in the course of production.  V is used to maintain workers' living
 standards, ensuring simple reproduction of labor.   Under the conditions of
 expanded reproduction, a part of m has to be retained for accumulation
 while under the conditions of simple reproduction, m is entirely used for
 consumption.   In the latter case, I(v + m) = IIc is the basic condition for
 the products under the first category and the products under the second
 category to be fully and mutually exchanged.   If I(v + m) is smaller than
 ,IIc,  then a part of the means of production which has been used up and worn
 out cannot be replaced; if I(v + m) is bigger than IIc, then part of the
 products under the first category will not be saleable.
 Of course, in a capitalist country and especially in a socialist country,
 production, instead of being repeated on the existing basis year in and year
 out, is in general marked by expanded reproduction.   The condition for
 realizing expanded reproduction is that the first category which comprises
 variable capital and surplus value is bigger than the second category which

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 represents constant capital; the formula which expresses this relationship
 is I(v + m) is greater than IIc.  Only in this way is accumulation possible.
 This is what Marx meant when he said:  "In the case of production being based
 on capital growth, I(v + m) must equal IIc plus the part of surplus product
 which has formed capital and plus the additional constant capital which is
 necessary for expanded reproduction of the second category, the minimum
 expanded reproduction of the second category is the minimum actual accumula-
 tion within the first category, or the minimum indispensable for actual
 expanded reproduction."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 24,
 p 285)  But we should not treat the matter from a metaphysical viewpoint,
 regarding that v + m can be increased indefinitely relative to c,'and even
 to such an extent that the two major categories will be out of balance and
 out of proportion.  As a matter of fact, apart from the inherent limita-
 tions, the accumulation within the first category is also limited by the
 possibilities of accumulation within the second category, for "consumption
 for productive purposes is after all related to consumption of individuals"
 and the production of the means of production cannot develop in isolation
 without being coupled with the development of the production of the means
 of consumption.  In order to realize expanded reproduction, it is necessary
 to form additional means of production, but at the same time to form addi-
 tional means of consumption as well.  That is why Marx said:  "Just the first
 category must use its surplus product to provide the second category with
 additional constant capital, the second category must also provide the first
 category with additional variable capital by the same token."  (ibid., p 584)
 While talking about the necessity of increasing the variable capital under
 the second category in accordance with the additional constant capital
 originating from the part  of surplus value under the first category, Marx
 also said:  This kind of increase "has as its premise, the tendency of
 further capitalization of the reproduction of the means of production, in
 other words, the inclusion in the reproduction in the second category of an
 increase in the part of the surplus product which constitutes the necessi-
 ties of life."  (ibid., p 586)  In a word, in the course of expanded repro-
 duction,  there is a mutual relationship between the two major categories in
 respect of demand for additional products and the satisfaction of this
 demand, since these sectors are markets for each other and are conditioned
 and limited by one another.  That tells us that, in the course of economic
 construction,  the production of'the means of consumption must grow in
 accordance with the growth of the production of the means of production,
 or we should not expand the production of the means of production alone
 without expanding the production of the means of consumption.  Failing to
 grasp this point is the very course of our past ills.  At one time, we
 pursued the policy of developing heavy industry unilaterally, emphasizing
 the iron and steel industry alone and giving it top priority.  As a result,
 the two sectors were seriously out of proportion and the economic results
 of production and construction declined substantially.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, at which
 the party Central Committee laid down the eight-character policy centered
 on readjustment, we have been implementing this policy.  Especially after
 the Central Committee's working conference held at the end of 1980, this
 policy has been implemented with much greater consciousness.  Owing to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 efforts made in the past few years, the important proportionate relations
 of the national economy have really improved and some of them have remark-
 ably improved.                 In the first, place, the peasants have displayed much more
 enthusiasm.  The rural economic situation as a whole is beyond expectation,
 and even in disaster areas the situation is much better than expected.  The
 development of agriculture has resulted in a great change for the better in
 the disproportion between agriculture and industry.  The Central Committee
 is identifying the problems which still exist in the countryside and will
 solve them so as to further boost agriculture.
 Within the industrial sector, the relationship between heavy industry and
 light industry has also been becoming increasingly harmonious.  Heavy indus-
 try uses some of its own products.  For instance, coal is used for generating
 electricity and machinery is used for manufacturing machines.   But even this
 part of the means of production is in the end subject to the limitations
 imposed by the production of the means of consumption, because after all the
 production of the means of consumption needs more means of production and in
 order to satisfy this need, the production of the means of production has
 developed and will develop for the same reason.  To cite Lenin, this means:
 "The manufacturing of the means of production is not for the means of pro-
 duction itself, but for satisfying the growing demand for the means of
 production on the part of the industrial sector which manufactures the means
 of consumption."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 4, p 143)  Therefore, the
 heavy industry department must realize that although a part of its products
 is for satisfying its own needs, its products are after all to serve light
 industry and agriculture, providing them with raw materials, other input
 materials and increasingly advanced machinery and equipment.  In this way,
 the orientation of development of heavy industry will be correct.   But in
 the past, we did not do so.   Did the comrades engaging in heavy industry
 not want to serve light industry?  We cannot say this.   They did not want to
 do so, but thought in this way:  When I have developed and become stronger,
 I will give you a lot of help.   We cannot say that there is not a word of
 truth in this.   But this way of thinking does not cover all facets.   Viewing
 the matter in all its facets, we should say that heavy industry, once
 developed, will have to better serve light industry, but in the course of
 its development, heavy industry must regularly serve light industry as well.
 We must fully realize that instead of being able to develop alone, the pro-
 duction of the means of production can develop only if there exists a con-
 certed development of both the major categories; proportionate development
 means that in every production cycle, the development must be proportionate,
 instead of meaning that we may unilaterally develop one sector in a certain
 cycle and then another sector in a subsequent cycle so as to achieve an
 overall proportionate development of the two cycles.   To do this practically
 means to give up proportionate development.   If, once steel and big machines
 are available, we only think of setting up new steel works and machine-
 building factories, and often forget the objects of service while taking
 care of self-interest alone, we will fail to bring about the conditions for
 further development.  We should not go along this road again.   Light indus-
 try did not get timely help from heavy industry to improve its machinery and
 equipment, nor sufficient supplies of raw materials.   On the other hand,
 light industry got very little investment from the state and even had to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 manufacture equipment to meet its own needs.  This is in fact to shift to
 the first category a part of the materials and labor which originally
 belonged to the second category, inappropriately reducing the proportion
 of the second category.  Or it had to make do with old equipment.  As a
 result, light industry developed far more slowly than heavy industry, pro-
 vided the society with consumer products which were far below its purchasing
 power and caused light industrial products to remain unchanged for decades.
 In the last couple of years, we have given priority to developing the pro-
 duction of consumer goods while readjusting the economy and achieved great
 success.  As early as 1979, light industry developed faster than heavy
 industry and maintained a fairly high growth rate in both 1980 and 1981.
 We should say that we have all the conditions for consciously ensuring the
 harmonious development of the production of society and even of the
 national economy as a whole.  Under the capitalist system, since enterprises
 are owned by a large number of capitalists, all the connections in the field
 of production "can only be imposed on the entrepreneurs, as a blind law,
 instead of being grasped and manipulated by them collectively and rationally
 with a view. to putting the production process under their joint control."
 ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 25, p 286)  With the establish-
 ment of the socialist system of public ownership, people are in a position
 to consciously arrange their own economic life and, as long as we know the
 objective economic laws in depth and undertake economic activities according
 to these laws, we will be able to ensure that the production of our society-
 progresses harmoniously.   This is one of the major advantages resulting from
 the superiority of the socialist system.   In the past, the reproduction of
 our society became disproportionate more than once, just because we breached
 the objective law which prescribes that the two major categories must develop
 harmoniously.   Of course, we might find many reasons to account for this
 situation.  For instance, it is not so easy to know objective laws; or,
 under the present system of ownership and level of productive forces, it is
 still impossible to subject all enterprises and all products to planning,
 and so forth.   But what deserves our special attention is that we did not
 handle the relationship between proportion and speed well.  In the past, we
 held the view that proportion was not so important and that what really
 counted was speed.  Looking back, this view just inverts the relationship
 between proportion and speed.  'Take running for instance:   Only with two
 normal legs can one run and run fast; how can one run with one leg shorter
 than the other?  A man will fall if he chooses to run like that.   In 1958,
 we set high targets for the iron and steel industry, as key sector, to
 achieve, mobilizing thousands of people to go up mountains for steel and
 iron-smelting and thus caused serious disproportion in the national economy.
 In that year, the growth rate seemed to be very high, the total industrial
 and agricultural output value rising sharply by 32.2 percent from 7.9 per-
 cent the previous year.   This growth rate could of course not last for long.
 In 1961, the growth rate of the total industrial and agricultural output
 value dropped sharply by 30.9 percent with respect to 1960.  This growth
 rate again dropped by 10.1 percent with respect to 1961.   Only from 1963
 did the growth rate start rising again.   It is therefore evident that with-
 out proportionate development it is impossible to achieve high growth rates.
 Comrade Chen.Yun has said that the question of high or low growth rates is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 in fact an issue concerning the proportions of the national economy; only
 proportionate development will make higher growth rates feasible.
 Why should we readjust the national economy?  The very purpose of the read-
 justment is to bring about a national economy of better proportions and then
 to develop it more proportionately.  As everybody can see, the present
 economic situation of our country is good.  Nothing apart from the readjust-
 ment can account for this good situation.  Without the readjustment, agri-
 culture and light industry would not have developed so fast, market supplies
 would not have become so abundant and latent trouble would not have been
 eliminated.  While emphasizing that heavy industry must develop at a certain
 speed, some comrades say that only if the growth rate of the economy has
 reached a certain level, will favorable conditions for readjusting the eco-
 nomic structure and proportions emerge.  Here again, they put the cart
 before the horse.  The heavy industry output value for 1981 is expected to
 decline by about 5 percent with respect to 1980.  What are the reasons for
 this decline?  In his report on the government work to the fourth session
 of the fifth people's congress, Comrade Zhao Ziyang made an analysis,
 enumerating the following cases:  A number of heavy industrial enterprises
 have stopped producing some products in fixed supply, which are heavily
 stockpiled and consume a lot of energy; the energy thus saved can be used
 to meet the needs of light industry, therefore this measure is necessary and
 rational.   In quite a large number of enterprises which mainly served capital
 construction for a long time, production is declining owing to a reduction in
 orders for equipment and other means of production from the sector of capital
 construction, the amount of investment in which has been largely reduced
 this year; this is inevitable in the course of readjusting the orientation
 of service and the structure of products within the heavy industrial sector.
 There is a third case.   Some comrades, who, failing to sufficiently realize
 the necessity of readjusting the orientation of service and the structure
 of products of heavy industry, have not acted promptly and delayed in making
 necessary shifts in production; this has resulted in a decline in the pro-
 duction of some heavy industrial products, which should not have declined.
 This incorrect tendency should change.   Comrade Zhao has explained very
 clearly why, during the readjustment period, industry output value is
 likely to decline temporarily.   In fact, since the second half of 1981, a
 lot of work has been done in heavy industry with a view to changing its
 orientation of service, curtailing products in excessive supply and increas-
 ing products that the people need urgently for their livelihood as well as
 products for export.   This work has already produced initial results.   On
 the other hand, the production of heavy industry started rising again in
 the fourth quarter of 1981.   If we had acted as some comrades advocate,
 striving to achieve higher growth rates for heavy industry alone while
 refusing to carry out further readjustment, what would have been the
 results?  More products in ample supply would have been stockpiled and
 products for which nobody places orders would have been manufactured as
 before.  This would not only have wasted labor and materials, but would in
 the end have again made the two sectors which were being geared to harmoni-
 ous correlation, disproportionate.

 In order to ensure that the production of society can develop harmoniously,
 we should also pay special attention to the handling of the relationships
 between the planned economy and regulation by market mechanism.  The estab-
 lishment of public ownership enables the people to handle their own economic
 relations and consciously carry out economic activities according to a uni-
 fied plan for the society.  But given the present level of productive forces
 and the present state of ownership in our country, instead of unifying all
 the economic activities, the state plan can only cover the major sectors of
 production and circulation.
 At the working conference of the Central Committee held in April 1979, it
 was suggested that in our national economy as a whole, we may act according
 to the principle of combining planned regulation and regulation by market
 mechanism, mainly relying on planned regulation while giving due considera-
 tion to the functions of regulation by market mechanism.  In fact, the
 matter had been deliberated for quite a long time before the working con-
 ference.   The comrades taking part in the deliberations and discussions all
 approved this proposal as a principle.  On 12 March of the same year, at the
 first seminar on business administration held by the State Economic Commis-
 sion, I delivered a speech.  Pointing to the past deficiencies which consist
 of overconcentration of power, overcomprehensive planning and lack of
 flexibility, and in the light of the principle deliberated upon before the
 Central Committee's working conference, I mentioned two possible ways of
 regulating the national economy saying that:   "The production and construc-
 tion sectors which are indispensable to the society and are of vital impor-
 tance to the national economy and people's livelihood must be strictly sub-
 ject to planned regulation, while the remaining sectors are to be regulated
 by market forces."  On 27 August of the same year, in my speech to the par-
 ticipants of the third seminar I again mentioned that combining planned
 regulation and regulation by market mechanism was a new proposal insofar as
 its formulation was concerned; but as regards the way of doing things, it
 was not unfamiliar to the comrades who had been doing economic work for a
 fairly long period of time.  When Comrade Chen Yun was in charge of all the
 economic work of our country, we worked exactly in this way.  In the same
 speech, I suggested that we should again seriously study the speech that
 Comrade Chen Yun made at the eighth party congress, especially the well-
 known part revealing how Comrade Chen Yun envisaged the pattern of our
 socialist economy, which included:   "Planned production constitutes the body
 of our industrial and agricultural production, and free production which
 operates in accordance with market trends and within the limits allowed by
 the state plan is complementary to planned production." I also mentioned:
 "We have been doing economic work first this way then that way.   But it
 appears that we must again go along the road suggested by Comrade Chen Yun
 many years ago."
 In the two speeches, I also touched on another issue:   Since our production
 as a whole is commodity production, we have to decide, both for the sectors
 subject to planned regulation and the sectors subject to regulation by
 market mechanism, whether a production unit should have power and how much
 power it should have.  In order to engage in commodity production, we must
 admit that the law of value performs a regulating function in the production

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 field, admit that enterprises should have various degrees of autonomy within
 the framework of the state plan, and admit that they may have, to various
 degrees, their own material interests.  That is, we must admit that they are
 commodity producers enjoying relative independence.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, pursuant
 to the policies of the party Central Committee, we have implemented many
 forms of the production responsibility system.  In the cities, a number of
 enterprises have been given greater autonomy on an experimental basis, the
 collective economy has been greatly boosted while the individual economy
 has been suitably developed; and the financial system has undergone its
 first reforms.  All this work has contributed remarkably to boosting the
 industrial and agricultural production and the whole national economy of
 our country.   During this period good experience was acquired while many
 new problems, which have to be solved in earnest, cropped up.  This period
 has also provided us with the possibility of finding a more scientific
 solution to the problem of a planned economy which also has regulation by
 market mechanism.  The Central Committee's working conference held in
 December 1980 resolved to adopt an important policy:  on the political side,
 to enhance stability and on the economic side, to pursue readjustment.   The
 "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" passed by the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP
 Central Committee summarizes the experience we have gained from practice
 since the founding of our country, especially since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CCP Central Committee.  As regards planned economy and regula-
 tion by market mechanism, Comrade Chen Yun suggested during the discussions
 that the formulation in the draft resolution should be amended to "it is
 necessary to realize a planned economy on the basis of public. ownership and
 at the same time make use of the market as an auxiliary regulating instru-
 ment."  He also told the comrades drawing up the draft that we needed to
 bring about a brisk economy but we should be careful not to forget the
 planned economy while doing this.  At a meeting of the party's first secre-
 taries at provincial, municipal and autonomous regional levels held in
 December 1981, and in his talk with the comrades in charge of the State
 Planning Commission during this year's Spring Festival, Comrade Chen Yun
 again emphasized that both in industrial production and in agricultural pro-
 duction, we should uphold the basic principle of letting the planned economy
 play the principal role and letting regulation by market mechanism play an
 auxiliary role.  Whether in construction and life or in accumulation and
 consumption, we should act according to plan.   Facts have proved that, in
 comparison with the formulation of 1979, Comrade Chen Yun's suggestions and
 opinions, which have obtained the unanimous approval of all the top-ranking
 members of the Central Committee, better suit the socialist economy of our
 country and can better ensure that our economy will develop in the direction
 of socialism.   This is a basic principle that we must uphold from now on.
 In his report on government work, Comrade Zhao Ziyang gave good play to this
 important principle laid down in the "resolution."  He divided enterprises
 and products into four types and put forward four different management
 methods as well.   The first type comprises the key enterprises which are of
 vital importance to the national economy and the major products indispensable
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100260001-9
 to the people's livelihood, and production of this type of product should
 follow the state's instructive plans; the second type comprises a large
 variety of small commodities, the production of which is scattered among
 many small enterprises and individual workers.  For this type, production
 may take place according to market trends and within the limits allowed by
 the state plan.  Between these two types, there are another two types of
 enterprises and products.  For one of the two types, the major part of the
 production should be carried out according to the state plan while a small
 part can be organized by enterprises themselves; for the other type, the
 major part of the production is to be organized by enterprises in accordance
 with market trends while a small part should be carried out according to the
 state plan.   The products mentioned here cover not only industrial products,
 but also agricultural products.  For agricultural products, planned produc-
 tion should also play the principal role while free production may play an
 auxiliary role.  Of course, the classification put forward by Comrade Zhao
 Ziyang needs to be elaborated if we are to apply it to practical work.  For
 instance, what kinds of enterprises are key enterprises of vital importance
 to the national economy; what kinds of products are indispensable to the
 people's livelihood and what kinds of products are small commodities; how
 do we ensure that production carried out according to market trends will
 not exceed the scope allowed by the state plan, and so on.
 Comrade Zhao Ziyang has said that the above-mentioned management system
 differs "both'from our past system, which was overcentralized, and from the
 market economy of the capitalist society.  It enables us to combine
 centralized and unified leadership by the state with an enterprise's initia-
 tive, really succeed in bringing about an economy which is kept under con-
 trol without being irresponsive; which is brisk without being confused.  Thus
 we may raise economic efficiency and organize and develop production accord-
 ing to the needs of society."  In the past, we tried to put everything under
 state planning.  As a result, on the one hand, our planning lost its scien-
 tific nature because we attempted to do the impossible and our economy was
 very irresponsive.   On the other hand, things which could have been done were
 not done well, with the result that the national economy was only semiplanned
 most of the time.   Why did our national economy become disproportional more
 than once?  Although errors in policymaking were the main reasons, we must
 realize that overcentralization of our planning and management system was
 also a direct cause.
 We must get rid of this cause of economic ills while reforming our system.
 But the purpose in getting rid of this cause is to strengthen the planned
 economy, rather than weaken it.   Some comrades have criticized the view that
 only mandatory targets assigned by the state are of a socialist planned
 economic nature.  Therefore, these comrades have advocated abolishing manda-
 tory plans.  It is necessary to make an analysis of how correct this criti-
 cism is.   It does not seem wrong to regard mandatory plans as the basic
 characteristic marking the socialist planned economy.  A planned economy
 means nothing other than a national economy consciously managed by society
 according to plans set down beforehand.  This kind of economy is bound to
 appear in order to meet the objective demands of a society in which all the

 which labor is joint labor within the scope of the entire society.  Under
 these conditions, the society (represented by the state or economic centers)
 is the owner of all the production units, which should carry out production
 and management according to a unified plan drawn up by society.  Does our
 country have conditions for realizing a planned economy?  Yes.   Management
 by the state of the enterprises which are of vital importance to the national
 economy, control by the state of the products indispensable to the people's
 livelihood and mandatory plans imposed on this part of production, which
 takes up most of our total industrial and agricultural output value, prove
 that our economy is basically a planned economy.  Abolishing mandatory plans
 can at best coordinate, only to a certain degree, the production and
 activities of various enterprises as the capitalist countries do by their
 planning.  This kind of "planning" cannot prevent the production of society
 from falling into a state of anarchy and therefore is by its nature totally
 different from our planned economy.
 In order to ensure harmonious development of the national economy, it is
 necessary to make planning more scientific.   The socialist economy can
 develop according to plan and must develop according to plan.  But this is
 possible only if there are plans elaborated by the state which satisfy the
 demands of objective laws..  Therefore, working out state plans on a scien-
 tific basis is an important condition for the development of the socialist
 economy.  What about our past.planning?  We cannot say that it satisfied
 none of the demands of objective laws; neither can we say that it satisfied
 all the demands of objective laws.   As a matter of fact, fairly often it did
 not satisfy many demands of objective laws.  Without highly scientific plan-
 ning, it is .quite unlikely that we can ensure that the two production sectors
 of society and the various national economic sectors will be in good propor-
 tion to each other, and.it is quite unlikely that the economy will develop
 without a hitch.   In cases where plans depart greatly from scientific
 criteria,  they cannot be implemented and therefore come to nothing.   Since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP-Central Committee, just. like what has
 happened in the whole national economy, we have greatly cultivated a realistic
 style of work in our planning work and the planning methods have also
 improved greatly.   In future, we must keep working in this way so as to
 strengthen the planned economy and better bring into play the superiority
 of the socialist economy.   Some comrades have confused planning work with
 the planned economy, doubted the superiority of the planned economy for
 finding errors in our past planning work, and some others have even denied
 the value of the planned economy.  These views are wrong.

 INTRODUCING 'A STUDY OF PROBLEMS IN CHINA'S SOCIALIST ECONOMY'
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 37-39, 44
 [Book review by Su Xing [5685 2502]]
 [Text] Comrade Xue Muqiao's book "A Study of Problems in China's Socialist
 Economy" probes into the economic laws of socialism and is based on the
 actual conditions of socialist construction in our country.   Because I and
 several comrades took part in the discussions and revisions on the original
 manuscript, we wish here to introduce the book briefly to our readers.
 I.  Probing Into the Economic Laws of Socialism Through Summarizing Past
 Experiences
 Comrade Xue Muqiao is an economist who has spent many years on practical
 economic work and who has engaged in rather extensive research on economic
 theories.  In the preface to the book "A Study of Problems in China's
 Socialist Economy," he told why he abandoned his plan to write a textbook
 and wrote this book instead.  He gave two reasons for doing so:  1) The
 development of the socialist economy of our country has not yet reached the
 mature stage and an integrated theoretical system is difficult to create.
 2) He has had more than 30 years of practical work in economics and had
 gained some understanding.  He wished to make use of his later years to
 point out several problems in the actual practice of socialist economic
 construction which he thought should be immediately explored and solved in
 order to serve as references for theoretical workers and practical workers
 in the field of economics.  These are precisely his book's special and
 superior points.   It also explains why, although this book lacks an organized
 or close-knit theoretical system or background, it is well liked by all
 theoretical workers and practical workers in economics, including some
 foreign readers abroad.
 In the history of mankind, a socialist society is a new social system.  After
 making an analysis of the capitalist system by means of dialectical material-
 ism and historical materialism and taking into account the direction of
 development of society following the collapse of capitalism, Marx and Engels
 foresaw a basic trend for the development of a socialist society.  However,
 because there were no socialist countries in existence in their time, we
 cannot and should not, expect them to offer any systematic dissertation on

 the economic laws of socialism.  Lenin led Russia's working class and other
 working people to establish the world's first socialist republic.  It was
 through them that millions of people began practicing socialism.  Soon after
 the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin pointed out:   "So far as Russia
 is concerned, the time has passed for the academic discussion of the prin-
 ciples of socialism.  I firmly believe that it will never return.                  Today is
 the opportune time to talk about socialism on the basis of experience."
 ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 27, p 480)  In my understanding, discussing
 socialism on the basis of experience should include the exploration of the
 contents of the economic laws of socialism by means of summarizing past
 experiences.  In this connection, Lenin himself set an example.  Take, for
 example, the questions of commodities and money:  Marx and Engels predicted
 that under socialism, commodities and money would not exist.  Yet after the
 October Revolution, Lenin never advocated the immediate abolition of com-
 modities and money.  During the period of wartime communism, there was an
 attempt to probe into avenues of socialist production and distribution which
 excluded the circulation of commodities, but this exploration was soon given
 up and "state capitalism was changed into state-regulated commerce and
 currency circulation."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 33, p 73)  This
 represented a big evolution both in theory and in practice.  It was a break-
 through'in what had been foreseen by Marx and Engels'.  In fact, a new under-
 standing was thus derived from the actual practice of socialism in Russia.
 This was that during the course of socialist construction, commodities and
 currency must necessarily be retained and commerce must also be retained.
 This represented one-of Lenin's important contributions to Marxist political
 economics.
 Despite the short length of time of socialist construction in our country,
 valuable experiences have been gained.  Comrade Mao Zedong's economic publi-
 cations, Comrade Chen Yun's economic writings, and Comrade Zhao Ziyang's 10
 guidelines on economic construction which he advocated in the government work
 report made at the 4th Session of the 5th NPC were all produced on the basis
 of the summarization of experiences in economic construction in our country.
 They reflected from various angles the nature of socialist economic laws.
 In summarizing experiences, we should summarize both their positive and
 negative sides.   Generally speaking, if mankind's actions conform with
 objective laws and ultimately meet with success, then they are said to be
 positive experiences.   On the contrary, if mankind's actions violate objec-
 tive laws and end in failure, then the experiences gained can be said to be
 negative.  When talking to some Soviet economists in February 1952, Stalin
 mentioned the view that, generally speaking, the working of all these laws
 could be perceived only when they were violated, and when they were violated,
 harm could not be avoided.  Here, Stalin was emphasizing the negative experi-
 ences and overlooking the positive ones.  As a matter of fact, when mankind's
 actions conform with the objective laws, the working of the laws can simi-
 larly be observed.  This book is replete with instances of this kind.  Such
 examples as the stabilization of commodity prices and the socialist conver-
 sion of the system of private ownership of the means of production in the
 1950's and the economic readjustment of the national economy in the 1960's
 all conformed with economic laws and were positive experiences.

 Does this mean that economic laws can be discovered merely by summarizing
 experiences?  Not exactly.  Laws are the essence of phenomena.  They are
 "something solidified (preserved) in phenomena."  ("Collected Works of Lenin,"
 Vol 38, p 158)  They cannot be discovered easily.  We must go through prac-
 tice and understanding, further practice and further understanding, and
 repeat this process many times, so that perceptual knowledge is upgraded to
 rational knowledge, in order to discover the essence of things and their
 inner relationships.
 II.  Proceeding From Reality, Pay Special Attention To Studying How Economic
 Laws Operate Under China's Historical Conditions
 Chapter one of this book is entitled "Socialist Revolution and Socialist
 Construction in Our Country."  Originally, there was no such chapter and
 chapter one comprised the present concluding observations.  However, the
 author felt that the structure of this book should be based on actual con-
 ditions and not merely on laws.  Hence, he rewrote this chapter and made it
 chapter one.   This shows another feature of this book, namely, that it pro-
 ceeds from reality and pays attention to the study of how economic laws
 operate under China's historical conditions.
 At the time of the revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong remarked that in
 order to win the war, not only should the laws governing wars in general be
 studied, but the laws governing special revolutionary wars and, in particu-
 lar, the laws governing China's special revolutionary war should be studied.
 Just as in studying the laws governing wars, in attempting now to build a
 modern and powerful socialist country, we must study not only economic laws
 in general, but also special socialist economic laws, and, in particular,
 special socialist economic laws as manifested under China's historical con-
 ditions.
 Take, for example, the law of production relationships conforming with the
 nature of the productive forces.  This is a common economic law applicable
 to various production forms.  It operates differently in different produc-
 tion forms.   In analyzing the contradiction between production relationships
 and the productive forces under capitalism, Marx pointed out that owing to
 the socialization of production, the system of private ownership of the means
 of production must of necessity be replaced by the system of public owner-
 ship.  As for how this replacement is brought about, this differs in
 different countries.  For example, in the Soviet Union, the means of produc-
 tion owned by the capitalist class were confiscated by the state.   We con-
 fiscated a portion of these means of production (those owned by bureaucratic
 capital) and purchased a portion (those owned by the national bourgeoisie).
 As for the cooperativization of the means of production owned by the
 peasants, our method and procedure also differed substantially from those
 of the Soviet Union.   It seems that we have done slightly better in this
 regard.  As a result,  the recovery and development of our industry was
 relatively faster, while in agriculture we not only did not suffer any
 large decrease in production but production actually increased.  Unfortu-
 nately, just because of this comparatively successful accomplishment, we
 became careless after 1958, when we lopsidedly exaggerated the role played

 by the change in the ownership system in the development of the productive
 forces.  We stirred up "communist wind" and became "prone to boasting and
 exaggeration."  Instead of developing the productive forces, we damaged them.
 In chapter one of this book, the author makes an analysis of the special con-
 ditions for socialist revolution in our country.  He wrote:  "Originally in
 our country small producers commanded absolute superiority. Agricultural
 production relied principally on manual labor and retained a semiself-
 contained character.  For this reason, the development of our socialist
 economy must be based on actual conditions.  We must skillfully combine
 principle and flexibility.  We should not be bound by existing conclusions
 or adopt in wholesale fashion the patterns already shaped by Marx, Engels,
 Lenin or Stalin."  This point has an important bearing on understanding the
 nature of the society in our country at present.  We cannot take as our
 pattern what Marx conceived of socialism in his "Critique of the Gotha
 Program" and take for granted that any form at variance with this pattern
 cannot be considered a socialist society.   For some time to come in our coun-
 try, varying economic forms will continue to exist, but since the public
 ownership system has already become the principal system of ownership of the
 means of production, this type of society should be classified as a socialist
 society.   In the "postscript," the author states:   "Historically, since primi-
 tive society there has never existed a social structure which has a so-called
 pure and unadulterated composition....   Up to the present, even in the highly
 developed capitalist countries, a large number of small producers still exist.
 People do not refute their capitalist status on account of their 'impure'
 composition.  Why must socialist countries be 'pure' and 'double pure'?"
 What he said was reasonable.
 III.   Progress While Exploring
 In the "final notes" of this book, the author introduces two different views
 by certain comrades concerning the time of the book's publication.   One view
 is as follows:   Since the discussions  began on practice being. the sole
 criterion for determining truth, in the theoretical field many new problems
 have arisen.   Comrades engaged in economic work are still discussing the
 problems of readjusting the national economic and restructuring the economic
 management system.   A hundred schools of thought presently contend.   Many
 problems have not yet been resolved.   It would be best to wait a while and
 watch for the conclusion of the discussions before making the manuscript
 final.   The other viewpoint is this:  The discussions on theory and practice
 will last for a long time and restructuring cannot be accomplished within 1
 or 2 years.  Why not take part in the discussions as "one school of thought"?
 Certain errors cannot be avoided but greater service can still be rendered
 to actual work.  Following deliberations, the author decided in favor of
 the latter view.   The attitude that the author assumed was down to earth.
 This is first because socialism, as a new social system, has not yet attained
 maturity.   We cannot expect a mature volume to be written on a still immature
 system.   Second, this is because we are still acquiring an understanding of
 the economic laws of socialism.  Apart from us, other socialist countries are
 still acquiring such an understanding.   It is impossible to expect every
 viewpoint to be comprehensive and correct.  While exploring,, mistakes are

 This book
 contains theoretical viewpoints of an exploratory nature.  They
 are what
 the author himself calls viewpoints "belonging to one school of
 thought."
 For
 example, the idea that the productive forces should in part
 belong to
 the
 individual occupies a rather prominent position throughout the
 volume.
 Some
 comrades agree with this view, some do not.  His analysis of
 the reasons for the existence of commodities in a socialist society is
 agreed with by some people but disagreed with by other people.  The author
 refuted the idea that renminbi could take the place of gold.  He advocated
 that the standard for measuring the value of money should not be the price
 of one commodity such as gold but rather the composite price of a number
 of products (composite price index).  He thought that this should be the
 new development of the currency system, but some people disagreed.   Con-
 cerning these problems, the author stated the following in the "postscript"
 to his book:   "For many years opinions on some theoretical problems (such
 as whether the productive forces should in part belong to individual labor-
 ers and whether the renminbi should take the place of gold) have differed
 among the academic circles in our country and abroad.   On these problems I
 maintain my original views.   But I am willing to follow the principle of
 letting a hundred schools of thought contend and to continue the discussions
 with comrades in the academic circles."  Hence, when learning from this book
 we must also have an exploratory spirit.  The existence of disparity in
 scholastic viewpoints does not hamper our understanding of the socialist
 economic laws.   On the contrary, the controversies between divergent
 viewpoints can possibly enable our understanding to approach the truth
 more rapidly.
 The book was published more than 2 years ago.  Looking at it in the spirit
 of the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, it seems that
 there is nothing wrong with its basic direction.  However, there are certain
 defects and deficiencies and the presentation on certain problems was not
 comprehensive enough.  Accordingly, last year the author wrote a "post-
 script" which touched on three problems.  The first problem concerned the
 concrete forms of socialist production relations.  On the basis of the spirit
 of the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC," he discussed the concrete forms of the production rela-
 tions at the present stage in our country.  He also made certain revisions
 and supplements with regard to the following two topics:
 One topic was the agricultural production responsibility system.   The origi-
 nal text touched on this topic rather casually, and on the question of
 assigning farm output quotas to each household it appeared to have been
 somewhat restricted by the viewpoints that had been in circulation in the
 last few years.  The "postscript" made a rather clear presentation of the
 various forms of the agricultural production responsibility system.  The
 other topic was the alteration of a former viewpoint which had emphasized
 that development of the collective ownership system must follow the procedure
 of a transition from ownership by the production team to ownership by the
 production brigade, and then to ownership by the people's commune.  It was

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 clearly pointed out that in some cases the development of the collective
 ownership system in the countryside could take the transitional procedure
 of going from small collectives to large collectives, but that in other
 cases this procedure need not be followed and that various new combination
 forms may be adopted.  The second problem related to planned economy and
 market regulation.  The reason why in the "postscript" the author took pains
 to dwell on this problem was that, for a period of time, in academic circles
 the discussion of combined planned regulation and market regulation was rather
 prevalent.   (In this book the author himself refers frequently to this topic.)
 But this presentation is not exactly correct, because it places planning and
 market regulation in opposition to each other.   The "resolution" did not put
 it this way.  What it stated was:  "The planned economy must be implemented
 on the basis of the public ownership system; at the same time the supple-
 mentary role of market regulation must be brought into full play."  This
 version first of all affirms that the socialist economy is a planned economy
 and at the same time brings into full play the supplementary role of market
 regulation.   It is more correct and conforms with China's realities.   The
 third problem touches on readjustment and restructuring.   Efforts are made
 in this to alleviate certain skepticism expressed abroad (and within the
 country) concerning the readjustment of the national economy in our country.
 In reading this book the readers, if interested, should also read this

 WHAT IS MEANT BY SMUGGLING AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO CRACK DOWN ON SMUGGLING?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 40-41
 [Article by Xi Wen [0823 5113] in "Question and Answer" column]
 [Text]  Answer:  Smuggling is an illegal economic activity.  It generally
 refers to the act of violating the stipulated laws of the state and illegally
 transporting goods for import or export.  Since the appearance of inter-
 national trade in the world and the imposition of restrictions on such trade,
 smuggling has become a universal phenomenon in various countries and regions.
 Smuggling is not allowed by any sovereign state.   Ours is a socialist coun-
 try.  Smuggling is all the more.not allowed.  The "tentative customs laws of
 the People's Republic of China" and the "penal code of the PRC" clearly say
 that smuggling is an illegal act of upsetting socialist economic order and
 impairing state interests.   Smuggling in serious cases is an offense accord-
 ing to criminal law.  According to these prescribed laws, all such activities
 as illegally transporting, carrying or mailing goods, silver and gold, cur-
 rency, bills, negotiable securities and other commodities across the border
 in violation of state regulations governing foreign trade, imports and
 exports and customs duties are in the category of smuggling--activities
 prompted by attempts to escape customs inspection, illegal foreign exchange
 trading, and evasion of customs duties.  Those who engage in smuggling and
 illegal trading are subjected to economic sanctions and are even punishable
 in accordance with criminal law.
 For a socialist country like ours which lacks a high level of economic
 development, cracking down on smuggling is of especially great significance.
 At present, the prices of certain consumer goods in our country, such as
 wristwatches, radio-tape recorders, television sets, chemical fiber products,
 and so forth are much higher than those abroad.   Meanwhile, the prices of
 gold and silver, jewels, rare medicinal herbs, cultural relics and curios
 are much lower than those abroad.  These price differences constitute a
 great economic stimulation to smuggling.   Since the founding of the state,
 smuggling has waxed and waned and has sometimes reached quite serious pro-
 portions.   In the past few years, our country has carried out an open-door
 policy. This helps to attract foreign capital, equipment and technology and
 accelerates the readjustment of the national economy and socialist moderniza-
 tion.  In the future, we must persist in carrying out this policy.  Mean-
 while, the international bourgeoisie and the smuggling rings based in Hong

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Kong, Macao and other areas have also seized this opportunity to exploit
 any loophole that has appeared in certain aspects of our controls.  They
 have acted in collusion with lawbreakers at home and practiced smuggling in
 a big way. Certain people of some enterprises, undertakings serving the
 people, organs, public bodies and rural communes and brigades in our coun-
 try, including an extremely small number of leading cadres, have thrown
 party discipline and state laws to the winds, and relied on their authority
 and on state and collective funds to carry out smuggling and illegal trading.
 They have promoted bourgeois liberalization in the economic area.   This
 upsurge in smuggling and illegal trading has done harm to the state and
 society in many respects.  Smugglers have violated our regulations governing
 foreign trade and imports and exports and have secretly brought in large
 supplies of consumer goods not needed as imports by the state, including
 second-grade and slipshod goods and imitations.  On the other hand, they
 have smuggled out the state's valuable products and rare commodities in
 large quantities, or have engaged in illegal foreign exchange trading.   They
 have thus avoided paying large sums in customs duties and industrial.and
 commercial taxes.   This has resulted in tremendous economic losses to the
 state.  Smuggling has interfered with our industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction and hampered the development of our relevant national industries.
 Smuggling and illegal trading have given rise to many other illegal and
 criminal activities and disrupted peace and social order.  In a small number
 of coastal areas where smuggling is rampant, the number of cases of gambling,
 robbery, theft, fraud, bribery, fighting, beating, murder, and so forth have
 risen sharply.  Smuggling has had a corrosive effect on the cadres and the
 masses and has corrupted social morals.  Driven by a desire for exorbitant
 profits, some people have fallen prey to bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and
 stepped on the criminal path.  There are still more people who have illegally
 bought smuggled goods as bargain hunters.
 From this, it can be seen that smuggling and illegal trading are downright
 criminal activities that are the scourge of the country and the curse of the
 people.  The struggle between smuggling and antismuggling forces is one
 between bourgeois corrosive and socialist anticorrosive forces.   This strug-
 gle is not only a serious economic struggle but also a serious political
 struggle.   Our country follows an open-door policy in a long-term guideline
 that cannot be changed.   But we must guard against attendant negative influ-
 ences.  We must take note that though the exploiting class in our country
 has been eliminated, its influence has still not been eliminated.   The
 international bourgeoisie is invading and corrupting our revolutionary ranks
 in the political, economic, ideological and other areas.   Under this situa-
 tion, if we cannot keep a clear head and take a firm stand in consciously
 resisting such intruding and corrosive forces and waging a resolute struggle
 against smuggling, illegal trading and other crimes in the economic field,
 this will be an open invitation to the dumping of commercial goods by the
 capitalist world.   This will weaken the revolutionary will of our ranks,
 disrupt the political situation of stability and unity in our country and
 affect the consolidation of the socialist system.
 Cracking down on smuggling, illegal trading and other criminal activities
 in the economic field is one of the central problems that the party is

 determined to tackle with intensified efforts this year.  This also repre-
 sents an important measure to achieve a decisive change for the better in
 the party's style and the social style this year.  We must have thorough
 understanding of the serious harm which smuggling and illegal trading
 present to the party and the state, and persevere in fighting these criminal
 activities, in order to better implement the open-door guideline in the
 economic area and ensure the smooth progress of economic readjustment and
 modernization.

 CADRES SHOULD BE TESTED ON THEIR THEORETICAL STUDY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 p 41
 [Selected letters from readers]
 [Text] Theoretical study by cadres has been gradually stepped up since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.  Considerable achieve-
 ments have been made in this study as the units and individuals that have
 made good results in their study have continued to increase in number.  But
 the progress is unbalanced; some units have let theoretical study drift, and
 they think that it makes no difference whether anyone studies or not and
 whether there are many or few people who take part in the study.  Some other
 units that formulated plans for this study have taken a perfunctory atti-
 tude and consequently made no achievements.  They considered such study as
 an important matter when they were mobilizing cadres to take part in the
 study, but they did not make proper arrangements and reduced the importance
 of the study in their actual work.
 I think that to change this situation, it is necessary to step up education
 on the importance of this study, and what is more important is to establish
 an examination system for theoretical study.   It is necessary to proceed
 from specific conditions and, define the contents and requirements in the
 study and formulate related rules and regulations and a system.  Like
 cultural and technical study, the achievements in theoretical study must
 also be considered as a criterion for testing, appraising, promoting and
 selecting good cadres.   Study achievements must be appraised according to
 reality, and it is necessary to stress the importance of linking theory
 with practice and not just repeating statements.  It is also imperative to
 produce research materials to enhance the study.
 (Jia Jiajin [6328 1367 3866] of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region branch
 of the Agricultural Bank of China)
 I suggest setting up an examination system for cadres'  theoretical study,
 that advanced units and individuals be awarded, and that the attitude that
 it makes no difference whether to study or not and whether there are many
 or few people taking part in the study be changed.   Following completion in
 the study of each subject or in a certain stage of the study, it is impera-

 examinations, with topics unifiedly defined and examination papers unifiedly
 checked.  The results of examinations must be announced and included in the
 cadres' records.  Those who have completed their study with good results
 must be awarded and given certificates and their study taken into account.
 Those who fail to meet the requirements must continue their study, and they
 will be permitted to move on to study the next subject only after they have
 met the requirements.  The examinations must be based on high standards and
 strict demands; there should not be a perfunctory approach to them.
 The cadres' theoretical study must be combined with their appointments, and
 their promotions must be based on the results of their study.  All leading
 departments concerned must every year conscientiously check on the study of
 their cadres.  In appointing cadres, these departments must regard the
 study of their cadres as an important content for deciding whether the
 cadres are competent.  Those with excellent study results must be promoted.
 (Li Guoyan [2621 0948 2513] of the Propaganda Department of Tangshan Prefec-
 tural CCP Committee, Hebei Province)
 By the end of 1981, the Propaganda Department of the Yiyang Prefectural CCP
 Committee, Hunan Province, and various propaganda departments of the party
 committees and municipal party committees under the prefectural party com-
 mittee conducted an examination of all their cadres on the "Resolution on
 Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the
 PRC."  The examinations won active support from the leadership at various
 levels and the broad masses of cadres.  They considered the examinations as
 a good opportunity for testing and improving their theoretical standard.
 With enthusiasm, they took the examinations and there were many moving deeds.
 We found through the examinations that cadres' theoretical study must be
 carried out in a planned way and that it is necessary to give cadres coaching
 and establish an examination system.   In fact, such measures are not new.
 During the early 1950's, there existed a complete examination system for
 cadres' theoretical study, but it was later misunderstood as "stressing
 application" and it was spoiled by Lin Biao and the "gang of four."  Conse-
 quently, this effective method was abandoned.   Also in the past we worked
 on planning for cadres' theoretical study.  Much coaching was given and many
 reference materials were printed, and yet cadres were not enthusiastic about
 study.  There even appeared a situation of letting the study drift.  All this
 also contributed to the abolishing of the examination system.  We hold that
 examination is an indispensable link in this study because it not only checks
 the results of study but promotes it.  Recently, we conscientiously summed
 up the experiences and lessons in giving examinations and we have decided to
 continue the examination system and work to perfect it.

 A NEW DISCOVERY IN SUBJECT MATTER FOR FILM PRODUCTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 42-44
 [Article by Chen Bo [7115 2330]]
 [Text]  The film "The Herdsman", has been much talked about recently by many
 people. on the ideological front, particularly film, literary and news
 circles.  They have praised it as a good film.  Why does this film have such
 extraordinary artistic power as to be warmly welcomed by the people and to
 .draw their praise?  It is because, with realistic images, this film is able
 to grip the vast movie-going public.  With poignant artistic scenes, the
 film vividly summarizes and portrays the conflict and contradictions of two
 different destinies, two different prospects, and two different ethical
 ideologies and world outlooks.
 Xu Lingjun, the protagonist of the film, is an intellectual who was wrongly
 labeled a rightist.  He is a primary school teacher on the grassland.  His
 father, Xu Jingyou, the chairman of a big company, returns home from abroad
 .and asks Xu Lingjun to follow him by entering the family's bourgeois busi-
 ness abroad, but he resolutely turns down the offer.   Xu Lingjun is able to
 do so because he has linked his personal destiny and future with the destiny
 and prospects of his motherland.  Consequently, his socialist ideology of
 loving his motherland overcomes his father's capitalist ideology of wanting'
 his son to "follow in his footsteps" and to engage in an adventurous career
 by severing his fate and future from that of the motherland.  The struggle
 between the two different destinies and prospects and the ideological
 struggle are the theme of the film.
 Following is some of the dialogue between the father and the son in a Beijing
 hotel:
 Father:   "The,San Francisco Chemical Company. in the United States is my
 kingdom.   People abroad are seeking personal fame and they engage in compe-
 tition."
 Son:   "Dad, you've your own feelings about fame.   Maybe because I'm used to
 collective life that I value the fame of our country."
 'Father:   "Do you herdsmen usually read Marxist books?"

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 Son:  "These kinds of books are printed in great number in China, so we have
 the chance to read them."
 Father:  "Now people in Western countries are also studying Marxism, even
 more than in China."
 Son:  "That is right, but they are studying from books and we in China--Dad,
 please don't talk about it!"
 A moment later the father says:  "What are you thinking about?  The policies
 of the Communist Party can easily change.  Now it is easy to get an exit
 visa, but it is hard to tell what it be like in the future."  "Why is it so
 difficult for you to leave?  You've suffered enough for 20 years."
 This suffering refers to Xu Lingjun's being wrongly labeled as a rightist and
 sent to the grassland to be "reeducated through labor."  Xu Jingyou thought
 that his words would hit the open wounds of his son's soul and so he con-
 tinued his attack, saying:  "I want to raise you up and restore your value
 as a man!  I want to establish your belief!  I...."  He wanted to win over
 his son by projecting on him his own bourgeois personality and capturing
 him by using his own bourgeois ideology.
 As for Xu Lingjun, he understands through his life experiences that the true
 current, true progress and true beauty of his life all come from his mother-
 land.  He found such feelings and belief from the laboring herdsmen on the
 grassland.  Among these laboring people are Uncle Dong Kuan and his wife,
 who treated him as if he were their son, and Guo Pianzi and his wife, who
 took care of him as if they were his brother- and sister-in-law.  This is a
 new moral principle which could only have been derived in a socialist coun-
 try, and the laboring people's concern and love for an intellectual could
 only have developed in a socialist country.  This situation is beyond the
 comprehension of Xu Lingjun's capitalist father.   In particular, the film
 recalls Xu Lingjun's act of "marrying first and later falling in love" to
 vividly expound a new moral principle.  A famine-stricken girl, Li Xiuzhi,
 fled Sichuan Province and came to Xu Lingjun's house.   She could not have
 foreseen that Xu would respect and care so much about her.  Extremely moved,
 she pinned her trust, hopes and happiness on him.  This part of the story is
 unfolded exquisitely and thrillingly to present to the audience Xu Lingjun
 and Li Xiuzhi, who were strangers to each other and who in the tortuous path
 of the progress of their motherland met with misfortune, which only added
 luster to their lofty morality and beautiful souls.  On such a foundation,
 they grew to know and love one another even more deeply after they were
 married.  When they were married, their neighbors came to congratulate them.
 The herdsmen happily helped them and gave them cloth and grain coupons with-
 out leaving their names.  Such a natural expression of the lofty morality
 of the laboring people vividly demonstrates the new socialist morality and
 ethics.   This situation is in sharp contrast to the ethical standard of
 selfishness of the millionaire Xu Jingyou.  After they were married, their
 life of labor and love continued to grow; they enjoyed happiness together
 with the laboring people, and they linked the fate of their family and
 lovely son with the prospects of their motherland.   This situation is beyond

 the comprehension of Xu Jingyou and his female secretary.  The secretary was
 staggered to learn that Xu Lingjun had married first and then fallen in love,
 and that following the redressing of his case, he was willing to spread
 culture by working as a primary school teacher.  She came to realize that he
 was a man with resolute, firm and calm character.  She thought that should
 Xu Lingjun become the successor of Xu Jingyou, he would be able to win fame
 for his father, the chairman.  Consequently, she urged the chairman to grasp
 well his "investment in talent."  She considered the great socialist mother-
 land from a wrong angle; her understanding of Xu Lingjun, who had been
 nurtured by the motherland, was also wrong.  The film skillfully uses flash-
 backs to express the answers given by Xu Lingjun through his interesting
 discussion with his wife on the grassland.  What Xu Lingjun had in mind was
 expressed through the words of his wife, Li Xiuzhi:
 Xu Lingjun:  "Why?  You think I can't leave you, don't you?"
 Li Xiuzhi:  "I've no such thought.  I know that you would hate to leave the
 children in the school, the countryfolk, and Uncles Guo Pianzi and Dong.  You
 would also hate to leave that (pointing to a national map on the wall)....
 Well, you can put it in your pocket and take it along, but it's only paper.
 You can't carry Qilian Mountain, nor can you carry the grassland."
 Such is the socialist morality of Xu Lingjun and Li Xiuzhi, and it is a vivid
 display of their true souls.  The screenwriters and producers of the film
 used such vivid language to counter the intention of the chairman and his
 secretary of "investing in talent" and their ethical concept of "the son
 following in his father's footsteps."  Xu Lingjun said to his father:   "Men
 do not live just to enjoy material life"; "Our motherland is now taking the
 correct road and I'm willing to climb this slope together with the people."
 Failing to understand his son, the father asks:   "Is there such a strong
 attractive force?"  He answers with deep feelings:  "You can't but share the
 excitement of the people who witnessed their country rising above the blood
 and turbulence!"  These are not only the words of Xu Lingjun; they represent
 the feelings of the broad masses of people.
 The bourgeois mode of life is nothing but the pursuit of money, and their
 morality is to make profit and harbor egoism.  According to the bourgeoisie,
 men are always selfish; others are eliminated in competition and exploited,
 and it is justifiable to enjoy happiness from the miseries of others.   This
 is the ethical. principle of Xu Jingyou and his like.   The moral principle
 represented by Xu Lingjun and Li Xiuzhi includes ardent love for the mother-
 land and socialism, sacrificing themselves for the interest of the people,
 and their true love and support of each other.  Last year the film "House
 Full of Happiness" opened up a new world of ethical subject matter for film
 production, while this year the film "The Herdsman" resulted in a new
 development in this direction;  the film production situation is very
 encouraging.   To advocate new socialist moral principles and develop creative
 works around this theme are very important tasks for building socialist
 spiritual civilization, and such works have a wide range of content.  We must
 continue to create artistic works and make further progress!

 Some people hold that in the film "The Herdsman" the thinking and deeds of
 Xu Lingjun have been glossed over and beautified and the description has
 been "idealized."  Therefore, the film is not realistic.  By "reality" these
 people mean that Xu Lingjun must go to the United States with his father, who
 once abandoned him to enter business and become a capitalist.  Of course, we
 must understand that following the implementation of the open-door policy,
 some people who are not resolute will yearn for the bourgeois way of life
 because of the penetration and influence of capitalist ideology.  But can we
 consequently say that the man like Xu Lingjun is not true to life?  No, that
 is not so.  In fact, there are people who were wrongly labeled as rightists
 during the broad antirightist campaign and persecuted during the 10 chaotic
 years, but who have refused the invitations of foreigners to teach abroad;
 there are people who were teachers and artists in other countries but refused
 to stay abroad even though they were offered jobs with high salaries.  Some
 Overseas Chinese with particular knowledge have returned to China to live a
 hard life in order to contribute their specialized knowledge to their mother-
 land.  A girl from the rural areas was asked to stay abroad and was offered
 a high salary when she was visiting the United States to demonstrate drawn-
 work handicraft techniques, but she refused.  A chef from China who gave
 demonstrations in the United States was asked to stay there with a monthly
 salary as high as several thousands of U.S. dollars, but he refused.  Some
 of our scientific and research personnel who are studying abroad have won
 high prestige through their own creations and inventions, and consequently
 foreign universities have vied with each other to win them over by offering
 them positions as professor, but they said that their careers are in their
 motherland.  All this happened recently.  Generally speaking, they are not
 just individual examples, but are representative of the true nature of our
 life.   In the film, Xu Lingjun is a typical character that has been concen-
 trated, extracted and created by writers and artists from the current reality
 and the masses.   How can we say that the film glosses over reality?  How can
 we say that the character is "not true to life"?  Comrades who put forth such
 opinions have either departed from reality or do not really understand the
 revolutionary and realistic creative method of culture and literature.
 If we say that there are some shortcomings in the film, we must say that
 these shortcomings lie in the fact that Xu Lingjun's ardent love for herds-
 men, horses and the grassland, his great ideal of building the grassland
 and his lofty moral spirit are not fully presented.  Artistically speaking,
 the description of revolutionary romanticism such as depicting many scenes
 of the vast grassland and of galloping horses and the description of Xu
 Lingjun's ardent love for and great ideal of building the grassland are not
 enough.   The reconciliation between Xu Lingjun and his wife would be depicted
 more profoundly and movingly if this scene were changed from Xu Lingjun's
 giving his savings to Li Xiuzhi to cover her travel expenses and seeing her
 off to his returning home to find here there.  Such a scene would serve to
 depict the change in the feelings of the couple.  The film uses narration
 to interweave flashbacks with subjective monologues and reality, and this
 is no doubt a probe into a new method of film production and, therefore,
 merits trying.  But some scenes are difficult for the audience to follow.

 ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM IN DEVELOPED CAPITALIST COUNTRIES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 pp 45-48
 [Article by Yao Tinggang [1202 1694 4854]]
 [Text]  After the great crisis of 1929-1933, which shocked the capitalist
 system, and especially after the end of World War II, the monopoly capitalist
 class in capitalist countries embarked on a social welfare system.  This
 system can generally be divided into two parts--social security programs
 and welfare subsidies.   Under the social security programs, it is compulsory
 for all employed workers to contribute a part of their income regularly to
 pay their insurance premiums (or social security taxes), which in turn forms
 the basis for social security funds.   Social security includes insurance
 against old age, unemployment, disability, industrial injury and medical
 expenses.   Under old-age insurance, the insured can retire upon reaching
 retirement age and can receive pensions if they had paid premiums for a
 given period.  Under unemployment insurance, the insured can apply for their
 unemployment allowances for a period of half a year or 1 year.  After this
 period, if they are still jobless, they can apply for welfare subsidies.
 Under disability insurance, insured workers can draw disability or dis-
 ability allowances if they fall ill or become disabled.  They can receive
 allowances until they recover or die.   Under industrial injury insurance,
 compensation is available to insured workers or their families upon their
 death if they are the victims of industrial accidents or if they suffer
 occupational diseases.   Under health insurance, insured workers can receive
 reimbursement of part or all of their medical expenses. In general, welfare
 subsidies come under government appropriations, and can be considered as a
 kind of social relief.   They are mainly:  1) allowances for people who lose
 their source of income because of old age, disease and disability or people
 who are old, weak, sick or disabled and live below the minimum standard of
 living although they might receive retirement pensions; 2) family allowances,
 which help low income families to bring up children; 3) rent allowances,
 which supply low-income people with subsidies or loans to pay their rents;
 4) other' items, such as student allowances, food allowances, lying-in women
 allowances, and so on.
 The welfare and treatment of working people in the major capitalist countries
 have truly been improved since World War II, but does this mean that the
 exploitative nature of capitalism has changed and that the proletariat is.no

 longer exploited?  To examine this issue, we must take the Marxist viewpoint
 to analyze and arrive at an answer.
 1.  When adopting widespread social welfare policies, the monopoly capital-
 ist class does not proceed from a sense of benevolence, but aims at mitigating
 class contradictions and consolidating its rule.
 In 1929-1933, an unprecedentedly severe economic crisis occurred throughout
 the capitalist world, and it shook the capitalist system to its very founda-
 tion.  Widespread unemployment and the resulting poverty caused by the
 crisis drastically sharpened the class contradictions in capitalist coun-
 tries.  Working people rose up to fight against capitalism everywhere.  The
 revolutionary movement was then on the upsurge.  In order to mitigate the
 class contradictions and to save the precarious rule of the monopoly capi-
 talist class, the theory of the welfare state based on welfare economics and
 Keynesism emerged.   This theory held that capitalist states should adopt
 suitable tax policies, redistribute national income, and implement social
 welfare policies, including social security and unemployment allowances, so
 as to promote economic prosperity.   Under the stress of circumstances and
 the pressure of the working people's struggle, the monopoly capitalist class
 could not but adopt these measures and embark on social welfare policies.
 After the end of World War II, new conditions arose.   First, the proletariat
 in capitalist countries were further awakened and waged political and eco-
 nomic struggles on a magnificent scale.  Awestruck by the growing strength
 of the proletariat, the monopoly capitalist class had to make some conces-
 sions and gradually expanded social welfare measures.  Second, owing to the
 third scientific and technological revolution, productivity in developed
 capitalist countries was greatly improved in the 1950's and 1960's.  This
 made it possible for the capitalist class to give better wages and welfare
 treatment to the working people, because the relative surplus value and
 exploitation rate were being raised.  Third, great development was made
 by multinational corporations, which have subsidiaries all over the capital-
 ist world.  The profit rates of their investments in developing countries
 are much higher than those in their own developed countries.   Thus the capi-
 talist class of developed capitalist countries can rake in superprofits,
 and can give the workers in their own developed countries higher wages and
 better welfare.
 2.  Implementation of the social welfare system is necessary for the monopoly
 capitalist class to grab higher monopoly profits and to maintain its class
 interests.
 -Engels pointed out long ago,  "The bourgeoisie can also pretend to be merci-
 ful, but only when it is necessary to maintain their own interests."
 ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 2, p 568)  When high surplus
 value is guaranteed, the monopoly capitalist class finds that it is neces-
 sary to expand social consumption, so that they can free themselves from the
 plight of production stagnation.  When economic crises occur, by utilizing
 this social welfare system, which can function as an "automatic stabilizer
 of the economy," state monopoly capital can mitigate a crisis and shorten

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 the periods of crisis.  The bourgeoisie also use all kinds of terms stipu-
 lated in the social security programs to fetter the workers, preventing
 them from taking part in strikes and political struggles.  Through these
 tactics of drawing popular support, they can lull the fighting will of some
 of the workers and foster reformist and revisionist ideological trends in
 the worker ranks, so as to delay the emergence of revolutionary upsurge.
 Capitalist parties and politicians also use the improvement of the welfare
 system as one of their slogans in election campaigns in order to gain votes.
 While implementing the social welfare system, the monopoly capitalist class
 tries its best to make this system bring more benefits to the higher income
 groups and to the exploiters.  For example, there is a salary cutoff for the
 social security tax in the United States.  As a result, low-income people
 find that their entire salaries are taxable, but for people in higher income
 groups, a part of their income is not taxable.  In fact, this can be called
 "reverse progressive taxation."  Besides, income from dividends, interest
 and rent are not necessarily taxable.  People who have high incomes can also
 open "individual retirement accounts," by which they can save a large portion
 of their income from taxation and reserve this money for their retirement.
 Furthermore, government employees at all levels, especially congressmen,
 high-ranking officials, judges and career soldiers, enjoy a retirement system
 with excellent pay and other benefits.  Even the famous American economist
 Milton Friedman could not but concede that the social welfare system in the
 United States "harms people in low-income groups and benefits people in
 middle- or high-income groups."  Similar situations exist in other developed
 capitalist countries.
 3.   In developed capitalist countries,  the social welfare expenditure is, in
 the end, a burden on the working people because of high tax rates and high
 prices.
 In developed capitalist countries, working people in general pay their
 insurance premiums or social security taxes on a monthly basis, which guaran-
 tees their being entitled to certain benefits.  Because of the expansion of
 social security coverage, the relaxation of insurance compensation condi-
 tions, the drastic increase in the amount of compensation due to inflation
 and poor management,  the rates and amounts of premiums and insurance taxes'
 have increased rapidly.  In 1980, workers in the United States had to pay
 social insurance tax at a rate of 6.13 percent, as compared with the rate of
 1 percent in 1937.  The maximum taxable yearly income also rose from $3,000
 in 1937 to $25,900 in 1980.  The British national insurance program of 1979
 stipulated that workers at the ordinary income level (weekly income from
 19.5 to 135 pounds) should pay 6.5 percent of their income for insurance.
 In 1979, West German workers had to pay 9 percent of their wages for retire-
 ment insurance and another 5.65 percent for health insurance.
 Of course, developed capitalist countries generally stipulate that both
 employers and workers should pay half of the various social insurance
 premiums.  That part of the premium paid by employers seems to be paid by
 the bourgeoisie, but in fact it is also part of the value created by working
 people.   Capitalists can always use such methods as forcing wages down or
 hiking prices up to shift these expenses onto the working people.

 Expenditures on all kinds of social welfare benefits derive in part from the
 insurance premiums paid by employers and workers; the other part is derived
 from the state treasury.   But the welfare subsidies and relief funds paid
 to people in the low-income and poverty categories are totally derived from
 the state treasury.  This part appears to be given by the ruling class.  In
 fact, capitalist states raise these funds by increasing taxes; in the final*
 analysis, it is still the working people who bear this burden.  In the
 United States, all kinds of taxes accounted for 31.2 percent of the workers'
 taxable wages in 1977.  Sweden is famous for its comprehensive welfare
 system, but its tax rates are also terribly high.  In 1980, a single, low-
 income Swedish worker with a yearly wage of $15,000 had to pay one-third of
 his income in taxes; as for people whose yearly income is higher than
 $15,000, one-half of their income has to go to pay taxes.
 In spite of continuous increases in taxes and tax rates, revenues in the
 budgets of developed capitalist countries still cannot cover expenditures;
 huge deficits are a common phenomena.  As a result, inflation is getting
 worse and worse, and commodity prices are becoming higher and higher.  In
 fact, inflation and high prices are a kind of special taxation, by which,
 monopoly capitalist governments can further squeeze the working people.
 It thus can be seen that, under the capitalist system, the social welfare
 funds are part of the labor force value created by workers in their neces-
 sary laboring hours.   These funds are a part of the value of the means of
 subsistence, on which the worker can only maintain himself and his family
 at the basic standard of living.   The only difference is that in the past
 these funds were managed by the workers themselves, but now a larger and
 larger portion of them is paid by monopoly capitalists in the form of
 welfare funds and fall under the unified control and management by the
 state machinery of state monopoly capital.
 4.  Although working people in developed capitalist countries have enjoyed
 high welfare benefits since World War II, this fact has not changed the
 exploitative nature of capitalism, has not mitigated the exploitation of
 -working people, and still less has changed the exploited and enslaved
 position of wage workers.
 As mentioned above, under the capitalist system, social welfare funds are
 part of the value of the workers' labor force.  Guaranteeing the surplus
 value of the bourgeoisie is a necessary precondition for increasing these
 funds.   Although social welfare funds have increased, the workers' working
 hours can still be divided into necessary laboring hours and surplus labor-
 ing hours.                 Thus the bourgeois practice of wringing out the workers' sweat
 and blood has not changed in the least.   The workers' position of being
 exploited and enslaved has also not changed in the least.   Long ago, Marx
 pointed out:   "As better food and clothing, better treatment and more
 property could not eliminate the subordination and exploitation slaves
 suffered,  the same change will also not eliminate the subordination and
 exploitation wage workers suffer.   In fact, the increase in labor prices
 owing to the accumulation of capital only shows that the golden chains bind-
 ing wage workers have become slightly looser."  ("Das Kapital," Vol 1, p 678)

 Furthermore, even an increase in social welfare funds cannot mitigate the
 degree of exploitation that workers suffer.  Quite the opposite:  by
 improving the welfare system, monopoly capitalists can mobilize the pro-
 ducers' initiative and improve productivity.  As a result, the surplus value
 rate can be further raised and the degree of exploitation of the workers is
 also increased.
 According to statistics, in the United States the workers' real income
 (nominal wages plus welfare benefits after deducting taxes and the effect of
 inflation) rose by 97.7 percent from 1948 to 1977.  Of this income, the pro-
 portion of social welfare funds and capitalist enterprises' welfare funds
 rose from 9.4 percent in 1948 to 30.7 percent in 1977.  However, in the same
 period, the proportion of workers' real income in the national income fell
 from 29.3 percent to 26.3 percent, but the surplus value rate rose from
 236.7 percent to 280.9 percent.  The workers' surplus laboring hours (on
 the basis of an 8-hour day) were correspondingly prolonged from 5 hours 37
 minutes to 5 hours 54 minutes.   According to Hans Tamel, an East German
 economist, the postwar surplus value rate in West Germany rose from 181.4
 percent in 1950 to 260.0 percent in 1975.
 5.  Strict conditions are always laid down in the social welfare systems in
 developed capitalist countries; the amounts of insurance compensation and
 welfare allowances are too small to cover all the people who should be
 covered, still less to eliminate poverty.
 The United States is the most developed capitalist country, but obvious
 defects and problems exist in its social welfare system.  First, owing to
 harsh terms, many people, especially those in the poverty category, cannot
 draw any welfare allowances.   For example, besides the retirees having to
 reach retirement age, pensions are only available to retirees if they had
 paid into the pension fund for a specified period of time.   Disability terms
 are equally harsh, and a minimum period of paying premiums is required for
 those who draw disability allowances.  Furthermore, only after being dis-
 abled for 6 months, can a person draw a disability allowance.  Unemployment
 allowances are issued according to the beneficiaries' working time and their
 wage levels; these allowances are paid to them only for a specified period
 of time.   But those who resign of their own accord and those who are dis-
 missed for just cause are not eligible for unemployment benefits.   Property
 ownership and income levels are strictly enforced to regulate welfare
 allowance eligibility.  According to statistics, in June 1977, there were
 7.7 million people who had suffered permanent disabilities in the United
 States.  Owing to harsh terms, only 3.3 million of them could draw dis-
 ability allowances.   Second,  there are some workers who are not covered by
 any social security measures. For example, in recent years, those covered
 by old-age and disability insurance only account for 90 percent of the
 employed workers.  That means that there are still 10 million workers who
 are not covered.   Many states in the United States exclude farmworkers,
 housewives and temporary workers from eligibility for unemployment insurance
 and industrial injury benefits.  Except for those suffering from silicosis
 owing to having worked in coal mines, many people who contract occupational
 diseases cannot get any allowances.   Third, the problem of guaranteeing

 medical treatment to those suffering from various diseases has not yet been
 solved. "Medicare" and "Medicaid" so far cover only a part of the medical
 expenses for old people and for low-income families with children.  As for
 the health insurance of employed workers, premiums are generally paid by both
 employers and workers to some private insurance companies.  The premium rates
 are very high, but the compensation only covers one-third of the insured
 medical expenses.  According to statistics compiled by the U.S. National
 Institute of Health, even considering those insured by insurance companies,
 there were still 24 million Americans who were not covered by any health
 program, and another 20 million Americans who have a low level of health
 insurance coverage.  Fourth, social security compensation and welfare
 allowances are very low.  Unemployment allowances are generally equal to 40
 percent of an unemployed person's former wages.  Industrial injury benefits
 are only equal to two-thirds of an injured worker's former wages.  According
 to statistics, a single American worker can only'receive a pension equal to
 31 to 58 percent of his wages before retirement.  A married worker can receive
 a retirement pension together with his family allowance only equal to 47 to 78
 percent of his wage before retirement.  Therefore, many beneficiaries of
 social security and receivers of welfare allowances still live below the
 poverty line.
 6.   The social security system in developed capitalist countries is now
 facing a crisis.  The monopoly capitalist class in some countries is trying
 to undermine the fruits achieved by the working people by long-term struggle.
 As mentioned above, the major capitalist states raise their social security
 funds mainly by taxes.   Although the rates of these taxes have been raised
 again and again, the state revenues still cannot cover the expenditures,
 thus causing these countries to face an inextricable crisis.  For example,
 because of inflation and unemployment in recent years, the U.S. Government
 shifted part of funds for welfare allowances from the state treasury to the
 social security system.   Coupled with other factors, such as the fact that
 the proportion of employed workers to retirees has declined, the growth rate
 of the income of social security funds is far behind the growth rate of their
 expenses.  According to statistics, between 1977 and 1981, income for U.S.
 social security funds was $499 billion, but the expenditures of these funds
 were $540 billion, thus causing a deficit of $41 billion.  In the current
 economic "stagflation," this is a prominent problem.
 The fundamental reason for this stagflation lies in the basic contradiction
 in the capitalist system between the socialized production and the private
 ownership of the means of production.  However, the monopoly capitalist class
 and its advisers attribute "stagflation" to the social welfare policies.
 They advocate that costly welfare programs have resulted in the weakening of
 the competitive power of their products on the international market and have
 fostered laziness and a dependent mentality among workers, thus lowering
 productivity and causing financial deficits and inflation.   They maintain
 that the.social welfare standard should be lowered and expenditures for
 social welfare items should be reduced.   One of the major measures proposed
 in the "economic recovery program" of the Reagan administration is to reduce

 government expenditures, especially expenditures for social welfare programs.
 Other developed capitalist countries are also considering taking the same
 measures. If they really decide to adopt such measures and put into effect
 plans to slash social welfare expenditures on a large scale, they will not
 only find that they cannot free themselves from their economic plight, but,
 on the contrary, they will evoke stronger indignation and opposition on the
 part of working people, thus further sharpening class contradictions.

 THE PARTY'S WORK STYLE SHOULD BE GRASPED IN THIS WAY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 6, 16 Mar 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Zheng Nian [6774 1628]]
 [Text]  Recently a few localities achieved marked results and gained new
 experiences in grasping party work style.  Their approach to dealing with
 unhealthy tendencies is not to be afraid of them and not to stall for time.
 Their methods are as follows:  It is necessary to select an outstanding
 problem in the localities as a point of penetration; the leading bodies at
 various levels should set an example by each taking charge of the lower
 level, all the way down to the grassroots level; it is necessary not only
 to investigate and handle typical cases in earnest but at the same time
 put stress on ideological education.   Evidently this is a good way for
 grasping party work style.
 Some people say:   "Unhealthy tendencies are like persistent ailments which
 are difficult to cure!"   Not necessarily so.  Whether they are "persistent"
 or "difficult" is decided by whether the leadership is determined to grasp
 them.  If the leadership is determined to grasp them, they are neither
 "difficult" nor "persistent."  If the leadership fails to grasp them, they
 are both "difficult" and "persistent."  Recently a few localities conscien-
 tiously handled some typical cases.  This news was published in the press.
 At the same time practical measures for checking these unhealthy tendencies
 were set forth and the leadership at various levels was instructed to
 implement them conscientiously.  What with the resolute attitude on the part
 of the leadership and the effective measures and appropriate methods, the
 desired results were achieved very quickly, so that a healthy atmosphere
 prevailed and the unhealthy tendencies were visibly checked.  The masses
 said:   "So long as the leadership is not weak, it will be possible to improve
 party work style."  The fact that they have won the very first battle is
 sufficient to explain that everything has a dual nature and that the
 unhealthy tendencies also have the aspect of a "paper tiger."  So long as
 we can change the state of "being impassioned in speech, weak and flabby in
 action and softhearted in dealing with a problem," it is entirely possible
 to overcome them.   In grasping party work style, it is no good to remain
 at the stage of issuing a general call.  It is absolutely necessary to dare
 to grasp it and to grasp it firmly.   So long as we can tackle a few issues
 and deal with them in a down-to-earth manner, we will be able to promote our

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100260001-9
 work.  Once the general atmosphere has changed, all "persistent" and "diffi-
 cult" problems can be readily solved.
 Other people say:  "In order to check unhealthy tendencies, it is necessary
 to launch a campaign.  Otherwise, there will be no possibility for improving
 party work style."  The question now does not lie in whether we should launch
 a campaign but in whether we grasp party work style in earnest.  In dealing
 with unhealthy tendencies, we cannot just sit and wait.  We should go into
 action right away and wage struggles against them.  It is necessary to sum
 up our experience in struggle and find out the ways to defeat them.  The
 reason why the experiences gained in these localities are valuable is that
 they have proceeded from reality and struggled against the unhealthy ten-
 dencies by starting from grasping the outstanding problems in the localities.
 We should select the point of'penetration well so that we can focus our
 attention on the main problem.  When the leadership and the rank and file
 are of one mind and act in unison, it will be possible to change the situa-
 tion in a very short time.  It is necessary, in accordance with unified
 planning,  to grasp, supervise and inspect the work from one level to another,
 and check it on schedule before acceptance.   This will not only build up
 momentum but also enable the work to be carried out in earnest, thus giving
 full play to the power of the organizations.  With respect to those people
 who dare to defy the law, it is necessary to deal with them according to law.
 By handling a case in this way, we will be able to reap the benefit of
 educating many people.   It is necessary to hold organizational meetings well
 and solve the existing problems ideologically by discussing the harm and
 examining the ideological roots of the unhealthy tendencies.  In the past
 some people held that it would have been "unreasonable" or "make things
 difficult" if they had not practiced unhealthy tendencies, and now they hold
 that by.practicing unhealthy tendencies, they had "vilified the party,
 divorced themselves from the masses, and, if these tendencies were allowed
 to continue unchecked, they would adversely affect the four modernizations
 drive."  In the past some people continued to complain about being wronged
 in their heart of hearts after they had made a "self-criticism" and returned
 what they had unlawfully taken or had paid compensation for; now they keenly
 regret their mistakes when they make self-criticisms and feel relief after-
 ward.  We have gained this enlightenment from these experiences:   various
 localities should proceed from the local conditions, list the unhealthy ten-
 dencies about which the masses have many complaints, select a point of pene-
 tration and, after concentrating for a period of time to solve an aspect of
 the problem, go on solving another aspect of the problem.  It is especially
 necessary to seriously handle major criminal cases regarding the economy
 and other aspects and to investigate and handle existing major criminal
 cases in the economic field in which some responsible cadres are involved.
 By constantly grasping the problem in this way, we shall certainly be able
 to drastically reduce the unhealthy trends and evil practices in the party,
 and a completely new situation in party work style will certainly emerge.
