 He is undoubtedly American, probably a

 Nile, one foot up on the embankment. One
 hand rests on his knee; the other holds a
 bottle of beer. Hardly the vision of Ameri-
 can power in this corner of the world. He is
 only a block away from the embassy, where
 they are constructing high concrete walls
 and lining them with large cement "flower
 pots" to make it impossible to drive up
 alongside the wall. Every twenty or thirty
 yards an Egyptian soldier stands holding
 an outdated automatic weapon or rifle. The
 soldiers were there before the bombing of
 Libya, but there is no doubt that security
 has been increased dramatically since then.
 This is a scene repeated around the
 world as Americans on foreign soil fortify
 themselves, knowing they are targets,
 waiting for the worst.
 Interviews with intelligence and terro-
 rist experts lead to one conclusion: there
 will be more terrorism, and Americans will
 be the targets. There is disagreement about
 where the next terrorist acts will occur.

 CHILE
 Santiago police reported
 recently that one man was seri-
 ously wounded by gunfire and a
 hundred people arrested in street
 skirmishes in the capital city.
 Bombs destroyed three utility
 towers, blacking out much of Chile
 after tank-backed troops crushed a
 planned protest march against the
 military government.
 Three electric power pylons
 south of Santiago were shattered
 by explosives, cutting off service
 for ninety minutes along a
 1,457-mile zone of the central sec-
 tor, the army reported. The black-
 out was total in Santiago, Vina del
 Mar, and Concepcion.
 A Marxist guerilla group, the
 Manuel Rodrigues Patriotic Front,
 telephoned news agencies and said
 its members had set off the bombs.
 FRANCE
 According to the New York
 Times, a woman and a pistol-
 wielding associate flew a helicop-
 ter into the La Sante Prison in
 Paris, lowered a cable, and carried
 away a prisoner who had been
 serving an eighteen-year sentence
 for armed robbery. According to
 the Times, it was the thirty four-
 year-old prisoner's fourth escape in
 a long criminal career and "easily
 his most spectacular." This was
 only the second escape by helicop-
 ter from a French prison.
 The escapee, Michel Vaujour,
 appeared to have made a clean
 getaway. Witnesses and the police
 told Agence France-Presse that an
 Alouette II helicopter piloted by a
 woman appeared over the prison,
 hovered for several minutes, and a
 cable was lowered to Mr. Vaujour.
 A few minutes after the escape,
 the helicopter landed in an athletic
 field belonging to a student dor-
 mitory complex in the Porte d'Or-
 leans area of southern Paris. Stu-
 dents sunning themselves on the
 lawns of the complex said they saw
 two men and a woman run from
 the helicopter to a waiting car.
 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala will receive $16
 million in foreign aid to equip and
 modernize its national police force,
 Interior Minister Juan Jose Rodil
 Peralta has announced. "We want
 to change from having a repressive
 police force to one that is dedicated
 to public safety and crime preven-
 tion," Mr. Rodil said at a news
 conference.
 Mr. Rodil recently visited
 Spain, Venezuela, and Mexico, and
 he said all three countries had
 agreed to provide police aid to his
 country. He has indicated that the
 fourth country he visited, West
 Germany, was considering his
 request for aid.
 Mr. Rodil said Venezuela will
 extend a $10 million credit to
 Guatemala to be used for police
 purposes to buy patrol cars, jeeps,
 motorcycles, and radios. In addi-
 tion, Venezuela will send advisers
 to Guatemala to instruct police
 officers and to draw up plans for a
 new administrative structure for
 the police.
 Spain will also provide vehicles,
 radios, and anti-riot equipment,
 including plastic shields, batons,
 and vehicles that carry water can-
 nons.
 The minister of the interior said
 that the restructuring of the police
 force would probably take about
 five years.
 INDIA
 "I've tortured people thousands
 of ways. Chillies stuffed into the
 rectum of a man. Or we tie him to
 the four corners of a rope bed and
 stretch him to limits that are
 unendurable. It leaves no marks or
 injuries." The words are those of a
 police superintendent described in
 a Middle East Times article as
 "well mannered, urbane, and a
 family man, with a taste for clas-
 sical literature."
 The author of the article, Rich-
 ard S. Erlich, notes that brutality
 is a common phemonenon in India.
 Women are sometimes raped,
 assaulted, or verbally abused
 while undergoing questioning or

 making a complaint, according to
 women's rights groups and court
 testimony.
 The idea is to break a man
 completely, says the superinten-
 dent, who also says there is some
 remorse if a man is later found
 innocent. "Then you feel very
 ambivalent. You give him money,
 or help him in some way. If it was
 really bad, you get his nephew a
 job or something."
 There are no national statistics
 on torture, according to Erlich, but
 he cites the police superintendent's
 figures; for every person caught,
 three or four people have to suffer.
 IRAN
 The Ayatallah Hossein Ali
 Montazeri of Teheran has issued
 wide-ranging pardons for
 "common criminals," The Ettelaat
 reported.
 The pardons, which become
 effective on August 16, 1986, offer
 releases and reductions of sen-
 tences by up to two-thirds. Excep-
 tions include rapists, large-scale
 embezzlers, and narcotics dealers.
 Other exceptions are all private
 cases, for which in Islamic law the
 plaintiffs consent must first be
 obtained before a pardon.
 The new pardons do not apply to
 political prisoners.
 MALAYSIA
 Two convicted drug traffickers
 and a man sentenced to death for
 illegal possession of firearms were
 hanged at Kuala Lumpur's Pudu
 jail, the Bernama News Agency
 reported. A prison spokesman said
 a truck driver and a car salesman
 were sent to the gallows for traf-
 ficking 22 pounds of raw opium,
 14.7 ounces of heroin, and 2.6
 pounds of morphine. A thirty
 nine-year old man convicted in
 1984 for unlawful possession of
 four pistols and thirty rounds of
 ammunition also was hanged.

 UNITED STATES
 Policing America: A
 National Perspective
 The casual foreign observer of polic-
 ing in the United States generally has
 two false impressions: (1) policing in the
 U.S. is "impossible," with no one really
 in charge, or (2) policing in the U.S. con-
 sists of thousands of large departments,
 with New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago
 being typical. Unfortunately, these false
 impressions are constantly reinforced by
 television syndication of a variety of
 "police shows" featuring the police
 departments of a small number of
 selected large cities: Miami, San Fran-
 cisco, Los Angeles, etc.
 Neither impression is correct. The
 purpose of this brief introduction is to
 give an accurate picture and broad over-
 view of policing in the U.S., placing it in
 an appropriate sociopolitical context.
 The first point to be made is that polic-
 ing reflects the complex federal charac-
 ter of government in the U.S. There is a
 from enacting anything except miscel-
 laneous statutes (ordinances) carrying
 simple misdemeanor sanctions.
 "Universal," mala in se, felonies such
 as murder, robbery, kidnapping, arson,
 etc. are the province of the national or
 state legislatures. In practice, the fed-
 eral government's criminal law is fur-
 ther restricted to those offenses commit-
 ted either on, or against, federal
 property, or against federal officers who
 are engaged in official duties. For exam-
 ple, the murder of a U.S. senator during
 a burglary of his residence in California
 would be classified as a felonious viola-
 tion of California law--not federal law.
 The murder of the same individual while
 engaged in the performance of official
 duties in Washington, D.C. would be a
 violation of federal law.
 A number of other federal felonies
 involve preventing threats to "national"
 The patrol officer represents the backbone of American law enforcement.
 The scope and diversity of this role varies significantly throughout the coun-
 try.
 division of power and authority in the
 United States, with many functions
 being delegated by the U.S. Constitution
 to individual states and to local govern-
 ments.
 In the criminal law sector, each unit
 of government is entitled to enact its
 own criminal law and regulations for the
 protection of the public. Technically,
 criminal laws are found on all three
 levels: national (federal), state, and
 local. Through the doctrine of pre-emp-
 tion, state governments have essentially
 monopolized the enactment of felony
 violations of the law; local units of gov-
 ernment have been, practically speak-
 ing, precluded in the criminal law field
 functions, for example, the protection of
 the monetary system, the conduct of for-
 eign relations, and the promotion of
 interstate and international commerce.
 Counterfeiting U.S. currency or securi-
 ties, exporting firearms without a U.S.
 license, or hijacking an airliner are rel-
 evant examples.
 Although all three levels of govern-
 ment have criminal law jurisdictions,
 the bulk of criminal law enforcement is
 performed by local police and prosecu-
 tors. More than 80 percent of all pros-
 ecutions in the United States take place
 in state or local courts. Therefore, in
 terms of sheer volume of activity,

 Continued from page 3
 enforcement of the criminal law in the
 U.S. is predominantly a state and local
 responsibility.
 This brings us squarely to the issue of
 policing per se. The 1967 Report of the
 President's Commission on Law
 Enforcement and Administration exag-
 gerated the total number of policing
 agencies in the U.S. by stating that
 ter. It is on the local level--in cities and
 counties--that one finds the great
 majority of the police personnel paid for
 by public funds.
 With this large number of police
 agencies, what is representative of the
 typical police agency in the United
 States? The typical police employee
 works for an agency with less than fifty
 employees. In other words, Orland Park,
 Table 1 shows the number of
 employees--sworn and civilian--in the
 fifteen largest state and local police
 agencies in the U.S. (In the U.S., the
 term "sworn" is used to designate police
 employees who have full investigative
 and arrest powers.)
 In Table 2, data are given that show
 the number of police personnel employed
 in various sized cities, as well as the
 number of police employees per 1,000
 population. These data show that the
 U.S. is a nation typified by small and
 medium-sized cities. The organization of
 police resources reflects this pattern of
 development. The data also show that
 although nationally there are 2.5 police
 employees per 1,000 population, this
 ratio varies according to the size of each
 governmental unit.
 Unlike many nations in the world,
 the United States does not have either a
 national or a "nationalized" police sys-
 tem. Nor are the police unified in any of
 the fifty state jurisdictions. Technically,
 police jurisdictions are independent of
 each other and responsible only to their
 own governmental units. There is no
 central coordinating authority, either
 nationally or in the individual states.
 Without mandatory centralization,
 how can the police operate effectively to
 protect the populace? In the absence of
 mandatory, legal requirements for coor-
 dination or the sharing of information,
 there are of course, instances of failure.
 These are relatively rare, however.

 there were forty thousand such agencies.
 Twenty thousand is probably a more
 accurate figure - no one is actually cer-
 tain!
 Each unit of government--national,
 state, and local--has its own policing
 apparatus. Many, such as the federal
 government, have a number of different
 police agencies, each having a legisla-
 tively determined jurisdiction. The
 national federal government has a
 number of such agencies, the most
 famous being the following: the Federal
 Bureau of Investigation; the Secret Ser-
 vice, the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
 tration; the Alcohol, Tobacco and Fire-
 arms Agency; the Customs Service; and
 the Immigration and Naturalization
 Service. It is estimated that the national
 government has slightly more than one
 hundred policing agencies.
 Each of the fifty states in the U.S.
 also has its own policing agency: some
 have only a single agency; while others
 have a number of such agencies. For
 example, each state has responsibility
 for enforcing laws on its highways.
 Therefore, each state has a "highway
 patrol," irrespective of the official title of
 that agency. An estimate of the number
 of different state police agencies is 350.
 Despite the fact that criminal law is
 essentially an individual state function
 in the U.S., the states have generally
 delegated the enforcement of those laws
 to local prosecutors and police forces. It
 is accurate, to say that policing in the
 United States is essentially a local mat-
 Illinois, is much more typical of U.S.
 policing than is the much better known
 Chicago Police Department, and, San
 Rafael, California, is more typical than
 either San Francisco or Los Angeles.

 nations, in the United State the police do
 not belong to a single, centralized per-
 sonnel system--on either the national or
 state level. Nor is there an inspector of
 constabulary such as is found in the
 United Kingdom.
 There are, of course, national laws
 relating to "racketeering," and there are
 national, constitutionally defined stan-
 dards of due process for the protection of
 human rights. Furthermore, both the
 national and state governments may
 prosecute police and other officials for
 corruption.
 There are also minimum personnel
 selection and training standards in all
 but four of the states. The primary
 political pressure for the adoption of
 these standards came from the police
 ranks, not from external political or
 social groups.
 The principal explanation for police
 effectiveness is rooted in the informal
 standards of professionalism adopted
 voluntarily by the police themselves.
 Over the years, reform has taken place
 incrementally both in local government
 generally and in police administration.
 The quality of police service in the
 United States, in spite of structural
 handicaps, is a tribute to police profes-
 sionalism.
 This is sustained now by continued
 interest on the part of national, state,
 and local police professional associa-
 tions, by the expectations of the public,
 by the media, and by university centers
 for research and study.
 In subsequent articles, individual
 police departments in the U.S. and spe-

 The former undercover agent,
 Alejandro Gonzalez Malave, was
 killed instantly by three shotgun

 The Volunteer Organization for

 young advocates of independence.
 The FBI was called in because it
 had been investigating the group
 for some time. According to the
 FBI, the group was responsible for
 the attack on a navy bus on
 December 3, 1979, in which two
 navy men were killed and ten peo-
 ple injured. It was also responsible
 for the January 12, 1981, attack on
 the Puerto Rico Air National

 planes were blown up. The FBI has
 said that the group is one of the
 most dangerous terrorist organi-

 SOUTH KOREA
 Recently, students and police-
 men clashed with gasoline bombs,
 stones, and tear gas on at least
 four Seoul campuses in an intensi-
 fication of violence to mark the
 anniversary of an 1980 protest
 against martial law.
 At Yonsel University, hundreds
 of students chanted "Down with
 imperialism!"and other anti go-
 vernment slogans when five hun-
 dred riot police entered the cam-
 pus. At Korea University about
 four hundred students battled riot
 policemen at the campus gate for
 hours before withdrawing to a
 barricaded library.
 Similar clashes were reported
 at two other universities in Seoul
 and in another provincial univer-
 sity. More than ten thousand stu-
 dents took part in similar clashes
 and rallies on at least thirty three
 campuses, the English-language
 Korea Times reported.
 SOVIET UNION
 The  Soviet  Union  has
 announced a major crackdown on
 corruption and black-marketeer-

 for officials who accept bribes and
 two years in a labor camp for indi-
 viduals who feed baked bread to
 cattle.
 The Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet, the executive branch of
 government, announced the list of
 punishments for black-marke-
 teering, petty theft, bribery, and
 other corruption.
 The decree, which was tele-
 vised, becomes effective July 1,
 1986, and sets punishments rang-
 ing from a fine for petty theft to
 execution for government officials
 convicted for a second time of tak-
 ing  bribes  or  receiving
 "exceptionally large" bribes.
 The decree orders two years of
 "corrective labor" for repeated
 incidents of feeding cattle and
 poultry with baked bread, flour,
 and cereals rather than the more
 expensive government-produced
 feeds. The Soviet government sub-
 sidizes bread products and must
 import grain to meet bread
 demands.

 The camps were run by the
 Russian army and the secret

 the conditions were brutal. The
 men worked sixteen hours a day,
 receiving six-hundred to eight-
 hundred grams of bread and hot
 water for breakfast and watery
 soup at night. Most prisoners
 never survived the mines, usually
 not making it through the first two
 years. The mines, located in
 Kolyma, which means death in
 Russian, were viewed as the "final
 solution," according to Cieslewicz.

 Vehicle, a $34,000, 192-pound
 shotgun-toting, bomb-detecting
 machine that police officials say
 they hope will reduce the danger to

 powered and capable of climbing
 steep staircases. The robot is
 remote controlled on a 328-foot
 electrical cord tether, and it has

 U.S.-FLORIDA
 Wackenhut Corporation, one of
 the big American security compa-

 Anti-Terrorism Unit. Wackenhut,
 who did not go into business until
 1954, said it plans to form an anti-
 terrorism and crisis management
 unit to assist corporations and
 perhaps government agencies. Mr.
 George Wackenhut said the anti-
 terrorism unit would be based in
 Florida or in Washington, D.C.,
 and would probably start with
 about a half a dozen specialists
 working with the company's exist-
 ing executive protection division.
 Wackenhut further said that he
 feels there will be a great upsurge
 in private security against terror-
 ism in the coming months and
 years. "All the experts have opined
 that terrorism is going to reach the
 United States," he said.
 Wackenhut currently protects a

 American city, resigned on June 2,
 according to Crime Control Digest.
 Chief Harrington, 44, said she had
 submitted her written resignation
 on June 1 to Mayor Bud Clark,
 who appointed her in January
 1985. She called the resignation a
 victory for the Portland Police
 Association, the union that has
 opposed her administration.
 A special-investigation com-
 mission's report characterized her
 administration as a failure. It said
 that Chief Harrington had shown
 "defects of leadership" that "cost
 her the confidence" of her com-
 mand.
 Chief Harrington declined to
 elaborate on the report other than
 to say that the panel had criticized
 her as lacking leadership and
 management ability. She indi-
 cated that the report was
 extremely critical of her and left
 her no choice but to resign.

 Foiling Terrorism
 The odds of being the victim of
 terrorism in Europe aren't very
 high according to State Depart-
 ment statistics which indicate
 that, of the 6.4 million Americans
 who ventured to the continent,
 twelve were killed in terrorist
 attacks. The odds are a little
 higher in the middle east, but
 nowhere near the number of auto-
 mobile deaths on American high-
 ways, or the murder rate in large
 cities.
 If you're still bothered by the
 threat, there are some minimal
 precautions you can take, accord-
 ing to International Business
 Week. These include the use of
 "neutral" airlines, such as Swis-
 sair or SAS. Arrive at smaller sec-
 ondary airports, avoid public
 places, and stay in the security
 screened areas as much as possi-
 ble.
 Most CJ types recognize the
 need for a low profile, and may be
 cautious enough to keep an eye out
 for unattended briefcases and
 shopping bags, but keeping one's
 head down when the shooting
 starts may be difficult. Neverthe-
 less, perhaps the greatest danger
 to tourists is in their failure to "hit
 the deck" if an attack occurs.
 For the bold and the brave there
 are some strong financial rewards.
 Most carriers are offering reduced
 fares this summer, and there is the
 promise of continued savings in
 the Fall.

 America at the Barricades
 Continued from page 1
 It did not begin, nor will it end, with
 Libya.?'Libya became a focal point when
 America, with its air strikes, flexed its
 muscles while the world watched.
 Sitting next to Libya, Egypt, in the
 past a gateway to the Arab world, has
 had its problems with the reign of
 Moammar Qaddafi. Egypt is slowly
 rebuilding relationships with its Arab
 neighbors who condemned the country's
 recognition of Israel during the Carter
 administration. Interviews with police,
 government, political, and business
 leaders in Egypt reveal the most moder-
 ate Arab view of America's action and
 what they believe the future holds.
 Among the twenty or thirty individ-
 uals interviewed, alone and in groups,
 there is surprising consensus and a less
 than optimistic view of the future. With
 the exception of one or two, these people
 are not anti-American. Virtually all of
 them have attended American universi-
 ties and numerous conferences in the
 U.S.
 To a man, they view the air strikes as
 a mistake, though for different reasons.
 However, they all concur that this action
 gave Qaddafi more stature in the world.
 The American attack strengthened the
 position of extremist Moslems and fueled
 the fanaticism that simmers at the heart
 of those Arab countries facing a religious
 renaissance. It fostered feelings of hos-
 tility toward Israel and the United
 States, and it could well bring down
 many of the Arab countries that have
 been moving toward moderate and more
 democratic positions.
 Perhaps most important, all the
 leaders interviewed trace the root of ter-
 rorism in the Middle East to the Pales-
 tinian problem. All agree that a resolu-
 tion of the Palestinian problem will
 reduce terrorism, although not all agree
 that it will end the violence completely.
 A senior government official criti-
 cized the American decision to drop
 bombs without making any effort to ask
 for the advice of the Egyptian govern-
 ment. "We knew it was going to hap-
 pen," he said, "but from our own analy-
 sis, not because we were formally told."
 An Egyptian general, one of the few
 real experts on terrorism around the
 world, explained the futility of the air
 strike. "The problem with the Ameri-
 cans is that they do not understand the
 psychology of Qaddafi. To try and miss
 the target was to invite retaliation."
 A former senior police official, now a
 university professor, who worked in
 Libya for three years and who kn9ws
 Qaddafi personally, said, "Even if he
 goes now, he goes a martyr. He is a
 criminal, and was one from the day he
 was born."
 There is also the fact that Qaddafi
 and his government are not the only
 ones involved in terrorism. "It has
 become the new war of the weak," the
 terrorism expert concluded, pointing out
 that conventional measures to combat it
 will most likely fail.
 There is frustration with Israel's
 refusal to negotiate the fate of the Pal-
 estinians, but everyone spoke of the need
 for Israel to exist. A professor of criminal
 law likens Israel's treatment of the Pal-
 estinians to the U.S. treatment of the
 Indians. "You put them on a reservation,
 with no rights; you expect them to take
 it without protesting."
 For the Egyptians, who have only
 recently seen increasing terrorist acts on
 their soil, there is a feeling of frustra-
 tion. The move to open relations with
 Israel was designed to promote peace
 and closer ties with the United States. It
 may have the opposite effect if America
 does not begin to understand the Arab
 world.
 Egyptians are worried about the
 growing threat of the fanatic Moslems
 who use religion to advance their cause.
 "Religion is something people turn to
 when they are poor," said a professor of
 economics, "and it is not impossible to
 see the same thing here that happened
 in Iran." The average income in Egypt is
 less than $300 a year, lower than most
 countries in the free world, even lower
 than China. "The frustration and the
 inability of government to do anything
 makes the situation worse," he said.
 Another financial analyst with close
 ties to the United States noted that
 American aid to Israel amounts to more
 than $2,000 per person each year.
 "Israel, with four million people, gets
 more aid than Egypt, with close to fifty
 million people."
 Not far from the Nile, workmen stack
 concrete blocks and bricks around the
 embassies of the United States and
 England. Weary faces peer out from
 behind the iron grillwork of the grounds.
 Cairo is a peaceful city, with less crime
 than any large city in the United States.
 But, as America builds walls and tou-
 rists stay away, the need for more secur-
 ity increases because the threat of terro-
 rism has affected the American people
 who are there.
 Perhaps it is ironic, but on a hill just
 outside Cairo, workers also toil to com-

 IS  FRANCE  A
 POLICE STATE?
 By Philip John Stead
 The words sounded strange that summer morning in Paris
 in 1956. We were sitting on a cafe terrace on the boulevard
 Saint-Germain, the French magistrate and I, and he had just
 said, "France is a police state." I was shocked: my notion of a
 police state at that time was firmly associated with Musso-
 lini, Stalin, and Hitler. It certainly did not seem to accord
 with the ramshackle parliamentary democracy of the Fourth
 Drawing from a French postcard.
 Republic. Yet here was a highly intelligent and high-princi-
 pled official of the Ministry of Justice making this astonish-
 ing statement. I have often reflected upon it.
 What is a "police state"? In our search for an answer to
 that question, I suppose we should begin by asking what was
 a police state? The term was first used to characterize Prus-
 sia at the end of the eighteenth century. The kind of govern-
 ment it implied, however, was very different from the twen-
 tieth century's abominable despotisms. The eighteenth
 century police state existed not only in Prussia but also in
 Austria, France, and Russia, all ruled by autocratic mon-
 archs who sought to better the condition of their kingdoms
 and their subjects by paternalistic regulation. In those coun-
 tries, as opposed to Britain, centralized government and its
 essential instrument, bureaucracy, were established, and the
 result was order at the expense of liberty.
 The term "police", as we all know, did not until the nine-
 teenth century cause one to think of the officers who enforce
 the criminal and other laws and maintain public order.
 Before then it denoted the internal administration of a coun-
 try-the design and execution of its domestic policy-and it was
 in this sense that the term police state was applicable to the
 rule of the "benevolent despots" of the Age of Enlightenment.
 The "Police State" of the Ancien Regime
 In the evolution of a "police state" in seventeenth century
 France, for example, we can see how an official who today
 would exercise functions mainly concerned with the mainte-
 nance of order and the enforcement of law was then deeply
 involved in a far wider range of responsibilities.
 During the latter part of that century, King Louis XIV
 and his ministers embarked upon a vast program of urban
 renewal in which his great police chief, Nicolas-Gabriel de La
 Reynie, had a key role. To him fell the multiple tasks of
 policing the security, public health, provisioning, and gen-
 eral good order of Paris's over half-million inhabitants.
 Backed by the high authority of the monarch, he reformed
 and strengthened the personnel of the police, provided sys-
 tems of street cleaning and garbage collection, made regula-
 tions for the paving of the streets and the passage of vehicles,
 augmented the water-supply, and took measures for the care
 of the sick and the poor and the repression of mendicity and
 vagabondage.
 While fine edifices were being built, gardens and avenues
 were being planted, and a new and lovelier Paris was emerg-
 ing from its medieval shell, La Reynie busied himself with
 the quality of life in the city, improving its civility by dealing
 forcefully with violence and crime no less than with dirt, fire,
 darkness, flood, and disease. When plague struck other cities
 in France in 1668-1669 he reacted by establishing a cordon
 ple from the infected areas. One young man, recently arrived,
 died of the dread disease. La Reynie's police traced everyone
 who had been in contact with him and placed them in quar-
 antine. (I seem to remember a good movie in which Richard
 Widmark did something of the same kind!) During the fam-
 ine that followed bad harvests in 1692-1694, he imported
 grain and distributed bread to the poor and also fought a
 stern battle with the merchants who sought to monopolize
 grain and raise prices.
 All this activity reflected the beneficence of Louis XIV's
 "police state"; more malignant, and too familiar in the twen-
 tieth-century experience, was the king's attempt to enforce
 orthodoxy upon his subjects. King Henri N's Edict of Nantes
 had for almost a century assured a measure of toleration to
 France's Protestants: in 1685, Louis XIV revoked it, and the
 burden of enforcing the new laws fell upon La Reynie. Who
 loyally carried out what must have been, to one of his intel-
 lectual and humane character, an uncongenial duty, entail-
 ing as it did the persecution and emigration of many of his
 country's most productive citizens.
 Another aspect of a state in which the ruler was above the
 law was the practice of imprisoning individuals without trial,
 simply on a warrant with the royal seal and signature, the
 lettre de cachet. Though the power was, as historians have
 demonstrated, used principally to discipline the nobility, it

 contrasted unfavorably with the safeguard of the habeas cor-
 pus writ enjoyed by people in Britain and America. In such
 aspects, we see a foreshadowing of the fearful abuse of police
 powers that has been such a tragic feature of our own cen-
 tury.
 NAPOLEON
 The monarchs of the Ancien Regime exercised a measure
 of police control in the provinces as well as in their capital
 city. Since the Middle Ages there had been a military police,
 the marechaussee, had developed in the eighteenth century
 into a well-organized and systematic police of the roads and
 rural communities. Moreover, thirty-four royal officials,
 called intendants of justice, police, and finance, had supervi-
 sory jurisdiction as the king's watchdogs in their respective
 territorial areas. With the Revolution of 1789 the office of
 intendant was abolished, with consequent relaxation of the
 government's hold on the provinces. The counterrevolution-
 ary movements which took advantage of this had to be
 repressed by sending representatives of the central govern-
 ment with plenipotentiary commissions to repress revolt and
 rebuilt and extended during the revolutionary and Napole-
 onic eras, functioned with changes more cosmetic than radi-
 cal under the two monarchies the next thirty years. After the
 revolution of 1848, another Bonaparte, the emperor's
 nephew, returned from exile to be elected president and lost
 little time in seizing power by coup d'etat from the Republic-
 ans and proclaiming himself Emperor Napoleon III. He
 developed even further the central government's grip on
 France during his reign, the Second Empire, between 1852
 and 1870. The prefects, in particular, gained greater power
 over local administration and openly and effectively exerted
 influence in the political sphere.
 Napoleon III, himself a former conspirator, was deeply
 concerned with subversion, and the administrative resources
 of his regime were marshaled against people thought to be
 opposed to it. Signs of the times in the earlier part of his reign
 were imprisonment at home or deportation to imprisonment
 abroad, exile, prescription of residence, a close watch at
 points where his enemies might seek to leave or re-enter
 France, harassing regulation and manipulation of the press,
 and incessant efforts to get support for the government-itself
 an autocracy deriving its authority from popular approval

 inculcate revolutionary zeal-a task often performed by sheer
 governmental terrorism, as in Lyon in 1793 when so many
 people were sentenced to death that they had to be executed
 by artillery.
 Napoleon, seizing power in 1799, rapidly abolished the
 need for such ad hoc devices by restoring the principle of the
 intendants. In each of the ninety-eight territorial depart-
 ments into which France was now divided, he stationed a
 permanent representative of his government. These officials
 he called, in the Roman style in vogue in postrevolutionary
 France, "prefects" (a title apt enough to last until 1981, when
 President Mitterrand changed it to "commissaires of the
 Republic").
 The France of Napoleon was far more a police state as we
 understand the term today than the France ruled by kings. A
 Ministry of Police had general political oversight as its most
 salient feature. A prefect of Police was appointed for Paris.
 The department prefects watched over their territories. In
 each sizeable urban center a government-appointed commis-
 saire commanded the mayoral police. At the ports and fron-
 tier towns commissaires-general of police watched for the
 comings and goings of enemy agents and native subversives.
 Throughout France's countryside and along her roads the
 military police, now the Gendarmerie patrolled, demanding
 identification of all and sundry and combining ordinary
 police work with political intelligence. There was more
 detention without trial, more censorship of the press, more
 interception of mail, more government propaganda than
 there had been in centuries of the Ancien Regime.
 Hand in hand with all this went a continuation and a vast
 increase in the powers exercised by the bureaucrats of the
 "police state" of the kings, powers to make regulations
 affecting people in all walks of life.
 The administrative machinery of the Ancien Regime,
 Republican    Counter-     Air and
 Security      Espionage    Frontier
 Companies                  Police
 based partly on bourgeois dread of a left-wing takeover, an
 attitude that the bureaucracy from the prefects down sedu-
 lously sought to cultivate.
 The Second Empire saw considerable change in the police
 system. The Gendarmerie was given a larger establishment.
 The Paris police developed a much closer uniformed patrol,
 somewhat on the London Metropolitan Police's beat model
 (the emperor, when exiled in England, had been an auxiliary
 policeman in 1848). Lyon, France's second largest city, had
 its municipal police force nationalized and placed under the
 departmental perfect. Additionally a political police branch
 was formed. A special surveillance of railways was estab-
 lished as a central service under the Ministry of the Interior,
 ostensibly for ordinary police intelligence.
 It is pertinent to note that Napoleon III only suceeded in
 his transition from president to emperor by a coup d'etat in
 which the police were his principal agents in locking up the
 parliamentry opposition. His phenomenal uncle, inciden-
 tally, came to power through a coup d'etat to which the police
 were no strangers. The two Napoleons' principal common
 feature was concern with the security of the regime; both
 maintained exceptional machinery for the collection of intel-
 ligence and large forces for the maintenance of order.
 During the nineteenth century, the centralization of gov-
 ernment control of the police continued at the Ministry of the
 Interior. There a national police headquarters grew up
 piecemeal under the name Surete Generale, with the object, if
 not the effect, of supervising and coordinating the work of the
 prefects, the national police force in Lyon, and the new spe-
 cialist police branches. The prefect of Police of Paris, how-
 ever, answered directly to the minister, not to the head of the
 Surete. At the end of the century the French police system
 was basically tripartite: The Surete Generale, controlling the
 civil police of the provinces and the specialists: The Prefec-
 ture of Police of Paris; and the Gendarmerie Nationale. The
 first two were under the Minister of the Interior, and the

 third was under the Minister of War, their respective politi-
 cal masters. The Minister of Justice was political master of
 all police, whether civil or military, insofar as they were
 engaged in the investigation and proof of crime. His control
 was exercised through the magistracy in the form of the
 prosecutors and the juges d'instruction.
 Both the Napoleons fell in war, after massive military
 defeat, but the administrative structure of their regimes
 survived and constitutes the framework of the police system
 today.
 Twentieth Century: Centralization Continues
 During the twentieth century, the nationalization of the
 civil police continued. An important step was the formation
 of criminal investigation branches on a regional basis, with
 the mission of combating serious professional crime and
 under the overall control of the Surete Generale. Others were
 the nationalization in 1941 of the police forces of all urban
 centers with a population of over 10,000 and the establish-
 ment of a national police college to train the Surete's com-
 missaires.
 At the end of World War II a new police organization
 under the control of the Surete appeared-the Republican
 Security Companies, designed as a reserve to be deployed
 anywhere in the country in the event of serious public turbu-
 lence.
 The most radical of the measures to bring the whole of the
 civil police under a single head at the Ministry of the Interior
 was the consolidation of the personnel of the Prefecture of
 Police of Paris with the rest of the civil police. All now come
 under the Director-General of the Police Nationale, with the
 prefect of police answering administratively to him while
 retaining control of the operations of the force in Paris. This
 ushered in, from 1968 onwards, a more uniform system of
 recruitment, training, and promotion, and the national police
 headquarters in Paris established a firmer hold on the entire
 civil police.
 The Police Structure Today
 The political head of the civil police is the Minister of the
 Interior and of Decentralization (the appendage of Decen-
 tralization dates from President Mitterrand's reforms of 1981
 and relates mainly to giving local political governments
 larger powers in their own affairs; it does not affect the min-
 ister's control of the police), aided by another political minis-
 ter, the secretary of state in charge of public security. The
 chief administrative executive is the Director-General of the
 Police Nationale, an official of prefectural rank, who answers
 to the tow ministers for the organization and conduct of the
 service. The headquarters (see illustration) indicates the
 dispersal and balance of civil police effort in France.
 The operational aspects are only partly paralleled in
 American police practice. General intelligence, the function
 of which is to provide the government with political, social,
 and economic intelligence, for instance, has no counterpart in
 the U.S. Domestic counterespionage, a major police function
 in France, is in the United States, the preserve of the FBI.
 Urban police and criminal investigation are easier to
 match, but localized as their functions inevitably are in
 France they are ultimately under national control. Federal
 investigative agencies have far less jurisdiction here than
 have the centrally directed police organisms in France. In the
 business of public order emergencies, I suppose the nearest
 counterpart to the Republican Security Companies is the
 National Guard. As the Guard is a part-time military force
 operating within the individual states, however valuable it
 may be in the hour of need, it cannot be compared with
 France's full-time, highly-trained, specialist riot police,
 available for deployment to any part of the country and
 again, under central direction. The Air and Frontier Police,
 are also centrally directed, not provided, as in the United
 Page 11
 States, by local police agencies, though the Border Patrol has
 an obvious parallel.
 The Gendarmerie Nationale-first regiment of the French
 Army, and its members are fully trained for their dual func-
 tion as soldiers and police officers-has no parallel in the U.S.
 In territorial terms, the Gendarmerie has by far the largest
 jurisdiction, policing as it does the main roads, smaller
 towns, and countryside of France-which means 95 percent of
 the country. The gendarme, always in uniform, is the most
 visible and omnipresent of French police officers, and
 because most gendarmes operate in small units in the neigh-
 borhood of their quarters they are often the best qualified to
 know what is happening.
 The Gendarmerie (recently the subject of an excellent and
 detailed study in English by Mr. J. R. J . Jammes) is organ-
 ized under a Director-General responsible to the Minister of
 Defense. It has three main components: the Republican
 Guard, stationed permanently in Paris; the Departmental
 Gendarmerie, stationed permanently in one of the other of
 France's six defense zones (regions); and the Mobile Gen-
 darmerie, stationed in regions but liable to be moved when-
 ever necessary, often at very short notice. The Gendarmerie
 Mobile, unlike its civilian counterpart, the Republican
 Security Companies, has tanks, armored vehicles, and light
 aircraft.
 The relative strengths of the civil and military police (fig-
 ures for 1985) are 122,000 and 84,000 respectively, for a pop-
 ulation of some 52,000,000-a ratio of police to public consid-
 erably higher than in the United States. However, it should
 be taken into account that of the French police 15,678 officers
 are held in the riot reserve of the Republican Security Com-
 panies and 17,000 of the Gendarmerie are in the Gendarm-
 erie Mobile while 2,000 are on provost or specialist duties.
 Allowing also for the number of officers employed in general
 Napolean, architect of the French police system.
 intelligence and counterespionage duties, the numbers
 engaged in "ordinary" police work, it may well be found, are
 proportionately about the same in France and the United
 States.
 France thus cannot be said to possess the massive police
 resources one associates with a modern police state.
 Modernization
 The Gendarmerie Nationale, has for many years, been
 treated more generously than the civil police in the financial
 provision made for it by the government. Its buildings,

 equipment, and training are of markedly superior quality.
 This is in great measure due to the high regard this presti-
 gious regiment has enjoyed over the centuries and perhaps,
 to an even greater extent, to the fact that it has so long been
 under strong ministerial and administrative control. Not so
 the Police Nationale, the quite recent amalgam of multifari-
 ous local organizations over which full central control has
 only been effected for a little more than two decades.
 In the 1970s, however, the central government began to
 recognize the responsibilities it incurred by the legislation of
 1966 that brought the Police Nationale into being. There
 began a thorough reorganization of the recruitment and
 training system. New facilities were opened, old ones were
 rejuvenated, and the induction and further-training estab-
 lishments were incorporated into a structure designed to
 make their contribution more relevant to the work the ser-
 vice has to do.
 But in many other respects, the civil police were sadly
 lacking in much that is essential for success in policing the
 modern world. This was acknowledged by the minister of
 interior and decentralization in the National Assembly (the
 French counterpart of the U.S. House of Representatives) on
 November 5, 1984. What has been undertaken in the light of
 the parliamentary debates that ensued is a striking example
 of what can be done when a central government has the will
 to do it.
 August 1985 saw the adoption of a grand project for the
 modernization of the civil police. At an extra cost of five bil-
 lion francs over the next five years, the budget for police has
 been augmented by no less than 50 percent. The money is to
 be spent, inter alia, on further improvements in training (for
 In our time "police state" has
 become synonymous with totalitar-
 ianism,
 it has been well accepted that the quality of personnel is the
 prime consideration); on providing greater mobility by
 replacing and increasing police automobile fleets; on com-
 puterization and information systems and communications;
 on scientific and technical services; on weapon training and
 weaponry (replacing the present issue of automatics with
 revolvers-the Manhurin 357 Magnum); on buildings; and on
 long-overdue improvements in the conditions under which
 police officers have to work. Such a massive renewal, on the
 national scale, is possible only when a central government
 accepts the task as the French government has accepted it.
 A Police State?
 I have sketched the evolution of France's police system
 from the Ancien Regime to the present day-the evolution of
 an increasingly centralized dual police organization from its
 beginnings as the public-tranquillity and law-enforcement
 mechanism of a typical monarchical "police state" through
 some two centuries of change. Does the existence of such a
 police system justify deeming France a police state today?
 In our time, police state has become synonymous with
 totalitarianism. What are the essential features of a totali-
 tarian regime? The late Brian Chapman recapitulated them
 from his (and my) friend Professor Ghita Ionescu's book, The
 Politics of the European Communist States (London: Weiden-
 feld and Nicolson, 1968): "a compulsory ideology, a mono-
 lithic party, a monopoly of communications, a monopoly of all
 means of armed combat, a centrally directed economy and a
 terrorist political police."
 However authoritarian French regimes have been since
 1789, even under the First and Second Empires, they have
 never qualified as totalitarian according to lonescu's list.
 The answer to the question of whether France is a police
 state is partly to be divined from a statement made in the
 Final Report of the Royal Commission on the Police in Brit-
 ain in 1962. The issue of whether the British police should be
 nationalized was being considered. It had been contended
 that if the police were nationalized, "any future Government
 would have ready to hand the means of establishing a police
 state." This view the commissioners did not accept. They
 stated unequivocally that British liberty does not depend on
 any particular kind of police system but "on the supremacy of
 Parliament and on the rule of law." They remarked: "In the
 countries to which the term police state is applied opprobri-
 ously, police power is controlled by the government, but they
 are so called not because the police are nationally organized,
 but because the government acknowledges no accountability
 to a democratically elected parliament, and the citizen can-
 not rely on the courts to protect him." That, I think, would be
 accepted as good doctrine in the United States.
 The French government is the government of a unitary
 republic, democratically elected under the written constitu-
 tion of the Fifth Republic. The police are answerable to the
 electorate through the President and the three ministers
 (interior, defense, justice) of the day. The citizen has recourse
 to the courts for protection. The press has no mercy on official
 abuses; authors write what they will. Nowhere is politics
 discussed more fervently and freely. The French do not order
 things as we order them in the English-speaking world; the
 differing spirits of Roman law and common law divide us.
 But in each case the rule of law is there.
 The French government continues to seek to be well
 informed on the course of public opinion and the factors
 affecting the equilibrium of the nation. That it provides itself
 with the means of preserving and restoring public
 tranquillity, to an extent in each case which seems strange to
 people in America and Britain, can only be understood in the
 light of France's history-a history which has taken a different
 course from ours, when regimes have lost control and violent
 uprisings have dictated change. Twice in our own century, in
 1934 and 1968, the governments of the Third and Fifth
 Republics escaped eclipse only because they were able to
 restore order in the streets of Paris.
 Let me end where I began, under the trees of the boule-
 vard Saint-Germain. Putting down my coffee cup, I said to
 the magistrate who told me that France is a police state, "I
 wouldn't have thought so." I still feel the same way.

 Islamic criminal legislation is based
 on the division of crimes into three
 categories according to the nature of the
 crime and whether it is committed
 against the rights of God, the rights of
 the individual, or both.
 In the first category are crimes
 against the divine, called Hudud crimes.
 These are crimes against God's rights
 because they harm one of the public
 interests of society, such as security,
 property, personal reputation, public
 religious order, psychological welfare, or
 the moral conduct of individuals.
 There are seven categories of Hudud
 crimes subject to fixed legal penalties set
 by God. These seven types of crimes are
 theft, slander, adultery, highway
 robbery, drinking alcohol, transgression,
 and apostasy.
 The penalties for such crimes are
 mentioned in the Koran or in the
 tradition of the prophet Mohammed,
 called the Sunna. Nobody has the
 authority to increase or reduce the
 penalties for these crimes, not even the
 victim. The victim has no authority to
 pardon or forgive such a crime because
 they are against the rights of God and
 the welfare of the society as a whole and
 the penalty must therefore be applied
 without any change. The victim must
 report the crime to the authority
 concerned. Everyone shares in the
 obligation to maintain peace in the
 society.
 Penalties for the seven types of
 Hudud crimes are, briefly, as follows:
 Theft
 The penalty for theft is to sever the
 right hand of the thief. A requirement
 for applying this punishment is that the
 thief intended to acquire the victim's
 property without his consent and the
 property was taken from its place. The
 thief must also have broken into a safe
 or other type of money container.
 Furthermore, the property stolen must
 be of value in Islam. Amputation of the
 hand is not applicable for stealing
 property which is not valued in Islam,
 such as alcohol or pork.
 Stolen property should reach the
 minimum, value which is called Nissab,
 in order to apply the penalty of
 amputation. If the value of the stolen
 property is less than the stated
 s11(1 I i()Q,
 IcatI,()IL
 minimum, the thief should be punished
 under another category of penalties,
 called Taazir. The hand should not be
 severed unless the stolen property is
 owned by others at the time of the theft.
 If it is proven that the property is owned
 by the offender, the penalty will not be
 imposed.
 "Islamic" jurists have mentioned
 several cases in which this penalty is
 avoided or does not apply, such as when
 there is doubt about the crime. In that
 case, if necessary, the thief will be
 punished under Taazir.
 Slander
 The penalty for slander, which in
 Islam is called Kathf, is flogging eighty
 times. Slander means falsely accusing
 someone of adultery or defamation of a
 married woman.
 Adultery
 The penalty for adultery, or Zeno as it
 is called in Islam, for an unmarried
 person is flogging a hundred times. The
 penalty for a married person is also
 fogging a hundred times as well as
 stoning. In order for the penalty to be
 applied, the crime must be witnessed by
 four eyewitnesses or one or the other of
 parties must make a confession.
 Highway Robbery
 The penalty for highway robbery, or
 Haraba as it is called in Islam, is
 execution or crucifixion, the amputation
 of opposite hands and feet, or exile from
 the land. These punishments are applied
 in accordance with the circumstances of
 each crime.
 Drinking Alcohol
 The penalty for drinking alcohol is
 flogging or whipping eighty times, as
 agreed upon by the majority of Islamic
 jurists.
 Transgression
 Transgression, which is called Baghi
 in Islam, means revolting against the
 legitimate leader, who is referred to in
 Islam as the Imam. The penalty for this
 crime is to fight transgressors with
 armed forces until they surrender or are
 defeated. If any one of them is killed in
 the fight, he will be considered as having
 received his legal penalty.
 Apostasy
 The penalty for apostasy, which is
 called Ridda in Islam, is death. Apostasy
 means renouncing Islam by word or
 deed; denying the existence of God, the
 prophets, and the angels; or renouncing
 any part of the Koran.
 Generally, the penalties of Hudud are
 only intended to deter those who have a
 tendency to commit crimes or those who
 are easily tempted to do so. In most
 cases, such people can only be restrained
 by severe penalties.
 God has explicitly forbidden adultery
 and established a severe penalty for it.
 However, God has permitted the Muslim
 man to marry two, three, or four wives
 on the condition that he treats each of
 them fairly and equally.
 To prevent robbery, God has required
 the establishment of a public treasury of
 money collected from zakah, which is the
 religious tax for Muslims, and the
 proceeds of natural resources to help the
 disabled, the sick, the old, and the poor.
 Such rights are not restricted only to
 Muslims, but apply to Christians and
 Jews, referred to in Islam as Ahl
 el-Zemma (people of the book), who live
 in Muslim countries and in return pay a
 capital tax to enjoy safety and
 protection. This tax is called Jizya.
 Islamic legislation does not sever the
 hand of the robber who has stolen
 because he is hungry or in need, because
 in those cases the blame would be
 attributed to the injustice of society or
 the ruler. In such instances, the violator
 would be punished by one of the Taazir
 penalties.
 An example of the effectiveness of the
 Hudud penalty against robbery is Saudi
 Arabia's, The Higas, which was one the
 worst places for violent crimes and
 robbery. When Saudi Arabia applied
 Hudud penalties for crimes against
 property and for highway robbery, and
 those crimes ceased and criminal gangs
 were disbanded. Saudi Arabia is now a
 country in which theft and highway
 robberies rarely occur. During the last
 twenty-five years there were only
 sixteen amputations.
 This is significant evidence that
 imprisonment may be an inadequate
 sanction. The only remedy may to be
 enforce the sentence of amputation
 ordained by God in the Koran. We can
 reach the same conclusion if we analyze
 the other penalties of Hudud crimes.

 QUESAS AND DIYYA CRIMES
 Quesas and Diyya crimes are against
 "the rights of the individual."
 The word Quesas means equality or
 equivalence. A person who commits a
 Quesas crime will be punished in the
 same way and by the same means that
 he used in harming other persons.
 The crimes calling for retribution,
 Quesas, and compensation, Diyya,
 involve homicide, bodily injury, or other
 forms of harm committed against the
 physical security of the individual. They
 are labeled as such because the
 punishment imposed is either a
 retributive penalty equal to the injury
 inflicted on the victim or takes the form
 of pecuniary compensation (ransom) for
 the victim's injuries. Compensation is
 imposed only if retribution is not
 executable or if the victim waives his
 right to demand it.
 Similar to crimes of Hudud, offenses
 of Quesas (retribution) and Diyya
 (compensation) are also prescribed by
 the Koran and the Sunna. They differ in
 that the victim or the political authority
 of the state may not grant pardon for
 crimes of Hudud however the victim or
 his legal guardians, on the other hand,
 may do so in cases of retribution and
 ransom. Penalties may not be mitigated,
 aggravated, or suspended; however, if
 the victim or his guardians waive the
 retribution or penalty ransom claim, the
 applicable verdict is left to the discretion
 of the court.
 These crimes are subject to a penalty
 that safeguards the rights of the
 individual victim. The penalty takes
 into consideration the harm and damage
 which the criminal inflicted upon the
 victim.
 Crimes of Quesas and Diyya are:
 ? Murder
 ? Voluntary killing
 ? Intentional physical injury or
 maiming
 ? Unintentional physical injury or
 maiming
 Quesas is imposed only for crimes of
 murder and intentional physical injury
 or maiming. For the other crimes
 mentioned compensation, Diyya is
 applied.
 Islamic legislation gives the victim a
 lot of liberty in dealing with this type of
 crime. It makes him a decision maker in
 assigning the penalty, since he can
 request its infliction, request a
 compensation, Diyya, or give a complete
 pardon. In the event the victim gives
 pardon, the ruler may still punish the
 criminal according to Taazir in order to
 uphold the rights of society.
 Generally, however, the crimes of
 Quesas and Diyya are punished by
 retribution or legal compensation.
 Crimes of this kind allow only the victim
 or his representatives the right to
 prosecute the criminal; the public
 authority has no power to intervene as it
 does in Western law.
 This method of punishment provides
 for both individual and general
 deterrence and reparation to the victim
 or his avenger who terminates the
 conflict between the criminal and the
 injured party.
 Voluntary homicide, with or without
 premeditation, is normally punished by
 retribution. However, with the consent
 of the victim's representatives, it may be
 punished by legal compensation, Diyya.
 Assault resulting in unintentional
 homicide i.e., blows and wounds inflicted
 voluntarily without the intention of
 causing death but having actually
 caused death, is punished by Diyya.
 The right given to the victim in
 crimes of intention whether, they are
 against person or body, is the right of
 Quesas. This right, as was previously
 mentioned, is based on equalizing the
 criminal act and the penalty to be
 inflicted. If the criminal is aware that
 his punishment will equal his crime, he
 should refrain from committing the
 crime.
 Although Quesas is the penalty for
 intentional crimes, the Islamic
 legislation gives the victim the right to
 change the penalty from Quesas to
 Diyya. In this event, the right of penalty
 is the responsibility of the society and
 the ruler can impose Taazir penalty
 upon the criminal in accordance with the
 crime committed.
 In unintentional crimes, whether
 against the person or his body, the right
 of the victim is compensation, Diyya.
 Islamic legislation also grants the victim
 the right to pardon the criminal
 completely. If the victim uses this right,
 the ruler or judge can punish the
 criminal by a Taazir penalty in
 accordance with the crime he has
 committed.
 Taazir Crimes
 Islamic legality is most flexible in the
 case of Taazir offenses, which are
 offenses left undetermined by religious
 law. In this category, the designation of
 acts as criminal and the assigning of
 penalties to be inflicted are left to the
 discretion of the judge or public
 authority.
 Taazir offenses are the necessary
 complement of Hudud and Quesas.
 Islamic legislation does not clearly
 identify the offenses of Taazir. However,
 it is obvious from various Islamic
 sources that for offenses of Hudud, the
 community is expected to penalize.
 According to El-Mawardi's definition,
 Taazir means inflicting penalties for
 errors which are unpunished by Hudud.
 Theoretically, crimes under this
 category are those acts which bring
 injury to the social order as a result of
 the trouble they cause. The divine notion
 of Taazir left the exact determination to
 the community and its representatives
 in order to allow for changes over time
 according to the need of the community
 and to enable their application in any
 society by any judge at any time or place.
 God and his messenger called upon
 all Muslims to lead a proper life and to
 forbid indecency, and they both trusted
 the Islamic community to understand
 this and constantly strive for better
 implementation.
 Taazir gives the community an
 important role by engaging its
 representatives in the elaboration and
 application of the principles of Islamic
 laws.
 The sovereign or public authority and
 the individual judge have the flexibility
 to determine a range of criminal acts
 and their penalties beyond those which
 the Divine God has specified. However,
 those representatives have to maintain
 the fundamental principles of legality in
 Islamic Law.

 Victimization in Ireland
 The Economic and Social Research
 Institute (ESRI) of Dublin, Ireland, has
 announced the release of a monograph
 entitled Crime Victimization in the
 Republic of Ireland by Richard Breen
 and David B. Rottman. The paper
 reports the findings of the 1982/83 ESRI
 Crime Victimization Survey, the first
 such comprehensive survey carried out
 in the Republic of Ireland. Between
 October 1982, and October 1983, a
 national sample of 8,902 individuals was
 asked whether they had been the victim
 of any one or more of six specified crimes
 during the preceding twelve months.
 The report addresses such topics as "The
 Overall Level of Crime," "Comparisons
 with Other Countries," and "The Distri-
 bution of Victimization Risk." For infor-
 mation write: ESRI, Registered Office,

 land.
 Fear of Crime
 Report Available
 Fear of crime is a pressing social
 problem in many communities, even
 where the risks of crime are relatively
 low. Citizens withdraw into their homes,
 afraid to venture onto the street. Busi-
 nesses unwilling to invest in neighbor-
 hoods reduce job prospects for residents.
 But, perhaps most important, the social
 structure of neighborhoods suffers: resi-
 dents become suspicious of their neigh-
 bors and are unwilling to establish the
 social networks that are the best defense
 against crime.
 In many ways, fear of crime is as
 important a problem for the police as
 crime itself. In Baltimore County, since
 1981, a special police unit--the Citizen
 Oriented Police Enforcement unit
 (COPE)--, has been successful in
 addressing the problem.
 A publication describing the COPE
 experience, Fighting Fear, is available
 from the Police Executive Research
 Foundation, 2300 M Street, NW, Suite
 910, Washington, D.C. 20037.
 Prison Construction
 Faced with a critical shortage of space
 in jails and prisons for housing the
 nation's inmates, corrections officials
 and policymakers have recognized the
 need for expanding capacity. The
 National Institute of Justice is gather-
 ing information about new ways to build
 jails and prisons at reduced time and
 construction costs.
 New Construction Methods for Cor-
 rectional Facilities is the first in a new
 series of construction bulletins that
 addresses the growing problem of jail
 crowding. This bulletin focuses on the
 extent of jail and prison crowding and
 the excessive costs currently required to
 build new facilities. It provides case
 studies of how three states--Virginia,
 California, and Florida--are pioneering
 ways of dealing with the problem, and it
 outlines new methods of construction
 that have significantly reduced the time
 and cost associated with construction.

 tion Methods for Correctional Facilities

 This introduc-
 tory text is organ-
 ized around the
 concept of correc-
 tions as an enter-
 prise in order to
 discuss the various
 aspects and context
 of corrections. Much
 more than the study
 of institutions and programs, corrections
 is the study of of the people immersed in
 the correctional enterprise. This book
 emphasizes the dynamic and human
 facets of the correctional enterprise,
 showing that it is a composite of large
 and small organizations administered by
 various levels of government seeking to
 achieve complex and sometimes com-
 peting goals through professional and
 nonprofessional employees who are put
 in contact with one another and in direct
 authority over offenders. The authors
 believe that this conceptualization will
 help readers understand this dynamic
 yet complex field both now as students
 and in the future as correctional
 researchers or practitioners and as
 members of the polity.
 Clear and Cole explain that correc-
 tions is more than a process of adminis-
 tering the criminal sanction, more than
 the practices used to punish offenders,
 and more than just a concern with the
 operations of jails and prisons. By look-
 ing at corrections as an enterprise, the
 authors use the contributions of several
 disciplines; i.e. history, political science,
 psychology and law to enhance and
 develop to theories and practices used in
 the field.
 The authors feel that students usu-
 ally get lost in their attempt to under-
 stand corrections because the field takes
 so many forms with such a large number
 of programs, facilities, and services. This
 book ties all these different areas
 together.
 Clear and Cole have also built into
 their book many pedagogical elements
 that not only clarify and reinforce con-
 cepts but involves the reader and bring
 the subject alive with biographical
 sketches of the major figures in correc-
 tions, boxed materials that include
 excerpts from the printed media, work
 perspectives that include correctional
 practitioners and offenders describing
 their roles and views, and an excellent
 glossary. Also each chapter begins with
 an Outline and concludes with a Sum-
 mary, Discussion Questions, and Sug-
 gestions for Further Reading.
 Ed Belles
 Mark Baker asks
 what is it like to be
 a cop; to risk your
 life at a job most
 people wouldn't
 take for triple the
 salary? For answers
 he went beyond
 crime statistics and
 sociological studies;
 beyond the flat cardboard characters of
 most fiction, behind the stone wall of
 "press releases police administrators
 pile between the public and the cops." He
 wanted to find out why cops become cops
 and how they do their jobs; whether our
 image of the police square with their
 reality; how do they see themselves?;
 and how do they see us?
 The author admits that his research
 is hardly the scientific approach. Statis-
 tics are not cited and there remain
 unresolved contradictions. Without try-
 ing to authenticate the stories told him
 he trusted his instincts and relied on the
 belief that the majority of people will not
 deliberately lie when they have so little
 at risk. Baker interviewed more than
 100 police officers across the country, in
 big cities and small towns, white and
 black, female and male, rookie and vet-
 eran. He interviewed them at every con-
 ceivable setting. Baker was accepted by
 his subjects and did a good job at win-
 ning the confidence of his informants.
 There are tales of heroism, corrup-
 tion, and brutality. Here are idealism
 and selflessness, fear and anxiety, prej-
 udice and cynicism. The cops that Baker
 writes about take us into their private
 and personal worlds to tell us what it
 feels like to shoot someone or to be shot
 at. They describe the boredom and
 tedium of their jobs as well as those
 unforgettable few moments of horrify-
 ing, heart-stopping danger. They tell us
 what they think of themselves, their fel-
 low officers, criminals and the citizens
 they protect. The cops speak for them-
 selves.
 With blunt honesty and graphic
 details, the police officers in COPS tell
 their own stories in their own words.
 They reveal their fear, their frustrations
 and their occasional triumphs.
 Emotional and compelling, COPS
 gives us a portrait not only of the police
 but of American society. With the rich
 variety of police officers speaking in
 their own voices, it may offer us the
 truest picture of police life that we will
 probably ever have.
 This book repre-
 sents many per-
 spectives in the field
 of sexual violence.
 The authors have
 made substantial
 contributions.
 The  book  is
 divided into five
 sections, with a
 total of twenty-five papers. Part I
 includes two chapters that provide both
 the historical background and current
 efforts and products from federal initia-
 tives in the rape victimology field.
 Part II, "Victims," includes chapters
 on victims' needs, the impact of the rape,
 and the various population groups. This
 section presents research findings and
 raises questions for further study on the
 impact of victimization.
 Part III, "Family and Legal Response
 to the Victim," includes chapters on
 family response to rape and the response
 of the criminal justice system. It reviews
 the family impact to a victimized family
 member and the manner in which the
 legal systems (criminal justice and civil)
 have responded over the decade.
 Part IV is a discussion of "The
 Aggressor," and presents a wide range of
 research expertise not only in viewing
 the aggressor from many perspectives,
 but also in studying the treatment
 approaches and new investigative tech-
 niques for the apprehension of suspects.
 Part V, "Mass Media, Prevention, and
 the Future," includes four chapters that
 emphasize that the goal of most research
 in rape and sexual assault, whether
 explicit or implicit, is to stop sexual vio-
 lence.
 The book's editor, Dr. Ann Wolbert
 Burgess says that "the first decade of
 serious research in the field of rape vic-
 timology has provided some initial
 insights as to the victims, the aggressor
 and the nature and extent of the crime of
 rape and sexual assault within a cul-
 tural context. As we move toward the
 twenty-first century, one goal is to
 reduce the number of victims in an
 appreciable way. I hope that some of the
 research findings in this volume will
 assist in that goal."

 a forum for argumentation and debate,
 and present the diversity of views on a
 particular subject.
 William Geller, the editor of this
 lengthy, but informative, treatise,
 brings together under one cover a veri-
 table who's who in law enforcement. The
 list of writers include practitioners, aca-
 demics, researchers, and critics. Indeed,
 the reader not familiar with at least 90
 percent of the authors does not know
 much about the contemporary issues
 facing law enforcement.
 The book consists of eight parts,
 ranging from the chief as policymaker to
 the issue of professionalism. In between
 one wades into some fascinating essays
 on such subjects as the media, police
 discipline, the law and the lawyers,
 unions, crime control, and the chief and
 the community.
 It was impossible for this reviewer to
 pick out a "favorite" piece, for the range
 of material is fascinating. In some
 measure, it may be argued that many of
 the writers represent the "new school" of
 police management, as characterized by
 an interest in education, research, and
 professionalism. But, this new school is
 now over twenty years old, and in Police
 Leadership we find some of the pioneers
 as well as the current advocates. There
 are working chiefs, like Al Andrews, Lee
 Brown, Tony Bouza, Joe McNamara,
 George Napper, to name a few, as well as
 former practitioners like Patrick Mur-
 phy, Wayne Kerstetter, and Hubert
 Williams.
 For the police professional the book is
 mandatory, and any one interested in
 the world of policing shouldn't be with-
 out it.                       R. Hurley

 enough madmen trying to do that. What
 I want is to share with the reader my
 experiences under the Soviet system; to
 tell the truth about it as I lived it; to
 inform the public of Soviet designs, and
 to warn of the dangers they present to
 the world. In so doing I hope also, in
 however small a way, to help the Soviet
 people eventually find their way to lib-
 erty." Breaking With Moscow is an
 extraordinary story of the inner work-
 ings of the Kremlin. The author is the
 highest ranking Soviet official ever to
 defect from the USSR (at the time he
 defected, he was Under Secretary Gen-
 eral of the United Nations, and former
 adviser to Soviet Foreign Minister
 Andrei Gromyko).
 In April 1978 Arkady Shevchenko
 sought refuge in the United States, thus
 renouncing what had been a meteoric
 career in the foreign service of the Soviet
 Union. He tells of his inner turmoil
 which began years before his defection,
 doubts about the communist system that
 belied his reputation as a Soviet hard-
 liner and an ardent defender of his
 country's foreign policy. He also divulges
 how, for some years after he approached
 U.S. officials about asylum, he served as
 a source of information, as a "reluctant
 spy" (this is the title of the book's first
 chapter), transmitting the contents of
 Soviet diplomatic communications to
 American intelligence agencies.
 Shevchenko describes in absorbing
 detail the inner workings of the top lev-
 els of the Soviet regime. He offers com-
 pelling portraits of Gromyko, Dobrynin,
 Krushchev and Chernenko and other
 Soviet party leaders; accounts of ruth-
 less and malevolent officials of the KGB:

 Coming....
 Police Training in Shanghai
 unit in Israel, and lost. a brother, Lt. Col.
 Jonathan Netanyahu, in the raid on
 Entebbe to rescue hostages in 1976. The
 book is a compendium of essays and
 short "think" pieces on the subject of
 terrorism.
 If there is a central theme to the book
 it is that terrorism is a form of warfare
 pitting the "the forces of civilization and
 the forces of barbarism." It is a book
 written for a general audience, although
 there are numerous articles which will
 be of interest to the student of terrorism.
 Of particular interest are sections on
 "Terrorism and the Islamic World." "The
 International Network," and "The Legal
 Foundations for the War Against Terro-
 rism."
 The section on the media and terro-
 rism is not very new, especially given
 the events of the past year in which the
 issue has become a major topic of debate.
 Of more interest is the account of a sym-
 posium which appears as an appendix,
 largely because it offers a dialogue
 among the media and others, many of
 whom are contributers to the book,
 which is illustrative of the issues in this
 area.
 One of the best articles in the book is
 the one by Netanyahu on the subject of
 terrorists as freedom fighters; he aims
 directly at those who favor mediation
 and negotiation with known terrorists,
 be they countries or individuals. His
 view stresses courage and determination
 as a means of stopping terrorism. "For
 the Terrorist, there can be no hiding
 places." he notes.
 In the complexities of today's world
 much of the argument will be viewed as
 simplistic, but there is also the advan-
 tage of having placed on the table a
 position which can be subject to debate,
 criticism, and hopefully the development
 of rational policy. The book falls far
 short of being an operational plan for the
 defeat of terrorism, which its title
 implies, but it makes a significant con-
 tribution to helping understand a phe-
 nomenon which will be with us for some
 time to come.                Dick Ward

 Hong Kong Brew
 You can eat well in Hong Kong,
 anything from multi-course Chi-
 nese banquets served in replicas of
 imperial palaces to the elegant
 veal at the New World Hotel's
 Promenade Restaurant. But when
 the food, the decor, and the calories
 become overwhelming, head for a
 pitcher of beer and a dish of Sin-
 gapore fried noodles at the White
 Stag.
 The White Stag is a Chinese
 pub. Dark and wonderfully cool on
 even the hottest August afternoon,
 it offers a moment of quiet and a
 meal or snack at almost any hour.
 Located near Kowloon Marco Polo
 Hotel and across from the Ocean
 Terminal shopping complex, it is
 almost hidden in the welter of
 small shops and craftsmen's
 premises that surround it.
 Once past the entrance, with its
 crude but appealing carved stag,
 you can decide whether to sit at
 the bar or in one of the booths lin-
 ing the wall.
 The White Stag's main claim to
 fame (such fame as it has) is an
 impressive array of beer, repre-
 senting most corners of the world.
 Try a San Miguel from the Philip-
 pines (much better than the San
 Miguel brewed anywhere else) or a
 full-bodied dark beer from Ger-
 many. Or, if you are hot and
 thirsty after a day of shopping,
 sightseeing, or international
 wheeling and dealing, order the
 draft beer that comes in tall cool
 pitchers.
 When you are ready to eat, you
 will be brought a short menu.
 Order the Singapore fried noodles.
 The White Stag doesn't serve
 desserts, but don't let that worry
 you. A perfectly acceptable ice
 cream cone can be picked up at the
 Seven-Eleven shop next door.

 MGT. INSTITUTE
 The Police Executive Research
 Forum has begun accepting appli-
 cations for the sixth Senior Man-
 agement Institute for Police. The
 Institute is designed to provide
 senior police managers with the
 type of education and training
 available at the nation's best
 graduate-level business and public
 administration schools using a
 faculty from the most prestigious
 of these schools.
 "We in police management
 have much to learn from the suc-
 cessful practices of the public and
 private sector administrator and
 this program makes available ele-
 ments of the best management
 education and training currently
 offered in these fields," said Neil
 Behan, Forum President and Chief
 of Baltimore County (MD) Police
 Department.
 "The Senior Management
 Institute for Police is a demanding
 three-week course taught by fac-
 ulty predominantly from Harvard
 University", said Peter White, the
 Forum's Acting Executive Direc-
 tor. "The success of the program
 over the last four years and the
 benefits it provided to both the
 participants and their depart-
 ments has convinced us that the
 program should be continued. Its
 business orientation is unique to
 police management training and
 fills an important void."
 Tuition for the three-week
 course is $3,000, which covers
 room and board, and all course
 materials. Transportation and
 incidental expenses must be

 INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: THE
 DOMESTIC RESPONSE brings together
 a group of experts who represent the worlds
 of the practitioner, the researcher, the aca-
 demic, and the policymaker. The three-day
 symposium will provide an overview of
 international terrorism and its impact or
 potential impact on a country.
 By design, the symposium is broadly
 based, representing the first in a series of
 policy-making conferences aimed at sen-
 ior level practitioners and researchers
 who are facing these problems on a daily
 basis. It will be of value to senior govern-
 ment officials, elected officials, city man-
 agers, police and justice officials, and
 researchers who are in need of informa-
 tion from experts.
 The threat of terrorism has never been
 greater, and most officials are not familiar
 with the policy issues, the practical day-
 to-day decision making problems during
 an event, or the capabilities available to
 deal with a serious threat.
 The speakers selected to participate
 have been drawn from around the world,
 and represent people who are knowledge-
 able about the problems associated with
 the threat of or the impact of terrorism.
 Participants will receive printed
 material prior to the conference, and pro-
 ceedings will be published.
 The three-day symposium, which begins
 on Sunday evening, August 24, 1986, and
 ends at noon on Wednesday, August 27,
 1986, is being offered in conjunction with a
 conference on organized crime -running
 from Wednesday afternoon, August 27,
 through Saturday, August 29. Persons
 wishing to attend both meetings will be
 eligible for a reduced fee.
 ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE
 UNITED STATES: A STATUS
 REPORT is a major conference bringing
 together experts from throughout the
 country to discuss the present and future
 of organized crime in the United States.
 Participants will review the work of the
 President's Commission on Organized
 Crime, and members of the Commission
 will discuss their findings.
 The conference will involve plenary
 sessions on major issues raised by the
 Commission as well as individual sessions
 on criminal organizations. The business of
 organized crime (gambling, drugs, extor-
 tion, labor and business racketeering) will
 be viewed from the perspective of investi-
 gating and prosecuting organized crime.
 This will include issues involving electric
 surveillance, use of informants, policy and
 legislation, and the RICO statute.
 There will also be a general discussion
 on the role of the media in the control of
 organized crime with journalists from
 throughout the United States.
 Formal and informal gatherings will
 provide participants with opportunities to
 interact and dialogue with others inter-
 ested in the field of organized crime.
