 world history." Secretary Hilsman, a former
 World War II guerrilla fighter himself, stresses
 at this form of "hidden aggression" poses a
 hreat to the entire Free World-that the Com-
 unists see guerrilla wars in Africa, Asia, and
 atin America as the best way to expand their
 mpires with the least risk. To meet this exported
 ggression effectively, Secretary Hilsman says:
 We must adopt the methods of the guerrilla
 himself-the very tactics our ancestors learned
 from the Indians.
 Our long-range goal must be "nation-build-
 ing"-aid which includes the many things an
 American pioneer village needed.
 The really important appeal of the West is
 the respect for the individual which is built
 into Western culture.

 Would you subscribe to this definition?
 That  is a  very reasonable         definition, par-
 ticularly as applied to the liar East  namely, the
 Philippines, Malaya, and currently Vietnam. But
 I would broaden it slightly by stating that the real
 problem is one of extending government control to
 areas where governments have never had control
 throughout history. In a broader sense this means
 providing government services to the villages,
 knitting the people into the fabric of the whole
 community and national life.
 I n Southeast Asia today, there is no pervasive
 national spirit as we know it. The villagers in the
 back country still feel no deep loyalty to their
 government, which seems much further from them
 than ours does from us. Since most of the villagers

 Hower, prosperity cannot be imposed by an
 tside ag'incy. Any significant change must be

 c eati'4ty of man may flourish.
 s a result, the ultimate good of the A1lia. ce for
 rogress will be put off further into the irl'Lure.
 Productivity and Diversific Lion
 The third element of our over-a i'strategy must
 e a better approach to the problems of produc-
 ivity and diversification. To .tain the capital
 oods necessary for industrialisation, Latin Amer-
 an nations must expand th it dollar volume of
 xports. Nearly all these.' countries, however,
 erive 50 per cent or more;bf their exchange earn-
 gs from only one or tw/ commodities. A few are
 lmost entirely dependent on one commodity and
 hey suffer severely when the international price
 evels fluctuate. So until Latin America can
 iversify its export commodities and other goods,
 t is likely to continue to suffer from the world
 arket price fluctuations which have been so
 ommon over the last decade.
 Both exports and the general standard of living
 n Latin America can be improved greatly if
 hich has contributed so much to our own growrlr
 nd strength, then Latin American policies 4ch
 eaken free enterprise are likely to predomiate.
 efend and endorse the free enterprise systeWf _
 Since 1958 U.S:-rivate investment in Latin
 America has fallenff to practically nothing.
 esides the decline in''foreign investment, native
 atin Americans have widrawn an estimated 10
 illion dollars capital and`?ipped it off to Europe
 nd the U.S. Next to the prence of communism
 i  Cuba, the hemisphere's west problem is this
 ight of capital.
 Not only Latin Americans, but often some in
 e U.S., appear to lack appreciation of the value
 private enterprise in the foreign mair.4et. In the
 ice of a barrage of propaganda against fr,;ee enter-
 rise, it is difficult for private business}nen in
 atin America to operate and make the impisitant
 retribution of which they are capable. Arid, if
 ublic spokesmen for the United States do rte
 methods are applied to agriculture. Raid reform
 programs, in particular, must be cexered around
 increased productivity  and not. 'around  frac-
 tionalizing and splintering prodi. ion limits.
 Local Govertu ent
 The fourth element in.,: ur broader strategy
 must be to encourage soulocal government. Our
 government-to-governna.'ht aid programs in Latin
 America have been c  ied out primarily at the
 level of the national,iivernments, and hence have
 given an overemphAis to centralized government
 -to the neglect a~ local government.
 Traditionally local and state governments in
 Latin Americk have been assigned a minor role-a
 factor whiph~ has dampened the economic and
 social development of these countries. The de-
 velopmea of sound local government should be
 encour ged, particularly since an untapped source
 of rehue is readily available to them in the form
 of property tax.
 Mobilize Our Best Minds
 Professor William Stokes, at our Center's
 Conference on National Security, noted that we
 ought to be concerned not only with what we are
 against, with prohibiting further encroachments
 of Marxism-Leninism, and eliminating what is
 already there. We must also concern ourselves
 with "the alternative attitudes and values, with
 the 'alternative economic concepts and ideas, and
 with  he alternative political methods, forms of
 organization, and procedures."
 He is right. We have not done nearly enough to
 mobilize our best minds and skills within this
 country-experts in land productivity, taxation,
 industrial pioneering, local management, educa-
 tion-to establish `rapport with key individuals
 and groups in Latin America.
 To summarize: our minimum strategic objective
 is to thwart and eliminate Egmmunism from the
 hemisphere as an alien and intolbCable system. Our
 larger objectives are manifold, 'but a first step
 toward them is to establish a nationa`4 riority to
 marshal the best people we have in searchhpf ways
 to share with our Latin American neighbof's,,the
 lessons of our own successful experiences. Tlie,.
 the Alliance becomes one for true knowledge out
 of which can spring the climate for progress-not
 of totalitarianism such as the Soviets seek, but of
 creativity, initiative, and self-reliance.

 make nearly all the material goods they use, they
 have relatively little commercial, political, or
 psychological contact with other villages or the
 provinces around them.
 In such circumstances, there does not have to
 be a basic discontent with the government for a
 guerrilla unit. to thrive. It is just a question of
 the villagers' isolation.
 Recently, in Northeast Thailand, a government
 team visited 40 villages  not particularly isolated
 ones, either. In 10 of them the people had never
 seen a government official -no policemen, no
 firemen, no health inspectors, no one.
 In villages like these, it is relatively easy for an
 outside subversive power to recruit young men for
 guerrilla  bands  by  simply  promising  sheer
 adventure, just to get away from the boring,
 monotonous tasks of an agricultural life.
 For example, in my person.4l experience with
 the OSS in Burma duriug World War II, we

 found only about 10 per cent of the people to be
 pro-West. Another 10 per cent were pro-enemy,
 but the rest were either indifferent or else just so
 isolated that they had no ideological convictions
 one way or the other. Yet we were able to recruit
 over 30,000 guerrillas for OSS operations in
 Burma, and in spite of our white faces.
 To draw a parallel with a situation closer to
 home, one may  ask whether the citizens of
 Chicago "supported" the hoodlum gangs which
 flourished during the 1920's. Certainly the shop-
 keeper hit by the protection racket did not support
 the gangs, but he often had no choice except to go
 along with them. The same thing is true in many
 of the isolated villages in some of the under-
 developed areas of the world.
 In the past, you have defined this guerrilla activity in
 Southeast Asia as internal war, or hidden aggression.
 What do these terms imply?

 I Ile      ris  activity in Vietnam is really
 aggression in the truest sense of the word. Over
 the centuries international law has categorized
 aggression as an overt attack. But here we have, as
 President Kennedy has said, "a subterranean
 war," which doesn't fit easily under the doctrines
 of international law.
 I call it hidden aggression, or twilight warfare,
 because it is an attack directed across an inter-
 national boundary. It is clearly an attempt by one
 state to bring down another by exported terror.
 From North Vietnam, the Communists are send-
 ing in trained cadre, propaganda, money, equip-
 ment, and directions to the Viet Cong terrorists in
 South Vietnam. All the while they try to maintain
 the fiction that it is an internal uprising.
 The pattern of the Vietnam war so far has
 followed closely Mao Tse-Tung's three stages of
 guerrilla warfare. In the first stage, sympathizers
 are recruited and indoctrinated, and a base is
 built from which weapons, rice, and other supplies
 can be distributed. The second stage is one of
 terror,  hit-and-run  tactics,  ambushes,  night
 attacks, and assassinations. This is the stage in
 which we are engaged now. Finally, in the third
 stage Mao says there must be a change to a true
 civil war where the terrorist bands are turned into
 conventional armies to fight the regulars by con-
 ventional means. As a practical matter, the Com-
 munists hope to create enough political chaos and
 instability so that the government will fall by a
 coup d'etat, letting them move in and skip the
 third stage.
 We Must Adopt Guerrilla Tactics
 To fight this exported aggression effectively, we
 must adopt the methods of the guerrilla himself--
 the very tactics our ancestors learned from the

 Indians. We must realize that the guerrilla does
 not care about north or south, or east or west. He
 doesn't care about this town or that piece of real
 estate. He lives to fight, to ambush, to kill. His
 only goal is to kill--not to seize and hold territory.
 It is nonsense to assume that regular forces
 trained for conventional war can handle jungle
 guerrillas adequately. Regular forces are essential
 for regular military tasks, but twilight warfare is
 something special. It is a war of shadows in the
 night which calls for radical changes in organiza-
 tion, combat doctrine, and equipment. The main
 ingredients for success are constant patrols, good
 communications, mobility, and a capacity for
 rapid concentration. Our key units might be
 decentralized groups of 50 men, self-reliant and
 able to operate autonomously, fanned out into the
 surrounding countryside.
 Let me again draw on my experience in Burma.
 At  one  stage  my  outfit-consisting  of four
 Americans and 200 Burmese --kept an entire
 3,000-man  Japanese  regiment    marching  and
 countermarching through the mountains far away
 from the front where they would have done more
 good. What we would have feared most would
 have been smaller groups patrolling steadily. The
 Japanese were much better soldiers than our
 guerrillas. They were better trained, tougher, and
 more mobile. But they fought us as if we were
 regular troops. We never tried to take or hold
 ground. We laid ambushes, fired our weapons, and
 ran just as fast as we could. After a month of
 chasing us, this 3,000-man regiment had over a
 hundred casualties; we had only one.
 One of History's Decisive Battles
 Vietnam's twilight war for the villages may yet
 rank as one of the decisive battles of world
 history. In one sense, it is no more or less decisive
 than an effective deterrent against a Korea-type
 war, nor is it more or less decisive than an
 effective strategic nuclear deterrent. However,
 even as we have prepared for both conventional
 and nuclear wars, the Communists have been
 giving increased emphasis to internal warfare. Of
 course, we can take some credit for their change in
 strategy. Our nuclear force build-up has paid off,
 and so have our efforts to build ground forces, our
 alliances, and our sacrifices in Korea.
 Now the Communists are beginning to see possi-
 bilities for guerrilla wars in Africa, Asia, and Latin
 America as the best way to expand their empires
 with the least risk. So the Vietnam war is quite
 decisive, in the first place, because unless we de-
 velop an effective counter there, we may well find
 ourselves in the same difficulty in some of these
 other areas. Secondly, this war is decisive in that

 as muc political an econ m
 e long-range task is nation- building. "
 the steps needed to fight it are the very steps
 needed for building the new nations of the world
 into independent, self-sustaining states. Our job in
 Vietnam is as much political and economic as it is
 military- the long-range task is nation-building.
 What are the steps involved in nation-building?
 To become a stable nation, Vietnam needs much
 more than dams, power stations, steel mills, and
 other giant foreign aid projects which will have to
 come sooner or later. This sort of foreign aid is
 important, of course, but on a longer term basis. In
 the short term, these people need more simple aid
 such as communication routes, so that goods and
 services can flow freely from village to village
 throughout the country. There must be a way for
 information about the needs of the people to flow
 upward, and a way for government services to
 flow downward to answer these needs. They need
 health programs, police security, educational sys-
 tems, economic help, sewer systems- the very
 things many an American pioneer village needed
 over 100 years ago.
 Strategic Hamlet Program
 An important part of this nation-building pro-
 gram is to provide the villagers with the physical
 security so necessary to peaceful progress. This is
 what the strategic hamlet program does. We are
 helping the villagers ring their villages with barbed
 wire, much as our frontier towns were protected
 with stockades. Then 20 or 30 in a village of 200
 are trained to use weapons such as hand grenades,
 shotguns, and carbines. And they are given a
 radio with which they can contact province head-
 quarters for help if they are attacked by a large
 band of terrorists.
 But the strategic hamlet program involves far
 more than just physical security. It is also a
 vehicle for getting government services to the
 people to help enlist popular support for the
 government. And as the government becomes
 more popular, and as more villages are secured,
 the Viet Cong will be isolated more and more from
 their key sources of supply -the villages of the
 back country. No longer will marauding bands of
 five or six guerrillas be able to walk into villages
 and either seize or buy rice.
 If they can't get into the villages, and if they are
 occasionally  ambushed  themselves,  will  the  Viet
 Cong then start to wither?
 That's right. By cutting off this important
 supply line to the villages and by keeping them on
 the move, we will begin to make the guerrillas
 suffer from lack of food, from hunger, and from
 discomfort. They will begin to dry up.
 Of course, we are not at that stage yet in
 Vietnam. However, we have come a long way and
 have made much progress recently. During the
 last half of 1962, outlying villages containing
 roughly half a million people were made secure by
 the government, bringing the share of rural popu-
 lation in secured villages to about 51 per cent. The
 Viet Cong controls about eight per cent.
 This still leaves around 40 per cent of the
 rural population unsecured. It is to this group that
 the government must extend its services and
 control in the next phase.
 In the mountain regions during the last year we
 have helped the Vietnamese train over 37,000
 Montagnard tribesmen in the use of simple weap-
 ons, how to set up village defenses, and how to
 patrol areas between villages. But one Special
 Forces team I know of is most proud of a com-
 pletely non-military kind of project-a village
 market. They went to the province capital and
 persuaded a tailor, a tobacco merchant, and a
 general store operator to move to the Montagnard
 village where they were stationed. Then they
 persuaded the villagers in the area to start pro-
 ducing a surplus of what they grow, and to bring
 the excess to the market where they could sell it
 and buy thimbles, needles, thread, pots, pans---
 the instruments for a better life that they could
 never have before.
 This isn't warfare in the usual sense and it isn't
 killing Viet Cong. But it is the real way to fight
 the Communist terror. It is a vital step in nation-
 building, and that is our long-range goal.
 Nation-building in Vietnam involves: (1) guerrilla warfare training, (2) development of strategic hamlets, (3) establishment of v

 Secretary Hilsman, it has been said that the Com-
 munists are offering a "spiritual" challenge to the
 people in Asia, telling them, "We need you desper-
 ately, whoever you are, whatever you can do. Ours
 is the revolution of the future. You can be the liberators
 of mankind."
 In contrast, it has been said that the American ap-
 peal offers no such "cause" but merely a slight ma-
 terial gain through our aid and assistance programs.
 We have been told that there really isn't an "American
 side." Is this theory true, or half-true, or is it com-
 pletely inaccurate or obsolete?
 There is no question in my mind that this
 theory is completely obsolete. In terms of appeals,
 the Communists are not doing at all well. The
 normal Communist ideology does not cut much ice
 anymore. Where they do make headway, they
 capitalize on an appeal to nationalism, or they use
 threats of terror and retaliation.
 The theory about American appeals is also
 obsolete. We have a spiritual appeal that is a truly
 revolutionary one-a government interested in
 the wants and needs of the people. In the past,
 government has usually meant  if anything- an
 official who collects grain or yams and gives
 nothing in return. So we have a revolutionary
 appeal to excite and inspire these people--the
 simple but very effective concept that govern-
 ment exists to serve and protect them.
 In a sense, the whole nation-building program
 has a revolutionary, "spiritual" appeal, not only
 in Vietnam but in all the world's underdeveloped
 areas. This is really the guts of the Alliance for
 Progress  program,  except  that  in  Vietnam
 nation-building must proceed under the guns of
 Communist terrorism. The barbed wire and guns
 of a strategic hamlet program would not be
 needed in a country not under attack as Vietnam
 has been, but the civic action certainly would.
 But the really important appeal of the West is
 the respect for the individual which is built into
 Western Culture. In contrast, the whole Com-
 munist Bloc leans toward a monotonous grayness
 the Tibetans should act like the Chinese, the
 Chinese like the Russians, and the Russians like
 the Poles. There is not the diversity which is
 found in the Free World.
 Sanitized
 What can industry here in the United States do to help
 these countries build their civilizations? For example,
 Dr. Wernher von Braun has said that much of the
 success of the space program has resulted from the
 individual contributions and innovations of private
 industry. He told us that he spends a substantial part
 of his time "trying not to drown in all the many ideas
 which come to us." Do private companies face this
 same kind of challenge in "nation-building programs"
 as they have already faced in aerospace and defense?
 They most certainly do. There are many areas
 of science and technology where new ideas can
 help Vietnam and similar countries to discover
 new approaches to their problems. Right now
 scientists in this country are on the brink of some
 discoveries in genetics which are just as dramatic
 and exciting as the discovery of the nuclear
 reaction. Some of them may help to solve many of
 the tremendous problems in disease, overpopula-
 tion, and food shortages.
 To help break the illiteracy problem we may be
 able to use a communications satellite, providing
 a country with a complete television network
 which could be picked up on television sets
 powered by wood-burning generators. We could
 increase a teacher's exposure a hundred times.
 Chemistry, biology, electronics, physics-every
 science you can name-may have some answers
 if we can get researchers to focus on the problems.
 How optimistic are you that our nation-building pro-
 gram will succeed in Vietnam? Do you have a time-
 goal in months or years?
 Right now about Vietnam I am optimistic-but
 cautiously so. It is not a question of winning a
 battle or defeating an army. It is a question of
 building a nation, and that takes time. So far
 things are going rather well, but we have to think
 in terms of years instead of months. It will be
 some time before you can go anywhere in Vietnam
 with a feeling of complete safety and security.
 Of course all the new nations like Vietnam need
 time. No magic of science can transform their way
 of life overnight. It took seven years to eliminate
 guerrillas in Malaya. It may take more than this
 in Vietnam, or it may take less. But I think time
 is on our side.
