 Zwa eta  g  i a cartel,,  In the scheduled April meeting of nations invo1iTed "Cu
 in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 9 the US delegation
 is expected to ask that Japan be granted "most-favored-nation" treatments
 particularly in regard to textile exports?  Great Britain, Tearful of
 Aiture Japanese competition in the textile field, has indicated that an
 AnglowUS-Japanese agreement must be arranged prior to the GATT conforonce
 _f the UK is to support the US proposal,
 US State Department has circularized its diplomatic and consular
 officers, requesting instances of discrimination against Japanese imports,
 as for example the Australian differential duty on Japanese textiles.
 Such discrimination, if it proves to be appreciable, could endanger Japan?a
 economic rehabilitatiom4
 _&r_eM 4  Communist influences in the Japanese labor picture were       "B"
 highlighted last week, in the homeland by evens at the Teachers  Union
 convention and abroad by an invitation to join the World Federation of
 Trade Unions (WFTU).
 At the 4th Convention of the Japan Teachers& Union, a motion to remove
 support froom the communist-front "League to Protect Democracy", was appro-
 ved by the Central Committee 113 to 62 with 18 abstaining,  This move
 towards the right may have been inspired. by IWANA Masao'S announcement that
 he had joined the Communist Party.  IWA 7Af, a member of the Diet's Upper
 House and an influential union leader, has a radical record that dates
 back to formation of the lot post-war teachers' union, "Zenkyo."  He
 figured in the suceeding conflict between the lef?tt-wing "Zenkyo" and the
 conservative "T okyokyo" teachers' union.  With the merger of the two fac-
 tions in June of 1947. IWANA retained considerable influence.
 Passage of the anti-Cosrnnunist motion may herald another split within
 the Unions. As in other unions, reacting against increased Cost
 influence, this may result in formation of a "Democratization League"
 within the Japan Teachers' Union, which v ill oppose aiy leftist activities
 of the parent body,  The question is which faction will be sufficiently
 strong to force the other into a minority position,
 Internationally, the reported decision of the WFTU Executive Cormittee,
 meeting in Paris, to admit Japanese labor orgraAz tions was warmly welcomed
 by two Ccn mznist-dc nated labor organizations, Sanbetsu and Zenroren.
 The Socialist-influenced So domei, on the other hand, may reject the bid.

 At present, the Republic of Korea fills nearly all such local offices by
 appointment and has no immediate plans for local election,  Southern

 am mission delegates had arrived in Seoul,,  The Ca nis sion will confer
 ralth Republic of Korea officials before acting to implement its mission
 of unifying Korea and observing or making recommendations regarding the
 withdrawal of foreign troops.  Its work will be hampered both by the pro-
 bable refusal of Democratic Peop]ese Republic officiate to deal with the
 Ccm+.tssion and by conflicting viewpoints as to its proper function and
 actions in the south,
 The principal southern issue will arise over the question of
 drawal of US troopsfl  President Rhos will attempt to obtain a Commission
 recommendation in favor of continued US occupation.  In opposition to Rhee,
 as, u army as .+0 younger members of the National Assemb   mar follow the
 lead of ? Vice Speaker Kim Yak Soo in asking the Corr- ission to recommend
 immediate withdrawal of US forces,  Leftists in South Korea, who hitherto
 have been hostile to all MI attempts to m diate in Korean affairs, may
 decide to adopt a temporary line of ostentatious cooperation, in an effort
 to convince the Commission that there  is  no danger of civil war and that
 Korean unity can be peaceably achieved when US troops withdrawn

 is emerging in increasing numbers to assist Government forces in the
 fighting,, particularly in and arraund the important port of Bassein and
 at Insein, 10 miles north of Rangoonn.  It seems likely that similar action
 has been taken by PVO groups throughout Lower Burma and that other Sur-
 mans., Co  anists included, may disreaard their political differences and
 follow the lead of the PVOes in taking up arms against the Karens0

 Secondly, Lt. Gen, Smith Dun, Burmese Commander..in.Chief, has left
 Rangoon for Kalaw, in Northern Burma, ostensibly on sick leave,  Smith
 Dun, a Karen, has been replaced by Bo Nc T'lin, a Burman and Left-'ling
 Socialist.  Smith Dun's departure will probably cause further Karen
 desertions from the Burmese Arty.  Both these developments make the
 possibility of a general, amicable settlement between Karens and Burmans
 increasingly remote.
 Dutch present now Plane  A new scheme for the transfer of Netherlands
 sovereignty to an Tndonesian federation is currently scheduled for dis-
 cussion on the Island of Bangka.  The all-Indonesian meeting is supposed
 to include Republican President Soekarno, Premier Hatta and a delegation
 of Federalists.  If the Bangka conference accepts the Dutch plan (Netbb
 erlands relinquishment of sovereignty within two months to a "Republic
 of the United States of Indonesia"), both Dutch and Security Council
 timetables for elections and the granting of a t ereignty would be c on-
 siderabl,y accelerated.
 Republican leaders, however, view the plan with skepticism, regard-
 ing it as a Dutch device to circumvent the 28 January UN resolution,
 Until recently, they have declined to participate, as individuals, in
 discussions with the Federalists, but have insisted that they be recognized as representatives of a reconstituted Republican clovertnment.
 The Federalists, through whom the Dutch have attempted to win Repub->
 lican support, have shown an unexpected .independance of their own,  They
 have been reluctant to condemn the latest SC resolution and to commit
 themselves to any specific course of- action.t  While certain of the Fed-
 eralists are avowedly pro -Republican, the great majority are anxious to
 stall without committing themselves until it is clear that either the
 Dutch or the Republicans will retain the balance of power in Indonesia.

 Sinkiang to become Soviet buffer,.,  Soviet Ambassador Roshchin's        6.0
 transfer -ta anton, and CIfANG Chih-chung's mission to Tihua, may be
 related in a Soviet maneuver aimed at consolidating Soviet control in
 Sinkiang, thereby realizing a strategic security objective of the
 For the past year Roshchin has been identified with the prospect
 of Soviet mediation in the Chinese civil war.  Last month, when the
 USSR formally declined to mediate, Soviet sources confirmed reports
 that Roshchin would leave presently for Moscow,  last week, however,,,
 Roashchin followed the Chinese Ministry of. Foreign Affairs to Canton,
 the only Ambassador to do no.  It is perhaps implied thereby that Roshchin's
 mediation mission also remains, or that the USSR desires the Chinese
 Government to believe that  Soviet mediation is still possible.  More-
 over? the Chinese Government organs now in Canton are the proper
 authorities for ratifying international ag eemexat
 It is probable that the USSR does not desire a strong China - even
 a Communist China - on the Soviet borders, and therefore is seeking
 to form. a buffer area through Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and Sinkiang,
 The Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 provided for a strong Soviet position in
 Manchuria; although. MAO Tse-tung stated publicly his desire that Outer
 Mongolia be restored to Chine, that area became a Soviet satellite, and
 may draw Inner Mongolia into its orbit; and now the Soviet position in
 Sinkiang should be greatly strengthened by the "local agreement" which
 CHANG has gone to Tihua. to negotiate:,
 The agreement reportedly would grant the Soviet Union mining, trade
 and aviation monopolies in Sinkiang for the next forty to fifty years.
 The mining monopoly would give the Soviets full rights to exploit Sinkiang's
 little-known resources of oil, wolfram and gold.  Oil deposits in Sinkiang
 are rumored to be sufficient to supply the entire Soviet Par East,
 though this would require many years of development.  The mining monopoly
 would also make possible Soviet exploration to check on unconfirmed
 reports of uranium in Sinkiang.
 A Soviet trade monopoly would provide for exchange of Sinkiang's
 raw materials, principally wool, for manufactured goods from the USSR.
 In addition there would be a new civil aviation agreement renewing the
 virtual air monopoly held by the USSR under the Sino-Soviet Aviation.
 Agreement which was denounced by China last September0
 CHANG's mission might well prepare the ground for making a Soviet
 satellite not only of all Sinkiang, but perhaps of parts of Ningxia.,,

 Chinghai, and Kansu.  While the Sinkiang provincial government has long
 desired resumption of trade with the USSR, the present Chinese Govern-
 ment would seem to have little to gain, in that its life expectancy is
 certainly not the 40 or 50 years which the Sinkiang pact envisages.
 Thus the Chinese Government may be seeking, in return for approval of
 the "local agreement," a means for preserving its own life: specifically*
 by Soviet mediation in the civil war.  It is improbable that the USSR
 will or can mediate successfully to that end, but the USSR could ep.sily
 promise to attempt it, and Acting President LI Thuing.jen appears sufficiently
 naive and desperate to accept such a promise,
 The Chinese Communist radio has not yet mentioned the Sinkiang
 negotiations.  Tihua, however, is one of the 16 major centers toshich,
 according to the Communists, the Peiping surrender f ormula will be
 applicable.  Thus the proposed "local agreement," if it were to remove
 Sinkiang from the eventual control of the Chinese Communists, would
 seem to qualify as one of the "traitorous" treaties which the Communists
 have denounced.  It in therefore possible that the USSR and the Chinese
 Communists are plotting. this maneuver in concertz i.,,e., that the USSR
 will promise to attempt mediation, will additionally promise CHANG and the
 Moslem governors of Ningxia  and Chinghai that their authority will be
 preserved, and will then allow the area to pass into Chinese Coimianist
 control.  It seems more likely, however, that the USSR? if not seeking
 direct control of a Northwest "autonomous" regime, is at least seeking
 a position strong enough to permit the Chinese Communists to enter the
 Northwest only on USSR terms,
 The participants in a Soviet   Nationalist agreement, if the
 Chinese Communists were genuinely excluded from it, would obtain widely
 varying returnsz the USSR would get Sinkiang; the Chinese Government -
 a sack of wind; OHANG   a comfortable berth, subject to sudden relocation;
 and the Moslem leaders   continued, although insecure, authority.
 The Chinese Communists would be confronted with a serious dilemma:
 whether to accept in silence this major loss in territory and face, as
 was the case in regard to Outer Mongolia, or to denounce the agreement
 and attempt w with their increased strength since 1945 - to rectify
 it, in which case their relations with their one important international
 friend would be severely compromised.  While a Soviet maneuver in denying
 the Northwest to the Communists or restricting their authority therein
 would certainly increase the chances for Titoism in China, the Soviet
 annexation of the border re-ions would make the fact of Titoism if
 it does appear in China, less dangerous in its effects upon the USSR?

 belie CHEN's claim that circumstances do not permit CHIANG'a return to
 powers, even in Taiwan,, Moreover, CHEN's ruthless character and his
 previous record in military and provincial administration fail to sub-
 stantiate his promise of a competent and popular regime.  Also interesting
 to note are recent public statements of CHANG Chun in Chungking and
 NSUEH Yueh in Canton, similar to those oe the Taiwan Governor, regarding
 the prospect of CHIANC's return.  Alth. rgh these statements may partially
 reflect personal views, it is like';,  Oat they constitute maneuvers

 vital cities of the Yangtze delta when the Nationalists complete the

 command, which at present lacks even a semblance of cohesion  is difficult
 to establish.  Some reports indicate Nationalist combat forces have
 been withdrawn from the Nanking-Shanghai area, while others state
 this movement has included only service troops,  Another  report notes
 that TANG En-po's command--a maximum 150,000 strong--has been tendered
 defense funds by Shanghai groups in the expectation that these forces
 would be employed in the defense of that metropolis.  Still another
 report expresses doubt the the bulk of the city's populace wish to see
 that city envolved in any future fighting..  It is probable that the
 great majority of the NatioiLaliats,, civil and military alike,, have little

 in abruptly terminating the Tientsin rooa ration program by ~~,~
 and distribution of ECA flour stocks appears to have been shortsighted.
 The chief repercussion may be a food shortage accompanied by eratic
 prices until the harvest season,   The Communists have not been sufficiently
 aware that feeding the 2-3 million people in Tientsin and its environs
 entails large-scale food imports and an efficient collection and dis-
 tribution organization.  Primarily because of ECA the people of Peiping
 and Tientsin have become accustomed to a sufficient amount of cheap
 food during the last six months; if the Communists are unt:ble, by transfers
 from food surplus areas, to meet this standard, it will be difficult
 to justify to the people their hostile action toward EC.A..
