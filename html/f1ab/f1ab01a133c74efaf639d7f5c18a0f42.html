 REVIEW OF THE WORLD SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO THE SECURITY
 OF THE UNITED STATES
 12 January 1948
 1. Our reports in this Series have been premised upon the analysis of the world
 situation presented in CIA 1 (26 September 1947), the Summary of which is reproduced
 in the Enclosure.  This analysis has been reviewed and is now generally reaffirmed.
 2. Within the context of the general analysis in CIA 1, the immediate and overrid-
 ing objective of Soviet policy is to defeat the European recovery program without incur-
 ring the risk of war.  Operating principally through local organizations of militant
 Communists, the USSR will seek to accomplish this purpose by:
 a. Direct action designed to disrupt and cripple the economies of pivotal West-
 ern European countries (e.g., by strikes and sabotage) .
 b. Revolutionary activity in Italy, and possibly in France.
 c. Contributory activities, diversionary in effect, but also potentially profitable
 in themselves (e.g., the intensification of revolutionary efforts in Greece and in the
 Far East; aggravation of the Palestine situation).
 3. Since our last report (CIA 3, 17 December 1947) there has been a generally
 favorable trend in Europe, including evidences of (1) an adverse reaction of Western
 European labor to Communist efforts to wreck the European recovery program, (2) the
 remarkable success and increasing stability of the Schuman Government in France,
 and (3) Satellite realization of a present need for economic assistance from the West.
 At the same time there have been an intensification of Communist effort in Greece and
 increasing manifestations of Soviet interest in the Far East.
 4. The immediate prospect is none the less grim.  Increasingly effective Soviet
 coordination and direction of Communist efforts are apparent, as well as preparations
 for concerted offensive action on all European fronts.  An early renewal of a campaign
 of strikes and disorders in Italy is probable, and may develop into an all-out insurrection.
 A similar development may follow in France.     Meanwhile, intensification of Communist
 revolutionary activity in Greece will continue, with increasing Satellite support.
 In the Far East the trend has been consistently favorable to Soviet purposes, and
 present prospects are for its continuance and possible acceleration.
 THE SITUATION IN EUROPE
 5. Labor reaction against Communist policy.  The Communist penetration of or-
 ganized labor and control of the powerful labor federations of France and Italy has
 been a potent weapon in the Kremlin's arsenal, the threat of a general strike being
 Note: A preliminary draft of this report has been furnished to the intelligence organizations
 of the Departments of State, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.

 often more persuasive than the political power of the Communist parties.  The effective-
 ness of this weapon has been seriously impaired, however, by the adverse reaction of
 Western European, particularly French and Italian, workers to the Cominform line and
 to Communist-called strikes designed to serve only Soviet political purposes.
 The strongest manifestation of this worker reaction is the secession movement
 from the Communist-dominated French Confederation of Labor (C.G.T.) and formation
 by the secessionists of a rival federation, the Workers' Force (F.O.), dedicated to "non-
 political legitimate trade-union activity."  The growth of the F.O. has been impressive,
 despite its lack of organization and funds. It may attain a membership comparable
 to that of the C.G.T. within a few months.
 A corresponding tendency exists in Italy, although there has been no formal
 secession as yet from the Italian Confederation of Labor (C.G.I.L.).  A Communist
 order for a general strike would probably precipitate such a movement.
 The Communist position in the British labor movement has never been comparable
 to that in France and Italy.  The recent British Communist adoption of the Cominform
 line, however, has been accepted by the Labor Party as the occasion for a movement
 to eject Communists from key positions in the constituent unions of the Trades Union
 Congress (T.U.C.).
 At the meeting of its Executive Bureau in February the World Federation of Trade
 Unions (W.F.T.U.) may well split on the issue of the European recovery program.  The
 Communists, however, having once had good prospect of using the W.F.T.U. as an
 effective front organization, will do their utmost to evade the issue.
 Meanwhile, the Belgian Federation of Labor has proposed a conference of trade
 unions of the sixteen countries participating in the program with a view to the forma-
 tion of a new international organization based on its support.  This initiative, alarm-
 ing to the Communists, is likely to receive the adherence of important labor
 organizations in all sixteen countries, with the possible exception of Italy, where
 Communists still exercise official control of organized labor.  The British T.U.C., how-
 ever, would postpone action pending developments in the W.F.T.U.  The proposed
 conference has therefore been put off until April.
 6. The United Kingdom.  Encouraging production figures and firmer leadership
 have enhanced the prestige of the Labor Government and improved the morale of the
 British people.  Bevin's foreign policy, characterized by a stiffer attitude toward the
 U.S.S.R. and closer collaboration with the United States, now enjoys nearly universal
 support: the left-wing Labor opposition has subsided except for a few die-hard fellow
 travelers.
 The continuing drain on Britain's gold and dollar reserves, however, is cause for
 grave official concern.  Even if the Cripps production and export plan is fulfilled, the
 United Kingdom (and the entire sterling area) will face a dollar crisis during the
 latter half of 1948 unless further dollar aid is forthcoming.  The solvency of the
 United Kingdom is thus dependent upon early beneficial effects of the European
 recovery program.  If timely and sufficient dollar support does not become available,
 the British must again resort to emergency retrenchments, with serious consequences
 to both domestic stability and overseas commitments.

 7. France.  The Schuman Government has been remarkably successful, not only
 in rallying the French people against Communist-inspired strikes and disorders, but
 also in securing the passage of politically painful fiscal legislation essential to a realistic
 economic recovery program.  It remains to be seen whether these unpopular measures
 can be as successfully executed.  The trend, however, is encouraging with respect to the
 prospects for both economic recovery and a moderate political solution in France.
 De Gaulle has shown himself to be sensitive to the fact that Schuman's success is
 prejudicial to his own prospects, but still appears to be unwilling to seek power and
 responsibility until the difficult winter has passed.  His economic program is an echo
 of Schuman's; he claims only that he could do it better.  In appealing for labor support
 he has offered only the idea of the corporate state, a strange echo of Vichy not likely to
 prove enticing.
 The Communists, despite their great loss of power and prestige, retain dangerous
 capabilities for disrupting French production and economic recovery through strikes and
 sabotage.  It is considered unlikely, however, that they will renew their efforts in this
 direction in the immediate future.
 8. Italy.  The situation is somewhat improved, but still far less secure than that
 in France. The Communist capability to conduct an effective general strike is jeopard-
 ized by the threatened defection of Italian labor from the C.G.I.L.  Recent Communist
 organizational activities and maneuvers would serve as preparations for either an
 insurrectionary attempt or an effort to achieve a political victory in the April elections.
 These alternatives have presumably been under consideration at the Party Congress
 just concluded in Milan.  Undoubtedly the Italian Communist leadership would prefer
 to return to political action.  The decision, however, rests with the over-all strategists
 in the Kremlin.
 It seems probable that a renewal of Communist direct action will occur within a
 month, beginning as a strong campaign of strikes and violence and possibly leading into
 an all-out revolutionary attempt. The Communist capabilities for armed insurrection
 are formidable; they could probably achieve early local successes, especially in North
 Italy.  Unless they received open support from Yugoslavia, however, the Government
 could probably suppress them eventually-but only after a thorough disruption of the
 Italian economy.  If the Communists did succeed in consolidating their control of
 North Italy, outside aid would be required to dislodge them.
 9. Germany.   The break-up of the C.F.M. has as yet produced no major change
 in Soviet policy, which continues to be directed toward the political, economic, and ad-
 ministrative consolidation of the Soviet Zone.  In the Western Zones German politi-
 cians tend to show increased self-assertion, presumably based on the supposition that
 the United States is now committed to rebuilding and developing Western Germany and
 that their support is indispensable.
 10. Austria.  There are indications that the U.S.S.R., if unable to obtain quadri-
 partite agreement on its terms for an Austrian Treaty, may seek to resume bilateral
 negotiations with the Austrian Government, and that the latter, in its anxiety to
 obtain a definitive settlement, may make concessions prejudicial to Austrian
 independence.

 11. The Satellite States.  In dethroning King Michael, the Communists have seized
 a convenient opportunity to further the consolidation of their position in Eastern
 Europe.  There are, however, indications of Satellite realization of a present need for
 economic assistance from the West in view of the inability of the U.S.S.R. to supply
 all their wants.  This economic situation affords the United States some leverage with
 respect to Satellite foreign policy.
 THE NEAR AND MIDDLE EAST
 12. Greece.   Proclamation of the Markos "government" is indicative of a Soviet
 intention to provide increasing moral and material aid to the Greek insurgents through
 the Satellite States, but this intention will be carried out by successive stages with
 careful regard to U.S. reaction and to the avoidance of direct conflict with the United
 States.  The attitude of the United States has already caused the Satellites to hesitate
 in recognizing Markos, at least until the significance of the U.S. position can be esti-
 mated.                             However, barring the unlikely event of Markos' decisive military defeat, the
 Satellites will probably extend to him increasing material aid and eventual recognition.
 The U.S.S.R. itself is unlikely to grant formal recognition to the Markos regime until
 assured that it is capable of winning control of Greece and that to do so will not involve
 the U.S.S.R. in direct conflict with the United States.
 The recent fighting at Konitsa demonstrates that the insurgents are strong enough
 to make dangerous local attacks, and that there are increased central direction and
 coordination of activities on both sides of the border.  The guerrillas cannot yet hold
 open ground, but reports of preparations in Satellite territory suggest plans for the
 occupation and defense of substantial areas in Greece.
 In Athens, the Konitsa crisis has temporarily checked the growth of political dis-
 unity, but inflation continues to undermine the Greek economy.
 13. Turkey.  The Turks, having reduced their armed forces, are increasingly
 alarmed by the course of events in Greece and by the danger of Soviet penetration of
 the Arab States under cover of the Arab-Zionist conflict.  Soviet control of Greece
 and subversion of the Arab States would isolate strategically Turkey and Iran.
 14. Palestine.  Arab opposition to partition, although still largely unorganized, has
 already caused several thousand casualties (including over 500 deaths), millions of
 dollars of property damage, serious disruption of the Palestinian economy (particularly
 in the Jewish communities), and increasing lawlessness among both Arabs and Jews.
 That such consequences should result from relatively little effort is indicative of the de-
 struction which would ensue were the Arab Higher Committee to order all-out offensive
 action with the support of the Arab States.  Although the members of the Arab League
 disagree among themselves as to retaliatory action against the United States for its
 support of partition, they are united in determination to support the Palestinian
 Arabs.  No concerted action is planned until after the British withdrawal.  In the
 face of the existing chaotic situation, the British tend to advance the date of their
 withdrawal, reducing the time available to prepare for that eventuality.
 On the Zionist side, there is evidence of a widening schism between moderates and
 extremists.  The former, who now control the Jewish Agency and the Hagana, feel that
 their ultimate salvation depends on British, U.S., and U.N. support and protection.

 The extremists, an anomalous miscellany of radical and reactionary elements, look to
 the U.S.S.R. for support and are disposed to fight not only the Arabs, but also British
 and U.S. "imperialism."  They demand unlimited immigration of European Jews and
 apparently welcome the Communist agents among them.
 The U.N. Commission will find a chaotic situation in Palestine, with the great
 majority of the population violently opposed to any action it might take.  The Com-
 mission must consequently call on the Security Council for aid, raising all the problems
 implicit in the dispatch of U.S., Soviet, or other troops to Palestine to impose partition
 by force of arms.
 15. Iran.  The weak (and probably short-lived) Hakimi Government cannot be
 as effective as was Qavam in dealing with either the U.S.S.R. or the domestic situation.
 Regarded as anti-Soviet, it will undoubtedly be subjected to strong pressure by both
 the U.S.S.R. and resurgent Iranian leftists.  Although Soviet forces are unlikely to
 re-enter Iran for the present, it is possible that Soviet-supported elements will attempt
 to penetrate Azerbaijan and other northern provinces.
 On the other hand, the political ascendancy of the Shah and the Army and the
 Shah's recent understandings with some of the more powerful tribes should facilitate
 Army action against Soviet infiltration and subversion.
 16. India-Pakistan.  Although the Kashmir dispute is now before the Security
 Council, continuing hostilities between Moslem tribesmen and Indian troops in that
 area may lead to open warfare between India and Pakistan before a solution can be
 devised.  Such a conflict, in which Afghanistan also might become involved, would
 be disastrous for both Dominions and would afford opportunities for eventual Soviet
 exploitation.
 THE FAR EAST
 17. General.  The Chinese Communist leader, Mao Tse-tung, has called for united
 and vigorous revolutionary action and resistance to U.S. "imperialism" on the part of
 all "democratic" elements in East Asia.  Moreover, Soviet publications have directed
 increased attention to developments in China and in southeast Asia.  Nevertheless, no
 radical change in Soviet policy or activity in the Far East is anticipated in the near
 future.  In particular the U.S.S.R. is expected to maintain its hitherto "correct"
 diplomatic relations with the Nanking Government.
 18. China.  Although the Communists have won no spectacular victories, the
 military position of the Nationalist Government continues to deteriorate.  In Man-
 churia, the Nationalists have had to expose Changchun and Kirin in order to reinforce
 Mukden.  In Central China, the Communists are now able to intercept Yangtze ship-
 ping west of Hankow, thus separating the Nationalist armies from important Szechuan
 rice supplies.  Mao Tse-tung has now publicly declared that the Communists have over-
 come the initial disadvantages and that the turning point in the civil war has been
 reached.
 Despite its urgent need for U.S. aid, the Chinese Government will be reluctant, in
 forthcoming negotiations, to accept any close degree of U.S. supervision.  This attitude
 is attributable to normally acute Chinese sensitivity with regard to national sover-

 eignty and to the ascendancy of the reactionary CC Clique, which now permeates most
 of the Government's economic and financial agencies.
 19. Korea.  The U.S.S.R. is rapidly preparing to establish the North Korean Peo-
 ple's Committee as the government of a "People's Republic."  At the same time, in
 South Korea, the Communists are dissuading moderates from cooperation with the
 U.N. Commission by offering them participation in a "coalition government" for all
 Korea.  The South Korean Right, however, perceiving in this situation assurance of
 an overwhelming victory in a U.N.-observed election, has welcomed the Commission
 and will support it as long as that prospect continues.
 It has long been evident that the Commission will be unable to establish a provi-
 sional government for all Korea in consequence of Soviet and North Korean intransi-
 gence.                   If it should also prove incapable of providing a representative and generally
 accepted regime for South Korea, the U.S. position in that area would be greatly
 jeopardized.  In such circumstances the United States must quickly establish such a
 government by its own action, or its position will become politically untenable.  The
 Korean passion for unity and independence is strong enough to blind South Koreans
 to the fact that a coalition government, including the North Korean People's Committee
 and the South Korean Left, would be but the first step toward Soviet domination of
 the entire country.
 20. Japan.  Despite Chinese attempts to effect a compromise between the U.S.
 and Soviet positions regarding a Japanese peace conference, the U.S.S.R. consistently
 refuses to participate without veto power.  The Kremlin is evidently content to con-
 tinue the development of its own position in northern Asia as a counter to the U.S.
 position in Japan, apparently trusting that prospective Communist successes in China
 and Korea will so undermine U.S. prestige in Japan and throughout the Far East that
 a more favorable peace settlement can be obtained at a later date.
 21. Indonesia.  The Dutch, by forming separatist states in territories taken from
 the Republic and still in dispute, and by presenting as an ultimatum truce terms which
 would hardly permit the continued existence of the Republic, have gravely jeopardized
 the mission of the U.N. Good Offices Committee, in which the United States occupies
 the key position.  The collapse of the Republic, from internal causes if the Dutch
 terms were accepted, or from Dutch military action if the terms were rejected, would
 seriously affect the prestige of the United Nations and the United States.  Soviet and
 Communist propaganda and Asiatic opinion would attribute that development to
 "imperialistic" U.S. intervention.
 LATIN AMERICA
 22. Panama.  Panamanian rejection of the defense-sites agreement was primarily
 the result of domestic political considerations in an election year and not of Communist
 influence, although Communists exploited the opportunity to assume the appearance
 of popular leadership in inciting demonstrations.  Basically, the Panamanians re-
 mained unconvinced that the United States really needed the base sites to defend the
 Canal from attack in the existing state of world-power relations and dispositions.
 23. General.  Communist capabilities for sabotage and espionage in Latin America
 remain considerable, although the anti-Communist trend referred to in CIA 3 continues.

 However, developing differences between the United States and some Latin American
 countries on economic matters (such as the opposing positions taken at the I.T.O.
 Havana Conference) and on political matters (such as base-sites negotiations with
 Panama) tend to strengthen the position of the Communists by associating non-Com-
 munists with them in opposition to the United States.

 SUMMARY, CIA 1, 26 September 1947
 1. Among foreign powers, only the U.S.S.R, is capable of threatening the security
 of the United States.
 2. The U.S.S.R. is presently incapable of military aggression outside of Europe and
 Asia, but is capable of overrunning most of continental Europe, the Near East, northern
 China, and Korea.
 3. The U.S.S.R. is unlikely to resort to open military aggression in present circum-
 stances.  Its policy is to avoid war, to build up its war potential, and to extend its
 influence and control by political, economic, and psychological methods.  In this it is
 deliberately conducting political, economic, and psychological warfare against the
 United States.
 4. The greatest danger to the security of the United States is the possibility of
 economic collapse in Western Europe and the consequent accession to power of Com-
 munist elements.
 5. Stabilization and recovery in Europe and Asia would tend to redress the balance
 of power and thereby to restrain the U.S.S.R.
 6. From the point of view of containing the U.S.S.R. and eventually redressing the
 balance of power the order of priority among the major regions of Europe and Asia is:
 a. Western Europe.
 b. The Near and Middle East (but within the region the situation in Greece
 is of great importance and the utmost urgency, while the situation with respect to
 Palestine is extremely dangerous).
 c. The Far East (but within the region Japan is important as the only area
 capable of relatively early development as a power center counterbalancing the Soviet
 Far East).
