 Information available

 in Chinese Politics
 The Military Factor
 The People's Liberation Army (PLA), as represented in politics by a
 handful of powerful soldier-politicians, has frequently been a locus of
 opposition to the reform policies associated with Deng Xiaoping. In our
 analysis, however, during the period of Deng's ascendancy beginning in
 1978, what the civilians have asked of the PLA they have generally
 received. If the army and its leaders at times have gone along reluctantly,
 they nevertheless have gone along.
 We believe the following statements characterize army-party relations and
 the military factor in Chinese politics today:
 ? The PLA does not present a solid institutional front in the face of civilian
 domestic and foreign policy initiatives.
 ? It is not an aggressively interventionist political actor but is frequently a
 reluctant partner.
 ? Civilian party leaders have fashioned policies that are not to the PLA's
 advantage but have suffered none of the fatal consequences anticipated in
 some conventional assessments of army-party politics.
 ? Although the PLA is an important political player, it by itself does not
 have veto power over Chinese policies or in the political succession to
 Deng. Senior military figures seem content to influence the political
 process rather than seek to dominate it.
 China's senior soldier-politicians provide the military with an important
 political voice, however. The military has a long tradition of partnership
 with the civilian party. It is amply represented on the party Politburo and
 Central Committee, and all available evidence indicates that the party does
 take into account the full range of military interests. Although civilians
 clearly set the political agenda, they do so in consultation with their
 military colleagues.
 There are pronounced differences on some policy questions between party
 and army leaders but none that the military regards as a matter of life and
 death and beyond compromise. We believe that many of the recent strains
 in the army-party relationship have in fact had their roots, in the PLA's
 General Political Department, which last September was placed under new

 leadership. Generally speaking, a pattern of give and take, in which the
 party has made modest concessions in return for support on larger issues,
 has been characteristic of contemporary army-party politics:
 ? China's senior soldiers and the civilian leadership are generally in
 agreement on the priority of military professionalization but differ over
 the army's relative priority in the overall modernization plans.
 ? The senior soldier-politicians have generally cooperated in efforts to
 revise recruitment criteria, retire aged or incompetent personnel, consoli-
 date commands, demobilize excessive ground forces and support person-
 nel, and purge the politically unreliable despite some reservations voiced
 within the PLA.
 ? The problem of Mao's legacy has not completely been laid to rest, and
 the army still seeks to salvage whatever elements of Mao's doctrine that
 appear relevant to current conditions.
 ? The conservative disposition of some PLA leaders has led them and like-
 minded civilians to voice reservations about some of Deng's economic
 reforms and undesirable side effects generated by the policies, but
 Beijing's senior civilians have generally sought to revise policies to meet
 these objections.
 Data on military opinions concerning foreign policy is particularly thin; we
 believe foreign policy is essentially a civilian preserve.
 We believe that for the duration of Deng's active political life, the party
 will generally have the cooperation of the military. The prospects for Hu
 Yaobang, Deng's political heir, to succeed Deng and to preserve army-
 party harmony are enhanced by the continuing personnel turnover in the
 PLA. Hu will be able to count on the support of senior military men who
 have a vested interest in the policies initiated by Deng and who would
 probably take their lead from civilian leaders with whom they are allied.
 We believe that the influence of the senior officers may increase during the
 succession period but not to the point where they exercise a veto over Hu's
 continuation as general secretary.

 The Military Factor
 in Chinese Politics
 The Cultural Revolution era (1966-76) saw an unprec-
 edented politicization of China's military establish-
 ment and the expansion of the military's influence in
 all aspects of Chinese life. Indeed, by the Ninth Party
 Congress in 1969, the forces of the People's Libera-
 tion Army (PLA) were administering the entire coun-
 try and were widely perceived by Chinese and foreign-
 ers alike as the only force capable of preventing chaos
 following the destruction of the party and state bu-
 reaucracies by Mao Zedong
 The PLA's action in this period gave rise to an
 interpretation of the army's role in politics that has
 varied little to this day. At its most extreme, the
 conventional wisdom posits that the army aggressively
 asserts its institutional interests at every opportunity;
 that it has across-the-board differences with China's
 civilian leadership; that civilian failure to propitiate
 this purported military opposition runs the risk of
 some unspecified-but presumably violent-retalia-
 tion; and that, as a consequence, the military in effect
 remains the arbiter of Chinese politics
 In our analysis, army-party relations are not nearly so
 strained; although there are significant differences on
 a number of issues, we judge army-party relations to
 be on an even keel. Moreover, in evaluating the PLA's
 political role, we believe a good case, can be made
 that:
 ? The PLA does not present a solid institutional front
 in the face of civilian political initiatives.
 ? It is not an aggressively interventionist political
 actor-its forceful intervention during the Cultural
 Revolution in fact was at the behest of the civilian
 leadership.
 ? The civilian party leaders have fashioned policies
 that are not to the army's advantage but have
 suffered none of the fatal consequences anticipated
 in conventional assessments of army-party politics.
 ? Although the PLA is an important political player,
 it is in no way the overriding factor in Chinese
 politics or in the political succession to Deng.
 There is little information that directly illuminates
 the questions involved in assessing the political role of
 the army. The Chinese maintain an obsessive secrecy
 about anything that concerns the military. In prepar-
 ing this paper, we have drawn on the full range of
 intelligence information and diplomatic and press
 reporting. The bulk of our assessment, however, is
 derived from analysis of Chinese propaganda. Al-
 though we are confident we understand the issues in
 army-party relations, our knowledge of the decision-    25X1
 making process relating to those issues is less com-       0
 plete.
 The Political Context of
 Army-Party Relations'
 At the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
 Committee in 1978, Deng Xiaoping and his political
 allies won endorsement of a program that effectively
 sought to reverse the radical political, economic, and
 social orientation that had been set by Mao. Plans
 initially drawn up by Deng in 1974 and 1975 to
 reform the large Chinese military establishment were
 also revived. The new economic priorities, then desig-
 nated the "Four Modernizations," included the mod-
 ernization of China's military but gave it the lowest
 position on the grounds that the national economy
 must improve before substantial material benefits
 would accrue to the PLA
 'A note on terminology: Throughout this assessment, the term
 "party" will generally be used to mean the civilian party, and the
 terms "army" or "military" will generally be used to designate the
 PLA. In adopting this usage, we do not overlook the fact that in
 many cases leaders who are customarily regarded as civilians-
 Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun, for example-have significant
 military responsibilities or that senior military leaders of the
 founding generations-Nie Rongzhen or Xu Xiangqian, for exam-
 ple-may effectively transcend differences between the party and

 The purely military component of China's reform
 program called for:
 ? Sharp reduction in troop stength to create a "leaner,
 meaner" military.
 ? New recruitment criteria to improve the average
 education level of young enlistees and thereby pre-
 pare the PLA for the advent of modern weaponry.
 ? Changes in training that played down traditional
 Maoist people's war precepts and placed more em-
 phasis on joint-service operations and warfare under
 modern military conditions.
 ? Retirement of superannuated, incompetent, or polit-
 ically unreliable officers to create headroom for a
 new generation of commanders.
 ? A consolidation of commands, stressing the simplifi-
 cation of organization and the elimination of
 redundancy.
 Although these changes tended to reduce the influ-
 ence of the military conservatives and were unpopular
 in some quarters, senior commanders endorsed them,
 indicating a basic sympathy with the program's broad
 goals. Indeed, since the Third Plenum, the PLA's
 budget has been cut, demobilizations have reduced
 the ranks by approximately 1 million, some elderly
 officers are beginning to retire, the simplification of
 command has begun, and the army is preparing-
 along with the civilian party-for a large-scale purge
 later this year.'
 Deng has moved cautiously in implementing his re-
 form policies, wherever possible attempting to con-
 vince skeptics of the wisdom of his program rather
 than ordering compliance. In making sensitive person-
 nel appointments, he has taken into account the
 opinions of the senior soldier-politicians. He has also
 made concessions on such issues as ideology and
 culture to the more conservative sensibilities of the
 PLA. In instances where new economic programs
 have discriminated against rural dependents of serv-
 ing soldiers, adjustments have been made to benefit
 military families.
 ' See appendix B for a summary of recent military personnel
 changes. The 12th Party Congress and its creation of a party
 advisory commission for senior officials has stimualted a large
 turnover of high-ranking officers, especially in the regional military
 Most of the issues in army-party relations today
 appear to us to fall into the realm of routine politics,
 which require no extraordinary measures to resolve.
 In our judgment, senior military officers do not feel
 alienated or powerless, nor do they seem out of
 sympathy with the central goal of Deng's program:
 the creation of a stable, less ideological regime gov-
 erned by a collective leadership that has as its para-
 mount goal the raising of living standards. Senior
 military figures seem content to influence the political
 process rather than seek to dominate it~
 The Mechanics of Military Influence
 Sources of Political Power
 In no other Communist state has the military persist-
 ently wielded as much influence or been consistently
 so well represented in the leading party organiza-
 tions-the Central Committee and its Political Bu-
 reau (or their equivalent bodies). When we speak
 about the "army's role" or the "military's influence,"
 we are actually talking about the power and authority
 of senior soldiers, essentially the military members of
 the Politburo and the Secretariat, and the PLA's high
 command-all probable members of the party's Mili-
 tary Commission,' which sets military policy and is
 China's most powerful military organization. In Chi-
 nese politics influence tends to be linked to personal-
 ities rather than to institutions; a person is powerful
 because of who he is and the loyalties he commands,
 not by virtue of the office he holds. In effect, then, the
 influence of the military is essentially the sum of the
 personal power of a handful of soldier-politicians
 ' We presume that membership on the party's Military Commission
 includes not only the publicly identified members (chairman, vice
 chairman, secretary general, deputies secretary general) but also:
 military region commanders, directors and political commissars of
 the PLA's three general departments, the Minister of National
 Defense, the commanders and political commissars of the service
 arms (Air Force, Navy, and so forth), and eminent senior officers
 who no longer have specific job responsibilities. The membership
 probably includes civilians whose work brings them into close
 contact with military matters, such as heads of the armaments
 ministries and public security officials. Thus, we estimate that the
 Commission probably has in excess of 50 members.

 The political prominence of China's ranking soldiers
 is partly a legacy of' the Chinese revolution and the
 wartime partnership between army and party. Since
 the founding of the People's Republic, virtually all of
 its national leaders have been forn)er soldiers whose
 service in the Communist army dates from the years
 when party and army were virtually indistinguish-
 able.' Only in the early 1950s did career patterns
 differentiate and "civilian" and "military" become
 relatively unambiguous categories of leadership in

 The consistently martial cast of Communist China's

 the army's influence in policymaking. These early
 years were marked by suppression of remnant Nation-

 vention in Korea, an initial five-year plan that empha-

 other measures that required substantial military
 contributions both in planning and execution.

 The early importance of the military was also reflect-

 Military representation on the Central Committee has
 ranged from a high of about 45 percent in 1969 to a
 low of about 20 percent in 1956 and at present.
 Although the amount of influence members of the
 Committee exert as members is open to question,
 membership nevertheless confers prominence within
 the 39-million-member party, elite status throughout
 China, and, presumably, access to the upper reaches
 of the party bureaucracy.
 Military representation on the Politburo is even more
 pronounced. Of its 28 current members, seven are
 career soldiers. Three others, including Deng Xiao-
 ping, have mainly worked as civilians but now assume

 of the personal influence of soldier-politicians-gains
 influence from its role as a national model for civilian
 emulation. This reached its heyday in the years
 'On the inner sanctum of the Politburo, its Standing Committee,
 two men may be said to represent military "constituencies"-Deng

 the same views on military affairs but have differed over broader
 questions of national policy. Both, however, are probably perceived

 immediately preceding the Cultural Revolution, when
 everyone was admonished "to learn from the PLA."
 This type of exhortation has declined, and, because of
 the reform program, a PLA career is not as attractive
 to young Chinese as it once was. On some matters,
 however-especially the recent drive to revive tradi-
 tional moral precepts under the guise of "socialist
 spiritual civilization"-the PLA is still held up as a
 national exemplar.
 The military as an institution undoubtedly draws
 influence from its heavy involvement in key economic
 and S&T projects. Much of the most sensitive re-
 search work is carried out under military auspices or
 at military facilities. Until recently, the PLA had
 primary responsibility for much state construction,
 and retired or demobilized officers routinely received
 management positions in civilian enterprises.
 Impact of Crosscutting Loyalties
 As far as we can determine-and our evidence is
 subjective and thin-the Chinese officer corps has not
 developed a strong corporate sense-that is, they do
 not as yet perceive their profession to be one that
 separates them from the rest of society or imposes a
 commonality of interests. We can cite no instance of
 the Chinese officer corps closing ranks to defend what
 might be defined as purely military interest, although
 the possibility is high that if such an event occurred
 we might not know about it.6
 Lacking a strong corporate sense, the potential politi-
 cal pressure that the Chinese officer corps can bring
 to bear is diminished. Indeed, the military does not
 have a uniform point of view. All the shades of
 opinion in China are also reflected in the PLA,
 although not necessarily with the same emphases.' We
 can identify no single, unified "military opinion" or
 political interest, no homogeneous PLA opposition to
 " Ironically, perhaps, to the extent the military reform program
 increases professionalism, the Chinese officer corps will presumably
 begin to think and act more in corporate terms. At the same time,
 professionalism also implies a diminished political presence, which
 interests on traditionally military concerns.
 general, the PLA tends to view events in Maoist terms, which are
 out of step with Deng's reform program. Nonetheless, many senior
 officers, such as Chief of State Yang Dezhi and Defense Minister
 Zhang Aiping, support Deng's efforts to professionalize and mod-
 Deng's reformist proclivities, and no one officer who
 personifies the army's views with the authority en-
 joyed by Peng Dehuai or Lin Biao during the Mao
 era. In China's current political context, the phrase
 "military opposition" can make sense only if under-
 stood as the disagreement of one or more senior
 officers with a specific policy, and not, as frequently
 understood, as wholesale rejection by "the military"
 of Deng's entire reform package. The net effect, we
 believe, is that it is impossible for any one man to
 deliver the military on any question.
 Crosscutting loyalties reinforce differences of military
 opinion that tend to dilute corporatism in the officer
 corps. Each officer has at least one primary institu-
 tional affiliation but has other allegiances as well. For
 instance, every officer in the Chinese high command
 is a party member of long standing, and, having risen
 through a military culture that emphasizes discipline
 and unity, we believe there is a strong impulse among
 officers to close ranks behind the party's line. An
 officer may just as likely have primary loyalty to his
 service branch or administrative bureaucracy within
 the PLA. Purely nationalistic considerations motivate

 Playing the Game: The Exercise of Power 25X1
 We know relatively little about the modes of military
 involvement in Chinese political decisionmaking.
 Since the fall of the Gang of Four, however, we know
 of no instance in which an individual soldier-politician
 or any presumed group of soldier-politicians threat-
 ened to use armed force for personal or political ends.'
 We believe that military influence is exerted in three
 In the history of the regime, there have been two alleged attempts
 to use force in a political matter: the so-called coup attempt by Lin
 Biao and the paramilitary contingency plans of Jiang Qing and her
 three associates. The facts of these incidents have never been
 clarified, and there is some debate over what actually occurred, but
 perhaps the most relevant aspect of the two "conspiracies" is that
 while PLA loyalties to the political center may have wavered, they
 were never severed. Indeed, in both incidents the military stood by
 the civilian party authorities and on orders moved against the

 councils; through the media; and in policy implemen-
 tation.
 Party and Government Councils. In our analysis,
 political decisions within the decisive party arena are
 reached by consensus, which gives senior soldier-
 politicians ample opportunity to shape decisions. Even
 Deng, who is first among equals, cannot dictate policy
 to his peers. Each member of the leadership brings to
 policy deliberations his own ideological, political, and
 institutional baggage, and during these initial ex-
 changes-while the issue presumably remains wide
 open-individual influence is perhaps most pro-
 nounced. The soldier-politicians operate as do any
 other members of the political elite.'
 Military officers often are able to find allies among
 civilian leaders, who are equally affected by reform
 policies. Rather than clearly defined factions these are
 probably shifting coalitions based on specific issues.
 We believe that, on resource allocation questions,
 soldier-politicians are natural allies of economic plan-
 ners and administrators who favor greater emphasis
 on central planning and heavy industrial production.
 Soldiers who favor a more professional, less politically
 active army have allies among civilians who share that
 outlook and who stress professional competence rather
 than political reliability as criterion for all leadership.
 The generation of officers between ages.30 and 50,
 who will inherit the positions cleared through Deng's
 retirement policy, are probably the PLA's strongest
 supporters of reform.1?
 ' A crucial area of speculation concerns the personal staffs of the
 leadership and how they interact. Chinese leaders tend to have a
 rather small personal staff but can also task the much larger staffs
 that are attached to both policymaking and administrative organi-
 zations. The Secretariat, for example, has several subordinate
 research offices-for policy, agriculture, and so forth. We know
 nothing of how staffers are apportioned among the leadership or
 what relative advantages in the routine processes of consensus
 building are conferred by various staffing arrangements. The Chief
 of China's General Staff has three senior officers who have been
 identified as his assistants, and each assistant presumably directs a
 " We also believe such alliances occur at the local level. Civilian-
 military alliances at the provincial level and lower were also fairly
 common during and immediately after the Cultural Revolution.
 The central leadership, however, has attempted to reduce the
 probability of such alliances by periodically transferring regional
 military commanders. There have been three such rotations since
 The military, like other groups in China, increasingly
 is using the annual meeting of the National People's
 Congress, the nominal parliament, to express opinions
 on national issues. In recent sessions they have criti-
 cized cuts in the PLA budget, rural responsibility
 systems that make the army a less appealing alterna-
 tive to the farm than it once was, the scale of the shift
 of military industries into civilian production, and
 morale problems created by wide-scale demobiliza-
 tions without sufficient promise of adequate civilian
 employment
 Publication of these complaints in the party press-
 itself a daring departure from the past practice-has
 the effect of legitimizing the military's grievances as
 well as its right to criticize party policy. The party's
 apparent confidence, however, in allowing mildly het-
 erodox opinions to air suggests to us that it believes
 relations with the army are basically good
 The Role of the Media. An important arena in which
 both army-party and intraservice disputes are played
 out is in China's public media. The PLA has its own
 restricted distribution newspaper, the Liberation
 Army Daily (LAD), which is edited and published by
 the PLA's General Political Department. The over-
 whelming majority of LAD's content is uncontrover-
 sial. On occasion, however, the LAD publishes views
 that stray from the central line, usually as a signed
 article or a "contributing commentator" written by an
 author who is not on the regular staff of the paper.
 Such pieces cannot be regarded as the military posi-
 tion on an issue-only editorials have that status-but
 they often reflect the views of a sizable group within
 the PLA, which, through the media, seeks to influence
 opinion among a broader audience.
 The Bai Hua and Zhao Yiya incidents are examples
 of how the military media attempt to influence policy.
 In the spring of 1981, the LAD published an article
 by a contributing commentator that sharply de-
 nounced "Bitter Love," a screenplay written by an
 army writer named Bai Hua. The commentator sin-
 gled out Bai and his work as examples of the increas-
 ing tendency of China's literary and intellectual com-
 munity to question the party's legitimacy and to

 criticize the army's behavior during the Cultural
 Revolution. The civilian party media-most notably
 People's Daily-supported Bai Hua and increased
 artistic freedom. The debate was ultimately resolved
 in favor of the LAD position and new controls were
 imposed on China's artistic and literary community.
 On the eve of the 12th Party Congress in late August
 1982, the LAD ran a signed article by Zhao Yiya,
 another army writer, that implicitly criticized much
 of Deng's reform program. In this instance, the LAD
 lost and was forced to publish an open "self-criticism"
 that called the publication of Zhao's article a "grave
 political and organizational error." Whether as pre-
 cipitating cause or mere pretext, the August article
 also led to the dismissal of Politburo member Wei
 Guoqing as director of the General Political Depart-
 ment, the military organ responsible for the LAD, and
 a new round of media criticism of "leftism" with the
 PLA.
 Policy Implementation. Military influence over policy
 is not exerted solely by the most senior soldier-
 politicians. In contrast to their active advocacy at the
 political center is the passive resistance of lower level
 commanders and commissars, who like other Chinese
 officials, sometimes attempt to circumvent policy by
 not vigorously enforcing it." Officers are frequently
 given only general instructions and have the flexibility
 to tailor implementation to specific conditions within
 the command. Subsequent noncompliance at times is
 effective in pressuring the central leadership to modi-
 fy policy. Physical distance from the capital, powerful
 support at higher levels, a strong local position with
 civilian support, and mixed signals from the center all
 work to the advantage of regional military figures.
 During the past two years, however, it has become
 more and more difficult for local leaders to resist
 central policies as the Dengist leadership has consoli-
 dated its position.
 It Recent complaints in the open media, for example, indicate
 Beijing has had difficulty getting unspecified "comrades" to retire
 aged officers, to make adequate preparations for demobilization
 work, and to sufficiently conduct propaganda on the latest central
 Issues in Army-Party Relations
 China's obsessive secrecy in military affairs and the
 use of slogans make it difficult to understand at times
 exactly what is at issue and to distinguish between
 commitment and cant. At a minimum, we assume the
 majority of Chinese military professionals want for      25X1
 their armed forces what soldiers elsewhere character-
 istically seek:
 ? A measure of autonomy in military matters and
 sympathetic consideration by civilian politicians of
 their views and program to meet national security
 needs.
 ? Recognition of their importance and contribution to
 China.
 ? Modernization of military hardware over time.r__7
 25X1
 In our judgment, there are pronounced differences on
 some policy questions between party leaders and
 military officers but none that the military regards as
 a matter of life and death. The following review of      25X1
 issues in recent army-party relations suggests that a
 spirited and on occasion heated dialogue has taken
 place, but essentially over priority and pace, not goals.
 As a consequence, army-party differences have been
 amenable to compromise. Although, as far as we can
 determine, the political agenda is clearly dictated by
 the civilian leadership, the record shows that Deng
 and his allies generally take the views and interests of
 the senior soldier-politicians fully into account.
 Professionalism and Politics. In the PLA, which is
 and will remain a highly politicized army, profession-
 alism has had an uneven record. Officers have had to
 adapt not only to changing criteria of military exper-
 tise but also to repeatedly shifting political require-
 ments. In our view, there appears to be substantial
 consensus among civilian and military leaders on the     25X1
 need to create structures that circumscribe the mili-
 tary's political role and preclude the possible manipu-
 lation of the army to advance the political ends of one
 man or a small group                                     25X1

 I'hc relative weight to assign to the PLA's military
 and political activities, however, continues to be con-
 tent ions. Our reading of the civilian and military press
 as sv.ell as I S military attache reporting suggests that
 the majority of' China's senior soldier-politicians favor
 a sharper, more exclusively military role. They seek
 the attributes of increased professionalism: improved
 unit and individual training; regulations governing
 ranks, promotions, and career development; and insti-
 tutions that clearly establish responsibility at each
 level of command. They also seek to reduce the army's
 involvement in areas where the army and society in
 general have overlapped, such as public security,
 civilian construction, and, of course, political activism.

 We believe that if army professionalization is to
 proceed smoothly, the party must ensure the absolute
 reliability of the GPD to implement revised personnel
 policies. In September Wei was replaced by Yu Qiuli

 embarked upon renewed criticism of' leftism within
 the army. Yu almost certainly has the responsibility
 for bringing the GPD fully on board with the party
 line. Yu will be assisted in his efforts by the coming
 party rectification, which formally begins late this
 year. If he succeeds, we believe a major source of
 army-party conflict will have been defused.

 would still be effected in the CMC because its
 membership would be composed of essentially the
 same types of officials we believe are on the current
 party Military Commission  all having strong party
 credentials  but presumably without the ancient war-
 riors and with a greater percentage of civiliansF_
 Modernization Priorities. Although we believe that
 civilian and military leaders agree on the primacy of
 professionalization in the PLA, there are probably
 differences over the relative priority of military mod-
 China's national economy to be the first priority. The
 civilians argue that the army will eventually reap the
 benefits of China's economic growth once current
 policies come on track, and, hence, military modern-
 ization has the lowest priority among China's "Four
 Modernizations" (in industry, agriculture, science and
 technology, and national defense).

 l'he periodic appearance  such as during the 1980
 session of the National People's Congress  of views
 critical of the Pt A's low priority and recent attempts
 in the public media to rebut such opinions lead us to
 conclude that China's soldiers have only grudgingly
 accepted the situation. In our view, which is based on
 both public and private statements of military spokes-
 men, the PI.A's acceptance of the current priorities -
 including a cut in China's defense budget  turns on a
 civilian promise of' increased future outlays.
 It is unlikely, however, that this arrangement can last
 indefinitely. The statements of PEA spokesmen over
 the past two years indicate that, during the life of the
 current five year plan or early in the next around
 1986  the senior officers expect China's economic
 policies to generate the necessary resources for addi-
 tional military expenditures. Delay beyond that time
 will likely bring this simmering issue to a rolling boil.
 "Rice Bowl" Issues
 I fforts to modernize on the cheap by bureaucratic
 streamlining and personnel measures threaten the
 livelihood of many rank-and-file military men and
 thus are politically sensitive. The effects of crosscut-
 ting loyalties and interservice rivalry undermine the
 military's ability to resist these policies, however, and
 the demographics of the officer corps also works to
 attenuate such resistance as arises. Natural attrition
 is claiming many of the old soldiers at whom the most
 controversial measures are aimed:
 ? The reestablishment of ranks, which were abolished
 in 1905, is a sensitive matter because it would most
 likely be accompanied by regulations governing the
 service of officers, as was the case in 1955. These
 would impose strict "up or out" criteria on officers
 who also have in many cases been serving for 20
 years or more in essentially the same posts. The
 army high command would also have to determine
 at a single swoop who would be a general, who a
 colonel, and who mustered out. Plans to restore
 ranks have been delayed repeatedly. We believe the
 civilian and military reformers can afford to wait on
 this measure, as the longer implementation is de-
 layed, the smoother it will go. We expect any
 trouble that arises when the rank system is finally
 implemented to be brief and uneventful.
 ? Current Chinese recruitment policy favors high
 school graduates for the enlisted ranks and military
 academy graduates for the officer corps. Both are
 sharp departures from the earlier practice of exten-
 sive recruitment among the peasantry and promo-
 lion through the ranks. The official media admits
 the new criteria worries the currently serving, rela-
 tively unsophisticated officers who fear the in-
 creased competition. In our view, the reformers
 seem confident that the gradual personnel turnover
 during the next several years will eliminate the
 aggrieved and thus defuse the problem.
 ? The party has offered lucrative retirement benefits
 to encourage the PLA old guard to step down, but,
 they remain
 fearful that they will be left adrift. Despite consider-
 able effort, the party has met with only limited
 success in clearing headroom for a new generation
 of impatient young commanders. If the party can
 demonstrate satisfactory personal arrangements
 have been made, we expect it will get better cooper-
 ation from the army elders."
 ? The consolidation of commands, such as the Engi-
 neer Corps' absorption into the General Staff De-
 partment and the downgrading of both the armor
 and artillery as independent service arms, will elimi-
 nate hundreds of slots now filled by superannuated
 officers and political commissars. At the same time,
 the demobilization program, which we estimate has
 reduced the PLA by about I million men since late
 1980, is paring the entire force of its least promising
 members." The national emphasis on expertise
 leaves many demobilized personnel unqualified for
 " The central leadership here seeks to create the momentum
 necessary for a "demonstrator" effect. This effort was aided bv the
 12th Party Congress last September and the founding of the
 Central Advisory Commission for old cadre, where fully one-third
 of the scats will be occupied by former officers.
 " The published strength of the uniformed PLA was given as 4.213

 managerial and administrative positions once rou-
 tinely filled by former soldiers. On this issue as well,
 senior civilian and military leaders seem confident
 that the personnel problems can be handled at the
 local levels, and we see little probability of a
 dangerous strain in army-party relations.
 The Legacy of Mao Zedong
 Military and civilian leaders have significantly differ-
 ent views of Mao, which are rooted in different sets of
 needs. Civilian leaders basically want to rewrite
 Mao's ideological legacy so that it cannot be used to
 attack their program. The frequent attacks in the
 Chinese media on the continuing influence of leftism
 in the military indicate that the last great repository
 of diehard Maoism indeed lies within the PLAT
 Some PLA concerns on this score are personal. Con-
 servatives in the party and army fear the party's
 legitimacy as well as their own careers-which had
 been founded on adherence to Mao's thought-could
 be irreparably damaged if Mao's ideas and policies
 are formally rejected. Other concerns are less self-
 centered. Some PLA voices argue, for example, that
 for the current period of economic austerity, Mao's
 prescriptions for "people's war" and a politicized
 military remained the only sure cement for the PLA.
 We believe the army is caught in a difficult position;
 the rest of Chinese society is being encouraged to
 loosen ideological constraints on initiatives and pursue
 material rewards at a time when military expendi-
 tures are being held down and ideological incentives
 are the only ones the army can offer.
 The party's verdict on Mao's legacy, the Resolution
 on Historical Questions that was adopted at the Sixth
 Plenum in June 1981, was a compromise document. It
 toned down many of the harsh criticisms of Mao that
 appeared in earlier drafts and made concessions to
 military sentiments. Mao's mistakes were noted, but
 they were presented as the well intended if tragic
 misjudgments of a senile old man who, in the final
 assessment, was nevertheless "a great revolutionary."
 Mao's military writings were salvaged as acceptable
 and continue to be touted as indispensable "magic
 weapons" of the PLA. Moreover, the resolution
 placed the army's role in the Cultural Revolution in a
 generally favorable light, noting that it contributed to
 the restoration of order in a particularly difficult time.
 The extensive propaganda campaign within the army
 to study the resolution met with puzzlement and
 confusion. The study drive continued in the PLA
 longer than elsewhere, far into 1982. The ongoing
 turnover in military personnel through retirements,
 demobilization, and natural attrition presumably will
 assist the party and its military allies in weaning the
 PLA from its habitual Maoism.
 We suspect, however, that the issue will not go away.
 The resolution in our judgment did not mark an end
 to the controversy over Mao; it merely moved it to
 another stage. Articles in the Chinese press indicate
 military leaders are still attempting to thrash out
 what parts of Mao's military doctrine remain suitable
 for "people's war under modern conditions."
 PLA-whether out of sincere concern or political
 expedience-believe Deng's economic reforms have
 unacceptable social consequences. In particular, the
 military press has expressed concern over the influx of
 Western values and their impact on Chinese youth. It
 has also tied the policies to the rising incidence of
 official corruption and the tendency of writers and
 artists to produce works that openly or indirectly
 question the legitimacy of the party's rule.
 The party has to some extent conceded that its critics
 are correct by clamping down on corruption and
 taking steps to contain foreign influences. At the same
 time, military and civilian reformers assert that China
 "cannot stop eating for fear of choking." They have
 consistently denied that the policies themselves are
 flawed and have sought to place the blame on "weak
 individuals" who are susceptible to the blandishments
 of foreign crooks and the conscious subterfuge of
 provocateurs.

 I lu's intemperate

 interests. Above all the PEA wants a civilian party
 leadership that is responsive to the army's concerns,

 military reform, Deng in our view is regarded as a fair
 broker who is able to protect the military from its
 more determined critics.

 Despite all the pulling and prodding as the party has

 the arms and its leaders at times have gone along
 reluctantly, they nevertheless have gone along=

 Based on the record of the past decade, our most
 fundamental judgment is a commonplace one that
 needs to be repeated in the Chinese context: in times
 of pronounced domestic disorder and disunity in the
 political center, the military assumes heightened polit-
 ical prominence and influence. When the civilian
 center is strong and relatively unified, the military
 generally seeks to disengage from high politics and
 returns to its normal defense and internal security
 roles.

 The reorganization last ycar of the central party and

 We expect the pattern of trade-offs we have seen
 before each of the recent major party convocations
 the Sixth and Seventh Plenums of the 1 1 th Central
 Committee and the 12th Party Congress  to continue
 through the Deng period. For example, the soldier-
 politicians retained an unchanged number of repre-
 sentatives on the Politburo and continue to have a
 sizable  albeit reduced  contingent on the Central
 Committee. Moreover, none of the aged "old mar-

 Rongzhen  were relegated to the Central Advisor
 Commission, and the party generally continues to go
 slow on forcing the retirement of army elders from the
 active ranks. Partly in return for these modest meas-
 ures, Deng and his allies won substantial gains in
 personnel appointments to the Politburo and Secretar-
