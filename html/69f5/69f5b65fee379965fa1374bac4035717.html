 This, I need remind no one, is an election year.   A
 good section of the American public not just the cynics,
 has always thought of this as a season which is best
 gotten through with the help of a good dose of healthy
 skepticism.   With some justice the office seeker is
 supposed to have a bent for making a crisis out of the
 commonplace, for inflating or deflating the significance of
 this or that development depending on whether he represented
 the in or out party.   Words and phrases like "test",
 "challenge",  "moral fiber" and "will to persevere" have
 been so much used that many people regard them as
 oratorical flourishes and react to them as they do to
 background music and wallpaper..
 It has been a long time since the U.S. role in the
 world has been under such troubled scrutiny as it is now.

 raises are real not rhetorical.
 But as we ponder our own problems, domestic and foreign,
 we can take some comfort from the knowledge that our chief
 adversaries, the Soviet and Chinese Communists, are them-
 selves beset by considerable difficulties.
 Even the pundits,  I understand, despair of being able
 to make any sense out of the curious and complex convulsion
 taking place inside China under the name of the Cultural
 Revolution.   I do not want to offer any new theories.  There
 is no doubt, however, that this internal turmoil and the
 seriocomic zeal which is such a big part of it has badly
 damaged China's international position.  The challenge from
 Peking has all along rested not on military or economic
 power but, in Asia, on a looming presence amidst a number
 of much smaller states of uncertain stability, and, in the
 so-called Third World in general on its claim to have a
 unique answer to the problems of economic backwardness.

 political and propaganda arsenal has, at least for the time
 being, been greatly diminished.   No one can foretell how
 long it will take the Chinese to get a grip on their
 domestic problems.   Yet, I am convinced that China's most
 compelling motive is to establish itself as a great power
 and I expect that the first order of business with the
 successors to Mao Tse-tung will be to find ways to
 resume that quest.
 The Soviets, too, have lately been devoting most of
 their energies to problems which have arisen close to
 home, within the USSR and in Eastern Europe.  From the US
 point of view there are both good and bad features in this
 development.   It has meant that the Soviets have had less
 time to give to other areas of interest, such as Western
 Europe and the Middle East, where they had been particularly
 active during the last year.   Then, too, the US is bound to
 welcome what has been happening in Czechoslovakia--long one

 where a new leadership is trying, within a Communist frame-
 work, to acquire the attributes of national sovereignty and
 dignity.  We would be doing no service to ourselves or to
 the Czechoslovak people if we exaggerated the extent to
 which the Czechoslovak regime has gone or wants to go in its
 program of "democratization.'  This is Czechoslovakia's
 affair and-we should not act as though  we thought otherwise.
 There is no question but what the US position in Europe
 during the last two decades has provided the basis for
 this development and we ought to have this in mind when we
 are contemplating our future role both in Europe and in
 the rest of the world.   But, at the same time, we should
 continue--as we have been doing--to avoid the appearance
 of meddling.  There is no reason to hide our sympathies
 and we should be receptive if the Czechoslovaks indicate
 they are ready to be holpod.  To go beyond this, however,
 would be to risk giving offense to the native reforming

 It is clear that the Soviets are already very nervous,
 if not anxious, about the trends in Eastern Europe.   Even
 though they are much closer to the scene than we are and
 should by now have learned how to gauge and to guide the
 currents of change in the Communist bloc, they seem again,
 as in the cases of the Yugoslavs and the Chinese earlier,
 to have been late in recognizing the symptoms of dissatisfaction
 in a closely allied state and to have behaved clumsily
 when these signs could no longer be overlooked.
 The Russians' behavior in the face of these developments
 is one of the negative features I referred to.   Even thoLg h
 they may be obliged to accommodate to these changes--
 which, though they will cost Moscow something in terms of
 authority, do not really threaten the Soviets' still over-
 whelming dominance in the area--they obviously are reluctant
 to do so, and are continuing to throw their weight around
 in a way which seems to be causing mounting exasperation in

 the Cold War in some of the exhortations issuing from Moscow
 with their summons to ideological warfare, their charges
 that the "imperialists" are seeking to undermine the
 whole socialist order, and their denunciations of "nationalism
 and revisionism."  The Soviet public is feeling the backlash
 as the regime has moved to quash the movement for wider
 freedom of expression which had begun to attract a substantial
 part of the Soviet intellectual and literary community.
 The regime's harsh response has sent a shiver through this
 community and one or two brave souls have even dared to ask
 the regime to recall that it has itself condemned Stalinism.
 All in all, some very cold winds are blowing out of Moscow
 these days, across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and
 possibly toward the West as well.  At any rate, the prospects
 for a meaningful improvement in US-Soviet relations, for a
 widening of the area of constructive and responsible
 collaboration between the super powers seem to me to have
 been damaged, and not aloii  for the reason the Russians

 give--Vietnam.   I might add in this connection that it is
 my own feeling that we are misleading ourselves if we look
 for the Russians to do anything to help arrange a negotiated
 settlement in Vietnam acceptable to the US.
 The turn of events in Eastern Europe, though having
 both pluses and minuses for us, came at a bad moment for
 the Russians.  The signs, as I read them, were that Moscow
 was more confident than had been in some years--since it
 took cover after the Cuban misadventure in.1962--about the
 possibilities of strengthening its position on a number of
 international fronts.  During the three years between Khrushchev's
 overthrow in October 1964 and the 50th anniversary celebrations
 last fall, the collective leadership had not only stayed
 pretty much intact, it had plugged some of the holes that
 were showing when Khrushchev left.  The party apparatus,
 which had been unsettled by Khrushchev's badly conceived
 administrative experiments, felt much more comfortable
 with Brezhnev and Kosygin and the others,  The Soviet

 military were made to think, and rightly so, that their interests
 were being better looked after.  The Soviets had come out
 well ahead in their war of words with the Chinese, to the
 point where they were ready once again to try to organize
 an. international conference of Communist parties to establish
 once and for all that Maoism is heresy.  What with the feeling
 that the US was losing interest in Europe, lack of sympathy
 with the war in Vietnam, Cold ;,.war weariness, and  their own
 generally good behavior, the Russians had never been in
 better aroma in Western Europe and they rated as good the
 chances of their being able to hasten the decline of NATO
 and the reduction of the US role in Europe.  After a near
 debacle in the Middle East, the Soviets emerged in a
 position of greater political and military influence there.
 Some of the Soviet political effort may now, it seems,
 be turned more or less inward.   It may seem more important
 to Moscow to shore up the Warsaw Pact than to tear down

 simultaneously, but only to suggest where the major effort
 might be put.       But if this-should happen I would expect  -
 it to represent only a momentary pause.  The fundamental
 impulse of Soviet foreign policy is likely to prevail.
 This, as I see it. is to close the gap, between the USSR and
 the US in those elements of national power which contribute
 to international authority:   political influence, military
 power, and economic strength.   If revolutionary change
 assists this process, well and good, but the USSR has long
 since ceased to count on this as the main instrument of
 aggrandizement.   I am not trying to evoke the idea of a
 grand Soviet design.  The Russians, too, must operate in
 a world in which the unexpected, the imponderable, the
 uncontrollable play no small part.  They must back and
 fill, look for opportunities, encounter disappointment and
 results, with them as with us, are often as dependent on
 method as on objective.   Yet if one looks at the way Soviet

 across its own borders into Eastern and Central Europe
 only to be checked by superior power as it pressed in
 Western Europe.   It was stopped also in Iran, Turkey
 and Greece, but we again see the Russians, now relying
 on conventional diplomacy and economic aid, working to
 reopen the doors wh-ich were slammed on them twenty years
 ago.   Further East along the USSR's southern periphery,
 Moscow has managed in India to put itself on at least
 a par in influence with the West, thanks in no small part
 to sizable economic and military aid programs.  And, as
 is now well understood, the USSR has established itself in
 the Mediterranean, where it was hardly visible five years
 ago and not at all only thirteen years ago, as a military
 power second only to the US.

 Soviets would like to accomplish in the years ahead than
 the present trend in their military investment.   I have
 in mind not only the steady rise in the military budget--
 which Moscow has declared to be up by 15% this year--
 but also the uses to which these increased funds are
 being put.

 programs, which appear on p. 5 of address at
 Stanford, could be reused in this context?
 We can, therefore, it seems to me look for the area
 of conflict and competition between the US and the USSR
 to widen, not shrink, in the years ahead, unless, of
 course, the US chooses not to accept the challenge.   I do
 not expect this to happen because I believe that the US,
 as indeed the USSR, will continue to recognize that, like
 it or not, it cannot, given its power and influence and
 its need to preserve them, stand on the sidelines.  i am

 and Moscow nor do I think we should think we have to go
 the Russians one better in every department.   One of the
 main tasks of our policy-making machinery will be to keep
 the rivalry between us and the Russians at a safe level
 and to pick and choose the points of engagement with care.
 in formulating national policy we must, however, start from
 the prudent assumption that the Soviets are not interested
 in reducing the area of engagement nor in pursuing a
 long-term detente with the US.
 There are, of course, many ingredients in the
 strategic equation other than the relative strengths of
 the US and, the USSR and the state of their relations,
 important as those are.   Some of these ingredients, such
 as the condition of the NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances,
 are pretty much known quantities.  The possibilities for
 conflict within and among the nations of the Third World

 is an important unknown.   But to my mind, the greatest
 question mark, as I suggested earlier in my remarks,
 hangs over the future course of mainland China.   I am
 thinking not so much about China's economic and military
 potential,  for these too can be plotted into the future
 with a fair degree of assurance.  What we cannot be sure
 of--no matter how many questions we might feed into
 computers--is how the Chinese, with Mao gone (as I
 presume he will be within a few years at most) will make
 themselves felt politically on the world stage and in
 Asia in particular.  Consider, for instance, how different
 the balance of forces in Asia would be if China and the
 USSR were once again collaborators rather than competitors.
 Consider the impact on the orientation, not only of the
 smaller states of the area, but of keystone nations like
 Japan, India, whose security has owed much to the inability
 of the two great Communist states to act together.

 How much likelihood is there that Moscow and
 Peking will be able to achieve some kind of reconciliation?
 As matters now stand, antagonism between them could hardly
 be greatex.   Each does its best to frustrate the
 objectives of the other wherever and whenever the opportunity
 arises.  Though neither has renounced the 1950 Mutual
 Assistance pact, they have acted in recent years on the
 assumption that in the military sphere they are more
 likely to encounter one another in the role of enemies
 than of allies.   For example, the Russians, have been
 steadily but without let-up, during the last three years
 in particular, adding to their strength in troops and
 weapons all along the Sino-Soviet frontier from Central
 Asia to the Far East.  There is, in addition, every reason
 to suppose that in constructing their strategic defenses,
 such as the ABM, the Soviets are mindful of a potential
 future missile threat from China.  Soviet decisions are

 bound to be influenced in other ways by the Chinese
 factor:   the rate and scope of development of Siberia,
 which has considerable import for Soviet economic
 planning and investment, is a case in point.   China,
 then, unquestionably weighs heavily on Soviet decision-
 making..                                  Imagine, as a rough comparison, how our own
 planning would have to be altered if Canada and Mexico
 were potentially hostile states.
 Now the question I raised was whether in the
 foreseeable future there is any possibility that these
 conditions will change.   I think we must assume that there
 is such a:-possibility.
 /The case for this proposition was stated very
 well by Philip Mosely in 6-7 Nov. 1967  Hearings
 before Atomic Energy Committee?

 and it points to a continuing, long-term reinforcement of
 the Soviet-Chinese border.  Also apparent is the fact that
 the Soviets think there are better days ahead for them in
 Peking after Mao is gone.   Nevertheless, there are very
 strong, underlying sources of friction and rivalry in
 the Sino-Soviet relationship which will work against
 anything more than a temporary and superficial reconciliation.
 There are built-in strains in dealings between countries
 which, though living side by side for centuries, have
 never established rapport with one another and whose
 cultural traditions are radically dissimilar.   Racial
 antagonism, though of course never admitted, is I am sure
 very real on both sides.   I understand that in private
 conversations in the USSR and Eastern Europe the term
 Yellow Peril crops up often.  Add to these barriers the

 but instead amplifies their mutual suspicions and
 accentuates their natural differences.
