HIGHLIGHTS 
The USSR continued during the past week to react 
against western defensive and economic measures. Although 
the Soviet reaction has not yet fully crystallized, the shift of 
Molotov and Vishinsky probably indicates, as does the adoption 
of a militant policy by the Communist parties outside the 
Soviet Union, a continuation of present aggressive Soviet 
policy toward the West (see page 5). Meanwhile, evidence 
Is growing in the Balkans that the Kremlin is preparing to 
take such drastic steps to overthrow Tito that military action 
could result (see page 7). 
The invasion of southeastern Negeb by Israeli forces 
will complicate the work of the Acting UN Mediator and the 
UN Palestine Conciliation Commission (see page 10). This 
Israeli attempt to determine a territorial issue by force will 
weaken the desire of the Arab states to continue negotiations 
for a comprehensive settlement and has practically eliminated 
the possibility of an agreement based upon the UN partition 
resolution. Although this Israeli action will probably not re-
sult in a renewal of widespread fighting between Jews and 
Arabs, the recent trend toward growing stability in the Middle 
East has received an abrupt, though possibly temporary, 
setback. 
Confronted with greater Security Council pressure to 
restore the Republican government to Jogjakarta and the 
collapse of Dutch plans for a Hague round table conference, 
the Netherlands Government may soon be forced to make new 
concessions in its Indonesian policy (see page 13). In China, 
Acting President Li Tsung-jen s "unofficial" peace mission 
to the Chinese Communists has apparently met a Communist 
willingness to bargain over some of their harsh surrender 
terms (see page 12). If General Ho Ying-chin accepts the 
proffered post of Premier, Li will then have a better oppor-
tunity to form a Cabinet both sympathetic to his peace efforts 
and more acceptable to the Communists (see page 12).

WESTERN EUROPE 
GERMANY 
Berlin Currency Although Soviet reaction to the proposed 
issuance of the western "B" mark as the 
sole currency for the western sectors of Berlin will be swift 
and well-publicized, the USSR is not likely to interfere seriously 
or forcefully with the operation of the airlift. Soviet retaliatory 
action will probably take the form of further tightening of the 
blockade and may involve conversion of the Soviet eastern 
mark to a new currency. Soviet measures to curtail the move-
ment of supplies from Soviet-controlled territory to the west-
ern sectors will increase the hardships of the western popula-
tion, further impair the west sector economy, and probably 
require an increase in the airlift. Soviet authorities could 
tighten the land blockade by: (1) halting all rail traffic, in-
cluding the S-bahn and streetcars; (2) cutting off water traffic 
on the canals; (3) stopping or sharply reducing pedestrian 
traffic between the western sectors and Soviet-controlled 
areas; (4) barring all mail service; (5) cutting west-sector 
long-distance phone cables, local inter-sector phone lines, 
and all telegraph cables; and (6) splitting completely Berlin's 
systems of electrical, gas, and water supply, and the sewage 
disposal facilities. In determining the extent to which these 
measures will be applied, the USSR will be restrained prima-
rily by the economic repercussions in the Soviet zone, which 
would be deprived of important materials and skilled labor 
now being received from the western sectors of the city. If 
the USSR converts its present eastern mark, it will do so in 
order to prevent eastern marks presently held in western 
Berlin from flowing back into Soviet-controlled territory. 
Such a Soviet move would leave western sector occupation 
authorities with the moral obligation to redeem a very large 
number of relatively worthless eastern marks in order to avoid 
undue hardship for the German holders of this currency.

ITALY 
Cabinet Crisis Although the withdrawal of the moderate 
Socialists from the De Gasperi Cabinet has 
been temporarily averted, the two principal issues which 
prompted the withdrawal attempt are still very much alive 
and may cause another Cabinet crisis. Although the moderate 
SocAlists will probably support the Government on the first 
issue (Italy's participation in the Atlantic Pact), a large 
section of the party continues to be strongly opposed to such 
alignment. This section dominates the directorate of the 
party and may even win control of the party at its extra-
ordinary convention scheduled for June. On the second issue, 
that of the Government's apparent leniency toward ex-Fascists, 
Moderate Socialists in Parliament have strongly attacked the 
Government, especially for its conduct of Fascist Marshal 
Graziani's trial and the exoneration of Fascist military leaders 
Raab. and Borghese. The proposed employment of ex-Fascists 
in key positions in the police force will further antagonize the 
moderate Socialists. In addition, the Government's general 
Inaction on promised social and economic reforms leaves its 
Socialist members in an embarrassing position before the 
working classes which it seeks to represent. 
PORTUGAL 
Economic Troubles Growing popular dissatisfaction re-
sulting from Portugal's deteriorating 
economy may eventually threaten Prime Minister Salazar's 
position, unless foreign aid arrests the present economic 
trend. This dissatisfaction is most pronounced among the 
country's middle classes, which provide most of the officers

because he had instituted mild austerity measures, will 
strongly resist any further tightening of controls. Mean-
while, Portugal's economy is going from bad to worse. 
The critical shortage of foreign exchange is forcing the 
Government to consider imposing import controls even 
more stringent than those already in effect. Markets for 
normal Portuguese exports have fallen off, while imports 
have reached unprecedented highs since the war. Poor 
harvests have necessitated increased imports of foodstuffs 
and aggravated the drain on foreign exchange. Failure of 
last season's sardine run has almost paralyzed one of the 
country's most important foreign-exchange-producing 
industries.

.EASTERN EUROPE 
SOVIET UNION 
Recent Soviet reaction to western economic and defensive 
measures, though not yet crystallized, has thus far manifested 
itself chiefly by top-level changes in ministerial positions in 
Moscow and by an apparent shift in tactics by Communist Parties 
outside the Soviet Union. The implications of Molotov's and 
Mikoyan's shift from their ministerial posts will probably be 
clearer after the current session of the Soviet parliament, but 
no basic change in Soviet policy toward the West is expected. 
The USSR will continue its attacks on the Atlantic Pact, its 
obstructionist policy in the UN, and its attempts to gain control 
over all of Germany. Meanwhile, however, Communist Parties 
outside the USSR are apparently reverting to the active, militant 
policy of the 1920's. 
Molotov-Mikoyan The Kremlin decision to relieve Molotov 
from his position as Foreign Minister and 
Mikoyan as Minister of Foreign Trade, although not an indica-
tion of any fundamental change in Soviet policy, probably does 
reflect a Soviet reassessment of the progress of the cold war. 
Molotov's shift may reflect the Kremlin's belief that the 
problem of formal relations with the West has been reduced to 
secondary importance by western gains and the growing inability 
of the USSR to make progress on the diplomatic level. Similarly, 
western gains have made it more imperative for the USSR to 
consolidate its position in Eastern Europe and Communist China. 
Thus, although Molotov may have been released for the purpose 
of taking over Stalin's position as Premier, he, as well as 
Mikoyan, may have been relieved of ministerial duties in order 
to concentrate on the pressing political and economic problems 
of the Soviet sphere.

SOVIET UNION 
? 
Communist Militancy The apparent failure of recent Soviet 
diplomatic and propaganda weapons 
to sabotage US-European defense efforts and to gain popular 
support for Communism has prompted the Kremlin to order 
Communist Parties outside the Soviet Union to prepare for 
militant and subversive methods in pursuit of Soviet objectives, 
This announced reversion to the active militant policy employed 
by the Communist Party in the late 1920's may, therefore, 
signify the end of postwar tactics which were characterized 
by so-called "legal" Communist operations within established 
political frameworks. This shift in political tactics apparently 
implies a renunciation of the popular-front technique of co-
operation with non-Communist governmental factions. 
Atlantic Pact Continued Soviet efforts to defeat the purposes 
of the Atlantic Pact are revealed by recent 
Polish feelers for non-aggression pacts with the Scandinavian 
countries. The Polish campaign is apparently concentrating 
on the minimum goal of preventing a formal Swedish alliance 
with the West. Aside from the strategic and political factors 
which make Scandinavia a natural goal for Soviet hegemony, 
the USSR's industrialization plans for Poland and Czechoslo-
vakia depend upon an uninterrupted flow of imports from 
Sweden. Likewise, Polish coal has long played a significant 
part in Scandinavian industry, especially Sweden's. Thus, 
aside from the USSR's interest in preventing closer political 
and military cooperation between Sweden and the West, the 
Soviet Union is desirous of maintaining uninterrupted the vital 
economic lifeline from Scandinavia to the Satellites.

YUGOSLAVIA 
Reports of increased military activity in Bulgaria and 
Albania, combined with recent changes in Communist activities 
In northern Greece, suggest that the Kremlin is preparing a 
greatly intensified campaign for the overthrow of Tito. Realiz-
ing that six months of dialectical battle and relatively minor 
diplomatic and economic reprisals have, if anything, driven 
Tito further toward the western camp, the Kremlin now appears 
to be planning more drastic steps, which may possibly end in 
overt military action. 
Greek Guerrillas An apparent shift in Communist activity 
in Greece strongly suggests that the 
Kremlin has decided to abandon temporarily its campaign to 
gain control over all of Greece and instead to attempt to 
exploit the Macedonian question as an additional weapon 
against Tito. The guerrilla radio has announced that an 
autonomous Macedonian state would be proclaimed in March. 
This new strategy is probably an attempt to gain the support 
of the large Slavo-Macedonian population in northern Greece. 
The autonomous Macedonian state envisaged by the Commu-
nists would, if established, tend to undermine the Tito regime 
and would thwart Tito's deep-seated ambitions for a Mace-
donian state under Yugoslav control. The Kremlin may also 
believe that it can secure such long-range benefits as an 
Aegean port, a land route between Bulgaria and Albania, a 
curtailment of Greek economic resourcespand a base which 
could serve as a strategic threat against Greece, Yugoslavia, 
and Turkish Thrace. Aside from the possibilities such a plan 
offers for increasing the pressure against Tito, however, it is 
unlikely that the USSR will derive much benefit from raising 
the controversial Macedonian question at this time. Although

Greek Communist leaders have, in a hedging statement, 
announced their aupporti*Ititladependent Map004911*?the 
meat of Greece. Moreover, even with Slavo-Macedonlan 
reinforcements, the 'guerrillas would be too weak to hold 
ground against the Greek Army without open intervention by 
the Satellites. 
Military Preparations Meanwhile, the USSR is reportedly 
stepping up military preparations 
elsewhere. Top-ranking Satellite military leaders are re-
ported to be meeting at Debrecen, Hungary. Although the 
meeting may be designed to establish a "defensive" East 
European military bloc as a counter to the Atlantic Pact, 
plans for exerting greater military pressure on Yugoslavia 
may also be on the agenda. Bulgaria is reportedly increas-
ing its flow of supplies to the Greek guerrillas in eastern 
Thrace. A noticeable increase in Soviet military activity 
Ms been observed in Albania. Soviet supplies and arms are 
arriving at Albanian ports, and numerous reports have been 
received indicating the landing of Soviet personnel and air-
craft. Moreover, increased Albanian protests of Yugoslav-
inspired border incidents, although at this stage probably 
a stepping-up of the war of nerves, could be used as an 
excuse for eventual armed action against Tito. 
Yugoslav Reaction The Tito regime, in the face of these 
signs of increased Soviet pressure, 
shows no sign of capitulating to the Kremlin. Finally break-
ing an enigmatic silence on the proposal for an autonomous 
Macedonia, the Yugoslav Government has issued a denuncia-
tion, contending that the proposed campaign for an independent

Greek and Macedonian guerrillas; and (2) was merely a part 
of the Cominform campaign against Yugoslavia. The Tito 
regime will exert every effort to prevent the formation of 
such a state and will publicly accuse Bulgaria of violating its 
past pledges for cooperation in handling the Macedonian ques-
tion. In conclusion, there is no reason to believe that Tito 
will be intimidated by these Soviet measures, and any attempt 
short of overt military action will probably fail to dislodge him, 
Moreover, present Satellite armed forces are not strong 
enough to overcome the Yugoslav Army unless they are strongly 
supported by Soviet troops and materiel.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA 
PALESTINE 
Threat to Peace The advance of Israeli military forces into 
the southeastern Negeb, in violation of the 
July 1948 UN truce, represents another attempt by Israel to 
determine by force a territorial issue which the UN has ordered 
to be settled by negotiation through the good offices of the Pales-
tine Conciliation Commission. Although this Israeli advance is 
not expected to result in a renewal of large scale fighting between 
Arabs and Jews, it will: (1) weaken the desire of the Arabs 
to pursue the present armistice negotiations; (2) complicate 
the work of the UN Acting Mediator and the UN Palestine Con-
ciliation Commission; and (3) practically eliminate the possi-
bility of a peace settlement on the basis of the 1947 UN partition 
resolution. 
The recent signing of the Rhodes armistice created the 
impression that such a settlement could be achieved without 
further military moves. In order to encourage Arab coopera-
tion in such a settlement, the US recently reiterated to the 
Arab states the concept officially enunciated in the UN on 
21 November 1948 that, if Israel desired territorial additions 
beyond those specified in the partition scheme, Israel would 
have to offer an appropriate exchange. The forfeiture by 
Israel of the southern Negeb in exchange for western Galilee 
appeared to provide the best, and possibly only, means of 
establishing such a territorial settlement between Arabs 
and Jews. The present Israeli advance indicates that Israel 
has no intention of making such an exchange but, on the con-
trary, is determined to claim all the territory it can control. 
The Israelis will now assert that the Negeb territory they 
occupied was allocated to them by the partition resolution. 
At the same time, they will justify by right of conquest their 
control of such Arab-allocated territories as western Gali-
lee the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem corridor, Jaffa, Lydda, Ramie, 
and Beersheba. 
Unless Israel withdraws from the southern Negeb to 
its previous positions, the current armistice negotiations with 
Transjordan at Rhodes and with Lebanon at Ras en Naqura may 
be strained, if not broken cff, and Syria and Iraq will be in-
creasingly reluctant to enter into the negotiations. The Arab

states, which had been gradually coming to accept the status 
quo in Palestine, will again become embittered over Israel's 
lack of good faith and future intentions and may well become 
more disillusioned over the a bility of the UN to support them. 
The difficulty of achieving a comprehensive peace settlement 
has thus been materially increased and the recent trend toward 
growing stability in the Middle East has received an abrupt, 
though possibly temporary, setback. 
ISRAEL 
Civil Air Policy Israeli authorities are apparently attempt-
ing to develop civil air regulations patterned 
after those of the US and to free the civil air program from 
the hitherto rigid control of the military. The advice of US 
technicians will be sought in establishing civil air regulations, 
and a single commercial airline, EL AL Aviation, will operate 
as the government's chosen instrument for international 
services. Reputable foreign air carriers will be encouraged 
to use the civil airport at Lydda, which will be operated by 
US-trained personnel. The first route proposed to be flown 
by EL AL will be from Lydda to Paris; no flights to the USSR 
are contemplated at this time. 
TURKEY 
Bosphorus Maneuvers Recent combined maneuvers in the 
Bosphorus area indicate that the 
training of Turkey's armed forces has not yet progressed to the 
point where the Strait can be successfully defended against a 
sudden, strong attack. Although basic, small unit operations 
were apparently satisfactory, serious deficiencies were manifest 
at the higher levels of command and staff coordination, such 
as command-post operation and communications. Weaknesses 
were also apparent in the employment of reconnaissance air-
craft and such specialized equipment as submarine detection 
devices and searchlights. In view of the relatively short time 
during which US equipment and US training have been available, 
these deficiencies were not unexpected, and the lessons derived 
from the maneuvers should materially assist in the long, slow 
process of modernizing the Turkish armed forces.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Peace Progress Acting President Li Tsung-jen appears to 
have made progress in his attempt to initiate 
peace negotiations with the Chinese Communists. The National 
Government's "unofficial" peace mission, recently returned 
from talks with Communist leaders Mao Tse-tung and Chou 
En-la!, has reported that the Communists seem willing to modily 
some points of their eight conditions for accepting peace. The 
peace mission managed to secure a tentative agreement to hold 
an "official" peace meeting sometime after 15 March. Despite 
Li's progress, belligerent Communist broadcasts and speeches 
Indicate that the Communists still aspire to control all China, 
prefer to take over on a regional rather than national basis, 
and wish to establish control by political rather than military 
means. In any future peace negotiations, therefore, Li's regime 
would not in fact be a "national government" concluding a 
national agreement, but a single regional regime assisting the 
Communists to conclude additional regional agreements. As 
a matter of military preparedness, the Communists will con-
tinue to hold their armies in readiness for a southward drive 
if peace negotiations with Li's regime are unsuccessful. 
Nationalist Unity Meanwhile, Li's efforts to consolidate his 
control over what is left of Nationalist 
China hang in the balance as a result of the resignation of ex-
Premier Sun Fo and his Cabinet. This move has freed Li of 
one of the major obstacles to his efforts to consolidate his 
political control and has given him the opportunity to form a 
Cabinet more sympathetic toward his peace efforts as well as 
more acceptable to the Communists. Now under consideration 
to replace Sun Fo is General Ho Ying-chin (a former Chiang

follower), who represents a compromise among various 
Nationalist political factions and has considerable influence 
with the Whampoa military clique. If Li fails to gain the 
support of Ho (or an equally powerful leader), Sun Fo's 
resignation will have caused great difficulty for the Li gov-
ernment. Regardless of the outcome of these political nego-
tiations, Les control is still threatened by a growing Chinese 
economic fragmentation. Chiang Kai-shek still controls the 
major part of the National Government's gold and silver 
reserves and Li's regime is facing mounting difficulties in 
collecting revenue from the provinces. 
Consulate Closing The closing of the Soviet consulate in 
Peiping is probably a move to obtain 
local advantages rather than an indication of a fundamental 
change in Soviet-Chinese Communist relations. The Chinese 
Communists have imposed increasingly r igid restrictions 
on the activities of foreign missions in Peiping and other 
Communist-occupied cities. Thus, the USSR may have closed 
Its consulate in order to avoid operating under the humiliating 
restrictions which have been imposed on other foreign missions. 
Such a step would not affect Soviet operations in Peiping or 
Soviet relations with the Chinese Communists, both of which 
can be effectively carried on through ?arty and unofficial 
channels. 
INDONESIA

restore the Republicans to authority in

number of reasons, the Netherlands Government appears to 
be in a weaker bargaining position than the Indonesian 
Republicans: (1) the Dutch are attempting to defy the SC, 
thereby incurring the threat of economic sanctions from the 
Asiatic countries and the US; (2) guerrilla opposition in 
Indonesia will probably continue unless the Dutch can placate 
the Republicans; and (3) military operations are proving a 
heavy burden which the Dutch cannot sustain indefinitely. 
Added to these difficulties, the Dutch are losing the support 
of the Federalist Indonesians, a support which the Dutch have 
constantly cited as proof that their policies are actually in 
the interest of the Indonesian majority. It has now become 
very doubtful that the Federalists will negotiate an agreement 
for the formation of a United States of Indonesia without 
restoration of the Republic. Further SC action may be neces-
sary to convince the Netherlands that modification of the 
Dutch stand is necessary, and compromises will undoubtedly 
be difficult to make without causing a succession of govern-
ment crises. Liberalization of Indonesian policy, however, 
will probably be achieved through internal shifts within the 
major right-wing parties rather than through a basic change 
in the composition of the coalition Government. 
SIAM 
Uneasy Peace Current uneasiness in Bangkok has been 
heightened by the Phibul Government's 
arrest of many Free Thai proponents and the murder of 
four important followers of ex-Premier Pridi. The joint 
army-navy truce committee, far from resolving the Pridi-
Phibul political impasse, has merely delimited the area of 
responsibility of the armed forces,and General Kach continues 
to exercise strong influence over the army and the Government, 
despite naval and civilian opposition. The present unsettled 
state of affairs in Siam will, in all probability, continue for 
several months.

Labor Control The Venezuelan Government's recent dis-

THE NEW ISRAELI CABINET 
In forming Israel's first non-provisional government, 
Prime Minister Ben-Gurion not only obtained a strong work-
ing majority in the Assembly but also succeeded in maintain-
ing firm control for MAPAL When Ben-Gurion invited the 
other Israeli parties to join MAPAI in the new coalition, he 
made it clear that those entering the government must accept 
the principle of collective responsibility and support MAPAI's 
program. The program is based on: (1) friendship and co-
operation with both the US and the USSR; (2) an Israeli-Arab 
alliance; (3) a majority of constructive labor elements in the 
government; and (4) complete civic equality for women, 
Christians, and Moslems. Ben-Gurion rejected the demands 
of MA.PAM (the left socialist party which had played a part 
second only to MAPAI in the provisional government) that the 
Government: (1) decline any Marshall Plan aid offered Israel; 
(2) refuse bases to the western powers; and (3) balance trade 
between the Eastern and Western blocs. Consequently, the 
APAM Council voted 150-33 to remain in opposition. 
The new Cabinet is thus more completely dominated 
by MA PAT than was the provisional government. The '7 posts 
held by MAPAI include all of the important ones; the United 
Religious Bloc has 3 portfolios; the Progressives and the 
Sephardim 1 each. f.Ben-Gurion is still holding 4 portfolios 
open for MA PAM and the General Zionists, who wanted more 
than the single post offered them.) The new government has 
an effective majority of 73 seats out of the 120 in the Assembly. 
Although without MAPAM participation the government 
will be generally more conservative than the previous govern-
ment, its policy will be comparatively clear cut and predictable, 
and it will continue to maintain theoretic neutrality while actually

leaning toward the West. The advantage of having unchallenged 
MAPAI leadership and responsibility in the government is 
partly balanced, however, by the disadvantage of having the 
second strongest party outside the government. Moreover, 
because MAPAI is pledged to socialism and civil equality for 
all, it will have to obtain its working majority through co-
operation with the older, more conservative elements in the 
state. MAPAM, composed largely of young, militarily trained 
agricultural settlers and unhampered by the responsibilities 
of government, will thus be able to go all out in attacking the 
government. In concentrating its opposition against the "pro-
West" and "subservient" foreign policy of the MAPAI govern-
ment, MAPAM may become increasingly pro-Soviet in its 
views. Meanwhile, the Herut, the Communist Party, and the 
Stern Gang will continue their vindictive, If ineffectual, opposi-
tion to the government.

SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTWITY AT THE UN 
Arrest by the FBI of Valentin Gubitchev points up the 
entire problem of continuing Soviet use of the UN Secretariat. 
for espionage and subversive activities. Potential espionage 
agents now employed in the UN New York office include more 
than 25 Soviet citizens, 38 Poles, 5 Czechosinvaks (Prague 
recently declared the other 25 Czechoslovaks persona non 
grata), 7 Yugoslays, and numerous Communists and fellow-
travelers of all nationalities. 
While many of the Soviet-Satellite staff members are 
suspected of being Communist-Soviet agents, Soviet reaction 
to the Gubitchev incident provides the most concrete evidence 
of Soviet control over this type of activity. Jacob Malik, chief 
Soviet delegate to the UN, while acknowledging Gubitchev's 
UN association, claimed that he was a member of the Soviet 
UN delegation traveling on a diplomatic passport. Even so, 
Gubitchev's activities conflict with Article 100 of the UN 
charter, which binds all member nations to respect the inter-
national character of the staff and provides that staff members 
shall not seek or receive instructions from any government 
or from any other authority external to the organization 
and shall refrain from any action which might reflect on 
their position as international officials responsible only to the 
organization. The Soviet demand that Gubitchev be released 
? on the grounds of diplomatic immunity reflects the Kremlin's 
fear that Gubitchev will reveal the extent of Soviet use of the 
UN for espionage activity. Moreover, the USSR hopes to 
employ the incident to support its propaganda claim of terror-
ist police control in the US. 
There have been other indications that Soviet Commu-
nist members of the UN Secretariat utilize their position for 
espionage or for furthering their own nation's views. The

Secretariat of the first Balkan Commission in 1947 evidenced 
pro-Soviet bias on numerous occasions. An atomic energy 
film, officially released by the UN Department of Public Infor-
mation, expounded the Soviet plan for atomic control with only 
a vague reference to the western proposal. A staff official in 
the secretariat of the Temporary Commission on Korea once 
prepared a statement (issued but later rescinded) which 
Impeded the work of the commission by reflecting unfavorably 
on the fairness of the Korean elections. And, the disappearance 
of certain documents during the 1948 Paris session of the UN 
General Assembly was attributed to Soviet staff members.
