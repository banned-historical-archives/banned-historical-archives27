 VIETNAM
 Operation ATTLEBORO has ended after killing 1,100
 enemy troops, destroying vast amounts of war materiel
 and disrupting the Communists'  political and military
 headquarters in War Zone "C."    Communist propaganda
 leaves little doubt that the Viet Cong will re-emphasize
 guerrilla warfare, with only cautious use of large-scale
 attacks.   The controversial issue of whether military
 candidates may run for public office has been raised  in
 the Constituent Assembly's discussions of the draft
 constitution.
 CAMBODIA LESS TOLERANT OF VIET CONG
 Some effort is being made to limit Viet Cong use of

 POLITICAL MANEUVERING IN INDONESIA
 General Suharto is planning to expand parliament to
 compensate for the fragmentation of his civilian sup-
 port.   Air Marshal Dani's much-postponed trial, now
 scheduled to begin on 5 December,  should clarify Su-
 karno's role in the abortive coup.
 THE MILITARY SITUATION IN LAOS
 The end of the rainy season has brought the usual flur-
 ry of Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese attacks against
 government positions in northern Laos,  but there is
 nothing to indicate that the Communists contemplate
 heavier fighting this year than in recent years.
 DIVISION IN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 There is further evidence that Lin Piao's drive to
 push through a major reorganization of the party has
 been opposed--effectively so far--by a group in the
 Politburo Standing Committee determined to preserve
 the party machinery substantially intact.

 FAR EAST
 VIETNAM
 Operation ATTLEBORO, the
 largest allied search-and-destroy
 action of the Vietnam war ended
 on 25 November.   The six-week
 campaign, which at one time in-
 cluded as many as 17 US and two
 ARVN battalions killed an esti-
 mated 1,100 enemy troops and cap-
 tured or destroyed vast amounts
 of enemy foodstuffs and war ma-
 teriel.
 Over the long term, perhaps
 the most. significant aspect of
 Operation ATTLEBORO will be the
 allies'  dramatic demonstration
 of their ability to commit an
 overwhelming number of troops
 quickly to combat in any area
 without seriously weakening other
 vital areas.   Even the temporary
 incursion into the Communists'
 long-time jungle stronghold in
 Tay Ninh Province probably is a
 serious psychological and politi-
 cal setback to them as their
 aura of invincibility was once
 one of their most potent politi-
 cal weapons.
 Guerrilla Warfare Re-emphasized
 A Liberation Front broadcast
 of 13 November left little doubt
 that the Viet Cong high command
 has decided to re-emphasize guer-
 rilla warfare in South Vietnam.
 This theme has been featured in
 Communist publications for sev-
 eral weeks, but the 13 November
 broadcast is the most detailed
 examination of the subject to
 date.
 It implicitly criticized a
 decision made by the Viet Cong
 high command in 1965 to trans-
 fer guerrillas to main force
 units.   It further criticized
 efforts by the Communist leader-
 ship in the South to challenge
 large US units equipped with
 superior firepower and mobility.
 It also cited Party First Sec-
 retary Le Duan as an authority
 for the present need to concen-
 trate on guerrilla warfare and
 to inte.risify Communist political
 efforts in the South.   This is
 one of the few times that the
 Liberation Front has publicly
 admitted that Le Duan is one of
 the principal architects of the
 Communist revolution in South
 Vietnam.
 Heavy losses to Communist
 main force units in engagements
 over the past year undoubtedly
 have convinced the Communists
 that they should revert to smaller
 scale guerrilla activity.   Such
 a shift,  however, will not end
 all large-scale Communist attacks
 in the South.   The Viet Cong will
 undoubtedly continue to launch
 such attacks when they believe
 the opportunity presents itself.
 It does imply, however, that
 the Communists will be much more
 cautious in committing their
 larger units to combat.   A sig-
 nificant drop in the average rate
 of battalion-size attacks has
 been apparent since July.
 The 13 November broadcast
 made it clear, moreover, that
 the new attention to guerrilla
 tactics does not mean that the
 Communists intend to stand down
 militarily.   The broadcast warned

 that to "pause at the defensive"
 is to invite annihilation and it
 pointed. out that even in guer-

 to keep the enemy under constant
 attack.
 Hanoi Scuttles Cambodian "Summit"
 Sihanouk has reportedly
 stated that his proposed "summit"
 meeting with Liberation Front
 and Hanoi leaders will not take
 place.    Hanoi apparently reacted
 coolly to the proposal,  suggest-
 ing that preliminary meetings
 be held at the foreign ministry
 level to establish the purpose
 of the meeting and an agenda.
 Constituent Assembly
 Making Progress
 After nearly two months of
 procedural deliberations,  the
 assembly empowered to draft a
 new constitution has begun de-
 bating the document's fundamental
 principles.  An agenda was adopted
 on 26 November and in only three
 sessions, the deputies approved
 a preliminary bill of rights.
 Discussions on the rights of
 citizens reflected the underly-
 ing regional and occupational
 biases of the deputies.   A pro-
 posal governing the rights of
 peasants to own their land and
 bearing on the whole question of
 land reform provoked heated argu-
 ments.
 At its 30 November session
 the assembly approved a proposal
 that "military personnel on ac-
 tive duty cannot join political
 parties or participate   in the
 government."   All of the articles
 adopted may be subject to further
 modification when the actual
 draft constitution is debated.
 The assembly's action on the
 issue of military candidates for
 public office may affect the out-
 come of its efforts to curb the
 Directorate's authority to re-
 vise the constitution prior to
 its final adoption.   Chief of
 State Thieu and his colleagues
 still have under consideration
 an earlier assembly proposal
 which would limit the Direc-
 torate's amending power.   They
 are expected to reach a decision
 on this proposal in the next few
 days.
 The assembly also approved
 four constitutional duties of
 citizens.   It is now scheduled
 to move on to a floor discussion
 of the future institutional form
 of the government.   The assembly
 hopes to wind up its work on the
 basic constitutional principles
 by Christmas,  leaving nearly
 three months to hammer out the
 draft constitution.

 POLITICAL MANEUVERING IN INDONESIA
 General Suharto and his col-
 leagues,                     although well launched
 on the transition from the Su-
 karno era to the "new order,"
 continue to encounter problems
 of accommodation with Indonesia's
 diverse political elements.
 The civilian front that sup-
 ported the army's anti-Communist,
 anti-Sukarno campaign during the
 past year is well on the way to
 disintegration.   Its elements
 now run the gamut from those who
 want more accommodation of Su-
 karno to those who espouse all-
 out opposition leading to his
 eventual removal.   The resulting
 loss of the army's sure parlia-
 mentary majority has kept Suharto
 from pushing some parts of his
 reform program.
 To remedy this situation
 General Suharto hopes to appoint
 110 new members to the present
 240-member legislature in the
 next month.   Sukarno initially
 refused to sign the decree, which
 authorizes an unspecified number
 of appointments.   He now has
 signed it,  obviously hoping to
 influence the size and composi-
 tion of the new contingent.
 Some of Suharto's appointees
 will be youth leaders, who are
 disappointed with his gradual ap-
 proach and frustrated at finding
 their own political role dimin-
 ished.   Their dissatisfaction
 focuses on the army's refusal
 to condone continued demonstra-
 tions against Sukarno,  and Su-
 harto hopes that putting youth
 leaders in parliament will divert
 them from street action.
 An abiding problem under
 the "new order"  is the basic dis-
 trust between the military and
 most political parties.   The pol-
 iticians resent army encroachment
 into the normally civilian sectors
 of the government.   The army dis-
 trusts the civilian politicians,
 feeling that the political leaders
 have little sense of national pur-
 pose and are chiefly interested
 in maneuvering themselves and
 their organizations into advanta-
 geous positions.
 Despite frustrations and in-
 evitable compromises,  the Suharto
 regime continues its moves to re-
 duce Sukarno as a political force.
 Air Marshal Omar Dani's trial,
 repeatedly postponed, now is
 scheduled to begin on 5 December.
 If Dani talks freely,
 his testimony will be the most
 damaging evidence to date on
 Sukarno's role in the abortive
 coup of October 1965.

 THE MILITARY SITUATION IN LAOS
 The end of the rainy season
 has brought the usual flurry of
 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
 attacks against government posi-
 tions in northern Laos, but there
 ,is nothing to indicate that the
 Communists contemplate heavier
 fighting this year than in recent
 years.   On the contrary, their
 ability to mount and sustain a
 significant offensive has been
 considerably reduced by US and
 Laotian air strikes on their
 troop and supply concentrations.
 Government positions at Tha
 Thom and Ban Ta Viang were over-
 run by a battalion-sized attack
 on 24 November but government
 troops counterattacked on 29 No-
 vember.   These positions, which
 defend Route 4 leading south to
 the Mekong plain, were lost and
 regained by government forces
 earlier this year.
 There have been reports that
 the Communists may attempt to re-
 take other positions in the north,
 but they probably plan to do noth-
 ing more than offset government
 gains made during the past rainy
 season.   Rice raids can also be
 expected during the coming har-
 vest  to                                                                     compensate for the ef-
 fects of US air strikes on the
 Communists' resupply activities.
 The resupply operation usu-
 ally observed early in the dry
 season apparently began several
 weeks ago.   From August to early

 DIVISION IN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 The Red Guard rallies staged
 in Peking on 25 and 26 Novem-
 ber did little to clear up ques-
 tions about Communist China's
 leadership.   On 23 November a
 printed Red Guard pamphlet made
 serious charges, verging on trea-
 son, against Chief of State Liu
 Shao-chi and party general secre-
 tary Teng Hsiao-ping.   It demanded
 their dismissal from all posts.
 "bourgeois line.. .has been defeated.
 A People's Daily article on
 27 November described the status
 of the cultural revolution in
 more standard terms, however.
 It said that there still remain
 a "tiny handful" of powerful
 party leaders to be brought down
 and others who were "consciously
 or unconsciously" opposing the
 cultural revolution to be brought
 into line.
 Liu and Teng, however, were
 present with Mao at the 25 Novem-
 ber rally as if nothing had hap-
 pened.   Mao shook hands with Liu
 as well as with other leaders on
 the reviewing stand.   According
 to the New China News Agency,
 Liu signed a state message sent
 to Mauritania on 27 November.
 The only significant absen-
 tee from the rally was Li Hsueh-
 feng, who replaced the disgraced
 Peng Chen as first secretary of
 the Peking city party committee
 in May.    Li has been under heavy
 attack in the past two months,
 through Red Guard posters and
 demonstrations, but until 25 No-
 vember he had appeared regularly
 at Red Guard rallies.   He may
 have been quietly dismissed.   If
 so, he is the only high official
 to fall in recent weeks.
 In a speech at the Albanian
 Embassy on 29 November, Premier
 Chou En-lai described the strug-
 gle in the past tense, but no
 other evidence supports this
 claim. Chou asserted that the "pro-
 letarian revolutionary line...
 has won victory"  and that the
 Information just received
 strengthens earlier indications
 that the current leadership has
 been at loggerheads since the
 11th party plenum in early Au-
 gust over the question of bringing
 down party leaders like Liu and
 Teng.   According to excerpts of
 a speech made by Lin Piao at the
 11th plenum,  reported in a Red
 Guard poster,   Lin demanded the
 "reorganization" of party cadres.
 "Until this can be done," he said,
 "we shall not break the situation
 of stalemate."   Asserting that
 his actions had Mao's full ap-
 proval Lin said that Mao had dele-
 gated considerable authority to
 him: "I do not interfere with
 him on major matters, nor do I
 trouble him on minor matters."
 The 23 November Red Guard
 pamphlet stated that it was re-
 peating charges made against Liu
 and Teng at the 11th plenum.
 Evidently the ultraradical fac-
 tion which brought the charges,
 presumably led by Lin, was able
 to make only minor ones stick.
 Liu and Teng,  although demoted
 in hierarchical rank, have ap-
 peared regularly at large turn-
 outs of leaders since the plenum.

 Red Guard factions have been
 in conflict over Liu at least twice
 since the 11th plenum.   According
 to a lengthy polemical tract is-
 sued by ultraradical Red Guard
 groups on 7 October, posters had
 been put up at Tsinghua University
 on 24 August strongly attacking
 Liu and demanding his dismissal
 and the reorganization of the cen-
 tral committee.   A force of 2,000
 Red Guards from other institutions
 were promptly sent to Tsinghua to
 suppress the posters and the group
 --Red Guards of Maoism--which had
 put them up.   The tract intimates
 that the suppression was authorized
 by Chen Po-ta and the Cultural Revo-
 lution Group of the Central Commit-
 tee, and it also paints Chou En-lai
 in an unfavorable light.
 Several times during October
 posters criticizing Liu reportedly
 were put up but were promptly re-
 moved.   There are credible reports
 that anti-Liu posters were suppressed
 on the morning of the 18 October
 rally,  resulting in fighting among
 Red Guards on such a scale that the
 rally was first  canceled  and then
 held in a curtailed form.  Elaborate
 preparations had been made before
 18 October for Mao and other lead-
 ers to appear on the reviewing stand,
 but all they did was drive through
 Tienanmen Square in a motorcade that
 lasted only half an hour.
 It now appears that an ultra-
 radical faction led by Lin has wanted
 all along to push through a major
 reorganization of the party.  It has
 apparently been opposed, effectively
 so far, by a group in the politburo
 standing committee determined to
 preserve the party machinery sub-
 stantially intact.   Mao's role in
 all this is obscure.   He may support
 Lin's program in general, but be
 unwilling to condone extreme action
 against Liu and Teng.
 The significance of attempts
 to bring down Liu and Teng in dis-
 grace is that they had been domi-
 nant leaders in the regular party
 machinery for more than a decade,
 and thus many party leaders at the
 center and in the provinces owe
 their careers to the two. A thorough
 discrediting of them would give the
 Lin forces a powerful weapon to use
 in dismissing, demoting,  or intimi-
 dating large numbers of party lead-
 ers.

 MOSCOW INTENSIFIES OFFENSIVE AGAINST PEKING
 Soviet leaders have intensified
 their attacks on China in an appar-
 ent effort to make the Peking re-
 gime anathema to the rest of the
 Communist world.
 Early this week, Pravda issued
 a bitter,  detailed indictment of
 "Mao Tse-tung and his circle." The
 article set out to prove that Mao's
 chauvinism,  and his determination
 to turn the Chinese Communist party
 Page  9
 into "an obedient, blind weapon to
 execute his will"  have deprived his
 regime of the right to call itself
 Communist.
 The editorial pointed out that
 the Chinese leaders now consider the
 USSR "enemy number one," and that
 they are also attacking the "over-
 whelming majority" of world parties.
 The Soviets would clearly like
 to secure a collective endorsement

 of an indictment such as that
 contained in Pravda, and, in this
 connection, they are keeping
 alive the idea of some kind of
 international Communist gather-
 ing.   A large-scale, formal party
 meeting on the order of the Mos-
 cow conferences of 1957 and 1960,
 which would be at least implicitly
 anti-Chinese, would be desirable
 from the USSR's point of view.
 The Russians have approved for-
 eign party assertions that condi-
 tions are "ripening" for such a
 gathering.
 The Soviet leaders may feel
 that, with Peking's fortunes at
 a low ebb, now is the time to
 press for a collective sanction
 of China, despite the expected
 opposition of many key parties.
 At the party congress in
 Budapest this week, Hungarian
 party chief Kadar and Brezhnev
 reiterated approval of the con-
 ference idea in the same quali-
 fied terms used by Zhivkov and
 Brezhnev at the Bulgarian party
 congress two weeks ago.  However,
 Kadar went beyond other recent
 statements to allow for a con-
 ference without all parties in
 attendance.   Moreover,  Russian
 propaganda has become more openly
 critical of those recalcitrant
 parties who, "out of fear of of-
 fending the splitters, avoid any
 initiative to solve current prob-
 lems."
 The Russian leaders, how-
 ever, have no reason to expect
 %mooth sailing, should they press
 in earnest for a formal, all-
 party conference.   The continu-
 ing reluctance of several key
 parties to go along with this
 idea was evident in the generally
 unenthusiastic reaction to it at
 the Bulgarian party congress. In
 order to secure the agreement of
 eight ruling Communist party lead-
 ers to assemble for an innocuous
 gathering in Moscow last October,
 the Soviets had to  forgo  any ex-
 plicit attempt to exploit that
 gathering in their offensive
 against Peking.
 In view of this, Moscow has
 been circumspect in advancing
 the meeting proposal, and there
 have been no reliable reports
 that the Russians are doing any
 real arm-twisting.   The Rumanian
 ambassador in Moscow recently
 told his Canadian colleague that
 a conference was not envisaged
 "even by the Russians for the
 near future."
 The evidence at hand suggests
 that Moscow will eventually have
 to settle for something less than
 what it may now hope to achieve.
 The Soviet leaders probably even
 now suspect this will be the case.
 In preparing a possible fall-back
 position, they have been careful
 to endorse other modes of "col-
 lective work" such as more exten-
 sive bilateral and regional con-
 tacts, as well as a world meeting.
 In any event, any mammoth conclave
 --if there is to be one--will prob-
 ably await a fitting occasion, such
 as the USSR's 50th anniversary cele-
 brations next year.

 EUROPEAN COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE
 The Europeans want a larger
 share of communications satellite
 business,  now predominantly Amer-
 ican and the only sector of space
 investment that promises an early
 commercial return.   Interest in a
 regional European satellite sys-
 tem is growing,  fed by mounting
 resentment of US domination of
 the International Telecommunica-
 tions Satellite Consortium
 (INTELSAT).
 The European Conference on
 Satellite Communications  (CETS),
 meeting in The Hague on 22-24 No-
 vember,  requested the European
 Space Research Organization  (ESRO)
 to draw up specifications for an
 experimental satellite for use in
 a regional European system.   The
 CETS plan recommends that three
 such satellites be built and that
 they be orbited by the European
 Launcher Development Organization
 (ELDO).   Although CETS,  an advi-
 sory group of telecommunications
 authorities, has no power,  its
 policies generally have the sup-
 port of member governments.   ESRO
 will decide next month whether to
 accept the request.
 Some months ago,  in an effort
 to gain the lead in European sat-
 ellite technology,   France com-
 pleted her own plans for a commu-
 nications satellite serving Europe
 and Africa.   On 30 November Paris
 announced plans to orbit two com-
 munications satellites by 1970.
 Because the project would be too
 costly for the French alone,  they
 recently decided to invite Brit-
 ain and other European nations to
 participate.   At a meeting with
 French officials in Bonn in early
 November, West Germany agreed to
 support the project providing it
 would not prove divisive to either
 ESRO or INTELSAT.   The Germans in-
 sisted that ESRO build the satel-
 lite and asked that it be brought
 under INTELSAT sponsorship in
 keeping with the European commit-
 ment to a single global INTELSAT
 system.

 FRANCO PRESENTS NEW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR SPAIN
 The long-awaited constitu-
 tional reform which General Franco
 unveiled in a speech to the Cortes
 on 22 November will make some
 cautious changes in the political
 machinery when adopted.    The
 changes will not immediately af-
 fect the authoritarian nature of
 the regime but they will permit
 some liberalization after Franco
 goes.
 On 14 December a national
 referendum--the one occasion on
 which universal suffrage is per-
 mitted---is expected to endorse the
 Cortes' approval of the law.   The
 government has begun a country-
 wide propaganda campaign to get
 out a large affirmative vote.
 The new law reaffirms much of
 the 1947 law which declares Spain
 to be a monarchy and provides ma-
 chinery for choosing Franco's suc-
 cessor as chief of state.   In ad-
 dition the new law would authorize
 the chief of state to appoint a
 premier from among three candi-
 dates proposed by the Council of
 the Realm, an advisory body which
 also participates in selection of
 the chief of state.   The premier
 is to serve for five years at the
 pleasure of the chief of state
 and may not be removed by the
 Cortes.   He will administer the
 government and propose other mem-
 bers of his cabinet.
 Thus Franco's dual positions
 as chief of state and chief of
 government can be separated.   Un-
 der Franco, a premier would prob-
 ably have limited responsibility
 similar to that of the French
 premier under President de Gaulle.
 After Franco goes, however, it is
 expected that the premiership
 will be the center of executive
 power.
 The new constitution provides
 a few measures of political lib-
 eralization.  About one fifth of
 the Cortes members are to be
 chosen by direct vote of "heads
 of families and married women."
 The majority, however, will still
 be chosen indirectly by the munic-
 ipalities and various corporate
 groups much as syndicates and
 professional organizations.
 The National Movement, which
 is the only legal political organ-
 ization in Spain, has had its
 role reduced to that of guardian
 of the nation's ideological prin-
 ciples.   Its high council will be
 transformed into a national coun-
 cil, comparable to an advisory
 upper house.   It loses legal con-
 trol over the labor syndicates
 which get a larger representation
 in the Cortes.   The principle of
 religious liberty for non-Catho-
 lics is provided as a legal right.
 The chief disappointment
 for those opposed to the regime
 was Franco's denunciation of po-
 litical parties.   Nevertheless,
 Franco's statement--the exclusion
 of parties does not rule out the
 "legitimate conflict of opinion"--
 may present an opening for the op-
 position to express views within
 the narrow framework of the Na-
 tional Council and the Cortes.

 DANISH ELECTION AFTERMATH
 Denmark's swing to the left
 in the 22 November general elec-
 tions has stirred up its normally
 placid politics.   Prime Minister
 Jens Otto Krag intends, however,
 to reconstitute a  minority  gov-
 ernment.
 tween the two parties on domestic
 issues.   Larsen indicated that
 the SPP will support the Social
 Democrats' controversial tax re-
 form proposals which in October
 precipitated the call for elec-
 tions.
 Krag's Social Democratic
 Party (SDP) was the chief loser
 in the election.   It dropped
 seven of its 76 seats, but it
 remains the largest party in the
 175-member parliament.   The ex-
 treme leftist Socialist People's
 Party (SPP) was the principal
 gainer, increasing its strength
 from 10 to 20 seats.   The posi-
 tion of the four major non-So-
 cialist parties remained rela-
 tively unchanged.   This bloc has
 86 seats in parliament.
 Krag last week explored the
 possibility for forming a coali-
 tion with the SPP, but talks broke
 down because the SSP leader, Aksel
 Larsen, insisted on drastic cuts
 in the defense budget and in con-
 scripts' length of service.   These
 demands, as well as Larsen's pro-
 posal to prohibit joint military
 exercises on Danish soil, would
 further hamstring Denmark's ac-
 tivities in NATO.
 There appears to be a con-
 siderable area of. agreement be-
 The extent to which the SPP
 will be able to influence govern-
 ment policy depends on how much
 difficulty Krag has in trying to
 put through his program and thus
 on how much he has to rely on SPP
 support.   On foreign policy and
 defense matters Krag will continue
 to depend on the backing of the
 "bourgeois" parties (non-Socialist).
 In order to stem the grow-
 in defections from the Social
 Democratic left wing to the SPP,
 Krag may feel compelled to pro-
 pose more generous social welfare
 programs as a means of competing
 with the popular and dynamic im-
 age of Larsen and his party.
 Confronting Krag and other party
 leaders are the examples set in
 Norway and Sweden where long-
 entrenched Socialist parties re-
 cently suffered electoral defeats
 that removed one from power and
 greatly weakened the other.

 THE SITUATION IN JORDAN
 The turmoil in Jordan has sub-
 sided after a week in which King
 Husayn faced his most serious in-
 ternal crisis in several years.
 There remains, however, an under-
 current of unrest among Palestinians
 over the government's defense pol-
 icy vis-a-vis Israel.
 tian and Syrian media.   The radical
 Baathist regime in Damascus has
 called for the formation of a pro-
 gressive front" in Jordan to over-
 throw Husayn by means of a "war of
 liberation."  Egypt's press and
 radio attacks on Husayn have become
 more direct during the past week.
 Demonstrations against Husayn's
 rule spread to virtually every town
 in Palestinian west Jordan and ap-
 proached riot proportions in Jeru-
 salem, Ramallah, Hebron, and Nablus.
 Some deaths resulted when the army
 and police forces moved in to re-
 store order.   Curfews and tight con-
 trols on travel between the towns
 were imposed, and schools were
 closed.
 The demands of many of the
 demonstrators indicated that the
 Egyptian-oriented Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization  (PLO)  was a
 strong influence.   In many in-
 stances crowds called for arming of
 civilians and for stationing PLO
 military forces along the Israeli
 border--PLO proposals that Amman
 has rejected.   PLO headquarters in
 Cairo has broadcast additional ap-
 peals for an uprising against
 Husayn, and this cry also was
 voiced by many of the demonstrators
 in Jordan.   The PLO, thus, has
 switched from a long-term effort
 to "liberate" Palestine from Israel
 to agitation for the immediate lib-
 eration of Palestinian west Jordan
 from Husa.yn's control.
 This campaign has been aug-
 mented by similar propaganda in Egyp-
 Nasir, however, anxious he may
 be to exploit the King's troubles,
 probably fears a revolution in Jor-
 dan would lead to war with Israel.
 Nasir's ambivalent attitude was evi-
 dent in a speech he made on 25 No-
 vember.   "We do not want to exacer-
 bate the tension on the west bank
 of the Jordan," he said.   "This par-
 ticular line of our political and
 military confrontation with Israel
 requires that we fully assess mat-
 ters."
 An Egyptian-Israeli air clash
 on 29 November underlined Israel's
 continuing superiority in military
 actions.   The Israelis claim that
 they shot down two MIG-19s; the
 Egyptians admit only that one of
 their MIGs "crashed" while on patrol.
 The Israeli Government evi-
 dently is concerned about the in-
 stability in Jordan ensuing from its
 13 November reprisal raid.  At
 least for the time being,  Israel
 may exercise some restraint in re-
 taliating for any new terrorism.
 The Jordanians have captured a ship-
 ment of arms and explosives al-
 legedly sent from Syria to a "Fatah"
 terrorist depot in Jordan--the
 first known shipment since 13 No-
 vember.

 PROPOSED ELECTORAL BILL EXCITES GREEK PARLIAMENT
 A dispute over a proposed bill
 for a simple proportional system
 for counting the popular vote in
 the next Greek election is further
 threatening Prime Minister Stephan-
 opoulos' already shaky grasp on the
 reins of government.
 The National Radical Union
 (ERE), which reluctantly has pro-
 vided the bulk of parliamentary sup-
 port for Stephanopoulos, has now
 withdrawn its original support of
 the bill and has proposed an in-
 definite postponement of parlia-
 mentary debate.
 Last week a caucus of Stephano-
 poulos' own Liberal Democratic Cen-
 ter Party reaffirmed its support
 for the electoral bill, but author-
 ized further talks with leaders of
 the ERE and Progressive parties.
 Stephanopoulos is expected to con-
 sult with the other party leaders
 late this week.
 Some ERE deputies fear that
 this proportional system would en-
 hance the electoral possibilities
 of candidates from small, splinter
 parties and thus discourage the es-
 tablishment of a "national front"
 against the alleged "popular front"
 of the Papandreous and the crypto-
 Communist United Democratic Left.
 Others fear that passage of any
 electoral bill now would prematurely
 excite the political atmosphere and
 hasten the date of the elections,
 which are not required by the con-
 stitution until 1968.
 Coordination Minister Mitso-
 takis wants immediate consideration
 of the bill and has demanded that
 Stephanopoulos resign if ERE con-
 tinues to oppose debate.  He has
 threatened his own resignation if
 Stephanopoulos gives in to the ERE
 proposal to defer debate.   Mitso-
 takis strongly favors the simple
 proportional system, which would
 enhance his chances for heading a
 splinter party of the center-right
 group, and he is opposed to the
 formation of any so-called "na-
 tional front."   Mitsotakis, how-
 ever, may retreat from his adamant
 position out of fear that even if
 he resigned the government might
 not fall and he would then be out
 in the political cold.
 An eventual agreement to post-
 ponement of debate may result, but
 the dispute has served to narrow
 the chances for continued political
 compromises on maior issues.

 Micombero proclaimed himself
 president, and set up a "revolu-
 tionary council" composed of him-
 self and 12 other Tutsi officers.
 He named military men as governors

 his father last July.   The King
 was supported by Tutsis who seem
 to have been less inclined toward
 harsh treatment of the country's
 Hutu majority and who were not
 strongly committed to the re-
 establishment of relations with
 Communist China.

 The faction around Micombero
 apparently was ideologically com-
 mitted to the abolition of the
 monarchy and has in the past been
 pro-Peking.   At least some of its
 members, including Attorney Gen-
 eral Simbananiye, have been iden-
 tified with harshly repressive pol-
 icies toward the Hutu.   Endemic
 clan rivalry within the Tutsi rul-
 ing group may also have played a
 part in the dispute.
 The new ruling group shares
 the general Tutsi fear and dis-
 trust of the US, and relations with
 the US will probably remain chilly.
 However, inexperience and a reluc-
 tance to offend Belgium, Burundi's
 major aid supplier, will inhibit
 drastic initiatives in foreign pol-
 icy, perhaps including even the re-
 establishment of ties with Peking.
 Moreover, the new regime will also
 hesitate to offend important neigh-
 bors such as the Congo.
 Its attitude toward Burundi's
 long-standing cross-border dispute
 with Rwanda is unclear.   Members
 of the new regime, however, have
 in the past aided Rwandan Tutsi
 guerrilla forces based in Burundi.
 Over the longer run, the
 country will be less stable with
 the removal of the King.   The
 throne, which has existed for 300
 years, was the object of venera-
 tion for Hutu as well as Tutsi,
 and it thus served to dampen the
 Tutsi-Hutu rivalry.  With the mon-
 archy removed, the Hutu--who con- 25X1
 stitute a majority of the army's
 rank and file as well as of the
 population--now are likely to
 grow increasingly restive.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 OPPOSITION WINS URUGUAYAN ELECTIONS;  COUNCIL SCRAPPED
 On 27 November the Uruguayan
 electorate approved a constitu-
 tional reform plan which changes
 the system of government to a
 presidential one from a nine-man
 governing council.   The president-
 elect is 65-year-old retired Gen-
 eral Oscar D.  Gestido,  a former
 council member and a member of the
 opposition Colorado Party, which
 swept to a decisive victory.
 Gestido takes office on 1
 March 1967 for a five-year term.
 He is widely respected as a good
 administrator and has a reputation
 for honesty.   He and his running
 mate, vice president elect Jorge
 Pacheco Areco, represent the mod-
 erately conservative wing of the
 Colorado Party.
 Gestido won in alliance with
 the Colorado Unity Front,  a group
 of opportunistic politicians
 united mainly for electoral pur-
 poses.   The well-oiled party ma-
 chinery efficiently delivered the
 vote.
 Both the Colorado Party and
 constitutional reform obviously
 benefited from widespread public
 dissatisfaction with the continu-
 ing economic and political crises
 which in part have resulted from
 the ineffective council system of
 government and in part from mis-
 management.   The new constitution,
 in addition to creating a presi-
 dency, will facilitate land re-
 form by redistribution,  through
 expropriation if necessary. It
 eliminates the former formula for
 bipartisan sharing of the executive
 boards of autonomous agencies,  es-
 tablishes a central bank on an
 effective footing,  increases the
 number of ministries from nine to
 eleven,  and exempts private
 schools as well as public schools
 from taxes.
 The Communist electoral
 front, FIDEL, made significant
 gains, garnering better than six
 percent of the total vote, or
 twice its showing in the 1962
 elections.   Its congressional rep-
 resentation increases from one to
 two senators--out of a total of
 30--and from three to five dep-
 uties--out of a total of 99.   The
 Communists therefore could hold
 an important swing vote because
 the Blancos and Colorados have
 divided the legislature fairly
 evenly.   This is especially true
 since party unity is not the
 norm in Uruguay.
 Gestido's electoral alliance
 will control less than half of
 the Colorado congressional total,
 and within the alliance his own
 faction is weaker than the Colo-
 rado Unity Front.
 President-elect Gestido has
 not yet announced his programs.
 His new administration will face
 severe challenges in dealing with
 a deteriorating economy, continu-
 ing Communist-inspired labor agi-
 tation,  and an expected surge in
 the cost of living.   Unless he is
 prepared to make some difficult
 decisions and is able to take
 many austerity measures, the coun-
 try may continue to suffer debil-
 itating economic and political
