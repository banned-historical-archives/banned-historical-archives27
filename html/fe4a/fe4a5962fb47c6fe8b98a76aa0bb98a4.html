 10 SEPTEMBER 197:5
 PIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW MARKEDLY DIMINISHES ATTENTION TO NEW SINAI ACCORD
 After a short initial burst of attention to the second Sinai
 disengagement accord, Moscow media have lapsed into almost tote,1.
 silence on it.   The 4 September signing of the agreement, boyco,_ted
 by Moscow, was reported by TASS from Geneva in a two-sentence
 account which noted that the agreement provided for a "limited.
 withdrawal" of Israeli troops "from a part" of occupied Egypt`-,in
 territory.  Soviet media apparently have taken no note of the
 first session of the Egyptian and Israeli working groups in
 Geneva on the 9th.   TASS reported only briefly and selectivel
 Secretary Kissinger's remarks on the Middle East in his 9 September
 news conference, and Moscow has thus far totally ignored Egyptian
 President as-Sadat's strong criticisms of Soviet policy in recent
 statements.
 In virtually the only press treatment, PRAVDA's international
 review on the 7th drew on Western press comment to portray the
 Sinai accord as falling far short of a settlement of the Arab-
 Israeli dispute.  Scattered TASS dispatches have played up the
 size of Israel's military shopping list, pointing out the cost to
 U.S. taxpayers of "U.S. obligations on stationing 'technical
 specialists"' in Sinai and military and economic aid to Israel.
 Moscow has evidently ignored some of the stronger Arab criticisms
 of the accord, such as the 4 September Iraqi Bath Party statement
 "denouncing and condemning" the agreement, as well as various
 Palestinian statements.  B.,t TASS called attention to the Syrian
 Ba'th Party statement and has cited Syrian President al-Asad as
 saying in a Prague speech that Israel, in signing the latest
 Sinai agreement, aimed at complicating the situation, dividing
 the Arab front, and increasing its military strength to avoid
 withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and recognition of
 Palestinian rights.  Other Soviet comment, in implicit digs at
 Cairo, has depicted Israel as increasing its settlement activity
 in occupied territories, PRAVDA on the 7th asserting that the "most
 significant" such plan concerned Egyptian territory, and a Moscow
 domestic service commentary on the 9th similarly pointing to the
 "colonization" of Sinai.
 KISSINGER REMARKS     Reporting Secretary Kissinger's 9 September
 news conference, TASS that day focused on
 his remarks on detente and, with respect to the Middle East,
 cited him only as saying that "there is a problem of conflicts,
 differences and tension in those areas where there is no direct

 confrontation between the United States and the USSR, for instance,
 in the Middle East.   In such areas conflict may arise, as a result
 of the already exii_ing tension there, lack of restraint on the
 part of the superpowers, and other factors."    In a second report
 on the news conference the following day, TASS omitted the
 reference to the Middle East and the second sentence in this
 quotation.   The dispatch on the 10th added two further paragraphs
 on Kissinger's Mideast remarks, citing him as saying the Egyptian-
 Israeli agreement "does not solve all the issues," and that a final
 agreement must include the issue of borders, a solution to the
 Palestine problem, and also international guarantees.   The second
 TASS account added that in this context,  the Secretary had said
 that "the United States recognized that in a final settlement in
 the Middle East, the role of the Soviet Union would be important."
 The treatment of the Secretary's remarks in the second TASS account
 is more consistent with previous Soviet handling of his references
 to a Soviet role than the first dispatch.   Thus, TASS had drawn
 attention to Kissnger's statement, after the January 1974
 disengagement agreement,  that the Soviet Union had played a
 constructive role at all stages in efforts for a settlement.  TASS
 at that time had also cited the Secretary as saying the United
 States had kept the Soviet Union informed of its actions.
 Similarly, after the May 1974 Golan disengagement agreement,
 Moscow had pointed to "useful consultations" on the matter by
 Kissinger and Gromyko in Geneva.*
 SOVIET-EGYPTIAN RELATIONS   Moscow has maintained silence on
 President as-Sadat's increasingly
 strong criticisms of the Soviet Union in his 4 September speech to
 a joint session of the People's Assembly and the ASU Central
 Committee and in an interview he gave on 7 September to the
 Kuwaiti paper AS-SIYASAH.   In his speech on the 4thh he noted that
 the Soviet Union had told Syria it would not attend the signing of
 the Sinai accord in Geneva, adding that this was a matter for the
 USSR, which was "free to decide" what it wanted.   But at a later
 point as-Sadat bluntly declared ghat he regarded the stand adopted
 by the Soviet Union that day "as an open provocation and an attempt
 to disrupt" the Arab ranks.   He went on to drop his fourth broad
 public hint since early May that the Soviet Union had been trying
 to subvert. Cairo's efforts for a second Sinai accord with
 "furtive whispering" and circulation of inaccurate reports about

 J.C) SEPTEMBER 1975
 "secret" agreements Egypt allegedly had concluded.   In his speech
 he claimed that in March "they" went "to Syria, they went to the
 Palestinians" and told them:   "Here is the agreement between
 as-Sadat, the United States and Jordan; you and the Palestinians can
 go to hell.  These are the secret clauses and the public ones."
 In a June Beirut AL-ANWAR interview, as-Sadat had said that this
 was "volunteered by a state outside this region," and in mid-May,
 whey. AL-I-IAWADITII chief editor al-Lawzi remarked in an interview
 with as-Sadat that "the Soviet sources" were the ones telling the
 Syrians and Palestinians about secret provisions, as-Sadat said
 he did not want to accuse anyone; "my relations with the Soviet
 Union are bad enough."
 Moscow may be using a circuitous route through the Beirut press
 to respond to Egyptian charges.   Thus,  the Beirut AS-SAFIR on
 4 August published a "political report" of the  supposedly
 reconstituted Egyptian Communist Party.   In his AS-SIYAS.'.ll
 interview held on 7 September, as-Sadat dismissed this as
 "ridiculous."  Egypt; he said, did not have a communist party
 and "this paper belongs to al-Qadhdhafi."  On 7 September,
 AS-SAFIR published an interview with a "senior Soviet official"
 who reportedly asserted that the USSR would not leave the Middle
 East to the Americans, and that Soviet officials were reassessing
 the USSR's Mideast policy "with the help of the views of Arab
 friends."  AS-SAFIR apparently was used as the vehicle in April
 1974 for a Soviet rebuttal of as-Sadat charges vis-a-vis Soviet
 efforts to obtain as-Sadat's agreement to a cease-fire shortly
 after the October 1973 war began.  At that time the Soviet side
 of the argument was presented in AS-SAFIR in a purported statement
 by Vladimir Vinogradov, formerly Soviet ambassador to Egypt and
 now Moscow's representative to the Geneva conference.  To lend an
 apparent stamp of authenticity, the statement was reprinted the
 next day in the Lebanese Communist Party organ, AN-NIDA'.*
 The statement attributed to Vinogradov is discussed in the TRENDS
 of 24 April 1974, pages 3-4.   It is conceivable that as-Sadat had
 Vinogradov in mind when he mentioned that "they" were talking to the
 Syrians and Palestinians in March.  Arab media--but not Soviet--
 reported Vinogradt,v's visit in March to Amman and to Beirut, where
 he had talks with PLO officials.  See the 12 Match 1975 TRENDS,
 pages 6-7.

 PORTUGAL
 USSR EVINCES CONCERN OVER "CONFUSION" AFTER GONCALVES              OUSTER
 Moscow has indicated its unhappiness over the changing scene in
 Portugal following the 5 September meeting of the '_.med Forces
 Movement (MFA) Assembly at which Gen Vasco Goncalves was ousted
 from the Revolutionary Council and forced to decline the position
 of armed forces chief of staff.   Soviet media, while still repeating
 Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) leader Alvaro Cunhal's call for
 unity, have openly discussed the extent of divisions within the
 country and even within the MFA itself.  The danger of a counter-
 revolution has been emphasized, Moscow radio reminding European
 socialists, who were meeting in London with Portuguese socialist
 leader Mario Soares, that "anticommunism eventually leads to the
 collapse of democracy as happened in Italy and Germany."  TASS,
 in its second--but not in its first--report on Secretary Kissinger's
 9 September news conference, noted without comment his remark that
 events in the past two weeks in Portugal "had been 'encouraging"'
 from the United States' viewpoint and that, "in his words, the
 United States was maintaining 'close cooperation' with its Western
 European allies concerning events in Portugal."
 DOMESTIC           Following the removal of Goncalves, Moscow has
 DEVELOPMENTS       professed to see a "growing struggle" in Portugal
 in s:ipport of the "progressive course."  But
 PRAVDA special correspondents Yermakov and Kotov, in a dispatch on
 the 9th, summed up Portuguese press speculation about the possible
 composition of a sixth cabinet with the observation that these
 "guesses" confirmed President Costa Gomes' assessment that the
 political situation was "extremely confused."
 Before the MFA Assembly meeting on the 5th, Igor Fesunenko, on
 Moscow radio's international situation program that day, had
 indicated guarded disapproval of efforts under way to reorganize
 the MFA, turning it away from "the socialist path" and toward
 "the path of liberal reforms."  Fesunenko noted that such efforts
 had "aroused bitter criticism" in the armer: forces and that the
 future "not only of the MFA Assembly but of the whole revolutionary
 process" depended upon the outcome.  In a 6 September dispatch
 following the revamped assembly's ouster of General Goncalves, TASS
 reported that Goncalves' nomination had been rejected because "the
 conservative-minded assembly of the ground forces expressed their
 nonconfidence."  Indirectly indicating Moscow's own displeasure,
 TASS noted Chat many Portuguese had condemned "the campaign organized
 against the Portuguese revolution and its prominent military leaders,"
 such as Goncalves and premier-designate Azevedo.

 Igor Fesunenko also presented a gloomy outlook in a 7 September
 radio report, noting that "the political situation continues to
 deteriorate in Portugal."  Critical of the changing nature of
 Portugal's military bodies, Fesunenko said that the assembly was
 a "reflection of the profound contradictions" within the MFA and
 stated that the new composition of the Revolutionary Council
 "omits several prominent figures," such as Goncalves, "who
 fought most consistently to deepen the revolutionary process."
 RIGHTIST      Moscow, holding the Portuguese moderates responsible
 "THREATS"     for Goncalves' downfall, has admonished them that
 they are "playing a risky game dangerous to themselves."
 In IZVESTIYA on 5 September V. Osipov noted that "there is, after
 all, some sense in the 'Chilean lessons'  for the Portuguese Socialist
 Party."  Osipov warned PS leaders that they were "playing into the
 hands of counterrevolutionary forces inside and outside Portugal"
 and cautioned that "if counterrevolution succeeds in getting its
 revenge, it will not stop at half-measures."  In a similar warning
 inspired by PS leader Mario Soares' London meeting with five West
 European Socialist leaders on the 5th, Anatoliy Antonov in a
 5 September foreign-language commentary told Western socialists they
 were wrong to "close their eyes to the fact that the visceral anti-
 communism of Soares has contributed much to aggravating the political
 crisis."  Antonov asserted that in giving "unconditional. solidarity"
 to Soares, social democrats were forgetting that "anticommunism
 eventually leads to the collapse of democracy in general, as happened
 in Italy and Germany in the 1920's and 30's."
 As if to underline the rightwing threat, Moscow has reported the
 activities of Gen Antonio de Spinola since his return to Europe.
 In a dispatch in the 6 September KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, Aleksandr
 Karmen reported Spinola's arrival in Paris, noting that "this is
 not the first time Spinola has been circling Portugal like a wolf."
 Karmen recalled that "the last trip coincided with the outbreak
 of anticommunist hysteria in Portugal" and, speculating on the
 significance of the current trip, Karmen observed that "he still
 has people he can rely on" both inside and outside the country.
 PEKING SEES GONCALVES RESIGNATION AS SETBACK FOR MOSCOW
 Peking has depicted the resignation of the Portuguese government
 headed by Prime Minister Vasco Dos Santos Goncalves as a significant
 setback for the Soviets in their attempts to penetrate Portugal.
 Peking's assessment was contained in two companion 8 September NCNA
 articles pegged to the Goncalves resignation, marking China's most
 extensive review of the Portuguese situation in three months.  The
 Chinese comment followed past practice in characterizing the USSR

 as Portugal's main enemy and in avoiding charges against the
 United States, but Peking this time was notably more sanguine that
 developments in Portugal would be contrary to Soviet interests than
 was NCNA's last review in June.  The current NCNA articles portray
 Moscow as faced with solid opposition from the United States, West
 European states, and most Portuguese leaders.
 The first of the two NCNA articles on 8 ,September noted the total
 collapse of Goncalves' political standing as prime minister, member
 of the Portuguese revolutionary council, and as one of the three
 leaders in the now defunct triumvirate directorate, attributing
 his fall from power to his pursuit of "a policy conducive to Soviet
 infiltration and expansion."  It portrayed widespread opposition to
 Goncalves' pro-Soviet slant from unnamed officers of the Portuguese
 armed services, from "certain military regions,' and from the
 Socialist and Popular Democratic parties,
 The longer NCNA companion piece portrayed the United States as
 resolutely refusing "to give an inch" against stepped-up Soviet
 intervention in Portugal, noting in particular that major Soviet
 press pronouncements in the past month about alleged Western
 meddling in Portugal had met with stiff countercharges of Soviet
 intervention from top-level U.S. leaders, including President Ford
 and Vic,: President Rockefeller.  NCNA's discussion pointedly avoided
 giving any credence to Soviet charges against the United States,
 while citing the foreign press for details of "Soviet tampering."
 Thus, NCNA played up reports that the USSR maintained a "huge
 embassy" in Lisbon, full of "Soviet spies disguised as diplomats,"
 many of whom had been "kicked out from Britain" and were now
 active in Portugal.   It also alleged that Moscow has provided
 "huge sums of money and even arms through various channels" in
 promoting "pro-Moscow elements."
 The article went on to detail increasingly firm opposition to the
 USSR and to Goncalves' pro-Soviet po.Licies by Mario Snares of the
 Portuguese Socialist Party, the Portuguese army chief of staff, and
 other prominent Portuguese, as well as from West European states.
 It claimed that Moscow's recent efforts to "absorb Portugal" had
 met with "stronger and stronger dissatisfaction and opposition."
 Peking's last comprehensive assessment of Portuguese developments,
 a 14 June NCNA commentary, had been markedly less emphatic in
 depicting opposition to Soviet goals in Portugal.  The June assessment
 had shown the United States and West Europe as perplexed and anxious
 over recent Soviet gains and lacking an effective stand against
 Soviet "expansionist activities."  That commentary had cited only the
 splinter, pro--Peking Corununist Party of Portugal (Marxist-Leninist)
 as then resolutely resisting the Soviet advance.

 U,S, -SOVIET  R ELATIONS
 ARBATOV DEFENDS DETENTE, REBUTS CRITICS OF HELSINKI AGREEMENT
 A strong defense of detente and of the Soviet Union's commitment
 to it are the main burdens of a major article by Soviet Americano-
 logist Georgiy Arbatov in the 4 September issue of IZVESTIYA.
 Designed ostensibly to rebut Western skepticism concerning the
 Soviet Union's commitment to the "Basket Three" provisions of the
 Helsinki CSCE agreement, Arbatov both reaffirmed the Soviet commit-
 ment in this regard and--by way of turning the  argument around--
 asserted that the Soviet Union has a better record than the United
 States in some aspects of cultural exchange policy.   Beyond this,
 he presented an appeal for patience and realism in assessing the
 results of detente, an appeal apparently designed to convince
 readers--in the Soviet Union as well as in the United States--that
 there is no alternative to "continuing the course toward detente."
 DETENTE COSTS     Arbatov took issue, particularly, with the view,
 allegedly being propagated in the United States,
 that recent setbacks in U.S. foreign policy, such as the threats
 to NATO caused by the Greece-Turkey imbroglio and by the leftist
 revolution in Portugal, were attributable to detente.   Far from
 blaming detente for these developments, he argued, Washington and
 its NATO allies should blame their own previous policies conducted
 during the "cold war."  The true causes of such events, he suggested,
 are rooted in history and are thus not susceptible to political
 manipulation.   In this connection, he reformulated an old Soviet
 commitment regarding the non-export of revolution.  While the
 Soviet Union will not undertake to maintain the status quo in the
 world, he said, it "does not regard the policy of detente as an
 instrument for nudging forward" processes of social change.
 SOVIET CONCERN      Arbatov has been a consistent advocate of improved
 relations between the Soviet Union and the United
 States and at the same time a frank critic of U.S. personalities
 and U.S. policies perceived to be inimical to U.S.-Soviet rapprochement.
 In recent months he has expressed what appears to be a genuine
 Soviet concern over the emergence of anti-detente sentiments in the
 United States.  The selection of Arbatov to write this article
 suggests that Soviet authorities wished to reiterate this concern
 in strong terms.  Arbatov was specifically critical of those in
 the United States he depicted as former supporters of detente who
 have fallen silent in recent months, intimidated by the new mood
 in the country in the wake of communist victories in Indochina and
 willing to accept a limited detente which has already diminished the

 immediate military threat of world war.  Arbatov asserted that such
 complacency was dangerous, since the two countries are at a
 crossroads and further steps crc necessary to avoid a regression
 in relations.
 While restating Soviet adherence to the freedom of information
 obligations in the Helsinki document, Arbatov made it clear the
 Soviet Union would not allow entry of "anti-Soviet, subversive
 propaganda," nor would it be deterred from its policy by Western
 clamor over freedom of information issues.  As Arbatov put it:
 "Only very naive people can believe that the campaign which has
 now been developed will make the USSR waive its sovereign rights."
 Arbatov concluded on a cautio..sly optimistic note, contending that
 there is in fact little alternative to detente, given the priority
 of the task of averting nuclear war and the increasing prominence
 of "global" problems such as shortages of energy and food requiring
 international cooperation for their solution.

 INTERNATIONAL  COMMUNISM
 FRENCH, ITALIAN CP'S DISPUTE MOSCOW ON REVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY
 Both the French and Italian communist parties, via articles in
 their respective newspapers, have given further replies to the
 controversial 6 August PRAVDA article by Konstantin Zarodov--
 an article that raised questions about the long-standing Soviet
 policy of encouraging alliances between non-ruling communist
 parties and socialist parties.*  Both papers were critical of
 Zarodov's controversial thesis that the democratic and socialist
 stages of the revolution  could be combined, and they rejected
 his invocation of Lenin's view that corlununist parties need not
 rely on an "arithmetical majority" in achieving power.
 L'HIUMANITE ARTICLE     A Jacques Chambaz article in the 4 September
 issue of L'HUMANITE, while acknowledging
 the importance of assimilating Lenin's contribution, asserted
 that Lenin's strategy could not be reduced to a "repetition of
 stereotyped formulas" nor to a "collection of abstract notions."
 Chambaz even went so far as to ridicule Zarodov's research, re-
 calling that Lenin--in the same article cited by the Soviet
 author--had also emphasized that one must not be satisfied with
 "stereotypes" and that those who mistake "some committee of
 archivists" for "creative implementation of Marxism" shorld be
 scorned.  Despite being a doctor of history, Zarodov appeared
 to believe that certain "elementary facts" were of "negligible
 importance," Chambaz noted.
 Rejecting Zarodov's most controversial conclusion that the demo-
 cratic and socialist stages were "interlinked and can even be
 solved simultaneously," Chambaz stressed that "advanced democracy"
 is a "necessary stage" in the development of socialism in France.
 Taking issue with Zarodov's contrasting of the "arithmetical
 majority" with the "political majority," Chambaz asserted that the
 PCF would never consider elections in France to be of "negligible
 importance."  "Democracy demands that the people's decisions be
 respected by all under any circumstance," he stressed.  Chambaz
 suggested that Zarodov's concept would lead straight toward rule
 by an "active minority."  Finally, in an apparent rejection of
 Moscow's authority in matters of doctrine, Chambaz said that in
 addition to the "laws of socialism" we must take into account inter-
 national experience, and this cannot be done by reducing principles
 to "lifeless formulas" which would be appl.icable "always and everywhere."

 L'UNITA ARTICLE     The article in the 24 August issue of L'UNITA
 did not mention the Zarodov article directly,
 but the issues discussed left little doubt that Zarodov was the
 target.
 Like L'IIUMANITE, the L'UNITA article argued--as it had in its
 earlier 12 August reaction to Zarodov--that there must be a
 "transitional stage" between capitalism and socialism.   The author
 of the L'UNITA article, deputy chief editor Claudio Petruccioli,
 acknowledged that "how to proceed to socialism" was a "very difficult
 question."  But simply to emulate the way other countries have
 proceeded at other times is "absolutely out of the question" and
 has "no relevance" to the existing situation, he added, disputing
 one of the basic themes of the Zarodov article.
 Petruccioli went on to stress that the achievement of socialism
 required the "fullest development" of consent and democracy,
 without which there would be an "unacceptable kind of socialism";
 Zarodov had said that "all and any deviations" from the revolution-
 ary Line must be "repulsed."  Like L'HUMANITE, Petruccioli emphasized
 that political freedom and universal sufferage must be recognized
 and accepted, in contrast to Zarodov's opinion that the "will of
 the majorit_;" need not depend on an "arithmetical concept" or "some
 kind of notional referendum." Finally, in a reiteration of PCI
 policy, L'UNITA argued that communist parties must be able to
 interpret and express the aspirations of the working class and
 people, but in so doing must work together with other democratic
 pclitical organizations, be they socialist or social-democratic.
 Zarodov had posited the communist party as the "only" force capable
 of fully and correctly interpreting the wishes of the people, and
 thereby the communist party had to maintain "hegemony" in the
 revolutionary process.
 Further emphasi'ing the need for socialist and communist unity,
 and taking note of recent events in Portugal, Petruccioli suggested
 that "continuous dialectic" between communists and socialists was
 "natural" and "right," but that historical and present differences
 should not conceal the heed for a common commitment aimed at the
 furtherance of democracy and progress toward socialism.   These
 differences, he stressed, should be minimized while remembering
 that the socialist and communist parties both stem from the
 proletariat and seek the same goal c.t trarsforming society.

 PEKING, MOSCOW TRADE CHARGES OVER RIGHTS TO VISIT MEMORIALS
 Moscow and Peking have exchanged harsh polemics over. Ch.tna's
 refusal. to allow Soviet delegates to attend this year's 2 September
 V-J Day ceremonies at memorials in Chinese provincial. cities honor-
 ing Soviet troops who died in China in 1945.  The conti :using
 stalemate in relations was reflected in the exchange, which evoked
 an official-level Chinese comment on the Soviet charges, now routine,
 for the first time since the Sino-Soviet border talks began In
 October 1969.   Peking's NCNA on 7 September publicized a 29 August
 PRC Fore'.gn Ministry "verbal statement" setting forth the reasons
 China had refused to permit Soviet delegates to attend this year's
 30th anniversary commemoration on 2 September,   NCNA's statement
 came in response to a 4 September TASS report charging that the
 PRC Fcreign Ministry's denial of a Soviet request to send a dele-
 gation on the anniversary had demonstrated fundamental "disrespect"
 by Peking for the Soviet people.
 Peking media in the past have generally confined their treatment
 of such anniversaries to reporting the attendance at commemora-
 tive ceremonies of Chinese officials and Chinese representatives of
 the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.  This year's public rebuttal
 of the Soviet complaint may have been prompted by Moscow's publiciz-
 ing last April--for the first time in recent years--of a Soviet
 Foreign Ministry protest alleging that the Chinese had desecrated
 Soviet war memorials in the PRC.
 CURRENT EXCHANGE      As has become traditional on the anniversary
 of the Japanese defeat, as well as on the USSR
 Armed Forces Anniversary each February, Soviet media reported that
 Chinese authorities refused permission for Soviet representatives
 to lay wreaths at memorials to fallen Soviet soldiers in several
 cities in northeast China on the 2 September anniversary.  The
 4 September TASS report and several radio accounts said the PRC
 Foreign Ministry had "rudely refused" the request of a Soviet war
 veterans group to visit memorials in China.  Apparently it made
 no difference to the Chinese that this time the request came from
 the veterans group "through appropriate Chinese organizations,"
 rathe':? than from tl'e Soviet Embassy in Peking, as on past anniver-
 saries.*
 *  Continuing a trend of recent years, Soviet commentary on V-J Day
 has sharply criticized the Chinese for their alleged ingratitude for
 Sr;vi.et assistance during and immediately after the war, while placing
 tt:e usual stress on the importance of the brief Soviet campaign against
 Japa:pse forces on the mainland in accelerating Japanese surrender.

 :1.0 SEPTEMBER 1975
 NCNA's 7 September account or the PRC Foreign Ministry refusal of
 29 August took p iins to display Chinese concern for the memory of
 fallen Soviet servicemen and a continuing strong desire for friend-
 ship with the Soviet people, while castigating the Soviet leadership
 for attempting to "create pretexts" and use "anti-China maneuvers"
 to "incite the Soviet people against China."  NCNA's account of the
 Ftatement used unusually blunt language to assess Sirio-Soviet
 friction, explaining that "it is impossible" for the Chinese to
 receive delegates sent from Moscow because the Soviet leaders
 "have massed and deployed their troops on the Sino-Soviet borders,"
 have "continuously sent numerous spies to China through various
 channels to carry out subversive activities and sabotage," and
 are engaged in a "rabid anti-China campaign."  NCNA claimed that
 the "Soviet renegade group" was unscrupulously exploiting the. memory
 of Soviet servicemen who died in the war  against Japan in China
 in order to serve its "anti-China policies."
 SOVIET APRIL PROTEST     The Soviet Foreign Ministry protest
 reported by TASS on 3 April this year had
 said that "Soviet representatives" placing a wreath at a memorial
 in the city of Man-thou-Ii in connection with the Soviet Armed
 Forces Anniversary in February had noted "desecration" of the
 memorial and notified local authorities, but to no avail.   It
 concluded that "official Chinese authorities encourage a blasphemous
 attitude" by Chinese citizens toward symbols of their cooperation
 against the Japanese.  The apparent acknowledgement that Soviet
 representatives  had been granted permission to visit a memorial in
 Man-chou-li, on the Soviet border, stood in contrast to a TASS
 report on the anniversary in February which had complained that
 once again USSR Embassy representatives had been refused permission
 to visit five cities in northeast China (not including Man-chou-li)
 though they had placed a wreath at the memorial in Wuhan in central
 China.  Soviet media have on occasion in recent years acknowledged
 permission for Soviet representatives to visit war memorials else-
 where in China, such as Wuhan, but never in the northeast or on
 the Sino-Soviet border.
 Peking had responded to the April Soviet protest with a lengthy
 14 April NCNA commentary attacking it as part of Moscow's continuing
 "groundless slander" designed to foster ant;-China feelings within
 the USSR so as to alleviate alleged popular discontent with Moscow's
 rule, and to reinforce alleged efforts by the "Brezhnev clique"
 prior to the May 1975 30th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi
 Germany to discredit China and portray the USSR leaders as the
 "true successors to the anti-fascist cause."

 VIETNAM
 PRG'S NGUYEN HUU THO RECEIVES FOREIGN ENVOYS IN SAIGON
 Restrictions on foreigners' travel to South Vietnam in effect since
 the April communist takeover apparently have now been lifted
 sufficiently following the DRV National Day celebrations to allow,
 for the first time, the entry of certain ambassadors into Saigon
 and visits there by low-level foreign delegations.   In addition to
 Vietnamese communist media accounts of various "international and
 national" delegations traveling to Saigon after attending National
 Day festivities in Hanoi, the media reported the arrival in Saigon
 on 6 September of six ambassadors from Cuba, the Congo, Mauritania,
 Sweden, Mexico, and Denmark and a "representative" of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO).*
 Subsequent reports have indicated that the ambassadors and the PLO
 representative presented their credentials in separate ceremonies
 to Nguyen Huu Tho--presumably in his capacity as president of the
 PRG Advisory Council--and were received by PRG President Huynh
 Tan Phat.   On a similar occasion in June 1973, on the fourth
 anniversary of the PRG, a large group of ambassadors from communist
 and Third World countries had visited northern Quang Tri Province
 in South Vietnam to present their credentials to Nguyen Hui Tho.**
 At that time, envoys front the Soviet Union and China were prominently
 featured at the head of the list of ambassadors participating.
 While the Cuban ambassador was absent from the 1973 ceremonies,
 the VNA report on that presentation had noted that the Cuban had
 already presented his credentials "in a liberated area of South
 Vietnam during the war" and bore the title "dean of the diplomatic
 corps in the RSV," an honor that undoubtedly accounts for the
 present Cuban ambassador being given pride of place in current
 reportage.
 Although the PRG has sent ambassadors to many of the 66 countries
 which have been reported to have accorded recognition, it is not
 *   An 8 September VNA version of the recent ambassadors' trip to
 the South implied there had been an earlier contingent.   In describ-
 ing their welcome in Saigon, VNA stated that "several more ambassa
 dors .  .  . have arrived in Saigon" and cited LPA as its source.  An
 LPA account of their arrival transmitted earlier that same day made
 no mention of a previous group of envoys, nor have other monitored
 Vietnamese media.

 clear from accounts of the latest group's credentials presentation
 whether any of them will actually take up residence in the South--
 although a 9 September LPA account implied as much when it
 declared they had arrived to "assume their posts."  Of the six
 ambassadors named, only the Cuban is solely accredited to the PRG,
 the other five having the additional responsibility of also
 representing their countries in Hanoi.
 VIETNAMESE, SOVIET LEADERS ATTEND HANOI MAUSOLEUM CEREMONIES
 The 29 August inauguration of the recently completed Ho Chi Minh
 Mausoleum in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square was the occasion for a
 "solemn meeting" that drew a full turnout of Vietnam Workers
 Party (VWP) Politburo members and the participation of a Soviet
 delegation headed by M.S. Solomentsev, candidate member of the
 CPSU Politburo.
 An an expression of Vietnamese gratitude for direct Soviet
 assistance in the construction of the monument and the preservation
 of Ho's remains, Solomentsev was accorded the honor of sharing the
 podium with VWP First Secretary Le Duan and DRV National. Assembly
 Standing Committee Chairman Trucng Chinh in eulogizing the late
 DRV President.  While the Chinese were not included in the
 ceremonies--their National Day delegation not having arrived in
 Hanoi until 31 August, comparison of DRV media coverage of the
 Soviet and PRC delegations' activities pertaining to National Day
 reveals a careful effort by the Vietnamese to maintain inpartial
 treatment of both.*
 The arrival and departure of both the Soviet and Chinese delegations
 were attended by Premier Pham Van Dong, and the cordiality of the
 occasions characterized in virtually identical language by Hanoi
 media.  Both delegations were received by Le Duan the day they
 arrived, and both visited DRV industrial establishments for which
 their respective governments had provided aid.  The remarks by the
 head of the PRC delegation, CCP Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien, at
 the Thai Nguyen iron and steel complex were summarized only very
 briefly by Vietnamese media, as were those by Solomentsev at the
 Cam Pha central mechanical engineering plant in Quang Ninh Province.
 H.3noi radio's 29 August list of DRV party and government officials
 described as members of the "presidium" for the mausoleum
 inaugural ceremonies included the leaders of the South Vietnam

 delegation Pham Hung, Iluynh Tan Phat, Vo Chi Cong, and Tran Nam
 Trung.  As usual, Pham Hung was identified as a member of the VWP
 Politburo and, as has been customary since his reappearance in
 public in mid-May,* he was listed separately from the other
 Politburo members.  A 1 September VNA English account of wreath-
 laying ceremonies at the "monument of fallen heroes" in Hanoi the
 same day also listed top-ranking members of the Politburo, but
 on that occasion Pham Bung was included in the listing of the
 other members and ranked fourth--after Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and
 Pham Van Dong and before Vo Nguyen Giap--the same hierarchical
 position he had occupied prior to his disappearance from media
 mention in September 1969.
 The Hanoi radio account of presidium members at the mausoleum
 ceremonies provided the first and only known identification of a
 Vietnamese leader in a position on the "National Council of
 National Reconciliation and Concord," a body originally called for
 by Article 12 of the January 1973 Paris agreement on Vietnam which
 has received markedly reduced attention from Vietnamese communist
 media since August 1974.  The Hanoi radio account placed Huynh Tan
 Phat and Vo Chi Cong in them.- customary titles, but added for
 Tran Nam Trung the identification "vice chairman of the National
 Council for National Reconciliation and Concord" along with his
 known titles as member of the VWP Central Committee, vice chairman
 of the NFLSV Central Committee Presidium, and PRG defense minister.
 Such an isolated identification would by itself seem insufficient
 evidence to confirm that the Vietnamese leadership has begun
 establishing such a council for reconciliation, which would
 lend an aura of Paris agreement legality to the takeover in the
 South.
 The Paris agreement had envisaged setting up such a council
 "immediately after the cease-fire" on the basis of consultations
 by the "two South Vietnamese parties" and it was to have consisted
 of "three equal segments."  While shortly after the signing of the
 Paris agreement Vietnamese communist media had hinted that unilateral
 moves might he taken to set up the National Council,** no formal
 announcement of its establishment is known to have ever been
 publicized and ever. mention of the concept of "national concord"
 became notably absent from official Vietnamese communist pronounce-
 ments, following the initial military successes of their forces in
 mid-March.

 Pham Hung's reappearance.

 in Hanoi and Front propaganda, see the TRENDS of 7 February 1973,

 PEKING, PHNOM PENH HAIL SIHANOUKIS RETURN HOME
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, accompanied by RGNU Prime Minister Penn
 Nouth and a major contingent of his Peking-based official entourage,
 ended over five years of exile abroad on 9 September, departing
 China for Cambodia in the company of RGNU Deputy Prime Minister
 Khieu Samphan and arriving in Phnom Penh later that same day.
 Prior to his Peking departure, Sihanouk was treated to a series
 of extraordinary Chinese leadership meetings, banquets and farewell
 ceremonies.   Initial, sparse Phnom Penh radio reportage on the
 prince's arrival indicated he received a warm welcome, but there
 has been no indication yet in communist media as to what role the
 prince, Penn Nouth, and the rest of the RGNU contingent formerly
 based in China will play in future Cambodian politics.   Phnom
 Penh's report on the arrival indicated that representatives of
 the army, Front, workers and mass organizations from throughout
 Cambodia were in the capital, suggesting that major leadership
 meetings may soon be held to iron out future Cambodian policies.*
 PEKING SENDOFF     Following his return to Peking on 4 September
 from DRV National Day celebrations in Hanoi,
 Sihanouk, along with Penn Nouth and Khieu Samphan, was treated to
 a round of effusive farewell. festivities.  The three leaders were
 received at a meeting on 6 September attended by eleven full and
 two alternate CCP Politburo members--almost every active member in
 Peking at the time.   Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping hosted and
 addressed a farewell banquet that evening, which was also addressed
 by Sihanouk and was attended by the same PRC leaders who had attended
 the meeting earlier in the day, except for aging NPC Chairman Chu Te.
 Sihanouk in turn hosted and addressed a banquet on 8 September which
 drew eight full CCP Politburo members, led by Teng Hsiao-ping, who
 also spoke.   Capping the farewells, the Chinese on the 9th staged
 a grand sendoff ceremony for the Cambodians, in an atmosphere of
 full "jubilation" marked by the rallying of "tens of thousands" of

 people at Tienanmen and the attendance of five Politburo members
 at the airport.*  Sihanouk, Penn Nouth, and Khieu Samphan had
 earlier visited Premier Chou En-lai in the hospital on 26 August
 and Mao Tse-tung on the 27th before attending anniversary
 celebrations in Hanoi.
 Teng Hsiao-ping's speeches at the 6 and 8 September banquets
 treated Sihanouk's departure as marking the end of over five years
 of struggle and the start of a "new historical stage" for the
 Cambodian people.  Bidding Sihanouk congratulations on his
 departure "on behalf of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Chairman Chu Te
 of the NPC Standing Committee, Premier Chou En-lai and the Chinese
 Government and people," Ting reiterated Chinese backing for Sihanouk
 as an '"oustanding patriot of Cambodia" and an old and "close
 friend" of the Chinese people.   At the same time Teng showed
 special respect to the insurgent leaders in Cambodia led by
 Khieu Samphan, and duly depicted the Cambodian "people"--not
 Sihanouk or the RGNU--as the motive force in Cambodian development.
 Employing much the same language he had used in feting a RGNU
 delegation Led by Khieu Samphan visiting China last month, Teng
 pledged that China would "as always stand together" with Cambodia
 and "firmly support" its just cause.
 Sihanouk's 6 September speech, though avoiding specific reference
 to the USSR, clearly appealed to his Chinese audience by differentiat-
 ing Cambodia's view of its "true friends" such as China, from that
 of its "false friends" who abandoned Cambodia au times of "misfortune."
 Referring to the strong Chinese support which greeted his arrival in
 Peking on March 19, 1970--following his departure from Moscow, where
 he first learned of the 18 March 1970 Lon Nol coup--the prince
 lauded the "unparalleled nobleness" of China's consistent support
 while condemning "formerly friendly powers" for predicting Front
 defeat at the hands of the United States.  Sihanouk made passing
 references to his current and future political role, noting on the
 6th that his "patriotic mission abroad" was now "fulfilled," but
 adding on the 8th that he was "sure" to "be asked often to visit or
 revisit" the PRC on "friendly missions."  Sihanouk on the 8th also
 reaffirmed his adherence to the egalitarian aims of consolidating
 "true people's democracy" in the "second stage of the Cambodian
 revolution," as originally outlined by the special national congress
 of the Front held in late April.
 *  By comparison, DPRK President Kim I1-song's 26 April 1975 Peking
 departure had occasioned the turnout of five Politburo members and
 "5,000 people."  DRV Party chief Le Duan`s 8 June 1973 Peking sendoff
 was marked by ten PRC Politburo members, but again only "5,000 people."
 Former Pakistani President Bhutto's 2 February 1972 Peking departure
 had occasioned a turnout of three Politburo members and "more than
 100,000 people" along the departure route.

 PHNOM PENH RECEPTION     Phnom Penh radio reported on 9 September
 that Sihanouk and Penn Nouth were greeted
 on arrival by Deputy Prince Minister Son Sen, Information and
 Propaganda Minister Hu Nim, other assembled RGNU ministers and
 deputy ministers, and representatives of "mass organizations"
 and "departments" in Phnom Penh and by "an extremely vast crowd
 of people" with "thunderous applause and cheers."  The radio
 reported that Son Sen made a speech "most warmly welcoming" the
 prince and Penn Nouth on their return, and that Sihanouk "expressed
 great emotion" over his welcome in an "elaborate return speech."
 The radio also reported on the 10th that Khieu Samphan hosted a
 banquet for Sihanouk and Penn Nouth on the 9th in an "extremely
 cordial and joyful atmosphere."  Khieu Samphan reportedly praised
 huh men "for all their patriotic activities over the past five
 years," and Sihanouk "stressed his joy at being able to return"
 to Phnom Penh in his reply.
 Thus far Phnom Penh has not broadcast these speeches in either
 excerpted or full form, and apart from the arrival and bai:quet
 reports it has remained silent on Sihanouk's return.  The radio
 reported briefly on both Teng Hsiao-ping's 6 September farewell
 banquet for Sihanouk and on Sihanouk's 8 September banquet in
 Peking, in broadcasts of the 9th and 10th respectively.

 PYONGYANG CALLS JAPANESE SHIP INCIDENT "UNHAPPY THING"
 KCNA on 10 September announced that: Pyongyang on 11 September would
 release the Japanese fishing vessel captured by a North Korean
 patrol boat on the 2d.  The KCNA announcement, while unattributed,
 employed language and format redolent of official statements and
 also provided Pyongyang's first detailed account of the incident.
 In revealing the imminent release of the ship and crew, KCNA said
 the DPRK was "taking into account the friendly relations between
 the Korean and Japanese peoples" and suggested that "such an
 .unhappy thing" between Korea and Japan could be avoided in the
 future if Japanese fishing vessels kept out of DPRK territorial
 waters.  According to KCNA, the North Korean patrol boat did not
 realize at first that the intruding vessel was Japanese.
 The announcement blamed the Japanese fishing vessel for bringing
 misfortune on itself, claiming that it had intruded into DPRK
 waters and then attempted to flee from a DPRK patrol boat, which
 gave "stop signals and menacing firing several times," before
 finally firing at and capturing the vessel, killing two crewmen.
 Explaining that "we had not imagined a Japanese ship would intrude
 so deep" into DPRK waters, the KCNA announcement claimed that the
 DPRK boat thought that since the "unidentified ship," attempted
 to flee, it was a "U.S. or South Korean puppet spy ship."
 The KCNA statement was the Pyongyang media's first acknowlegement
 that there had been shooting or casualties in the incident, details
 that were omitted from the only other Pyongyang account of the clash,
 a terse 2 September KCNA report.   That report had presaged Pyongyang's
 intended approach to resolving the incident when it suggested the
 ,entire affair was a case of mistaken identity, claiming that the
 !DPRK boat had sought to check an;"unidentified ship", which "turned
 out to be" Japanese.
 In a November 1973 incident when the DPRK seized another Japanese
 ship, the DPRK Ministry of Public Security had issued a report
 which did not suggest any problem of mistaken identity, but which
 hinted that the seized ship had been conducting espionage.  A
 month later, "taking the goodneighborly relations between the
 Japanese and Korea peoples into consideration," the DPRK had
 released that ship and crew.

 DPRK NATIONAL DAY MARKED BY PRESENCE OF KIM LL, RPR DELEGATE
 The DPRK marked the 27th anniversary of the nation's 8 September
 founding with the trad:Lt:Lona].L'yougyang meeting, banquet, and NODONG
 SINMUN editorial.  As usual, King 11-song did not attend the
 8 September Pyongyang meeting--a return to normal practice after
 his unusual appearance at last year's National Day meeting.   The
 meeting was addressed by Vice President Kim Tong-kyu.   Texts of
 the vice presidenL's speech and of the anniversary NODONG S1:NMUN editorial
 were not available at this writing.  The 9 September banquet
 hosted by Kini I1-song was addressed by Premier Kim 11, who had
 not appeared in public since early June and is probably in i11
 health.
 A representative of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification (RPR)--
 a Marxist-Leninist party allegedly operating in South Korea--attended
 both the 8 September meeting and the 9 September banquet.  This was
 the first time since the party was formed in 1970 that an RPR
 representative has been noted attending DPRK National Day functions,
 and marked the second time this year that Pyongyang media have
 reported an RPR representative attending a major function in the
 North.   (The first time was the 25 June Korean War anniversary
 rally in Pyongyang, which also was the first occasion since the
 party's founding that the RPR had been represented at the anniver-
 sary.)                           The last time a representative allegedly from South Korea
 was noted at DPRK National Day was in 1968, when Pyongyang radio
 had reported that a representative of the "South Korean revolutionary
 organization" gave a speech at the main Pyongyang meeting.
 The Soviet Union d:Ld not send a delegation to Pyongyang for this
 year's anniversary.   China was represented by a railway delegation
 headed by Minister of Railways Wan Li.   Soviet delegations had
 been sent for the anniversary in 1.973 and 1974, but not in 1971 or
 1972.   Chinese delegations have attended the DPRK anniversary since
 1971.   Last year Kim Il-song snubbed the Soviet delegation by not
 meeting with it, though lie did meet with the equivalent-level
 Chinese group.

 CHINA
 PEKING LEADERS APPEAR AS "WATER MARGIN" CAMPAIGN CONTINUES
 Coincident with the start of the current campaign to criticize the
 classical Chinese novel "'Water Margin," Chinese leaders have been
 unusually active, perhaps to signal that no broad leadership purges
 are underway.
 Thirteen Politburo members and alternates bid farewell to Cambodian
 Prince Sihanouk on 6 September.  Of the top Peking-based leaders,
 Minister of National Defense Yeh Chien-ying has failed to appear
 recently, though he was listed in a 29 August NCNA account as
 having sent a wreath to the funeral of a  Chinese official.  Yeh
 has a history of health problems, and prior to his last appearance--
 at which he presented the toast at the Peking Army Day reception
 on 31 July--he had been out of public view for nearly four weeks.
 While Yeh seems an unlikely -;andidate for purging, recent criticism
 of "Water Margin" hero Sung Chiang indicates that if a specific
 target is intended, it is probably a military figure.   Vice Chairman
 Wang Hung-wen, also a vice chairman of the party military commission,
 has not appeared since Army Day, but at that time he was in Shanghai
 and may well still be in the provinces.  Two alternate Politburo
 members have inexplicably dropped from public view in recent months.
 Neither Peking trade union leader Ni Chih-fu nor Sinkiang chief
 Saifudin have appeared publicly in the past three months.   Saifudin
 had previously shown up frequently in his province.
 Since the 4 September PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on "Water Margin,"
 there have been no new major central commentaries on the campaign,
 but the provinces have begun to comment on the novel and other
 articles from RED FLAG and other journals have become available.*
 An article by the mass criticism groups at Peking and Tsinghua
 Universities in the September RED FLAG detailed the differences
 between two main "Water Margin" characters: Chao Kai, founder of
 the peasant revolt and obvious Mao symbol, and Sung Chiang, a
 "capitulationist" apparently symbolizing a Lin Piao-Liu Shao-chi
 figure who, though a successful military strategist, works to
 erode the peasant revolution from within.   In a obvious slap at
 current goviet leaders who continue to verbally honor Lenin, and
 reflecting Mao's own concern about succession, the article revealed
 that Sung Chiang "covered Chao Kai's coffin with beautiful flowers"
 *  The PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial and other previously available
 articles are discussed in the TRENDS of 4 September, pages 26-29.

 be upheld by Chao Kai."  Sung Clriun?
 us,lc ?cij Howes' by accepting
 clemency from the emperor and abort Inf' the peasant revolt which
 he had led.   Character.i.r.ing "Water Marg:irr" as a Leaching material
 by "negative example," the al-tic-le warned that "this man Sung
 Chiang should not be trusted" because. he undermined the revolutionary
 cause "from the tns:ide."
 An article by a Peking iron and steel worker that appeared in
 KWANGMINC DAILY on 30 August criticized Sung Chiang in "Water Margin"
 for having made fun of Iluang Chao, an earlier peasant leader of
 an unsuccessful revolt.   The article noted tha. Huang was a true
 revolutionary who styled himself a "heaven-storming marshal" and
 was not afraid of the imperial anger and punishment, unlike Sung
 Chiang, who  curried imperial favor.   Huang Chao was one of
 several Chinese peasant heroes singled out for praise in a series
 of pamphlets issued by Peking last summer for the anti-Lin and
 Confucius campaign, and an article in the August  1975 CHIIIA
 PICTORIAL also praised HuL:ng.  The latter article noted that he
 "was fond of books," a reference that makes it highly unlikely
 that Huang's image of a marshal storming heaven is meant to
 symbolize Lin Piao's struggle against Mao.   One constant criticism
 of Lin during the anti-Lin campaign was that he never read books.
 The imperial figure in this campaign seems to represent reaction
 and revisionism, while. Mao is represented by true peasant leaders
 such as Chao Kai.
 Provincial radios generally waited until after release of the
 4 September PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, which contained new Mao
 instructions on the camp,i,11, before originating comment attacking
 the novel.  Subsequent provincial comment has focused on Sung Chiang's
 altering of Chao Kai's "peasant r.'olutionary line," with several
 broadcasts stressing the long-teen need to guard against "capitulation-
 ists"  like Liu Shao-chi and. 7Lb11 Piao, who were "just like Sung
 Chiang."  The long-range ideological objectives of the developing
 campaign were underscored in a 5 September Nanchang broadcast
 which urged widespread criticism of the novel in order to help
 the masses to "recognJ:.e- capit,.rlationists" and to "adhere to Chair-
 man Mao's revolutionary I:Jne both at present and in the future,
 in this century and the next."   A specific concern for insuring
 continuation of Peking's current line on the Soviet Union through
 any future post-Mao period has also been indicated in the provincial
 attacks on "Water Margin."  Charging that "the main theme of the
 book is to peddle cap.LuJaLionism," a Nanchang broadcast on
 7 September speci.j'.l:aJ.:ly denounced Lin Piao and Liu Shao-chi for
 seeking "a protective nuclear umbrella from Soviet revisionism
 and capitulating to Soviet-imperialism."

 10 SEPTEMBER 1975
 NOTES
 CUBA ON U.S., PUERTO RICO:  Speaking at a 5-8 September "inter-
 national conference of solidarity with the independence of Puerto
 Rico" in Havana, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos rejected the
 idea that Cuba's "unyielding duty of solidarity" with Puerto Rico
 might legitimately be considered "a significant impediment to
 U.S.-Cuban relations."  Dorticos stated that the Cuban Government
 "starts from the premise that Puerto Rico is a Latin American
 nation subjugated by colonial domination and is not a domestic
 problem of the United States," and he added that the "integrity
 of our revolutionary firmness unites us forever to the cause of
 Puerto Rico."  Dorticos echoed 28 August remarks in Lima by
 Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa to the effect that Puerto Rico's
 freedom was "swindled by the United States" and that "the cause
 of the independence of Puerto Rico is also our cause."  Puerto
 Rican independence has long been a standard Havana theme, used
 both as a demonstration of Cuban solidarity with fellow Latins
 and as an example of U.S. "aggression."  Thus, Roa's and Dorticos'
 statements are consistent with the regime's apparent determination
 to continue verbal support for "anti-imperialist" movements while
 cautiously encouraging improved relations with the United States.
 Havana has not as yet taken note of Secretary Kissinger's
 criticism ".n his 9 September news conference of Cuban sponsorship
 of the Puerto Rican conference as "an unfriendly act and a
 severe setback" to U.S.-Cuban relations.  Havana media have given
 customary treatment of the conference itself, reporting the many
 charges of U.7. "enslaving and inhumane" exploitation and condemna-
 tion o` the "farcical" referendum that established Puerto Rico's
 "associated free state" relationship with the United States.
 The media have not reported any statements during the conference
 by Prime Minister Fidel Castro, who presided over the closing
 session at which Dorticos spoke.  Although the conference was held
 under the nominal sponsorship of the Soviet-backed World Peace
 Council, Moscow generally does not emphasize the Puerto Ric.-In
 issue and gave only minimal attention to the conference.
 ABORTIVE COUP IN ECUADOR:  Moscow's as.;essment of the attempted
 overthrow of Ecuador's military government headed by General
 Rodriguez Lara on 1 September, has drawn a sharp distinction
 between that abortive "coup d'etat hatched by imperialist forces
 and home reaction"  in Ecuador and the 29 August ouster of
 President Velasco in neighboring Peru.  Thus, commentator Viktor
 Shragin asserted on Moscow radio's 5 September International.
 Situation program that the two coups were "different in character,"
 because while "Peru has changed its president but not its policy,"

 the Ecuadorean effort sought to reverse the nationalist trend in
 that country.  Shragin noted that General Gonzalez, leader of the
 attempt in Ecuador, had stated that he was supported by "all the
 bourgeois political parties."  And Shragin implied foreign support
 as well by noting that some time ago "Texaco and Gulf began a
 secret war" against the Rodriguez government, which had limited
 the activities of "foreign monopolies" since coming to power in 1972.
 Characteristically less subtle in placing the blame, a 3 September
 commentary on Moscow's purportedly unofficial Radio Peace and
 Progress said that "it can't be any clearer" that the oil company
 directors were "preparing developments in the same way as the ITT
 Company prepared for the fascist coup in Chile."  Although Havana
 has not commented on the coup, it has reported the events, with
 sources loyal to the Quito regime being cited to indicate Cuba's
 support.  A 2 September Havana international service dispatch,
 for example, noted that Ecuador's principal labor organization
 had "labeled the squashed military rebellion 'fascist"' and that
 the Communist Party of Ecuador had "expressed support for
 Rodriguez Lara's government."
