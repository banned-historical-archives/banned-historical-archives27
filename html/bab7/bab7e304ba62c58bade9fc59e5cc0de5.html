 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             July 217, 1966
 Therefore, the discharge certificate, ab initio
 is prohibited.
 The  Adjutant  General Issued  Colonel
 Stephens official identification which recog-
 nized him in an actively identified status and
 capacity and in full force and effect exist-
 ing fourteen months beyond the date of the
 erroneous discharge certificate.   Also, the
 same Second Army headquarters that issued
 the discharge certificate on April 28, 1960, as
 late as July following, continued to address
 Colonel Stephens, referring to and identify-
 ing him as an active member in the United
 States Army Ready Reserve.
 Regardless  of the  discharge certificate,
 Colonel Stephens has continued in an active
 status, and according to Army regulations,
 and the last orders he received, he has never
 elected relief from active duty, nor has he in
 active duty status.  During the interim, he
 has passed through the zone of promotional
 consideration without consideration, and has,
 as late as November 1963, refused to accept
 civilian employment with the United States
 Air For`ee at $9,475.00 per annum due to his
 disability  determination,  both  total  and
 permanent set out by the medical board on
 October 1, 1957, and due to the other cir-
 cumstances herein explained.
 At the present time, after more than 20
 years service, with total and permanent dis-
 ability rating made almost nine years past,
 he Is not in receipt of Army retirement bene-
 fits, any compensation award from the Vet-
 erans Administration, nor do his children
 have any war orphans benefits in event of his
 death due to heart disease which the Army
 has found to have existed prior to his service.
 Since 1942, Colonel Stephens has never
 been given a single adverse efficiency report
 by any commander to his knowledge. He has
 never been reprimanded or court martialed,
 or other wise had any discrepancy, with re-
 spect to his performance of duty, brought to
 his attention at any time.  If his record
 indicates otherwise, it is wholly untrue; if
 any commander has certified to such effect,
 and that any discrepancies were brought to
 which the Army has made.  Otherwise, the
 Committee will never be in position to have
 before it  other  vital  information which
 should, in the interest of justice, be con-
 sidered.                                                               The statements herein set out
 contain the truth and nothing but the truth.
 May I have a favorable response from you
 and your views in this connection?  All of
 which is respectfully submittedpor your kind
 PREPARE FOR DECEPTION
 (Mr. BURLESON asked and was give
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD, and to include cer-
 tain articles.)
 Mr. BURLESON.  Mr. Speaker, Col-
 umnist Roscoe Drummond cautions us
 that Hanoi may come up soon with tricky
 peace overtures, but he also points out
 that President Johnson has made it
 clear we will not be budged by false hope.
 As the fighting goes badly for the Viet-
 cong, Mr. Drummond says, Hanoi may
 figure that the circumstances Of a con-
 gressional election campaign in this
 country provide the. right time for de-
 ceptive peace proposals.
 It will not work.
 As Mr. Drummond notes, President
 Johnson has warned against it with this
 statement :
 We will not withdraw under the cloak of a
 meaningless agreement.
 With the assent of my colleagues, I will
 place Mr. Drummond's column as it ap-
 peared in the Washington Post in the
 RECORD:

 19661

 States, who has staked his life In mortal   (By Roscoe Drummond)
 conflict against an enemy in defense of his
 native land, and for the principles under
 which  it  is  also  governed,  not  knowing
 whether he will return to see his family or
 friends, is certainly entitled to a just, honest
 and fair hearing before his fellow man.
 My son would have been retired in 1954 due
 to physical disability had the proper actions
 been taken at that time. However, they were
 not, so, he should have been retired in 1957
 at the time of his myocardial infraction, for
 which he has been taking medical treatment
 and medication ever since at his own expense.
 Under  such  circumstances,  as  herein  ex-
 plained, and especially when he has spent
 the best part of his adult life in the defense
 of his country, no stone should be left un-
 turned in order to see that justice prevails,
 thereby allowing the chips to fall where they
 may.
 With fighting going badly for the Viet-
 cong, there is reason to brace ourselves for
 tricky and deceptive "peace proposals" from
 Hanoi.
 Obviously, we ought to be responsive to
 any initiative to end the war in a way that
 protects the independence of South Vietnam.
 But we ought to be on our guard against
 a trap.
 Those who know the ways of the Commu-
 nists believe the time is getting near when
 North Vietnam may engineer a diplomatic
 maneuver designed to sell Washington and
 Saigon a "peace package" with a false bottom.
 Here is why the United States must be
 alert:
 1-The logical time to put such a move in
 motion would be on the eve of the congres-
 sional elections.

 main purpose would be to tempt the United
 States into taking immedate steps that would
 disadvantage the United States and advan-
 take Hanoi's willingness to negotiate at all.
 What would the Communists like to ac-
 complish without making any final commit-
 ment to end the aggression?  Obviously, they
 want to try to immobilize the United States
 without any guarantee the Vietcong would
 remain immobile.
 The Communists could propose that the
 United States begin to withdraw its forces
 as a "gesture" that would help bring about
 negotiations a little later.
 The Communists could propose that the
 United States de-escalate the fighting while
 they try to catch their breath and get ready
 for another push.
 The Communists could propose that, as a
 preliminary to a future settlement, the VC
 be allowed a place In the Saigon regime be-

 It is possible, of course, that there Is so
 much controversy at the top in Hanoi on
 whether to keep up the war or accept nego-
 tiations that nobody will dare make a move.
 If it comes, it will probably be soon. Pres-
 ident Johnson has warned against it with
 his public affirmation that "we will not with-
 draw under the cloak of a meaningless agree-
 ment."
 TRI-CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE
 AND ADMINISTRATION INDIFFER-
 ENCE BLAMED FOR INCREASING
 UNREST  IN  LATIN  AMERICA-A
 CRITICAL   MOMENT  IN  INTER-
 AMERICAN AFFAIRS APPROACHES
 (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. CRAMER.  Mr. Speaker, on the
 13th anniversary of the Castro revolu-
 tion I call attention to administration's
 failure to meet the growing communist
 threat in this hemisphere.
 Yesterday was the anniversary of Cas-
 tro's July 26, 1953, attack on the Mon-
 cada Barracks in Cuba, recognized as
 the bearded dictator's first revolutionary
 act and the administration is still with-
 out a policy to deal with the Communist
 menace only 90 miles from our shores.
 The administration of not following
 the congressional mandate aimed at
 halting free-world shipping to Cuba
 painting out that in 1965, Canada and
 the United Kingdom alone exported over
 $90 million of goods to Cuba.
 As chairman of the Subcommittee on
 Subversion of the House Republican Task
 Force on Latin America, I say the ad-
 ministration is guilty of gross ineptness
 in meeting the crucial events in Latin
 America.   The  administration  has
 ignored last January's Tri-Continental
 Conference in Havana at which Commu-
 nist representatives from three contin-
 ents met and pronounced their goal to
 step up their aggression and subversion
 in this hemisphere.  The Tri-Continen-
 tal Conference is second in importance
 only to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.
 Specific targets in the Communist
 blueprint are Colombia, Venezuela, Peru,
 Panama, Guatemala, Ecuador and Puer-
 to Rico.  Additional resolutions were
 passed by the Conference on topics in-
 volving the Organization of American
 States, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
 Paraguay, and  British  and  French
 Guiana.

 plication of Army rules and regulations
 in separating him from the military
 service.   Judge  Stephens'  statement
 speaks for itself. In my judgment, the
 statement is altogether factual. I have
 known Henry Stephens for more than 30
 years, and have known his son for an
 equal period of time.
 I have introduced H.R. 15490 authoriz-
 ing relief for James D. Stephens from
 the circumstances outlined.
 I am greatly concerned about the lack
 of any appropriate administrative rem-
 edy for the circumstances of this case
 which leads me to the belief that the
 Congress should thoroughly study this
 matter with a possible view of enacting
 general legislation which will appropri-
 ately afford relief for other James Ste-
 phenses who may be similarly aggrieved
 by hypertechnical application of rules
 and regulations in such disability mat-
 ters.  I consequently urge each Member
 to give attention to,the case presented
 by Judge Stephens on behalf of his son:
 WHAT THE ARMY HAS DONE TO LT. COL. JAMES
 D. STEPHENS AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF
 SERVICE
 (A partial statement of facts to be used in
 connection with H.R. 15490, now pending
 before the Committee on the Judiciary)
 James Darwin Stephens was born in Pres-
 tonsburg, Kentucky on May 2, 1916. At elev-
 en yearsof age he began his military experi-
 ences by attending the oldest private military
 school of America in the hope that he would
 eventually be graduated from West Point
 thus making the Army his career.
 After his graduation from military school
 his appointment to the United States Military
 Academy did not materialize.  He was, how-
 ever, commissioned in the Organized Reserve
 Corps on September 8, 1937, by President
 Franklin D. Roosevelt.  He was active in the
 reserves until 1941 when he was ordered to
 active duty effective April 21st.
 Within six months after being ordered to
 duty he was sent overseas to Panama where
 he was on duty with the 5th United States
 Infantry at the time World War II began on
 December 7, 1941.  On completion of this
 overseas tour, he was returned to the United
 States where he received additional training
 in the fall and winter, 1943-44, and subse-
 quent thereto, he was sent overseas again,
 this time to serve in England, France and
 Germany.
 He was one of three young combat arms
 officers selected from several hundred to be-
 come administrative officer of a civil affairs
 group in American-British combined opera-
 tions of northwest Europe before and follow-
 ing invasion. He was the administrative offi-
 cer for the American Contingent, First Civil
 Affairs Group, under command of Colonel J.
 M. Hamilton, DSO, British Army, and carried
 on liaison activities with the SHAEF head-
 quarters in London.
 On fulfillment of this combined mission, in
 October 1944, he was assigned to the 95th In-
 fantry Division headquarters as assistant di-
 vision military government officer.  This was
 the combat phase of military government,
 and in this period he performed his duty in
 combat and under enemy fire with the 379th
 Infantry Regiment, and in its three battalion
 zones of combat in both France and Ger-
 many.  While his division was in combat its
 operations were under the jurisdiction of
 the Third Army Commander, General George
 S. Patton, Jr.  Until the Battle of the Bulge,
 this division saw some of the bitterest fight-
 ing in the European theater.  Certain par-
 ticipants in such combat, particularly those
 in the Moselle River, Metz, Saar River line
 and Searlautern objectives, were highly com-
 mended by the Third Army         Commander,
 General Patton.  Colonel Stephens was one
 of those persons.
 For his performance of duty under such
 combat conditions, in 1947, he was awarded
 the Bronze Star Medal.  In February. 1945,
 he was assigned to the 12th Armored Divi-
 sion, which was in the Seventh Army Area
 under command of General Alexander M.
 Patch.  While yet in the combat phase of
 military government operations,  with this
 division he served with headquarters Combat
 Command "A", performing his duties with
 this headquarters; the 66th Armored Infantry
 Battalion and the 493d Armored Artillery
 Battalion, in the Colmar Pocket, Crallsheim,
 Ellwangen, Dinkelsbuhl, Goppingen, Aalen,
 Dillingen, Laulngen, Landsberg, Murnau and
 other areas.
 Notwithstanding  the  above  performance
 and combat participation of record, the Army
 has certified to the Veterans Administration
 that Colonel Stephens had no combat. His
 service data  shows  otherwise; his  Bronze
 Star citation shows otherwise; and General
 Patton's commendation shows otherwise.
 When it had been determined by the De-
 partment of the Army in 1953 that Colonel
 Stephens would not continue on active duty
 beyond May 31, 1954, in April 1954, Colonel
 Stephens submitted his unqualified resigna-
 tion from commissioned status.  His Army
 commander recommended approval, and at
 that time, Colonel Stephens under the law
 had no further reserve service obligation.  He
 had served more than the required two years,
 during the criteria of both World War II
 and the Korean Conflict; he had almost thir-
 teen years extended active duty; seventeen
 years or more total' commissioned service;
 and more than 71 months overseas service
 in three separate theaters of war and na-
 tional emergency.
 Before his separation in 1954 from active
 duty   he  requested  a  physical  evaluation
 board  for   disability  determination   pur-
 poses; however, he was not properly referred,
 and therefore not ordered before one.     The
 Army's representative in making out Colonel
 Stephens' separation certificate, effective May.
 31, 1,954, determined that he was not to be
 assigned or transferred to any reserve com-
 ponent, branch or class, cognizant district or
 area command in any reserve capacity fol-
 lowing separation.  This certificate Colonel
 Stephens also signed indicating that he had
 no further desire to be connected with tha
 reserves.  Notwithstanding, without his re-
 quest or any indication that he wanted to be
 assigned to any reserve status, forty-two days
 following his separation, the Army assigned
 Colonel Stephens to the reserves anyway.  He
 was separated as a Lieutenant Colonel on his
 orders, but when he was assigned to the re-
 serves without request, he was assigned as
 a Major.
 At the time of his separation in 1954, his
 physical examination had no clinical evalu-
 ation which was required; however, the Army
 elected to change this record in order to
 show that one was done when, in fact, it was
 not done.  This physical examination shows
 that Colonel Stephens was in perfect health
 three days before his statement of medical
 history  was  due  in  compliance  with  his
 orders.
 In 1956, Colonel Stephens was ordered to
 duty at Fort Knox, Kentucky.   He performed
 this tour of duty but the Army denied him
 credit which, were it granted, it would au-
 thorize an additional retirement year, mak-
 ing his total service credit more than 20
 years.  He had proof in his own records, as
 well as did the Army, that this period of
 service was performed.  During this period
 of duty in 1956 a physical examination was
 made on him at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and
 on completion of it, the Chief of Medical
 Service postdated his review and approval by
 one year and three days, approving Colonel
 Stephens for active duty, effective June 29,
 1957, nine days following his orders for active
 duty dated June 20, 1957.

 On August 2, 1957, Colonel Stephens suf-
 fered an acute myocardial infarction while
 on duty at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland.
 This condition was found to be in line of
 duty, not due to any misconduct, while pres-
 ent for duty, and while not under the in-
 fluence of any drugs or intoxicants.  This
 finding was approved by the Secretary of
 the Army on September 17, 1957.
 On September 9, 1957, Fort Meade Army
 hospital published Special Orders 112, send-
 ing Colonel Stephens on attachment to the
 Walter Reed Army hospital for further ob-
 servation and treatment only, and on com-
 pletion thereof, he was to be returned to his
 organization and stationed at Fort Meade,
 Maryland by U.S. Government transporta-
 tion.  This order Colonel Stephens did not
 receive for a period of more than five years.
 A medical board was not authorized in this
 order by   any   commander   of   Colonel
 Stephens, nor was one appointed by his com-
 mander as required in Army regulations.
 Therefore, any board action taken by the
 Walter Reed Army hospital not in compli-
 ance with orders from Colonel Stephens'
 commander is illegal and of no effect.
 Notwithstanding, a medical board did meet
 at the Walter Reed Army hospital on Octo-
 ber 1, 1957, but it was contrary to his orders
 not yet known to or received by him.  Not
 one member of this board represented Colo-
 nel Stephens' rank and branch of service,
 nor was any member an officer of the com-
 bat arms.   The president of the medical
 board, on October 1, 1957, misrepresented
 himself to Colonel Stephens and the other
 members of the board, by making two dif-
 ferent medical determinations on the same
 day on the same individual.  The board
 found that Colonel Stephens' heart condi-
 tion existed prior to service and gave no ap-
 proximate  date  of  origin  as  required  by
 Army regulations.  It found that his heart
 disease was total and permanent.  The pres-
 ident of the medical board, as a member,
 .found that the heart disease existed prior
 to service, while simultaneously determin-
 ing that it did not.  Now both records exist
 in official files of the Department of the
 Army.  Any doctor with any reputation that
 would make a statement that a heart condi-
 tion existed  20 years before  it happened
 should have his head examined.  Any man
 with common horse sense would know bet-
 ter and he wouldn't have to be a doctor.
 When the findings of the medical board
 were approved by the hospital commander
 on  October  3,  1957,  finding that  Colonel
 Stephens'  heart  disease  existed  prior     to
 service, Stephens did not elect relief from
 active duty in writing to his commander as
 set out in Army regulations.  When he did
 not do so, it became mandatory that his
 case be referred to the jurisdiction of a phys-
 ical evaluation board.
 The      Army  now  asserts   that  Colonel
 Stephens has had a fair hearing when, in
 fact, one has not been held.  But if a hearing
 has been held, it has been done in secrecy
 without  notice  to him,      and without his
 knowledge    as  to  where,   when,       who  was
 present in his behalf, who was counsel of his
 choice, if any, and its findings.
 In 1959,  he was informed by an Army
 headquarters     that  a  physical evaluation
 board had set forth a disability determina-
 tion.                                                                                                                                    Colonel  Stephens  has  never    been
 notified what this degree of disability de-
 termination was, nor has he ever been given
 any knowledge with regard to its nature,
 recommendation or effect.
 On April 28, 1960, the Second Army head-
 quarters mailed to Colonel Stephens, without
 prior notice that such an action was to be
 taken, a discharge certificate which stated
 that his commission as a reserve had termi-
 nated due to physical disqualification.  This
 discharge certificate is erroneous, ill-founded
 and of no effect whatever, because, first of all,
 he has not been given credit for all his serv-
 ice which amounts to more than 20 years.

 PROTEST OF TREATMENT OF AMER-
 ICAN PRISONERS BY COMMUNIST
 NORTH VIETNAMESE
 (Mr. BROYHILL of Virginia asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr.  BROYHILL  of  Virginia.  Mr.
 Speaker, the time has come for the Con-
 gress of the United States, and particu-
 larly        the  House  of  Representatives,
 which is closest to our people, to take an
 official stand in protest over the treat-
 ment of American prisoners in the hands
 of the Communist North Vietnamese.
 The latest figures, Mr. Speaker, reveal
 that there are at least 63 Americans now
 in the hands of the Vietnam Communists
 who are being starved, threatened, and,
 verbally if not physically, beaten into
 brainwashed submission as victims of
 so-called war crimes accusations.
 Unless I wrongly read the signs of an-
 ger and distress on the part of the Amer-
 ican people, these 63 Americans may well
 be the most important soldiers we have
 ever sent to foreign wars.
 I say so, Mr. Speaker, because our peo-
 ple are tired, sick and tired of Commu-
 nist arrogance, Communist deceit, Com-
 munist torture and killing.
 They are tired of self-serving allies
 whose halfhearted support leads them
 to trading with the enemy and the pro-

 casualties.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             July 27, 1966
 In the days ahead, Mr. Speaker, the
 air will be filled with cries of alarm, with
 organized protests against America do-
 ing anything. And, if previous patterns
 of action prevail, with street protests
 against any decision we may make in
 justice and reason.
 But for the sake of our men in Hanoi
 prisons, for the safety of those still free
 to fight for us on the battlefield, I, for
 one, will endure the label of "hawk" and
 the slander of being called a "war-
 monger."
 I, for one, will ignore the cries of
 alarm; the marching protests, and the
 banners of surrender.
 I will do so, Mr. Speaker, because I
 believe it is my duty not only as a Con-
 gressman but as an American to do so-
 and, in addition, to do something about
 it.
 If we have to choose freedom for those
 we sent to fight, against the risk of a
 greater conflict, I shall choose freedom.
 If we have to choose between nations
 of courage as against those who pay only
 lipservice to freedom, I shall stand with
 the courageous, whatever the risk.
 If we must choose, as Americans, be-
 tween might as against sniveling threats,
 abject fear and weaseling foreign poli-
 cies, I will stand with what is right and
 the might that makes it so.
 So, I believe, will this Congress.  So
 will our people.

 VIETNAM: THE NEED FOR A
 POLITICAL INITIATIVE
 (Mr. COHELAN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. COHELAN.  Mr. Speaker, in its
 lead editorial yesterday the New York
 Times outlined a four-point plan to pro-
 mote a political settlement of the war in
 Vietnam which I warmly endorse.
 The plan calls for a stop to the Ameri-
 canization of the war by halting the
 buildup of U.S. troops.  As the Time
 comments :
 A quarter of a million American troops is
 more than enough.
 Second. The plan calls for a civilian
 government in Saigon "that can open
 contact with the insurgent forces." The
 fastest and most effective action that can
 be taken here is the holding of free coun-
 trywide elections.  This objective should
 be encouraged with every resource at
 our command.
 Third. The Times suggests a "tapering
 off" of the bombing of North Vietnam
 in order "to build an atmosphere con-
 ducive to negotiations."
 Fourth. It recommends coupling ef-
 forts to reconvene the Geneva Confer-
 ence with "broad diplomatic discussions"
 that can find a "formula for the neutrali-
 zation and economic development of
 southeast Asia as a whole."
 What is now required, as the Times
 makes perfectly clear "is a clear indica-
 tion that the American objective is not
 a military victory but political settle-
 ment. The American ability to escalate                                                                                    [Mr. OLSEN of Montana's remarks

 President Ho Chi Minh's statement that
 there is "no trial in view" for American mili-
 tary prisoners in North Vietnam is a victory
 for the moral influence of world opinion.
 That victory transcends the fate of the cap-
 tive airmen, for it offers hope that common
 sense and common humanity ultimately may
 prevail against the ever greater barbarism the
 war in Vietnam daily inflicts on both sides.
 The United States has yielded to the pres-
 sure of world opinion in the past by offering
 peace proposals and twice suspending the
 bombing of North Vietnam.  But this is the
 first time that Hanoi has shown regard for
 the opinion of mankind.  Its decision to back
 away from talk of "war crimes trials" fol-
 lows  direct  pleas  from                                                                               Secretary   General
 Thant, Pope Paul VI, numerous governments
 and opinion leaders everywhere, including
 eighteen  liberal  American  Senators.   The
 hope now must be that reason can prevail on
 the broader issues of the war itself.
 The  conflict  in   Vietnam  is  a political
 struggle that, in  the  end,   can  only  be
 resolved  by political  means.  In politics,
 timing is of the essence. A number of op-
 portunities to probe the prospects for peace
 have been neglected in the past.  It is vital
 that the new atmosphere and the new op-
 portunity opened by Hanoi's response on the
 prisoner issue not be missed as well.
 The  approach  favored  by        American
 moderates and long urged by The Times has
 just been summed up admirably by Prof.
 Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.  One essential ele-
 ment is to stop the Americanization of the
 war by halting the American buildup in
 South Vietnam; a quarter of a million Amer-
 ican  troops  is  more  than  enough.   The
 second vital element is a civilian Govern-
 ment in Saigon that can open contact with
 the insurgent forces. Third, is the need to
 build an atmosphere conductive to negotia-
 tions by tapering off the bombing of North
 Vietnam.  Finally, efforts to reconvene the
 Geneva conference must be linked with broad
 diplomatic discussions with Moscow, Paris,
 and other interested states to find a formula
 for the neutralization and economic develop-
 ment of Southeast Asia as a whole.
 Most of all, what is needed is a clear indica-
 tion that the American objective is not mili-
 tary victory but political settlement.  The
 American ability to escalate the war needs no
 further demonstration.  The need now is to
 halt the escalation and make a vigorous new
 effort to achieve peace.
 Treasury to purchase an additional $150
 million in FNMA preferred stock. Since
 FNMA is empowered to borrow up to 10
 times the amount of its capital and sur-
 plus, its borrowing power would increase
 by $1.5 billion after this additional Treas-
 ury investment.
 I am offering this measure to pump
 needed funds into the housing industry,
 which is experiencing a sharp decline.
 This bill is designed to quickly ease the
 credit squeeze in which the builders of
 this country find themselves.
 I have seen statistics provided by Mr.
 Joseph F. McCue, executive vice presi-
 dent of the Rochester, N.Y., Home Build-
 ers' Association, which show that new
 single-family housing permits in that
 area will be off by 24 percent this year
 because of the tight mortgage market.
 Housing starts throughout the country
 are expected to be down by about 200,-
 000 this year, at a time when other in-
 dustries are prospering.  Two months
 ago, housing starts fell to their lowest
 point in 31/2 years.
 The FNMA assists the homebuilding
 and mortgage industries during periods
 of tight money, while its sales of mort-
 gages during periods of relative mone-
 tary ease provide a ready source of in-
 vestment for long-term institutional in-
 vestors.  At present, however, FNMA is
 extended to the limit of its lending power
 since the authorization for Treasury pur-
 chases of its stock is fully subscribed.
 If we are to assist this industry during
 this crucial period, we should not do it
 at the expense of sound financial prac-
 tices.  Increasing the percentage lend-
 ing power of FNMA on present Treasury-
 held stock would free more mortgage
 funds at the expense of watering down
 the equity structure of FNMA operations.
 By authorizing increases in Treasury
 purchases, however, we can expand the
 lending power of the Association without
 impairing the soundness of its opera-
 tions.
 This bill is fashioned to fit the immedi-
 ate needs of the hard-hit homebuilding
 industry, and it can succeed without un-
 duly heating up current high-speed eco-

 Mr. RYAN.    Mr. Speaker, I want to

 Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., set forth in the

 In discussing alternatives to current
 policy he says.
 We must adapt the means we employ to
 the end we seek.
 Professor Schlesinger suggests:
 A program of limiting our forces, actions
 and objectives still holds out the possibility
 of an honorable resolution of a tragic situa-
 tion.         A program of  indefinite escalation
 offers nothing but disaster; for our adver-

 negotiation impossible and eventually assure
 the entry of China into the war.
 Mr. Speaker, I commend this thought-
 ful article to the attention of my col-
 leagues.

 VIETNAM?
 (By Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.)
 The moderate critics of the administra-
 tion's Vietnam policy do not question its
 proclaimed purposes:  resistance to Com-
 munist aggression, self-determination  for
 South Vietnam, a negotiated settlement in
 Southeast Asia,  They do question, with the
 greatest urgency, the theory that the way
 to achieve these objectives is to intensify
 the war.  The more we destroy Vietnam,
 North and South, in their judgment, the
 less chance there will ever be of attaining-
 14 our objectives.  The course of widening
 the war, moreover, will mire our nation in
 a hopeless and endless conflict on the main-
 land of Asia, beyond the effective use of our
 national power and the range of our pri-
 mary interests-and may well end in nu-
 clear war with China.
 And the  alternatives?   Instead of sup-
 posing that a guerrilla movement can be
 crushed by strategic bombing, instead of us-
 ing military methods to solve a political
 problem, we must adapt the means we em-
 ploy to the end we seek.
 1.  Stop the Americanization of the war.
 The bitter fact is that the war in Vietnam can
 nevf;r be won as a war of white men against
 Asians. It cannot be won "unless the peo-
 ple         [of South Vietnam]  support  the ef-
 fort         . We can help them, we can give
 them equipment, we can send our men out
 there as advisers, but they have to win it,
 the people of Vietnam" (President Kennedy,
 1963).  The more we Americanize the war-
 by increasing our military presence, by sum-
 moning Saigon leaders, like vassals, to con-
 ferences in an American state, by transform-
 ing a local war in Vietnam into a global test
 between America and China-the more we
 make the war unwinnable.
 2.  A civilian government in Saigon.       We
 have never had a government in Saigon that
 could enlist the active loyalty of the coun-
 tryside, and we certainly do not have one in
 Marshal .try's military  junta.   Instead  of
 identifying American interests with Marshal
 Ky, and rebuffing the broader political im-
 pulses of the South, we should long since
 have  encouraged  a  movement      toward  a
 civilian regime that represents the signifi-
 cant political forces of the country and is
 capable both of rallying the army and carry-
 ing out programs of social reform.  If such
 a government should favor the neutraliz-
 tion of South Vietnam, if it should want
 to negotiate with Vietcong, even if it should
 wish to release us from our commitment to
 stay in Vietnam, we cannot and we should not
 object.
 3. Reconvene the Geneva Conference.  We
 should persevere in the quest for negotia-
 tion..  Since the Vietcong are a principal
 party to the conflict, it would appear obvious
 that peace talks at Geneva are meaningless
 without their participation.  And since they
 will never talk if the only topic is their un-
 conditonal surrender, we must, unless we
 plan to exterminate them, hold out to them
 a prospect of a say in the future political
 life of South Vietnam-conditioned on their
 laying down their arms, opening up their
 territories and abiding by the ground rules
 of democratc elections, preferably under in-
 ternational supervision.
 4. Hold the line in South Vietnam.  Obvi-
 ously, Hanoi and the Vietcong will not ne-
 gotiate so long as they think they can win.
 Since stalemate is thus a precondition to
 negotiation, we must have enough American
 ground forces in South Vietnam to demon-
 strate that our adversaries cannot hope for
 military victory.  I believe that we have more
 than enough troops and installations there
 now to make this point.
 It is an illusion to suppose that by increas-
 ing the size of the American Army we can
 ever gain a reliable margin of superiority;
 for, by the Pentagon's preferred 10:1 ratio
 in fighting guerrillas, every time we add 100,-
 000 men, the enemy has only to add 10,000,
 and we are all even again.
 Nor does  "digging  in" mean a  static
 strategy with initiative relinquished to the
 enemy.  The South Vietnamese Army of half
 a million men is better suited in many ways
 than are Americans to search operations in
 the villages.
 We should also limit our bombing in the
 South.  Have we really no better way to deal
 with  guerrilla  warfare  than  the  aerial
 obliteration of the country in which it is
 taking place?  If this is our best idea of "pro-
 tecting" a country against communism, what
 other country, seeing the devastation we have
 wrought in Vietnam, will ever wish for Amer-
 ican protection?
 5. Taper off the bombing of North Vietnam.
 Secretary McNamara has candidly said, "We
 never believed that bombing would destroy
 North Vietnam's will," and thus far, bombing
 the North has neither brought Hanoi to the
 conference table, demoralized the people nor
 stopped infiltration.  As a result, pressure
 arises for ever-wider strikes-first oil depots,
 then harbors, factories, cities, the Chinese
 border.  But these won't work either.  As
 we move down this road, we will only solidify
 the people of North Vietnam behind their
 government,  make  negotiation impossible
 and eventually assure the entry of China
 into the war. And even if we bombed North
 Vietnam back to the Stone Age and earned
 thereby the hatred of the civilized world,
 16437
 this still would not settle the present war-
 which, after all, is taking place not in North
 but in South Vietnam.
 6. A long-run program for Southeast Asia.
 We should discuss with Russia, France, China
 and other interested countries a neutraliza-
 tion program, under international guarantee,
 for Cambodia, Laos, North and South Viet-
 nam.  If these states could work out forms
 of economic collaboration, as in the develop-
 ment of the Mekong Valley, the guarantors
 should make economic and technical assist-
 ance available to them.
 A program of limiting our forces, actions
 and objectives still holds out the possibility
 of an honorable resolution of a tragic situa-
 tion.                                                                                                                           A  program  of  indefinite  escalation
 offers nothing but disaster; for our adver-
 saries can, in their own way, match our every
 step up to nuclear war-and nuclear war
 would be just as much a moral and political
 catastrophe for us as it would be a physical
 catastrophe for the Far East and the whole
 world.

 Mr.   RHODES   of   Arizona.  Mr.
 Speaker, at the July 26, 1966, meeting of
 the House Republican Policy Committee
 a policy statement regarding the home-
 building                                                                                                                               industry   was  adopted.   As
 chairman of the policy committee, I
 would like to include at this point in the
 RECORD the complete text of this state-
 ment.
 REPUBLICAN POLICY  COMMITTEE STATEMENT
 ON THE HOMEBUILDING INDUSTRY
 Homebuilding and homebuying, one of the
 nation's largest industries, is faced with a
 major crisis.  Due to the inflationary fiscal
 policies of the Johnson-Humphrey Adminis-
 tration, this major industry could slump by
 as much as one-third during the second half
 of 1966;  It is tragically significant that the
 June building permit rate, an indicator of
 future activity, plummeted to the lowest
 point since the Census Bureau began keep-
 ing records.  Private housing starts in June
 were down 18 percent from June 1965' and
 applications for FHA-insured mortgages on
 existing homes were down 34 percent from
 a year ago.
 The homebuilding and homebuying crisis
 affects  millions  of  Americans-the  young
 couple who is getting married and wants to
 buy a home of their own, but cannot saddle
 themselves for 20 to 30 years with swollen
 payments; the family that wants to sell the
 house it now has or buy another but is pre-
 vented from doing so by the absence of home
 mortgage money; the builders and workers in
 the home construction industry, and all of
 the related industries and services that sup-
 ply materials and equipment.
 Under the Johnson-Humphrey Adminis-
 tration, interest rates are the highest in more
 than 40 years.  As a result, high interest
 costs have added tremendously to the cost
 of financing the ever-mounting Federal debt.
 The rising demand for credit by the Federal
 government and business has drawn funds

 away from credit-sensitive industries such as
 homebuilding.  And,  notwithstanding the
 fact that personal consumption has levelled
 off, plant and inventory expansion continue
 at a record pace as a hedge by industry
 against  the  continuing inflationary cost
 spiral.
 The only remedy offered by the Johnson-
 Humphrey Administration has been support
 for an ill-conceived effort to place a statutory
 interest ceiling rate over time deposits in
 banks and savings and loans.  We are op-
 posed to H.R. 14026.  This finger-in-the-dike
 approach will not create new savings nor di-
 rect additional funds to the homebuilding
 industry.  On the contrary, it could drive
 personal and corporate savings from banks
 and savings and loans to government bonds,
 Federal agency issues, or the stock market-
 thereby  further  compounding  the  home-
 building crisis.
 We Republicans do more than "sympa-
 thize" with the plight of the homebuilders
 and the homebuyers.  We demand that the
 following "crash" program be undertaken be-
 fore Congress adjourns:
 1. Slash nondefense, nonessential domes-
 tic spending.  Not just In regard to appro-
 priations as the President has urged, but
 also with respect to new program authoriza-
 tions which trigger the appropriations proc-
 ess.
 2. Reduce point discounts on FHA and VA
 home financing through administrative ad-
 justments of rates to more realistic levels.
 Five and six point discounts ($1,500 on $25,-
 000 home mortgage) are stifling home financ-
 'ing and wiping out personal savings.
 3. Suspend any further issues of FNMA
 participation sales other than for VA and
 FHA pooled housing mortgages.  When the
 participation sales bill was being debated,
 we warned that this multi-billion dollar
 budgetary gimmick would place severe strains
 on the private credit market and push up
 interest rates to record levels. Experience
 with the program, has fully confirmed our
 fears.
 4. Enact the Republican-initiated proposal
 to grant FNMA additional borrowing author-
 ity in a prudent and legal manner.
 b. Remove FNMA's $15,000 administrative
 limitation on purchase of mortgages under
 its secondary market operations.
 6. Appoint an emergency Presidential fact-
 finding committee on the homebuilding crisis
 to report its findings in sufficient time for
 Congressional consideration prior to adjourn-
 ment of the 89th Congress.
 Granted these are stern measures.  How-
 ever, the ever-deepening homebuilding crisis
 demands that immediate and effective steps
 be taken.  The "do not open until after
 election" tag must be removed from this
 problem.         -

 SETTLING THE AIRLINE STRIKE:
 TIME FOR CONGRESSIONAL AC-
 TION
 (Mr. CRAMER (at the request of Mr.
 REINECKE)  was granted permission to
 extend  his  remarks  at  this  point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. CRAMER.  Mr. Speaker, I am
 today introducing a resolution that is de-
 signed to provide an effective procedure
 for settling the present airline strike that
 -is crippling the Nation.  My resolution
 would call for an immediate cessation of
 this strike, and would provide for the im-
 mediate resumption of the airline serv-
 ices that are so desperately needed by all
 sections of the United States.  It would
 further provide for a special arbitration
 board which would settle this dispute in
 such a manner so as to preserve the
 rights, dignities, and equities of all the
 parties to the controversy.
 Mr. Speaker, I am a firm believer in
 the inherent value of the traditional
 form of free collective bargaining. How-
 ever, as in the railroad strikes in 1963,
 the public interest has been Ignored.  I
 am offering a resolution which will de-
 mand compulsory arbitration in this
 strike, having carefully weighed the
 equities of the situation, and given the
 problem considerable thought and be-
 lieving a national emergency exists.
 The airline strike has become an in-
 tolerable burden on the American econ-
 omy and on the American people. More
 than 150,000 travelers and 4,100 flights
 each day have ben affected by the walk-
 out. In addition, 231 cities in the United
 States have had their air service limited
 in some degree; and, 70 cities are com-
 pletely without commercial air service.
 The strike has seriously hampered the
 delivering of air mail, vital medical sup-
 plies, and consumer goods.
 Many States have felt the impact of
 the strike on their tourist industries.
 It has wrecked untold havoc in such sup-
 portive industries as the hotel and motel,
 restaurant, taxicab, and retail industries.
 Within these industries marginal busi-
 nessmen are faced with imminent bank-
 ruptcy as a result of the strike.
 In my State of Florida alone, 534 daily -
 flights that carry an estimated. 20,000
 passengers in and out of our 3 largest
 cities have been totally canceled.
 The airlines strike has been in progress
 for almost 3 weeks.  Yet, the prospects
 for an imminent settlement of the dis-
 pute are dim.  Each bargaining session
 has ended with the sides more firmly
 entrenched in their positions than before.
 We are faced with an emergency sit-
 uation of the first order.  Action must
 be taken to correct this situation, and
 it must be taken promptly. It is for this
 reason that I submit the following re-
 solution and strongly urge its immediate
 acceptance.
 WHY THE DELAY ON FISH PROTEIN
 CONCENTRATE?
 (Mr. KEITH (at the request of Mr.
 REI]VECKE)             was  granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. KEITH.                  Mr. Speaker, Monday
 afternoon at a high-level meeting, Food
 and Drug Administration officials told
 the Interior Department that its petition
 for approval of fish protein concentrate
 could not be granted until the FDA had
 further information.  I am told that
 FDA scientists believe that the fluoride
 content of the powdered fish extract may
 be too high.  As I understand it, the
 question is not one of toxicity, but rather
 of possible  "cosmetic" effects.  It is
 thought that if large amounts of FPC
 were consumed by someone over a period
 of years, his teeth might become mottled
 as a result.
 The possibility of mottling is not con-
 ceivable in this country, I am told, in
 view of the fact that FPC would only be
 a very modest percentage of anyone's
 diet.  Since FPC is a food additive, ap-
 propriate levels could be prescribed for
 adding to cornmeal or other foods so that
 there would be no problem even in other
 countries where fewer foods are avail-
 able.
 As I am speaking, children all over the
 world  are  dying from malnutrition.
 Each moment of delay denies some of
 them the chance to live.
 I have been advised by a number of
 experts that this question of fluoride con-
 tent is not a valid complaint.  Frankly,
 I cannot believe that the approval of
 FPC is being held up for this reason.
 The Bureau  of Commercial Fisheries
 scientists do not feel the fluoride content
 is significant. I have personally talked
 with a number of other eminent scien-
 tists, including Dr. Frederick Stare,
 world-renowed nutritionist, and head of
 Harvard Medical School's Department of
 Nutrition.  These men assure me that
 they have worked with FPC and consider
 it to be perfectly safe.  It has had re-
 markable beneficial  effects in Latin
 America where I saw firsthand how in-
 fants who had suffered from severe mal-
 nutrition were transformed into happy,
 healthy children by an FPC additive in-
 troduced into their diets.  The doctors
 seemed to be completely satisfied with
 the results.
 Last October, the National Academy
 of Sciences gave its stamp of approval to
 FPC, and since then, the Food and Drug
 Administration has had ample oppor-
 tunity to study the data presented to
 them by the Interior Department. What
 further proof is needed?  What are the
 real reasons for this delay? If they are
 valid ones, they should be made public.
 If they are not, then the situation is
 intolerable.
 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1966
 (Mrs. DWYER (at the request of Mr.
 REiNEcs a) was granted permission to ex-
 tend her remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mrs. DWYER.  Mr. Speaker, it is my
 understanding that at the appropriate
 point in the reading of the bill the dis-
 tinguished gentlewoman from Michigan
 [Mrs. GRIFFrTHS] will offer an amend-
 ment to strengthen the bill with regard
 to discrimination based on sex in the
 selection of juries.
 I shall associate myself with the
 gentlewoman in urging the House to sup-
 port the amendment for, without it, the
 bill will fail in a major respect to con-
 form to the principles of equity we all
 subscribe to and it will fail to guarantee
 the kind of representative juries on which
 the impartial administration of justice
 depends.

 The legislation would increase bank re-
 serve,requirements substantially.               It also
 would authorize the Federal Home Loan
 Bank Board to regulate interest paid by
 savings and loan associations.
 Mr, Speaker, this measure will not ac-
 complish its avowed purposes of stem-
 ming inflation, easing credit, lowering in-
 terest rates, and reviving the sagging
 homebuilding industry.
 Rather, inflation is likely to increase
 because the administration refuses to
 tackle the principal cause of inflationary
 pressures-Federal spending in excess-Qf
 revenue receipts.
 Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that the
 Congress will unanimously make it clear
 to the Communists in Hanoi that the
 staging of "show trials" will mean an
 intensification and escalation of the war
 and will be a serious setback to the
 achievement of a just and lasting peace
 in southeast Asia. The firmness of our
 convictions, as expressed in the resolu-
 tions which my colleagues and I have
 introduced, may deter the Hanoi regime
 from committing themselves to an irre-
 versible, inhuman step toward widening
 the war.

 Hiring Who reports results of its latest na-
 tional job survey and provides an unusually
 reliable index to the weight of employer de-
 mand for applicants in 1000 position cate-
 gories.
 The job-market study reveals that clerks,
 typists, bookkeepers, key-punch operators,
 and machinists fall well within the top 75
 categories of most wanted applicants but
 also indicates that demand for the top three
 classes-accountants, mechanical engineers,
 and computer programmers-is so broad as
 to indicate highly critical shortages of ade-
 quately trained applicants in these fields.
 However, Richard Lathrop, editor of Who's
 Hiring Who, states, "that well qualified ap-
 plicants in the top seventy-five categories
 should find that they have an extremely
 wide selection of opportunities available to
 them."
 Engineering graduates will continue to be
 big men on campus in the eyes of recruiters
 between now and next June, according to
 the survey's measure of demand for current
 college graduates.  This perpetuates a trend
 in evidence since Who's Hiring Who's, first
 publication-in 1959.   Next highest in de-
 mand among this year's graduates are chem-
 ists followed by mathematics, physics, busi-
 ness, statistics, and finance majors in that
 order.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             July 27, 1966
 Question.  What kind of equipment did
 -you take to Viet Nam?
 Answer. I had three Nikon F's with five
 lenses. A 28mm, 35mm, a 50mm, a 150mm
 and a 200 mm. All performed well. I didn't
 take a motor.  I carried 200 rolls of Tri-X,
 36 exposure film, 60 rolls of Ektachrome X
 and 40 rolls of highspeed Ektachrome.  All
 the color film was outdoor type. This proved
 to be plenty of film.  In fact, I had to ship
 some home when I left Saigon.
 Question. How did you work in the field?
 Answer. I wore a pack.  It's a lot easier
 than trying to handle a camera bag.  The
 first time I went out I carried three cameras
 with a lens on each.  But this proved awk-
 ward.  One camera was always slipping or
 hooking onto a vine.  After that I carried
 only two cameras-one with a 35mm and one
 with a 105mm.  A 200 was always in my
 pack. This combination is what most of the
 photogs carried in the field and proved very
 adequate.  Some of the people carried Tele-
 extenders, too.
 Question. How about food  and clothes
 when you're out in the field? Does the mili-
 tary give you that?
 Answer. No, they won't give you or allow
 you to buy army uniforms.  You have to buy
 .them on the black market or from a surplus
 store.  I didn't have any of this stuff when
 I got there so I had to scrounge.  Fatigues,
 -pack, cartridge belt, and canteens.
 Question. What is your estimate of the war
 itself? How does it look compared to Korea?
 Answer. Well, in Vietnam, when a unit
 gets into a fight, they don't send everybody
 charging in.  They call on firepower and
 artillery and air strikes and really blast 'em.
 When I was in Korea it was all trench war-
 fare.  We would send out probes and recon
 patrols.  There was a stalemate and we were
 trying to hold onto what we had without get-
 ting the other guys too mad at us.  In Viet-
 nam the war is entirely different. There is
 no front line,- You go through a village one
 day and it's like a Sunday afternoon walk.
 But a day or week or month later you can be
 in the fiercest fight in the world in the, same
 place.  The Viet Cong choose the fighting
 time and the fighting place.  They want to
 fight you on their own terms and in spots
 where they figure they have a good chance.
 Question. In this operation, then, you live
 as a civilian?
 Answer. Right.  The  military  will  take
 care of you as best they can while you're in
 the field.
 Question. When it's time to take pictures
 of the war, what do you do?
 Answer. The first day, the MACV (Mili-
 tary Assistance Command-Viet Nam) people
 advise you of the various ways of getting
 around the country.  The army runs passen-
 ger flights starting from Saigon each day to
 major concentration areas.  So, if you de-
 cide you want to go to An Khe, where the
 1st Cavalry is based, you call the Special
 Projects Officer the night before and he books
 you on this flight.  If you don't make prior
 arrangements, you just go out to the airport
 and walk up the flight line asking the pilots
 where they're headed.  Most times they're
 very accommodating.    The Marines try to
 keep an escort with you all the time, but
 then, each outfit does it differently.  With
 the 1st Cav., It's all up to you.  They advise
 you that something is happening here, or
 there, and you go with them if you choose.
 You ride with Medevacs, or re-supply heli-
 copters or walk in with the troops.
 Question: Aside from being a newspaper
 man, simply as a citizen who has got some
 indication, are you personally satisfied with
 the way the war is being fought?  Not just
 the individual unit or fighting man, but are
 you convinced that the U.S. Is in Viet Nam
 for a good reason?
 Answer. I sure am.  I'm satisfied that we
 should be there and fighting the way we are.
 We should continue to do it this way as
 long as we're welcome. As long as the gov-
 ernment of South Viet Nam wants us.

 (Mr. BOGGS (at the request of Mr.

 ter.)
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, one of the
 most noble and inspiring speeches I have
 ever read was made last Friday at the
 U.S. Naval Submarine Base, Groton,
 Conn., by our colleague, Congressman
 GEORGE GRIDER, of Memphis, Tenn. - The
 occasion of this wonderful address was
 the commissioning of the U.S. ship
 Flasher, a new and powerful nuclear sub-
 marine, equipped with Polaris missiles.
 This occasion-the commissioning of
 a new submarine Flasher-was particu-
 larly poignant for GEORGE GRIDER, for
 it was he who commanded the old. U.S.S.
 Flasher in World War II.  As com-
 mander of that submarine in the war,
 Captain GRIDER directed the sinking of
 more enemy tanker tonnage than has
 ever been sunk on any single patrol by
 any other submarine in history.  GEORGE
 GRIDER was truly one of our Nation's
 naval heroes in World War H, and I am
 proud to salute him once again for his
 courage and his distinguished service for
 our country, both in war and now in
 peace.
 What GEORGE GRIDER did for our coun-
 try in World War II in the highest tradi-
 tions of devoted public service, he is now
 doing for the people of Memphis in the
 House of Representatives.  Never more
 titled to preferential treatment either from
 his Maker or from his society because of
 such inconsequential and accidental consid-
 erations as color or place of birth.  For a
 long moment I no longer heard the depth
 charges  outside.
 This                                      remembrance,  coupled with
 GEORGE   GRIDER'S  actions today, reveal
 the strength of character in our fellow
 colleague, and I am pleased to share his
 friendship and enjoy his advice and
 counsel. I commend to my fellow col-
 leagues this splendid address which Con-
 gressman GRIDER delivered last Friday
 at Groton, Conn., on the occasion of the
 commissioning of the new U.S.S. Flasher
 as a member of our nuclear submarine
 fleet. His message is courageous, inspir-
 ing and noble. The speech follows:
 COMMISSIONING   OF   UNITED   STATES   SHIP

 U.S. NAVAL SUBMARINE BASE, GROTON, CON-
 NECTICUT
 (Address by GEORGE W. GRIDER, Member of
 Congress of Tennessee)
 This festive occasion brings to mind an-
 other commissioning ceremony of sorts held
 in Washington, D.C., in January of 1965.  A
 somewhat decrepit retread of a submarine
 sailor was  being launched in the United
 States Congress on those troubled waters

 above all wind.  As he opened up his office
 he put forth a gleaming and  untouched
 guest register. He opened the door for busi-
 ness, and hopefully sat back.  I think it sig-
 nificant that his first caller was Commander
 Kenneth M. Carr, prospective commanding
 officer of this ship.  It is an honor to return
 the call, Captain, and I hope you are as glad
 to see me as I was to see you.
 It was just up river from here that I stood
 on the deck of a noble ship in March 1.946
 and mournfully ordered the striking of the
 commission pennant.  On that day a shadow
 settled on the spirits of the small group of
 sailors who stood there.  The crew had been
 scattered during the decommission period.

 I have It soft here in Rome, Italy.  I work
 on a civilian airport, wear civilian clothes to.,
 work, and live on the economy rather than
 on a base. But, regardless of location or type
 of circun3stances, the Journal is very wel-

 that I miss.
 In view of what the Journal means to me
 here, it isn't hard to guess what it means to
 the guys in Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Ber-

 reading about old friends means a great deal
 to all of us.  I can assure you, and keeping
 up on new civic building projects, i.e., new'
 buildings, roads, etc. helps avoid that lost

 An editorial in the Scripps-Howard
 Washington Daily News relays this warn-
 Ing.
 The newspaper lists the warnings that
 have come previously from various offi-
 cials at home and the appeals of Pope
 Paul VI and Secretary General U Thant
 of the United Nations.
 Now the President has declared the
 American people would find such trials
 revolting and repulsive, and would react
 accordingly.
 The editorial makes no claim to under-
 stand just why Hanoi has made the ugly
 threat.  It expresses hope, however, that
 the President's warning sinks in and the
 threat is abandoned.
 Confident that this is a hope we all
 share, I propose to place the entire edi-

 NATIONAL ECONOMY SUFFERS
 DAILY
 (Mr., FLYNT (at the request of Mr.
 WALDIE) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. FLYNT. Mr. Speaker, it was with
 surprise bordering on shock when I read
 a few minutes ago that the. Secretary of
 Labor testified before the Senate Labor-
 Committee that the present airline strike
 does not amount to an emergency which
 requires legislative action by Congress.
 My good friend Secretary Wirtz knows
 better than this. He knows that the air-
 line Industry is partially paralyzed and
 that many other segments of the na-
 tional economy are suffering daily be-
 cause of the very serious effects of the
 present strike which has halted opera-
 tions of five major airlines.
 The cessation of operations of these
 five airlines is causing a loss of more
 than $7 million per day, and the daily
 rate of loss is increasing each day.
 There are 66,200 airline employees out
 of work; 4,100 regular scheduled flights
 have been canceled.  More than 150,000
 passengers per day are unable to obtain
 air transportation which they desire.
 These facts meet-my definition of an
 emergency.
 Some of the airlines which are operat-
 ing are receiving calls which originate
 at the White House demanding that a
 named person be placed on a confirmed
 reservation status-or else.  Many of
 these people have no urgent or emer-
 gency business.  The only basis for pri-
 ority handling of such requests for con-
 firmed reservations is that such requests
 originated at the White House.
 When told that the flight on which
 such a reservation is requested is already
 fully sold out, the response is, "Provide
 a reservation anyway."  When the air-
 line representative then asks, "Even if
 it means canceling a previously con-
 firmed reservation?" the answer comes
 back, "Yes, even if it means canceling a
 previously confirmed reservation."
 Members of Congress, executive de-
 partment  officials,  and  independent
 agency officials are also involved in ask-
 ing for special handling of requests for
 airline reservations. We in Congress
 cannot smugly wash our hands and say
 we know nothing about it-because we
 do.
 Mr. Speaker, in order that the effect
 of the airline strike might be made per-
 fectly clear to the Secretary of Labor and
 to other Government officials, I suggest
 the immediate consideration of a resolu-
 tion which I shall- introduce Thursday
 which would provide an embargo on
 commercial air transportation requested
 by members of the White House staff, by
 officials and employees of the U.S. Gov-
 ernment, including Representatives and
 Senators in Congress.  If this is done,
 Mr. Speaker, I think that the people who
 presently deny the existence of an emer-
 gency will recognize the true situation.
 Mr. Speaker, an emergency does exist
 in the air transportation industry, and
 it is time that something was done about
 it. I respectfully request that my resolu-
 tion be appropriately referred, and that
 it be considered by the House.

 der of the House, the gentleman from
 Delaware [Mr.  McDOWELL],  is recog-
 nized for 30 minutes.
 Mr. McDQWELL.   Mr. Speaker, the
 Christian Science Monitor commends
 President Johnson for re-emphasizing
 what it sets forth as the two indispensa-
 ble pillars of successful policy in south-
 east Asia.
 These are a determination that ag-
 gression will not be allowed to succeed
 and a readiness to keep the hand of re-
 conciliation, peace and negotiation ex-
 tended to North Vietnam and Commu-
 nist China.
 In his recent speech on policy in Asia,
 the newspaper remarks, the President
 extended the hand of reconciliation still
 further to Red China.
 This is another of many laudatory
 press observations on the President's
 statement of Asian policy, and I ask that
 it be inserted in the RECORD, together
 with President Johnson's speech of July
 12 to the American Alumni Council.
 [From the Christian Science Monitor,
 July 15, 1966]
 RIGHT POLICIES IN VIETNAM
 The two firm indispensable pillars of a
 successful    American  policy  in  Southeast
 Asia today are an unswerving determina-
 tion that aggression must not be allowed
 to succeed and a readiness to keep the hand
 of reconciliation, peace, and negotiation ex-
 tended to North Vietnam and Communist
 China.  President Johnson's White Sulphur
 Springs speech  wisely  reemphasized  these
 two foundation stones of American policy.
 Indeed, his speech did more.  In addition
 to  keeping the hand of reconciliation   in
 view, in the case of China he extended that
 hand still further.  Not only did he review
 the recent steps taken by Washington to re-
 open lines of communication with mainland
 China   (to none of which Peking has yet
 responded) but he also made it plain that he
 was ready to do more if China showed any
 receptivity.
 White House aides termed the speech the
 President's first major statement on China.
 It was in the right direction and established
 a policy which we hope will be adhered to.
 Someday, somehow America and China must
 again learn to live together in peace and co-
 operation.  There must never be any doubt
 about America's willingness to speed that
 day.
 Simultaneously, the President could, not
 have  done less than reiterate with utter
 firmness  anti  determination  the  United
 States' undeviating intention of proving that
 aggression, political and territorial imperial-
 ism, and terrorism will not be allowed to suc-
 ceed.                                                                                                                                      It is imperative that the Communist
 leadership be convinced that aggression will
 not pay off and that a military victory is be-
 yond their grasp.
 At the same time, however, the President
 wisely repeated earlier assurances that Wash-
 ington has no intention of overthrowing the
 North  Vietnamese  government,  attacking
 North Vietnamese independence, seizing an
 Inch of South Vietnamese territory or setting
 up permanent bases there.  If Hanoi does
 not believe these assurances, Washington
 must be ready to take any steps-consistent
 with its obligations to Saigon-to prove its
 clean-handedness in these matters.
 Meanwhile, Britain, India, and the United
 States all appear to be pressuring the Soviet
 Union to agree to seek to reconvene the Ge-
 neva Conference on Vietnam.  It is believed
 that, in its heart, Russia too would like to
 see such a step, but that it fears Hanoi's re-

 capability of the airport on a manageable
 basis of a total number of operations each
 hour spaced evenly through the hour. The
 Bureau of National Capital Airports has de-
 termined that the instrument flight capacity
 of the airport is approximately 60 operations
 per hour.  The historical use has been 73
 percent air carrier and 27 percent general
 aviation.  The application of these percent-
 ages would divide the available capacity be-
 tween the competing users of the airport
 by allocating 40 operations per hour to air
 carriers (other than air taxi operators) and
 allowance for extra sections.
 Air carrier flights serving passengers at
 Washington National Airport will continue to
 be limited to those whose last stop before
 landing at the airport and whose first stop
 after taking off at the airport are within 650
 statute miles from the airport (in place of
 the 500-mile limitation in the policy state-
 ment of July 1, 1966 (31 F.R. 9148)), except
 for non-stop flights of less than 1,000 miles
 operating to or from the fololwing:
 (1) Miami, Florida.
 (2) Memphis, Tennessee.
 (3) Minneapolis, Minnesota.
 (4) Orlando, Florida.
 (5) St. Louis, Missouri.
 (6) Tampa, Florida.
 (7) West Palm Beach, Fla.
 The types of airplanes used to perform
 such operations would be subject to the ap-
 proval of the Director, Bureau of National
 Capital Airports. The Director will be guided
 in granting approvals by considerations such
 as whether the airplane is a type that would
 increase congestion, whether it is appropriate
 to the airport's physical limitations, and
 whether it contributes to the use of the
 airport on a manageable basis, with due re-
 gard to the public need for service.
 The Agency hopes that the limitation of 40
 air carrier operations an hour can be ac-
 complished by agreement among the various
 air carriers,  Due to the urgency of the
 matter and the limited period of time avail-
 able, agreement by the carriers to schedule
 operations within the 40 operations an hour
 limitation will be accepted, provided such
 schedules would be effective by the date the
 regulation becomes effective.
 Should the above alternative not prove
 feasible, operational limitations would be im-
 posed by applying a formula that would re-
 suit in a proportional roll back, on an hourly
 basis, of current air carrier schedules 'during
 those hours of the day when there are more
 than 40 air carrier operations.  Under this
 latter alternative, any changes to schedules
 that would result in moving any operation
 from a crowded to a non-crowded hour would
 be subject to the approval of the Director,
 Bureau of National Capital Airports.

 in the making of the proposed rule by sub-

 CORRECTING AN INEQUITY SUF-

 PERSONNEL

 permission. to extend his remarks at this
 point' in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr.  F(JLTON  of  Tennessee.  Mr.
 Speaker, today it is my pleasure to in-
 troduce legislation designed to correct
 an inequity suffered by retired military
 personnel.
 Prior to 1958, with an exception dating
 back to 1949 regarding disabled retirees,
 retirement pay was based on current ac-
 tive duty pay.
 In 19,58 the Congress granted active
 duty pay increases but said that for the
 purpose of that act persons on the retired
 rolls would not receive an increase in
 benefits.
 In 1963 the Congress granted another
 military pay raise for personnel on active
 duty but at this time amended the law
 with a specific provision to put retired
 personnel on a cost-of-living benefit in-
 crease and take them off the former
 system whereby their retired benefits
 were computed on the basis of active
 duty pay.
 Since that time active duty military
 personnel have received increases aver-
 aging between 10 and 13 percent. How-
 ever, retired personnel have only a 4??4
 percent cost of living increase and a
 small percentage given in lieu of the
 raise they would have received in 1963 if
 computation had continued to remain
 on the active duty pay scale basis.
 Mr. Speaker, this is a great disservice
 to these retirees. They knew when they
 elected the military as a career that their
 active duty pay would be relatively low
 compared to civilian pay, but they also
 knew that they would receive a generally
 more liberal retirement.  The changes
 in the 1963 law have denied them this
 retirement and we have, in effect, broken
 faith with these persons whom had been
 promised that their retirement would
 compensate for their relatively low ac-
 tive duty pay.
 This bill will restore the retired pay
 system to its former status of equity and
 I urge early and favorable consideration
 by the Congress.
 SENDING FOREST HILLS JOURNAL
 TO MEN IN ARMED SERVICES
 (Mr. GILLIGAN (at the request of Mr.
 WALDIE) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. GILLIGAN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
 sert in the RECORD the following letter
 received in my office on June 15, 1966,
 from Mr. E. B. Wright, Jr., editor of the
 Forest Hills Journal, a weekly newspaper
 in Cincinnati, Ohio, serving Anderson
 Townsihp, Mount Washington, Newtown,
 and West Claremont areas:
 DEAR  CONGRESSMAN  GILLIGAN:  For  some
 time I have been meaning to bring to your
 attention something which you may wish to
 include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at your
 convenience.
 The Mt. Washington Junior Women's Club
 has decided to send each week a copy of the
 Forest Hills Journal to men in the service
 who live in the Mt. Washington-Anderson
 Township-Newtown  vicinity.  For  several
 months this has been going on and it has
 proved very popular with the servicemen.
 Enclosed are some tearsheets which provide
 the details.
 I thought you should know of this effort
 of the Women's Club because of your con-
 stant efforts to help the servicemen.  In a
 previous letter or two you have asked that
 I bring anything to your attention which I
 feel you should know about.  Well, this I
 feel you should.
 If  there  is  any other  information  you
 need, please feel free to contact me or Mrs.
 Mary Jo Wheatley, Chairman of the Club's
 Community Improvement Committee, who
 sponsored the idea.
 This project began in December of
 last year.  By February, 86 servicemen
 were receiving free subscriptions to the
 Journal, and by this date I am sure that
 many more names have been added.
 The women's club has received many
 letters from servicemen and their fam-
 ilies thanking the club for this fine ges-
 ture.                                                                                                                          I would like to quote a letter writ-
 ten by a lieutenant on the U.S.S. Kitty
 Hawk and which was addressed to Mrs.
 Wheatley:
 We have never met, but as a way of intro-
 duction I will say that I am one of the 86
 servicemen receiving the Forest Hills Jour-
 nal.  When I saw the article in the February
 9 Issue of the Journal, I felt it would be
 appropriate to express, my thanks.
 Until now I wasn't exactly certain why or
 how I was receiving the subscription.  Now
 that my questions are answered I can only
 say that it is much appreciated.  When I
 was in the States I never read a Journal but
 now I eagerly read each page to see what
 has been happening.  Though it takes ap-
 proximately two months for a copy to arrive,
 it is still welcome news of home.
 After six months away from the States
 and almost eight months away from Cin-
 cinnati, I am already eagerly anticipating
 my return home in June.  Having flown al-
 most 100 combat missions myself, I know
 all too well how hard men in the service
 are working over here; not only in the air
 but on the land  and the sea.  And this
 aids me all the more in appreciating, how
 much encouragement and enthusiasm from,
 the 'folks back home' seems to shorten our
 stay and make our job, though not very
 often a pleasant one, all the more worth-
 while.
 I hope that you will convey my thanks
 to all the members of the Mt. Washington
 Junior Women Club.
 Another serviceman-an airman in
 Rome writes:
 DEAR  MRS.  WIIEATLEY:  For the several
 months that I have been receiving the Forest
 Hills Journal, I've been racking my brain,
 and those of my parents in Mt. Washington,
 to discover who was responsible for the gen-
 erosity and thoughtfulness.                                                                                                                               It wasn't until
 yesterday that I received the February 9th

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             July 27, 1966
 --our rriends in India and Pakistan-800
 million strong-have ended a tragic conflict
 and have returned to the immense work of
 peace;
 -Japan )ias become a dramatic example
 of economic progress through political and
 social freedom and has begun to help others;
 -Communist China's policy of aggression
 by proxy is failing;
 -Nine Pacific nations-allies and neutrals,
 white and colored-came together on their
 own initiative to form an Asian and Pacific
 Council;
 -New and constructive groupings for eco-
 nomic cooperation are under discussion in
 Southeast Asia;
 -The  billion  dollar  Asian Development
 Bank which I first mentioned in Baltimore
 in my televised speech a few months ago is
 already moving forward in Manila with the
 participation of more than 31 nations;
 --and the  development  of  the  Lower
 Mekong River Basin is going forward despite
 the war.
 Throughout free Asia you can hear the
 echo of progress.  As one Malaysian leader
 said:  "Whatever our  ethical,  cultural, or
 religious background, the nations and peo-
 ples of Southeast Asia must pull together
 in the same broad sweep of history. We
 must create with our own hands and minds
 a new perspective and a new framework.
 And we must do it ourselves."
 For this is the new Asia, and this Is the
 new spirit we see taking shape behind our
 defense of South Vietnam. Because we have
 been firm-because we have committed our-
 selves to the defense of one small country-
 others have taken new heart.
 And I want to assure them tonight that
 we never intend to let you down.  America's
 word will always be good.
 There is a fourth essential for peace in
 Asia which may seem the most difficult of all:
 reconciliation between nations that now call
 themselves enemies.
 A peaceful mainland China Is central to a
 peaceful Asia.
 A hostile China must be discouraged from
 aggression.  A misguided China must be en-
 couraged toward understanding of the out-
 side world and toward policies of peaceful
 cooperation.
 For lasting peace can never come to Asia
 as long as the 700 million people of mainland
 China are Isolated by their rulers from the
 outside world.
 We have learned in our relations with other
 such states that the weakness of neighbors
 is a temptation, and only firmness, backed
 by power, can really deter power that is
 backed  by ambition.   But  we  have  also
 learned that the greatest force for opening
 closed minds and closed societies is the free
 flow of ideas and people and goods.
 For many years, now, the United States
 has attempted in vain to persuade the Chi-
 nese Communists to agree to an exchange of
 newsmen as one of the first steps to increased
 understanding between our people.
 More recently, we have taken steps to per-
 mit American scholars, experts in medicine
 and public health, and other specialists to
 travel to Communist China.  Only today we
 have here in the Government cleared a pass-
 port for a leading American businessman to
 exchange knowledge with Chinese mainland
 leaders in Red China.
 All of these initiatives have been rejected,
 except  the  action today,  by Communist
 China.
 We persist because we know that hunger
 and disease, ignorance and poverty, recognize
 no boundaries of either creed or class or
 country.
 We persist because we believe that even
 the most rigid societies will one day awaken
 to the rich possibilities of a diverse world.
 And we continue because we believe that
 cooperation, not hostility, is really the way
 of the future in the 20th Century.
 That day is not yet here.  It may be long
 in coming, but I tell you it is clearly on its
 way, because come it must.
 Earlier this year the Foreign Minister of
 Singapore said that If the nations of the
 world could learn to build a truly world civil-
 ization in the Pacific through cooperation
 and peaceful competition, then-as our great
 President Theodore Roosevelt once remarked
 -this may be the greatest of all human
 eras-the Pacific era.
 As a Pacific power, we must help achieve
 that outcome.
 Because it Is a goal worthy of our Ameri-
 can dreams and it is a goal that is worthy
 of the deeds of our brave men who are dying
 for us tonight.
 So I say to you and I pledge to all those
 who are counting on us: You can depend up-
 on us, because all Americans will do their
 part.

 ?There being no objection, the speech
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PANEL ON Low COST POWER FOR NEW ENGLAND
 (Remarks of Charles A. Robinson, Jr., staff
 engineer and staff counsel, National Rural
 Electric Cooperative Association, 1966 New
 England  Conference  of  Public  Utilities
 Commissioners, Stowe, Vt., June 27, 1966)
 It is indeed a privilege to be afforded this
 opportunity to exchange ideas and opinions
 with a group as thoroughly knowledgeable
 and experienced in electric power system
 planning, financing and operation as are the
 persons in attendance at this Conference.  I
 deeply appreciate your invitation to partici-
 pate in this panel.
 The Conference itself is, I believe, render-
 ing a very substantial public service by fur-
 nishing a, forum in which persons possessed
 of similar objectives, but perhaps with dif-
 fering views on how these objectives should
 be achieved, can meet with the common pur-
 pose of discussing ways and means by which
 an indispensable commodity such as elec-
 tricity can be made available to the gen-
 eral public at the lowest possible cost.  Cer-
 tainly, nothing but progress ought to result
 from a meeting such as this.
 It is my intention,  in accordance With
 Commissioner Gibson's request, to discuss
 the facts as I know them concerning the
 topic  assigned to me-the Dickey-Lincoln
 School project in Maine.  This is a project,
 I recognize, which has stirred as much bit-
 terness between various segments of the elec-
 tric power industry in New England and has
 given rise to as much political controversy
 as has any similar proposal in recent years.
 It is my hope that this controversy and the
 strained relationships which have stemmed
 from it, will ultimately be reconciled, and
 that all of the plans and proposals for re-
 ducing the cost of power throughout the
 northeast can proceed together in harmony.
 RURAL ELECTRIFICATION IN PERSPECTIVE
 The REA-financed portion of the electric
 utility industry,  with  which I have been
 associated for some 16 years, is small by any
 standard when compared with the magnitude
 of the investor-owned companies which serve
 80 percent of the nation's population.
 The total investment in REA-financed sys.
 tems throughout 'the United States is less
 than $5 billion compared to the more than
 $70 billion of assets owned by the investor-.
 owned companies.  Electric cooperatives op-
 erate only one percent of the nation's in-,
 stalled generating capacity and themselves
 generate only some twenty percent of the
 total energy input to  their  own systems..
 They serve some eight percent of the nation's
 electric consumers with five percent of the
 total electric energy sales for which they
 receive about six percent of total U.S. electric
 revenue.
 Even if legislation now pending in Con-
 gress,  which  would  provide  supplemental
 capital for REA-financed systems, were en-
 acted immediately, total investment in such
 systems might reach some $15 billion by 1980
 compared with an estimated industry total
 by that date of $170-200 billion.  And, If all
 regular  and  supplemental   financing,  pro-
 grammed for REA-financed generation and
 transmission  facilities  through  1980, were
 expended by that date, such facilities would
 then constitute about 3.5 percent of the total
 Industry.   (Statistics for electric coopera-
 tives in New England are shown in Table II.)

 I emphasize these statistics not because
 they are per as related to the Dickey-Lin-
 coln School project, but because the advocacy
 of such projects by the electric cooperatives
 is frequently misconstrued as an attempt to
 harm the investor-owned segment of the in-
 dustry.  In fact, the co-ops are so small a
 part of the industry as to be incapable of
 accomplishing many of the nefarious pur-
 poses  with  which  they  are  sometimes
 charged.
 COST  OF  WHOLESALE ENERGY
 Most of the energy distributed by the elec-
 tric cooperatives in New England is pur-
 chased at wholesale from other power sup-
 pliers.  A very small amount is generated in
 REA-financed plants.  All of it is extremely
 high in cost.  During the past twenty years,
 the cost of wholesale power purchased by
 rural electric cooperatives from investor-
 owned electric                 companies throughout the
 United States has fallen continuously and
 steadily from an average of 10.1 mills per kilo-
 watt i
 n 1945 to 7.5 mills per kilowatt hour
 in 1965.
 By contrast, as shown on the attached
 Chart I (not printed in the RECORD) the price
 of  wholesale  energy  purchased  by  REA-
 financed systems in New England has fluc-
 tuated between very wide limits during the
 same period of time, except for the state of
 Vermont which exhibits a steady decline be-
 tween 1950 and 1960 with slight increases
 thereafter.  The downward, trend In Vermont
 between 1958 and  1960 is accentuated by
 the availability of 8.5 mill power from the
 St. Lawrence-Niagara system.  In Maine the
 ;recent steep decline in the average Wholesale
 cost of power to REA-financed systems is di-
 rectly traceable to the importation from Can-
 ada of increasingly large blocks of power
 supplied  by  the   New  Brunswick  Electric
 1: ower Commission.  By contrast, however, as
 Indicated In  Table  I,  the  average   1965
 No. 121--18
 cost of power from some wholesale suppliers
 has actually increased over the cost of the
 same power from the same supplier in 1950.
 In other cases there is little or no difference
 between the average rate of such purchases
 in 19150 and in 1965.

 DICKEY-LINCOLN SCHOOL
 From this type of wholesale power supply
 situation there has arisen, as might be ex-
 pected, tremendous pressure on rural electric
 system management in New England to seek
 out and explore every possible avenue which
 might hold promise of lower wholesale rates.
 It should come as no surprise, therefore, that
 these systems have strongly supported eon-,
 struction  of  the  Federal  Dickey-Lincoln.
 School   hydro-electric   development.  our,
 support of the Dickey-Lincoln School proj-
 ect stems, not from the fact it is to be con-
 structed                                                                          by  the  Government,  but  rather
 from the fact that wholesale power from it
 can  he  delivered to  our cooperative load
 centers at rates reflecting major savings over
 presently available alternative sources.

 presently contemplated, would have an in-

 Dickey Reservoir an the St. John River in
 Maine, with an additional 34,000 kilowatts at
 the Lincoln School re-regulating impound-
 ment downstream.  The natural flow at the
 Dickey site, controlled by eight million acre
 feet of reservoir storage, would assure an-
 nual generation of. just over one billion kilo-
 watt hours from the combined project.  As
 planned,  the power and energy from the
 project could be marketed by a twin circuit
 345 k.v. transmission line system with ter-
 minals at Bangor and Portland, Maine and
 Boston,   Massachusetts.  Both  load factor
 energy and peaking capacity could be pro-
 duced.
 Total Federal Investment in the Dickey-

 CAPT. JAMES R. MITCHELL-
 ANOTHER UTAH HERO
 Mr. SENNETT.  Mr. President, the
 war in Vietnam has produced many
 heroes and fora brief moment, I would
 like to pay tribute to James R. "Dick"
 Mitchell of Ogden, Utah, who has joined
 that group of men who are proving once
 again that courage and daring are still
 very much American characteristics.
 Captain Mitchell was recently rescued
 from the North Vietnamese panhandle
 by a brave helicopter crew-another of
 those units to which American pilots owe
 a deep debt of gratitude-after his F-105
 had been shot down by North Vietnamese
 ground fire. As fate would have it, Cap-
 tain Mitchell was flying his 100th and
 last combat mission.  We in Utah are
 proud of this native son who is a graduate
 of Ogden High School and the University
 of Utah.
 Captain Mitchell is not new, however,
 to individual competition.  The son of
 Mrs. Louise Mitchell and the late Ralph
 Mitchell was a- member of the 1956
 Olympic ski team which competed in
 Italy. His flying skill and his courage re-
 flect the physical stamina and independ-
 ent thought which made him a top com-
 petitor in the Olympic Winter. Games.
 In behalf of the people of my State, I
 want Captain Mitchell and his family to
 know that we appreciate the sacrifice
 which he has made in defense of the free
 world. I am pleased that his rescue will
 make it possible for this Nation to bene-
 fit again from his fine skills and his great
 courage: That he is alive and well makes
 us very grateful and proud that we can
 claim him as a native son of our State.
 POLISH  MILLENNIUM  HONORED
 THE ISSUANCE OF A COMMEMO-
 RATIVE STAMP
 Mr. DOUGLAS.  Mr. President, 1,000
 years ago King Mieszko was baptized and
 the whole Polish kingdom he had united
 was  converted  to  Christianity.  Al-
 though the Catholic Church grew stead-
 ily in Poland throughout the centuries,
 there were often great times of trouble.
 In 1079 a great spiritual leader, Stanislav,
 was martyred while Bishop of Cracow.
 He is now the revered patron saint of
 Poland.
 The 20th century has been one of the
 m6st difficult for Christians in Poland.
 But the hardships they have endured and
 continue to endure have not diminished
 their abiding faith.
 We in the United States have tried in
 some small way to show the Polish people
 in our country and in their native land
 that we acknowledge the great signifi-
 cance of their millennium. On July 30 a
 commemorative stamp will be issued
 celebrating the 1,000th anniversary of
 Christianity in Poland in hopes ` that
 everyone in the country will join with
 their Polish brothers in observing this
 truly great day of the millennium.
 I am proud of the part I was able to
 play 1n'the issuance of the commemora-
 tive, stamp.  I ask unanimous consent
 that my letter concerning the millennium
 stamp and Postmaster General O'Brien's
 xesponse to it be included in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letters
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FEBRUARY 18, 1966.
 Hon. LAWRENCE F. O'BRIEN,
 Post Office Department,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR LARRY: I appreciate your assurance
 that the suggested Polish millennium stamp
 is under consideration as the last commem-
 oratives for 1966 are being selected.
 In writing now, I want to reaffirm my in-
 terest in this stamp and suggest how very
 meaningful it would be to the American
 people.
 Poland has long been a beleaguered land.
 But her creative, strong-willed people have
 endured partition, tyranny, war, and now
 the oppression of communism, maintaining
 their love of beauty, their spiritual strength,
 and intense pride in their Polish heritage.
 Our society has been nourished by the
 Polish people who have come to the United
 States and taught us to appreciate more than
 we might otherwise have learned of the re-
 markable culture now trapped behind the
 Iron Curtain.  A stamp to commemorate the
 Polish millennium will awaken even more
 interest in the  glory of Poland's ancient
 heritage.  I very much hope that it will be
 approved.
 With thanks for your consideration, and
 best wishes.
 Faithfully yours,
 PAUL  H.  DOUGLAS.

 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: It gives me great pleasure
 to advise you that I have approved a com-
 memorative stamp to mark 1,000 years of
 Polish culture.
 Because of your personal interest in this
 subject, I thought you would like to know
 about the stamp in advance of the public
 announcement.  The date and place of first-
 day sale have not been determined at this
 time.
 Your  endorsement  contributed  signifi-

 this important anniversary.

 SEDUCTION BY STATISTICS
 Mr. KUCHEL.                              Mr. President, in the
 July Issue of Nation's Business there is
 a most interesting and provocative arti-
 cle, entitled "Seduction by Statistics,"
 written by the distinguished Republican
 leader in the Senate, EVERETT MCKINLEY
 DIRxsEN. As Nation's Business describes
 it, the minority leader indicts those
 Washington wizards who employ hallu-
 cinatory estimates for masquerade and
 mirage in an extravaganza of political
 chicanery on the American public which
 is no less than seduction by statistics.
 I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
 ticle be included in the body of the
 RECORD.
 'There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SEDUCTION DY STATISTICS
 (By EVERETT M. DIRKSEN)
 The city of Washington is the world center
 for the manufacture of statistics.  Several
 thousand of the 2,542,590 employees on the
 16515
 United States government's $17 billion an-
 nual payroll spend their days feeding mag-
 netic tape into computers and drawing off
 columns of figures.  What kind of guidance
 do their statistics provide?   Who is really
 benefiting from them?
 Studies such as those dealing with the
 perspiration problem of Australian aborigines,
 or  with  the  rate  per  hundredweight  for
 trucking yak fat from Omaha to Chicago, are
 not at issue here.
 My concern is with statistics essential to
 the formulation of sound national policy.
 And I charge that some of them reflect not
 facts but a mirage.  Some are pure sleight
 of hand.  Still others are hallucinatory.  In-
 deed,                                                                                                                             figure         management  now      reinforces
 news management in Administration tactics.
 The combination, as I intend to show, can
 be doubly dangerous.
 The foremost example of sleight of hand
 statistics is, of course, the national budget.
 The President has raised it from just under
 $100 billion-a figure known to have been
 inaccurate when presented-to $112.7 billion,
 To you and me that looks like, and is, an in-
 crease of nearly $13 billion.  But the image-
 makers in the Administration noticed that
 the President, as all Presidents must do,
 had trimmed some of the more pendulous
 fat off the amounts of money requested by
 various agencies and departments.  So out
 came an inspired news release,  headlined
 "President Lops $10 Billion from Budget."
 Can a $13 billion budget increase really
 be a $10 billion cut?  It cannot.  It is an
 example of what George Orwell identified in
 his prophetic book, "1984," as "newspeak."
 It  is  like  describing the  world's  biggest
 spender as "frugal," or Russia as a "democ-
 racy."  Nobody really should be fooled by
 the federal budget.
 Much of the same sort of numerical flum-
 mery, as many citizens are discovering, goes
 for last year's  loudly trumpeted tax cut.
 What was benevolently extended by one
 hand of government as an income and ex-
 cise tax cut, with withdrawn by the other as
 a hike in social security taxes, a little later.
 The harsh fact is that today the tax collec-
 tor at all levels of government, local, state
 and national, takes 35 per cent of the na-
 tional income.
 WHERE THE HOCUS-POCUS STARTS
 Largest and most potent of government's
 hallucinatory statistics is the gross national
 product.   The GNP-most widely accepted
 indicator of the pace of America's economic
 growth-is used by the government also for
 divination and to produce euphoria in the
 face of inflationary spending. It is a gross
 national illusion.  One man toiling away in
 the  Department     of  Commerce,  "guessti-
 mates"                                                                                                                             the GNP by counting the dollars
 spent for certain goods and services, every
 time they go by.
 He may not wear a conical hat and a
 black  robe  decorated  with  cabalistic dia-
 grams, but mystic and intuitive elements do
 seethe and bubble in his pot.
 The  synthetic  figure  produced   is stu-
 pendous-$720 billion this year.  With in-
 flation now going at the rate of more than
 two per cent a year, the GNP rises auto-
 matically by $4 billion every quarter.  To
 make it leap upward still faster, a skeptic
 suggests that every man be ordered to pay
 his wife $40 a week as cook and house-
 keeper.  That would not produce any more
 wealth though it might set off some fire-
 works.                                                                                                                             But it would, as if by magic, push
 the GNP statistics on toward the $1 trillion
 figure.
 At that level, incidentaly, the GNP would
 about equal the real national debt, $947 bil-
 lion, which is three times as high as official
 statistics report it.  (The official debt figures
 omit about $600 billion--owed for services
 already rendered,  such as the $40 billion
 the government owes the civil service re-
 tirement fund.)                                                                                                                                         The GNP is not wealth,

 nor earnings nor anything else you can touch,

 every day someone says we can afford still
 Another vast expenditure because it would
 "require less than one per cent of the G11P."
 And all too often we do make the down pay-
 ment on still another tremendous program,
 with tremendous and unkown costs to fol-
 low.
 Ironically, last summer the U.S. Commerce
 Department itself renounced as erroneous
 the GNP figures it had produced since 1929.
 It recalculated the lot, and then came up
 with a higher figure for the annual increase
 in labor productivity.
 The increase was small, from 3.6 to 3.7 per
 cent, but it was sufficient to provide labor
 union economists a basis for demanding that
 another famous figure-the Administration's
 guidelines for wage increases-be adjusted
 upward.
 THE STATISTICAL SNOW JOB
 A bureaucratic technique now being skill-
 fully employed in Washington can be proper-
 ly termed the statistic avalanche.
 A distinguished practitioner of the ava-
 lanche is Sargent Shriver, a handsome and
 voluble man with energy enough to run
 (until recently) two high government jobs
 while dreaming of a third.  The avalanche
 device is triggered, for example, when Mr.
 Shriver is questioned at press conferences
 about instances of what he defends as high-
 spirited mayhem or arson in his scandal-
 ridden, politically manipulated Job Corps,
 which is part of the federal poverty program.
 On one occasion last fall, he called down
 a tumbling mass of statistics which rolled
 end over end, at express train speed, to en-
 gulf the reporters.  It included data rang-
 ing from the annual cost of keeping an in-
 mate in the Illinois penitentiary at Menard
 to the median Consumption of fish, classified
 as to. Weight and species, by seals in the
 Seattle zoo.
 When at last the rush subsided, the shaken
 questioner was sorry he had asked the little
 question that started it all, namely: "How
 much more does it cost to keep a boy in
 the Job Corps than in Harvard University?"
 The question had been buried  in the
 statistical snow-job.  There it will remain
 forever unless a shift in the political glacier
 opens a crevasse and exposes it to view.
 Plain deception meets the needs of some,
 Arthur Sylvester, assistant secretary of de-
 fense for public affairs, has made it clear that
 the Administration would not hesitate to
 deceive about defense affairs when it deemed
 deception necessary.  Some of the news out
 of Viet Nam persuades many of us that he
 was, in that statement at any rate, telling
 the truth.
 Those who class the war on poverty with
 Viet Nam in importance surely are engaging
 in deception.  So are the postal snoopers
 and the Internal Revenue wiretappers, whose
 work seems more suited to a collectivist than
 to a great society.
 A phantom statistic which even compels
 its compilers to smile is that showing "the
 rising productivity of government employ-
 ees."  There are, of course, many conscien-
 tious, hard-working government employees
 among the myriads, but they are all sup-
 ported by the work of someone else.  What
 could they produce, but statistics?
 HAULING OUT THE BOGEYMAN
 An old favorite is what might be called
 the Cheshire statistic.  It is pulled out of
 the air like a magician producing a bowl of
 goldfish,  Such a statistic was the basis for
 the charge during the 1960 Presidential cam-
 paign that "17 million Americans go to bed
 hungry every night."     Not four million or
 18.1 million, but 17 million exactly.  Unless
 many of them were reducing, that seemed to
 Indicate a deplorable breakdown in a public
 relief system which was even then the most
 gigantic ever conceived. But then President
 Johnson raised the figure two years ago to
 35 million.  it hung on the campaign air a
 while like its predecessor and then faded
 gently from view.
 So did the terrifying missile gap discovered
 by Democratic creators for use in the same
 campaign.    Both were meaningless as fact,
 but useful as bogies for whipping up, emo-
 tion.
 The  dictionary  defines  that  as  dem-
 agoguery.
 Cheshire or phantom statistics are common
 in foreign affairs, too.  Successive Presi-
 dents have extolled military aid as assuring
 the United States of staunch allies, ready
 to spring to our side in the fight for freedom
 with "250 strategic bases, five million ground
 forces,  10,000  aircraft  and  2,500  vessels."
 Well, thousands of American men are fight-
 ing for freedom today in the dark jungles of
 Viet Nam, but where are those eager allies?
 We know where some of them are.           More
 than 200 different ships of a dozen free world
 nations which have received $29 billion in
 American aid are busily hauling munitions to
 our communist foe, the Viet Cong.         Others
 which received even greater sums are run-
 ning supplies through our toothless "'quar-
 antine" to Communist Cuba, in defiance of
 all our pleas and entreaties.
 If we cannot expect gratitude for the $130
 billion we have poured out in postwar for-
 eign aid, might we not demand decency?
 The scale of our generosity, by the way, is
 shown by the fact that interest on the public
 debt, ballooned by this aid, now runs more
 than $1 billion a month, or about twice the
 current cost of our struggle in Viet Nam.
 THOSE STRETCHABLE YARDSTICKS
 Rubber statistical yardsticks to fit varied
 occasions also are common in government.
 For gauging unemployment, the long yard-
 stick is used.  Housewives, youngsters, peo-
 ple resting unconcernedly between jobs, are
 all counted as jobless to bring the unem-
 ployment total up to a level intended to
 cause public worry.   Although unemploy-
 ment is given as 2.9 million, a former director
 of the census recently estimated the number
 of male family heads out of work at only
 600,000.  Nobody really knows.  The official
 guess is extrapolated from a survey of only
 35,000 families,
 An effort to provide a count of job open-
 ings available was defeated last year in Con
 gress by labor union pressure, as tending to
 minimize the pathetic plight of the honestly
 apathetic.
 The myth of suffering millions searching
 in vain for work apparently must be pre-
 served, even though employers from one end
 of the country to the other complain of
 their inability to hire help.
 There's a saying now which goes: "'If you
 don't like the beat, change the thermometer."
 For  many  years,  the  Administration's
 economists, along with pundits and com-
 mentators, had bemoaned the existence of
 a "dollar gap" abroad.  But more recently,
 as everyone knows by now, the recipients of
 American bounty abroad have drawn down
 our gold reserves by billions.   They have
 been, able to buy gold because our gifts, loans,
 investments and purchases abroad have been
 running about $3 billion a year greater than
 their transactions with us.   So, suddenly
 with the mysterious unanimity of a cloud of
 gnats, they all changed direction.  The dol-
 lar gap had become a dollar glut.
 A cut in business investment and tourist
 purchases ordered by the Administration did
 not  help  enough.   (Nobody  knows  what
 tourist purchases  amount to.)      The glut
 continues to grow.   The Administration it-
 self keeps on spending and donating dollars
 abroad through a dozen spigots. The money
 goes out as foreign aid, as bounties to foreign
 governments for sugar and coffee, as research
 grants to foreign scientists, as expenditures
 to keep U.S. troops in Europe to defend pros-
 perous allies from whom we now are bor-
 rowing money, and in other ways.  Further
 damage to our dwindling gold stocks seemed
 certain.  What to do?
 NOW YOU SEE IT--
 The problem, as our leaders saw it, was
 how to make things look better without
 actually  turning  off  or  curtailing  their
 spigots. Last August somebody came up
 with an idea.      The government began com-
 puting the balance of payments in a new
 way.   Dollars held by private institutions
 abroad    were     dropped from  the liability
 column  on  the  government's     statistical
 tables, althought they had been included in
 the earlier system of accounting because they
 can become official claims against our gold
 the moment they are turned into a central
 bank.
 So,  where  the  old  fiscal  thermometer
 showed a deficit of more than $3 billion for
 1964, the new one cut it In half.  The fever
 has not been changed, just the thermometer.
 We have a new statistical mirage, and the
 band plays on.
 One of the most serious of all the govern-
 ment's statistical fantasies, however, reflects
 our balance of trade, which is a vital part of
 the total balance of international payments
 problem.  For 20 years, Commerce Depart-
 ment officials have been pleased to inform the
 President, the Congress and the people that
 the United States regularly sells more goods
 to foreign lands than they sell to us.  Our
 foreign trade was seen in wonderful health.
 With the assurance of great and rising
 prosperity in foreign trade, Congress has gone
 along with successive Administrations, Re-
 publican as well as Democratic, in acts of
 generosity to our outdistanced trading part-
 ners abroad.  We out tariffs, increased foreign
 aid and borrowed $130 billion to lend or give
 away overseas.
 At the same time we shipped-and are still
 shipping now-mountains of food and fiber
 as outright gifts or in exchange for non-
 spendable forints, dinars, zlotys, kips and
 rupees, all of which are reported by the De-
 partment   of   Commerce  as   commercial
 exports.   This, of course, swells the export
 balance, but we receive no dollars. Ameri-
 cans who questioned our financial capacity
 to do whatever we liked, without limit, or
 who doubted the wisdom of supporting dic-
 tators who were busy sharpening the swords
 of our enemies, were laughed to scorn.
 Not until the dollar stood  shaken and
 defoliated,  not until  our gold stock  had
 plummeted, did people begin to wonder if
 our balance of trade had really been as great
 as reported over the years. We began to ask
 if we had exposed ourselves to the gold drain
 by  a  statistical  mirage  in  foreign trade
 earnings.
 The answer, if you dig deep enough, is this.
 The United Kingdom and most other nations
 value imported goods on the "c.i.f." (cost,
 insurance, freight) basis.  That means they
 take the purchase price abroad, add shipping
 and insurance costs, and end end up with the
 total cost of the merchandise landed in their
 own country.  The difference between the
 seller's figures and the buyer's is just frefght
 and insurance. It is proper that those costs
 be added to the valuation of imports.
 But here's the catch: The United States
 does not add freight and insurance costs in
 computing the volume of imports.  We do
 not keep the same kind of books as our trad-
 ing partners.  We value our imports on the
 "f,o,b. " basis, foreign pert of shipment.  Our
 valuations are simply the cost of the goods
 abroad, with freight and insurance disre-
 garded.
 From that difference in accounting arises
 the mirage.  Our statistics are not compar-
 able with those of other nations.  We under-
 state the value of our purchases from Great
 Britain, for example, by an average of 22 per
 cent. And that, in computing trade balances,
 produces a violent distortion of fact.

 ECONOMY HITTING NEW PEAK
 Mr. McINTYRE.  Mr. President, the
 rate is not as fast, but the key indica-
 tors show that our economy is still
 climbing to new highs.
 Sam Dawson, the Associated Press
 business writer, points this out in the
 face of considerable talk about the econ-
 omy's turning down.
 It simply is not so.
 With few exceptions, Mr. Dawson re-
 minds us, key segments of the economy
 have not turned down or even leveled
 off, And there are special circumstances
 governing the exceptions, such as auto
 sales, housing starts, and new orders for
 durable goods.
 What is really happening, as Mr. Daw-
 son says, is that unlike the booming ex-
 pansion of,the first quarter of the year,
 the economy is now advancing at a more
 normal pace and responding in more
 healthy fashion to seasonal factors.
 With the approval of my colleagues, I
 will enter this column in the RECORD as
 It appeared in the Washington Evening
 Star.

 as follows:
 ,MOST KEY FIGURES INDICATE ECONOMY
 HITTING NEW PEAK
 (By Sam Dawson)
 NEW YORK.-Much of the talk these days
 is about the economy turning down.  But
 most of the key statistics show the economy
 is still climing to new highs.
 What is happening Is that while the econ-
 omy was booming ahead at a rapid rate in
 the first three months of this year, it is
 now advancing at a more normal pace and
 responding in a more healthy fashion to
 seasonal factors.  With few exceptions, the
 key segments in the economy haven't turned
 down or even leveled off.
 And the exceptions, such as auto sales,
 housing starts and new orders for durable
 igoods,  have  exceptional  circumstances  of
 their own.
 spending for that period grew by $3.3 billion
 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $458.9
 billion.  You can view this with alarm be-
 cause the gain was less than the $10.4 billion
 advance in the first quarter of the year, or
 you can hail the more normal rate of advance
 and the new high it set,
 Housing starts have had periodic sinking
 spells for two years now.  At the moment a
 new uncertainty-tight money In the mort-
 gage fund  field-is  complicating  the  pic-
 ture.                                                                             And tight money stems from the in-
 flationary boom of the first three months of
 1966-both because of       official  efforts to
 tighten credit and of still booming demand
 for loans in many fields.
 New factory orders for     durable goods-
 watched as a guide to future output-in
 June came to a seasonally adjusted $24.1
 billion.  This was  $100 million below the
 May and April totals.  But the June orders
 were $2.8 billion higher than a year ago.
 And a "large increase in bookings for de-
 fense products" is reported by the Commerce
 Department.  These seem more likely to con-
 tinue to gain than to drop.
 The backlog of durable goods orders ac-
 tually rose by $1.2 billion to a total of $70.7
 billion at the end of June, or $13.2 billion
 more than a year ago.  Factories apparently
 still have lots of orders to keep them busy.
 GNP ALSO RISING
 Worriers gout the economy like toy point to
 a slowdown in the advance of the Gross Na-
 tional Product.   Actually, this measure of
 the total output of goods and services Is still
 rising. In the 'second quarter it hit a new
 high, a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
 $732 billion.  The annual rate gain was $10.8
 billion above the previous record of $721.2
 billion set in the first three months of 1966.
 But it was the abnormal and unexpected
 $16.8 billion advance in the first quarter that
 sparked all the worry about the onset of in-
 flation and the Overheating of the economy,
 and sparked a campaign in some quarters
 for a rise In federal income tax rates.
 The economic pace may moderate a bit
 more this summer.   But even professional
 worriers aren't suggesting that the  Gross
 National Product actually will turn down
 overheating.
 VIETCONG ATROCITIES
 Mr. HARTKE.         Mr. President, a few
 days ago, some of us in this body joined
 in an open letter to the leaders of North
 Vietnam to caution them against a re-
 ported plan to place on trial our airmen
 now in their captivity. We pointed out
 that we were among those whose strong-
 est efforts remain dedicated to an early
 peace. We pointed out also that public
 humiliation of these pilots, followed by a

 have shelled our hospitals with mortars
 and have systematically killed wounded
 marines unable to defend themselves.
 Both these acts are clear violations of the
 Geneva Agreements.  Both are acts of
 barbarism  seldom  seen  in  civilized
 countries in many years.
 It is to these events that I wish now to
 address myself.
 We who urged a continuing ban on the
 bombing of North Vietnam some months
 ago and who have remained in the fore-
 front of seeking peace have done so as
 loyal Americans.  It remains our con-
 viction that violence breeds violence and
 escalation breeds escalation.
 We felt that bombing the north-even
 military   targets-perhaps   retarded
 peace, in that it might stiffen opposition.
 We urged new efforts at an honorable
 peace in the military struggle so that the
 war-wracked Vietnamese  might turn
 their energies better to the political and
 social struggle of elevating themselves.
 We were concerned with humanity,
 wanting to spare human life and elimi-
 nate suffering. We wish to avoid the ulti-
 mate escalation that could breed atomic
 warfare.
 The North Vietnamese, by inhuman
 acts of recent days, flout the efforts of all
 Americans to govern themselves by re-
 straint. They invite retaliation.
 Let it never be said that we who urge
 caution to one side fail to do so with
 equal vigor when the other side violates
 international convention.
 So long as our men are committed to
 battle in Vietnam, I, for one, intend to
 vote to give them everything they need.
 As one who himself served his country in
 wartime, I could not do less.
 Until such time as the differences can
 be settled at the conference table, we
 shall continue to press for peace and to
 speak out for humanity, temperance and
 justice-regardless of source.  We seek

 Jul y - 27, 1966            CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 What make the war so complicated is the
 existence of a Communist "shadow govern-
 'ment," permeating every aspect of Vietna-
 mese life.  A favorable outcome depends on
 the ability to create a political structure that
 can command the loyalties of the Vietnamese
 people.
 A. purely military solution Is impossible
 also because ,Vietnam directly engages the
 interests and the prestige of so many major
 powers.   Finally,  the  Administration  has
 stressed its unconditional readiness to re-
 spond to any overture by Hanoi for negotia-
 tions.
 In these circumstances, the political pro-
 gram-both within Vietnam and for nego-
 tiations-is crucial.   Military victories will
 prove empty if they are not coupled with an
 effort to build political structures.  Negotia-
 tions will be sterile or dangerous unless we
 enter  them with significant areas of       the
 country substantially free of terror.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
 1. Negotiations are likely when Hanoi real-
 izes that its political apparatus in the coun-
 tryside is being systematically reduced, and
 that this process will accelerate the longer
 the war lasts.  It follows that the primary
 goal of military operations should be the
 creation of secure areas. It is better to have
 100-percent control in 40 percent of the
 country than 40-percent control in 100 per-
 cent of the country.  This is not to say that
 we should adopt a static "enclave" theory,
 which would leave us with three Hong Kongs
 and two Berlins in the midst of hostile pop-
 ulations.  Nor does it mean that we must
 write off all the territory that we cannot
 securely control.   We will always retain a
 capacity for preventing the consolidation of
 Communist control even in areas that we
 do not control ourselves.  It does mean that
 the highest priority must be given to creat-
 ing "secure" zones that contain a maximum
 ,of population-zones that can be expanded
 if the war continues and that will give us
 reliable negotiating counters at a conference.
 2. We must understand that political in-
 stability in Vietnam reflects the transforma-
 tion of an essentially feudal structure Into
 a modern state-a process that took centuries
 in the West.  Such a process involves a pro-
 found shift of loyalties-a task that would-
 be searing in the best of circumstances, but
 is compounded by the pressures of civil'war.
 This imposes two requirements on us: (a)
 We must have compassion for the travail of
 a society that has been wracked by war for
 two dacades and not use its agony as an
 alibi for failing in our duty; and (b) we must
 give special emphasis to building political
 structures from the ground up.
 3. The notion drawn from our experience
 in Europe, that economic assistance auto-
 matioally produces political stability, does
 not apply in Vietnam. On the contrary, there
 is a danger that our enthusiasm and our
 concern with technical refinements will over-
 whelm slender administrative resources and
 compound  political  demorafization.   The
 test should be whether a program can enlist
 local support and thus give the rural popu-
 lation an                    incentive to defend It.  Bfforts
 should be concentrated in areas of maximum
 military security and spread out from there.
 4. It may prove impossible to settle the
 war at a large conference that deals with all
 issues simultaneously.  If the negotiations
 are conducted in a forum consisting of many
 nations that  are  already  rivals  (e.g., the
 U.S.S.R. and Communist China, or the U.S.
 and France), energies may be dissipated in
 political jockeying that is peripheral to the
 central problems in Vietnam.   It may be
 wiser to separate the issues into their com-
 ponent elements, each to be settled by the
 parties primarily involved.  A larger confer-
 eriee could then work out guarantees for set-
 tlements already achieved in other forums.
 5. The war in Vietnam is a crucial test of
 American maturity.  In the lives of -nations,
 as of individuals, there comes a point when
 future options are limited by past actions,
 The choices of 1966 are not those of 1961.
 We must recognize that to be on the defen-
 sive often forces us to be engaged in places
 chosen by opponents for their difficulty and
 ambiguity.
 We do not have the privilege of deciding to
 meet only those challenges that most flatter
 our moral preconceptions. If we cannot deal
 with political, economic and military prob-
 lems as an integrated whole, we will not be
 able to deal with them individually.
 (Hanson W. Baldwin: Military editor of the
 New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winner for
 journalism,  graduate  of  Annapolis,  war
 correspondent in the South Pacific, North
 Africa, Normandy, Korea, Vietnam)
 It's the eleventh hour in Vietnam.     The
 United States must decide to win or get out.
 It is not too late to win, but it soon may be.
 Victory means, first of all, a Governmental
 and national determination to win.
 Congress should declare a state of national
 emergency and authorize a limited mobiliza-
 tion.  Our trained and ready military power
 is spread thin all over the world.  Limited
 mobilization  would provide-more    quickly
 than any other means-a pool of at least
 partially trained manpower and organized
 logistical, training and combat units to sus-
 tain a rapid buildup in Vietnam and, ulti-
 mately, to strengthen our weakened posi-
 tions in other parts of the world.
 The President should be authorized to mo-
 bilize up to 500,000 reserves for two-year,
 service.  Draft calls should be increased as
 necessary.  All  enlistments  should  be  ex-
 tended for a minimum of six months.
 South  Vietnam,  North        Vietnam,  Laos,
 Cambodia and Thailand must be regarded
 as a  strategic  whole. 'The  war in South
 Vietnam is clearly nourished from outside.
 Soldiers, medicines, supplies, and especially
 arms and ammunition, today reach South
 Vietnam by sea, from Cambodia, through
 Laos, and from North Vietnam by any and
 all methods.  Most of the small arms now
 used by the Vietcong "main-force" units are
 standardized on the Soviet 7.62-mm caliber
 basis and are Chinese-manufactured.  All of
 the heavy arms-mortars, antiaircraft guns,
 SAM milliles, M1G's, IL-28 bombers, and the
 world's -largest  helicopter,  the  Mi-6-are
 either Chinese- or Russian-manufactured.
 We must shut off, to the best of our abil-
 ity, the stream of Communist supplies into
 North  Vietnam.   We  should turn  off the
 faucet, not merly put a stopper in the drain.
 This means blocking the seaborne arms traf-
 fic to North Vietnam-by mining, bombing,
 naval gunfire; the sinking of a dredge in the
 narrow, silted ship channel to Haiphong; by
 so-called "pacific blockade" or "quarantine"
 or other means.
 The land supply routes, even more im-
 portant to the Communist war effort, must
 also be interrupted.  Past limitations upon
 the bombing of railroads and roads, and of
 the choke points and communications bot-
 tlenecks in North Vietnam's extensive road
 network, must be removed.  We must reduce
 the  flow of supplies from North Vietnam
 through Laos and Cambodia.  Many of these
 supplies move partway by truck;  we have
 been bombing the trucks but, until recently,
 not the fuel-oil supplies that power them.
 We should bomb all the fuel-oil depots in
 North   Vietnam.  Electric power   plants,
 which provide power for a variety of war pur-
 poses, should also be bombed.
 Interdiction of the many branches of the
 Ho Chi Minh Trail (which leads over various
 passes from North Vietnam through Laos or
 Cambodia into South Vietnam) must be im-
 proved-by eliminating some of the restric-
 tions that now hamper bombing and par-
 ticularly by assigning more trained Forward
 Air Controllers, both on the ground and in
 the air.
 16523
 Air Cavalry raids by helicopter against
 Laotian  bottlenecks  on  the  supply route
 should   be   undertaken  whenever possible.
 The doctrine of "hot pursuit" must be ap-
 plied to any guerrilla forces that use Cam-
 bodia as a sanctuary.
 At sea, the Navy's coastal surveillance and
 river patrols must be extended and tight-
 ened-to stop Vietcong gunrunning by junks
 and sampans.  This will require more air and
 small-craft  bases  in  South  Vietnam  and
 and Thailand.
 U.S.  troop   strength  in  South  Vietnam
 should be doubled to a figure of 500,000 to
 700,000 men, to enable U.S. and South Viet-
 namese forces to patrol areas that have been
 Communist sanctuaries for years.   We must
 find and fix the main force of the enemy,
 and force him to expend his supplies in ac-
 tion, if possible.  An enemy "body count" is
 not the proper yardstick by which to judge
 success in this kind of war.  Even if the
 enemy refuses action and fades away into the
 jungles, or into the shadows of the U Minh
 Forest, the capture and destruction of his
 base camps, of his rice and food supplies, of
 his medicines and weapons and ammunition
 will reduce his combat capabilities.  The war
 must ultimately be won on the ground by
 destroying  or  breaking up  the  mainforce
 units of the Vietcong, and especially by de-
 stroying the enemy's bases of operations.
 The final part of the strategy for victory-
 the part that will shape the peace-is the
 pacification  program.  TI-fe American  and
 South  Vietnamese  military  can     launch
 search-and-destroy and search-and-clear op-
 erations;  but only specially trained South
 Vietnamese administrative and paramilitary
 forces can hold the areas that are cleared.
 The pacification program-in the past mis-
 handled and underemphasized-has this year
 started slowly but well; it must be pushed
 to the maximum.  For one can confirm vic-
 tory in a guerrilla war only if one wins the
 people over and protects them against the
 enemy.
 This is a slow, a comprehensive, a tedious
 process.  The administrative, police, educa-
 tional and health authority of the central
 government must be built up from what
 Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge calls "the
 precinct level."
 The enemy cannot win in a military sense;
 he is stymied on the field of battle.' But
 political instability in Saigon, and U.S. im-
 patience at home, may cause us to lose the
 struggle-politically and psychologically.
 We have no easy choices-only grim alter-
 natives.  Victory, which means making it
 possible for a South Vietnamese government
 to govern without interference from outside,
 is posisble; but it may not be possible soon.
 The victory road will be long and hard and
 bloody. But defeat or stalemate in Vietnam
 will gravely impair the U.S. position in Asia
 and in the world; and if we lose, our children
 and grandchildren will face tomorrow a far
 worse problem than we face today.

 I have been asked by Look to describe my
 personal position, rather than give an analysis
 of the pros and cons.  The first and over-
 whelming point is that whether or not one
 agrees with the steps that led to it,  our
 present commitment to oppose force and
 terror by the National Liberation Front in
 South Vietnam is as solemn an engagement
 as any modern nation has made.  I do not
 believe that commitments must be blindly
 kept, regardless of costs; but just as we should
 be careful about making commitments, we
 should be very careful about honoring them.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE            July 27, 1966
 Maintaining 'the credibility of our commit-
 :ments Is not just a matter of "saving face."
 Our ability to support world peace and
 security, particularly without using exces-
 sive force, depends in great measure upon
 the faith that other nations repose in Ameri-
 can commitments.  (Germany, Japan, India
 and Israel, for example, restrain their activi-
 ',ties in obtaining nuclear weapons partly be-
 cause of American commitments.)
 To renege on commitments as serious as
 those we have made in Southeast Asia could
 be a major step in a disastrous erosion of
 faith in the United States.  If faith in our
 commitments became: so weak that we would
 have to give excessive commitments in order
 to make them believable-for example, giving
 minor states control over our policy (as the
 British had to do with Poland in 1939)-
 then the likelihood of major escalation, such
 as a war with China, would be dangerously
 increased.
 The United States also has a crucial inter-
 est In dispelling two illusions that have
 grown up since World War II: that radical
 terrorists almost always win; and that radi-
 dal regimes can subvert, or intervene in, a
 neighboring area with little risk.  History is
 replete with examples of how a victory by
 terrorists in one area powerfully influenced
 the likelihood and the tactics of subversion
 in other areas.  The invalidity of oversim-
 plified "domino theories" should not lead us
 to underestimate the worldwide costs of let-
 ting the Vietcong succeed with their resort
 to violence. In addition, I am seriously con-
 oerned about the political and moral reper-y
 cusaions within the United States were we
 to "pull out" of Vietnam.
 Our cause in South Vietnam is not im-
 moral.  Many think we, are creating more
 destruction, more.death,  ore human sufler-
 1ng than our cause justifies.  But what would
 happen were we to let South Vietnam fall
 into the hands of the National Liberation
 Front? It Is not likely that a victorious NLF
 would treat with restraint: the Cao Dal, the
 Hoo Hao, the Catholics (each a community
 of about  1,000,000  human  beings) ;  the
 500,000 South Vietnamese soldiers; the many
 other groups that have demonstrated they
 are anti-Communist; the tens of thousands
 who would probably be labeled enemies of a
 Communist state.  Those who dismiss this

 treated their opponents, and might ask them-
 selves it the victorious NLF is likely to be
 more restrained.  Nor should the West view
 with equanimity 15,000,000 people passing
 behind a Communist Iron Curtain.
 What, then, should we do In Vietnam now?
 1. An important aspect of the battle for
 "the hearts and minds of men" is this: Which
 side will succeed in symbolizing national
 identity? Many Vietnamese prefer good gov-
 ernment to bad government, but even more
 prefer  self-government to foreign control.
 We should encourage self-government, and
 should minimize our nonmilitary role.
 2. Thus, we should accept and encourage
 more independence by the South Vietnamese
 in  handling  their political  and  economic
 problems.  Even if a Buddhist nationalist
 comes to power, he is likely to be more op-
 posed to the NLF than to the Americans;
 and if his government does not want our pro-
 tection, or makes it impossible, we can then
 leave with honor-having fully honored our
 solemn commitment.   (I assume we would
 not have connived at his election or policy.)
 3. To the extent that it can be encouraged
 to, the Saigon government should compete
 with the Vietcong in promises of social re-
 form, should launch selective but significant
 social-reform  programs  now,  and  should
 cary out pacification programs in a legal and
 humane way.
 4. We should replace the present system of
 four levels of American advisers In the Viet-
 namese Army (which tends to result in four
 levels of double veto) with a singular, more
 unified system.
 5.'We should urge the South Vietnamese
 Army to. make promotions and assignments
 on the basis of merit.  The efficiency of the
 fighting forces would be' greatly increased if
 the army adopted the simple expedient of
 promotions on the battlefield, raising enlisted
 inert to officer rank, regardless of edfacation-
 rewarding proven ability, aggressiveness and
 dedication.
 6. The amnesty program offered to the
 Vietcong should be broadened and liberal-
 ized. The counterinsurgency wars that have
 been won since World War II o;ten.4nvolved
 generous, well-publicized amnesty programs.
 (The Philippine Government, for instance,
 promised and gave farms to many Huk guer-
 rillas who surendered.)  Although the South
 Vietnamese think it wrong to treat rebels bet-
 ter than loyal peasants, it is clearly worth
 a good dehl to South Vietnam to make sur-
 render safe and attractive, and to guarantee
 a decent, useful life to the man who sur-
 renders.
 7. We probably do not need to escalate
 military activities against North Vietnam.
 The military tactics we have Introduced-
 aggressive patrolling to carry out search-and-
 destroy and clear-and-hold operations-con-
 tain ma}iy significant benefits that have not
 yet been fully realized, but should soon show
 important results.
 8, I believe we can pacify Vietnam.   A
 stable, reasonable government there is pos-
 sible.  Although the political situation looks
 bad today, many current political problems
 are likely to be solved following, and as the
 result of, military victories.   The political
 difficulties in South Vietnam are likely to be
 diminished  when  and  after     elections  are
 held-especially if the elections follow mili-
 tary victories.
 Our present policy is the only realistic al-
 ternative the United States really has.  It is
 a hopeful policy. If we are patient, resolute,
 realistic, that policy can probably realize our
 goals.  I have yet to hear of an alternative
 that is not likely to involve costs fax greater,
 far more deplorable, far more inhumane in
 both the short and long run.

 son; author of "A Thousand Days," etc.)
 The moderate  critics   of the administra-
 tion's Vietnam policy do not  question  its
 proclaimed purposes: resistance to Commu-
 nist aggression, self-determination for South
 Vietnam, a negotiated settlement In South-
 east Asia.  They do question, with the great-
 est urgency, the theory that the way to
 achieve these objectives Is to intensify the
 war.  The more we destroy Vietnam, North
 and South, in their judgment, the less chance
 there will ever be of attaining our objectives.
 The course of widening the war, moreover,
 will mire our nation in a hopeless and end-
 less conflict on the mainland of Asia, beyond
 the effective use of our national power and
 the range of our primary interests--and may
 well end in nuclear war with China.
 And the alternatives?  Instead of suppos-
 ing that a guerrilla movement can, be crushed
 by strategic bombing, Instead of using mili-
 tary methods to solve a political problem, we
 must adapt the means we employ to the end
 we seek.
 1. Stop the Americanization of the war.
 The bitter fact is that the war in Vietnam
 can never be won as a war of white men
 against Asians.  It cannot be won "unless
 the people [of South Vietnam] support the
 effort , . . .   We can help them, we can give
 them equipment, we can send our men out
 there as advisers, but they have to win it, the
 people  of       Vietnam"  (President Kennedy,
 1963).  The more we Americanize the war-
 by increasing our military presence, by sum-
 moning Saigon leaders, like vassals, to, con-
 ferencesin an American state, by transform-
 ing a local war in Vietnam into a global test
 between America and China-the more we
 make the war unwinnable.
 2. A civilian government in Saigon.  We
 have never had a government in Saigon that
 could enlist the active loyalty of the country-
 side, and we certainly do not have one in
 Marshal  Ky's  military  junta.  Instead of
 identifying American interests with Marshal
 Ky, and rebuffing the broader political im-
 pulses of the South, we should long since
 have encouraged a movement toward a civil-
 ian regime that represents the significant
 political forces of the country and is capable
 both of rallying the army and carrying out
 programs of social reform.  If such a govern-
 ment  should  favor  the                                                                                                                                           neutralization  of
 South Vietnam, if it should want to negotiate
 with Vietcong, even if it should wish to re-
 lease us from our commitment to stay in
 Vietnam, we cannot and should not object.
 3. Reconvene the Geneva Conference.         We
 should persevere in the quest for negotiation.
 Since the Vietcong are a principal party to
 the conflict, it would appear obvious that
 peace talks at Geneva are meaningless with-
 out their participation.  And since they will
 never talk if the only topic is their uncon-
 ditional surrender, we must, unless we plan
 to exterminate them, hold out to them a
 prospect of a say in the future political life
 of South Vietnam-conditioned on their lay-
 ing down their arms, opening up their terri-
 tories and abiding by the ground rules of
 democratic elections, preferably under inter-
 national supervision.
 4. Hold the line in South Vietnam.  Obvi-
 ously,  Hanoi  and  the  Vietcong  will                                                                                                                                        not
 negotiate so long as they think they can win.
 Since stalemate is thus a precondition to
 negotiation, we must have enough American
 ground forces in South Vietnam to demon-
 strate that our adversaries cannot hope for
 military victory.  I believe that we have more
 than enough troops and installations there
 now to make this point.
 It is an illusion to suppose that by in-
 creasing the size of the American Army we
 can ever gain a reliable margin of superiority;
 for, by the Pentagon's preferred 10:1 ratio
 in fighting guerrillas, every time we add
 100,000 men, the enemy has only to add
 10,000, and we are all even again.
 Nor does "digging in" mean a static strat-
 egy  with  initiative  relinquished  to  the
 enemy.  The South Vietnamese Army of half
 a million men Is better suited in many ways
 than are Americans to search operations in
 the villages.
 We should also limit our bombing in the
 South. Have we really no better way to deal
 with guerrilla warfare than the aerial oblit-
 eration of the country In which it is taking
 place? If this is our best idea of "protecting"
 a country against communism, what other
 country, seeing the devastation we have
 wrought  in  Vietnam,  will  ever  wish  for
 American protection?
 5. Taper off the bombing of North Viet-
 nam.   Secretary  McNamara                                                                                                                                           has  candidly
 said, "We never believed that bombing would
 destroy North Vietnam's will," and thus far,
 bombing  the  North  has  neither  brought
 Hanoi to the conference table, demoralized
 the people nor stopped Infiltration.  As a
 result, pressure arises for ever-wider strikes--
 first oil depots, then harbors, factories, cities,
 the Chinese border.  But these won't work
 either.  As we move down this road, we will
 only solidify the people of North Vietnam
 behind their government, make negotiations
 Impossible and eventually assure the entry

 bombed North Vietnam back to the Stone
 Age and earned thereby the hatred of the

 A final observation.  The question is often
 asked whether United States aid helps the
 growth of democratic attitudes and institu-
 tions in less-developed countries.  In the pre-
 sent state of our knowledge, we cannot be
 sure of the answer.  My own personal view is
 that aid is substantially helpful to this end,
 for several reasons.
 The first is exposure.  There is no doubt
 that most of the thousands of persons who
 come to this country under our aid programs,
 and most of those who come In contact with
 our technical assistance people abroad, are
 impressed by the freedom and mobility of our
 society and the benefits of government by
 consent.
 Furthermore, under the aid program we
 deliberately foster many democratic institu-
 tions-savings and loan associations, for ex-
 ample, democratic trade unions, cooperatives

 Mr. METCALF. -Mr. President, two
 prominent Eastern newspapers cheer the
 Senate for passing without dissent legis-
 lation designed to clean our rivers and
 streams.
 Each asks the House to follow suit.
 Much still remains to be done to rid
 the Nation's waters of pollution, but the
 New York Times and Washington Post
 endorse the bill to generate Federal,
 State, and local spending of some $200
 billion over the next 6 years.
 Both newspapers declare the pollution
 of our water resources has reached
 alarming proportions. But as the junior
 Senator from Maine-the bill's chief
 sponsor-has contended, the people have
 given Congress a mandate to act.
 In recognition of this mandate, I offer
 these newspaper editorials for the REc-
 ORD.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Post, July 15,
 1966]
 MANDATE FOR CLEAN WATER
 The 90-to-0 vote by which the Senate
 passed the clean-rivers bill is indicative of
 a tidal wave of reaction against filth in our
 streams.         A few years ago it was difficult to
 arouse any interest in pollution or its abate-
 ment on a national scale.  Now there is
 mounting alarm, and, according to Senator
 MTSKIE, the chief sponsor of the Senate bill,
 the people have given a mandate to Congress
 to end the shocking abuse of our water
 resources.
 In any event, the Senate has responded
 with a commendable sense of urgency.  It
 voted ,to authorize the spending of $6 billion
 for pollution control over the next six"years.
 The program is designed to stimulate a total
 outlay of $20 billion, with the states and
 municipalities contributing the larger share.
 It remains to be seen whether the local gov-
 ernments will take full advantage of this
 opportunity to reclaim their corrupted riv-
 ers.  But the Federal incentive will certainly
 be much stronger than ever before.
 To date the states have been shockingly
 negligent in this field.  With many of their
 rivers stinking from sewage and many har-
 bors befouled by oil and other wastes, 42
 states have done nothing at all, leaving the
 whole burden on their municipalities.  As a
 result numerous towns and cities are pour-
 Ing raw sewage Into the same stream.                             Even
 where municipalities have made some effort
 metropolitan areas in meeting their pollu-
 tion-control problems.   Funds would  also_
 become available for the training of person-
 nel in pollution control, for additional re-
 search in the disposal of radioactive wastes,
 the pollution of estuaries and so forth. It is
 an immense undertaking.
 Let no one suppose, however, that the pol-
 lution problem Is about to be solved or that
 no further efforts are necessary.  Senator
 MUSKIE candidly told his colleagues that two
 major problems are left untouched by his
 bill; the disposal of industrial waste and the
 separation of storm and sanitary sewers.
 Under the best of circumstances, moreover,
 the billions voted by the Senate would pro-
 vide only primary and secondary sewage
 treatment for 80 percent of the population.
 Someone has estimated that it will cost $100
 billion to wipe out the country's befoulment
 of its water resources, and then it Is doubt-
 ful whether the job would be complete.
 The Senate bill will also need scrutiny as
 to the  clean-water  standards  it  provides.
 Yet,, with all its deficienSies, it is a remark-
 able step forward.                                                                                      The House should be at
 least equally forthright and positive in its
 response to the mounting mandate fOr clean
 water.
 [From the New York Times, July 15, 19661
 THE SENATE ACTS ON POLLUTION
 The Senate has given a powerful thrust to
 the fight for cleaner air and water i];L America.
 Without a dissenting vote, it has passed and
 sent to the House a $6.2-billion, six?-year pro-
 gram to eliminate water pollution and a bill
 authorizing $196 million over three years to
 combat air pollution.
 For cleaner air, the bill would provide up
 to 60 per cent of the costs of antipollution
 programs for individual communities and up
 to 60 per cent for campaigns undertaken
 jointly by cities or states.
 For  cleaner  water,  the Senate program
 would go well beyond Administration re-
 quests.                                                                               In fact, in his testimony on a similar
 bill before the corresponding House Commit-
 tee, Interior Secretary Udall had urged a ceil-
 ing of $3.45 billion over five years.
 Senators did not just pluck the $6-billion
 figure out of thick air, however.  This sum
 would provide Federal contributions aver-
 aging about a third of the cost of urgently
 needed water purification programs across
 the country.  Sponsors ' believe that if the
 states and localities cooperated properly, this
 expanded program could eliminate the pres-
 ent $20-billion backlog of required waste-
 treatment facilities over the six-year period.
 Mr. Udall is under budgetary pressure be-
 cause of the expanding war effort in Viet-
 nam.                                                                               Even his proposed ceiling would go
 well beyond current programs and President
 Johnson's request for the clean-rivers cam-
 paign this year.  But the need Is clear and a
 COMMUNISTS LOSE GROUND
 Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, if we think
 we have world problems, consider the
 view from the Communist angle.
 The Aurora, Ill., Beacon-News, one of
 the Copley newspapers, makes this sug-
 gestion in an editorial describing the
 domestic and international failures that
 mar the outlook for Red China and Rus-
 sia.
 Their problems do not solve ours, the
 newspaper acknowledges, but they do in-
 dicate that our policies furthering multi-
 lateral alliances and economic stability
 among friends are right.
 When the Communist world falters,
 the editorial advises, we should play from
 a hand of strength to assure victory for
 freedom and the dignity of man.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed in the RECORD this description
 of cracks in the Communist front.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Aurora (Ill.) Beacon News, July 11,
 1966]
 CRACKS  DEVELOP  ON  ALL  FRONTS--COM:MU-
 NISTS LOSE GROUND
 If at times, the world problems of the
 United States of America seem grim and de-
 pressing, consider how the globe must look
 to the Communist today.
 Red China, one of the two major atheistic
 Communist powers, is fighting a bitter in-
 ternal ideological war and has a serious dif-
 ference of opinion with Russia.
 Its aggression in Indonesia was a total
 flop; it has alienated India and even Pakistan
 has shown a noticeable cooling to the wiles
 of Mao Tse-tung.  A Red Chinese ideological
 invasion  of       Africa  was  a  dismal  failure.
 Peking's agricultural and industrial economy
 is archaic and stagnating.
 The problems of Russia, the other large
 Marxist power, are no less serious.  Its agri-
 culture is so weak it is still spending hoarded
 gold to buy Free World wheat.  Its industries
 are years behind major free world nations
 despite abortive attempts at a pseudo free-
 enterprise system.  The people are restive,
 demanding more consumer goods and more
 luxuries.
 In the political realm the problems of RI1s-
 sia make those of the United States seem
 small.  After 11 years of existence, the War-
 saw Pact, a, counterpart to the North Atlantic
 Treaty Organization, is faltering.  Without
 total Russian domination,  there probably
 would not be a pact.
 Romania, Yugoslavia and even the militant
 Czechoslovakia are rebelling at the iron hand
 of the Kremlin.  Additionally, communism
 and Catholicism are in a major confrontation
 in Poland.  And on the other side of the
 continent, China is casting covetous eyes on
 its former territories in Siberia.
 In Southeast Asia the war is going badly
 for both the Red Chinese who spur it ideolog-
 ically, and the Russians who are supplying
 much of the equipment and technical knowl-
 edge.
 In the American hemisphere, the Russians
 have an albatross in the form of Fidel Castro,
 who may be near the verge of collapse in
 Cuba.  The problem is further aggravated for
 Russia by failure of the Cuban sugar crop
 and inordinately low world prices for the
 commodity.
 Because of quick and proper United States
 assistance, the Communists failed to gain a
 toehold   in   the   Dominican  Republic.

 vide the ridiculous symbol of their fears by
 erecting a wall in Berlin.  Only recently has
 there been a relaxing of the barriers that for
 so long separated the Communist-dominated
 countries behind the Iron Curtain from the
 rest of the world.
 Red-leaders have concluded-and correct-
 ly so-that they have much to lose if they
 end their isolation.  The aggressive designs
 that typify Communist nations merely serve
 to keep the focus of attention on something
 other than their domestic problems.
 The President has made it clear that Red
 China has nothing to fear from the U.S. if
 it halts its exports of terror, and recognizes
 that "co-operation, not hostility, is the way
 of the future."  Even though the Red Chi-
 nese may not listen, the conciliatory speech
 cannot help but impress other world leaders.
 The timing of the policy outline was excel-
 lent-for the President could not have spoken
 convincingly a few months ago while Ameri-
 cans and South Vietnamese were being ter-
 rorized in the streets of Saigon and repeated-
 ly ambushed in the jungles of South Viet
 Nam.  Speaking now from a position of
 strength, the appeal is much more likely to
 be effective.
 Project Headstart Is Tremendously
 Beneficial
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JOHN E. MOSS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, July 12, 1966
 Mr. MOSS.  Mr.  Speaker,  Project
 Headstart has proven, in my judgment,
 to be tremendously beneficial. I had an
 opportunity for close observation of its
 operation in the city of Alexandria, Va.,
 ? last year as a result of the very active in-
 terest of my 16-year-old daughter who
 served as a volunteer participant in the
 program.  Her reports of improvements
 were most impressive. I believe that the
 benefits far outweigh the costs of the
 program-the successes more than over-
 balance the few instances of failure.
 The Sacramento Bee in an editorial in
 its issue of Wednesday, July 13, 1966, re-
 flects in part the broad public approval
 of Project Headstart.
 I commend the editorial, particularly
 the closing paragraph, to my colleagues:
 [From the Sacramento Bee, July 13, 1966]
 ALL START EQUAL?
 When Project Head Start was initiated in
 the attempt to create a better educational
 opportunity among the disadvantaged very
 young there was scoffing from the critics it
 would become just another extravagant gov-
 ernmental boondoggle.
 Well, after only a year's operation even the
 harshest critics have had to pull in their
 necks in the face of irrefutable testimony
 that Project Head Start represents a magnifi-
 cent beginning at helping the disadvantaged
 prepare for schooling.
 Those. who are expert in such things have
 found that the IQ of children enrolled in
 Head Start programs increases as much as 16
 per cent in the exposure.  They report there
 not only has been a marked improvement in
 the educational potential of these children,
 the project has helped the disadvantaged to
 adjust socially.  This cannot be considered
 only a side benefit. In a real sense, this ad-
 justment is absolutely essential to living the
 fuller, more creative life.
 There have been many stories told of the
 experiences of those working in Read Start
 programs.  Among them include the revela-
 tions that in the case of many Children, the
 tots never had a book of their own to open
 and reveled in their new discovery: The pic-
 ture and the written word.  In the case of
 another a Negro child was asked what a
 policeman was. She replied a policeman was
 someone who would hurt you and throw you
 in jail.  Such was her environmental con-
 cept of law, justice, in her tender years.
 There also is the story of the teacher who
 was reading to these tots when a little boy
 stopped her and asked what the word "love"
 meant.    It had been used in the sentence
 "The boy loves his lather."  H  had never
 learned the word in his four year of living.

 fortunes  of  family  and envir. anent  can

 New Opportunity in Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, July 27, 1966
 Mr. RYAN.   Mr. Speaker, when na-
 tions wage war it is rare that they talk
 to each other with words of sympathy.
 The more intense the war becomes, the
 more difficult it becomes to envision the
 parties negotiating to resolve their differ-
 ences.
 The war in Vietnam has reached that
 level of intensity where all talk of nego-
 tiations begins to sound like propaganda.
 It is, therefore, highly significant that for
 the first time in this war the North Viet-
 namese appear to have responded to a
 plea by the United States and by voices
 of humanity everywhere.  Ho Chi Minh
 has reportedly said that there is "no trial
 in view" for American military prisoners.
 In an editorial yesterday morning, the
 New York Times explored some of the
 possible implications of this statement.
 The editorial, which deserves our careful
 attention, follows:
 [From the New York Times, July 26, 1966]
 NEW OPPORTUNITY IN VIETNAM
 President Ho Chi Minh's statement that
 there is "no trial in view" for American mili-
 tary prisoners in worth Vietnam Is a victory
 for the moral Influence of world opinion.
 That  victory  transcends the fate  of  the
 captive airmen, for it offers hope that com-
 mon sense and common humanity ultimately
 may prevail against the ever greater barbar-
 ism the war in Vietnam daily inflicts on both.
 sides.
 The United States has yielded to the pres-
 sure of world opinion in the past by offer-
 ing peace proposals and twice suspending
 the bombing of North Vietnam.  But this is
 the first time that Hanoi has shown regard
 for the opinion of mankind.  Its decision to
 back away from talk of "war crimes trials"
 follows direct pleas from Secretary General
 Thant, Pope Paul VI, numerous governments
 and opinion leaders everywhere, including
 eighteen  liberal American Senators.   The
 hope now must be that reason can prevail
 on the broader issues of the war itself.
 The conflict in Vietnam is a political strug-
 gle that, in the end, can only be resolved by
 political means. In politics, timing is of the
 essence. A number of opportunities to probe
 the prospects for peace have been neglected
 in the past.  It is vital that the new atmos-
 phere and the new opportunity opened by
 Hanoi's response on the prisoner issue not
 be missed as well.
 The approach favored by American mod-
 erates and long urged by The Times has just
 been summed up admirably by Prof. Arthur
 M. Schlesinger Jr.  One essential element is
 to stop the Americanization of the war by
 halting the American buildup in South Viet-
 nam; a quarter of a million American troops
 is more than enough.  The second vital ele-
 ment is a civilian Government in Saigon that
 can open contact with the insurgent forces.
 Third, is the need to build an atmosphere
 conducive to negotiations by tapering off the
 bombing of North Vietnam.  Finally, efforts
 to reconvene the Geneva conference must be
 linked with  broad  diplomatic  discussions
 with Moscow, Paris and other interested
 states to find a formula for the neutralization
 and  economic  development of     Southeast
 Asia as a whole.
 Most of all, what is needed is a clear
 indication that the American objective is not
 military  victory  but  political settlement.
 The American ability to escalate the war
 needs no further demonstration.  The need
 now is to halt the escalation and make a
 vigorous new effort to achieve peace.
 Great Lakes Commission States Federal
 Water Pollution R. & D. Must Be Di-
 rected to Development of Effective New
 Waste Treatment Processes
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. HENRY S. REUSS
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, July 18, 1966
 Mr. REUSS.  Mr. Speaker, water pol-
 lution problems mount in the Nation, and
 it has long been known that the best
 available conventional waste treatment
 plants fail to do more than retard the
 growth of pollution.  Yet the Research
 and Technical Programs Subcommittee
 found in a recent investigation that Fed-
 eral R. & D. is not organized toward the
 development and actual field-scale test-
 ing of advanced treatment plants. Work
 on development of new technology pro-
 ceeds at a mere $5 million per year level,
 permitting only pilot-project-scale tests,
 while the remainder of some $30 million
 per year in Federal R. & D. is diffused into
 small, scattered research studies. Many
 of these are no doubt useful, but they
 are no substitute for a deliberate, well-
 organized program directed to the de-
 velopment of an adequate technology
 which could start reversing the tide of
 pollution in every stream, river, and lake
 in the country.
 The executive director of the Great
 Lakes Commission, Mr. Leonard J. Good-
 sell, in a letter to me deplores this failure
 to direct Federal R. & D. to the develop-
 ment of new, effective treatment meth-
 ods.                                                                                            Mr. Goodsell's, letter follows:

 July 27, 1966           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX
 In part a~ a result of this flooded bond
 market, these predictions have now been
 affirmed.  On July .21, the Wall Street
 Journal reported that Mississippi offered
 for sale four bond issues totaling $17,-
 433,000. Two of the bond issues were to
 finance improvements In the port facili-
 ties of Gulfport and Pascagoula, another
 would pay for capital improvements at
 various State institutions and junior
 colleges, and a fourth would be used to
 finance improvements to the State peni-
 tentiary.
 Only the small $300,000 penitentiary
 Issue which matures in 5 years was sold.
 The interest rate ,was just under 4 per-
 cent.
 The State rejected as too costly a bid
 of nearly 4.1 percent interest on the bond
 Issue to improve State institutions. The
 other two port facility offerings carried
 a maximum interest limitation of 4 per-
 cent and consequently, no bids were
 received.
 All  four  bond  issues  were  rated
 Double A by Moody's and Single A by
 Standard & Poor's.
 As,a result of the'high interest rates
 on municipal bonds-in part the conse-
 quence of the glutted municipal bond
 market-Mississippi will have to look
 elsewhere for financing for its needed
 public improvements.
 The July 21 Wall Street Journal article
 follows:
 FOUR MISSISSIPPIISSUES OFFERED, BUT ONLY
 ONE, $300,000 BONDS, IS SOLD-rSTATE RE-
 JECTS BIDS ON $13,683,000 BONDS AND FAILS
 To RECEIVE ANY ON TWO ISSUES TOTALING
 $3,450,000
 (By a Wall Street Journal staff reporter)
 JACKSON, Miss.-Mississippi offered four
 bond Issues totaling $17,433,000 for sale, but
 awarded only the smallest issue, totaling
 $300,000.  It rejected bids for $13;683,000 of
 bonds and failed to receive bids on the other
 two Issues, totaling $3,450,000.
 The $300,000 general-obligation peniten-
 tiary bond Issue, maturing in five years, was
 awarded to Deposit Guaranty National Bank
 of Jackson, Miss., bidding alone, at an annual
 net interest cost of 3;0955%.
 The state treasurer's office, however, re-
 jected both bids it received for Its biggest
 issue $13,683,000   general   improvement
 bonds.  The apparent best bid, offering an
 annual net interest cost of 4.0827%, came
 from a group headed by Chase Manhattan
 Bank, Blyth & Co. and Lehman Brothers.
 A group led by First National City Bank of-
 fered an annual net interest cost of 4.2260%.
 TRYING FOR 4-PERCENT BID
 "We obviously were hoping for a bid under
 4%, but I don't think any of us were too sur-
 prised the bids were over 4% In view of the
 bond market situation," said State Treasurer
 William F. Winter, noting that "Louisiana
 rejected a bid over 4.50% recently."  Mr.
 Winter said he didn't know of any civil rights
 protests against the Mississippi bond offering
 and didn't believe the recent civil rights
 march in the state had any detrimental effect
 on the bids it received for its bonds.
 -Before its bid was rejected., the Chase-
 Blyth-Lehman group was reoffering'the bonds
 to investors, subject to award, from a yield
 of 3.751/'o for the July 1, 1967, maturities to
 a dollar'price of 100% for 4% bonds, due
 July 1, 1977-86.
 All of the bonds are rated double-A by
 Moody's and single-A by Standard & Poor's.
 Proceeds were to have been used for Capital
 improvements at various state institutions
 and junior colleges.
 NO BID ON PORT ISSUES
 The state failed to draw any bids for two
 port Issues totaling $3,450;000' and carrying a
 maximum Interest limitation of 4%.  Pro-
 ceeds from these bonds would have gone for
 improvements at Gulfport and Pascagoula.
 Mr. Winter said that state will finance con-
 struction slated to be supported by the $13,-
 683,000 general  improvement  bonds                                                           from
 short-term loans from local banks.  He said
 several alternative financing plans, includ-
 ing short-term borrowing, are being studied
 for the planned port improvements.
 Compared with other recent municipal is-
 sues, the 4.0827%  "didn't look like a bad
 bid," Mr. Winter declared.  "But the imme-
 diacy of our needs Isn't such to cause us to
 pay that rate at this time. We're aware that
 sooner or later we may have to pay that
 interest, but we're deferring that decison for
 several months."
 On its previous trip to the bond market,
 June 23, 1965, Mississippi obtained an annual
 net interest cost of 3.3487% in selling $8.3
 million  general  improvement  bonds,  due
 July 1, 1968-87, and an annual net interest
 cost of 3.5664% in selling $3.5,million Greater
 Port of Pascagoula improvement bonds, due

 prohibit discrimination in residential
 housing transactions by persons in the
 housing  business.  Because  of  these
 questions I requested statistics and re-
 search material relating to fair housing
 laws in the various States and territories
 in order to evaluate the impact of title
 IV on my own State of New York and on
 the Nation.
 The statistics are interesting and re-
 vealing and I believe my colleagues will
 find them helpful in formulating a posi-
 tion with respect to title IV of the bill
 H.R.14765.
 The State of New York has a more
 comprehensive law against discrimina-
 tion than the bill before the House this
 week.  The New York State law prohibits
 discrimination in the sale, leasing, or
 rental of all housing except owner-occu-
 pied two family dwellings and the rental
 of a room in an owner-occupied house.
 Of particular significance is the fact that
 real estate brokers and lending institu-
 tions, are specifically covered by the New
 York State law.
 Seventeen States and the District of
 Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
 Islands have fair housing laws which
 go beyond title IV of the proposed Civil
 Rights Act of 1966. These 17 States rep-
 resent more than 50 percent of the total
 population of the United States.
 The laws of these 17 States cover pub-
 Ile housing or publicly assisted housing
 A3979
 and all cover private housing.. Eight of
 these States cover single family homes
 and only two-Michigan and Indiana--
 exempt realtors.  Four States and one
 territory excludes lending institutions.
 The 17 States are Alaska, California,
 Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Maine,
 Massachusetts, Michigan,  Minnesota,
 New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
 Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Is-
 land,-and Wisconsin.
 More than half of all U.S. ctizens
 live under fair housing law which go
 beyond the coverage of the legislation
 now under consideration by this Chain--
 ber.                                                                                           The other citizens of the United
 States are entitled to the same protec-
 tion for so long as we diminish the rights
 of a single American, the rights of elf
 American are in danger.  Freedom and
 democracy can make no distinctions
 with respect to equal treatment of our
 citizens and I urge my colleagues to for-
 mulate their decision upon this prin-
 ciple and to support the proposed Civil
 Rights Act of 1966.
 L.B.J.'s Policy Outline Well Timed
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLAIR CALLAN
 OF NEBRASKA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, July 27, 1966
 Mr. CALLAN. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
 dent's statement of policy in Asia before
 the American Alumni Council has been
 received with praise by several newspap-
 ers across the country. I am particularly
 proud that such endorsement is con-
 tained in a recent editorial by the Nor-?
 folk Daily News of Norfolk, Nebr., one
 of the Nation's leading smalltown daily
 newspapers.
 This editorial comment recognizes that
 the President's speech may not have an
 immediate influence on the leaders of
 Red China. But it contends the speech
 will have a valuable impact on other
 countries-including those behind the
 Iron Curtain.
 I am pleased to submit this editorial
 for publication in the RECORD:
 [From the Norfolk (Nebr.) Daily News, July
 14, 1966]
 L.B.J.'s  POLICY  OUTLINE WELL TIMED
 Red China's leaders may not be impressed
 by President Johnson's outline of U.S. poli-
 cies toward that nation, but the effect of his
 Tuesday message upon officials in many oth-
 er countries, especially the neutralist ones or
 those with Communist sympathies; should be
 great.  This might ultimately help convince
 the Red Chinese that there is more to be
 gained  from  the  "peaceful  co-existence"
 which the President offered than there is
 in pursuing Asian conquest.
 President Johnson simply asked the Red
 Chinese to renounce aggression and to open
 their doors to the world. This is, at the same
 time, the most difficult thing for Communists
 to do.
 It was not until after nearly four decades
 of Communist rule in Russia that its officials
 opened the doors just a crack,  The Commu-
 nists in East Germany went so far as to pro-
