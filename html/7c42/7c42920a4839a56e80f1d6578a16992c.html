THE WEEK IN PERSPECTIVE 1 
VIETNAM 
The Viet Cong have launched a major military-political 
campaign against the South Vietnamese Government's 
pacification program. In Saigon, political interest 
is focused on the selection of candidates for the 
presidency and the upper house of the legislature. 
Soviet shipments of economic aid to Hanoi have in-
creased significantly 
USSR AND MALAYSIA AGREE ON TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC TIES 
The pact results from Moscow's search for additional 
contacts in Southeast Asia and from Kuala Lumpur's 
efforts to facilitate its rubber trade with the USSR 
and to improve its image in Asia and Africa. 
PEKING MOUNTS NEW CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT LIU SHAO-CHI 
The stage is apparently being set to strip the 69-year-
old Chinese Communist chief of state of all his formal 
positions. This is one of many signs of continued 
dissension over the future course of the Cultural Rev-
olution.

EASTERN EUROPEAN DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY 
A number of Eastern European countries are making 
almost frantic efforts to slow down West Germany's 
campaign to normalize relations as well as create a 
facade of unity before a conference of European Com-
munist parties opens on 24 April. 
STATUS OF THE SOVIET ECONOMIC REFORM 
Moscow's sparse reporting on the reform's progress 
suggests that difficulties continues to outweigh 
achievements. 
YUGOSLAV "DEMOCRATIZATION" GAINS MOMENTUM 
After dismissing his conservative heir-apparent Ran-
kovic last year, Tito accelerated his program to de-
centralize economic and political authority in Yugo-
slavia and loosen the party's tight control. Changes 
made since then have aggravated the opposition to 
this program and created some ',problems which endanger 
achievement of its goals. Tito, however, continues 
his policy of cautious, moderate change. (Published

SOVIET-EGYPTIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS PROBABLY REVIEWED 
Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a hasty, unpub-
licized visit to Cairo last week amid signs that 
Egypt's economic problems may have created some strain 
in Soviet-Egyptian relations. 
VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN ADEN 
Violence broke out as expected when the UN mission 
arrived but, despite nationalist predictions, did not 
get out of hand. The general strike, however, was 
effective. 
NEW STATE-LEVEL DEFEATS FOR INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY 
The fall of the Congress government in the key state 
of Uttar Pradesh highlights continuing political in-
stability on the state level, although the party re-
tains its slim majority on the national level. 
ANGOLAN INSURGENCY DRAWS PORTUGUESE REPRISAL 
Insurgency along Angola's main railroad by Angolan 
nationalists operating out of the Congo (Kinshasa) 
and Zambia has prompted the Portuguese to suspend 
transit trade in an effort to force those two 
countries to clamp down on the insurgents.

CRACKS IN THE MEXICAN MONOLITH 
The controlling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI) is selecting candidates for congressional and 
some gubernatorial elections in July in which an 
overwhelming PRI victory is certain. There are 
signs, however, that the increasingly sophisticated 
Mexican electorate wants more representative leader-
ship. 
LABOR RESISTANCE TO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT POLICY WEAKENS 
Various factions are competing for the leadership of 
the General Confederation of Labor, and the Onaania 
government is taking advantage of the disunity in 
worker ranks to impose wage controls designed to com-

FAR EAST 
There are new signs of sharp dissension within 
the Chinese leadership over the future course of the 
Cultural Revolution. After two months of marking 
time, forces loyal to Mao Tse-tung have renewed 
their attacks on Chief of State Liu Shao-chi and 
party General Secretary Teng Hsiao-ping. Several 
leading members of the Military Affairs Committee 
have also been denounced by militants responsive to 
Mao and Lin Piao. 
The resurgence of pro-Mao forces, following a 
conference of central committee members last month, 
suggests an attempt to resume the purge of Mao's op-
ponents and to reverse the policies associated with 
Chou En-lai--particularly those aimed at subduing 
militant Red Guards and Red Rebels. The attacks on 
Liu, Teng, and key military leaders may signal a 
drive by pro-Mao militants to divide the coalition 
of forces which obliged the Mao faction to retreat 
in late January and February. 
The Vietnamese Communists are maintaining their 
intransigent stand on negotiations. Despite unusu-
ally heavy casualties and the failure of three regi-
mental-size attacks against US forces engaged in Op-
eration JUNCTION CITY, there are no signs of any de-
cline in Communist determination to prosecute the 
war. The first round of local elections for South 
Vietnam's village councils was held without serious 
incidents or Viet Conq interference.

VIETNAM 
Following the Communists' un-
successful and costly regimental 
attack of 1 April--their third in 
two weeks against US forces con-
ducting Operation JUNCTION CITY 
north of Saigon--military activ-
ity during the week consisted 
mainly of smaller scale but fre-
quently intensive clashes in 
widely scattered areas of the 
country. Recent patterns of Com-
munist activity, meanwhile, ap-
pear to bear out indications that 
the Viet Cong have decided to 
launch a major campaign of mili-
tary and political harassment 
against the Revolutionary Develop-
ment (RD) program. 
reflect increas-
ing Viet Cong concern and frus-
tration, particularly since the 
fall of 1966, with pacification 
measures and military operations 
designed to erode popular support 
for the Communists. Late last 
year the Peoples Revolutionary 
Party (PRP)--the Communist party 
in the south and the political 
control apparatus of the Viet 
Cong--apparently decided on sub-
stantially increased levels of 
guerrilla warfare and civilian 
proselyting to consolidate Viet 
Cong holdings in the countryside 
and reverse the RD successes. 
Recent Viet Cong and Hanoi 
propaganda broadcasts have urged 
Communist armed forces to an-
nihilate US-rebel pacif_cation 
groups" and announced the estab-
lishment of an award sytpm fn  
encourage this effort.  
the Communists 
plan to recruitand infiltrate 
a large number of key urder-
ground party workers into ham-
let and village administrations, 
to induce peasants to obstruct 
pacification, to propagandize 
the RD program as an American-
sponsored activity, to initiate 
large-scale attacks on areas 
where RD is enjoying suc:ess, 
and to direct selective acts of 
terrorism against RD team work-
ers in an effort to harass and 
demoralize the workers and in-
timidate the population. 
The number of Viet Cong - 
initiated incidents targeted 
against the RD program thus far 
in 1967 already substantiatly 
exceeds the total number re-
ported for all of 1966. During 
the first quarter of 1967 nearly 
200 enemy attacks against RD 
team workers were reportel, 105 
of which occurred during the pe-
riod 1-26 March.

Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai prov-
inces, is to prevent expansion 
of the RD program in these three 
southernmost provinces of I Corps. 
This campaign reportedly will 
begin on 15 April and continue 
through September. 
Election Plans in South Vietnam 
With South Vietnam's con-
stitution now in effect, politi-
cal activity is centering in-
creasingly on elections to fill 
out the institutional framework. 
Already, in the absence of any 
real national cohesion or gen-
uine political organizations, 
traditional regional and religious 
considerations appear to be in-
fluencing the political maneuver-
ing for presidential and vice-
presidential tickets in the ex-
pectation that such factors will 
weigh heavily in the elections. 
The only firm candidacy 
among prominent civilians in the 
?residential race thus far is 
that of Constituent Assembly 
chairman Phan Khac Suu, an elderly 
southerner of the Cao Dai sect 
and a former chief of state. 
Suu's general area of strength 
is the populous delta, and his 
slate will probably gain addi-
tional votes on the popularity 
of his running mate, Dr. Phan 
Quang Dan, among northern ref-
ugees in the Saigon area. How-
ever, former premier Tran Van 
Huong, another prestigious south-
erner, is expected to announce 
his candidacy soon, and Suu and 
Huong may well end up splitting 
the southern regionalist vote. 
Dai Viet party leader Ha Thuc 
Ky is another apparent civilian 
candidate, but his popular base 
is largely limited to the two 
northernmost provinces. He may 
ultimately decide to trade his 
support for a spot on some other 
candidate's ticket. 
Fencing for the military's 
presidential nomination con-
tinues between Chief of State 
Thieu and Premier Ky, with Ky 
slightly ahead thus far. Pub-
licly, Ky has stated on several 
occasions that he would defer 
to Thieu's candidacy, thus in 
effect putting pressure on 
Thieu to declare himself. Thieu, 
who may have some doubts about 
his chances in any case, prob-
ably would far prefer to ac-
cept a nomination by the mili-
tary than to announce his 
candidacy on his own. Privately, 
maneuvering undoubtedly con-
tinues on both sides, although 
Thieu's natural reticence in 
public may be working against 
him behind the scenes as well. 
The military hierarchy appears 
hopeful that Thieu and Ky will 
resolve the question themselves. 
If the two men cannot agree 
soon, however, other senior gen-
erals may have to decide the 
matter. 
In any event, the over-
riding consideration in the

sEcRgr 
process continues to be the pres-
ervation of military unity. 
Both Thieu and Ky appear well 
aware that such unity will de-
pend largely upon the degree of 
support that the one who does 
not run offers the nominee. Pro-
viding that military unity re-
mains intact and that an accept-
able civilian running mate is 
selected, the military candi-
date will be in an extremely 
strong position in view of his 
connections with the only real 
national organization and his 
access to other governmental 
machinery. 
On the legislative side, 
potential candidates are already 
stirring for the upper house 
elections--which will be held 
concurrently with the presiden-
tial election on 1 September. 
Constituent Assembly deputies, 
members of the Peoples - Armed 
Forces Advisory Council, and 
politicians currently out of 
office are reportedly maneuver-
ing to form ten-man electoral 
slates as called for in the con-
stitution. Balloting will be 
on a nationwide, at-large basis, 
and the winning slates will com-
prise the 30- to 60-man Senate. 
The lower house election, set 
for 1 October, has not yet at-
tracted as much attention, but 
many Constituent Assembly mem-
bers apparently have their eye 
on this race. 
The first step toward im-
plementing local reforms took 
place on 2 April with the elec-
tion of some 219 village coun-
cils throughout the courr_ry. 
Voter turnout was high, urd lit-
tle Viet Cong counterelection ac-
tivity materialized. Hovever, 
US officials remain concerned 
about postelection securty for 
the successful candidates. 
Soviet Aid Deliveries to Hanoi 
Soviet shipping to North 
Vietnam increaspd  
25X1 
propaply in response to agree-
ments reached last fall on addi-
tional economic aid. Over-all 
shipments of commercial cargo 
were up almost 70 percent over 
the same period of 1966. Pe-
troleum shipments were up some 
25 percent over the average 
delivery rate last year, and 
deliveries of fertilizer, 
transportation and construction 
equipment, and machinery and

Part of the larger aid deliv-

usual North Vietnamese fouc re-
quirements. During this pe-
riod the USSR delivered 3G,000 
tons of grain products, con-
pared with only 6,000 in all 
of 1966. 
an unusi.ally 
large number of Soviet ships 
called at North Vietnamese ports 
in the first three months of the 
year--63 compared with a total 
of only 122 for all of 1966. 
This reflects the use of smaller 
ships drawn from the Soviet Far 
Eastern Fleet.

USSR AND MALAYSIA AGREE ON TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC TIES 
An agreement signed early 
this week between the USSR and 
Malaysia on trade and diplomatic 
ties results from Moscow's search 
for additional contacts in South-
east Asia and from Kuala Lumpur's 
efforts to facilitate its rubber 
trade with the USSR and to improve 
its image in Asia and Africa. 
The trade agreement provides 
for the establishment in the Ma-
laysian capital of a ten-man So-
viet mission, three members of 
which will have diplomatic im-
munity, and provides for a recip-
rocal Malaysian mission in Mos-
cow. The missions will constitute 
the first permanent exchange of 
representation of any sort be-
tween the two countries. No date 
is set for the establishment of 
the missions, but Kuala Lumpur 
reportedly does not expect the 
first Soviet representatives to 
arrive before July. Although 
the text of the agreement has 
not been published, it provides 
for "most favored nation" treat-
ment without setting any levels 
of trade. 
The communique also announced 
agreement in principle to exchange 
diplomatic representation. Ma-
laysia presently does not have 
diplomatic ties with any Commu-
nist country, but there are sev-
eral incentives for this change 
in policy. The European Commu-
nist nations comprise the prin-
cipal market for Malaysia's rub-
ber at a time when world rubber 
prices are falling--last year 
the USSR was its largest single 
customer. The Malaysians prob-
ably also believe that these 
moves will improve their image 
among nonaligned nations who 
have been critical of Kuala Lum-
pur's Western orientation. 
The agreement marks a sig-
nificant achievement in Moscow's 
long-standing effort to establish 
contacts in Southeast Asian coun-
tries where it has not tradition-
ally been active. In April l9ffi 
it signed a trade agreement with 
Singapore with provisions simi-
lar to those in the Malaysian 
agreement. Singapore subse-
quently agreed to accept a one-
man TASS office. The Soviets 
have also been seeking a TASS 
office in Kuala Lumpur, and the 
latest agreement may encourage 
them to renew this request. 
Last month Soviet and Phil-
ippine representatives held talks 
in Bangkok concerning the possi-
ble initiation of trade, and an 
unofficial Philippine mission is 
scheduled to leave for Moscow 
later this month. Although Ma-
nila has thus far refused to 
establish either trade or diplo-
matic relations with any Commu-
nist country, the Malaysian 
agreement may inluence a change  
( 
in this policy.

PEKING MOUNTS NEW CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT LIU SHAO-CHI 
The stage is apparently be-
ing set in Peking to strip Liu 
Shao-chi of all his formal posi-
tions. Until August 1966 the 
69-year-old chief of state was 
number two man in the party. 
Teng Hsiao-ping, party general 
secretary, will in all likeli-
hood be removed with Liu, and 
other high officials may be in-
volved. These developments fol-
low a reportedly stormy central 
committee work conference con-
vened in mid-March, and appear 
to reflect continuing dissension 
in the leadership. 
Demonstrations against Liu 
have spread to all parts of China. 
Foreign newsmen in Peking report 
that since 2 April the streets 
have been choked from morning 
to night with hundreds of thou-
sands of demonstrators. March-
ing in well-disciplined columns 
the crowds carried portraits of 
Mao and chanted "down with Liu 
Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-ping, and 
Tao Chu." Tao was fourth in 
the hierarchy established at the 
central committee plenum last 
August, but has been in disfavor 
since December. 
It now is almost certain 
that Liu and Teng lost all sig-
nificant authority in August. 
They have been heavily attacked 
through posters, Red Guard news-
papers, and rallies since Decem-
ber, but the official campaign 
against them began with a 30 
March broadcast of a Red Flag  
attack on Liu's book How To Be 
A Good Communist. This key party 
document--written in 1939 and re-
published in 1962--now is labeled 
a "poisonous weed." On 31 March 
Peking broadcast a more direct 
and savage Red Flag attack which 
described Liu as a "vampire," a 
"parasite," and a "Quisling" and 
demanded that this "Khrushchev-
like individual ambitionist and 
schemer" be thoroughly discred-
ited and removed. 
Liu is being accused of at-
tempting to compromise with 
Chiang Kai-shek in the 1930s 
and to strike a political bar-
gain with the US in 1949 in ex-
change for economic aid. He is 
also accused of advocating ex-
tension of privately farmed plots 
in rural areas, detente with 
the US and the Soviet Union, and 
reduced assistance to other 
"peoples' revolutionary strug-
gles." The official charges, 
without directly naming Liu, 
state that he has always op-
posed Mao's thought and 
"peddled" his own writings--in 
contrast to Vice Chairman (and 
present number two) Lin Piao, 
who has always called on his 
soldiers to study Chairman Mao's 
works. 
The charges against Liu are 
obviously fabricated, as his 
statements and actions during 
the past 17 years have shown him 
to be a staunch supporter of 
Mao's policies. One purpose 
clearly is to blacken Liu's 
name even more and to justify 
his ouster. Another may be to 
rekindle enthusiasm for the

Cultural Revolution. Certain of 
the accusations, such as exten-
sion of the private agricultural 
plots, have been standard ones 
leveled against unnamed "class 
enemies" for several years. 
Chou En-lai himself made these 
charges in an address given in 
December 1964 at a major ses-
sion of the National People's 
Congress. In fact, however, 
Chou, but not Liu Shao-chi, 
was associated with these 
policies when they were in 
vogue in 1961 and 1962. 
Chou, however, so far has 
been able to retain a firm grip 
on third place in the leader-
ship. In recent weeks prominent 
Red Guard groups in Peking have 
been aiming moderate to heavy 
fire at several of Chou's sub-
ordinates, but have exempted 
Chou from criticism. 
Current official denuncia-
tions of Liu accuse him of hav-
ing worked "in collusion with 
another top party person in au-
thority taking the capitalist 
road"--an obvious allusion to 
Teng Hsiao-Ping. The protracted 
campaign to remove the two men 
may best be explained by dis-
sension over who is to be impli-
cated with Liu and Teng and 
brought down. Many senior party 
figures have been closely as-
sociated with Liu and Teng, who 
had dominated the party appara-
tus for more than a decade be-
fore their fall last Auuust. 
The campaign againEt Liu and 
Teng is apparently spilling over 
into new poster attacks by Red 
Guard militants against top-level 
military men and government of-
ficials. On 5 April three key 
military figures who hao seemed 
to be in good standing--Hsu 
Hsiang-chien, Yeh Chien-ving, 
and Nieh Jung-chen--came inder 
fire. Hsu and Yeh were pub-
licly affirmed as vice chairmen 
of the party's powerful vIAAtary 
Affairs Committee on 25 Aarch. 
New attacks on Foreign Minister 
Chen Yl and Finance Minister Li 
Hsien-nien for pushing tne "Liu-
Teng line" have appeared. De-
spite this, Chen has corn_nnued 
to perform his public duties 
and, with his usual aplout, 
told a group of visiting Japa-
nese on 3 April that he wel-
comed criticism and was not 
worried about his personal po-
sition. 
Rallies and poster Ettacks 
during the past week appcar to 
be part of a major effort by 
militant elements in the lead-
ership to reverse the slowdown 
in the Cultural Revolution 
noted during February and early 
March. All signs, however, 
point to continued dissension 
among leaders in Peking over 
the future course of the all-
tural Revolution.1

EUROPE 
East European diplomatic activity continued 
apace this week but produced no evident departures 
from established positions on relations with West 
Germany or on attendance at the conference of Euro-
pean Communist parties scheduled for late April. 
The numerous bilateral consultations serve pri-
marily to prevent additional rents in the already 
ragged fabric of East European unity, at least in 
advance of the conference. 
Moscow appears to be somewhat disconcerted by 
press reports of US assurances to Bonn that the 
draft nonproliferation treaty would not bar German 
participation in a future European nuclear force. 
Recent Pravda and Izvestia articles have asserted 
that such assurances undermine "the spirit an pur-
poses of the proposed treaty" and create new ob-
stacles rather than clear the way to an agreement. 
Although the Soviets have not said an agreement so 
construed is unacceptable, the publicizing of this 
interpretation in the West causes difficulties for 
them, given their general posture vis-a-vis West 
Germany and the prospect of demands on the USSR by 
some Warsaw Pact countries for a greater role in 
nuclear defense matters. 
In France, the 261-214 vote which reaffirmed 
Chaban-Delmas as president of the National Assembly 
suggests that the Gaullists will have little trouble 
finding parliamentary support for government pro-
grams. The full extent of government control over 
the assembly will not be clear until the presidents 
of the six standing committees are elected in the 
next few days.

S EU K. P, 
EASTERN EUROPEAN DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY 
The heavy round of diplo-
matic activity in Eastern Europe 
that began in February continues 
unabated. It has two related 
purposes: to slow down West Ger-
many's campaign to normalize its 
relations with the Eastern Euro-
peans and to create a facade of 
unity in Eastern Europe before 
the conference of European Commu-
nist parties which is to open at 
Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, on 
24 April. 
This week, Poland's Gomulka 
went to Bulgaria to renew a treaty 
of friendship and mutual assist-
ance?almost a year before it was 
due to expire. The treaty links 
Sofia with treaties Warsaw had 
already signed with East Germany 
and Czechoslovakia, and with one 
between East Germany and Czech-
oslovakia. It is intended to 
forestall any early bid by Sofia 
for diplomatic relations with 
Bonn. 
Bulgaria has in addition 
agreed to renew its friendship 
treaty with the USSR which is 
also nearly a year from expira-
tion. 
While Sofia bowed to the 
pressure of its allies despite 
an obvious interest in relations 
with Bonn, efforts to get Hungary 
into the treaty network have had 
no visible success. The Russians 
probably made the first represen-
tations when Janos Kadar visited 
Moscow in February. Gomulka paid 
an official visit to Budapest in 
early March and East German For-
eign Minister Winzer took up the 
quest late in the month. 
The Hungarians have appar-
ently made no promises and may 
be bolstered in their resolve 
by the visit later this month 
of Rumania's Ceausescu--who 
started things by establishing 
relations with Bonn virtually 
without conditions in January. 
However, Budapest has agreed to 
further talks with the East Ger-
mans. 
Meanwhile, preparations for 
the Karlovy Vary conference have 
run into some discord. Several 
parties--particularly the Ital-
ian--reportedly view the origi-
nal uocuments that the French 
and the Poles prepared for the 
meeting as too rigid. Czecho-
slovak party secretary Koucky's 
unannounced visit to Moscow on 
30 March probably was to smooth 
the way for appointing the Ital-
ians and Czechs to a redrafting 
committee. 
The Poles and the Italians 
have been entrusted with the 
task of persuading East Europe's 
twin mavericks--Rumania and 
Yugoslavia--to send delegations 
to Karlovy Vary. Those countries, 
however, appear to be lobbying 
in their own behalf. Both Tito 
and Ceausescu, have conferred 
with leaders in Moscow since 
February and with each other. 
High-level Yugoslav delegations 
have visited Warsaw and Bucharest, 
and Ceausescu, as noted, will soon 
visit Budapest. 
There are rumors of indeci-
siveness in Bucharest, but there 
seems little likelihood that either 
Rumania or Yugoslavia will send of-
ficial delegations. Bucharest may 
in the end decide to send observers, 
however.

STATUS OF THE SOVIET ECONOMIC REFCRM 
The reform movement in 
Soviet industry, nearing the 
halfway mark of its initial phase 
(1966-68), has so far been only 
a partial success. While such 
an evaluation now is necessarily 
qualified because Moscow's report-
ing has been sparse, the very 
lack of data suggests that the 
program's difficulties continue 
to outweigh its achievements. 
Implementation of the reform 
movement resumed early this year 
after a moratorium during the 
last quarter of 1966 on the 
transfer of enterprises to the 
new system of management and in-
centives. The number of converted 
enterprises was scheduled to to-
tal about 2,500 by the end of 
March, although less than a third 
of this number had been trans-
ferred by the end of 1966. The 
schedule calls for half of all 
industrial enterprises to be 
working under the new system by 
the end of 1967, with the re-
mainder to be converted during 
1968. 
The reform is also being 
extended to the nonindustrial 
sectors of the economy on an as 
yet unspecified schedule. Trans-
portation, communications, and 
service enterprises have already 
been affected, and recent press 
discussion indicates that several 
hundred state farms will be re-
organized according to the new 
principles. 
The Soviets claim that en-
terprises transferred to the new 
system last year considerably 
outperformed industry as a whole 
in terms of sales, profit, and 
labor productivity. This coes 
not necessarily vindicate the 
reform principles, however, since 
the converted plants were Ehove 
average in efficiency in -te 
first place. Moscow has been 
silent on how their 1966 pEr-
formances compared with p:-Evious 
years. 
A large part of the reformed 
plants' good showing last year 
probably came from their mere 
efficient use of land, labor, 
and capital. To the extet that 
the new principles reduce the 
inefficiency of the old s.7E;tem--
which emphasizes maximum output 
with few penalties for the 
wasteful use of resources--they 
will bring about a temporarily 
accelerated rate of growt'i_ 
The reform movement ',,111 
take a major step forward cn 
July when new wholesale prices 
are adopted for heavy indistry. 
Comparable revisions went _nto 
effect early this year for light 
industry. The present pha:;e of 
the Soviet economic reform, how-
ever, is just a beginning, and 
the basic tenets of the Spviet 
economic system--central planning 
and administratively set prices--
remain unaltered. Bureaucratic 
interference and obstrucLionism 
from the banks continue tp com-
pound the problem of conv2rting 
part of Soviet industry tD the 
new system while the majority of 
factories operate on theid 
principles. The long-term re-
sults thus will be determined by 
actions taken in subseauenT: 
years.

MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA 
The quarterly rotation of Turkish troops on 
Cyprus--usually an occasion for incidents--went off 
smoothly. This was a boon to Athens because the 
Greek Government is currently embroiled in yet an-
other confrontation between the King and the Papan-
dreous. India's Congress government also is suffer-
ing setbacks having now lost control of all but 
seven of the 17 state legislatures. Its problems 
are exacerbated by the surprising unanimity of the 
opposition parties in putting forth candidates for 
the presidency and vice presidency, an act which 
caught Congress Party leaders off balance. 
Army machinations continue to plague three of 
West Africa's military regimes. In Dahomey, younger 
army officers are threatening to impose a supreme 
military committee on the ineffective Soglo govern-
ment. Togolese Army Chief of Staff Eyadema has 
stated privately that he would assume the title of 
chief of state on 13 April, giving up any idea of 
early elections. Sierre Leone's new military re-
gime is off to a shaky start with nascent factional-
ism within he ruling council and signs of restive-
ness among junior army officers. 
There have been recent movements of Tanzanian 
troops and military supplies to the Mozambique bor-
der, probably related to the anticipated renewal of 
activity by Mozambique guerrillas. Since insurgency 
began in late 1964, the guerrillas have mounted "of-
fensives" each spring at the end of the rainy season. 
In Congo (Kinshasa), Mobutu is talking about a mas-
sive reorganization of his parliament and extensive 
constitutional changes.

RIGHT-WING TAKE-OVER CHURNS GREEK POLITICAL CRISIS 
King Constantine's naming 
of National Radical Union (ERE) 
leader Kanellopoulos as premier 
early this week capped two weeks 
of intense political maneuvering 
in Athens. 
The King and the new premier 
are trying to obtain a parliamen-
tary vote of confidence and the 
passage of a simple proportional 
electoral bill, but the chances 
for success are slim. All of the 
other principal parties have de-
clared they will vote against the 
new government when it goes before 
Parliament on 12 April. Failing 
a vote of confidence, Kanel-
lopoulos is empowered to dissolve 
Parliament and to head a service 
government to supervise elections 
after a 45-day campaign period. 
The new cabinet is composed 
wholly of ERE deputies, many of 
whom support the self-exiled ERE 
strong man and former premier 
Constantine Karamanlis, who has 
had his differences with Kanel-
lopoulos in the past. This ap-
parent detente between the two 
party leaders could be short-
lived. Many ERE deputies are 
opposed to early elections because 
they fear their chances for re-
election are slim. Others have 
long expressed the view that some 
form of dictatorship is the only 
solution that can ensure the fu-
ture of "democracy" in Greece. 
Although it appears that the 
King is still aiming for elec-
tions in May, his installation of 
Kanellopoulos has once again re-
vived the "monarchy" question. 
Center Union (EK) leader George 
Papandreou has portrayed the 
King's action as a "grave scandal" 
and insists the "universal dis-
approval" of Kanellopoulos should 
persuade him to resign and permit 
the installation of an impartial 
service government to hold honest 
elections. Papandreou's son 
Andreas, the King's chief oppo-
nent, has taken his usually bit-
ter stand and charged that the 
King has lost forever the chance 
to reconcile himself with the 
Greek people. 
Public reaction to events 
so far has been generally mild, 
but there have been some student 
demonstrations. However, the EK 
and the crypto-Communist United 
Democratic Left can be expected 
to step up their antigovernment 
protests, and serious trouble 
could develop between the demon-
strators and the security forces. 
Kanellopoulos has promised swift 
police action if violence does 
occur. 
With the confidence debate 
not scheduled to begin before 
next week, the protagonists may 
have a short breathing spell. 
However, action is sure to step 
up at that time as the grappling 
for position continues. Regard-
less of the outcome of the vote, 
the King will almost surely face 
new hurdles before the elections.

SOVIET-EGYPTIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS PROBA 
Both Moscow and Cairo have 
been unusually tight-lipped about 
Foreign Minister Gromyko's visit 
to Egypt last week. The visit 
seems to have been arranged on 
short notice and took place amid 
signs that Egypt's economic prob-
lems may have created some strain 
in Soviet-Egyptian relations. 
The Soviet foreign minister's 
arrival was coincident with the 
presence in Cairo of a delegation 
from the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), which has been de-
manding stringent economic reform 
before considering any further 
assistance to Egypt. His visit 
also overlapped that of a high-
level Soviet economic delegation 
seeking to adjust the Soviet aid 
program to conform with Egypt's 
latest cutback in development 
plans. The latter delegation's 
only significant decision was to 
allocate about $161 million from 
earlier Soviet credits for expan-
sion and new construction at the 
steel complex in Helwan which 
have been under consideration for 
a number of years. 
Moscow has shown extreme re-
luctance in assuming the responsi-
bility for bailing Egypt out of 
its economic difficulties and 
probably is disquieted by Nasir's 
failure to heed Soviet advice. A 
Soviet economic advisory group, 
invited last fall by Nasir, rec-
ommended the adoption of an aus-
terity program similar to but 
less stringent than the IMF's 
and urged Cairo to reach some 
compromise with the IMF. Meeting 
the requirements of the IMF is 
LY REVIEWED 
the key to obtaining some relief 
from Western creditors who are 
owed about $200 million in 1-ird 
currency in 1967 alone. 
Moscow probably also is 
dismayed by Nasir's recent with-
drawal of Cairo's request ioi US 
wheat. The USSR has repeatedly 
stressed its reluctance to replace 
the US as a major supplier of 
Egypt's annual 2.5-million-ton 
import requirement. Although it 
is providing 250,000 tons of wheat 
with repayment under the bilateral 
clearing agreement, Moscow has of-
fered to provide an additional 
400,000 tons only if Cairo rays 
for it in hard cash or in commodi-
ties outside the clearing acree-
ment. France has imposed conditions 
just as severe, and Austra.ia, 
where Egypt now seeks whea7, is 
considering doing the same 
The unimformative communique' 
following Gromyko's visit merely 
mentioned that bilateral re3a-
tions were discussed and dealt 
almost exclusively with Vietnam 
and general foreign policy mat-
ters. The most topical foreign 
policy issue would have be?ri the 
situation in Aden. Moscow has not 
taken an active role in this is-
sue but could be expected to voice 
its concern if it felt that Arab 
rivalries in the area might lead 
to a dangerous escalation of the 
Saudi-Egyptian confrontation. The 
omission of any reference to 
economic matters--which were 
undoubtedly covered--may indicate 
that talks in this sphere were  
troubled and inconclusive./

VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN ADEN 
Violence erupted in Aden, as 
expected, upon the arrival of the 
UN advisory mission, but despite 
nationalist predictions, the riots 
did not get out of hand. The 
general strike, however, was com-
pletely effective. Each of the

the National Liberation Front 
(NLF), now seems to be directing

winning dominance over the other.

2 April, appear to have helped 
dampen the violent reception 
planned by the nationalist groups. 
Discovery of large arms caches by 
the authorities just beforehand 
may also have reduced the casual-
ties. Through 3 April, the of-
ficial count was three killed 
and 24 wounded as a direct result 
of the skirmishes between terror-
ists and British troops, but the 
final toll will undoubtedly run 
higher. 
The three-man UN mission--
composed of representatives of 
Afghanistan, Mali, and Venezuela--
is under the protection of some 
2,500 British troops. The mission 
has announced that it intends to 
proceed with its investigations 
"irrespective of the situation." 
So far the FLOSY and NLF leaders 
have refused to see the mission 
while it is under British sponsor-
ship. However, the mission plans 
to visit nationalist headquarters 
in Taizz, Yemen, in order to hear 
the views of the opposition lead-
ers. 
This UN concession to the 
nationalists' demands may do 
little to assist their cause, 
because of the vicious rivalry 
between the two main groups. 
FLOSY claims that it is the sole 
representative of the South Arabian 
people; the NLF says that these 
people are represented by several 
nationalist groups, including it-
self and FLOSY. Behind these 
surface issues, there is a deadly 
struggle for the postindependence 
dominance of South Arabian poli-
tics and for unchallenged support 
by Nasir. 
Several times previously 
the two groups have used general 
strikes and terrorist attacks in 
Aden to mask assassination at-
tempts against the leaders of 
the rival parties. Nationalist 
rivals are believed to have 
caused several casualties during 
the current demonstrations, in-
cluding the death of Haydar 
Shamshir, a FLOSY leader. This 
has exacerbated animosities to 
the point where a FLOSY speaker 
is reported to have told a mass 
rally on 4 April that Shamshir's 
assassination could touch off 
civil war. 
FLOSY has called for a con-
tinuation of the general strike 
through 10 April. The NLF opposes 
the extension and will distribute 
leaflets to this effect.

NEW STATE-LEVEL DEFEATS FOR INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY 
The fall of an 18-day-old 
Congress Party government in the 
state of Uttar Pradesh on 1 April 
highlights the continuing polit-
ical instability on the state 
level resulting from India's 
February general elections. On 
the national level, however, Con-
gress still retains its slim 
majority. 
The Uttar Pradesh government 
was the second Congress regime 
in two weeks to be toppled by 
defections from the party. Neigh-
boring Hariana, whose Congress 
Party administration collapsed 
in a similar manner on 22 March, 
now has a new non-Congress coali-
tion government led by the de-
fectors. The same kind of coali-
tion is expected to take power 
in Uttar Pradesh. 
The loss of Uttar Pradesh--
India's most populous state 
(about 85 million people) and 
once the major stronghold of 
Congress political power--was a 
jolting setback for the party. 
Congress now has majorities in 
only seven of the 17 state leg-
islative assemblies, has failed 
to win control of Goa's local 
government, and is out of power 
in two other union territory 
legislatures. Non-Congress gov-
ernments now control not only 
the two southernmost states but 
also those spanning the entire 
width of northern India and 
including some of the most heav-
ily populated and productive 
areas of the country. The future, -.-
stability of at least three more 
Congress state governments could   
be threatened by factionali3n 
and personality clashes. 
Several of the new non-
Congress state governments s:on-
tain built-in elements of in-
stability. Only the Communist-
dominated regime in Kerala, he 
regionalist government of Madras, 
and the conservative Swatantra-
led coalition in Orissa have 
fairly good prospects of hanging 
together. Elsewhere the ncn-
Congress coalitions are bond 
together mainly by their ccmmon 
desire to deprive Congress of

power. One of these disparate 
coalitions, the leftist-dominated 
government of West Bengal, has 
been confronted with a major 
problem in maintaining law and 
order in the capital city of 
Calcutta due to communal conflict 
between Hindus and Sikhs. 
The recent rash of defec-
tions from state Congress Party 
governments has touched off 
speculation that Congress' slim 
majority in the national Parlia-
ment may soon disappear. So 
far, however, the malaise has 
been confined to the states where 
the premium for defection from 
the organized party is greatest--
leadership of an alternative 
government. This incentive is 
absent in New Delhi where the 
splintered opposition parties 
have not yet been able to forge 
a united opposition front to at-
tract dissident Congress legis-
lators. 
ANGOLAN INSURGENCY DRAWS PORTUGUESE REPRISAL 
Insurgency along Angola's 
principal railroad prompted the 
Portuguese in mid-March to suspend 
transit trade which is vital to 
the Congo (Kinshasa) and of im-
portance to Zambia. Insurgents 
based in these countries appar-
ently derailed three trains last 
month along the Benguela Railroad 
in eastern Angola. 
Both the Congo and Zambia 
are economically dependent on 
copper exports, and the Benguela 
Railroad has been the largest 
single carrier for the Congo and 
recently for Zambia. Zambia was 
forced in late March to compromise 
its policy toward the white regime 
in Rhodesia and to revert par-
tially to rail routes through that 
country. The importation of 
needed goods over the Benguela 
Railroad is especially important 
to the Congo's Katanga region, 
and other import routes, including 
the Rhodesian Railways are al-
ready clogged. If the Angolan 
line should remain closed for an 
extended period of time, the 
25X1 
cash economy of Katanga will de-
teriorate sharply and Zambia 
would be faced with the decision 
to set aside its political prin-
ciples and to make fuller use of 
the Rhodesian Railways. 
Lisbon is fed up with the 
private assurances and ambivalent 
policies of the Congo and Zambia 
in the past. The Angolan gov-
ernor general admits that the 
Portuguese may be unable to pre-
vent attacks on the railroad, 
but he is convinced they can ef-
fectively hinder insurgent ac-
tivity. 
Zambia has been most sus-
ceptible to Portuguese pressure 
and has increasingly clamped

NIGERIAN BRINKMANSHIP 
The economic skirmishing be-
tween Nigerian Commander in Chief 
Gowon and Eastern Governor Ojukwu 
has entered a phase of concrete 
but limited moves and countermoves. 
Both seem prepared to continue in 
this vein for some time, although 
there are new indications Ojukwu 
is thinking in terms of ultimate 
independence for his region. 
In partial fulfillment of 
his earlier threat to take con-
trol of revenues generated in 
the region, Ojukwu issued an 
edict on 31 March requesting federal 
revenue collectors in the East 
to pass all payments directly to 
the Eastern government rather 
than to the federal account. 
The edict does not alter the ex-
isting formula for allocating 
revenues among the regions nor 
does it touch the important oil 
revenues, which are mostly paid 
to the federal account in London. 
According to Eastern officials, 
the revenues collected under the 
new edict will be used to pay up 
arrears they claim the federal 
government owes, after which 
they will be remitted to Lagos 
as before. There are reports, 
however, that the edict is merely 
the first step in asserting full 
control over all revenues gener-
ated in the East. 
Thus far the federal govern-
ment's principal reaction to 
Ojukwu's edict has been to halt 
Nigeria Airways flights to the 
East. This move, which Lagos de-
fends on grounds that Ojukwu has 
already sequestered airline rev-
CONTINUES 
enue, will deny him any further 
income from this fairly lucra-
tive source. 
Ojukwu is likely to use the 
flight ban to justify new anti-
federal actions and will consider 
this one more reason why the 
East must operate more independ-
ently. In what may be further 
preparation for moves toward 
eventual secession, Ojukwu is 
appealing to all Ibos--the East's 
major ethnic group--to return 
home. 
It is unlikely that the Su-
preme Military Council would 
formally approve military action 
against Ojukwu or even a total 
economic blockade. Both the 
Western and Mid-Western governors 
have already opposed a proposal 
requiring East-bound shipping to 
call first at Lagos. In what is 
probably a contingency move, how-
ever, federal forces along the 
border between the Eastern and 
Northern regions have been re-
inforced in the past two weeks 
with several hundred men and 
some armored personnel carriers. 
Meanwhile the Ghanaian med-
iators who last January managed 
to arrange a meeting in their, 
country of the feuding Nigerian 
leaders are continuing their ef-
forts. Ojukwu has already agreed 
to another meeting in Ghana. 
Gowon, however, is reportedly re-
luctant but will consult the other 
military governors.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
Inter-American officials as well as various ex-
tremist groups are completing last-minute prepara-
tions for the summit meeting in Uruguay from 12 to 
14 April. 
Most of the foreign ministers and their subor-
dinates assembling in Punta del Este for the foreign 
ministers' conference beginning on 8 April will stay 
on for the meeting of presidents. This preliminary 
meeting--which actually is the final session of the 
talks begun last month in Buenos Aires--has as its 
primary task the drafting of a preamble for the 
declaration to be signed by the presidents. The 
ministers may also make new efforts to come up with 
an acceptable text for an agreement renouncing ac-
quisition of certain costly military equipment. 
It now seems virtually certain that the keenest 
topics for the summit talks will be Latin American 
economic integration and the terms of trade for the 
area's raw material exports. On the former issue, a 
fairly sharp dichotomy remains between nations like 
Brazil and Peru which favor a cautious subregional 
approach to a common market, and others which prefer 
a more rapid, area-wide approach. 
Most official and unofficial Latin American com-
mentary on the eve of the conference--excepting, of 
course, the increasingly shrill Cuban and other ex-
tremist propaganda--reflects a sober but guardedly 
optimistic attitude toward the chances for success. 
Security forces in Uruguay are bracing for more 
protest demonstrations and minor attacks on US prop-
erty. Some Communist-inspired violence during the 
summit seems likely there and perhaps elsewhere but 
should pose no serious threat to the proceedings.

CHILEAN VOTERS REBUFF PRESIDENT FREI 
President Frei did not re-
ceive the vote of confidence he 
had requested from the Chilean 
electorate in the 2 April munici-
pal elections. Piqued by the op-
position-controlled Senate's re-
fusal to permit him to visit the 
US and the failure of his consti-
tutional reform legislation, Frei 
concentrated on the elections for 
the local councilmen. He cam-
paigned vigorously throughout 
the country, urging voters to 
support members of his Christian 
Democratic Party (PDC) as a sign 
of approval of his administra-
tion. 
The election results appear 
to bear out the opposition claims 
that a majority of the population 
opposes the Frei administration. 
The PDC received only 36 percent 
of the votes--a drop from its 42 
percent in the 1965 congressional 
elections--while the Communist-
Socialist Popular Action Front 
increased its total substantially. 
However, the PDC got more than 
twice as many votes as its clos-
est rival and doubled the number 
of municipal posts under its con-
trol. It thus obtained increased 
patronage opportunities and will 
also be able to improve its local 
organization, a well-known PDC 
weakness. 
The PDC's failure to repeat 
the success of its presidential 
and congressional campaigns was 
in part a result of normal dis-
satisfaction with the actions of 
the party in power. Frei's eco-
nomic stabilization program has 
hurt many sectors that are ac-
customed to operating in an in-
flationary situation. Further-
more, Chile historically has had 
a multiparty political system. 
The presidential election of 
1964 presented the Chilean elec-
torate with a choice between 
Frei and the Communist backed 
pro-Castro Socialist Senator 
Salvador Allende. Many middle-
class Chileans, who are essen-
tially conservative, voted for 
Frei as the lesser of two evils, 
and a good deal of his success 
carried over into the congres-
sional elections in 1965. The 
municipal elections, however, 
afforded voters a choice among 
a number of candidates, and 
many returned to the National 
Party, an amalgam of the two 
traditional conservative parties 
Frei's congressional opposi-
tion probably will become more 
intransigent as a result of the 
elections. The left wing of 
the PDC, which has accused the 
government of losing its revo-
lutionary fervor, may attempt to 
capitalize on Frei's setback to 
gain control of the party at its 
national congress later this 
year.

BOLIVIAN GOVERNMENT OVERREACTS TO GUERRILLA ATTACK 
The Bolivian Government, 
shaken by the 23 March guerrilla 
attack on an army patrol near 
the southeastern town of Camiri, 
is hastily attempting to organize 
counterinsurgency operations. 
The military has abandoned 
its earlier idea of confronting 
the guerrillas immediately. Plans 
call for a sustained counterin-
surgency campaign which could 
last for months. Outposts and 
roadblocks are being set up, and 
patrols are being sent out to 
probe for strongholds. A special 
army combat force will be equipped 
and trained to attack the base 
camp at a later date. At pres-
ent there is no unit in the Bo-
livian Army properly trained for 
guerrilla warfare. 
There have been reports of 
limited contact with the guer-
rillas during the past week, but 
no significant clashes have oc-
curred since 23 March. The Iden-
tity of the band is still uncer-
tain, but it seems to be a force 
of 35 to 100 disparate leftist 
elements 
parentlyTh7jambushed army pa-
trol had stumbled onto the guer-
rilla nucleus and forced the band 
into action earlier than the

The guerrilla band a; now

isolated--does not pose a threat 
to the government. If the mili-
tary succeeds in destroyi-ag the 
movement in a relatively ihort 
period of time, Barrientos' im-
age as a leader will be eahanced 
and other extremist group-; will 
be discouraged from atteirroting 
similar actions. Conversly, 
failure to find and defeat the 
guerrillas could give encourage-
ment to the extremists, dissi-
pate military and police (Jun-

tos in a difficult political po-
sition. /

CRACKS IN THE MEXICAN MONOLITH 
Mexico's controlling Insti-
tutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
is in high gear for the 2 July 
election of seven governors and 
all 178 deputies of the national 
assembly. This is the first nation-
wide election since Gustavo Diaz 
Ordaz became president in 1964 
and is an important step in the 
consolidation of his control over 
the country's elaborate political 
machinery. 
The will of the President 
is the main factor in the choice 
of candidates. Although top-level 
posts in the PRI and in the gov-
ernment bureaucracy are filled 
with Diaz Ordaz appointees, most 
of the governors and all of the 
Congress remain from the last 
administration. Some among this 
latter group who are considered 
loyal to Diaz Ordaz will be ele-
vated to high appointive positions 
and will figure heavily in the 
speculation for the 1970 presi-
dential race. 
The indisputable dominance 
of the PRI leaves few questions 
about the outcome of this summer's 
"contest." A few seats in Con-
gress may be captured by minor 
parties, but there are no opposi-
tion candidates for governor. 
Despite the absence of effective 
partisan opposition, dissatisfac-
tion with the PRI, based on the 
ruling party's arbitrary "impo-
sition" of even local candidates, 
is growing among the increasingly 
sophisticated electorate.

Currently dramatizing

in the state of Sonora. Even 
though the 1961 campaign in 
Sonora had been bitterly con-

badly misjudged the depth of 
popular resentment. Students 
who have led the sporadically

So far the party hierarchy 
has indicated no readiness to 
back down in Sonora, and PRI 
selections in the other six states 
have presented no unusual diffi-

President Diaz Ordaz is be-

encouraging constituent rather 
than party selection of candi-

LABOR RESISTANCE TO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT POLICY WEAKENS. 
The Ongania government, ap-
parently convinced that Argen-
tina's disorganized labor move-
ment is temporarily powerless to 
force it to alter its economic 
policies, is imposing new wage 
freezes and price controls in 
its effort to combat inflation. 
Although inflation raised living 
costs about 30 percent last year, 
the government has announced that 
it will limit wage increases 
through 1968 to a range of 8 to 
24 percent, depending on the 
amount of the workers' raises 
during 1966. It is comtemplat-
ing complementary restrictions 
on price increases. 
The labor movement is in 
serious disarray after the defeat 
last month of its "Action Plan" 
for strikes and demonstrations. 
Government pressure forced the 
General Confederation of Labor 
(CGT) to call off the plan. Now 
the COT is trying to resume ne-
gotiations with the government 
similar to those in the early 
months of President Ongania's 
rule. Ongania, however, is un-
likely to be moved by labor 
leaders' continued claims that 
his wage policy will hit the 
lower income worker hardest and 
that the workers are bearing the 
brunt of the government's anti-
inflation policies. 
Various factions within the 
CGT are struggling to gairi con-
trol of the organization. It 
now appears, however, tha_ Peron-
ist moderate Augusto Vandor will 
maintain his hold over th,- CGT 
ruling council. Surprisinaly, 
Vandor has kept the loya17:y and 
support of much of labor despite 
the failure of the "Action Plan" 
for which he was largely -espon-
sible. His main rival, Jose 
Alonso, an orthodox Peron_st 
who did not support the "Action 
Plan," has lost ground in ef-
forts to form a coalition of 
unions to fight Vandor's rtle.
