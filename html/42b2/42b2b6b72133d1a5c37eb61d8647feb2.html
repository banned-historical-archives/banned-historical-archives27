 YUGOSLAVIA - WEST GERMANY:   West German Foreign
 Minister Sc ee   s official visit to Yugoslavia from
 25 to 27 November made good relations between the
 two countries even better.
 Against a backdrop of exceptionally warm press
 coverage,  Scheel and his Yugoslav counterpart, Mirko
 Tepavac, signed an extradition agreement that opens
 the way for West German deportation of Yugoslav
 emigre terrorists currently working out of the
 Federal Republic.   Progress also is being made to-
 ward resolving the most serious problem in bilateral
 relations--German indemnification of Yugoslav World
 War II victims.   It was announced that negotiations
 on this subject will begin soon.
 In the realm of economic relations, the Yugo-
 slavs urged Bonn to accept their assurances that
 capital investments and profits could be repatriated
 if joint ventures earned sufficient foreign exchange
 to cover the amounts sought in repatriation.   Bonn,
 however, held out for guaranteed repatriation re-
 gardless of the foreign exchange position of indi-
 vidual companies.   The two sides agreed to another
 urgent meeting of specialists to resolve the issue,
 which threatens existing joint arrangements.
 I Yugoslav offi-
 c    s are pleased with    e outcome of the talks.
 For its part, Bonn appears motivated by a desire
 to demonstrate to other East European states the
 benefits which can flow from a normalizatif n of
 relations.

 FRANCE-POLAND:   The visit to Warsaw last week
 of Premier Chaban-Delmas and Foreign Minister Schu-
 mann appears to have restored the good relations
 existing between the two countries prior to the 1968
 events in Czechoslovakia.
 This was probably the intent of the French in
 making the trip, and the Poles responded with a red-
 carpet welcome.                      At the same time Paris once again
 demonstrated its tendency to go its own way in pur-
 suing relations with Communist countries, as it had
 previously with President Pompidou's trip to Moscow
 and Planning Minister Bettencourt's visit to Peking.
 The Poles clearly wanted, and obtained, a French
 statement of satisfaction with the German-Polish
 treaty,  and a reiteration of French de facto recog-
 nition of the Oder-Neisse boundary as an "indisput-
 able and irreversible fact."   The visit also gave
 Warsaw an opportunity to stress that its political
 and economic policy toward Western Europe is not
 wholly focused on relations with West Germany.
 Despite Polish pressures, the French visitors
 held to the position taken by Pompidou in Moscow
 that Paris would support only a "properly prepared"
 conference on European security and only following
 substantial progress on the Berlin negotiations and
 ratification of the West German - Soviet nonaggres-
 sion pact.
 In the realm of bilateral activities, the two
 countries agreed to develop "political cooperation"
 through regular consultations with the purpose of
 eventually coordinating initiatives.   They also dis-
 cussed development of closer economic, cultural, and
 scientific-technological ties.
 The three top Polish party leaders--Gomulka,
 President Spychalski, and Premier Cyrankiewicz--
 acce ted an invitation to visit France.

 ALBANIA-YUGOSLAVIA:   Improvement in relations
 continues despite persisting major ideological and
 nationalistic differences.
 The 25th anniversary of the Yugoslav republic
 and the conclusion of an annual bilateral trade pro-
 tocol last week provided both sides the opportunity
 to demonstrate anew the gradual thawing of hostile
 attitudes begun in late 1968.   Commenting on the
 Yugoslav holiday, Tirana glossed over outstanding
 issues and, in a tone not noted in over 20 years,
 stressed the unity and common experience of the two
 peoples.  The theme of the commentary was in line
 with a milestone speech by Albanian party chief
 Hoxha last May and a Tirana statement on the 29th
 anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in
 April.   Answering recent Yugoslav allegations of a
 Tirana-Sofia detente at Belgrade's expense, Tirana
 reassured the Yugoslavs that they continue to have
 a friend in Albania, which. regards  "their enemies
 as enemies of the Albanian people."
 The trade protocol for 1971 was signed in Bel-
 grade on 26 November.   For the first time both coun-
 tries agreed to long-term economic consultations
 running from 1971 to 1975.   The Albanian delegation
 was given VIP treatment by Belgrade, including a
 tour of the Romanian-Yugoslav Iron Gates hydroelec-
 tric project on the Danube River.   The Yugoslavs
 have desired closer ties with Albania, but have in-
 dicated that further improvements must come at Tir-
 ana's initiative;  apparently Albania is cautiousl
 moving in this direction.

 COMMUNIST CHINA:      The regime's intention to
 place military officers in key central government
 positions has recently been confirmed.
 A Peking NCNA broadcast on 28 November report-
 ing the departure of a government delegation for
 Mauritania identified delegation head Sha Feng as
 "minister of agriculture and forestry."  Sha, who
 previously had been identified as an officer in
 the Armor Corps, is the first army man to be of-
 ficially confirmed as a ministry head since the
 Cultural Revolution.  Another military officer was
 recently named a vice minister in the same ministry.
 These appointments reinforce other evidence that
 military officers will play a major role in the
 management of China's post - Cultural Revolution
 central government hierarchy.
 In most ministries the principal decision-
 making authority over the past four years has in
 fact rested with military commissions that assumed
 control early in the Cultural Revolution.   But,
 there have been signs that the leadership in Peking
 is divided over the precise extent of the army's
 future participation in government and party af-
 fairs.                      In all likelihood, a mixed picture will
 emerge, with some ministries headed by "rehabili-
 tated" civilian cadre and others by relatively in-
 experienced military officers such as Sha?
 Sha has been put in charge of a new ministry
 that came about with the merger of the formerly
 separate ministries of agriculture and forestry.
 It is one of five new supra-ministries formed over
 the past year or so by combining the functions of
 two and sometimes three ministries.   Officially,
 this program is inspired by Mao Tse-tung's long-
 expressed desire to consolidate and streamline the
 top-heavy central government bureaucracy, which
 was made up of some 40 ministries and 12 commis-
 sions before the Cultural Revolution.   Judging by

 developments thus far, it seems likely that even
 further cutbacks will be disclosed when the regime
 finally convenes its long-delayed National People's
 Congress--the governmental counterpart to the party
 congress held last year.
 Despite the streamlining at the top, however,
 the regime has been less successful in reducing the
 number of subordinate staff officers necessary to
 keep the central government machinery working.
 Since October 1960 some 15 persons have been identi-
 fied as leading members of the newly amalgamated
 Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, including
 five former civilian vice ministers.  This figure
 roughly approximates the number of top-level exec-
 utives who were assigned to these functions prior
 to the Cultural Revolution.

 PAKISTAN:   President Yahya Khan, at a press
 conference on 27 November, sought to defuse a poten-
 tially explosive situation in East Pakistan.
 Tension had been increasing there as East Pak-
 istani politicians attacked the government for al-
 leged mishandling of cyclone relief, threatened dire
 consequences if the military government used the
 cyclone as an excuse for postponing coming elections,
 and continued their agitation for much greater pro-
 vincial autonomy.
 Although Yahya's defense of the relief effort
 was somewhat weak, he probably mitigated future crit-
 icism by announcing a $180-million rehabilitation
 program.
 Elections are to be postponed in the nine con-
 stituencies most severely hit by the cyclone, but
 Yahya apparently calmed leading politicians by
 strongly reaffirming that contests for the remainder
 of the 300 National Assembly seats will be held as
 scheduled on 7 December.   Nevertheless, small,  left-
 ist parties--some of which do not want elections
 under any conditions--are continuing to call for new
 antigovernment demonstrations.
 Yahya supported the long-standing East Paki-
 stani demand for greater provincial autonomy.                                He
 qualified his support, however, by adding that the
 constitution to be drafted by the soon-to-be-elected
 National Assembly must ensure the "integrity, safety,
 and securit  of the country" or martial law will
 continue.

 CHILE:   The Communist Party is publicly boast-
 ing of its major role in the Allende government.
 The speech of secretary general Luis Corvalan
 at a plenum of the Chilean Communist Party  (PCCh)
 last week attests to the strong Communist influence
 in the policies adopted by Allende's Popular Unity
 (UP)  coalition government.   Corvalan cited economic
 and other measures already taken as proof that the
 month-old Allende administration is  "of and for the
 masses."  He warned that stubborn "imperialism and
 oligarchy" must be eradicated from all centers of
 Chilean economic power and hailed the Cuban revolu-
 tion as the beginning of an historic process in
 Latin America.
 Corvalan emphasized that the six parties that
 make up the UP must continue to cooperate and said
 that Allende's election was a triumph for the UP
 rather than a personal one.   In welcoming the Presi-
 dent to the plenum, Corvalan indicated that the
 PCCh relies on him and the powers at his command to
 carry out the revolution that will transform Chile
 into a "popular state."   In his remarks Allende an-
 nounced that he will submit legislation this week
 that would nationalize copper and private banks and
 insurance companies,  and end monopolies.
 Corvalan's speech implies PCCh leaders are now
 confident that anti-Communist opposition in Chile
 is weak and that they no longer need to be cautious
 in their exercise of political power.   It also indi-
 cates that the PCCh wants to assert its importance
 in the UP and claim credit for the initial successes
 of the Allende administration as it prepares for the
 municipal elections scheduled for next April.

 Pravda's account of Corvalan's speech portrays
 the PCCh in a more militant and revolutionary light
 than previous Soviet press commentary.  Heretofore
 the PCCh has been pictured as a reasonable partner
 in a coalition having wide appeal.   This suggests
 that the USSR is not so worried about possible US
 and internal Chilean reactions to greater Soviet
 attention to the PCCh.

 NICARAGUA:       Negotiations between the government
 and the major opposition party concerning the coun-
 try's political future are now under way.
 President Somoza and Fernando Aguero, the
 leader of the opposition Conservative Party, agreed
 last Friday that the scheduled 1972 general election
 would not be held.   Instead, at the end of Somoza's
 term,  a transitional government elected by a con-
 stituent assembly would be instituted for a period
 of perhaps two or three years.   The details of elec-
 toral and governmental reform will be worked out in
 subsequent meetings.
 Aguero's primary objectives are to ensure that
 Somoza steps down in 1972 and to gain for his party
 a more substantial role in the government.   The pro-
 posed plan also satisfies Somoza's political ambi-
 tions because it allows him to continue as head of
 the armed forces and to run for the presidency after
 the transitional government.
 Leaders of other political factions will un-
 doubtedly criticize any accord and characterize
 Aguero's action as a sellout to Somoza.   Aguero, who
 may aspire to head the transitional government, is
 unlikely to be sidetracked, however, and chances of
 an agreement are fairly good.

 NOTES
 USSR - EAST GERMANY:   Soviet party chief Brezh-
 nev reportedly is scheduled to arrive today in East
 Berlin for the impending summit meeting of Warsaw
 Pact countries.   Press sources in East Berlin con-
 sider it likely that he will conduct private talks
 with the East German leaders before the full summit
 begins.   The meeting is expected to deal with the
 coordination of bloc policy toward Bonn,  a matter
 which most directly affects the interests of East
 Germany and the USSR.   Both countries may be anxious
 to resolve any differences between them before the
 arrival of other bloc leaders.   TASS announced yes-
 terday that the Pact meeting would take place this
 week in East Berlin, but did not give a date;  some
 East European sources have said the meeting will
 begin on 2 December.
 ARGENTINA:   Urban terrorists have focused their
 operations on US personnel with increasing frequency
 since the fire-bombing of the defense attache's home
 in October.   The forced entry into the homes of three
 US military personnel last Friday came only a week
 after bombs were placed at the homes of two other US
 officials.    No one was injured Friday, but the ter-
 rorists made off with arms, uniforms, and identity
 documents.    Many US officials live in the outlying
 suburbs of Buenos Aires where police protection is
 minimal, increasing the likelihood of additional and
 more serious incidents.
 C CAMBODIA:   The explosion in the US Embassy early
 today was the most dramatic Communist action in Phnom
 Penh to date, and the first targeted against the
 American presence.   It may signal the onset of an
 intensified Communist terrorist campaign in the cap-
 ital.   No US personnel were injured in the blast,
 which reportedly was caused by a large plastic charge
 possibly planted by a local laborer in a section of
 the embassy now being renovated.

 LAOS:   Communist forces in the vicinity of Ban
 Ban have so far offered little resistance to the
 seven battalions of government troops that have en-
 tered the area since 27 November.  The 1,000-man
 irregular force which was airlifted into positions
 south of Ban Ban has advanced to within two miles
 of its immediate objective at San Tiau, but is moving
 slowly because of poor weather.  An additional 850
 government troops  (three battalions)  from Bouam Long
 have moved into positions about four miles north of
 the Ban Ban valley and have had only scattered con-
 tact with enemy forces.   Like the government units
 to the south,  these battalions intend to attack Com-
 munist logistic assets in the Ban Ban area, but will
 be withdrawn of er their primary missions have been
 accomplished.
 CONGO  (BRAZZAVILLE):   The power struggle be-
 tween President Ngouabi and his extreme leftist
 partners continues and a showdown is possible before
 the year's end.   In October Ngouabi moved to shore
 up his weak position by agreeing to cooperate closely
 with Kinshasa President Mobutu.  Last week he suc-
 ceeded in reinstating a tribal brother as army chief
 of staff.   The radicals, in turn, have arranged the
 demotion of Vice President Raoul--a Ngouabi sup-
 porter--to the fourth position in the government
 after the President and the two top party extrem-
 ists.  They also are taking steps to buttress the
 radical component of the armed forces stationed in
 the capital.   The leftists may fear that the sched-
 uled restoration of diplomatic and unrestricted
 commercial relations with Kinshasa in mid-December
 25X1
 will
 greatly
 strengthen Ngouabi's hand.   This view
 could
 impel
 them to move directly against the Pres-
 ident soon.

 CONGO  (KINSHASA):   President Mobutu has named
 a senior officer to act as army commander for Com-
 mander in Chief Bobozo, who suffered a severe stroke
 on 13 November.   The officer, Major General Bosango,
 was named only the acting commander, thus averting,
 at least temporarily, serious dissension among army
 officers.   Bosango is regarded by many younger offi-
 cers as incompetent and cowardly, but they reportedly
 believe that Mobutu will choose a better man as the
 permanent commander in chief if Bobozo is not able
 to resume active duty.  Protracted delay in choosing
 a permanent commander could, however, intensify long-
 standing rivalries among senior officers and eventu-
 ally reopen latent tribal and regional factionalism
 among all ranks.
