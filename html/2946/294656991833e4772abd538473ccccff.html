 NATURE REFOR24 IN CHINA'S RURAL VILLAGE
 - The Ta-chai-Type Farmland Construction -
 At present in China, in anticipation of the third five-year
 plan to begin next year, the development of agricultural production
 and the building of the socialist new rural village are rising to a
 new height.  A model in the construction of the socialist new rural
 village is the Ta-chai big brigade in southern Shansi.  Z??ith their
 own hands, the members of the big brigade have made the great
 achievement of transforming the appearance of the impoverished moun-
 tain village and increasing the grain output to eight times that of
 before the liberation.  The experience in nature reform and farmland
 construction of this unknown village is being introduced in the en-
 tire nation as a model in the building of the socialist new rural
 village; a great movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass
 Ta-chai is underway; the path followed by Ta-chai is blossoming forth
 everywhere; the second, third, etc. Ta-chai's have appeared succes-
 sively.
 Beginning 1 November, the National Ta-chai-Type Agricultural
 Model Exhibition was held in the Peiping Agricultural Exhibit Hall,
 and the superior farmland construction experiences of 52 units from
 28 provinces and municipalities (8 people's communes, 21 big bri-
 gades, 1 production brigade, 1 cooperative team, 2 districts, 13
 hsien, 4 special districts, and 2 municipalities) were introduced.
 The exhibition received the direct concern of the Chinese Communist
 Party Central Committee and the State Council.  After the inaugura-
 tion ceremony, party and state leaders such as Chou En-lai, Chu Teh,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Tung Pi-wu, P'eng Chen, Ch'en Yi, Li Fu-ch'un, Li
 Hsien-nien, T'an Chen-lin (6223 7201 2651), Po I-po (5631 0001 313Lt),
 Lu Ting-i (7120 1353 0001), Ch' en Pai-ta (7115 4101 6671), and K' ang
 Sheng (1660 3932) came successively to view the exhibits.
 To congratulate the holding of the National Ta-chai-Type
 Agricultural Model Exhibition, the neople's Daily of 1 November drew
 attention to its significance in an editorial, pointing out that "the
 Ta-chai spirit is a tremendous motive power to promote our rural
 class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation,
 and accelerate the construction of the socialist new rural village."
 It then went   on to say:
 "The successive appearance of large numbers of Ta-chai-type
 advanced agricultural units in all areas in the nation is producing a
 great promoting and encouraging influence on the further development

 of the compare-learn-catch up-help-surpass movement on the agricul-
 tural front.  As a whole, the foundation of our agriculture is still
 shallow, the output level not high, and the resistance to natural
 disasters not strong.  Is it possible for us to change this condition
 within not too long a period of time?  It is perfectly possible...
 By developing the Ta-chai spirit, mobilizing the socialist positivity
 of the large peasantry, relying on their own two hands, and adding
 state aid thereto, it will be possible to further promote our farm
 capital construction, develop our agricultural  '4-ization'-(mechani-
 zation, water conservation, chemicalization, and electrification),
 strengthen our resistance to natural disasters, improve our agricul-
 tural technical level, and construct  more stable and high yield
 farms . "
 The following is an introduction of the farm capital construc-
 tion experiences of the Ta-chai big brigade and others following its
 steps.
 The People ofv-  -chai who Turned Rocky Mountains into Fertile Farms
 As a deserted village in Hsi-yang hsien, Shansi, situated on
 the T'ai-hang Mountain ranges  more than 1,000 meters above sea level,
 Ta-chai suffered from extreme poverty before the liberation.  Its
 name was unknown beyond the villages in its vicinity.  The 800 mou of
 farmland of the village was scattered in 4,700 plots on mountain
 ridges and hillsides.  Some places were so narrow that even mules
 could hardly turn around.  The topsoil was shallow, and it was consi-
 dered good when.the mou grain output reached 50 Kg.
 The people of Ta-chai realized production cooperativization in
 1952.   By the fall of 1953, the "Ten-Year Land Construction Plan" was
 formulated.  By their own effort, they began the great enterprise of
 turning poverty into wealth.  The plan was completed in 1962, one year
 ahead of schedule.  Under the plan, the people of Ta-chai, with their
 own two hands and hoes and carrying poles, dug out the mountain rocks,
 scraped the soil on the hillsides, turned the 4,700 plots of barren
 land into 2,900 terraced fields, and built 170 dikes at seven deep
 gullies to control flood.  In agricultural technique, by successive
 experiments and reforms, they discovered close planting as a means
 suitable for the area.  By such farmland construction and close
 planting, the grain output rose rapidly.  The mou output increased
 from the 237 catties of 1952 to 543 catties in 1958, which again jump-
 ed to 774 catties in 1962.                     In spite of the unprecedented downpours
 in 1963, a good harvest was reaped.  The output rose to 809 catties
 in 1964.  With rocks and earth, the people built terrace fields, with
 the terraces about half of a man's height.  Large rocks weighing be-
 tween 50 and 100 Kg had to be carried from the foothills to the moun-
 tain top.                         It was a task requiring a tremendous labor.  As the top-
 soil of the hillsides was shallow, earth had to be carried from the

 foothills also.  Besides, as the soil of some areas was clayish while
 that of others sandy, it had to be skilfully improved before utiliza-
 tion.
 With carrying poles, hoes, and baskets, the people of Ta-chai
 pared off half of the mountains, moved the large rocks one by one,
 and built level terrace farms on the hillsides and mountain tops.
 Though no stream is available for irrigation, the soil can store rain
 water and serve as natural "dams," since all the farms now have over
 30 cm of topsoil which can absorb water.
 Ta-chai has seven deep gullies.  While they were usually dry,
 heavy rainfall would form a flood and damage the 200 mou of farmland
 alongside them.  The village people considered building stone dikes
 to control the flood.  However, it was a tremendous task.  "The moun-
 tain is great and the gullies deep, and our village has only 50 labor
 force.  How long will it take to do the job?..." was a remark of some
 who hesitated when work'first started.  However, party branch secre-
 tary Chlen Yung-kuei (7115 3057 6311) flatly declared:  "Even if the
 mountain is greater and the gullies deeper, if it is tackled one by
 one, there is no reason for us not to succeed.  If three years are
 insufficient, make it five; if five years are insufficient, let us
 persevere for ten years.  If we persevere, we will surely succeed."
 Every year, in winter time, the people of Ta-chai carried ham-
 mers and levers to the gullies.  Nevertheless, when they came to the
 Lang-wo-chang gully, their final test, they failed repeatedly.  This
 gully is about 1.5 Km long and 7 m wide.  In rain season, the moun-
 tain torrent would run wild like a reinless horse.  At the beginning,
 25 stone dikes were built, but they were washed away in the next sum-
 mer by flood.  Undiscouraged, the village people again set out to
 conquer the gully.  With greater care than before, they rebuilt the
 dikes, but these were again swept away without a trace by a flood more
 severe than the previous year.
 The flood washed the dikes away, but it could not dampen the
 revolutionary fervor of the Ta-chai people.  Learning the lessons of
 failure, they planned the task for the third time.  The usual method
 was to partition close alongside the gully and build dikes.  After
 discovering that such dikes were inadequate to check the water, this
 time they built the dikes in form of arches.  They also selected
 small rocks and reenforced them with concrete, and increased the
 number of dikes to 32.  The rocks required for the project were
 quarried from the mountains.  The construction this time withstood
 dozens of floods successfully.
 A total of over 180 dikes were built for the seven gullies
 totalling 7.5 Km.  More than 100,000 labor force were poured into the
 construction of the dikes and terrace fields.
 The people of Ta-chai also   repeatedly experimented on and im-
 proved their cultivation methods.  The leaders created experimental
 farms according to the different types of soil and crops, demonstrated

 by concrete examples, and introduced the superior methods among the
 commune members.  Every one knew that close planting was a good me-
 thod.  However, what should be the extent of such close planting?
 The farmland, being narrow, was unsuitable for machine cultivatio
 but the village people discovered that it constituted a favorable
 factor for close planting because of the evenly distributed sunlight
 and good ventilation.  They experimented according to the soil and
 the terrain, instead of purposeless uniform close planting, and
 finally found the method suitable for Ta-chai.  They discovered that,
 for the corn crop, 1,600 to 2,200 plants per mou, according to the
 area, could be cultivated, whereas before, 1,000 plants per mou was
 considered numerous.  On the same piece of land, more were planted
 near the edge, where the sunlight and ventilation were good, than in
 the middle.  Close planting became the major means of Ta-chai's corn
 output increase, and the mou output increased to 401. Kg, which was
 eight times the 50 Kg before the liberation.  Thus, by self-revitali-
 zation, Ta-chai has produced an example of turning an impoverished
 mountain village into a socialist new rural village.
 "The Flower of Ta-chai" - Meng Hsien
 Shansi's Meng hsien is a national model in learning the expe-
 rience and spirit of Ta-chai and building Ta-chai-type farms generally
 in all areas of the hsien.
 Located in the western part of the T'ai-hang Ranges, Meng
 hsien is surrounded by mountains on all sides.  Those on its north
 are specially steep, around 1,500 m above sea level, and even the
 lowest spots are around 700 m.  Mountainous land constitutes 70% of
 the hsien.  Sixty-percent of the 500,000 mou of farmland of the hsien
 is found on mountain ridges and hillsides and in ravines, mostly with
 only around 2 ts'un [1 ts'un = 1.2 inches] of topsoil.  To change the
 appearance of the impoverished mountain village, the people of Meng
 hsien, several years ago, launched large scale farmland and water
 conservation construction twice and produced considerable results.
 However, as they were short of experience at that time, the construc-
 tion work did not develop its full effect, and portions of it were
 swept away by flood.  The development of agricultural production was
 not rapid.  For example, the food grain output of the hsien was
 80,680,000 catties in 1957, and the annual average for the five years
 between 1958 and 1962 was 91,290,000 catties.  Thus, the annual aver-
 age rate of increase was only 2.62%.
 In May of 1963, the Chinese Communist Central Meng hsien com-
 mission called an expanded meeting to discuss "why Meng hsien's
 agricultural development is slow" and "what is the basic means to
 change its appearance?"  The conclusion was to learn the experience
 of Ta-chai.  Thus, in the years of 1963 and 1964, relying on the
 power of the collective economy built in the past ten years and their

 own strength, the people vigorously launched farmland construction.
 In the winter of 1963, they began.over 170 mountain control projects
 on the mountain ridges and  sides, :over 300 dike projects in ravines,
 and thousands and tens of thousands of soil preparation and land ad-
 justment tasks, and undertook the foundational work of dozens of
 dikes.  Between the first month and the end of the fifth month of the
 moon calendar in 1964, 26 large dikes, totalling more than 1,500 m,
 were built, 101 ravines and 122 small ravines, totalling 120 li, regu-
 lated, 4,200 mou of farmland on mountain ridges and hillsides reform-
 ed, and 7,500 mou of farmland in ravines prepared.  In the five-month
 period alone, 40,000 persons were mobilized totalling 910,000 labor
 units, and 30, 000 m3 of rocks and 300,000 m- of earth transported.
 From the winter of 1964 to the spring of 1965, a large scale farmland
 capital construction was advanced and 101,000 mou of Ta-chai-type
 farmland completed.  In the two years, the building of Ta-chai-type
 farmland totalled 197,000 mou.  As a result, the grain output of Meng
 hsien greatly increased.  From the annual average of 91,290,000 cat-
 ties between 1958 and 1962, it rose to 110,400,000 in 1963, and
 132,000,000 catties in 1964.
 As an advanced model in emulating Ta-chai by its flourishing.
 farmland construction and the building of the socialist new rural
 village, Meng hsien is extolled as "the flower of Ta-chai."
 The Hsia-ting-chia Big Brigade - the "Ta-chai" of Shantung
 With the spirit of self-revitalization and arduous struggle,
 the Hsia-ting-chia big brigade of the Ta-lu-chia people's commune,
 Huang hsien, Shantung, devoted its effort to the reform of nature.
 Beginning in the winter of 1955, they launched water conservation,
 soil preparation, and afforestation, and turned more than 1,600 mou
 of barren land into stable and high yield farms.  Since 1958, the mou
 grain output was stabilized at 800 catties (400 Kg) or more, and the
 1964 output reached 920 catties (460 Kg), thus far surpassing the 250
 Kg goal set for areas north of the Yellow River in the 12-Year Na-
 tional Agricultural Development Outline of 1956.
 Hsia-ting-chia, a mountain village in the ClLiao-tung Peninsula
 in Shantung, consists of eight. small settlements scattered in the
 valley along the shores of the Yung-wen River.  It has a population
 of 2,695 in 560 households.  Three-quarters of its 2,368 mou of farm-
 land are located on hillsides 700 m above sea level, and the remainder
 is all sandy soil mixed with pebbles on river banks.  The water level
 of the Yung-wen River is more than 20 m below the banks.  Being poor,
 the mountain village had no funds to utilize the water for irrigation,
 and the people could only watch the water flowing by.  The area suf-
 fered from drought nine years out of ten, and the mou grain output
 before the liberation did not exceed 50 Kg or thereabout.

 By the spring of 1957, after the liberation, 20 irrigation
 wells were dug, but each well could irrigate at most only 5 or 6 mou.
 Thus, they decided to utilize the water of the Yung-wen River.  In
 the fall of 1957, they began dam construction.  In 1958, a 50 m long
 and 5 m wide dam was completed, and the problem of irrigating the 200
 mou of land on the two shores solved.  However, the irrigation pro-
 blem of the hillside land, which constituted three-quarters of the
 farmland, was still unsolved.  To irrigate the hillside land, reser-
 voirs, pumping stations, and irrigating ditches must be constructed.
 If a reservoir was built on the top of the mountain, it could only
 gather 5,000 m3 of water.  To solve this problem, on-site investiga-
 tion and planning were carried out repeatedly, and they decided on
 the new method of blocking the flow and gathering the water on the
 east and west mountains together by an irrigation ditch.  By so doing,
 the water volume of the reservoir could be doubled, and an increase
 from 5,000 m3 to 12,000 m3 became possible.  The mountain top reser-
 voir was completed in 1963.  From the foothills to the summit, three
 reservoirs at different levels were completed, and an irrigation sys-
 tem unseen anywhere else formed.  All the terrace farms on the moun-
 tain land were watered by irrigation ditches.  The people of the com-
 mune proudly call the three reservoirs a "three-story building."
 Besides building 1 dam, 4 reservoirs, 14 dikes, 2 pumping sta-
 tions, and over 150 wells in a little over 8 years, the people of
 Hsia-ting-chia also dug 6 irrigation ditches (totalling over 5 Km).
 As a result, the stable and high yield irrigated area was expanded
 from the 400 mou of before to over 1,400 mou, and water conservation
 construction was completed on 580 of the farmland.
 While pursuing water conservation construction since the es-
 tablishment of the people's commune in 1958, the people of Hsia-ting-
 chia began large scale farmland preparation.  The mountain land was
 turned into terrace farms, stone walls built, ground levelled, top-
 soil added, 1,500 mou of barren and sandy soil_ reformed into fertile
 fields, and soil improvement completed on 65% of all the cultivated
 land.
 In addition, trees were planted on bare mountains, water
 sources protected by banning lumbering where the topsoil was shallow,
 and orchards created in ravines and low land where cultivation was
 not suitable though the topsoil was deep.
 Together with such farming method improvement as rational
 close planting, selection of superior seeds, and additional fertili-
 zer, the farm output increased every year.  While the mou grain out-
 put before the liberation was not more than 50 Kg, it was stabilized
 at 400 Kg since the communization of 1958, and rose to 460 Kg in
 1964.   In the seven years since 1958, the Hsia-ting-chia big brigade
 sold to the state 2,920,000 catties (1,460 t' of commercial food
 grain, 380,000 catties (190 t) of oil and fat raw material, and
 4,780,000 catties (2,390 t) of fruits.  Now the big brigade has in

 reserve over 70,000 catties (35 t) of surplus grain, averaging 120
 catties per household, and its public reserve totals over 260,000
 yuan.
 The Flu-shen-chao Commune of Inner Mongolia - the "Ta-chai"of the
 Livestock Area                        -
 "Ta-chai" has even appeared in the desert of the Inner Mongolia
 Autonomous Region.  It is the Wu-shen-chao people's commune of Wu-shen
 ch'i in the Mao-wu-su desert situated in the southeast part of the
 Ordos Plateau.
 More than half of the 1,400 Km2 of the area of this commune
 was sandy.  Though the remaining portion was called grassy plains,
 they were actually waste land where the grass grew only sparsely.  In
 addition, damp alkali spots, hard sandy hills, and stagnate pools
 dotted the land.  The area suffered from sand, drought, submergence,
 hail, parasites, and poison weeds.  For this reason, the population
 was small, only 2,800 persons in 705 households.
 The people of the commune, by their own hands, have reformed
 admirably the inferior natural conditions.  In the past 8 years, they
 have planted grass and trees in the desert and created pastures of
 thick and luxuriant grass in the 60,000 mou of sandy land.  Where
 there was not even one tree before, 200,000 have been planted.  In
 addition, 6 drainage and irrigation ditches, totalling more than 50
 li, have been dug in low lying pastures to prevent submergence and
 flood.  Before, as the livestock in this area drank dirty stagnate
 water, they were subject to parasites.  Now, more than 450 wells have
 been dug, and the livestock are supplied with pure drinking water.
 In the old days, the herdsmen of the area had no experience in
 farming, but now they own 3,300 mou of irrigated farmland.  In the
 past several years, 700,000 to 800,000 catties (350-400 t) of food
 grain and feed have been harvested every year, and the people are
 70% self-sufficient in food grain and feed.
 As a result of the grassy plain construction, the commune's
 livestock has increased from the 49,000 heads of 8 years ago to
 82,000.  In addition, it has sold to the state 30,000 heads of domes-
 tic animals, 400,000 catties (200,000 Kg) of sheepwool, and 40,000
 pieces of hides.  The 1964 income per capita almost tripled that of
 1958.
 The Hsin-wu Big Brigade which Turned Alkali Soil into Fertile Farms
 An "alkali nest" until 9 years ago, the Hsin-wu big brigade,
 San-ts'ang people's commune, Tung-t'ai hsien, Kiangsu, has become
 a "treasury of grain and cotton," and accomplished a tremendous
 change in its production.
 Until 9 years ago, 1,200 mou of its 2,800 mou of farmland

 Approved For Release 2003/12/22 : CIA-RDP78-04546AO03200030002-4
 suffered from a high alkaline content.  Even in good years, the mou
 output of grain was only 100 to 200 catties (50 - 100 Kg), and of
 cotton, 20 to 30 catties.
 The big brigade started soil improvement.  Between 1956 and
 1958, it dug three large drainage ditches measuring a total of more
 than 10 li, 87 small drainage ditches, and 87 ponds, built 22 flood-
 gates and 12 bridges, and devoted its effort to the removal of alkali.
 As a result, the alkaline content in the soil was reduced from .23%
 to .18%.  To further reduce the alkaline content and turn the barren
 land into fertile soil, green fertilizer crops were planted.  At pre-
 sent, 2,500 mou out of the 2,800 mou  have become fertile soil suit-
 able for food grain and cotton, and the alkaline content does not ex-
 ceed .2% in any of the farms.  The 1964 mou grain output was 691
 catties (345.1 Kg) and the mou cotton output, 179 catties (89.5 Kg).
 The area is known as a high yield hsien in Kiangsu province.
 The foregoing is an introduction of a few advanced units in
 nature reform and farmland construction in China's rural villages.
 If the North China Region is taken as an illustration, the measures
 for such nature reform and farmland construction may be generalized
 under    -four classifications:  (1)  Ta-chai-type terrace farms,
 (2) garden farms, (3) platform farms, and (I') forestry network ridge
 farms.
 (1)  Ta-chai-type terrace farms:  The building of level terrace
 farms on hillsides in farmland construction is the measure adopted by
 the Ta-chai big brigade, Ta-chai people's commune, Hsi-yang hsien,
 Shansi, described in the beginning of this article.  The soil is turn-
 ed fertile by the "three-deep" cultivation method (deep plowing, deep
 seeding, and deep mid-plowing), and ample water, moisture, and ferti-
 lizer.  Farms of this type are called "Ta-chai farms," and the expe-
 rience has been introduced in some of the mountain areas in North
 China.
 (2)  Garden farms:  The building of garden farms is one of the
 measures of farmland construction in the vast North China plains.  By
 combining irrigation and drainage, land levelling, tree planting
 around the edges, deep plowing, ample fertilizing, and the use of
 superior seeds, such farms can withstand drought and flood and yield
 a stable and greater output.  Hopeh's Shih-chia-chuang special dis-
 trict in Peiping's suburbs and Shansi's Ta-ku hsien possess fairly
 mature experiences in the construction of such garden farms.
 (3)  Platform farms:  This is a measure for farmland construc-
 tion in low and humid coastal areas where the alkaline content in the
 soil is high.  The earth is heaped high, the water level lowered by
 draining ditches, and the alkaline content removed.  A sample of the
 building of platform farms is the Tung-chia-hua-yuan big brigade,
 Nan-ch'en-t'un people's commune, Tsang-chou, Hopeh.  The 40 mou of
 platform farm built by it on waste alkaline land has withstood down-
 pours of 700 to 800 mm and produced good grain crops.

 (14)  Forestry network ridge farms:  This is the measure adopted
 for farmland construction in wind and sand areas.  Together with irri-
 gation, windbreak forestry belts are built to resist wind, stabilize
 the sand, and reform barren land into fertile soil.  Wind and sand
 areas are found in no small numbers in the North China Region.  The
 farmland of such areas suffers from escape of water and fertilizer,
 spring drought, low survival rate of seedlings, and extreme low yield
 ever since ancient times.  The Tang-p'u-ti big brigade, Tang-p'u-ti
 commune, Ch'ih-feng hsien, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is one
 of the advanced units in the construction of forestry network ridge
 farms.  In the past 15 years, the big brigade has removed over two
 million m3 of shifting sand, planted windbreak forests, improved the
 soil, built dams, dug wells, turned the sandy land into fertile soil,
 and increased the grain output (196!4) to 6 times that of before the
 liberation.          .
 14hile the concrete, measures for farmland capital construction
 and stable and high yield farms now in progress in China's rural
 villages vary according to the area and the unit, the following are
 the three common characteristics.  One is to develop the Ta-chai spi-
 rit and advance by the people's own effort according to the principle
 of self-revitalization.  Two is to adopt comprehensive measures, in-
 cluding soil improvement, water conservation, and afforestation.  The
 third characteristic is, on the foundation of over-all planning and by
 concentrating forces, to combine the leadership cadres, technicians,
 and the people (the "three-combine"), formulate plans in the sphere
 of the entire hsien or entire commune, concentrate the manpower and
 material, introduce the improvement measures one by one according to
 the need and the feasibility, produce results in the year when a mea-
 sure is introduced, and avoid extending the construction period and
 waste.
