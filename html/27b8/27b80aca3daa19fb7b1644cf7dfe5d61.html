 Communist Insurgency in the
 Philippines: Organization
 and Capabilities
 Key Judgments       The Communist insurgency in the Philippines now presents a formidable
 I~tf'ormation available   challenge to the Marcos government and US strategic and political
 as of 30 May 1985         interests in Asia. Moreover, the insurgency is capable of growing more
 was used in this report.
 rapidly in the next two years than at anytime in the past. The Communist
 Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its military arm, the New People's
 Army (NPA), have seized the initiative in the countryside and are
 preparing to bring their revolution to Manila. The insurgents have not,
 however, been seriously contested militarily or politically by the govern-
 ment. This absence of sustained counterinsurgent pressure has allowed the
 Communists a free hand in many areas of the country and has left their po-
 tential vulnerabilities unexploited.
 Party leaders are pursuing a dual military and political strategy aimed at
 achieving a stalemate on the battlefield while forming a broad political
 alliance with the anti-Marcos opposition. The party is in a strong position
 to gain politically from the malaise now prevalent throughout Philippine
 society and the government's unwillingness to undertake political and
 economic reforms. Party leaders hope to seize power by joining with the
 moderate opposition in amost-Marcos coalition government they intend to
 dominate. To this end, they plan to participate in the 1986 nationwide
 elections and support candidates whom they can co-opt.
 The Communists have assembled an extensive and sophisticated clandes-
 tine political/military organization over the last 16 years that is waging
 protracted guerrilla war along 56 to 60 fronts nationwide, effectively
 controlling villages inhabited by at least 5 million people, and contesting
 control of villages inhabited by another 5.5 million:
 ? The CPP-nearly 30,000 to 45,000 strong-is a tightly knit organization
 with a coherent ideology, centralized and cohesive leadership, an effec-
 tive propaganda apparatus, and the discipline and patience required for a
 protracted struggle.
 The National Democratic Front (NDF), through its organizing and
 propaganda activities, has been in the forefront of the Communists' legal
 effort to form a broad alliance of Filipinos opposed to the Marcos
 government. The government estimates that there are almost a million
 members in party-controlled and NDF-initiated village associations and
 that the Communists have infiltrated more than 500 legitimate
 organizations.

 ? The NPA-with 15,000 to 16,500 regulars and 15,000 to 20,000
 irregulars-has become a credible military force that is rapidly gaining
 experience and confidence and is capable of fielding guerrilla battalions
 in many parts of the country. NPA attacks against the government are
 characterized by effective command and control, secure communications,
 good intelligence, sound guerrilla tactics, and effective adaptation 'to the
 Philippine environment.
 The Communists are sensitive to the misgivings of many Filipinos about
 uniting with Marxist revolutionaries. Consequently, their propagandaa
 clever mixture of Marxism, Catholic liberation theology, and traditional
 Philippine values-is careful to emphasize the nationalist aspects of their
 struggle. They frequently cite Nicaragua as an example of a revolution in
 which Marxist-Leninists combined with a moderate opposition to success-
 fully overthrow a dictator. Popular support for the Marcos government is
 at an alltime low, and party propagandists are exploiting this to their
 advantage.
 Despite its formidable organization and successful performance, the
 CPP/NPA has weaknesses. A charismatic leader capable of galvanizing
 popular support for the revolution has yet to appear, its anti-American
 rhetoric rings hollow with many Filipinos, and the party's emphasis on
 nationalism over Communism has drawn to its banner many individuals
 lacking in ideological commitment. However, the most serious CPP/NPA
 liability is the absence of a reliable logistic pipeline to provide arms,
 ammunition, and other war materiel to the guerrillas. Although a small
 number of weapons are now being smuggled into the Philippines by the
 NPA, we believe the guerrillas lack the equipment to sustain an offensive
 of even a week's duration and the combined-arms capability required to
 attack well-defended military targets. The Communists have so far
 eschewed foreign support, and the isolated character of the Philippines
 severely complicates establishing a reliable logistic network or foreign
 sanctuary.                               he CPP has established
 contacts with the Soviets probably to obtain their assistance. Although
 extensive cooperation between the Communists and the Muslim Moro
 National Liberation Front (MNLF) could help ease this problem, we
 believe there is little prospect for more than token cooperation between
 them.

 Scope Note          This assessment is intended to serve as a model for analyzing the
 organization and capabilities of a politically organized insurgency. In this
 case, we examine awell-developed insurgent organization, the Communist
 Party of the Philippines; its military arm, the New People's Army; and
 united front activities that attempt to mask the radical nature of the
 movement and broaden its appeal. The paper does not systematically
 compare the performance of the insurgents against the Philippine military,
 nor does it examine
 the Muslim insurgency of the Moro National Liberation Front.

 Communist Insurgency in the
 Philippines: Organizati?n
 and Capabilities
 since its founding in 1968, the Communist Party of
 the Philippines (CPP) and its military element, the
 New People's Army (IPA), have consistently demon-
 strated slow but steady growth. During the past two
 years, they have taken advantage of increasing popu-
 lar discontent with the Marcos government to swell
 their ranks. The NPA now aggressively attacks the
 government's Armed Forces, increasing both the
 number and sophistication of tactical operations,
 while the party maneuvers to seize political power in a
 post-Marcos government. This paper reviews the par-
 ty's political and military strategy and examines
 currant insurgent organization, capabilities, and per-
 formance.
 Yenan; they believed to do so was only to invite
 government offensives that the CPP~NPA could not
 hope to repel. Instead, guerrilla fronts were initiated
 throughout the Philippines-especially on the larger
 islands that would provide easy escape and conceal-
 ment (appendix A).~
 In 1981 party leaders decided that with the lifting of
 martial law the time was ripe to reactivate the urban
 underground that had been decimated by government
 security forces. Urban guerrilla units, dormant since
 1972, were reactivated in Mindanao to assassinate
 government supporters and demonstrate the perva-
 siveness of the CPP/NPA. Urban united front activi-
 ties, whose purpose is to broaden the base of support
 for the revolution, have since mushroomed in an
 attempt to win over the Philippine middle class,
 largely alienated from the government following the
 The CPP~NPA has most closely followed the political
 and guerrilla strategy of protracted revolutionary
 warfare developed by Mao Zedong and articulated by
 party founder Jose Maria Sison in documents still
 used in teaching all party members. As in Mao's
 revolution, the Communist insurgency in the Philip-
 pines emphasizes the importance of building a base of
 support in the countryside among the peasant popula-
 tion. It also has an urban component, however, that is
 increasing in size and importance. All NPA military
 activity is controlled by the Communist Party's politi-
 cal leadership, which has generally stressed organiza-
 tion and recruitment over direct military action. The
 Communists' military strategy is complemented by a
 political program in which party members and front
 groups work to undermine the Marcos government
 and legitimize their own organization.
 Party documents and actions reveal that the Commu-
 nist leaders have also demonstrated an ability to adapt
 Maoist strategy to the geography and politics of the
 Philippines. Following setbacks in 1972 in the Caga-
 yan Valley, the leadership decided not to establish
 permanently liberated zones in imitation of Mao in
 Aquino assassination.
 The party's Central Committee recently claimed at a
 meeting for cadres to be testing a "new and higher
 form of struggle" by fomenting "people's strikes" in
 major urban centers to cripple industries, transport,
 education, commerce, and the government bureaucra-
 cy. Such strikes, in theory, are intended to contribute
 to the development of a revolutionary situation in the
 cities to prepare them for popular uprisings that
 would occur before the seizure of power during a final
 Communist offensive. These uprisings would be coor-
 dinated with the intensification of guerrilla warfare in
 the countryside. The success of people's strikes in
 Mindanao last fall-several cities were paralyzed for
 several days at atime-probably presages more wide-
 spread use of this tactic in the future.
 Another of the Communists' strategies is to achieve
 political power by presenting themselves as national-
 ists and joining with the moderate opposition in a
 post-Marcos coalition government. This is now evi-
 dent from Embassy reporting and the public state-
 ments of party-controlled front organizations that

 now actively promote this concept. To broaden its
 popular appeal, the party frequently cites Nicaragua
 as an example of a revolution in which both Marxist-
 Leninists and a moderate opposition successfully
 united to overthrow a dictator. The Sandinista regime
 is portrayed as a state where the Christian plea for
 social justice has been realized. In our judgment, this
 analogy particularly appeals to many Filipino Catho-
 lics who oppose the Marcos regime but have misgiv-
 ings about uniting with Communist revolutionaries.
 The newly formed organization, Bayan (the Nation),
 is the Communists' latest attempt to portray party
 willingness to join forces with moderates in a
 coalition.
 The party's consolidation plan is another aspect of
 CPP strategy, which though not well publicized is
 taught to all cadres. According to Sison's writings,
 once the Communists come to power they plan a
 subsequent "socialist revolution" to consolidate Com-
 munism in Philippine society. Although united front
 tactics and coalition government proposals are expedi-
 ent now in forging a broad alliance, once the People's
 Democratic Republic of the Philippines has been
 established the party alone will be responsible for
 transforming the society into a "proletarian dictator-
 ship." Presumably, at this time the "blood debt to the
 people" owed by the landlord class will be avenged,
 Party strategists maintain that theirs is an "unfin-
 ished revolution." The Communists insist that the
 Philippine people were never really liberated-not in
 February 1945 or July 1946 nor, for that matter, in
 1898. They were simply transferred from Spanish, to
 American, to Japanese, and then, following the grant-
 ing of nominal independence, to neocolonial domina-
 tion. The United States is now identified as the
 principal enemy of the Philippine people, and Presi-
 dent Marcos is depicted as a puppet carrying out the
 mandates of Washington. We believe the anti-Ameri-
 can rhetoric may ring hollow with many Filipinos, but
 the appeal to nationalism and independence from
 foreign dictates does not. ~~
 We believe the Communists recognize that they lack
 the capability to defeat the government militarily and
 would settle for a stalemate on the battlefield. A
 guerrilla commander recently told a Manila journalist
 that the NPA expects a standoff with the military in
 three years. Ahigh-ranking CPP cadre echoed this
 theme when he announced at a recent party meeting
 that the CPP expects to reach a strategic stalemate
 with government forces in several regions in 1986.
 It is in the political sphere that we believe the
 Communists now see their most advantageous pros-
 pects. Our analysis of Embassy reporting leads us to
 believe that, to exploit the vulnerabilities of the
 Marcos regime, the CPP is skillfully maneuvering for
 a role in any government that might be formed should
 the President die in office and is actively promoting
 the concept of a coalition government in which it
 would legally participate. In a switch from its previous
 position advocating a boycott of elections, the
 CPP/NPA also intends to actively participate in the
 areas where the party is strong the new People's
 Democratic Coalition will field candidates. Where the
 party is weak but allies are present, the CPP/NPA
 will campaign for the ally and harass competitors. In
 other areas, the party will attempt to disrupt the
 elections through military actions.
 The Insurgent Organization and Capabilities
 To implement their strategy, the Philippine Commu-
 nists have assembled an effective, clandestine politi-
 cal-military organization that wages protracted guer-
 rilla war along 56 to 60 fronts nationwide, effectively
 controls villages inhabited by at least 5 million people,
 and contests control of villages inhabited by another
 5.5 million. For the purpose of this paper, we use the
 term Communist-controlled village to mean areas
 where:
 ? A Communist "shadow government" has been
 established.
 ? Communist peasant, women, and youth associations
 are functioning.
 ? Most of the population is sympathetic and gives
 material support to the insurgents.
 ? At least 50 percent of the population can be mobi-
 lized for protest actions.
 ? NPA militia units may be present

 The CPP-about 30,000 to 45,000 strong-is a tight-
 ly knit organization led by professionals who are well
 trained and highly disciplined. The National Demo-
 cratic Front (NDF), the party's main united front
 organ, is in the forefront of the Communists' legal
 effort to form a broad alliance of Filipinos opposed to
 the Marcos government.
 the party has already infiltrated almost 500
 organizations. The New People's Army-with 15,000

 The Communists' organizational model-with its par-
 allel party, united front, and military echelons-is
 very similar to other Communist insurgent organiza-
 tions we have seen during the last 50 years. Neither
 the party organization itself, the distinctive organiza-
 tional practices it follows, the subsidiary organizations
 it has set up, nor the conceptual framework it has
 pursued in evolving its forces and in contending with
 the government is unique. Rather, the Communist
 organization in the Philippines is a synthesis of orga-
 nizational principles and operational procedures
 evolved in China, Vietnam, and elsewhere.
 The Party
 As with all Communist parties, the CPP/NPA is
 under the firm control of a small number of highly
 dedicated leaders, or cadres, who make all important   25X1
 decisions regarding ideology, strategy, and manage-
 ment of the party. These cadres form the Central
 Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Polit-
 buro 0 We base this judgment on the         25X1
 analysis of more than a decade of party decisionmak-   25X1
 ing and leadership behavior as documented in Embas-
 sy reporting. This committee structure is duplicated
 from the national level down to the village, called a
 barangay or barrio, and is illustrated in figure 4.
 Central Committee directives are interpreted and
 implemented by barrio committees, the NPA at each
 level is under the command of both the local party

 Estimating Party Membership
 Membership in the CPP is restricted to a select group
 of dedicated individuals who have been tested and
 trained for six months to two years before being
 admitted to the party. Under the direction of the
 Central Committee, party members carry out the
 party's program in the villages, the NPA, the urban
 underground, and the various united front organiza-
 tions. Last fall, a senior party cadre announcedC
 that there were nearly 60,000
 party members nationwide. We believe this estimate
 is high, the actual number of CPP full members being
 closer to 30,000 to 45,000.
 Dur estimate is based on the number of party mem-
 bers we believe serve on village committees, in the
 New People's Army, and in the urban underground.
 Barrio
 Party Committees are functioning in at least S,S00
 villages. The party mandates at leastfive but no more
 thgn 10 members for these village committees. As-
 suming an average of,~ZVe party members in each
 yields 27,700 members scattered in CPP/NPA-con-
 trolled villages nationwide. Zf'20 percent of NPA
 regulars are party members-those equivalent to
 officers and noncommissioned of,~cers-there are at
 least 3,300 members now leading the guerrillas.
 the party now has 5,800 members working in
 the urban mass movement sector nationwide includ-
 ing those working in labor organizing in Metro
 Manila. These figures may be overstated. Neverthe-
 less, they probably constitute the majority of party
 members in the urban underground and legal united
 front organizations.
 committee and higher level NPA commands, and
 united front activities are directed by a similar inter-
 locking command structure. Such a system of com-
 mand and control provides local flexibility in imple-
 menting orders from above
 The CPP is organized along both territorial and
 functional lines and, since 1984, by rural and urban
 responsibilities as well. Six Regional Commissions,
 each headed by a Central Committee member, were
 created in the 1980s to cope with the geographic
 spread of the party and to ensure that all subordinate
 committees operate in accordance with the party line
 set by the Central Committee. Five functional com-
 missions oversee party activities in the areas of propa-
 ganda, military affairs, united front activities, and
 "mass movement" organizations. In 1984
 the Central Committee split
 responsibility for rural and urban activities between
 two leaders, Rodolfo Salas and Rafael Baylosis, giv-
 ing Salas command of the NPA and rural operations
 and Baylosis supervisory responsibility for party activ-
 ities in Metro Manila and other urban centers
 throughout the Philippines under the newly created
 National Urban Center Commission (NUCC).
 Since its founding, the CPP has stressed organization-
 al efforts and recruitment in rural areas rather than
 military activities. We know
 that the Communists use well-estab-
 is el -h d tactics. After preparing a thorough investiga-
 tion of social conditions in a village or barrio, cadres
 establish a Barrio Liaison Group, made up of three to
 seven members who may be of any social class. This
 group is then tasked to recruit new members, solicit
 food supplies for the guerrillas, do intelligence work,
 prepare in-depth social investigations, and conduct
 limited propaganda.
 New recruits form the Organizing Groups, whose
 membership is strictly limited to lower-middle peas-
 ants, poor peasants, and farmworkers. Basic party
 doctrine and principles are studied, and potential
 leaders are assessed for party membership. The most
 promising recruits-but not more than 10-eventual-
 ly form a Barrio Revolutionary Committee. This
 committee-the highest political unit in the village-
 constitutes the "shadow government" that directs and
 controls party activities in the barrio.
 The party has strict criteria for membership. A person
 becomes a candidate member upon the recommenda-
 tion of at least two party members with three years of
 continuous good standing in the party. The party
 member who makes the recommendation must pre-
 pare an appraisal of the ideological, political, and
 personal history of the candidate. Advancement to

 full membership varies, depending on the candidate's
 class background: six months for those from peasant/
 labor and urban sectors; one year for those from the
 middle class; and two years for everyone else. Those
 who make it through the selection process undergo
 rigorous training, as revealed by captured training
 materials. We believe nearly all party members are
 highly motivated and dedicated to the revolution; few
 cadres have defected.
 Parallel to the party structure for full members, but
 separate and distinct from it, is the party youth
 organization, the Kabataang Makabayan (KM).` In a
 developing nation like the Philippines, where a major-
 ity of the population is under 18, captured documents
 reveal that party leaders believe it is essential to allow
 for the participation of youth in the revolution even
 though they may not yet be mature enough for full
 party membership. The KM serves as a training
 school for future party members and allows the party
 access to the enthusiasm and dedication of young
 radicals. Some as young as 13 are admitted to the
 KM after a careful assessment acrd become eligible
 for party membership at age 18
 The United Front
 In our view, united front organizing has heretofore
 been the weak link in this Communist insurgency.
 The party's efforts to form a broad alliance of Filipi-
 nos opposed to the Marcos government have suffered
 setbacks repeatedly. In addition to an ideological bias
 favoring rural organization and a reluctance of many
 Filipinos to join a Communist movement, the long
 period of martial law (1972-81) made all overt opposi-
 tion activities very difficult. Since 1979, government
 security forces have captured or killed many key
 cadres connected with these efforts: Sixto Carlos,
 Horacio Morales, Isagani Serrano, Edgar Jopson, and
 Mila Aguilar Roque.~~
 ' The KM is distinct from the League of Filipino Students, the
 CPP's legal mass organization for youth, which appeals, with little
 Marketing Nationalism, Not Commuuism
 The unofficial national anthem of the CPP/NPA is
 Sayan Ko (My CountryJ, which conveys a strong
 sense of nationalism and antieolonialism with a
 subtle blend of anti-Americanism while omitting any
 mention of Communist ideology. The song originated
 during the Philippine-American war, but the party
 has changed the words and popularized this version.
 Today it can be heard at most moderate and radical
 opposition gatherings, always sung in Pilipino:
 Sayan Ko (My Country)
 In my golden land of Philippines
 Fragrant.flowers filled the morning breeze.
 Loving fingers built a paradise,.
 A resting place for humankind.
 One day foreign ships and strangers came,
 Seeking out our wealth and beauty.
 Left our people bound in chains,
 Our hearts in misery.
 Birds go winging freely through the sky.
 Try to cage them and they surely cry.
 Take away a people's liberty,
 Sons and daughters live to set them free.
 Soon one day our trials will be done.
 Night will fade and golden morning come.
 Now, my life and love
 I give to set my country free.

 party leaders realize this weakness and are now
 concentrating their attention on united front activities
 to ensure a role for the party in any successor
 government. The CPP/NPA has begun to scatter
 party cells, infiltrating the leadership of some organi-
 zations, forming new ones seemingly independent of
 the party when necessary, and establishing alliances
 throughout Philippine society in support of the party's
 revolutionar  ob~ectives.
 n t e stu ent sector, t ere are 25 i enti e  CPP
 front groups and 114 infiltrated organizations: in the
 labor field, there are 10 front organizations and 251
 infiltrated. Embassy reporting from awell-informed
 source,                                    indi-
 cates that the party now has about 5,800 members
 working in urban united front activities nationwide,
 with 2,800 active in Manila. The same source asserted
 that there are now 38,600 urban activists in the
 National Democratic Front-a claim that the Embas-
 sy believes may be exaggerated.
 The party's control over the activities of the NDF is
 accomplished by clandestine cells of three to five
 persons who work together to broaden the base of
 support for the CPP/NPA revolution. Cadres use as a
 guide the 12-point program contained in the NDF
 manifesto of 1 January 1973. In urban areas, the
 cadres are to forge links with labor federations and
 unions, teachers associations, student organizations,
 and professional and civic organizations. In rural
 areas, the cell is to conduct social investigations
 among peasants and farmworkers and eventually help

 recruit NPA guerrillas. A captured internal party
 guide to building NDF cells also directs them to:
 ? Disseminate propaganda among friends, relatives,
 and sympathizers by distributing underground pub-
 lications, writing chain letters, and holding
 discussions.
 ? Give direct support to the NPA and the under-
 ground by providing material support and services.
 ? Form additional cells from among trusted asso-
 ciates, friends, and relatives.
 ? Actively participate in legal institutions with the
 aim of making them support the CPP~NPA directly
 or indirectly.
 ? Foster close relations with sympathetic groups and
 individuals.
 In villages controlled by the party, united front activi-
 ties take the form of mass organizations run by village
 cadres with members drawn from the village popula-
 tion-farmers, women, youth. Membership in these
 associations is voluntary, but the Village Party Com-
 mittee makes every effort to involve every family; fear
 undoubtedly contributes to association ranks. How-
 ever constituted, this is the "mass base" that grows
 food for the NPA and, at times, can be mobilized to
 support protests.
 this base now exceeds 1 million persons. We believe
 their numbers are seriously underestimated because,
 most of the estimated 5 million persons in CPP NPA-
 controlled areas actively support the guerrillas
 the
 CPP/NPA directly initiated 40 to 60 percent of all
 major protests in 1984, and, when party-controlled
 front organizations are included, the party was proba-
 bly responsible for the majority of all major protests
 throughout the Philippines. As illustrated in figures 7
 and 8, the party has steadily increased the number of
 Communist-initiated marches, strikes, and boycotts.
 However, the party's efforts have failed to keep pace
 with the general rise in activities protesting against
 the Marcos government.

 The New People's Army
 The NPA is a military organization characterized by
 effective leadership and operational security, sound
 command and control, and strict discipline. The NPA
 is made up of both full-time regulars and part-time
 irregulars. We estimate that there are now probably
 about 15,000 to 16,500 regulars organized in infantry
 battalions and urban guerrilla units. Local guerrilla
 units and village militia make up the irregulars, which
 between 15,000 and
 Regular Units-Regular Mobile Forces. The Regular
 Mobile Forces are the best trained, equipped, and
 organized guerrillas. These uniformed forces are re-
 sponsible for most of the newsworthy raids and am-
 bushes. NPA regulars operate at three levels-dis-
 trict, guerrilla front, and regional-under the          full-time
 direction of the respective party committees.

 country. According to Embassy reporting, the MRGU
 is a mobile force that can link up anytime with an
 SRGU, forming a combined force to conduct guerrilla
 operations in the latter's area. Within the past two
 years, the NPA has frequently combined such forces
 to successfully attack poorly defended government
 targets. MRGUs in Mindanao can now field 200 to
 300 men (and in Northeast Mindanao, an additional
 squad armed with four M60 machineguns), but units
 of this size are still in their formative stages in most
 regions. Operations involving 100 to 200 guerrillas are
 the norm throughout the rest of the country.

 Cadres assigned to work in urban "White Areas"
 controlled by the government are tasked to form
 covert political and military cells.
 I~olitical cadres working in
 urban areas do not, however, normally interact with
 the NPA urban guerrillas, except on political and
 financial matters. The NPA maintains its own safe-
 houses and acquires its ownfirearms and other
 support services. White Area Committees modeled on
 the success of Davao-where whole areas of the city
 are now governed by the CPP/NPA and where hun-
 dreds were assassinated in 1984-are now known to
 fie functioning in n~tost cities throughout Mindanao
 and in Manila,
 The recent capture of an important guerrilla organiz-
 er in Manila, however, demonstrated what could
 prove to be a key organizational weakness, the failure
 to maintain strict compartmentation. To carry out
 their mission in cities where the government's intelli-
 gence and security assets are strongest, urban guerril-
 las must operate in small independent cells. U a
 guerrilla unit is compromised, this compartmentation
 impedes government efforts to neutralize the entire
 organization.
 For example, we believe the creation of the National Urban
 Center Commission (NUCCJ in 1984 presages an attempt to bring
 the revolution to Mnnila as the Marcos era draws to a close.
 Davao-where in 1984 nearly 700 people were assas-
 sinated-has convinced most party leaders that the
 time is ripe to intensify urban guerrilla operations and
 to initiate them in Manila, Cebu, and other cities.
 the NPA has
 been organizing for combat in Manila since 1980 and
 activities in the capital To date, however, these urban
 guerrillas have been largely inactive, In addition,
 now has about 300 to 600 people involved in these   25X1

 tured documents reveal that in Manila the NPA has
 organized an extensive logistic network involving

 Irregular Units-People's Guerrillas. In municipal-
 ities and barangays where the party is contesting
 control or is already firmly entrenched, local guerrilla
 squads of 10 to 20 irregulars are formed by the NPA,
 both to support regular insurgent military forces and
 to operate independently.
 these local guerrilla squads operate in or
 close to their home villages, sometimes in conjunction
 with much larger guerrilla units. They are usually
 poorly armed and may play only a supporting, rather
 than a combat, role in large NPA operations. By day,
 a guerrilla in such a unit works at his normal job; at
 night, or in emergencies, he is available for assign-
 ment by his party superiors.
 the formation of a militia unit
 is the final stage of party organization at the village
 level. These units of about 20 persons operate directly
 under the village committee rather than the NPA.
 The militia members are villagers, male and female,
 who are covertly recruited and given the critical
 responsibility for defense of villagers in CPP-
 controlled areas against government reprisals and
 protection of resident or visiting cadres. A secret unit
 within each village militia is responsible for enforce-
 ment of party discipline, including assassinations.
 Although they have few firearms and receive only
 limited military training, members of the village
 militia are the eyes and ears of the insurgent move-
 ment within the village, providing tactical intelligence
 on all aspects of the local scene, according to Embassy
 reports. Training for the militia emphasizes political
 indoctrination. The village militia also supports NPA
 operations by playing a part in the flexible insurgent
 logistic system. The militia members provide a labor
 force for the transport and storage of food and
 equipment, serve as guides for guerrillas traveling
 through the area, and are a source of recruits for
 regular NPA units.
 Arms and Ammunition. Embassy reporting indicates
 that nearly all firearms used by the NPA have been
 purchased, stolen, or captured from the Philippine
 Armed Forces. We believe that the insurgents now
 have about 10,000 high-power rifles and an unknown
 but limited quantity of grenade launchers and ma-
 chineguns.
 Although we know very little about their logistic
 system, the insurgents seem to be able to transfer
 their weapons between units scattered throu hout the
 Philippines. In Mindanao for exam le
 (nearly all
 guerrillas in large units now use M 16 rifles. In regions
 where guerrilla warfare is less advanced, guerrilla
 units may have as many as 10 or 15 different firearms
 that use different caliber ammunition. It is assumed
 that the NPA uses every means possible to supply its
 guerrillas, including reloading spent shell casings. A
 safehouse containing a weapons repair facility and
 several ammunition reloaders was discovered recently
 in Cagayan de Oro, a city in Northern Mindanao
 Apparently, ammunition shortages are not a major
 problem for the NPA at this time. In an increasing
 number of encounters, Philippine military officers
 report that NPA firepower outweighed that of the
 military. However, should military action increase,
 maintaining weapons and supplying adequate ammu-
 nition would become an important problem for the
 NPA.

 Anti-American rhetoric. Party propaganda portrays
 the United States as an imperialist nation and the
 sole prop supporting the Marcos government. But
 we believe America and Americans are favorably
 regarded by most Filipinos, and this propaganda
 rings hollow                                  the
 CPP now downplays the anti-US rhetoric in rural
 areas to avoid alienating people and uses it only with
 students and intellectuals.
 ? Non-Communist elements in the NPA. In the at-
 tempt to stress nationalism over Communism, the
 party appears to havc accepted under its banner
 many individuals who havc a grudge against the
 government but lack ideological commitment to
 Communism. In Kalinga Apayao, several hundred
 guerrillas belonging to an ethnic minority recently
 defected from the lv PA but continue to war against
 the government. Similarly, in Palawan the
 CPP~NPA has not been able to establish a front
 because of the activities of a renegade NPA band,
 according to Embassy reports.
 No combined-awns capability. The NPA has dem-
 onstrated an ability to use small-unit guerrilla tac-
 tics e13~ectively but to date has not used combined
 arms---the coordination of different types of mili-
 tary units-in its operations. Should the Commu-
 nists decide to attack well-defended military instal-
 lations, they will find it necessary to use direct and
 indirect fire from machineguns and mortars to
 support their assault force.
 NPA Military Performance
 Analysis of CPP~NPA-initiated actions from 1973
 through January 1985 reveals that the level of insur-
 gent activity has increased steadily over the last
 decade with a significant upsurge in 1984-80 per-
 cent of the more than 5,000 violent incidents were
 initiated by the NPEi in 1984. Last year there were 12
 times more violent incidents than l0 years earlier and
 107 percent more than in 1983. Much of this sudden
 increase last year occurred during two months-in
 January, when there was a national plebiscite, and in
 May, when parliamentary elections were held.
 NPA units nationwide now regularly attack military
 targets, and, in our judgment, the guerrillas have
 gradually gained the combat experience and confi-
 dence necessary to sustain the revolution's momen-
 tum. In 1984 NPA raids and ambushes involving 100
 to 200 guerrillas became more common in most
 regions of the Philippines, especially in Mindanao and
 other areas where the NPA is strong. Raids, which
 net the guerrillas favorable publicity and firearms,
 increased by 53 percent in the past year-216 were
 carried out in 1984. For such operations, NPA com-
 manders now combine part-time local guerrilla units
 with district, front, or main regional guerrilla units,
 13y attacking
 weakly defended targets in such numbers, the NPA is
 virtually assured a tactical and propaganda victory.
 Mapping the distribution of these raids and ambushes
 reveals that most CPP/NPA front commands sched-
 ule at least one per month; in Mindanao, two per
 month (figure 22).
 Most guerrilla initiated military activity is focused on
 assassinations and assaults upon individuals to acquire
 weapons. Such incidents now occur nationwide. In
 1984,                     govern-
 ment and civilian casualties as a result of these
 incidents totaled 2,600 killed and 1,400 wounded. The
 insurgents' casualties totaled 1,321 killed and 266
 captured. Insurgent losses are increasing but at a
 much smaller rate than might be expected given their
 more aggressive posture.

 Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) as a mid-
 dleman.' NDF cadres were reportedly dispatched to
 Europe for this purpose.
 with the
 help of MNLF leader Nur Misuari these cadres may
 have succeeded in purchasing arms, ammunition, and
 communications equipment from Libya or Syria and
 in arranging for covert shipments to MNLF bases in
 Sabah, Malaysia, for transshipment via coastal
 freighters to various parts of the Philippines
 he formation of
 NPA units trained in clandestine arms infiltration
 techniques using stnall boats. These units were report-
 edly being used in 1983 to transfer war materiel from
 freighters off the coast of Mindanao. At this point,
 however, we have no corroborating evidence.
 the CPP/NPA is looking
 for new sources of foreign assistance and has estab-
 lished contacts-through NDF offices and European
 Communist Parties-with Soviet officials in Stock-
 holm, Rome, and the Netherlands.
 claimed further that a "reconciliation" between the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the
 CPP/NPA is now being tested in joint efforts in the
 labor sector between World Federation of Trade
 Unions (WFTU)-affiliated unions and the
 CPP/NPA's labor front, the Kilusang Mayo Uno
 Beyond the absence of a reliable logistic pipeline to
 support a guerrilla war, other CPP/NPA weaknesses
 include:
 ? No foreign sanctuary. The Philippines is geographi-
 cally isolated-a situation almost unique in the
 world-and neither Malaysia nor Indonesia, the
 nearest countries, will permit Communist insurgent
 bases on their soil. The CPP has so far used the
 island's environment to their advantage by forcing
 the government to confront them on several fronts
 and by establishing bases in remote mountainous
 terrain found throughout the Philippines. However,
 should the government's counterinsurgent effort in-
 tensify, the Communists-like the Huks of 30 years
 ago-could find their lack of sanctuary a serious
 liability.
 ? Penchant for paperwork. The Communists keep
 detailed records and files that are regularly discov-
 ered when cadres are captured at their homes or
 safehouses. When compromised, such information
 provides government security forces with a better
 understanding of the insurgent organization, mem-
 bership, and plans.
 ? No charismatic leader. The CPP/NPA has no one
 of the stature of Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, or
 Fidel Castro. The Central Committee and senior
 cadres in prison are virtually unknown to the public.
 Were a popular non-Communist leader-with the
 charisma of Magsaysay-to emerge in the post-
 Marcos era, he might attract considerable popular
 support away from the Communists.
 2 MNLF leader Nur Misuari, who is supported by Libya and Syria,
 has been advocating a tactical alliance between his guerrillas and
 the CPP/NPA for some time,

 Despite their extensive organization and the strengths
 their performance has shown, the CPP~NPA has a
 number of current and potential vulnerabilities. In
 combination, these shortcomings have hindered insur-
 gent expansion and provided the government with
 several key targets for exploitation
 The lack of foreign support is the key weakness of the
 CPP~NPA. On the basis of all available evidence, we
 do not believe the Communists now receive any
 sizable foreign assistance. In the past, Beijing provid-
 ed arms, training, and money, but we believe Chinese
 assistance was terminated in 1975. Captured mem-
 bers of the Central Committee have admitted under
 interrogation that the party's most significant foreign
 financial support has come from unnamed US organi-
 zations. Additionally, Libya-through the Palestine
 Liberation Organization-is known to have provided
 150 AK-47 rifles, which were smuggled into Manila
 harbor in 1981
 In November 19841                 the
 CPP leadership was reassessing~i itar~gle
 and had concluded that foreign arms purchases were
 necessary if the Communists were to take advantage
 of the deteriorating domestic situation and rapidly
 escalate guerrilla warfare       how-
 ever, that the CPP wanted to maintain an indepen-
 dent foreign policy-following Mao's concept of self-
 reliance-and would, therefore, probably not turn to
 the Soviet Union. Instead, it would attempt to pur-
 chase arms from Middle Eastern countries using the

 ? Good intelligence.
 the NPA usually is better informed on
 government operations than the government is on
 the insurgents.
 the NPA in Bataan is now forewarned
 of all military operations by informants within every
 military unit in the province.
 ? Sound guerrilla tactics. The NPA effectively uses
 classic guerrilla tactics and demonstrates a good
 military combat capability. Over the last several
 years, the NPA has cautiously escalated the number
 of operations to provide combat experience for
 guerrillas with minimal risks.
 ? FJ.fective use of environment. The CPP/NPA has
 focused guerrilla activity in areas where the terrain
 provides cover and escape. As early as 1974, Sison
 saw the insular nature of the Philippines as a
 potential asset for the insurgents. He realized that
 the growth of guerrilla fronts on all the larger
 islands would stretch thin the capabilities of the
 Armed Forces while making it almost impossible to
 defeat the CPP/NPA in any one campaign.
 ? Popular support. Both the party and the NPA have
 demonstrated an ability to recruit and to mobilize
 the population in support of their cause. While
 coercion is sometimes used,
 many people voluntarily cooperate with
 the insurgents at considerable risk of government
 retribution.
 ? Ffjective propaganda. The CPP has infiltrated
 many opposition organizations-including Catholic
 human rights groups and the media-to secure
 favorable coverage for its cause and discredit the
 Marcos government and the Armed Forces. This
 covert propaganda campaign has been effective both
 in the Philippines and abroad.
 Analysts are divided over the degree of commitment
 to Communism of NPA guerrillas, party sympathiz-
 ers, the rural population living in areas now con-
 trolled by the CPP/NPA, and the population at large.
 Some analysts believe that many, ij~not most, of these
 people may be cooperating with the insurgents be-
 cause of human rights abuses by the military, griev-
 ances against the Marcos government, or the lack of
 improvement in rural standards of living. The issue is
 central to US concerns because, like the Sandinistas
 in Nicaragua, the commitment to Marxist-Leninist-
 Mao Zedong ideology will largely determine whether
 the Philippines would become a Communist state
 should the revolution succeed. It also ctfjects the
 effort required to dissipate support for revolution and
 defeat the insurgency.
 All available evidence indicates that hardcore
 CPP/NPA members are ideologically committed
 Communists who are determined to bring a Marxist
 government to power-even l1'they have to impose it
 ,from the top. Moreover, in areas controlled by the
 party, there are indications that some people cooper-
 ate voluntarily, not just out of,fear. Although we
 cannot gauge the attitudes of most rural dwellers, we
 believe that the longer an area is under Communist
 control-and we estimate that at least 5 million
 people now live in CPP/NPA-controlled areas-the
 stronger the popular commitment to the party and the
 revolution is likely to become. However, the party is
 sensitive to the lack of strong commitments to any
 ideology on the part of most Filipinos and the
 peasants' almost exclusive concerns with local issues.
 Thus, the party stresses anti-Marcos themes, nation-
 alism, land reform, and abuses by the military while
 downplaying Communist rhetoric (appendix CJ.

 the locations
 of 16 new base camps and 44 new training camps
 established by the NPA during the year. As shown in
 figure 16, these new insurgent camps were spread
 throughout the country, which indicates the signifi-
 cant training and logistic capability five years ago
 when the guerrilla forces were estimated at less than
 one-third their present strength.
 Embassy reporting of CPP/NPA activities and our
 analysis                                 reveal
 strengths in a number of key areas that combine to
 make these insurgents a formidable opponent:
 ? Coherent ideology. The party has a coherent, well-
 articulated ideology that emphasizes nationalism
 and anti-imperialism. First articulated by Jose Ma-
 ria Sison, the CPP through its publications and
 courses presents a program that combines Marxism-
 Leninism and Catholic liberation theology, all in the
 guise of traditional Philippine nationalism.
 ? Effective political leadership. Through the Politbu-
 ro, the Executive Committee, and the Central Com-
 mittee, the CPP provides strong direction to subor-
 dinate cadres nationwide. Effectiveness can be
 judged by the absence of factionalism and-with
 one exception-high-level defections, and the mini-
 mal effects on operations caused by the capture of
 senior cadres.
 ? Patience. Aware of the Huk's premature switch to
 conventional warfare, party literature repeatedly
 stresses the protracted nature of this revolution to
 prepare followers for an indeterminate period of
 guerrilla warfare. We believe the party is quick to
 learn from mistakes and has been content to work
 slowly but steadily at establishing a popular base of
 support in the countryside.
 ? Strong command and control. The CPP/NPA fol-
 lows the standard Marxist-Leninist policy of "Dem-
 ocratic Centralism." This policy provides consider-
 able autonomy to local leadership as long as they
 adhere to Central Committee directives. Senior
 cadres are frequently reassigned, and there has not
 been even a hint that either they or their subordi-
 nates question command decisions. Party discipline
 is strict and very effective.
 ? Secure and effective communications. The party
 and the NPA rely on a courier system for most
 communications
 The CPP~NPA organizational infrastructure is now
 firmly in place and growing. Moreover, its perfor-
 mance over the past several years has been impressive.

 Secret
 Training. Two recently acquired NPA training man-
 uals-one published in 1978 in Mindanao and the
 other in 1982 in the Visayas-show that the guerrillas
 are taught tactical operations from the US Army's
 Ranger Handbook, the Malaysian Jungle Operations
 Manual, and the writings of Mao Zedong. The docu-
 ments describe tactics applicable to team, squad, and
 platoon operations and emphasize the political aspects
 of guerrilla warfare. They do not, however, mention
 fire and movement, rally points, and security for night
 field positions-all tactical essentials in combat.
 Some former Armed Forces noncommissioned officers
 have joined the NPA and serve as training instructors,
 according to press reports. Training generally takes
 place at base camps located in remote areas and, in
 several cases, includes an obstacle course that meets
 US Army specifications. If the NPA follows classic
 guerrilla procedures, new recruits will be quickly
 included in combat operations-albeit in minor, less
 dangerous capacities-to acquire on-the-job training
 and boost their confidence.
