 to make it difficult for the West to take effective
 countermeasures and to force the West Germans into
 negotiations with the East German regime at as high
 a political level as possible.  The restrictive de-

 May Day Military Parade in Moscow:                 The Soviet army
 showed new or modified ar    lery, including a
 200mm gun-howitzer, at Moscow's May Day parade.
 Bad weather forced cancellation of the air show,
 but several new planes appeared in pre-May Day
 practice flights and 11 new jet heavy bombers
 were seen in the air at one time.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Having driven most of the
 Binh Xuyen forces out of Sai-
 gon, Premier Diem is faced with
 the delicate political task of
 retaining the co-operation of
 his extremist followers on the
 one hand, and the French and
 perhaps Bao Dai on the other.
 The army, through its
 radio, reserved its position
 on both Bao Dai and Diem by
 deferring to the will of the
 people as expressed through a
 national assembly or referen-
 dum.
 Diem is reluctant to
 break definitively with the
 ancien regime in view of the
 importance of the military sup-
 port which the French can offer
 and because the ouster of Bao
 Dai might call into question
 the legality of his government.
 He is attempting to meet
 this problem by convoking an
 "Estates General" of some
 1,000 representatives from all
 parts of the country`  He
 apparently feels that the de-
 cisions of this body will es-
 tablish the legality of his
 subsequent actions.
 The results of the first
 meeting of the congress on 4
 May indicated that a majority
 of the delegates favored the
 immediate deposition of Bao
 Dai, while a minority pressed
 for the organization of a pro-
 visional assembly and cabinet
 as the first order of business.
 The government indicated
 its moderate approach by pro-
 posing a three-point resolution
 calling for Bao Dai's dele-
 gation of powers to a national
 assembly, the organizati.(h
 elections within four months,
 and a pledge by Bao Dai to
 refrain from appointing a new
 premier during this period.
 French officials in Saigon
 and Paris contend that Diem is
 becoming a captive of the
 "People's Revolutionary Com-
 mittee" which sprang up during
 the past week, and that he may
 become a "Kerensky," with the
 committee playing the role of
 Bolsheviks.  Allegations that
 the committee is subject to
 Viet Minh influence, however,
 remain unsubstantiated.
 The best known figures
 of the committee are the Cao
 Dai loyalist general Nguyen
 Thanh Phuong and Hoa Hao
 general Nguyen Glac Ngo.  These
 generals, and General Trinh
 Minh The--since killed in
 action--have been actively
 anti-Communist over a period
 of many years.
 The American embassy in
 Saigon believes these men
 lack the intelligence to con-
 duct the sort of political cam-
 paign which the revolutionary
 committee has been putting on
 and suspects that someone else
 is providing the brains.
 The committee's brain-
 trust appears to consist of
 pons who have been closely
 associated with loyal elements
 of the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao
 sects.   Of the nine members of
 the committee, two are reported

 to have served with the Viet
 Minh sometime prior to 1952.
 Evidence is lacking that any
 of them has had connections
 with the Viet Minh since that
 time.
 The committee is hammering
 away at popular anti-Bao Dai
 and anti-French themes.   Ex-
 tremism is its stock in trade,
 and it is thus clearly a threat
 to the evolution of a stable,
 nationalist government. Whether
 Diem will be able to control
 the committee is not yet clear.
 He should be able to control
 it so long as he controls the
 national army.
 The American embassy in
 Saigon deems it possible that
 the Viet Minh may be active at
 the third or fourth echelon of
 the committee.  The obscurity
 of the committee's origins and
 the haste with which it was
 organized make it relatively
 vulnerable to Viet Minh in-
 filtration.
 However, a Viet Minh
 broadcast of 1 May described
 the committee as a "farce."
 AUSTRIAN TREATY CONFERENCE
 The concessions made by
 Soviet ambassador Ilichev at
 the third session of the am-
 bassadors' conference in Vienna
 demonstrate that Moscow intends
 to get an Austrian treaty signed
 quickly, with no quibbling over
 detailed terms.
 Although some provisions,
 notably the four-power guarantee
 for Austria, will probably have
 to be worked out by the foreign
 ministers, it now appears that
 the ambassadors can settle most
 of the details.
 A major shift in Soviet
 tactics was reflected in
 Ilichev's agreement on 4 May
 to delete Article 17, which
 sets the maximum size of
 Austrian armed forces, as well
 as two other articles restrict-
 ing military training and
 stocks of war materiel.
 On the previous day,
 Ilichev had said he was not
 authorized even to discuss
 Article 17, and on 1 May
 Pravda had sharply attacked
 etstern proposals for in-
 creasing the maximum limits on
 the army as an attempt to draw
 Austria into the Western mili-
 tary bloc.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 Although Austria is not
 likely to create a large
 enough army to cause Moscow
 any serious concern, the USSR
 certainly has no interest in
 increasing Austrian forces,
 and this sudden reversal can
 only have been intended to dram-
 atize. Moscow's willingness to
 make concessions.
 Ilichev also agreed at the
 third session to delete Article
 16, which provides for the re-
 patriation of refugees and dis-
 placed persons and bans refu-
 gee organizations hostile to
 any of the powers.   The USSR,
 which had previously insisted
 on including this article,

 despite the fact that Western
 representatives had offered a
 compromise version,.

 USSR PLANS NEW MOVES
 IN EUROPE
 The USSR is planning sev-
 eral modifications in its
 European policy in response to
 the final ratification of the
 Paris accords and the ending
 of the occupation of West
 Germany.
 A Soviet bloc security
 conference, with China attend-
 ing as an observer, will meet
 in Warsaw on 11 May.  The eight
 countries participating are ex-
 pected to sign the treaty of
 friendship and mutual aid and
 establish the unified command
 first threatened at the Moscow
 conference last December and
 negotiated during February and
 March.
 Moscow apparently now in-
 tends to take formal action
 establishing a counterpart to
 NATO and facilitating the re-
 tention of troops in the
 Satellites following an Austrian
 treaty.
 In order to match the
 abolition of the West German
 occupation, the USSR may an-
 nounce new measures of "sov-
 ereignty" for East Germany,
 the most likely step being
 the abolition of the Soviet
 High Commission.  The demise
 of this already moribund in-
 stitution would not necessarily
 affect Soviet control of East
 Germany or relations with
 Allied officials in Germany.
 A formal announcement of
 the creation of an East German
 army appears likely either as
 a prelude to or in conjunction
 with the Warsaw conference.
 A possible date for the
 announcement of any such
 measures in East Germany would
 be 8 May, the tenth anniversary
 of V-E day.   It is reliably
 reported that the Communists
 are planning a major propaganda
 barrage then, with a large'
 rally and parade in East Berlin
 and speeches by East German
 leaders emphasizing the need
 for greater production and
 defense efforts in East Germany
 to meet the challenge of the
 Paris accords.

 5 May 1955
 With the successful Aus-
 trian mission to Moscow in the
 background, the USSR may soon
 repeat'its 15 January offer to
 the West. German government to
 establish diplomatic relations.
 Preliminary pressures on West
 Berlin (see Part II,ip. 1) are
 part of the'general Soviet
 drive'to force West Germany to
 come to terms with Moscow and
 the East German regime.
 The USSR probably will
 encourage visits to Moscow
 by nongovernmental Bundestag
 groups and hold out the pros-
 pect of returning German
 prisoners of war.  The USSR
 admits holding only a few
 thousand POW's.  West German
 estimates run as high as
 17,000 in addition to civilian
 internees.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 There is no indication
 that. mobilization of the 62,000
 ineffective Afghan forces was
 ordered in preparation for an
 armed attack on Pakistan or
 because of fear of invasion
 from Pakistan.
 Pakistani government of-
 ficials have informed. the Ameri-
 can embassy that they are pre-
 pared to break off diplomatic
 relations and to close the
 Afghan border if Kabul does not
 respond by 15 May to their de-
 mands for restitution for the
 recent looting of the Pakistani
 embassy there.
 Closing of the border
 would cut Afghanistan off from
 its normal routes to the sea
 and virtually end its trade
 with the West.
 There was no significant
 military activity in the For-
 mosa Straits area this week.
 The Chinese Communists con-
 tinued to improve their capa-
 bilities in the area.
 Peiping may intend to re-
 frain from major assaults while
 exploring the possibility of
 negotiations with the United
 States.   However, the Com-
 munists may at any time assault
 minor offshore islands in order
 to keep up some degree of pres-
 sure for negotiations.
 The primitive Afghan
 economy can probably carry on
 indefinitely even if most
 normal trade channels are
 blocked, as it did during
 World War II.   Strong action
 by Pakistan in the near fu-
 ture would, h'wever, probably
 cause the Afghan government
 at least to review its trade
 with the USSR in an effort to
 determine whether a closer
 relationship were necessary,
 or advisable.
 The Afghan government
 has to date given no indication
 that it intends to comply with
 Pakistani demands, despite the
 fact that it is under pres-
 sure from several other Asian
 nations.
 India's V. K. Krishna
 Menon is going to Peiping
 soon to try-to clarify the
 Chinese Communist position on
 negotiations.  The British
 charge in Peiping, instructed
 to make similar inquiries, has
 not been received by Chou En-
 lai.
 There are contradictory
 reports as to whether the
 Chinese Communists, in the
 interest of improving the
 atmosphere for negotiations,
 intend to release any of the
 detained Americans in the
 near future.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 Chinese Com-
 munist public state-
 ments continue to
 take a hard line on
 substantive issues
 which any negotia-
 tions might discuss.
 Peiping maintains
 that there is no need
 for a cease-fire, as
 the United States
 and Communist China
 are not at war.
 Similarly, Pei-
 ping asserts that For-
 mosa is an "internal"
 question, thus imply-
 ing that its status
 is not negotiable.
 The Chinese Commu-
 nists allege that
 the only "interna-
 tional" question is
 that of American
 "intervention," thus
 suggesting that the
 only matter to ne-
 gotiate is that of
 a withdrawal of
 American forces from
 the China area.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Harassment of West Berlin
 Continues
 The East German govern-
 ment appears to have adopted a
 policy of intermittent pin-
 pricks against West Berlin
 designed to make it difficult
 for the West to take effective
 countermeasures and to force
 the West Germans into negotia-
 tions with the East Germans at
 as high a political level as
 possible.   The restrictive
 devices employed to date are
 few and relatively minor in
 comparison with measures the
 East German government could
 take to make life in West Ber-
 lin difficult.
 Two additional truckloads
 of scrap metals have been con-
 fiscated by the East Germans;
 four truckloads of cable drums
 have been impounded, two of
 which have been released; and
 a load of ball bearings has
 been removed from a railway car
 at Marienborn and confiscated.
 On 26 April the East Ger-
 man police started weighing all
 trucks at the Marienborn check
 point on the Helmstedt Autobahn
 and imposing fines of 50 marks
 per 100 kilograms of overload.
 Road traffic to Berlin, how-
 ever, is still moving at
 generally normal levels, be-
 cause of continued subsidies
 by the West German government.
 American officials in Ber-
 lin predict that within the
 next few days 20 to 25 addi-
 tional East German "scrap
 specialists" will probably be
 deployed to various water and
 rail check points.   This may
 lead to additional minor
 harassments.-
 The East German govern-
 ment has clarified its po-
 sition somewhat regarding ne-
 gotiations on the truck toll.
 An editorial in Neues Deutsch-
 land on 30 April suggests that
 if the Federal Republic will
 agree to talks between repre-
 sentatives of the Transport
 Ministries, the East Germans
 will agree that the rank of
 the negotiators could be be-
 low the deputy minister level.
 The West Germans are
 anxious to keep the problem
 within the framework of inter-
 zonal trade talks, but are
 willing to add transport
 experts to these meetings.
 They are flatly opposed to
 holding high-level talks that
 might be construed as recog-
 nition of East German sover-
 eignty.
 Soviet high commissioner
 Pushkin agreed on 30 April to
 discuss the Berlin truck toll
 problem with the Western high
 commissioners.   He insisted,
 however, that because the toll
 was not levied against the
 motor transport of the
 occupation powers, it was not
 within their competence to
 settle and was a matter for
 negotiation between East-and
 West Germany.

 Japan's Relations
 With the Sino-Soviet Bloc
 Japan's opening position
 in the talks with the USSR,
 scheduled to begin in London
 on 1 June, is taking shape.
 Prime Minister Hatoyama, in a
 reversal of his previous state-
 merits,"declared before the
 Diet last week that the settle-
 ment of such questions as fron-
 tier revisions, fishing areas,
 and the Japanese still held in
 Siberia was a condition for
 restoration of diplomatic rela-
 tions with Moscow.
 Hatoyama had insisted
 previously that Japan should
 first restore relations with
 Moscow and then talk about any
 outstanding issues.   His pres-
 ent attitude more nearly coin-
 cides with the views of his
 foreign minister, Mamoru
 Shigemitsu.
 The Japanese are fully
 prepared for Soviet stalling
 on outstanding questions, how-
 ever, and will give ground
 about a month after the talks
 start and call for an exchange
 of ambassadors, according to
 one report.  The Japanese would
 then pursue their bargaining
 in hopes of obtaining some
 commitments from the USSR.
 In a move to strengthen
 the Japanese delegation at
 the talks, Haruhiko Nishi,
 ambassador to Australia, will
 be appointed to fill the now
 vacant ambassadorial post in
 Great Britain.  A senior offi-
 cial of the Tokyo Foreign Min-
 istry states that Nishi has
 had considerable experience
 with Soviet affairs and, with
 Shunichi Matsumoto, will form
 a "strong team."
 The Chinese Communists
 are continuing their efforts
 to maneuver the Japanese gov-
 ernment into de facto relations.
 Chou En-lai told Japan's dele-
 gate to the Afro-Asian con-
 ference that his government
 was prepared to repatriate
 Japanese still in China but
 that there would have to be
 something more than informal
 talks.
 A similar Chinese strategem
 was frustrated when the Jap-
 anese government refused to
 guarantee the execution of an
 $84,000,000 trade plan signed
 on 4 May by a private Japanese
 organization.  Tokyo also re-
 fused to grant diplomatic rec-
 ognition to a proposed Chinese
 trade mission, despite pressure
 from Diet groups,, Japanese
 traders, and the Communists
 themselves.
 Nevertheless,  the trade
 plan--concluded only after
 Hatoyama agreeu to extend his
 co-operation--pushed Japan one
 step further toward recogni-
 tion of the Peiping government.
 The two parties agreed in the
 plan to hold sample fairs and
 exchange permanent trade mis-
 sions.  The inclusion of em-
 bargoed items in the trade
 plan will increase pressure on
 the Japanese government to work
 for an early relaxation of
 CHINCOM controls.
 Prime Minister Hatoyama
 reportedly is sending a per-
 sonal message to Mao Tse-tung
 stating that Japan wishes to
 accord diplomatic recognition
 to Communist China and that
 ne favors a policy of copros-
 perity and coexistence with
 China.   Such a message would
 be hardly more than a friendly
 gesture since Hatoyama, who
 favors a "two Chinas" concept,
 fully recognizes that diplo-
 matic recognition at this time
 would be premature.

 Status of Top Soviet Leaders
 The Soviet leaders' por-
 traits were apparently ar-
 ranged on May Day to convey
 the impression that Party
 Secretary Khrushchev enjoys
 precedence but not unqualified
 pre-eminence.   Premier Bul-
 ganin's picture displaced that
 of Khrushchev in first place
 in some of the displays, but
 the party secretary appeared
 in the number-one spot more
 often than the premier.
 Malenkov' s portrait was
 placed at or near the end of
 the gallery.  He was third in
 line, however, when the pre-
 sidium members mounted the
 Lenin-Stalin tomb, and was
 shown standing between Khru -
 shchev and Kaganovich in the t,ic-
 turos published in the Soviet
 press the following day.
 These minor inconsisten-
 cies may have been designed to
 show that Malenkov's demotion
 denoted a realignment of po-

 Neither N. N. Shatalin,

 Shvernik was last seen in

 the supposition that neither is

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 This suggests that the
 weapon is not an entirely new
 departure, since the estimated
 caliber is more nearly con-
 sistent with previously employed
 Soviet artillery.  The mounting,
 however, represents an improve-
 ment in mobility over the heavy
 artillery pieces now in use by
 Soviet field forces.
 Improvements in carriage
 were probably also incorporated
 in the new or modified 122mm
 antitank guns and 152mm gun-
 howitzers displayed in the
 parade.   In addition, sixteen
 122mm AA guns were displayed.
 This is the largest number of
 these new Soviet heavy anti-
 aircraft weapons seen at one
 time by American observers,
 although the sighting of small
 numbers of them in convoys in
 Moscow since late 1954 had sug-
 gested that they were to be
 added to the air defenses of
 the Soviet capital.
 There was no air show, but
 several new. planes had pre-
 viogsly appeared in practice
 flights.
 Eleven new jet heavy bomb-
 ers (BISON) were seen in a
 single rehearsal flight.  Anal-
 ysis of aircraft numerals in-
 dicates, however, that as many
 as 13 different planes may have
 been involved in preparations
 for May Day.  Formation flights
 of this type aircraft were noted
 in eight of the 11 practice
 flights observed by Western
 officials.
 Three of the new four-
 engine turboprop swept-wing
 aircraft, designated BEAR by
 Western intelligence, partici-
 pated in one of the last re-
 hearsals.
 Preliminary analysis tends
 to support evaluations of this
 plane as a bomber rather than
 as a cargo or tanker aircraft.
 The USSR may have intended
 to demonstrate advances in air
 defense as well as offensive air
 capabilities, inasmuch as a new
 twin-jet swept-wing all-weather
 fighter and a new single-jet
 fighter were also seen in
 pre-parade rehearsals.

 prince during his recent visit

 Yugoslavia and the West in
 appraising the world situa-
 tion.  He suggested that some
 time this summer it would be
 useful to hold a conference
 between Yugoslavia and the
 Western powers to discuss their
 respective appraisals of the
 situation.
 The Yugoslavs believe
 that world tensions have re-
 laxed to such a degree that
 efforts should now be con-
 centrated on trying to solve
 East-West problems by ne-
 gotiations rather than by
 buildi-ag up a "line of
 bunkers."
 Tito spoke of a "tech-
 nical conference" with the
 United States, by which he
 probably meant a discussion
 of Yugoslavia's previously
 presented "shopping list" for
 additional aid.   He pressed
 for such a. meeting soon despite
 the American ambassador's in-
 sistence that it would have
 little point.
 Tito promised to iron out
 difficulties the United States
 has encountered in supervising
 distribution of goods under
 its aid program in Yugoslavia.
 His attitude suggested that he
 wanted the present relationship
 to continue, although without
 enlargement in scope.
 With his proposals for a
 "situation appraisal." confer-
 ence later, and a "technical
 conference" now, Tito ap-
 parently hopes to avoid for
 the present Western pressure
 for strengthening military
 ties.  He probably believes
 that delay may allow world
 tensions to abate sufficiently
 to make the whole question
 academic.
 Should world tensions
 again increase, the Yugoslavs
 are probably confident that
 their importance to the West'
 would be great enough to en-
 sure Western support whether
 or not Yugoslavia makes further
 commitments at this time.
 For the present the Yugo-
 slavs are probably content
 with the security commitments
 explicit in the Balkan al-
 liance and implicit in their
 military aid relationships
 with the big Western powers.
 Within the Balkan pact, they
 have continued to improve
 field-level co-operation with
 the Greeks in their common
 area of concern, but have
 rejected further links to
 NATO through the pact.
 Italian Presidential Elections
 The election on 29 April
 of Giovanni Gronchi, 67-year-
 old left-wing Christian Demo-
 cratic president of the Chamber
 of Deputies, as president of
 Italy was a victory for the
 parties of the left.  The elec-
 tion outcome was largely the
 result of internal quarrels
 within the Christian Democratic
 Party, and is a severe blow to
 the prestige of Premier Scelba,
 and his center coalition gov-
 ernment.
 Gronchi's political career
 goes back to 1919, when he was
 one of the original leaders of
 Don Sturzo's Popular Party,
 the forerunner of the present
 Christian Democratic Party.
 He served in Mussolini's fix'st
 government, but soon joined
 the opposition and was expelled
 from parliament in 1926.   He
 joined the Anti-Fascist Resist-
 ance in 1942, and since World
 War II has been a member of

 the National Council of the
 Christian Democratic Party. He
 was minister of industry and
 commerce from 1944 to 1946, and
 became president of the Chamber
 of Deputies in 1948.
 Gronchi represents those
 who favor a government "opening
 to the left."  He has been a
 consistent advocate of Christian
 Democratic collaboration with
 all "democratic" factions, in
 which he would include the
 Nenni Socialists.  He has long
 argued that the.way to reduce
 Communist strength in Italy is
 to undertake a vigorous and far-
 reaching reform program.
 The presidential election,
 which Gronchi won on the fourth
 ballot with 658 out of a possible
 843 votes, revealed a deep split
 within the Christian Democratic
 Party.
 The right and left fac-
 tions of the party refused to
 support the official party can-
 didate, Senate president Mertl-
 zagora, in the early ballots.
 The Christian Democratic lead-
 ership and some rightist ele-
 ments finally threw their votes
 to Gronchi in order to hide the
 fact that otherwise he would
 have been elected primarily by
 Nenni Socialist and Communist
 votes,   Some 90 Christian Dem-
 ocrats;apparently refused to
 the very end to follow party
 directives.
 The Scelba cabinet will
 submit its resignation on 12
 May, when Gronchi is inaugu-
 rated. Parliament is apparently
 determined to get the govern-
 ment off its present "dead
 center" and to break the stale-
 mate blocking implementation
 of any effective program, and
 it.may therefore decide on a
 change of premier, looking
 toward a shift either to the
 left or the right.
 Gronchi's personal choice
 for premier would probably be
 a Christian Democrat, perhaps
 Budget Minister Ezio Vanoni,
 whose economic plan the Nenni
 Socialists have already of-
 fered to support,
 Other possible premiers
 include Chiristian Democratic
 Party president Zoli, a non-
 controversial figure whose
 selection would be considered
 a temporary arrangement, and
 former premier Pella, a right-
 wing Christian Democrat, who
 is generally regarded as a
 temporizer.
 In any case, the parlia-
 ment's decision will almost
 certainly be made strictly in
 terms of domestic policies.
 While the next government may
 be somewhat to the left of
 Scelba's, no change is antici~
 pated in Italy's pro-Western
 foreign policy.

 provides for.   The new agree-

 The settlement is a vic-

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE EFFECT OF THE AUSTRIAN DEVELOPMENTS ON GERMANY
 Chancellor Adenauer's pro-
 Western policies will face a
 severe test during coming months
 as a result of the Soviet in-
 itiative on an Austrian settle-
 ment.
 There has been no signifi-
 cant growth of neutrality senti-
 ment in West Germany.   However,
 plans for a German settlement
 modifying Germany's position
 within the Western defense al-
 liance are being advanced in
 West Germany and elsewhere in
 Western Europe.
 Bundestag leaders generally
 feel the public recognizes the
 vast differences between the
 Austrian and German situations,
 although there may be a small
 rise in neutralist sentiment
 if and when an Austrian treaty
 is actually concluded.
 Public attention in West
 Germany is now fixed on the
 terms for German unification
 which Moscow may propose at the
 hoped-for East-West conference
 this summer.   In previous con-
 ferences the Soviet Union has
 always been handicapped in its
 efforts to sway German opinion
 by the basic West German dis-
 trust of the Kremlin's inten-
 tions and declarations.  An
 Austrian settlement would modify
 this distrust somewhat, since
 it would be regarded as evi-
 dence of Soviet willingness to
 conclude agreements on major
 European issues, perhaps even
 such as would call for with-
 drawals of Soviet troops.
 In the Soviet-Allied strug-
 gle                                  over German unity and
 neutrality, the fundamental
 issues remain:(1) how an all-
 German government should be
 formed and (2) whether that
 government should be free to
 join alliances.
 While all West German
 political parties are at pres-
 ent agreed that free elections
 are indispensable as a first
 step toward unification, there
 is considerable disagreement
 on the question of alliances.
 Adenauer's Christian Democratic
 Union is the only strong ad-
 vocate of the principle that
 freedom to join alliances must
 be a condition for unity.
 The opposition Social
 Democrats have openly stated
 that the Paris accords should
 be bartered away at the next
 four-power meeting, and that
 neutrality should be accepted
 in return for the holding of
 free all-German elections.
 There are indications that
 some factions of the minor
 coalition parties are sus-
 ceptible to this argument.
 Adenauer, speaking through
 his personal envoy in London,
 stated last wee', that in the
 light of Austrian developments
 and expected Soviet maneuvers,
 the West cannot at the next
 big-power meeting simply repeat
 its 1954 demands for free
 elections and freedom to form
 alliances and hope to retain
 the firm support of German
 public opinion.
 Adenauer fears that at
 the four-power conference the
 Soviet Union would ostensibly
 accept the principle of free
 elections as the first step
 toward unification, hoping to
 have it rejected because it
 would be premised on Germany's
 neutralization.  A summary re-
 jection of such a proposal
 would put the onus on the West
 for any failure of the confer-
 ence and would gravely weaken
 the chancellor's position.
 The chancellor has sug-
 gested that the West offer to

 include the Soviet Union and
 its Satellites in a new security
 system encompassing all of
 Europe, Canada, and the United
 States.   The proposal calls for
 arms limitation, inspection of
 defense establishments, and a
 system of nonaggression and
 mutual assistance agreements.
 West Germany's present NATO
 commitments would not be af-
 fected by the plan.
 By offering guarantees
 against future German aggres-
 sion, Adenauer hopes to demon-
 strate that the Soviet Union
 has no valid excuse for in-
 sisting on German neutrality,
 and is only using the alliance
 issue as a pretext for prevent-
 ing German unification.   To
 his critics who claim the USSR
 will never release East Germany
 because East Germany would then
 only be added to the Western
 military potential, the chan-
 cellor has already hinted that
 the East zone should be demili-
 tarized following unification.
 Privately Adenauer and his
 advisers state that unity is
 probably unattainable at this
 time.  The chancellor believes
 his government will be in a
 better position to deal with
 the problem of unification sev-
 eral years hence when an East-
 West detente may be possible.
 Adenauer considers that
 his most important task at
 present is to get his country
 firmly established within its
 present alliances.  He believes
 that if he can win the 1957
 federal elections, future ad-
 ministrations will not attempt
 to break these Western ties.
 During the next several
 months, Adenauer's policies
 will undergo severe tests.
 Not only will an Austrian
 settlement create some public
 confidence in Soviet proposals
 at the projected conference,
 but the ratification of the
 Paris accords and the advent
 of rearmament have already
 occasioned something of a
 now-or-never attitude on
 unity in West Germany.   In
 addition, public opinion has
 always been susceptible to
 the idea of a neutrality
 commitment in order to obtain
 free elections.
 The Bonn government, how-
 ever, will probably not de-
 viate from its present course
 unless Moscow is willing to
 accept virtually intact the
 Western terms for unification.
 The locus of power in the
 Federal Republic remains fixed
 in the hands of a government
 leader who is determined to
 avoid neutrality and whose
 great popularity completely
 eclipses that of any other
 public figure.  Public opinion
 polls in 1954 showed that the
 West German people were willing
 to accept neutrality in ex-
 change for free all-German
 elections--but only on the
 condition that the West guaran-
 tee such an arrangement.
 The West Germans continue
 to assert that unity is Bonn's
 foremost goal, but it is
 apparent that they do not want
 to risk their present security
 to attain it.   In a large meas-
 ure the chief issue in the
 Federal Republic is not unity,
 but prosperity.
 As long as the Adenauer
 government makes reasonable
 moves to counteract Moscow's
 unity propaganda and there is
 no drop in living standards,
 the government will probably
 be able to keep the nation
 within its Western alliances.

 5 May 1955
 CHINESE COMMUNIST TACTICS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Chou En-lai's public com-
 mitment at Bandung to peaceful
 aims and methods strengthens
 the probability that Peiping
 will continue to emphasize the
 conciliatory aspects of its
 policies toward Southeast Asia.
 In dealing with Southeast
 Asia, Communist China has gen-
 erally followed two parallel
 lines:   one has been concilia-
 tory, featuring repeated dec-
 larations of peaceful intentions
 and a desire for normal rela-
 tions with all the countries of
 Asia; the other has'.been threat-
 ening.
 While it has increased its
 military capabilities in South
 China, Peiping has pointed out
 the "dangers" of military
 alliances among Asian nations,
 particularly those including
 Western powers.   Communist
 propaganda has singled out the
 Thai government for criticism
 as a puppet of American imperial-
 ism, and last summer former
 Thai premier Pridi Phanamyong,
 now in exile in Peiping, was
 permitted to broadcast this
 theme over Peiping radio.
 In recent weeks, Chinese
 Communist propaganda has sup-
 pressed the more threatening
 aspects of the approach to
 .Southeast Asia in favor of an
 intensified attack on American
 motives and intentions toward
 the area.
 The Afro-Asian conference
 provided Premier Chou En-lai
 with an excellent opportunity
 to stress the conciliatory
 aspects of Communist China's
 policy.
 In speeches to the con-
 ference and in private state-
 ments to Southeast Asian dele-
 gates, Chou denied charges that
 Communist China has designs on
 Southeast Asia.  He said in his
 first speech that "China has
 no intention  whatever  of
 subverting the government of
 its neighboring countries."
 Chou made vigorous attempts
 at Bandung to reassure the
 Southeast Asian countries.
 Even Thailand and the Philip-
 pines, the most Western-
 oriented of those countries,
 were objects of these efforts.
 Thailand and the Philippines
 In his speech to the con-
 ference on 23 April, Chou
 said that fear of China on the
 part of Thailand and the Philip-
 pines was quite natural "since
 we lack mutual understanding."
 He added that "we have given
 assurances to Prince Wan of
 Thailand and General Romulo of
 the Philippines that we will
 not engage in any aggression
 or make direct threats against
 Thailand or the Philippines."
 Viet Minh foreign minister
 Pham Van Dong backed up Chou's
 moves by agreeing on the re-
 settlement of Vietnamese refu-
 gees in northeast Thailand.
 Chou invited representa-
 tives of Thailand to visit
 Yunnan Province to assure them-
 selves that Peiping was not
 permitting the training of a
 guerrilla- force for the eventual
 "liberation" of Thailand.
 Prince Wan has indicated that
 he cannot make the trip but
 has not denied the possibility
 that a delegation may be sent.
 In spite of the fact that
 the two countries "have no
 common border," Chou also in-
 vited a delegation from the
 Philippines to visit Communist
 China, especially Fukien and
 Kwangtung Provinces, to see
 that Communist China has no
 aggressive intentions toward
 the Philippines.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 May 1955
 state visit during which he was
 accorded unusual honors.   Chou
 and President Sukarno signed
 a joint statement affirming
 the "five principles" of co-
 existence, thus associating
 Indonesia with India and Burma,
 which arrived at similar under-
 standings with Peiping last
 summer.
 The Chou-Sukarno statement
 included a declaration of the
 "inalienable right" of any
 people "to safeguard their
 sovereignty and territorial
 integrity."
 Burma
 Peiping apparently also
 improved its relationship  with
 Burma during the conference.
 Chou stayed in Rangoon both
 going to and coming from Bandung,
 and talked at length with
 Premier U Nu.
 Chou's conciliatory atti-
 tude appears to have lulled the
 suspicions of some of the Ban-
 dung delegates whose governments
 have been most hostile to   .
 Peiping.   Both Prince Wan and
 General Romulo have testified
 to their belief in Chou's
 "sincerity."  They were also
 made to feel that Chou's
 apparent relaxation of his
 position on the Formosa issue
 was due in part to efforts by
 themselves and other Asian
 states to seek a peaceful
 solution to the problem.   The
 premiers of Laos, Pakistan, and
 Ceylon-expressed similar sen-
 timents.
 Chou's public commitment
 at Bandung to peaceful aims and
 methods increases the likelihood
 that Peiping will continue to
 be cautious in its policies
 toward Southeast Asia in order
 to avoid alienating any sub-
 stantial portion of Asian
 opinion.   Communist China is
 likely to rely primarily on
 normal diplomatic procedures in
 dealing with those countries
 with which it has formal rela-'
 tions and to continue efforts
 to establish such relations
 with other countries.
 Peiping's assistance to
 North Vietnam provides an
 opportunity for indirect Chinese
 influence ' is the adjacent areas
 of South Vietnam, Laos,. and
 Cambodia.   For example, direct
 aid to North Vietnam facilitates
 Viet Minh support of Pathet Lao
 activities in northern Laos.
 Chinese Communist encouragement
 of subversion in other parts of
 Indochina will probably also
 come through the agency of the
 Viet Minh.   Thailand is also
 susceptible to subversion
 through Communist-supported
 forces in Laos.
 Even in areas of Southeast
 Asia which are hostile to
 Communist China, it is likely
 that Peiping will limit itself
 to promoting Communist objectives
 covertly through indigenous
 movements in order to deflect
 charges of interference in the
 internal affairs ox otner
 countries.
