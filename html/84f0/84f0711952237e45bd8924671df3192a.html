 "Texas politics are tough, but compared to
 this, it's nothing," he observes.
 However, Jacobsen appears to be a man
 who can make the best of most things.
 When he moved to Washington as a White
 House assistant, he promptly made himself
 comfortable In a second-floor office, con-
 temporary in style, with chairs upholstered
 in deep purple and orange In contrast to pale
 beige walls and rugs, and the bittersweet
 tunes of the Nineteen Forties as background
 music.
 LIKES TO DESIGN COMFORT
 "I like to design comfortable surroundings
 and then work in them," says Jacobsen, who
 ,prone to haunt the

 Presidents office, although he is included in
 the select group which arrives daily in the
 President's bedroom before breakfast to con-
 fer on the day ahead.
 Jacobsen reads the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
 at home before he leaves for the White House,
 underlining passages relating to Administra-
 tion policies or programs, to be drawn to Mr.
 Johnson's attention.
 But after half an hour`or so with the Pres-
 ident as a beginning to the day, Jacobsen
 retires to his own office to work on projects
 suggested by Mr. Johnson, or relating to the
 previous day's work.
 CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON
 Congressional liaison is one of Jacobsen's
 duties, and he spends some time daily chat-
 ting with contacts on Capitol Hill.
 He describes himself as a "general assign-
 ment" man and maintains that he has no
 wish to become another Valenti,
 "Jack is a lovable kind of guy, but I don't
 think anybody could take his place," he says,
 adding, "I don't fit the mold."
 According to Jacobsen, the most important
 characteristic for a White House assistant is
 the ability to use his own judgment and to

 duty are assigned to research and de-
 velopment activities.  In addition, a
 small but increasing number of Army
 veterinary officers are 'assigned to cer-
 tain Navy installations to perform re-
 search functions.  The demand for vet-
 erinary officers to be assigned to military
 research programs exceeds the current
 availability of such officers.  It is to this
 vital role of today's Veterinary Corps
 that most of the.people may be unaware.
 Because his training in medical sci-
 ences parallels that of the physician, the
 Army veterinary officer is qualified to
 ogy, experimental surgery, and labora-
 tory animal science.  The professional
 talents of such officers are required in
 military research to provide assistance
 for all projects involving the develop-
 ment of subsistence items or in which
 laboratory animals are employed.
 Although large numbers of laboratory
 animals were used for military research
 in World War II, increasingly larger
 numbers of such animals have been uti-
 lized on an annual basis since that time.
 Lt. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton, the Sur-
 geon General, the Department of the
 Army, has, on the occasion of its 50th
 anniversary, congratulated the corps on
 its many past accomplishments.
 I would like to insert General Heaton's

 Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina.  Mr.

 Army will commemorate the 50th anni-
 versary of the founding of its Veterinary
 Corps.  I take this opportunity to .offer
 my congratulations to the corps on this
 their 50th anniversary.
 Since the inception of the Veterinary
 Corps of the Army in 1916, veterinary
 officers have been utilized in the conduct
 of animal care, food inspection, and sup-

 assigned to research activities during the
 first 25 years of the corps' existence were
 relatively few ;compared to the number
 of officers assigned to animal treatment
 facilities or food inspection activities.
 These early investigators made many
 notable contributions to military medi-
 cine, not only in the area of animal
 diseases but also in the prevention of
 diseases transmitted from animals to
 human beings.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX           June 2, 1966
 my constituents. It is a subject of con
 cern to us all, and I ask leave to include
 the article with my remarks as follows:
 BOMBING  HANOI  ADVOCATED:  U.S.  AIRMEN
 CHAFE AT CpRBS IN VrET
 (By R. W. Apple, Jr.)
 SAIGON.-Senior U.S. Air Force officers here
 have been disheartened by the restrictions
 placed on their conduct of the air war over
 North Viet Nam.
 "In my view," one said this week, "we can
 neither win the war nor bring Ho Chi Minh
 to the bargaining table unless we change the
 rules.  What we are doing now simply isn't
 working well enough."
 In private conversations, the officers con-
 cede that they have been unable to stop the
 flow of North Vietnamese infiltrators into
 the South, despite the expenditure of thou-
 sands of man-houts and millions of pounds
 of ordnance.
 They maintain that troops, the great ma-
 jority of them moving on foot, cannot be
 stopped by bombing the trails over which
 they move or the areas in which they as-
 semble.  The United States has been bomb-
 ing supply routes in North Viet Nam and
 in Laos for more than a year but 20,000
 North Vietnamese  have still  managed to
 make their way South since Jan. 1.
 Nor, in the opinion of these same officers,
 is the Hanoi government likely to sue for
 peace Or seek negotiations unless U.S. air
 power threatens its survival.
 "Those people have had a tough road to
 hoe for a long, long time now," an officer
 with wide experience in Southeast Asia said.
 "We won't terrify them by knocking out
 their bridges.  They just rebuild the bridges
 and press on."
 The use of 1352s at Mu Ghia Pass has not
 been successful either, according to informed
 sources.  The pass was reopened, they say,
 within less than 24 hours after the initial
 strike, which was heralded by officials as an
 enormous success that had crippled enemy
 supply systems.
 "In fact," one key Air Force man said,
 "The B52s are really not very well suited in
 Viet Nam,  They are good for area targets-
 factories, downtown areas-but we don't get
 orders to hit those here."
 As matters now stand, the Air Force Com-
 mand here feels that it is compelled to play
 chess without the power to attack its op-
 ponent's queen.
 Only by smashing the war-making capacity
 of the North, the officers argue, can the ability
 of Hanoi to support a large army in the
 South be eliminated.  Only by doing this,
 they say, can continuation of the war be
 made painful enough for the Hanoi regime
 to force it to seek some way out.
 Specifically, many Air Force officers in Viet
 Nam would like to bomb the military and
 industrial complex of Hanoi-Haiphong.  A
 few would also like authority to destroy
 the dams of the Red River, which would cause
 widespread flooding in the delta areas where
 most of the North Vietnamese live.
 They insist, moreover, that it is folly not
 to strik  the four airfields that ring Hanoi-
 at Phuob Yen to the north, Kep to the north-
 east, Gia Lam to the south and Cat Bi to the
 east, near Haiphong-at a time when U.S.
 pilots are  encountering Communist MIGs
 more frequently.
 All targets in the North must be-approved
 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and, in practice,
 many of them must be approved by the
 White House.  Currently, U.S. planes are not
 permitted to strike in the neighborhood of
 Hanoi or Haiphong, except to bomb anti-
 aircraft or missile installations.
 .Key staff members of the 7th Air Force,
 chaffing under these restrictions, also resent
 what they consider "unethical conduct" by
 the Department of Defense during the con-
 troversy over the shortage of bomb parts
 that has plagued operations in South Viet
 Nam for several weeks.
 One source said that he had been told, in
 effect, to lie, to newsmen who asked about
 the problem.
 Investigation teams have been sent to the
 offices of staff officers suspected of having
 discussed the shortage with news correspond-
 ents.
 "I've never seen a war where Washington
 meddled so much," a colonel said.  "They
 want us to do the job, but they don't Want
 to give us the latitude to do it. I sometimes
 feel guilty about sending pilots up there
 knowing that I haven't done all I could to
 bring them back alive."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. LESTER L. WOLFF
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 3, 1966
 Mr. WOLFF.                               Mr. Speaker, because of
 the recent critical events in southeast
 Asia, Communist China has become a
 key area of concern to all of us.  Because
 of the significance of an editorial which
 appeared in the April ,20, 1966, issue of
 Long Island Newsday, I wish to call it to
 the attention of my colleagues:
 OUR CHINA POLICY
 "Where there is no vision, the people perish."
 -Old Testament: Proverbs XXIX, 18
 Secretary of State Rusk, in diplomacy an
 "old China hand," has submitted to Congress
 a sane, balanced and impressive statement
 of U.S. policy toward Communist China.  He
 spoke from a long background of knowledge,
 for during World War II he served on the
 staff of Gen. Joseph (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell,
 commander of the China-Burma-India thea-
 ter, and in 1950-51 was assistant secretary of
 state for Far Eastern affairs.
 The secretary's testimony was delivered be-
 fore a closed hearing of the Far East Subcom-
 mittee of the House Foreign Affairs Commit-
 tee last month, but was not released until
 last Saturday.  It is a paper that serves as
 further evidence that Rusk is becoming one
 of our great secretaries of state.  It is also
 a realistic document, and a temperate one.
 It does not slam the door on Red China as a
 member of the world community; in fact,
 it opens that door.  If China will give up
 aggression and its efforts to dominate its
 neighbors, the U.S. is willing to extend the
 hand of friendship.  But until such time,
 this country must keep its guard up and its
 powder dry.
 The secretary displayed great erudition in
 referring to China's past "humiliation of 150
 years  of  economic, cultural  and  political
 domination by outside powers.'!  The cession
 of Hong Kong to Great Britain in 1842, the
 forced creation of five "treaty ports" open to
 foreign residents and trade,   and a whole
 series of invasions and civil wars transformed
 a once great power into a nation fragmented
 by internecine struggles.  The Communists
 took advantage of more than a century of
 chaos.  In October, 1934, Chiang Kai-shek,
 as head of government, sought to wipe out
 the Reds as a military power.  This led to
 the famous "Long March."   Ninety thousand
 Communists  under  Mao     Tse-tung  broke
 through encircling Nationalist troops in the
 Province of Kiangsi in south central China.
 In one.year, after the loss of 70,000 troops,
 the remaining Reds under the leadership of
 Mao Tse-tung completed a 6,000-mile march
 through  the  mountains  and  arrived  at
 Shensi Province in northwest China.  This
 outnumbered band, embittered but tough.
 eventually drove Chiang from the mainland
 to Formosa and formed a new government
 Oct. 1, 1949.
 OUR RECORD:  A GOOD ONE
 The embitterment persists, even though
 there are historic ties of friendship between
 the people of mainland China and those of
 the U.S.                             Secretary Rusk reviewed our record.
 and it is a good one.  We have sought to
 lessen tension and to normalize relations.
 Peking has refused every overture, insisting
 that we must first abandon our support of
 the Nationalist regime of Formosa.  We are
 not, as the secretary clearly indicates, opposed
 to China because of its ideology but because
 it is hostile to the U.S. and has pursued a
 course of subversion or aggression, in Korea,
 in India, in Vietnam and in Africa, to men-
 tion a few such places.  The secretary has
 listed a 10-point program for dealing with
 mainland China.  He hopes for peace and
 for an eventual change in the attitude of
 the new generation of leaders soon to come.
 He does not want this country to assume
 that a state of hostility is unending and
 inevitable.  At the same time he reels we
 "should be under no illusion that by yielding
 to  Peking's bellicose  demands  today  we
 would in some way ease the path toward
 peace in Asia."
 We do not intend to wage war on China.
 "We look forward hopefully, and confidently,
 to a time in the future when the government
 of mainland China will permit the restora-
 tion of the historic ties of friendship be-
 tween the people of mainland China and
 ourselves."  Conciliation, however, is a two-
 way street down which the leaders of Red
 China fear to venture.  The secretary, by
 stating precisely our aims and desire for
 peace, has done a great service.  His position
 paper is a classic.  It is a telling answer to
 those scholastic "experts" who have argued
 a policy of surrender rather than steadfast-
 ness.

 Thursday, May 5, 1966
 Mr. HANNA.       Mr. Speaker, it is re-
 freshing and encouraging to see a citizen
 of the United States express positive
 patriotic ideals.  Mr. Darrell Gifford, a
 teacher from Garden Grove, Calif., tired
 of those who are negative in their out-
 look, decided to express his sincere
 patriotic feelings for the United States.
 The statement entitled, "I Am a Tire-
 less American," is an inspiring statement
 of principles.
 The statement follows :
 I AM A TIRELESS AMERICAN
 (By Darrell Gifford)
 I am a tireless American.
 I'm undaunted  by  epithets  from  tired
 Americans and other critics of America.   .
 I'm steadfast In the face of criticism from
 those countries receiving American charity.
 Their right to criticize surely is no less un-
 alienable than mine.  I remember how some
 of our patriot forefathers criticized France
 as French funds, French soldiers and the
 French fleet helped us force Cornwallis to
 surrender at Yorktown.

 "MUST" VERSUS "CAN'T"
 A state-wide meeting of hospital admin-
 istrators and accountants in Durham last
 week was Warned by its keynote speaker that
 the "Johnson Medicare system" is here and
 that hospitals, whether they like it or not,
 must accept it.
 .  The  "must"  from  that  angle sounds
 strange in the ears of hospitals and public
 alike since they have been hearing in re-
 cent days that only 10 of North Carolina's
 nearly 200 licensed hospitals-and none in
 Greensboro-have been approved for  ac-
 ceptance of Medicare patients by the De-
 partment of Health, Education and Wel-
 fare.
 The hospitals, their spokesmen have re-
 peatedly stated, are trying to get ready to
 take Medicare patients when that program
 becomes effective July 1 but have yet to
 learn whether they will qualify.
 Inspection teams are going the hospital
 rounds and hope that their task may be com-
 pleted within the stipulated time.  But there
 is no assurance that such will be the case,
 or, that the inspection will result in ap-
 proval for a substantial percentage of hos-
 pitals.
 We agree that hospitals should and "must"
 accept Medicare patients.  But this "must"
 becomes largely ineffective when it clashes
 with a Washington "can't."  When a human
 life may be at stake, quibbling is little short
 of criminal.
 The least that can be done, amidst the
 present confusion, is an extension of a rea-
 sonable time in which to make adjustment
 and meet standards; and meanwhile every
 hospital admonished, In humanity's name, to
 4ilakeready to accept the avalanche of pa-
 tients which the new program is expected
 to bring.
 'We truly hope no death certificate will
 have to attribute a single fatality to gov-
 ernmental policy.
 DEAR  MR.  KORNEGAY:   Thank  you  very
 much for your prompt reply of May 24 to my
 letter of May 20.  Another matter has come
 to my attention about which I hope you can
 do something.  As you already know, Medi-
 care becomes effective five weeks from to-
 day.  According to recent editorials in the
 Greensboro papers, so far only about one-
 third of the general hospitals in North Caro-
 lina have been found acceptable to the Fed-
 eral Government to furnish care and be re-
 imbursed under the Medicare Act.
 The delay seems in almost all cases to re-
 volve, about compliance with Title VI of the
 Civil Rights Act.  I will not belabor the point
 that any government contractor is, or should
 be, required to comply with the Civil Rights
 Act.  I disagree with the Act completely and
 irrevocably and feel that it is absolutely,the
 worst piece of legislation any Congress has
 ever passed, but this is no longer the issue.
 The issue is that government inspectors
 have thus far obviously placed Civil Rights
 above human rights of the sick and injured
 suffering populace. For example, in a recent
 meeting the director of one eastern North
 Carolina hospital stated that he had for years
 insisted on no discrimination either among
 staff or patients; there were common heating
 facilities  and  common  patient  facilities.
 When the inspectors from the Equal Employ-
 ment. Opportunities Commission visited this
 hospital, they made a major point of the fact
 that the vast majority of non-white patients
 were utilizing ward facilities.
 There were a few in semi-private and pri-
 vate rooms but the majority were in wards.
 The hospital administrator pointed out, as
 you and I can both appreciate, that this was
 a matter of choice on the part of the patients
 and that most of them simply could not af-
 ford higher patient accommodations.  Yet,
 undoubtedly because of this concentration in
 lower cost  accommodations the inspectors
 have yet to grant approval for this hospital
 to furnish services under the Medicare Act.
 They have visited this particular hospital no
 less than four times-naturally at . consid-
 erable expense to the taxpayers-and still
 there has been no approval.  The hospital to
 whioh I refer is located in Ahoskie.
 It is not clear to me just what influence
 you might be able to exert in matters such
 as this.  I do feel, however, that we are faced
 with two government programs, both sup-
 posedly designed for the welfare of minority
 groups but which are now actually opposing
 each other, and in doing so denying the very
 people they are supposed to benefit the
 rights granted them by the Congress.
 As our spokesman in Washington, I would
 like you to do anything and everything pos-
 sible to see that this inequity is corrected,
 and I would appreciate hearing the results
 of your action.  Time is of the essence if we
 are to avoid the possibility of a truly needy,
 sick person being denied adequate medical
 care  and   treatment  simply  because  one
 branch of our sprawling, all encompassing,
 Federal Government has not yet made up Its
 mind whether the facilities available to him
 are suitable to the government.         The blame
 for any such inadmissions will have to rest
 squarely  upon  our . Federal    Government
 which  interferes  with  both  the right of
 choosing medical facilities and extreme need.
 This could, in certain cases, be the difference

 Solution in Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN G. DOW
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 2, 1966
 Mr. DOW. Mr. Speaker, yesterday a
 number of Congressmen who are mem-
 bers of the Democratic study group were
 privileged to meet with Thich-pro-
 nounced Tic-Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist
 monk from South Vietnam.  He is the
 director of the school of social studies at
 Ban  Hanh  University  in Saigon.  As
 director of the youth for social service
 program of the Unified Buddhist Church,
 he trains young people for work in social
 reconstruction in the villages. Through
 this and his leadership of the Buddhist
 Little Peace Corps, he has been in close
 contact with the peasants-who make
 up 90 percent of the Vietnamese popu-
 lation.
 The Venerable Nhat Hanh is the edi-
 tor of the leading Buddhist weekly, Thien
 My-pronounced Tien Me-and director
 of the Buddhist publishing house. in
 Saigon. A leader among the intellec-
 tuals in Vietnam, he. is one of the coun-
 try's best-known poets and the author of
 10 published books.
 Although he is not here as an official
 representative of the Buddhist leader-
 ship, he is particularly well equipped to
 talk to us because of his knowledge of
 both the United States and his own
 country.  He  has  been  an  intimate
 friend of the Venerable Tri Quang for 20
 years and it was Tri Quang who cabled
 him in 1964 to give up his studies and
 lecturing at Columbia University to re-
 tuyn to Vietnam.
 He speaks with the familiarity of one
 who has participated in the center of the
 decisionmaking group of the Buddhist
 community.  Thich Nhat Hanh released
 the following statement under date of
 June 1, 1966.  It contains the thoughts
 of one who is clearly close to his country.
 It contains suggestions for a solution in
 Vietnam that parallel ones put forth by
 enlightened American leaders. In addi-
 tion, it gives assurance that such solu-
 tion would have to be accepted by the
 Vietcong.  In  this  respect  it is most
 noteworthy.
 STATEMENT OF THE VENERABLE NHAT HANH,
 JUNE 1, 1966
 Just this morning the U. S. Consulate in
 Hue was  destroyed   by  angry  Vietnamese
 youths.  In the past four days five Viet-
 namese have immolated themselves by fire,
 some of them leaving behind messages ex-
 plaining that their actions were in protest
 against U.S. policy in South Vietnam. Dur-
 ing my short visit to your country I have
 been repeatedly asked why the Vietnamese
 people seem to have become so strongly anti-
 American.
 I wish, first of all, to assure you.that I am
 not anti-American.  Indeed, it is ..precisely
 because I do have a great respect and admira-
 tion for America that I have undertaken this
 long voyage to your country, a voyage which

 entails great personal risk for me upon my
 return to South Vietnam. Yet I assume this
 risk willingly because I have faith that if
 the American public can begin to understand
 something of what the Vietnamese people
 feel about what is happening in our country,
 much of the unnecessary tragedy and misery
 being endured by both our peoples might be
 eliminated.
 The demonstrations, the self-immolations,
 and the protests which we are witnessing in
 Vietnam are dramatic reflections of the frus-
 trations which, the Vietnamese people-feel.
 at being so effectively excluded from par=
 ticipation  in  the  determination  of  their
 country's future.  80 years of French domi-
 nation over Vietnam were ended by a long
 and bloody struggle, waged and won by the
 Vietnamese  people  against  overwhelming
 odds.   During the twelve years since inde-
 pendence most Vietnamese have remained
 without a voice in the nation's destiny, and
 this at a time when the nation is being sub-
 jected to a destructive force far surpassing
 anything ever before seen in our country.
 If anti-Americanism seems to be emerging
 as a focus for some of the recent protests,
 It is because the Vietnamese people recog-
 nize that it is really only the awesome U.S.
 power which enables the Saigon governments
 to rule without a popular mandate and to
 follow policies contrary to the aspirations
 of the Vietnamese people.  This is not the
 independence for which the Vietnamese peo-
 ple fought so valiantly.
 The war in Vietnam today pits brother
 against brother. the Viet Cong against the
 supporters of the Saigon government.  Both
 sides claim to represent the Vietnamese peo-
 ple, but in reality neither side does.                      The
 most effective Viet Cong propaganda says
 that the Saigon governments are mere pup-
 pets of the U.S., corrupt lackeys of the,
 Every escalation of the war, every new
 contingent  of  U.S.  troops confirms these
 charges and wins new recruits to the Viet
 Cong, for the overwhelming majority of the
 Vietnamese people now thirst desperately for
 peace and oppose any further expansion of
 the war.  They see clearly that the present
 policy of constant escalation only puts peace
 ever further into the future and merely guar-
 antees an even greater destruction of Viet-
 namese society.  There are now more than
 300,000 Americans in my country, most of
 them knowing and caring little about our
 customs and practices and many of them in-
 volved in destroying Vietnamese people and
 property.
 This  creates  friction  which  generously
 feeds the anti-American propaganda, and the
 fact- that the war kills far more innocent
 peasants than it does Viet Cong Is a tragic:
 reality of life in the Vietnamese countryside.
 Those who escape death by bombings must
 often abandon their destroyed villages and
 seek shelter In refugee camps where life is
 even more miserable than it was in the vil-
 lages.  In general, these people do not blame
 the Viet Cong for their plight.  It is the men
 in the planes, who drop death and destruc-
 tion from the skies, who appear to them to
 be their enemies.  How can they see it other-
 wise?
 The United States chooses to support those
 elements in Vietnam which appear to be
 most devoted to the U.S.'s wishes for Viet-
 nam's future.  But these elements have never
 been viewed by the Vietnamese people as
 their spokesmen.  Diem was not, nor were
 Diem's successors.   Thus, it has been the
 U.S.'s antipathy to popular government in
 South Vietnam, together with Its hope for
 an  ultimate military solution,  which has
 not only contradicted the deepest aspirations
 of the Vietnamese people, but actually un-
 dermined the very objective for which we be-
 lieve Americans to be fighting in Vietnam.
 To us, America's first objective is to have
 an anti-communist, or at least a non-com-
 monist; Vietnam, whereas the Vietnamese
 people's objective is to have peace. They dis-
 like communism, but they dislike war even
 more, especially after twenty years of fight-
 ing and bitterness which has rotted the very
 fabric of Vietnamese life.  Equally impor-
 tant, we now see clearly that continuance
 of the war is more likely to spread commu-
 nism in Vietnam than to contain it.
 The new social class of military officers
 and coinmercants which has been created as
 a direct result of the U.S. Involvement, a
 class of sycophants who support the war for
 crass economic reasons, are not the people
 to whom Washington should listen if it sin-
 cerely wishes to hear the voice of South
 Vietnam.  The Vietnamese people reject with
 scorn  this  corrupt  and  self-seeking  class
 which cares neither for Vietnam nor for the
 great ideals of America, but thinks only of
 its own interests.
 The opinion is often expressed that there
 is no alternative to the present U.S. policy in
 Vietnam, neither on the political nor the
 military side.  The non-communist alterna-
 tives to a military dictatorship are said to be
 too fragmented to offer a stable alternative,
 and a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal are con-
 sidered unfeasible because it is feared that
 the Viet Cong will take over the country by
 terror.
 The Vietnamese people recognize both of
 these dangers, but they also recognize the
 utter futility of the present course and the
 catastrophic effects which it is having on our
 society.  Furthermore, we do not agree that
 there Is no alternative to a military dictator-
 ship.  The force of Vietnamese nationalism
 is such an alternative.  Indeed, this is the
 sole force which can prevent the complete
 disintegration of South Vietnam and it is the
 force around which all Vietnamese can unite.
 But nationalism cannot attain its effective
 potential in the present Vietnamese politi-
 cal climate where opposition to the govern-
 ment invites open persecution upon oneself
 and identification with it discredits one in
 the eyes of the people.
 More than a decade of this atmosphere has
 served to drive many of the Vietnamese na-
 tionalists into the National Liberation Front,
 and many others of them into an ominous
 silence.  Last year an effort by a prominent
 group of nationalists to circulate a mild pe-
 tition requesting peace negotiations between
 the South Vietnamese government and the
 N.L.F. was so brutally attacked by the gov-
 ernment that we are not likely to hear from
 them soon again, despite their having at-
 tained some 5,000 signers in less than three
 days time.
 Today, the means for nationalist expres-
 sion rests mainly with the Vietnamese Bud-
 dhists, who alone command sufficient popu-
 lar support to spearhead a protest for popu-
 lar government.  This is not a new role for
 Vietnamese Buddhism, for in the eyes of the
 Vietnamese peasants,  Buddhism  and  na-
 tionalism  are  inseparably                                                                                 entwined.  The
 historic accident that made the populariza-
 tion of Christianity in Vietnam coincident
 with France's subjection of Vietnam created
 this image.
 The repression of our faith by the French
 and  by  President Diem  strengthened  it.
 And today, when the Buddhist attempt to
 give expression to the long pent-up wishes
 of the submerged and ignored Vietnamese
 masses is met by the gunfire and tanks of the
 Vietnamese   army,  the Vietnamese people,
 Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike, clearly see
 whose action reflects our national heritage
 and whose action betrays this heritage.
 Thus, although the Vietnamese people may
 lose skirmishes because they have no foreign
 sources of support, the crude victories of the
 Saigon generals serve merely to weaken their
 credibility while confirming the Viet Cong's
 propaganda claim that the government cares
 nothing about the people?  The Buddhist
 efforts are designed, not to weaken Vietnam's
 resistance, but to create a geniune will to
 resist.
 Differences do exist among the Buddhists,
 the Catholics, and the other sects, but they
 would not be unsurmountable if - there were
 a climate in Vietnam that encouraged unity.
 But there are those who see a unified, popu-
 lar, nationalist movement in Vietnam as a
 threat to themselves.  Such persons help to
 sow disunity and then use the disunity which
 they create as a pretext for retaining power.
 No, we do not accept the evaluation that
 there is no alternative to the present type of
 government.
 The second argument offered for continu-
 ing present U.S. policy is that a cease-fire
 and  U.S.  withdrawal  would  merely  leave
 Vietnam to the communists.  This argument
 we must also reject.   The Viet Cong grow
 stronger because of the mistakes made by
 Saigon, not because of its communist ideo-
 logy or its terror.                                                                                                                                    If South Vietnam could
 achieve a government which was clearly re-
 sponsive to the basic aspirations of the Viet-
 namese people and which was truly inde-
 pendent, there would no longer be any basis
 for popular support for the rebels.  Indeed,
 the rebels would have lost their reason to
 rebel, and if any guerrilla activity were to
 continue the Vietnamese people would have
 the will to resist it for they could identify
 it as being hostile to Vietnamese national-
 ism,  contrary to  the people's  longing for
 peace and reconstruction, and therefore of
 foreign inspiration.
 Since coming to the United States I have
 been asked repeatedly to outline concrete
 proposals for ending the strife in Vietnam.
 Although I am not a politician and cannot
 therefore suggest every detail of a satisfac-
 tory settlement, the general direction which
 such a solution must take is quite clear to
 me and to many of the Vietnamese people.
 It does not involve the U.S. in any negotia-
 tions with Hanoi, Peking, or the N.L.F.  To
 ,the Vietnamese people such talks, if neces-
 sary, are the proper province of Vietnamese
 officials rather than of Washington.
 My solution would be along the following
 lines :
 1. A cessation of the bombing, north and
 south.
 2. Limitation of all military operations by
 U.S. and South Vietnamese forces to defen-
 sive actions: in effect, a cease-fire if the Viet
 Cong respond in kind.
 3. A convincing demonstration of the U.S.
 intention to withdraw its forces from Viet-
 nam over a specified period of months, with
 withdrawal actually beginning to take place
 as a sign of sincerity.
 4. A clear statement by the U.S. of its
 desire to help the Vietnamese peopleto have
 a government truly responsive to Vietnamese
 aspirations, and concrete U.S. actions to im-
 plement this statement, such as a refusal to
 support one group in preference to another.
 5. A generous effort to help rebuild the
 destruction which has been wreaked upon
 Vietnam,'such aid to be completely free of
 ideological and political strings and there-
 fore not viewed as an affront to Vietnamese
 independence.
 Such a program if implemented with suf-
 ficient vigor to convince the now under-
 standably sceptical Vietnamese people of its
 sincerity offers the best hope for uniting
 them in a constructive effort and for re-
 storing stability to South Vietnam.
 The plan is not perfect, for the question
 remains of how can the U.S. be sure that
 the South Vietnamese government- and the
 Viet Cong would cooperate in such a ven-
 ture.  Insofar as the South Vietnamese gov-
 ernment is concerned, the past statements of
 Premier Ky have clearly indicated his un-
 willingness to seek a peaceful end to the
 war. In fact, it has been the contradiction
 between the aggressive words of Saigon and
 the peaceful  statements  of  Washington
 which has so discredited the so-called U.S.

 peace offensive of last winter.  The with-
 drawal of the U.S. support for Ky may
 thus be a necessary pre-condition for im-
 plementation of such a plan.
 It is obviously not possible to predict the
 response of the Viet Cong to such a program
 but the Installation of a popular government
 in South Vietnam, plus a cease-fire and the
 beginning of an American withdrawal, would
 so undercut the Viet Cong's position that it
 is  likely  to  have  no  alternative  but  to
 cooperate.
 Finally, if some may question why I ask
 the U.S. to take the first step, it is because
 the U.S. is militarily the strongest nation
 In the world.     No one can accuse it, of
 cowardice if it chooses to seek peace.  To be
 a genuine  leader requires moral strength
 as well as big guns.  America's history sug-

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. E. ROSS ADAIR
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 2, 1966
 Mr. ADAIR.  Mr. Speaker, a recent
 editorial in the Elkhart Truth, Elkhart,
 Ind., with respect to the loan pool legis-
 lation recently passed by the House of
 Representatives sets forth the views of
 many  thoughtful  Americans. It  is
 worth of careful consideration:
 L.B.J. LOAN POOL PLAN UNWISE
 Its regrettable that the U.S. House of
 Representatives saw fit Tuesday to pass by
 206-190 President  Johnson's  proposal to
 form a pool of government-owned loans and
 sell shares to big investors.
 Under this measure, the administration
 hopes to sell $4.2 billion worth of shares dur-
 ing. the fiscal year starting July 1, and thus
 cut federal budget spending by that amount.
 On final House vote, all 206 in favor were
 Democrats; against it were 64 Democrats and
 126 Republicans.  The bill now goes back to
 the Senate, which has passed a somewhat
 different version of the measure.
 The GOP Policy Committee in the House
 denounced the measure as "fiscal chicanery"
 that would disguise the real size of the fed-
 eral budget deficit, and said that it would
 start a new system of back-door financing.
 It was noted that these participation sales
 would not count as part of the official, legal
 ceiling on the federal debt.
 Usual political groupings really have been
 scrambled on this issue.
 Fiscally-conservative southern Democrats
 have backed LBJ.  But such liberal groups
 as Americans for Democratic Action, AFL-
 CIO and National Farmers Union have sided
 with the GOP.
 The labor organization said the proposal
 would  increase  interest  rates  and  would
 tighten money in the home mortgage mar-
 ket.
 AFL-CIO sources also agreed with GOP
 critics that it stemmed from a desire to keep
 the projected budget deficit for the year
 starting July 1-now estimated at $1.8 bil-
 lion-as low as possible,
 Under -the plan, Congress would have to
 approve funds to make up the difference be-
 tween the lower interest rates on govern-
 ment-owned loans and the higher interest
 rates paid on shares in the pool to make
 them attractive. to investors,
 The House would not approve an amend-
 ment offered' by Rep. PAUL FIND (R-N.Y.) to
 encourage small-denomination sales to indi-
 viduals, as he asked "why not let the little
 cat share in this windfall?"
 This is not good legislation.  Congress will

 Viet Nam.
 The secret battle is being waged between
 United States planes and Chinese anti-air-
 craft guns.
 Informed sources also said  that a Red
 Chinese MIG-17 that Peking charged was
 shot down by American planes apparently
 did fall in Red Chinese territory.  .
 DENY SHOOTING OVER CHINA
 Despite a television repbrt to the contrary,
 however, the state department stuck by a
 denial that the American planes that shot
 down the Chinese MIG on May 12 crossed
 the North Vietnamese-Chinese border.
 There also is reason to believe. Russian
 "advisers" have been killed in United States
 air strikes against surface-to-air missile sites
 in North Viet Nam and that the Kremlin has
 accepted the losses without protest.
 The shooting down of the Chinese MIG 2
 weeks ago is the only recent direct clash
 that has been publicized by either side.
 DOWNED NORTH VIET PLANE
 A United States air force spokesman in
 Saigon said planes shot down a MIG over
 North Viet Nam the same day, at about the
 same time, and thought that it was North
 Vietnamese instead of Chinese.
 Peking  produced  photos  of  the  MIG's
 wreckage and a fuel tank jettisoned from an
 American plane that, it claimed, were found
 in China.  The Red Chinese declared that
 the"blood debt" owed to the United States
 would be repaid.
 On a news show last night, CBS state de-
 partment correspondent Marvin Kalb said he
 had learned that a flight of four United
 States fighter planes had, in fact, crossed
 the border and shot down the Chinese MIG
 as Peking claimed.  He said the American
 planes returned safely.
 WHICH SIDE OF DORDER
 Other sources told the news that American
 officials still aren't sure whether the Ameri-
 can planes were on the North Vietnamese
 or Chinese side of the border at the time of
 the shooting.  They said there was  little
 doubt it was a Chinese MIG that was downed,
 however, and that it fell in China.
 Sources said that, except for the propa-
 ganda Peking is making about the MIG, the
 point is academic.   They said both sides
 know they are shooting at each other regu-
 larly and aren't talking about it to avoid
 open confrontation.

 The Rhode Island Jaycees and
 Mental Health
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN E. FOGARTY
 OF RHODE ISLAND
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 1, 1966
 Mr. FOGARTY.  Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my remarks, I include
 the following speech:
 THE RHODE ISLAND JAYCEES AND
 MENTAL HEALTH
 (By Congressman JOHN E. FOGARTY, Glocester
 Junior Chamber of Commerce, Harmony,
 R.I., Nov. 20, 1965)
 It is always a pleasure to be back in Har-
 mony, and I am happy indeed to be here for
 this charter night banquet.  As most of you
 know, I grew up on a farm just outside Har-
 mony and I have a special feeling for these
 mill towns;  these woods;  these lakes and
 ponds.
 This is the first opportunity I have had to
 speak before a Junior Chamber of Commerce
 group.  I especially welcome it, because I am-
 afraid that too many of our fellow citizens
 have a mistaken notion about the.Jaycees,
 I think too many of our fellow citizens
 Identify you with Junior Miss Pageants and
 golf and tennis tournaments and other light,
 social activities.  Now, there is nothing wrong
 with any of those activities-but the Jaycees.
 have a more serious side, which has yet to
 receive the recognition it justly deserves.
 What people fail to realize is that in the
 45 years since the first Junior Chamber of
 Commerce was founded, the Jaycees have
 made an enormous and continuing contribu-
 tion to community betterment all across this
 Nation.
 The Jaycees say that their primary purpose
 Is to promote the welfare of the community
 by supporting active, constructive projects.
 The Jaycees say they provide the young men
 of this Nation's communities with training
 in leadership and awaken civic consciousness
 to better the usefulness of this country's
 citizens.  These are not empty platitudes,
 Because of our common interests in one
 health area-and tonight I will speak about
 it,  and not about other Jaycee activities,
 such as physical fitness and environmental
 pollution, simply because there is not time
 to discuss all these things-I want to salute
 the Jaycees of Rhode Island for their activi-
 ties in support of mental health.
 There is  no  more  vital  area-no  more
 pressing  need-in  the  health field than
 mental health. Our citizens must be made
 aware of the fact that some 86,000 persons in
 Rhode Island need psychiatric care. Even
 more important is the need for an awareness
 among us that last year only 32,000 of these
 more than 86,000 persons needing help were
 treated, in Rhode Island.  We need to keep
 before us the obligation to provide more and
 better services, fast, to care for these people.
 I am proud that we Rhode Islanders have
 one of the oldest mental health associations
 in the United States.  Last Spring I had the
 pleasure  of  addressing  the  New  England
 States Citizens Action Conference on Mental
 Health in Providence, where I had an op-
 portunity to pay tribute to the Rhode Island
 Association for Mental Health as it began
 its fiftieth year of service to the people of
 this State.
 At that time I pointed out that for a
 number of years now 'I have watched the
 community mental health movement prosper
 and grow.  I have had a front-row seat when
 budget proposals for Federal expenditures in
 the health field came before my subcom-
 mittee for reviews During 18 years of service

 I am proud that the Rhode Island Junior
 Chamber of Commerce-through, its various
 chapters-joined. In this collective effort to
 meet these pressing needs. It did not stand
 idly by, waiting for the Association for Men-
 tal Health and related groups-working with
 the Federal government-td do the job.  It
 joined forcas with us in the best tradition
 of Rhode Island-and New England-cooper-
 ating to achieve social goals desired by all
 our citizens.
 The South County chapter of the' Jaycees
 has built a center for mental health rehab-
 ilitation.  The Chariho chapter, located-
 as all of you may know-in a rural farm
 district, has cleared the land donated by a
 private citizen and is now in the process of
 laying the foundation for a rehabilitation
 facility to be called "Camp Hope."
 The  Barrington  chapter  has  sponsored
 fund drives  resulting in a considerable
 amount of financial support. And the chap-
 ter in Providence is working with Father
 Robert Blair at the State Mental Hospital on
 the problem of the rehabilitation of institu-
 tionalized persons.
 Further, the State Chairman for Mental
 Health and Retardation-Mr. William Mars-
 land-has organized a series of orientation
 meetings to acquaint local Jaycee chapters on
 problems and projects in the mental health
 area.
 This, of course, is Glocester Chapter Char-
 ter Night-the occasion being-I believe-
 the extension of charter to Glocester by the
 Burrillville chapter of the Jaycees.  This is
 a special occasion-a social occasion-a time
 for celebration-but it is also a time for stock
 taking-for asking yourselves what projects
 you will undertake, as a chapter of the Jay-
 cees.
 I can think of no single area where cit-
 izen action has greater opportunity for rich
 rewards-no area of health which is more
 challenging-than the mental health field.
 The passage of the historic mental health
 and mental retardation legislation in 1963
 by the Congress marked the beginning of a
 new era-but that era is slow in coming to
 birth. Citizen action Is more important than
 ever before--and I want to tell you why.
 I am proud to have participated in the
 activities of the 88th Congress which led to
 the passage of the Mental Retardation and
 Community Mental Health Centers Construc-
 tion Act of 1963, and Mental Retardation
 Planning Amendments of 1963.  As part of
 this package the Congress approved funds
 for the construction of community centers
 for the care and treatment of mentally ill
 and  retarded  persons.   However,  at  that
 time funds  for staffing  the  centers  were
 dropped from the bill.    This year the 89th
 Congress approved $73.5 million over 3 years
 for initial grants, and additional sums for
 continuing grants.  This year, too-and a
 year late-funds were also provided to meet
 initial staffing costs of technical and profes-
 sional personnel in community mental health
 centers.
 We estimate that the centers will receive
 more than $225 million over the next 7 years
 for staffing assistance.  More than $100 mil-
 lion over the next 3 years will be available to
 train  teachers  of   mentally  retarded  and
 handicapped children.
 What I have said with' these statistics Is
 that the Congress has enacted laws that-if
 properly implemented-can do much to as-
 sist the mentally ill and retarded-and their
 families-all across this Nation.
 Let me repeat the words-"if properly im-
 plemented."  This is an important and ur-
 gent point, and one that r made just a cou-
 ple of weeks ago before the Rhode Island
 Chapter of the Council for Exceptfonal'Chil-
 Rhode Island, such groups as yours-work-
 ing with the State Mental Health Associa-
 tion-can do much to clear up questions of
 priorities and needs in localities within the
 State.   The  1963  legislation  specifically
 called for citizen. participation in mental
 health   planning,  and   while  the   Mental
 Health Association has the main burden of
 this charge, the assistance you can provide-
 as young people with plenty of know-how
 at the local level-should be an invaluable
 resource for the Association to draw upon.
 Those in positions of leadership must not
 be allowed to forget the availability of Fed-
 eral support and the intense need for rapidly
 getting under way a meaningful program to
 ease the burden of mental ill-health on the
 community.  New hope for the retarded and
 for their families is within Rhode Islanders'
 grasp.  We Rhode Islanders must not delay
 in using every means to equip and assist
 those who are mentally in to assume a pro-
 ductive role in society.
 Legislation enacted before 1965 authorized
 Federal funds for State planning to supply
 better services to the mentally ill and men-
 tally retarded.  It also provided funds to
 aid in the construction of facilities to care
 for  exceptional  children  and  provided  a
 means of giving teacher training for special
 education.  It is my sincere hope that Rhode
 Island's State officials will soon act to take
 full advantage of these financial aid pro-
 grams.
 In the problem of financing, you here to-
 night can help raise matching funds from
 foundations, other civic groups, State and
 local funds, and other sources.  When funds
 are short, it may be necessary to support new
 legislation to finance mental health  pro-
 grams.  The times have changed, and so the
 traditional role of supporting mental health
 legislation must broaden to include support
 of the financial means for these programs.
 In this connection I cannot refrain from
 quoting a recent editorial in the Providence
 Journal, which pointed out that Governor
 Chafee's administration can get by without
 new taxes, but at the sacrifice of falling short
 of the expectations of a modern and progres-
 sive society.  The editorial was called "Ade-
 quate Government Cannot be Cheap," and I
 hope that all of you-and the Governor-
 read It carefully.
 Of course money is not the sole solution
 to this complex problem of bringing the best
 possible health services to all of our citizens.
 At the President's recent White House Con-
 ference on Health, called to deal with the
 most pressing health needs of the Nation, the
 opening discussions of the conference cen-
 tered on health manpower.  For health man-
 power--or the lack of it-is going to shape
 and limit the health care we can provide and
 the health protection that we can offer the
 American people in the years ahead.
 You do not have to be psychiatrists to
 make a worthwhile contribution here.  You
 can, for example, help see to it that the peo-
 ple in your communities know of and use
 seek out and. put into practice programs de-
 signed to prevent these emotional difficulties
 before they occur.
 Many such programs, attempted in various
 school systems, have met with good success.
 Often a crisis may arise when a child does
 poorly in school because of language diffi-
 culties.  The employment of a speech thera-
 pist by the school system to work on speech
 difficulties has forestalled  many problems
 and  improved  school  achievement.   Con-
 ferences scheduled with frequency between
 the teacher and parents to discuss the child's
 academic progress and general adjustment
 have been helpful in coordinating the efforts
 of parents  and teachers, and in alerting
 teachers to possible stress situations in the
 home-such as the birth of a new brother or
 sister.
 Other schools have found that visits by
 the school nurse to the home of children
 who are frequently ill,  often  give school
 officials  insight  into  problems  the  child
 might be facing in the home that produce
 emotional stress.
 Various      orientation meetings  for     new
 parents, open-door policies on the part of
 principals to parents, and group discussion
 between parents, teachers, psychologists and
 mental health workers, are all helpful in
 eliminating the causes of emotional prob-
 lems in children.
 Today, of the more than half a million
 mentally ill patients in institutions in the
 United States, the numbers of patients in
 the 10-to-24 age group is increasing rapidly,
 in contrast to the number of patients in all
 other age groups.  It is estimated that there
 are in America a total of some four million
 emotionally disturbed children.
 Because one fourth of all Americans are
 in our Nations' classrooms and because there
 is a fundamental relationship between intel-
 lectual  and  emotional  development,  the
 schools-through strengthened mental health
 programs-are our best hope for reversing
 the waste of a considerable part of our youth.
 There is at this time no health area that
 is crying so loudly for the attention of our
 citizens.  Not only Is the challenge of help-
 ing the next generation open to all-the
 mentally ill and the mentally retarded of all
 age groups are waiting for assistance.
 This assistance is-in part, at least-being
 hampered by lack of forceful efforts on the
 part of the more fortunate of our citizens-
 such as those of you here tonight.
 This  we can-and  must-do  something
 about.   In the tradition of New England-
 and, of course, of Rhode Island-we must
 assist our less fortunate neighbors who have
 been struck by mental disease, just as our
 ancestors assisted their neighbors when they
 were victims of Indianattack.
 If we fight this fight and win it, the day
 will come when-just as the Indian names
 are. preserved (on our maps)-the names of
 the kinds of mental illness will be preserved
 in books for the curious to read-and will
 hold no terror for anyone, anymore.
 available facilities, and you may be able, to
 help recruit mental health manpower.
 There is another thing that you can do
 for Rhode Island.  Most-or at least many-
 of you young people are parents.  Now, we
 need to develop our psychiatric services for
 children, and launch new programs of pri-
 mary prevention along the lines being fol-
 lowed by the Department of Social Welfare
 and the Newport School Department-this is

 %SOUTH VIETNAM REQUESTS UNITED
 NATIONS OBSERVERS AT ELEC-
 TIONS
 Mr. RIBICOFF.   Mr. President, on
 May 12, 1966, I introduced a resolution
 which reads as follows:
 RESOL'OTION
 Whereas the Republic of south Vietnam is
 actively engaged in making preparations for
 elections to choose a constituent assembly in
 a constructive effort to bring about a more
 representative government, and
 Whereas the United States is dedicated to
 the principle, in the conduct of its foreign
 affairs,  that peoples everywhere have the
 right  to  determine  their  own  destinies

 the U.N. in the elections.
 A U.S. spokesman said Lien "informed the
 Secretary General that the Government of
 South Vietnam intends to hold elections for
 a constituent assembly in September and
 requested the United Nations to send ob-
 servers."
 He said South Vietnam would make its re-
 quest in writing later.
 Only last weekend, before the request was
 made, Thant said in Windsor, Out., he could
 not see the use of U.N. supervision of Viet-
 namese elections "at this time."
 On his return from Europe on May 5,
 Thant also said he saw no possibiilty of a
 U.N. supervisory role in Vietnamese elections
 because it would run into Soviet opposition
 in the Security Council.
 Mr. President, I am satisfied that the
 President had a distinct role in urging
 the South Vietnam Government to make
 this request of the United Nations.  I
 think this is a most important break-
 through, and very important for the fu-
 ture of the entire Vietnam problem.
 Mr. RIBICOFF subsequently said: Mr.
 President, I have just talked with the
 President of the United States and our
 Ambassador to  the  United Nations,
 Arthur Goldberg, concerning the request
 of Saigon to the United Nations to send
 observers for the elections which are to
 take place in South Vietnam in Septem-
 ber.
 hers of the United Nations to accede to
 the request of Saigon, to the end that
 these elections will be fair; and to the end
 that these elections will be of a nature
 which, once held, will merit the con-
 fidence not only of the people of South
 Vietnam but also of the people of the
 entire world.
 For the forthcoming election of a con-
 stituent assembly affords a great oppor-
 tunity. The process will have been begun
 which can lead to the election of a gov-
 ernment which will truly represent the
 people of South Vietnam.
 I noticed that the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE], who has
 been making such clear statements on
 this subject, whose position is so well
 known throughout the country and who,
 time and time again, has asked for Unit-
 ed Nations participation-has just come
 into the Chamber.
 For the benefit of the Senator from
 Oregon, let me repeat that the Govern-
 ment of South Vietnam has asked for
 United Nations supervision of the Sep-
 tember election.  This can be a great
 step forward--one which I have been
 urging for some time and one called for

 last month.

 tended, while we were trying to work out
 a resolution of the situation in Vietnam.
 Mr. JAVITS. From our point of view,
 It is best to let the people decide.  When
 the people have decided, then our mis-
 sion, for all practical purposes, will have
 been accomplished-so long, of course, as
 they are permitted to implement their
 decision in peace.  We may have to fight
 for the purpose of implementation after-
 ward, but that ground is sounder than
 the ground on which we now stand.
 Mr. RIBICOFF.      The Senator from
 New York and I are in agreement.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I agree with the Sena-
 tor from Connecticut that the Soviet
 Union is involved in this situation up to
 its armpits, and the world has not recog-
 nized  that.                    We  know that  detente
 should be their first priority, as it was
 with Khrushchev, It is not now their
 first priority. Now their first priority is
 beating the Communist Chinese for the
 leadership of the Communist world.
 I Join the Senator from Connecticut in
 the hope that the Soviet Union will be
 made to see the light by the impact of
 world opinion.  As we have seen many
 times, world opinion has an effect upon
 the Soviet Union.
 DIVERSION OF WELFARE FUNDS OF
 LABOR UNIONS IN NEW YORK
 Mr. McCLEL LAN.  Mr. President, the
 Senate Permanent Subcommittee on In-
 vestigations last year held hearings on
 the diversion of approximately $4 mil-
 lion from the walfare funds of two labor
 unions in New York, the Allied Trades
 Council and Teamsters Local 815.  The
 hearings disclosed that the funds had
 been  diverted  to  so-called research
 foundations-one in Liberia and the
 other in Puerto Rico, completely con-
 trolled by the dominant figure in the
 unions, George Barasch.
 Federal officials testified that the law
 was inadequate to prevent the diversion
 of the welfare funds.  As a result of the
 hearings, I Introduced a bill, S. 2627,
 which was cosponsored by seven other
 members of the subcommittee, to pre-
 vent such occurrences.
 Immediately following the hearings,
 the general counsel of the subcommittee
 initiated a series of conferences with the
 attorneys for George Barasch and his
 associates seeking the return of the di-
 verted funds to the joint welfare fund of
 the unions.
 Federal agencies with jurisdiction in
 this matter, including the Labor, Justice,
 and Treasury Departments, were con-
 sulted, as were representatives of the
 State of New Jersey and the New York
 State Insurance Department.  In late
 July of 1965, the attorneys for George
 Barasch and his associates expressed
 their willingness to return the $4 million
 forthwith.
 At this juncture, however, the New
 York State Insurance Department, whose
 representatives had been invited to join
 the conferences, asked for a delay in the
 restoration of the funds in order to re-
 view the record of the case to determine
 whether any New York State statutes had
 been violated.  They indicated that an

 It had been agreed between the sub-
 committee's general counsel, Jerome S.
 Adlerman, and counsel for the New
 York  State  insurance  department,
 George Bernstein, that the subcommit-
 tee would be advised, of the return of the
 funds and,that the New York State offi-
 cials would join this subcommittee in
 a simultaneous public announcement of
 the restoration of the money.
 Instead, yesterday, in New York, Gov.
 Nelson Rockefeller publicly released in-
 formation implying that the New York
 State insurance department was solely
 responsible for the recovery of the wel-
 fare funds.  The subcommittee was in-
 formed of this news release sometime
 after it had been made.
 I regret that the disclosure of the re-
 turn of this money was made in disregard
 of the agreement and understanding
 previously entered into.
 However, the record speaks for itself.
 The New York State insurance depart-
 ment awoke to the fact that a matter in
 its jurisdiction warranted intensive in-
 vestigation only after our committee
 hearings had disclosed the misuse of the
 money. I think the' State and the Fed-
 eral Government should cooperate in
 the protection of the rights and interests
 of American workingmen, and that is
 exactly what we have sought to do.
 Mr. President, I have prepared a fact-
 ual account of these matters for the use
 and information of the press, and it has
 now been released.  I ask unanimous
 consent that the statement I prepared
 for the press be printed at this point in
 the REcoan.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 Senator Jom L. MCCLELLAN (D., Ark.) to-
 day announced that approximately $4,200,000
 which had been diverted from the Welfare
 Funds of two New York area unions, as dis-
 closed during 1965 hearings of the Senate
 Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
 has been returned to the Allied Welfare Fund
 on behalf of about 10,000 members. of the
 Allied Trades Council and Teamsters Local
 815.
 Testimony in the Subcommittee hearings
 last year showed that the money had been di-
 verted from dormant Welfare Funds of the
 unions to overseas "research" foundations,
 one in Monrovia, Liberia, and the other in
 Puerto Rico.
 The restoration of the $4,200,000 to the
 Allied Welfare Fund, which provides health
 and welfare benefits to the membership of
 the two unions, is the direct result of nego-
 tiations Initiated by the Subcommittee in
 the summer of 1965, immediately after the
 hearings relating to the diversion of the
 funds.  The General Counsel of the Sub-
 committee entered negotiations at that time
 with attorneys for George Barasch and his
 sc
 se   y
 e
 u
 comm
 ttee hear-
 ings.  The New York State authorities sought
 to determine whether there had been any
 violation of State laws in this case.
 In August of      1965, Senator MCCLELLAN
 acceded to the New York State request.  The
 State proceeded with its investigation and
 apparently finally determined that New York
 State statutes did not provide penalties for
 the diversion of the welfare funds.     The
 $4,200,000 was returned to the Welfare Funds
 under the supervision of the New York State
 Insurance Department.
 George Barasch has- resigned from his po-
 sitions as lifetime trustee for each of the
 several employe welfare and pension bene-
 fit plans of the two unions, including the
 two major plans, the Allied Welfare Fund
 and the Union Mutual Fund.  New employee
 trustees have been selected for the funds, as
 required by the provisions of the Taft-Hart-
 ley Act that govern joint trust funds.
 The trust agreements of the two unions
 have been reviewed and revised in order to
 establish proper safeguards for the rights
 and interests of the rank-and-file members
 of the unions who are their participants.
 Senator MCCLELLAN stated that the total
 sum of $4,200,000 represents all of the hold-
 ings of the Cromwell Research Foundation
 of Puerto Rico, the Chemical Research Foun-
 dation of Liberia, and the Caribbean Educa-
 tional Association of Puerto Rico.  The agree-
 ment between Mr. Barasch and certain as-
 sociates, who are the officials of the overseas
 foundations, and the new trustees of the
 Allied Welfare Fund provides that the money
 that has been returned will be utilized for
 charitable and education purposes that will
 benefit the almost 10,000 members of the Al-
 lied  Trades  Council and Teamsters Local
 # 815, and that New York State authori-
 ties will supervise the administration of the
 funds by the trustees.
 Additionally, the overseas foundations in
 Liberia and Puerto Rico will be dissolved.
 The Subcommittee's report to the Senate
 on the investigation into the diversion of
 the welfare funds has not yet been filed.
 Filing was -withheld until New York author-
 ities acted upon the agreement made last
 summer by attorneys for Mr. Barasch to re-
 turn the diverted funds.  Senator MCCLELLAN
 stated that the report will be filed in the
 near future.
 As a result of the Subcommittee's hear-
 ing on these welfare funds, Senator MCCLEL-
 LAN introduced S. 2627, a bill to amend the
 Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure Act for
 the purpose of providing additional safe-
 guards for the rights and interests of par-
 ticipants and beneficiaries of employee bene-
 fit plans.  The bill, which has been referred
 to the Senate Committee on Labor and Pub-
 lic Welfare, has as co-sponsor seven of the
 other members of the Subcommittee.
 Senator MCCLELLAN stated his hope that
 the Subconi.mittee's hearings also have served
 to alert American workers who are partici-
 pants in employee benefit plans to the dan-
 gers inherent in lack of interest and in fail-
 ure to participate actively in union affairs.
 The Subcommittee will continue to exam-
 ine- the administration and disbursement of
 welfare and pension funds,. and may hold
 hearings in the future after additional in-
 vestigations in the field.

 Charter.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD those provisions of the statement
 of policy of July 1954, adopted by the
 signatories to the Geneva accords, of
 which the United States on the very
 face of the accords stands in violation.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD;
 as follows:
 12. FINAL DECLA14.ATIO.N OF GENEVA CONFER-
 ENCE,, JULY 21, 19541
 Final declaration, dated July 21, 1954, of
 the Geneva Conference on the problem of re-
 storing peace in Indo-China, in which the
 representatives of Cambodia, the Democratic
 Republic of Viet-Nam, France, Laos, the
 People's Republic of China, the State of Viet-
 Nam, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
 the United Kingdom, and the United States
 of America took part.
 1. The Conference takes note of the agree-
 ments ending hostilities in Cambodia, Laos
 and Viet-Nam and organizing International
 control and the supervision of the execution
 of the provisions of these agreements.
 2. The Conference expresses satisfaction at
 the ending of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos
 and Viet-Nam; the Conference expresses Its
 conviction that the execution of the provi-
 sions set out in the present declaration and
 in the agreements on the cessation of hostili-
 ties will permit Cambodia, Laos and Viet-
 Nam henceforth to play their part, in full in-
 dependence and sovereignty, in the peaceful
 community of nations.

 measures permitting all citizens to take their

 made perfectly clear that no bases were to        to be allowed to be established by a for-
 eign government. We established bases,
 we maintain them, we are responsible
 for them. We are guilty of illegal con-
 duct in constructing those bases and in
 the military aid we sent to South Viet-
 nam as early as 1955.
 Mr. President, the accords, as will be
 seen from the material I have intro-
 duced, also made perfectly clear that
 from July 1954 to July 1956 plans were
 to 'be made for the holding of elections in
 Vietnam-all of Vietnam-to the end of
 selecting their officers and working out
 the procedure for a unified Vietnam.
 And why should it not be unified?
 These are one people, engaged in a civil
 war. Within South Vietnam itself, there
 is a civil war.  The State Department
 does not like to have that phrase used;
 but it is interesting that more and more
 editors are using it now.  The senior
 Senator from Oregon and the Senator
 from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING] have been
 criticized emphatically and in many in-
 stances viciously, in the last 3 years, be-
 cause we have pointed out the undeni-
 able fact that it is a civil war, with over-
 tones and undertones of a religious war
 also, in which we are unjustifiably kill-
 ing American boys.
 Mr. President, the United Nations will
 have to face up to the fact that the
 United States stopped those elections
 that were planned for July 1956 because
 our intelligence reports were that if they
 were held, Ho Chi Minh would be elected
 president.  And of course we have set
 ourselves up unilaterally to tell the world
 that we are going to determine the inter-
 nal affairs of countries that we think are
 threatened with a Communist takeover,
 irrespective of what the wishes of the
 people may be.
 That policy is getting us into greater
 and greater trouble.  In my judgment,
 it is creating great internal stresses in
 this country, which will become worse,
 until eventually the American people, in
 my judgment, will repudiate any govern-
 ment that continues to sacrifice Amer-
 ican boys by increasing thousands, as
 will come to pass if we do not stop our
 participation in the war.  We have al-
 ready killed over 3,200 of them-young
 American men who never 'should have
 been sent there in the first place.  The
 Pentagon admits that we have wounded        the principles of justice and international

 and it is more important now, may I say
 to my President, after he has announced
 today his support of some United Na-
 tions supervision of elections-that my
 President go to New York and ask the
 United Nations to-take over the threat
 completely.
 That is the obligation of the United
 Nations.  If the Security Council does
 not wish to do it, then let my President,
 as I have said so many times, make a
 plea to the General Assembly for a cease-
 fire order, with the pledge of the mem-
 bers of the General Assembly-and that
 is the responsibility the Charter places
 upon them-to send over whatever num-
 ber of men are necessary to enforce a
 cease-fire.  That is quite a different
 thing from making war, as the United
 States is making it, in South Vietnam.
 That is what the President of the United
 States ought to be asking the United
 Nations to do-not asking them to su-
 pervise the "election" of the govern-
 ment's candidates.
 Oh, that will get public attention, and
 create the false impression in the minds
 of many that the United States is seek-
 ing United Nations intervention.  But
 the test of whether or not the United
 States is seeking United Nations inter-
 vention is whether or not my President
 and yours will say to the United Nations,
 "Take over this threat to the peace of
 the world in southeast Asia." And noth-
 ing less than that carries out my Presi-
 dent's responsibilities under the Charter.
 Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unan-
 imous consent that there be printed in
 the RECORD at this point a series of the
 articles in the United Nations Charter
 of which, in my judgment, the United
 States has violated by its intervention.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ty-
 DINGS in the chair).  Without objection,
 it is so ordered.
 The portions of the United Nations
 Charter ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD are as follows:

 Article 54
 The Security Council shall at all times be
 kept fully informed of activities undertaken
 or in contemplation under regional arrange-
 ments or by regional agencies for the mainte-
 nance of international peace and security.
 Mr.  MORSE.  Mr.  President,  the
 Senator from New York [Mr. JAVITS], in
 his colloquy with the Senator from Con-
 necticut [Mr. RIHICOFF], mentioned the
 supervisory role the United Nations has
 played in the Congo, and in the dispute
 between Israel and other countries of
 the Middle East.
 I do not know what he means by a
 supervisory role.  The United Nations
 took over in the Congo.  I was one of
 the representatives of this Government
 as a delegate in the United Nations when
 it did.  But we had a Secretary-Gen-
 eral of the United Nations at that time
 by the name of Dag Hammarskjold, who
 did not engage in evasions with regard
 to his responsibilities.  That courageous
 Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold,
 left no room for doubt as to where he
 thought the United Nations should stand
 In regard to maintaining the peace of
 the world In the Congo.  But Mr. U
 Thant has.  In my judgment, in so do-
 ing he has failed in his responsibilities
 and obligations as Secretary-General of
 the United Nations.  All his supporters
 are saying Russia, France, the United
 States, Great Britain; and the other
 great powers wish him to remain as
 Secretary-General.  If that be true, I
 suspect that his over-all do-nothing
 policy is probably why they want him
 to remain.
 What we must have, if we are to stop
 this killing in southeast Asia, and the
 danger of a massive war and more mas-
 sive killing spreading through Asia and
 throughout the world, is for the United
 Nations to proceed to act.  Our country
 ought to put the United Nations on the
 spot now, by asking them to declare the
 cease-fire and take action.  Anything
 short of that, may I say, on the part of
 our President and our Ambassador to
 the United Nations is failing to carry
 out what is our clear obligation, in order
 to preserve peace in the world.
 Mr. President, there is such a growing
 insistence across this country that we
 change our course of action in southeast
 Asia that I am greatly encouraged from
 the reaction of the people of this country.
 That gives cause for renewed hope be-
 cause as increasing millions make clearer
 and clearer to our President that they
 want this policy changed, I think there is
 some hope that we will stop slaughtering
 these American boys and also slaughter-
 ing Asians by the course of action we are
 following in southeast Asia.
 But, Mr. President, we can redeem our-
 selves.  We can redeem ourselves by
 changing our course of action in :rela-
 tionship to the United Nations itself.
 We  can  redeem  ourselves  by  our
 President announcing,  as he should
 be announcing, a cease-fire as far as
 U.S. operations in South Vietnam are
 concerned.
 When there is this internal turmoil
 going on in South Vietnam, when there
 is the situation of South Vietnamese
 fighting themselves, when the South
 Vietnamese troops of the junta govern-
 ment devote so much time and effort to
 suppressing opposition and insurrection
 in the areas not even controlled by the
 Vietcong, it is about time that the Presi-
 dent gave the assurance to the American
 people that he is going to stop ordering
 the killing of American boys in South
 Vietnam in that inexcusable, immoral,
 and sinful war.
 That is what the American people
 should demand from the President, be-
 cause the President can stop the killing
 of American boys in South Vietnam by
 issuing an order of cease-fire as far as
 American  troops  are concerned.  The
 President can stop the killing of Ameri-
 can boys in an escalating war by adopt-
 ing the recommendation of General
 Ridgway, General Gavin, George Ken-

 nan, and others, who point out that we
 must adopt the enclave strategy in South
 Vietnam in order to stop increasing hour
 by hour the serious danger of an all-out
 massive war in Asia with both China and
 Russia.
 I was interested in the comments of
 the Senator from New York [Mr. JAVITS]
 and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr.
 RIBIcoFF] about the responsibilities and
 obligations of Russia and Japan. They
 do have responsibilities and obligations.
 Both of them have been derelict.  But
 there is another side to that coin, too.
 How fortunate the United States and
 mankind are that Russia has not joined
 the United States in outlawry in south-
 east Asia. How fortunate the people of
 the United States and the people of the
 world are that Russia thus far has exer-
 cised the restraint of not constructing
 Soviet bases in North Vietnam, not send-
 ing Soviet troops in to the assistance of
 the Vietnamese, not sending in her air
 power, which we all know would mean
 world war III if she should start doing it.
 If one looks at that side of the coin
 the sad fact is that Russia has to be
 given credit for not starting world war
 III yet.  Although she has made very
 clear her complete disaproval of our pol-
 icy in Vietnam, although she has given
 some military aid to the North Vietnam-
 ese and to the Vietcong, the fact remains
 that the restraint of Russia in regard to
 the Vietnamese situation has prevented
 the beginning of world war III.  How
 long she will restrain herself I think only
 God knows.  So, it is increasingly im-
 portant that our country stop risking
 world war III,     t
 It is saddening to listen to spokesmen
 ive reassurances to
 n
 t
 G
 I should like to hear the President
 repudiate the war hawks.  In fact, I
 should like to have my President face up
 to his obligation under article I, section
 8, of the Constitution, and stop making
 war without a declaration of war. That
 is a clear obligation of this President of
 ours to the American people.  Let the
 American people have this war issue
 clearly drawn. Let the President send a
 war message to Congress, and let Con-
 gress decide whether we want a legal
 war in the sense that a legal war can be
 conducted only under a. declarations of
 war.  Our constitutional fathers taught
 us that lesson in the constitutional de-
 bates, when they wrote article I, section
 8, of the Constitution.  They denied to
 the President the power to wage war
 without a declaration of war.
 The great statesmen from that time on
 have made that perfectly clear, as have
 great constitutional scholars.  I placed
 in the RECORD last Friday an article pub-
 lished in the June issue of the Diplomat,
 an article written by a man considered
 by many as the greatest living American
 historian, but I should say he is among
 the first three-Henry Commager, of
 Amherst -University.
 He not only devastatingly answers the
 argument of those who claim that the
 President can make war without a
 declaration of war, but he devastatingly
 answers the chain of non sequiturs and
 policies of Dean Rusk, who tries to jus-
 tify                                                the  killing  in  Vietnam  under
 SEATO.
 Let my President face up to his con-
 stitutional duty.                                                       Let my President take
 to the American people a proposal for
 a declaration of war, as Woodrow Wil-
 son did on the night of April 2, 1917, as
 g
 overnme
 of our
 the American people day in and day out  I have said in my speeches on the floor
 that things are looking better in South of the Senate at least 20 times in the
 Vietnam because we are making military  last 3 years, and shall continue to say
 progress. We are killing more.  We are  it, because by repetition, repetition, and
 devastating more.  We are despoiling    repetition, more and more people are be-

 ing Hanoi, or any point that these mill-           p eared
 recommended a declaration of
 tarists suggest.  The American militar-                gress
 lets are the greatest threat to the peace war against the German Imperialist
 of the world because it happens to be the Government.  In the first paragraph of
 American militarists in the service, and that Great War message, President Wil-
 some of those retired, such as Admiral              son said there were decisions to be made
 Radford or General LeMay, who are ad-   that it was neither right nor constitu-

 most appeal to the American public.                 loan people that he is for United Nations
 supervision of elections in South Viet-
 nam, when those elections will allow no
 choice among policies and will not cover
 the whole of the population of Vietnam,
 because it will eliminate completely one
 side to the war; namely, the Vietcong..
 What kind of elections will they be?
 Stacked, -controlled, and rigged.  It is
 one thing for the President to ask for
 supervision of  those elections by the
 United Nations, but I ask the President
 again, "Why do your not call upon the
 United Nations to declare a cease-fire
 and declare that we will support a cease-
 fire."
 That is the President's responsibility
 under the United Nations Charter, as
 it is the President's responsibility under
 the Constitution,  either to propose a
 declaration of war or to stop being re-
 sponsible for the killing of increasing,
 numbers of American boys in South
 Vietnam.
 That is the issue.
 Eventually, the American people will
 determine it.
 Mr. President, I made these comments
 today, not expecting to make them until
 I heard the Senator from Connecticut
 and the Senator from New York, and
 until I heard about the announcement
 which is coming out of the White House
 from our President and our Ambassador
 to the United Nations.
 I say to the American people that the
 President and Ambassador Goldberg deal
 with a very superficial phase of this
 problem.  They do not go to the heart
 of the problem, nor do they carry out
 the clear responsibility of our President
 and our Ambassador in the United Na-
 tions concerning our obligations to man-
 kind to stop the butchery in South Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD cer-
 tain materials, letters, and telegrams
 which I have received in support of the
 position I have taken in opposition to
 the President's war in South Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 you to those that are pouring in upon you
 concerning your courageous stand against
 the administration's position in Southeast
 Asia and Vietnam.  Please continue your ef-
 forts for world peace.
 I believe some members of the present ad-

 these words of President Kennedy: "We are
 not afraid to entrust the American people
 with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien
 philosophies and competitive values.  For a
 nation that is afraid to let its people judge
 the truth and falsehood in an open market
 is a nation that is afraid of its people."

 our top decision-makers. I wonder often at
 the nature of their motivation. What drives
 these people to ignore the facts of the situa-
 tion?  Is it selfish economic interest: there
 is a perhaps apocryphal story to the effect
 that when approached at some recent gov-
 ernors' conference about the possibility of
 seriously trying to end the Vietnam war, Mr.
 Johnson asked: "Do you want an economic
 crisis or  continued prosperity?". , Is  It a
 short-sighted view of our interest in Asia
 from a military stand-point?  Is it because
 the military are more and. more ruling this
 country, therefore imposing their views on
 the necessity of war?  Is it just pure ig-
 norance, or arrogance as Senator FULBRIGHT
 put it, or self-delusion in imagining our-
 selves the rightful, legitimate policemen of
 the world?  If you, have no time to answer
 these questions, can you answer at least this
 one: how can I, as a responsible (or shall
 I  say  too-timorous-to-jump-on-the-barri-
 cades) citizen, best help the peace move-
 ment?                           Not being a wild-eyed radical ready
 to make a lot of noise, or a famous personal-
 ity who might command a modicum of re-
 spect, I feel quite helpless and yet categori-

 jingoist path to senseless destruction?

 BRONX, N.Y.,
 May 27, 1966.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am Writing to you
 With my view on the war against Viet Nam
 because you have taken a consistent and
 unequivocal stand in opposition to the war.
 During the past few months I have read
 many newspaper and magazine articles re-
 ferring to tortures and atrocities committed
 against prisoners of war and even civilians.
 I have seen color photographs of prisoners
 being tortured In magazines such as Life.
 And on May 23, the New York Times printed
 a photograph on page i of a soldier who had
 surrendered and was holding his hands above
 his head, but who was nevertheless shot a
 few seconds later by one of his captors.  Are
 there no laws of morality left in this coun-
 try?
 Furthermore, I believe that the use of
 noxious gases by the United States is a viola-
 tion of the Geneva Protocol of 1925.  I be-
 lieve that it is a crime to use chemical
 defoliants on the peoples' crops.  I think the
 dropping of napalm bombs will bring un-
 ending shame to this country.
 I strongly suspect that what the admin-
 istration describes as the bombing of stra-
 tegic military targets is, in fact, in many
 cases the bombing of innocent civilians.  I
 view with horror the photographs I have
 seen of our soldiers burning whole villages
 and leaving only desolation for the impover-
 ished peasants.  As a citizen I must speak out
 against what I believe is wrong and what I
 have seen of this war convinces me that my
 country is wrong.
 The situation is not entirely hopeless as
 long as there are men with your courage to
 remind the administration that what it is
 doing is immoral and evil.  I want to tell you
 how much I appreciate the show of bravery
 you have made in speaking out against a
 president who does not welcome opposing
 views.  I hope you will continue your neces-
 sary work until we see some indication that
 our leaders are more concerned with the prac-
 tice of democracy than with the winning of
 military victories.  History will record that
 at least one brave man was heard in the
 Congress at a time when the United States
 made a terrible mistake,
 Very sincerely yours,
 GEORGE W. COOKE.
 EL CERRrro, CALIF.,
 Senator WAYNE Moasz;       May 23,196
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR Sea: I cannot tell you what it means
 to me to have a spokesman in the Senate
 who keeps pounding away at the injustice of
 the Vietnam conflict.  Today we are fighting
 the Buddhists, the Viet Cong, and the North
 Vietnamese.  One wonders who is with us.
 In addition to my horror at our participa-
 tion in this war as a country, I have the prob-
 lem of two sons who oppose our action there.
 The older, aged twenty, is a junior at the
 University of California at Berkeley.  He has
 affiliated with groups opposing the war, but
 does not believe in militant opposition, sit-
 ins, or suport of communistic organizations
 which oppose the war.  Like me, the boys
 believe that if we had the support of the
 people in that country and could really stop
 communist aggression in the Far East, the
 war would make some sense.
 We are almost overwhelmed with the fu-
 tility of protest.  We are disheartened at
 the punishment dealt out to young men who
 refuse to serve in the armed services while
 such a war is in progress.
 This older son, Richard, will not return to
 College next semester.  He cannot sign up
 as a conscientious objector as he is not a
 paciflist and would fight to protect his coun-
 try or to protect other countries where the
 people support our participation.
 He will not join the armed services under
 the non-combat provision as he will not
 promote an unjust war in any way.  He
 would allow himself to be drafted and trained
 if not made to serve where the conflict is
 unjust,  but  we understand  that draftees
 have no choice.
 'We have read of other young men who
 have tried to act with integrity under the
 same circumstances.  One is serving a four
 year prison term and was fined $10,000.  In
 our own city, a fine young man has been
 sent to jail more than once for refusing to
 serve.  This seems like double jeopardy.
 Richard is convinced that he will be jailed
 in defense of his principles.  He is discour-
 aged of course.  I told him that there might
 be a possibility that he would not be jailed
 and that he should make some plans.  He
 replied that he could not do so as his plans
 might become so appealing to him and im-
 prisonment so hard to taste in comparison
 that he would sacrifice his ideals.
 It is a heartbreaking decision and he has
 made it.  The younger boy graduates from
 high school now and will be in college and
 able to avoid the issue for a while.  The
 thought of our older son in jail is almost
 too much to bear.  If I had my children to
 raise over again, I think that I might raise
 them to be tough and unfeeling.  They were
 taught ethics and kindliness from the start.
 Logical thought and sensitivity seem out of
 place In modern society.  Do you have any
 suggestions?
 Whether you answer or not, once again, my
 heartfelt appreciation for your courageous
 stand.
 Sincerely,
 Mrs. R. C. WILKINS.

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have watched your
 courageous and noble service in the Senate
 for some time.  Your firm position and that
 of a few others has challenged and en-
 couraged me to stand up to the apathy,
 ignorance, and prejudice surrounding a small
 minority in Kansas.
 1. have read your "Legal Issues of U.S.
 Position in Vietnam."  It is so clear that we
 are violating Constitutional and interna-
 tional laws by being in Vietnam.  It's such
 a let-down to know that decency and intel-
 ligence and justice have been replaced by
 the craven and mean.  That makes your
 leadership in Washington all the more im-
 portant.  I hope God spares you until the
 light of truth breaks  over the American
 people.
 The defeat of your Oregon candidate was
 deeply disappointing.
 I thank you sincerely for your untiring
 fight in trying to save our nation.  I hope
 we have not gone too far at this point and
 that our "cup is full".
 Very Sincerely,
 Los ANGELES, CALIF.,

 DEAR SIR: Just these few words to thank
 you for your splendid efforts In the cause of
 peace. Almost without exception everyone

 courageous crusade.  If ever there is a sequel

 you are sure to head the list.
 Respectfully,

 TOLEDO, OHIO,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I am writing this
 on my way to Columbus to hear Senator
 GRUENING and to take part in a march on
 the State House.
 I think every democrat should contrib-
 ute to Gov. Hatfield's campaign and thus
 follow your lead in supporting him.  My son
 is  returning  from  Somalia  after  serving
 two years in the Peace Corps. He graduated
 from the University of Oregon and is an
 Oregon voter.  He is very enthused by your
 leadership and sees the real work of the
 present generation as educating, helping &
 succoring rather than in destroying.
 Our movement is growing.  There was no
 Toledo Committee for a Reasonable Settle-
 ment last November.  There are 300 members
 with hundreds of others we have not "been
 Involved positively" yet.  We are very much
 encouraged but we have no hope that the
 President will listen until forced to polit-
 ically.

 Sue: Excuse the pencil please, since I feel
 it is no time to hunt for a pen.  I support
 your position on Vietnam.  And feel that
 the Administration is totally wrong.  Which
 is beside the point I am about to make.
 And  that is that-We should  call for     a
 constitutional amendment which would put
 a moratorium on all profits-in regards to
 war appropriations, or defense spending by
 the Government.  I am aware that the im-
 plications of this constitutional amendment
 are far reaching.   However I believe that
 to call for such an amendment at this time
 in history,  will have far reaching reper-
 cussions and get at the root of the con-
 tradictions of the administration.  They pro-
 fess to seek no wider war-so let them put
 their profits where there mouth IS.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I wish merely to ex-
 press my appreciation for your continued
 courageous efforts to critically assess our role
 and policies in Viet-Nam.  In wishing you
 success I am not only expressing my hope
 that an erroneous and immoral foreign policy
 nay be terminated, but also that the reason-

 faction with handling of specific affairs by
 the administration may retain an honored

 It is about time that the legislative branch
 of government recognize their responsibilities
 to the electorate and withhold from the Presi-
 dent the privilege of sending abroad our
 youth to die on foreign soil without our
 nation being wantonly attacked beforehand.
 Here, we send 250,000 men and billions of
 dollars to fight a war we cannot win, just
 as we did in Korea and yet a Communist
 pipsqueak-Fidel Castro defies us success-
 fully just 80 miles off our shoreline.
 My wife and I are the parents of 5 boys
 and girls (now parents themselves) who were
 involved in two previous wars and we are
 sick and tired of American involvement in
 the political wars of other nations.  Everyone
 of us would defend our shoreline with every
 drop of blood we possess but not one drop to
 defend foreign religious and political factions,
 in their internal disputes.
 I believe our views are those of the majority
 of Americans who have felt the pangs of war
 and see nothing but tragedy ahead in the
 present policy of U.S.A. Involvement in every
 part of the world.
 We have a responsibility to those unborn
 to leave to them a nation-free from bank-
 ruptcy and a national debt they cannot pos-
 sibly pay off.  If Congress would enact tax-
 ation to cover the cost of wars as they are
 being waged-there would be such a clamor
 from the American people to end the conflict
 immediately-the administration would be
 forced to act accordingly.
 Keep up the good work-you are truly a
 patriotic Senator-despite the opinion of the
 opposition.
 Sincerely your,
 ARTHUR It. ROBINSON.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have recently read
 with great care your statement to the Senate
 in the Congressional Record of March 17,
 1966 which was kindly forwarded to me by
 Mr. Big Rosenblum of New York City.  Since
 the statement was made, the situation in
 Vietnam has only deteriorated further.   I
 thoroughly agree that in respect to foreign
 policy our President and politicians have
 betrayed and failed us.
 What seems to me to be equally frustrating
 is that even through the ballot there appears
 to be so little the public can do to alter
 the  situation.  The candidates for public
 office, on the whole, seem to prefer to vie
 with one another in display of their "patriot-
 ism" and support of administration policies
 rather than to take a position based on
 morality and, in this case, common sense.
 The sad truth that the administration has
 failed to realize is that dishonesty and im-
 morality in national policy abroad is gener-
 ating similar degeneracy here at home.  For
 this, I fear, history will judge the present
 administration harshly.  I am proud of your
 stand and outspoken criticism and wish to
 express my support of your position.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: We would like to call
 your attention to the enclosed copy of an
 advertisement placed recently by the Wilton
 Friends Meeting to express support of the
 traditional Quaker stand against violence of
 any kind.
 Though this is a well-known statement of
 the position of Quakers, we feel there is a
 particular necessity for its re-emphasis today.
 We appreciate the courageous stand you
 have taken in this matter.
 Sincerely yours,
 MISS MARGARET A. PICKETT,
 Chairman, Peace and Service Committee.
 [From the Wilton monthly meeting of the
 Religious Society of Friends]
 A QUAKER STATEMENT ABOUT WAR
 Today, in these troubled times, we would
 like to share the following messages with
 our neighbors:
 A declaration from the harmless and inno-
 cent people of God, called Quakers, presented
 to Charles II, 1660.
 We utterly  deny all outward  wars and
 strife, and fightings with outward weapons,
 for any end, or under any pretense whatso-
 ever;  this is our testimony to the  whole
 world.  The Spirit of Christ, by which we
 are guided, is not changeable, so as once
 to command us from a thing as evil, and
 again to move unto it;  and we certainly
 know, and testify to the world, that Spirit
 of Christ, which leads us into all truth, will
 never move us to fight and war against any
 man with outward weapons, neither for the
 Kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of
 the world ... Therefore, we cannot learn
 war any more.
 The Wilton Peace Minute, from Wilton
 monthly meeting to Friends everywhere, 1960.
 It is now 300  years since Friends first
 declared "we cannot learn war any more."
 Now as then, the spirit of Jesus Christ can
 never move us to violence, neither in per-
 sonal conflict nor in public life.  His way
 leads only to peace with all men. His way
 is opened by that of God in every man; and
 by the helping hand of God available to all.
 Today, His way can save the world. Though
 every individual owes loyalty to the state,
 he owes higher loyalty to the inner light
 that is of God.  And so with special urgency
 we invite all who hear to utterly renounce
 war-now the real and final enemy of man-
 and daily to seek ways to practice the life
 that knows no occasion for war, and to learn
 the ways of peace without which all men
 perish,
 Friends, like so many others, believe that
 war brings only misery.  War does not-and
 never has-led to permanent achievement
 of freedom, justice and security.  Even when

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD--: SENATE             June 2, 1966
 the Issue is righteous and conflict seems
 justified there are higher and more effective
 ways than violence to oppose evil. War
 begets only war.
 Friends have found, by long experiment,
 that suspicion, distrust, fear, and violence
 itself, are healed only by the reconciling
 power of love.
 We urge all men and women whose hearts
 are sickened by the suffering of war victims
 to join us in prayer and constructive work
 for peace.

 READING, PA.,
 May 26, 1966.
 MY DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Thank you for
 waging such a vigorous and dynamic cam-
 paign in the furtherance of the interest of
 peace in this world.  It is encouraging in-
 deed to see men of such original American
 independence  and   such  courageous  un-
 daunted faith "stand up" and proclaim the
 truth to the American people.
 There are, indeed, many things of ques-
 tionable character in the conduct of the
 war in Viet Nam-about this there seems
 to be little question indeed in the minds
 of most all of your fellow Americans.  There
 is undoubtedly great restiveness pervading
 the Ameircan people at the present time,
 and Viet Nam and the many undesirable
 things occurring there are one of the great-
 est topics of discussion of the present time
 and the American people are crying out in
 anguish against the present conduct of af-
 fairs relating to the Viet Nam situation.
 All these distorted views, etc., presented
 by the advocates of further involvement and
 further advocates of carnage and radicalism,
 bespeak not of a free structure-but invari-
 ably are closely synonimous with the very
 dictatorial ideals against which we free peo-
 ple in America have so long been in opposi-
 tion.
 You have presented, a true challenge to
 the entire problem and have truthfully at-
 tempted to expose that which needs expo-
 sure, and your attempt at truthfullness is
 most certainly deeply appreciated both by
 your constituents as well as by grave men
 everywhere.
 Kindest regards.
 Sincerely yours,
 ARLINGTON, 28,1VA.,966.
 HOD. WAYNE MORSE,                           May
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have just finished
 reading excerpts from your speech on The
 President and Vietnam, from the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD of May 16, 1966 and I want to
 extend my congratulations.
 I feel that the American people are ex-
 tremely fortunate to have a Senator, like
 yourself, who is courageous enough to speak-
 out against the President and this Admin-
 istration who listen only to the voices of the
 Hawks, constantly tells us how hard they
 are working for Peace yet continues to es-
 calate our troops in Vietnam, and gives
 whole-hearted support to General Ky.
 I worked hard to get President Johnson
 elected because Mr. Goldwater continually
 talked war during the campaign, while Mr.
 Johnson assured us that if he were elected
 there would be no war.  Since the President
 was not honest during his campaign, I don't
 believe him now when I hear him say he is
 working day and night for a peaceful solu-
 tion to end the war., I agree fully with you
 when you say "the President must be stopped
 with ballots, for it is the only way left to
 stop his bullets".
 Already, I am being urged to vote for this
 man and that man in the coming State elec-
 tions.                                                                            I have resolved to find out from each
 candidate whom I might be interested in,
 how he stands on the Vietnam issue.  If he
 supports the President and the Administra-
 tion, he loses my support.  For the first time
 in the many years that I have been voting
 the Democratic ticket, the coming elections
 might prove the exception, and it is even
 possible that for the first time r will have'
 to forego my vote if there is no difference
 in the candidates positions.  I can assure
 you that my vote will not send to Congress
 any man or women who will rubber-stamp
 the President in carrying on this Vietnamese
 disaster.
 Thank you for again speaking-out and
 sharing your feelings and your ideas with
 the American people.

 PRESIDENT  JOHNSON:   For  nearly  twelve
 years the United States has been pursuing a
 course of improvised disaster in Vietnam.
 The time has now come for concerned citi-
 zens to protest the apparent hypocrisy of
 their government.
 We claim to be in Vietnam at the invita-
 tion of a beleaquered government, but that
 government, like its sixteen predecessors
 since 1954, is our creature, and could not :have
 been established, nor could it long survive
 Without American force.
 We claim to desire self-determination for
 the Vietnamese people, but this claim hardly
 has the ring of truth, since the war is a
 result of our refusal to allow the elections
 stipulated by the Geneva Accords of 1954.
 We claim to desire no bases in Vietnam,
 but the bases are being built.
 We claim to desire a negotiated peace, but
 we have steadfastly refused to negotiate with
 the people whom we are fighting-the Na-
 tional Liberation Front.
 We claim to fear Chinese aggressiveness,
 when  the presence  of  235,000 American
 soldiers In Vietnam would suggest that we
 might more reasonably fear our own.
 We claim to be in Vietnam to protect the
 Vietnamese from aggression, but our use of
 toxic chemicals, napalm and torture, and the
 large numbers of non-cwnbatant dead indi-
 cate that the South Vietnamese need protec-
 tion from their friends rather than their
 ..enemies,"

 with the lofty aims which we claim to pur-
 sue.  We, therefore, vehemently urge that
 the government take such steps as are nec-
 essaxy to extricate the United States from
 what can only become an increasingly cyni-
 cal and increasingly hazardous attempt to
 pursue American interests at the expense
 of the suffering people of Vietnam.

 Hon. WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  The enclosed clip-
 pings were printed in today's Oregonian.
 They reflect the growing concern of Orego-
 nians and of the whole nation about the
 Vietnam war.  Most of them express their
 confidence in you that you so richly deserve.
 I hope that in reading these you will find
 renewed faith in the voting public and re-
 newed vigor in your battle to present the
 facts about the other side of the Vietnam
 war.
 I am a college student who opposes a war
 that is unconstitutional, to begin with, but
 is also stupid, cruel and wasteful of lives and
 educational (etc.) monies.
 Most of the people I talk to at college are
 in support,of you, Senator MORSE.  Though
 we are silent, shy to write letters and reluc-
 tant to start calling names.  I am sure you
 realize that we admire and respect what you
 are doing.  The Senators KENNEDY and FUL-
 BRIGHT, Dr. Benjamin Spock, and the count-
 less educators, clergymen and citizens who
 agree with you about Vietnam think of you
 as an honest and most courageous man.
 In short, continue your fight.  As these
 clippings 'show, there is a growing number
 of citizens who support you to the hilt.
 Why must good men like Senators MORSE
 and FULBRIGHT be persecuted?  They are the
 best Americans of all.

 To the EDITOR:
 Johnson's claim that the use of power in-
 volves agony reminds one of the parent who
 insists to his child, "This hurts me worse
 than it hurts you," and then proceeds to lay
 on the club.  Such an excuse for violence is
 disgusting in a parent and it is equally dis-
 gusting in a President.
 Of course, it could be that the agony re-
 sults from his conscience.   If that is the
 case, let him make some genuine effort to
 end this brutal war against the Asian people
 and to bring home the brave and innocent
 young  Americans  whose  lives  are  being
 wasted on a cause that is not only hopeless
 To the EDITOR:
 Your calling the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee's hearings a "sickening show" proves
 that there is none so blind as those that
 will not see.  Correct your myopic vision
 and take a good look at Viet Nam if you
 are to see a real sick and insane drama being
 enacted.  Our only hope in getting the cur-
 tain down on this sad and infamous specta-
 cle is by honorable and courageous men such
 as Senators MORSE and FULBRIGHT.
 I sincerely feel sorry for Secretary Rusk
 as he hopelessly tries to justify this comedy
 of errors by repetitiously parroting these
 words: "We are in Viet Nam at the request
 of the South Vietnamese government."  My
 greatest concern though is for the 250,000
 of our young men over there who cannot
 help but wonder which, if any, government
 they are jeopardizing their lives for.
 I believe the people of Oregon are the most
 intelligent electorate in the nation and will
 never, sen& a senator or representative to
 Washington again who will permit such a
 small group in government to precipitate
 such a crisis as Viet Nam without question-
 ing every ramification that it may create.
 We are fortunate to have such choices in
 men such as Howard Morgan, Mark Hatfield
 To the EDrroR:
 My Voter's Pamphlet states that Robert
 Duncan "firmly supports our nation's policy
 of resisting Communist aggression without
 becoming involved in a nuclear third world
 war."
 Political hogwash.  Who of us wants nu-
 clear war?  But, we are heading in that
 direction faster than most of us realize.
 Our nation's policy? If the United States
 has a defensible policy for Americans killing
 Asians (on their own soil) and vice versa, I
 have yet to hear of it.
 Can Mr. Rusk or Mr. Duncan tell us how
 American fighting men can distinguish a
 Viet Cong man from a South Vietnamese?
 Press pictures show both to be undernour-
 ished and childish looking.
 Two warring factions never filled anybody's
 empty belly.  If these people feel a Viet Cong
 victory will benefit their wretched condi-
 tion, can we blame them for fighting the op-
 position?  No matter which faction wins the
 poor will be as wretched as before.

 To the EDITOR : Why do you depict Senators MORSE and
 FULBRIGHT as hooded Klansmen?  Why do
 you belittle these men?
 It is not they whom you are trying to
 silence, it is the millions of people in the
 United States who dare to question our over-
 bearing, militaristic foreign policy.
 You are shutting off debate by making
 Viet Nam opposition unpatriotic (unpopu-
 lar).  Only those with independent financial
 means can afford to speak out in opposition.
 We used to refer to these tactics as "dirty

 PEACE WITH HONOR
 To the EDrroR:
 ROBERT DUNCAN'S position is firm support
 of Mr. Johnson's present Viet policy, includ-
 ing the refusal to negotiate with the Viet
 Cong.  But this refusal rules out meaning-
 ful negotiations and makes our present pol-
 icy, with its repeated escalations of the war,
 a policy which in fact seeks a military solu-
 tion of the problem in Viet Nam.  Pursuit
 of this policy of military victory will require
 increasing commitments of U.S. troops due
 to the stepped-up infiltration of regular Vieli
 troops from the north and to the steady
 deterioration of the South Viet army as an
 effective fighting force (it had 100,000 deser-
 tions last year).  It is hard to believe that
 China will not be forced eventually to enter
 this conflict.   (Imagine our reaction if the
 Chinese were fighting a war in Mexico or
 Guatemala, 250,000 troops on the ground,
 Chinese planes occasionally straying across
 the U.S. border.)
 One could agree with Mr. DUNCAN'S desire
 to contain Chinese power and influence, and
 yet insist that U.S. Involvement in a massive
 land war in Asia will defeat that purpose.
 Howard Morgan has made clear his opposi-
 tion to the present policy of seeking a mili-
 tary solution to what is essentially a political
 problem. He insists that both U.S. and Viet-
 namese interests will best be served by estab-
 lishment of a politically independent Viet
 Nam  government.   To promote a climate
 conducive to political reconstruction, Morgan
 would de-escalate both the air and ground
 war, and agree to include all belligerents in
 negotiations.  To this reader, Morgans Viet
 policies offer the best chance for the U.S.
 disengaging itself honorably from a hopeless
 military conflict in Asia.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  This IS to tell you
 that I am back of you in all you are saying
 and doing to try to stop this sacrifice of
 young Americans in that sea of human cor-
 ruption that is Viet Nam.
 One of the things I have to teach my
 class is the psychology of leadership.  They
 study that there are three types of leader-
 ship: Authoritarian
 Laissez-faire
 Democratic
 We are now testing which type we, indeed,
 have in the United States.  Surely if it is
 democratic, as we hope and pray it is, voices
 like mine all over the country will be heard.
 I am a patriotic American whose family
 has been in all of the wars in which the
 United States has taken part, and one mem-
 ber lies buried in Arlington.  I am a con-
 servative,-not a pacifist, and it goes without
 saying-not a Communist. This war in Viet
 Nam is, to my mind, aiding the Communists
 for it is capable of wearing us out (as one
 of the steps of Lenin foretold).  The corrup-
 tion on ALL sides there makes our partici-
 pation a form of mass insanity.
 May your efforts succeed in awakening the
 American people and arousing them to ac-
 tion that will be listened to by those in high
 places.
 Sincerely yours,
 DR. PORTIA HAMILTON.
 To the EDITOR:
 As I hear the reports and see the pictures
 of the people being killed in Viet Nam it just
 doesn't seem to make sense to me.  It does
 not somehow seem right that the most pow-
 erful nation on earth should be sending the
 mightiest sea, air and artillery power against
 such small, desperately poor people, many of
 whom are utterly illiterate and ignorant of
 the so-called civilized world.
 Why shouldn't we let them alone, or let
 them all vote-north and south-as planned
 in the Geneva Convention of 1954?  We say
 they are Communist, but the Japanese pho-
 tographer who interviewed the second in
 command, who some say is more powerful
 than Ho Chi Minh, says he is not Communist
 at all but "economic socialist."
 But supposing l;Ie is Communist.  We are
 not shooting and killing the 40 per cent in
 Italy who voted Communist, nor the Com-
 munists or economic socialists In France, in
 the Scandinavian countries, nor in India,
 China, Russia, Albania, etc.  The slaughter
 of these wretched Orientals seems especially
 wrong to me, as a Christian.
 To love a child-and as I see these people
 they are as ignorant little children-we must
 not spoil them, no.   But to bomb their
 bridges, highways, power plants, railways, to
 kill them in such numbers with the greatest
 air and sea power, napalm, mortar fire of the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 2, 1966
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Hurrah for the cour-
 age you show.              I could say many things
 but you know it all and would be a waste
 of time for both of us.  My children know
 of no young men who have any desire to
 fight in Viet-Nam.  One young man we
 know has served in Santo Domingo as a
 Para-trooper.  He would have stayed in the
 service and made it his career, but he did
 not wish to risk being sent to another hole
 such as Viet-Nam.  It isn't a lack of patriot-
 ism as they are willing to defend and fight
 for our country but to go where we're de-
 spised and not wanted.
 Every war we fight, the common man hears
 it rumored that we are fighting for the rich
 business men who have holdings of some
 kind in these countries, but of course will
 never sure as patriotism as the lack of it
 is always pushed down our throats.  I've
 often heard it said if these 40 to 50 year old
 men had to go to  fight the wars there
 wouldn't be any.
 Thank you.
 Sincerely
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SIB: I have been listening to your
 speeches and hope you keep up the good
 work.  I just can't think that anything In
 south east Asia is worth one of our boys'
 lives. I believe we should help the people in
 our own country to vote, to get jobs and
 decent wages and houses to live in.  There
 are more people than you realize that agree
 withyour views.  Most mothers of boys sure
 do and I hope that we get out of this ter-
 rible war.
 Sincerely
 Mrs. H. J. FRAHM.
 Senator MORSE: I thought I'd take time
 out from studies to applaud your stand on
 our Vietnam policy.  I'm sorry to hear that
 they don't heed yours and Senator FvL-
 BRIGHT's warnings (recent boost in our troop
 commitment).     Perhaps  history  will  re-
 member that there were a few sane "peace-
 niks" attempting to stop the flow of world
 blood.  However, history has been kindest
 to the war mongers, both "good and bad"
 if such a significance is possible.
 I have found that those pepole who sup-
 port the war, support it for the wrong rea-
 sons.  I've never had the privilege of carry-
 ing a sign-frankly I've been too busy with
 studies-however,  I'd rather be  labeled a
 "beatnik" than a "warnik."   A revolution
 or insurgency must have the support of the
 people and after twenty years it would seem
 logical that we might get the hint.  The
 ugly American is on stage again, taking an-
 other bow.  Please, sir, make yourself heard.

 To the American people, world's people

 your success rests their fragile fate.
 I often wonder how the Nazis would have
 fared If someone had taken them on the
 way you have.  I can understand why they
 call you the "Tiger of the Senate."
 I am doing what I can on my level to help
 get us out of the war.
 It is a pleasure to be living in your gen-

 DEAR SIR: I am an American voter living
 in Canada.  I am a student and, a teaching
 fellow at the University of Toronto.  I would
 like to add my voice to yours in protest of
 President Johnson's policy in Vietnam. Alone
 I feel helpless in the face of the President's
 arrogant refusal to recognize criticism.  My
 first letter to the President went unacknowl-
 edged.  My second letter was forwarded to
 the American Consulate in Toronto.        The
 Consul sent me a letter explaining that he
 appreciated my concern and that the Pres-
 ident was also concerned.
 I am more than concerned.  I am angry.
 I feel betrayed by the President's actions.
 His actions are inconsistent with his cam-
 paign promises.  I feel frightened that one
 man can possess so much power in a demo-
 cracy.  I think that Mr. Johnson has trans-
 gressed his legal power as Commander-in-
 Chief of the Armed Forces.  His refusal to
 recognize criticism is an arrogant misuse of
 power. His name calling is beneath the dig-
 nity of the office of the Presidency.  i am
 not it "nervous nelIie" and I hope you point
 this out to the President of "all the people."

 DEAR Sin: I wish to compliment you for the
 conscience and fortitude you displayed dur-
 ing the Senate Committee hearing (televised
 the evening of May-11) when Mr. McNamara
 was interrogated.  I deeply appreciate the
 disturbance that you,  Mr.  FULBRIGHT  and
 others are making at this time.
 There  are  "computer men"  who       walk
 among us as humans.   (Are they repro-
 ducing?                                                                                                                                         Heaven forbid!)
 Mr. McNamara's case is one of mistaken
 identity. He thought  he  could     charge
 through like a knight of old, armed with a
 computer, and the war would be won by
 precision. Now he continues to face his ad-
 versary because he is afraid to turn his back
 and run.
 A "simple-minded" solution for the war is
 this: retreat and make "enclaves" and then
 evacuate all who wish to leave.  This would
 be more soulful than war, and certainly more
 economical of everything, even if it took
 more than a year to accomplish it.
 Here is a quote I think pertinent in this
 situation: ""  s * it is not America but
 Russia, holding vast lands once belonging to
 the Middle Kingdom, who has most to fear
 a clash with an aggressive China."

 they have boys in the service.  I have two

 I have read in our paper where our boys
 have been cut short on materials, and weap-
 ons.        We seem to be short of planes and
 bombs.
 What is our committment to this country?
 They have no form of government.  Are our
 boys dying for nothing?  If our boys die one
 at a time what will this solve in this country?
 This war is not ours, this is needless blood-
 shed and loss of our boys lives.             Each and
 every boy is precious to their families. They
 deserve the chance to live and have families
 of their own.
 I have heard your views on Viet Nam and
 I hope you know that most of the people that
 I know share your views.  Help us to stop
 this needless slaughter of our boys.  Surely
 there is another way to help these people
 without the needless death of our boys.   If
 this war is necessary then we should not hold
 back on the bombs,  Bomb the strategic
 places like Hanoi.

 "DEAR PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We would like
 to register our opposition as citizens of the
 United States and as human beings, to this
 country's role in the present conflicts in
 Viet Nam.  We oppose our open support of
 the military, anti-constitutional government
 of General Ky against the National Libera-
 tion Front, and our tacit, indirect support
 of Ky against the Buddhists who are seeking
 constitutional government.   (Ky could not
 combat the Buddhists so successfully without
 the military equipment provided him by the
 U.S. Government.)
 "The brutal war we are waging against the
 National Liberation Front (NLF) and North
 Viet Nam (we make a distinction) are mor-
 ally and legally wrong, and diplomatically
 and tactically damaging this country's do-
 In any case, we have created a situation in
 which Ky's government is as much hated as
 the NLF by anti-communists like the Budd-
 hists, which comprise a majority of the na-
 tion's population.
 "2. We are provoking Communist China by
 repeated bombings of North Viet Nam, closer
 and closer to the Chinese border.  This does
 not even take into account the fact that
 these bombings have not brought us military
 victory.  We must consider also the crudity
 and illegality of bombing North Vietnam,
 Laos, and Cambodia, which have never been
 proven indispensible and sole sustainers of
 the NLF in South Vietnam.
 "3. We are retarding relations with Russia
 and with France, a potential friend and a
 former one, by persisting in these aggressive
 actions in S.E. Asia.
 "4. The war has retarded social progress
 domestically, holding back the two primary
 programs of your administration, the Poverty
 Program and the Civil Rights Program.
 "5. By escalating the war and by bombing
 North Vietnam, you have betrayed the voters
 who elected you instead of Barry Goldwater
 because you supposedly stood for fair-minded
 political action and a minimum of military
 action in South Vietnam.
 "6. You  have  betrayed  the  voters  who
 favored your liberal and humanitarian pro-
 gram of social legislation at home.  To us,
 it is the nation's disgrace that Medicare and
 the Civil Rights Act, and the War on Poverty,
 should be accompanied by a war on Vietnam
 which  obliterates human rights,  increases
 poverty and suffering. The acts at home are
 constructive and laudable, and will give your
 administration an honored place in this na-
 tion's history for generations.  But the acts
 of war abroad have already made your na-me
 and administration infamous to many, and
 the damage done to our national reputa-
 tion,                                                                 to the U.N.,  to international  diplo-
 ma tic relations In Europe as well as Asia, and
 to the Vietnamese people will take as many
 generations to rectify.
 "We support the statements of Senators
 FULBRIGHT,  MORSE, and  KENNEDY,  and all
 others who have spoken out against the War.
 We ask:
 "1. That you cease immediately the bomb-
 ing of North Vietnam.
 "2..That you initiate no more attacks on
 the NLF In the South.
 "3. That you hinge your military support
 of Ky on his guarantees of elections Sep-
 tember 12, and his promise not to destroy

 DEAR SENATOR: This senseless war in Viet
 Nam is the most terrible thing that has ever
 happened to our country.  It is none of our
 business what the countries of Asia do.
 The power to send troops to foreign lands
 and to get us into war, should be taken
 away from the President and restored to
 Congress, where our Constitution placed it.
 The people of Viet Nam have their own
 ideas of how to live and cannot understand
 anything different.  Of course they all want
 the money we so lavishly pour in.
 I am seventy years old and am more wor-
 ried about the fate of our country than ever
 before.
 I thank you for trying to get us out of this
 mess.  I am a native of Oregon and am proud
 to think that the representative of that state
 is making such a good fight.
 All of the hand-outs the President can
 make does not compensate for the loss of our
 wonderful young men.  They are like sheep
 led to be slaughtered,

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR: I would like to express my
 support of the position you have taken con-
 cerning United States foreign policy, espe-
 cially in Vietnam.  Your courageous deter-
 mination in speaking out against whatever
 you believe to be wrong will, I hope, continue.
 Thank you for putting your country's future
 ahead of your own political future.
 And thank you, thank you for your recent
 observation that were John F. Kennedy our
 president today, he most probably would not
 have us in this unholy mess!   I became
 annoyed when editorialists claim that there
 is no difference between the Johnson and
 what would have been the Kennedy policy.
 In fact, I see grounds for the impeachment
 of President Johnson for his total disregard
 of the constitution concerning declaration of
 war.  Also, his claim that we are preserving
 freedom for the people of Asia (by burning
 and bombing them and their villages and
 supporting a military dictator whose hero is
 Hitler) sickens me.
 Again, I urge you to continue your opposi-
 tion to our presence in Vietnam.
 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 U.S. Senate,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I endorse your stand
 on our position in the Vietnam war and think
 it is wonderful that the United States Senate
 has such an able spokesman for liberalism.
 The American people welcome the debate
 and investigation of the awesome issues of
 this terrible dilemma.
 Sincerely yours,

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE:  We wish to thank

 I'm just now hearing reports on radio tell-

 Why can't you be instrumental in doing
 something about this useless killing. I'd say
 pull out & settle with talks, negotiations

 Senator WAYNE MORSE,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. MORSE: I am in complete agree-
 ment with your views on the war in Viet
 Nam.  I am thankful that there are still
 men, like you, around-who can view situa-
 tions of this nature, realistically, placing the
 security of our own nation in first place.
 I find, however, that my own objections
 are a little bit different than yours.  So I
 am sending you this letter that I am also
 sending to the Denver Post, in the hopes
 that you may find in it a germ of an idea
 that can be used to defend your position.
 These are not only my views, but repre-
 sent the views of my 23 year old son, and
 his friends, who have fought in that war
 in Viet Nam.  They know what those people
 are like, from their own experiences with
 them.  They believe the cause to be hope-
 less and feel deeply discouraged with our
 commitment to defend all of Asia.  From
 their point of view, this could involve the
 rest of their lives and the lives of their chil-
 dren, as well-if Americans could last that
 long.
 I wish, with all of my heart, that you, or
 someone like you, could be our president.
 Thank you.
 Mrs. BERNICE R. HOWE.
 "LITTLETON, COLO., May 26,1966.
 "Aren't we kidding ourselves about the
 war in Viet Nam?
 "While President Johnson states and re-
 states with monotonous regularity that we
 must stop the Communists in Viet Nam to
 prevent them from taking over all of Asia,
 Raul Castro, Cuban Armed Forces Minister,
 determines to redouble Cuban's aid to Com-
 munists revolutions in the belief that these
 revolutions  are  the  Achilles  heel  of  the
 United States.    (Rocky Mountain News ar-
 ticle, page 3, May 24, 1966)
 "Mr. Johnson seems to be under the im-
 pression that when and if the Communists
 realize that they cannot take over South
 Viet Nam by force, they will somehow or
 other be intimidated or discouraged from
 further  aggression  in  other  countries.   I
 wonder why it has not occurred to Mr. John-
 son that we have already forced the Com-
 munists to realize that they could not win
 in Korea, Berlin, and    . we did show them
 that they could not bring those missiles into
 Cuba.  They were not intimidated by these
 experiences with our determination, yet, Mr.
 Johnson asks us to forget the past and be-
 lieve that this time it is going to be differ-
 ent.  This time the Communists are going
 to learn their lesson, once and for all.
 "But, if we stop to view this situation from
 Maj. Castro's point of view, it does seem
 that It might be much more profitable for
 the Communist world powers to involve the
 Americans in a series of small wars rather
 than risk their own manpower, their own
 economic resources, and especially their own
 reputations in one Big War.
 "If this were their intention, they could
 instigate little wars in all of these 39 other
 countries that we are now obligated to de-
 fend.                                                                   If they could keep a war going In each
 of these countries for as short a time as three
 years per country, they could keep us pretty
 busy for the next 117 years.  While we were
 expending our strengths in these wars, the
 Communists would have more than sufficient
 time to develop their home projects, es-
 pecially their space projects, and we could
 wake up one morning to discover that we
 were being controlled by a "Man in the
 Moon"  and  that  man  would not  be an
 American.
 "It seems to me that we must stop, some-
 where along the line, take a clear, hard, cold
 look at our 'enemy' and wonder if we are not
 playing this game just exactly the way he
 wants it played.
 "It seems to me, that we must stop, some-.
 where along the line, and evaluate this situa-
 tion from different points of view, consider-
 ing other methods of dealing with this prob-
 lem or we could wake up one morning and
 discover ourselves to be so weakened from a
 long series of little wars that the Commu-
 nists have won by default.
 "I, personally, do not believe that the Com-
 munists plan to stop when the war in Viet
 Nam is over, I personally, do not believe that
 the Communists care whether or not they
 win or lose the war.  I believe that their
 purpose was served when the first American
 dollar was spent and the First American boy
 died over there.
 "Even as we sit here wondering about it all,
 I suspect that the Communists are already
 planning their next adventure.  Where will
 it be?  They have a pretty wide choice.  We
 may have Thailand and Malaysia well pro-
 tected, but that leaves India, Egypt, Israel,
 Cuba, South America.
 "Let's face the hard, cold, revolting facts.
 If we are going to commit our military and
 our economy to every Communist-instigated
 revolution that comes along, the Communists
 are going to have us dancing.  Just like the
 old-time Western bully could keep the town
 drunk dancing by shooting bullets around
 his  feet,  the Communists  could keep  us
 dancing by Instigating revolutions.
 "And, just as that town drunk would be
 considered a fool if he felt victorious for hav-
 ing avoided all of the bullets, I think we are
 kidding  ourselves  if  we believe,  for one
 moment, that a victory in Viet Nam is a real
 victory over Communism.

 The entire Vietnam situation has been a
 series of errors in judgment (misjudgment is
 human) but instead of rectifying these er-

 along trying to cover them up by applying
 more force.  Unfortunately this force means
 heavy loss of life on all sides.  Like it or not
 we are the hand that is manipulating the

 just be telling a falsehood.  And I would
 not go out to embarrass my son to fill out
 papers to that effect.   I have had many
 problems which works a hardship on me.
 But this is the worst problem I've had to
 try to get through with.  Senator MORSE,
 mothers' hearts are aching and bleeding all
 over the world tonight because of this war
 in Viet Nam.  When I sat before my tele-
 vision, and watched a film of the bloody
 riot in Da Nang tonight reported by Ron
 Nessin, our reporter there, and saw and
 heard mothers screaming and crying over
 their little children who had been shot to
 death, plus many more heartbreaking scenes.
 God help us and help us quickly to get out
 of Viet Nam.  You would be surprised to
 hear that in such a small community where
 I live, people are talking of demonstrations
 in Washington.  I would  never  think of
 coming to Washington as a demonstrator.
 But I'm appealing to you, if you have any
 Influence in the White House, to ask Presi-
 dent Johnson not to send my son to Viet
 Nam.  And to bring those boys who are
 already there home.  God has been so good
 to us as a nation, but so help me, if we
 go over there to kill and plunder like is going
 on over  there,  destroying life,  and their
 homes, some day we will suffer because God
 promised it.  And It will come to our home-
 land.  Just what is happening over there.

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: Enclosed copy of a
 letter I have just sent President Johnson
 regarding the Draft and. Viet Nam.  When
 I lived in Beaverton, Oregon I supported
 you, not because I completely agreed with
 you but because I felt you did have the
 courage of your convictions and were and

 Man-I still reel the same.
 I'm a salesman, contacting and conversing
 with people at many levels and degrees of
 thinking and intelligence, you could say the
 mass or group who are the heart of our
 country.  You are right this great mass are
 rapidly changing their attitude on Viet Nam,
 the Draft, Poverty Program, Great Society,
 etc. and if national elections could be held
 right now the Administration would be in
 for a shock.  Unless it's done by a Master,
 people will only be sheep for so long and I
 think that's happening now, the sheep are
 returning to people, glib words won't do.
 Last Week, House Furnishing Daily, a Fair-
 childs Publication published a story on A.I.D.
 to Viet Nam.  The reporter really laid it out
 and we are apparently grossly undermanned
 and mismanaged and supporting the Viet
 Cong along with everyone else in food, drugs,
 and clothing.
 I listened and read President Johnson,
 Mr, Rusk, Mr. McNamara and quite a few
 more but they're. not reaching me with the
 old platitudes and worn out phrases.  I'm
 not against military service, strong defense
 or help for anyone who needs it but watch-
 ing the newscasts from Viet Nam and the
 action of the various factions I'd like some-
 one in Government to explain in language
 we could understand, why we're over there
 and why we're staying over there-I don't

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: The American peo-

 continued courageous voice in opposition to
 the outrageous war we are waging In Viet-
 nam.
 Thank you very much.
 Sincerely yours,
 MICHAEL Tosser.
 DEAR SENATOR: Today I heard the latest
 casualty list of this undeclared war.   146
 dead and 820 wounded.
 When I read or hear something on the
 radio or TV on what your views are on this
 undeclared war I am in agreement with you.
 I to, do not believe our government has
 any right  supporting  a  military  regime,
 which is not an elected government of the
 people.  Backing Ky as we are, is the same
 as asking ourselves in.
 I believe there would be more opposition
 to this undeclared war but for One reason:
 The  average  person does not  read  the
 newspapers (as he should) or listen to news
 broadcasts or read extensively.  Some way
 must be found to reach this type of person.
 They do not really care about this undeclared
 war as long as it does not include or affect
 them.
 What would happen if the hearings were
 re-opened and the people were to hear wit-
 nesses on the following:
 1. What is the estimated cost to our gov-
 ernment that will have to be paid out to
 South Viet Nam in reparations?  (Repara-

 SENATOR: I believe that after hearing some
 of Sec. U Thants recent speech it might be
 a good time to press for some sort of peace
 talks through the UN.  I think that world
 opinion must be very strong against as at
 this time.  Given the Buddist civil war and
 their clear call to all the world to get the U,S.
 off their backs the time is ripe to make a
 real effort in the UN to stop this war.  I
 think that U Thant was clearly asking the
 American people to take a stand and demand
 that this war be stopped.
 Senator Morse, what this country is do-
 ing in Viet Nam is a disgrace.  I am so
 ashamed of my country it just sickens me.
 Is there no way to stop this administra-
 tion?
 Its clear to most anyone that this country
 is looking for a pretext to start a war with
 China. Then this country will have had it.

 KNOW WHERE TO TURN,
 most of the people feel whether their sons are

 Why should we police the world?   The
 function of the military is to defend our

 IDEALISTIC AND PRACTICAL
 BEAVERTON, OREG.
 To the EDITOR:
 I am a conscientious objector, age 53.  I
 object to the present foreign policy of my
 country and to the war we are waging in
 Viet Nam.
 I qm the father of two girls and four boys
 and anticipate my first son-in-law within
 six weeks.  I believe in and enjoy the teen-
 agers and young people of our community,
 state, and country.  I object vigorously to
 the sacrifice of these young men in support
 of a policy that cannot win.
 My objections are based on principles that
 are both idealistic and practical in philoso-
 phy.
 In my opinion we are faced with three al-
 ternatives in Viet Nam.  All discussion and
 all policy must relate to three choices.  Un-
 fortunately- we are letting our governmental
 officials avoid facing up to these alternatives
 which are as follows:
 (1) Smash all those who would resist us in
 Viet Nam.  Bomb them, kill them, destroy
 them until they yield to our command, our
 will, our purpose, and our plans for them.
 Ultimately in pursuit of this alternative we
 may have to cross the border into China to
 impose  our will  on  the  Chinese.  Smash
 them.   Our will must prevail.   Our flag
 over all is the ultimate in this direction. I
 believe that it is agreed that we cannot ac-
 complish these goals.                         -
 (2) Fight until we can negotiate a treaty
 and draw a line which we can defend from
 now until doomsday.  We are defending a
 line in Germany, in Korea, and a perimeter
 in the Caribbean.  We have taken upon our-
 selves the function of policing the world and
 responding in force to every conflagration
 in the world.  We can't win this way either.
 There is no end to this way.
 (3) The third alternative to which a grow-
 ing number of people are subscribing is to
 get out of Viet Nam.  We recognize a host of
 objections and difficulties but we are sure
 that we must accomplish a complete and
 strategic retreat.
 The violent screams of shock of those who
 want to fight communism rend the air at this
 alternative.  Our question to them is, why,
 when there is apparently as much commu-
 nism in Cuba and South America as in Viet
 Nam, do we fight a war 10,000 miles away?
 Why did we not fight in Cuba?
 We are not going to win even though we
 bomb and bomb and finally smash and wreck
 this little country of Viet Nam.
 It is not our purpose as a country to rule
 the world.  If we are enlightened as some of
 our politicians claim, it is not practical or
 idealistic to share our enlightenment via the

 DEAR SENATOR MORSE: I have never before
 written to a Senator from a state other than
 my own.  But I felt it necessary to write
 you and express my gratitude for your cour-
 ageous stand on the VIET NAM war issue.
 One often reads of a Senator's mail running
 in a certain ratio on an issue.  So I felt I
 should add this letter to those approving
 your stand.
 The Viet Namese war is indeed a tragedy,
 not only because it involves great suffering
 for the Viet Namese people, but because the
 United State is disgracing its proud tradi-
 tion of the defender of' freedom around the
 world.  What freedom are we defending in
 Viet Nam?  The National Liberation Front
 does not represent freedom, but neither does
 the cruel Ky dictatorship that our dollars
 and men are defending.  It comes down to
 a question of a right wing or a left wing dic-
 tatorship, and I don't think any kind of
 dictatorship  is  worth one  American  life.
 The- question of aggression is also absurd.
 North and South Viet Nam have almost equal
 pdpulations, so if South Viet Nam had her
 people behind her, she could easily defend
 against aggression.  The truth is we have be-
 come involved in a three sided civil war.
 The Buddhists who are truly the freedom
 fighters are opposed by the Saigon dictator-
 ship.  The NLF who helped rid the country
 of the French is also opposed by the Saigon
 government and the U.S. The ones who back
 the Saigon government are the rich land

 military who threaten devastation with every
 penetration.
 The function of our military is to defend
 our shores.  We are wasting our purpose, our
 goals, and our power in this insane war some
 10,000 miles from our shores.
 (We must continue to believe in freedom,
 in enlightenment, in peaceful methods and
 we must then allow other peoples of this
 World to proceed with their own freedom and
 beliefs.)
 There are many methods by which we can
 share our beliefs, our hopes, and our help ex-
 tended to the people of the earth without
 Imposing our force and arrogance.  Our mili-
 tary power and strength must be conserved
 and used wisely whenever anyone threatens
 us at our shores or in the air above.
 The world is not ours to rule, it is ours to
 live in with others.
 Our present course will continue towards a
 complete dissipation of military strength and
 spiritual and moral power.
 It's time to turn away.  It's time to back
 out.  It's no time to force ourselves blindly
 forward in order to save face.  The price is
 too great.  (My children and my neighbor's
 children are very special to me. Bring them
 home.)  Shorten our lines of communica-
 tion and turn the other cheek.
 Our final choice is to choose between con-
 quering the world or living in it freely and
 letting others live as they would choose to
 live.  We can never five freely as conquerors.
 It's never been done.  It's never to be done.
 Only the third alternative will lead us to
 peace. Let us rapidly de-escalate our war
 effort, negotiate at every opportunity, and
 pursue every avenue of peace even at the ex-
 pense of our world image, at the expense of
 our world status and with a willingness to
 lose face, all the time remaining strong and
 ready to defend our own shores.

 smart conductor of these programs refrains
 from comment and lets the public phone

 vilification.

 A GI Wmow's QUESTION: WHY VIET NAM?
 (By Barry Cunningham)
 The young widow's eyes were reddened from
 anger as well as tears.  Under her glasses, the
 skin puffed out in raw circles.  Her eyelids
 Were damp and sore.
 "I've been crying since last Saturday," she
 said, stamping out a cigaret, "What good does
 it do?"
 She buried the butt in a taper napkin.
 And rolled the napkin into a tight wad to
 dry her eyes.
 "This war is useless," she snapped.  "My
 husband said so in his letters.before he died.
 He hated the whole slimy war."
 Juanita Butcher's marriage to a Viet Nam
 combat hero ended in tragedy last weekend
 when Sgt. Reubin Butcher, of 146-12 115th
 Ave., Jamaica, Queens, strayed Into a barrage
 of his own unit's artillery fire.
 June 2, 1966
 BODY  COMING HOME
 Sometime  today,                                                   the  23-year-old  1st
 Cavalry Division soldier's body will be flown
 to New York in a metal casket.
 Meanwhile, his 22-year-old widow struggles
 within herself to find some word that will
 help to explain the bewilderment and an-
 guish.                     -
 Her father, Robert L. James, a Transit Au-
 thority employe, cries-crossed the living room
 of the family home yesterday, banging his
 fists against the walls.
 "Gangsters," he growled, jabbing his finger
 at the Defense Department telegram.  The
 words, "died of wounds from friendly artil-
 lery fire" were underlined in pencil.
 "To me, that sounds like a bunch of gang-
 sters shooting at one another in the same
 room," he said.  "We don't know who we're
 fighting over there, do we? We're just shoot-
 ing and killing every which way."
 The husky subway worker said his son-in-
 law was first wounded during a Viet Cong
 sneak attack last February.
 Grenade shrapnel ripped into the soldier's
 right arm and leg, taking him out of combat,
 the father-in-law said, making his death on
 Saturday even more bewildering.
 James said Sgt. Butcher "worried about
 not being able to write to Juanita" because
 of his wounds.
 Three unopened letters postmarked "Viet
 Nam" were spread out on the dining room
 table as James spoke.  All were addressed to
 Juanita from her husband..  James said he
 wouldn't show them to 'his daughter until
 sedatives given by their family doctor had
 worn off.
 SHE'S UNABLE TO EAT
 He went back to the living room.
 "You ought to eat something," he urged
 Juanita,  who  had  refused  food  since
 Saturday.
 She had heard him mention the letters.
 Instantly, she went into hysterics.  The
 sedatives started to take effect and a few
 moments later she  quieted.  She fidgeted
 with the straps on a pair of white fur slip-
 pers and talked of her job as a Wall Street
 secretary.
 Then her eyes shifted to the mantel.  She
 gazed at a glossy photograph of her husband
 in uniform, remembering how he had written
 "everything is so desolate in Korea" during
 his 13-month tour of duty there in 1963.
 EVEN WORSE IN VIETNAM
 "It's twice as bad in Vietnam," he wrote
 to her last December.  A graduate of Eli
 Whitney HS in Queens, Sgt. Butcher married
 Juanita-his high school sweetheart while
 on leave in the winter of 1963.         -
 "He had big plans to come home and start
 raising a family," his widow recalled in a
 halting voice choked with grief.  "We had
 only nine more weeks to wait for each
 other."
 Then the expression on her face went dead.
 "He wrote to me that he had killed a man.
 He saw some of his friends killed.  I couldn't
 take it any more.
 "I told him to keep writing me, but please
 don't say anything about the blood."
 As she spoke, her father continued to pace
 back and forth across the carpet.
 OPPOSES THE WAR
 "I've been listening to this man from
 Arkansas-Mr. [Sen.]  FULBRIGHT."  he said,
 "and [Sen.] MORSE, too.
 "They say we're getting nowhere In Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                                     I agree with them.
 "These pickets and the boys who burn
 their draft cards aren't crazy."
 He said his son-in-law had written home
 that "most of us  don't know who we're
 fighting or why we're here."
 James tugged at his moustache.
 "You don't have freedom of speech when
 you're in uniform," he said.  "You are afraid
 to say anything.

 PACK IT IN
 (By Pete Hamill)
 The guy was wearing the green beret of
 the Special Forces, and he was standing in a
 bar on Tu Do St. In Saigon, drinking in a
 kind of desperate silence.
 He would not talk, even to the slim young
 bar hostess opposite him, who was happily
 taking his money.  After three whiskeys, he
 stood up, cursed Saigon, and lurched out the
 door. The girls all giggled.
 I saw him again a few days later, being
 helped by an MP into a jeep.  His face was
 mashed and bloody, and some of his teeth
 were gone.  I guess he had been mugged.
 Three young Vietnamese in white shirts stood
 on the corner, laughing.
 So when I think about Saigon now, or
 look at the photographs coming in on the
 photo printers, Ialways remember the way
 the girls laughed at that man, and the in-
 credibly cruel faces of those boys, standing in
 safety, enjoying his torment.  I am sure
 that when the moral giants of the United
 Buddhist Church call out the civilian troops,
 they are with them.
 Those young men are free in Saigon, while
 the sons of Americans are being killed in the
 countryside.  For the third time in recent
 weeks, more American soldiers were killed
 in that war than Vietnamese, which means
 that the Vietnamese have simply stopped
 fighting.  They are more interested in killing
 each other in places like Da Nang or Hue
 than they are in fighting the Viet Cong, and
 that means we will do the fighting for them.
 That means that all this year, the Ameri-
 can dead will be piling up while the sweet
 propaganda comes smoothly out of Washing-
 ton telling us that they will not be dying in
 vain.  It says here that Washington is lying.
 Those men are now dying in vain.         for
 There is a case to be made, I suppose,

 U.N. HAS VITAL ROLE rN VIET NAM
 (By David Lawrence)
 The United States has only one way out
 of the Viet Nam dilemma--only one way that
 is honorable and consistent with the un-
 selfish effort to save a small nation from the
 loss  of  its  independence.  That  way is
 through   the  United  Nations.  The  same
 principles which prompted the U.N. to send
 under its own auspices an allied army to
 repel aggression in Korea can be reaffirmed
 now.
 What is      blocking such a  course?  The
 answer is: A confident belief by the Com-

 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-

 House of Representatives to the bill (S.

 Interior to construct, operate, and main-

 which was, to strike out all after the
 enacting clause and insert:
 That (a) the Secretary of the Interior is
 hereby authorized to construct, operate, and
 maintain a third powerplant with a rated
 capacity of approximately three million six

 appurtenant works, including a visitor cen-

 and an integral part of the Columbia Basin
 Federal reclamation project.  The construc-

 to power and associated with each stage of

 AMERICANS
 Mr. TOWER. Mr. President, within
 the last few weeks, Secretary McNamara
 proposed that all young Americans give
 2 years of their life to the Federal Gov-
 ernment.  Two Texas radio stations,
 KHOU of Houston, and KMHT of Mar-
 shall, have responded with editorials
 most quickly and most perceptively to
 this unfeasible proposal.  These two edi-
 torials point out with awareness the con-
 sequences and the dissatisfaction that
 this unwise program would incur.
 I ask unanimous consent that these
 two radio editorials be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [An editorial from Houston, Tex., KHOU,
 May 23, 1966]
 THIS IS A SOLUTION?
 The latest brainstorm from Washington is
 simply unbelievable.
 It's the proposal by the Secretary of De-
 fense for all young Americans to give two
 years of their time to the federal government.
 Proposed to answer complaints that col-
 lege draft exemptions are unfair, it is a
 strange solution of surrender.
 A military draft we can understand, even
 though we all regret the necessity of calling
 young men to military service, but to force
 our youngsters to give up two years of their
 lives to work in some federal program that
 probably shouldn't exist in the first place
 does not make sense.
 in time of war it is necessary to build up
 our armed forces quickly, and the draft is
 the only immediately apparent way to ac-
 complish this end, but if there are not enough
 volunteers to staff the pet programs of our
 politicians, the programs should be curtailed
 or abolished.
 The draft of youngsters into civilian gov-
 ernmental service will only be another step
 toward  the  regimentation  of  our young

 BONANZA FOR VIET CONG
 The subcommittee-Convinced that "hun-
 dreds of millions of dollars' worth" of sup-
 plies financed by the U.S. Agency for Inter-
 national Development have been diverted to
 the Viet Cong-went to South Vietnam dur-
 ing May for an on-the-spot investigation.
 On their return to Washington, some mem-
 bers of the subcommittee were outspoken in
 charging laxity of controls over the AID's
 commodity-import program.  That program
 accounts for 370 million dollars of the 641
 million in U.S. economic aid going to Viet-
 nam in the year to end June 30, 1966.  Cost
 of the commodity-import program for the
 year beginning July 1 is estimated at 420
 million.   Combined military and economic
 assistance will be running at a billion dollars
 or more.
 WHAT'S BEING STOLEN
 In Vietnam such examples of costly "leak-
 age" as these are cited:
 Cement, steel, drainage tiles and alumi-
 num roofing paid for by the U.S. are diverted
 to the Viet Cong and wind up in communist
 fortifications, field hospitals and camps.
 Steel pipe, shipped from the U.S., is ac-
 quired by the Communists who use it for
 mortar barrels or for the outer shells of ter-
 rorist bombs.
 U.S.-made radios, parts and tubes assist
 Red communications networks.  American-
 financed medicines or drugs save the lives of
 wounded Viet Cong.
 How do the Communists get these and
 other items?
 The answer Is: In a variety of ways. Mate-
 rial is stolen from docks by Viet Cong agents
 or by thieves who sell it to Viet Cong repre-
 sentatives  operating  under  cover.                                                                                                                                            Goods
 going into regular channels of trade are sold
 to the Viet Cong-knowingly or unknowingly.
 Vietnamese guards at docks or warehouses
 often can be bribed.
 Viet Cong agents in Saigon mastermind
 smuggling operations in which materials are
 transported to the Reds via the river and
 canal system that radiates from the capital
 into the delta.
 IF VILLAGE CHIEF SAYS "NO"
 Diversion of construction materials, such
 as cement, generally takes place on the dis-
 trict level.  An example of one way it is
 done: A project to build a school, market-
 place or village well is approved.  When con-
 struction supplies arrive, the Viet Cong un-
 derground demands that 5 per cent or 10
 per cent of them be diverted to the Commu-
 nist guerrillas.  If the district of village chief
 ECOfq6MIC AID TO VIETNAM
 Mr. BAYH.  Mr. President, during re-
 cent months I have brought to the at-
 tention of the Senate what appears to
 be an unwise use of U.S. AID funds for
 economic assistance to Vietnam.  As I
 have indicated previously, we have been
 purchasing Japanese made, Korean gal-
 vanized steel sheeting for Vietnam which
 has been of inferior quality at an inflated
 price.
 If an article which appeared in the
 June 6, 1966, edition of U. S. News &
 World Report is correct, this is only one
 example of the misuse of economic aid
 which may have occurred.  It is ex-
 tremely difficult, Mr. President, to assist
 in developing the resources of a nation
 while its soil Is being ravaged by war.
 It is even more difficult to do so when
 black marketeering, theft and corruption
 apparently take place an the scale which
 has been reported.
 I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that this article from the U.S. News
 & World Report, together with an edito-
 rial commenting on the purchase of gal-
 vanized sheet steel for Vietnam, which
 appeared in the Richmond, Va., Palla-
 dium-Item on May 23, be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 and editorial were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:

 June 2, 1966             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 For the first time, there is evidence of co-
 operation and hard work by the U.S. and
 South Vietnamese Governments in efforts
 that cut across the entire spectrum of cor-
 ruption  that  has  grown  to  enormous
 proportions since the massive build-up of
 U.S. power began more than a year ago.
 An economic-warfare committee, set up by
 the U.S. to advise the Vietnamese Govern-
 ment, became operational in March. When
 all authorized posts are filled, more than 200
 American experts will be working exclusively
 on the economic war.  Serving in this force
 are former FBI agents, U.S. customs officers
 on loan, Treasury Department men, Govern.
 ment auditors and controllers.
 So far, the committee has had two major
 successes.   It  started investigations  that
 halted shipments of Unicel-100 and silver
 nitrate that could have aided the Viet Cong.
 Unicel-100, a chemical compound devel-
 oped by an American firm, is mixed with
 rubber to make a pliable substance used in
 manufacturing sandals.  Ten tons had been
 imported-enough to make 500,000 slippers,
 the maximum capacity of Vietnamese plants
 working full time for 18 months.  Several
 times as much tonnage was aboard ships
 bound for Saigon when an AID official, sus-
 picious of the large quantities ordered, de-
 manded a check on the chemical qualities of
 the material.
 The check disclosed that Unicel-100 in its
 pure state had an explosive power equal to
 that of TNT,
 The economic-warfare committee became
 suspicious of the large quantities of silver
 nitrate being imported for "film processing."
 Committee officials who speak Chinese visited'
 Chinese firms in Saigon that had bought the
 compound. They discovered that the Chinese
 were "cooking" the silver nitrate and extract-
 ing 5.8 pounds of pure silver from 10 pounds
 of the compound.
 This  was  extremely  profitable for the
 Chinese-but there was another, and grim-
 mer, disclosure.  The nitrate left over from
 the cooking could easily be converted to ex-
 plosives for making bombs and the Claymore
 mines used by Viet Cong terrorists in Saigon.
 As a result of the investigation, shipments
 of silver nitrate valued at more than a mil-
 lion dollars were halted.
 Now, the economic-warfare group is com-
 bing the entire list of commodity imports,
 searching for items that might help the
 Communists.
 PROFITEERING ON U.S. FUNDS
 The committee's primary function is to de-
 prive the Viet Cong of things they need to
 keep going.  But it also is involved in actions
 to prevent misuse of All) funds, waste of
 American aid goods, black-market profiteer-
 ing and illegal currency transactions.
 Stealing from U.S. stockpiles has been cut
 down by more extensive use of armed guards.
 American military officials say that the black
 market in goods stolen or  otherwise  im-
 properly obtained from post exchanges is
 dwindling as a result of a sharp crackdown.
 The crackdown on the black market in
 U.S.  dollars  is  more  difficult. Although
 American servicemen now are paid in scrip,
 not cash, soldiers who go to Hong Kong,
 Bangkok or Singapore on leave can get dollars
 there.  In the Saigon black market run by
 Chinese and Indian currency dealers, service-
 men can get 160 to 170 Vietnamese piastres
 for a dollar bill, but only 118 for scrip ex-
 changed for piastres on their bases.
 Just recently, a U.S. soldier was caught
 smuggling in $7,000 in greenbacks.  Since
 November, 1964, a total of 148 Americans-
 military men and civilians-faced investiga-
 tion in connection with illegal currency
 manipulations. -The US. Internal Revenue
 Service has dispatched agents to Saigon to
 look into tax aspects of black-market deal-
 ings.
 Defense Department files show that a num-
 ber of American civilians, including some
 employes of 'defense contractors, have left
 Vietnam with unexplained sums ranging
 from $11,000 to $42,000.  The IRS is investi-
 gating tax returns of these people.
 It's admitted in Saigon that profiteering
 and  black-marketing  by  the  Vietnamese
 themselves and by importers of various other
 nationalities are almost impossible to control.
 Importers make tremendous profits, be-
 cause goods are imported at rates varying
 from 40 to 118 piastres to the dollar and sold
 at fantastically inflated prices.  Imported
 goods are supposed to be price-controlled, but
 machinery for effective control is lacking.
 The economic-warfare committee says that
 it is curbing another aspect of corruption-
 misuse of AID funds in payment of exorbit-
 ant prices for items purchased in Taiwan,
 Korea and' Hong Kong.  Those governments
 are prosecuting sellers of lathes, bulldozers
 and other equipment that did not pass qual-
 ity and price checks in Saigon.  Importers in
 Saigon are being questioned about "kick-
 backs."
 On a related matter, Senator BIRCH BAYH,
 Democrat, of Indiana, declared in Washing-
 ton:
 "The prices paid by Vietnam with AID fin-
 ancing for inferior products were outrage-
 ously exorbitant. * * *
 "While Korea was selling a galvanized ton
 of 32-gauge sheet steel to Vietnam for $260
 plus shipping and handling, it was buying
 black plate from Japan for $140 a ton.
 "Thus, Korea was adding about $120 a ton
 for galvanizing and handling.  Now most
 American   companies-using   twice   the
 amount of zinc per square foot and paying
 their labor many times what Korean laborers
 are apid-charge approximately $60 to $70
 a ton for galvanizing sheet steel.
 "The reason for this odd circumstance is
 ensconced in documents currently classified
 as secret.  Suffice it to say, however, that a
 system of kickbacks, collusion and corrup-
 tion is at the root of the problem."
 American officials concede that, at best,
 profiteering by Vietnamese Government per-
 sonnel, even some Army officers, can only be
 curtailed, not ended.
 For one thing, in Vietnam as in the rest
 of Asia, the "squeeze" is a way of life, more
 so than ever when men on relatively low pay
 are trapped in a highly inflationary economy.
 It's easy to bribe a policeman to overlook
 possession of black-market items.  It's easy
 to bribe an official to issue an import license.
 Big, French-owned import firms and Viet-
 namese-Chinese companies know how much
 "squeeze" to pay for high priority in getting
 ships unloaded and getting goods through
 customs.
 GRAFT  IN THE  PROVINCES
 Corruption is traditional in district gov-
 ernments.                                                                               A Vietnamese district chief can
 pad payrolls and pocket the pay of phantom
 workers.                   Province chiefs can do the same on
 a bigger scale-and also extract kickbacks
 from district bosses.
 Charges are made that Vietnamese Army
 officers use their troops and AID materials to
 build houses which they then rent at high
 rates to Americans.
 In Vietnam, family relationships are so in-
 tricate and loyalties so interwoven that few
 Vietnamese Government officials or military
 officers will move to expose corrupt associates.
 There is no tradition that the law trans-
 cends personal relationships.
 It is inflation that is largely blamed for
 the breakdown of morality and the rapid in-
 crease in corruption that is proving to be a
 valuable ally of the Communists in Vietnam.
 In the years since 1960 the South Viet-
 namese Government's expenditures on the
 civilian side have doubled, while In the same
 period military expenditures have increased
 11495
 sixfold.  The Government's deficit, 16.4 bil-
 lion piastres in 1964, jumped to 26.7 billion
 piastres last year.  The deficit was covered
 by printing-press money.
 This year, Government income from the
 U.S. AID program will exceed the total of
 other national revenues.  Pressure is added
 by the U.S. military-construction program
 which this year, in cumulative total, will
 pass the billion-dollar mark.  The average GI
 in Vietnam spends about $40 on goods and
 services each month.  That adds to the in-
 flationary pressure.
 U.S. HOPE:  CUT IN CORRUPTION
 As U.S. officials see it, as long as a program
 of such size continues, not much can be done
 about small-scale corruption.
 What the U. S. hopes is that efforts now
 being pressed in a big way can halt the
 major corruption that plays into the hands
 of the enemy-and slow down appreciably
 dispersal of U. S. AID material to the Viet
 Cong.
 [From  the  Richmond,  (Ind.)  Palladium-
 Item, May 23, 19661
 BAYH'S  CHARGES UPHELD
 After two and a half months the Agency
 for International Development  (AID)  has
 finally admitted that Senator BIRCH BATH
 was correct in his charge that it was buying
 interior                            Japanese-made  and Korean-gal-
 vanized steel sheeting.
 The sheeting was purchased for use in
 Viet Nam and BATH had charged in late
 February that it "has been rotting out in
 less than a year" whereas American steel
 "lasts about 12 years."
 AID  Deputy  Administrator  William  S.
 Guad admitted also that "with respect to
 prices, we found indications of possible col-
 lusion and kickbacks by suppliers to Viet-
 namese buyers."
 A release from the office of Indiana's junior
 Democratic senator said, "This was AID's
 first public acknowledgement of the accuracy
 of BAYH'S charges."  It earlier denied any
 collusion.
 Gaud said future purchases of steel sheet-
 ing will have to meet U.S. commercial stand-
 ards and that half of it must be purchased
 in the United States. "We also will set rea-
 sonable price ceilings above which awards
 will not be made," Gaud promised.
 Formerly 90 per cent of American foreign
 aid funds for such products as galvanized
 steel had to be spent in the U.S. but on Jan.
 31, AID waived this rule for galvanized steel.
 BATH wants all pregalvanized steel to be
 purchased in this country.  He plans to push
 an amendment to the 1967 foreign aid bill
 for that purpose.
 He is willing as a reward for Seoul's active
 support in the war in Viet Nam to let Korean
 firms continue to galvanize the sheeting if
 they upgrade to American standards.
 BATH was alert in being concerned when
 AID-financed purchases of inferior steel were
 affecting the jobs of 80,000 Indian steel work-
 ers whose taxes help support AID.
 AID bungled when it agreed to buy foreign
 sheeting without first checking its quality.
 Even if the foreign sheeting were equal to
 American steel, Its purchase, as BAYH pointed
 out, aggravates the unfavorable U.S. balance
 of trade.
 The  profiteering  on  foreign  galvanized
 steel is another example of American tax
 money dispensed without adequate controls
 or supervision. AID is funneling $370 million
 into South Viet Nam this year but has only
 two persons checking to see how the money is
 spent.
 While AID officials are finally moving to
 prevent the waste now that Senator BAYH
 has made it hot for them, there- is no excuse
 for previous lack of concern.  American and
 South Vietnamese troops have been dying

 THE ROLE OF PACKAGING IN THE
 ECONOMY
 Mr. COTTON.  Mr. President, a most
 interesting, and timely, study of the role
 of packaging in the U.S. economy has
 recently been published. Undertaken by
 Arthur D. Little, Inc. for the American
 Foundation for Management Research,
 the study sheds new light on the value
 of packaging to the total economy and
 its place in our consumer-oriented mar-
 ket.
 The study shows that the value of
 packaging to consumers is increasing, de-
 spite the relative decline in industry
 spending for packaging.  It indicates
 that packaging has a long-term salutary
 effect on general economic health because
 it reduces production and marketing
 costs, increases consumer demand for
 products, and accelerates the rate of
 market penetration.
 These conclusions derived from the
 work of one of the Nation's most respect-
 ed research organizations, should be es-
 pecially Interesting to the Senate as it
 considers the so-called truth in pack-
 aging bill, some parts of which are based
 on the philosophy that packaging is a
 dark-hued villian intent on robbing the
 defenseless housewife. This survey may
 help to set the record straight.  Unfor-
 tunately it Is too lengthy, 113 pages, to
 include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, but
 the magazine Modem Packaging has
 published a useful summation of the
 report's major findings and conclusions,
 which I ask unanimous consent to have
 Inserted at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From Modern Packaging, May 1966]
 PACKAGING: A GIANT MATURES
 Impartial report gives statistical proof of
 packaging's contributions to the nation's eco-
 nomic growth and to corporate profits and
 shows how it Is Increasing value of the con-
 sumer's food dollar.
 A long-awaited "white paper" on pack-
 aging's contributions to the U.S. economy
 has just been released.  Some of its findings
 may surprise; others reinforce the validity of
 profit philosophies that have been translated
 into action by many of the nation's leading
 packagers and suppliers. Among the report's
 major conclusions:
 The value of packaging to consumers. is in-
 creasing-despite claims to the contrary by
 proponents of tighter Federal controls over
 packaging and labeling.  Packaging is, In
 fact, reducing consumer purchase and con-
 sumption risk to "an historic low."
 Packaging Is not growing quite as fast as
 the U.S. economy as a whole, indicating that
 it has become a mature service vital to gen-
 eral economic health.
 The over-all value of packaging, currently
 pegged at $22 billion, should grow to $29 bil-
 lion by 1975.
 The level of packaging prices corresponds
 closely with the general wholesale-price in-
 dex.
 So vital an Influence is packaging on corpo-
 rate profits that the packaging function must
 be considered as a centralized management-
 level responsibility.
 Despite the onrush of plastics, most tradi-
 tional materials are maintaining a 'steady
 share of market.
 These data are contained in an impartial
 statistical survey by Arthur D. Little, Inc.,
 titled "The Role of Packaging_ in the U.S.
 Economy," made by the research firm for the
 American Foundation for Management Re-
 search, a non-profit affiliate of the American
 Management  Assn.  Covering  the  decade
 from 1954 to 1963, it Is the end product of
 broad-scope  interviews  among suppliers,
 package users, industry associations and Gov-
 ernment agencies.  Detailed analyses of eco-
 nomic aspects of the report will appear in
 forthcoming Issues Of MODERN PACKAGING.
 It remains to be seen what effect this eco-
 nomic report will have on such pending legis-
 lation as the Hart Bill, which is predicated
 on the assumption that much of packaging
 does  a disservice to American consumers.
 Little's study makes a contrary case.  It re-
 veals that consumers spent an average of
 $5.01 for packaging-materials per $100 of
 food-product purchases in 1963, compared
 with $5.14 per $100 in 1954.  During the same
 decade, consumer earning power rose sharply.
 . The report concludes, therefore, that "the
 combined effect of this rise  in consumer
 earnings and a continued stability in pack-
 aging-material prices has meant that the
 consumer received nearly 25%  more value
 for his packaging dollar in 1963 than he did
 in 1954, and nearly 30% more in 1963 than in
 1958."
 A further caution against applying check-
 reins to packaging is implied in the survey
 finding  that packaging has a long-term
 salutary effect on general economic health
 because it reduces production and marketing
 costs, increases consumer demand for prod-
 ucts and accelerates the rate of market pene-
 tration.
 The fact that packaging is not growing
 quite  as  fast  as  Gross  National Product
 (4.2% annually for the former, 5.6% for the
 latter during the period 1958-83) is proof
 that packaging has matured as a service In
 the U.S. economy, according to the- report.
 The reasons given for the slower growth rate
 of packaging are (1)  distribution of pack-
 aging material: over major market segments
 has remained relatively constant over the
 past decade; (2) unexplolted opportunities
 for packaging are fewer today, and (3) as
 the economy becomes more geared to mass
 consumption, spending for services increases
 and the portion of total spending for pack-
 aged products declines.
 An interesting note on the distribution of
 packaging materials is that such old stand-
 bys as metal, glass, paper and paperboard did
 not lose ground in the decade between 1954
 and  1963-even though plastic materials
 doubled in volume, from 2.7% to 5.8% of
 the total packaging market.
 Packaging's role in fostering  corporate
 success gets a big boost from the survey. It
 urges that management recognize the need
 to  centralize  the  packaging  function  in
 corporate  strategy  and decision-making,
 rather than delegate responsibility to one
 sector or another of the corporation-each
 with it own biases.  Only by broad-spectrum
 management control, the report concludes,
 can the potential of packaging be realized
 fully.

 a new design concept.  With an output
 of 10 megawatts-thermal, it is more
 powerful than several industrial testing
 reactors, and more powerful than sev-
 eral of the Atomic Energy Commission's
 own research reactors.
 The Policy of the University concern-
 ing use of the reactor Is that:
 The research reactor facility shall be avail-
 able for research utilization by any member
 of the faculty of the University of Missouri
 and of the Universities comprising the Mid-
 America Association of State Universities.
 Priorities for the use by faculty members
 of any specialized facilities shall be estab-
 lished by the simple technique of "who asked
 first."  In the event that questions arise as
 to the advisability of such a priority assign-
 ment,                                                                                                       these  questions  will  be negotiated
 with the Reactor Advisory Committee and
 their findings shall be final."
 With respect to faculty, graduate stu-
 dents, other educational institutions and
 industry, the priority of use shall be as
 follows:
 First. Faculty and graduate students
 of the University of Missouri and other
 universities in the Mid-American Asso-
 ciation of State Universities.
 Second. Faculty and graduate students
 of other educational institutions.
 Third. Faculty and graduate students
 from out-of-State educational institu-
 tions.
 Fourth. Industrial contract research.
 I would like to point out that the
 university policy also says that wherever
 possible the research reactor and its
 facilities will be available to industrial
 users, where the industrial research will

 grams. I find it an interesting and pro-
 gressive step that the University is
 ready to consider participation by in-
 dustry to the extent it is compatible with
 educational  research  activities.   The
 blending of industrial and academic re-

 to fruitful new combinations of ideas,

 The university is fortunate to have as
 Director of the Research Reactor Facil-
 ity, Dr. Ardath H. Emmons, who is also
 a professor of nuclear engineering and
 a professor of radiology.  He was born
 in Albert Lea, Minn., on March 12, 1924.
 He took his bachelors of Science in chem-
 istry at Dubuque in 1948, his master's
 in chemistry at the University of Mich-
 igan in 1954 and his Ph.D. there in 1960.
 On February 1, 1960, he was appointed
 to the faculty of the university.  Since
 then he has been a pivotal figure in
 bringing this reactor project into reality.
 Many companies from Missouri have
 had an important part in bringing the
 reactor into being. The Internuclear Co.
 of St. Louis did the prelimiary design

 Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out that it
 is not so much where we stand that is im-
 portant.  It is where we are going.
 I am confident that our nation's natural re-
 sources are in safe hands.  We are going to
 meet the challenges of the 1960's in the use
 and development of our basin resources with
 intelligence and confidence.
 There will come a day when we will be able
 to look down from the air upon any water-
 shed, no matter where we may be, and see a
 coutryside secure and beautiful.  Trees will
 be where they should be, and grass will be
 where it should be.  Cropland will be pro-
 tected by all the needed conservation meas-
 ures.  Streams will be clean and clear, their
 flow steady and abundant.  Recreation areas
 will be where our people can enjoy them.
 And, most Important, the people who dwell
 in these -places will be healthy, strong, keen
 of mind and happy-because man and nature
 will be in harmony.
 This organization, and the organizations
 you represent here in this Congress, have
 made vast contributions to our progress in
 dealing with the problems of our basin re-

 March 10, the distinguished Senator from
 Indiana  [Mr.  BAYHI  submitted  an
 amendment to H.R. 12169, the supple-
 mental appropriation act for Vietnam,
 which was adopted by the Senate, but
 eliminated in conference.
 The amendment proposed to correct
 existing AID practices which resulted in
 the purchase of Japanese steel, galva-
 nized in Korea, at a cost considerably
 higher, but with lower quality than com-
 parable steel could be purchased in the
 United States.
 At that time, I stated my support of
 the position of the Senator from Indiana
 and urged the unanimous approval of
 that amendment.
 It has come to my attention that the
 Iron Age magazine has printed an arti-
 cle in the April 28, 1966, issue which
 describes the continuing efforts of the
 Senator from Indiana to assure an ap-
 propriate change in AID policy.

 INPT.AT'ED PRICIES
 BAYH has rejeased tile results of two In-
 dependent studies supporting his charges
 that steel purchased by Vietnam with Amer-
 ican aid is of inferior quality and overpriced.
 He claim that Vietnam, using American
 aid, paid inflated prices for inferior steel
 manufactured in Japan and galvanized with
 insufficient zinc in Korea.
 A study conducted by the General Account-
 ing Office,  at  BAYH'S  request shows that
 prices for steel purchased by Vietnam "in-
 cluded     certain  improper costs  ultimately
 paid for by the Agency of International De-
 velopment." BATH says the "improper costs"
 amounted to $90 a ton.
 The second study, conducted by the So-
 ciete De Surveillance, a Geneva-based orga-
 nization, shows  that Korean  galvanizing
 mills use Japanese steel which "is processed
 chiefly from salvaged scrap." The study says
 the Koreans added to the steel sheets a "de-
 fectuous coating which Is quickly weather-
 worn."
 As a result of these findings, BAYH reports,
 AID has taken steps to assure quality con-
 trol and deal with the problem of inflated
 prices.  But BAYH is not satisfied.
 BUT AMERICAN
 He    thinks           steel  purchased by  Vietnam
 with foreign aid dollars should be manufac-
 tured by American companies. Good quality
 products would be assured without incur-
 ring the expense of imposing and policing
 quality  control  standards.   American         aid
 dollars would flow directly back to the U.S.
 in the form of taxes, wages and additional
 man-hours of work.  No improper costs
 would creep into the prices paid for these
 products.
 BAYH says AID is now considering a policy
 change.  However, if the change does not
 incorporate his 90% American-made com-
 ponent plan, BAYH Intends to seek "appro-
 priate legislation."
 The Senate earlier adopted BAYH'S proposal
 as an amendment to a supplemental foreign
 aid bill.  But House-Senate conferees re-
 moved the amendment.
 Mr. SYMING'''ON.  Putting it mildly,
 Mr. President, this article points out how
 right was the position taken by the able
 Senator from Indiana.
 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of
 a quorum.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  The clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  Without  objection,  it  is  so
 ordered.  .
 UNTRUTHFUL ATTACKS ON
 THE CIA
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, ear-
 lier today, the Senator from Missouri
 [Mr.  SYMINGTON] made a statement
 dealing with attacks that are now cur-
 rently being made upon the Central In-
 telligence Agency.
 He stated:
 A favorite "sport" now current among
 various groups which appears to be growing
 in volume is to attack the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency.
 He further stated:
 These charges are made by many people,
 including enemy aliens in defense of their
 activities, and those who have been charged
 with illegal activities.  From the standpoint
 of sport, at times it would appear comparable
 to shooting fish in a barrel, because the
 nature of the work of the CIA means it
 cannot defend itself.
 Mr. President, I want to use this state-
 ment of the Senator from Missouri as a
 premise for what I shall now have to say.
 I concur with him completely that be-
 cause the CIA cannot defend itself and of
 necessity, by reason of its work, must
 remain silent, inducement has been pro-
 vided by those who bear ill will toward
 certain individuals in the Agency to make
 attacks upon it.
 The most recent attacks have dealt
 with the cases of James R. Christensen,
 with a Cuban exile, who was captured in
 Cuba and charged by Castro with having
 been hired by the Central Intelligence
 Agency to assassinate Castro, and in the
 third case, in relation to John R. Hawke.
 These attacks have been made with great
 bitterness.   The  Central  Intelligence
 Agency. has not been able to answer.
 The claims that have been made
 against the agency are false.
 I take the floor today to emphasize the
 fact that the interests of the United
 States are not being served by the attacks
 which are being made upon this Agency.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. The time of the Senator from Ohio
 has expired.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the able
 Senator from Ohio be allowed to pro-
 ceed for 5 additional minutes.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. Without objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. The office of the Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency is headed by
 Adm. W. F. Raborn.  His assistant Is
 Richard Helms.  He has a legislative
 counsel and the staff of the Central In-
 telligence Agency.
 The important aspect of the services
 rendered by this Agency, which are not
 being considered by'\those within our
 own ranks who are attacking the Agency,
 is the fact that the Agency works directly
 under the President. The Agency is sub-
 ject to the supervision and direction of'
 the National Security Council.
 Who are the members of the National
 Security Council?
 Lyndon B. Johnson, the President of
 the United States.  HUBERT  H. HuM-
 PHREY, the Vice President.                                                      Dean Rusk,
 the Secretary of State.  Robert S. Mc-
 Namara, the Secretary of Defense.  Bu-
 ford Ellington, the Director of the Office
 of Emergency Planning.   Then there is
 the Special Assistant to the President for
 National  Security  Affairs, McGeorge
 Bundy, and Executive Secretary Brom-
 ley Smith.
 Mr. President, I submit to all Senators
 that whatever attacks are being made
 upon that Agency are an implied attack
 upon the President, the Vice President,
 the Secretary of State, the Secretary of
 Defense, and the Chief of Emergency
 Planning.
 For the past 20 years especially, it has
 been the objective of the Communists in
 the cold war to blacken the character of
 the Intelligence Agency of the United
 States. One of their principal tech-
 niques has been to lay at the doorstep of
 the Intelligence Agency the charges that
 11489
 it is indulging in practices common and
 inherent to the Communists of the world..
 With the Communists making the at-
 tacks, when support Is given to those at-
 tacks by men on the Senate floor and by
 persons in our own Nation, it provides a
 great instrumentality for the Commu-
 nists to publicize throughout the world
 that, within the Chambers of the U.S.
 Senate,  these  remarks  have  been
 made by officials of the U.S. Government,
 condemning the activity of this Agency.
 It is with great hesitancy that I enter
 upon the discussion of the subject that I
 shall now undertake.  One statement
 was made several months ago that the
 Central Intelligence Agency dressed its
 agents in the garb of Vietcong Commu-
 nists and sent them among the innocent
 South Vietnamese to rape women and
 kill old men and children, and then to
 place the blame on the Vietcong.
 That charge was denied most emphat-
 ically.
 I want to repeat that charge-that the
 Agency, operating under the President,
 Vice President, Secretary of State, and
 Secretary of Defense, dressed its agents
 in the uniform of the Vietcong Commu-
 nists and that they raped women and
 killed old men and children, solely to
 place the blame on the Vietcong.
 When that statement was made, nat-
 urally Peking and Moscow picked it up
 and publicized it throughout all the
 world.  Peking and Moscow quoted what
 was said, and stated:
 United States official confirms the charges
 we have been making about the activities of
 the  agents of  the  Central  Intelligence
 Agency.
 Mr. President, I think the time has
 come to quit blackening the character of
 the United States and whitening that of
 the Communists, unless it can be estab-
 lished and proved that the charges we
 are'making are true.  Tragically, that is
 not the situation now.
 The attacks are frequent.  The at-
 tacks have been in some instances denied
 and labeled as false. But they still go
 on.
 I cannot bring myself to believe for one
 moment that the members of the Na-
 tional Security Council would tolerate
 for one second the retention of Admiral
 Raborn and his assistants if there were
 one semblance of truth to the indictment
 that has been heaped upon them.
 I have remained silent on this issue.  I
 have said nothing about it. But I have
 seethed with agony and indignation in
 the knowledge of what has been going on.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tern-
 Pore.  The time of the Senator from
 Ohio has expired.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Senator
 from Ohio may proceed for 3 additional
 minutes.

 Mr. LAUSCHE. I join fully and whole-
 heartedly in the statement made by the
 senior  Senator  from  Missouri  [Mr.
 SYMINGTON] this morning.
 My hopes are that the people of the
 United States will understand what a
 well-organized  technique  has   been
 adopted by the Communists to discredit
