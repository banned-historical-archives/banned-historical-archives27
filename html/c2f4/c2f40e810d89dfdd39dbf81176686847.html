 FPC Disavows Intention To Regulate
 Retail Electric Rates
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. JOHN E. MOSS
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, September 29,1965
 Mr, MOSS. Mr. Speaker, there re-
 cently                appeared In Drew  Pearson's
 column a report that the FPC is plan-
 ning to regulate retail rates of electric
 power companies, which are, of course,
 now within the sphere of state regulatory
 agencies. When I saw that report, I
 promptly contacted the FPC to ascertain
 whether the report was true.
 The Commission disavows any such
 intention. It appears that the mis-
 understanding as to the Commission's
 position resulted from a request by the
 Office of Emergency Planning that FPC
 assist OEP in developing a rate stabiliza-
 tion program in the event Of a serious
 national defense emergency-such as
 nuclear war. The Corflmission, however,
 told OEP that any plan for regulating re-
 tail electric rates during such an emer-
 gency should be coordinated with the
 various state regulatory agencies, and,
 that the FPC's role would be limited to
 the wholesale rate sphere in which the
 FPC has, of course, considerable ex-
 perience.
 The draft in question was prepared by the
 OEP staff as a suggested contribution by
 the FPC to the stabilization program in
 the event of a serious national defense
 emergency (such as a nuclear war sit-
 uation). After submission of the OEP draft,
 the Commission staff met with OEP repre-
 sentatives on June 18, 1085, and explained
 to them the myriad of retail rates in effect
 throughout the country and the need for
 planning any stabilization  program for
 retail electric rates in conjunction with local
 regulatory bodies. While FTC is ready to
 contribute our experience in the wholesale
 rate sphere to the national emergency ef-
 fort, as I have stated, we made clear that
 any plan for regulating retail rates In an
 emergency should be coordinated with the
 State commissions.
 The Federal Power Commission has at
 no time sought to extend Its peacetime re-
 sponsibilities to the regulation of electric
 retail rates. We have of course Indicated
 our readiness to contribute our experience
 to emergency planning and we assume that
 when State and local bodies are asked to
 do the same they will respond in a similarly
 affirmative manner.
 Sincerely,
 JosErx C. SWIDLER,
 Chairman.
 FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION,
 Washington, D.C., October 14, 19G5.
 Hon. JAMES A. LUNDY,
 President, National Association of Railroad
 and Utilities Commissioners, Washing-
 ton, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We write to correct
 recent suggestions that the Federal Power
 Commission seeks to supplant the retail rate
 responsibilities of the State commissions.
 We have no such intention.  The misun-
 derstanding grows out of requests by the
 Office of Emergency Planning for FPC as-
 sistance In developing a rate stabilization
 program in the event of a national holocaust.
 The circumstances of our discussions
 with the Office of Emergency Planning were
 set forth in the Commission's letter of
 August 5. 1945, to Senator WARREN G. MAG-
 NUSON, the chairman of the Senate Com-
 merce Committee.  A copy of that letter
 Is enclosed for your Information.
 As the letter makes clear, the Commis-
 sion suggested to OEF that any plan for
 regulating retail rates in a wartime emer-
 gency should be coordinated with the State
 the proposed consular convention with
 the Soviet Union should be brought to
 the attention of the Members.  Mr.
 Dembkowski has written another article
 on this subject, and I insert it in the
 RECORD as well:
 DANGERS Or THE CONSULAR TREATY
 (By Harry E. Dembkowski)
 In keeping with its prrctice of steam-
 rolling legislation through Congress, it would
 not be surprising, come next year, to witness
 an attempt by the Johnson Administration
 to force the Senate's ratification of the con-
 sular treaty without adequ ite discussion or
 debate--or without adequ2.te national dis-
 cussi)n and debate. Before that time, there-
 fore, it is important that the treaty's pro-
 visions-and dangers-be made known to all
 concerned.
 Last week we explored the background of
 the consular treaty. Today we will discuss
 some of the many reasons why the treaty,
 although proposed In the name of "peaceful
 coexistence," is undesirable and, in fact,
 pose:. a threat to the Nation.
 The most serious flaw in the treaty-and
 the major source of controversy-is that It
 goes far beyond established precedence and
 makes an unjustifiable concession to the
 Soviet Union. It grants diplomatic immu-
 nity to the Soviet consulate employees that
 would be stationed in this country (and to
 the Americans stationed it Russia) thereby
 exempting them from arrest and prosecution
 of whatever crimes-including espionage-
 they might commit. This is a right which
 no other nation, not ever our allies-has
 been granted. (Heretofore )nly embassy and
 United Nations' employees have enjoyed dip-
 lomatic Immunity).
 The danger Involved is obvious when one
 remembers that the Soviet Union employs
 even Its diplomats for purposes of subversion
 and espionage. For example: 21 Soviet citi-
 zens have been discovered using their posi-
 tions at the U.N. for espionage purposes, and
 12 Soviet citizens employed in the Soviet
 Embassy in Washington have been exposed
 as intelligence agents and expelled from the
 country.
 It Is argued that this unusual concession
 is being offered to the Soviets because
 Moscow has conceded heavily on the ques-
 tion of American citizens who are detained
 in Russia.  According to Russia's criminal
 code a person can be hell Incommunicado
 dur ng an Investigation for as long as 9
 months. Now, according to the treaty, U.S.
 aut:Iorities are to be notified of the arrest
 of Americans within 3 days and be given ac-
 cess to them within 4.
 But this Soviet "concession" should have
 beea demanded long ago on a reciprocal
 bass since the United States has always
 aecorded visiting Soviet nationals the ben-
 efit to our democratic criminal code (the
 right to consult an attorney when arrested,

 This treaty is like Pandora's box. Once
 opened, it may prove impossible to close.
 Aside from the question of diplomatic im-
 munity the treaty contains other pitfalls.
 If the United States opens a consulate in
 any of the Soviet "Union Republics" of Esto-
 nia, Latvia, or Lithuania, this would amount
 as Congressman DERWINSKr has pointed out,
 to a de facto recognition of Russia's incor-
 poration of those Baltic countries, thus
 violating our long-standing refusal to grant
 recognition to that blatant act of imperial-
 ism.
 And If the United States opens any con-
 isulates in the Ukraine or Byelorussia-both
 of these. states have voting rights in the
 United. Nations-we will be serving the ends
 of the Kremlin by recognizing its suprem.
 acy over the Soviet Union's non-Russian
 nationalities.
 A further threat is that Soviet consulates
 in this country could-and would-be used
 for purposes of blackmail, intimidation and
 extortion of Americans who have relatives
 living in the Soviet bloc.  The consulates
 could also be used as staging grounds for the
 disruption of anti-Soviet and anti-Commu-
 nist organizations..
 It should be obvious by now that the con-
 sular treaty is undesirable and dangerous.
 Come next year, we should carefully observe
 which Senators vote for it. And come next
 fall when election time approaches, it might
 be wise to retire a goodly number of them.
 Great Strides in Education Expansion
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN V. TUNNEY
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, October 18,1965
 Mr. TUNNEY. Mr. Speaker, I place
 in the RECORD a statement by President
 Nyerere of the Republic of Tanzania.
 Education is extremely important to the
 future of the newly developing nations of
 Africa and this statement shows that the
 African leaders are very much aware of
 the need' of improving the educational
 system of their land.
 The statement follows:
 GREAT STRIDES IN EDUCATION EXPANSION
 We have made very great strides in educa-
 tion expansion in recent years. The number
 of children in primary schools has increased
 considerably and is continuing to increase.
 Yet the greatest emphasis since self-govern-
 ment has been on the expansion of secondary
 school facilities and on the provisions of
 places at universities and technical colleges.
 The results have been very good; since 1960
 the number of pupils entering secondary
 schools has more than doubled and the
 number entering higher school certificate
 courses has been increased four times. This
 year we shall have more science graduates
 for the higher school certificate from a
 single school, Mkwawa High School, than we
 had from the whole of Tanzania in 1963,
 WORTH REPEATING
 These, and other figures illustrating our
 progress, have been. quoted before but I
 think they are worth repeating. They rep-
 resent a great effort by the whole nation,
 and, of course, particularly by those who
 work in the education field.
 The people of this country have encour-
 aged the Government to devote a very large
 part of their resources to education, and
 they have demonstrated again and again
 their willingness to make the financial sac-
 rifices necessary. But development of this
 magnitude does not only call for money.
 it calls for devoted and skilled men and
 women, both as organizers, administrators,
 and particularly as teachers.
 The Whole of TANU and the Government
 is responsible for the decision to devote such
 a large proportion of our resources to the
 secondary school sector, but I want to use
 this occasion to pay a special tribute to the
 Minister for Education, Mr. Solomon Eliufco,
 for the way he has taken charge of this re-
 sponsibility and implemented the broad
 policy decisions. Together with his staff at
 the Ministry of Education he has done a
 magnificent job in completely reorganizing
 our educational system since independence,
 integrating it, creating a unified teaching
 service, devising a syllabus more in tune
 with the conditions in an independent re-
 public and, at the same time, bringing into
 being this great expansion of facilities.
 NATIONAL ABILITY
 In order to achieve all this, however, we
 have had to outrun our national ability to
 provide teachers. The small number of
 Tanzanians who have stayed manfully at
 their teaching posts despite other attractions
 have been carrying a very heavy load for the
 future of our country. I hope that all of us
 are conscious of our debt to them.
 At the same time it has been necessary for
 us to use large numbers of teachers from
 other countries, Without this help none of
 the expansion we are so proud of would have
 been possible. At the university college,. at
 the technical college, at all our secondary
 schools and even primary schools, our prog-
 ress has been made possible because of
 teachers from countries abroad-particu-
 larly, in point of numbers, from Britain and
 America. We are grateful to these teachers
 for their help, and we hope that many of
 them will stay with us for a long time to
 come.
 But it would be absurd for us to continue
 to rely on expatriate teachers to man our
 educational system. It is one thing to re-
 ceive help in overcoming the inheritance of
 educational neglect; It would be another
 thing to imagine that this help excuses us
 from taking steps to fulfill our own teaching
 needs in the future. We must educate and
 train our own teachers at all levels as rapidly
 as possible.  The teachers college we are
 opening today is one of the steps which are
 being taken to achieve that aim. It is not
 the . only one.  As you know, major new
 building works are in preparation at Moro-
 goro, Marangu, Mpwapwa, and Butimba, as
 well as smaller expansion schemes at other
 more junior teachers colleges.  All these
 developments are urgently needed and we are
 especially appreciative of the help which
 countries abroad are giving us in this field.
 By helping to make it possible for us to train
 our own teachers, donor countries are helping
 us to achieve our major aim of eventually
 standing on our own feet.
 In the case of this college here at Dar es
 Salaam it is America to whom we are in-
 debted, and I welcome this opportunity. to
 express our appreciation. It is because of an
 AID loan of ?338,000 that I am able to open
 this building today, and this. Is a loan which
 carries only nominal interest rates and has a
 long repayment period. Because of this loan
 we now have 142 students at the college here,
 and next year we expect to be able to accom-
 modate 280 students, 'The buildings are very
 attractive and also well designed for the work
 which will be done in them. The architects,
 Messrs. French and Hastings, and the build-
 ers, Messrs. V. M. Chavada, Ltd., are to be con-
 gratulated on their work, as are all the other
 people in the Ministry and among the staff of
 this college who have contributed ideas and
 supervision.
 Finally on this subject, I would like to pay
 tribute to Mr. Organ and his colleagues whose
 work on the landscaping and gardens has in-
 sured that even at this early stage the college
 campus is attractive. I hope that everyone
 will cooperate to maintain and improve still
 further this high standard.
 Buildings by themselves, however, are not
 very much use. This college is already able
 to make a contribution to our teaching re-
 quirements because since September 1962 we
 have had the services of specialists from Kent
 State University, U.S.A., in the planning and
 teaching at the college. It is this help which
 has made it possible for the college to expand
 from 25 students in 1959 to the present num-
 ber. In addition these expert visitors have
 contributed very much to improving the
 quality of the training given to teachers both
 here and elsewhere in Tanzania.
 REPLACEMENTS
 I am told that the Kent State University
 team is now gradually returning home.
 They are doing so because at the same time
 as they were working here their colleagues
 in their home college were training Tan-
 zanians in the skills necessary-and these
 Tanzanians are now beginning to return
 home. By this time next year, therefore the
 Tanzanian counterparts of the experts we
 have been using will have entirely replaced
 the Kent State University personnel. Let
 me use this opportunity to say how much we
 appreciate  this  planned  and  organized
 scheme of training, and also that we hope
 the individuals who have been staying with
 us will not completely sever their connec-
 tions with Tanzania. I would add that, on
 their return to America, we also hope they
 will be able to spread understanding of what
 we are trying to do in Tanzania.
 The facilities in both staff and equipment
 which have been available at this college
 have made it natural that this should be the
 center for advanced teacher training work,
 and for the introduction of new courses.
 Not only do we have a large number of peo-
 ple here being trained as grade A teachers-
 that is those who have obtained school cer-
 tificates-but we have also introduced here
 the first course for education officers grade
 III. Only 17 students instead of the 40 we
 were hoping for have come forward to take
 this first course for ex higher school certifi-
 cate teacher training; but I am sure this
 number will increase rapidly as secondary
 school students realize that after the higher
 school certificate they can enter a course for
 training in secondary school teaching up to
 form IV without obtaining a degree.
 I certainly hope this is the case. In my
 experience few things are more personally
 rewarding than opening the minds of future
 citizens of our country so that they may
 learn to appreciate and develop their own
 potentialities for service. Good teaching is
 hard work. Let those who doubt this try
 to become an effective teacher. But it is
 also a very honorable profession and its
 members richly deserve their high status in
 our society. I hope that Tanzania will con-
 tinue to accord to its teachers the very high-
 est respect. A,nation which fails to do this
 is like a family in which no respect is shown
 to the parents, an attitude which is clearly
 incompatible with our traditional society,
 and with the socialist society we are now
 building.
 In return for this respect, and indeed to
 earn it, What is it that the teachers of Tan-
 zania have to do? They have to transfer to
 the children of this country certain skills
 and certain basic facts about our country
 and the world. Equally important, they
 have to encourage their pupils to develop a
 pride in themselves and their nation on the
 basis of those ethical principles which un-
 derlie all religions and upon. which our
 state is based. But, in addition to all these
 things, they teachers of Tanzania have to
 prepare their pupils to live in a rapidly
 changing world where Tanzania will take its
 place as part of a developing continent. It
 is no use the teachers giving to their pupils

 the answers to the existing problems of our
 nation. By the time the pupils are adults
 the problems will have changed. Instead
 they have t3 develop among their pupils a
 "problem-solving capacity"-an ability to
 taink, to reason, and to analyze the skills
 anti the information they have acquired, and
 thus create new Ideas and new solutions to
 new problems.
 Work of this nature requires from the
 students of this college a high degree of ap-
 plication In their work; a high degree of
 confidence In themselves, and also a desire
 for service. They are being asked to Incul-
 cate attitudes of service and attitudes of in-
 qu:ry Into the minds of the young. They
 will only be able to do this If they adopt
 such attitudes themselves and If their char-
 acter is above reproach.
 ACTIONS NEEDED
 While you students are here at this new
 college you will have to show by your ac-
 tions that you realize you are being given
 an opportunity to train In the most modern
 and the beet-equipped teachers' college in
 the country. You must look after the fa-
 c?_lities you have been given co that those
 who come after you will also be able to
 benefit from them. You must afro be ready
 when necessary to assist In the manual work
 of sweeping and cleaning, and in maintain-
 ing the grounds of the college. You must
 recognize that the highest st..ndards will be
 demanded from you In your work. Idleness
 or indifference would be Inappropriate at
 this place, and I am sure that none of you
 will make it necessary for the principal to
 carry out his duty of severe disciplinary ac-
 tion against anyone who Indulges in there
 two habits. In fact, we expect students at
 the Dar es Salaam Teachers' College to de-
 velop a sense of professional pride which
 influences your behavior and your whole at-
 titude to work, I consider it essential, for
 example, that some of your allowance should
 be spent on the purchase of those Items of
 equipment which a good teacher must al-
 ways have by him-such things as reference
 bo Iks, mathematical instruments, and the
 scissors, selotape, and other things needed
 for visual aids. You should not expect gov-
 ernment to provide such tools for you In
 addition to your allowances; and when you
 leave this college you should posse: s, as
 your own, the things which every teacher
 needs if his work Is to be done properly
 wherever he Is.
 PROBATION PERIOD
 When students from this and other col-
 leges have graduated they have a 2-year
 probationary period before being confirmed
 In the unified teaching service. This period
 will be a testing one during which young
 teachers may be challenged to the full. In
 particular they may be appointed to any
 school in the country, wherever the need
 is greatest.  I am sure that the graduates
 of Dar es Salaam Teachers' College will not
 flinch from this duty.
 Indeed I believe that some-and I hope
 meny-of the students here will go further
 and volunteer to serve their probation as
 members of the national service, If they do
 so, they will receive the normal 3-month
 national service training, and then, as serv-
 toe men and women, they will teach wher-
 ever they are required, under the normal
 inspection conditions, thus completing the
 practical aspects of their training as usual.
 Your Excellencies, I have spoken for
 longer than I intended and still not said all
 the things there are to say. I can only men-
 tion in passing the Swahili workshop, which
 will take place here shortly, de-Tito my very
 great personal Interest In Improving the
 teaching of our national language,  And I
 have not mentioned either our financial needs
 for phase II of the building program here,
 which will call for another ?127,000.  But
 perhaps it is better that we concentrate to-
 day on expressing our appreciation of the
 loan we already have and on rejoicing in the
 fine buildings before us.

 THE NATION'S TEACHERS
 In her fight against Ignorance the United
 Republic of Tanzania has made great strides,
 and the opening of the Teachers' College at
 Chang'ombe by President Nyerere last Satur-
 day underscores this achievement.
 Students who are, and will be, privileged to
 attend this college will receive training in
 the most modern methods of the science of
 education by a band of devoted tutors, indig-
 enous and expatriate.  The country has a
 wise foresight of their Government and the
 generosity of Americans to thank for this
 very modern college.
 The eradication of ignorance is only one
 front, and members of the teaching profes-
 sion the vanguard, In the war against back-
 wardness; for a nation of ignorant men and
 women cannot wage a successful war against
 dowse, nor that against poverty; teachers
 therefore play a very key role In the overall
 plans of our development, and they deserve
 the highest respect of the nation, as rightly
 pointed out by the President.  All our
 schemes to raise our people's standard of liv-
 ing will literally come to nought if we do
 not strengthen our teaching manpower. All
 manner of skilled personnel-planners, econ-
 omists, engineers, doctors, lawyers-must In
 the first instance depend, for preparat!on for
 their skills, on teachers.  It Is therefore
 fitting that expansion of training facilities
 is provided for In the 5-year development
 plan.
 The ordinary man or woman could be for-
 given for not knowing exactly what a teacher
 goes through, what responsibilities he carries
 a^d how public hla failure can be If he does
 not deliver the goods. But the Government
 does, and does so In no uncertain manner, for
 the cabinet Is graced by the presence of some
 ex-teachers.  That perhaps explains the
 emphasis correctly placed on the production
 of more and better teachers.
 At a time when we were fighting colonial-
 ism It was necessary that we mobilize all our
 forces Irrespective of our training; for some
 t me after we had won our Independence It
 was equally inevitable that In adjusting the
 administration some teachers should move
 Into more lucrative jobs In the higher eche-
 lons of the civil service; but this was no more
 than a necessary evil; It was a severe drain
 on the teaching profession. It Is therefore
 proper that the Government should now
 make good that loss.
 Government should at this stage try to
 attract none but the best brains Into the
 training colleges. Time there was when any-
 one was good enough to be a teacher, with
 the result that not only was the profession
 diluted, but a psychological situation was
 created whereby the teaching profession
 was a pis slier. This was most unfortunate
 because It meant that the best brains went
 elsewhere, and only when students failed
 to qualify for entry Into other professions did
 they go In for teaching.
 In the new and sovereign Tanzania this
 need not be so because our own people de-
 cide which are the priorities In our develop-
 ment plans.  It will be a long time before
 we can produce our economists and engineers
 by pressing a button, and until we reach
 that happy state we shall still need teachers.
 And whereas the respect accorded to teachers
 last Saturady is not grudged, we suggest
 respectfully that Government would do well
 to adjust the discrepancy In material reward
 between teachers and other professional per-
 sonnel of camparablestanding,

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. DANTE B. FASCELL
 OF FLORID:!
 W THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, October 18,1965
 Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, with the
 first concrete signs that adjournment is
 in sight, many of our number are casting
 abo.lt for a place to take a well-earned
 vacation. For those who have not yet
 decided where they would like to spend
 this time, I offer a suggestion: consider
 Key West, Fla.
 Ivey West, the southernmost point on
 the continental United States, offers a
 diversity of activities-there is something
 for everyone to do, see, and enjoy. For
 the fisherman there are abundant sup-
 plies of sailfish, marlin, dolphin, barra-
 cuda, bonito, and others in the immedi-
 ate vicinity. For the skindiver there are
 inn.imerable old shipwrecks to explore in
 waters that abound with living coral and
 over 600 species of tropical fish. For the
 nonsportsman or the individual just
 looking for a rest, there is the city of
 Key West with its Old World charm and
 exc: temen t.
 In the October issue of Skin Diver
 magazine, Mr. Don Groves has written
 a delightful article on the Florida Keys
 in general and Key Wcst in particular.
 In the article, entitled "The Key for
 Good Diving," Mr. Groves has fully cap-
 tured the activities available to all, For
 those who seek an adventure-filled ad-
 journment, I recommend this article and
 further recommend that they consider
 graving the fair city of Key West with
 their presence.
 The article follows:
