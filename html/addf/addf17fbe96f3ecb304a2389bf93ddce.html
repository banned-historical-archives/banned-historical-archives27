MAO 
A-Chineee Communist Partybroadoest from North Shensi on 19 -January, 
reveals an increasingly conscious aggressiveness in development of a Chinese 
Commaniet polloyfor Japan. Aimed at influencing the Japanese general 
eleotions of 23 January, the Chinese Communist radio emphasised that after 
8 years of combating Japanese inperialien, "New China," unwilling to deal 
with Japameee reactionary elements, finds 'Japanese Oomeaniste and other 
democrats" beet qualified to lead Japan 10 a "genuine close friendship" 
with China* Dangling the prospects of renewed China trade before market-
seeking Japan, the broadcast stated that while Japan needs to establish 
economic and political relations with "People's China," "Japanese reaption" 
possesses nothing on which China must rely, !he Chinese Communists further 
announced that "whether American impertaliits and their Japanese pawns are' 
willing or not," the "New China" will concern itself with control of Japano 
Probably the North Shensi broadcast contributed little to the surpris-
ing election summon of the japan Communist Party (JCP)* (The JCP increased 
its loser house Diet Beate from 4 to 38 out of 466 seats.) The "New China" 
pronounoemmat, however, played on the same note which JCP campaign psyoholegy 
has stressed, namely,that Japan has nuels to min by being trimmily with e 
Communist China* 
Chinese CWmmunist allurements to Japan for potential economic relations 
may be of considerable significance. Chineee Communist planners do not 
expectemloszelie economic support from the USSR amdmaydesire to resnme 
triode been these two economically complementary areas with the thought 
that, through gradual, judiciously applied pressure, they can assist the 
JCP* On SECTION III) 
The expressed desire to participate in the control of Japan may indicate 
a two.fold ambitions (a) to play upon Japanese fears of a Communist China 
'while putting pressure behind alump-on.the-bandwagon movement, and CO to 
help counter American influence in the Par East* Possibly anticipating' ? 
international recognition of a Communist.00ntrolled Government of China, 
the Chinese Communist Party undoubtedly aspires to China's present seat on 
the Far Eastern Commission, where China holds veto power, and on the 
purely advisory Allied Council for Japan, which anew China" could employ 
as a sounding board to mould Far Eastern opinion*

&Pen"Puna trade erranremsnt eonoluded  
Japan and Burma have aonoluded a trade arrangement oovering the period 
or 1 ismary to 31 Deeesther 1949. The arrangement oontemplates a trade 
balaneed at 13 million dollars and is similar in outline to the ever-all 
sterling area trade arrangimaent negotiated in the autumn of 1948. It 
provides for the purchase of raw cotton, rise, lead, antimony, tin *oases* 
tratese teak and rubber by Japan in exchange for cotton piece goods, silk 
and rayon goods, setts* prn, corrugated iron sheets, truck tires. tubes, 
pottery and petiolate. 
Before the war, Burma was not important in the foreign trade of Japan 
proper, aoerusting for only 0.6 percent of exports (mostly cotton goods) 
and 003 percent of imports (raw cotton and sine). Currently, however, 
trade with Burma is important to Japan because it affords a trade channel 
in Southeast Asia, an area which Japan is anxious to develop so as to 
lessen its 000110111.0 dependence on northeast Mien =Moats, now in large 
part Communist-dceinated. Trade vAth Japan is important to Burma beoause 
before the war Japan was a simificant market for one of Burnet:I major 
exports?raw Gotten. 
The trade arrangement* may encounter difficulties. It is problematical, 
for example, whether the Iszterzutttonal Imergenoy Food Committee (WC) will 
permit the allocation of rise to Japan. In addition, instability in Burma 
will maks both the produstion and export of the required ocamoditdes 
diffloult.

CHINA 
Nitionalist organised military resistance ends. The completely 
demoralised and defeated armies of CNIANG Kai-shek are reported to 
be retrofit:in south from the Nanking-Shanghai area and the Tants* 
defense line. The oncoming Chinese Communist armies are believed 
to have reached the Yangtze and currently to be amities orders 
to woes the river. Prior to this leteet Chinese 00,mun1st advance. 
CHIOS Kai.i.ehek, at long last, decided to *retire! and departed for 
Peughne to "sweep the tombs of his emulators." Mein CUM left* 
he turned over the confused remnants of his regime to Sating Presi-
dent LI Teung-jen, who is at Present frantically attempting to negotiate 
an "honorable peace" with the Chinese Communists. Nowever, with the 
disintegration at organised Nationalist military resistance, LI 'a 
bargaining power is nil and he can expect little better terns from 
the Chinese Communists than unconditional surrender. 
Neanebile with the calm capitulation of the ancient North China 
capital of Peiping on 22 January. the Ch:nese Communists added another 
victory to their list and deftly administered the 'coup-de-grace' to 
the Nationalist military position in North China. Nationalist Oen. 
ru Tsom.yi surrendered Peiping to the Communists, in exchange for a 
guarantee of his personal safety and the removal of his name from the 
Communist list of "war criminals." PO apparently made this deal with 
a view toward. getting out later and returning to his home territory 
in Suiyuan Province, The Communists, on the other hand, probably 
are aware or TO's intention to "go bank to the firm." and therefore 
will make every effort to keep bin under their thunb so as to forestall 
any possibility of his ever again becoming a formidable adversary. 
The.peaceful'oapitulation of Saigon. Tientsin. and Peiping has 
set a pattern which will probably be followel by the defenders of the 
remaining Government...held cities of Nanking, Shanghai, Nankai'', Teingtao, 
Sian and possibly Taiyuan. Consequently, the last major engagement 
of China's civil war appears to have been concluded. 
CHIANG Kai-shek "retires." CHIANG's decision to retire from the 
Presidency of the National Government, et a time when its collapse 
is imminent, ovidenoss his intention to demonstrate that Vice Pres-
ident LI faung-jen cannot make in "honorable" peace with the Communists 
and that continued resistance under CHIANG's leadership is the only 
alternative to unconditional surrender. CHIANG', action is also 
calculated to put on the Communists the onus for declining to halt their 
attacks 0=410 on terns contemplating early communisation of Nationalist 
China. 
Legally. CHIANG's "retirement! involves no more than his absence 
from the presidential office, to which he may return at will. Be

Government. Moreover, he has recently strengthened his authority 
in various provinces of South and Southwest China by the appointment 
of dependable subordinates to key positions. Mine plans have been 
partially carried out to uan Taiwan as an ultimate haven for Nationalist 
leaders despite the possibilities of a native uprising there, CHIANG 
bus lade additional preparations to employ South China as a base of 
resistant* and has mooed Government resources1 records, and personnel 
both to South China and Tawas. If LI's efforts to make peace are futile, 
MANG will be in a position to resume active direction of the National 
Government and may head a government-in-exile with the hope 
of recovering control of China as a consequence of World lir ///. 
? Acting President LI '5 newly appointed peace delegates, SHAO Li-
tee and CRAIG Chih-ohung, have little to offer the Communists and 
realisation of their difficulties probably will impel the majority 
of Nationalist leaders who still possess regional authority to attempt 
further resistance, probably in cooperation with CHIANG Kai-shek. 
Leftist leaders and lesser Nationalist figures may aoco.ziodate them-
selves to conditions of Communist rule, somewhat as those in the 
Peiping-Tientsin region have done. 
Joint CostumNatinnelist administration set up in Peiping. 
FU too- s agents accepted terms of surrender for Peiping which will 
facilitate a gradual and orderly assumption of power by the Conmunists 
and which involve the cooperation of Nationalist military and civilian 
officials during the transitional period. Another provision of this 
acceptance is the future inclusion into the Communist forces of all 
Nationalist troops in Peiping. Probably sone of the peace-makers will 
be given at least temporary roles in the Communist administration. 
Meanwhile, Marshal LI Chi-shen and other dissidents who reportedly 
have boon conferring with Communist representatives at Shihchiachuang, 
south of Peiping, issued a statement, broadcast over the Conmunist 
radio, which denounced Nationalist peace overtures and otherwise 
adhered closely to recent Communist propaganda lines. Marshal LI 'a 
Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee may serve as a vehicle for admitting 
a limited number of Nuomintang members acceptable to the Conmunists 
into the future Communist-doninated coalition government. 
Communists view CHIANG as _principal enemy Chinese Columnist 
broadcaata-have denounced CHIANG'S 4retirement" as a tactical maneuver 
inspired by the US and have accused the US and the Kuomintang of 
plotting to build up South China and Formosa as bases from which "to 
destroy the revolution." The Communists are genuinely concerned 
over CHIANG's prospects, with US assistance, for delaying total 
surrender in China. 
The Communists have made clear that realisation of MAO Tse-tung's 
eight-point program is their aims the presence of specific individuals

on their lilt of war oriminals" is the only point susceptible to 
modificatiou. As bargaining points in his favor, Acting President 
LI will claim both control over remaining Natimallat forces and 
international Status as thelegal National Government of China. It 
is doubtful that Ll's government really has suoh control or such status. 
MAO'. Insistence upon the "reorganisation* of all Nationalist Armies 
is likely to split Ll's government sharply into two groups, with only 
those who control no significant military forces favoring settlesent. 
The other group can hold out temporarily in South and west China, 
and me/ at any time Join forces with CHIANG Itai-shek upon his return 
from "retirement." 
The Commudsts are well aware that the Generalissimo is playing 
for UAL, Thus, while the Communists will accept with pleasure what-
ever concessions are offered them by the ineffectual government in 
Natddiig, their principal enemy is and will remain CHIANG Nai-sheks 
who will not compromise with the Communists and who will continue 
to be a serious obstacle to the realisation of the Communist eine 
as long as he retains any vestige of military or political authority. 
Recall of Soviet Ambassador iaplies _policy change. A change in 
Soviet policy in China may be indicated by the recall of Soviet 
Ambassador B. V. Roshohin. Gen. Rostzthia, former Military Attache, 
was appointed Ambassador in February 1948 after conferences in Mooccw. 
The USSR apparently concluded that the US program of aid to China, 
announced at that time, was certain to be a failure and t herefore 
that the Chinese Government night well accept a Soviet offer to mediate 
in the civil war which Roshchin had already advanced informally. 
Since Communist successes throughout 1948 made Soviet mediation either 
unnecessary from the Soviet viewpoint or undesirable from the Chinese 
Communist viewpoint, the USSR recently declined the National Govern-
merit?. invitation to nediate. Roshohin has again been fuelled to 
Moscow, and Soviet affairs in Nanking will again be entrusted to 
a Charge d*Affairs who presumably will be unable to ccamit the USSR 
to a course of action in the absence of an Ambassador. Roshchinis 
contacts and operations for the past several years have been with 
the t-hinese Nationalists rather than with the Communists. It is 
therefore quite possible that Roshohin will not return as Ambassador.

that Burmis 
diffloWitiiis are steadily undermining the countryte 
financial stability. Net only is the Government burdened with homy mili-
tary expenditures, but the various insarrections are seriously interfering 
eith excorts the operations of Government-owned utilities and the collection 
of taxes. In addition to Government efforts to deal with the critical fi-
mamba situation by cutting cost-of-thing allowances to Govenmeent workers 
and promulgeting an *austerity program*, foreign financial assistance is 
being sought. The Infermation Minister has requested Burmese newspaper 
editors to ton daan their attacks upon *Anee-American imperialists and 
bloodsucking capitalists* in order to avoid antagonising prospective leaders. 
India and the Mr are the most likely nurses of loans becauselbsunts rice 
is of peat importance to both. India needs all the rice it can get for 
its own use and the TIN needs rice for the food-deficit areas of the Par 
particularly in Malaya, which produces a large amount of dollar ex-
change. Then! is reported ready to loan Burma 200 million rupees (about 
$67 million.) It is expeeted that a request will be made of India. Such 
loans, however, mill*onlyimrre a temporary effect until law and order are 
restored, and offer little Freepost at fundamentally improviswBurmals

enforcing copprehenstve austerity, or checking inflationary conditions. 
The reduction of governmental allowances ney lead to strikes by Government

Govervnieni amuses no definite -antl-aommadat I:regress Premier Phibel 
indleated at a press eanferenee last leek that the government is examin-
ing measares to combat Coniennism. The Phibul government is aware that 
Commies is eonfined chiefly to Sients large Chinese minority which 
dominates the labor fore* and the mercantile class. The government is, 
therefore primarily concerned with the nrdblen of limiting Chinese con-
trol of labor unions and the reservation of certain occupations to 
Siamese nationals. Furthermore, in an effort to remove possible causes 
for the erread of Commnnism among Siam's overwhelmingly agrarian papilla-
Lion, the government is studyihg the advisability of reducing foreign 
land ownership and the possibility of Increasing cooperative land-holdings. 
At nresent, Siam has a promise of limited military aid from the UK 
and, in addition, is making strong overtures to the US for military and 
ergonomic assistance as a means of withstanding Communism. Desnite the 
awns:vat anti-Communism of the present regime, however, the Siamese are 
capable of making the adjustments necessary for dealing with a Chinese 
Common/et government recognised by world powers. This would be entirely 
consistent with Siam's past history of opnortunistio adaptation to po-
litical developments elsewhere in Asia.
