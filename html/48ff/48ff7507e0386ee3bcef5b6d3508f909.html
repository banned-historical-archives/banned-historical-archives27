 The Subcommittee on National Security Staffing and Operations
 was established in May 1962 to review the administration of national
 security, and to make findings and recommendations for improvement
 where appropriate.
 Early in its work the subcommittee concluded that it would be
 useful to examine how certain nations of the Communist bloc recruit
 and manage personnel in the making of national policy.  The sub-
 committee staff, in cooperation with the executive branch, was re-
 quested to arrange for the preparation of the present study on staffing
 procedures and problems in Communist China.
 This study is a sequel and companion to the one entitled National
 Policy Machinery in Communist China, published by the Subcommittee
 on National Policy Machinery in January 1960.
 We believe this present study will prove of special interest to
 Government officials and to academic centers.  It should contribute
 to a deeper knowledge of the challenge confronting free societies and
 free men.

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS
 IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 1. INTRODUCTION
 This is a study of the theory and practice of personnel management
 in Communist China.  It endeavors to draw together information on
 how Chinese skilled manpower and talent are selected, motivated,
 advanced and organized in the pursuit of national goals.  It begins
 with a consideration of personnel requirements at the senior levels
 of the party, surveying the broad functions performed and sketching
 out the background and character of the incumbents.  It then takes
 a look at the mechanics for staffing various echelons of the party.
 This is followed by an examination of how the party actually handles
 its personnel.
 These chapters are followed by a discussion, arranged along similar
 lines, of the requirements for top government executives, the system
 of government personnel administration and how it operates in prac-
 tice.                 A special chapter is devoted to the armed forces.
 Later chapters take up in turn the educational system and the
 means used by the leaders to communicate with lower levels of the
 administrative apparatus and the Chinese people.  The concluding
 section is a general assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the
 whole system.
 Several characteristics of the Chinese Communists' approach to
 this problem are deserving of special mention.
 1. A striking feature of the Chinese system, even in comparison
 with its Soviet counterpart, is the pervasiveness of party control and
 manipulation.  Positions of real authority anywhere in China are
 without exception held by party members.  In fact, no level of gov-
 ernment, no military, scientific, economic or educational organization,
 no activity of any moment is without its party group, the members
 of which effectively run the unit.  Advancement is unlikely if the
 party does not approve.
 2. Stability in the highest reaches of the party has been unusual for
 a system which in other places has bred frequent change.  Mao
 Tse-tung has been the dominant figure for nearly three decades. He
 has kept around him a group of associates he trusts.  Today, these
 men are old and overworked.  They present an all but immovable
 roadblock against aspirants to high office.  And it has also proven
 a difficult matter to insinuate new concepts, especially in technical
 fields, into the policymaking process.  The leaders tend to turn for
 advice to party figures who share the experiences and prejudices of
 the leaders.
 3. Personnel management is highly centralized.  The system allows
 the men who determine national security programs to commit avail-
 able talent to these programs in complete freedom.  There is no
 outside competition for talent.

 4. China is, however, very short of topflight talent-administrators,
 managers, scientific researchers tutors for gri,duate students, tech-
 nicians, etc,  Still the Chinese leaders misuse what they do have by
 a dogmatic refusal to trust fully those educated abroad, whether in
 tlieU.S.S.R. or the West, and by forcing everyone to spend much time
 in political indoctrination.
 5. These political indoctrination programs aid the absolute control
 of all media of communication permit the leaders to disseminate only
 such information as they think fitting.  This has contributed to a
 unity of purpose throughout the system and a willingness to work
 hard at tasks set by theTenders, though the degree of dedication today
 is not what it was several years ago.
 II. STAFFING THE PARTY
 National political policy in Communist China is directed to building
 China over the shortest historical span possibl.; into a strong, modern
 leader of nations with till the paraphernalia of power that implies.
 The goal is a China respected for its militaiy and political power,
 honored for its culture, turned to for its principled interpretation of
 Communist doctrine; in short, it China restored to its rightful leading
 role in the world.  The present leaders are dedicated to the proposi-
 tion that this can only be done through the development of an authori-
 tarian, Communist system of government in China.
 The Chinese Communist Party, in power throughout mainland
 China since 1949, is still in the early phases of a big construction effort.
 The attempts of the leaders in 195S-1960 to accelerate the process
 through. "leap forward" practices were a dismr,l failure.  The country
 is groping its way out of the rubble of tha disaster.      It did not,
 however, shako the leadership out of the conviction that its cause and
 course are correct.  Nor has it shaken the present leaders from their
 dominant positions,
 STAFFING REQUIREMENTS AT SENIOR LEVELS
 Ultimate power, in the Chinese Communist system, rests in one
 man, whose qualities determine in great measure how the whole will
 operate,  That man now is Mao Tse-tung, father figure of the Chinese
 Communist movement.  The guiding principles and the programs
 by which the nation operates are in the final analysis his responsibility.
 Many issues can, of course, be settled short of Mao, but he is the final
 arbiter.
 During the nearly three decades of Mao's stewardship, the Chinese
 party has been transformed from a small, hunted band of revolu-
 tionaries fleeing to the barren hills of northwestern China into the
 ruling element of the largest single group of l:eople on the face of the
 globe.  This record of success has made, and continues to make.,
 effective challenge of Mao a very difficult prtoposition.
 To the Chinese party, Mao is the "gret.test revolutionary and
 statesman in Chinese history", and the most prominent Communist
 "among all living contemporaries."

 Public Speeches by Mao's foremost associates bristle with fulsome
 tributes to Mao's insights, wisdom and knowledge.  Practicing
 experts in virtually any field-ideological, economic, military, lit-
 erary, scientific-are advised to improve themselves by studying
 Mao's works.  Chinese policies in all these fields are presented as
 owing much to the master.
 Mao Tse-tung, born the son of a rich peasant, has been a member of
 the Chinese Communist Party since it was formed in 1921; and has
 been its leader since 1935.  He is a man of supreme self-confidence.
 For years he has shown an ability to adapt Marxist-Leninist formulas

 to suit his own purposes as well as a certain talent for making the
 right decision at the right time.
 This talent may ~icrimps be diminishing, at least, his more recent
 initiatives have not been notably successful.  The great leap forward,
 the commune movement and the challenge to the Soviets have all
 proved singularly inappropriate to China's needs at this stage of its
 development.
 Mao is widely read in the literature of Marxism-Leninism.  Ile
 writes well, frequently in a breezy style full of pithy language which
 appeals to Chinese.  He has been able to attract and hold competent
 subordinates, and has shown an ability to balance them off, one
 against the other.
 He has been outside China only twice, in 1950 and 1957, both times
 to the Soviet Union. His knowledge and understanding of the outside
 world are limited.   His grasp of internal Chinese conditions may
 be slipping.  Rumors have been trickling out of China for the past
 several years that Mao's health has been declining.  Whatever the
 state of his powers, Mao's speeches and writings have diminished
 quite remarkably since about 1957.  In recent years, he has spent a
 good deal of time in various vacation spots ]away from the levers of
 power in Peiping.
 Standing just behind Mao in the power structure are his six col-
 leagues on the Standing Committee of the Pol_tburo.  This inner
 circle of advisors joins Mao in developing, forr;iulating, and coor-
 dinating China's domestic, foreign and defense policies.
 Considerable figures in their own right, they arc: widely experienced
 in party, state and military affairs.  They are expected to look at
 issues which come before them in a comprehensive, overall way.
 They must watch the whole chessboard, not just one of the pieces.
 Each of them, however, does appear to have a broad area of special-
 ization.  Liu Shao-chi and Tong IIsiao-ping seen. to give the greater
 measure of their attention to the theoretical and practical concerns
 of the party.  Chou En-lei's chief concern is the government and its
 foreign relations,  Lin Piao concentrates on military affairs.  Chu
 Teh, generally inactive, sometimes serves as a. spokesman for Mao.
 Chen Yun spends most of his time on economic matters, though he
 has been out of the public eye for some time nom.
 These are men with a long history of devotion to the hierarch, men
 who have thrived on decades of the vicious in-fighting winch cbarac-
 terize-s the system, men who are tough and ruthless, men who speak
 a common language and hold common views.  They are men who
 have been conditioned by many years of party work to understand
 the time for debate and the limits placed thereon.  The effective
 operation of the entire structure requires that the men at this level be
 tightly knit.  They must know how and when to submerge differences
 and show a common purpose to the other layers of the party and to the
 people at large.
 Tholcontinuity of this group is remarkable for a system which in
 other countries and parties has bred frequent bloody change.  Turn-
 over has been limited.  The five men who were on the party Secre-
 tariat in 1945 are still formally in the inner circle today.
 Ranking next to Mao is Liu Shao-cbi.  To some, t he appears a
 classic example of the faithful servant.   They point
 with their many sychophantic passages, and speculate that he will not

 long outlast Mao. However, Liu does wield great power in the party
 organization.  Mao has complete confidence in Liu's abilities and has
 made Liu his heir apparent.  The party presents him as its leading
 theoretician, next to Mao.  His 1939 work, How to be a Good Com-
 munist, was recently re-issued and made the subject of a special party
 study campaign.
 Liu is a somber and a somewhat colorless individual.  After he was
 selected to succeed Mao as head of government in 1959, an attempt
 was made by the party's propaganda organs to paint a more engaging
 public picture of him.  The campaign seems to have died away with
 doubtful results.
 Liu's closest collaborator in party matters is Teng Hsiao-ping, one
 of the youngest members of the inner circle.  Teng has risen rapidly in
 favor and prestige since the mid-fifties.  In recent years he has been
 the party's chosen spokesman on a number of key issues, and in 1960
 played a large part in the Moscow conference of Communist parties.
 A short, bullet-headed man, Teng is said to be hard-driving and
 aggressive.  The party obviously regards him as a good organizer and
 sound administrator.  His several strategic positions in the central
 apparatus give him powerful levers over party matters.
 Chou En-lai, the only premier the Chinese Communist government
 has ever had, is perhaps the best known of the Chinese Communists
 in the West. Handsome and urbane, Chou for years was the principal
 face which the Chinese Communists turned to the world.  He has
 traveled more than his colleagues in the inner circle and he may, as a
 result, have a more sophisticated view of the outer world. He is by
 all accounts a skilled and resourceful negotiator.  He showed at the
 Bandung Conference in 1955 and in an early visit to India that he is
 quite expert at building up an aura of Chinese goodwill.
 What should not be lost sight of is that Chou is also a veteran
 Communist, a high-ranking member of the party for at least four
 decades.  He was once ranked ahead of Mao and has shown a remark-
 able agility in getting along with whoever happens to be in power.
 Chou's wife is the number two woman in the party.
 The other active member of the inner circle is Lin Piao.  He is the
 youngest. A military man for his entire career, Lin had apparently
 been ailing for a number of years.  He leapt back into prominence
 following the disgrace of Peng Teh-huai in 1959.  Lin was one of the
 most successful generals produced by the Chinese Communists in their
 fight against the Chinese Nationalists.  His return coincided with a
 renewed emphasis on the supremacy of the party over the military.
 The politburo and secretariat
 Standing just outside this inner circle are the remaining full (voting)
 members of the Politburo.  This body has considerable importance as
 an advisory board, a discussion group and sometimes, as a voting
 body.  Decisions taken by the Standing committee have the full
 force of a Politburo decision, but Politburo sanction may well be
 sought for major policy shifts.  Meaningful voting in the Politburo
 is probably restricted to issues on which Mao and his inner circle
 have not staked out a definite position.
 The advice of Politburo members is likely to be sought prior to
 decision on a matter in which the individual member is expert.  All
 nineteen of the voting members are men with a record of thirty to

 forty years of faithful service to the party.  They represent a variety
 of backgrounds and are capable of providing advice in many fields.
 Here appear the top specialists in various aspects of party work:
 Peng Chen has long been in party organizational work and has repre-
 sented the party at important Communist meetings abroad.                    Tung
 Pi-wu is engaged in supervisory work, Tan Chen-tin is concentrating
 on agricultural matters, Lo Jung-huan is a senior figure in party con-
 trol work in the armed forces.  Chen Yi, Li Fu-chun and Li Ilsien-
 nien are the party's top specialists, respectively, in the government's
 foreign, economic planning and financial affairs.  Ko Ching-Shih and
 Li Ching-chain are the top leaders in East and Southwest China and
 may bring regional points of view into the Politburo.
 No additions to the Politburo have been ann unccd since 1958.
 Good bets for election to the next Politburo are Tao Chu and Sung
 Jen-chiung, heads of the Central: South and Northeast party bureaus,
 respectively.
 Since, Mao took over in 1935, only three men of Politburo rank can
 confidently be said to have been purged : Chang Kuo-tao shortly after-
 wards, Kao Fang in 1954 and Peng Teh-huai in :959. Several have
 been demoted, others have died, but seven members of the present
 Politburo were on the 11-man body elected in 1945.
 The presence of a number of party elders in these key groups should
 not be misconstrued.  Though they are relatively inactive, they do
 serve a definite purpose by providing automatic frupport for Mao on
 any matters put before them.
 Another key top level body is the Secretaariat, the executive office
 of the party for day-to-day operations. It is under the direction of
 the Standing Committee and the Politburo, anc'_ differs from these
 bodies largely in that it is, formally, a full-time body. Although the
 counsel of its members is probably sought before new policy is finalized,
 the Secretariat's main task is to monitor the execution of decisions
 taken by its parent bodies. The Secretariat may well be the party's
 instrumentality for directing and coordinating the party's central
 do artinents.
 The ranking official on the Secretariat is Terg Usiao-ping. His
 four leading associates are all Politburo figures--'cng Chen, Li Fu-
 shun, Li   ien-nien and Tan Chen-lin.  Also included are Lo Jui-
 ching, who is Chief of Staff of the armed forces and a long-time
 security expert; King Sheng, an intelligence main; Lu Ning-yi and
 Hu Chiao-mu, propaganda experts; Li Ilsuch-feng, industrial matters;
 Liu Lan-tao, organizational and control matters within the party;
 Wang Chia lisiang, who was once involved in liaison with other parties
 but has not been active lately; and, Yang Shang-kun, who holds several
 top administrative positions.  Lo Jui-citing, Fang Sheng and Lu
 Ning-yi were added to the Secretariat by the tenth plenum of the
 Central Committee in September 1962.
 The second level
 The Central Committee itself, nom na11 r 97 full and 95 alternate
 members, has functioned under Mao as a rubber stamp body, convened
 to be instructed concerning decisions taken by the dominant leaders.
 By the time it meets the needs of the top command for expert advice
 have been met and the line in all essentials has been set. It could, as
 has happened in the Soviet arty, emerge as an important deliberative
 body if an issue arose on which the leaders were critically divided.

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA  7
 An individual's rank within the Central Committee is important as
 his mark of preferment.
 The party's central departments provide the staff to prepare posi-
 tion papers on matters coming before the policy makers and to oversee,
 under the direction of the Standing Committee and the Secretariat,
 the party's day-to-day operations. The men who run these depart-
 ments are in charge of the party's interests in propaganda, police,
 rural, industrial, finance and trade, communications, united front,
 and party organization work as well as liaison with foreign parties.
 They make many of the daily decisions on how party policies are to be
 executed within their areas of competence. They are in a sense going
 through the last and highest training course which the party offers its
 future leaders.
 The Committees (really sub-committees) under the Central Com-
 mittee are on the same level as the departments but differ in that they
 tend to meet irregularly as the occasion or the leaders demand. Like
 other committees, they probably have permanent standing bodies.
 Included are the Committee for Organs Directly Subordinate to the
 Central Committee, the Committee for Central State Organs and the
 Women's Work Committee.
 Two important commissions, the Control Commission and the
 Military Affairs Commission, also come just under the Central
 Committee on party organization charts.  They are discussed below.
 The next generation
 The top levels of the party are nicely layered according to age and
 party seniority.  Virtually all of the top leaders went through the

 crucible of the Long March, a 6,000-mile hegira in 1934-1936 which
 transferred the party's base from Kiangsi to Shensi Province.  The
 Long Marchers are getting on.  Mao is ahnost 70 and most of his
 key advisers are over 60.  The new generation will probably be
 dominated by another brand of Communist whose formative years
 in the party were in the fight against the Japanese.
 After they take over, it is possible that many of the old Maoist
 ways will go.  The new group will very likely not have the remarkable
 measure of cohesiveness of Mao's group.  Most of the new men,
 including its leading figures, will have made their mark in the party
 apparatus.  It is possible, however, that by the ti rie the new group
 gets entrenched officials who have made their mark in economic,
 scientific, or other specialties will begin to exert greater influence in
 high policy making levels.
 The party and the state
 In Communist China the p~arty's field of direct interest and influence
 extends into every nook and cranny of the government and military
 establishment, of every economic or scientific installation, of every
 education institution.  "The party must, and can, lead all-the state
 organs, the armed forces, the people's bodies," runs a typical instruc-
 tion to party workers.
 Party control is brought to bear by the assignmet of trusted party
 members to positions, usually of authority, in all non-party organiza-
 tions.  Called "leading members' groups," they are assigned by an
 appropriate party committee.  The Central Committee determines
 the makeup of the "leading members' groups" in central government
 offices; provincial committees do the same for the provincial govern-
 ments, county committees for the counties.  These "leading members'
 groups" remain under the direction of their assigning committees,
 not under a "leading members' group" in a superior non-party
 organization.
 the party has a number of full-tine workers who perform no job
 outside the party, but the majority work in government offices, in
 the military, in economic and cultural establislimonts, or in people's
 organizations.  They remain under strict party discipline.  Failure
 to detect and report without delay the slightest shortcoming, from
 the party's point of view, would open them to serious charges.
 The pattern of party influence brought to bear by party members
 is repeated at the working level.  Every basic level installation, be it
 factory, mine, collective farm, or military unit, has its own party
 organization appointed by an appropriate party committee.  It is the
 duty of the party organizations to transmit party policy and see to
 it that the policy is understood and implemented completely.  They
 must adapt the policies, as necessary, to local conditions.
 THE STRUCTURE FOR STAFFING PARTY ORGANIZATIONS
 The leading bodies
 The 1956 party constitution declares that the National Party
 Congress is the "highest leading body" of the part .  It is elected.
 But the timing of its election, the number of delegates, and the
 manner in whieii they are elected are controlled by the "in" group.
 The "in's" reserve to themselves the right to run members of superior

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA  9
 party organizations "who need to be elected" in local elections.
 They also can cancel the election of anyone they deem "inadequate."
 The present Eighth Congress was elected in 1956 for a term of five
 years.  It is still in office.  Its opening session was attended by just
 over 1,000 delegates.  The party's first congress, in 1921, was
 attended by twelve.
 A party congress provides a forum for the airing of party policies,
 but its most important task is to elect a Central Committee to act
 for it when it is not in session.  The importance of this provision
 derives from the infrequency with which National Party Congresses
 are convened.  The Eighth has met but twice, in 1956 and 1958,
 despite provisions in the party constitution, which it adopted, that
 it meet once a year.  In fact, during the six and one-half years it has
 been in office it has met in session for a grand total of 32 days.
 The present Central Committee, the eighth, came to office in 1956,
 the result of a carefully contrived electoral process designed by the
 party center to bring minimal disturbance to the then existing hier-
 archical arrangements.  It was an "election with leadership."  The
 top leaders decided on the number of candidates who would stand for
 election, named them and arranged the electoral lists in proper order
 of precedence.
 All of this took a lot of arranging, and may have prompted a lead-
 ing party figure to warn that "too many elections are unnecessary
 and may handicap our work." The party has generally followed his
 advice.
 Theoretically at least, ultimate authority for the disposition of im-
 portant personnel matters rests in the Central Committee.  The 1956
 party constitution spells this out: the Central Committee, it states,
 "takes charge of and allocates party cadres."  (The term cadre, in
 Chinese kanpu, is applied by the Chinese Communists to officials and
 functionaries in both the party and the government and is used in
 either an individual or a group sense.) When the Central Committee
 is not in plenary session, its powers and functions, including those
 involving the disposition of cadres, pass to the Politburo, its Standing
 Committee and the Secretariat, all elected by the Central Committee.
 The Eighth Central Committee has met in plenary session 10 times
 for a total of some 75 days since 1956.
 In practice, therefore, its authority over cadre regulation is dele-
 gated to its continuing bodies.  The highest authority in personnel,
 as in all other matters, doubtless rests with Mao Tse-tung.  It is
 likely that Mao still takes an active interest in assignments to key
 positions, since any other course could carry grave dangers for him.
 A number of lesser personnel actions may ultimately be referred to
 him for decision. There is bound, for example, to be serious competi-
 tion among various departments of China's national security setup
 for skilled manpower and managerial talent, which are among the
 nation's scarcest resources.
 He is very likely assisted in his deliberations on these matters by
 his four active assistants on the Standing Committee with Liu Shao-
 chi and Teng Hsiao-ping representing the party's interests, Chou
 En-lai the government's and Lin Piao those of the military establish-
 ment.  Communist China is not known to have a system, as do the
 Soviets, which specifies just which non-party jobs require the stamp
 of approval of what party body.  The Chinese system is in general

 10 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 highly centralized, and the Standing Committee may well require
 that it pass on all recommendations ?or appointments to key jobs in
 the party central organs, in the. government's top bodices in economic,
 cultural and scientific enterprises of national security si  ificance, in
 the armed forces and in the regions and provinces.  Tile Standing
 Committee doubtless reserves for itself the right to determine just
 what constitutes a "key" assignment requiring its O.K.
 In acting on proposals for filling "key" jobs, Mao and the Standing
 Committee rely heavily upon the Secretariat, through which relateca
 personnel records and data are channeled.  As the directing and co-
 ordinating agency for the regular central organizations of the party,
 the Secretariat can probably approve on its own appointments to it
 range of positions below those on which the Standing Committee and
 Mao act.  In any case, the principal figure on the Secretariat, Teng
 IIsiao-ping, is also in Mao's inner circle, a circumstance which doubt-
 less gives him vast authority in the personnel field.  He is, at a
 minimum, the needle's eye through which a man mu3t pass on his
 way to a position of real authority.
 Teng's assistants on the Secretariat oversee the work of one or
 another of the party's central organs and through them exert con-
 siderable influence on central government offices.  These assistants
 are very likely responsible for advising Teng and the Secretariat on
 those aspects of a candidate's party standing and qualifications which
 fall within the competence of their particular departments.  They
 can probably act directly on a certain level of position within their
 own areas.  Most of these secretaries have had long experience in
 party organizational work.
 The central departments
 Neither the Standing Committee, the Politburo nor the Secretariat
 is sufficiently rich in personnel to discharge in detail the_ constitutional
 charge which devolves on them "to take charge of and allocate cadres."
 The size of this job is suggested by the fact that in 1950, the last year
 for which figures are at hand, there were over 300,000 party cadres
 at the county committee level and higher.  The 1963 total is surely
 higher.  So, again, much of the function is delegated to bodies which
 the Central Committee has set up, and staffed, to be its executive
 agents in its "diverse businesses."  Among these are the Or ranization
 Department, the Control Commission  the Committee Tor Party
 Organs Directly Subordinate to the i antral Committee, and the
 Committee for Central State Organs, Other central departments
 play lesser roles.
 `file Organization Department, though no ion-er the power it
 once was, still plays a strong hand in the administration of party
 cadres.  Prior to 1954, it controlled most aspects of party personnel
 management.  It had responsibility for recruitment, training, assign-
 ment, promotion, transfer of party cadres as well as the maintenance
 of party personnel records, the collection of party clues and the
 investigation of party members' reliability.  In 1954 the party
 elders discovered that the then chief of the Organizationr Department,
 Jao Shu-ship, had been attempting to use the office to unseat them.
 He was removed forthwith, and the Organization Department was
 shorn of many of its powers.
 A 1959 study, written by the Research Office of the post-Jao
 Organization Department for the use of its cadres, explains the role

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST      A
 of the Organization Department as that of a "deputy and staff chief"
 to party committees for cadre administration.  The study is studded
 with warnings that the Organization Department ought not "stick
 its nose into the proper business of others."  It must, rather, keep to
 its "own share" of the administration of party cadres and party
 members.
 This share is not inconsiderable.  The study explains that the
 Organization Department remains active in the selection, promotion
 and training of party cadres and in "developing" party members.
 It still handles the records of party personnel.  It probably still has
 much to do with the placement of party men in positions which the
 higher levels, the Secretariat and the Standing Committee, do not
 keep in their own hands.
 The present head of the Organization Department is An Tzu-wen
 who was a deputy under Jao but definitely not his accomplice.  An
 was once Minister of Personnel of the Central Government, and
 played a large part in the big initial effort to staff the new government
 (1950-1954).
 Some of the functions formerly given the Organization Department
 have probably been entrusted to the Committee for Party Organs
 Directly Subordinate to the Central Committee.  Little has been
 said about this unit, but its name suggests it was conceived to super-
 vise the party's central organs, keep them informed on policy matters,
 and, perhaps, to assist in handling their ordinary staffing needs.  It
 is headed by Yang Shang-kun, who is concurrently Director of the
 Central Committee's General Office and an alternate secretary of the
 Secretariat.  Like An Tzu-wen, Yang is not a party heavyweight.
 He has seemed, rather, to be a trustworthy administrative functionary
 who sees to the routine office tasks of the Central Committee, handles
 correspondence and maintains records.
 Other of the old Organization Department's functions probably
 went to the Committee for Central State Organs, which is believed to
 regulate the work of party members who have been placed in jobs with
 the central government.  It is not known how big a role this com-
 mittee plays in the assignment, promotion or tiansfer of party mem-
 bers in the government.                              The pattern could possibly be an advisory
 role for higher positions, a more assertive role for lower ones.  The
 committee is headed by Kung Tzu-jung, who is concurrently an
 alternate member of the Control Commission, Yang's deputy in the
 General Office and a Deputy Secretary General of the State Council.
 The control commission
 A principal element of Jao's power in the old Organization Depart-
 ment, that of investigating the loyalty of party members, has passed
 entirely to the Control Commission.  The 1945 party constitution
 had provided for the establishment of both central and local control
 commissions, but prior to 1955 they were never set up.  In their
 stead, a system of discipline inspection teams was established.  They
 were empowered to deal with specific breaches of party discipline only
 after they had occurred.  The inadequacy of these arrangements was
 clearly exposed by the case of Kao Kang and Jao Shu-shih, two
 prominent party figures who were expelled from the party in 1954 for
 trying to split the party and usurp supreme power.  The party con-
 ference which expelled the pair also decided to establish strong control

 ApprolTI fA RRe~Rt   ~   /n b    ~SS6  ~$  3   ~~     0038-0
 commissions, at both the central and local levels. The new commis-
 sions were given the power to investigate a party member before a
 breach of discipline took place.  They were charged with preventing
 a recurrence of so serious a case as the "anti arty ihlliance" of Kao
 Bang and Jao Shu-ship.  Unlike the earlier discipline inspection
 teams, the new commissions were specifically empowered by the
 conference to check up on party organizations, though discipline was
 to be meted out on an individual basis.
 Working under the direction of party committees a,, the same level,
 control commissions take disciplinary action against party members
 and review sentences meted out by lower levels.  Thee do not concern
 themselves with the minor day-to-day derelictions stiL handled by the
 Organization Department.  They are interested in major disciplinary
 problems like anti-Maoist plotting, and are obviously immensely
 important in the party security setup.  Their infaenee on cadre
 selection is likely to be largely negative, A party nember coining
 under their purview is not a good candidate for further advancement.
 The central Control Commission is an elite group.  It is set some-
 what apart from other of the party's central departments and com-
 mittees in that its leading personnel are elected.                                     The Commission
 was "strengthened" by the election of additional, buj unnamed, new
 members at the tenth plenum of the Central Committee, September
 1962.  It has a priority claim on personnel and its staff apparatus
 appears to be one of the best developed of any central party organ.
 It has been headed since its inception by Tung Pi-wu, the only original
 founder of the Chinese Communist Party outside of Mao Tse-tung
 still active.  An aged though not inconsiderable figure. Tung is ranked
 seventh in the Central Committee and is the first Vice Chairman of
 the Government.  Among Tung's principal deputies is Liu Lan-tao,
 who combines a position on the commission with being a member of
 the powerful Secretariat. ' Another is a high ranking officer in the
 General Political Department of the Any, the office charged with the
 political indoctrination of the army.  A third was until 1960 Minister
 of Interior (previously Minister of Supervision).  The three would
 seem to be the principal figures in overseeing the conduct of members
 working respectively, in the party, the military establ_sliinent and the
 government.
 Other central organs which play a role in personnel management
 include the Propaganda Department, which handles the education and
 indoctrination of part= members.  This is an immen;e job on which
 the Chinese party lavishes time, money and effort.  The propaganda
 Department is headed by Lu Ting-vi, who is also a member of the
 Secretariat.  The Social Affairs Department plays a shadowy and
 unexplained role in the never-ending job of policing the part   Li
 Ko-nung was the head of this organ until his death in 1961.  it may
 have declined in importance since his death.
 The Women's Work Committee keeps an eye on the interests of
 female party members.  Roughly 10 percent of par sy members are
 women, although the percentage drops sharply as you move up in
 the hierarchy.  There are, for example, only four women on the
 Central Committee.  The ranking female comrade, Tsai Chang (AMrs.
 Li Fu-chun), is also head of the Women's Work Committee.  The
 committee works to overcome "discrimination" :against women
 cadres and see that they get the same opportunities for advancement

 TAFFINGI PROCEDURES AND PR
 as male cadres.  "Some organizations," Tsai Chang once complained,
 "tend to promote more men than women even when choosing between
 persons of equal competence."  The United Front Department takes
 charge of the party's relations with cooperating organizations and
 nationalities groups.  It probably has some say in the selection of
 individuals from such organizations for various posts.
 Regional, provincial, and county posts
 The constitution permits the Central Committee of the party, as it
 deems necessary, to establish bureaus covering several provinces.
 Such regional bureaus existed between 1949 and 1954.  They were
 abolished after the Kao-Jao incident and were not revived until
 January 1961, when the need for a more coordinated regional attack
 on some of the party's problems impressed itself upon the leaders.
 The parallel government and military bodies which existed in the
 1949-1954 period have not reappeared, at least publicly.  Today
 there are six regional bureaus of the Central Committee-the North-
 east, North, East, Central-South, Southwest, and Northwest.                             Pei-
 ping has been uncommonly sparing of detail concerning their re-
 sponsibilities and makeup.  The post-1961 versions appear to range
 across roughly the same spectrum of interests as party committees
 at other levels.  Each of them apparently has the authority to create
 such subordinate organizations as it feels are needed.  Their staffing
 patterns seem still to be in the developmental stage, though many
 of them have begun to staff the usual run of subordinate departments
 for propaganda, rural work, finance and the like.       No regional
 organization departments or control commissions have yet been
 identified.
 The leading personnel of the regional bureaus are selected directly
 by the party center.  The individuals named are probably then
 allowed to fill out their own staffs.  The present regional bosses
 are senior party officials, drawn some from Peiping and some from
 the provinces.  The Northeast Bureau is headed by Sung Jen-
 chiung, who was in charge of an important central government
 ministry.  The East China, and Southwest Bureaus, on the other hand,
 are headed by individuals drawn from the Shanghai municipal and
 Szechwan provincial party apparati, respectively.  Both are Polit-
 buro members.
 These bureaus probably do have certain personnel powers and func-
 tions.  They assist the party center in assessing job performance
 of provincial leaders.  Since responsibilities at the regions are broader
 than in the provinces, the regional posts may be a proving grounds
 for higher posts with the party center.
 The staffing pattern at the provincial level is a virtual carbon copy
 of that in Peiping.     Autonomous regions and cities directly under
 central authority (like Shanghai) are treated as provinces.  A pro-
 vincial congress is elected, and elects in turn a provincial committee
 to act for the congress when it is not in session.  The provincial
 committee elects a standing committee to act in its stead when it is
 not in session as well as a secretariat to handle its "daily work."
 These provincial posts are important-10 of the 21 Chinese prov-
 inces have populations of between 20 and 60 million-and the party
 center takes no chances.  It wrote into the constitution that the num-
 ber of members of a provincial committee will be set by the Central

 Committee and that the members of a provincial standing committee
 and secretariat must be approved by the Central Committee.  So
 must party committee members in key industrial cities and cities
 with a population of over 500,000 (of which China has some 35).
 Like its counterpart in Peiping, the provincial committee has the
 constitutional authority "to take charge of and allocate party cadres,"
 but the Central Committee establishes the controlling regulations.
 In practice, effective provincial responsibility over cadres is most
 likely exercised by the standing committee (for the higher provincial
 jobs) and by the provincial departments (for lesser po3ts).
 Provincial committees are empowered to set up their own depart-
 ments.                             Most of them have an organization department, the duties
 of which are determined by the provincial committees.  Provincial
 organization departments are involved, when local conditions and
 their instructions permit, in the assignment and promotion of cadres
 coming under provincial control.  Provincial departit_ents are under
 the authority of the provincial party committee, not under the
 corresponding department at the party center.  The latter has only
 what Peiping terms a "guidance relationship" with its provincial
 counterparts.
 The stalling of party organizations at the county level is similar
 to the pattern at the more exalted levels.

 Admission
 The party constitution says that membership in the party is open
 to any Chinese, ago 18 and over, who works and doe:; not exploit the
 labor of others.  The entrance process can be initiated b  the indi-
 vidual or by the party.  Ile must be sponsored by two full members.
 In either case, the individual involved must fill out a detailed applica-
 tion.  The most important entries involve his fainil  and personal
 background, communist works he has been influenced by, a personal
 evaluation of his good and bad points, and a statement as to why he
 wishes to join the party.  Ile must be approved by a, general member-
 ship meeting of it Harty branch.  After being accept-d by the branch
 meeting, the application is forwarded to the next higher committee
 for review.  Tins committee assigns a functionary to examine care-
 fully the candidates application form and to interview hint in detail.
 After approval by the committee, the applicant becomes a proba-
 tionary member of the party.  He. stays in this status for one year,
 (luring which he is subjected to an "elementary arty* education" and
 to the close observation of the party branch. When the test year is
 over, his case again comes before the branch meeting.  His party
 age is computed from the day he is accepted by the branch as a full
 member, though lie must stir go through the form. lity of being ap-
 proved by the next higher committee.  At any point, in this process a
 strong objection by any one involved can kill [lie applicant's chances.
 Admission into the Chinese Communist Party is achieved more
 easily in the periods when the party runs drives to acid new members;
 for example, there was a big upswing in admissions during the com-
 mune and "leap forward" movements in 1958-1959.  These are fol-
 lowed by periods of consolidation when entrancerequirements are more
 strenuously applied.
 Since 195G there no longer have liven different procedures prescribed
 for applicants of different class backgrounds.  But it is, nevertheless,
 relatively easy for it Chinese with it "clean" class background-parents
 who were workers or peasants-to get into the party.  Such an indi-
 vidual would more likely be asked to apply, and he night even find his
 probationary period shortened.  On the oilier hand, it is not unknown
 for an applicant with an "unclean" background to be met with delay-
 ing tactics which might last. several years.  Indeed a bad back-
 ground--a parent who was in the Kuomintang, for example  could in
 practice preclude admission.
 Members in good standing of the Youth League a sort of junior
 party organization, are accepted almost autotnaticaliy.  Another rich
 source of party material is in the ranks of the nonparty "activist."
 This is one of the very best ways for an outsider to conic to the. favor-
 able notice of a local party boss.  An "activist" serves the party by
 leading the less active masses at study meetings and during production
 drives.
 The qualities which the party wants in its members include an
 unquestioning zeal, a strong measure of asceticism, and a dash, no
 snore, of individuality.  The party wants a man who will place the
 interests of the party above his own, a man with no aims or ambitions,
 indeed no life, outside the party.  He must demonstrate instan-
 taneous obedience to party discipline.  It is his "holy ditty" to carry
 out party policy without reservation even if he disagrees with it,

 though at the same time he is expected to be skilled in adapting the
 policy to local peculiarities.  He must in all things be an exemplar
 to the masses, while sharing their "jobs and sorrows, their hard and
 frugal life." He should display leadership potential.
 Of course, not all Chinese Communist Party members measure up
 to these high-flown standards.  What the party gets in practice is
 considerably more limited, especially at the basic levels.  Here the
 party is apt to settle for obedience and political reliability.
 Appraisal and promotion
 The basic party organization, the branch, makes periodic appraisals
 of each of its members.  The appraisal process begins with the indi-
 vidual's own analysis of himself.  This is then discussed by his branch
 colleagues who have been observing him and forming views as to his
 suitability.  The "self-criticisms and criticisms" thus collected are
 supplemented by regular personal interviews between the individual
 member and one of his party betters.  Another higher official may
 collate and sum up all of this material.  Branch appraisals are
 supposed to take into account the member's personal history and work
 record, his merits and demerits, his capabilities and limitations.
 They become a part of a member's permanent party record.
 Over a period of time these appraisals enable the party apparatus
 to make judgments of a member's particular worth and identify those
 who are ready to be moved to positions of higher responsibility.  Al-
 though there have been hints that a sort of rough grading system does
 exist within the party, it is not apparently as firm and well-developed
 a system as exists in the Chinese government and military.  An indi-
 vidual's rank in the party seems largely to be determined by the level
 of the apparatus at which he works and his duties at that level.  There
 are references, for example, to party secretaries at the county level
 which suggest that the party regards this as equivalent to a grade
 designation.
 According to party instructions, the selection of cadres for promo-
 tion and transfer should proceed on the basis of a systematic plan and
 on a "unified"-that is, controlled by the higher levels-basis.  The
 entire history and work of the member being considered for reassign-
 ment is to be taken into account.  His party record, likely to be a
 voluminous file for any but the newest recruit, will be studied, and the
 opinions of his superiors, his equals, and his subordinates sought.   He
 may be brought in for a personal interview by a ranking member of
 the office for which he is being considered.  Even if he is not selected,
 the party argues that this sort of screening is good.  The individual
 gains a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses, while
 the party is enabled to place him in his proper spot.
 "In our fundamental evaluations of a member's work," Mao has
 said, "we must establish whether his achievements amount to 30 per-
 cent and his mistakes to 70 percent, or vice versa.  If his achievements
 amount to 70 percent, then his work should in the main be approved."
 Most of the criteria advocated by the party to guide the selection
 process are, however, highly subjective (e.g., a high degree of com-
 munist consciousness) and leave the selectors without much meaning-
 ful guidance.  Hence, much to the party's professed annoyance, great
 emphasis is put in practice on seniority and personal relationships.
 A former party member has recalled that the prime requirement for
 Approved For Release 2004/05/12 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200010038-0
 0038-0
 most any post was to have served a certain length of time in the party.
 The more responsible the post, the longer the period.  Others have
 testified that the prejudices of the higher cadres constituted a most
 important factor.
 Party writings make it very clear that the leaders want advance-
 ment based on other criteria.  Guidelines from the Organization
 Department to party workers involved in the assignment and promo-
 tion process stipulate that they should resolutely avoid the practice of
 assigning and promoting solely on the basis of seniority.  Teng Ilsino-
 ping has called this reliance the most serious defect in the party's
 cadre policy.
 The party says it wants advancement to be based both on the mem-
 ber's  "virtue,"  meaning  his ideological reliability,  and  "ability,"
 ualifications.  As the party's role has broad-
 meaning his technical qualifications."
 ened over the years, and especially since it took over he Chinese
 mainland, the emphasis put on the second part of the equation has
 increased.  A recent party work, for example, declared that pre-
 ferment in the party will increasingly depend on how well the member
 improves his technical skill.  But the party has not, and probably
 never will, permit the latter to outweigh the former.
 Party education
 Great emphasis is placed by the party leaders on their "education"
 programs.  Indeed, a cadre's attitude toward and a titude for study
 will be duly entered on his appraisal forms,  "To be lazy ..bout study
 shows a defective sense of responsibility toward the patty," runs a
 party injunction, which adds that all cadres, old and new, in leading
 positions or on the lower levels, must study.
 Indeed, the need is deep.  The Chinese party is the largest in the
 world.  The general educational level of its members is low.  At its
 lower levels, literacy is limited.  And the problem is complicated by
 the fact that members with comparatively good educational back-
 grounds are not trusted as fully as the "good 'Lear t ed" ch;nicnts with
 it sound class background but a poor education.
 Cadre training programs are basically of two kinds, ideological and
 technical.  The amt is to educate the loyal and convert the educated.
 The ideological part is the better developed.  It is constan 1, pervasive,
 repetitious, in all party organs, in schools, in offices, in the armed
 forces.  Wherever a party man goes, no matter how "virtuous" he
 may be, he will be assigned to a study group.  He will be required to
 attend its regular study meetings, which may average two a week, to
 discuss approvingly the latest twists and turns of the party line.
 These meetings are, from time to time as the party center directs,
 supplemented by special study, sessions of several weeks duration.
 One such series was conducted in the early part of 1962 on the duties
 and rights of party members.  Members are, of course, believers when
 they join and these never-ending doses of indoctrination are intended
 to prevent backsliding.
 The first training offered a party member outside the scope of his
 own study group is very likely to be at a short course run by one of the
 basic level organs.  Members are rotated through such schools for
 one, two or three months of instruction in the basic tenets of com-
 munism.  He probably will attend such courses a number of times
 during his service at lower levels.  Lecturers may be leading cadres of

 the unit giving the course, or they may be individuals whose only
 duty is to provide this instruction.
 At the county level, these courses are apt to be given at a regular
 institution maintained by the county committee.  Here leading
 cadres of the county party organization receive refresher courses and
 cadres earmarked for such positions receive a more sophisticated
 version of the instruction at lower levels.  For the party is convinced
 that the higher a cadre rises, the broader his understanding of com-
 munism needs be.
 So his ideological education goes on, conceivably right up to his
 being selected, if his future placement requires it, for a course of study
 at one of the institutions run by the party's Central Committee, the
 Higher Party School or the Central Research Institute.  These train
 high theoretical cadres or give them an opportunity for research in
 the field.  They may also give more generalized courses for cadres
 destined for service in key posts with departments of the Central
 Committee.
 The Central Committee's Propaganda Department plays a big role
 in all of this ideological training.  It provides the study materials,
 from basic texts by Marx, Engels, Lenin, to collections of Mao's works
 and the relevant party documents.     It is in direct control of the key
 party publications, the newspaper People's Daily and the magazine
 Red Flag.  It may help by providing guidance on party schooling to
 the lower levels.
 However pressing the need for all of this ideological training, the
 party also recognizes that party members must be given the oppor-
 tunity to attain a measure of expertness in the work to which they are
 assigned.  In order fully to deserve the trust placed in them, the party
 says, members must have more than a talent to "chatter away on
 political subjects."  If a cadre is assigned to work with the peasants,
 he is expected to study farm technique; if sent to an economic installa-
 tion, he is expected to learn something of its processes; if sent to
 oversee scientific research, he is expected to sop up some scientific
 knowledge.
 In order to do this, he may be entered in a regular educational insti-
 tution such as a middle school, university, or a technical, trade or
 vocational institute, either as a full- or part-time student.  One of the
 wide variety of short courses, offering highly specialized and concen-
 trated instruction in a narrow curriculum, may be the party's choice for
 him.  He may be left to learn as much as he can on the job by picking
 the brains of the experts working there.  He may merely be strongly
 urged to attend spare-time classes or devote himself to off-duty study.
 Opportunities for technical training in today's China are limited, but
 whatever is available is at the party's beck and call.
 As an individual moves up in the party, he is expected to broaden
 out.  He will be assigned different duties, in accordance with the party
 needs, and will probably receive related training.  And he may in
 time become one of the party's cherished "versatile hands," a trusted
 party man with a variety of posts in his background who is ready for
 bigger things.
 Party incentives
 The primary attraction of party membership is probably the fact
 that the party runs things.  This cannot escape the notice of anyone
 Approved For Release 2004/05/12 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200010038-0
 Appvq~g$/,Q1o1      6~i~AQ010038-0
 in China.  Party membership opens doors to positions in government,
 in the military, in universities, in fact everywhere.  The h' hest, or
 . .19
 at least the most powerful, positions are invariably} occupied fry party
 figures.  A young Chinese who wishes to get ahead -scill doubtless
 regard party membership as the indispensable key and work for the
 day of his admission.  'Phe party leadership regards tl.is as a base
 motive for joining.
 Promotion is probably the main material incentive offered the party
 men.  There are undeniable perquisites that go with party office.
 The higher the office, the greater the perquisites.  While direct wages
 are pegged to equivalent non-party levels, advantages in housing,
 medical care, and recreational facilities accrue to party officials. The
 are also apt to get a break on scarce items like meat, sugar, vegetable
 oil, cloth, and cigarettes.  It would be risky business for a restaurant
 to fail to pay special attention to a party boss.
 But the road to the perquisites of thus type is it long and arduous
 one.  On the way- up, the party member will have to be sustained
 largely by less material incentives, like the comfort of being one of
 an acknowledged elite which has a mission of doing somthing about
 building China.  Beyond this psychological balm, there is the prac-
 tical authority which his membership confers on him.  TLere is always
 some individual, some group, for the party man to "leac."
 If considerations of personal advantage over the long pull are not
 sufficient to keep the party nian bent to the party's wift_ there is the
 constant threat of prolonged sessions of criticism and .elf-criticism.
 These "educational" sessions can be long and unbelievably tedious.
 It is, according to many who have gone through such sessions, most
 difficult to withstand these partly mental, partly physical, onslaughts.
 If an individual does resist, the party can move on to disciplinary
 action.  Punishments are: (1) warning, (2) serious warning, (3) re-
 moval from party posts, (4) retention for observatioL within the
 party, and (5) expulsion from the party.
 There is also the possibility of being sent down to a production unit,
 usually a farm, for a period of labor reform.  In fact, the party
 regards this as such a good scheme that it cadre, even a loading cadre,
 can find himself assigned to one of these periods of "proletarianization"
 without his having done a thing wrong.
 Other threats, of course, hang over the party member.  Ile can be
 turned over to the state supervisory apparatus, which can, if the
 offense is serious enough, mete out more extreme forms of punishment.
 The dangers of running afoul of the control apparatus are partic-
 ularly great when the party center is running one of its periodic
 campaigns to "rectify" party members.  Then they can conceivably
 be charged with any one of a variety of vague, ill-defined sins.  They
 must beware and re-double their efforts to satisfy their party betters.
 The utility of this sort of negative incentive should not be under-
 estimated.

 III. STAFFING THE GOVERNMENT
 The Chinese Communists conceive of the Government of the
 People's Republic of China as the executive instrumentality for carry-
 ing out policies decided by the party.                                           The task they give the govern-
 ment is to help formulate and then execute plans for the implementa-
 tion of the party's general line.  This is a huge job since the govern-
 ment has to regulate not only such normal national security functions
 as defense, diplomacy and peace and order, but also a wide range of
 activities taken over by the communists, from industrial production
 to domestic and foreign trade, sports and even radio broadcasting.
 As a result, China's bureaucratic apparatus is immense.
 The party organization remains separate and distinct from that of
 the government.  The party as an organization stays clear of actual
 governmental administration.  Party members are, however, spotted
 all through the government, from top to bottom.  It is through their
 efforts that, in the words of a veteran communist, "the administrative
 agencies of the government are made to accept policies of the party
 and turn them into policies of the government."
 STAFFING REQUIREMENTS FOR SENIOR POSTS
 The nominal number-one job in the government, the Chairman of
 the Republic, is largely a procedural and ceremonial post.  The
 Chairman is the formal chief of state.  He has no direct control, by
 virtue of his government position, over the State Council or the minis-
 tries, which together handle the real administrative chores of the
 government.  However, in Communist China, the chief of state has in
 fact been a figure of commanding importance by virtue of his party
 position.  The first Chairman of the Republic, Mao Tse-tung, resigned
 in 1959 and was succeeded by Liu Shao-chi.

 The chief executive is the premier, the principal officer of the State
 Council.  The post is held by Chou Rn-lai.  The Stain Council
 includes 16 vice premiers (one of whom, Pent' Teh-huai, is in disfavor
 and inactive), and some 30 ministers and heads of commissions plus
 a secretary general.  This group has such authority as is given the
 government to make high-level decisions necessary for carrying out
 national security policies.  The premier and 12 of the 16 vice premiers
 are members of the Politburo; the other four are high ranking Central
 Committee members.
 Broad functional control under the State Council is exercised by
 its six staff offices.  These operate as more or less permanent co-
 ordinating committees, with a varying number of related ministries
 under their purview.    They are the government counterprrt.s of the
 party's central departments,  Besides these staff offices, the State
 Council's Secretariat and the premier's office provide general co-
 ordinative functions.                                       The Secretariat serves as the official link
 between the council and provincial and local administrations.  The
 premier's office contains his personal staff` performing such functions
 as lie directs.
 What does the party center look for in [lie men it assigns to jobs
 on the State Council?  Mao Tse-tung and his confederates are
 doubtless looking for individuals who: 1) have a Iona p and spotless
 party history; 2) have a demonstrated competence in ttie r.dministra.

 its best career officers and administrators.  Membership on the
 Central Committee identifies a man who has spent virtually all his
 adult life in the management of increasingly important affairs.
 Since 1949 this experience has, for some of them, included nationwide
 responsibilities in certain fields.
 Non-Communists have been appointed to head ministries in the
 central government, but never to those involving national security
 functions.  Non-Communists head ministries which handle things
 like water conservancy and postal services.  Even then, the non-
 Communist minister will inevitably have a first vice minister who is
 a reliable party man and acts its a minister in everything but name.
 Some ministries, such as the ministries of foreign affairs, public secur-
 ity, and defense do not use nonparty members in any but the most
 menial positions.
 Party members predominate even at the second level.  Over 80
 percent of the 300 vice ministers and vice chairmen of eoinmissions
 are party men.  Party membership for the bureaucracy is a whole is
 more difficult to determine.,  An Tzu-wen reported that in 1956 one-
 third of the total number of cadres working at the county level or
 above were either party or youth league members.  It may be that
 the proportion of party to nonparty cadres cited by An could apply
 to tine bureaucracy as a whole; the same proportion liar been noted
 in the U.S.S.R.
 It might be noted that party membership accounts for only 4 per-
 cent of the general population of over 15 years of age.  The concen-

 tration of party members grows steadily heavier as you move up in
 the governmental machinery until it reaches 100 percent at the level
 of the vice premier and above.
 STRUCTURE FOR STAFFING GOVERNMENT OFFICES
 The state council
 The 1954 constitution of the Chinese People's Republic declares
 that the National People's Congress is the "highest organ of state
 power." Its more than 1,200 deputies are elected.  Sessions of the
 congress have been short, less frequent than called for in the constitu-
 tion, and confined to rubber-stamping actions taken elsewhere.  The
 congress elects the Chairman of the People's Republic of China as
 well as a Standing Committee to be its "permanent working organ"
 when it is not in session.  The present Standing Committee has some
 60 members.
 The chairman formally appoints the premier, subject to the
 approval of the National People's Congress.  He appoints, on the
 recommendation of the premier, the other members of the State-
 Council-the vice premiers, ministers, heads of commissions and the
 secretary general.  After the premier's nominations have been
 "decided" by a congress (or its Standing Committee), they are
 formally appointed to their jobs by the chairman.  The provisions
 for congressional approval are no more than window-dressing for
 decisions made at the party center.
 The chairman appoints in addition a number of other ranking
 officials in national security jobs, such as the Chief of the General
 Staff, the directors of the main departments in the Ministry of Na-
 tional Defense, the president and vice presidents of the Academy of
 Sciences.  While the standing committee is empowered to appoint
 and remove ambassadors and heads of mission abroad, the chairman
 dispatches and recalls these plenipotentiary representatives.  Al-
 though these appointments are the responsibility of the chairman,
 they are likely made upon the recommendation of the premier.   The
 total number of top posts requiring the nomination and appointment
 of the chairman and premier probably numbers less than 100, roughly
 half of which are jobs controlling national security programs.
 The second level
 Selection of the second echelon of government executives is legally
 the prerogative of the State Council.  This second echelon includes
 the directors of the important staff offices of the State Council, the
 heads of specialized agencies of the State Council, the deputy ministers
 and assistant ministers, the commission vice chairmen and members,
 as well as all chiefs and deputies of the divisions, bureaus, and offices
 which make up the ministries.  In the military field, the appointing
 responsibility of the Council extends to commanders and political
 commissars at the division level (more than 300 positions).  In the
 foreign field it includes embassy counselors and consul generals.
 The State Council appoints all key personnel in the important
 financial, commercial, or industrial enterprises administered by the
 25 economic ministries.  Important administrative posts in the field
 of higher education are also controlled by the State Council.  Alto-
 gether the State Council probably controls a minimum of 2,000

 20010038-0
 executive jobs in the government.  All of them require reference to
 the party before being finalized.
 In adron to specific responsibilities for appointing administrative
 personnel, the State Council is ultimately responsible for the govern-
 ment's staffing policies.  The State Council, for example, as a part
 of each long term and annual plan makes an allocation of manpower
 resources according to nationally determined priorities and, in effect,
 programs the development of now skills needed in China's industrial-
 ization.
 The Secretary General and Secretariat of the State Council are
 key positions in the exercise of these council responsibilities.  The
 Secretary General is Ilsi Chung-hsun, a high-ranking Central Com-
 mittee member and a vice premier.  Prior to moving to Peiping, he
 had been an important figure in party affairs in Northwest China.
 Ile is assisted by ten deputies who are all party personalities.  More
 than half of them have concurrent responsibilities in the party per-
 sonnel machine.  One of them, Kung 'I.'zu-jung, holds the following
 positions in the central departments of the party: head o' the Com-
 mittee for Central State Organs, member of the Control Commission,
 and deputy director of the Party Secretariat's Staff Office.  Five of
 the deputies hold concurrent responsibilities in important State Coun-
 cil personnel offices.
 The Secretariat has a special Personnel Division which appears to
 be responsible for enforcing personnel procedures, processing personnel
 actions, and maintaining personnel files on the employers working
 directly for the State Council.  In addition, Premier Chou's own office
 assists him in making personnel and policy decisions.
 Government personnel administration on lower levels is highly
 fragmented.  The Ministry of Personnel, organized in 1950 shortly
 after the government was first established, had comparatively broad
 responsibilities for government personnel selection and assignment at
 a time when the new regime was bus- filling its offices.  It was closely
 tied with the party's Organization I epartnient.  Like the Organiza-
 tion Department, the ministry has been downgraded.                                      In 1954 it was
 reduced to a specialized agency of the State 6ouncil; and in 1959 it
 was placed under the it?inistry of Internal Affairs.  During the
 period, other, more specialized organizations were created by the
 State Council to handle aspects of personnel work, such as training,
 job allocation, or various specialized groups of personnel, such as
 scientists and technicians.
 Today, the General Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of Internal
 Affairs performs the following functions for the government bureau-
 cracy as a whole:
 1. It implements the wage and welfare policies of the State
 Council and performs other personnel work assigned it by the
 council.
 2. It drafts personnel regulations and supervises the establish-
 ment of tables of organization for offices of central go vernment.
 3. It processes personnel actions, including transfers, a point-
 ments and removals of personnel in government offices down to
 the county level.
 4. It maintains personnel records.
 5. It processes the transfer and job placement of demobilized
 military personnel,
 Approved For Release 2004/05/12 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200010038-0
 0038-0
 6. It maintains liaison with and evaluates the work of personnel
 offices throughout the central government and in local govern-
 ments at the provincial, autonomous region, and special munici-
 pality level.
 The subordination of the Personnel Bureau to the Ministry of
 Internal Affairs in 1959 served to correlate the Bureau's general
 responsibility for control of the bureaucracy with the Ministry's
 responsibilities for veterans affairs, the mass mobilization of civilian
 labor crews for public works projects, and the administration of
 state welfare and relief programs.  At the time of the merger, the
 Director of the Personnel Bureau, Chang Yi-pai, was made a Vice
 Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Chang has been associ-
 ated with high level personnel work since the government was set
 up.
 Specialized personnel
 In 1956 the administration of government personnel was com-
 partmentalized in an apparent effort to improve upon the use of
 highly educated and trained Chinese-especially in high priority
 programs. The administration of two kinds of personnel with critical
 skills-"specialists" and visiting bloc technicians-was divorced from
 the general administrative system in 1956 and turned over to inde-
 pendent agencies of the State Council, the Specialists Work Bureau
 and the Foreign Experts Bureau.
 The Specialists Work Bureau is today part of the Scientific and
 Technological Commission.  It is responsible for the assignment,
 promotion and transfer of "specialists"-defined by the Chinese
 Communists as scientific workers, engineers, educators, doctors, and
 health technicians, as well as important cultural and artistic workers,
 The bureau may concern itself directly only with persons who have
 actual work experience.  The bureau may also have been charged
 with carrying out a 1956 plan to register all scientific and technological
 personnel, and with keeping it up to date.

 Advisory functions of the bureau include:
 1. To investigate unemployed "advanced intellectuals" and
 place them in the state apparatus.
 2. To investigate the assignment and working conditions of
 specialists and make recommendations to the State Council for
 improvement.

 3. To investigate the implementation of policies and laws gov-
 erning the use of specialists, and attempt to solve their problems
 and promote their fullest use.
 4. To work out plans with government departments for the
 employment of students and specialists returning to China from
 non-Communist countries.
 The second bureau established in 195G by the State Council to
 handle special personnel requirements, the Foreign Experts Bureau,
 was designed specifically to take care of bloc experts.  Prior to 19G0
 such personnel numbered in the thousands.  The Soviet specialists
 left China over two years ago, but a few hundred satellite technicians
 have remained.  The bureau still functions.  It invrstigates the tech-
 nical and scientific specialization of foreign countries (boas Communist
 and non-Communist) in the light of China's needs.           It retains
 responsibility for engaging foreign specialists, arranging their assign-
 ment in China, providing living accommodations, and writing letters
 of commendation at. the termination of their service.
 Another unit at the State Council level with important responsi-
 bilities for personnel administration is the Bureau for the Administra-
 tion of Government: Offices.  This agency provides living accommo-
 dations and security for top level government cadres, which probably
 includes the 50 officials of the State Council and may well include
 other important personnel in the ministries, commissions, and special
 agencies.
 Ministries and commissions
 Each ministry and commission has limited responsibility for
 locating, training, assigning, and promoting its rank and file.  The
 ministries carry out this responsibility through personnel bureaus, the
 directors of which, like every important administrative office in a
 ministry, are appointed by the State Council.
 The duties of a ministerial personnel bureau include the processing
 of personnel actions, maintaining personnel records, arranging leave
 and changes of assignment.  They provide general services such as
 briefing newly assigned people and arranging for their housing, cloth-
 ing, and travel.
 In one of the most important national security ministries, the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, virtually all executive positions in Peiping
 (at least 100 and perhaps as many as 200 people) as well as responsible
 officials in the foreign service (an additional 200 positions at a mini-
 mum) are administered by the State Council.
 The ministry's personnel unit controls appointment,- and assign-
 ments to middle- and junior-level posts as well as service positions.
 The ministry's general services depart.inent, rather than its personnel
 unit, negotiates with other government agencies for people trained in
 security work and assigns and transfers the more than 200 people
 working as couriers, code clerks, and physical security officers according
 to needs as fixed by the ministry.
 Recruitment and assignment
 Although the staffing objectives and machinery of the U.S. and
 Communist China contain many similarities, placement procedures
 differ significantly.  In a democratic system, the government must

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA 27
 compete with other employers for an individual's services, and per-
 sonal preferences play a large part in placement.  In Communist
 China professional, semiprofessional, and vocational school graduates
 are given little alternative but to accept service in a job assigned
 by the state.
 Professionals entering the labor force from higher educational
 institutions are assigned positions by the institutions on the basis of
 rosters prepared by the ministry which administers the institutions.
 The Ministry of Education administers general liberal arts schools,
 and the Ministry of National Defense and. economic ministries run
 technical and scientific institutes.
 Students earmarked for jobs in national security organs generally
 have had their course of study sponsored by a specific organization.
 Or they may have been hand picked before graduation for a special
 assignment.  For those not so chosen normal placement procedure
 begins with the posting on its bulletin board of a roster of positions
 which the institution is responsible for filling.  Each student is per-
 mitted t) indicate three choices.  The institution in theory considers
 the student's choice.  In practice, however, the institution is guided
 primarily by other considerations, such as the state's needs, the
 student's class background and his scholastic rating.
 Although acceptance of state assignments is virtually mandatory,
 there is little need for compulsion.  By the time a student graduates
 from an institute of higher education in Communist China, he has
 undergone a long process of mental preparation to put duty above
 personal considerations.  He will probably be either ambitious or
 sincere enough to make personal sacrifices in the interest of furthering
 his career.  Even if he lacks such motivations, a student has no
 ready alternative.  The following account of a student's attempt to
 refuse an assignment was written by an intellectual-who fled China:
 There was an actual case of a medical student who after
 graduation did not go to the frontier area assigned to him but
 went home instead to help his father keep shop.  He was
 free to go home, of course: "no one could force him to do any-
 thing in a socialist country" * * *.  He enjoyed several
 weeks of leisure with his family which he could financially
 well afford, but one day two classmates came to see him and,
 after tea and remarks on the weather, they explained that
 they thought he should "follow the leadership" and go to his
 assigned work.  "In socialist societies," they told him, "no
 one should call his skill his own, because without the society
 a man could not be what he was.  The Government spent so
 much money on the school we studied in.  Therefore, * * *"
 The next day two other classmates came to persuade him:
 "In socialist societies no one can call his skill his own * * *";
 the third day three others came: "In socialist countries no
 one can call his skill his own * * *"; the fourth day one of
 the two who came the first day came: "The government
 spent so much on the school we studied in * * *."  In any
 society there are some people with exceptional tempera-
 ments, and the Communists take care of them.  This medi-
 cal student persisted in shaking his head; and his classmates
 persisted in coming.  Every afternoon he was subjected to a

 28 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 lecture which went; on for hours: "In socialist societies no
 one can call his skill his own * * * "  At the end of two
 months he came to think that this was worse than any
 frontier region could be, and promised to report to the Com-
 mittee of Party Members in the school.
 Refusal to accept a job assigned by the state amounts to profes-
 sional suicide, particularly for a young student just starting out,  It
 results in automatic isolation from an employment system which
 controls all significant job opportunities in the entire country,
 .Although an individual may eventually find some kind of employ-
 ment, he has in effect placed himself under  overnniental "su pcr-
 vision", which itself can be a serious matter.  is original refusal to
 accept a. state assignment has become P. permanent pert of his per-
 sonnel record,  Even if he relents, as the reluctant medical student
 did, his future assignments, salary, and promotional opportunities
 have been irreparably blighted.
 Offices directly involved in national security have the highest
 priority in personnel recruitment.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
 for example, usually has first call on students in the social sciences, in
 foreign languages and in area studies.  It takes the largest part of
 the graduating class from the country's basic foreign service training
 school.  Those selected by the ministry from other institutions are
 generally out of the top half of their classes.  An assignment to the
 ministry "must be complied with" and is accompanied by a thorough
 security check.  Almost all professional employees are believed to be
 members of the party or the Youth League.  The Ministry also
 enjoys it high priority fn filling its personnel needs from other agencies.
 The nation's scientific effort also gets priority attention in the
 assignment of better students.  This effort is planned and overseen
 by the 30-35 divisions, includin  divisions for atonic energy and
 national defense, of the Scientific and Technological Commission.
 Most of the actual scientific work is, however, handled by the Academy
 of Sciences, in specialized academies run by individual ministries and
 in industry or at the universities. The importance of the Academy
 of Sciences in this effort is indicated by the fact that it, principal part
 of the nation's research and development in such vital fields as
 nuclear phyysics and missiles is carried out at various institutes of the
 academy.  The academy ensures a supply of qualified personnel by
 running its own training programs in its own schools.  'T'he academy
 doubtless gets the pick of the students trained.
 Transfer and promotion
 Once assigned to a critical job or agency, an individual has almost
 no horizontal mobility-at least not on his own initiative. The system
 which forces him into a niche, keeps him there. Transfer, like assign-
 ments, are arranged largely on the basis of the state's need and to
 refuse a transfer initiated by the state is likely to be detrimental to
 one's career.
 Good performance or personal contacts can bring an individual to
 the attention of another agency with a clearly higher priority, and
 transfers can usually be arranged at the instigation of such an organiza-
 tion. Poor performance can result in a transfer either to less critical
 agencies or to less important responsibilities within the same agency.
 There are also lateral transfers from agencies responfible for de-
 veloping particular skills.  This kind of transfer occurs frequently,
 Approved For Release 2004/05/12 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200010038-0
 Appr.9yfrMAg0NJ,;BL9  FPgSP%?F}q02910038-0
 in the national security field, from military to civilian agencies.
 Special police and security offices, for example, in the governmental
 structure are usually staffed by military veterans with special training
 in this kind of work.  Organizations needing personnel trained in
 secure communications procedures recruit almost exclusively from
 the military.  Other specialized agencies, such as the Bureau of
 National Statistics and the Ministry of Public Security, train special-
 ists on a continuing basis and make them available to other govern-
 ment agencies as normal placement procedure.
 Although it is not impossible to arrange one's own transfer in
 Communist China, such transfers are not common. The government
 does entertain requests from individuals for reassignment, though
 probably not from the national security field.  The best reason for
 such a request, from the government's point of view, is that the
 individual's specialty is not being used.  Misplacement does occur.
 For example, at one time a reported 10 percent of the "advanced
 intellectuals" in the employ of one ministry were holding down jobs
 which did not utilize their specialized training.
 Promotional prospects in the governmental service depend on much
 the same criteria as in the party.  The first concern of the authorities
 is in most cases likely to be political reliability.  Like his colleagues
 in the party, the non-party professional has to attend regular study
 meetings.  Though these are generally neither as frequent nor as
 intensive as for the party man, the nonparty professional finds he
 must also express his opinions on the issues under discussion.  This,
 of course, gives big brother in the party a chance to measure his po-
 litical attitude.                              If it is judged inadequate, his other qualifications
 will have to be outstanding before he will have a chance to be recom-
 mended for promotion.
 Still, professional excellence probably does count for more here than
 it does in the case of the purely party man.  A man could conceivably
 advance quite high in an economic or scientific institution on profes-
 sional merit.  But he would find, ultimately, that he was closed off
 from the top posts unless or until lie was accepted into the party.
 Veterans' preference
 Veterans from the armed forces are employed in large numbers
 at all levels of responsibility in the Chinese government.  Military
 retirement laws dating from the mid-1950's provide that all demo-
 bilized military personnel must, if they are physically fit and under
 55 years of age, take job assignments arranged for them.       These
 assignments, like those of civilian professionals, are virtually com-
 pulsory.  High-ranking officers or personnel with special qualifications
 are usually assigned jobs before they leave the army.  If an indi-
 vidual has no particular skills of use to the government or the party
 he is sent home. The personnel department of the government
 in his local area is responsible for providing him with a job.  Some
 sort of employment is arranged, from a comfortable spot in an aca-
 demic institution to difficult manual labor in factories or on farms.
 Ex-soldiers also receive special salary considerations.  Their mili-
 tary rank is converted to a roughly equal civilian grade.                               The actual
 salary paid a veteran is determined by a combination of this grade
 and his length of military service.  A veteran can thus draw a higher
 salary than a nonveteran in the same job.  One other factor con-
 tributes to veterans' preference in Communist China.                                        The armed

 forces political indoctrination program is one of the regime's most
 effective.  It tends to make veterans, many of whom are party mem-
 bers, especially reliable.  Veterans are therefore likely to be con-
 sidered for responsible positions ahead of nonveterans.
 In-service training
 Many of the ministries and commissions of the Chinese govern-
 ment run inservice training courses for their personnel, usually at
 specialized institutions in which they have an interest.  One such
 institution is the Chinese Institute for International Relations in
 Peiping.  Financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Min-
 istry of Education, it is under the operational control of the party.
 It provides training in international affairs, foreign languages, and
 area studies.  Selection for study at the institute is considered a mark
 of distinction and the herald of higher positions to conic.
 Most of the Institute's 600 students arc drawn frors party cadres
 of the low and middle levels, foreign service officers who have already
 had a tour abroad, or employees of the ministry, and employees of
 other government and military offices  all of whom receive their salary
 while attending the school.  It does accept some highly qualified
 middle school graduates.  Entrance requirements read like the re-
 quirements for party membership---political reliability, a family back-
 ground untainted by wealth or political ties with the, Kuomintang,
 and no foreign connections.
 The curriculum of the Institute is organized around a two- to
 three-year program for foreign ministry officers who have already
 served abroadt and a four- to five-year program for training language
 and area specialists.  It is based on the study program of the insti-
 tute's Soviet counterpart.  Studies include basic actdemic courses
 (geography, history, law), political theory courses (Marxism-Leninism,
 I a history of the Chinese revolutions, dialectical materialism), foreign
 affairs (history of international politics and economic relations,
 international public and private law, the history of Chinese diplo-
 macy), and foreign languages (English, French, Russian, German,
 Spanish, and Arabic).  The major emphasis of the institute is on
 political theory.  The major language effort is on English.
 Government incentives
 The promotional possibilities for professionals in Communist China
 range from an entering grade 21 for a college graduate to an effective
 ceiling at about grade 11.  A handful of top executives hold the
 Len super grades.  The wage differential between grade 11 and grade
 21 in Communist China is about the same as exists in the U.S. civil
 service system between the professional entering grade, GS--5, and
 the top regular grade, GS-15.  Wage levels for professionals in the
 government have been generally stable and promotions slow.  The
 government wage structure was last overhauled in 1956.

 A government professional gets certain perquisites which determine
 his actual standard of living.  Emoluments in housing, food, and
 clothing allowances are allowed high-level officials.  Lesser officials
 in certain kinds of work such as personnel whose jobs bring them
 into frequent contact with foreigners receive better livii g allowances
 than the average employee of the. same grade.  Welfare benefits in
 the form of medical services and schools for dependents also are
 linked to professional status and grade.
 Housing is at a premium in China.  The higher one's grade the
 better the chance of being able to live with one's family, to obtain
 attractive accommodations, privacy, and enough e4uipnicnt for
 relative comfort.  For the many government cinployecs whose jobs
 do not permit tlieni to live with their families, the regin.e has a leave
 system which allows an individual to spend two to Circe weeks a
 year, or four to five weeks every two years with his family.
 On top of this, persons emptoyed by organizations responsible for
 national security reportedly receive special attention in the alloca-
 tion of daily necessities.  The armed forces receive excellent treat-
 ment in comparison with the population at large, and .lie relatively
 high stand and of living of employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 compared to other government functionaries has been noted by visitors
 to Peiping.
 The Chinese Communist regime employs to advantagc certain non-
 material incentives.   It offers, for example, idealistic young people a
 chance to participate in the vital and challenging job of modernizing
 China.  This factor is known to have played a large purr, in the return
 of hundreds of educated Chinese from the U.S. and Europe in the
 early 1950's.  It is a factor heavily emphasized in university-level
 indoctrination programs.
 A second non-material incentive is access to literaturec, that has not
 been pre-masticated by the regime's propaganda npparrtus.
 The government's awards system seems designed more to promote
 loyalty to the regime than improvements in efficiency and performance.
 This system now in use provides for the granting of commendations,
 prizes, cash, grade raises and promotions on the following grounds:
 1) loyalty to the job- 2) superior or model performance of duties;
 3) observance of discipline; 4) suggestions, innovations, and inventions
 which contribute to the national welfare; 5) actions protecting govern-
 mont property or preventing loss to the government; Esnd 6) fighting
 illega-1      y.  Four out of the six tire reflections of political reli-
 ability rather than outstanding professional achievements.
 There are also regulations on the. books which are specifically de-
 signed to reward outstanding professional achievcment.  Under
 these, original contributions in both natural and social science are
 afforded national recognition and cash awards.  The only publicized
 use of these awards occurred nearly six years ago.
 Of course, there is the other side of the incentive coin.  The gov-
 ernment civil servant can fall afoul of the government's supervisory
 apparatus quite as easily as a party man can be enmeshed in his,
 and for equally capricious reasons.  There is no legal code in Com-
 munist China.  There is it system of courts in China, but the courts
 are not independent; they are only another arm of the executive.
 There is also a system of public prosecutors, whose chief task it is to
 check on government offices and employees to see that state regula-

 tions are observed by all administrative agencies, officials and the
 public at large.
 The major responsibility for maintaining public order and policing
 the governmental apparatus, however, rests in the Ministry of In-
 terior and the Ministry of Public Security.  Interior is believed to
 take care of administrative cases involving government agencies and
 officials, to investigate how government decisions are being imple-
 mented, and to detect neglect of duty or violations of regulations.
 The Ministry of Public Security performs the general police function
 vis-a-vis the public.  It has the largest and best trained investigative
 force, which is apparently used from time to time by other supervisory
 organs of party and government.  These organs, primed to act at the
 whim of the central authorities, provide an important, if negative,
 slice of any government employee's incentive.
 IV. THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
 The present leaders of the Chinese Communist Party clearly recog-
 nize that the country's armed forces, the largest single component of
 national security personnel in China, constitute the keystone of their
 past and future power.  They take elaborate measures to assure the
 tightest possible party control over the military.  They regard the
 proper staffing of the military establishment as a vitally important
 vehicle of this control. As Mao has remarked, "the principle is for
 the party to direct the gun and not for the gun to direct the party."
 The final say in party policy toward the armed forces rests with
 Mao and his colleagues on the Standing Committee.   The formulation
 of general military policy for the party is, however, entrusted to the
 Military Affairs Committee, one of the most potent of the party's
 central organs.  Key members of the committee hold the top posts in
 the Ministry of National Defense, which stands at the apex of the
 purely military chain of command.  Trusted party men hold all top
 military posts.
 The party has provided itself with two further checkreins over the
 armed forces at all levels.  The first is the extension of party com-
 mittees, similar to those in civilian organs, to the military.  The
 second is the system of political officers under the General Political
 Department in the armed forces.  Every military unit, at least as
 far down as the company level, has both a party committee and a
 political officer.  This provides the party with both horizontal con-
 trol, from civilian to military party committees on the same level, and
 vertical control, through the General Political Department's political
 officer system.
 The military affairs committee
 On this body Mao Tse-tung has gathered his most trusted old line
 military leaders and political officers still active in the armed forces.
 It is likely that the marshals who helped Mao to his successes in the
 revolution are all on the committee.  The names are a roster of old
 revolutionary heroes : Lin Piao, Liu Po-cheng, Lo Jung-huan, Ho
 Lung, Nieh Jung-then, Hsu Hsiang-chien, Yeh Chien-ying.  Mao
 probably sits in on the more important committee sessions; Lin Piao
 is probably the effective operating chieftain.
 Over the years this group of men scored many victories by following
 the accepted Maoist precepts of party primacy.  They still tend to

 look first and foremost to ideological purity and political dependability
 in determining individual qualifications for military posts, and can
 be expected to try to keep a firm lid on creeping professionalism in the
 armed forces.
 In at least one instance, however, the question of in individual's
 ppolitical reliability crept right into the ranks of the committee.
 Between 1057 and 1959 Peng Teh-huni, Minister of National Defense
 and a leading figure on the committee, spearheaded a group which
 attempted to "regularize" the armed forces, i.e,, to emphasize profes-
 sionalism in the officer corps in part at the expense o' political sub-
 servience.  The party, considering this it "purely military point of
 view," sacked Peng and. his supporters.  Pang's repor:ed attempt to
 elicit Soviet support contributed to his downfall.
 Remnants of Pang's ideas continue to annoy the more orthodox
 leaders.  Sonic officers have apparently continued to argue that the
 "suddenness and complexity" of modern warfare render the party
 committee system in the armed forces dangerously cumbersome and
 inefficient.  Mao's sup orters respond that officers holding such
 views "estrange themselves from politics * * * and re-ard the army
 as a thing above class and above politics." Even in thie present era
 of military dependence on technology, Xlao and his supporters say
 it is possiMsle for all military plans to be fulfilled by depending on the
 traditional Communist officer's "courage, self-confidence, fighting
 ability, esprit. de corps."  They conclude that today's officer must
 still be a "militant. revolutionary" who subordinates himself to the
 party and relies for inspiration and practical guidance cn the military
 doctrines expounded in Mao's works.
 In an effort. to strengthen the approved characteristics in the officer
 corps, Peiping holds up as exemplars the present members of the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee.  Peiping has specifically excluded them
 along with all senior generals from mandatory retirement regula-
 tions.  Officers at all levels are encouraged to study the memoirs of
 these leaders, and are given to understand that they should model
 themselves and pattern their careers on the example of these old
 heroes.
 As attrition begins to remove these aging committeemen from the
 scene, their replacements will doubtless be judged first on political
 allegiance to the present party leaders, and secondly on military
 qualifications.
 Some observers have noted that apparently able Chinese Commu-
 nist military officers fail to advance in grade and position   rapidly
 as would normally be expected.  There can be no doubt, thatasarapifailure
 to impress the party leaders who make the promotions with a. proper
 revolutionary spirit has in many cases been responsible. Testifying
 to the importance of party-oriented thinking in advancement to the
 top military echelons is the fact than more than half of the present
 members of the Military Affairs Committee were once political
 officers in the armed forces.  One of them, Lin Piao, who is also the
 current Minister of National Defense, possesses a brlliant combat
 record but is also extensively experienced in political work in the
 army; another, Lo Jui-thing, who is also the present. Chief of Staff, is
 a man who made his reputation in security work.

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA 35
 The general political department
 The other major organization through which the party exercises
 control and surveillance is the General Political Department of the
 armed forces.  While organizationally under the Ministry of Defense,
 the General Political Department in practice enjoys a rather special
 position.  As the senior party agency within the armed forces, it has
 its own separate channels of command and administration.  It is the
 only organization on its level to which the party constitution devotes
 a separate article.  This article states that the General Political De-
 partment will, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee,
 "take charge of the ideological and organizational work of the party
 in the army."  In fulfilling this role, the General Political Department
 is responsible for all propaganda, education, and cultural activities
 within the armed forces.  It also has a controlling say in personnel
 matters.
 The political officers which it assigns to each unit of the armed
 forces are responsible only to the political department, not to any
 military commander.  Except in the most extreme combat emergency,
 the political officer must approve an operational order before it can be
 implemented.
 One of the major ways in which the department effects the party's
 will is through its powers in controlling promotions, transfers, leave,
 and efficiency reports.  It also is in charge of the indoctrination of
 military personnel, a more thoroughgoing program than is inflicted
 on other government workers.
 The man last noted as head of the department, Tan Chong, has been
 out of favor for several years. Though not formally removed, he is
 doubtless no longer trusted to administer the department's delicate
 and vital functions. It is more likely that one of the senior figures of
 the Military Affairs Committee does this. Either Lo Jung-huan, who
 has had many years of loyal service as top political man in the military,
 or Hsiao Hua, who is nominally the deputy director of the depart-
 ment, probably now exercises real departmental authority.
 The Ministry of National Defense
 Operating the defense establishment under the direction of these
 party bodies are the Ministry of National Defense and the central
 departments-the General Staff Department, the General Rear
 Services Department, the General Training Department and the
 General Cadres (personnel) Department. The top jobs in all of these
 organs are controlled by Mao and the party center, and the incumbents
 are trusted party men.
 Professional military qualifications, however, begin to play a
 slightly more important role at the second level in the ministry.
 There is, for example, a rough balance between men with preponderant
 military experience and men with preponderant political backgrounds
 among the vice ministers of national defense and the deputy chiefs of
 staff.  It is at this level that the special representatives of the air
 force and the navy begin to be heard.
 No premium is put on formal academic education in the ministry;
 indeed, the average is quite low. The rise of better schooled officers,
 now at more junior. levels, will inevitably alter the situation in the
 future.

 Below the deputy level in the central departments of the ministry,
 changes in personnel and infusion of new blood since 1950 have been
 sufficient to give a clearer picture of overall Chinese Communist
 military-- staffing policies.  Most of the officers now holding posts at
 this level are longtime specialists in their fields-armor, artillery,
 training, logistics, etc. Still top party leaders, possibly acting on the
 recommendations of party branch cominittces in the Peiping head-
 quarters, almost certainly pass judgment on appointments at this
 level.  Regulations provide for the command of military regions,
 districts, and armies by officers of lieutenant general ,grade or above.
 Divisions are commanded by major generals.  They are appointed
 by the State Council with the approval of the top party leadership
 which naturally wishes to assure that the selections work against the
 development of "independent kingdoms" reminiscent of the pre-
 communist warlord period.
 Regiments and battalions are commanded by colonels, and com-
 panics by captains.  The appointment and transfer of all field grade
 officers is officially the duty of the ministry.  Its selections are prob-
 ably reviewed,  rior to being formalized, by the general political
 department and/or the unit party conuuittees.  Stafi g at the com-
 pany level is the responsibility of the regional military commander, or
 the chief of the appropriate branch of the service, and is probably
 checked through the party apparatus.
 Peiping keeps a full book on the training, experience, and qualifica-
 tions of officers which is used along with political criteria as the basis
 for promotion at field and company level.  The regime has said little
 about personal qualities desirable in an officer.  It is clear, however,
 that emphasis is put on mien of action who have an ability to act
 independently in a military situation and carry through actions once
 started.  Emphasis on these factors may be motivated in part by the
 probability that insistence on political acceptability among officers
 has caused many of them to adopt a play-it-safe attitlde which in
 some cases tends to sap needed military initiative.
 Seniority is a factor of great importance in field and com )any
 grade promotions.  Advancement to the rank of senior colonel
 requires a certain period of service in the nest, lower grade.  A lesser
 period is required for advancement to lower ranks.  Trne-in-service
 stipulations are not immutable, however, and may bu waived for
 especially meritorious officers.
 Orerstaf ng
 To -heavy staffs are a burden to both Chinese Communist field
 and headquarters military units.  The problem was made acute in
 1955-1956 when the regime introduced sonic Soviet staffing practices
 alongside the existing Chinese structure.  Although wholesale cut-
 backs were made in 1957 and in 1960, the process amounted basically
 to a reshuffling and reassignment of personnel and probably only a
 token number of officers were actually retired or placed in reserve
 status.  The Peiping regime retains a high number of general officers
 in proportion to total strength.  The present ratio--some 2,000
 generals to a total strength of 2,600,000--is considerably higher than
 the current. average in the better Western armies.

 STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA 37
 Training
 In the old days when the Chinese Communist army was still largely
 a guerrilla force, military training was left almost entirely to the
 whims of the individual commander.  As a result it was piecemeal
 and haphazard.  By contrast, regular political indoctrination schools
 have been a feature of the military scone since earliest days.  In 1950,
 Peiping set about to establish a centralized military training system
 modeled for the most part on Soviet counterparts.  It also expanded
 political schooling.  Judged by Western standards, the program is
 still sketchy, elementary, and heavily political.
 The closest equivalent to a Western command and staff college is
 the Nanking Military Institute.  Here facilities for officer training
 operated by the Chinese Nationalists have been taken over and ex-
 panded.  Promising upper rank field officers whom the regime con-
 siders good prospects for advancement to general officer status
 apparently form the main bulk of the student body.  Both political
 courses and military science subjects are taught. Courses run from
 eighteen months to four years.
 Several establishments in Peiping, the People's Liberation Army
 Political Academy and the Academy of Military Sciences, appear to
 constitute a very rough approximation of our own war college system..
 The former is perhaps the top institution for political instruction con-
 nected with the armed forces.  Some formal academic training is
 included in the curriculum, and regular classes are graduated.  Both
 senior political and military officers, including some general officers,
 receive advanced training at the Institute.
 The Academy of Military Sciences was set up in 1958 and charged
 with bringing the latest scientific and technical developments into the
 study of military science in the Chinese armed forces.  Its founding
 was an obvious effort by the regime to try to prepare the Chinese
 Communist armed forces to cope with the demands of modern
 technological warfare, even if they were not yet equipped to fight such
 a war.  It probably supervises research into advanced weaponry and
 doctrine on its use, and lectures senior military officers on these
 topics.
 Another organization apparently involved in this field is the
 Military Engineering Academy which reportedly teaches a curriculum
 heavily weighted with advanced technical subjects.
 Each of the main branches of the army, such as the artillery and the
 armored forces, has a separate system of schools.  The air force and
 the navy also have training setups which include academies for the
 schooling of young officers similar to U.S. academies.  Qualifications
 for acceptance at such schools are determined in part by competitive
 examinations.
 Throughout the armed forces school system, both political and mili-
 tary courses are offered.  Political training is in the hands of the politi-
 cal officers at the training establishments and takes up almost half of
 a student's study time.
 Insofar as regular in-service training is concerned, it was decreed in
 1961 that the total amount of study time for officers was not to be
 over 500 hours per year for officers above division level, and 300 to 400
 hours per year for officers below this level.  Sixty percent of this time
 was to be spent on professional military subjects.  The balance was
 to be spent on political studies and on formal academic training.

 i~    STAFFING PROCEDURES AND PROBLEMS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Specialized technical units were permitted to spend up to 70 percent
 of their time on professional subjects.
 From time to time, the regime has inaugurated "back to the ranks"
 movements, the military counterpart of the civilian "down-to-the-
 farm" drives.  In these movements officers of all grades are required
 to serve short tours of from two weeks to a month as enlisted men in
 order to familiarize themselves with the problems and conditions at
 basic levels.  Although the emphasis on this program varies from time
 to time, such tours are frequent enough to be considered a standard
 and time-consuming Chinese Communist technique.
 To provide new material for its ground force officer corps the
 regime operates a number of basic officer training schools.  Non-
 commissioned officers selected by competitive exarninc.tion receive up
 to three years training at these institutions before obtainingg their com-
 missions.  In lieu of attending basic officer institutes, highly qualified
 non-corns may sometimes obtain commissions by pf,ssing a special
 examination.
 Peiping has begun to look increasingly during the past few years to
 graduates of civilian college-level institutions as a source for officer
 material. As early as 1955 a law provided for the establishment of a
 system similar to the U.S. hOTC program to train re3erve officers in
 the universities.  After graduation, persons who had been trained
 under the system would, if needed, be directly commissioned and
 placed on active duty.  In this manner, and in the operation of the
 normal graduate placement process, the armed force:; draw perhaps
 3 to 5 percent of an annual graduating class.
 Low academic standards in the Chinese Communist officer corps
 have been somewhat alleviated recently as a result of tougher regime
 standards on schooling prior to induction.  Today di-3 typical officer
 up to the rank of captain probably has the equivalent of ahigh school
 education.  In a bid to raise overall armed force academic standards,
 Peiping announced a ten-year plan in 1959 to bring all officers up to
 college level.  Like other grandiose schemes introduced in the leap
 forward period, little has been heard of the program subsequently.
 It may have been discarded in the general training cutbacks announced
 in 1960 by Defense Minister Lin Piao.
 Enlisted men are schooled as non-corns through a pattern of special
 battalions scattered through selected divisions.  Promising enlisted
 men are sent to these battalions for courses lasting .eve
 They return qualified as squad leaders or for higher noncommissioned
 ranks.  Candidates must have demonstrated their political accept-
 ability as well as military aptitude before enrollment.
 Since 1960 the Chinese Communists have started to shy away
 from their near exclusive dependence on Soviet military training
 manuals, a development doubtless spurred by the widening political
 breach between Peiping and Moscow.  The regime clearly continues
 to recognize the value of foreign military techniques, however.
 For example, some U.S. doctrine has been disguised as Chinese and
 written into Communist training manuals.

 V. MANPOWER AND EDUCATION
 One-quarter of the world's population lives in Communist China.
 The rate of growth of this immense population showed a tendency to
 rise during the early period of Chinese Communist rule, reaching a
 peak of 2.5 percent per year in 1958.  It probably fell thereafter to
 1..5 to 2.0 percent as food shortages contributed to a rise in the death
 rate.

 The Chinese Communists made hesitant and ineffective efforts in
 1956-1957 to encourage birth control.  Thereafter the effort slowed,
 and at present publicity on "family planning" is moderate and limited
 in scope.  It is directed almost solely towards the urban population.
 The rural population makes up over 80 percent of the total in China,
 and rural births must be severely curtailed if a Chinese birth control
 campaign is ever to be effective.  Even if the regime were ener-
 getically to prosecute a program for limiting births, a minimum period
 of at least five years would probably be required before the program
 would begin to reduce the national birth rate.
 The labor force
 The total labor force in Communist China grew from  some 274
 million persons in 1953 to about 316 million persons in 1962.  Civilian
 employment increased from an estimated 271 million persons to about
 313 million persons.
 More than 85 percent of the civilian force was employed in agri-
 culture.  Nonagricultural employment at the end of 1962 is estimated
 to have been roughly 4 million persons higher than at the end of 1953.
 This does not, however, reflect the significant changes which oc-
 curred in nonagricultural employment under the Communists.  Prior
 to 1957 the creation of new job opportunities in the nonagricultural
 sectors of the economy lagged behind the growth of the population.
 In 1958, the "leap forward" brought an enormous expansion in non-
 agricultural employment.  The figure went up by more than 15 mil-
 lion persons during a single year, bringing the total to 55 million.
 In the ensuing economic debacle, nonagricultural employment declined
 by 1962 to roughly 43 million persons.

 Although Communist China has an abundant sdpply of Unskilled
 labor, it has always been faced with very serious shortages of technical
 and skilled labor, shortages that were partially eased by Soviet tech-
 nicians until they were abruptly withdrawn in mid-1900.                                                               The
 Chinese Communists have attempted to expand the number and
 quality of technicians and skilled workers at all levels.  The increase
 in the number of trained people and the accumule.tion of on-the-job
 experience during the, past decade alleviated some. but certainly not
 all, of these shortages.
 The educational system
 Great stress has been laid on various types of education by the Chi-
 nese Communists.  Schools were built in all parts of the country.
 Large educational complexes made up of a number of technical col-
 le es were established.  Such universities as Peiping, Tsingliua and
 Chiaotung, well-known before the Communist takeover, Were ex-
 panded.  In the leap forward period of 1958-1ta00 the number of
 institutions for which college status was claimed rose so sharply that
 educational standards suffered badly. The term "college" was bastard-
 ized to the point where several years later it remains difficult to estab-
 lish how many institutions of higher learning are operating in China.
 Institutions Inaintainin standards in any way comparable to higher
 educational levels elsewhere may not be much above the figure of 236
 existing at the beginning of the leap forward.

 Total enrollment in institutions of higher education rose from
 155,000 in 1947-1948 to around 900,000 in 1960-1961.                 Enrollment
 fell thereafter and by the fall of 1962 probably was less than 800,000.
 There are four general types of universities and colleges operating
 in China-comprehensive, polytechnical, specialized technical, and
 teachers colleges.  Comprehensive universities in China are compar-
 able to a faculty of arts and sciences at an American university.
 They train scientists and college teachers in basic disciplines such as
 physics, astronomy, biology, the humanities, etc.  Peiping, Futan,
 and Nankai Universities fall into this category.  Polytechnical uni-
 versities are made up of several departments, the number of fields
 covered varying in different schools.  Basic engineering principles
 are emphasized.  Examples are Tsinghua, Chiaotung, and Harbin
 Industrial Universities.  The specialized colleges train personnel for
 specific assignments in the iron and steel or the aeronautical industry,
 in surveying, in trade and finance, etc.  The teachers colleges are
 intended primarily to provide teachers for middle schools.  Teachers
 for higher educational institutions are trained by the universities and
 colleges themselves.
 The number of graduates from these institutions from 1949 through
 1962 is estimated to be 950,000 distributed as follows:

 commonly received from accredited colleges in the United States.  A
 shortage of competent teachers was the major limitation.  Also con-
 tributing was the regime's idea that students should participate in
 labor and receive a liberal amount of political education.  In addition,
 almost all were allowed to graduate irrespective of academic achieve-
 ment, many after only two or three years of course work.
 The choice of quantity over quality was consciously made.  It was
 probably useful in serving China's short-term needs.    Narrow training
 in specialized fields did turn out graduates fit to meet immediate needs
 in industrial, mining, construction, and other activities.  The par-
 ticular specialties of' these narrowly trained men were not, however,
 always responsive to the demands of (lie moment.
 An attempt to meet the need for higher quality in education, recog-
 nized as necessary for the long pull, was made in the better universities
 and polytechnical institutes.  Curricula, length of courses, and avail-
 ability of competent professors suggest that some graduates of these
 schools were relatively well trained.  Even in these schools there was
 some sacrifice of quality.  Most students were required to take part
 in physical work and time-consuming political indoctrination meetings.
 Teachers were overloaded.   Effectiveness of the bettor professors was
 further reduced by burdensome responsibilities for planning and organ-
 izing, turning their talents to practical problems in industry and other
 activities, parrying disruptive directions of party authorities, and
 trying to carry out their work in it general atmosphere of frantic
 urgency to meet ill-defined and changing goals.
 Graduate work
 Chinese universities have failed to produce the needed numbers of
 qqualified people prepared to go forward into graduate work.  The
 Academy of Sciences in 1955 and 1956 tried to recruit candidates for
 a four-year program of graduate training. The selection was to have
 commenced in August 1955 but only 65 qualified students had been
 selected by March 1956. In the fall of 1956 the academy found only
 268 out of 1,470 applicants qualified for its program.  Part of the
 problem was that many universities were retaining students for their
 own graduate programs started at about the same time. The situa-
 tion was so bad tlia.t in 1958 the academy set up its own University of
 Science and Technology to prepare students for }titer work at the
 graduate level.
 The graduate programs that got under way six years ago have not
 flourished. Apparently no new graduate students w,3re taken into the
 program after 1956 until the fall of 1962 when the academy enrolled
 213 and the universities about 1,600.  None was reported to have
 completed his work until the fall of 1962, six years after the program
 started. The academy reported in February 1963 that 99 had com-
 pleted their work and that over 400 were in training. Current graduate
 enrollment in the universities  a    in the order of 2,000. The num-
 ber is not adequate for China's needs.
 Limitations on enrollments in [lie graduate program appear to rest
 in large part on the shortage of scholars capable of and available for
 service as tutors.  In 1956 only some 200 persons in the academy
 were named tutors; only about 130 were named in. the universities.

 Use of Soviet schools
 Education of Chinese students in Soviet bloc countries has con-
 tributed to the supply of new scientific and technical personnel in
 China.  Chinese have been trained both in Soviet universities and
 colleges and in research institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
 and other academies.  Practically all Chinese students sent to the
 Soviet Union after 1956 were graduate students.  Previously large
 numbers of undergraduates had been sent with numbers reaching
 nearly 2,000 per year in 1955 and 1956.  After 1960 few new students
 of any level were sent, but a majority of those already enrolled con-
 tinued their studies.                              The total number sent in all years is about
 7,500 of which about 2,500 were probably graduate students.  About
 1,100 have completed work for the Soviet kandidat degree.     Less
 than 1,000, probably considerably less, are currently in training at
 advanced levels in the Soviet Union.
 Chinese students in the Soviet Union pursued their studies in many
 fields of basic and applied science and engineering, judging by the
 titles of dissertations they have published in Soviet journals. Em-
 phasis was clearly on bread-and-butter subjects applicable to China's
 immediate needs.  Subjects supporting agriculture and public health
 were the most numerous.  Other fields were water conservancy,
 transportation, electric power, mineral exploitation, chemical and
 metallurgical industries, and machine building processes.  The dis-
 sertations revealed no effort, to concentrate on complex new technology
 associated with such fields as nuclear power, computers, modern
 aircraft, or missiles.
 Chinese have taken part, however, in. the activities at the Joint
 Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna, outside Moscow.  This
 institution trains personnel from all Soviet bloc countries in nuclear
 physics, but not in nuclear weapons technology.  The work at Dubna
 is apparently not in the nature of formal study leading to dissertation
 and degree.
 Chinese students returning from graduate study in the Soviet
 Union probably make up a large majority of the better trained new
 researchers in China.  Although reasonably well trained in a formal
 sense, they are inexperienced.  The best probably are assigned to
 research institutes of the Academy of Sciences and other academies
 or to the universities.
 Scientific manpower
 The leaders of Communist China appreciate the importance of the
 contribution made by science and technology to national strength.
 They want effectively planned and directed research in well-equipped
 and staffed laboratories.  Chinese capabilities in this direction have
 been greatly strengthened over the past decade.  Progress, however,
 has been less than might have been expected from their resources
 and furious activity.  Several factors helped stunt the full flowering
 of Chinese science.
 First of all, many well-trained scientists in China were educated in
 the western non-Communist world.  The regime regards their political
 reliability as doubtful.  The leaders cannot risk placing such men in
 policymaking roles.  They are even hesitant about placing such men
 in positions of lower level authority without the constant and over-
 riding presence of a politically proven party stalwart.

 Secondly, the Chinese Communists' passion for quick success led
 them to use special methods which frequently were not as productive
 as more traditional means. Research work projects were started,
 then stopped, under misconceived plans.  Available research tech-
 nicians were misused.  Large numbers of poorly trained researchers
 were thrown into projects as though quantity would substitute for
 quality.  The initiatives of experienced researchers were frustrated
 all too often by party cadres attempting to manage researchers as
 though they were machines with on-and-off buttons.
 Thirdly, planning for the training of technical personnel has failed
 in many cases to balance supply and need.  The attempt to fix the
 numbers needed in a narrow technical specialty tlirc to five years
 ahead has seemed beyond Chinese capabilities.  By the time students
 complete their three- to five-year programs of higher education, needs
 in many cases have changed.  For example, the re;ime trained so
 many Russian interpreters and translators that they were in excess
 lon" before relations with the Soviets began to cool.
 The major staffing problem in China's scientific organizations is
 of course, to find enough competent scientists and t3achers.  At the
 present time, they have in general ,i few qualified men backed by a
 large body of poorly trained and inexperienced personnel. They lack
 the large group of medium quality, experienced researchers of the
 kind that make up the main body of the scientific community in a
 technologically advanced society.
 China has a few well-trained and competent scientists in nearly
 every area of technology. Therefore, useful proggrress can be made in
 almost any scientific or engineering project of sufficiently hi f priority.
 However,' there are not enough first-rate people around to make
 progress in more than a limited number of advanced projects at any
 one time. The rate of progress on a priority project can be stepped
 up only by a process of bleeding other projects.
 The training of scientists and technologists appears lately to have
 been put on a more ppromising track, but the principal resource for
 advanccnient, the well-trained and ex jeriencecl tutor. remains in short
 supply. There is no crash program that can solve the problem.
 VI. Tun COMMUNICATION OF IDEAS
 The dissemination of news and opinion in Communist China is
 managed virtually in its entirety. The voice of dissent is infrequently
 raised. The leaders in Peiping see their problem in this area largely
 one of mobilizing the party, the government and the population behind
 their programs.  Principal communications media are used almost
 exclusively to instruct and goad.
 The party rank and file and the people are told only what the
 leaders feel is necessary for the purpose of carrying out instructions.
 Rarely does a hint creep out of policy disagreements within the
 privileged circle. The party does not regard the spread of dissenting
 views expressed within this circle as at all helpful, and they are
 rigorously suppressed.
 classified channels
 The principal means used by the leaders to propagate the party line
 are classified communications, the. open press and radio, and study
 meetings.  Classified publications and documents flow out of the

 AggKgy p F W ,R@                            0010038-0
 party center by secure telecommunications, by post, and by hand or
 word of mouth.  Leading party figures travel a good deal bringing
 the latest word from Peipingg.  Lesser leaders from the outlying areas
 are brought to Peiping for the same purpose.
 The Chinese Communists are intensely suspicious and their security
 practices are stringent. In fact, they incline to overload the system
 and hold tightly a range of information openly available in other
 countries.
 Many party and government organs produce restricted publications.
 These go to a selected clientele, usually officials who have reached a
 designated level of responsibility or who occupy posts affected by a
 new turn in the line.  The contents are used by such officials as a
 guide to their day-to-day activities and as background for lectures
 to subordinates.  One such publication is Reference News, a daily
 bulletin which does little more than rehash foreign news dispatches.
 The fact that such a publication is distributed only to officials whose
 duties are judged to require it testifies to the Chinese Communists'
 security mania.   Open technical publications from abroad are han-
 dled in a similar fashion.
 The party press
 Despite this preoccupation with security, a reliable key to Peiping
 thinking can be found in the pages of party publications like People's
 Daily and Red Flag.  They are carefully studied, for a reader is aware
 that he may be called upon for a personal elucidation of passages at
 the next meeting of his study group.  The Chinese party press, with
 its captive audience, is surely among the dullest reading matter
 offered on a daily basis anywhere in the world.
 Articles in the top Peiping publications regarded as especially
 important get broad and timely dissemination.  They are broadcast
 to both domestic and foreign listeners.  Materials so handled are
 speeches by important regime figures, communiques from Central
 Committee sessions, vital editorials and a host of lesser items.  This
 material frequently appears verbatim in papers outside the capital
 the same or the following day.  Collections of pertinent articles on a
 common theme are sometimes gathered into a pamphlet and distrib-
 uted at home and wherever possible abroad.
 Meetings
 The meeting is a third channel which supplements and fills out the
 other two.  Meetings and conferences seem to be a necessary part of
 life in all societies, but in few places do they absorb so much of the
 person's time and energies as in Communist China.  The Chinese
 Communists have raised the meeting almost to a governing technique.
 From national conferences held in Peiping with great magnificence to
 the neighborhood study meeting in a humble dwelling down the block
 group discussions are a prominent feature of the Chinese intellectual
 landscape.
 Meetings can be strictly party affairs, or they can involve a mix of
 party and non-party types in which the party element is always
 dominant.  The objective is to communicate decisions reached by
 constituted authority, to explain these decisions, to persuade those in
 attendance as to the wisdom of the course chosen and to point out to
 them their part in carrying out the decision.

 Even plenar * sessions of the party's Central Committee can be
 viewed in this ght.  They provide the opportunity for an airing of
 policy lines which have been hammered out in earlier, more restricted
 sessions.  Regional and local party conferences follow to "pass along
 the spirit" of the Central Committee's deliberations
 The same is true of sessions of the National People's Congress,
 the China People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Supreme
 State Conference.  Led by top party men, they are essentially meet-
 ings of citizens, whose counsel may at times be genuinely valued but
 who are normally brought together to hear party leaders expound
 party policy.  An effort is made at such iiiectin~s to -ry and impart to
 the non-party delegates a sense of participation in the: process of ruling
 China.
 There are also specialized conferences like a statistical work con-
 ference or a conference on political work in the arnumd forces.  These
 bring together a group of important officials involNed in a common
 undertaking.  Some may precede a party decision on a given subject
 and may thus represent an opportunity for the expression of individual
 opinion.  But most publicized meetings are convened for the leader-
 ship to display its interest in a given topic and expose As views thereon.
 Some conferences are used, at least partially, as incentives.  For
 example, the party sponsors periodic conferences of labor heroes, acti-
 vists and other "advanced elements,"  Individuals are brought to
 Peiping at public expense.  Some are accorded the honor of meeting
 key figures, ,including at times Mao Tse-tung himself.  An invitation
 to such a conference doubtless confers considerable status locally on
 the recipient.
 B far the most prevalent meetings are the regular sessions of one's
 local study group.  Stimulated and directed by pa-ty cadres, these
 small groups of 10-30 persons meet regularly throughout China.
 The leaders plainly attach much importance to them since they are
 willing to accept the significant losses in productive time which they
 entail. These meetings may take up no more tha:i a few hours a
 week or they may occupy half a, day or more every day over an ex-
 tended period.
 Attendance at the meetings, like many other activities in Communist
 China, is ostensibly voluntary.  Social and other pressures are,
 however, exerted against absenteeism.  Anyoneso bold as to cut the
 meetings could expect visits from local party cadres, friends and
 colleagues which would be continued until he relented.  In the view
 of one ex-resident of the mainland, attendance is "like going to
 church in an orphanage"
 The topics of these meetings are usually current affairs as seen
 through tlio eyes of the party leaders. The Sino-Soviet dispute and
 Khrushchev's many shortcomings were popular subjects during 1962.
 The leader, normally a party member, opens a meeting by outlining
 the party's thought on the selected topic.  Evcrycno joins in the
 subsequent discussion.  Failure to speak out is regarded as suspicious.
 Persistent refusal to play the game would probably result in a request
 for a written explanation. This paper would then form the subject
 matter of a subsequent meeting.  Members of the group would
 subject the explanation to a searching critique for completeness and
 sincerity, both highly valued in a self-criticism of this sort.
 Meetings are sometimes used to persuade an indiv_dual or a group
 of individuals to accept some new task.  At the height of the down-
 Approved For Release 2004/05/12 : CIA-RDP65B00383R000200010038-0
 Ap~~~2/~~I[a~ of WR0;90010038-0
 to-the-farm movement in 1959-1962, meetings to persuade those
 earmarked for movement were common.  Not many city dwellers
 were anxious to go out and live and work with the peasants, but there
 were few recorded instances of refusal after a few persuasion sessions.
 The earnestness of the group's persuaders was doubtless stimulated
 by a realization that a lack of all-out effort on their part would only
 single them as likely candidates for the next batch.
 The Chinese Communists have no fixed way of dealing with
 offenders.  One method is to expose an individual to public humilia-
 tion and ridicule at a "struggle" meeting.  Struggle meetings were
 more common during the land reform movement in the early 1950's
 than they are now. They are still used, however, to deal with persons
 charged, for example, with counter-revolutionary activities.  The
 meetings are not meant to be public trials.  Individuals brought
 before them have already been judged guilty. The objective is to
 provide a salutory example for the people.
 Such a meeting might be opened by a recitation by the presiding
 cadre of the political crimes committed, the heresies written, spoken or
 thought.  Comments are invited from the audience, an invitation
 scarcely to be ignored since silence contains the suggestion of similar
 infection. The meeting may accept a sniveling confession from the
 person being "struggled" with or move directly to sentencing, usually
 either execution on the spot or an open-ended sentence at labor
 reform.   Those who have attended become active agents of regime
 retribution.
 Just how effective are these various methods of spreading the word?
 The system appears to operate very well when it comes to disseminat-
 ing regime policy downward.  It is in fact one of the most effective
 things the Chinese Communists do.  The system operates less well
 in other directions.  It has been used too frequently by the leadership
 to smell out real or potential dissent. As a result it has become a
 sluggish instrumentality for conveyin suggestions to the leaders or
 for informing them of real conditions in the country.
 This difficulty in upward communications bothers the leaders at
 the party center.  They have launched periodic campaigns to stimu-
 late discussion and even criticism, and to insist on veracity in reports
 made to them.  They are doubtless sincere, but such efforts encounter
 formidable obstacles.  For one thing an individual can never be quite
 sure where the boundaries of permissible debate are at a given time.
 The boundaries shift, and what seems permissible today may turn out
 to be the rankest sort of deviation tomorrow.  Chinese have before
 them the lesson of the aftermath of the liberalization effort of early
 1957 when the party promised free debate--to "let one hundred
 flowers bloom, let all schools of thought contend."  Many of the
 flowers turned into poisonous weeds in a short period of time, and a
 number of careers were blighted.  Recollection of this makes for
 caution in accepting present party encouragement to speak out.
 Nevertheless, genuine intellectual debate does take place.  In
 1962, for example, economic publications printed articles which
 advanced suggestions on how resources could be used more effectively.
 Others discussed in fairly frank terms the problems of economic
 management in a socialist state.  One even offered the argument
 that profits had a role to play in a socialist economy.  The airing
 of such ideas was clearly not an attempt by the leaders, who would

 probably regard the last argument as perilously close to heresy, to
 propagate a new party line. It seems rather to have been part of an
 attempt to extend somewhat the boundaries of permissible intellectual
 discussion.
 VII. AN APPRAISAL OF THE SYSTEM
 The guiding principles of Chinese Communist personnel manage-
 ment were formulated in the less complicated world of the Chinese
 revolution and do not appear to have been markedly changed since.
 They include: 1) the absolute supremacy of the party 2) a highly
 centralized management technique, and 3) a remarkabjle continuity
 and unity of purpose at the top echelons.  They have produced a
 disciplined and dedicated elite, but at some cost in flexibility and
 individual initiative.
 Mao Tse-tung and his closest associates are strong personalities,
 the result of rigorous Chinese Communist selection processes.  The
 leading group has displayed high organizational and administrative
 capabi 'tees.  It has been able to move with dispatch on some issues
 confronting China.  Its approach to others has been halting.    It
 moved very quickly to exploit to Chinese advantage Soviet discom-
 fiture as a result of the Cuban crisis in the fall of 19032.                                  Communes
 were set up almost overnight in 1958, but the three-year retreat from
 these ill-conceived units has, on the other hand, been slow and painful.
 Party personnel processes have brought to the second level of
 authority devoted, loyal men who share the aims and convictions of
 the top leaders and speak the same language.  They are men who
 have had many years of administrative experience, men who have
 proven themseles to be tough and ruthless.  Only true believers get
 this far in the system.  As a group they are more likely to be versed
 in Marxism-Leninism and the teaching of Mao than in a technical
 specialty.
 Many middle and lower level officials appear able, but there does
 seem to be a shortage of good administrators and managers.  These
 lesser officials operate in a system which constantly preaches dis-
 cipline.  Naturally, many fail to develop an aptitude for vigorous,
 independent action.  They become adept buck-passers, bureaucrats
 who check too many things with Peiping.  This further overloads the
 to  command in which key figures already hold sec oral concurrent
 jogs. These officials can giveless than full time and energy to any
 one of their posts.  These men, whether in high party position or low,
 are in a sense the end product of Chinese Communist political indoc-
 trination.  This striking program has to a great extent created and
 maintained a unity of approach unthinkable in a democratic state.
 No real opposition is countenanced and no alternative courses are
 offered. There is relatively little wheel-spinning over objective or
 method.
 The framework for recruitment, transfer and promotion focuses
 a great deal of power and responsibility in a few hands.  The domi-
 nant leaders identify national security priorities and commit talent
 to favored programs in complete freedom.  People selected for jobs
 have no real individual safeguards such as exist in the U.S. or Western
 nations.  Most Chinese accept this sort of treatment, go where
 they are told to go by the authorities and do what they are told to
 do.  There is no outside competition for talent.  Recruitment and

 Ap p~~~0i~v~4~~~$ 3t32QQ010038-0
 assignment of personnel present no problems; undesirable turnover
 is rare.
 The system permits the authorities to channel the country's best
 talent, insofar as it is available, into key areas of national policy.
 Great efforts are made to stimulate work in approved scientific,
 technological and economic fields, especially those related to the mar-
 tial arts.  This work is supported and directed by the party.
 However, the system does try, all too frequently, to force round
 pegs into square holes.  The overall record of the assigning authori-
 ties might be termed fair to good.
 Persons who have visited Communist China testify that the average
 Chinese Communist functionary is a hard worker.  This is partly the
 result of the existing personnel system.  Competition is fierce, and
 the individual must make his way within the mold in which the system
 has cast him.  There is no opportunity to shift jobs, or even to resign.
 Advancement depends entirely upon pleasing the authorities above.
 The asceticism preached by the party helps produce individuals willing
 to devote themselves fully to their work.  The sense of dedication
 today may not be what it was in the earlier years, but enough remains
 so that it is a significant strength of the Chinese Communist system.
 Material incentives are present and important in keeping the
 Chinese functionary bent to his task.  His perquisites are small, but
 valued amidst the general poverty of China. These functionaries also
 work under the stimulus of a system of retribution which operates on
 abstract and shifting principles.
 Overstaffing is a problem in today's China.  Swollen staffs can be
 attributed in part to the Chinese Communist practice of giving on-the-
 job training to people who will be moved to staff other offices or fac-
 tories when they are finished.  A lack of mechanical aids means that
 many office and factory tasks, done elsewhere by machine, are done
 by hand in China.  But the most telling reason is simply China's
 tremendous population.
 Skilled manpower in China is strictly limited, yet the present leaders
 fail to make full use of what they have.  They seem quite willing to
 fritter away some of the talent they do have.
 Students who have been educated abroad are, regarded, almost
 without exception, with suspicion when they return to China.  They
 are viewed as having been infected by foreign ideas.  It is up to them
 to prove otherwise, and over the long haul.  Many returned students,
 even those afire with the desire to help build up a new China, find it
 hard to break through this shell of suspicion.        They find that the
 party will not make full use of their hard-won skills.
 The leaders in fact find it hard to rely fully on technically trained
 people, no matter where their education was won.      There are in China
 competent scientists and economists who could contribute more than
 they do to the development of plans and practices.  These people
 are, under the operation of the present personnel system, rigidly
 excluded from policymaking roles.  The dominant figures-dogmatic,
 poorly educated and distrustful men-prefer to rely for advice on
 long-term associates who share the leaders' background, prejudices
 and shortcomings.
 Talent is also wasted in the party's obsessive drive for political
 conformity.  Countless man-hours are devoted to political indoctrina-

 tion and lost to production or the search for technical kiow-how. The
 authorities are willing to Pay the price.
 The personnel situation in Communist China today is in some ways
 like that in the Soviet Union during Stalin's dying days.  The top
 strata, overworked, old and tired, forms an impenetrable roadblock
 for those below.  The bureaucracy is stagnating.  Advancement, even
 of able and trusted people, is generally slow and ponderous.  Party
 seniority and personal relationships are still major factors in selection
 for responsible positions.  What remains to be seen _s whether the
 departure of the present leaders will rejuvenate the system.
