 China-Eastern Europe: Beijng Courts Moscow's Allies
 Summary
 China is expanding relations with Eastern Europe at a brisk pace in
 an effort to encourage trends toward independence and increase trade and
 economic cooperation. Under Moscow's suspicious gaze, the Chinese are
 stepping up official exchanges and even attempting to restore party to
 party ties, something they thus far refuse to do with the Soviets. The
 Chinese claim they will gain economic benefits from increased trade with
 the region, but we believe the prospects for such trade are limited. The
 chances of significantly influencing the East Europeans to show greater
 independence from Moscow are, if anything, even more remote, especially
 now that a new and younger Soviet leadership has begun to assert itself.
 This memorandum was prepared byl           Office of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 23 October "o6 was used in its preparation. Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be direcre,l to the Chief, Foreign Affairs, China Division,

 Beijing's Strategy
 The opening to Eastern Europe -- initiated in 1981-82 -- is part of a wider
 strategy to expand China's foreign ties, undo the excesses of the Cultural Revolution,
 and reduce tensions with the Soviet bloc. China has sought to exploit Soviet
 preoccupation in recent years with internal political succession and economic failures
 and external problems such as Afghanistan to rebuild its ties with Soviet client states
 strained when Beijing was pursuing a "united front" approach with the United States and
 Japan in the 1970s and 1980s. Beijing's foreign policy theorists describe their new
 orientation as multipolar, arguing that by promoting regional independence and
 prosperity there will be less scope for superpower interference and thus less chance for
 war.
 Behind the new rhetoric, however, Beijing still seeks to limit Soviet influence as
 its prime goal. Renewed US assertiveness against Soviet expansionism has permitted
 the Chinese to use more subtle political and economic measures to try to accomplish
 their objectives. In the case of East Europe, by reducing tensions with the USSR and
 avoiding identification with the United States, the Chinese have gained greater access to
 the Warsaw Pact capitals. Beijing presumably hopes that by increasing the number and
 intensity of these contacts it can gradually begin to exercise some influence and give
 the bloc countries a vested interest in good ties with China.
 Beijing also looks to Eastern Europe as a potential market for Chinese goods and
 source of needed equipment, especially for some of China's Soviet-built factories that
 date from the 1950s. Trade with Eastern Europe, according to an article published in
 China's economic press in August, is particularly attractive because it is conducted on a
 barter basis, allowing China to husband its foreign exchange for critical purchases of
 Western technology and equipment. In return the Chinese are receiving serviceable
 machine tools and other goods. The Chinese also see predictability and stability as
 advantages in East European markets, deriving in part from the existence of
 complementary foreign trade bureaucracies.
 Expanding Contacts
 China's quarrel with the USSR in the early 1960s and the subsequent excesses of
 the Cultural Revolution era (1966-76) froze Beijing's relations with all but one of Eastern
 Europe's capitals. Until the 1970s, China s only ally in the region was Albania, and the
 chief product of that relationship was flattery for Mao Zedong's ideological pretensions.
 In the early 1970s, Beijing forged a close relationship with Romania based on their
 common opposition to Soviet domination  After Mao's death in 1976, the Chinese
 dropped their objections to Titoism, again in the interest of reinforcing Yugoslav
 independence from Soviet interference, and significantly improved relations.

 Beijing's relations with Moscow's close allies in the region continued to languish
 until 1981, however, hostage to the state of Sino-Soviet relations. Annual trade
 agreements proved economically marginal and politically insignificant. The East
 Europeans parroted the Soviet line against China in the wake of Chairman Hua Guofeng's
 outspokenly anti-Soviet visits to Romania and Yugoslavia in 1978, and after China's
 invasion of Vietnam in 1979. In 1980, the Chinese seemed to endorse Solidarity's efforts
 in Poland because of their anti-Soviet implications, but backed down when the
 reverberations of Solidarity's challenge to a ruling party were felt at home among
 China's own budding protest movements.
 The Chinese began to increase their exchanges with the Soviet Union's allies
 slowly at first, apparently without a fixed plan for expansion. The first noteworthy
 delegations to the region were factfinding missions, sent to investigate experiments with
 economic reform in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. These had grown naturally from
 China's internal search for a model of socialist modernization and followed disappointing
 efforts to learn from Yugoslav experiences.
 China's incremental approach probably derived in part from a desire not to
 damage the close relationships painstakingly built with Romania and Yugoslavia in the
 1970s. The lack of a clear Soviet signal authorizing increased East European contacts
 with the Chinese undoubtedly was an even more important impediment for all the
 Eastern countries except East Germany. According to US Embassy Berlin reporting, the
 Chinese there believe the East Germans received Soviet encouragement to initiate low
 level contacts as early as 1980. We suspect the Soviets used the East Germans as a
 probe for changes in Beijing's attitude toward Moscow before committing their own
 prestige to such an effort.
 The break in this pattern occurred in March 1982, when General Secretary
 Brezhnev, attempting to exploit US-China strains over sales of arms to Taiwan, made a
 speech in Tashkent calling for improving Sino-Soviet relations. The Chinese formally
 responded months later, following an extended internal debate that ended at the Twelfth
 Party Congress in September 1982. On the one hand, China agreed to reopen political
 talks at the vice foreign minister level with the USSR that had been suspended after the
 invasion of Afghanistan. On the other, Beijing used the party forum to articulate a policy
 toward foreign communist parties that implied that the Chinese would attempt to take
 advantage of differences between the USSR and its allies.
 At the Congress, Hu Yaobang denounced "the practice of one party compelling
 other parties to make their policies serve its own party and state policies, or even
 resorting to armed intervention in other countries," a thinly veiled reference to the
 Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechosh vakia. Hu added that China intended to
 establish contacts with more parties on the basis of "independence, complete equality,
 mutual respect, and noninterference."
 In fact, the Chinese had already begun modestly to take advantage of the new
 access to the East Europeans that Brezhnev gave them. Beijing authorized the first
 student exchanges with East Germany in July 1982. According to US Embassy reporting,
 China appointed new ambassadors to Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

 and Bulgaria in 1982-83 who were better qualified and more capable than their
 predecessors -- a development in keeping with new Foreign Ministry personnel trends
 but also an indication of the seriousness of Beijing's approach to the region.
 Party Contacts Resume
 The most sensitive barometer of the state of relations between communist
 countries is their party-to-party dealings. The falling out between Moscow and Beijing
 had complex origins, but the the two sides set forth their dispute most forcefully in
 ideological terms and at party forums. As the Sino-Soviet rift widened, China and the
 USSR's East European allies broke off their party relations in the mid 1960s. They
 stopped exchanging party delegations and attending each other's congresses.
 The reinvigoration of Beijing's policy in the region has now prompted increased
 interest on both sides of the Sino-Soviet dividing line in improving party relations.
 Because both Moscow and Beijing want party relations to be reestablished on their own
 terms, however, the pace of resumed contacts is slow and deliberate.
 By March 1983, the Chinese Communist Party grew more confident and gave its
 members in East European missions additional latitude to use and publicize party titles
 including calling the East European governments "socialist."
 editors of Chinese party publications began to make quiet visits to Hungary at
 that time. Early last year, according to                 Embassy Berlin reporting, Beijing
 was ready to resume full party relations with at least the Germans for the first time
 since the Sino-Soviet rift 20 years before.
 China tried to exploit the USSR's extended leadership crisis to encourage greater
 East European independence during 1983-84. Beijing stepped up the frequency and level
 of delegations travelling to the East. General Secretary Hu Yaobang first travelled to
 Yugoslavia and Romania in spring 1983, to reassure those countries of China's
 continuing commitment to them and to d-~iiver -- on Moscow's doorstep -- Beijing's
 strong message of independence at about the same time, senior officials responsible for
 dealings with Eastern Europe and the USSR began making routine swings through the
 region, with increasing media coverage by the Chinese and most of their counterparts.
 Vice Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his deputy for the USSR and Eastern  Europe, Ma
 Xusheng, visited the region on separate itineraries in May and June.

 In 1984, Chen Muhua, Alternate Politburo Member and then Minister of Foreign
 Economic Relations and Trade, travelled to Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. In
 Hungary, according to Embassy reporting, she raised political issues during talks that her
 hosts felt were inappropriate or might offend the USSR. One Hungarian official
 speculated that Chen's purpose was to "drive a wedge between Hungary and the Soviet
 Union." The official continued that the USSR "has expressed approval of our efforts to
 increase trade relations with China if this will improve our ailing economy, but
 discussing politics with us cannot help at all."
 During the Chernenko interregnum especially, China intensified its efforts. The
 Chinese-controlled press in Hong Kong gave particular emphasis to the visit of
 Hungary's Deputy Premier Jozsef Marjai to Beijing in August 1984, noting that it
 occurred not long after differences emerged between Moscow and Budapest over
 relations with Bonn. Beijing's media also favorably replayed East European commentary
 endorsing  ast German General Secretary Honecker's attempt to visit West Germany.
 The Soviet Union continues, however, to block its allies from resuming formal
 party ties with China. The Chinese, according to Embassy Berlin reporting, suspect that
 the Soviet ploy to use Germany to flirt with China went too far and the Soviets are now
 holding the East Germans back.
 One area where the Chinese have not endeavored to make inroads, we believe,
 is military contacts with the Warsaw Pact forces. For some time, China has exchanged
 military delegations with Romania, but we know of no such activity in the other East
 European Bloc countries, although there are military attaches in each capital.                 25X1
 In order to make the most of its narrow access to East Europe, Beijing focuses
 on developing trade and economic cooperation. In 1984, Chinese officials negotiated
 economic cooperation agreements with each of the bloc partners. Although modest
 when compared with the scale of activity envisioned under similar agreements with
 Japan and the West, these undertakings will facilitate further exchanges of economic
 delegations and in some cases assistance in updating China's old Soviet-style industrial
 lants.
 This year, the Chinese signed tong term trade agreements with each of the
 countries. Fast rising Vice Premier Li Pend visited Poland, East Germany, and
 Czechoslovakia in the course of negotiating or signing the pacts. He took advantage of
 the precedent set at Chernenko's funeral by conveying party greetings from Hu Yaobang

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP04T00447R000302160001-2
 Despite the political points scored, however, the agreements often set targets for
 annual trade volume well above what the respective officials believe is feasible. The
 agreement with East Germany, for example, envisions increasing two-way trade 250
 percent by 1990 over the 1984 total of $220 million. But Chinese officials in Berlin have
 pointed to problems in East Germany's ability to deliver machinery and items such as
 sheet steel that China wants. A chronic problem in trade with Romania, shortfalls are
 becoming standard for China's trade with Eastern Europe in general. In 1983, trade
 projections went up, but actual volume declined for half the countries and failed to
 reach the targets in every case. The overall trade picture remained mixed in 1984, with
 some modest increases in Chinese exports to the region. All East European trade
 (excluding Romania, Albania, and Yugoslavia) totals less than China's trade with West
 Germany alone: $846 million vs. $1.8 billion in 1984.
 Beijing and its East European trading partners appear to have set high goals for
 political as well as economic purposes, but in our view the potential for trade to be a
 driving force for substantially improved relations is limited. Although Beijing's media
 have discussed the potential for Eastern Europe to soak up products that China is
 prevented from marketing in the West, the extended negotiations of this past spring and
 summer, according to embassy reporting, demonstrated the basic difficulty of drawing
 up lists of mutually acceptable goods. Part of the problem appears to be a result of
 Chinese efforts to maneuver the East Europeans into competing with one another for
 the China trade in goods they produce in common. Another East European concern is
 that sales of their higher technologies are the only way to boost trade significantly over
 the long term, but what Eastern Europe has to offer is not advanced enough to attract
 the Chinese away from Western suppliers.
 We expect the Chinese will continue their long-term, patient approach to Eastern
 Europe, slowly rebuilding personal, institutional, and information links in the region.
 Their annual agreements and increased personnel exchanges will present additional
 opportunities to score political points.
 We believe Beijing's primary goal will remain exploiting divisions between the
 USSR and Eastern Europe. Premier Zhao Ziyang told West European leaders last summer
 that China's policy is to encourage Eastern Europe to display "more independence of
 thought." As fellow communists and former allies, however, they are undoubtedly
 acutely aware of the severe limits on East European maneuverability and of the Soviet
 capability to manipulate their allies.                                     moreover, if
 the Soviets suddenly lifted their constraints on the East Europeans, there would still be
 practical limits on what China can achia,- as seen in the case of trade.
 The Chinese task is made doubly t-tticult by Soviet attempts to channel
 Sino-East European contacts onto a course leading primarily to improved Sino-Soviet
 ties, especially to party relations. Whatever hopes Beijing may have had that it could
 take advantage of Soviet preoccupation with its internal politics for another year or so
 seem to be evaporating. Deng Xiaoping told foreign visitors earlier this year that

 Gorbachev will probably require two years to firm his grip on power. But an
 authoritative Soviet commentary published in Pravda under the pseudonym 0.
 Vladimirov last June lashed out against manifestations of nationalism within the Soviet
 bloc and demanded greater unity. This has already caused some Chinese officials to
 speculate that the new Soviet leader is moving swiftly to exert more control over East
 European dealings with China.
 Although we expect Beijing to continue trying to increase the levels of its
 exchanges and to expand party contacts, we do not foresee the Chinese trying -- much
 less succeeding -- in restoring full party relations with the parties in East Germany,
 Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Bulgaria without a major change in the Soviet
