 Mexican Bank            Lopez Portillo's failure once again to address the need for austerity measures
 Nationalization0 in his last State of the Union address raises to a new level domestic and
 international concerns about his willingness to take actions necessary to resolve
 the financial crisis. Instead, Lopez Portillo announced nationalization of
 Mexican banks and expanded exchange controls. The nationalization measure
 will affect some 50 private banks with assets of about $26 billion. Banks will
 be closed until 6 September while new policies are sorted out.
 Lopez Portillo blamed Mexico's economic problems on international economic
 trends and on domestic bankers and speculators who he said sent $22 billion
 out of Mexico in the last two years. He characterized the finacial crisis as tem-
 porary. Contrary to widespread expectations among Mexican and internation-
 al observers that he would announce new austerity measures, Lopez Portillo
 only stated that "enormous economic and political sacrifices" would be
 required to overcome Mexico's problems. He also made vague references about
 international financiers attempting to impose their economic prescriptions on
 Mexico.
 Organized labor has been calling for full exchange controls and increasing
 intervention in banking and social sectors; the measures announced by Lopez
 Portillo may have been designed to ensure labor's continued support. By
 nationalizing the banks, Mexico City is guaranteeing continued solvency of
 banks that have been hard hit by the growing inability of many private-sector
 firms to repay loans. Nevertheless, private-sector confidence in the government
 will probably diminish and the nationalization is unlikely to curtail capital
 flight.
 The imposition of more controls on the economy will complicate ongoing
 negotiations with the IMF and reduce chances of reaching an agreement by
 the mid-October target date. Meanwhile, international bankers will be
 unwilling to lend new money. The administration's failure to put into effect a
 viable austerity program soon would put even more strain on ruling party
 cohesion during the transition period.

 Perspective-Economic Recovery in the OECD
 The long-awaited economic recovery in the industrial countries is developing,
 but only weakly. Interest rates remain high, budget deficits are increasing,
 profit margins remain low, and unemployment continues to rise. This poor
 economic performance presages an environment in which alliance cooperation
 will be difficult to muster.
 The Changing Structure of Western Bank Lending
 Over the last several years non-US commercial banks have greatly stepped up
 their international lending to both corporate and government borrowers. In
 addition, the maturity structure of loans has been shortened and the cost of
 borrowing has risen, making it more difficult for borrowers to meet their
 financial obligations.                                           25X1

 Economic Recovery in the OECD
 The long-awaited economic recovery in the industrial countries is developing,
 but only weakly. Interest rates remain high, budget deficits are increasing, and
 profit margins remain low. Under these circumstances, it is hard to imagine
 much of a rebound in either spending or investment in the major industrial
 countries. This poor economic performance presages an environment in which
 alliance cooperation will be difficult to muster.F____1            25X1
 August, and about 16 percent of the Spanish labor force is idle.
 Economic growth in the four major West European countries should average
 about 2 percent in second-half 1982, up from 1.5 percent in the first six
 months of the year and 0.6 percent in second-half 1981. The West European
 unemployment problem in these circumstances will probably get worse. By
 yearend 1982, total OECD unemployment could reach 29 million-about 15
 percent above the 1981 level. In several countries, unemployment rates will
 remain well above 10 percent; British unemployment stood at 12.5 percent in
 import volume
 2bAl
 One thing industrialized countries now have going for them is that inflation
 rates are tapering off. For the OECD as a whole, consumer prices in 1982 are
 expected to rise by 8.2 percent, the smallest annual increase since 1978. The
 improvement will not be uniform, and in some countries-such as France,
 Italy, and Spain-large budget deficits, rapid monetary growth, and probable
 currency depreciation against the dollar will contribute to continued double-
 digit inflation rates. The OECD's current account deficit also has begun to im-
 prove because of lower raw material prices, some export gains, and declining
 increase foreign sales.
 The meager recovery that seems to be materializing could easily falter. For 25X1
 one thing, especially in Western Europe, recovery depends on an upturn in
 export sales. Given economic conditions in other industrial countries and the
 weakening position of major LDCs, this rebound may not occur. Japan, as in
 the past, is also counting on export expansion for a large share of its economic
 growth during the next 18 months. Among the major foreign countries, the
 Japanese and West Germans are probably in the best competitive position to

 Altogether these conditions do not bode well for smooth international econom-
 ic relations.
 ? Trade frictions will continue as countries attempt to bolster their own growth
 by protecting weak industries and boosting exports.
 ? Weak OECD growth will mean continued soft commodity markets that will
 hurt LDC capacity to handle debt and their role as markets for exports from
 developed countries.
 ? Although they are coming down US interest rates still will be blamed for the
 economic malaise in the West.

 Iran Moves To
 Offset Iraqi Air
 Attacks
 Energy
 National Iranian Oil Company is now offering crude oil at a
 discount price of $28 per barrel. The new discount, $3.20 below official prices,
 is intended to offset the tripling in insurance premiums and the doubling in
 charter rates-now totaling $2.36 per barrel-resulting from the recent Iraqi
 economic growth, oil use increased 3 percent over year-earlier levels, reflecting
 in part the improvement in oil prices relative to the major competing fuel,
 natural gas. The explosive growth in natural gas demand experienced during
 the last two decades seems to have finally stopped, as gas usage recorded its
 first decline in 30 years, down 1 percent through midyear. With prospects for
 continued stagnation in the UK economy and gradually increasing gas prices
 as a result of UK policy decisions, gas consumption for the balance of the
 1980s could fall well below previous expectations. This could reduce the need
 for additional Norwegian imports, thus freeing up supplies for the Continent.
 25X1
 Although exports may have fallen to around 1.5 million b/d immediately
 following the recent Iraqi air attacks at Khark, we believe Iran will continue
 substantially discounting to return exports to previous levels of about 2.0
 million b/d. Buyers are reportedly still actively seeking tankers and owners are
 accepting new charters to load at Khark. Only if Iraq inflicts major damage to
 foreign tankers or oil export facilities, will Iranian exports be seriously
 impeded for any length of time.                                     25X1

 find some way to boost the competitiveness of its oil. Indonesia's oil revenues,
 the mainstay of the country's economy, have already dropped 25 percent this
 year as a result of its production and pricing policies.
 International Trade, Technology, and Finance
 West European Lower    The rapid decline in US interest rates has triggered a round of rate cuts in
 Interest Rates         Western Europe. In the last two weeks, six West European central banks-the
 Belgian, Italian, Dutch, Swiss, Austrian, and West German-have cut
 discount rates by as much as 1 percentage point. The Bundesbank trimmed its
 discount rate to 7 percent from the 7.5 percent that had been in place since
 May 1980; the Lombard rate-the rate for loans secured by bonds and
 equities-was lowered by 1 percentage point to 8 percent. The financial press
 reports that the Bank of England also is moving to ease interest rates. If US in-
 terest rates continue to fall, however, West European rates are unlikely to keep
 pace. The Bank of France has not cut its rates reportedly because it fears
 downward pressure on the franc. Other central bankers in Western Europe
 may well hold back on reductions in their interest rates in an attempt to
 strengthen their currencies against the US dollar. Moreover, real interest rates
 in most West European countries have been only one-third to one-half the level
 of real rates in the United States.
 IMF Meeting            Next week's IMF meeting in Toronto will discuss increasing member country
 contributions to the Fund under the Eighth General Review of quotas. Most of
 the major foreign industrial nations support an increase in the IMF's current
 $65.9 billion capital base by anywhere from 50 to 100 percent. No agreement
 on the size of the quota increase is likely at this year's meeting, but in our
 judgment, most industrial nations probably will not accept an increase below
 $30 billion. The meeting comes at a time when a growing number of LDCs are
 being forced to turn to the IMF because of the difficulties in servicing their
 debt obligations. Mexico-the largest LDC debtor-has recently announced
 its intention to go to the IMF for loans of $4-5 billion, while Argentina-the
 third-largest debtor-has indicated it will draw amounts up to $1.5 billion.

 have been supported by nine other exporters, but 14 others, including Thailand

 developing country exporters might produce minor EC concessions, the
 exporters have little leverage and probably will yield before the late September
 negotiating deadline imposed by the EC rather than face the prospect of

 The EC Commission's recent imposition of $15 million in fines against
 European steel companies that have exceeded their production quotas indicates
 the Commission is actively enforcing the production limitation system included
 in the Community's overall steel restructuring program. The eight steel firms
 involved together produced almost 200,000 tons of steel beyond their quotas
 between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the third quarter of 1981. The fines,
 however, may not be paid. Kloeckner, a West German firm that was assessed
 the largest fine-about $9.8 million-intends to appeal the Commission's
 decision to the European Court of Justice and if necessary will open

 key party economic committees and, along with Shindy, authored a long

 Mubarak plans to deal more actively with Egyptian economic problems in the
 months ahead. Mubarak has been pursuing a cautious approach toward the
 economy in order to maintain stability after Sadat's assassination and to
 ameliorate the erratic policies of former Deputy Prime Minister Meguid.
 Mubarak's caution, however, has been interpreted as indecisiveness by a wide
 range of Egyptian interest groups. We believe Mubarak probably has greater
 trust in his new economic ministers and plans to give them more leeway in for-
 mulating policy changes. Nevertheless, the new economic team is unlikely to
 propose sweeping economic reforms that carry significant political risks

 Argentina's New        The 24 August resignation of Argentine Economy Minister Dagnino-after
 Economic Team          only seven weeks in office-has brought to power an economic policy team
 likely to offer little effective resistance to President Bignone's growing use of
 populist remedies to assuage public discontent. Buenos Aires announced on 26
 August another 30-percent wage hike to stem labor unrest, although the new
 salary adjustment will only drive inflation higher. Jorge Wehbe, the new
 Economy Minister, has promised seemingly inconsistent policies aimed at
 halting the inflationary spiral and improving government revenues, while
 developing an emergency housing construction and public works program. In
 contrast, Julio Gonazalez del Solar, the new Central Bank president, is a free
 market proponent; the US Embassy reports he favors moves to reduce public
 expenditures, tighten controls over monetary expansion, and promote Argen-
 tine exports. The lack of coordinated economic leadership has worrisome
 implications. Divergent priorities will probably undermine any effort to
 formulate and implement a coherent stabilization program; this would both
 heighten foreign lenders' concerns and foster resistance to new financing. In
 the worst case, excessive policy zigzags could lay the foundation for economic
 crisis by paralyzing industrial activity, disrupting export marketing, and

 Prospects For           The PLO exodus from Beirut and the election of Bashir Jumayyil as President
 Reconstruction in       are unlikely to enable Lebanon to soon regain its status as the financial,
 Lebanon                 transportation, and communications center for the Middle East. Political
 instability and the Israeli presence will limit, at least in the short run, the
 amount of funds multinational lending agencies and the wealthy Arab states
 are willing to commit. A modest reconstruction effort to repair and replace
 buildings and infrastructure in the heaviest hit areas is more feasible and could
 get under way without much delay
 Lebanese economic planners say at least $12 billion in grants and concessional
 loans from abroad will be needed for reconstruction, according to a press
 report. These funds would be used to repair damage inflicted during the Israeli
 invasion, as well as damage that occurred during the 1975-76 civil war. The
 Chairman of the Council for Reconstruction and Development said the
 government will oversee the restoration of such things as roads, schools,
 hospitals, and water and power supplies and leave housing to private compa-
 nies subsidized by the government. Municipal authorities, according to a press
 report, estimate that one-fourth   the buildings in West Beirut are heavily
 damaged or destroyed.
 With foreign exchange reserves of $1.3 billion and an estimated $2 billion in
 annual worker remittances, the Lebanese can cover some of the foreign
 exchange costs of reconstruction themselves. Reduced output because of
 damage inflicted during the Israeli invasion and lack of government control in
 many areas of the country will, however, hinder efforts to collect taxes.
 Lebanese political and business leaders have recently expressed the hope to US
 Embassy officials that the United States will launch a "mini-Marshall Plan."
 Saudi Arabia, other Arab oil-producing states, and the World Bank have also
 been mentioned as possible donors. The World Bank has expressed a willing-
 ness to take the lead on reconstruction efforts if a strong central government is
 established and the government can exercise control throughout the country.
 This will take some time.
 With the election of Jumayyil, who has close ties to Israel, the Arabs may be
 reluctant to provide reconstruction aid. Lebanon's Sunnis are extremely
 distrustful of Jumayyil, and Arab leaders, whose populations are predominant-
 ly Sunni, may find it difficult to grant large sums to a government dominated
 by Jumayyil. If Jumayyil takes steps toward a reconciliation with the Sunnis,
 the Arabs would probably be willing to provide some assistance. The Israeli
 presence in southern Lebanon, where economic ties to Israel are already being

 Even if Lebanon's massive political problems are resolved, there is little
 economic incentive for the Arabs to pump money into Lebanon. Prior to the
 civil war, Beirut was the hub of Arab trade, banking, transportation, and
 communications. Since the civil war, however, most Arab countries have
 developed their own service industries and Beirut may not be able to recapture
 its preeminent position in the Arab world. Bahrain has become a major
 financial center, and Saudi banking is developing rapidly. Saudi Arabia and
 Jordan have greatly expanded their own airlines, and most Arab states have
 installed their own communications facilities. Wealthy Arabs have found other
 locations-Monte Carlo and London, for example-to enjoy the night life. The
 younger generation is now being educated in England or the United States.

 declined, reaching three-year lows, and the London Interbank Offered Rate-

 credits-has dropped by one-third. The result is a potential saving to Moscow
 of roughly $20 million on every 1 million tons of grain purchased. In addition,
 the price of gold, which Moscow has sold in the past to help finance grain im-
 ports, has risen 27 percent to over $400 per ounce since June. Most observers
 believe that the Soviets will gain little by a further delay in grain purchases,
 but because sharp turnarounds in prices and interest rates are not anticipated,
 Moscow can sit on the sidelines a while longer before making the major
 purchases and still realize a savings. Large, grain stocks, particularly in the
 United States, and the near certainty of another bumper global grain harvest
 assure the Soviets that ample grain supplies will be available from exporters
 until at least late next spring.

 Financial Problems     exports and services are running more than $3.5 billion below Yugoslavia's
 initial projection for 1982. This shortfall and severe reductions in Western
 credits are forcing the Yugoslavs to slash imports, resulting in a decline in in-

 Yugoslavs are more than $1 billion short of covering their obligations for this
 year. The National Bank's bleak projections provide more evidence that
 Yugoslavia may be unable to meet scheduled payments in the months ahead.
 Belgrade's official reserves already are low, and its new foreign exchange law
 has not yet enabled the National Bank to tap the holdings of regional banks.
 Western bankers are taking a more pessimistic view of Yugoslavia's cred-

 Secret
 The Changing Structure of
 Western Bank Lending
 Over the last several years, non-US commercial
 banks have greatly stepped up their international
 lending to both corporate and government borrow-
 ers. Although US banks' share of new loans in-
 creased slightly last year to 29 percent, it was still
 well below the 38-percent share reached in 1976. In
 a more recent development, banks in general are
 substantially shortening the maturity structure of
 new loans, reflecting their concern about debt
 reschedulings and borrowers' ability to maintain
 payments on longer term instruments. The shorter
 terms along with higher interest rates and fees are
 making it more difficult for weaker borrowers to
 meet their financial obligations. At the same time,
 the greater internationalization of bank lending
 along with increasing complexity of banking rela-
 tionships is complicating the issue of who will be
 the lender of last resort in the event of a liquidity
 crunch.
 Since the mid-1970s banks in foreign industrial
 countries have increased their international lending
 at an average annual rate of 25 percent compared
 with average annual US loan growth of 18 percent.
 As a result, US banks' share of outstanding inter-
 national loans dropped from 38 percent in Decem-
 ber 1976 to 27 percent in 1980. The US share
 moved back up to 29 percent last year primarily
 because of sizable increases in US bank lending to
 developed country borrowers and because of appre-
 ciation of the dollar.
 The rapid growth in non-US banks' lending stems
 from the same factors that first attracted US
 banks. Particularly important has been the desire
 of LDCs and the centrally planned economies to
 obtain external financing for economic develop-
 ment. Other factors are:
 ? The greater profitability of international com-
 pared with domestic lending, which stems in part
 from the absence of legal restraints on reserve
 requirements, rates, or fees.
 ? The banks' need for asset diversification.
 ? Multinational corporations' demand for large-
 scale, multicurrency funding.
 ? The opportunity to intermediate between surplus
 and deficit countries.
 ? Political constraints on direct investments.
 The accelerated foreign lending by West European,
 Japanese, and Canadian banks has occurred across
 the entire geographic spectrum. Most dramatic has
 been the sixfold increase in non-US bank lending to
 OPEC since the mid-1970s, which resulted from an
 aggressive marketing effort.
 25X1
 Foreign banks have substantially increased their
 share of what have traditionally been the largest
 LDC lending markets for US banks. About three-
 fourths of total US bank loans to non-OPEC LDCs
 are concentrated in six countries-Brazil, Mexico,
 South Korea, Argentina, Taiwan, and the Philip-
 pines. The US share of these countries' bank debt
 has dropped significantly in recent years, ranging
 from a decline of 15 percentage points in Brazil and
 the Philippines to about 25 percentage points in
 Mexico and South Korea. Only in Taiwan has the
 US share increased. The rise in non-US bank
 lending to these countries can be attributed primar-
 ily to the previously low exposure of non-US banks
 in these LDCs. Moreover, according to a Comptrol-
 ler of the Currency study, in the late 1970s many US
 banks were nearing government-prescribed lending 25X1
 limits in these countries and could not increase loans
 rapidly enough to meet the demand.'
 'Lending limits are imposed on banks by government regulators as
 a constraint on the amount a bank may lend to a single borrower
 These limits are stated as a ratio of bank capital (for example,  25X1
 equity) to bank assets (for example, loans).

 External Financing Problem ~
 Real economic growth in the Caribbean region fell
 to 2.5 percent last year, compared to nearly 4
 percent in 1977; the combined current account
 deficit ballooned from about $200 million in 1977
 to an estimated $1.3 billion in 1981 (excluding the
 French Overseas Departments of French Guiana,
 Guadeloupe, and Martinique). Increased borrowing
 to help finance the worsening current account
 deficit has pushed the region's medium- and long-
 term external debt from $3 billion to $5 billion over
 the same period.
 We believe that the economic downturn is likely to
 bottom out in 1983. Current account deficits are
 expected to level off and in some cases improve due
 to a moderate upturn in the industrialized countries
 and a leveling off of oil prices. Given projected
 levels of foreign assistance, no major financing
 problems are foreseen for 1983.
 Factors Behind Widening
 Current Account Deficits
 The serious setbacks suffered by Caribbean coun-
 tries in their external accounts since 1977 have
 been due to a combination of factors. The OECD-
 wide recession has cut tourism earnings and has
 weakened the demand for traditional exports, par-
 ticularly bauxite. In some countries, such as the
 Bahamas and Barbados, the tourist industry has

 also been hurt by high wage settlements. Unlike
 1973-74, when commodity prices rose along with
 oil prices, commodity prices have been weak since
 1980. World market prices for sugar, for example,
 have plummeted nearly 60 percent from 1980
 levels, while bauxite prices have been flat. More-
 over, for sugar producers that sell to the EC under
 guaranteed prices, a stengthening US dollar has
 reduced the dollar equivalent of the EC prices
 received.

 In addition, the production of key export commod-
 ities has declined due to adverse weather, labor
 problems, and industrial bottlenecks. The region
 has not fully recovered from devastating hurricanes
 in 1979 and 1980. As a result, banana production
 in the Eastern Caribbean, a source of as much as
 43 percent of export earnings in some countries, has
 yet to regain 1979 levels. Sugar production for the
 Caribbean as a whole fell by some 9 percent in
 1981, largely a result of bad weather, crop disease,
 and rapidly rising production costs.
 Role of External Financing
 Caribbean countries have continued to rely heavily
 on external financing to keep their economies afloat
 during the recent downturn. The net inflow of
 direct investment, loans, and official grants has
 risen from $1.3 billion in 1977 to an estimated $1.5
 billion in 1980 (excluding the three French Over-

 seas Departments in the region). These resources,
 however, have fallen relative to external financing
 requirements: between 1977 and 1981 the sum of
 current account deficits and official debt amortiza-
 tion soared from $393 million to $1.8 billion. For
 1982 net resource flows are projected at slightly
 over $1.5 billion compared with financing require-
 ments of $2.0 billion.
 Grants and concessional loans provided 50 percent
 of total resource inflows in 1980, with 70 percent of
 this assistance coming from bilateral sources. The
 role of multilateral institutions in the external
 financing of Caribbean countries has been expand-
 ing. Between 1977 and 1981 loan approvals to the
 region by the Inter-American Development Bank
 rose from $90 million to $206 million, while ap-

 Barbados' real GDP fell 3 percent in 1981. Set-
 backs in the main economic sectors-sugar, other
 agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing-because
 of adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, and
 weak external demand were major factors. Official
 external debt more than doubled in 1981, reaching
 $164 million. Barbados has implemented tax relief
 to encourage further investment and continues to
 focus on export promotion to foster economic
 growth. The Central Bank has tightened credit
 conditions to help ease balance-of- payments and
 inflationary pressures. Tourism continues to falter
 and we expect zero real economic growth this year.
 Haiti's real GDP fell 2.1 percent in 1981. The
 plunge in economic activity was largely attribut-
 able to declines in coffee, sugar, and bauxite
 production. Earnings from coffee, Haiti's largest
 export, fell by two-thirds to $30 million. Although
 external debt in 1981 totaled $320 million, debt
 service was only $20 million because of Port-au-
 Prince's access to concessional loans. The Haitian
 Government continues to encourage export-orient-
 edfirms through various incentives. The slight
 economic pickup in the United States and the EC
 during second-half 1982 and more stringent con-
 trols on imports should hold the current account
 deficit to no more than last year's $116 million.
 However, the cost will be near zero real GDP
 growth this year.
 The Dominican Republic's rate of real GDP
 growth fell from 5.4 percent in 1980 to 3.4 percent
 in 1981 and will probably slow somewhat further
 this year. Unemployment currently exceeds 25
 percent. Exports this year are expected to be 30
 percent below the 1981 level while imports are
 projected to fall by 15 percent. The new govern-
 ment intends to liberalize foreign investment laws
 to attract badly needed foreign capital. The central
 bank is allowing interest rates to rise to encourage
 domestic saving.
 Jamaica managed a 1.5 percent increase in real
 GDP growth in 1981 after seven years of decline,
 but external debt rose to $1.4 billion by yearend.
 Foreign exchange earnings are being hurt by falling
 sugar production and slow bauxite export growth.
 Tourism is beginning to pick up but is still below
 1979 levels. Economic policies to cope with the
 current account deficit center around increased
 allocations of foreign exchange for raw material
 imports for industry and a renewed emphasis on
 export promotion. Nevertheless, we believe the
 current account deficit will widen to $550 million
 this year, with the economy registering just under
 2 -percent growth.
 Guyana's economy is in critical condition. Real
 output fell by 6 percent in 1981, putting real per
 capita income nearly 30 percent below the 1975
 level, while external debt rose to $635 million.
 Poor performance in the bauxite and sugar indus-
 tries have been a major reason for the worsening
 economy. In an effort to cope with deteriorating
 economic conditions, authorities have been laying
 off public-sector employees and trying to improve
 government efficiency. The government has in-
 creased consumption taxes and raised interest
 rates to encourage saving. To spur export activity,
 Guyana is allowing more private-sector indepen-
 dence in manufacturing and agriculture. Even so,
 real GDP will probably decline another 10 percent
 this year.
 Among the other Caribbean countries, only St.
 Vincent-with a 9-percent increase in real GDP-
 avoided a growth slowdown in 1981. Even Trini-
 dad and Tobago witnessed a plunge in growth
 despite its profitable oil industry that was largely
 responsible for the country's $300 million current
 account surplus. Economic policy in most of these
 countries has been directed toward monetary and
 fiscal restraint in an effort to bring current account
 and budget deficits under control.

 performance of the combined Caribbean current

 for the region in 1983. Bilateral and multilateral
 economic assistance will continue to bear the brunt

 China: The Economy at Midyear
 I
 Beijing is still struggling to restrain industrial
 growth, particularly in heavy industry. We believe
 the government reorganization has disrupted nor-
 mal channels of economic control and communica-
 tion, making implementation of this year's plan
 particularly difficult. Efforts to get managers to
 focus on energy conservation and improvements in
 quality and productivity have met with little suc-
 cess
 Heavy Industry's Unplanned Surge
 Beijing is particularly concerned about the pickup
 in heavy industry, which is outpacing light industry
 and sidetracking "readjustment" policies. Heavy
 industry's rapid growth for four successive quarters
 has raised production to a new record level, 10.7
 percent above the low point of a year ago. The
 unforeseen boom in heavy industry, where growth
 of only 1 percent was planned for 1982, has caused
 energy shortages in key industrial centers in east
 and northeast China. Energy production, especially
 coal, grew rapidly in the first six months, but failed
 to keep up with heavy industry's growth. As a
 result, the State Council in May issued new regula-
 tions restricting the output of energy-intensive fac-
 tories and tightening control over electricity alloca-
 tion.
 The need to curb industrial energy consumption-
 which was planned to drop by 3 percent this year-
 was a major theme of a July speech by Zhang
 Jingfu, head of the State Economic Commission, to
 a national industry conference in Beijing. Referring
 to strains in the energy supply system, Zhang
 reported that "electricity was overgenerated, the
 volume of rail freight was excessive, and coal stored
 in many localities was used up."
 Zhang and Premier Zhao Ziyang, who also ad-
 dressed the conference, emphasized that too-rapid
 growth hinders efforts to improve efficiency, a
 point Beijing has made repeatedly in recent
 months. Production costs in state enterprises were
 down by 0.2 percent in the first five months, falling
 short of the planned cut of 1 to 2 percent. Both
 Zhang and Zhao restated Beijing's threat that
 enterprises not meeting energy consumption and   25X1
 productivity targets will be closed.
 Light Industry Curtailed
 Light industrial production has declined from the
 peaks of late 1981, but production in the second
 quarter was still 6.8 percent above the year-earlier
 level-high enough that the 7-percent growth tar-
 get for 1982 remains within reach. Part of the
 recent decline is due to the fact that some local
 authorities are using for heavy industry materials,
 energy, and transport that had been earmarked for
 light industry. The decline in overall light industri-
 al production also has occurred in part as a re-
 sponse to large inventory buildups. Although retail
 sales rose 9.2 percent in the first five months,
 inventories of unwanted goods continued to rise in
 the first six months, as consumers in both urban
 and rural areas became more selective in their    25X1
 purchases. In March the State Council ordered
 cutbacks in the production of consumer durables
 outside the plan. The cuts were aimed specifically
 at new producers turning out poor quality goods.
 The conservative policies of the past year remain in
 effect in the foreign sector. We estimate that    25X1

 imports in the first six months were cut by 15.4
 percent from last year's pace, while exports were up
 by 11.9 percent. The growing trade surplus has
 been used to push foreign exchange reserves up to
 record levels and to reduce debt; China's debt
 service ratio has dropped to about 5 percent.
 Grain imports, however, are running ahead of last
 year, reflecting low prices. More than one-half are
 still coming from the United States. In May,
 Canada announced a new three-year agreement to
 supply China with 3.5-4.2 million tons of grain per
 year.
 Of the 45 foreign oil companies that participated in
 seismic surveys,.33 submitted bids on 17 August
 for offshore oil exploration. More negotiations will
 be needed before contracts are signed. Some com-
 panies did not submit bids because of concern that
 Chinese taxes and Beijing's share of crude oil
 output will be too high to allow adequate profits,
 and that requirements for technology transfer are
 excessive.
 Secret

 Agriculture
 The 1982 summer grain harvest was about equal to
 last year's. Major fall crops are doing well, and we
 expect production to remain at or slightly above
 last year's level. Grain output will approach, but
 probably will not attain, the target level of 333.5
 million tons
 The Budget and Capital Spending
 Beijing managed to post a budget surplus in the
 first half, aided by the larger-than-expected reve-
 nues from heavy industry. Zhang Jingfu, neverthe-
 less, expressed concern that the deficits that ap-
 peared in May and June portend fiscal difficulties
 for the second half. These deficits probably were
 caused by a combination of declining revenues in
 other sectors and rising expenditures for capital
 construction.
 Despite attempts to restrain investment spending,
 outlays for capital construction were up 30 percent.
 Data for the first four months show off-budget
 investment running 70 percent ahead of last year,
 in contrast to the 8-percent budgeted increase
 The unplanned surge in heavy industry and invest-
 ment serves as a reminder that Beijing's policies
 still encounter resistance, especially at the local
 level. Beijing repeatedly has called for slower
 growth to allow plant managers to focus on improv-
 ing productivity and quality, but lower level offi-
 cials and managers continue to resist. Rapid
 growth remains a major objective, especially since
 profits and bonuses of the enterprises they manage
 remain closely linked to output.
 Controversy over economic problems may become
 increasingly apparent at the 12th Party Congress
 and the National People's Congress later this year.

 The Chinese press has also been full of "plan versus
 market" discussions. We believe opponents of Vice
 Chairman Deng Xiaoping are attempting to dis-
 credit his leadership by citing problems with the
 market-type reforms introduced over the past three
 years. This issue, as well as the campaigns now
 under way in China to combat foreign influence,
 the anticorruption drive, and politicking related to
 the upcoming congresses could affect the overall
 economic climate
 25X1
 Outlook for 1982
 The energy situation and Beijing's continuing ef-
 forts to improve efficiency will dominate the eco-
 nomic picture for the rest of the year. Heavy
 industrial growth will be slowed by the energy
 crunch, but the growth targets set forth in the 1982
 plan will probably be met or surpassed by the end
 of the year. We believe the central authorities'
 efficiency goals will not be met, however, because
 managers are still concentrating mainly on raising
 output. Budget constraints and continued shortages
 of many consumer goods will prevent much of an
 increase in living standards. If Beijing is unable to
 restrain production in heavy industry, consumer
 goods output may decline, further complicating the
 effort to raise living standards.F          __1                                       25X1
 Beijing will begin to restrain export growth and
 step up imports, especially of industrial supplies.
 Nevertheless, we estimate this year's trade surplus
 will reach a record $5 billion. Proceeds from the
 surplus will be used to reduce debt and increase
 foreign exchange reserves. Beijing is also likely to
 use more of its foreign exchange earnings for
 capital imports and investment abroad, especially                                     25X1
 in Hong Kong.
