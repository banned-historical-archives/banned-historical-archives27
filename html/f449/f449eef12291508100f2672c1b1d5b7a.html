 LEBANON: BACK TO THE BRINK
 Heavy fighting resumed in Beirut this week as
 Lebanese leftists attempted to undermine a
 Syrian-sponsored political compromise that
 would in effect tie the orderly resignation of
 President Franjiyah to the selection of his
 successor. Rapidly increasing military pressure on
 the Christians forced Franjiyah to flee the
 presidential palace for the Christian village of
 Juniyah on March 25, and raised the possibility
 that he might finally be forced to resign or that
 the Christians might announce a plan for par-
 titioning the country. The tendency of both sides
 to seek drastic solutions in turn raised new
 problems for the Syrians, whose mediation effort
 has bogged down, but who are reluctant to risk an
 Israeli reaction by introducing large numbers of
 Syrian regular forces into Lebanon.
 Damascus has already sent between 2,000 and
 3,000 Syrian regulars into the country to help
 restrain the leftists. These forces have cooperated
 with-and in some cases been integrated in-
 to-units of the 5,000-man Palestine Liberation
 Army and the 3,000-man Saiga fedayeen group.
 The  two  Syrian-controlled  Palestinian
 organizations have moved virtually all their forces
 into Lebanon. Syrian regulars are known to be
 based in Ayn Sawfar, Khaldah, and western Beirut.
 They have restrained some leftist units in these
 areas, but have failed to prevent the leftists from
 seizing control of most of Beirut's hotel and com-
 mercial district and from mounting strong attacks
 on the port area, the Christian district of
 Ashrafiyah, and the presidential palace at Babda.
 The leftists' success has resulted from the for-
 mation of an uneasy alliance among the followers
 of Socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt, Muslim radical
 Ibrahim Qulaylat, and rebel army Lieutenant
 Ahmad Khatib. This coalition is being supported
 by fedayeen rejectionists and, to a lesser extent,
 by Fatah leader Yasir Arafat.
 Fatah and other independent fedayeen
 groups are motivated primarily by a desire to
 protect themselves against the growing Syrian in-
 fluence in Lebanon, and by a conviction that they
 cannot afford to have remained on the sidelines if

 the Lebanese leftist and Muslim forces come out
 on top. Arafat is not believed to be seeking direct
 confrontation with Syrian troops or with the
 Syrian-controlled Palestinian troops, although his
 actions are serving to reinforce the reluctance of
 the Lebanese left to cooperate with the Syrian
 peace initiative.
 The leftists fear that a negotiated settlement
 would only strengthen Syria's hand in Lebanon
 and result in the election of a strong Maronite
 Christian president sympathetic to Syrian and
 conservative Christian interests. Franjiyah's im-
 mediate and unconditional resignation, the lef-
 tists believe, would result in extended political
 negotiations and in the ultimate election of a
 weak Christian president less inclined or able to
 control the left. Jumblatt is now in a strong
 negotiating position; although he cannot
 decisively defeat the Christian forces, he can pre-
 vent implementation of a new cease-fire unless
 Damascus sends in still more Syrian regulars.
 The continued defiance of Jumblatt and
 other Lebanese leftists is creating more problems
 for Syrian President Asad at home as well as in
 Lebanon. There have been a number of in-
 dications this week that Asad's cautious, relatively
 evenhanded approach to the Lebanese problem
 is encountering opposition within the Syrian
 military. Many in the military apparently regard
 his efforts to ensure an orderly succession to the
 Lebanese presidency as an attempt to shore up
 the Christians at the expense of Syria's traditional
 Muslim and leftist allies. As more Syrian regulars
 have been pressed into service in Lebanon, the
 military probably has also begun to worry about
 being drawn deeper into the mess or, even worse,
 getting into an unwanted conflict with the Israelis.
 Asad reportedly has taken some steps to muf-
 fle critics of his Lebanon policy in the army and
 has tightened security to guard against a coup or
 assassination attempt. Thus far, dissension within
 the Syrian military does not appear to have reach-
 ed the stage where it threatens Asad, who still
 retains formidable military forces at his disposal
 and is adept at outmaneuvering his opponents. At
 the minimum, however, military dissatisfaction is
 likely to further complicate his efforts to put
 pressure on the Lebanese leftists to accept a
 cease-fire.
 Despite the political and military risks in-
 volved, the Asad regime appeared to be taking
 some military actions this week that could por-
 tend the introduction of Syrian regulars on a large
 scale.

 unusual Syrian troop movements in the
 Damascus area, where Syria's two armored
 divisions are normally stationed.
 While some of the military activity may have
 been normal training, it may also be a signal that
 the Syrians are preparing for some form of
 military action. If Damascus decides to intervene
 further, it could do so with any one of its five
 regular divisions. Damascus also could put
 together a task force of units taken from several
 divisions, and thereby lessen the impact on Syrian
 defenses along the Golan Heights opposite Israel.
 Another possible option would be to use the
 "defense" companies that are responsible for the
 protection of the government, and which are
 organized and equipped along regular military
 lines.
 The Israelis acknowledged privately for the
 first time this week that Syrian regular forces have
 entered Lebanon, although they have not charg-
 ed that the Syrians are in border areas near Israel.
 Defense Minister Peres said in January that Israel's
 reaction to a Syrian move into Lebanon would de-
 pend on the security situation along the border.
 Israeli troops near the border have been on in-
 creased alert for several weeks, but no unusual
 military activities have been detected recently.

 ISRAEL: WEST BANK CALMER
 The violent demonstrations by Arab students
 in the Israeli-occupied West Bank appear to be
 subsiding in the wake of a March 21 Israeli
 Supreme Court decision upholding police
 authority to prevent Jewish prayer services on
 Jerusalem's Temple Mount, the site of one of
 Islam's holiest shrines. Tensions remain high,
 however, and the outcome of a special UN
 Security Council debate this week on the West
 Bank situation could lead to a new round of
 rioting.
 Although minor disturbances continue in
 several West Bank towns, relative calm seems to
 be returning to the area. On March 22, a leading
 West Bank moderate, Hebron Mayor Mohammed
 al-Jabari, retracted the resignation he tendered
 last week to protest Israeli brutality in putting
 down riots in his town. Israeli army units have
 been withdrawn from Hebron to give Jabari a
 chance to restore order. Israeli occupation
 authorities have also ended the curfews on Halhul
 near Bethlehem, Ram Allah, and al-Birah.
 So far eight municipal councils that had also
 resigned have refused to follow Jabari's example.
 The Israelis-for whom the cooperation of local
 authorities in re-establishing order is politically
 important-have rejected the resignations and
 are pressing Arab leaders to reconsider their ac-
 tions. If new anti-Israeli demonstrations occur,
 more town governments-there are 24 in the
 territory-will probably resign.
 The fact that West Bank municipal elections
 are scheduled for April 12 complicates the posi-
 tion of local Arab officials, who fear they will lose
 Palestinian votes by cooperating with the Israelis
 to maintain order. Despite the recent distur-
 bances, Israeli authorities intend to go ahead with
 the elections. If they were postponed, unrest in
 the West Bank could increase and the Palestine
 Liberation Organization, already popular among
 the Palestinians, would no doubt gain additional
 support.
 agreed to participate even though the PLO was
 also invited, resulting in the first confrontation
 between the two parties in the council. Foreign
 Minister Allon explained that Israel wished to
 counter expected PLO propaganda against Israel's
 occupation of the West Bank. Israel's participa-
 tion, he emphasized, should not be regarded as
 any kind of precedent indicating its recognition
 of the PLO as a party to Middle East peace
 negotiations. The UN debate may touch off new
 demonstrations in the West Bank by Arabs anx-
 ious to show their support for the PLO.
 Leaders of Israel's ruling Labor Alignment are
 divided in their assessment of the disorders. Some
 moderates, like ex-foreign minister Eban, blame
 right-wing Jewish extremists, rather than the
 Arabs, for sparking much of the unrest in the
 West Bank. They criticize the government for not
 taking strong initiatives to appease the
 Palestinians.
 Hard liners, on the other hand, blame the
 current disorders on a politically active minority
 determined to provoke trouble. They want the
 government to act as forcefully as necessary to
 quell the demonstrations, and they criticize it for
 not moving more quickly and energetically
 against the rioters.
 Within the Alignment and the broader
 government coalition, there is also disagreement
 over the government's handling of an attempt last
 December by a right-wing Israeli group to es-
 tablish a Jewish settlement illegally at Sebastia in
 the West Bank. Arab demonstrators have
 repeatedly demanded that the settlers, who were
 moved by the government to a nearby military
 camp pending a final decision on the matter, be
 removed from the territory. Leaders of the
 Alignment's left-wing Mapam faction have called
 on the government to comply with this demand.
 Labor Party conservatives, however, as well as the
 National Religious Party, a member of the-govern-
 ment coalition, demand that the Sebastia site be  25X1
 The UN Security Council began a debate on
 the West Bank disorders on March 22 in response
 to a request by Libya and Pakistan. The Israelis
 made a permanent Jewish settlement. A full
 cabinet debate on this matter has been post-
 poned until late April.

 IRAQ-SYRIA: PIPELINE DISPUTE
 Baghdad has threatened to stop selling its
 crude at export terminals in Banias, Syria, and
 Tripoli, Lebanon, following a stalemate in
 negotiations with Syria over pipeline transit fees.
 Iraq's oil earnings will be sharply reduced for
 at least several months if it follows through with
 its threat. The financial impact on the Iraqi
 economy would be minimal because of the coun-
 try's large foreign exchange holdings and surplus
 revenue position. The results could be serious,
 however, should Syria retaliate by curbing water
 flows on the Euphrates River.
 Iraq reportedly has advised its major
 customers to switch oil shipping operations to
 southern Iraqi ports in the Persian Gulf beginning
 on April 1. The previous three-year pipeline
 agreement with Syria and Lebanon, formulated in
 an era of cheap oil, expired last December.
 Iraq insists that there be little or no increase
 in the 46-cents-per-barrel royalty paid for crude
 crossing through Syria and Lebanon. Syria
 demands sharply increased transit fees, largely
 because of the higher oil income enjoyed by Iraq
 since oil prices began to skyrocket in late 1973.
 Iraq wants Syria and Lebanon to pay close to
 world market prices-$11.85 per barrel-for the
 estimated 50,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of Iraqi
 crude they take from the pipeline for domestic
 use. Syria has refused. Damascus and Beirut had
 been charged only $3.06 per barrel under the
 previous arrangement.
 Iraq is currently developing the capability to
 export crude through several other outlets. The
 key factor is a pipeline linking the northern fields,
 which traditionally export Kirkuk crude through
 the Mediterranean, with the southern fields,
 which normally ship Rumaila crude out of the
 Persian Gulf. The pipeline was completed last
 year, and when the pumping stations are com-
 pleted, probably later this year, southbound flows
 could reach a capacity of 1 million barrels per day.
 Until then, the pipeline can move no more than
 500,000 barrels per day southbound, about one
 half of current exports generally flowing to the
 Mediterranean.
 Baghdad stands to lose export revenue of
 $165 million per month. It would "save" an es-
 timated $20 million worth of crude per month in
 revenues considered lost as a result of under-
 payments for the crude taken by Syria and
 Lebanon. They, in turn, would be forced to buy
 from other sources about 80,000 barrels per day of
 previously discounted oil at commercial rates.
 Syria and Lebanon would also stand to lose an es-
 timated $14 million per month in transit fees.
 Baghdad could also opt to place roughly
 500,000 barrels per day of oil through Syria and
 maximize the flow of Kirkuk oil to the Persian
 Gulf. This would permit Iraq to meet its market-
 ing objectives, but there would be no way to
 prevent Syria from tapping into the pipeline for

 RHODESIA
 Negotiations Collapse
 The collapse last week of settlement talks
 between Rhodesian black nationalist leader
 Joshua Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith
 appears to leave Rhodesia's nationalists with no
 option but to pursue their goal of majority rule
 through military means. Nkomo, who had been
 meeting on and off with Smith in Salisbury since
 December, refused to continue the talks because
 the Rhodesian Prime Minister would not make a
 commitment to any definite time frame for a
 transfer of power to the black majority. Smith
 claimed his proposals to Nkomo were construc-
 tive; Nkomo told the press that they would have
 deferred majority rule for at least 10 years.
 Since the negotiations broke off, the African
 nations most directly involved in supporting the
 Rhodesian nationalists, as well as the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity, have issued statements urg-
 ing nationalist unity and calling for an intensifica-
 tion of the armed struggle against the Smith
 regime. The four African presidents who helped
 to arrange the talks-Kaunda of Zambia, Nyerere
 of Tanzania, Machel of Mozambique and Khama
 of Botswana-met in Lusaka this week to discuss
 the Rhodesian situation. Nkomo and his rivals
 from the external wing of the African National
 Council, who have been preparing for some time
 for an all-out military campaign, also attended the
 meeting.
 Although details of the meeting are not yet
 available, the participants almost certainly dis-
 cussed ways to strengthen the military effort
 against Smith. The African presidents may also
 have tried once again to arrange a reconciliation
 between Nkomo's faction and the external
 leaders in the interests of forging a unified libera-
 tion army. Machel and Nyerere have been taking
 the lead in working to strengthen the guerrillas
 whose cross border operations into Rhodesia
 from Mozambique have been growing since late
 January. The two presidents have had difficulty in
 working with the exiled politicians, however, and
 they have tried to develop new leaders from
 among the guerrillas.
 Kaunda had quietly encouraged Nkomo's
 negotiations with Smith but now appears ready to
 provide direct support to the insurgent effort. He
 reportedly has made contingency plans for the
 guerrillas to stage operations from Zambian soil.
 Although the exiled nationalists have publicly
 invited Nkomo to join their ranks, tribal and per-
 sonal rivalries among the various groups and
 leaders remain strong, and the a  not likely to
 work together effectively.
 For his part, Smith publicly stated that he in-
 tends to continue seeking a peaceful settlement.
 He appealed to Britain for help in arranging a
 settlement, but subsequently rejected Foreign
 Secretary Callaghan's terms for British involve-
 ment. Among the conditions laid down by
 Callaghan was a demand that the Rhodesian
 government commit itself unequivocally to
 accept majority rule and to hold elections within
 18 months to two years.
 Impact of Embargo
 Rhodesia probably will suffer only a tem-
 porary setback because of Mozambique's em-
 bargo on March 3, but the country's economic
 well-being will depend on rerouting a large por-
 tion of its foreign trade traffic through South
 Africa.
 At least 60 percent of Rhodesia's 5 million
 tons a year of exports and imports were passing
 through South Africa even before the Mozam-
 bique move. Most of these goods were carried
 over the direct Rhodesian - South African rail link.
 This was completed in June 1974 and upgraded in
 recent months to the point where it apparently
 can handle over 5 million tons annually.
 The South African transport net will be able
 to handle most of the diverted Rhodesian traffic.

 The 2-million-ton a year increase above current
 levels represents less than 2 percent of total
 freight moved by South African railroads. Because
 it is concentrated on one or two lines, however,
 the new traffic will have to be gradually absorbed
 into the South African rail system in order to
 avoid disrupting local traffic. We believe that this
 process can be accomplished in a few months by
 rearranging railroad schedules.
 Through emergency traffic realignment
 measures, South Africa could handle all Rhode-
 sian goods almost immediately. Pretoria is likely,
 however, to opt for a more gradual, less con-
 spicuous absorption of Rhodesian traffic. It is
 openly sensitive to its growing isolation in
 black-ruled Africa and is clearly unwilling to
 become the sole obstacle to the goal of ending
 white rule in Rhodesia.
 The delays in transport because of the restric-
 tions will temporarily depress Rhodesia's healthy
 economic growth. Export earnings, mainly from
 agriculture, mining, and mineral processing, ac-
 count for about 25 percent of gross domestic
 product. These receipts will fall as a result of the
 embargo, and political uncertainty will again slow
 foreign lending and investing.
 Rhodesia will not want to use much of its
 large inventories of oil and other key imports.
 Tighter import rationing appears certain. Since
 the embargo, fuel supplies to both industrial and
 private consumers already have been cut by 20
 percent under a previously established rationing
 system. Cuts will probably have to be made in im-
 ports of components for consumer industries
 such as automobile manufacturing.
 Mozambique, if it does not receive substan-
 tial aid inflows, may suffer more from the closure
 than Rhodesia. Mozambique will lose an es-
 timated $30 to $40 million annually from Rhode-
 sian port and rail fees, and possibly as much more
 if migrant laborers in Rhodesia are forced to
 return home. Together, the losses equal about 10
 to 15 percent of total foreign exchange income.
 Job losses will be most severe in the port of
 Beira. Rhodesian trade as well as traffic that tran-
 sited Rhodesia to and from Botswana and Malawi
 accounted for more than two thirds of the port's
 volume. Maputo will be less affected. Only one
 quarter of its traffic moved via Rhodesia. For
 Mozambique as a whole, unemployment of rail
 and port workers and of workers on jobs depen-
 dent on transport activities will run in the
 thousands. Mozambique will also face temporary
 food shortages. It traditionally has imported corn,
 beef, and poultry from Rhodesia. Several months
 will be needed to shift to other suppliers.
 Botswana and Malawi will also be adversely
 affected until adjustments can be made in traffic
 patterns. Botswana had been shipping copper and
 nickel, its most important exports, across
 Rhodesia to Mozambique ports. It will now have
 to compete for cargo space on the South African
 transport network.
 South Africa and Rhodesia have been
 Malawi's major sources of imports, together
 supplying more than one third of the total. Fer-
 tilizer, machinery and equipment, coal, and food
 have been the major imports. Almost all were
 shipped via Rhodesia to Beira and transferred to
 the north-bound railroad to Malawi.

 EC: LUXEMBOURG SUMMIT
 The meeting of EC leaders in Luxembourg
 next week has acquired particular importance
 because the heads of government were to hold
 their first formal exchange on recent proposals to
 foster "European Union" and to approve a con-
 vention establishing procedures for direct elec-
 tions to the European Parliament in 1978. Several
 developments have now cast a shadow over the
 summit, however, making it certain that the
 leaders will have to work harder than ever to
 produce solid accomplishments.
 The European Council will meet April 1-2 fac-
 ed with intensified political turmoil and economic
 uncertainty in Italy; new monetary instability
 among the Nine, symbolized by France's
 withdrawal from the joint currency float;
 domestic pressures on President Giscard d'Estaing
 that will limit his flexibility; and a lame-duck, or
 new, British prime minister.
 Economic issues were already assured of an
 airing at the summit by London's inscription on
 the agenda of possible community-wide ap-
 proaches to the unemployment problem, but
 Giscard-beset with opposition at home to some
 of his European ideas-has now asked for top bill-
 ing for the EC's economic and monetary situation.
 There seem in fact to be no specific proposals for
 dealing with the economic difficulties. Discussion
 of the problems could nevertheless shunt aside
 the critical longer term political issues unless the
 Germans, in particular, are prepared to link the
 prospect of greater community economic
 solidarity with the need for institutional progress.
 A go-ahead on direct elections to the Euro-
 pean Parliament, the intended major achieve-
 ment of the Luxembourg Council, was already
 threatened by a dispute between France and its
 partners over how to allocate seats among the EC
 members. Paris wants a formula that would ac-
 curately reflect the relative populations of the
 Nine; France's partners are willing to skew the
 representation so that the smaller members are
 given a relatively greater voice. No compromises
 have been hinted so far in this controversy, and
 Gaullists and Communists in France have
 meanwhile been stepping up their campaign
 against French participation, which they see as an
 abandonment of national sovereignty. Giscard's
 possible disinclination to face up to this pressure
 may partially explain his desire to focus on
 economic issues at the summit. A failure of the
 summit to initial the draft convention would dim
 the prospects for elections two years hence and
 be a bad psychological blow to the unity effort.
 The maximum that the leaders are expected
 to come up with on European Union-the term
 used to describe the institutional, decision-
 making, and policy requirements of a fully func-
 tioning community-are guidelines for further
 elaboration of the ideas offered by Belgian Prime
 Minister Tindemans in the report commissioned
 by the Nine in 1974 and presented this January.
 Although Tindemans took a pragmatic approach
 to his mission, there is nevertheless controversy
 among the Nine-revolving principally around
 whether to give more, or less, authority to central
 EC bodies-and the leaders may not be able to
 give clear guidance to a working group. Without
 such guidance, a decision for "further study" risks
 being taken as tantamount to burying some of the
 EC's most pressing issues.
 The  most contentious suggestion of
 Tindemans-that common policies be im-
 plemented at different speeds depending on a
 member's economic ability-has become par-
 ticularly relevant because of the monetary tur-
 moil. France's withdrawal from the monetary
 "snake" has left it now on the outside of what, for
 Tindemans, was to serveas the basis of a two-level
 approach to integration. It seems unlikely that the
 Nine were prepared to endorse formally a
 differentiated system of policy implementation,
 even though the community may work this way
 often in practice. The so-called "two-tier" com-
 munity would appear even less likely of explicit
 acceptance now, since it would only confirm
 West Germany as the EC's linchpin.
 Discard has recently floated another concep-
 tion for assuring expeditious decision making-a
 "directorate" of three or four members,
 necessary in his view to cope with a community
 whose diversity will increase with the addition of
 new members, such as Greece and Spain.
 Although this idea has been received coolly by 25X1
 France's partners, Giscard may still want to raise in
 some form the problem of executive leadership
 within the community.

 USSR-EGYPT: THE AGGRIEVED PARTY
 UK: DECISION ON MRCA
 In Moscow, the media are still picking away
 at Egyptian President Sadat along the lines first
 outlined in the Tass statement a few days after the
 abrogation. Sadat is depicted as the villian of the
 piece, a man who who has sold out the Egyptian
 revolution and the Arab cause at the behest of the
 US. Since Sadat is also anti-Soviet, by implication
 the Soviet Union emerges as the champion of
 economic and social justice in Egypt and of the
 Arab struggle against "imperialism" and Israel.
 The Soviets have been careful to make clear
 that they want good relations with Egypt and are
 following their usual "principled policy" in work-
 ing toward that end. The message is that the USSR
 is the aggrieved party but will be reasonable if and
 when the Egyptians come around to a more
 realistic policy. By focusing their attack on the
 Egyptian President, the Soviets have moved closer
 than heretofore to saying publicly what they have
 been thinking privately for some time: that their
 main problem in Egypt is Sadat. Their argument
 that the person of Sadat is the principal impedi-
 ment to further progress in the region is, in effect,
 an open invitation to bring him down.
 If the Soviets themselves are doing anything
 more inside Egypt to topple Sadat, it has not yet
 become apparent. On the contrary, they have
 taken their latest humiliation at Sadat's hand with
 what passes for a Soviet stiff upper lip. Soviet em-
 bassy officers in Cairo have been spreading the
 word that economic relations will continue as
 before, that Moscow will not of its volition
 precipitately  withdraw  economic  or  military
 technicians, and even that discussions of new aid
 projects are going forward.
 These expressions of normality are probably
 not the last word from Moscow. The Soviets have
 been very tough on Sadat for over two years and
 are not likely to ease up now. Their problem is
 tactical and practical: where to squeeze and how
 Britain has decided to go ahead with produc-
 tion of both the air defense and recon-
 naissance-strike versions of the West European
 multirole combat aircraft. The decision will give a
 much-needed boost to Britain's defense industry,
 as well as encourage West Germany and
 Italy-co-producers of the aircraft with the
 UK-to stick with their plans to use the aircraft. It
 could also mark an important step in Europe's ef-
 fort to standardize at least part of its military
 equipment.
 According to Defense Minister Roy Mason,
 the UK will build its assigned quota of 385
 fighter-bombers, including 165 in the specialized
 air defense version. The program, which is ex-
 pected to cost Britain an estimated $4.5 billion
 over a 10-year period, will provide jobs for about
 24,000 British workers.
 London's decision to produce the air defense
 version will be especially encouraging to Bonn
 and Rome. The Germans reportedly had feared
 that cost overruns and the UK defense budget
 cuts might force the British to drop the more ex-
 pensive air defense model, jeopardizing the en-
 tire project. The multirole combat aircraft is
 Europe's most ambitious multinational weapons
 development program. If Italy and West Germany
 join Britain in filling their quotas, over 800 of the
 swing-wing aircraft will be produced.
 The testing program for the new aircraft is
 still behind schedule. Problems with the aircraft's
 Rolls-Royce engine and the crash last month of an
 Italian prototype have slowed the flight-test
 program. As a result, production is not expected
 to begin before next year.
 When the new fighter-bomber is ready, it is
 slated to replace large numbers of older aircraft in
 the Royal Air Force, including F-4 interceptors,
 Buccaneer fighter-bombers, and the Vulcan and
 Canberra bombers. Italy and West Germany plan
 to use the aircraft to replace many of their aging
 F-104 fighters.

 USSR: BUILDING ANOTHER TRANS-SIB
 Despite temperatures dipping to minus 70
 degrees fahrenheit, construction on. the second
 Trans-Siberian railroad-including the building of
 base camps, access roads, bridges, the clearing of
 right-of-way, and establishment of supply
 centers-has been moving-ahead this winter. The
 length and construction time for the
 Baykal-Amur-Magistral line is roughly twice that
 of the Alaska pipeline, built under comparable
 climate and terrain conditions.
 The Soviets are continuing to give the project
 high priority. They have maintained a rapid pace
 with no foreign technical assistance but are using
 substantial quantities of new construction equip-
 ment (trucks,, bulldozers, air compressors, and
 tunneling equipment) from the West. Without
 substantially more Western equipment, however,
 the project will probably not be able to sustain a
 rapid enough pace for completion by the target
 date of 1982.
 In 1975 at the western end of the BAM, near
 Ust-Kut, bridges were completed across the Lena
 and Tayura rivers and a-40-mile section of the line
 was put in operation. About 150 miles to the east,
 at Nizhneangarsk, near the northern tip of Lake
 Baykal, a village is now taking shape that will
 become a major transshipment center for
 supplies brought by ship from stations on the ex-
 isting Trans-Siberian Railroad at the southern end
 of the lake. Work has begun on the drilling of two
 tunnels, one west of Lake Baykal and
 another-nearly 10 miles long-about 170 miles
 to the east.
 More than 30 temporary camps have been es-
 tablished at approximately ten-mile intervals
 along the route of the BAM, and permanent
 villages are being set up at 30- to 60-mile intervals.
 Existing villages have been greatly enlarged to ac-
 commodate workers and their families and ac-
 tivities associated with the construction.
 Since the completion last year of the 115-mile
 branch  line connecting the Trans-Siberian
 Railroad with the BAM near its midpoint at Tyn-
 dinskiy, the latter has become a supply center for
 BAM construction operations in both directions
 as well as for the branch line being built toward
 the large Chulman coal deposits 100 miles to the
 north.
 At Shimanovsk, 250 miles southeast of Tyn-
 dinskiy on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, a plant to
 fabricate precast building components for
 bridges, industrial buildings, and housing is in
 operation. Similar centers are planned for several
 other locations. The village of Urgal, almost 500
 miles east of Tyndinskiy and some 200 miles west
 of the eastern terminus, will become a major
 railroad junction and construction supply center.
 Five- and ten-story housing blocks and
 twelve-story administrative offices are planned.
 The logistics of supplying the equipment,
 materials, and manpower when needed, con-
 sidering the remoteness of the area and the lack
 of transportation, will continue to be con-
 siderable. The most difficult problem may be in-
 centives to attract qualified workers and
 specialists to the job as well as living conditions
 adequate to maintain morale. It may be necessary
 to furnish perquisites and bonuses in excess of
 those now provided for workers in so-called Far
 Northern areas.
 The completion of the-BAM will enhance the
 Soviet economic and strategic potential by:
 ?  Providing access to huge deposits of
 coal, iron ore, natural gas, oil, and timber.
 ?  Alleviating the traffic congestion on
 the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
 ?  Providing an alternate supply line
 several hundred miles north of the existing
 railroad in the event of future hostilities in
 the far East.

 ITALY: CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS' DIFFERENCES
 The Italian Christian Democrats' national
 congress, at which deep divisions in the party
 were laid bare, ended this week on a note of un-
 certainty.
 The decision to elect the party leader at the
 congress, rather than permit faction chiefs to
 choose one behind closed doors as in the past,
 served to accentuate divisions instead of resolving
 them. The vote showed the delegates split almost
 evenly into two groups. Incumbent party leader
 Zaccagnini was narrowly re-elected by a coalition
 drawn largely from the left-of-center fac-
 tions-51.5 percent of the delegates-while the
 rest of the delegates, mainly center-right in orien-
 tation, supported Defense Minister Forlani, even
 though he had officially withdrawn from the race.
 The differences between the two groups flow
 mainly from their positions on the question of
 relations with the Communist opposition. Zac-
 cagnini supporters generally see continued con-
 frontation with the Communist Party as a counter-
 productive strategy. They want to open a dialogue
 with the Communists that would cast the
 differences between the two parties more in
 terms of issues than ideology and possibly lead to
 compromises on major questions.  Those who
 backed Forlani argue that such a policy would
 amount to a softening of the Christian Democrats'
 traditional opposition to the Communists and
 would ultimately make it more difficult to keep
 them out of the national government.
 The narrowness of Zaccagnini's victory means
 that he will probably have trouble implementing
 his policy toward the Communists. Zaccagnini's
 majority in the Christian Democratic national
 council-the party's chief deliberative body-is
 slimmer than that of any recent party leader, and
 he will almost certainly have to make substantial
 concessions to the center-right group that op-
 posed him.
 Meanwhile, the Christian Democrats are un-
 der pressure to decide whether to continue the
 one party minority government of Prime Minister
 Moro. Lack of confidence in Moro's stop-gap
 oc
 Zaccagnini
 solution has hindered efforts to halt the deprecia-
 tion of the lira.  The Christian Democrats,
 moreover, are reluctant to continue as the only
 governing party in the midst of the country's
 worst postwar recession.
 The Christian Democrats at their congress
 emphasized the party's desire for another alliance
 with the Socialists, but the Socialists earlier this
 month ruled out returning to government before
 the next parliamentary election. Unless the
 Socialists back down-which seems un-
 likely-pressures will increase for an election this
 summer or fall rather than in May 1977, as
 presently scheduled.
 Zaccagnini reportedly believes the Christian
 Democrats are ill-prepared to face the electorate
 now and is searching for some way to hold off an
 election. He seems attracted to Republican Party
 leader La Malfa's proposal for a new emergency
 economic program, which would enable the

 Christian Democrats to share the burden of Italy's
 economic problems. La Malfa suggests that the
 Moro government draw up new economic
 measures in consultation with all parties except
 the neo-fascists. His proposal has reportedly been
 endorsed by the Communists, and many
 Socialists, Social  Democrats, and Christian
 Democrats appear open to the idea.
 The chief obstacle to the emergency formula
 appears to be the reservations of Zaccagnini's
 center-right opponents in the Christian
 Democratic party who see it as a variation of his
 proposed dialogue with the Communists.
 SPAIN: OPPOSITION FRONT
 Spanish opposition groups are putting the
 finishing touches on an agreement for a united
 front that is likely to increase pressure on the
 government and further polarize the political
 forces in Spain.
 The agreement in principle to unite the two
 major opposition coalitions-the Communist-
 dominated Democratic Junta and the Socialist-led
 Platform  of Democratic Convergence-was
 reached on March 17. Attempts to set up an
 organizational structure for the new front, which
 may be called the Democratic Coordinating
 Group or the Republican Convention, could still
 dissolve into renewed wrangling, but the odds
 seem to have shifted in favor of a successful
 merger.
 Differences that had blocked earlier efforts to
 form a united front were reportedly resolved
 when the Communists suddenly reversed
 themselves on several crucial issues. An executive
 committee member of the Socialist Workers Party
 told the US embassy that the Communists had:
 ?  Abandoned their insistence on the
 immediate need for a "provisional
 government" of all opposition forces.
 ?  Agreed to the stipulation that the
 merger would be temporary in nature, ex-,.
 tending only until "democracy" is restored,
 and would not constitute an electoral
 alliance.
 ?  Given up their insistence that
 various Communist-manipulated individuals
 and front groups be represented on the
 governing body of the new organization.
 In spite of these concessions, a successful
 merger would achieve the Communists' primary
 near-term goal of avoiding isolation at a time
 when most of the other leftist parties are about to
 become legal under the government's new
 legislative proposals. The front would also mark
 the first alliance between Communists and the
 mainstream of the Spanish Socialist movement in
 almost 40 years, implying that the Communists
 have finally overcome the bitter legacy of the
 Civil War.
 The apparent willingness of Socialist and
 Christian Democratic groups to form a tactical
 alliance with the Communists seems to reflect
 growing disappointment and pessimism about the
 pace and extent of the government's reform
 program. The democratic parties hope that a
 united front will eventually force the government
 to pay heed to opposition demands.
 Other leftist forces are also attempting to
 accelerate the pace of liberalization. A self-
 proclaimed spokesman for the clandestine
 Military Democratic Union announced on March
 23 that his group had set a deadline of May 8, by
 which time the government had to carry out
 effective democratization. If significant progress
 had not been achieved by that date, he claimed
 the army would "take charge" and turn over the
 power to a provisional government of liberalizers.
 This would represent a significant change in the
 orientation of the Military Democratic Union,
 which has not hitherto advocated military in-
 tervention in the political arena.
 The group is believed to number only 300-400
 officers-far short of the backing necessary for a

 successful coup, since the bulk of the army is con-
 servative and loyal to the monarchy. More likely,
 the statement was part of a campaign to increase
 pressure on the government to liberalize.
 These efforts by the opposition to force the
 government to carry out its planned reforms
 could encourage the right to dig in its heels and
 form a similar broad alliance to oppose change.
 The resulting polarization of the country's
 political forces would seriously jeopardize the
 government's  liberalization  program.
 GREECE-TURKEY: AEGEAN CONTROVERSY
 The opening of the Law of the Sea
 Conference in New York last week prompted
 political leaders and the press in both Greece and
 Turkey to focus attention on their controversy
 over control of the Aegean Sea. Concerned that
 Turkey's interests may be ignored at the con-
 ference, and pressed by its political opponents,
 Prime Minister Demirel's weak coalition govern-
 ment staked out a tough position that created un-
 easiness in Athens and may limit Ankara's room
 for maneuver.
 As part of a continuing effort to undermine
 the Demirel government, Turkish opposition
 leader Ecevit recently launched a steady barrage
 of attacks on the government's handling of the
 Aegean issue, labeling its policy "cowardly" and
 "incomprehensibly negligent." Pointing to his
 own record as head of the government in 1974,
 when he dispatched a ship to explore for oil in the
 disputed waters, Ecevit has challenged Demirel to
 follow suit. Ecevit also criticized the government
 for not getting Greece to agree to settle the dis-
 pute in bilateral talks before the start of the New
 York meeting. According to Ecevit, this was a
 blunder that could adversely affect Turkey's case
 at the conference. Convinced that it has a strong
 legal case, Athens prefers that the issue be settled
 by the International Court of Justice.
 To counter Ecevit's charges and maintain
 pressure on the Greeks to consent to bilateral
 talks, Ankara acknowledged in late February that
 a ship was being outfitted to begin seismic
 research in the Aegean by late spring. A short
 time later, the government was forced to disavow
 a particularly provocative statement by the
 Turkish energy minister that seismic exploration
 would be followed by test drilling near the Greek
 oil find in the northern Aegean. A series of
 military exercises has been held in the Aegean
 this month, however, to underscore Turkish
 claims.
 At the same time, Demirel and other coali-
 tion party leaders declared that Turkey will refuse
 to recognize any agreements made at the New
 York meeting unless exceptions are made for the
 "special circumstances" in the Aegean. Ankara is
 particularly concerned that the principle of a 12-
 mile territorial sea will be approved by the con-
 ference even though Athens appears unlikely to
 adopt the new limits. The Turks are worried that
 their access to the Aegean would be severely
 restricted because of the proximity of Greece's
 eastern Aegean islands to the Turkish coast.
 Turkish Foreign Minister Caglayangil warned that
 Turkey could not tolerate such a situation.
 The increase in Turkish military exercises in
 the area and the growing preoccupation of
 politicians with the Aegean issue drew some
 sharp and equally belligerent replies from Greek
 opposition leaders and a portion of the press. The
 Caramanlis government, however, which is in a
 much stronger political position than its Turkish
 counterpart, has thus far exercised restraint and
 appears to have prevailed on some opposition
 politicians and press to follow suit.
 Athens did issue a demarche to the US last
 week conveying its growing concern about
 Turkish intentions in the Aegean. The Greeks
 probably prefer to await the results of the New
 York meeting before deciding on how far they
 will go toward meeting the Turkish demand for
 bilateral negotiations.

 CHINA
 Teng Hangs In
 The campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping, now
 nearly two months old, continues to hold out the
 possibility for him to redeem himself by admitting
 his mistakes. Chinese officials have frequently
 mentioned this option in discussions with
 foreigners, presumably to give the outside world
 an impression of patience and reasonableness
 amid the signs of political uncertainty; the same
 theme has periodically surfaced within China.
 This offer not only gives Teng a way out of his dif-
 ficulties, it also gives his opponents an opportuni-
 ty to save face should their efforts to send him
 into disgrace fail. Recent articles in the media in-
 dicate that Teng's opponents recognize they have
 chosen a formidable adversary.
 An article in the March 21 issue of People's
 Daily, although no less critical of Teng than earlier
 material, ends with the statement that "people
 are watching" Teng to see whether he will change
 his ways and "truly repent."
 Whatever his current status, the People's Dai-
 ly article stated that Teng "holds a high position
 and certain power" and it expressed concern that
 he could use this power in the interests of himself
 and his supporters. The party theoretical journal
 Red Flag also suggested that Teng and his
 followers are putting up a struggle, noting that
 after their first major setback-presumably when
 Teng was blocked from the premiership-they
 have fought back "ten times as hard."
 People's Daily struck a somewhat defensive
 note when it stated that the campaign against
 Teng was "necessary" and was winning "great
 Teng Hsiao-ping
 25X1
 25X1
 popularity." Although the campaign undoubtedly
 is popular among those who came to power dur-
 ing the Cultural Revolution but who have since
 lost their jobs to veteran officials, response to the
 campaign has been at best mixed. Some areas are
 pursuing it with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm,
 but others seem to be promoting it more
 vigorously. The recent appearance of some
 provincial officials who, like Teng, were stripped
 of power during the Cultural Revolution and sub-
 sequently reinstated, indicates the campaign has
 not "broadened" in the way its originators may
 have hoped.
 Minerals and Metals Trade
 China's imports of minerals and metals reach-
 ed nearly $1.9 billion in 1974, while exports total-
 ed less than $290 million. China has abundant
 resources of many important minerals including
 those that it imports and those in, which trade is
 now minimal. Several factors account for the ap-
 parent inconsistency between resource availabili-
 ty and production. Among them are:

 ?  World demand, especially for many
 of the nonmetallic minerals, is so low that
 the Chinese would have difficulty selling
 large amounts at a profit.
 ?  Costs of development are
 prohibitively high in some cases because of
 location, quality, or inadequate domestic
 technology.
 China's huge resources of tungsten, tin, mer-
 cury, and antimony, for example, are located in
 South and Southwest China, where difficult
 terrain and high transportation costs would make
 further development costly. There is some
 evidence that many of the best deposits are ex-
 hausted, and increases in output would require
 costly exploitation of poorer deposits.
 China has not taken advantage of its large
 deposits of manganese, molybdenum, fluorspar,
 and zinc to develop a substantial export surplus,
 largely because of low world demand. Fluorspar
 and metal ores are high-bulk items, and overseas
 sales are limited to nearby countries because of
 high transport costs. Moreover, some imports of
 technology probably would be required to
 produce the lower bulk metals.
 In order to utilize China's huge resources of
 low-quality bauxite, a special technology was
 developed with the help of the USSR. The
 technology requires exceptionally large amounts
 of electricity and therefore is expensive. Most of
 China's abundant iron ore resources also are of
 low quality.
 Although China exerts relatively little impact
 on the world market, minerals and metals repre-
 sent a major component of total Chinese foreign
 trade. They accounted for about 15 percent in
 1974-only 4 percent of exports but nearly 25 per-
 cent of imports. Minerals and metals form an in-
 creasingly significant part of China's total trade
 averaging 15 to 20 percent of the annual total in
 1970-74 compared with about 10 percent in 1965.
 In several years-1970, 1971, and 1973-minerals
 and metals composed more than 30 percent of
 total imports. This proportion fell in 1974 as China
 strained to reduce the large trade deficit brought
 about by increases in imports of machinery and
 agricultural commodities.
 Generally, China's trade in minerals and
 metals has little impact on other countries.
 Among China's major imports, finished steel ac-
 counted for only 3 percent of world-wide exports.
 Steel exports to China from the two major
 sources-Japan and West Germany-accounted
 for 9 percent and 2 percent respectively, of their
 total sales in 1974. In copper, China's share of ex-
 ports from such major producers as Chile, Peru,
 and Zambia was 10 percent, 15 percent, and 2 per-
 cent, respectively. A huge jump in aluminum im-
 ports in 1975 to perhaps 10 percent of world ex-
 ports has had little impact on the glutted world
 market.
 China's exports of tin, tungsten, and an-
 timony are of some consequence. Recent in-
 creases in Chinese tin sales have been of par-
 ticular concern to Malaysia and other Inter-
 national Tin Council members. Tin producers
 have been trying to hold down production and
 exports to keep prices up. Because China is the
 worlds largest exporter of tungsten and one of the
 three leading exporters of antimony, changes in
 Chinese sales of these commodities have a signifi-
 cant impact on world prices.
 China is making strong efforts to reduce its
 dependence on imported metals. Domestic de-
 mand, however, is rising rapidly and investment
 in the development of minerals and metal
 resources continues to lag. In some cases-par-
 ticularly copper-importing is less expensive than
 expanding domestic output. Thus, China has
 found it more lucrative to develop petroleum
 resources than minerals and metals to increase its
 foreign  exchange  earnings. The  petroleum
 resources are relatively accessible and a ready
 market is available, especially in nearby Japan, to
 absorb sizable surpluses of high-priced
 petroleum.
 China's efforts to increase exports will be
 constrained over the next several years by
 problems in developing new supplies and by
 weak demand for many minerals and metals.
 Moreover, most of its exports are similar to those
 of other developing nations, and Peking has voic-
 ed support for Third World efforts to raise export
 prices by limiting supplies through cartel
 arrangements

 ARGENTINA: JUNTA TAKES OVER
 The new military junta is firmly in place and
 giving the impression that it intends to retain
 power for some time. Former President Peron,
 her secretary and adviser Julio Gonzalez, and
 several Peronist leaders remain in military
 custody. There have been reports that she will be
 tried on corruption charges, but more likely she
 will be allowed to go into exile in Spain.
 Even as Peron was being deposed, junta
 President Jorge Videla was moving to set up the
 new government. A steady stream of official
 proclamations began flowing from military
 headquarters, reflecting the military's continuing
 preoccupation with terrorism. So far there has
 been little violence, but stiff penalties have been
 decreed for anyone who assists the terrorist cause
 in any way, and security forces have been ordered
 to shoot anyone found interfering with public
 services.
 Videla and the two other junta members, Ad-
 miral Massera and General Agosti, were sworn in
 Wednesday morning in a perfunctory ceremony.
 The government has banned political and labor
 union activity, closed congress, suspended the
 supreme court, and begun to appoint military
 governors for Argentina's 22 provinces. The in-
 terim cabinet is composed of relatively young
 field-grade officers from the three services. The
 foreign affairs and economy portfolios will
 probably eventually go to civilians, while retired
 military officers will head the other six ministries.
 The junta will have to turn to foreign
 governments, commercial banks, and inter-
 national financial institutions for help in dealing
 with the severe economic problems it inherited. It
 will bend every effort to avoid repressive
 measures that might damage its international
 reputation.
 The top military leaders are friendly toward
 the US and will strive to improve Argentina's ties
 with it. They will be looking to the US as a source
 of investment and new capital to cover Argen-
 tina's huge debt payments and current account
 deficit.
 The next several months are likely to con-
 tinue to be tough for US firms in Argentina. They
 will suffer from labor agitation, sabotage, and
 shortages of all kinds. The security risk for US per-
 sonnel will remain high.
 Like his recent predecessors, both civilian
 and military, Videla has begun with the hope of
 restoring a sense of well-being to the badly
 fragmented nation. Among its stated objectives,
 the junta vows "to restore morality and honesty,
 to eradicate subversion, and to provide initiative
 to foreign  and  national capital."' Former
 governments have failed to put muscle behind
 similar rhetoric, and Videla's task may prove even
 more difficult. The terrorists and Peronist labor
 are still potent forces, and rampant inflation is for-
 cing even apolitical workers to support radical
 demands for ever higher wages.
 The new leaders will need the support of the
 foreign and domestic financial communities if
 they are to succeed.
