 I,   October Transition
 October saw a. continuation and intensification of the
 drive of the central authorities to restrict and circumscribe
 the more extreme aspects of the Cultural Revolution, but by
 the end of the month there were signs that extremists were
 again attempting to breathenew life into radical policies.
 Disorders, which had racked China from end to end in July
 and August, remained at a relativelyelow level in October,
 and transportation dislocations and other economic disruptions
 were greatly reduced.   This trend appeared to be a reflection
 of the more orderly policies introduced in September, and
 tended to confirm reports that the military had taken a more
 active and direct hand in maintaining order throughout the
 country.   Nevertheless, clashes between rival Red Guard groups
 and between some of these groups and the PLA never entirely
 ceased.  By the end of the month and in the first week of
 November the number and seriousness of these clashes again
 appeared to be on the upswing.   The level of disorder, how-
 ever, remained far below that of last summer.
 A series of central directives coupled with insistent pro-
 paganda emanating from Peking in the first three weeks of
 October appeared to indicate that the central authorities
 were willing to be more forceful than they had been at any
 time since mid-March in bringing disruptive Red Guard elements
 to heel.  Rival groups were enjoined to submerge their dif-
 ferences and enter into "revolutionary great alliances"--
 umbrella organizations composed of representatives from various
 competing Red Guard factions,  This line had been a subsidiary
 theme of regime propaganda. since the spring, but now leading
 spokesmen for Peking--not only relative moderates such as
 Chou En-lai and Hsieh Fu-chih, but also "leftists" such as
 Chen Po-ta, and Chiang Ching--claimed that establishment of
 such alliances was the first order of business in China and
 called on the military to assist the Red Guards in this task.
 Mao himself endorsed this reversal.
 .  At the same time schools throughout the country were
 ordered to open and students were told to resume classes,

 a return to the classroom, but no new nation-wide curriculum
 was promulgated,   Red Guards who had been "making revolution"
 in outlying areas were ordered to return to class or risk              25X1
 expulsion, and a directive of the central authorities announced
 that funds issued to Red Guards in the provinces would be cut
 off and Red Guard "liaison stations" disbanded,

 In mid-October there were also signs that Peking was at-
 tempting to re-order and strengthen its administrative apparatus.
 In stressing the importance of the "revolutionary great al-
 liances" Peking renewed instructions that these organizations
 were to parallel existing administrative and economic "systems,"
 which would tend to make them more easily c-antrolled, in the
 pattern of the docile mass organizations functioning before
 the Cultural Revolution.   At the same time, renewed emphasis
 was also placed on the establishment of "revolutionary com-
 mittees"--larger catch-all organizations composed of Red Guard
 representatives, regular cadres, and military personnel
 piaced on the importance of making full use of regular cadres,
 and a People's Daily editorial claimed that the cadres were
 to formiecore and backbone" of the revolutionary committees.
 Moreover, stress was placed on the importance of the role of
 the Communist Party itself, for the first time this ye=r.
 Nevertheless, Peking's primary instrument in the provinces
 remained the PLA.   In practice the military dominated the
 revolutionary committees and preparatory groups in provinces
 where they had been set up; elsewhere (in 14 provinces) the
 PLA ruled directly through military control commissions.
 Following guidelines established on 5 September, the PLA 'vas
 in most places quick to put down overt outbreaks of violence,
 and in the cities armed military patrols remained active in
 an apparent attempt to keep clashes from occurring.   Late in
 October these patrols were apparently beefed up in many places;
 in Peking they were reported to be operating on a 24-hour
 basis.   Military commanders played a very large role in the
 1 October National Day celebrations, which tended to confirm
 the supposition that the central authorities had taken mili-
 tary sensibilities into account in ordering a cut-back in
 Cultural Revolution activity in September.

 While the military has been reasonably successful in
 keeping the level of violence relatively low, the PLA and
 the central authorities have had much less success in re-
 solving or even significantly reducing the underlying ten-
 sions between rival Red Guard groups.   Peking's tactic in the
 current moderate phase has been to call both conservative and
 radical Red Guard groups in a given area equally "revolutionary,"
 and therefore capable of entering into the "revolutionary great
 alliances" on equal footing.   This approach has satisfied no
 one, and has been particularly repugnant to the radical Red
 Guards, who felt themselves to be the apple of Peking's eye
 during the spring and summer.   The radicals, who still generally
 retain their organizational identity and propaganda outlets,
 are almost certainly receiving at least tacit support from
 militant leaders in Peking, although no direct evidence of
 this has as yet shown up.
 Despite the strong words of the central authorities, many
 of Peking's instructions are still being ignored by Red Guard
 elements, as they were last spring and summer, when less  au-
 thoritative and explicit appeals to end violence and factionalism
 were issued.   Peking's continued emphasis on the importance of
 ending. disputes and on the necessity of a return to the class-
 room strongly suggest that its demands in these areas are
 still no   e n                                                       25X1
 I        un Tibet the    a.sa authorities specifically an-
 nounce     a        he regulations concerning a return of students
 to their schools were to be "suspended until further notice"
 because the local transportation situation made such movements
 an impossibility.   This attempt to mollify the militant Red
 Guards was almost certainly endorsed by the central authorities,
 although the impetus for its promulgation may not have origi-
 nated in Peking.
 The present approach, then, is to end Red Guard violence,
 to circumscribe and downplay Red Guard activities, but not to
 do away with the militant Red Guard groups entirely--except
 insofar as these groups enter into paper "great alliances"
 with their rivals.   This approach contrasts rather sharply
 with that of last February and March, when many militant or-
 ganizations were suppressed outright and the Red Guard move-
 ment was specifically attacked for "immaturity."  This cautious
 attitude probably reflects a feeling on the part of the
 moderate sponsors of the present policies that their strength
 is not great enough to run roughshod over the militant
 Maoists in Peking.

 It may also represent a more subtle tactical approach on
 the part of the "moderates" than evidenced in February and
 March.   The heavy-handed suppression of the militants at that
 time created wide-spread resentment against the military on
 the part of the young radicals, and this resentment was ex-
 ploited by their leaders in Peking to hei.p to overturn the
 policies of consolidation and retrenchment.   The sponsors of
 the present line may calculate that a more cautious approach
 at this time will eventually defuse tensions among the Red
 Guards, but at less  cost than last winter.
 Despite the care exercised thus far, there are signs that
 the extremists in Peking have again begun to accuse the PLA
 of being too harsh toward the Red Guards..   A continuing series
 of editorials in People's Daily and Liberation Army Journal
 in early November have warned that the military needs further
 "education" and that PLA elements do not properly understand
 mass movements.   The most significant of these editorials,
 published in Liberation Army Journal on 6 November, warned
 military personnel        Uiey should not "blindly obey orders"
 when those orders conflict with the thought of Mao Tse-tung.
 This line is a virtual incitement to disorder and violence,
 and was prominently used last spring to exhort radicals after
 the February-March pause in Cultural Revolution activity.  Other
 signs of resurgent radical. activity, such as large-scale poster
 attacks on "moderates" and mass demonstrations against promi-
 nent officials, have not thus far been noted, although they
 were major features of the upturn in militant activity in
 late March and April.   The present muted attacks on the PLA
 may be no more than a trial balloon put up by the Peking
 Maoists; nevertheless, they are indicative of continuing
 tensions and disagreements at the top-most levels of leader-
 ship.   Another sign of such disagreements is the charge on
 2 November by conservative Red Guards in Tibet that their
 radical rivals were attempting to tone down criticism of Wang
 Li, a fairly prominent Peking "ultra-leftist" who had come
 under attack by all factions in early September.
 Although a. number of middle level "ultra-leftists" such
 as Wang were discredited in September, prominent radicals--in
 particular Lin Piao and Kang Sheng--remain in place and are
 active.   Articles lavishly praising Lin were a prominent
 feature in the central press during early November.  These
 "leftist" leaders are very closely identified with the radical
 policies of the Cultural Revolution,  and it is unlikely that
 they will permanently acquiesce in the current moderate
 policies without further attempts to get them reversed.

 II,   The Central Leadership
 The Top Leaders
 The abrupt switch to a more moderate line in early Septem-
 ber suggested that changes of considerable magnitudeohade'
 taken place in the Chinese power structure,   This impression
 was strengthened by the turnout of leaders for National Day
 celebrations on 1 October.   At this time men who had been out
 of sight or in deep political distress throughout much of
 the Cultural Revolution were accorded new prominence; others
 who had played a large part in encouraging the political
 convulsions of the past year seemed to be at least temporarily
 in eclipse,
 The New Line-up
 In the aftermath of the violent disorder of last summer
 several Cultural Revolution figures have fallen from favor,
 chief among them CRG members Wang Li and Kuan Feng.   Some. of
 the remaining members may be in jeopardy.   These men have been
 linked to the "May 16 Corps," the propaganda target charged
 in early September with opposing Chou En-la.i and the People's
 Liberation Army.
 The shape of the decision-making machinery which rules in
 Peking, today, imperfectly known though it is, has now almost
 certainly shifted quite far from the monolithic mode of opera-
 tion of 1965 toward a looser and less predictable kind of
 consensus politics.  Chou En-lai, who appears to have had
 a major role in working out the new policies adopted in Septem-
 ber and October, can be expected to bring forward again those
 leaders who had cooperated with him in the past but had
 fallen afoul of Red Guard attacks,   To date, the only evi-
 dence that this has occurred at the top levels is the renewed
 importance of such figures as Li Hsien-nien and Nieh Jung-then.
 A better case can be made at secondary levels.
 There were two groups of leaders, both associated with
 the moderate end of the policy-making spectrum, whom Chou
 attempted to shield from militant Red Guard attacks in January.
 One of these groups consisted of five Vice Premiers more or
 less consistently identified with the pragmatic policies
 championed by Chou:  Li Fu-chun, Chen Yi, Li Hsien-nien, Tan
 Chen-lin, and Hsieh Fu-chih.  Chou?s strong public defense of
 the five probably put his own standing in jeopardy, but he

 managed to extract the perhaps reluctant support of Chiang
 Ching and Chen Po-ta, who sided openly with Chou in defense
 of his subordlnaes.  As a result, Li Fu-chun and Hsieh Fu-chih
 escaped from tae ordeal unscathed, and the attacks on the
 other three abated during the thaw of February and March.
 In May they began again, those on Chen Yi and Tan Chen-lin
 becoming particularly virulent.   It now appears that Tan
 Chen-lin was permanently knocked out by those attacks.   Li
 Hsien-nien, who was never entirely counted out last spring,
 has been appearing for the last two months in a position of
 renewed importance.
 Chen Yi is a special case. The Foreign Minister has
 made only two publicly reported appearances since 18 August,
 both at National Day observances.   He has been conspicuously
 absent on other occasions when his normal duties would have
 required his presence, and it had seemed quite possible for
 some weeks that he had finally been removed after months of
 strong criticism from revolutionaries.
 Nevertheless, there is now a substantial body of evidence,
 none of it yet definitive  that Chen may be slated for rein-
 statement,
 The last reported anti-Chen rally was held on 27 August,
 and posters since then have pictured him as one of the victims
 of Wang Li and the "May 16 Corps" outlawed in September.I
 The second group criticized by Red Guards beginning in
 J..Luary was primarily military:   two old army heroes and MAC
 members, Hsu Hsiang-chien and Yeh Chien-ying, and the head of

 the state's scientific and technical program, Nieh Jung-chen,
 who is also an MAC member and Vice Premier.   These men were
 also defended by Chou, which suggests that they shared his
 pragmatic viewpoint.   Despite Chou's backing,  it appeared by,
 May that the roles of the three had been reduced to making mere
 ceremonial appearances.   According to poster reports, they had
 been removed from some posts.
 w
 Of the three, the only one who appears to have been re-
 instated thus far is Nieh Jung-chen,   Despite an abject "confes-   25X1
 sion" by Nieh and a public defense of him by Chou in January,
 been instituted, Nieh gave the main speech at a 100,000-man
 rally held in Peking to celebrate the formation of a "revolu-
 tionary great alliance" among national defense scientific and
 technological units and national defense industrial units.
 Most of the top leadership as well as thirty military leaders
 were listed in attendance.  Nieh's keynote speech at this rally
 was his first prominent appearance this year- but he has    -
 owever, several weeks after the new moderate policies had
 peared several times since then
 Representatives from the Military
 A group of younger military leaders have apparently been
 recently included in the policy making machinery.   These men
 have started to appear regularly at important functions and it
 seems probable that they now dominate the military establish-
 ment.              Key men in this group are acting Chief-of -Staff Yang
 Cheng-wu, Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu, two Deputy
 Chiefs-of-Staff--Li Tien-yu and Wang Hsin-tang--a.nd the respec-
 tive chiefs of the rear services department, the air force,
 and the navy.   One point of considerable interest is the con-
 tinued presence in Peking since 25 July--in circumstances that
 enhance their political status--of Huang Yung-sheng and Chen
 Hsi-lien,  the commanders of the Canton and Mukden Military Regions.
 They may be acting as the spokesmen at the center for regional
 leaders.   The individual roles played by these military leaders
 in making policy is not clear, but their influence as a group
 is probably growing.

 Several of the major figures most closely tied to radical

 fact, are consistently so listed in all protocol turnouts.

 the position of at least one of these--Chen Po-ta--seems to
 be somewhat shaky.
 Attacks on the ultra-
 leftists o  the  May 16 Corps," which began on 1 September,
 conveyed the strong implication that some more important
 member of the radical wing of the inner circle was involved.
 Chen Po-ta, who has close connections with Wang Li and other
 disgraced leftists, has seemed a likely candidate.   It is
 possible that Lin is using Chen as a scapegoat for the disasters
 of the past summer, perhaps in an effort to deflect any poten-
 tial moves against his own position.
 Other leftist leaders, although less important, are
 clearly in serious trouble.   Several members of the Central
 Committee's  Cultural Revolution Group--a driving force in
 the Cultural Revolution--fell in early September.   Included
 in this category are Mu Hsin, Lin Chieh and Kuan Feng, all
 of whom have been accused of being sponsors of the discredited
 "May 16 Corps."  A somewhat more important figure who also
 fits into this category is Wang Li--a man who had been given
 a. hero's welcome in Peking in late July, following his brief
 detention in Wuhan by forces responsive to the recalcitrant
 former Wuhan Military Region commander.   Wang has not ap-
 peared in public since August and has been criticized by other
 members of the leftist leadership in Peking,  including Chiang
 Ching.   He has also been under severe poster attack both in
 Peking and the provinces since early October.   However, in
 early November conservative Red Guards in Tibet were accusing

 their extremist rivals of putting up posters defending Wang,
 and his "case" may become a cause celebre, to be exploited
 by the radicals if they attem_To regain the ground they lost
 in early September.
 The Apex
 In terms of his public image, Lin Piao has suffered no
 discernible loss as a result of the policy shift adopted in
 September, nor has Mao Tse-tung.   Mao is still the near-deified
 supreme leader, teacher, commander-in-chief and helmsman,
 and Lin was reconfirmed on 1 October as his first deputy and
 heir.  Although both were conspicuously absent from public
 view for most of August and September, Mao has been credited
 with conducting an extensive "inspection" tour of troubled
 provinces, and has been associated in central directives with
 the new policy line.   Nevertheless, a central directive issued
 in mid-October found it necessary to assure the public that,
 contrary to rumors, Mao was alive, in good health and working
 in Peking.   September's abrupt retreat from the radical
 policies with which Mao has long been associated apparently
 suggested to some that he was no longer active and perhaps
 had died.
 While Lin's public statements in September and October
 were in general agreement with the more restrained stance
 adopted in early autumn, the Red Guard press in at least one
 instance has seen fit to publish afire-eating Lin speech
 presumably delivered at the height of the radical push of
 last summer.   Another Lin speech delivered in early August
 has recently been approved for wide dissemination and discus-
 sion.   Moreover, in early November a series of editorials
 dealing with problems in the army made a conspicuous point
 of lavishly praising Lin--a line that had been noticeably in
 abeyance in late September and October.   While it appears
 that current policy has shifted from the line that Mao and
 Lin would probably prefer to follow, their continued presence
 at the apex of affairs raises the strong possibility that
 they may again press for a radical resurgence of the Cultural
 Revolution.

 III.      Current Status Of Leading Organs Of The Political
 System
 In the past year four organizations have usually been
 associated with the official directives of the decision-making
 apparatus:   the Central Committee--which in practice means the
 Standing Committee of the Politburo; the State Council; the
 Military Affairs Committee; and the Cultural Revolution Group
 of the Central Committee.  All four of these organs have
 suffered considerable attrition in the course of the Cultural
 Revolution.   These changes are discussed below.   In
 addition to these four organizations, this report covers
 the Cultural Revolution Group of the People's Liberation Army.
 This body, though apparently largely inactive, includes in its
 membership four of the more important rising younger officers
 of the PLA.
 Prior to the Cultural Revolution the Politburo was the
 locus of power within the Chinese political system.   In the
 course of the struggle eight of its thirteen members have thus
 far been casualties.   If the alternate members are included,
 eleven out of eighteen members have fallen.  An assault of
 such dimensions on the most significant political body in China
 demonstrates the force of the impact of the Cultural Revolution
 on the body politic.
 The current full and alternate members represent both the
 Cultural Revolution militants (Lin Piao, Chen Po-ta and Sang
 Sheng) usually associated with Mao Tse-tung, and individuals
 thought to be more pragmatic (Li Hsien-nien, Li Fu-chun, Nieh
 Jung-then, and Hsieh Fu-chih) and associated with Chou En-lai.
 The events since August, especially the attacks upon the more
 militant of Mao's aides in the Cultural Revolution Group (Wang
 Li and Kuan Feng), leave the relative stature of the militants
 in the Politburo in some doubt.
 The spectrum of attitudes represented by the membership
 of the Politburo makes an analysis of the dominant members
 difficult.  Recent policy decisions, however, make it quite
 clear that some kind of moderate-pragmatic coalition, probably
 led by Chou, has achieved at least a stand-off with the radicals
 in the policy-making consensus process within the inner circle.
 This situation is probably in part a result of more coherent
 military opposition to the extremist policies of the past summer.

 MILITARY AFFAIRS COMMISSION
 Within the formal structure of the Chinese political
 system the MAC still maintains its critical and potent position
 as the key military body.   In the turmoil of the Cultural
 Revolution,however, its membership has been attacked, purged
 and revised.   Nevertheless, the critical role of the military
 in enforcing and maintaining the present relative calm, and
 the presence: of more pragmatically oriented individuals on
 its board, makes the MAC one of the most important political
 bodies in China.
 The current group consists of three new members (Hsieh
 Fu-chih, Yang Cheng-wu, and Su Yu), and three old members, with
 the two top positions being held now--as in October 1965--by
 Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao.   As Mao is assumed to be the chair-
 man ex officio, Lin has been consistently the acting chairman
 of tH1s  o   since 1959.   Nieh Jung-chen,                               25X1
 I is the third current
 member of the MAC Who appears to nave survived the Cultural
 Revolution.  Although strongly criticized by Red Guards, Nieh
 appears to have been completely rehabilitated.
 The men added to the MAC are Hsieh Fu-chih, who is
 primarily occupied with the Ministry of Public Security; acting
 Chief-of-Staff Yang Cheng-wu; and Su Yu, the Vice Minister of
 National Defense who emerged from a nine year term in political
 limbo last fall.  Yang and Su have both become more active and
 influential during the course of the Cultural Revolution.   Both,
 however, have been identified with the professional military
 structure rather than with the political""officer wing.   Both,
 moreover, are in their 50's, appreciably younger than the
 dismissed members.   Thus, the overall effect of personnel
 changes in the MAC appears to be in the direction of a younger,
 pragmatic professional leadership.

 STATE COUNCIL
 The State Council was, prior to the Cultural Revolution,
 the apex of power within the governmental apparatus, but its
 position in the political system was overshadowed by the
 retention of ultimate political power in the hands of the
 party.  The destruction visited on the party machinery in the
 course of the past year has probably shifted the balance of
 political power to some degree, but whatever freedom the
 gov-
 ernment apparatus may have Y       gained as a result was attenuated
 d
 by Red Guard harassment and the purge within its own ranks.
 Attacks on government officials seriously hindered the admin-
 istrative apparatus of the country, but several key members
 of the State Council appear to have survived this onslaught
 under the protection of Chou En-lai.
 In the present calm the State Council has become an im-
 portant center of moderate influence.   Although it is dif-
 ficult to assess the degree to which the Council is now
 formally operating, it is safe to say that it is directing
 the governmental apparatus in  one  way or another.  Because
 the active membership of this body is now small,it must be
 assumed that much of the work done by fallen vice premiers is
 now being discharged by subordinates, and that those men re-
 maining on the Council, in particular Chou En-lai, Li Hsien-nien
 and Li Fu-chum, have taken on additional responsibilities.

 CULTURAL REVOLUTION GROUP
 The primary function of the CRG seems to be to serve as an
 executive board for implementing the more extreme goals of the
 militant Maoists.   In this capacity, the membership in the CRG
 has become associated with the militant side of the militant-
 moderate spectrum.
 As membership in the CRG brought previously unimportant
 individuals into the locus of power, it also brought them
 into the power struggle.   It is difficult, however, to associate
 the resultant purge of members of the CRG solely with their CRG
 roles.  The downfall of Tao Chu, party boss of the Central
 South Regional Bureau, and his lieutenants Wang Jen-chung and
 Chang Ping-hua in January 1967x--all former CRG members--wras
 probably related to their attempts to build an independent
 power base in southern China.  The purge of Wang Li and Kuan
 Feng last month, however, appears to be directly related to
 their functions as implementers of militant Maoist policy.
 Wang and Kuan had been two of the chief trouble-shooters for
 the militants, and had exercised their power in the summer of
 1967 by touring the provinces and settling local disputes in
 favor of the more militant groups.  When the political Ode
 began to turn in early September, they were rewarded for their
 fervor by being criticizedihd:iater purged.  Recently the charges
 against Wang have expanded; he is now accused of being a leader
 of the outlawed "May 16 Corps," and with supporting Yao Teng-
 shan, an extremist who had been brought back from his post as
 chargd in Djakarta to lead the struggle against Chen Yi in the
 Foreign Ministry.   Mu Hsip, who fell at about the same time,
 seems to be a direct victim of central power politics.  He too
 is charged with being one of the leaders of the extremist
 "May 16 Corps" that has become the symbol of the militant-
 moderate conflict in Peking.
 In its year of existence the CRG has suffered a purge of
 almost half of its membership, and the policies it has stood for
 are presently not being pushed hard; thus its present influence
 upon the decision-making apparatus is probably relatively low.
 However, some individuals that compose its current membership
 are still significant.  Official references to the CRG and
 public apparances indicate that they remain close to the locus
 of power.   If the Cultural Revolution should return to its
 earlier state of frenetic activity, the CRG members would gain
 greater significance.  For the moment, however, the leading
 spokesmen for the group appear to be adhering to the current
 moderate line of the dominant coalition.

 CULTURAL REVOLUTION GROUP OF THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY
 The public announcement of the reorganization of the PLA
 CRG on 11 January 1967 and reports on its activities in the
 following two weeks were the only real public manifestations
 of its role in the Cultural Revolution.   Prior to this time,
 and immediately following this flurry of activity, the PLA
 CRG has not played a public role.
 Compounding the apparent inactivity of the PLA CRG since
 the end of January is the high level of attrition suffered by
 its membership.  Virtually half its membership has been either
 purged, severely criticized, or appear to be politically dormant.
 Nevertheless, as with the CRG of the Central Committee, many
 of the individuals that compose the current membership list are
 important figures in their own right or are close to the inner
 circle of decision-makers in Peking.   The addition of two men-_
 Chiu Hui-tso and Chang Hsiu-chuan--to the PLA CRG in late
 summer has not clarified the current role of this body.

 IV.   The Provincial Situation
 There were few major changes in the provinces during
 October.   The military dominate the leadership in virtually
 every province in the country (Heilungkiang is a conspicuous
 exception).   "Revolutionary Committees"--organs composed of
 representatives of the Red Guard "revolutionary" groups,
 regular cadres and the military, but in fact controlled by
 the PLA--have been established in six provinces and in the
 independently governed cities of Peking and Shanghai.  The
 regime has indicated that these bodies are to become the
 governing bodies at the provincial level, and that similar
 bodies are to be established at lower levels as well.  Several
 cities have already formed revolutionary committees of their
 own.   Five or six provinces have formed "preparatory groups"
 that are eventually to lead to the establishment of revolu-
 tionary committees.  The military also dominate these bodies.
 The remaining provinces are governed directly by the PLA
 through Military Control Commissions.
 Most revolutionary committees and preparatory groups
 were set up prior to the September policy shift.  Only two
 changes have been noted since then.  On 1 November a revolu-
 tionary committee was formally promulgated in Inner Mongolia.
 Announced leaders show no significant change from the
 preparatory group previously in existence in Inner Mongolia.
 According to a radio Lanchow broadcast, a preparatory group
 was set up in Kansu on 5 November.   In fact, earlier Lanchow
 broadcasts and an NCNA account of National Day proceedings
 in Lanchow indicated that this group has been in existence
 since early August; the new announcement showed no change in
 the leadership lineup.   It would appear that the new announce-
 ment was designed to suggest a sense of movement toward a
 more stable and regularized situation in the province although
 no such movement was actually taking place.
