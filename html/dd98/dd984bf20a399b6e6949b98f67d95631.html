;:)7 its temporary regulation (Law-decreo of December 21st 1951), the 
Italian Goverillent decided to block evictions but, at the same ti, to allow 
1 further increase in runts. ,loonwhile AEG limited itself to a simple 
extension of leases. IRywover, we are informed that the extension of the 
Italian low on incxeased runts to Trieste (from February 1st onwards) is now 
being studiod by AUG. 
? 
This measure will certainly give rise- to polemics and -opposition. The 
Association of tenants of Trieste and Venezia Giulia have already submitted 
memorondum to AMC- containing two very-interesting questions. The first 
concerns the houseowners' risht to double the rent in cases where he himself 
only OCCUP?-qiii one 'flat; the second proposes that all controversies 
should be brought beforo a 1.:agistrote. The above-mentioned Association protests 
against the proposed eXtension of'thesc measures to Tricto,1 stressing that 
(in the first case) it would cause hardship to poorer people and (in the 
second case) that the present method of mediation by thc Rent Claims Office 
( instituted in 1 950 by Ai K1-1 a Order 175) is quite satisfactory. 
Vio shall return to those interesting questions in a later edition.

Letter by "Inc elen -3eont" to Genera). Whiteley for return of Trieste flag 
Cit:e a3.l-tLa) 
On 3enueecy iCth the Executive Committee of the Independence Front sent a 
letter to Genere1 1.4hitelew in which, after quoting the Mayor's reply to their 
euestien at the City Council in connection with the withdrawal of the Trieste 
flag fro; l ehe City Hall balcony, the following points were stressed: 
1) ''Le 1\;eeeer de) iberately ignores the provisions and the articles of the 
Peeee Trceely .?eleth.Italy which c:nstitute the PTT and define the State flag; 
2) ho vje4etes .;'iMG Orders and Proclamations Which, in 
ciilection vriti the above reentiened provisions, defined the Trieste flag as the 
tAntx.. one; 
3) In orti,./.? to pr,?ve the laws, articles,. and treaties to be groundless 
Exid non-ceeistelit or nereenforceable, -the hayor gives the opinions of private 
persens, which isr ebeurd and cannot be taken into account by sensible people 
or fenlyi rtie 1 e,;eee reedent r4; 
4.) the Meyer i.efere to the Tripartite Note, but here he only expresses 
his personal via v does not conferm with reality. In fact, it does not 
fellow., even -in the 7f.einion of the most fanatic Italian irredentist, that the 
Tripartite :Prep: elal his :iuridicully annulled the PTT; 
ei in ore.er t eus,eify the withdatewal of the flag the Mayor affirms that 
in this eeee he sefee:uerds the flag of the Cormune from "usurpation". ',Is a 
nntt ex. of fel et, an]. acc,_rding to his own statements, he withdrew the flag from 
the on:1_,..7 place where it should 'De flown, i.e. the City Hall; 
6') the rrovecetive and attitude of the Mayor which was caused 
by the i)rc:3eni regulation against flying the Italian national flag, is clearly 
shown in his cuiclueing re 'LlEI r k 3 ; 
7) there is no r.i.eter to stress the use made of the word "verboten" in 
referrine to LM. which is thus tacitly conparad to those Germans and Nazis 
who pleeii.ered,I.id lauraorcd in b!Trope. 
The :exocetive Coefeittee of the Independence Front has therefore decided. 
and 
?I) sneuld enereetically intervene on the basis of the duties 
entrusted to it ey the UN and seecified. in Gener4 Airy's Proclamation No.1 
of 6epte, G 1" 1 6t.! 1 1 947 ; 
tie CeeiLaur:1 UOO1C1l1; ens of the Independence Front left the City 
Council as a sio;yi of ..:f.-'etest at the affront to the State flag and the 
provocation to. the foolings Triestine population. They will maintain 
this attitude so ion 5 as there :.s no guarantee that the State, its institutions, 
and citizens, are given thLeb respect due to them and which is law in every 
civilized country; 
c) it is nocessery that th11, in its -bum, should establish by a. -proper 
lawsregulations whi,:a will clearly and without ambiguity, settle the use of ?

Trie.F.;te Padua sup:plie a us with quilam products (La) 
ies is well knetin Trieste has one of the most modern oil refineries in 
Europe, tbo "Lertile", whose production far exceeds the local demand, so that 
;-.:1 large proportiun of it prod uets is oeeport6d.. 
Natexally the, locel ceneemer expects to benefit from the proximity of 
this since transport rates from Zaule to Trieste are obviously less 
than thoSo from Zaule to th1irie, Padua , or Milan. But for practical and 
adiniecistleltive. 
roe *Lie m is only one price. 
The Trio et ine .set ofeeen ee.r) wishes to purchase tLquilan lubricants, is

This because the SAP company for the Sale of the refinery products 
has been established in Padua. Furthermore the Aquila products are not 
delivered here on the spot, but they must be shipped from Padua to Trieste, 
so thlet their price is increased by the extra transport costs. It seems , 
inereitibl 'hut it is . a facts. ? 
d.o not deny the "AquiLri.." management its. right to appoint a Padua 
fim as its local agent,but it ie ridiculous that this agent should reside 
in'4i'adua,. thus p'lyincj, his taxes to the Italian treasury. And it 's simply
scandalous that the "Agella" products sold in Trieste are shipped twice, ? 
from and to Trieste, thereby raising the price to the Triestine cornumer.. 
The cairn centaiing the lubricant are manufactured in Trieste, -then 
they are shipped to Padua, from where they are once more sent to Trieste. 
And that is zuppee.ed to be economies.", Fortunately the International Bank 
or Era) has granted four and a half million Dollars to "Aquila" for the-
enlargement or its plants. The creditors must rejoice at such mal-
a dminis tra tion4 
Finally we feel obliged to call the attention of AMG's Department of. 
Finance and, Neonomy to anottx)r fact. The former has credited the Italian 
Goverment with 5 billion lire. for each half year, on account "of 
manufacturing -taxes and custom duties cellected by the "ITT on goods consumed 
by pereons restlent in Italy." . 
Does .1111G. take into account that this pmduct, for which taxes arc ix.id 
in the FTT, when leaving fbr Italy is considereden exported good, and 
therefore as a product S'consumed in Italy"? -When those goods leave the FTT 
the Itoijan treasury is croditod id VI the - respective manufacturing tax. . 
But when these Ilelfse.me.px-oduets /.e-entor the I'T`.T.'? is that duly taken into 
consideration? 
it would be much simpler to collect taxes only for the goods sold in 
the :ri.T? cihi,l custom dutieS, equal to the amount of manufacturing taxes, 
should be laid on similar products entering the FTT. 
So we are faced 'by this absurd situation: t hs manufacturing taxes on-,

Cold terTorism and inept doctrinaires (editorial by Mario Pella) 
Having had the geed ,fortune to capture favourable positions, the 
Independentist intelligentsia veiny -call it a "social novement", entirely 
subservient, according to "Corriere di Triesto"'s theery, to financial 
interests. 
In point of fact Triestine inrodentism sprang from the bourthaisie 
t the time of the Risorgimento when this beurgodgo was the only bulwark 
ainst Habsburg-controlled finance and big business. The cry "Italy" which 
snald.be heard everywhere in Venezia Giulia after the bleak May days of 1945 
was something more than the desire of the nepulation for reunion with the 
motherland it was a desperate cry for freedom dictated by the instinct for 
physical survival. The exodus from POIa and the ether Istrian towns as the-
result of a dire necessity: one does net decide to roam the world Unless. 
driven by deadly danger. 
Just as absurd as its definition of irredentism are "Corriere's remarks 
about la and Italian capitalism. Fascism or no fascism, Italian industry, 
in the throes of 'a huge economic crisis, had to be saved at all costs, even 
by state help, and, if need bp, by the expropriation of private capitalists. 
Esd IRS not taken in hand Trieste's:disorganised and impoverished 
industries and Shipping in 1933, their- collapse would have been inevitable. 
Trieste's ships and shipyards could not be sold under the hammer, they had 
to continue work in order to provide occupation and bread for thousands. So 
the shareholders lost their meneyvbut the public nterest was saved, and 
by. fitting our merehant marine into thenntianal-framework, its efficiency 
was greatly and effectively increased. . 
It is a deliberate exaggeration to say thatTrieste's shipping interests 
were sacrificed to those of otherItalian ports, as a comparison of Trieste's 
and Genoa's sailing lists of 1938 clearly shows. 
Our shipyards and furnaces became part of the newly- Created FTT.. But 
how could they axist without Italian =missions and the vast Italian market? 
It is a significant fact thnt when the recanversion of the IRI enterprises 
into private firms was suggested, the Italian heavy and engineering industries 
Showed not the slightest eagerness to embank upon the venture. 
It is easy to fabricate Belgrade-inspired propaganda arguments but ir. 
the long run truth will /rove stronger than all these fallacies.

Trieste in the (editorial) 
The non-constitution of the FTT has gradually turned into an international 
sere. VThat i he; good of treaties and siglod pledges if -states can take it 
upon thenv:iolvos to simply disregard them at their own convenience?. 
Recently the neiCe..SEilty for linking the .peace treaty 'with A u s tri a to the 
? issue of Trieste. has emerged. The Americans? British, and French show a 
surpxising eagerness to. conclude a treaty With ,Austria although this country 
has, by its. very incomplete- de-nazification and its repent decision to restore 
all his property to the ox-fascist loader Prince Starhemberg, shown that its 
internal situation leaves 'much to be desired. 4ustria must first dismantle 
the s.ritar preparations wh eh With Anglo-American help it had ma do in the American - 
British-French zones and must be freed from the ca- 008 QM' ? exorcised by Eisen-, 
hewer' s troops south of th.-.) Carinthian-Styrian-Yugeglav borderline and, above 
all, in Trioste. 
The convorsion of Trieste into .a military base violates the provisions' 
of the .p eace treaty and, far from being an internal affair of the FM affects 
Austria and in a broader souse line vihole of Central Europe. 
The Soviet demand for the linkage of the twt..) issues has greatly irritated 
? both the Itaiisn.and Slav c uvini sts. The 1t ter are strongly opposed to 
the reunion of .Zones A and B., a rd their demi li tar isa t ion,. and instead want 
the maintenance of the status quo or a tri- or quaarii?artito achinistration 
or a diroct,Italian-Yugoslav 4[:-yeeme.r.lt. They accuse the Seviot of sabotaging 
the Austrian- treat:Jo- Lnd of dragging in the Tr:testc issue only as a pretext for 
their delaying tactics,. The. Italian nationalists say the same., No wonder, 
since the microphone usod by'both -varieties of c.Akauvinists are; in the hands 
of the samc.,i:waster.- . 
By contrast what the -residents ?Of- this territory ardently desire is the 
withdrawal of the .Military forces now occupying the two zones, and ;the 
declaration that Trieste is-an open - city, _with no Marshall plan entanglrrme nts 
which in this capacity will contribute, to world? teaen and also facilitate the 
Austrian. treaty. ?. -

Communal elections (editorial by Giuseppe Pogassi) 
The problem of comMunel elections has again become a subject of great

intrigues by voting against the -status quo, and for the rut-mien  of the two 
zones, thereby putting an end. to -Titoto terrorism and ,i.ingle-J:enericen domination. 
Yet thee() intrigues still continue and the arrival of the now Yugoslav 
ambassador Velebit Rome has given them a fresh impulse. his statement. 
that he has come t o settle all p =Ong accounts between the two c.-.nntrie 
indicates that all obstacles standing in the way ef anti-Soviet aggression 
are now to bo removed. 
Statements to about the same effect were made by the raajority of the

In Zone B a. systematic destriwtion of all the positive atteinments of

for three years, after which the: apprentices became -qualified workers, - 
After 1 943, when .all hone.st. labour representatives and manngars were

Cold terrorism (editorial) 
A &Alice at Trkstois political and economic history of the past 
fifty years reveals the roasons why this port has for the time being lost 
its original function which it so brilliantly performed under the Austrian 
regimo. At one time all comm;mcial inerests is Trios-to were resolutely 
opposed to annexation by Italy; but din'etly aftor the collapse of the 
Austrian empire they changed sides with the agility of smart businossmen, 
and took an active part in the finauoing and support of fascism.

In 1933 Mussolini founded the ira (Institute for Industrial Reoonstruotioi. 
which on the pretext of nationalising the major Italian industries made them 
subservient to the fascist interests. The industrial leaders then in power 
were not eliminated but assigned to posts of command inside the new structure. 
Soon the deep contrast between Trieste's natural function and Italian 
capitalist .policy became painfully clear. Genoa, Naples, and Venice claimed 
and obtained economic priority over Trieste. Spozndic meek attempts DTI de by 
Triestine merchants and shippers to oppose this trend were of no avail; they 
had no choice but to follow suit. It was a process which step by step 
turned :the exponents of Trieste's economy . into adversaries of Trieste, bent 
on dismantling the economic armoury of their own city, with the result ? that 
all our representetive industnial plants gradually passed into the ownership 
of the IRI and its affiliations. At present the Fiadder which controls 
nearly all Italian metal worte 'possesses 75 per cent of the sham capital 
of the Ilva Couroany. The Vinmare entirely owns Lloyd Triestine and does 
its best to switch Trieste's traditional shipping lines to -America and the 
Levant over to the large Italian ports. There is not one big banking 
institute in Italy, the Bence Commerciale Italiana included, that is not 
under direct IR' control. 
These larvelopments, backed, either voluntarily or under compulsion, 
the industrial loaders of Trieste, find their political expression in 
rrodontista as the only means by which these people can, hope to retain 
their dominant position and influence. Of eoursc, they cannot afford to state 
plainly and crudely the motives underlying their longing for reincorporation; 
so they make a great fuss about ideological and national arguments, flags, 
and s entiment e, invoking racial incompatibility, shedding tears and fabricat-
ing myths. Those who refuse to be impreseed by those histrionic tricks, are 
boycotted and subjected to a system of morel isolation and persecution in the 
form of press attacks, cartoons in comic papers, libel and politicel smear 
which can best be described as "cold terrorism". 
There . era:, however, forces in Trieste able and determined to resist 
this drive. They are rallied around the banner of the Independentist Mavement 
which not only aspires to act as a mouthpiece for the universal diacontent over 
the present state of affairs but is engaged in coebating it also in the 
economic field which is the all-important background against which ti-p present 
etruggle is being waged. Indepandontism is, in this some, a social movement 
as it strives to restore Trieste 's. rateral economic functions., to wrench its 
productive potentlel from the claws of selfish monopolists and to denonstrate 
the perfect viability of an economically independent F.T.T. At the same time 
it endeavours to warn the governing powers in Trieste against the dangers in-
volved:. by their protection of industrial irredentism and the consequent 
attraction exorcised on the local political forces by the extremist right-and-
left-wing currents* .Independentism is a political middle-way. movement, averse 
to fanaticisn and biassed against no one. It is neither anti-Italian nor 
enti-Slav and, least of all, arti-Triestine and coapletely inmene. to "cold 
eerrorism".

The Communist Party demands eluctions - Open letter to General Winterton (full) 
To the Commander of the Br./TS Zone of the FTT, General Winterton: 
The FTT s Communist Party chooses this way of addressing 7,04 instead of 
onPlying, as it would prefer, for an interviewsin' order to overcose the . 
ifficulties you have lately put in the way of such encounters. 
Last autunn, when all Parties had submitted the lists of their candidates 
d incurred considernble expenses on account of the electoral campaign which 
ans due to ? start on September 7th, you postponed the elections a few hours 
before that date, and on October 7th you postponed them again to 1952. 
However unconvincing to the majority of the population were the re sons 
adopted by you and by the leaders of some parties for this postponement, they 
are now completely overcome. 
Thi census of the population was completed some months ago; the Communal 
budget estilaates have been drewn up by the Communal Councils which terminated 
their iwat(:; the Minter season is not so rigorous as to endanger in any way 
the flow of electors to the polls, ere, besides, is nearly over. 
The present state of the Communal administrations in this Zone occupiod 
by the troops under your commend is generally recognized as extremely anti-
democratic. besides being detrimental to the interests of the population of 
some Communes, it offends entire populetion of the Zone by the condf,.tion 
of humiliating inferiority. in whidh it lives in comparison with that of other 
people, 
Therefore, the trustees:nip military Administration under your supremo 
comard should immediately announce the dete on which the electoral campaign 
will start, allowing eufficient notice for the elections to be held in a demo-
cratic manner. 
The Communist Party EV aits a prompt reply by Your Excellency to this 
.:.cmLand, with the ? conviction that it oorrectly interprets the desires:of the ? 
citizens, end remains, General, Yours faithfully: for the Executive Committee

The Mayor's Radio speech in defence of Trie stet flag "Vie shall never - 
renoOnce our Mother:La n0." (1.ra-). 
Yesterday morning"Mayor Bartell read the following message to be 
transmitted over the Italian Radio: 
"Those who ender the rod halberd flag of San Giusto want to conceal 
another flag which is not that of Italy, lost their tempers because on 
December 31st 1951 I ordered that the fIng of Trieste should be withdrawn 
from the City Hall, and only be flown on important national and local holi-
days. For this I am accused of breaking My oath of fidelity to the FTI". 
"Tob truthful I never considered I had sworn an oath to the PTT, a 
territory which was never juridically constituted., and not entitled 
permanently to fly the sacred flag of San Giusto from the City Hall". 
I did swear to respect the Italian laws which are still in force in 
this territory, as well as the emergency trorisions issued by the authorities 
of occupation, but I challenge anyone to prove that on the basis of those. 
laws and regulations the Mayor of Trieste is obliged continuously to fly the 
flag from the balconies of the City Hall". 
"I was right to pro, est against the illegal use of the City's flag 
by certain bodies and private offices, which expropriated this flag and 
transformed, it into a coat-of*-arms of a never constituted lilree Territory. 
Considering that this territory was never constituted, it is not entitled, 
to a flag, and especially not this of the City of Trieste. Therefore my 
order is quite legitimate, and in conformity with the moral and political 
interests of our population". 
"1 pannot repeat now all juridical arguments against the illegal use 
of Trieste's flag by private bodies, nor recall the thesis according to 
which the Italian flag should. be flown from all public and state offices. 
want only to *ress that para V of General Alexander's Proclamation No. 3,. 
concerning the use of the Anglo-American flags and the prohibition of all 
foreign flags, was finally repealed by Gen. Airoy's Proclamation No. 2. In 
our opinion it means that the official use of the Italian tricolor, which 
was respected oven by the Cerrfans, was re-established. However, when it 
was hoisted on November 3rd, the Mayor was ordssrod (by the Allies) to 
remove it". 
one should doubt our love for the flag of Son Giusto, which was 
awarded the (Italian) gold modal. 17e hope that on the occasion ce the 
presentation of this medal, the glorious flag of San Giusto may share the 
honours with the flag of our Motherland, which we aht.:11.no Tor ronouneen?

What is Titoism? (editorial by Diego de Castro) 
Last week. Dc Gasperi received the new Yugoslav ambassador Velebit who 
presented his credentials. The ovill was a strictly formal one and no 
rofer(zice to the problem of Trieste is likely to have been made at that 
interview. ? Therefore the general interest at the moment focusses on the 
person 'of ambassador Velobit hitself who is one of the most outstanding figures 
in Yugoslav public life. In the recent war ha was charged by Tito with the 
very delicate task of acting as liaison officer, as it were, between the 
Germans and the partisans. Residing in Zagreb during the German occupation, 
he conCerned himself with the xchange of prisoners of war and by order of 
Stalin and on behalf of Tito, offered the German enerei Glaise not only a 
truce but also partisan help for an attack on the Anglo-Americans should 
they at t enT t a landing in Istria. 
Th c story o: tot i abrupt switch-over. re inind s me of a re cent pamphlet 
published jointly by Christopher Mayhew, and secretary Zor Foreim 
Affair under Bevin, and his wife ? Coolly who was one of the first women 
omployod in the British diplomatic service. This pamphlet is entitled: 
nhat is Titoism?" In perusing it the Italian reader feels inclined to 
?::)eoulate on whether the passing of government from Labour into Conservative 
hands should be ntad as a good or evil event. 
Pamphlets of this kind. are terribly dangerous as they serve the purpose 
of making the Lain points of Yugoslav propaganda, collected at. their source 
in Belgrade, palatable toWestern mentality. It was in Belgrade that Mrs, 
Cecily Mayhew was for some turn employed as a staff member of the British 
Embassy soon after 194.9 vihen the Anglo-Saxons has already begun to view Tito 
and his regime through the rose-coloured lenses of optimism. 
The way in which the Mayhew pamphlet is written, is perfectly suited 
to influence the ;judgement of the average British or American reader as it 
openly, although in the mildest of terms, criticises the Yugoslav government; 
hinting, for example, at jails in full operation and at press and political 
freedom as aims yet to be achieved, but it takes good care to add that this 
lack of freedom is a great. deal more human and tolerable than in any other 
communist-ruled country.

These criticisms are intended to allay the suspicions of the reader 
and to no.ko him amenable to tho positive assertions contained in thoporkohlot, 
Ho gains the impression that a handful of noble stalwarts, whose enmity 
against Moscow dates from. the end of the partisan struggle, are as morn 
Davids with primitive slings fighting a heroic dual against tho cominformist 
Goliath. This touch of romanticism and solf-sacrificing horoism raisos 
Yugoslavia's resistance to Moscow almost to the glories of a myth,

Thoro.lios the rub: that this pamphlot idoalisos for the benefit of 1..7ostorn 
mentality ?the infomy inherent in all communist tyrannies beyond the iron 
curtain. And the+ cas is furthor ageecavated by the fact that a British 
foreign secretary and a woman who belonged. to the diplomatic corps are its 
anthors. 
Tho pamphlet reflocte faithfully the Labour mentality in regard to 
Tito. 17o are far from suspecting Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew of had faith, but 
we cannot help- seeing in their work the area) naive and fallacious confidence 
with which the past Labour regime hoped to convert a communist dictator of 
the Balkan variety to the icieftls of honest and lo.yel. socialism. It is 
rumourod: that it was- the British who oncouragod Tito to continue his idoo-
logical campaign against Moscow. Tito, unwilling woutonly to provoke his 
groat enemy, hesitated to obey. But from the Mayhew pamphlet omoogos 
unmistakably the dosixo of its authors for the ideological triumph of 
Titoist socialism and its gradual approach to tho Western socialist doctrine. 
They try to domonstrate with a welter of. arguments that Tito's and Stalin's 
communist theorios are entirely different in essence. These oxortions 
are as sterile and preposterous as in the middle ages were the heatod 
discussions about the sex of the angels. Hard and merciless facts have 
nothing to dd with lofty theories and ideological daydreams: 
The now Conservative Government, headed by the ingenious sceptic 
Churchill, should resolutely drop all pretence of supporting Tito for 
ideological motives, and confess frankly that it does no for reasons of 
military and political convopience. It is an open question, however, whe-
ther Churchill will not try to take., his rovengo on Stalin for the loss of 
British erostigo in Yug)slavia during the war by attempting to enhance: this 
prestige through concessions to the Yugoslav government. This possibility 
makes ,rryJ fear thot, if we h:ve not fallen from the frying paninto the

3) By November the public security authority submits to the Commune a 
list of -all citizens who have a restricted liberty as well as a list of those 
who keep brothels and gambling clubs. 
if) On November 1st the mayor supra= all those with the no 
eealifications to apply by November 15th for rej.stration in the electoral 
liats. 
Not later than December 1 5th the electoral ceranunal conmission compiles 
three _separate lists. the purpose of revision. 
On the first list are those who have been previously emitted, including 
those who will be 21 years eld 1)y April of the following year. Thu second 
Lot ,provides for the exclusion of electors n; per para No. 3. 
3) By Docembe:-.. 31st the eriyor invites all those who wiSh to object 
Le the three lists, to submit their objections to the electoral commission 
of the zone before January 15th? 
ey December 31st the cemntrial 'commission provides for the revision 
of the division of the commune into electoral sections as well as for 
assiegling the electors to the different sections. Electors will be assigned 
to the section of the Oommune nearest to their dwelling. 
7) ]:;' January 25th the mayor ,must submit to the electoral commission: 
a) the three lists of the annual revisions; b) the objections. lodged against 
those lists; c) the minutes of the revisional operations; d.) the decisions ? 
regarding the modification of the sections. ? 
8) By ni,larch 3 i st the doctoral conlaissi on. returns to the Commune all 
the lists concerning the annue 1 revisions. 1ithin the following fortnight the 
Commune brings the lists Up to date, informing the persons concerned about the 
decisions of the eleciteral commission. 
9) The corrected. lists, together with the lists of the annual revisions 
approved, must be publicly displayed fro:a the 15th to the 30th of .April. Any 
objection which all citizens are entitled to make before the Court of Appeal, 
must be submitted ithin 20 days after the notification or within 30 days 
after the publication of the corrected lists. 
Taking all this into account the most convenient date for the elections 
to be hold would be after May 31st of any year in order to give everyone an 
opportunity to lodge their claims or protests against exclusion from the 
,Aectoral lists. .If, on the other hand, the elections were held at an earlier 
dAe, e.g. on the 10th or 20th of April, the Pro-electoral tasks would coincide 
1,vith the annual revisions of the cacatoral lists, thus causing tremendous

are virtually ,completed. 
Allocations have boon made for repairs to the sidewalks and the paving 
of many streets in the center. Some streets will be given an asphalt layer, 
which is more suitable for modern traffic. The following streets are 
included in this Program: Torrebianca and Valdirivo, Corso Garibaldi., Piazza 
Garibaldi; the first sector of Vitae D'Axinunzio, Viola Min,mare. Since all 
those streets .are located in the city center, their adaptation is evidently 
very important. Passo Goldoni will also shortly be open to traffic. 
We should like to have soon the Via Dante and mix ottobre included in 
this program, thus allowing a better distribution of traffic in this sector. 
In Piazza Liberbaf an illuminated fountain will be built, which will 
greatly improve the square, but it needs much better street lighting. as 
does rase Corso Oavour.

Rumour has it that the XMG intends to hold elections in Zone B within 
the ne:t half year, thus anticipating tbem by one year. 
A cc ording to-the Ist CU. this ant ic ipati.)n of the elections is 
due to political reasons, viz. to 0,Aspel AND to hold electi xis also in 
Zone At the same time, these elections would be considered as a 
plebiscite for Yugoslavia, thus preparing the fambus partition of the FTT. 
A spokesman of the Istrian OLIT has declared. that if elections are held 
in Zone B. the italitAn government Should no longer delay a free plebiscite, 
for the entire 'PTT. 
RecOliecti,n4- of the 1950 clectiona, whon people were beaten .up and 
compelled by force ti.g)o to the polls, are st.L11 fresh in their minds. 
witnesses, and many personal statements in the hands of As/1G, testify to the 
real meaning of "elections" in' Zone 33.

are doing all they can to hamstring the w-.)/Izers cMployed in Zone .4$ whose

Only Austria benefits from the Trieste-Hamburg "duel" - Agreement with 
Hamburg is Considered, a vital necessity - Princi7S-of "geographical 
dietance" regarded as inapplicrblo to traffic ?issues - Hamburg's position 
reinforced by a vast network of shipping linos (by :7erio iTerdie) 
Hemberg justifies its keen competition for tho lareest passible share 
of Austrian :overseas traffic by denying emphatioally the decisiveness of 
geog.aphical distance. in international traffic, and by stating that Hamburg 
has always held a prominent olio() in Austrian import and export trade with-
out prejudice to the Adriatic ports. Hamburg further contends that it has 
lost roughly 5C),-/o-' of its 'hitrtor]anfl' so that to obtain now 'sources of traffic 
has be00rra3 a matter of life. area death for it. We must admit. that there is 
a measere .of truth in this argument The Elbe, rightly considered the main 
artery of.Baet Gorman -traffic.. has ceased to be a Voetern river 's.i/1.-30 the 
end of the war and the detritent caused by Hamburg 'by this important change 
is inuttrated by the drop of .7abe traffic from 4..5 million tons in 1936 
to 0733 million tons in 1949. Moreover, the port of Bremen has emerged as 
a new competitor for Austria's overseas traffic, in-creasingly used by her 
for :her ee,porte of iron to England and her imports of coal from the US. 
:Lt-rue that Hamburg has retained a portion of its former Czechca-
Laovalciv?n traffio bdt it derives little ?befit from it as ..this trade 
current is entirely in the hands of the Soviet state authorities .and 
consequently neither profitable nor capable of being increased by any 
efforts 1:Tamburg may make.: 
r..)v.rds Hanburg's policy in regard to Austrian trade it must be 
noted tit the most 'uncoMpromising factor in German competition is the 
administration of the .German state railways which have ? proved fax' more
intractable that the northern chambers of commerce Or even the port autho-
rities there.. On the other- hand, the weakest .spot in the Adriatic armoury 
is not pert installations, which are admittedly excellent, but the paucity 
of shipping services. What are Tricatolts and Venice's shipping facilities 
compared with Bremen's 130 lime with 230 sailings, not to mention Hamburg's 
186 lines with -436 sailings? It? is a notorious feat that Central European 
cargoes -shipped through Adriatie ports often have to it a long time for 
sailings.?while no such handicap exists in the northern porta. And the. 
situation will certainly. not change in 'favour ef the Adriatic ports when 
the reconstructiOn of the German mx;rchant fleet, now under way, is completed 
and so naked possible an 'all-round reduction of Hanseatic freight rates. 
An important el.enent, although difficult to judge and on the whole 
uncontrollable, is the role played in Austrian overseas traffic by the 
forwarding.a,gente. Next to the port authorities it is they who detormim 
tho Orientation Of traffic, for rib one can say.what extra incentives they 
may offer "under the counter", to importers and exporters 's? as to make 
them prof:Jr ono route to another.: do not blame. them for this. Competition 
is Osefdl and, from a broader economic viewpoint, oven necessary. At the 
sari() time., however, we can understand the scepticism with which many 
obeervers View the possible practical 'effect of agreenents between the 
rat -thorn and the Adriatic ports. No one can be expected to act against his 
own interests in buSinesspend things it is .feared,will remain much as they 
t.170. now. . 
.The Austrians who are the bone of contest in this case, have never 
concealed their dislike of traffic conventions which are regarded by them as 
"cartels" noxious to their trade. Used to profit by the rivalry between the 
Adriatic and northern ports, they rejoice in any breakdown of negotiations 
for an understanding between them, while competent economic circles in ? 
Trieste a nd Hamburg become Jr.ore and more convinced that a Hamburg-Trieste 
understauding is a vital necessity and should be reached before the losses 
on either side have become too heavy.

The competition of Venice is not considered by Hamburg as very disturb-. 
tug. 'Venice serves minly as a transit port for Southern Bavaria, Tyroloand 
Vorarlberg which, at least for the time being, are not included in Hamburg' s 
expansion prograrrmo. 
It is a gratifying fact that after a long break a regular Italianshipp: 
line, run by GENS (the successor of the "Tyrrhenia") is calling again at tt-r. 
port of Hamburg. Probably the"Tyrrhonit"will resume this service itself as 
soon as its now ships now under construction are completed. Despite its 
belated appearance this Italian line is working with fair xv sults. It is 
to be hoped also that Italy's largest shipping concern, "Fix-mare, will befo. 
long sot up an agency in Hamburg which has never ceased to be the largest 
shipping centre for our dried and fresh fruitS, citrus products and wines. 
Unlike Trieste, Cr o Oa is not a riwl of Hamburg, but rather of Rotterdam 
and lIntvierp, In addition to the direct railway comamications existing 
between lifutburg and. the Ittlinn cities of Rome, Genoa, Milan and Venice a 
now into r,--ctional express train, the express, connecting Frankfurt, 
minajoh, Verona, Florence, and Rome will run as from May 18th of this year.

It announce than that, paneling the results of an inquiry ordered by the 
authorities, all work at the Tobacco Factory will cease for the time being. 
Mentioning the labour conditions at the Tobacco Factory, vary low 
wages (3,600 lire a week), inadoquato safety a nd sanitary measures and 
inoufficiont heals served in the personnel =as during the very short 
break of talf an hour, the raper recalls the recent agitation among the

It would take too long to go into the details of this change. 'ffe just ; 
wish to cell attention to some phrases printed in the last edition a "Giornt-t- ? 
dclLune7ii", whore the transfer of "Cittodelle" is sharply criticised by the 
demechristi M. editors. They say: "If, as well as iLe .Voce Libero? and 
*Lilt:41480.1-11ot our woolray were also to be .absorbed, the local Italian. news-
pope rs would then become a monopoly, and you -cannot pass ibly have a demo ei 
pros1..lro th.oro is a nonopoly". . 
? Of course there would only be on "editorial monopoly of the Irredent-
pre s s" since -there are tinny Italian papers which, faithful to domooxntio 
principles, will never become the -mouthpieces of any group. 
We arc surprised at the. naivet?f the se -editors, since the feet that 
"Cittadella" changed its 0 Valor does not imply any substantial modification-. 
4* of the entire. Irredentist press. . It is no secret, that the so-called demo-
cratic Irredentist Dress is under the aontrol of the Hon. Andreotti- and 
his plenipotentiary Dr. D'Arcais, who is the chief-editor of the Rome branch 
of "Giorxl,aie ai Trieste". The Demochristian youth still remebor that Ing. 
Bortali and Dr.. Amedini, 'former editors of "Ultimissime", did not protest 
when the lattor was replaced by "Ultimo Notizie". We do not -think that the 
Do mochrist tan circles in Rome nd Trio ste oppo od RIM Ale OS s coino ,back. 
The Demochrithtian youth should ?therefore first c:-,nsider the beam in

proved that they are not intenested in the protection of democracy in 
natters concerning our city. During November and December when LMG 
aneouneed its intention to transform the "Tork Relief Division, the SU 
strained all its efforts in vain to induce LNG to discuss the matter demecra, 
ticelly vith the labour organizations. From beginninn to end, however,1,111G 
negotiat:d exclusively with Cal which kept its participation a secret until 
it publicly boasted of having succeeded, after lengthy discussions, in

The political discrimination dinected so for against our organization 
has already made itself felt upon oeoplo "of definite Italian feelings". 
inti-democracy is supported and introduced by .1.'airG in all labour fields? 
and undisputed "Orders" are issued as they wore under the role of "believe"

./A.d. to Trieste in foreL____em exch..,ange (Reply by Councillor Delise to Indeo. 
pendentists, thesis) (La) 
According to "Corriere di Trieste" Rome's financial help to Trieste is 
more than compensated by the Rats cession of foreign exchange to the Italian 
Government. Art* I of Annex III to the Financial Agreern nts of liarch 9th 
19/4.8, on the oentrary, says that Italy undertakes to moot the requirements 
for foreign exchange of the PTT at conditions similar to that in force in 
Italy. Blacianail and counterpart are out of the question: Italy undertook 
to supply not only the necessary lire to ewer the defieits but elso. the 
necessary foreign exchangel In ott-Lr words Italy allows T-!:?iestels economy ? 
to share her foreign exchange, and the amount at its disposal is determined 
evex7 year in accordance with the reasonable demands made by MG, regardless 
of thc foreign exchange Trieste earns locally and which must, df course, 
'be oeded to the Italian Government. Just to give an example of the benefits 
to r.t.'riesto of ouch agreement.% let "Corriere' consider for a moment how 
-eould feel should menobody (if that has not yet been done) assure the 
financing of its activity no nutter what the proceeds of the sale _mitt 'be* 
Apart from this availability of Italian foreign exchange, -Trieste also 
ehares in all trade and financial ageoements signed by Italy, particularly 
the "cle.,:xirees" which. our Zone could not contract for owing to its size.

be s Lirara ad up as follows: 
Mr. Bruno Genie, in hi s attempt to Unina sic the weakness of the Irredenti-
ebonomic propaganda, was compelled to US e pill() very st ange economic theories 
and to adapt them in quite an original manner. He stated that the geonomic 
se lf -suffici enoy of Trieste was already proved and that Trie ate s final 
recovery could only be accomplished by its complete detachment from Italian 
national capitalism. As to Triestine industry, he stated that it must be 
freed from the "sabotage" of Italian competitors.

Th. Corm affeireed thet the cause of tai our troubles originated from the -

1948,0 which "will not allow us to .buy and sell abroad., to create our own 
bank, or to build industries competing with tilos? in Italy". 
But Mr. Cerne's most ingenious theory is with regard to labour - 
problems* He stated that the "economic potential of a region is in direct 
proportion with the Will to worb, of its inhabitants". In this simple 
manner Mr, Corm attempts to solve the problem of 17,673 unemployed in 
Trieste* 
During the ensuing discussion a vary clever labourer explained the 
reasons why "we cannot trust Italy", and. the Director of the Indepondentist 
daily, sitting with. Councillors Dekleva and Giampiccoli, stressed the neecl 
"to act politically since the Italian Government ia doing its utmost to 
suffocate'Trieste", The latter asked. for some explanations on the alleged 
underhand practices at the Zaule Industrial Port Authority and the Center 
for Trieste's Economic Development* With perfoot coolness, Mr0 Corm) 
replied that there is not sufficient proof to condemn the managers of the 
above-Triontioned coneerns. The famous economist doncludod his lecture by 
affirming that he will .continue to insist on the establishment of a customs 
barrier at Duinoo

This picture has: gerrally been more ,criticized. than praised., but ,owing to 
the sudden death of the actor Randi it; had a particular attraction. There 
were no outstanding incidents although this picture touches on some 
sensitive point's, such es the role of the Slovene partisans during the 
struggle of the Italian martyrs in our region. 
The indopendentist mouthpiece, followed by the Slovene daily staged 
a campaign againSt this 'picture, asking AMG to have it suppressed since 
it "slighted a Slovene partisan" and ?threatc:)nee: "the a.ppeaeoment between 
the two rations", Yeeterday afternoon AMG suddenly ordered the suspension

The -nort of Trieste and Russia's satellIt22 (editorial). 
The present political situation compelling Trieste's hinterland to 
cenfane its trade predominantly to the Soviet Union is the main obstacle 
standing in the way of Trieste' s economic recovery. Venice, Fiume, and - 
the hastern Adriatic ports, labour under the same handicap, and. even 
Hamburg has to struggle against difficulties of a similar kind as the 
enormous decrease of its HunprLan traffic - 100-200 thousand tons a month 
before the war and a miserable few hundred tons now - clearly shows. Hamburg's 
traffic relatims vtith Czechoslovakia were not quite se much disturbed,as 
the effect of the 5 year commercial treaty recently ConClUded by her with 
the soviet Union,has not yet -ssade itself felt. Under this treaty, Czecho-
slovakia is. to import from Russia about twenty million tons of goods, mostly 
raw nnterialo, for which she will pay with her own manufactured articles.

Czechoslovakia's ovorsoas exports via Hamburg during the past year 
amounted to roughly 600.-700 thousand tons, besides other considorablo 
shipmonts made by her via Triusto and thu other Adriatic ports. 
It must be noted in this connection that Czochoslovald.an goods pay 
particularly high freight ratos so that, evon a partial loss of this trado 
is more sharply felt than the enliinutior of any.other trr.,.ffic4 All the 
othcr Russian satellite states ore in a similar position, as they too 
aro obliged to give Russia largo proforenoo in all their sales and?purchasos. 
'Their trado with 17ustorn Europo? tho US, the Middle East and Africa is 
dwind.ling. A good example of this artificial diVorsion of traffic is the 
recently concluded Chinoso-Czechosiovakinn trade agroorrent; all the traffic 
from this is sent by.the usual Russian-Chinese trade routos,avoiding 
Trioste and the Baltic ports with comploto disrogard for economic convoniotice? 
Czechoslovakia's rail communications wore built at thu time (;,:cf the Austrian 
Empire of which Trioato was thu only port of international importance and 
tho.7 wore so constrUctod as to reduce both the cost and duration of 
? transport to a minimum. 
On the other hand a substantial increase of ll2 is recorded in 
Czechoslovakia's trade with Eastern Germany, for the first nine months 
of the past year as against the samo period of 1950.. A large proportion 
of the East German output of heavy machinery, fortislisors etc., is absorbed 
by Czechoslovakia which in compensation, exports to East Germany colej, 
metals, and other. industrial products. A commoraial agruorrent botwoon the 
two states signed in the- first half of last Docombor providos for the

Conferonce on PTV s economy by Bruno Corm (La 
The problem of Triostots economic survival was expounded yesterday 
by our editor on ocionomics Mr. Bruno Corn?. 
After mentioning thu psychological causes of the Irrodontist campaign 
against.tho FIT and its oconomic self-sufficiency, the lecturer analysed 
the positive arid negativo aspects of. our economy. Mr. Coma pointed out 
that under the pressure of the Italian Govornment's financial and. customs 
control, resulting from the detrimental agreements of March 9th 1948, our 
industry-is condomnod to a secondary role, with no opportunity for final 
recovery. The only way out of this dead-lock is to free our oconomy 
from the yoke of the Italian bureaucracy, to find other outlets and 
markets, and to re-establish Triesto's traditional role in the European 
and. international trade. 
Mr. Como outlined the main aspects of the sabotage by Italian 
bureaucracy and capitalists against the free devolopmnt of our traffic 
with the hinterland countries, aria laid particular stress on the restrictive 
clauses, imposod by the Italian Govornmunt, of our trade agreement with 
Czochoslovakia.

LA PRORA Demochristian Party, weekly January 18th, 1 952 
Velebit And ktal.,,y 
In a statement to the , press, maTh. be fere. his ? departure from Belgrade 
? Mr. Vclobit said that it was his (and we presume also his Govermnutls) 
intention to "settle all pending accounts with Italy". Undoubtedly the 
most vital of these is the FITT problo m and therefore we desire that the 
Yugoslav delegate sh-)uld entert,.tin no illusion or mistaken idea about it, 
He should have a clear vision c)f. the huge moral and financial sacrifices 
? which It xlj has made already, ha should .think of the many farailies separated, 
all the lives destroyed an the cruel rufferings inflicted on the people of 
Zone B, while those in Zone A are still c,..trapelled to .live under a military 
'? administration and to remain.ign.orant, so many years after the war, of their 
final destiny. ..? 
The vastness of the Itasn sacrifices has been 'Imre than once recognised 
by the Allied .powers, particeaarly by the tripartite declaration of March 
20th 1 943. Despite the polemics which arose about this declaration through 
the far.3t that it cannot become operative without Russian assent, it remains 
a document of first rate importance and no "settlement" deservingithis no= 
? . 
can afford, to disregard it.

With what intentions exactly does Velebit come to us? Whatever they . 
ere, he must be mindful that Italy is no longer the defeated country she 
was, forced to make the best of any bed largein, but a =oh needed, right-
ful member of the Atlantic pact and. playing a leading role .in the. attempt 
to unify this continent. By contrast, YUgoslavia's position shighly 
confused and uncertain. Unable to exist without focrerign economic and 
military help, she w oul d find herself in the most terrible plight if 
Italy, whose military potential and. strategic importance are rapidly 
La-owing, decided not to budge in the event of a Russian attack on Yugo-
slav territory. ?? Besides, Yugoslavia's economy is hit by a crisis of un-
precedented magniturie. - ? 
It is from the angle of Italy's fundamentally changed international 
Position that tho. problem of FIT must be envisaged. I.taly has a right to
expect that the Allied rowers will use their influence in Belgrade. To 
Italy the issue is one of vital, moral and rational significance, whereas. . 
to Yugoslavia it means only the renunciation of unreal dreams.of dernimtion 
devoid of all inoml and juridical justification. 
Italy's claim, made by her as an ally, holds good in either case, 
whether Yugoslavia is regarded a5 adhering to the Atlantic pact or not. 
If Yugoslevia is considered as a member of the pact, our claim is justified 
by reesore of' dignity artl justice And as a-necessary prek3ondition to. 
fruitful cooperation. If, howeV6r,' her role is that of a mere sphere of 
influence serving, the political and military needs of. the West, it would bo. 
unfair and _absurd to saddle one 41,1lied -Country with the entire cost. From 
whichever viewpoint the matter is Considered, e .solutieln :in accordance with 
the sacred rights of Italy is. imperetive whatever Mr. Velebit may .think or 
says 
Italian law must be applied to the elections 
At the last meeting of the Communal. council the communists demanded 
with their usual vehemence the prompt holding .of elections, lavishing 
insults on the majority ,parties. A few well-chosen and determined words 
by the mayor repulsed the attack and restored calm.. ?. 
We 
on our part have never ceased to .stress- the necessity for, applying 
to the elections in this territory the law by which this matter is regulated' 
in Italy and to -point out the serious gaps and deficiencies of' OrderNo.33 . 
of February 21th 194.9 by which, with arbitrary modifications, this law was 
exteleded to the FriT. We also repeatedly criticised the electoral system 
originally introduced in Italy which in our view failed to provide one very 
important requisite to any efficient administration; the stability of the 
administrative body elected. 
The-present democratic majority has not the slightest reason to fear e 
the coming- elections, hence arv interpretation given to its wish for the 
extension Of the Italian electoral law to this zone would-be completely 
mistaken. Only totalitarian parties such as the ? communists have cause to 
dread the .polls.- , - 
We have on various occasions expressed our conviction that the extension 
en bloc .to.the FTT of Italian legislation is not an act of courtesy or - 
generosity on the Dart of AMG but the fulfilment of an incontestable jur4.4i cal 
obligation. Order 38 of February 20th 1951 only perpetuates the mistake_ - 
contained in the .erevieus order 33 and is completely inadequate to the .present 
political and social cenditions in this zone. In Italy, following the law . 
No. 34 of .February 21st 1951, the presidential decree No. 703 of April 5th 
1951 was issued conteining,. the unified norms for the eleotion of communal 
administretions, and coordinating harmoniously the rulings of the law-decree 
No, 1 of 3.-ar4try'1st 1946 with. the more recent law No. 84 of February 1951. 
Theee..unified. norms must in their totality b applied to the elections in 
Trieste. ?

Conmuni st propaganda clamorously denounces them as "hurabug". In realit, 
they are not only strictly democratic in that they enable every citizen to 
cast its vote according to his political conviction but also offer the 
groat advsntage of enabling, the formation of a strong, sure, and stable 
majority fit to be charged with the conduct of nablic affairs. 
The FIT 3 S:7,0 rtOrS plaz_with billions Some observations on Zone's 
budget and miracle-making ability of Independentist wiseacres 
The main goal of the Indepenr3entists' polemical technique is to prove 
that Zone of the FTU has a balanced budget. To succeed in this aim the 
wiseacres of the Contrada del Corso (the HQ of the Indepondentist Movement) 
are not particular about their- methods: from changing the figure s, meddling, 
with the various items, to creating a confusion between expenditures and 
receipts, just to satisfy the stupidity of certain short-sighted persons 
who believe that Rome and Italy are the greatest horrors in the Universe. 
.A balanced state bl..tdget, is a vital basis of this nonsensical political 
party which wants to e ?ate a new Triestine nation. In order to become a 
nation, Trieste should, at:I:et:xi:ling to these notifm-builders, get rid of 
Italy and her economic aids. They completely overlook the fact that Yugo-
slavia, although having a thoroughly balanced budget, is actually compelled 
to beg for I ariP mt aid fro al th0 7-0 stern POtlOrS in order to come out from 
her economic ciisis. 
.4,balanced budget estimate is -only an addition of various figures and 
it does not express the real ecinom:,,c (And social situation of a nation or 
zone. The clean ate which sh:w the reality of stich a situation are:. consumption, 
export, technical ability, accumulation cf capitals, managerial 
re serves of raw materials and manufactured goods, geographicposit ion, own 
currenT area and so forth. Many of these elements do not appear in a state 
budget, but they are very important. 
.4 few days ago the "Corriere di Trieste" assorted that Italian industry 
makes a very good profit on goods in Trieste, and therefore the famous 10 
billions re-oresont onl,y a counterpart item. Leaving thia vs) stiomble 
matter, we would point out that, on the other hand, Trieste exports to Italy 
a considerable quantity of coffee, rcocoa,'spices wood, oil, cigarette 
? paper, beer, liquor and so forth.. t the same time it receives all rnw 
material .through s clearing componsati ens. ? 
Instead of making, thoir dubious investigations on single items of 
Trieste 's budget, the wiseacres of the Con trade del Coro should examine 
the entire system of payments, the port compensintions with CZeoboawakia, 
Italy' s a0tion to counter the C01111)CItiton by'horthorn ports, Austria's 
overseas ox-ports, ort s and the index p2 the Y ago a lax and. Hunip rian foreign trade. 
They should ask themselves the reasons for the Yugoslav, Austrian,? 
NungarirAny OzochosloVakian 'etc. , lack of concern ,for the Zaule Industrial 
Zone, the investments in which are opened to all countries. 
reply to these questions will be never given by the Independentists 
because it would be ,.couelotely contrary to their anti-Italian propaganda.

According to Art. 16 of the Ceinstitution of the Italian Republic, a 
citizen may reside wherever he desires in the Italian territory. There 
arc still some deubts, however, as to whether the law of -July 1939, No. 
1092,against the overcrowding of towns is still valid. In my opinion it 
should not be voJid. - 
The most outstanding fact, however, is that by its Order No.64, 
issued some regulations restricting the registration of pernenent residents 
in the cols :Imes ef our zone without making any sta terse nt regarding the 
general regulations contained in the various laws ruling that matter. 
lifter many protests, Orders No. 222 and 156 were issued, which showed a 
better underStanding of the position of those who ?sad not be deprived of 
the right to re gist or a s permanent residents. 
lifter May 31st, 1951, it was no longer possible for temporary residents 
t be registered as permanent residents unless they belonged to one of the 
fallowing categories; a) children of residents; l's) wives, of residents; 
c) orphansewhosc guardians are -residents; cl.) widows and legally separated 
wives whose :perents were nsidents on June 10th1 1940; e) Italian citizens 
resident in our zone on June 10th, 1940; f) Italian citizens born in our 
Z 01-1C permeeent officials of public e dmini s't rations transferred to our 
zone. 
AIM Orders never stated whether the previous regulations of 1 929 and 
1 939 were cancelled or only suspended bY the new provisions. The 00111T111110 
and the Prefecture held that they were only suspended.. 
Does this present state of affairs f..1,00 with general principles of 
law end justice? We feel it does not. 
ea'r seems to have had two motives in issuing these restrictive regu-
lations. Firstly, the intention was to avoid increasing the population 
of Trieste .d taring the trusteeship administration of this zone; secondly, 
to safeguard the local labour market. ? 
esperiende has: showe that these regulations failed to reach them aims 
and hey only created confusion and discontent, with the exception of those 
employers who benefited from the regulations in farce by illegally employ-
ing nen-resident workers et lower wages. Thus many persons duly registered 
as permenent resiaents and vho could be employed, burlen our public finance 
or the ERP funds instead of contributing to our prosperity. 
The present regulations should therefore be modified particularly as 
-the reeir.,..tr,y office will be compelled to revise the present data in con-
formity with the census results. 
Two considaretions should be taken into account; Firstly the final 
settlement of controversial cases of the past, according to the census 
returns,by the tacit acmptanco of declarations of pernanrnt residence; 
secendly the norms for -Lae future provided for by Regulation No. 2132 of 
Dec. 2nd,1929.

IL PROGRESSO - Pro-Tito, ?Neekly, Januar/ 19th,1952 
Trieste end. the iiISA aid_s 
Last week the local Demochristiens felt obliged to call M.'s attention 
to the foot that Mutual Security Agency's aids to the FTT should be supplied 
through Rome only. 
After all kinds of scandalous embezzlements by the Italian bourgeoisie 
of ERP funds, causing the Americans to declare that they will not pay another 
cent if the Italians arc not willing to shoulder at less.t part of the general 
burden in the interest of peace, the local agents of the Italian bourgeoisie 
have the ispudence to demand further allocations.

The Trio st Ines arc the first to claim that the aids for the Anglo-
American zone of the FIT should be allocated to Trieste itself and not 
to Roma. They hove stripped us of half a million tons of shipping and 
of the big insurance companies, Lre they not yet satisfied? 
We rflust not forget that to each ship built in Trieste, EP contributed 
a third of the total exuenditure. Italy h-d, the ships built in Trieste 
with our money and then sailed thorn away to Italy. They du not even allow 
them to call at Trieste, 
If they, contrived all that with our MP funds separated from those of 
Rome, Lhen imagine what they would do if both funds were united. In that 
case Zeno B could also be conveniently ox.,ploited. 
? It would be the first time in hintcaythab a crooked administrator, 
after defrauding those under his oaro,would be raiNtlac.d by an increase 
of capitol, That is the case of the Italian bourgeoisie, which has 
squandered the funds entrustc.d to thorn. This has been openly acknowledged 
by the chief of the ECA mission in Rome. 
Hence the necessity for the continued separation of the Triestine and 
the Italian =, funds. If itnly carmot be prevented from squandering her 
ERP funds, then at least give Trieste an opportunity conscientiously to 
administer the aid funds allocated to her, 
To this end n commisslon of genuine Triestines should bo appointed. 
people who really have the prosperity of Trieste at heart and can be 
expected to administer these funds adequately. in. should then listen to 
thelr advi co.

a'alLis in an intervicav_lia .Belgrade-ex resses disappointrlent..r-All his hopes 
are pinned on Independentism editoria7 
? ? 
Branko Babic, the well-krimm champion of appeasement- and brotherhood, 
has confided to an editor of the "1.:el&ade weekly "Settimana. d'Informazione", 
his hopes and aisQ.ppointincrut with Just touch of optimism here and thore. 
Jftor the usual attack against "comiteormist trochory" he assured 
his Titoist conn.v..de that the party has redeployed to strong positions, 
meaning probably. those in Santa Croce or Bagnoli. - Ho further roiarIzd that 
every day he receives visits from workers who desire to visit Yugoslavia 
(obviously in order to Study the conditions of life therei. but have we not 
sufficient reports from the many refugees who constantly escape across the 
border?) - 
His statement "We are against the annexation of Trio-sto by Italy". 
has the true ring of a credo and -he -added that his party coeporates 'with 
"all the independentists, both with 6tocca'a group and the Sperer -wine* 
Yet whenever we 'stated this fact ourselves, we Were attacked and insulted. 
The editor of Sottimema. d'Informasione then asked whether the rumours that 
the majority of the Italians are opposed to annexation by Italy correspond. 
to facts. Surprisingly enough, this majority is loompletely unaware of the 
feelings attributed to them by these "rumours". Asked about his ?programe, 
Branko Babic repeated all the denands.:(abolition. of -tVo zone. -board tO be 
replaced by a. more democratic "Komando Mesta" bilinguality,. surrender of 
all Italian state property, introduction of workers' councils etc..) ? . 
already proclaimed by him at the popular- assembly in the Rossetti theatre 
in May 1945. -A question he was bard put to answer was how Triesto 
oxist . as on economically independent state. He .could think. of no -better 
reply than to point to the large. nutnba;r of hig,hly skilled Triestine 
workers. As if the. muscles Of 'obi, workers were an asset by themselves 
independent of raw materials, marints, financing and a few Other 'trifles 
of this kindi 
If workers' arms are the only vital requisite how. is it that Yugpslavia, 
where they aboundois so entirely dependent On foreign help that she -owes. 
several billion lire in her- clearing accounts with Italy and that she - 
finds herself compelled to .request Germany .for special terms for t ho 
extension of 4- h0 present. coratercial treaty which- shows a large deficit 
unfavorable' td -.Yugoslavia? 
-In Babic's VI.OLI the assertion that an autonomous Trieste Would be.

An offer (editoriel by-line by Eruno Cerne) 
A public lecture ab out the most important principles on which Trieste s 
economic activity is based has caused the "Ultimo Notizie" and the communal 
coincillor Dense to lose their tempers., Since their remarks concerned me 
personally, I wish to smotr them directly. 
First of I feel g roatly honoured at belonging to the family of 
the "Corriere di Trieste" since it is a democratic ? family, each member of 
which assume s full responsibility for his writings. He must only comply with 
the rules of -b7uth and good, taste expected of any well bred. person. 
As for Dr. Delise, it is not Christian behavi-ur to tell people that 
they are "corn late inierents". I never considered that I was infallible, but 
400orcling to fir. Delis' s article ? began to think, that I should -still be 
smarting under the rebuke I got from ii-e2G. 
Everyone clearly understood that Alvil compelled the Irredentist press 
to admit that the balance deficit refers to one administrative year and not 
to a hell year as they prstended. Thus others have been rebuked, as well as 
oureelves. 
If the irredentists tried to save their faces by misrepresenting the 
facts, that is quite understandable since at times one must do anything to 
keep up appearances. But it is quite urtelievable that Dr. Delis? 
lid not perceive the trickery. Could that be bed faith?' 
I have never held that the "aid (of the Italian treasury) is compensated 
with usury by the foreign currency 'receipts, which the so-called ITT hands 
over to the Rom Government and I never mentioned the word "blackmail".

I simply stated ti-at the allocations supplied by the Rome Governmnt 
aro not an act of "generosity", but are an obliotion under the peace 
treaty. Furth xmore I declared the t these sums are not non.-repayable ? but 
that thoy will be discussed later betdeon Italy and the Government ofi the 
FTT. -3'inally I said that since the 711T has to hand ovor to Rom all 
receipts in foreign mer., y, the local Government is unable to use them f 
our own needs. In fact at every mooting of the mixed commission, AMG. 
found itself compolled to demand :r'rom the Italian Troasury sums, in f roe 
dollars, although to a steadily decreasing extent. 
they__ still smile? (editorial *note) 
? The Mayor's statement on the Trieste flag is a wastorpieee.ef 
hypocrisy, impudence, and falsehood. 
Since Septeliber 194.7 the halberd flag has flown from the -City Hall 
balcony every day. Priviously it was flown only on Special occasions,but 
that was after Triestels annexation by Italy in 1918 when the Trieste flag 
was replaced by the Italian tricolour. 1.7ith the occupation of this territory 
by the Allies, the city Hall .no longer flew the Italian flag because 
,-
according to Art. 5 of Proclamation No. 3, only the British and the American 
flags could be flown on public buildings. 
In September 19117 General iray announced the ?constitution of the PTT 
in his Proclamation No. 1 and the flag of the now State, as specifiod in 
Art. B of the Annex VT to the ;Peace Treaty, was again hoisted* 
while the Lliiod Nilitary Offices gave the place of -honour to our flag 
by potting it botwoen theirs, the City Hall and the Zone Presidoney with-
drew the Allied flags, replacing them with the now State Di) g, i.e. the 
halberd flag. The problem of the flag wa thus settled in accordance with 
the now law, and. General Airey abrogated the above, =DUD-lied:wt. 5 of 
General Alexander's Proclamation No. 3 published on Juno 24th 1945. 
Tho statement that the Commune has a right to safeguard' its symbol 
"a3Dinst political intrigues" is nonsense just like Cammlaratats discovery 
of the continuance of Italian sovereignty over the PTT which amOsod 
the jurists of the world. 
Equally ridiculous is the Mayorts (and that of the lawyors? who advised 
him) request .to prohibit to. (Ahura the use of the Triebto.-flag. It would be 
very convenient to remove it from the ships which carry it around the world. 
But this will not happen, lot our Mayor be assured of that, this Mayor of 
ours who "swore to Observe the national laws still in. force here and those 
emergency orders issued by the Military *Occupation Authorities". 
17c are anxious to know the attitude of the "Military Occupation 
Authorities" (as .11.1G. is milled). "Not even the Gerthans" - said the Mayor - 
"had the courage to abolish the tricolour". From which one gathers that 
ho classos the Anglo-Americans as even worse than the Germans. Of course, 
in 194.3 there was the Stool Pact ?(between Italy, German and Japan), while 
now we have the Peace Treaty of February 2nd. 1947. 
4nyhow, let us see how I;MG safeguards the prestige of tt'a FTT flag and 
their own prestige. Or will they still- smile?

part of tee Venezia Giulia to Tito they wore not revenging themselves on 
Italy but opening the 4;sstes of vrestern Europe to connunist panslassism.

Shows that the Soviets are dotermired not to lose Trieste as a pawn in their

This s only nature].. 't.That calls for some comment, however, is the 
fervour with which "Corriere di Trieste" bewails the reprehensible excesses 
of the Italian polies, without finding one word of blame for those misdeeds 
committed by the Yugoslav police beyond the Morgan line.

All our readers know how Gereral Airey supported the Tripartite Note 
on the return of the ITT to Italy and how ha was liked by the Irrodontists. 
So let us look at his ,Proclamation No.. 1. isoued_on September 16th. 1947; 
"Since Article 21 of ths Peace Treaty between the Allied and Associated 
Powers on one side, and Italy on the other, has come into force, the FTT 
has bo on constituted. 
"Asst.. 2 of Annex VI to the Peace Treaty entrusts to the Sc3curity 
Council of the UN the independence of the ]TT. 
"Art. 1 of Annex VII to the Peace Treaty ?provides that until the 
arrivs:i. of the Governor, the Territory will be administrated. by the Allied 
Militsry Cormands in their rasps ctivs Zones.. 
thsially tlposinted Governor of the PIT takes office, the 
whole s-svernment-3.1 'and administrative authority in that 7,ono of the 71-..rT 
oeouoisA by the .Ain7lo-,,Asericsn troops, together with the ,jusisdicati on over 
its posoll;stion, 1i con-time to belong to me as Cesmander of the said 
Anslo-lonoriosn ns,_litary forces. By this I order thc,t all adrinistrative 
and ju/S'osial employees and 911 other governmental and communal functionaries 
anj ci,-.)Lo?331 as well as Otl officials and employees of public, corrmunal, 
and other institutions, continue to do thsir duty according to the Orders I 
will from time to time issue or which will be issued by officers entrusted 
by me with this 1-sic,?" 
Is Lortoli hinzelf said, among Airey's Orders there is also the Ordas 
pro-v:1411r that to flag of the Trieste Commune with the halberd, be at the 
same tiss:: the flag the i.e. of its Zone A. The Mayor swore Vat he 
would faithfully uphold the legal orders of the Anglo-American Military 
Administration. Tiow he "faithfully upholds" them was shown in his recent 
explanations. Ho not only opposes Orders but calls others not to 
observe thesmi Vie would very much like to know what General Airoyi 
successor, the pcosent Zone I Commander, General Wirrturtun, has to say about 
this.

prior te their arrest received letters and parcels with provocative 
contents whith they immediately handed over to the authorities. 
speci:q, role'in-the inhuman machination of the Bulgarian or;ans 
was played by the Lent provocateur of the Bulgarian State Security 
Service Nurcel Omerevic Mahmat, who was in pribpn since November 1950 
because of theft and ether criminal acts. His trial for these acts 
was t-strime-1 for the sole reason that he might play his dirty role - 
in regard to the fact that he knew the rest of the accused. In c-m-
Pliance with the given instructions, Lurcel"cenfirmed"in a mnst 
unconvincing way earl, item of the indictment, because he.
"was present" 
at ,all these "espionage mgetings" -)f the ether accused with the 
-rficials -f the YugesIav Embassy in 1341,2-yip and served in this we 
as the sole "unchailengea nroor er t e'.anti-Bulgarian" activities 
to the nrganisers of this trial. For his role, Niurcel Omerevic, in 
spite of the fact that his formal cenfessien represents a serious 
crime - he' was rewarded with the smallest sentence and with the Premise 
of the Public Prosecutor that he will net even. 
Besides this the very fact that 45 witnesses were heard in one 
hour and a half clearly speak about the way in which this trial was 
cc nducted. All these witnesses, with the excepti of one, boil down 
their statements to a sievole declaration that they knew the accused as 
Yfgood and_henest mew' witheut mentioning a single item of the indictment. 
Only one witness, Jordan Kolev, wh- had to confirm that he gave to 
/aril Redz.epov and JUija?Kazarova pion material of a military 
nature refused before the curt to repeat his iHrmer statement, 
declaring that pending trial he was"under Particular circumstances", 
rind thus, this witness, instead mf c)nfirming the cerresp'nding item 
,f the indictment in fact tonftmed the way in which were prepared the 
statements -r the rest -r the qorenlants, 
The above-mentionei facts prove n- deubt that the above trial nf 
Yugoslav citizens represents an unsuccessful iulicial farce, which has% 
the eblective of slandering the FPRY and her former liplematic represe-
tatives in Bulgaria ani to exert anther pressure nn the fugs.lev 
citizens in Bulgaria. Such an nct ef the F,ulgarian Trgens represents 
aneth F,h-stile act by the Government of ?Ft 3u1-;-aria a,?;ainst the F,PaY. 
The' result of such a polity is that two inn-cent men have been 
sentenced tedeath. that all human regards have been passed over and that 
it was net taken into account ti-at these men have their tamilies. 
The fact that the Bulgarian press and radio, centrary to the 
hitherto practice - did not bring a single worl about this trial as 
well as the fact that nresence at this trial was Permitted only 
to one member of each of the families 'f the accused; rreves the fear 
of the Bulgarian Government, that such inhuman and illegal acts ef the 
Bul?arian ercrans sh-uld not met with the iustified and 
iis g 
tust -f Buiarian and intornetienal public opinion. I-waver, 
there is'no' d-ubt that such relic- and acts 'of the Bul7nrian Tvernment

DENATIONALIZATION OF SLOVENE SCHOOLS IN GORIZIA 
There are numerous indicatiomthat the existence of Slovene' 
schools in the province of Gori'zia does not suit the Rome Govern-
ment and its representatives in the prefecture of Gorizia affect-
ing the fulfilment of their policy of denationalization applied 
in this region.. They would prefer to turn Gorizia into an Italian 
province at the example of propaganda spread about by the Irreden-
tisV. For this reason exactly, they transferred approximately 4 
thousand exiled Istrians to Gorizia and about 13 thousand in the 
interior of the province. They all now seek bread from the local 
population, although 11 per cent of the people in the province of 
Gorizia. is unemployed. 
As of September. 16, 1947, there were -numerous Slovene schools 
in the. province'of GOrizia with'alarge number of students, so that 
they represented a serious obstacle put in the way of the policy 
of denationalization applied towards the Slovene population.. In 
order to make this policy a suCCess, Itelv could' not avoid the 
introduction of some measures aimed at the frustration of activity 
by Slovene schoolsenolth&ir final removal. To this same effect, 
on January 16, 1950 a decision was passed by. the Minister of 
Education dated January 13,1950 saying that the sons and daughters 
of persona who opted for Italy must stop attending the Slovene 
schools , but join those where instruction is being held exclu-
sively in-the Italia-r1 language. Furthermore, even those children 
whose parents were not of the same nationality but one of them 
was a Slovene were also not allowed to attend any other schools 
Although both of these problems were the responsibility of 
local provincial authorities, they were dealt by the Rome authority 
and in accordance with their aims. Nevertheless, Slovene secondary 
and elementary schools couldnOt be closed down being attended 
by over 150 children. 
In the mean time an intensified pressure began to be exercised 
upon the parents of those pupils who attended Slovene schools wish-
ing to tranfer them from Slovene into Italian schools. This pressu. 
re was especially expressed towards various functionaries and ' 
employees in state agencies. Numerous Such cases were reported 
this year from Standrez, Podgora end elseWhere.

When Slovene people applied. to the authorities for the 
opening of Slovene schools in places where there, wore none, 
the signatories of these applications were threatened by 
policemen whe'searChed-their houses. As .a result in the 
district of Nocnik only. 4 children were enrolled at the local

Students t Club Of GOrizia.including from 80 to 100 members 
attending SlOvene schools. The authorities do not at all ? 
support this society, but even attempt to find an exouse for 
its prohibition. This 'society is supported by the population. 
Slovene kindergartens were also affected by'tho authorities. 
They 'were all 'pit under the administration of ONAIR, an infamous 
organizktion of 'Fascists founded in' 1919 under the auspices of 
the DuChess of Adsta. This organization always played the role 
of grebt:Italian supporters in this province and after.the'World 
War: II its task remained the same. Most of thc personnel employed 
by this Organization is now the same as under the fascist.regime. 
Among other things they introduced the Italian language obliga. 
torily. Therefore the representative of the Slovenes An the - 
Municipal Council protested :against such n decision, but without 
any success, The majority voted against' the Slovene complaint, 
so that even the largert Slovene kindergarten at Standrez was put 
under the administration of ONAIR. This same organization is also 
carrying out the denationalization of thousands of children from

ACTIVITY BY THE CLERGYMAN EGIDIO MICETIC FROM KUKULJANO 
It is quite probable that "father" Egidio considered that 
the seventh commandment did not concern him at all, but only 
his faithful.' Maybe he maintained that it would be quite 
sufficient to confess his sins to himself. Anyhow, it is a 
fact that "father" Ngidio Micetic, 39 years of age, the priest 
at Kukljano, could not hide his malfeasances and thefts from 
the citizens. He was disclosed and brought before the District 
Court of Rijeka. 
In his sermons held at the ch.mh he never failed to ask 
alms and other services from his faithful. 
On one occasion he applied for some wood and obtained per. 
mission from the enterprise "Tuhobic" to purchase 3 cu.m. On 
August 1801951, he made arrangements with a lorry driver to go 
into the woods and collect that firewood in evening. hours. But 
inst,ed of loading 2 cu.m. only having already obtained 1 u.m. 
previously, he asked the driver to load additional 8 cu.m, of 
firewood. This theft was discovered by an employee of this 
enterprise upon their leaving of the woods. The whole case was 
reported to the District Court of Rijeka, The trial. was held 
on January 9,1952 and the clergyman received a sentence of six 
monthst imprisonment. Following an investigation it was found 
out that at his house this clergyman had other 14 cu.m. of fire-
wood and did not at all need the requested quantity. 
Herewith another example of his petty crimes. In July of 
1951 he went together with Kruno Mopajtic and Filippina Micetic 
to collect some honey from beehives kept at Gornje Jelenja. On 
their way there, they stopped to have a drink at a tavern. As 
there was nobody there except one water, he begged Filippina to 
go to the cellar and bring the two litres of wine they asked 
for, After having helped themselves, the clergyman interrogated 
her why she failed to bring along some more wine if there was 
nobody else in the cellar. In this way she could inflict damage 
to nobody since the tavern was state ()Wiled. In reply to this 
Filippina told him that she wondered how it was possible to 
believe in God if a clergyman could suggest such a thing. 
These facts might do for the disclosure of this clergyman 
and his activity. However, we have some more to -offr. In 
October of last year while waiting at the bus station at Cavle, 
he approached Miljenka Tomosini who was also welting for the bus. 
As he noticed that she was young but. that she had bad teeth, he 
proposed her to go and see a dentist. In reply to this Tomasini 
said that she had n.) money to afford for the treatment of her 
teeth. As he had learnt from their conversation that her husband 
worked at an enterprise 7e.n1ing with the sale of firewood, he ad-
vised her to persuade her husband to steel some firewood and bring 
it to him. Upon the receipt of firewood, he promised to give her 
some money for her treatment. .It is more than certain that he woull 
not give the proper price. a The girl die not follow the cler-
!ayrilants advice,but told her husband everything. Later on they made 
the whole case public. 
Gradually this clergyman also became greedy, but when on one 
occasion he asked Stjepan Micetic to prepare a whole 'lamb for him 
he never paid for it pretending that he had no debts to settle.

favourable financial terms and delivery dates the Union will 
buy more tractors than it bought at the beginning of the past. 
month, when number of bought tractors amounted to 2,190. The 
Union expects also to buy a good number of trucks: tractor 
trailers and ploughs. Next month, the Central Union will 
also negotiate purchase of tractors and ploughs which are 
planned for procurement in 1952. 
Tractors bouqht in November are already in our 
country. Two-thirds of tractors have been bought in 'Germany 
and are now distributed to our producing and other agricul.,-
tural cooperatives. Tractors bought in France will be 
delivered to our representatives in a 'few days and those 
bought in Italy very soon. Tractors purchased in England 
will also be loaded on our ships in a! few days time.

,INTRODUCTION OF NEW ORGANISATION OF WORK IN THE PEASANT WORKING 
COOPERATIVES IN CROATIA?THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIRECTORATE- OF 
COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURE OF-CROATIA2IVAN VUKOVIC 2INTERIEWED'BY 
.  
A "BORBA" CORRESPONDENT. 
A "BORBA" correspondent has asked the Director of the 
Directorate of Cooperative. Agriculture of Croatiajvan Vuka7ic, 
to describe to him the experience gained to date in introduction' 
of a strict economy system(1!privredni racun") in the Peasant 
Working Cooperatives of Croatia. 
Q: A new metaod of organisation of work has been introduced 
in some of the Cooperatives in Croatia, What difficulties are 
you encountering in introduction of the new organisation of work ? 
A: The difficulties which we are encountering most often 
stem from the wrong concept of some of our men who deal with.the 
problem of Cooperatives and who have not grasped the eesenee-of? 
the new measures elaborated in the Instructions of the CC CPI . 
"On the future roads of socialist reconstruetion of the countryside", 
Yany are inclined to view the new organisation of work as 
being a pure drive for Trofitable bueiness of economic enterprises. 
We have a fair amount of difficulties resulting from such a view 
of some of the Comrades. They think that it is sufficient to make 
calculationshat it is sufficient to detect how the Cooperative ? 
farms have been working in an uneconomical way,and that now,when 
the shortcoming are pointed out to the Cooperatives,everything will 
be put in order. We have today in Croatia several hundreds of 
calculations made in the Peasant Working Cooperatives,and all these 
calculations give excellent economic conclusions,but,however,we 
have not gone any fruther from those conclusions, Such calculations 
are kept in desk drawers in the offices of the Cooperatives,and from 
there they have not moved any farther, 
Some of the Cooperative leaders however think that with the 
new organisation of work,after the calculations are made ,the following 
should be done; divide the land into small parcels,divide the 
members of the Cooperatives into small groups, and ineide those 
groups,for the sake of personal economic interests of the members 
of the Cooperatives,the parcels of land should be further divided 
--right up to families, Such and organisation would,in their opinion, 
arouse great interest for production such as exists in the,pxei,- ate 
sector. The members of the Cooperatives would give a fixe ta 
of their products into the Cooperative accumulation fund,ar 4the 
rest of the products would remain for thema 
Most frequent cases of wrong concepts we have had in the 
regions of Bjelovar and Zagreb,and even now there are traces of 
them in our republic,

Approved For Release 2001/12/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010600200001-0 
Semelhowever,do not see anything new ,in this 
organisation of work; they consider that such an organisation 
of work had alreadyexisted on government agricultural estates, 
and that it is only necessary to turn in some way the "Trudod'an" 
(daily work classified into categories-Ed.) into wage which 
would be paid out in .one part as a pormanent,guarantted 
part of wage,and the rest as a supplementary wages depending upon 
the final success of the Cooperative. In their opinion,the wages 
should be 'divided into seven categories --similar to the division 
of work into categories under the ?Trudodan" system-- and the 
problem would then be solved. 
Such an idea of organisation of work stems from the 
mistaken opinion that nothing has changed in our economy, that 
managment of economy by the workers is only a pure formality. 
The essential thing,they saylis to make the plan of production, 
make the production costs,fix the wages and fix the quotas of 
sontribution into the Cooperative fund-- and thereby we have 
placed the Cooperative upon the basis of profitability and 
transformed it from a backward into a progressive one. 
In my opinion there are a number of weaknesses here 
and this scaring is the most dangerous precisely for the reason 
that at2 the glance it is similar --and the defenders of such 
ideas are particularly emphasizing this-- to the principles 
outlined in the Instructions of the CC CP Yugoslavia. 
If there does exist a similarity,it is a similarity of 
individualtisolated and separately considered elements. 
We consider that the essential thing for the new 
organisation of work is: profitable working of the Cooperative 
farms and development of new,adequate production relations in 
them--both parallel,simultaneous. 
To establish one--namely the profitable working--and 
to neglect the other--the question of production relations --
Would without doubt feduce the codperative organisation to the 
level of a state-capitalist enterprise; it would reduce it to 
the level of hired-labour relations.

Advantages of the new method of work in peasant working (producing)  
cooperatives 
Question! What are actually those new producing relations that are 
emerging from introduction of the new, method of work? 
Answer: The best I could do, I believe, is if I expound examples, 
manifested in practice, because this conception is from a ? 
theoretical side sufficiently known and clear. First of all, 
new producing relations are'not only emerging from the 
introduction of of the new organization of work in peasant 
working or our producing cooperatives, but they are also 
necessarily making themselves manifest in our factories and 
workshops which are managed directly by our workers. 
Even in the'Communist Manifest", Marx and Engels told us 
that the old bourgeois society will give room to the form-
ation of societies of direct producers, and that the free' 
development of each individual should be a basic prerequisite 
for promotion of community. 
In the old or-fanization of work in peasant working r --t4 
cooperatives, farmers - their members,- have not actually had 
much personal freedom. It is a fact that they often consider-
ed their cooperative farmsetead as sometAing belonging to 
someone else; their work as something enforced upon them, 
and the only thing they considered as their own were trope 
and other things found on their own small personal farms. 
Consequently, the initiative of producers, which was fading 
away, was taken over by individual leaders. They planned 
production, assigned jobs and supervised performance. Under 
such an organization of work, cooperative members dodged 
their responsibilities and conseruently reduced their other-
wise low production. 
. There is a characteristic tendency of avoiding to make 
allocations for sinking funds, and of treglecting cooperative 
property and inventory. . ? ?? 
Such an attitude towards Production comes. as a: result,
erroneously established producing,relations for immediate 
producers-believe that they are notYouners of means of pro-
duction and finished products , while that kind of organizatic 
of work gave them no possibility to realize that their exist-
ence is closely linked with the development of their co-_ 
operative farmsteads. They generally believed that they were 
working for someone else, while their conceptions were, 
supported by the external manifestation of that organization 
of work, because they have been obliged to report at a 
certain time to their group leaders without even knowing 
in advance what they will do during that day. They could not 
leave a job without reporting to their group leaders, and 
all in all, because of such an organization of work, pro-
ducers felt that they are not sufficiently free in their 
actions as free citizens should be. 
As a counterbalance to the basic cooperative masses, there 
are leading cooperative cadres. Faced with members who are 
displaying only a slight interest in their work, these people 
were often rude to them; they recurred to fines expressed in 
reduction of their man-days and in other economic measures. 
Thus, we are witnessing establishment of relations similar 
to those existing in capitalism and even in feudalism. Under

such conditions, the development of the producers' personal 7 
freedom is an unconceivable thin, while the results should 
not differ from those attain,3d by kelkhoSes in the USSR. 
? 
Just because of such producing relations in the USSR, the 
main eMployer, that is, the CC of the CPS(b), is obliged to 
pass at each of its sessipns various provisions with regard 
to the punitive measures and to the on.anizational forms 
leading to the strengthening of working discipline and 
forcina kolkhose members to work. 
In our new organization of 'work, we are paying the greatest 
attention to the euestion of discussing all these problems ? 
with cooperative members on a broad scale. At such discussions, 
farmers are acquainted with advantages of the cooperative 
over individual system of farming. Such explanations are not 
mere voiitical discussions or sujFestions on necessity of 
building 'socialism, No, they are discussing there matters on 
the basis of definitely established accounts and analyses of 
cooperative farmsteads.. Such accounts we are able to establish 
only because we are rid of the bureaucratic method of managing 
our economy and of the old method of husbanding. 
The old method could not convince cooperative members 
that it is more profitable for them to cultivate cooperative 
than individual farms, because no one could'hava,made an? 
account on the baisis of remuneration according to man-days 
which would show them what would be their, share of profits 
in their cooperative after 12 months. Discuasions are not 
different. One'may estimate yields per hectare, compare 
incomes on cooperative and individual farms, and show in,, 
an inequivocable way that the allocations of the part of 
proceeds obtained from surplus production for provision of 
new means Promote cooperative farmsteads and permit co-
operative members to get higher remuneration; They are now 
In position to realize things of which they only dreamt on 
their individual farms. P,y gradually introducing moderm ? 
implements, their work will bo 'less srenous for them. And, 
finally', one can now arrive at an exact comparison o.f equal 
exertions on individual andooperative farmSteads. 'Such a 
comparison will elavs sl,ow one that earnings of cooperative 
members for given efforts will be far greater than those of 
individual farmers, because the work in a cooperative is 
more prOductive than that done on individual farms.

'Furthermore, the acc-unt of all the households in'the el-operative 
is calculated with the heln of all the members of the ce-sperative.. 
Having this account the co-operative community then disnoses with the 
analysis of production expenses, fixes the amount that will be set 
aside for enriching the co-operative, immediately knows how much will 
have to be paid for social centributien and hew much remains for paying 
the wages of the co-operative members. When the amount needed for 
wages is known it is then valued as to whether or not the wages will 
be higher or lower than the earnings by the private peasant, 1-1 when 
the co-operative members are confident that their earnings are higher 
than those in the orivate sectors, this is already a great success 
Lfter this the total sum of the possible earnings must then be 
classified. This job demands special attention. Because;as is known 
earnings are not distributed to the co-operative members according to 
wages or categories of individual jobs, but a certain sum is designated' 
for individual branches production, out of which are paid prflduetion 
costs for Planned articles in the related branch. According to the 
intensity of work in the co-operative the amount of work necessary for 
the given production in each branch is used as a basis for this dis-
tribution. The study of nr-fits is given Precedence an4 so the guiding 
brincirle is profitable prductien. 
The total amount of mediums set aside for the ex-ense fund must be 
distributed ageerding to pre..iuctien branches and if the individual 
branch is large then the distribution is further carried out according 
to small productive plots (ns for example in farming). Distributi)n, 
in the final sense, is carried out in such a way that similar Jobs are 
similarily paid, and on the ethr hand, for the designated exPense fund 
A certain quantity of material goods must be produced. 
In order that the am(unt of the wage fund be accurately distributed 
in advance this phase ,f the work in the new organisation of work is 
very interesting. Now the co-operative members calculate their own 
accounts: For every branch of production and for every plot they know 
how much must be produced and they know how many mediums they will ;et. 
'or the designated production, and on.this basis they calculate their 
Accounts. We had a very interesting example of this at the time the 
strict economic system was introduced in the peasant working ce-
eberative "Keca 7ep'vic" in Dubiea. Here individual groups of co-
operative meMbers. calculated for 10-14 days. the n ssibilities'of 
pr-Auction and eallains for individual co-operative plots and for 
planned branches of preducti-n. The establishment of this ergani-
Batien of work aroused a great interest in nreducti-n. Th-se 
operative
-
operativ2 members who did net Tive any th,utt t) c -enorative prrprty 
previously have now started tr make celculati ,ns about the entire co-
erative. They have started to look around f )r the most interesting 
place in the co-operative to work and to consider the Problem of whether 
Aemeone else in the co-operative is living at their expense. New when 
the members of the co--neratives make their calculations they are putting 
Into them that which no economist or agronomist can put; their knowledge 
of the fields, their detailed knowledge of the quality rf land. After 
WIL4ting such calculations things hanpen which wore ?expected to hannen, 
that more groups of ce-enerative members ere -Hented to th6 same 
plot of land although nrelucti 'n on these perc]ls f land taken as a 
whole is still unprefitable. Juch cases shin!' that the entire sum of 
;he wages fund has not been distributed quite nr,Perly, that in s-me 
Tlaces the work is easier and earnings bigger. Naturally this demands 
correction of the wage fund which would arouse greater interest for 
on the collective farm.

Organisation is further carriedoen? ,in individual groups. The 
0,-,operatj.ve, groups classify their wage PundPind.epodenly withnut 
.any set slassification rules or provisions, - accerdinOtotnividual 
jobs and oloerationson their land'Uocks. .This i do'n'e insuch-a,vay 
se as to assure an equal interest fnr all jobs within the grnuo. , For 
this purpose the groups hive made it a precise to keep one part ef 
the wage fund 88 ti reserve for supplementary payment's for jobs which, the 
' 
co-operative memberd fermerly hesitated to accept; 
In this manner all of the work enerations aod their payments are 
os$ured today. Work in the.co-enerative 5.5 no lenger based on the 
'lour or on the day but it is based on the idea of.c)mpleting the en-
crete work on the designated area of land. Now the co-operative Members 
can accompliSh their work according to agro-technical time neriods and 
in the most favourable manner& ?On individual jobs (mewing, harvesting, 
ploughing) etc.) they use the members of their hAisehold, and on easier 
jobs (gathering hay, weeding, garden work poultry work) they can employ 
physically weak personnel women old men and similar. 
The co-operative members are a let m-re independent tedav. There 
are no longer any roll calls and assignments to work every merning, the 
individual knows best what must be done. Interest in production and in 
work is constantly increasing because earnings are paid immediately 
upon completion of the work. Besides this, wage payments for comnleted 
jobs no longer depend on some co-operative elerk, for as I said, every 
eo-operative group knows exactly hew much er the wage fund goes towards 
its amein of production and they knew how this ameunt is classified 
Per individual ,Iebs. As soon as a job is completed, the co-operative 
members know how much they are entitled to and they then draw a corres-
ponding sum of money from their account (they receive the balance of thAr 
earnings when they deliver the individual products to the co-operative 
w4rehouse). Under such circumstances the earnings of the co-operative 
members no longer depend on the will of the individuals but on their 
work. There are no longer such thigs as existed in the 'trudodanl system 
when someone could, arbitrarily add or deduct 'trudodans'. The co-
operative member no longer works without knowing what he earnel for that 
day, just as there no longer exist possibilities by which he may earn 
Itrudodans( on useless jobs and thereby deprive ethers of earnings who 
have worked on productive jobs. All of this is no longer pnssible 
because normal relations have been established and the expinitation of 
man is no longer nessible. 
I tried to present our new organisation of work to you in detail 
ati in as much as.it was nossible in a practical way, and I hoe.hat 
ail tnat was mentienea very clearly outlines tne pr auetinn relat.ions 
which are necessarily being developed in such an crganisatien of work. . 
In the first place, I think that both forms of socialistic production 
relations: social production and social distribution are quite ebvious. 
It is very clear to see that one producer is connected to another in 
the chain of production, just as it is impossible for any one infivi. dual 
to appropriate the results ?ef another man's work. 
The outward Tanifestation of social work is expressed by the fat 
that, for example, the farmers know that their fields will produce 
better yields if the cattlemen ship more and better quality fertiliser" 
to them and for this reason the farmers carefully follow the work eX tih.e 
cattlemen. They also know that their fields will give better yieelols 
if the tractors arrive on time and plough their fields very well and 
for this reason they carefully check and control the work of the 
.tractor eperators. On the other hand the cattlemen knew that their 
incomes depend en whether or not the fodder will be produced acc:crding 
to the plan and whether it will be loetterr prepared. They watch 
whether or not the farmers mow the grass on time, whether they properly 
dry the hay and hew well they handle silage, etc. Furthennerelsrocial

production and, its outward manif.estati n b)il down to social control, 
and now members who formerly were disinterested in production are 
be-
coming very active co-operative memberswho are crnscious of nrnduction 
and who guard co-operative *pr-perty as if. it was their very own. , 
Stealing from co-operative fields is no longer a theft of some 
stranger's property whose existence did not interest the co-onerative 
members; the shortage of pr-)ducts from co-operative fields hurts the 
co-operative groups whose earnings are based )n the amount of products 
they deliver to the co-operative wareh-,uses. As a result of this, in 
place of only a number of guardians wh- were chiefly the co-operative 
leaders, hundPeds and th ,usands. of them are being created and they 
protect co-operative property and every one of them pro-4ects the results 
of their werk? 
The co-operative mem.Dr who undertook the socia,. obligation that for 
a said amount of the wage funihe would produce a certain amount of 
pr-ducts conducts himsif altogether differently than the co-operative 
member who gets a certain wage for his work and whose interest in'the 
job he is doing ends the moment he drops the tools from his hands.

Past experience in introduction of thc strict economy syitem 
n roatia. 
Q1 What other experiences have been gained in introduction 
of the new organisation of work in the Peasant Working CoOperatives ? 
A: There is a lot more to, be said. In the first place,those 
Comrades who are engaged on introduction of the new organisation 
of work should not think that this can be done in a Cooperative 
in 10 to 14 days. 
Furtherlone should realize that the making of calculations 
is the easier part of the job which is followed by a more difficult 
onetand that is detection of the old production relations and a 
persistent Struggle for their complete liquidation.and replacement 
by new ones. This second phase-when the members of the Cooperative 
have themselves make the calculations,when they have to conduct 
broad discussions,realistic and concrete discussions--is much more 
diffj.cult,and it is particularly important and demands the most 
time. Ideas concerning managment of the Cooperative have to be 
exchange here. A really revolutionary change of turning those 
Cooperatives which contain State-capitalistic and feudal elements 
in themselves into progressive socialist enterprises has to be 
done here. Where this does not succeed, we shall not achieve 
anything in the Cooperative and in that case the calculations 
of profitability will not be of any use to us and the result will 
be that in the respective Cooperative things will remain just as 
they were. 
One should -know that the new organisation of work demands 
broad discussions in every direction. The members of the Cooperatives 
often "stick to the old" and defend the old methods of work;they 
are not inclined to undertake certain risks which every members 
of the Cooperative should undertake as -a direct producer and partner 
in the Cooperative. 
At the aame time this is a strugf71e againtt variousnenemies, 
ranging from those who have been basing their lives upon 
exploitation of others and all the way along the line up to 
the political enemies who see that the new organisation of work 
ties the peasants--members of the Cooperatives -- to the 
Cooperatives, and who see that this means a consolidation of 
the cooperative organisation and consequently a victory, for 
socialism in the countryside. All the enemies are quickly 
realizing this and are waging an actiVe strugg,le against our new 
measures. .For this reason it is important that the Party 
organisations should,through daily meetingslfollow up the events 
in step. The new organisation of work should be explained to 
the members of the Cooperatives through. the managments of the 
Cooperatives,through the Party organisations and through the 
People's Front organisations;the hostile propagandd should not 
be allowed to gain ground for a single moment.

Q: What,in your opinion,are the most important economic 
conclusions_msilting from the new organisation of work ? 
A: In the first place I should like to emphasize the fact 
that we have ascertained by detailed analysis that a shortage 
of labour force does not exist in the Peasant Working Cooperatives 
but on the contrary that there is a perceptible surplus. On the 
basis of this fact we are,in introducing the new organisation 
of work,making.two production plans: one with the hitherto 
intensiveness of production which requires less labour force, 
and another one with a greater intensiveness of production which 
needs more labour force. We are applying the first plan in the 
case where in a Cooperative there are such members who are not 
interested in production. We do not count on such people,and 
the zealous members of the Cooperatives also don't like to work 
with them. We give them time to think over and decide. In those 
Cooperatives where we have introduced the new organisation of 
work, there is no more chance for the loafers to do nothing and 
to live on the properties of thp? Cooperatives by appropriating 
other peoples's things and by stealing. Under the old organisation 
of work, every member of a Cooperative was able to use the 
transportation vehicles of the Cooperative for almost nothingland 
the food was often divided by the number of persons: Many of the' 
members of the Cooperatives succeeded in getting from the 
Cooperative food for their households--either on account of sickness 
in the family or on account of old age; they sueceeded tn dode;ing 
wont in various ways and at the same time appropriating the' 
property of the Cooperative. This is no longer possible because 
in a Cooperative the transportation and other vehicles are used 
on the basis of economic prices and no more food and other products 
are divided among the members of the Cooperatives. Everythihg is 
bought for ready cash,also at economic prices,and so individual 
members can stay out only for a .short time--until they feel that 
they cannot live without working. When such individuals decide 
to work in the Cooperative.,? they are not included in the already 
formed working groups. Production ,then intensified according 
to the number of them who have reported for work,and so they are. 
working on new useful jobs which enable them to earn their normal 
amount and to make, the corresponding contribution to the accumulation 
fund of the Cooperative4 
consider this to be an important experience in aprlication 
of the new organisation of work. 
Further, we have ascertained that a number of Cooperative 
have too many.hauling teams. According to our calculations, one 
hauling team tcan work 250 days in a year--working on the fileds 
belonging to the Cooperative or working on the plots af land 
belonging to individual members of the Cooperative("Okucnica"-
homestead)r- and we have discovered that a good many of the hauling 
teams of the Cooperatives are hardly making 100 useful working days 
in a year, This means that in each of such Cooperatives, one half 
of the hauling teams is excess. Taking that one hauling team 
costs the Co)perative 100,000 to 150,000 Dinars a year, it means 
that in those Cooperatives which have- 50 excess hauling teams the 
expenses amount to 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 Dinars annually--and this 
reduces the earnings of the members of the Cooperative and the 
accumulation fund of the Cooperative by the same amount. This often 
is the cause of loss in a Cooperative.

Another thi4 Which we have discovered in introduction 
of the new Organisation 'of work is that a number of Cooperatives 
have bought 'unnecessary 'quantities of mechanized implements. 
Thus2for exaplepthe Peasant Working Cooperative "Kcca'PoPovic" 
in Dubica has b)ught 7 tractors while it needs only 4. The 
Peasant Working Cooperatiye "Bblja Buducnost"(.Better Future-Ed) 
in Brodjanci also has 7 tractors, whilelin my opiniontit does 
not need more than 3 or 4. Unnecessary tractors reduce the 
possibility of work for the necessary tractors--all the tractors 
- are working, and none is sufficiently utilized. In all such cases 
regular losses on tractors can be ascertained. 
I should also mention the fact that,in the mainlour 
mechanization is being poorly' utilized, Thus ,forexamplelwe have 
a few dozens of first-class ANSALDO tractors. The tractors,which 
can pull six-gange ploughs,are used to pull three-gang e ploughs. 
It is obvious that this is an enormous loss in the process of 
production. We have very few other machines .which can be hooked 
to tractors,so that the tractors are uied only for ploughing. 
All these shortcomings are being uncovered now and it is 
necessary to Pliminate them. 
Furthermore2it is n)w being established that in some cases 
the "wealth" of the Cooperative had in fact been only an illusion 
of the members of the Cooperative. It is so in the cases when 
"wealth" is measured by the number of horses,traetors,and big 
objects etc,while it can be truly said that excess horses or 
tractors are a burden rather than an asset to a Cooperative. Large 
and uneconomical buildings are no good because keeping of 
livestock in them is very expensive--they cost more than the 
livestock produced in them is worth. 
All these are experianc-ed gained in introduction of the new 
:organisation of work, . 
At the Plenary Session of the CC CP Croatia you spoke about 
the existance of possibilities for increasing livestock breeding 
and poultry rasing after introduction of the strict economy system. 
,Can you tells us something more about this subject ? 
A: It is quite so. Many housewives and old men cannot leave 
their blames. but are willing to work and are seeking possibility 
for that. Thinking about this ,we have come to the conclusion 
that a Cooperative,after introducing the strict economy system, 
'could make contracts with individual households in the Cooperative 
to keep in their stables or yards a fixed number of livestock or 
poultry belonging to the Cooperative. We have already tried this 
and the result has been that very soon some of the Cooperatives 
have doubled their livestock fund,

ThiSJis useful for both the Cooperative and the 
indiVidOlimembers of the Cooperative. Tery often a Cooperative 
cannot.iricrease.its livestock fund without making new investments 
(building new stables). The members of the Cooperatives can, 
after finishing their work in the 'filedS,look after livestock 
belonging to the Cooperative and thus earn more. Consequently, 
it is in.the interest of both the Cooperatives and their 'members 
to .carry on this system. ? 
It is the same case with the poultry belonging to the . 
Cooperatives. In addition to thistwe haVe introduced the practice 
of giving to the households plots of land their their homes 
where they can grow various vegetables. Good vegetable seeds are 
thus obtained. 
All this shows that the new organisation of work gives 
us possibilities for increasing production by the Cooperatives 
and thereby also improving the welfare of the members of the 
Cooperatives as a whole.

SHORTSIGHTEDNESS OF SOMETHING ELSE  
One meets from time to time ttDugh rarer nowadays - people 
with whom one speaks and after a while dne comes to think, if 
this particular person has slept through the last ten--years 
and is not conscious of events and changes which have taken place 
and - one feels like telling him - wake up man Then there are 
men who did not gain any experience in the bygone years or - perhaps 
- do nat wish to recognise this experience ? 
One conceives similar ideas ' F. in one's mind when one reads 
through': the article written by former USA ambassador in former 
Yugoslavia Mr.Arthur Bliss-Lane and published in the American weekly 
magazine Saturdy EveninD. Post The essence of this article by the 
former ambassador is a regardless and baseless criticism of the 
official American policy toward present Yugoslavia, a policy which 
enjoys the support of American citizens.14.. Bliss-Lane emphasizes 
that he was always antagonistic to a policy of giving help to Yugo-, 
slavia in any form whatsoever ( except in +.1-^ case of the drought ) 
and that such a policy is a " calculated risk " to the USA. He 
demands that a stop should be put to this policy, and as the Wteic 
reason for his attitude, he underlines only one thing : Yugoslavia 
is a " communist country " in which " there is no democracy " of 
course and similar. In short : Yugoslavia, because she has not chosen 
its internal order according to the tastes of Mr.Bliss-Lets regard-
less to all other conditions, and for this sole and exclusive reason 
should hot be given either economic or military aid 1 and - con-
sequently - Yugoslavia should not be helped in strenghtening her de-
fensive potential, namely her capacity to resist successf11117 the 
potential aggressor to whose pressure she has been exposed for years. 
On the whole this is the logic by which Mr. Bliss-Lane expresses all 
his points of view. 
Let us see how the things stand in fact. If we set aside all that 
which in the newsman's jargon is called " dressing " and take the 
essenee of this article,that which is vital, that which the article 
is meant to expressl then it is : I demand you to stop further akd to 
Yugoslavia 1 This is demanded at the moment, when it is recognised 
generally in the West and particularily-An the USA, that this country 
- which is the pillar of Peace in the Balkans - should be helped, 
beeause this demand the joint interests of the struggle against 
aggression in the framework of the 'United Nations. Mr. Bliss-Lape 
boils the whole discussion to some so called ideological terrain, but 
is in fact only an attempt to veil the problemIto present things in 
a way which might succeed with some Americansto whom the word 
"'commtntst " ( and in the USA some attempt to identify the word 
" communist" with - Soviet imperialism ) awakens resistance and un-
easiness. But that which remains, that which is most essential, lies 
In the fact that Mr.Bliss-,Lane. recommend:- that " risks " should not 
be taken with that which contributes to the strenghtening of the de-
fensive potential of Yugoslavia.. 
It is hard to define, how ebilla looking at things - the least said 
is shortsighted and how little it takes into account the real situation 
and circumstances, certain mutual interests of all those who are 
unanimous ( united ) on one question : to resist - together and with 
all strenght but also individually with maximum energy - the aggressor, 
Let it be so,- the Americans help us, but do we not help them and all 
those who are striving to defend peace through resisting aggressive 
pressure coming from the East ? Yugoslavia has already shown on many 
occasions that she knows how to defend her independence and freedom, 
Practically Yugoslavia is to-day resisting actively aggression. Can one 
personito whom the interests of Peace areYabote all, be indifferent

if Yugoslavia should be still more capable for defence and its 
both economic and military potential still greater ? - Do waist 
really " ideoloZieal " reasons by Which' th-1,8 ttttde ean be 
fed whipmh means ih its esSence- the weak I 
ng of the Peace front 
and' defehOS;fxem aggression from the East ? Did Mr. Bliss-Lane, 
thinkebout this or not, or for example, that thjo ,nbjectivel7 
may h? wish this or not, drives the water onto the mill of Moscow ? 
And what 'does otherwise T:rtan to weaken the one who is preparing for 
defence in case of attack, than., helping the one who is preparing to 
attack?'. 
After all, it is vey symptomatic that similar tendencies have 
gained publicity in the columns of the Mancl-e,-ter Guardian only the 
" dressing"was different, The.millAgry.vorrespondent of this newspaper 
published from Belgrade an article a short time ago in which,he stressed 
that it would be " dangerous " and " wrong " to furnish Yugoslavia 
with heavy armament, and explained this attitude with all sorts of 
military " arguments ". When our public optC:on reacted with revolt 
to this article the writer published another article a few days ago 
in which he affirmed the same things as in the previous article ,He is 
no doubt a persistent man. This is what he proves : Yugoslavia should 
not be given heavy armament / because she would not know supposedly 
how use it. It is quite unnecessary to .n:217 v,:o.saoh nonsense, at 
least to their"military" aspect, for the simple reason because these 
" arguments " are ridiculous and illogic, because our Army - when 
she was much worst trained - nullified them a long time ago. It is 
an extremely well-known fact and of this The Manchester Guradian  
correspondent is anyhow well aware aflthat our Army is capable and how 
to resiorti lu.-,orsitully the aggressor. 
This, as well as we, the " military " correspondent of this paper 
knows.And yet he writes that we should not be given heavy armament 
By what motives is he inspired ? Certainly not ;:.7 111-ittentiozon and 
particularily friendly ones towards our country., At least it is diffi? 
tult, partieularily if one takes into consideration, that he again 
insists on these " arguments " to believe the contra..;.y? It is more 
probable that this is the echo of certain conceptions which do not 
take into account real circumstances, which do not know to differen-
tiate between wishes, hopes and realities? Because, can the Manchester 
Guardian's_ ',,mf:l_itary " correspondent think that we cannot comprehend 
t he means by recommending us to withdraw to the mountains and there 
shed blood; does he think that this would be the way that later others 
MightAecide about our fate ? But does he rct perceive ( or wishes not 
to so ) that with his attitude he helps directly the enemy not only 
of Yugoslavia, but of his own country and -eace in general ? 
This is a shortsighted policy. And is it only shortsighted.;.,? 
Justifiably one can say : is it only shortsightedness or something 
more than that ? 
We do not affirm that there exists a direct connection between the 
article by former 2.10-,..Lan ambassador in Belgrade and the present 
" military " -AA7cho Gtardian'correspondent in Belgrade, Very far 
from it,But the internal, logical connection between these two articles 
does exist; exists objectively. We are pointing out this occurrence as

LETTER FROY LONDON: THE BRITISH PRESS ON THE RESULTS OF WA3HINGTON  
(London, 10th January) 
The meeting Of the two leading -festern statesmen was followed in 
Britain with. particular attention. However much one always stresses 
treditf,nr,1 rriendship with America there are many world problems 
upon which both London and Washington look from different angles, 
The alifrt,observers of international events were most interested in 
what measure a better understanding will be reached I* personal talks 
between the two statesmen. 
If in the columns of the British press and in comments amk)ngst 
newspapermen one should seek an answer to this question, it comes out 
that most cf them agree more or less that the statement which has been 
given out after the Washington talks is encouraging. According to 
this statement the use-of bases in Great Britain in case of necessity 
"will be a matter of mutual decision by the British and American 
Governments": both governments "will continue to give full support to 
the efforts of setting up a European defensive community"; as far as 
the Near East is concerned there is "a full identity of pints of view"; 
in the Far East "broad harmony"; in negotiations concerning raw 
materials "good progress has been made", and in discussion concerning 
a common rifleonneither of the two countries considers it sensible 
that in these critical times momentary steps be taken to change the 
rifle": and finally concerning the Atlantic Command "it is still 
being discussed". 
But ag the commentators strive to discover also practical mean lea,g 
for these- harmonious phrases it comes out that the Washington state-
ment should not be taken as too-encouraging. It is evident that the 
Far East is covered with the broadest phrase and in connection with 
this the Daily Telegraph demands "Dbes this mean that both the 
countries have agreed to continue their different viewsconcorning the 
recognition of China and Formosa? If it is so in what consists the 
greater harmony than it was before". 
However, it seems that the English are mostly worried about the 
situation of raw materials, particularly in regard to steel. Although 
the momentary British lack of steel amounts only to 1.5% of the total 
American production - the USA produces 100 million tons rarly, 
Britain 15 million tons, some are doubtful about the fact whether the 
USA would be capable of putting aside this quantity for her Ally, the 
moreso because the USA also feels the lack of steel, because American 
armament swallows up 50% of the American steel production. 
And above all through the columns ?of the British res rms tp, 
the fore the uncertainty, in regard to the political situation of the 
USA 'prior to the new presidential elections and more or less one 
senses the question if the attitude of the USA will have the same 
character towards Europe after these elections. 
According to the Times the British people consider as Churchill's 
real results.Pbtained in Washington in the first place that "Churchill 
has convinced the Government of the USA that the British support of the 
European Army must come from outside". So the Britons thitk,that the 
direct participation of BBritish military units in the European Army 
has been taken off the agenda. Observers here consider it as 
important that Churchill has most probably succeeded in his attempts 
that the voice of Britain should be more listened tb on the-other side 
of the ocean because the enormous volume of American armament - the 
production in this field was in the past year three times greater than 
in 1950, and the sum of 16 billion dollars, which was spent in 1951, 
will this year be doubled according to Truman's words in congress -

"brings in its wake the answer and American friends as well as their 
enemies must ask themselves how it will be used" - comments Time. 
That enftpart of the statement was particularly well received in 
which it is said that the Atlantic community is not built"oply -for 
momentary defence but for furtifer progress". The British commen-
tators interpret this as the American confirmation that the co-opera-
tion in the defence of Europe will be of first class importance and 
that one sees in it a better 'American understanding for "the-ola 
world", and while understanding grows there is a basis for n firmer 
alliance This seems to be the general echo in the press.

THE DRAGGING OUT OF NEGOTIPIlIONS IN KOREA  
Six months have passed since the beginning of, negotietions in 
Korea. The case-fire so far has.. not been -realised...- .Altheugh wsr 
continued ?in Korea the very fact that negotiatione.have.begun had a 
calming af.rect. But guring ttleepe:s:t Six months this opanion has. changed 
and the opinion prevails that it wfll b necessary to make great .efforts 
and that it will take a long time to set up peace in, Korea., 
? 
If one looks at the agenda of ,the tAlks e begun in Kaesong and 
continued in Pan 'Nun 'Jong one gets the impression that .the basic con-
flicting items have been put aside and that the remaining questions 
.coUld be 'solved in a' few: hoU14.s. ' After reachin& an -agreement on the 
' main problem - concerning the demarcation line for the cease fire it 
seems that the truce was near at hand. Yet in spite of that 'e,he nego-
tiations continued for week e although the two remaining conflicting 
items are qimulteneously discussed in two Sub-Committees. This is the 
problem- of the controleof the arMisti,ce andetne .exchange of prisoners 
of war. Slowness is the characteristic of this 66hfeeoh-06 'Which will 
enter into, the history of wars as one of the longest truce ' parleys.. 
Thiseslowneeeewould' not disturb anybody if . after .a .six months prolongation 
the Oospects .of success would be, clearer than presented by the last two 
sessions. ? 
? 
The trude practically dePends' on the fact . of whether Kobla will 
be ensured that 'e : aggression will not be repeated...The.% after 
suppressing aggression coming from North Korea, demand that-the opposing 
- side's should accept -reasonable artistice- conditiona. However, the ? 
North Korean and bhinoae- delegations during the negotiations hitherto, 
attempted persistently to present themselves as a , side: which, has the 
- right, to: dictate, , to ;flake' conditions end fOroa, oonoes4ons e in spite of 
the . fa'ct that this , 'side was ' ?' the aggressor,whQ has disturbed 
peace and who must bear the 'conse,quences. Charactriti-c is the 
writing of .the official Chinese TgenCy*which ih the last few days 
demanded that the ,UN 'should "recognise the equilibrium of. military - 
forces!' :in Korea. This demand, as well he the tore of the Chinese 
press, particularly that of the  PeoiiieS daily and the speech of the 
' Chinese commander in Korea, point out that Peking'at this moment 
conceives in these negotiations only a favourable occasion to obtain 
better and firmer positions than it had at the beginning of the negot-
ietions. Therefore the negotiations seem . endless. Thqemoment a 
conflicting problem is nearing solution, the Chinese-North Korean 
delegation puts out another - and this geme looks like a hundred-headed 
Hydra who grows anew head each time one is severed. This prolongation 
is in the interests of behind the scerb, currents which exist North of 
the 38th parallel North of the River Yalty and North of the Manchurian 
-
Soviet frontier, currents which have not yet settled their mutual 
eccountz and arrangements concerning prestige and spheres of influence 
in tne _o'er est. 
There are signs that these negotiations between Moscow and Peking 
are not running smoothly. The lest cause for such opinion was given by 
Vishinsky in Paris when he demanded recently from the UN to bring up the 
Korean problem before the Security Council. In that case the USSR would 
again take a more nrominent pert in the solution of the Korean problem 
bind ctuld use also it,s v-'11;r ilthough this manoeuvre hes failed it has 
been rociced that Loscoh ul'ies to take the place so far held by Peking 
also in the direct solution of the Korean crisis. 
This, however, does not still mean that the negotiations are 
nearing an end. Between tha three possible solutions the greatest 
-orospects are for the continuation and prolongation of negotiations. 1. 
By presenting and inventing new confli e.ing items Moscow and Peking 
strive to keep the tension until in the developtene Of the international 
situation do not appear some new moments which would introduce into the 
Korean problem some new details. Under such conditions tl-e role of the 
UN is confirmed,in a sensible and patient discovery of a solution to e 
cease-fire lies the only way that the TIN, after supressing the armed 
pressure of the aggressor? slior.rass 21.147 A iso his diplomatic combina-

RIVER NiAVIGLTION  
In Belgrade yesterday, in the presence of Austrian, German and 
Yugoslav experts on river navigation, the work of the first post-war 
international conference on Danube river navigation began. At this 
conference many pressing questions will be decided in connection with 
the renewal of the co-operation and friendly relations which 
traditionally exist between those who sail -n the Danube.' 
At this Belgrade conference which is Of very great economic import-
ance, the representatives of the three Danube-countries will consider 
the present situation on the Danube and will come to useful and con-
structive decisions which will provide a basis for the further advance-
ment and development of Danube traffic. In the first. niece this 
conferende is expected to organise traffic which, in tie new conditions 
on the Danubian ifternational 'waterway, will speed up the exchange of 
goods and the renewal of the economy of these countries, ruined during 
the war. Besiqms this, it will resolve ciuestions of tariffs, 
freight regulations in river transport, as well as the nromotion of 
mttual co-operation, (TafOug)

ISLAND IN THE nuRA - THE 3GENE OF THE  LATE 3T Me3T SERICU3 Pl't0VOCATI,DN 
BY THE HUNGAiinN C:)MINFeAMISTS  
(Letinski Most, 31st December) 
Our island in the Mura, which was seized by Hungarian soldiers 
ten days agel-has no name. It is nameless and is not marked on many 
geographic'mars., The island is not even marked on the early edited 
special military maps on which every path, house? bridge and mill is 
carefully marked objects far smaller and less imnortant than the 
island - and maps on which ?the other parts of the Zaira are dotted with 
many smaller islands; but the island locate 700 metres northwest from 
the Letinski Most is not on the mans. The island is not even marked on 
the precise land maps drawh ? in 1930 and which are now being presu-ved 
in Trelog, and on which the property boundaries of each peasant in 
Goricani is precisely marked. By de jure, the island does hot exist. 
This island is not mentioned in the record of the boundary limits 
of the Trianon Peace Treaty of 1920, which was the basis for the Paris 
Peace Treaty of 1947 which fixed the boundary linesInor in any other 
detailed record of boundary lines. 
There is no official document since 1920 by which this piece of 
land can be shown to belong to Hungary, Since the 1920 demarcation 
there have been only two 'attempts to destroy this status - both of 
these attempts have been tried by aggression; In April of 1941, when 
this piece of land and other parts of Medjumurje were occupied by 
Horthy's Fascists and on December 20th, 1951. This is.whot was, 
written in the daily record of 'the watchtower at Letinski Most about 
the second attempt: 
"At 7;30 a.m. we noted a groVf) of Hungarian soldiers, numbering 5, 
who crossed from their side over to our 'island", 
A Premeditated Act, Long -lanned' 
This insolent provocation, hitherto the most serious violation 
of Yugoslavia's integrity, was very 6-carefully planned Some time ago as 
can be established from the scene of the provocation. Along with the 
previously destructed part of the Letinski Bridge (which was destroyed 
by the Hunprian authorities, this past summer after frequent escapes by 
the Hungarian citizens) there isl.judging by the standing walls, the 
jutting remains of what was once a large a beautiful building. Seven-
teen days ago telis buildin- served as a home for a group road 
maintenance woracers, on the 14th December the occupann or the building 
were moved out, the roof removed, and then on 20th December, the day 
the Hungarian soldiers seized the island, the blinding was completely 
demolished. Additional proof that this provocation was premeditated is 
shown by the fact that on the same day on the Hungarian side of the 800 
metre wide river bank, a network of trenches with machine gun nests and 
grenade launchers were dug out along the earlier reinforced barbed wire 
entanglements. The island was also reinforced that same day.. M'ahine 
gun nests were dug and the barrels are pointed towards our country and a 
telephone system was installed. All of this could not have been done 
in one day with only a handful of border guards. The provocation was 
long planned - this is reflected by the circumstances under which it 
was carried.out. While the Ministry of War prepared the plans, 
attested by the troops and weapons on the island, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs prepared a Note which was immeliately delivered after 
the machine gun emplacements were dug. 
A View from the River Bank  
From our river bank you can 'see the occupied.island. It is 300 
metres long and about 150 metres wide, and is very densely forested. 
This ''island is separated from the mainland by a stretch of water 40 
metres wide and in some places, especially on the southern tip, this 
stretch of water is not wider than 30 metres. Due to heavy rains

? 
? 5 ? 
in the last few dayS the Mura diver raised and this increased the depth 
of this stretch of wPter to about 2 metres. When the river level is no 
normal the denth of this stretch of water is considerably smaller. sia 
the northern tip of the island you can very plainly see how this . 
stretch of water separates from the main body of the river, which 
flows on the north-eastern side, between the island and the Hungarian 
border, and which is a lot swifter and deeper than its branch. From 
the northern tip of the island you can plainly see the difference in 
the widths between the Bura River and its branch. The Mura is about 
100 metres wide in this section, twice as wide as its branch. Along 
the entire coast of Yugoslavia you can see the sandy banks of this 
waterway. This water has been washing the Yugoslav coast, which is 
considerably lower than the HUngarian coast. On this small stretch of 
water there are a number of smaller islands and peninsulas in the 
process of being formed. This is due to the fact that the Hungarian 
coast is a lot more firmer and the force of the river is beating the 
Yugoslav coast. In this manner the Mura River has flooded hundreds of 
juters of land in the past 10 years. 
Even without field glasses it is easy to spot the machine guns, 
and it is very easy to observe the movements of the soldiers on the 
island, and especially the movement of boats from the Hungarian main-
land tc) the island. If you leok very closely you can see two linea 
that link the island with the Hun3ar3An mainlnnlia.? The higher me is 
the telephone line and the other one is stretched out to facilitate 
easier crossings for the boats. You very frequently can see officers 
on the island too. Elie can also hear the sound of axes and falling 
trees . the invaders are cutting down trees on the island. 
Here is what a border guard has to say: "I was up in the watch-
tower and it was a very foggy morning. About 7 o'clock I noticed a man 
moving about on the island, A little later, when the.fog lifted, I 
recognized the man to be a Hungarian soldier and at the same time I saw 
a boat, loaded with four more soldiers, land on the bank. These land-
ings took place thw whole day." 
The Feople who had their Land Taken Away from Them  
The inhabitants of the nearby village of Goricani went to t:he 
bridge with an interpreter and asked the Hungarian soldiers to movte en. 
one of the Hungarian guards then entered a guardhouse and in all 
probability telephoned for instructions. He returned but did net give 
any answer. Even our border guards asked the provocateurs t6 move away 
from our coast but they had no intention of moving. Very arrogantly 
and cynically they kept yelling that they "came for a picnic? and that 
the "island was theirs" and that they. "like the Mura". 
Andro Cavlek, Josip Vugrinec, Stjepan Vrazic, 'Stjepan is and 
other land owner p on the island from the town of loricani were felling 
trees for two days, the lath and 19th, on the island. That morning 
they sould not resume their work on the island where they left their 
tools. 
The people of Goricani - a town .with 5,000 inhabitants and the 
largest village in the 'relog district - sharply condemned this insolent 
provocation which happened four kilometres from :their village. The 
people who spent practically all their lives in this village working on 
their fields and meadows which are located near the border - know every 
inch of this land. The land on this island was bought tly a majority of 
the landowners during the period from 1925 to-1930. This was arable 
land and formerly belonged to Sander Andrasij, a Hungarian feudal lord. 
All the present day owners have buying-selling contract documents which 
were certified by the eadPstre administration of Prelog at that time: 
This is further evidence that since 1920, Rungary did not have anything 
to do with this land.

Andre Cavlek, a miller, lived here on the bank near the Letinski 
Most for 13 years. He owned a mill from 1926 to 1939. The work of the 
mill depended on the river and for this reason he knows all of her 
tendencies and behaviour. Hp said: "There was no island in 1930, and 
subsequently? by degrees from year to year, this tributary stream was 
created and it became wider and wider: the depth remained unknown and 
today, when we went to fell trees we thought oP crossing and trans-
norting the trees with horses", 
*.v***** 
30 metres from the spot where the Hungarian machine guns are set 
up On'the island there are two large waterwheels on our coast that are 
constantly revolving. These wheels never stop for they keep milling 
grain which is brought td the mill by the peasants from the nearby 
villages. Here, in full view of the Comin-formist aggressors, quietly 
and without getting excited, they work,for,they and our border guards 
who are constantly on watch know that even this provocation cannot 
frighten the men who know that truth is on their side.

THREE BULGARIAN  BOYS ESCAPE TO YUGOSLAVIA  
(Belrrrade, 2nd January) 
Eight days ago, on the 25th of December last year, Bulgarian 
boys Golo Coley, born 1936: Rasa Ivanov Rasov, born 1937: and Nikola 
Stojanov, born 1937 crossed the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border at Zajecar 
and reported to the Yugoslav authorities. The youngsters were 
immediately given proper accomodatidns. 
The boys stated that they came from the village of Izvor-
Mahala in the district of Kula, and that they are third grade students 
inthe junior gymnasium. They escaped from Bulgaria because they 
were mistreated by the teachers. 
It is very interesting to note that as yet the Bulgarian 
authorities have shown no concern about the fate of the youngsters. 
The people's authority of Yugoslavia, guided by the 
principles of humanity and international law, decided to return 
these minors to their parents. In this respect the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Bulgarian Embassy in 
Belgrade. This note proposed that the Bulgarian authorities 
designate a spot on the Yugoslav*Bulgarian border, the time and 
the method, which would suit their taste, for returning the 
youngsters to Bulgaria.

Comrades People's Deputies, you have heard the exposition 
of Comrade Kidric. In my name and in the name of Comrade Josip 
Hrncevic, President of the Legislative Committee of the Federal

This Assembly has passed in 1947 the Law on Five Year. Plan, 
and its annual plans, being in the jurisdiction' of the'Government 
have not been brought before the Assembly. For the first time, in 
the spirit of the new Law on planned management of national economy 
? the National Assembly will have to discuss ths first 
Fe("aial social plan. However, we are already at tne tnreshold of 
the year for which this plan is valid and the Government wantst and 
we too, that this Draft plan should go first, under the provisions 
of the Law which we have to-day accepted, to public discussion, to 
the discussion in Natioanl Assemblies, working councils, etc. 
Therefore,in front of us lies a period of three months to complete 
the discussion and at the end of this period, the Assembly should 
pass the Law on annual Federal ,social plan for 1952. 
I would,with comrade Hrncevic submit the following:

DRAFT RESOLUTION 
-
I. The Government of FPRY is mithorized to execute temporary, 
until the Law on economic plan of FPRY for 1952 is passed, the Federal 
social plan od the basis of the Draft social plan of FPRY for 1952, 
which the Government handed to the National Assembly on the 28th 
of December 1951. 
II. The Government of FPRY will hand the Draft social plan 
of FPRY for 1952, in conformity with the Art;21 of the Law on 
planned management of national economy, for discussion and remarks 
to national assemblies of People's Republics, to working councils 
of economic associations, economic chambers and Federal and Republican 
agencies of syndicate and co?operative organizations. 
III. The Government of FPRY will submit the Draft law on 
social plan of FPRY for 1952 to the National Assembly, that is to 
committees for economic plan and finance in due course so that the 
National Assembly can before the end of March 1952 accept the Law 
on social plan of FPRY for 1952. In addition to the Draft law the 
Government will submit necessary documentation as well as those 
opinions and remarks of competent bodies and organizations which 
have not accepted it. 
I.V. The Draft social plan of FPRY for 1952 has to be - 
published iMMediately for its publ.lo discussion. ' 
? ? ' . COrades, in connection with this I would like to. prapose 
anoth'er' r'66olUtion, -which deals with the Draft budget. We had. up 
till now, in recent years, things orderly arrange a so that the 
Government. was always able at the end of the yeariubmit.,the Budget 
for the next year and in December the Assembly could pass the Budget 
f4r,the corning year. . This time it was not 'pdssible because the.. 
preparatien.o this Federal 'sociAl pl,an and the whole business were 
so enormous, because the elaboration of economic regulations, which 
we accepted on this session, took ?much more time than we had . 
anticipated.. It could be sai&thatthe work on collecting data and 
the Preparation of this plan lasted through the whole year and that 
at least half a. year was spent on draft laws on which you were just 
voting. That is why it was not possible neither to submit the entire 
DraftFBudget7before this session nor that this session could pass 
the Budget in the spirit of this new Law on budgets. 
Therefore I think that it would be necessary beside,that Ukase 
of the Praesidium for financing in the first three months of the 
coming year, that this Assembly should pass another resolution, 
which is being also propesed by me and comrade Hrncevio. 
THE DRAFT RESOLUTION 
I. The Pederal Draft BuOr'et for 1952, which the FPRY 
Government submitted to the National Assembly on the 28th of 
December 1951, is to be handed Par conaileration to c')r.lthitt6es? 
for economic plan .and'finande? 
II. The Government of FPRY is to submit to the National 
Assembly, that is, to its committees for economic plan and 
finance, the complete Draft law on Federal budget for 1952, 
together with all its appendices, in due course so that 
the National 4ssembly could discuss and accept the Law on Federal 
Budget for 1952 at latest until the end of Mardh r952. 
IT. The Government of FPRY is authorized even btafbre passing 
the Law on Fedaral Budget for J952 to establish new system of

corresponding provisions. 
If these provisions recede from the existing'1?? rrovisions 
and as far as they are not included in the Draft Law on Federal 
Blidget for 1952, the Government will submit the corresponding 
decrees for approval to the National Assembly on its first coming 
session. 
? As the Peopleie Denuties have unanimously accepted the Draft 
on authorization of the FPRY Government to carry out from the 
beginning of 1952 postulations and measures provided in the Draft 
of the Federal social plan for 1952 and the resolutions proposed 
by People's beputies Mosa Pijade and Josip HrnceVic, the Second

IANYUG DENIES "UNITED PRESS" REPORT ON GIVING CONCESSIONS  
On December 31,19511 United Press reported from Belgrade 
that Yugoslavia would give concessions to foreign capital. 
As the report is unclear and not definitely formulated, 
TANYUG is authorized to state that it has no grounds and that it 
can be only the fruit of unrealistic wishes and combinations,and 
that it goes hand-in-hand with similar?false reports of the 
Cominform propaganda. 
Also, the spreading of such tendentious reports can only 
render difficult the development of normal economic and credit

THE COMINFORMISTS  OF GORIZIA HAVE PROPOSED AN  ANTI.,YUGOSLAV 
1ESOLUTIONWE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY. 
GORIZIA,Jan.2- At the last session of the Provincial 
Assembly of Gorizia,the Cominformist members of the Assembly' 
proposed a provoo)tive resolution against Yugoslavia. The 
resolution is addressed to the President of the Italian Republic. 
The CominformiSts assert in the resolution that the Italian 
Government has adopted the political line of Tito's Yugoslavia, 
and also demand that the inhabitants of Gorizia be given a guaranty 
that the Yugoslav military units will never come to the prevince 
of Gorizia and that the Italian army must never mix in matters 
concerning Yugoslavia. This provocative resolution,which also 
mentions certain invented Yugoslavia's aggressive plans against 
the Soviet Unionowas rejected by all the menbers of the Provincial 
Assembly of Gorizia--with the exception of the Cominformists. 
Representative of the Democratic Front of Slovenes in Italy and 
member of the Provincial Assembly,Nanutireplied to this resolution 
and said thatlif the Cominformists are really fighting for peace, 
then they should advise'Dioscow to cooperative with the freedom-
loving peoples in the United Nations. In connection with this, 
the President of the Provincial Assembly said that the political 
significance of the resolution would not be considered at the 
meetings of the Provincial Assembly,and Nanut stated that he was 
against such a stand since the Slovenes of ?Gorizia have no 
representative in the Italian Parliament who could defend their 
interests,and thatotherefore,the rights of the Slovenes--inciuding 
also their political rights--would be defended in the Provincial 
Assembly and in the Municipal Councils.

PROVOCATION ON THE RIVER MURA,  
For the last two weeks Hungary refuses to withdraw her mi-
litary forces from the Yugoslav island on the river Mura. This.provo-
cation was premeditated at a particularily chosen moment and with 
a defined objective. 
In international relations such acts as accomplished by the 
Hungarian Government on the Mura river, are qualified as an aggres;Ave 
guet-apens and cJ7ic.:17 _ of territory upon which they have no right 
whatsoever. Authorities in the countries of the Soviet bloc, in-
cited from Moscow, are holding 2,000 kilometers long Yugoslav 
border for the past three and .a half years under the aim of their 
machine guns and rifles and execute heavy armed provocations threate-
ning openly the territorial integrity and free development of Yugo-
slavia.But the last act of Hungarian border guards on the Mura island 
differs from the former ones because now the organisers of aggressive 
pressure against Yugoslavia show th(!C_r readiness not only to T 
provoke incidents along the Yugoslav border by setting ambushes, 
killing and organising kidnappings of Yugoslav frontier guards and 
by other hostile acts,on which occasions they cross the border line 
and remain on Yugoslav territory for several hours - but -y:;l-pt 
also to seize a part of Yugoslav territory by forceful means with 
the help of their military units and with the support of other mi-
litary reinforcements, The case of esland c the Mura ri7er has 
exposed to what extent are cftinformist ,in order 
to sharpen still further tension around Yugoslavia, to provoke in 
our country uneasiness and a psychosis of fear for the sole reason 
to make the political situation in this part of Europe still more 
abnormal and difficult and then to justify 'rcl explain their further 
non-peaceloving.attitude, their race in armaments, incitement of 
chauvinist hate, spreading cstrust among the nation's etc. 
Excuses which have been announced by the Hungarian Government 
in regard to the disembarkment of Hungarian military units contain 
nothing elf.e but a proof of such intentions by Budapest,Because, 
the affirmation that armed forces can seek some of " their rights " 
on the territory of a foreign state - nobod7. would take seriously, 
if behind it was not'oxpo67yi the practice of a usurping policy .which 
also 10:tha past different aggressors had recourse to prior to 
knocking their hads against the wall , All these excuses which are 
quoted by the Hungarian Government in order to explain how the Hun-
garian soldiers found themselves on Yugoslav territory ta- no longer 
deceive anybody. The frontier line on the Mura river is ..ATil.known 
matter and cannot be changed according to the wishes of Budapest. 
At this oj:y the border line is the main course of the Mura river 
and ;is situated between the island and the Hungarian river bank so 
that the island remains on the Yugoslav side, Thus all affirmations 
by the Hungarian Government concerning some " rights " are untenable. 
The moment for this provocation was not chosen accidentally. 
Hardly a month has passed since the United Nations accepted the Yu-
goslav Resolution by which countries of the Soviet bloc; were requested 
to harmonise their relations with Yugoslavia, and partiallarily in 
regard to their border acts, in tbmpliance with international regula-
tions and with United Nations' Charter, 
The Hungarian provoation cannot be understood differently but 
as an intentional Budapest reply - which in fact means Moscow's - 
to the United Nations' appeal , To a well-intentioned and peace-
loving appeal , the Cominform has again relied with weapons, provo-
cative guet-apens and seizure of territory of a neighboring state.

eREGARDING .SQME..P140i3LEMS WHICH HAVE ALRFADY BEEN -SETTLED 
In Yugoslavia the freedom of treed is guaranteed by the . 
.existing laws. The faithful therefore are given an opportunity 
of .making:full.liseof their rights, The church is free and the 
clergymen hold services daily and. preach on Sundays. ? Al]. other. 
religious rites are being administered freely. All Objective 
observers must therefore admit that, apart from those freedoms. 
which our citizens have been enjoying, there are no other ones 
to be granted to them. Nevertheless, there is still a number 
nf bishops and clergymen who, being much more devoted to the 
Vatican- than to their own state and fatherland, find that the 
granted rights are insufficient. The Vetican and all its servants 
would now prefer to see the church enjoy all those privileges 
which It had in the past. .? They would like to have large church 
estates in their possession, to have the last word in all important 
matters and to be the only authorized persons as re7ards the youth 
education. As all privileges have been cancelled in our country, 
the church consequently also finds itself in the same position. 
If our people's authority intends to remain truely popular in its 
character, then there should be no institutions having any kind 
of prerogatives whatsoever. 
However, the Vatican has not been used to be treatet as an 
equal partner among equals. On the contrary, it got used only to 
issue orders. Owing to the fact that it cannot any longer behave 
like that in our country, it has assumed a hostile attitude towards 
our state. Such a hostile attitude towards our state and its 
people's authority is displayed by its higher and lower clergy 
applying various metheda. In foreign countries they use lies and 
slanders against our country as the Cominform countries 0.o, They 
also encourage Ustashi and other groups of reactionary emigrants 
by spreading false news on the persecution of the church and - 
clerFymen in our country in their effort to depict the facts by 
all means available in as dark an aspect as possible. On the 
other hand, in our country, those clergymen and bishops who are 
loyal to the Vatican create an unfavourable disposition among 
the faithful towards the people's authority. In a- majority of 
cases, this activity is being carried out silently, but there 
are also cases in which action is being undertaken quite openly. 
People are being threatened in the middle of the church for not 
coming regularly to church, etc. They also suggest to the faithful 
that not enough freedom has been granted to the church, Further?
more, they advise the, peasants' to refuse to pay taxes or to join a 
co?ape/ative, apart from undertaking even more serious steps and: - 
actions directed against the state and the peoples authority, 
They have an eseecitlly hostile attitude towards the members of 
the Society called Cyril and Methodius composed of clergymen who 
maintain that even the clergymen should also be loyal to the people 
and the state wishing to collaborate with the people's authority 
by contributing their own efforts to the building up of a better 
future of our people and the whole mankind. 
One of the tasks undertaken by our authority consists in the 
development of our rural conditions through. co?operatives. It 
further intends to educate our people in the spirit of mutual fra?
ternal collaboration, in the spirit of a common co?operative work 
by bringing to an end the dif-eerences between the town and the 
villaFe. Through co?operatives, the productivity of our agriculture 
is being increased, as well-as that of viniculture and other branches 
of our economy. By means of co?operatives, we shall overcome egoistiq 
selfish and similar feelings.

The servants of the Vatican in our country are opposed to 
all this because they are not at all Concerned about the develop-
ment of soCialisM. Therefore they, prefer if the villages remain 
In darness, poverty and, aconomiC backwardness, being aware of 
the fact that the VaticiandoeS not take any interest in the peoples' 
JuelLe.being. 'Do these gentlemen believe.that our authority is going 
to tolerate Such a behaviour for a long time?.. Hostile acts against 
the-people's authority) ,Co-operatives, socialist construction and 
se on do not have nothing to do with the Creedl.but are in fact

our present authority. In any case it is.their duty to respect 
it by observing the.Iaw. On the basis of'our.lawa the faithful 
have been granted all those rights which they need. Moreover, 
there is plenty of freedom in.Our country of displaying good.will. 
The Vtican amd the reactionary clergy are today complaining 
because the people16 authority refuses to allow all clergymen to 
be religious instructors, They Warn the parents that their 
children are not being brought u-o in the spirit of good Moral 
in our schools. This is one of their great objections in 
relation to our schools, teachers and the people'a authority, 
a matter of fact, those clergymen who are the enemies of the 
people's authority cannot. he permitted to instruct the youth, 
regardless to the 'fact whether. they would be supposed to lecture 
at schools or in the church. :Clergymen sitilar te that at 
iijdovscina who put a letter in the hands of a deceased man 
begging. him to deliver it to the God, so. that, he could make his 
mission sucCessful,cannot be granted permission to teach our youth. 
In fact', all good and positive achievements PT the past have been 
taken up by oUr'education, L.ectures on religious instructions 
arc also being helds.butacCordingto the opinion of some. high 
dhu7oc officials expressedA.atelythey should be held in, 
the church only. By.theway, religious instruction represents 
an anachronism in our schools. However, according to my own 
pdint of view, those elergyMen who would intend to educate our 
youth in the spirit of.superStition'should.not at all'and by no 
means be entrusted to do. that job. In addition to this, spread.7-

THE WiTICliNIS BLESSING  TO THE SLOVENE SALESIAN MONKS IN THE 
ARGENTINE 
In a brdadoast of December 1, the Vatican Radio Broadcasting 
Station announced a report on the 50th anniversary of the founda-
tion of Int. Salesian order in Slovenia, In this report-it was 
stated that there were eight Salesian monacteries'in Slovenia 
apart from a number of other institutions including three board-
ing houses, one secondary school, one lewer seminary, a printerst 
scnoeln printworkS,?etc. ? Today, it was further 'stated in this 
reloort, following the confiscation of all real property of the 
Salesians on the part of ceMmlinist authority, there are no more 
such institutions in existance In Slovenia, while, as regards the 
monks, some of.them have been arrestecli while others live in 
isolation. The Salesian menks,must'therefore celebrate. this 
jubilee in Argentina because there isa.large number of these 
monks ynd live there as refugees. The Vaticants Secretariat 
sent in that connection a special message expressing the Pope's 
satisfaction with their .activity among the Slovene population 
and as a'speoial sign of his favourableness his blesing. 
Let 413 see why the Salesian nonka are so. favoured. by the Popes 
The scat of the Salesians, an Italian religious,order, is . 
in. Turin. From Italy. they came to Slovenia, but most of them also 
studied in Turin, thus introducing their specific methods of 
propaganda in Slovenia.. They Were extremely:sutcessful in 
obtaining contributiomin'cash from the 'faithful. They also 
devoted special attention to the education of the youth wham they 
tried to attract by different means and even by sports. They also 
had their own printshop?and.printed a large number of various 
publications which wore distributed all over Slovenia ?in a very 
large number of:copies. Their pamphltts called l!Knjizice" (Booklets) 
were in fact a handbook for an ideOlogical struggle against communism 
Apart from these ideological books; they also published a series of 
books on mysticism intended to establish closer ties betwcen the 
Salesian monks and the light-minded. faithful. Because ef their 
behaviour and methods applied in work, Calesians were not very 
Much favoured by other religious orders. They were however envied 
because of their successfili propaganda as to the collectien of 
Money for the church. Thy rendered the church into .an entergise 
in their 'practice. They cOuld easily compete with the Franciscan 
Zakrajsek. who introduce 8ethods upon the example of similar actions 
undertaken in America. . ?

For this reasnn the Salesians w(re favoured by the Pope. They 
were also very meritorious for their' activity during the national 
liberation struggle, O the basis of various documents one ern 
see that even before the wrr the leading Salesian monks were 
simultaneously Italian F scist spies. Upon the arrival of. the 
Italian occupier in Ljubljana, Dr. Franc Blatnik sent on May 7,1941 
a message to the Italian Commander.- (Details on Blatnik can be 
found in the book "Belogardizem" by Frsnck Sajet published recently) 
From the very beginning Blatnik was the chief organizer of high 
treason. Next year, on May 15,1942, he denounced his own pupil 
Josef Hrastelj and upon his arrest he interrogated him at St.1Jazarus 
monastery at T-bor. According to some documents it is more than 
obvious that Blatnik became one of the most reliable confidants 
of the White Guard and the Italians. He had a widespread spy 
network. They persecuted the supporters of the liberation movement 
and handed them over to the occupier. The occupier also enabled 
him to travel to Croatia and Serbia where he visited the expelled 
clergymen. Thereupon some of them were allowed to go beck to 
Slovenia. He also closely collaborated with the bishop R-zman 
and L;mbert Ehrlich and his "guardians", Following the death of 
Ehrlich, he became the spiritual leader of the "guardians", thus 
taking them along the path directed to high treason. In the 
spring of 1942 when the occupiers hesitated to form armed units 
nf White Guardians, they were forced to do so by the reactionary 
clerical leaders headed by the bishop Rozman. We can again notice 
that Blatnik was assigned the role of Rozmanls courier: he was 
sent to the Cardinal Maglinn in Rome. Following this action, 
drastic fascist decrees were passed directed against the Slovene 
population and armed units of the White Guard were formed. Until 
then the fascists were convinced that they were strong enough to 
cope with the partisans. The VeticanIs mediation was successful. 
During the years which followed, we can again find out that Blatnik 
was an organizer and propagator of high treason. I. the autumn of 
1943, having been captured by the partisans Blatnik was forced to 
take the ultimatum of the XIV division of the partisans to the 
White Guard which was surrounded in Turjak. Upon the capture of 
T-irjak he had a chance of escaping With some White Guards from 
Zapotok to Ljubljana. Under the new circumstances he became the 
supporter of Domobrani (Home Guard), went to N vo M sto where he 
edited a local newspaper which was distinwuished by its sharp 
tone, then went to Otrinthia and finally 'arrived in Today 
he lives in Rome and works at the Vatican,Broadcasting Station, 
taking advantage of each single opportunity for attacking his 
fatherlcnd. ' - 
Blatnik is only one exaMple of a Salesian monk, although 
he may be considered as one of the most prominent ones, Other 
Salesian monks collaborated with him taking care of the education 
of their pupils in the spirit of the White'Guard. The Director 
of the Salesian ?allege at Kodeljevo admitted before the Court 
that in 1943 the majority of his pupils joined the Domobrani and 
the police aertice. Not a single religious order, committed high 
treason to 'such an extent as the Salesians did in Slovenia. For 
such a "behaviour" in Slovenia the Pope considers them meritorious 
today. 
A majority of Sa;egian monks did not wait to be asked to give 
an account of its workey?rhe people, but partly during the war and 
especially following the dissolution of the Domobrani units escaped 
across the frontier and now is living in the Argentine, Eldorado 
for fascist war criminals. They selected a country which is fairly 
remote from _Slovenia for the fulfilment of their bloody affair,

The Pope's blessing and appeovalof the trecherow'. a.;leslans 
monks is another proof of a hostile attitude oz the Vatican 
towards thesocialist Yugoslavia, Nothing of this is new, but 
is a continuation of the line of the well known Vatican campaign 
against the revolutionary changes in Yugoslavia waged simultaneously 
with the firing of the first partisan gunk .What was the reason 
that a large majority of the.SloVene clergy participated in one way 
or another in the high trea.son, Was it possible to occur without 
a consent and stimulation on the part of the Vatican? Why did the 
Vatican identify the persecution of the people's traitors with the 
persecution of the church and creed? Why they still persist in 
their stand, despite clear evidence of the guilt of numerous clergy-
men who were sentenced? This is not a political or church problem, 
but a ciaavtaten of mrtal which sooner or later will have to be solved.. 
We would have to'worry less about this problem and probably a 
"modus vivendi" might be established with the church, rab7ied that the 
Vatican would give up with its present stand, Our people will never 
forget the treacherous role played by those who are today called by 
the Vatican diplomats "martyrs". They will also not have the chance 
of seeing our people auport their views saying that treason is 
to be considered as a virtue. Not until the Vatican circles and 
high church officials in our country would abandon their present 
stand, we shall fail to take advantage of each single opportunity 
of drawing their attention to historical facts. The liberated people 
of Slovenia will never forget its cruel fate which it had to suffer 
chiefly owing to. the treason committed by the clergy. 
, The people's authority is not so bloodthirsty, but released 
numerous convicts hoping that their future attitude towards the 
people and their fatherland will be better. By this act no alleged 
error made by our courts are being amended, as some people would 
like to make it. On the contrary it is a sign of generosity of 
the people's authority expressed towards those who seem to be willing 
to correct their attitude and behaviour. 
Therefore the Vatican's demand for the "rehabilitation" of 
sentenced clergymen seems quite illogical to our people. Committed 
crimes against the people and the state cannot be cancelled, as if 
they were never done. Any country whatsoever and without any 
exception would have bondemned such criminals as a large number 
of our clergymen were, 
The current policy applied by the Vatican towards Yugoslavia 
cannot lead to a reconcilement. On the basis of its practice it 
becomes. obvious that the Vatican is not at all concerned about a 
possible reconcilement, but rather prefers the present situation 
to remain unchanged. In this way only one can understand the 
Vatican diplomacy, its propaganda and the support offered by the 
high church officials in Yugoslavia to the Vatican. 
The Pope's blessing to the Slovene Salesian monks in the 
Argentine is another move following this same linec.
