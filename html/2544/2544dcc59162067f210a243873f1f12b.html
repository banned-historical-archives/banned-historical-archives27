 1  ro\ uc1,ibn
 Other Latin American Countries
 Since 1952, and particularly since 1956, Chinese Communist
 influence on Latin American CI  .has been apparent in the formula-
 tion of programs and policies geared to the strategy of the "united
 democratic front of national liberation." Procedures such as the
 systematic analysis of economic and political groupings and their
 re-ape-ct  a potentials for Communist exploitation in a struggle against
 the most important common enemy (US imperialism) reflect the appli-
 cation of tactics recommended by Mao Tse-tung.  These tactics are
 described in Mao's writings, such as "Tactical Problems in the United
 Anti-Japanese Front, "  which since,t 1956 have been translated
 into Spanish for distribution and study in Latin America.  Mao's works,
 as well as those of Lui Shao-ch'i and probably other Chinese Commun-
 ist leadersjhave also been used in the training courses arranged for
 Latin Americans by the Communist Party of China.  These courses
 A
 have emphasized the agrarian base of the Chinese revolution, the tech-
 niques of clandestine party organization and action, and the history and
 G2TV--~..,c~
 success of the armed .    ggle/ in t      -oi the long drawn-out struggle
 against the Kuomintang and the Japanese.
 It is apparent that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 (CPSU) encouraged the Latin American CPjs to avail themselves of
 the lessons of the Chinese revolution, in view of the similarity of poli-
 tical, economic, and social conditions in China and Latin America
 (i. e., existence of foreign economic ''imperialism'', feudalistic '`sur-
 vivals, in rural life, and a generally low level of industrial developmenty).
 For example, the Brazilian CP program formulated in 1953-54 under
 Ap                                        04250011-9
 ApproMtof
 CPSU guidance reflected certain points emphasized in Chinese tactics,
 and in mid-1955 Latin American CP ~ s began to acknowledge the impor-
 tance of the Chinese  evolution in their programmatic documents.  In
 early 1956 the Twentieth CPSU Congress gave official recognition to the
 doctrine of /many roads( to Socialism, and increased attention began to
 be paid. to the Chinese experience (in contrast to that of the Soviets and
 the European satellites) as illustrative of progress from "semi-feudal,
 semi-colonial forms" toward Socialism.  Thus1the Costa Rican CP, after
 studying Manuel Morals report on the XX CPSU Congress, passed a reso-
 lutioni which quoted the Soviet Manual of Political Economy on the im-
 portance of the Chinese  evolution.  While in Moscow, Latin American
 delegates to the Twentieth CPSU Congress were invited to China, where
 in the spring and summer of 1956 they participated in seminars and tours.
 Later in the year many Latin American CP leaders attended the Eighth
 Congress of the 0f P. as fraternal representatives.  Since 1956, the train-
 ing of Latin American CP members in China has been placed on an organ-
 ized and permanent basis,
 cultural exchanges have grown, and Chinese
 theoretical and propaganda publications have been translated and increas-
 ingly disseminated in Spanish.
 This gradually increasing emphasis on the study of the Chinese
 experience has developed with the concurrence and support of the CPSU.
 Yet with the development of personal contacts between the Latin Americans
 and the Chinese, some indications of Sino-Soviet rivalry and disagreement
 also appeared.  Thus one of the first Latin American students to return
 from a (CP training school was told, in 1958, by Latin American special-
 ists of the CPSU, that Chinese plans for communes were "too early and
 too risky.   The student noted that these specialists were more conciliatory
 reap$ct, to Tito than were the Chinese
 t*MT they regarded some Chinese
 claims as exaggerated and, by innuendo, played them down.  The Soviets

 were keenly interested in the students' impressions of the CCP course,
 indicated that they also were considering 4 CPSU for Latin Americans
 alorre,  On the other hand, the student noted that the Chinese, who were
 intensely interested in Latin America, had indicated disagreement with
 the Soviets on a number of points (the denigration of Stalin    certain
 Soviet industrial methods), and had shown a fundamental belief in the
 inevitability of war with the USA,
 A year later, another Latin American CP member returning
 from a siilar, CCP; training course noted                          ryj-
 that, one lectu er =&-Mated that **for the Chinese, there was no revolu-

 the Chinese in general to be "very cautious" in mentioning other parties,f
 emphasizing that "eagh country has its own peculiarities. "
 - br gerieral,    appears that prior to 1960, Sino-Soviet differences
 were not       emphasized to Latin Americans, made little impression
 on them, and did not, in themselves, cause friction or factionalism
 within     Latin American parties.  In some cases,, however, internal
 policy differences of long standing have r   parallel to the international
 conflict, and have become identified with it as the Sino-Soviet dispute
 -AiW sharpened and as-the Soviets and Chinese fives sought to develop sup-
 port for their             points of view.  Now that the dispute has been
 discussed and publicized at international meetings, and is more generally

 controversy, because it bears on the party's own conflict with Fidel Castro
 and the 26th of July Movement.     This conflict extends back to 1956, when
 the PSP official]-established its policies concerning 'b   armed struggle in
 -1 1
 Cuba. These were announced in a manifesto of September 1956,entitled
 "The Road of the People:  August 1933. "        stated that "we are not pro-
 ponents of violence for its own sake, nor do we believe that violence is the
 only path... but when the despotic government... blocks the electoral path
 and seeks to maintain itself by force, there is not other remedy than extra-
 parliamentary action, that is, the direct struggle of the masses. " How-
 ever, it also pointed out that "ihe experience of 1930-33, when the putsch
 of Aguado, the mob assault of Rio Verde, the landing of Gibara, and the
 assault on the barracks of San Luis all failed, and when the general strike
 and the uprising of the masses in August 1933 triumphed; the experience of
 all revolutions and of all struggles for liberty; all such experience indicates
 that the correct, the best, and the most rapid--and the most secure and
 most popular--(course) is that proposed by the Party of the Cuban Revolu-
 tion, the Popular Socialist Party: the development of the struggle of the
 masses and its culmination in a new August, in a powerful general strike
 and a decisive gene    uprising.... "
 In ti --Septet r l 56 manifesto' the PSP referred to the unsuc-
 cessful attack on the Moncada barracks (which resulted in Castro's impris-
 onment in 1953) as "desperate and sterile. "* Later in the year, in the
 official party theoretical organ Fundamentos,,the party paid even more
 '     It has subsequently been reported that when the 26th of July
 Movement was being organized in Mexico (about 1955-56) the
 Communists had sought, with the support of Raul Castro, to
 influence Fidel to abandon his plans for armed invasion of Cuba.
 When these efforts did not succeed, they instructed Raul to
 continue to go along with Fidel's plans.

 attention to the Fidelista movement:
 "The 26th of July Movement raised the banner of
 insurrection at a predetermined place and without rela-
 tion to the struggle of the masses... it recently introduced
 the idea of the general strike into its tactical concepts, but
 in an erroneous sense:  only as an instrument of insurrec-
 tion and not--as should be the case--as an element in the
 development of the mass struggle which may be followed,
 in certain cases, by an armed insurrection.''
 "Insurrection, moreover, is not a game.  It is a
 very complicated and serious tactical procedure which
 should not be used... except under determined conditions.
 Otherwise, in most cases, insurrection will be no more
 than a putsch.*
 "... Lacking such conditions, it is indispensable
 that every true revolutionary contribute to the patient
 and 'gray' task of elevating the conscience of the vanguard..   It
 A year later, at the special conference of Latin American
 Communist party leaders held in Moscow in November 1957, the PSP
 still opposed Castro's tactics and his disinclination to unite with the
 PSP or to follow its line.  The Cuban representative to this meeting
 noted that the sabotage of sugar cane (d 26th of July tactic under the
 direction of Rene Ramos Latour, known as "Daniel") was an unpopular,
 sectarian action which lacked sympathy among the workers, and that
 although the PSP had "attempted to guide the Fidelistas, " the latter
 had not wanted to participate in coordinated mass action.
 Intellectual leaders of the 26th of July Movement took notice
 of the Communist criticisms and, in turn, sought to establish their
 own ideological position.  One of these leaders was Armando Hart
 Davalos, then clandestine coordinator of the movement and currently
 Minister of Education.  Hart's ideas were published (after the rebel
 In the same issue of Fundamentos, the significance of the
 Chinese experience was described in an article entitled
 "Desde Pekin", by an anonymous author (possibly Cesar
 Escalante Dellunde, who is known to have been a delegate
 to the VIII CCP Congress and who probably participated in
 seminars in China).

 victory) in a commemorative issue of Revolucion (26 July 1959) under
 the title "Justification of the Revolution and the Strategy against the
 Dictatorship, November 1956. "  Hart made the following points:
 "On occasions, the revolution follows the course of
 pacifism.  We do not deny that theoretically and under cer-
 tain circumstances this may be the adequate path....  But
 possibly the most important experience that the new genera-
 tion has learned has been that the revolution, at any moment
 and undery circumstance, must be prepared for direct
 action.... -
 "The 26th of July Movement represented a real
 categorical answer to this revolutionary need, not a
 theoretical speculation...
 "Opposed to it were those who spoke of peace.  The
 external difference, apparently, between our line of conduct
 and that of the other organizations and parties, was that we
 publicly proclaimed the need for violence and the others
 advocated pacifist solutions.  On the surface this appears to
 be a mere strategic discrepancy, ~4 has, nevertheless, its
 origin in a fundamental ideological discrepancy. "
 By identifying the 26th of July Movement as the only group which
 advocated armed action, Hart obviously places the gommunists with
 those advocating ,peaceful solutions'  He argues further that the pur-
 pose of violent action is not that of simple military victory, but is that
 of creating discontent, dissatisfaction, and opposition of such dimensions
 that the government will be unable to maintain itself in power.  Thus by
 provoking the dictatorship to increased brutality and terrorism the public
 reaction is created which assures the dictator's overthrow.  A quite
 similar point of view is held by !'Che"Guevara, who lists among the
 .'
 "fundamental contributions" of the Cuban revolution the proof that "it is
 not always necessary to wait for the fulfillment of all of the conditions
 for the revolution; the focus of insurrection can create them. "
 The existence of what Hart refers to as a "fundamental ideolog-
 ical discrepancy'kbetween the Fidelistas and the Communists during
 the Sierra campaign is also indicated in a letter which was' aken from
 A
 Hart when he was arrested by the Cuban army in early 1958.  The letter,

 unsigned and apparently meant for "Che"''? states in part:
 "you have been rude as well as unjust.  For you to believe
 that we are rightists or that we come from the petty Cuban
 bourgeoisie, or rather that we represent it... does not sur-
 prise me... since it is in line with your interpretation of
 the historical proceedings of the Russian revolution....
 We have had no other course to follow, because your leaders
 perpetrated the formidable outburst of 1917... but left the
 peoples located outside that country without the opportunity
 to unchain a universal revolution....  The fatality of all
 this is that Stalin was not French, or English, or German,
 and was therefore unable to overcome the limited viewpoint
 of a Russian leader.  .. . If there can exist discrepancies
 between us over the international aspect of revolutionary
 politics, I consider myself among the more radical ones....
 There are indications that the author of the above letter  who
 was probably Hart himselflt\did not consider himself to be a spokesman
 for Fidel but, rather a member of a group whose goals were in accord
 with Fidel's.  This may have been a restablished Trotskyi* group, inas-
 much as the author states "do not ever identify me with persons who have
 dominated the CTC (Cuban Confederation of Labor) for the past 25 years"
 (i.e., the Trotskyitl~ of the 1930's who founded the CTC but later became
 n
 identified with Batista).  In any event, the letter strongly suggests the
 existence within the 26th of July Movement of a dissident Communist
 element which condemned Stalin and Stalinism as opposed to the exten-
 sion of the world revolution.  It is possible that the same distrust of the

 though recently appearing to favor the Chinese line, "Che had been
 a member of the Russian-Mexican Cultural Institute in Mexico and
 his wife had been closely associated with Soviet military intelligence
 agents.  It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that 'Che`may, at
 this time, Ja.ve been seeking to Vguidei the Fidelistas in terms of
 the orthodox CP line favoring unity and mass action.  It is interesting
 that the letter refers to a copy of another letter, written by"Che'to
 "Daniel", which had been received (apparently by Hart) and which
 introduced the subject of "Che's "legitimate doctrinal worries. "
 `Daniel; in the end of 1957, had been placed in charge of the sabotage
 of the sugar harvest.

 "limited viewpoint of a Russian leader" may have later been applied to
 Khrus.hc ev's conciliatory attitude toward the West.
 eginning in March 1958, the PSP began to admit that the Castro
 movement had become a "movement of the masses" and that it was ap-
 propriate to support it actively in the field.  Through the PSP organiza-
 tional and material aid was. given Castro, and CP members were
 encouraged to apply the lessons of the Chinese revolution with respect
 to work in rural areas and within the rebel forces.  Nevertheless, rr   al
 distrust between the PSP and the Fidelistas continued even after the agree -
 ments for collaboration which were worked out in 1958.  During the early
 months of the Castro regime there were numerous evidences of Fidel's

 for study in connection with the organization of Communist activity in the

 of July Movement. After the victory, the organization of the Agrarian
 Reform Institute provided another area for the application of the Chinese
 experience, and in October 1959 a source who was in contact with "Che"
 Guevara and other high officials of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA)
 expressed the opinion that the Soviets "do not have a chance in Cuba.
 He stated that INRA officals viewed China as the "model state" while
 Lonsidering the Soviets as "degenerate Communists. "
 Evidence of friction within the PSP itself, possibly related to t'
 earlier        t  ith the 26th of July leaders and the developing Sino-Sov-
 iet conflict, came in January 1960.  At this time it was reported that a
 group (unidentified) existed within the PSP which proposed that t i- older
 leaders step down and allow tip younger members to assume nominal
 control of the party.  This development was apparently based on the belief

 June, Secretary General Blas Roca made a trip to the Soviet bloc and
 China, motivated in part by a desire to discuss the nature of Sino-Soviet
 disunity with leaders of other parties.  He returned with no definite
 opinion on the matter, but impressed with its seriousness, and subse-
 quently the PSP held a series of meetings in an attempt to formulate a
 stand.  The leaders concealed their concern from the rank and file, how-
 ever, and tried to minimize the importance of the controversy.  The
 position of the Party leadership was probably as stated by Carlos Rafael
 Rodriguez in July 1960, when he said privately that "it would be unwise
 to take a position with respect to the controversy, as the very line that
 one might oppose might become the accepted line. "   Nevertheless, pro-
 Soviet bias was indicated in his further remarks that "the CPSU had an
 enormous task in guiding the world Communist movement along the right:
 v oad~',, and that the CPSU "must be moderate and attempt to maintain
 peace in view of the possibility that the imperialists, in their death-agon-
 ies, might strike blows which would imperil mankind. "    This statement,
 and the continued control of the PSP by the old leaders after the Eighth
 PSP Congress in August 1960, suggest' that, the PSP is indeed Soviet-oriented,
 and that the Chinese claims of Cuban CP support, made at the preliminary
 meeting held to consider the Sino-Soviet controversy in Moscow in October;
 did not refer to the party leadership.  On the other hand, the PSP leader-
 ship has publicly reversed its earlier line to accomodate the 26th of July
 thesis.  ~n his address at the VIII PSP Congress, Blas Roca stated that
 the attacks on the Moncada and Bayamo barracks were "not conceived as
 a classic coup or putsch, despite the manner in which they were carried
 out.  ... They were not designed to take over the government... but... (to)
 form a center of revolutionary struggle.  ... The great historical merit of
 Fidel :Lies in the fact that... he saw it was possible to defeat the tyranny by
 armed. force. "

 From the foregoing, it seems apparent that the anti-Soviet and
 pro-Chinese influence in Cuba is located primarily outside the PSP,
 in the ranks of the 26th of July Movement and the governmental agencies
 and among the younger members of the PSP.  It is probably strongest
 among certain elements who fought in the Sierra and who were aware of
 revolutionary ideologies, among those exposed to Chinese revolutionary
 ideologies,       g those      aw#  Chinese revolutionary literature,
 and among the new generation of Marxists] educated in 'e courses es-
 tablished by the Rebel Army and other government agencies which glorify
 the Sierra campaign and its leaders.  These are unorthodox Communists,
 who to date have neither been clearly identified nor organized into a
 recognizable clique or group.  They may include Raul Castro, who denies
 membership in the PSP; yet was once a member of the Communist Youth
 and who may be a  secret") member of the Party.  Raul's militant, ag-
 gressive, extremist anti-U,5-,views give support to the Chinese policy of
 promoting East-West tension rather than reducing it.  Raul was reportedly
 disappointed by the refusal of the Soviets to enter into a military pact
 with Cuba,which was one of his objectives in going to Moscow in the sum-
 mer of 1960.  He has given strong support to the establishment of the
 Cuban-Chinese Cultural Society and the New China News Agency office
 in Habana. In November 1959 he reportedly received verbal messages
 from the Chinese Foreign Minister through Faure Chomon (now Cuban
 rnbas sador to the USSR) including a request that Raul "occupy the US P
 Nava]. Base at Guantanamo immediately upon the beginning of a Chinese
 Communist attack on Taiwan. "*
 Other reports suggest that the Chinese, and the Trotskyi  l
 elements in Cuba, place greater emphasis on action against
 Guantanamo than does the PSP.

 Raul has also been reported (without confirmation) to have been in contact
 with Chinese intelligence officials who, from Habana, were organizing the
 foundation of Communist Chinese cells throughout Latin America.
 "?he"I Guevara may be another vehicle for pro-Chinese influence,
 although he has stressed that the Cuban  evolution has followed its own
 Marxist path.  Guevara's advocacy of armed struggle as the means of ex-
 tending the Cuban revolution to other Latin American countries, his belief
 that armed struggle can be initiated before conditions for its success are
 present, and his praise of Chinese communes suggest a pro-Chinese
 orientation, though earlier in his career he appears to have been closely
 associated with the Soviets.  Gue     also denies that he is a Communist,
 and there is no 4Z
 b       h dra-a secret party member.  Carlos
 Olivares Sanchez, $eputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and the principal
 coordinator of Cuban diplomatic and para-diplomatic activities in Latin
 America, is reported to be "a practicing Marxist with a preference in
 Communist theory toward Yugoslav and Red Chinese policies.- !_, Olivares
 is very closely associated with Raul Castro, is ~ecretary of Foreign Re-
 lations of the 26th of July Movement, and one of the key officials involved
 in the extension of the Cuban  liberation movement to the rest of Latin
 America.
 Armando Hart, the Minister of Education, as previously mentioned,
 appears to represent an unorthodox brand of Communism, possibly asso-
 ciated with the revived Trotskyite movement.  (It is of interest to note,
 parenthetically, that a new  Latin American Popular Liberation Front con-
 taining Trotskyite elements, was organized in Argentina in early 1960, and
 The Chinese have been extremely antagonistic toward Yugoslav
 Communism.  Thus this statement, at best, indicates only that
 Olivares is eclectic and not controlled by the PSP.

 that one of the organizational meetings was held in Buenos Aires in the
 home of the father of 'IQ-he" Guevara.  Other meetings took place in
 Buenos Aires under the aegis of Cuban and Bolivian diplomats.)  Hart's
 wife, Haydee Santamaria, is head of the Casa de las Americas in Cuba,
 a front which is instrumental in financing and training revolutionary
 youth in other Latin American countries.   In addition to those named
 above, there are probably others, among them officials who have been
 subjected to intense propaganda during visits to Communist China, who
 may favor the Chinese in the present dispute.  At the present time,
 these cannot be identified.  However, it is known that the Chinese feel
 that they have support in Cuba.  They indicated this at the time of the
 preliminary meetings in Moscow in October 1960, and reportedly they
 were able to prevent the distribution in Cuba of certain issues of
 Problems of Peace and Socialism which favored the Soviet viewpoint.
 With the establishment of a Chinese  mbassy in Cuba,` and with the
 ideological controversy still potentially disruptive, it seems probable
 that the Chinese will seek to exploit the various dissidents, unorthodox
 Communists, and `, extremists in the 26th of July Movement as a
 force in their favor.
 ~=~- In this effort they will be greatly aided by the actual presence
 on the Cuban scene of Chinese propagandists, technicians, and officials,
 among whom are CP members.  The influx of Chinese visitors began in
 early 1959.  The New China News Agency has had a staff, headed by
 Kung Mai, at its Latin American headquarters in Habana since mid-1959.

 ,_ - In November 1959; the Communist Chinese Foreign Minister sent
 word to Raul Castro that twenty Chinese industrial and agricultural tech-
 nicians would arrive in Cuba in January 1960.  Later reports suggest
 that these arrived and have been engaged by INRA,. a  :in   ptember 1960
 it was reported that Chinese Communists were working on an agricultural
 cooperative in Caney, Oriente Province.  Various Chinese delegations
 have also visited Cuba.  For example, in October 1960 a group of Chinese
 trade unionists headed by Kang Yung-ho visited Cuba to participate in the
 WFTU-sponsored international labor meeting in support of Algeria, and
 later toured Cuban factories and talked with Cuban labor leaders.  In ad-
 dressing workers at one factory, Kang described how the Chinese had
 overcome their difficulties, had defeated the USrembargo, and had dgvel-
 oped production on the basis of their own resources.

 and interpreters) wereFconducted on 'a tour of INRA cooperatives in Ma-
 t ,
 tanzas and briefed by Captain Julio Suarez, an extreme anti-American
 leftist who devoted much of his speech to a description of supposed Amer-
 ican sabotage of the Cuban agricultural and industrial effort.  The Chinese,
 during the tour, made suggestions concerning the need for,~liquidation of
 counterrevolutionaries and the strengthening of the militia at various in-
 stallations.  Even more extensive contacts in the future are indicated in
 the statements made by "kye" Guevara in China in December 1960, wa
 he said that "twenty-four out of the hundreds of factories" to be built in
 Cuba in the next five years will be built with direct Chinese aid.  By the
 close of 1960; Chinese anti-aircraft guns, bazookas, and mortars were
 reported to be in the hands of Cuban forces.
 In summary, it is apparent that botli Soviets and the Chinese have
 an enormous stake in Cuba.  Fidel Castro 's ambition to export the Cuban
 revolution to the rest of Latin America is in accord with both Soviet and

 Chinese goals.  Yet the Cuban government does not appear to be decisively
 --orented either by the Sovietor the Chinese Communists.  The orthodox
 Cuban Communist Party (the PSP) is controlled by old line pro-Soviet Com-
 munists who, although calling for complete support of Castro, have never-
 theless regarded him with some misgivings.                   Castro's impetuosity and
 interest in military action (which resulted in the unsuccessful Dominican
 invasion and other revolutionary ventures) may not only be counterproduc-
 tive and hinder the spread of Communism, but may also result in the ex-
 tension of war and the development of a global conflict.  This would not be
 in accord with Soviet policies of recent years, and although there are
 V
 indications of Soviet approval of a more aggressive international Commun-
 ist line in 1961, it is possible that the orthodox Communists still wish to
 avoid responsibility for Fidelista extremism
 To the Chinese, the extension of the armed struggle to other
 countries through the activities of the Castro government serves the
 immediate end of increasing international tensions and creating problems
 for the United States on a wide variety of fronts.  The justification by

 with this Chinese goal of promoting tension. Moreover, the rural,
 agrarian, anti-imperialist characteristics of the. Cuban revolution allow
 the Chinese opportunity for offering advice based on their own experience,
 even though they are not in a position to offer the same technical, mater-
 ial) and military aid as the Soviet bloc.
 In Mexico, recognition of the Sino-Soviet controversy within the
 middle ranks of the orthodox Communist Party (the Partido Comunista
 Mexicano 4PCM) was reported in August 1960.  At that time, Prisciliano
 Garza Es'calante, a member of the Central Committee, told several
 Nuevo Leon state PCM leaders that he had recently returned from the USSR
 and China and was disturbed by the developing rift,)vetween these countries.
 He said the "greatest single factor causing the deterioration of relations"
 was the Soviet adherence to a tactical line described by the Chinese as
 being "weak and non-aggressive."  Garza said the PCM must study the con-
 troversy and decide whether to support the Soviet or the Chinese party.
 Garza was reported as personally favoring the more aggressive
 line of the Chinese.
 About this same time, a "communication addressed to the Political
 Commission of the PCM, " allegedly by "a group of Chinese Communists
 in Cuba" indicates that the Chinese CP may have sought, through direct
 channels, to establish its~osition before the CP Mexico. * This
 *    It is possible that the foregoing statement of Chinese views originated
 with the Chinese delegation to the congress of the Cuban CP held in
 Habana in August 1960.  It is not known that the Chinese used this
 occasion for stating their case to other fraternal delegates, though
 this is likely.  Certainly the Sino-Soviet rift was discussed, as the
 Honduran delegate reported that the PSP "disparaged the differences"
 between the two powers.  In referring to the rift, he stated that the
 Chinese "did not approve of trying to reach agreements with the West, "
 and although they recognized the international leadership of t. e USSR,
 they believed that "more people will die from hunger under  apital
 ism than would die in a war. "

 communication, presumably received in September 1960, outlined four
 points, which epitopized the Chinese position.  These, in brief, were
 as, follows:
 a.  War is inevitable and can break out at any moment.
 It will be initiated by the imperialist bloc led by the United States,
 or by the United States alone without previous knowledge by its
 allies .
 b.  War must not be feared, even a nuclear war.  It is not
 -certain that such a war  ,puld destroy humanity, and although dev-
 astating, it must be exploited to accelerate the pace of a transition
 to Socialism.
 c.  In some countries, a peaceful transition from 'apital-
 .ism to ~ocialism is improbable because it has been proved that
 imperialism goes to the aid of the capitalistic system wherever
 the situation is maturing.
 The transition from. (,capitalism to Socialism will be
 violent, but it is the obligation of the Communist parties to blame
 capitalist agents for it.
 Another indication of direct Chinese action in defense of their
 ideological viewpoint was the distribution in Mexico of the book Long Live
 Leninism.
 In.3ate. September 1960; the first shipment of 2000 copies of
 the Spanish edition arrived in Mexico, and an additional 3000 copies were
 reportedly expected.  This book has been used by the Chinese in their
 attack on Soviet views, and its distribution has been protested by various
 CP(s in both bloc and non-bloc countries as injurious to Communist unity.
 It is possible that, from Mexico, the book has been distributed elsewhere
 in Latin America.
 In Mexico, evidence of Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban influences must
 be viewed against a background of inter -party and intra-party rivalry,

 disagreement, and intrigue.  To date there appears to be no clear reflec-
 tion of the Sino-Soviet rift.                      However, there is considerable evidence of
 a growth of leftist extremism which is supported from Cuba and which, as
 in Cuba, seems to involve youth and student elements, a revived Trotsky-
 i   party*  nd dissident members                of the Communist Party of Mexico.
 There are also indications that the Peoples' Socialist Party (PPS), which
 dominates the Mexican Communist movement, favors the Soviet position
 and, in the last year and a half, mhv~ir have received increased Soviet
 support.
 ithin the orthodox Communist party (PCM), indirect Soviet
 guidance and possibly interference was responsible for the overthrow in
 1959-60 of Dionisio Encina, who symbolized Stalinism, and the rise to
 power in the party of Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo and others favoring the
 Khrushchev line.  The victorious anti-Encina group, however, itself has
 become divided in the past year between leaders such as David Alfaro
 Siqueiros, who favors agitation, and Martinez Verdugo, who favors more
 discreet action which would limit political repercussions.
 Siqueiros, currently in prison for fomenting unrest, appears to
 have been a key figure in the support in Mexico of extremist agitation
 over the past year.  He has apparently had Cuban support.  In August or
 September 1959 Siqueiros' brother-in-law, Leopoldo Arenal Bastar, was
 given possession of arms which had been stored in the Cuban ~mbass y in
 Mexico, presumably for use by a group described by Arenal as being
 composed of "dissatisfied petroleum workers, railroad workers, and
 The Trotskyi$i+ Partido Obrero Revolucionario (POR) was founded in
 mid-1959.  Its leaders include Jorge M za, a railroad worker; Herr. an !----a
 a student; Carlos Lopez; a painter; and Jaime Estrada Lopez,
 a law student.  Like its Cuban counterpart, it officially identifies itself
 with the IV International.

 teachers. " In November 1959' Arenal sought additional arms from Cuban
 sources for the   J. ,faro Siqueiros grouptR.  In January 19b0 'Siqueiros
 strongly criticized President Lopez Mateos of Mexico and praised the
 Cuban .evolution, receiving emphatic support from the then Cubanirn-
 bassador, Salvador Massip.  In February, Leopoldo Arenal again appeared
 at the Cuban imbassy selling Siqueiros' prints in order to buy parts for
 portable radios to be used in Mexico, and in July,  certain members of the
 Mexican delegation to the First Latin American Youth Congress in Habana
 took with them a painting by Siqueiros to sell in order to buy arms for an
 armed revolution.
 It is of interest that the principal controversy which developed at
 the Youth Congress in Habana concerned the recognition of the credentials
 of certain "Trotskyit" delegates from Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, and Ar-
 gentina.  Of the Mexican delegation, which represented some twenty-three
 student and youth organizations, representatives of five groups supported
 ke recognition of delegates of the Mexican Trotskyi   Partido Obrero
 Revolucionario and wished the congress to officially, denounce the govern-
 ment of President Lopez Mateos.  This group included representatives
 from the Communist Youth of Mexico (JC( the "revolutionary sector"
 of the National Teachers Union (SN TE), the Worker-Farmer Party of
 Mexico (POCM), and the University Student Federation (FEU).  Fourteen
 other groups, however, opposed the recognition of the Trotskyis and
 A
 the denunciation of the Mexican government.  This group was led by the
 Popular Youth (JP), which is the affiliate of Vicente Lombardo Toledanos
 Popular Socialist Party (PPS).. and other groups controlled by the PPS.

 This controversy, although not known to be a reflection of the Sino-
 Soviet dispute, appears to parallel two of the fundamental points of Sino-
 Soviet disagreement:  the degree to which violence shall be used to effect

 the transition to Socialism; and the degree to which the national bour-
 geoisie (represented by Lopez Mateos) can be trusted and used as allies.
 Since their defeat at the Youth Congress, the extremist elements
 in Mexico have been further weakened by the repressive measures taken
 by the government against student and teacher demonstrators in August,
 ) 4k,
 including the arrest of Siqueiros,   and by the removal of Leonel Padilla
 and Cesar Augusto Velasco Sandoval from their positions of leadership
 in the Communist Youth.  The basic reason for the removal of Padilla and
 Velasco, which was effected by the Communist party leaders, was re-
 ported to be their close connection and collaboration with the Trotskyir
 POR.  It was Padilla, apparently, who had b 'en in charge of the sale of
 the Siqueiros painting in Cuba for a.rm d revo-lutio  ,ry funding.  Some -
 what later, the explusion of two members of the Juventud Comunista
 for advocating armed revolt in Mexico was reported.
 The foregoing information suggests that a purge of extremist
 elementser among the orthodox Communists has been taking place,
 )_,ralleled by governmental action which has resulted in the imprison-
 ment or persecution of Communist and extreme leftist agitators.  Al-
 though all the Communist organizations protest the imprisonment of
 Demetrio Vallejo, Dionisio Encina, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and others,
 the practical result of the arrests has favored the elements which seem
 to support the Khrushchev line/ and has weakened the extremist elements
 among whom ZEre Chinese views might find support.  The current domin-
 ance of the pro-Soviet elements within the orthodox Communist party is
 illustrated in an editorial in the PCM organ La Voz de Mexico for
 1 January 1961.  This lauds the CPSU, supports coexistence as the policy
 for world Communism and ignores Communist China.
 Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, arrested at the same time, was released
 and represented the PCM at the meeting of Communist parties in Moscow,
 returning on 18 December.  Oton Salazar, leader of the revolutionary
 sector of the Mexican Teachers' Union (SNTE), is now reported,-Wdis-
 creditedd within the SNTE.

 As indicated above, in connection with the conflict which developed
 at the Latin American Youth Congress, the policies of the Peoples' Social-
 ist Party (PPS), led by Vicente Lombardo Toledano, tend to support the
 Soviet, rather than the Chinese, point of view.  The PPS, which defines
 itself as /''Marxist-Leninis fy favors  the constant development of the ex-
 isting democratic regime and, in due course, of the peoples' democracy,
 in order to arrive at the establishment of the socialist regime. "  In practice,
 it defends collaboration with the bourgeois administration of President Lopez
 Mateos, which it seeks to infiltrate and influence, and attacksixtremist
 sectarian  opposition to the administration as counterproductive.
 Lombardo's policies were exemplified in his condemnation of the
 railroad strike of March 1959, which was supported by the PCM and the
 POCM? and which resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of Demetrio
 Vallejo and other leaders, and subsequently Dion4sio Encina.  Lombardo's
 statement concerning the strike came on 3a AprilA after his return from
 the USSR.  Later, in July.9/, he      party members that he had been
 told by Soviet Communist leaders to assume the  dominant roleVin all

 leftist activities in Mexico. A Subsequently,rLombardo has reorganized and
 renamed his party to identify it more closely with international Commun-

 H
 for an anti-imperialist front in Mexico.
 e has also stated privately that
 Soviet and satellite officials instructed him to (reactivate y all existing
 friendship societies under his control and direction.
 There can be little doubt that Lombardo has been well informed
 on the Sino-Soviet rift through his high WFTU position and his Soviet
 contacts. He attended the twenty-first meeting of the WT"f-f,+ Executive
 Committee of the WFTU as well as the WFTU General Council Meeting in
 Peiping in June 1960, at which the dispute began to grow heated.  Subse-
 quently, Lombardo published an article in Siempre (Mexico City, 20 July

 1960) presenting an examination of the international scene "as seen from
 China". and representing "the opinions of the leaders and the people of
 the countries which are building 4cialism".  The article serves to sup-
 port the Soviet point of view, however, with respect to the castrophic
 nature of a new war which "for the  ocialist countries, would represent
 the immediate paralyzation of their constructive programs; that is to say,
 the impossibility of building  ocialism within the anticipated time. "
 In summary, it is apparent that the Soviets have made a strenuous
 effort to strengthen their position in Mexico, relying heavily on the PPS
 and certain leaders of the PCM.  Chinese views, although known to party
 leaders, have found no significant support or acknowledgment .  However,

 there exist certain pro-Cuban extremist elements, Trotsky'
 .i and dis-
 gruntled Stalinists who may favorably respond to Chinese Communist
 overtures, should these be made to them.  Although there is little pros-
 pect of the development of a strong pro-Chinese Communist element in
 Mexico, the existence of a great number of separate, rival Communist
 parties and cliques may provide a useful index to the nature of various
 international ideological trends or schisms.
 ,I .Other Latin American Countries
 In other Latin American countries there are also differences within
 the CP,Isk and between the CP's and other revolutionary groups which are
 similar to those existing in Cuba and Mexico.  These involve conflicts be-
 tween'Yactivists' and "pacifistsY, between youth and age, between the inex-
 perienced and the experienced.  For example, the head of the Radical Youth
 in Chile recently wrote to a friend and former Cuban student leader, now
 an INRA official, that:
 "In Chile... a start must be made at once.  Only one of
 the political leaders of Chile has the mind and determination t
 to pursue the revolutionary course.  That is Clotario Blest....
 This attitude has almost brought him to disgrace in the eyes of
 the leftist political leaders, especially those of the Communist
 Party, who think we must still wait indefinitely.

 In Brazil, a conflict exists within the CP itself, where a leftist
 faction headed by Mauricio Grabois, Calil Chadde, Carlos Danielli, and
 others has opposed the policies defined in the party's
 which they claim defer-  socialist goals and abandon   s
 consideration of violent action. This controversy is apparently becoming
 linked with the problem of the support of the Cuban revolution, and the
 dissatisfaction of the Fidelistas with the 'pacifist policies of the PSP is
 being duplicated in their attitude toward the PSP.  Thus Calil Chadde  -:;'
 elliflWd that certain Cuban revolutionary leaders had complained to him
 in August 1960 about the lack of Brazilian support for the Cuban4evolu-
 tion, and a Brazilian editor, who conferred with Prensa Latina executives
 in Habana in November, reported that unnamed Cuban officials had criti-
 cized the Brazilian CP for refusing to allow other groups, such as the
 Trotskyites, to join in pro-Cuban activities.  The Cubans indicated that
 they would like to find some o0n  group other than the CP to assume direc-
 tion of pro-Cuban activities in Brazil, but that the CP was the only one
 which could be relied on.
 Conflicts of this type exist also in other countries  and may easily
 become associated with the PSP-Fidelista conflict and also, eventually,
 with the Sino-Soviet conflict as the two Communist powers seek to extend
 or strengthen their re  esti a policies and as local Communists or revolu-
 tionaries look for support for their own policies or tactics/as determined
 by their own views of the opportunities presented by the immediate national
 political situation.  To date, there has been little evidence of direct Chinese
 involvement in such factionalism and conflict that does exist, but this
 situation cs      change now that a Chinese Communist base for operations
 has been established in Habana.
