 VIETNAM
 The Viet Cong stepped up both military and terrorist
 attacks throughout the country this week, but contin-
 ued to avoid contact with large-scale allied opera-
 tions.   The Constituent Assembly is again making pro-
 gress on the constitution after a brief recess follow-
 ing the assassination of southern political leader Tran
 Van Van.   The Liberation Front has opened a permanent
 office in Hanoi.
 CHINESE NEED FOR FOOD IMPORTS GREATER THAN EVER
 With the year's harvest below the level reached in 1957,
 the last normal year before the  "leap forward," grain
 purchases for the current crop year seem likely to ex-
 ceed the 6.3 million tons imported in the preceding
 twelve months.
 GROWING DISORDER IN CHINA'S  "CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 Conflicts in the top leadership appear to be sharpen-
 ing, but mounting disorder within the Red Guard move-
 ment and the lack of decisive action indicate that no
 faction or individual has thus far made significant
 gains.
 MALAYSIA CONDUCTS ANTI-COMMUNIST SWEEP IN SARAWAK
 A security sweep on 6-8 December netted 119 members and
 supporters of the Chinese-dominated Sarawak Communist
 Organization, but probably missed the top leadership,
 COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN THAILAND
 The Communists,  in addition to their activities in the
 northeast, are apparently scoring gains among some tri-

 their organization in the mid-south.

 Prime Minister Souvanna has made a temporary alliance
 with some regional military commanders in an effort to
 ensure that the 1 January election produces a national
 assembly more amenable to his direction.

 COMMUNIST CHINA EXPLOITS MACAO RIOTS
 Portuguese capitulation to Peking's demands has prob-
 ably satisfied the Chinese for the time being but has
 weakened the position of Portuguese authorities.
 Europe
 USSR MAINTAINS ANTI-CHINESE MOMENTUM
 Moscow has further stepped up its campaign to ostracize
 China's leadership.   The Soviets appear genuinely con-
 cerned over the excesses of the Red Guard upheaval in
 China and convinced that Mao's policies have made him
 vulnerable to foreign and domestic opposition.   Thus,
 they believe the time is ripe to strike out against
 him.
 KOSYGIN VISIT TO FRANCE HEAVIER ON FORM THAN SUBSTANCE
 Both France and the USSR made the most of Premier Kosy-
 gin's visit as an expression of the expanding common
 interests of the two nations.   Each was careful,  how-
 ever,  to leave itself room for maneuver on major inter-
 national issues.
 WEST GERMAN GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
 Chancellor Kiesinger in his policy statement on 13 De-
 cember set forth positive measures to deal with internal
 problems but took a more cautious stand on foreign pol-

 THE UN CONSIDERS RHODESIA
 Amendments proposed by the African bloc go considerably
 further than Britain's request for limited sanctions.
 London would probably accept some extension of the eco-
 nomic sanctions but nothing which would force it to a
 blockade of South Africa or to a commitment to impose
 majority rule on Rhodesia before independence.
 ARAB DEFENSE COUNCIL MEETING
 Under pressure, Jordan assented to-an Arab Defense Coun-
 cil decision to post Saudi and Iraqi troops in West Jor-
 dan.   King Husayn may still hope to forestall their ar-
 rival because of the precedent this would set for sta-
 tioning Egyptian or Syrian troops whose presence would
 serve as a threat to his regime.
 TANZANIAN MILITARY BUILDUP CONTINUES WITH COMMUNIST
 SUPPORT
 Tanzania fears Portuguese retaliation for its support
 to the Mozambique rebels and seeks to strengthen its
 military forces as well as its border defensive posi-
 tions.   It is turning increasingly to Communist China
 for hardware and other military assistance.
 INSTABILITY IN THREE WEST AFRICAN ENTENTE STATES
 Political unrest,  caused in part by the impact of aus-
 terity budgets, has stimulated a tightening of military
 control in Upper Volta and a structural change in the

 DOMINICAN COMMUNISTS FAIL TO MOUNT GENERAL STRIKE
 The strike was to have protested Balaguer's Christmas

 of the issue,  lack of popular support,  and absence of

 FAR EAST
 Recent events in China have provided further
 glimpses of the scope and violence of the struggle
 wracking the Peking regime. The conflict has not only
 produced areas of chaos and anarchy throughout the
 country but has brought the effectiveness of some as-
 pects of the regime's political authority into ques-
 tion for the first time since the Communist revolution.
 These events strengthen the impression that the
 faction headed by Lin Piao,  claiming Mao's blessing,
 has been stalemated in its drive to destroy opponents
 of the "cultural revolution" and to "reorganize" the
 party and its central committee.
 Since late November
 crusading Red Guards in the provinces have encountered
 stiff resistance from party committees,  resulting in
 bloody clashes in widely scattered parts of China.  The
 party journal Red Flag now complains that enemies
 within the party have  "confused the masses,"  "created
 sects," and  "instigated armed battles."
 Against this background of chaos and defiance of
 central authority, China faces a worsening food situa-
 tion which could have important influence on the outcome
 of the leadership struggle and the shape of future pol-
 icies.   China's need for food imports is greater now
 than at any time since 1962.   Rations have been reduced
 in many urban and rural areas, and officials in at least
 one province anticipate peasant  "resistance" to the
 enforcement of food distribution plans.
 In view of the difficulties at home,  Peking ap-
 parently welcomed the recent disorders in Macao and
 took the opportunity to improve its tarnished image as
 the protector of Chinese abroad.   In Malaysia,  however,
 the almost exclusively Chinese Sarawak Communist Or-
 ganization suffered a considerable setback last week
 when government security forces rounded u  more than
 a hundred of its leaders and members.

 VIETNAM
 Communist forces this week
 intensified the level of their
 conventional military activity
 and terrorist/sabotage actions,
 largely against vulnerable South
 Vietnamese Government targets,
 in an apparent effort to score
 psychologically significant mili-
 tary gains prior to the Christ-
 mas truce.   At the same time,  how-
 ever they continued to avoid ma-
 jor contact with large-scale al-
 lied search-and-destroy operations.
 The most significant enemy-
 initiated action occurred on 10
 December in Thua Thien Province,
 when an estimated Viet Cong/
 North Vietnamese Army  (NVA)  bat-
 talion using heavy mortar and
 small-arms fire attacked a South
 Vietnamese Army regimental com-
 mand post and battalion base camp
 10 miles northwest of Hue.    Twenty-
 four government regulars were
 killed and 85 wounded in the at-
 tack.   The Communists captured
 over 100 weapons.
 Other targets of battalion-
 sized Viet Cong assaults included
 an ARVN base camp in the delta
 province of Chuong Thien,  two
 Regional Forces companies under-
 going training at the Van Kiep
 Training Center  in Phuoc Tuy Prov-
 ince, and a Vietnamese paramili-
 tary company on patrol in Hau
 Nghia Province.   Cumulative gov-
 ernment losses resulting from
 these actions included 33 killed,
 15 wounded,  and 196 captured.
 Communist terrorists and
 saboteurs concentrated on tar-
 gets in the Saigon area and in
 northern I Corps.   Several
 grenade attacks were reported
 against Vietnamese National Po-
 lice in Saigon, while guards de-
 tected a number of mines set to
 destroy shipping in the capital's
 main waterways.   The Viet Cong,
 for the third time in six weeks,
 also managed a partially success-
 ful attack on the major US am-
 munition dump at Long Binh,  13
 miles northeast of Saigon.
 In the north, Viet Cong
 saboteurs accelerated their in-
 terdiction campaign against Na-
 tional Route 1 in an apparent,
 and at least temporarily success-
 ful,                                                                           effort to isolate Thua Thien
 Province from adjacent Quang Tri
 and Quang Nam provinces.   In ad-
 dition, Communist mortar crews on
 14 December shelled a major South
 Vietnamese POL storage area near
 Tam Ky,  the capital of Quang Tin
 Province, destroying nearly
 40,000 gallons of fuel.
 The assassination of south-
 ern political leader Tran Van Van
 on 7 December does not appear
 to be generating any overt polit-
 ical repercussions.   By its
 prompt public identification of
 one of the assassins as a Viet
 Cong and by its willingness to
 cooperate with the Constituent
 Assembly in conducting a full
 investigation of the crime,  the
 Ky government avoided any accusa-
 tions of complicity in the kill-
 ing.   However, there are con-
 tinued reservations in some cir-
 cles as to the political affilia-
 tion of the assassin;  statements
 deploring the incident issued by
 both the Peoples - Armed Forces
 Advisory Council and the Con-
 stituent Assembly made no refer-
 ence to Viet Cong responsibility.

 After paying full honors
 to Tran Van Van,  including an
 adjournment of five days,  the
 Constituent Assembly on 12 Decem-
 ber resumed its debate on the
 form of the future government.
 The major issue in the debate
 was the organization of the execu-
 tive branch, and on 15 December
 the assembly voted to adopt,  in
 principle, a modified presiden-
 tial system which would include
 an appointed prime minister.
 Meanwhile, the second and
 third largest blocs of delegates
 officially merged, thus forming
 the largest single groups in the
 assembly.   The members of the new
 bloc represent several elements
 in the assembly including
 Catholics,  Hoa Hao,  and Cao Dai.
 They are mainly conservative in
 their political outlook and are
 generally sympathetic to the Ky
 regime.
 The government has not yet
 officially informed the assembly
 of its decision on 1 December
 to reject the latter's requests
 for changes in its founding law.
 It is possible that government
 leaders have decided not to make
 a formal reply on the question
 unless pressed.
 Hanoi Improves Rail Links
 With China
 Hanoi has begun improvement
 on the Lao Cai - Hanoi line in
 northwest North Vietnam.  Photogra-
 phy                     revealed that        25X1
 extensive improvements are under
 way on this line to   straighten
 out curves and rebuild bombed-out
 bridges.   Until recently this
 line had been neglected in favor
 of the more important northeast
 link which carries virtually all
 rail shipments of foreign aid.
 Now,  however,  internal Chinese
 rail improvements make it possi-
 ble to tie the northwestern DRV
 line into the main Chinese rail
 system.
 Liberation Front Opens
 Hanoi Office
 With a burst of propaganda
 on the theme of north-south unity,
 the Communists opened an overt,
 permanent office of the Libera-
 tion Front in Hanoi this week.
 Hanoi is virtually the last Com-
 munist country to accept a Front
 office in its capital, having
 apparently held out until now in
 the belief that such a move would
 add color to allied statements
 that the Front is controlled by
 North Vietnam.   In view of the
 qrowing public evidence of Hanoi's
 close and direct involvement in
 the war,  however,  the old reluc-
 tance to set up the Front openly
 in Hanoi may have waned.   The
 move provides a dramatic public
 demonstration to Viet Cong sup-
 porters in the South of the im-
 portance which the North Vietnamese
 attach to the Front and to the
 southern role in the conflict.

 CHINESE NEED FOR FOOD IMPORTS GREATER THAN EVER
 Because of the worsening
 food situation, Peking's imports
 of grain in the twelve-month pe-
 riod that began last July may ex-
 ceed the 6.3 million tons it im-
 ported in the preceding year.
 A recent purchase of 914,000
 tons of wheat from Canada exhausts
 the maximum of 2.5 million tons
 that Canada must sell each year
 under a three-year agreement
 signed this fall.   Purchases from
 all sources for delivery during
 the year which began in July 1966
 already total about five million
 tons, and China has reportedly
 asked Argentina--which has sup-
 plied a million tons or more
 during each of the past three
 years--for as much wheat as can
 be spared.   It is not certain,
 however, that Argentina will be
 willing or able to sell substan-
 tial quantities of grain to China
 this year.   Either Canada or Aus-
 tralia might be willing to sup-
 ply additional quantities al-
 though there is no indication
 that China is negotiating with
 either.   The Chinese could also
 seek small quantities of grain
 from marginal suppliers such as
 Mexico and. France as they have
 in the past.

 GROWING DISORDER IN CHINA'S "CULTURAL REVOLUTION"
 Conflicts in the top leader-
 ship appear to be sharpening, but
 mounting disorder within the Red
 Guard movement and the lack of
 decisive action indicate that no
 faction or individual has thus
 far made significant gains.
 For the past two weeks Red
 Guards and newspapers in the cap-
 ital have focused attacks on lit-
 erary and political figures who
 were early victims of the "cul-
 tural revolution," giving the
 impression that the stage was
 being  set for new disclosures.
 This phase was sparked by a
 Madame Mao speech,  released on
 3 December, demanding that for-
 mer Peking mayor Peng Chen and
 other "former" officials be "fur-
 ther exposed."   According to
 posters, Madame Mao's words in-
 spired one group of fanatical
 Guards to rush to the home of
 Peng and other officials on 4 De-
 cember and to "seize" them "as a
 warning to those still following
 the bourgeois road."   The reports
 do not reveal what if anything
 was done to Peng, who presumably
 has been confined at home since
 his downfall last May.
 Most of the posters put up
 since call for "striking down"
 Peng Chen,  former propaganda chief
 Lu Ting-i,  former army chief of
 staff and secret police official
 Lo Jui-ching, and Yang Shang-kun,
 once an aide to Mao.
 Attempts have also been re-
 ported to bring down new victims.
 According to a poster seen on
 14 December, Tao Chin--fourth in
 the hierarchy--has criticized
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 A wall newspaper displayed on
 8 December said that now that
 Peng et al have been "exposed,"
 it is time to go after their "big
 boss" Liu and his deputy Teng.
 It renewed demands for the dis-
 missal of the two.
 Liu and party general secre-
 tary Teng Hsiao-ping, who had
 been dominant leaders of the
 party machinery for many years,
 were weakened at the party plenum
 in August, but neither was dis-
 missed and both have appeared
 regularly with Mao at Red Guard
 rallies.   Liu continues to sign
 state messages as chairman of the
 Chinese Peoples Republic.
 The 8 December poster implied
 that Kang Sheng, a long-time in-
 telligence official who was pro-
 moted into the politburo standing
 committee in August,  is involved
 in the attack on Liu.   The poster
 said that Kang was one of several
 "revolutionary comrades" Liu had
 been "keeping down" in the past.
 Kang, reputedly a cunning and
 conniving individual, headed the
 party secret police in the early
 1940s.   He was relegated to a
 provincial post about 1949 and
 later demoted from a full to an
 alternate member of the politburo.
 Demands to dismiss Liu and
 Teng have not been endorsed in au-
 thoritative regime pronouncements.

 of Red Flag, broadcast on 12 De-
 cember,  conceded that there was
 still a "tiny handful" of incor-
 rigibles to be isolated and
 brought down.   The editorial
 dealt mainly, however, with the
 problem of currently active lead-
 ers who oppose the  "cultural revo-
 lution."   It probably was not re-
 ferring to Liu and Teng, whose
 freedom of action was severely re-
 stricted at the August plenum.
 The editorial provides the
 first authoritative evidence that
 opposing Red Guard factions are
 directed by different individuals
 in the current leadership.   It
 criticizes officials who have
 "confused the masses,"  "created
 sects" and  "instigated armed
 battles," but ends weakly with a
 new plea that errant comrades
 repent and come over to the Mao-
 Lin side.                      This contrasts with
 the confident tone of earlier
 attacks on opponents and demands
 that  "fence sitters" choose sides.
 crusading Red Guards in the prov-
 inces have encountered stiff re-
 sistance from party committees.
 This may account for the defensive
 tone of the latest Red Flag edi-
 torial.   Bloody clashes -involving
 Guards sent from Peking and local
 workers have been reported in
 widely scattered areas of China.
 After a particularly bloody melee
 in Chungking on 4 December,  in
 which 11 were killed and 200 in-
 jured,  the Red Guards announced
 they would institute a period of
 "red terror" and  "great disor-
 ders."   Their ability to press
 attacks is clearly limited,  how-
 ever.  The Third Red Guard Head-
 quarters in Peking, which appar-
 ently is directing most Red Guard
 attacks,  complained in a recent
 newspaper article that people
 it sent to the provinces to in-
 vestigate incidents were beaten,
 imprisoned, or often simply dis-
 appeared.

 In a major effort to cripple      1  Youth Association and the Sarawak

 (SCO),  the Special Branch of the
 Sarawak Police carried out a large-
 scale roundup of SCO members and
 sympathizers on 6-8 December.   In
 addition to the 119 persons arrested,
 valuable documents and some funds
 were captured.   Although the Chief
 of the Special Branch contends that
 all top-level SCO members slated
 for arrest were taken in,the roundup
 probably did not reach the top lead-
 _p]
 The Sarawak Communist Organi-
 zation has posed a major security
 problem to Sarawak since the mid-
 1950s.   Almost exclusively Chinese,
 it has an estimated armed strength
 of 1,500-2,000,  including 600-800
 trained in Indonesia.   It maintains
 several illegal front organizations,
 most notably the Sarawak Advanced
 Farmers Association.   The SCO,
 moreover, has deeply penetrated
 the Sarawak United Peoples'  Party
 (SUPP),  a large Chinese opposition
 party that advocates greater au-
 tonomy for Sarawak.                                                                              SUPP now is

 digenous opposition group,  in prep-
 aration for elections next year.
 A number of SUPP members were taken
 into custody during the roundup.
 The government contends that
 the arrests were aimed exclusively
 at the Communist threat, but lead-
 ers of the Chinese community are
 reported to be virtually unanimous
 in interpreting the arrests as an
 effort by the governing Alliance
 Party to intimidate SUPP.   Stephen

 General, has openly charges the      25X1
 government with using dictatorial
 means to suppress the opposition.

 In order to block the re-elec-

 of 34 candidates for the 59 assembly

 its tripartite form of government,

 COMMUNIST CHINA EXPLOITS
 Peking has taken advantage
 of recent disorders in Macao to
 wring concessions from the local
 authorities which further weaken
 the Portuguese position in the
 colony.   Using modern "gunboat
 diplomacy," Peking has publicly
 underscored the fact that Macao
 exists only on Chinese sufferance
 and has attempted to improve its
 tarnished image as the protector
 of Chinese abroad.
 The trouble began in mid-
 November with efforts by local
 Chinese in Macao to settle a long-
 standing grievance--their failure
 for more than a year to obtain
 permission to construct a new Chi-
 nese school.   These efforts re-
 sulted in riots on 3 and 4 Decem-
 ber which were harshly suppressed
 by the police.
 Following the riots,  Peking
 moved four additional gunboats to
 the area and staged Red Guard
 rallies in neaby Kwangtung Prov-
 ince supporting demands made by
 the Macao Chinese.   On 11 December
 an authoritative People's Daily
 Commentator article warned that
 the Portuguese would have to ac-
 cept the Chinese demands or suf-
 fer the consequences.
 On 12 December the Macao
 governor announced that he had
 accepted  "in entirety" the de-
 mands of the Kwangtung provincial
 authorities.   These demands were
 almost identical with those made
 Page 11
 MACAO RIOTS
 by Chinese Communist elements in
 Macao for an apology and compensa-
 tion for the riots but included
 the requirement that the Portu-
 guese take measures to prevent
 Chinese Nationalist operations in
 the colony.   On the following
 day,  the governor accepted two
 additional demands put forward
 by Chinese elements in Macao.
 Peking has not yet publicly
 commented on the Portuguese capit-
 ulation. However,  the unofficial
 Chinese Communist representative
 in Macao has indicated his satis-
 faction with the governor's
 statement, and four Chinese
 Communist gunboats reportedly
 withdrew,  suggesting that Peking
 intends to relax its pressure
 for the present.
 The display of Portuguese
 inability and unwillingness to
 resist Chinese Communist pressure
 makes it clear that Peking can at
 any time score further cheap and
 easy political victories at
 Portugal's expense.   For the mo-
 ment,  however,                                                                          Communist China
 will probably be satisfied with
 the acknowledgment by the Macao
 authorities that Peking has the
 predominant role in respect to
 Chinese citizens of Macao,.   None-
 theless, unplanned incidents which
 might provoke riots and renewed
 Chinese intervention cannot be
 ruled out.

 EUROPE
 The Soviet leadership is pressing ahead with
 its political offensive against Peking.   In the
 party central committee meeting this week, the em-
 phasis was explicitly on "the struggle of the CPSU
 for the unity of the Communist movement."   The eco-
 nomic plan and budget for 1967, which are on the
 agenda of the Supreme Soviet now in session, took
 second place in the central committee's delibera-
 tions.
 The leadership thus got a formal expression
 of approval from the party's ranking officials for
 its policy toward China, and put in still another
 call for an international conference of Communist
 parties.
 In Western Europe, the NATO ministerial talks
 got under way with hopes of completing permanent
 nuclear planning arrangements and developing a
 larger political role for NATO in the context of
 both intra-European and East-West relations.   The
 US - UK - West German talks on the problem of off-
 setting the foreign exchange costs of the British
 Army of the Rhine have recessed until January.
 The British, with a financial assist from the US,
 have agreed to maintain this force at present
 levels for six months.
 In Bonn, Chancellor Kiesinger's first general
 policy statement to the Bundestag contained no
 sharp departures from established West German po-
 sitions on major international issues, and sounded
 a positive tone toward dealings with France and
 Eastern Europe.   With regard to a nuclear role
 for West Germany,  the chancellor reiterated past
 commitments.   The lack of new policies may signify
 differences of opinion within the newly formed
 coalition which may be difficult to reconcile.

 USSR MAINTAINS ANTI-CHINESE MOMENTUM
 Moscow has further stepped
 up its campaign to ostracize
 China's leadership.   The Soviets
 appear genuinely concerned over
 the excesses of the Red Guard up-
 heaval in China and convinced
 that Mao's policies have made
 him vulnerable to foreign and
 domestic opposition.   Thus,  they
 believe the time is ripe to strike
 out against him.
 A plenum of the Soviet party
 central committee on 12 and 13
 December clearly indicated that
 the Chinese problem remains the
 main preoccupation and most press-
 ing foreign policy concern of the
 Russian leaders, particularly
 Brezhnev.   The plenum was de-
 voted primarily to a foreign pol-
 icy review focusing on Sino-So-
 viet relations.   A number of So-
 viet ambassadors were summoned
 to Moscow for the occasion.
 Capping vigorous personal efforts
 over recent weeks to drum up
 wide support for Moscow's offen-
 sive against China, Brezhnev him-
 self presented the key report.
 The text of his speech has
 not yet been released.   However,
 a central committee decision, pub-
 lished on 13 December,  in effect,
 summarized his presentation and
 formally and--of course--"unani-
 mously" endorsed the "political
 line and practical activities"
 taken against China.
 The plenum met during an
 increasingly vehement propaganda
 campaign,  notable for its per-
 sonal attacks on "Mao and his
 clique."   Politburo member Shele-
 pin attacked Mao by name and ac-
 cused "the present Chinese lead-
 ers" of preventing an early Com-
 munist victory in Vietnam.   So-
 viet broadcasts to China in man-
 darin have condemned the "in-
 dividual dictatorship of Mao Tse-
 tung."   The Russian populace is
 being fed a steady diet of "yellow
 peril" propaganda,  including in-
 flammatory charges of Chinese
 designs on Russian territory.
 The central committee state-
 ment scored the Chinese party's
 11th plenum last August, and
 asserted that the decisions taken
 at that meeting indicated a "new
 and dangerous stage"  in Mao's
 anti-Soviet crusade.   The So-
 viet document marks the most au-
 thoritative reaction to the Chi-
 nese plenum, and gives formal
 sanction to the more aggressive
 anti-Chinese tactics Moscow has
 pursued since last summer.
 The Soviet plenum decision
 recorded Moscow's "agreement with
 the views of fraternal   parties
 that favorable conditions are now
 being created for a new interna-
 tional Communist conference."
 The decision added, however,
 that such a conference "should
 be well prepared in the course
 of mutual consultations among
 the parties."   The statement
 thus echoes Brezhnev's earlier
 guarded endorsements of the

 idea of a world conference.
 Stress on the necessity for ade-
 quate preparations means, how-
 ever,                     that Moscow recognizes that
 there is considerable resistance
 to the idea of a formal all-
 party meeting on the order of
 the 1957 and 1960 conferences.
 The various parties will no
 doubt put their own interpreta-
 tions on the phrase "adequate
 preparation," and many of them
 will be content if the project
 never leaves the "preparatory"
 stage.
 The parties of Eastern Eu-
 rope are divided over the con-
 vening of a world-wide conclave.
 The Bulgarians, Hungarians,
 Czechs, and East Germans can
 be expected to support any kind
 of a Soviet-sponsored conference,
 but for the Poles and Rumanians
 the issue hinges on the nature
 of any conference.
 Warsaw continues to see lit-
 tle advantage to itself and many
 hazards in an international meet-
 ing.   Everything that is known
 about Gomulka's position sug-
 gests that he would participate
 only if the meeting were designed
 not to condemn China but to re-
 endorse the independence and
 equality of individual parties.
 In keeping with Moscow's
 admission that there is much
 work to be done before a world
 gathering can occur, various
 moves are reportedly under way
 to convene regional meetings
 in Europe, and probably else-
 where.                                      25X1
 a gather-
 ing of European parties to focus
 on European security, Vietnam,

 movement may take place in War-
 saw early next year.

 KOSYGIN VISIT TO FRANCE HEAVIER ON FORM THAN SUBSTANCE
 Both France and the USSR
 made the most of Premier Kosygin's
 visit as an expression of the ex-
 panding common interests of the
 two nations.   Each was careful,
 however, to leave itself room for
 maneuver on major international
 issues.
 Neither side appears to have
 expected any more from the visit
 than the generally predictable
 items featured in the joint reso-
 lution released on 9 December.
 Promises of technical and scien-
 tific cooperation, more trade, a
 consular agreement, and further
 exchanges of visits foster the
 impression of growing political
 concordance that both sides wish
 to project.   Each values this im-
 pression for its own reasons:
 France in order to bolster its
 image of independence,  the USSR
 to encourage other Western Euro-
 pean nations to break free of
 lingering cold-war restraints
 on dealing with Moscow.
 The only touchy interna-
 tional problem that made its way
 into the resolution was Vietnam.
 The two countries reiterated their
 view that the war stems from "for-
 eign interference" and is a threat
 to peace.   The statement in the
 resolution varies little from
 the declaration made at the end
 of De Gaulle's visit to the USSR
 last June.   There was no sign
 that Kosygin was able to soften
 De Gaulle's opposition to a non-
 proliferation agreement.
 The German problem was side-
 stepped in the resolution.   Kosy
 gin made the usual Soviet points
 on the subject in his public
 statements during the visit,
 stoutly reaffirming Soviet oppo-
 sition to reunification and any
 change in the frontiers.   De Gaulle
 appears to have wanted silence
 on the problem so as not to
 jeopardize overtures he expects
 from Bonn.   Each may have hoped
 to find some leeway in the other's
 position, and there was probably
 some mutual disappointment.
 It is clear that the USSR
 believes that a Franco-Soviet un-
 derstanding has only a limited
 usefulness in dealing with con-
 tentious issues such as Germany
 and European security.   The So-
 viets recognize that no meaning-
 ful solutions are possible without
 US participation.   During his
 visit, Kosygin pointedly expressed
 his hope for better relations with
 the US and did not rule out an
 American role in the settlement
 of European  roblems

 suggesting that these may pre-
 occupy the new government for the
 next several months.   The emphasis
 on economy signals a less forth-
 coming attitude toward assuming
 any major new international obli-
 gations such as troop offset pay-
 ments, development aid, and Com-
 mon market contributions.
 The government's domestic
 program incorporates long-term
 Socialist objectives such as em-
 phasis on economic growth and
 high employment.   Concessions by
 the Christian Democrats in this
 area may have facilitated agree-
 ment on Kiesinger's foreign pol-
 icy statement that varies little
 from previous German policy.   Al-
 though Kiesinger stressed Bonn's
 long-standing desire to develop
 its relations with Eastern Europe
 and,  if possible, to establish
 diplomatic relations, his refer-
 ences to the Oder-Neisse frontier
 and the Munich Agreement did not
 go beyond Bonn's previous posi-
 tions.   Bonn traditionally has
 maintained that only a reunified
 Germany can settle the border
 question.   Though Bonn acknowl-
 edges that Hitler voided the
 Munich Pact by invading Czecho-
 slovakia,  it refuses to accept
 the Czech view that the agreement
 was invalid from the start be-
 cause it had been concluded under
 duress.   Despite the known desire
 of Foreign Minister Brandt to
 abandon all nuclear sharing
 schemes involving "hardware,"
 the declaration left this ques-
 tion open.
 The government's position
 on East Germany clearly reflects
 a compromise.   Kiesinger said
 Bonn will seek to expand trade
 and credits and increase "con-
 tacts" that would not imply rec-
 ognition, a cautious formulation
 unlikely to produce the kind of
 closer ties the Socialists want.
 The emphasis on improving re-
 lations with France reflects the
 prevailing sentiment in both gov-
 erning parties.   Kiesinger and
 Brandt have long advocated greater
 "balance" in relations with Wash-
 ington and Paris.   The specific
 actions Bonn may take are unclear,
 but one immediate objective will
 be to attempt to instill new
 life into the 1963 Franco-German
 Friendship Treaty.
 In any case, though Bonn
 will probably be less willing to
 follow the US lead than it has
 in the past, the Kiesinger gov-
 ernment appears to want to main-
 tain close ties with the US.   it
 is aware of Germany's dependence
 on the US for its security and
 shows no sign of a willingness
 to endanger this guarantee for
 other objectives.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Middle East is experiencing the opening
 rounds of what could develop into a series of new
 crises, any one of which could give rise to new
 international alignments and confrontations or to
 domestic turmoil.   At the same time,  it is far
 from certain that any one situation will crystalize
 into major crisis proportion.   Each is susceptible
 to postponement and short-term solution.
 The Arab Defense Council decision to post for-
 eign Arab troops to Palestinian west Jordan could
 trigger an explosion in the Arab-Israeli confronta-
 tion.   If the troops move in,  Israel would feel
 obliged to react and their presence would favor
 further instability in Jordan.   If King Husayn
 succeeds in staving off their arrival,  this would
 stimulate new resentments against his regime.
 The Syrian move against the
 Iraq
 Petroleum
 Company pipeline not only adds a
 new
 element of
 instability to oil relationships
 in
 the Middle
 East, but also threatens to hurt
 Iraq
 and Lebanon
 and Syria itself.
 Among tropical African nations the hope to
 bring down the white regime in Rhodesia serves as
 a thread presently linking them in their interna-
 tional outlook.   For the greater part, however, they
 remain preoccupied with their own problems.   This
 is particularly the case with the more significant
 states.   For example,  the trend toward the fraction-
 alization of Nigeria continues despite continuing
 but somewhat halfhearted efforts of the remnant
 central government.   The Tanzanian Government con-
 tinues preoccupied with an alleged threat of in-
 cursion from Portuguese Mozambique as a consequence
 of Tanzanian help to Mozambique nationalist rebels
 and is seeking more Communist arms.

 THE UN CONSIDERS RHODESIA
 The Africa bloc has proposed
 UN action which goes considerably
 beyond Britain's earlier request
 to the Security Council for lim-
 ited mandatory economic sanctions
 against Rhodesia.
 The African proposal, as an
 amendment to Britain's Security
 Council resolution, would extend
 the sanctions to oil and to Rho-
 desian export of coal and manufac-
 tured goods.   Moreover, it would
 deplore specifically South African
 and Portuguese failure to comply
 with earlier voluntary sanctions,
 point out the consequences under
 Article 25 of the UN Charter for
 any future noncompliance,  and in-
 vite Britain to prevent "by all
 means" the transport of oil to
 Rhodesia.   Finally,  the proposal
 seeks to bind Britain not to grant
 Rhodesia independence before ma-
 jority rule is attained and it
 would retain the Rhodesia item on
 the Security Council agenda.
 Several non-African Security
 Council representatives, including
 the British, have indicated that
 parts of the African proposal are
 unacceptable, and various consul-
 tations are under way for a mutu-
 ally acceptable solution.   Britain
 probably would accept the inclu-
 sion of oil in the sanctions but
 is reluctant to include coal since
 Zambia, which uses Rhodesian coal
 for its copper industry, might
 then ask the UK for help.   Brit-
 ain's UN representative has said
 his government prefers not to
 single out South Africa and
 Portugal for condemnation since
 that would destroy possibilities
 for their tacit compliance. Most
 important, London would not ac-
 cept responsibility for policing
 oil sanctions since that would
 almost certainly require a block-
 ade of South Africa.   Nor does
 it want a UN resolution which
 would bind the British Parliament
 to give Rhodesia majority rule
 before independence.
 Meanwhile, Salisbury is toy-
 ing with the idea of unilaterally
 implementing the constitutional
 proposals which Prime Ministers
 agreed to earlier this month.

 ARAB DEFENSE COUNCIL MEETING
 Jordan failed to fend off
 its critics at the Arab Defense
 Council meeting in Cairo last
 week on the issue of stationing
 foreign Arab troops in Palestinian
 west Jordan.   The internal and
 external pressures to strengthen
 Jordan's Israeli frontier finally
 compelled the Jordanians to agree
 to the council's decision that
 Saudi and Iraqi troops be de-
 ployed in Jordan within two
 months of the meeting.
 Jordan's reluctant acquies-
 cence represents a sharp depar-
 ture from its earlier stand and
 indicates how seriously King
 Husayn views the radical Arab
 threat to his regime.   He may be
 playing for time in the hope that
 before two months have passed
 the situation will have changed
 enough for him to say that for-
 eign troops are no longer needed.
 Public comments by.Jordanian
 spokesmen since the Defense Coun-
 cil meeting have suggested that
 as far as Amman is concerned the
 council decision is still tenta-
 tive and conditional.
 In the event Saudi and Iraqi
 troops do move into Jordan,  they
 would be less onerous to the Amman
 government than those of Egypt,
 Syria, or the Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization  (PLO).   The de-
 cision, nevertheless, is at least
 a temporary victory for Husayn's
 radical enemies in Cairo and
 Damascus since it establishes a
 precedent for the eventual entry
 of forces they command.   The is-
 sue is a critical one for Amman
 which would expect troops from
 Egypt, Syria, or the PLO to be
 more of an internal subversive
 threat than a defense against
 Israel.
 Amman is especially concerned
 about the threat posed by the PLO
 which has won increased support
 among Jordan's Palestinian popula-
 tion since the 13 November Israeli
 raid.   At the Cairo meeting Jordan
 remained adamant in its opposition
 to the deployment of PLO military
 forces in west Jordan.   This
 prompted PLO chairman Ahmad
 Shuqayri to reiterate, after the
 meeting,  that whether Amman ac-
 cepted them or not, PLO "army"
 units would force their way into
 Jordan "at the appropriate time."

 TANZANIAN MILITARY BUILDUP CONTINUES WITH COMMUNIST SUPPORT
 Tanzania's deep involvement
 in the southern African libera-
 tion struggle and its fear of
 Portuguese retaliation have caused
 Dar es Salaam to accelerate expan-
 sion of its defense forces.   It
 has sought some military hardware
 from the USSR but is relying on
 Communist China for most military
 assistance.
 Tanzania
 will probably adopt Chinese weap-
 ons   as standard equipment through-
 out the army.   It is not yet clear
 how this will affect the role of
 the present Canadian training mis-
 sion.
 The volunteer reserve, cre-
 ated in late 1964, was to be com-
 posed of trained cadres operat-
 ing from central depots in their
 home districts.   Chinese instruc-
 tors are believed to have helped
 train the first cadres recruited
 for five centers along the Mozam-
 bique frontier.                     These were called
 up on 2 December following the
 explosion of land mines on the
 Tanzanian side of the border.   No
 evidence substantiates Dar es
 Salaam's accusation that Portu-
 guese military personnel were
 involved, but the mines may have
 been laid by local tribesmen in
 Portugal's pay.   For over two
 years the Mozambique Liberation
 Front  (FRELIMO)  has utilized
 Tanzanian sanctuaries and Dar es
 Salaam has become increasingly
 jumpy about the possibility of
 retaliatory attacks.
 China's offer to supply arms
 free of charge plus President
 Nyerere's distrust of Western in-
 tentions in southern Africa have
 been major reasons for his growing
 reliance on China.   Most of the arms
 have already been delivered as a
 gift.   Fourteen medium tanks and
 two landing craft still to come         25X1
 will be new to the Tanzanian inven-
 tory.                                                                        Their crews are to be trained
 in China.
 However,  in addition,  the Tan-
 zanians are getting four torpedo
 boats and more armored personnel
 carriers from the USSR

 INSTABILITY IN THREE WEST AFRICAN ENTENTE STATES
 Considerable political unrest
 has produced a significant tight-
 ening of military control in Upper
 Volta and a structural change in
 the government of Togo.   A shake-
 up also appears imminent in Dahomey.
 With the anniversary of last
 year's military take-over approach-
 ing, Upper Volta's President Lam-
 izana announced on 12 December that
 the army would retain power for
 another four years.   This follows
 months of futile efforts to get
 the country's political leaders to
 agree on means of reconstituting
 civilian rule and probably portends
 even greater military control.  The
 politicians seem unlikely to organ-
 ize effective protests to Lamizana's
 new action.   Future unrest is more
 likely to come from younger army
 officers who feel deprived of their
 full share of power.
 The situation in Togo is the
 most volatile.   Army Chief of Staff
 Eyadema, whose belated backing of
 President Grunitzky during the 21
 November abortive coup was a key
 factor in thwarting that attempt,
 apparently has decided to stick
 with the President for the time
 being.   On 14 December, they se-
 cured a National Assembly vote
 abolishing the post of vice presi-
 dent.                   The move was directed against
 the incumbent, Antoine Meatchi,
 who has long coveted the presidency
 and who has been incriminated in
 the 21 November episode.   The role
 of the army--which appears to have
 divided loyalties--may be decisive
 in determining the nature of the
 future Togolese government.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Developments at the past week's Sixth Con-
 ference of Foreign Ministers of the Latin Ameri-
 can Free Trade Association  (LAFTA)  countries appear
 to have set the stage for approval of a site and
 date for the proposed inter-American summit talks.
 The meeting also, however, underlined the fact
 that many Latin Americans are at best prepared to
 pay only lip service to a major goal of such a
 summit conference:   meaningful progress toward
 economic integration.
 Representatives of the ten LAFTA members met
 in Uruguay primarily to discuss further reduction
 of tariff walls in intra-LAFTA trade.   Very little
 progress was made, however, since by now member
 countries largely have made all the tariff cuts
 they feel they can make without sacrifices.   Hag-

 during the meeting.
 Nevertheless,  it was informally agreed that
 12-14 April appeared convenient for a summit meet-
 ing and that Punta del Este, Uruguay, might be the
 most desirable location for the talks.   Final
 designation of the date,  site,  and agenda for the

 BRAZIL MOVES TOWARD ADOPTING NEW CONSTITUTION
 The Brazilian Government has
 moved to institutionalize the revo-
 lution that brought President Cas-
 tello Branco to power.   On 12 Decem-
 ber, Congress began a six-week spe-
 cial session to consider a new
 constitution proposed by the Presi-
 dent.   He has decreed a strict time-
 table for congressional considera-
 tion of the draft, which virtually
 eliminates meaningful legislative
 participation.   One fourth of either
 house may offer amendments, but the
 administration is unlikely to accept
 major changes.
 By incorporating some of the
 special powers employed by Castello
 Branco,  as well as new provisions,
 the proposed constitution would
 guarantee President-elect Costa e
 Silva sufficient power to govern ef-
 fectively for the next four years.
 It would also provide him with the
 legal means to name his successor.
 It specifies indirect election of
 the president and vice president by
 an electoral college made up of
 members of Congress,  representatives
 of state legislatures, and one dele-
 gate for each 500,000 voters.
 Although the draft has been
 modified somewhat to soften its more
 authoritarian features, it nonethe-
 less embodies strong presidential
 pow9 s.   The president will be able
 t9 decree a state of siege for 60
 days  (extendable for another 60
 days) but will have to justify his
 action to Congress within five days
 after the decree.   He will have
 broad powers to intervene in states,
 and to issue decrees with the force
 of law in the fields of national
 security and public finance. Under
 the proposed constitution Congress
 can approve such decrees, but it
 will have no power to reject or
 amend them.
 Congress's power is to be
 further restricted by reserving in-
 itiation of money bills to the
 president. Congress must act on the
 national budget within a specified
 period or it becomes law as sub-
 mitted.   Ordinary bills submitted
 by the executive must be acted upon
 within 90 days and "urgent" bills
 in 40, or they also become law as
 drafted.   Congress may grant polit-
 ical amnesties, but only if the
 president concurs.
 Military courts are given the
 right to judge civilians for cer-
 tain crimes against national secu-
 rity, but their decisions may be
 appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Persons accused of "subversion or
 corruption" can be prosecuted be-
 fore the Supreme Court and lose
 their political rights.
 The proposed constitution sets
 forth basic principles by which
 political parties may be organized,
 making it difficult to form any new
 party.   The draft also spells out
 the workers' right to strike and
 the right of public employees to
 tenure.
 Substantial government majori-
 ties in both houses of Congress ap-
 pear to guarantee passage but the
 authoritarian nature of the consti-
 tution and the method being used
 to push it through Congress are
 coming under widespread criticism.

 STRONG VENEZUELAN REACTION TO TERRORIST CAMPAIGN
 The government of Venezuela
 has responded vigorously to the
 mounting Communist terrorist cam-
 paign in Caracas.   Acceding to
 military pressure, the government
 has suspended constitutional
 guarantees, and the military has
 occupied Central University.
 The campaign, accompanied by
 small-scale rural guerrilla war-
 fare, began slowly in September
 and increased in intensity dur-
 ing October and November.   By mid-
 November the tally was 65 armed
 robberies, 19 attacks against po-
 lice personnel, and eight attacks
 against the homes of armed forces
 officers.   The campaign hit a peak
 during the last week of November
 when the volume and intensity of
 terrorism reached a level not
 seen since the all-out Communist
 effort in 1963 to topple the gov-
 ernment.
 A sudden lull which took
 place in early December was vio-
 lently shattered on the morning
 of 13 December when in two separate
 attacks a retired army major was
 murdered and the army chief of
 staff wounded.
 Military officers, outraged
 at the latest attacks, directed
 their anger at least as much
 against the government for inac-
 tion as against the terrorists
 and demanded strong and prompt
 government action.   President
 Leoni acceded to the demands by
 immediately suspending constitu-
 tional guarantees.                                                                           This was
 followed by military occupation
 of the sacrosanct Central Uni-
 versity, long a safe haven of
 terrorists.
 The government's moves will
 probably soothe the military
 and at least for the moment end
 government confusion over policy
 toward the terrorists.   At the
 same time, Leoni's bowing to in-
 tense military pressure has prob-
 ably weakened his position vis-
 a-vis the military.  Ambassador
 Bernbaum comments,  "The question
 arises as to whether the mili-
 tary, who have now achieved ex-
 tensive influence and control,
 will relinquish this in the near
 future."
 Whether the government's
 moves will reduce terrorism re-
 mains to be seen.   If the current
 action does not reduce terrorism,
 it is probable that severe strains
 on the government will reappear
 during the coming months.)

 DOMINICAN COMMUNISTS FAIL TO MOUNT GENERAL STRIKE
 The divided Dominican Com-
 munist movement failed to mount
 a general strike on 13 December
 to protest President Balaguer's
 decision to grant only part of
 the traditional Christmas bonus
 to government workers.   The adept
 handling of the issue by Balaguer,
 a lack of popular support for
 the walkout, and the absence of
 support for the strike by non-
 Communist left-wing political
 and labor groups contributed to
 the Communist debacle.
 Balaguer defused the issue
 in early November by reversing
 an earlier decision to grant no
 bonus and by giving instead a
 partial premium to some govern-
 ment employees.   The President's
 policy was aimed at obtaining
 needed savings in the government's
 relatively high wage payments.
 Last year the Garcia Godoy gov-
 ernment was confronted by a wide-
 spread walkout over the issue.
 Thus this year's result is an im-
 portant victory for Balaguer and
 resolves one of his many problems.
 Non-Communist labor and po-
 litical groups,  including the im-
 portant left-of-center Dominican
 Revolutionary Party--whose sup-
 port is essential to any effec-
 tive strike--refused to back the
 Communist demands for a walkout.
 Some left-wing leaders admitted
 that the government's policy was
 economically sound while others
 were restrained from striking by
 fear of government retaliation
 and by a recognition that wide-
 spread unemployment makes re-
 placement of discharged strikers
 relatively easy.
 Contributing to the defeat
 of the strike attempt was the
 inability of the various Domini-
 can Communist groups to unite on
 a common strategy and tactics.
 There are now five Communist par-
 ties in the country and they are
 quarreling among themselves over
 personal and ideological differ-
 ences.   Communist efforts to
 provoke the security forces into
 heavy-handed repression of agi-
 tators favoring a strike resulted
 in only minor disturbances.

 ARGENTINE PRESIDENT REPLACES MILITARY CHIEF
 President Ongania's appoint-
 ment of a new army commander,
 General Alsogaray,  and a reshuf-
 fle of the army high command
 will help maintain military unity
 for the present.   The President
 has made it clear to the army
 that he does not intend to per-
 mit the high command to have an
 active role in formulating gov-
 ernment policy.   Alsogaray and
 the other senior generals ap-
 parently remain prepared to give
 Ongania strong support, if neces-
 sary, when the government imple-
 ments the reorganization of the
 national railroads.   Opposition
 to some government policies among
 the generals has not disappeared,
 however.
 General Pistarini, Alsogaray's
 predecessor, was in command of
 the army when the generals un-
 seated the constitutional regime
 of President Illia.   Since On-
 gania assumed the presidency,
 Pistarini had been the spokes-
 man for the military in criticiz-
 ing government policy as too
 dilatory, especially in the area
 of economic and labor reform.
 After a disagreement over the
 promotion and reassignment of
 the army's top generals, Pista-
 rini stepped down.   To replace
 him, Ongania chose the next sen-
 ior general not on foreign as-
 signment, Alsogaray, a step cal-
 culated to cause the least amount
 of resentment among the top of-
 ficers.
 Alsogaray,  an ambitious and
 outspoken officer, was also among
 those who were critical of the
 regime in its early days.   Re-
 cently, however, he said that he
 generally agreed with the Presi-
