What is the nature of that threat? Are we spending too

Those issues stand out vividly in light of President

Sr2ATI2NENT OF jEFOME COHEN, PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD 
UNIVERSITY 
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Hr. Chairman. I am very pleased 
to have this opportunity. 
I do haw.: a longer statement that / would like to submit 
for the record, but I will be relatively brief in my informal 
presentation. 
rentation addroz itself to the two principal 
questions that your Committee is seeking to investigate. Ono 
is, how do wo assess the threat of China. And the second is, 
how do we respond to that threat. 
I would say with respect to the first question that for 
over 20 years our assessment of China reflects misperceptions, 
myth and mistakes. Bviefly, one can tick off what what almost

coee,,titutes e litany of mistakes and misperceptions. At the 
verv outset, as a number of people have pointed out, the U.S. 
leaders sought to depict what was going on in the Chinese 
revolution and the Communist takeover in 1949 as a Soviet 
sate/lite installed in China. At one point Dean Rusk called 
China a "Slavic Manchekuo." 
Secondly, Wean North Korea irvaded South Korea in June, 
1950, the United Stats 
perceived this as being largely a 
Chineau-seoneored invesion and used this as the pretext for 
ieteevaning our fleet and eventually posting our military 
rces, between Taiwan which had been recognized by us at part 
of China until than, and Mainland China. -We didn't realize, 
anparently we didnt care, that this would be 
by woi,le, 
in Asia, but in China epecifially, as 
seen not only 
intervention 
and aggreesion against China's territorial integrity, even 
though that had ear-?r been our poSition. 
We eventually male an even more profound mistake, ot 
perhaps one of equal Dlagnitude, when We decided to seed troops 
eeeose the 38th parallel, China's border of N)rth gorea, 
and the Yalu River, despite the most repeated Chinese warnings 1 
that China would deem itself threatened in security if we sought 
established in 1949. We didn't apparently take into account thit 
to being down the North Korean regime. Again, what we under-
estimated was China's determination to defend the Chinese 
revolution, which was then only a year old, having been

the Chinese had rememl)ered western intervention against the 
Lik 'Revolution in 1918: that the Chinese had remembered 
3 I 
that Japan's invasion of China started with interference with 
Taiwan in 1395 and proceeded in 1910 to take over Korea, and 
thcu py...oealaed thence north into Manchuria. To the Chinese, asi 
P:-Dfssor Whiting's a',)le study of 1960 shows, the United Statee 
' .to be repeatinj the Japarese pattern of infringing on 
1 
C1iri security and territorial integrity. 
110.1, we eqded tae Korean War, and China adopted a policy 
3 of peaceful existence from 195d to mid-1957. And at that time 1

":MS to have peaceful co-euistence, not merely with the United 
Stz,It5 but with the w3r1d, by invoking the myth of aggressive 
Citinno After all, ths United Nations, which had been a party 
in the Korean conflic*z, had condemned China as the aggressor. 
To the Chinese, however, this looked rather Odd since china's 
t:060 ',?0 had not takeA part in North Korea's attack on South 
Korea and since they only entered the war, as X indicated 
tyii after the Un:Lted Ctatas advanced toward the Chinese 
border. 
Well, the period of peaceful co-existence didn't really 
wiL any great gains for Peking. And in 1959 she shifted to a 
more militant policy. And in parte as I think Professor 
Whiting's paper today will also support, that policy reflected 
a 
covert United State t sponsorship of many hostile acts toward

officiale of the Keneady and Johnson Administrations argue thati 
although in 1971 we have all recognized that China is no longer! 
expansionist in the conventional border-crossing sense, it was 
reasonable in 1965 to see China an being aggressive, and 
therefore it was reasonable to challenge China's co-called 
indirect aggression in Vietnam by sending American combat 
troops there. 
They saw, in other words, in 1965 the existence of an 
Asian Communist conspiracy -- as one once Said, its capital 
w4a. Poking, China -- but they say today, of course, it has 
dioappenred. 
This reminds ma in a curious way of the story About the

affairs of the world and was amazed by the time he reached 21 
at how much hi z parents had learned in three years. I think 
the orIginal image of China emu inaccueate; but it would be 
equally inaccurate, however, if WG were to see China as wholly ? 
benign today. But in neither case can we justify the indictmen11' 
tremendous expenditure of resources by the United States, not

3ut the question is, does that really justify us and not them i 
in covert departure from the rules? Even if, as it appears, 
the Chinese Communists regard international law as an instru-
ment of policy to be adopted and used when deisrable, but to he 
ignored when necessary, we should4.'t overlook the extent to 
which this attitude of their reflects their perception of how 
we and others play their game. 
I could go on at length, but I will simply tick off other 
instances in which they see us as having manipulated inter-
national law to our interests, 
I have mentioned our overnight change on the legal status 
of Taiwan. One can go back to the United States for peace

were wrong in 1950 in saying that there was no veto in the 
Security Council on the question of China's representation. 
I was glad, by the way, to see that Mr. Rogers appears to 
be retreating from that position and saying that at least the 
United States will assert a veto on China's representation in 
the Security Council.

in odditio?? to this manipulation of the rules, we 
baea to he continulo,g, as I have indicated, covert violations. 
My own college classmate, who has been in a Chinese prison 
for nlost 20 years, was engaged in CIA air operations against 
China, which we have denied. 
And we have used meteorological balloons over China as an 
excuse for getting reconnaissance information. 
And we have used foreign fishermen and other means of 
getting data inside Chinese territorial waters against their 
will. 
And the Chinese haven't ignored either how we play the gami 
in international law, not only in Vletnam but also in the Bay

regino in Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic in 1965 is a

tactical decision to facilitate and assure the President's

policy of dealing with the Chinese, one that is based upon 
respect, respect for China's territorial integrity, respect 
the other forms of international law, and respect for the

of China's capabilities and intentions, we will be making a 
substantial contribution to the relaxation of tensions in 
China, to our own security and to the conservation of our own

Senator Proxmire. Mr, Fairbank, 
STATEMENT OT PROFESSOR JOHN K. FAIRBANK, 
EAST ASIAN RESEARCH CENTER, HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
Mr. Pairbank. Mr. Chairman, I agree with praceically 
everything Mr. Cohen said. 
I would like to look back a little bit and begin with the 
point that President Nixon's visit to Peking is part of a 
general trend toward greater contact with China. And this kind! 
of contact cannot be handled by purely economic and 
military means. It will require academic cultural, educationeil 
and informational means on a much larger scale than heretofore. 
Since these latter means are a great deal cheaper than the 
ueual military and economic means, this trend can benefit the 
American taxpayer' 
Historiana look back at past cases to get a longer view 
of our experience. In Chinese historical studied we try to 
take account of the psychology of the Chinese people. In the 
new and as yet neglected field of American-East Asian relationt,, 
we study the values .0ad attit=det: of the peoples on both sides 
of the Pacific ad how they interact. 
The first point revealed by such studies is that the 
Chinese attitudes and values are very different from those of I 
the Americans. Their war aims and peace aims are both 
different. We have recently found that the Vietnamese 
peychology, values and attitudes'are different than we thought/

I suggest that just us men is a creature of hit, so 
nations are Creatures of history. One way to foresee their 
future conduct is to look at how they have behaved in the past. 
As we prepare to deal with China, what has been the Chinese 
record, first of all, as a military power? 
Histeriane have long since exploded the fiction that the 
Chinese have always been a very pacifist people. Actually, 
their history has as muds warfare in it as that Of most

Probably one reason the Chinese did not expand much beyond! 
their frontiers was their self-sufficiency. in contrast, the : 
European countrice on the small peninsulas of northwest Eurasia 
Iwere relatively poo:. For example, they lacked products like 
cotton and sugar, which they got from the Eastern Mediterranean

In the last SOO years the Chinese have been concerned 
primarily with their can affairs, as usual. Unfortunately for 
them, in the period of the Renaissance and industrial revolu-
tions the Mines? fell behind the western countries. They are! 
now trying to catch up, but they still have a long way to ger 
and they are trying to oateh up in a rather different way than 
we would eepect. They are not interested in a great foreign 
trade and have nhown no signs of wanting to develop a worldwid 
naval power. They claim they have plenty to do at home and 
observers of their recent progress all agree that there is a 
great deal to be done there. 
Let me illustrate China's non-expansiveness with referencl.

to Southeast Asia. By the first century A.D., the Chinese were, 
in touch with Southeast Asia and could zee there were trading 1 
possibilities in the area. It was quite easy to sail with the i 
monsoon winds from tha coast of China to the Straits of Malacca 
and back again with the seasons. The Chinese in South China anil 
in North Vietnam -- where the unified Chinese Empire had begun 
to rule in the second century B.C. -- had more than 1500 years 
of opportunity to expand their trade and political power into 
Southeast Asia, right down to 1500 A.D. 
Indian and Arab traders were at first more active in this 
region, but eventually Chinese also began to go to Malacca for 
trade. But the Chinese government never followed up with 
colonies or political control. In the 1300'a and 1400's, the 
Chinee gOvernMent at Peking tent fleets to the south on the

now in receet years the Americans have been active in that same, 
area, all comiag half way around the world from a great

distance. Chena has remained close at hand all this time, bothl 
in the 1500 years before the Europeans arrived and in the 400 
years after that. Yet China has not even tried to establish 
colonies in Southeact Asia. 
This does not indicate that the Chinese are incapable or 
1 
stupid, but rather that they have different aims and a different: 
govoramental tradition. Their military tradition is defensive 
and throughout most of their history has been concerned with 
In sr Asia, wheee the Russians now pose a menace to their 
feentiere. Predeceasors of the Russians were, first, the Huns 
ie tha period B.C. and then later, the various Mongol tribes, 
leading up to the Mongol conquest of China in the 13th century. 
This record of conquest of China from Inner Asia, which 
was repeated by the Manchus in the 17th century, has led to a 
Chinese strategic concentration on tho landward side of their 
realm. Their concern for Russia today carries on this traditio,

There was no menace from the ocean and no tradition of defense

All of this land-minded defensiveness has resulted in 
China having a very weak naval tradition. This was not a resul 
of technological backwardness. Far from. it. The Chieeee were

the early inventors of the watertight bulkhead, the use of 
transoms in naval architecture and also were the early inventort 
of the axial or stern-post rudder. They were the first to use 
the compass in navigation and developed a very efficient 
lateen-sail rig. Nevertheless, all this did not go on to produce 
a navy in the modern sense. The Chinese were simply not 
concerned about nava/ expension overseas, nor did any naval 
power menace them until recent times, when it was too late. it 
is significant that the Mongols who invaded China by land also , 
tried twice to invade Japan by sea in the late 13th century, 
but the Chinese never made the effort. Just as they have not 
colonized under government auspices, io they have not had 
striking forces going by sea against foreign powers. 
What about the new missionary zeal of their Maoist revolu-
tion today? They claim today, as they used to do centuries 
ago, that their systen is a model for other countries to 
follow. How much missionary zeal and subversive proselytism arm 
they going to put behind this idea? They have very little 
tradition of the adventurous young man who goes abroad to conquir 
the world and have a career in foreign parts. 
China has produced very few missionaries. The rather few I

that they are going into a production program of nuclear de-
vices in any way comparable to ourselves or the Soviets. Their

denande on their resources., The American public, if it has 
30 million handguns and other firearms for hunting and sport, 
may have as much firapoeer as the whole Chinese army today. 
Eow shall we deal with this very different society and its 
different ways? Surely the first thing to do is to find out 
more about China, not a u mattar of intelligence or statistics 
though these are useful, but as a matter of aims and attitudes, 
lite style and basic values. In recent weeks the so-called 
China experts in the United States have been deluged with 
requests for background information and evaluations.

not now lie in that sector. Very few Americans can read or

areas for 20 years. From 195D to 1953, hostilities between

justified our support for these activities. However, our 
Shadowy involvement with Mao's civil war enemy steadily grew 
after the Korean War and the Geneva Conference of 1954. The 
Pentagon Papers throw new light on the air operations in 
particular. 
According to a top secret memorandum from Brigadier 
General Edward Lansdale to General Maxwell Taylor, President 
Kennedy's chief military adviser* a Chinese kationalist 
airline* Civil Air Transport --CAT-- ostensibly "engaged in 
scheduled and non-scheduled air operations throughout the Par 
East" was actually "a CIA proprietary." CAT furnished "air 
logistical support under commercial cover to most CIA and other, 
U.S. Government agencies requirements. 
Down to 1961, according to General Landdale, CAT carried 
out "nore than 200 owlrrlighto oil mainland China andTibet." 
These were not reconnaissance but airdrops of supplies and 
pc,asibly men for guerrilla warfare. 
The 1959 Tibet revolt evoked specific accusations from 
Peking of outside support, openly conceded by the Chinese 
Nationalists on Taiwan. These claims and counterclaims, howeve 
now gain fresh credibility. Ultimately Tibet was to become so

eerious concenn in Peking by 1962, partly because of increased 
overflights, as to spark a war between China and India. 
To be cure, as border tension escalated, Indian air recon-
naissance missions undoubtedly expanded. However, the sensitiv-
ity of People's Daily in its heightened reactions to overflight 
of Tibet suggests zin added dimension of concern consequent from 
suspicion of American-Chinese Nationalist intentions which 
earlier triggered a Taiwan Strait alarm in June. Peking's 
fears linked an internal economic crisis with external threats 
advances on the Tibetan border and by new invasion indicators 
from Taiwan. The linkage between India's "forward policy" and 
the Taiwan invasion threat was not were propaganda or paranoia. 
It was rooted in tangible evidence of collusion between the 
U..-Ching clandestine operations and Tibetan guerrillas. 
Indian patrol advaaces in and of themselves posed more of a 
politica/ challenge than a military threat; however, as seen 
feon Peking in conoort with other hostile postures on China's 
borders, they necoseitated halting. kailing that, they met a 
firm rebuff. 
U.S. activitiee involving Chinese nationalist facilities 
or forces carry a latent threat to mainland security, whether 
or not they are immediately aimed at part of China, such as 
Tibet or the coastal provinces of Fukien and Chekiang. In this 
regard, Taiwan's utilization and participation in the IndochinaI

the next year it moved into South Vietnam. Its contribution

Only a complete investigation of all Chinese Nationalist 
4 activities in the area and clandestine U.S. support thereof can 
fully clarify Chinese Communist motivations and objectives in 
those portions of Burma, teas and Thailand adjoining the 
People's Republic. 
In sum, there is a credible case that overt and covert 
U.S.-Chinese nationalist activities have aroused Chinese 
Commenist security concerns resulting in heightened military 
deployments toward and across China's borders. This actiVity, 
in tern, haa been used to justify increased American and allied 
military investment throughout Asia to guard against the so-

the past 13 years of our military activities on Taiwan have 
brought a steady increase in the capability of that island to i 
threaten mainland china. 
1 liAsuming that our withdrawal from Vietnam removes the need 
for Ching Chuan Kang and aasociated personnel, the remaining 1 
1 American military presence also bears scrutiny. At least until 
recently, we had more than 660 Air Force officers and enlisted

this indivace military assistance has lain beyond Congressional 
control, despite its implications for our relations with both 
Peking and Taipei, not to mention mainlander Taiwanese 
reletione ou tho island itself. 
In this regazde assessment of our actual and perceived 
involvement with the Chinese rationalists has been seriously 
hampered by secrecy and censorship. 
Now, however, we must see the problem in all its ramifica-
tions. So long as we provide concrete evidence to Taipei and 
Peking alike that our military and intelligence interests are 
tied to Taiwan and the nationalists both Chinese regimes will 
draw negative conclusions concerning our expressed desire that 
they settle the Taiwan problem peacefully and between them-
selves. 
Moreover, in Peking those responsible for military con-
tingency planning will continue to allocate resources against 
a U.S.-Chiang threat of subversion, if not of invasion. 
In Taipei, demands will coetinue for increased military 
aid to match mainland developments. And in Washington, the 
military-intelligence complex will argue that helping our ally 
helps ourselves through continued involvement with and support 
to the Taiwan regime. 
Last, but not least, important groups in Japan will press 
for retaining Taiwan by any means, with or without Chiang,

This is a very enair situation for any people to be placed 
They are coefronted with the feet that the Chinese for some 
reason are extremely militant toward us. The Chinese seem to 
be threatening us and claiming we should not do this or that 
and not be aggrensive. And yet the American public lacks the 
evidence to Understand why they seam to be aggressive. And the 
inatitutional structure that we have is such that we are not 
seeposed to know that thea secret military things are being 
done. It is not possible to have your Secret operation known 1

Now, we can build up a Chinese threat very easily. And we can

Senator Proumite. You say we build up a Chinese threat. 
What I am getting at is, would you conclude that most of the 
$16 that wta seem to be spending in the Pat East, in 
addition to the $13 billion or so we are spending in Vietnam, 
moat of that $16 billion Is unnecessary, it i built on our

arm are most likely to be destroyed. And I simply ft hot 
believe that our armamcnt licy at present is a defense policy; 
it is rathar like putting our finger in the door and waiting 
for the door to close, or putting our necks on the block and 
waiting for tho knife to fall. Insofar as we have built up 
our military posture in the name of defense, we have collaboratbd 
with the mi/itary people of other countries to do the same. 1

effort. 
Now, this .s a vaey simplistic approach. But I have not 
seen anybody who has a better idea. Once you start talking 
about countering the threat of others, you are off in the game 
of the escalation 
Senator Proxmire. Dr. Fairbank, many undoubtedly share 
that view, but many do not. Supposing we do not share that. 
View, supposing we think we have to be prepared to meet any reat 
threat to the teeth, we have to be prepared to meet and over-
whelm any threat to this country. On the basis of your testi-
mony as an eXpert on Chine, and the teetiMony of Dr. Whiting, 
and Or, Cohan this morning, I would aesuMe that you would still 
argue that just from the standpoint of deployment of military 
forces on the ausuuption you have to have them to meet Any real 
threat cannot be justified in the Par East simply beoiaie China 
doesn't ropeeeent 4 threat, they don't haVe the economy to 
represent a threat, they don't have the force in being or the 
potential force to de it, they don't have the havy, they don't 
have the iniustry, they don't have the air force or the capa-
bility of building an air force, there just isn't anything 
there that can really threaten this country, possibly in 
Balthaa6t Asia, possibly in the Korean penineula, period. 
The faeter that persuades me on this e- and I would like 
to be disabused if / an wrong is that they are not even

a great deal lei? this investment is directed not at Peking

one that he would like to see explored. I think that i itself! 
a genuine concert to the Chinese, as it should be, that another 
war in the Korean penentula would be fxightfa to contemplate, 
that forces now in the area could escalate that far beyond the 
last war, and perhaps lead to the introductien of nuclear 
weapons. And yet wa have assumed that the only way to live with 
the Korean situation is to increase the defense capabilities 
of the south as the defense capabilities of the north increase,

1954 failure at Geneva. I think that it is futile to talk abou: 
simply increasing Japanese ezpenditures and our investment in 
the arsa to meet the C%inese threat. We should take up the 
earlier Chinese proposu for nuclear agreements in the area and 
nne 'chat /rind of convergent intoreat and shared costs might lie 
in the joint sharing pn:ograms of that type, instead of unilater

Mr. Cohen. I think, first of all, what Mr. Whting has

some .ort of settlement there, not merely the withdrawal of 
U.S. forces, it corra?zt. It also appears to coincide: With the 
wisaes of both Pyongy,14 and Seoul. 
In recent weeks both sides made a statement that they weal

we can to encourage that. Now, Choi./ En-lai pants us to withdra

withdraw troops from Thailand aad the Philippines as well as 
Taiwan, of ars. Mr. Rcuton seemed to indioetithat Chou - 
was asking to mech in asking us to withdraw the troops from 
the Philippines and Thailand. I don't frankly understand that I 
myseaf because it seems to me as the Thais have made clear, 
once the Vietnam oonflict is over our troops should not have 
any real role in Thailand; Thailand would be better equipped, 
'C think, without the preseace of American troops to handle its 
1 
own modern insurgency problems. 
I think the instability of government in the Philippines 
cone for not only a more vigorous Philippine governments more 
eeeponsive to tho neses of that Society, but ago the withdrawal,. 
of the stivelue that :American troops presence seems to 
provide the leftist elemente for anti-American posture that in

don't eee the problem in gradually withdrawing, in

the Philippiaas as well as these other places. 
think we have got to dietinguish very clearly Taiwan r 
these othee places. The Chinese claim Taiwan is Chinese 
territory. They do not Claim that the Philippines or Thailand 
or Japan and gorea are Chinese territory. And we have to 
distinguish Chinese aims and ambitions with respect to Taiwan 
compared to the other places. It doesn't Mean that the Chine ,e

suggests that they nre hoping Taiwan will be reunified with 
the mainland through 'Leans other than force. 
The Chinese are tlot naive. They realize they have a very 
grave problem on their northern border. It has just been 
accentuated by the Soviet treaty with India. They understand 
that action against Taiwan would leave them open on the northe 
border as well as elsewhere; and they would also be creating, 
kindling, you might say, the later Taiwanese independence 
nationalism, one might call it -- if they sought to use forte 
against Taiwan. 
So even with respect to TaiWan, which they distinguinh 
from these other areas, we don't see a great emphasis on the 
use of force. 
I would think we certainly could withdraw our troops from 
South Korea. But I would say that Japan should also be 
distinguished froal all these other areas. 
Th.7. Chinese would like us to sever our security treaty 
as well as withdraw troops from Japan. And they would really 
like to see us liquidate our entire operation in Asia. I den t 
think we can ignore what Chou himself conceded to be a contra-
diction in the Chinese policy. They want to see us Athdraw 
from Asia but they also don't want to see Japan rearmed and 
fill the gap that would be perceived to exist by the Withdrawal 
of American power.

Senator Proxmire. L t ma interrupt to say, again and again, 
being Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the 
Appropriations Committee, I have heard the Administration 
witnesses argue that the Nixon Doctrine means that we will 
withdraw our troops, we will replace our troops with foreign 
troops equipped and funded by this country. 
Mr. Cohen. Precisely. And that is what the Chinese 
fear specifically in the Japanese case, that we are going to 
try to have our cake ,Knd eat it too by withdrawing American. , 
troops, bnt increasing Japah's armed force as well as the armedl 
forces of other countries. And this worries them even more 1 
than the PL;sence of American forces. I would think we must 
not vreudce our relations with Japan, we must Make Japan 
continue to feel socue in Atia, and we must not encourage 
Japan to go nuclear anmament and I would think that the Chinese 
realistically, if they tee us not only withdraw from Vietnam 
but also from the Philippines and Thailand and South Korea, 
( 
iand other places, will understand that it is in their interest 
as cell as ours that VA not rock the boat in Japan, and that we 1

this -- maintain our security arrangement with the Japanese.

respect to South Mee a end other areas? 
Mr. Fair:eank. I see no point in increasing military 
assistance, unleea this is proved in the public discussions 
whioh are brought before you. We need figures; we need 
, comparative figures. And we need to know whether there is a 
a 1 buildup going on, or just a maintenance of a situation. But 
7 I in particular we nee C to have some assurance that we do not

then the mainland can perhaps tolerate it, and will have to 
tolerate it for a time. But we cannot expect the mainland 
people to accept an offensive Taiwan still on their front door. 
And I would argue thet it is possible to have a non-offensive 
Teiwan situation with our defense commitment if it doesn t 
leave these offeneive aspects to it. In other words, it is an

c dissuading the Soviet Union from increasing their military 
co:amitments was for us not to increase ours -to the extent

that wa increase ours they tend to match by corresponding

In this situaticn the Chinese leadership has to keep its 
eye on the domestic scene. And foreign relations is the 
framowork within which they try to carry on their revolution. 
The fact that they have the idea of themselves as a model for 
ether countries iJ an ancient Chinese tradition. They always 
felt they were a model for nearby countries; and they felt the: 
they were a model for Korea and Vletnam in the early days, and 
evzli Japan. And they continue in that rather superior train 
of thought, they are the center and model. 
This dace not mean that they have been able to develop the 
;1d  of overseas &subversion or foreign aid abroad comparable 
to the Russians or ourselves. They simply don't have the 
resoerces, and they haven't put that much into it. The prosPect 
f their doing so in the future is not very great. 
Mr. Whiting. Mr. Chairman, could I answer your question 
a bit? 
In terms of the Chinese nuclear story, I think the developJ 
ment of Chinese nuclear weapons is one of the most misperceived
i 
and misunderstoed stories of this country. We threatened the 
I Chinese with nuclear weapons in the Korean War in the spring of,

1953. Presideet Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles sent nuclear 
threats to Peking in February and May of that year, and forced 
their acceptance of our terms. In 1970 we deployed, aas 
indicated in my testimony, nuclear missiles that could fire 600 
miles into Chinese territory from Taiwan. It was not until 
Mao Tse-tag want to Noscow in Novembor of 1957 that he won 
from the Russians any kind of nuclear weapons assistance 
program. In 1958 we gave the Nationalists 8-inch howitzers 
on the island of Quemoy and indicated that they could have 
nuclear heads In them to wipe out the Chinese batteries on the 
mninland. The Ri res2onded to the Chinese demand and for 
years gave them important ingredients in what has subsequently 
become an independent nuclear capability. 
Weem we say, why would the Chinese go for nuclear weapons, 
uhlle it may be the ticket of equality that Professor Cohen 
hae eeforred to, but ie also has had an important atrategio 
response to our utraece c threat. Former Secretary of State 
rean Rusk said only a month ago: "/ cannot imagine a war with 
China that would net be nuclear.? If the U.S. Leadership 
LSSUMOS that nucloae weapons are an option against China, then 
surely China is going to have to develop some nuclear deterrent. 
capability at least against the bases in the Western Pacific 
which they can hold hostage against a first strike from us. It 
may be a crippled response, but it is the only response a self-
xesp cting governeent would take under the circumstances.

cannot peetenf. to know whether there is a military-
2. aoitplex in Peking that argues with civilian 
ecca 
o 
1' 
236 
;icanalysto as to how to allocate resources. Presumably 
there is a consensus. We have very little to spend, says any 
Chinese leadership, but the first need is for defense, I think 
the remarke of both Mao Tse-tung to dgar Snow and Chou En-lai 
to Jamea Reoton are honest assessment of the point I have 
their resoueces and the case for nuclear weapons that they 
would rather not have, but the necessity has been forced on thezil 
by oue ectivitioe and to the extent that Secretary 4aied looks 
to Jaean encourage the Japanese to spend more, and we provide

Senator Proxvire. I take it that the consensus of this 
panel is that the extent to which the Chinese commit their 
resources to defense or to military purposes or to aggression, 
potential aegreesion, is very much a function of what we do, 
to the extent that we seem to threaten them by our activities 
in Taiwan and the Vietnam War and elsewhere, they react by 
increasing their military commitments. And it is very hard for 
them to do it because they have an extremely limited economy 
with enormous demand for feeding their people and clothing thei 
people and housing their people, they have so many of them, and

aderatend. 
would like to aek, though, Dr. Cohen, if you would agree 
aith what aaoms to be the views of Mr. Fairbank and Mr. Whitingi 
3 I although paleampa X have paraphrased it too much, that the military 
j is many not a factor in the same way it is in this country. 
7 we hoar a lot abeut the military on mainland China. Apparently 
ir military establishment, however, occupies a somewhat 
1 
th 
different role in the society than does the military in this 
co try. Can you d scrit7e that role for us and can you say 
whethar China is in any sons a a militaristic nation, is she 
daminatod by military Values, do military requirements have the 
hit priority, is her aconcmy determined by military needs, 
that is, do the military get what they need first and then what 
is le2t in nada available to the economy? 
mt. Cohen. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to emphaa 
what I have said earlier and what others I think have said 
here this morningc that China:3e policy is very often reactive 
rather than active. We often think that they are taking the 
anitiatives and we are always responding. But actually the way 
they see it it is often the other way, but obviously there Jai al 
dynamic process at work here.

dum 
d net a bilateral world for the Chinese either, that they will 
4., 
obviously take into account and to acme extent respond to 
el! reductions in our own military expenditures, but they also have 
r j to take into account that they zee not confronted by about 
238 
800,000 fully armed for defensive purposes So.4et troops plus 
about 200,000 Mongolian troops on their border. And no matter 
what we do, they would have to maintain or obtain enough 
cepaeity to guaranteeaome modicum of security against that 
threat, apart from any American threat 
New, specifically with respect to your question, I would 
agree with the other eitnesses that it is very difficult to haw 
a ceaventional kind of separation between military in China 
and political in China. Piret of all, the Chinese are at a mudt 
less advanced degree of economic development than the United 
States and the Soviet Union and therefore fenetional speeiali-
zation and departmentalization have reached a lesser degree of 
attainment there. But they have ideologically committed to 
prevent that kind ol! departmentalization and specialization. 
Ti- whole debate they have had about whether to be a specialist 
has downgraded the role of specialistseincding people who are 
exclusively military specialists. As you know, their slogan 
has been, politics commands. Although all of these people come 
from a civil war background as military leaders, they are not 
exclusively military leaders; indeed they properly perceive

the failure of Chiang Kai-shek to govern China effectively and 
to prevai3. in the civil war was largely due to the fact that hel 
was exclusively a military leader. Chinese Communists have 
been truly aware that if you are going to run a society you 
e must deal with politics and they are aware that politics is thel

thing, and the militaey must be the tool of implementing what 
your military goale are internally and externally. And I think 
that is the predominant kind of focus that they have. 
Now, withospect to their goals, I think strength at home 
is slightly critical. Just at we have seen how we can be 
debilitated and wtakened by Out Vietnam Witethey have no 
illusiche that they must bring Up the standard of living of 
the masses of Chinese people. And I think the reporters who 
recently visited Chins from this country have Made this 'eery .

position, that for the overwhelming masses Of people they have 
done an incredibly good job in bringing up the level of the 
standard of laving. And that cannot be ignored oven in the 
world's most retaliatory internal syStem., 
New, as to their defense needs, I think there are prefeUnd 
disagreements within the Chinese elite. That has been Clear, 
it is becoming even clearer; and even the small group that hes 
been running China in rodent years seems to be fractured. We 
have just been reading now about Chen Po-ta, who is apparently I

Senator Pre=ird. 
You have referred to a no first use 
pledge, and Dr. Whiting has rcderred, I think, to nuclear

We worked out very careeully our agraement With the 
Soviet Union on the teat ban. And that if CCUITIO is subject 
to inspection, and to determination on a unilateral basis. 
Wa don't have to wurry about anything like that. But a no first 
u-Je pledge, what would it really mean? How can it be enforced 
Mr. Cohen. It All be pledged by each of the nuclear 
powers that it will never be the force to usa nuclear weapons

Senator Proxmire., Mr. Whiting, duvelppments in China are 
also having a severe impact in the Soviet Union 
.0011. 
Mr. Whiting, Could Z answer the question your raised. 
0eAatel- 2rermire. Yes. I am sorry. 
Mr. Mixing. You asked about trade with China and 
thc, prspects and implications of the President's trip to 
PeXtng. Covad I address that quostion briefly. 
I think thot beyond trade one must look at the developmen: 
prospects of ne main:i.and. They have taken same unusual 
:Aeps with differtmt countries in the past. They haVe reCentl. 
informed the Canadians that they will permit, indeed they will 
invite, C%;v1rIclirn entrepreneurs to come to China to install pl .t 
and factory equipment, constraints which they have never lifte 
for previous relationships. They have engaged in a long 
negotiation Ath the vest Europe power consortiuM known at 
CZNAG for a multi-billion dollar petrochemilial oomPle* in 
ncrthwest China in the mid-60s. I see now reason why we 
should concentrate so'...ely on China's capability in trade 
for relatinc the economic emergence of interests between our 
country and China. Indeed, turnkey projects, ae they tlre kn 
are most likly co be vented by Om Peoples Republic. This

of coveee wi . eequiea uertaie credit facilities, and indeed 
Expozt-Imczt Eank approval. We wondered why the Chinese 
seepect our de3ign on Taiwan. Yet at the same time that the 
President is plemning to go to Peking, export-import bank 
has (*proved a $93.5 million loan, approved by the Atomic 
Enerey Commission, for the Republic of China to have a nuclear 
powsr plant. Now, perhaps Peking thinks we aro going to trans 
for that $93.5 million to Peking when it takes over Taiwan, 
but I think that is rather fatuous. I think we foresee 
retaining Saiwan for a long time tn -ome. In a sense 
this is the left hand not knowing what the tight hand doeth. 
If we are tarling about truck enOilitkis in the SoViet 
Union while We know that the Soviet teniot poises a threat to 
seeue!ty of China, and indeed is massing troops on China' 
boraers, then should we not think aboet the Export-Xmport 
Bank's faeiiieaeint e truck construction plant in the 
Chinese ?copeee Repal,lia as e defense need against the 
Soviet Union? 
We have another possibility in the ecoaomic realms The 
Chinese have discovered oil reserves that are beyond 
theit foreseeable neede for the balance of the century, laivekh 
the etate of their eednomy. Japanue need for Oils is tole Well

the peak risk was in 1969, aad that it has diminished but not

It is because of this Soviet threat that I would disagree 
with Professor Cohen's suggested development on Chinese 
ceaventional force level. I think Chinese conventional force 
levels are mueh more a function of tha Soviet border threat, 
the subversive threat that the Soviets have manifested in Sink 
lanee in Moagolia, than they are a function of the external 
relatione of the US. And if I were hopefUl I would say that

of their sensed belief that a successor governmeht will have

4,rd I might say that part of the significance of the 
Indian treaty with the Soviet Union that has just been concludid 
may be that it will offer the Soviets a pretext for acting

too vigorously in any Pakistan-Indian clash, I think us might 
find 
the Soviet Unicn chcmping at the hit to txerCise Some 
influence over the Chinese by threatening to come to India's

to look a little like that in 1914 of Serbia and Austria-Hunga

blem you solved it vith a pact. 
Ve formed SEATO and CENTO. We used Pakistan as a massivel 
intelligeeca effort directed against China and the Soviet 
Union from the faciIitiee at Pedhawar. China had had from as 
17 1 eaely ae 1954 to 19S5 to respond directly and conventionally 
at a time when they were not in hostile array against India to 
sae how that alliance could be eroded. Chou En-lai made appro 
10 I es to Taiwan at the conference in 1955. The approachee to 
eakisten were a little more oucceesful, becanse of Kashmir

without reftronce to legal obligations should be examined, 
as I knew it has been examined, by various pieces of legislati 
introducod in ths Congress. And the preosdebta go beyond
