 Chinese Progress in the Production of Integrated Circuits
 Summary
 One of Beijing's primary technology tasks is to
 develop a modern microelectronics industry that will
 enable China to produce for export as well  as to
 meet its domestic requirements for electronic
 devices.   Because many Chinese integrated circuits
 are unreliable and inefficient, Beijing now imports
 most electronic devices needed for key computers and
 military projects.
 China's present ability to produce integrated
 circuits lags behind the West by about 10 years.
 Devices are larger than their Western counterparts,
 require more power,  and operate more slowly.
 Production problems include inadequate coordination
 between research and production units,  limited
 availability of key pieces of quality-control and
 test equipment,  and shortages of qualified midlevel
 engineers and managers.
 To remedy these deficiencies, China has begun a
 comprehensive reform of its R&D sector and an
 ambitious import program involving both complete
 production lines and key pieces of equipment.   We
 expect these efforts to yield some significant

 results over the next few years.   For Western firms
 attempting to sell to China's electronics sector,
 China's expansion plans have opened up significant
 sales opportunities.
 Introduction
 China's highest technological priority is to establish a
 modern semiconductor industry capable of supporting an expanded
 computer development and manufacturing program.   By 1990 the.
 Chinese hope to develop a capability in advanced microelectronics
 equal to the United States'  capability in the early 1980s.
 China's objectives are twofold:
 -- To increase the sophistication of the devices
 produced domestically for-use in advanced computers
 and  in military systems.
 -- To boost the supply of medium-level electronic
 components available for use in dual-use computers
 and in consumer goods.
 In the longer term, Beijing intends to become a major
 exporter of integrated circuits and a strong competitor in the
 international marketplace for sophisticated electronic
 components.   To accomplish these objectives, China has shifted
 its electronics modernization strategy from one emphasizing self-
 reliance to one of importing advanced technology and equipment
 from the West and Japan to speed the pace of development and to
 cut R&D costs.
 Growth of the Industry
 China's integrated circuit industry had its beginning in
 early 1956, when the leadership formed a national committee to
 develop plans for the rapid development of semiconductor
 devices.   During the late 1950s, China produced prototype
 semiconductor diodes and transistors.   In the early 1960s,  it
 began to develop a production capability for discrete
 semiconductor components, and by 1965 at least 34 factories and
 research institutes were making semiconductor materials and
 fabricating semiconductor devices.
 Despite dislocations caused by the Cultural Revolution, the
 electronics sector continued to grow between 1966 and 1976,
 chiefly because of its importance to strategic weapons
 development.   As part of a nationwide policy of dispersing
 defense-related production to shield industry from enemy attack,
 China during this period constructed additional  semiconductor
 research and production facilities in remote areas of China.   As
 a result of this effort, four major electronic research and
 production centers were established in China's interior .(Gansu,
 Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces),  in addition to the
 electronic production centers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and

 several coastal  provinces.   These interior production plants are
 relatively sophisticated and continue to produce primarily for
 military customers.   By mid-1971, the number of Chinese plants
 known to be engaged in series, batch, or experimental production
 of semiconductor components had grown to 82--more than double the
 number identified in 1965.
 In the late 1970s, China began a new push to acquire Western
 technology for the production of semiconductors and other
 sophisticated electronic goods.   One major new production line
 for integrated circuits was planned during this period, a
 facility at the Jiangnan Radio Equipment and Materials Plant in
 Wuxi, Jiangsu Province.   Production at the new plant has been
 held up by difficulties in obtaining US export licenses for
 needed new equipment, the need to refurbish some of the used
 equipment, and legal problems involving the US trade agent.   When
 completed the Wuxi plant will for a time be China's largest
 integrated circuit factory, with a capacity of over 26 million
 linear integrated circuits per year.
 With the backing of the Leading Group for the Invigoration
 of the Electronics Industry, formed in 1982 and renamed and
 reconstituted in 1984, other facilities of similar size are also
 planned for Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, Shaoxing, Changsha and
 several other cities.   Combined output for these major projects
 could reach several hundred million integrated circuits per
 year.
 Current Capabilities...
 China's semiconductor industry today reportedly consists of
 more than 500 facilities, 200 of which are involved in some
 aspect of integrated circuit development and manufacture.   The
 Chinese claim that the Ministry of Electronics Industry alone
 controls at least 140 factories, which produce an estimated 40
 million integrated circuits a year.   In addition, there are
 electronics research and manufacturing enterprises operated by
 the Ministry of Astronautics Industry, the Ministry of Posts and
 Telecommunications, the Ministry of Machine Building Industry,
 the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Public Security,
 and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
 At present, China manufactures nearly 1,000 types of
 integrated circuits.   Most are small-scale-integration (SSI) or
 medium-scale-integration (MSI) devices.   More sophisticated
 devices,  such as 16K random-access-memory (RAM) units, and 16K
 eraseable-programmable-read-only-memory (EPROM) circuits, and 8-
 and 16-bit microprocessors are also being manufactured, but in
 limited quantities and with low production yields.
 China's ability to produce integrated circuits in commercial
 quantities continues to lag behind the US and Japan by five to 10
 years.

 China's domestic requirements for microprocessors and advanced
 logic and memory devices are still being met primarily by imports
 from Japan and the US.
 China's production capabilities in seven major categories of
 integrated circuits are described below:
 TTL Circuits.   Transistor-transistor-logic circuits
 constitute about 50 percent of China's total  integrated circuit
 production.   China produces five series of TTL circuits,  all
 based on the'Texas Instruments SN74/54 series.   Some are produced
 to military specifications,  able to function in temperatures
 ranging from -55 to +125? C.   The Chinese claim that all TTL
 logic circuits being produced are directly interchangeable with
 their US-produced counterparts.   China is particularly proud of
 its low-power Schottky (LSTTL) devices,  100 varieties of which
 are produced--most to military standards--by an integrated
 circuit plant in China's interior.   This plant, the Tianguang
 Electrical  Industry Factory, reportedly supplied some of the
 circuitry used in China's Galaxy supercomputer.   The Tianguang
 plant of Gansu Province is benefitting from the modernization of
 its sister plant, the Tianguang factory of Shaoxing, Zheji-ang
 Province.
 ECL Circuits.   China's emitter-coupled-logic circuits are
 modeled on the Motorola MC10100 and MC10500 series.   These ultra
 high speed circuits,  again produced to military specifications,
 are also made by Tianguang.   In addition, China claims to use
 these circuits in missile guidance systems, satellite
 communications equipment,  and microwave measurement devices.
 General Purpose MOS Logic Circuits.   Because of the
 relatively slow speed and high power consumption of PMOS
 (positive-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor) devices, China is
 gradually replacing them with CMOS (complementary MOS)
 technology.   NMOS (negative-channel MOS) technology continues to
 be used extensively in Chinese microprocessors and memory
 devices.   Mastering the complex CMOS manufacturing process has

 been more difficult, but China reportedly produces more than 70
 varieties of CMOS circuits,  including microprocessors,
 operational amplifiers,  voltage comparators,  and digital/analog
 converters.   In 1982, China's domestic sales of CMOS circuits
 exceeded 3 million units.
 Dedicated Circuits.   Chinese versions of these circuits--
 used in televisions, radios, watches,  and other consumer goods--
 are mainly based on Japanese devices made by Sanyo, Toshiba,
 Hitachi, Matsushita, NEC,   and others. In recent years, China has
 purchased equipment for a large number of production lines
 designed to produce devices for consumer electronics.   Many
 contain refurbished equipment purchased from Japanese or US IC
 producers,  rather than state-of-the-art production technology.
 Some of the production lines,  such as the one at the Jiangnan
 Radio Equipment and Materials Corporation, may be capable of
 producing more advanced general  purpose integrated circuits than
 required for color televisions--such as 8-bit microprocessors and
 16K memory devices.
 Microprocessors.   China produces 1-bit CMOS and 4-, 8- and
 16-bit NMOS microprocessors.   China's 8-bit microprocessors are
 modeled on Intel's 8080 and Motorola's 6800 series.   China claims
 to be producing single-chip 8-bit processors in at least four
 different factories, although the chip is most likely
 significantly larger than its Western counterpart.
 In early 1984, China claimed to have begun small-batch
 production of 16-bit microprocessors at an interior factory
 subordinate to the Ministry of Astronautics Industry, the Lishan
 Microelectronics Corporation of Shaanxi Province.   The 16-bit
 processor can be used in real-time control  systems in demanding
 environments;  it is designed to operate for long hours in a wide
 range of temperatures and is resistant to moisture and
 Memory Devices.  In 1982, China announced that the
 Semiconductor Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences in Beijing had developed a 16K DRAM (dynamic-random-
 access-memory) chip.                        At the same time, Beijing made public its
 ability to produce 4K SRAMs (static-random-access-memory devices

 A number of institutes are now working to develop very-
 large-scale-integrated circuit (VLSI) technology.   In 1983 and
 1984,  several Chinese facilities attempted to obtain equipment
 and information suitable for the production of 256K DRAM
 Even if China gains access to Western 256K DRAM
 production technology, the Chinese will  probably not produce a
 prototype 256K DRAM before the end of this decade.   Production
 capability will require several- additional years.
 ...and Limitations
 In laboratory settings,  lack of equipment, rather than
 expertise,  is largely responsible for China's delay in producing
 advanced prototypes.   Even with imported high-purity chemicals
 and materials, the absence of computer-aided-design (CAD) systems
 and state-of-the-art processing equipment prevents the Chinese
 from producing VLSIs on the order of a 256K DRAM.
 China's development of prototype 64K and 256K DRAM devices
 almost certainly requires the acquisition of equipment that will
 enable the Chinese to pack circuits more densely by using
 narrower design rules.  The equipment generally available in
 Chinese factories permits the Chinese to produce-devices with
 line widths of 5 to 10 microns,  and the Chinese claim to have
 achieved a 2-micron capability in one institute.   In contrast,
 Western producers routinely use 2-micron-geometries and have made
 substantial  progress toward developing a sub-micron capability.
 Unable to pack circuitry as densely as Western producers, the
 Chinese have been forced to increase the dimensions of their
 integrated circuits.   Larger chips require larger areas of high-
 purity silicon wafers to be defect-free.   Because Chinese silicon
 is far from pure enough to satisfy this requirement--even Western
 silicon producers have tremendous difficulty producing silicon of

 sufficient purity--China will eventually have to. turn its effort
 toward obtaining equipment that will enable Chinese factories to
 shrink the size of their circuitry.
 Another limitation of China's semiconductor industry is the
 long lead-time required before a developed prototype device moves
 into factory production.   The gap between prototype and
 commercial  production of memory devices, for example, ranges from
 two to four years and appears to have increased over the last
 decade,  as the sophistication of the devices has risen.   In the
 West, a one or two year gap between prototype development and
 commercial  production--slightly longer for 256K DRAM devices--is
 the norm.

 Removing the Obstacles
 China is taking steps to improve its ability to develop
 advanced devices on a laboratory scale as well  as to improve
 production capabilities at its electronics factories.   To remove
 the institutional barriers to advanced electronics production,
 Beijing is now embarked on a major reform of its entire
 scientific and technological system. Its aim is to bridge the gap
 between research findings and commercial  production and to
 improve the flow of technology between factories.  To foster the
 internal transfer of technology, the Chinese leadership is
 encouraging the mobility of technical personnel,  creating
 financial  incentives for institutes to work closely with
 factories on the development of new products and production
 techniques,  placing a large number of institutes formerly
 controlled by the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the direct
 control of industrial ministries,  and forming regional
 corporations, composed of factories and institutes engaged in
 semiconductor research and production, in major cities.
 To improve material  conditions in laboratories and
 factories, Beijing has embarked on an ambitious program of
 equipment imports, factory renovation,  and investment in key
 electronics production projects.   Because China's goals involve
 both rapid expansion in the quantity of electronic devices
 produced for civilian applications and rapid advances in the
 sophistication of the circuitry produced for military uses,
 Beijing is using a variety of means to obtain foreign technology
 and equipment for this sector:
 -- Cooperative production involving firms from the
 United States, Japan,  and Western Europe.   Although
 most of the emphasis on cooperative production in the

 electronics sector is centered on joint venture
 investment, the Chinese are also promoting
 compensation trade and kit assembly arrangements.
 -- Purchases of turnkey plants and design technology for
 the-production of advanced electronic devices.
 Although contracts for complete production lines have
 declined overall  since 1978, the Chinese now appear
 more willing to purchase complete sets of equipment
 in the area of microelectronics.
 -- Purchases of selected pieces of production and test
 equipment to modernize existing plants,  improve
 production yields,  and produce more sophisticated
 devices, such as large-scale and very-large-scale-
 integrated circuits.
 -- Purchases of used pieces of equipment as well  as
 refurbished complete production lines.
 Although it is difficult to generalize about the method
 Chinese factories most often select, key projects--frequently
 related to the production of components to be used in military
 systems--often involve new,  rather than refurbished, equipment.
 Military-related projects are unlikely to involve any form of
 cooperative production that would require the presence of foreign
 managers or advisers.   Joint venture projects,  imports of used
 equipment,  and purchases of complete production lines are the
 methods often chosen to boost the production of components to be
 used in consumer goods or general-purpose computers.
 Among the individual  pieces of wafer fabrication equipment
 China most actively seeks to import are:
 -- Microprocessor-controlled Czochralski furnaces for
 growing low-defect single-crystal  silicon ingots.
 -- Molecular-beam epitaxial reactors for growth of a
 layer of pure silicon (or gallium arsenide) on wafer
 surfaces.
 -- Computer-aided design software,  pattern generators
 and compilers,  and graphics systems for developing
 mask designs.
 -- Electron beam lithographic equipment for producing
 masks.
 -- Projection mask alignment systems for use in
 photolithography.
 -- X-ray lithographic equipment.
 -- Ion implanters.

 The Management of China's Electronics Industry
 This paper provides background on the organizations involved
 in the planning, management,  and foreign trade of China's
 electronics sector.
 Leading Group for the Invigoration of the Electronics Industry
 In September  1984,  Beijing reorganized and renamed the
 Leading Group for Computers and Large-Scale Integrated Circuits,
 which had been charged since 1983 with overseeing the development
 of these products.   At the same time, Vice Premier Li Peng
 replaced Vice Premier Wan Li as the chairman of the Leading
 Group.   In addition, the membership of the Leading Group was
 broadened.   Ranking official's from the State Economic Commission,
 the State Science and.Technology Commission, the National
 Defense, Science Technology and Industry Commission, the People's
 Bank of China,  and the Ministries of Electronics, Machine
 Building, Post-and Telecommunications, Railroads,  and Water
 Resources and Electric Power all  serve on the new leading
 group.   (See Figure 1)
 The Leading Group for the Invigoration of the Electronics
 Industry is charged with strengthening. centralized leadership
 over electronics and information enterprises.   Its functions
 include:. formulating development goals and general  strategies;
 approving key plans'and supervising their implementation;
 coordinating research and production,  and examining and approving
 the imports planned for major projects.
 The new Leading Group has defined the strategic goal.of the
 electronics industry as developing "microelectronics technology
 as the foundation,  and computer and telecommunications equipment
 This unclassified memorandum was prepared by
 of the Office of East Asian Analysis in response to a           25X1
 request from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade
 Development, Department of Commerce.   Questions  and comments are
 welcome and may be addressed to Chief, China Division,

 as the main body."   The Chinese press reports this goal  has been
 adopted by the State Council  and will be emphasized in China's
 Seventh Five Year Plan  (1986-1990),  soon to be announced.
 The Ministry of Electronics Industry
 MEI, formerly the Fourth Ministry of Machine Building,
 coordinates one of China's most rapidly developing industrial
 sectors.   The Ministry directs applied electronics research and
 manages the development and production of electronics products
 for both civilian and military needs.
 MEI controls some 2,400 enterprises employing more than
 90,000 engineers and technicians and one million additional  non-
 technical                        personnel.   Although MEI manages some of these
 enterprises directly,   control of most of them has been delegated
 to provincial,  municipal,  and county organizations, which receive
 planning guidance from the Ministry.   In addition to MEI and to
 provincial and municipal  authorities, the Ministries of Posts and
 Telecommunications, Astronautics, Machine Building, Light
 Industry,  and the Chinese Academy of Sciences all produce
 electronic goods for their own uses.
 Industrial  bureaus subordinate to the MEI  include:
 -- Bureau of Radar Industry - responsible for manufacturing
 various ground, weather,  and airborne and shipboard
 radars.
 -- Bureau, of. Communications, Broadcast and Television -
 responsible:"for communication, navigation and broadcasting
 equipment, television sets, radios, and tape recorders.
 -- Bureau of Computer Industry - responsible for
 manufacturing computers, peripherals and related
 equipment; controls research, production,  imports,  and
 product distribution for a number of institutes  and
 factories;   provides staff support for and policy
 recommendations to MEI and the Leading Group; controls
 China Software Technology Corporation (CSTC) and China
 Computer Technical Service Corporation (CCTSC)--companies
 that form joint ventures with foreign firms for software
 development and for computer maintenance and service.
 -- Bureau of Electronic Components and Devices - responsible
 for manufacturing vacuum tubes,  semiconductor devices,
 integrated circuits, electronic instruments,  special
 processing equipment,  and electronic materials.
 Electronics research controlled by the Ministry comes under
 the direction of four research academies.   Institutes conduct
 research for the academies.     At least 55 such  institutes are
 subordinate to the MEI.

 The MEI also controls several  specialized  import-export
 corporations to acquire equipment and technology from foreign
 sources.   These include the China Electronics Import-Export
 Corporation (CEIEC) and the China National Electronic Devices
 Corporation (CNEDC).   CEIEC has branches  in Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
 Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing,  and most provinces.   (See Figure 2)
 Inter-Ministerial Regional Corporations
 Regional electronics corporations,  composed of factories and
 institutes engaged in the production of similar goods,  have been
 or are being formed in major cities.    These regional  combines are
 being formed to reduce the duplication of research being done by
 various institutes, to coordinate factories'  imports of equipment
 and materials, to facilitate the sharing of technical  information
 between institutes  and factories,  and to ensure that components,
 computers,  and telecommunications equipment are compatible with
 one another.   Examples include:
 -- The Nanjing Radio Company,  an integrated complex composed
 of 37 factories,  and provincial  and municipal
 authorities.
 -- The Shanghai, Software Technological Development Center,
 which comprises six universities, two institutes,  and
 various municipal entities.
 -- The Shanghai Computer Company, which includes two computer,
 factories, a telecommunications factory,  an instrument
 factory, a research institute and municipal organizations.
 The Shenyang'Computer United Corporation, which includes,
 11 production and research units.
 Formation of such regional corporations is only one of the
 means Beijing is using to remove the institutional barriers to.
 progress in the production of electronic goods.   Beijing is now
 embarked on a major reform of  its entire scientific and
 technological  system,  aimed at improving the flow of technology
 between institutes and factories, between military and civilian
 sectors,  and among factories spread across several ministries.
 To foster the internal  transfer of technology, the Chinese
 leadership is encouraging the mobility of technical  personnel,
 creating financial  incentives for institutes to work closely with
 factories on the development of new products and production
 techniques,  and placing a large number of institutes formerly
 controlled by the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the direct
 control of industrial ministries.   All  sectors are involved in
 this effort,  but the electronics industry is the focal  point for
 many of the reforms.

 The Buyers
 A large and. increasing number of corporations are involved
 in China's imports of semiconductor production technology and
 equipment.   At the national  level,  there are several  trading
 corporations under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  and
 Trade,  the Ministry of Electronics Industry,  and each of the
 defense industrial ministries.   Buying corporations are also
 operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National
 Defense, Science, Technology and Industry Commission,  and the
 State Science and Technology Commission.   (See Table 1.)
 In addition to the national level  trade corporations, the
 current decentralization of China's foreign trade has given rise
 to a number of regional or municipal-level trade organizations.
 The number of local  traders is multiplying rapidly,  and the value
 of the purchases many are authorized to make--as well  as their
 authority to sign cooperative production agreements--remains
 unclear.   The regional  corporations most actively involved in
 electronics procurement are located in Shanghai, Tianjin,  and the
 Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.
