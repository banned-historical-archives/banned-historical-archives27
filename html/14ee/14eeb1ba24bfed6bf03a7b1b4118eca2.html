 Chinese Diplomacy Since Afghanistan
 While concerned about the implications of events in South-
 west Asia for regional security,  China also sees the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan as an opportunity to counter detente
 politics in the West, prod the United States into a tougher
 anti-Soviet stance,  and drive a wedge between the Third World
 and the Soviet Union.   China is seeking to capitalize on this
 opportunity by lobbying for greater Western involvement in the
 security of the region,  offering its own assurances of support
 to Pakistan, encouraging rapprochement between New Delhi and
 Islamabad while attempting to repair its own ties with India,
 and calling on the international community to aid the Afghan
 In Southeast Asia, China remains as committed as ever to
 waging a protracted struggle against Vietnam despite recent
 indications that ASEAN support for its policy on Kampuchea is
 eroding.   In Northeast Asia,  China continues to stress its
 interest in maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula
 and its support for an increased Japanese defense effort.  F         25X1
 As a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and
 the strong US reaction,  China has reduced further its meager
 relations with the USSR.   The Chinese have signaled their
 satisfaction with Sino-US ties and insist that they see the
 relationship as "a major strategic decision" and not as a
 "tactical move" born of expediency.
 This memorandum was prepared under the auspices of the National
 Intelligence officer for China - East Asia - Pacific by the

 Beijing believes recent American actions in Iran have
 diverted world attention from the more important situation
 in Afghanistan, which the Chinese see as having global impli-
 cations.   Beijing sees Moscow's action not as a defensive move
 SECRET
 Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of
 last year, Chinese attention has focused on the situation in
 Southwest Asia.   Sino-Soviet relations and Sino-Vietnamese
 relations--traditional areas of high concern--have been rela-
 tively static, although Beijing has been active in non-Communist
 Southeast Asia, whose anti-Vietnamese resolve it fears may be
 eroding.   In recent months, China has continued to stress repeat-
 edly
 its interest in peace and stability in Northeast Asia.   The
 visit of British Defense Minister Pym in March underscored both
 China's growing security relationship with the West and its
 reluctance to move ahead with major arms purchases.                  25X1
 China views the recent events in Southwest Asia as both
 a threat and an opportunity.   While concerned about what these
 events bode for itself and its friends, China has seized upon
 the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as an opportunity to counter
 detente politics in the West, prod the US into a tougher anti-
 Soviet stance,  and drive a wedge between the Third World and
 thviet Union--three key Chinese foreign policy objectives.
 China's goal ultimately is to create an anti-Soviet front
 in Southwest Asia that is supported by the West and open to
 Chinese influence.   The Chinese are prepared to pursue this
 Z,   objective over the long term and to resist tendencies in the
 international community to reach an accommodation with the
 Soviets.
 Given the importance they attach to the situation in
 Afghanistan, the Chinese are concerned that the United States
 is too preoccupied with Iran.  While sympathizing with the US
 position, Beijing believes Washington must subordinate feelings
 about the hostages to larger geopolitical concerns.   Beijing
 argues that measures that would destabilize Iran further--such
 as economic sanctions or military action--only play into the
 hands of the Soviet Union,  the force in the region the United
 States should be most concerned about.

 designed to ensure a friendly regime on its border, but as part
 of a long-range drive to gain a warm-water port on the Indian
 Ocean.   China concludes that after "digesting" Afghanistan,
 Moscow will pursue this end by supporting separatist movements
 in the region, such as that of the Baluchis, exploiting the
 chaos in Iran to bring a pro-Soviet party to power, or even
 L       threatening-military intervention in Pakistan and Iran.   Ulti-
 mately Moscow seeks to establish a stranglehold on the Persian
 Gulf, control access to the Indian Ocean via the Straits of
 Malacca, and thereby threaten access by the West and Japan to
 Middle East oil.   If Moscow succeeds, Beijing argues, the West
 can only acquiesce in Soviet world hegemony or precipitate a
 world war that Moscow is better prepared to wage.                     25X1
 China is particularly concerned that events in Afghanistan
 will influence events in Southeast Asia, where it has a direct
 security stake.   It fears that acquiescence in Soviet actions
 in Afghanistan will lead to acquiescence in the Vietnamese con-
 quest of Kampuchea.   China's public                  statements have                      25X1
 stressed that the two situations are twin aspects of a single
 Soviet threat and must be met with equal determination.               25X1
 Beijing believes that the outcome in Afghanistan will set
 the tone in world politics for years to come and the Soviet
 intervention poses a fundamental test.   It sees the application
 of the Brezhnev doctrine outside the Soviet bloc as a signal of
 a more adventurist and bellicose Soviet foreign policy.   Beijing
 Z   is concerned that fears of increased tension,  domestic political
 investment in detente, and a distaste for sanctions against
 Moscow will lead Western nations to seek an accommodation on
 Afghanistan that will only encourage Moscow to act coercively
 elsewhere.
 Regional Strategy
 Beijing's efforts to exploit and check Soviet expansion
 in Southwest Asia long predate the Soviet invasion.   While it
 has been pursuing the key elements of its current strategy with
 consistency since 1978,  the Soviet invasion has caused Beijing
 to redouble its efforts.   The key elements are discussed below.
 Engage the West in the Region.   Increased Western involve-
 ment in the region's security, particularly on the part of the
 United States,  is at the heart of China's present strategy.
 20        Beijing has been particularly eager that Washington provide
 4         Islamabad with a security commitment as well as economic and
 military assistance.   The Chinese applauded when the United

 The Chinese have lobbied in the West extensively on
 Pakistan's behalf, but Beijing's own commitment to Islamabad
 falls short of Pakistani desires;
 Encourage Regional Harmony.   A newly stressed element in
 China's regional policy has been to seek to improve its own
 bilateral relations with India and Iran and to minimize regional
 conflicts that complicate increased cooperation against the
 Soviet Union.   Beijing has publicly signaled its interest in
 better relations with New Delhi,  such as in its treatment of
 India's National Day and its unexpectedly warm congratulations
 to Indira Gandhi,  an old adversary,  on her reelection.   Foreign
 Minister Huang Hua pressed China's interest in improved ties
 during his brief meeting with her in Salisbury in April.     China
 has also taken special care in its dealings with Pakistan to
 avoid irritating India needlessly;   for instance,  China has been
 silent on the Kashmir issue.   Through public comments and pri-
 vate contacts, Beijing is also laboring to refurbish its rela-
 tions with Tehran and after many months of effort managed to
 restore its ambassadorial presence there.

 Soviet withdrawal without conditions,  self-determination for
 the Afghan people,  and active Western support to the rebel
 forces in the meantime.
 Policy Constraints
 Despite the intensity of Beijing's effort, there are
 fundamental constraints on China's ability to forge a firm
 anti-Soviet front in Southwest Asia and to engage the West
 in its support:
 -- To the degree China strengthens Pakistan, it runs
 the risk of impairing efforts to improve relations
 with India.
 Deference to New Delhi's sensitivities generates
 suspicions in Islamabad.
 China's support for a stronger US role in
 region is opposed by both India and Iran.
 China has little in the way of aid it can offer
 as a positive inducement, while any display of
 China's military strength is counterproductive.
 China may also find that the key actors in its policy are
 unwilling or unable to play their assigned role.
 Pakistan.   Islamabad is an increasingly weak link in
 Chinese policy.   The Pakistani domestic political scene is
 currently quiet, but there is widespread discontent with
 President Zia's rule, even among his military backers.   The
 ZO      country is poor and militarily weak and its leaders are pon-
 dering how to deal with the pressures from the West, Moscow,
 and the nonaligned and Islamic world.   Rather than readily
 accepting the vigorous anti-Soviet role Beijing has hoped it
 would play, Pakistan is attempting to strike the best deal it
 can for itself.   China's ability to strengthen its longtime
 friend and shape its foreign policy will continue to be
 limited.
 Iran.   The prospect that Iran will be able to play the
 strong anti-Soviet role Beijing would like is even less clear.
 The possibility that China will establish influence in Tehran
 .          in the near future is also remote.   Beijing has little to offer
 Iran in the way of inducements,  and anti-Communist Islamic
 fundamentalism will limit Chinese influence under the best of

 circumstances.   China is using the few assets it can muster to
 win influence in Tehran; it has maintained trade,  sent a
 Chinese Muslim delegation, and generally tilted toward Iran in
 its recent media coverage of events there.   Tehran, however,
 still resents Beijing's support for the Shah,  and has not yet
 relations.
 India.   The prospects for significant improvement in Sino-
 Indian relations are fair in the long run, but the chances of
 rapid improvement in the near term are not great.   There remain
 a number of bilateral issues that divide the countries--including
 a difficult border dispute--and a strong heritage of bitterness
 in India stemming from the 1962 border war and subsequent mani-
 festations of Chinese hostility.   Beijing has been willing to
 negotiate all issues.   It now believes it is up to India to
 reciprocate China's overtures of good will and invite Foreign
 Minister Huang Hua to New Delhi. While the atmospherics are
 better and while India has expressed interest in improving ties,
 New Delhi has put off a Huang visit at least until the second
 half of 1980 and has taken few concrete measures to improve
 US connection.
 United States.   For China, the question of US will and
 determination is crucial, and Beijing is aware that a variety
 of factors complicate US involvement in the region.   On the one
 hand, it is pleased by the enhanced US presence in the Indian
 Ocean and other military moves.   On the other,  it is aware of US
 domestic factors, such as the elections, that could cause
 "vacillation and hesitation" in implementing tougher policies.
 Moreover,  Beijing is aware that US involvement in Southwest Asia
 is complicated by Pakistan's uncertainty about the value of the
 The Chinese remain as committed as ever to waging a pro-

 Kampuchea question has grown slightly more ambiguous, and the
 new government in Bangkok may be less willing--especially over
 the longer term--to cooperate fully with Beijing in maintaining
 the anti-Vietnamese resistance in Kampuchea.   China continues to
 provide military and diplomatic assistance to Pol Pot and to
 oppose vigorously anything that might lead to a compromise solu-
 tion.  Although China has few illusions about Pol Pot's long-term
 prospects,  it believes that if Vietnamese influence--and by exten-
 sion,  Soviet influence--is to be contained in the region,  existing
 ASEAN support for Democratic Kampuchea (DK) must stand firm.

 The Soviet invasion produced an immediate and sharp
 reaction in China.   The Chinese issued a rare Government
 Statement, summoned the Soviet Ambassador to warn that China
 considered its security to be jeopardized, and published
 commentary likening the action to the 1968 invasion of
 Czechoslovakia--an event that helped jolt China out of the
 isolation of the Cultural Revolution.
 Beijing did not at first go beyond heating up its
 rhetoric against the Soviets, however, presumably wanting to
 assess the American reaction to the invasion during secretary
 Brown's visit to Beijing in early January.   On the broader
 strategic plane,  Beijing also wanted to assess the depth of the
 stronger US commitment to resisting Soviet expansionism.   Both
 in the course of the visit and afterward, Beijing signaled its
 satisfaction, and the subsequent visit to the United States by
 Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Wenjin and the projected Geng Biao
 visit confirm the Chinese desire to regularize consultations

 visit in particular and the response to Afghanistan in general,
 Beijing indefinitely postponed the second round of political

 the net effect benefited the US effort.
 China also decided to lend indirect support to the US
 grain boycott of the Soviet Union.   The Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs reportedly asked China's foreign trade apparatus to
 increase purchases of US grain to that end.  Other evidence
 indicates that China's traders were already attracted by
 favorable market conditions resulting from the boycott, but
 On 1 February,  the Chinese announced their support for
 the Olympics boycott and pledged to work with other countries
 to shift the site of the games.   This decision followed by less
 than a week the US announcement of willingness to sell China
 communications and other equipment having military application.
 After the Deng-dominated party plenum in late February the
 Chinese leadership went to considerable lengths to demonstrate
 implacability toward the Soviets.   Moreover, in an authorita-
 tive expression of approval of the US response to Afghanistan a

 25 March People's Daily editorial said US-Soviet contention is
 "irreversible" even though Washington occasionally "vacillates"
 These developments were summed up in an interview that Deng
 Xiaoping gave to an American journalist in circumstances loaded
 with symbolism for Sino-Soviet relations.   On the day the 1950
 Sino-Soviet treaty expired, 11 April, Deng told the US reporter
 that he was "satisfied" with US-China relations, which "are
 due to American domestic politics.
 no tactical move, no matter of expediency or short term duration
 but a major strategic decision."  Deng reportedly made no men-
 tion of the Sino-Soviet treaty, but his remarks effectively
 turned aside a vague Soviet public proposal, made earlier
 In another anti-Soviet signal, the Chinese on 30 April
 held a protest rally in a county along the USSR's Central
 Asian border where an incident had occurred last summer.   In
 an apparent political gesture, the Soviets had chosen 14
 -L    February, the anniversary of the Sino-Soviet treaty, as the
 date to return a Chinese citizen captured during the incident,
 but Beijing pointedly used the rally to play up Soviet
 the week, to reopen border or political negotiations.
 The Chinese have not, however, completely surrendered
 their maneuverability in the strategic triangle.  Even as Deng
 spoke in sharply critical terms of Soviet foreign policy, he
 would not rule out reopening talks with Moscow sometime in the
 future:   "Of course, at an appropriate time when it is necessary,
 there may still be some discussions."   In this way China can
 reopen a channel for communication with the Soviets to help
 "perfidy."
 manage tensions.
 The Chinese have also continued routine state-to-state
 dealings with the Soviets.   Beijing sent a new Ambassador to
 Moscow on 20 April, which was about the time he had been
 scheduled to depart when his appointment first became known
 in December.   Ambassador Yang Shouzheng has had extensive
 experience in Africa; we have no record of any previous work
 on Soviet issues.   Both Chinese and Soviet reporting of his
 Similarly, trade talks are under way in Beijing.   A
 Chinese official in Moscow said in late March that the Soviets
 have again failed to include in the annual trade list certain
 items,  including power generators and coal processing equip-
 ment, that Beijing has long sought.   The official ventured the
 assignment was routine.

 China continues to open new doors and to expand old ties
 with Western Europe, primarily to encourage a stronger, more
 unified anti-Soviet stance, but also to obtain the technology
 and goods necessary to modernize its civilian economy and armed
 forces.   So far, China has had only limited success in pushing
 its hard diplomatic line; trade levels are generally increasing,
 but except for a limited number of low-level, nonlethal mili-
 tary equipment purchases, China has not yet concluded a major

 The official visit in late March by British Defense
 Secretary Francis Pym is indicative of the state of China's
 putative military relationship with the West.   No agreement was
 reached on the longstanding negotiations for the sale of the
 Harrier jump-jet--the Chinese cited its high price--and indeed
 the British now seem to have all but given up hope for the deal.
 The Chinese told Pym that China now seeks to modernize its own
 existing military equipment and to acquire new technology rather
 than make large purchases of the finished products.  Nonetheless,
 Beijing remains interested in military exchanges.   The British
 announced a Royal Navy port call to Shanghai in September and
