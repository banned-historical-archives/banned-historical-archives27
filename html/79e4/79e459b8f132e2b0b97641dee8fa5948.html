 DIAGRAMMATIC PRESENTATION OF PEKING'S LAYOUT      35
 CHANGES IN THE CITY PATTERN   .   .   .   .   .   .   . 37
 INTRODUCTION
 Peking is both a very. old and very new pity-old and.
 rich in its culture and artistic heritage, but new and thriv-
 ing as the capital of People's China.
 Over two thousand years ago Peking was already an
 important political and trading centre. The present city
 walls were built in the fifteenth century during the Ming
 dynasty, but not only the, city but its layout dated back
 to the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty in the thirteenth century.
 Peking was world famous then as an architectural master-
 piece, but as the centuries passed, this ancient city, despite
 its heritage, declined with the last feudal dynasty.
 Since the middle of the nineteenth century, grasping
 foreign powers began their penetration.  China was grad-
 ually turned into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country.
 Peking suffered as did the rest of the country. The Rev-
 olution of 1911 overthrew the Manchu regime, but Pe-
 king's fate hardly improved.  First came warlord rule,
 then the Kuomintang, then Japanese occupation.  The end
 of the war against Japanese aggression brought back the
 dark rule of the Kuomintang. In 1949 the great victory
 of the people's revolution set Peking free.
 As New China's political centre, where the will of the
 entire Chinese people is made manifest, Peking, to the
 people of the world, is the symbol of the country's inde-
 pendence, prosperity and strength.  Peking is very. much
 "on the map" nowadays-Peking's past, yes, but even more,
 Peking's present.  The changes that are taking place in

 this well-loved city are so striking that many people long
 to visit it.
 But Peking's importance is not only political.  It is
 the nation's cultural and educational centre, the seat of the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's highest scien-
 tific research body, and twenty-eight modern universities
 and colleges turning out large numbers of graduates to
 play their part in national construction.  Peking is also
 a museum of art and history, ancient and modern.  It is
 the place where, as all the world knows, famous architec-
 ture is to be seen-the Imperial Palaces and the Temple
 of Heaven, for instance. It is a city of fascinating land-
 scapes-from Peihai Park to the Summer Palace and the
 Western Hills.
 Peking has quickly become a city of international im-
 portance.  Statesmen from all over the world, visitors, and
 delegates to international conferences cone to Peking. In
 the streets, at the theatres and conference halls people
 from China's vast family of nationalities rub shoulders with
 people from other lands.  All lovers of peace are sure of
 a warm welcome in Peking.
 The life of the people has changed greatly in seven
 short years.  Peking's citizens enjoy a peaceful, secure,
 happy life.   They and their children look forward with
 confidence and dignity to a joyful future.  Shops and
 amusement centres are crowded after work and on days
 off.  The pleasure grounds are full of children and parents
 and strolling lovers.
 And not only among its citizens is a new life to be seen.
 Peking's buildings have changed too.  Steel plants, cotton
 mills, cement works now stand on the outskirts.  New
 housing, new shops and markets rise everywhere.   In
 seven years the built-on space has been increased by 70
 per cent! The old dirty streets are no more.  Every little
 lane and courtyard is clean.  The new wide roads, the
 drained swamps are beautified with trees, flowers and
 shrubs.
 Peking, as it grows, is becoming more and more a city
 of production.  In the years to come it will become an
 industrial metropolis as well as the political and cultural
 centre of New China. .

 Geogrnphienl Position
 of Peking
 GEOGRAPHY
 Peking is situated on the northern limits of the Great
 North China Plain, on latitude 39?54' N., longitude 116?28'
 E., and lies shielded by mountains to the north and west.
 It is some 100 miles from the nearest point on the coast-
 the Gulf of Pohai, which has the Liaotung and Shantung
 Peninsulas like two giants on either side, guarding the
 capital. Beyond the, gulf lies the Yellow Sea, which merges
 into the world's largest ocean, the Pacific.  Until recently,
 Tientsin was the port for Peking, but now a great new har-
 bour has been made at Tangku, which is Peking's gateway
 by sea.
 Peking's land connections with all parts of the country
 are good, lying, as it does, at the northern apex of one of
 China's chief grain and cotton growing areas.  To the
 northeast lies our oldest industrial base-Northeast China;
 to the northwest are our largest natural pasture lands-
 the Inner Mongolian grasslands-and the northwest prov-
 inces, already giving proof of their great industrial future;
 to the west are the mountainous lands of Shansi, rich
 in coal and iron ore deposits; while to the south lies the
 most densely populated areas of Central and South China,
 rich in produce of all kinds., From all parts of the country
 people and goods come in a continuous stream.
 Peking is conveniently placed on the Eurasian con-
 tinent.  The U.S.S.R. and the People's Democracies in
 Eastern Europe and Asia form one compact land mass with

 The Great Wall, our world-famous ancient engineering
 wonder, winds along the Yenshan range-the outermost
 ramparts of Peking.  To the southeast, the Yenslians link
 up with the Western Hills. . These beautiful hills are
 visible from Tien An Men (Gate of Heavenly Peace) and
 many Peking rooftops.
 The water supply is potentially adequate.  The largest
 river in North China, the Yungting, skirts the city's west-
 ern outskirts-the famous Marco Polo Bridge is over the
 Yungting.  It is formed from the confluence of three
 rivers, which rise in the loess highlands, beyond the West-
 ern Hills.                       They join in a gorge, some sixty miles N.N.W.
 of Peking. The drop, from the gorge to the plain, is some
 2,700 feet. But like many other Chinese rivers, heavy
 accumulations of silt are brought down in the rainy season
 -in this case silted loess dust.  The Yungting rivals the
 Yellow River in this respect.  Through the centuries, this
 silt has raised the river-bed until in some places it is
 148 feet higher than the level of Peking, and has to be re-
 strained by dykes.  When these give way, the river tem-
 pestuously changes course and floods wide areas.  As the
 only natural outlet is by the river-bed itself, and this is
 considerably higher than the floods, the waters cannot be
 drained, and devastation and misery remain in the water-
 logged land.  In close memory-to take only the last 30
 years-the Yungting has broken its dykes seven times.
 Some 130,000 acres of farmland were inundated, and for
 the most part remained perforce waterlogged, with all
 that that implies in terms of human life and property.
 We smile now at the monstrous naivety of the Manchu
 emperor who in the eighteenth century renamed the un-
 tamed river.  Its former name was Wuting, "The Never
 Still One."  He renamed it Yungting, "The For Ever Still,"
 in the hopes that its nature would change with the name!
 But the last four decades, with their seven disastrous
 floods, are in modern times-from the fall of the Ching
 (Manchu) dynasty in 1911 to the liberation of Peking.
 The reactionary governments of that period (lid no better
 for the people than the emperor.  But the People's Gov-
 ernment, on liberation, mapped out a plan to end this
 misery.  This had to be a plan with' far-reaching con-
 sequences, a plan which dealt with the cause of the trouble
 -the erosion and the loess silt, which comes from an area
 of 18,000 square miles, and is deposited over a basin of
 5,800 square miles.  It must involve harnessing an angry
 river in a gorge. The first step, the building of Kuanting
 Reservoir, was completed within four years.  Four years,
 to survey, plan, and build, after thousands of years of
 ineffective tinkering !
 A huge reservoir has been built which covers 90 square
 miles, and can hold 80,000 million cubic feet of water.  The
 check dam, 148 feet high and 950 feet long, towers at
 the mouth of the Kuanting Gorge, and holds back the
 floods.  To the west is an intake tower, which controls
 the flow through a tunnel cut through the rocks, and directs
 it into a stilling basin and thence into the river.  At the
 other end of the dam is the spillway, 1,414 feet long and
 G5 feet wide, like a giant slide.  So now the waters can
 be controlled.  By December of 1955 (three months ahead
 of schedule) the hydroelectric station was finished - its
 equipment all made in China - and started contributing
 to the high tension grid, feeding Peking, Tientsin, and
 other cities.   Not only that, but now water from the
 Yungting River is being drawn to Peking-a dream of
 the Peking people for 17 centuries comes true !
 From ancient times efforts have been made to exploit
 possible natural sources of water, for Peking and the sur-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 rounding plain.  As far back' as the period of the Three
 Kingdoms (220-280 A.D.) an attempt to dig an irrigation
 channel was made, from near where Peking stands at
 present, to the Yungting.  But the Yungting was unreli-
 able and was anyway full of silt.  When the summer came,
 the floods broke the dykes and silted up the channel. This
 first attempt failed.  In 1171 A.D., during the reign of the
 Nuchens (Golden Tartars), another vain attempt was
 made.  In 1187 A.D. a new direction was tried-to tap
 the Jade Spring, draw it through the Kunming Lake (in
 the present Summer Palace) and the River Changho into
 the city.  These difficult and complicated tasks were well
 carried out, and the natural course of water was success-
 fully changed, but the limited amount of water from the
 Jade Spring Hill was not sufficient to meet the city's needs.
 In 1343 still another attempt was made to get a water
 supply from the Yungting.  Once more it failed, because
 the Yungting would not submit to being tamed.
 Since liberation, the People's Government has taken
 speedy steps to improve Peking's water supply.  It has
 already done much, with sinking wells and in general mak-
 ing better use of existing sources to increase the volume,
 but now this has been linked with the plan to harness the
 Yungting.  The Kuanting Reservoir makes it 'possible to
 use the Kuanting water to supply Peking.
 On January 16, 1956 the cutting of a 12-mile-long water
 channel began, from .the Yungting -River to Peking, in-
 volving the displacement of four million cubic yards of
 earth, with a check dam and sluice-gates at Sanchiatien,
 a village on the, city's western outskirts.  Part of it has
 to be cut through hills, and a 2,300-foot 'tunnel is neces-
 sary.  At its lower end a small hydroelectric power station
 is being built to use the 92-foot drop. The channel brings
 in a daily flow of 3361 million gallons of water-enough
 for the normal needs of '2,800,000 people, or twenty large
 factories, or irrigation for some 130,000 acres of farmland.
 The small hydroelectric station will be used to supply
 power for five 50,000-spindle textile mills.  The work of
 supplying Peking with Yungting water is scheduled to be
 complete before the end of 1956.
 Since very ancient times inland waterways have been
 tremendously used and developed in China.  The Grand
 Canal, whence the tribute rice (the tax in kind) was
 brought thousands of miles from the south to the imperial
 granaries, was connected to Peking through the Tunghui
 Canal.
 The Tunghui Canal was "created" by Kuo Shou-ching,
 a famous hydrologist who in 1262 A.D. worked out a plan
 for a canal.  He used the water from the Jade Spring.
 Later, in 1291 A.D., he tapped the Deity Mountain Spring,
 diverted the water into what is now the Kunming Lake in
 the Summer Palace grounds, then by canal to a lake within
 Peking's walls and subsequently into the Tunghui Canal.
 By these means, the canal received enough water for
 navigation.
 To the northeast of Peking is the River Peiho.  Its
 western tributary joins the Tunghui Canal, and together
 they flow into the Grand Canal.  In later-times, both the
 Grand Canal and the Tunghui Canal partly silted up. But
 now they are being restored and will be used again to
 transport goods between our cities and countryside. '
 Peking has a continental (east coast)' monsoon climate
 of the north temperate zone.  In winter, cold, dry winds
 come from the Siberian land mass.  In summer, warm,
 moist winds come from the Pacific. But the climate re-
 mains continental.  It is the continent,' not the nearby
 ocean, which affects Peking.  On average, the days are

 warm, with a sharp change of temperature during the
 hours of darkness, and no long ducks.  In high summer
 the noonday is often intolerably hot, but usually at sunset
 coolness comes : the nights are like autumn.  The seasons
 change just as abruptly.  It may be said that in Peking
 spring, summer and autumn merge, so that there are really
 only two seasons to all intents and purposes-winter and
 summer.  The cold clays last about five months, during
 which the average temperature is under 100 C. There are
 approximately' 80 days of really severe cold between mid-
 December and the end of February, when the average
 temperature of the coldest month is 4.5? C. below.  The
 hottest summer monthly average is 26.1? C.  The annual
 mean temperature is 11.9? C.-which is quite commonly
 the normal temperature in Peking at the beginning
 and end of summer, which we may call spring and
 autumn.
 Spring comes late, and in a glorious burst.  After the
 season has "officially" begun, snowfalls are not uncommon.
 Spring really starts when the northwest winds cease, and
 the snow finally melts, but summer comes hot on spring's
 heels.
 The spring rainfall is negligible.  Most (lays are clear
 and bright, with intensely dry air, and hours of healthy
 sunshine.  The winds bring frequent dust storms, stinging
 and uncomfortable, but they are usually of short dura-
 tion. The crops and vegetation in general depend on snow-
 falls for moisture at present, but this will gradually change
 as our great afforestation and anti-erosion schemes begin
 to show results.   In Peking itself, since liberation, the
 new roads and new districts have been well planted with
 trees and shrubs.  Shelter belts and orchards are doing
 well along the lower reaches of the Yungting River,
 and already the troublesome dust storms have begun
 to lessen.

 Cutting the channel for water from the Yungting for Peking
 Some rain comes in May and June, with the southeast
 breezes.  Our parks and gardens are full of colour-
 peonies, lilac, pomegranates, oleanders, almonds.  Poplars,
 willows, and locust-trees colour the streets with fresh
 green.   From rooftop level Peking is seen as being under
 a leafy canopy.
 The annual rainfall for the city averages 25 inches.
 Two-thirds of this falls in July and August, with the
 greatest precipitation in July.  Tremendous but short
 downpours occur then, which quickly yield to bright, burn-
 ing sunshine again.
 These treinendous short downpours present a difficult
 problem as far as drainage is concerned.  This problem,
 however, is being gradually solved, thanks to the construc-
 tion of the Kuanting Reservoir and the overhauling of the
 city's drainage system.
 After August the weather begins to turn cool quite
 sharply, and the days gradually get shorter.  This is
 Peking's best time of year, with long days of glowing sun
 under a cloudless sky.  The grapes hang on the trellises,
 red apples shine, and the sweet pears and Peking dates
 ripen.
 Then comes the Mid-Autumn Festival - round about
 September 20 - and the leaves begin to wither and fall.
 The street pedlar who cries :
 Here come turnips
 Sweet as pears!
 is the herald of winter.
 From September or October on, northeast winds again
 blow, and there is no more rain except for occasional falls
 of sleet.  The frosts last from early November until
 March.  Peking's frozen lakes and canals make winter
 skating 'a highly popular outdoor sport.

 and Ulan Bator was opened to traffic.  This line, jointly
 built by China, the Soviet Union and Mongolian 'People's
 Republic, connects with a direct link to the Soviet Union
 at Ulan Bator, and shortens the Peking-Moscow journey
 by 684- miles.  The rail distance between the two capitals
 will be further shortened when the Lanchow-Urumchi-
 Alma Ata Railway (now being jointly laid by China and
 the Soviet Union) is completed.
 Communications between China and the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam are now greatly improved, and since
 August 1955 good rail connections exist between Peking
 and Hanoi.
 Peking is the centre of a network of highways-to
 Tangku and Tientsin, Chengteh and Changchiakou the
 latter two being the links between the Inner, Mongolian
 Autonomous Region-and Peking.  The entire network of
 main roads on the North China Plain and the Northeast
 Plain, which in turn connects with every part of the coun-
 try, leads to the capital.
 Airlines, too, radiate from Peking-to Taiyuan, Sian
 and Chungking and thence to Kunming; to Hsuchow,
 Nanking and Shanghai; to Wuhan, Canton and thence to
 Nanning and Chanchiang; to Tientsin, Shenyang and
 Harbin and thence to Tsitsihar; and to Sian and Lanchow
 and thence to Urumchi via Chiuchuan and Hami.  There
 are three direct airlines to the Soviet Union : to Chita via .
 Shenyang and Harbin; to Irkutsk via Saiyinsata and Ulan
 Bator; and to Alma Ata via Sian, Lanchow and Urumchi.'
 Other international airlines connect China with the Demo-
 cratic Republic of Vietnam and Burma. Air travellers
 from Peking can make good connections at Canton for
 Hanoi via Nanning, and for Mandalay and Rangoon via
 Kunming.

 Peking is the centre from which all China's communica-
 tions-by rail, highway and air-radiate.
 From the railway station just outside Peking's Front
 Gate (Chien Men) four lines lead in different directions-
 northeast via Tientsin and Shanhaikuan to Shenyang,
 thence to Manchouli (from Tientsin a main line runs to
 Shanghai),; south to Hankow and thence to Canton; north
 to the Kupeikow, Pass; and northwest to Changchiakou
 and Paotow.  Express through trains run every day to all
 China's big cities-Shanghai, Tsingtao, Taiyuan, Sian,
 Shenyang, Changchun, Manchouli, etc. There is also a local
 service between Peking and Mentoukou, a mining district
 on the western outskirts.  Fengtai, a junction station on
 Peking's southern outskirts, has been connected with the
 main station by double track since January 1954 instead
 of single track as hitherto, which has relieved the heavy
 congestion on the main lines.  In July 1955 a new line
 was opened to traffic between Fengtai and Shacheng, a
 65-mile length which passes the Kuanting Reservoir and
 has speeded up traffic on the Peking-Paotow line.  The
 latter line is now being extended to Lanchow, whence
 another great artery is under construction to Sinkiang.
 In Southwest China two trunk lines-one between Pao-
 chi in Shensi Province and Chengtu in Szechuan Province,
 which is being laid, and another between Chengtu and

 HISTORY
 1.  A BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH
 Several cities have, at one time or another in China's
 long history, served as her capital; but Peking can boast
 of being one of the oldest, second to Changan (now Sian)
 and Loyang.          It was the capital during the feudal dynas-
 ties for a thousand years.
 Between 1918 and 1939, the fossil remains of the world-
 famous Peking Man (Sinanthropus Pekinensis) and the
 fossil remains of another kind of man, Upper Cave Man,
 were unearthed at Choukoutien, a village 34 miles south-
 west of Peking.  Peking Man lived 500,000 years ago.
 Upper Cave Man lived about 50,000 years ago.  There is
 necessarily, as yet, a long period in Peking's history which
 has to be left blank, but we do know that primitive com-
 munities had settled down 3,000 years ago on or near the
 site where Peking now stands.
 Round about 2,200 years' ago it was made a capital for
 the first time.  That was during the period of the Warring
 States (403-221 B.C.). One of the Seven States, the King-
 dom of Yen, established its capital near the present city.
 This capital was called Chi.
 In 221 B.C. another of the Seven States-Chin-gained
 control of a united China, with power invested in a central
 government, and the Yen capital was incorporated into a
 prefecture or governmental district.  During the Han
 dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) this area was still in the
 territory of Yen.  Later it was given the name of Yuchou.
 During the period of the Three Kingdoms (220-280 A.D.)
 it was again called Yen.
 The northern border of the China of those days ran
 close to Peking, and northern nomadic tribes frequently
 broke in from across the border.  Thus Peking became an
 important strategic area as well as a local political centre.
 For close on three hundred years (314-589 A.D.) this
 northern territory, including the site where Peking now
 stands, Was, indeed, largely un4ler the control of invading
 nomads.  It was not until the Tang dynasty. (618-907
 A.D.) that it was recovered.  By the middle of the Tang
 dynasty, steps were taken to prevent the tribesmen, the
 Hsis and Khitans, from raiding the border lands and the
 local capital. The position of Peking, then called Yuchou,
 became increasingly important.  But later the Khitans
 became stronger, established the Liao Kingdom  (916-
 1124 A.D.) and invaded and occupied Yuchou and other
 places around. Yuchou was renamed Yenching in 938 A.D.,
 and was made one of the Liao provisional capitals. More
 than that, taking advantage of the prevailing chaos in
 China, the Liao rulers turned Yenching into a stronghold
 from which to make further inroads.
 In 960 A.D., Chao Kuang-yin founded the Sung dynasty
 (960-1279 A.D.) in the South. Preoccupied with the sup-
 pression of internal disturbances, he was content to take
 a merely : defensive attitude to the Liaos.  His brother,
 Chao Kuang-yi, tried to recover Yuchou and other lost
 territories, but was defeated in his two northern campaigns.
 In the early twelfth century, the Golden Tartars rose
 in Liaotung (in Northeast China), defeated the Liao troops,
 established the State of Chin (1115-1234 A.D.), and seized
 all their territory, including Peking.  In 1153 A.D. the
 State of Chin removed its capital to Yenching, and
 renamed it Chungtu (Middle Capital).
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Chungtu under the Golden Tartars was rebuilt on a
 large scale, with splendidly decorated palaces, and halls.
 Hundreds of thousands of workers were. conscripted, enor-
 mous sjims of money spent and countless lives sacrificed
 in creating this luxury.
 Less than seventy years after this-in 1215-it fell
 to the Mongols under Genghis Khan.  In the battle, the
 palaces of the State of Chin were set on fire, and blazed
 for over a month.  The Chin troops were defeated and
 Chungtu had a new master.  Kublai Khan renamed it Tatu
 (Great Capital) in 1272 and it became the capital of the
 Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.).
 Tatu was much larger than either of its forerunners,
 and was rebuilt slightly northeast of the old site.  Again
 there arose magnificent palaces and halls; beautiful lakes
 surrounded by pleasure gardens were created, and the
 place was packed with treasures of every description looted
 from the people.  It was at this time that a canal-the
 Tunghui Canal-was dug and made to connect with the
 Grand Canal, so that the boats transporting the tribute
 rice from the provinces south of the Yangtse could come
 right up to one of the new lakes inside the city.  Tatu,
 with its magnificent imperial palaces, its treasures coming
 from every corner of the country, the stupendous feasts
 which the Great Khan gave on state occasions, and the
 well organized post-stages on the roads to the city all
 astounded Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who visited
 Tatu under Kublai Khan.
 In the middle of the fourteenth century, Chu Yuan-
 chang headed a peasant revolt which overthrew the Yuan
 dynasty and established the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).
 He moved his capital south, to Chinling, and called it Nan-
 king (the Southern Capital).  Tatu was renamed Peiping
 (Northern Peace), and was placed under his son's rule.
 On Chu Yuan-chang's death, the throne should have passed
 to his grandson, but his son, Chu Ti, who ruled Peiping,
 usurped the throne.  In 1403, it was renamed Peking (the
 Northern Capital). In 1420 it was made the capital city of
 the Ming dynasty and remained so until the dynasty fell.
 Peking in the Ming period grew on a yet grander scale,
 even more magnificent than under the Mongols. To begin
 with, the old city and the palaces were taken over as they
 stood. Subsequently the capital was rebuilt and enlarged.
 An 'Outer City was added, and new temples and altars
 built, until there were altogether 786 buildings-palaces,
 throne halls, pavilions and gate towers.
 So Peking stood until, in 1644, there was a peasant
 uprising led by Li Tse-cheng, who took the city.  His
 army held it for only 40 days, because the Manchus were
 simultaneously preparing an incursion south of the Great
 Wall, and at the end of this time, thanks to the treachery
 of a Ming general who opened the pass, they swept down
 on the city.  Peking fell intact, and was declared the
 Manchu capital the same year by Shun Chih, the first em-
 peror of the Manchu dynasty.  This was the last imperial
 dynasty, and lasted for 267 years.
 Peking remained superficially the same throughout
 these years.  Buildings that needed repair or were derelict
 were rebuilt, 17ut substantially to the same pattern.
 The city plan was unaltered, though many palaces,
 temples and pavilions were added outside the walls to the
 west, notably Yuan Ming Yuan (the Old Summer Palace).,
 All the new buildings were centred round the life of the
 imperial court.  They were either for the direct use of-
 the imperial family and its ramifications, or for its minis-
 ters and favourites. Peking was full of treasure squeezed
 out of the people or made specially for the emperors, the
 monopolists of feudal times.
 But a hundred years ago a tremendous change came
 over all this.  To Peking where, in all these years, in-

 of the Manchus, the Diplomatic Corps in Peking was vir-
 tually a superior governing power.
 After the victory of the October Revolution in 1917,
 the new-born Soviet state abrogated all unequal treaties
 which Tsarist Russia had forced on China, and withdrew
 its troops from the "Legation Quarter."
 Under Kuomintang rule, which followed the northern
 warlord period, Peking was no longer the capital-and the
 name was accordingly changed from Peking to Peiping.
 After the Incident of September 18, 1931, Japanese
 aggressors occupied China's northeastern territories meet-
 ing, on Chiang Kai-shek's orders, no resistance from the
 Kuomintang forces.  The aggressors then turned their
 spearhead against North China and Peking.  The Kuomin-
 tang government persisted in its policy of non-resistance.
 For Peking, the years between 1931 and 1937 were years
 of instability and disturbance.  On July 7, 1937, the Japa-
 nese attacked the Marco Polo Bridge, west of Peking's Outer
 City, which started eight years of all-out war against China.
 Again Peking suffered alien occupation, this time by
 the Japanese.  After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the
 Kuomintang, with the help of American bayonets, re-
 entered the city.
 In 1949, Peking was again in the hands of the Chinese
 people.
 2.  A CITY OF GLORIOUS REVOLUTIONARY TRADITIONS
 Peking occupies an. important place in China's revolu-
 tionary history. In 1895, during the last years of Manchu
 rule, after China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, 1,300
 candidates who had been suceessful in the provincial ex-
 aminations and had come to Peking to sit for the imperial
 examinations, submitted a memorial to the emperor ex-
 pressing their opposition to the terms of the Peace Treaty
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 vaders had generally come from the north and west, over
 China's land frontiers, came a new menace.  The capitalist
 countries of Europe and America began to invade China
 from the sea, shaking the already tottering Manchu Em-
 pire to its foundations.  In the Second Opium War (1860),
 Anglo-French forces occupied Peking, and compelled the
 'Manchu rulers to conclude the Convention of Peking
 (which confirmed the Treaties of Tientsin), pay heavy in-
 demnities and admit other humiliating claims.  During
 their occupation they burnt down and ruthlessly looted
 the Old Summer Palace and other treasure houses full of
 antiques.
 Forty years later, using the Yi Ho Tuan (the Boxer)
 Uprising as a convenient pretext, the combined forces of
 eight powers (Britain, the United States of America,
 Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and
 Italy) occupied Peking, killing, burning, raping and plunder-
 ing.  This time the invading. forces demanded possession
 of part of Peking. - The Manchu rulers gave them extra-
 territorial rights in an area which later became known as
 the "Legation Quarter." Inside this "Quarter" China had
 no sovereign rights.  Chinese were not allowed to own
 buildings or reside within its high walls. Chinese soldiers
 and police were forbidden to enter.  Inside the walls with
 their, embrasures were barracks full of foreign soldiers,
 their guns trained on the Chinese people.
 The Diplomatic Corps constituted itself a special polit-
 ical force, and all but controlled. the Manchu rulers, whose
 power declined from clay to day.  In 1911 they finally col-
 lapsed under the impact of the revolution that ushered in
 the Republic, and Peking ended its long career as the
 capital of a feudal empire. ' Within a few years, however,
 internecine strife between the warlords broke out, and
 gave the foreign powers a further opportunity to keep an
 ever more open grip on China; and, as in the last years
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 and putting forward proposals for political reform. Again,
 in the closing years of Manchu rule, the Yi Ho Tuan
 (Boxers) put up a stubborn fight against imperialist ag-
 gression.
 These two events foreshadowed mass movements in Pe-
 lting. But it was the May the Fourth Movement in 1919 that
 turned a decisive page in Peking's, and China's, history.
 On the morning of May 4, 1919, Peking students held
 a great demonstration, a demonstration which was to have
 far-reaching consequences.  It was held as a protest
 against the treatment of China by the imperialist powers
 at the end of World War I.  The Paris Peace Conference
 had calmly awarded Germany's unlawful "possessions" in
 Shantung to Japan.  Japan had thrust the infamous
 Twenty-one Demands on China, and the faint-hearted
 Chinese government of the time had accepted them. Both
 these events amounted to a denial of China's independence.
 The students gathered outside Tien An Men and began
 to march to the "Legation Quarter."  Before they got
 there, they were stopped by foreign troops.  They turned
 to a government official's house-the house of Tsao Ju-fin,
 Minister of Communications, who along with Chang Tsung-
 hsiang, the Chinese Minister to Japan, and Lu Tsung-yu,
 another high official, was known as a pro-Japanese traitor.
 The students were further enraged to find that at that
 very time these officials were holding a discussion with
 the Japanese.  Shouting "Restore our rights and interests
 in Shantung!" "Punish the traitors!" "Down with the
 Twenty-one Demands!" "Refuse to sign the Paris Peace
 Treaty !" they caught Chang Tsung-hsiang and beat him,
 and set fire to Tsao Ju-lin's house.
 The warlords who held power in Peking struck back
 hard. Many of the students were arrested and imprisoned.
 But they and the people refused to be cowed. , All over
 the country, people came out in support.  Workers went
 on strike, merchants suspended business and fellow stu-
 dents elsewhere joined in voicing these demands.  The
 movement went far beyond Peking.  All anti-imperialist
 and anti-feudal forces were behind it.  Mao Tse-tung
 summed up its importance in the following words: "Its
 outstanding historical significance lies in a feature which
 was absent in the Revolution of 1911, namely, a thorough
 and  uncompromising opposition to  imperialism and a
 thorough and uncompromising opposition to feudalism." In
 another place, he said, "It was part of the world proletarian
 revolution of that time."
 Seven years later, in 1926, a massacre took place in
 Peking. Under the pretext of enforcing the "Boxer" Pro-
 tocol of 1901, the Japanese, backed by the Diplomatic
 Corps, sent an ultimatum to the warlord government, de-
 manding that all fortifications at the Taku Fort should
 be dismantled.  The purpose behind this was, in fact, to
 make it easier for a certain pro-Japanese warlord, Chang
 Tso-lin, to attack Tientsin.  Again, on March 18, the stu-
 dent body and the people in Peking took action.  A great
 crowd collected outside Tien An Men, and marched to the
 government headquarters.      Here they were met by armed
 guards, who opened fire, killing and wounding several hun-
 dred.  The massacre was followed by a terror.  The
 warlords, hand in glove with the imperialists, tried by every
 means to turn back the rising tide.  All patriots were ?
 hunted and persecuted, and warrants were issued for over
 fifty people, among them Li Ta-chao, one of the founders
 of the Chinese Communist Party, and Lu Hsun, the rev-
 olutionary writer.  They managed to arrest Li Ta-chao,
 and he was- executed by Chang Tso-fin in April 1927.
 Having occupied the Northeast since 1931, the Japanese
 aggressors then began to seize North China.  A series of
 events occurred in which the Kuomintang government sold
 out the country's rights and submitted to Japan's humi-

 Bating demands every time.  In June 1935, an agreement i;
 -the "Ho-Umezu" agreement-was signed in Peking be-
 tween Ho Ying-chin, the Kuomintang government repre-'
 sentative in North China, and Yoshijiro Umezu, com-
 mander of the Japanese armed forces in North China.
 The agreement purported to recognize Japan's "special
 political power in North China," thus allowing it to inter-
 fere in China's internal affairs. In November of the same
 year the Japanese aggressors, through collaborators, en-
 gineered the "movement for autonomy in the five northern
 provinces" and the subsequent establishment of the bogus
 "Anti-Communist Autonomous Administration" in eastern
 Hopei.  To meet the Japanese demand for "special polit-
 ical power in North China," the Kuomintang government
 appointed a local Kuomintang warlord to head a "Political
 Affairs Commission for Hopei and Chahar."  All this
 placed Peking and the whole of North China in a very
 dangerous situation.
 Earlier, on August 1, 1935 the Chinese Communist
 Party had issued a clarion call to all patriots. They de-
 manded that the Kuomintang should call off its civil war
 against the Communists and put up a real resistance to
 Japan's constant aggression. It was in answer to this call
 that another great patriotic movement swept Peking, the
 December the Ninth Movement.
 On December 9, 1935, the Peking students issued a
 statement calling on the people to fight Japan and strive
 for national independence.  "How can we sit down and
 study," they said, "as long as the Japanese enemy is not
 driven out?"  They came out in force and put their de-
 mands to the Kuomintang representative. These demands
 were rejected-rejected with bayonets and fire-hoses

 North China !"  "Down with Japanese imperialism !" "De-
 fend North China by arms!"  These slogans were taken
 up by students, workers and peasants all over China.
 A week later, on December 16, the date set by the Kuo-
 mintang reactionaries for the inauguration- of the "Polit-
 ical Affairs Commission for Hopei and Chahar," the Peking
 students carried out another demonstration, holding a mass
 meeting of Peking citizens in the square outside Chien
 Men.  A resolution was passed rejecting such a commis-
 sion.                                                                                  In the face of armed guards and police armed with
 swords and whips, the students undauntedly spoke for the
 people.  The pressure of public opinion compelled the
 reactionaries to postpone the setting up of the commission
 for the time being.                          ,
 The students' patriotic movements on December 9 and
 16 soon turned into a national movement to resist Japan
 and save the country.  More and more people of all sorts
 and conditions joined. in. The students themselves turned
 their fiery energies to action.  They organized propaganda
 groups which went into the nearby country districts to
 urge resistance to Japanese aggression.  Led by the Chi-
 nese Communist Party, they formed the "Vanguards of
 National Liberation," who became the core of the national
 salvation movement in various areas.  It was from then
 on that the young intellectuals of China began to identify
 themselves with the people.  All this originated in Peking.
 When the War of Resistance to Japanese Aggression
 started in 1937, many of the same students in Peking
 joined the people's forces-the Eighth Route Army and the
 New Fourth Army.  Among them were many "Vanguards
 of National Liberation."- They carried on guerrilla war-
 fare against the Japanese and puppet troops from their
 bases in the Western Hills and nearby.
 After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Peking students
 kept up their revolutionary tradition.  In December 1946

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 they staged a great demonstration and march to protest
 against the rape of a girl student at Peking University by
 an American soldier.  In May 1947, the year in which the
 Kuomintang government again started all-out civil war
 against the Communists, subjecting the people to extreme
 hardship and trampling on civil rights, the Peking students
 came out in a huge demonstration "against civil. war,
 starvation and persecution." '
 For three decades-ever since the May the Fourth
 Movement in 1919-Peking witnessed these great patriotic
 outbursts.  They have now borne fruit in the victory of
 the Chinese people's revolution, the victory which liberated
 the whole country. Today, Peking students, together with
 Peking citizens in all walks of life, with the Chinese Com-
 munist Party in the lead, are giving of their best in order
 to build China into a great socialist country.
 Peking city plan encloses four walled cities-the Inner
 and Outer Cities, the Imperial City (now minus all its walls
 except for the southern end) and the Forbidden City.
 The city is shaped like a Chinese character a , or the
 letter T upside down, the cross stroke being to the south.
 The upper (northern) section is called the Inner City,
 and this contains within it the Imperial City and the For-
 bidden City.  No roads run through the latter.  To this
 day all traffic has to go round it.  It is the centre round
 which the old city was built.  A beeline-five miles long
 -could be drawn through Peking, from north to south.
 All the imperial buildings will be found to be built round
 this one line. The main gates and palaces are either on
 this line, or grouped symmetrically on either side, and
 their golden tiled roofs rise and fall rhythmically.

 Starting from the 'extreme southern point of this
 imaginary line, from Yung Ting Men, the middle gate in
 the wall of the Outer City, we see on either side almost
 at once two groups of buildings behind their red walls-
 the Temple of Heaven on the right, or east side, and the
 - Temple of Agriculture on the west.  The road runs due
 north, through a busy shopping district. In front of us
 looms a great gate tower, the main Front Gate to the
 Inner City, Chien Men.  Here the road divides, but the
 design of the city does not vary. Behind Chien Men is
 another gate, Chung Hua Men, and in front of us lies a
 great square, and Tien An Men itself, the gate to the Im-
 perial City.  Go through Tien An Men, and then Wu Alen
 (Meridian Gate), and a series of courtyards and palaces
 open before us across a marble-bridged stream-the Golden
 Stream-wide courtyards, and above them row upon row
 of glazed tiles on the tilted eaves. The great hall which
 we now approach is Tai Ho Tien (Hall of Supreme Har-
 mony).  Still going due north we cross the moat again at
 Shen Wu Men (Gate of Godly Prowess), and see before us
 a steep hill - Coal Hill - crowned by Wan Chun Ting
 (Pavilion of Eternal Spring). This is the only point of the
 line which is higher than Tai Ho Tien.  Behind it there
 was, until recently, a gate-Ti An Men-which has been
 removed to facilitate traffic.  Further on there are two
 more towers-the Drum Tower (which used to mark the
 hours by drum beats), and the Bell Tower (which used to
 sound the curfew).  This is the end of the line of build-
 ings.  There is no central "back" gate, though there are
 -two gates-An Ting Men and Teh Sheng Men-in the
 north wall of the Inner City, following the symmetry
 which is. inherent in the architectural' layout of Chinese
 tradition.
 Peking as a city has undergone many changes, but
 through all these changes the site was approximately the
 same from the Tang dynasty (618-907 A.D.) onwards. In
 the last 800 years the city was rebuilt four times.  To
 superimpose the varying sites on present-day Peking will
 best illustrate these changes.
 (1) From 1153 to 1215 it was called Chungtu, the
 capital of the Golden Tartars, ten miles round, at the
 southwest corner of today's Inner City and west of the
 present Outer City.
 (2) From 1267 to 1368, as the capital of the Yuan
 dynasty it was renamed Tatu.  Tatu was 20 miles round
 and was built to the northeast of the former city approx-
 imately where the Inner City now stands in fact but with
 its northern limits extended further.  This more or less
 fixed Peking's present site.  The court buildings were
 built slightly southwest of the centre of the city, by the
 side of the present Peihai and Chunghai Lakes; they were
 the predecessors of the palaces of the Ming and Ching
 dynasties. The city plan was largely modelled on Chungtu
 -with walls, watchtowers, moats and. bridges-and also
 incorporated the ancient imperial traditions, with the Altar
 of Land and Grain on the west side of the palaces and the
 Ancestral Temple on their east.  Behind (north) lay the
 market place.
 (3) From 1368 to 1419 it was at first called Peiping,
 and after 1403, in the early Ming dynasty; renamed Peking.
 It was not,the capital-that was then at Nanking. After
 the Mings had captured Tatu from the Mongols in 1368,

 PLACES OF INTEREST AND
 ANCIENT MONUMENTS
 Tien An Men (Gate of Heavenly Peace) is not only a
 building of beauty and historical interest, but now has an
 added political significance, so much so that it has been
 taken as the heart of the national emblem of the People's
 Republic of China.
 It stands on an ancient site-the south central gate
 of the Imperial City, which was built by a Ming emperor
 in 1420 A.D.  The original gate was burnt down and re-
 built in 1651, since when it has borne its present name.
 The marble bridges which span the moat in front were
 added later:
 In feudal clays the Imperial Rescripts-the edicts and
 proclamations-were given out from Tien An Men.  The
 custom was to wedge the scroll containing the "Divine
 Decree" in the bill of a carved phoenix, which vas then
 thrown over the.parapet to officials kneeling below, whose
 duty it was to relay -the contents to the nation.
 But, like the Manchu dynasty itself, by 1911 Tien An
 Men was in a sorry state.' Weeds and shrubs grew in the
 crevices of the crumbling walls, and the carved pillars in
 front were defaced.  In fact when repairs were- carried
 out after liberation the gate tower was found to have been
 pitted by shell fire at the time when the combined forces
 of eight imperialist powers invaded Peking in 1900.

 It was with the founding of New China that Tien An
 Men returned to its former glory, and .more. Tien An
 Men was now the heritage not of emperors, but of the
 people.  The great blockhouse gate has been lovingly re-
 .paired and restored according to the traditional pattern.
 Again the golden tiles on the uptilted roofs gleam above
 the red walls which glow round the enlarged Tien An Men
 Square, now a place of proud gatherings and free demon-
 strations.  Now the national emblem shines under the
 eaves in the centre and two inscriptions run the length
 of the walls on either side of the entrance: "Long Live
 the People's Republic of China!" and "Long Live the Great
 Unity of the Peoples of the World!"  On both sides of
 the marble bridges and on either side of the square are
 reviewing stands, six in all, which hold ten thousand on-
 lookers for the great parades.
 Due south-that is, standing with one's back to Tien
 An Men-stands a great monolith, nearly completed.  It
 out-tops Tien An Alen by some 14 feet.  It is the Monu-
 ment to the People's Heroes.  On the side facing Tien An
 Men is the carved inscription, in Chairman Mao Tse-tung's
 calligraphy, "The People's Heroes Are Immortal !"  On
 the other side is an inscription approved by the first ses-
 sion of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Con-
 ference.  Round the base are bas-reliefs depicting the
 heroic deeds of fighters for liberation over the past hun-
 dred years. A flight of steps leads to a balcony with
 double-tiered marble balustrades, where wreaths may be
 laid. Between the monolith and Tien An Men the national
 flag flies high.
 On October 1, 1949 three hundred thousand people
 gathered in the square to hear the People's Republic pro-
 claimed.    The red banners fluttered in the breeze, and
 songs resounded.  Chairman Mao Tse-tung hoisted the
 five-starred national flag and proclaimed the inauguration

 N
 of the Central People's Government of the People's Repub-
 lic of China.  The words rang out:  "The Chinese nation
 is not going to be insulted by anybody from now on.  We
 have stood up !"
 Since then, on May Day and on National Day, October
 1, the people of Peking, in their hundreds of thousands,
 proudly wearing their best clothes, march' past Tien An
 Men. A kaleidoscope of changing colours, gay with flowers,
 flags, banners, charts and representations of trades and
 industries, they are reviewed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 and the other government leaders.  Shouting slogans,
 singing, cheering, they are a living proof of their deter-
 mination to defend world peace and build socialism in
 China.
 Till late into the night Tien An Men Square is filled
 with rejoicing cr,owds.  As dusk falls, people pour in from
 all over the city and from the surrounding countryside.
 The buildings are flood-lit, decorated with flags and lanterns,'
 and along Tien An Men itself sway huge palace lanterns,
 glowing red.   Searchlights pale the stars and fireworks
 dazzle and flash.  Throughout the square and along the
 great wide street' rings out music for the dancing, singing
 crowds.  The citizens of Peking dance and rejoice together
 with their heroes of labour and the battlefield, their peo-
 ple's deputies, peoples from all China's great family of
 nationalities and friends of China from all over the world.
 These are great, happy days for Tien An Men.  But in
 the thirty years before the birth of New China, it saw
 other manifestations of the people's strength and the
 people's determination.  The great student demonstrations
 during the May the Fourth Movement in 1919, the mass.
 meeting in support of tariff autonomy in 1925, the March
 the Eighteenth Movement (1926), when Peking students
 demonstrated against' Japanese imperialism and the Dec-
 ember the Ninth (1935) student'. demonstration against

 2.  TIIN MAIN STREETS AND SHOPPING CENTRES
 Peking changes all the time.  The main shopping cen-
 tres used to be concentrated irrationally on the east side
 of the city or outside the main central outer gate City. Chien This
 sup-
 in the wall between the Inner and now been mchange anner of and state       and
 a are far co-operatives
 mo more evenly
 plying all
 distributed.
 Let us stroll round Peking, starting from Tien An Men.
 A great wide boulevard stretches both ways, 'east and
 west, wide enough to take three lanes of traffic each side
 of the tree-lined tram lines in the middle. Old green trees
 shade the wide pavements on each side, and there is now
 bicycles,
 increasing road traffic-trams, buses, lorries, cars,
 pedicabs-on this main thoroughfare.
 Here we will go further west. On our right, breaking
 the line of high red
 tower. great
 Under the tilted eaves
 brilliantly
 hangs our national emblem. Here is the heart of Peking
 -indeed the heart of China. This is the seat of govern-
 ment.  Behind the doors of Hsin Hua Men live and work
 r url.i1er  niviib
 Municipal People's Council Hall.  Here the trees are not
 so big - they are newly planted.  North and south now
 runs a crowded, busy shopping area, the centre for the
 u-
 n
 t
 g
 a
 west city. The main roads of Peking follow the rec
 lar plan of ti-
 this road in the east city.  Down this road lies a bazaar.
 Here is all the bustle of a shopping centre - meat and
 vegetable markets, big co-operative stores, and all manner
 of shops supplying daily needs and luxuries.  About a mile
 north we see a major road at right angles.    Looking west
 we see a gate tower - the Fu Cheng Men and to the right
 of it a dagoba, gleaming above the rooftops.
 Quite near this dagoba lived the famous revolutionary
 writer, Lu Hsun.  It was here that he wrote most of his
 essays and articles, in pungent language, against the peo-
 ple's enemies.  The actual address is: 21 Hsi Shan Tiao,
 Kung Men,Kou. It is a simple little house in a small com-
 pound.  His bedroom-study-known as the "Tiger's Tail"
 -is still kept as it was when he lived there.
 Let us now go east from the main road.  We pass by
 the Catholic Cathedral, off the road to the left, the ad-
 ministrative office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 and the National Library, and cross the lovely marble
 bridge which separates Peihai from Chunghai and Nanhai
 Lakes.  This bridge-called Chin Ao Yu Tung, meaning
 Golden Turtle and Jade Rainbow-is an important cross-
 ing for Peking's east-west heavy traffic.  It is being
 widened and will soon be four times as wide as it is now.
 We reach the other end of the bridge and pass a high
 round building, the Round City, and then the main en-
 trance to Peihai Park.  Soon, on our right we see the
 moat and walls of the Forbidden City.
 A little beyond we find on our right the back gate of
 the Imperial Palaces and on our left, Coal Hill, now'a pub-
 lic park.  Turning north and then east we find ourselves
 in front of the Hung Lou (Red Building), originally built
 and used by the Peking University.  It stands in Demo-
 cratic Square, named to commemorate the revolutionary
 tradition of the university., In one corner- of the ground
 floor are two rooms in which revolutionary relics are kept.
 One is the memorial hall to Li Ta-chao, one of the founders
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Japanese imperialism and civil war-all these took place
 on the Tien An Men Square.
 Tien An Men is a landmark of the Chinese people's rev-
 olution.
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 of the Chinese Communist Party who died a martyr's
 death at the hands of a warlord in 1927.  It has a desk
 by the window, a bookshelf and a cane chair. This was
 Li Ta-chao's office when lie was a professor and chief
 librarian in the university.  It is kept exactly as it was
 when he lived there, except that now some of his, belong-
 ings and documents are also on display.
 The other room, the outer of the two, displays the
 articles used by Chairman Mao when he worked on the
 university staff-the small desk and the somewhat shabby
 chair he used in 1918-19.  There are various documents-
 the teachers' and staff payroll and the list of ticket-holders
 for the lectures sponsored by the Society of Journalists.
 Chairman Mao's name appears on both of these. Also on
 display are other documents and souvenirs which have a
 bearing on Chairman Mao's life and work.
 We walk out of the Red Building, turn south and soon
 reach Tung An Men Street in the east city, and come into
 Wang Fu Ching Street, a great shopping centre.  On the
 east side is the Tung An Bazaar, which occupies nearly
 ten acres.  In it there are six hundred odd stalls and small
 shops, selling all manner of articles.  But the main stress
 is on the specialities of Peking-curios and objets d'ar'ts,
 handicrafts, old books, and preserved fruits.  The Chi
 Hsiang Theatre and the famous Tung 'Lai Shun - the
 "instant boiled mutton" restaurant - are also in Tung An
 Bazaar.  There must be few Peking residents or visitors
 who have not dawdled round Tung An Bazaar, enjoying
 the bustle and 'the delights of the stalls.
 You will find many other interesting shops here - the
 Peking Department Store, a modern six-storeyed building,
 the largest department store in the capital, the Arts and
 Crafts Shop, both on the west side of the street, a large
 branch of Hsinhua Books', and the Guozi Shudian (Inter-
 national Bookshop).  Going due south, across the broad
 East Changan Boulevard to Tai Chi Chang Lane, we enter
 what was once the "Legation Quarter" and go along Tung
 Chiao Min Hsiang, which was the main road there. It runs
 from east to west.  There is no sign of the typical Peking
 streets and houses here.  For 50 years this stretch of
 land was "occupied" by the imperialists, right up to the
 liberation of Peking in 1949, wlien it came back to the
 people.
 The west end of the Tung Chiao Min Hsiang runs in
 almost at Chien Men, the main Central Gate to the Inner
 City.  This gate lies on the north-south central axis of the
 city, as does the street named after it, which runs due
 south from the gate like a broad river fed by many tribu-
 taries.   Vehicles and pedestrians pass in an unending
 stream here, Peking's busiest shopping area.
 Narrow streets, lined with shops, as we have said, run
 into both sides of Chien Men Street-Lang Fang Tou
 Tiao, Ta Shan Lan, Hsien Yu Kou, Chu Shih Kou, etc.
 Here are famous shops, some dating back several hundred
 years-Tung Jen Tang, the Chinese medicinal herbs
 shop, Jui Fu Hsiang, renowned for silks, satin and furs,
 Chuan Chu Teh for roast duck, and so on.  There is also
 a bazaar, a counterpart of the one on the Wang Fu Ching
 Street and the one in the west city.  Around this district
 are shops and workshops, specializing in cloisonne, ivory
 carvings, palace lanterns, silk flowers, and so on.
 Not far from the west end of Ta Shan Lan is Liu Li
 Chang, the home of antiques, china, curios, where one can
 find ancient books, Chinese ink and brushes, hand-made
 papers and scrolls of excellent quality, paintings and other
 treasures.  This is where the renowned Jung Pao Chai
 (the Studio of Glorious Treasure) is to be found.  This
 studio .has been established for two hundred years; this is
 where the facsimiles of Chinese ink-and-water colour
 paintings are produced.  During the Lunar New Year

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Festival, there is a two-week fair in Liu Li Chang, where
 they sell toys, kites, paper-cuts and so on, and where the
 jade market is open.
 Let us turn back to Chien Men Street, and go south
 again, till we reach Tien Chiao (the Bridge of Heaven).
 There is no bridge to be seen now although there was one
 formerly.  It is now a popular market and the amusement
 centre for the -working people.  Today the Tien Chiao dis-
 trict includes the area west of the Temple of Heaven and
 north of the Temple of Agriculture.
 The centre of Tien Chiao is called the "Fair Market,"
 -where country folk sell their wares and buy what they
 need from town.  Every day large amounts of grain,
 timber, eggs, vegetables, raw tobacco and cattle change
 hands.  Since liberation a state department store and a
 modern theatre (The Tien Chiao) have been established
 there.
 As we walk towards Yung Ting Men, down the street
 of the same name, we find on our right the Temple of
 Agriculture, near which is the People's Stadium, and on
 our left the Temple of Heaven.
 At the end of the Yung Ting Men Street is Yung Ting
 Men itself, the central south gate of the Outer City. Until
 we pass through it, we are still in the Outer City of Peking,
 though we have walked quite' a long way.  Nowadays
 though, the municipality has spread beyond the walls.
 Like nearly everywhere in Peking, the whole of this area
 changes its appearance almost daily.
 3. THE WORKING PEOPLE'S PALACE OF CULTURE
 The Working People's Palace adjoins Tien An Men on
 the east.  Once this building was the Imperial Ancestral
 Temple, where the tablets of the emperors were displayed.
 But on May Day, 1950, it was opened as the Working
 People's Palace of Culture.  Thus from being a place of
 sacrifice to the ancestors of,the feudal rulers, it has be-
 come a place for the working people, where they can savour
 life ever more fully in all its richness.
 A tablet inscribed with the words "Peking Working
 People's Palace of Culture" copied from Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung's' handwriting, hangs over the entrance gate. We
 pass through a grove of deep green, sturdy ancient trees
 to three main halls straight in front of us, flanked by
 side-halls and verandas.  The hall in front, like the Hall
 of Supreme Harmony in the Imperial Palaces in style, is
 built in three stonework tiers, each with double eaves. On
 either side are two rows of verandas surrounding a vast
 courtyard big enough to hold ten thousand.
 Large exhibitions are frequently held in the three halls.
 There have been exhibitions of the Movement to Resist
 American Aggression and Aid Korea, Sino-Soviet Friend-
 ship, the History of the Workers' Movement in China,
 Advanced Methods of Production, Railways, Petroleum,
 Coal Mines, Theatrical Art, Folk Arts, and so on, and ex-
 hibitions introducing the achievements of the Soviet
 Union, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam; the German Democratic Republic,
 Poland, Bulgaria, the Democratic People's Republic of
 Korea, India and Indonesia.  The working people love to
 go to their own palace of culture, where they can visit the
 exhibitions, the library, the sports ground, the entertain-
 ment hall and the theatre.
 Of course, there are other things as well for them to
 enjoy in their own palace. Lectures on science, literature,
 art, and so on are frequently held and reports given by
 nationally known heroes of labour.  A spare-time school
 has also been established here with five sections: literature,
 drama, music, fine arts; and dancing.  Here we find as
 well the home of the amateur art groups, who go in for

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 dancing, orchestral music and choral singing.  And from
 here, any worker who is discovered to have special artis-
 tic talent may be sent to a specialized school for further
 study.
 In the northeast corner is a sports ground which can
 accommodate over 4,000 spectators.  It has a large flood-
 lit volleyball and basketball court.                        In a grove in the
 southeast corner is a large open space for dancing with
 a smooth cement floor and a stage. What used to be waste
 lands, overgrown with weeds and bushes, are now beautiful
 grounds.
 Intact, a unique architectural group, the Imperial
 Palaces stand in the heart of Peking, their golden roofs,
 white marble balustrades and red pillars shining in the
 sun - five hundred and thirty years old.  It is surrounded
 by a moat and walls, with a tower on each of the four
 corners.  There are four gate-guarded entrances, one in
 each wall: Wu Men (Meridian Gate) in the centre of the
 south wall, Shen Wu Men (Gate of Godly Prowess) in the
 north wall, and Tung Hua Men and Hsi Hua Men (the East
 and West Flowery Gates) on the other two, as their names
 imply.
 The Imperial Palaces consist of Outer Throne Halls and
 an Inner Court, the Inner being to the north. This is
 typical of all old Chinese architectural planning.  The
 front gate, the Outer City, and so on-is always the south-
 ern entrance or section.
 Let us enter the Imperial Palaces through one of the
 three tunnel gates of the Meridian Gate.  Before us lies
 a great courtyard, beyond five marble bridges.      Pass
 through a gate at the other side of the courtyard and we
 are before a massive double-tiered hall, Tai Ho Tien (Hall
 of Supreme Harmony), once the Throne Hall.  A marble
 terrace above marble balustrades runs round it, with
 beautiful ancient bronzes standing on it: cauldrons, cranes,
 turtles, compasses and ancient measuring instruments.
 -The Hall of Supreme Harmony is the largest wooden struc-
 ture in China.
 Behind it, beyond another courtyard, is Chung Ho Tien
 (Hall of Complete Harmony).  This was where the em-
 peror paused to rest before going into the Throne Room,
 and beyond it is the last hall, Pao Ho Tien (Hall of
 Preserving Harmony), after which we reach the Inner
 Court.
 The Inner Court was used as the emperor's personal
 apartments.  There are three large halls, Chien Ching
 Kung (Palace of Heavenly Purity), Chiao Tai Tien (Hall
 of Heavenly and Earthly Intercourse) and Kun Ning Kung
 (Palace of Earthly Tranquillity). The Palace of Heavenly
 Purity is divided into three parts.  The central part was
 used for family feasts and family audiences, audiences for
 foreign envoys, and funeral services; the right (or east)
 section used for mourning rites; and the west section for
 business of state.  The other two palaces, one behind the
 other, were imperial family residences.  The three throne
 halls in the Outer Court, and the_ three main halls in the
 Inner Court lie along the central axis.  On either side are
 smaller palaces, with their own courtyards and auxiliary
 buildings.  And behind the buildings, before the back
 (north) gate of the Imperial Palaces is reached, lies the
 Imperial Garden.   Each palace, its courtyard and side-
 halls, is an architectural whole.  The skill of the builders,
 artists and architects who planned and executed these
 wonderful buildings is manifest.  The Imperial Palaces
 are of supreme historical aiid artistic interest.
 Today the Imperial Palaces are used as museums-the
 Historical Museum and the Palace Museum. The Historical

 Museum is near the south entrance-in the tower over the
 -- Meridian Gate and its side-halls.  It' is devoted to displays
 of historical material, ancient architectural sketches and
 models, and special exhibitions on relevant subjects.
 The Palace Museum is far larger, housed as it is in
 the remainder of this great court city.  Some of the halls
 are kept as they were in imperial times-a museum in
 themselves-and others for the display of some of the
 countless treasures from China's past.   There should be
 far more of the latter, but looting and corruption have
 ,robbed China of much of her rightful heritage.  The
 Eight-Power occupation of 1900, when their soldiers and
 officers vied with each other in plunder and destruction,
 was only one major theft.  The deposed emperor, after
 the fall of the last dynasty in 1911, sold, mortgaged, or
 gave away as bribes many treasures.  The warlords did
 not neglect their chance, and both before and after the
 Japanese occupation, the Kuomintang stole indiscriminate-
 ly.  During the Japanese occupation the Japanese ' troops
 looted freely, and just before liberation the Kuomintang
 did their best to take away as much treasure as they could.
 In fact, they had thirteen thousand chestfuls ready pack-
 ed, intending to ship them to Taiwan.  Fortunately, the
 speed of liberation prevented them from carrying out
 their full plan, and only a couple of thousand 'chests were
 got away.
 So rich were the Palaces, however, so great, in fact,
 had been the wealth ground out of the people for hundreds
 of years, that much remains to be seen there.  Recently,
 moreover, a hall has been set aside for exhibiting new
 finds.  There is also a hall set aside to display gifts from
 friends in other countries-the Hall of International
 Friendship-acid a permanent exhibition of porcelain, pot-
 tery and paintings.
 5.  PLEASURE GROUNDS
 Peking is bejewelled with delightful parks and pleasure
 grounds, each with its own distinctive features-the an-
 cient cypresses and flowers in the Chungshan Park (Sun
 Yat-sen Park), the great lake after which Peihai Par1Q
 is called, the pavilions high up on Coal Hill, the beautifully.
 laid out lakes and hills in the Summer Palace and its
 finely built halls and pavilions, and the rare animals and
 birds in the Zoo.  These parks-flowers and trees, foun-
 tains and rocks, buildings and paths-are each designed
 as a whole, while each individual section has a complete
 unity.  The Chinese art of creating gardens is here ex-
 emplified.  The deep-blue, umbrella-shaped Hall of Prayer
 for Good Harvests and the intricately planned white
 marble Circular Mound Altar in the Temple of Heaven are
 spectacular examples of our national tradition in architec-
 ture.
 Since liberation the People's Government has not only
 restored the parks to their original beauty and more, but
 has created new ones, like Taojanting (Joyous Pavilion)
 Park and Lungtan (Dragon Pool) Park in the Outer City.
 Chungshan Park adjoins the west wall of Tien An Men.
 Formerly this area enclosed the Altar of Land and Grain
 where the emperors made offering to the gods of earth
 and agriculture.  In 1914 it was opened as a.public park.
 Indeed, with its old temples and altars shaded by dense
 groves of cypresses, it is ideal for this.
 It covers 60 acres.  The Altar of Land and Grain con-
 sists of a square terrace in the centre of the park, raised
 some four and a half' feet above the ground, and 54 foot
 square.  This flat surface is divided into four sections

 with a circle in the middle.  The four sections are fill
 ed
 with coloured earth, red, black, blue and white.  The mid.:
 dle circle where now a tall flagstaff stands is yellow. It
 is surrounded with low wall    .4
 s an  gates.  To its north is
 the Hall of Worship and the Halberd Gate.  The Hall of
 Worship is now the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, used for
 meetings, such as the Peking People's Congress.
 Built over 530 years ago, the Hall of Worship, to use
 its old name, is the oldest wooden structure in Peking.
 Its simple form. masterly design and sturdy woodwork is'",
 characteristic of early Ming architecture.
 The park is beautifully laid out.  Directly facing the
 main gate is a majestic white marble memorial arch on
 which is inscribed the characters "Defend World Peace."
 From the entrance run covered promenades, typical of
 Chinese layout.  To the east side the promenade runs to
 a tea house and restaurant, through cypress groves, rock
 gardens, flower beds, and tree-shaded pavilions like Sungpo

 up  to the water raviiion,
 built out over water on three sides.  This used to be a
 gathering place for scholars and poets, where they met to
 drink and feast.  Now it is used for exhibitions of various
 kinds. Here we follow the north promenade for some 800
 yards and find ourselves at Tang Hua Wu-a hot-house
 which displays tender plants in season-then at the Orchid
 Pavilion, where a stele inscribed with ancient calligraphy
 is kept, and then at a two-storeyed building, the Huei Ying
 Lou (Tower of Portraits).
 The surroundings here are particularly striking.  Scat-
 tered among pools, rocky hills, weeping willows, blue-green
 pines and cypresses, bamboos and rock gardens are pavi-
 lions, kiosks and towers.  Here a gently flowing stream
 chatters under a little wooden bridge, and there a winding
 path leads to a quiet retreat. This is typical. of classic
 Chinese landscape-gardening.
 North from here is the grove of cypresses round the
 Altar of Land and Grain. Altogether there must be close
 on a thousand cypresses in Chungshan Park, planted for
 the most part in the early Ming dynasty.  To the north,
 along the bank of the palace moat, we see, above the
 cypresses, the towering edifices of the Imperial Palaces
 and the corner towers of the Forbidden City.
 Flowers and trees here are in many-varieties and the
 colours change with the seasons.  In the spring, lilac,
 peach and apricot blossoms greet you as you come in by
 the south gate.  In early summer the park is lovely with
 its herbaceous and tree peonies and roses.  The lotus
 flowers in front of the Tang Hua Wu have scarcely faded
 before the cassia flowers, and they are succeeded by gay
 scarlet salvias. The chrysanthemums of autumn finish
 the flowering season in a blaze of colour.
 This park is also famous for its goldfish. Along the
 west covered promenade is a goldfish enclosure, with a
 great variety of goldfish in great tubs, some of'them very
 rare kinds, like the "Dragon Eyes," "Pompons," "Tiger
 Heads," "Toad Heads," "Gazing Up to Heaven," "Turned
 Up Gills," and "Pearl."  This collection is very popular,
 and no visitor can resist lingering here.

 PEIHAI PARK
 Peihai Park (the North Sea Park) lies to the northwest
 of the Forbidden City.  It covers some 176 acres, half
 of it water-a striking thing even for a city which is unique
 in:so many ways.  It is part of a chain of lakes which lie
 across the west side of the city running roughly north and
 ? south.  Peihai itself is the most northerly of the three
 lakes which lie within the Imperial City.
 The existence of pleasure grounds, lakes and buildings
 on this site goes back eight hundred years.  There have
 always been pools and swamps here, but detailed records
 exist of their being cleared and deepened and palaces being
 built from 1150 onward.  At the end of the twelfth century,
 the Golden Tartars had their pleasure grounds here.  In
 the thirteenth century the Mongol rulers, while building
 Tatu, their capital, put up palace halls by this very lake.
 In 1651, a Manchu emperor built the White Dagoba on the
 top of the hill on the ruins of a Ming dynasty structure.
 The Round City-a striking group of buildings-stands
 just to the left of the main entrance to Peihai Park.  As
 you enter the Round City and walk up the steps to the
 courtyard, you find, in front of the main hall, a great bowl
 made out of a single piece of jade, carved with dragons and
 waves, a relic of the Yuan dynasty.  In the main hall,
 there is another beautiful thing, a Jade Buddha, also carved
 from a single piece of jade.
 Peihai is an ideal pleasure ground. As-the lakes were
 deepened and dredged, the excavated earth was used to
 build hillocks and islands of great beauty.  The Chinese
 characters translated here as landscape mean, literally, hill
 and water, and here we see illustration after illustration of
 this Chinese art.
 Many of the buildings are used for serious pursuits as
 well as recreation.  There is a Pioneer Club, an Institute
 of Research into the History of Chinese Classical Litera-
 ture, a Popular Museum of Natural History, and a branch
 of the National Library in the erstwhile imperial temples
 and palaces, and some of the other buildings are used for
 exhibitions.
 Until 1925 these beautiful grounds were not open to
 the public at all, but even after that-until liberation in
 fact-they were still left to fall into a sad state of decay.
 At the time of liberation, the lake was a stagnant pool, and
 all the channels were blocked.  But in 1950 the Peking
 Municipal People's Government had the lake cleared out,
 and the drainage system opened.  Repairs and redecora-
 tions have gone on steadily and the grounds have been prop-
 erly cared for and where necessary replanted.
 Of course, the spacious grounds, the beauty of the sur-
 roundings, the lake itself, which is crowded with rowing
 boats in summer and a natural skating rink in winter, is
 greatly enjoyed by all Peking.  The many restaurants and
 tea houses are crowded in the summer evenings and on
 Sundays.  For hundreds of years the working people of
 China have laboured with their hands and brains to create
 this beauty.  Now they have entered into full enjoyment
 of their heritage.
 COAL HILL PARK
 Ching Shan, from which the park takes its name, is a
 man-made hill, over a mile in circumference. The hill has
 five ridges, with a pavilion on each, the largest being. the
 one on the 196-foot ridge.  The hill is part of the plan of
 the old imperial city, and as such naturally contains much
 of historic interest.  From the top of this hill you see a
 magnificent panorama of Peking-not only the Imperial
 Palaces, and the walls of the Inner City, but the new sky-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 line of Peking within and without the walls. Ching Shan,
 strictly speaking Prospect Hill, is popularly known as Mei
 Shan-Coal Hill.  The reason for this is not clear, though
 tradition has it that this was where the emperors stored
 coal for use in case of siege.  It seems probable, though,
 that the mass of the hill was made from the silt dug from
 the beds of the artificial lakes and moats.  There is one
 episode which took place here which is worthy of mention,
 illustrating, as it does, the past feudal days.  In 1644, at
 the end of the Ming dynasty, the peasant leader Li Tse-
 cheng fought his way into Peking, and the defeated Ming
 emperor hanged himself on a locust-tree on the east, slope
 of the hill.  The tree is there to this day amid the ancient
 pines and cypresses.
 One of the halls to the north-Shou Huang Tien (Hall
 of the Aged Sovereign) now belongs to Peking's chil-
 dren-it is the Peking Children's Palace.  The children
 may go in for whatever activity suits their individual taste,
 but they have a wide choice-from reading, sports, get-
 together parties, camp fires, acting, camping or hiking, to
 science and art. Their own productions are regularly ex-
 hibited.  They plan to have their own garden for flowers
 and trees and farm crops, so that they can try their hand
 at experimental grafting plant breeding, and so on.
 Tien Tan Park (Temple of Heaven), where once the em-
 perors offered sacrifices to the gods of heaven, is now open
 to the public as a park.  It is the biggest park in Peking,
 565 acres in extent.  Within double walls are the famous
 temple buildings.   Flanking the approaches and between
 the red walls are 5,000 cypresses.  The main buildings in-
 the inner altar space-Chi Nien Tien (Hall of Prayer for
 Good Harvests), Huang Chiu Yu (Imperial Vault of Heav-
 en), and Huan Chiu Tan (Circular Mound Altar) are all
 circular, and were designed according to the ancient belief
 that the heavens are round and the earth square.  They
 present a spectacle of unique beauty.
 The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is built on a
 triple-tiered circular stone terrace called Pray-for-Grain
 Altar.  Each ring is balustraded in white marble. The
 roof has three layers of eaves with blue glazed tiles, which
 symbolize the sky, and the topmost one is crowned with a
 golden ball.  The whole is supported on massive pillars
 with open lattice-work doors and no outer walls.  The four
 central columns, dragon-carved, stand for the four seasons.
 Then there are two rings of twelve columns each, the inner
 ring symbolizing the twelve months and the outer ring the
 twelve divisions of the day and night.
 The Imperial Vault of Heaven is a small circular temple,
 with only one layer of eaves.  The entrance to it is through
 a round enclosure with a thick wall, known as "the Echo
 Wall.  It has the peculiar quality that a mere whisper close
 to it can be heard distinctly at any other point on the wall.
 Three steps from the bottom of the flight of steps which lead
 down from the temple is a stone called the "Triple-Sound-
 of-Voice Stone."  Stand on that piece of stone and shout.
 There will be three echoes one after another.  Thus, 200
 years ago, our builders and architects were well aware of
 the nature of sound waves.
 The Circular Mound Altar, three concentric marble ter-
 races, lies open to the sky.  The inner circle is 17.8 feet
 above ground level and 98.4 feet in diameter.  The middle
 terrace is 164 feet across, and the lowest terrace 230.  All
 three terraces are bordered with carved marble balustrades.
 There are altogether 360 pillars in the balustrades, symbo-
 lizing the degrees in the celestial circle.  In the centre of
 the upper terrace is a round stone, surrounded by concen-
 tric rings of stones, the number increasing as the circles

 fan out.  The numbers of these stones correspond to the
 "heavenly numbers" of one, three, five, seven, nine and
 their multiples.  Call it superstitious if you like, but the
 architectural design, and its execution, is a wonderful monu-
 ment to the architectural genius of our ancestors.
 The Temple of Heaven was first planned and built 500
 years ago.  In structure and design its beauty and splendour
 is famed throughout the world.  The blue tiled roof of
 the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests will never be for-
 gotten by those who see it.
 THE SUMMER PALACE
 Lying close to the Western Hills, Yi Ho Yuan (the
 Summer Palace) is about six miles N.N.W. of Hsi Chili
 Men (the West Straight Gate), the nearest city gate.  It
 is the largest park in the outskirts of Peking, perhaps un-
 rivalled in the world for its mastery of artificial landscap-
 ing and its inimitable blend of woods, water, hills, and
 architecture.  It is impossible to guess where nature be-
 gins an(] man ends in its deliberate imitation of the wonders
 of hills and gardens famous elsewhere throughout the coun-
 try.                     Yet it retains its own soul and style, despite its
 miniatures, of other renowned beauty spots. The whole is
 gracefully interwoven with the natural beauties of the
 Western Hills which back it.  Going along the road to the
 Summer Palace, you see Wan Shou Shan (Longevity Hill),
 Fu Hsiang Igo (Pavilion of the Fragrance of God) and
 the other buildings embowered among the woods of the
 Summer Palace, apparently one with the towering pagoda
 on the top of the Jade Spring Hill to the northwest and
 the misty ridges and peaks which fade away in the dis-
 tance.
 The Summer Palace Park covers altogether 823 acres,
 four-fifths of which are lake, the remainder being man-made
 hillocks.  More than a hundred buildings-halls, towers,
 pavilions, bridges and pagodas-lie scattered throughout
 the park.  The park can be considered as falling into four
 sections-the erstwhile imperial living quarters and the
 court buildings, the spectacular architectural design lead-
 ing up to Chih Hui Hai (Sea of Wisdom Temple) on the
 highest point, the ruins of the old palace and the landscaped
 stream at the back of the hill, and the lake and its imme-
 diate surroundings.
 Immediately on entering the east palace gate we see
 three groups of buildings which we approach through
 courtyards-Lo Shou Tang (Hall of Delight in Longevity),
 Teh Ho Yuan (Hall of -Virtuous Harmony), the old Em-
 press's theatre and stage, and Jen Shou Tien (Hall of
 Benevolence and Longevity).   Where once the extreme
 formality and excesses of feudal, rule held sway, the peo-
 ple now enjoy their freedom-Hall of Benevolence and
 Longevity and Hall of Delight in Longevity are now used
 for exhibitions, and Hall of Virtuous Harmony is a rest
 home for honoured workers.  .              ,
 Connecting the buildings and courts, from the east
 palace gates, all along the shore of the lake up to the
 Marble Boat-the empress's specious excuse for appro-
 priating the naval funds in order to build the Summer
 Palace-are a series of covered promenades, richly paint-
 ed.                                                                                   The paintings, which are of scenes at the Summer
 Palace itself, are the work of artisan painters, not artists
 as such.  They have a charm of their own.  To the right
 is the architectural section. Stroll along the promenades,
 past Pai Yun Tien (Palace That Towers into the Clouds),
 and then turn right, _ up and up through stone stairways,
 until you reach Sea of Wisdom Temple on the summit of
 the hill. This stands out-topping the courts and stairways
 below, surrounded by a rose-pink wall, the typical north-
 south axis being maintained from the temple' down to the
 memorial arch by the lake.  A magnificent view lies be-

 fore us.  Directly in front lie the placid waters of the
 lake, in summer dotted with rowing boats, covered pleasure
 boats and bathers.  To the right are the misty Western
 Hills, and to the front and left lies the plain, with Peking
 --clearly visible.
 Turn north now, and go strolling down the hill to the
 -back.  Here the whole atmosphere changes.  Around are
 the ruins of the buildings burnt down by the Anglo-French
 -forces in 1860-among shrubs, trees and wild flowers. At
 -the foot of the hill runs a stream, which widens as it runs
 round to connect with the lake.  Tall trees and rocks sur-
 round the narrow paths along the banks.                               This is an
 _imitation of beauty spots south of the Yangtse.
 As we round the curve of the hill, following the stream,
 we come to Hsieh Chu Yuan (Garden of Harmonious In-
 terest).  Pink lotus glows in the pond, wistaria casts its
 purple blossoms over pavilions standing over the gently
 flowing water, and bamboos wave among artistically group-
 ed rocks.  This. is a typical Chinese landscape painting
 come to life-modelled after the scenery of the Chi Chang
 Garden on Hui Hill in Wusih, Kiangsu Province.
 We reach the lakeside again.  All round the edge is an
 embankment.  There are islands, large and small, and the
 Seventeen Arch Bridge-an outstandingly beautiful struc-
 ture, even among so many beauties.  The embankment
 and the six bridges-copied from a famous beauty spot by
 the West Lake in Hangchow-delight the eye.
 Today, as we see Peking families enjoying the delights
 of this fairyland, and visitors from all over China-and
 indeed the world-strolling and refreshing themselves with
 the beauty created by the toil of Chinese artists and work-
 ing people, we cannot but muse on the past, and be thank-
 ful for the present.  What man had made for the pleasure
 of the few-the feudal rulers-what imperialist aggression
 had destroyed and looted has now returned to its makers.
 Id
 PEKING ZOO
 The Zoo is in the former West Suburb Park, about
 half a mile outside Hsi Chih Men, the same gate which
 leads, to the Summer Palace.  The total area of the park
 is 175 acres.
 The park was variously used by the imperial rulers for
 gardens and temples.  In the last dynasty, the old em-
 press made a _ zoo here and hopefully named it the Garden
 of Ten Thousand Lives.  She also ordered that part of
 it should be used for farming, and bestowed the grandil-
 oquent name of the Experimental Farm upon it.
 But at the time of liberation it belied its name. There
 had never been ten thousand animals there, but in 1949
 there were only a dozen or so starved monkeys, two par-
 rots and a one-eyed ostrich left.  Now it is very different.
 It is the largest zoo in the country, with over a thousand
 animals-lions, elephants, Manchurian tigers, a Sinkiang
 lynx, deer, a black swan, alligators, and so on.  Last year
 the Zoo was further enriched by three giant pandas. Many
 of the animals have been collected within China's wide
 borders, but some are gifts from, or acquired by exchange
 with, other countries.
 Among the animals foreign to China are the polar
 bears, Arctic foxes and Saiga antelopes from the Soviet
 Union, the Indian humped cattle (the gift of the Leipzig
 Zoo) and the Shetland ponies and kangaroos from Aus-
 tralia.  One of the four elephants was presented to the
 children of China by Mr. Nehru, the Indian Prime Minister.
 Two others were a present to Chairman Mao from the
 Vietnam-China Friendship Association, and the fourth is
 a gift from Burma.   -
 The Zoo proper does not occupy the whole park.  There
 are gardens and nursery gardens, orchards and farmland
 to be seen as well.  Towers and pavilions stand amidst

 trees and lawns.  It is a most pleasant place to wander
 in, and is, in fact, crowded 'particularly on holidays and
 Sundays.
 6. PLACES OF WORSHIP
 Peking has many religious buildings-Buddhist tem-
 ples, lamaseries, mosques, and Christian churches-so
 many that we can describe only a few.
 Kuang Chi Sze (Temple of Broad Charity) is a Bud-
 dhist temple on the Yang Shih Ta Chieh (Sheep Market
 Street) near the Hsi Sze Pailou crossroads.  Built in the
 twelfth century, and repaired in the middle of the fifteenth,
 it subsequently fell into decay and rose again several
 times. Twenty years ago it was damaged by fire and re-
 built.  Since liberation it has been extensively repaired
 and repainted.  Now it is the religious centre for Bud-
 dhists in Peking.  The All-China Buddhist Association has
 its offices there.
 Wide, quiet courtyards lead to the temple, and the
 main hall is surrounded by cloisters. Over 100,000 volumes
 of Buddhist scriptures and relics of Buddha and sutras-
 the latter, gifts from Ceylon-are kept here.
 This Buddhist lamasery, the largest in Peking, lies in
 the northeast corner of the Inner City and runs right up
 to the wall of that side.  It was originally the residence
 of Emperor Yung Cheng before his accession in 1723.  It
 was given the name Yung Ho Kung (Temple of Harmony
 and Peace) in 1725 and converted into a Lama Temple in
 17114.  The lamas there are mostly Mongols and Tibetans.
 The first thing you see on entering the temple is a
 stone arch.  Further on, through two gates, is a beautiful
 quiet courtyard, shaded by old cypresses and deep-green
 pine trees.  Turning north you see three spacious court-
 yards leading through five main halls.  The first has the
 same name as the temple itself, Yung Ho Kung, inscribed
 over the entrance in four languages-Chinese, Manchu,
 Mongolian and Tibetan.  The second, called Fa Lun Tien
 (Hall of the Wheel of Life), is surrounded by side-halls
 and has five small pavilions, each topped with a small
 pagoda, rising from gold-tiled roofs.  In this hall, which
 is used for chanting the sutras, beautiful paintings and
 murals glitter on inside walls.  The third hall is Wan Fu
 Lou (Tower of Ten Thousand Buddhas), with pavilions
 on either side, connected to the main hall by overhead
 bridges.  In it is a gigantic figure of Maitreya, the Buddha
 of Resurrection, in sandalwood, carved from a single tree-
 trunk, over 551/ feet high and almost touching the ceiling.
 On the second and third storeys around this giant figure
 are shrines with more than ten thousand images of Buddha
 -hence, the name.  The other two halls are Yung Kang
 Ko (Pavilion of Eternal Health) and Yen Sui Ko (Pavilion
 of Lasting Tranquillity).
 The halls in the temple had been allowed to decay in
 the past. Since liberation they have been repaired by the
 government and redecorated, until today the temple
 reassumes its magnificence.
 Tung Chiao Sze (Temple of General Teaching) is a
 famous Buddhist nunnery in Peking.  It lies just inside
 Tung Chili Men (the East Straight Gate) of the Inner
 City.  The original building dates back to the sixteenth
 century but the buildings as they now stand were put up

 in 1942, and in 1953 the People's Government allotted funds
 for the building of new side-halls.
 THE MOSQUE ON NIU CHIEH
 The Mosque on Niu Chieh (Ox Street) inside the south-
 west gate of the Outer City is the largest and oldest of
 the mosques in Peking.  This mosque was built in the
 eleventh century, during the Northern Sung dynasty, and
 the six paintings in the main hall date from then.  Rows.-
 of pillars divide the main hall into naves, and at the fur-
 thest end from the entrance is the pulpit- As the faithful
 enters the hall he faces the direction of Mecca-  Outside
 the hall are two towers, one at each end.  The one in
 front is where the faithful are called to prayer by the
 Muezzin.  In a corner of the courtyard are some ancient
 tombs of followers of the Moslem faith-the oldest dating
 back to the thirteenth century.
 The area around this mosque is largely inhabited by
 Huis-a national minority who follow the Islamic faith-
 and the People's Government has now built a special school
 and a hospital for them in the district.
 Among the mosques in Peking, another, the Mosque in
 Tung Sze district, is as famous and revered as the Ox
 Street Mosque.
 NORTH C_kTHEDs_-%L
 Pei Tang (North Cathedral), situated in Hsisblhku
 Lane, Hsi Ali Men Street, west city, is one ,of the famous
 ,Catholic places of worship in Peking:
 The Cathedral is a Gothic structure deliberately rem-
 iniscent of -Notre Dame,  The front facade has statues
 of t e Four Evangelists, and on the tops of the bell towers
 en either side stand St, Gabriel and St. Raphael in stone.
 The interior is in the normal Catholic tmdltion, i-ith a
 high altar and nine side-altars.  It is a large building and
 can hold over a thousand.  The Cathedral is fully. open
 for services.
 THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH AT TENGSHIHKOU
 (LANTERN MARKET)
 The church, in the Gothic style; stands in a tree-lined
 spacious square, an oasis of quiet amidst the bustle of a
 busy district.  The building dates from 1902.  The in-
 terior, also Gothic, has a central aisle and two transepts,
 with eighteen arches each side of the aisle and a wooden
 Gothic roof.  The church can hold a congregation of 800,
 and there is also a vestry which seats 200.
 THE ASBURY METHODIST CHURCH
 Built in 1904, this church is in the southeast corner of
 the Inner City, just inside Chung Wen Men.  It is a large
 wooden structure, with an interesting wood-panelled octag-
 onal interior and a capacity of 1,000-it is often filled.
 THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF OUR SAVIOUR
 This church is known to the people of Peking as Chung
 Hua Sheng Kung Hui Cathedral-it belongs to the Angli-
 can Communion.  It is in the southwest corner of the
 Inner City close to Hsuan Wu Men, a gate in the Inner
 City wall.  It is a wooden structure, tastefully designed,
 for a congregation of 400.
 There are many other churches in Peking with well
 attended services.
 7.  OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS
 Peking and its environs abound in reminders, of his-
 tory, in sites of ancient cities, pagodas, temples and gar-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 dens.  The earth mound walls outside Teh Sheng Men,
 the northwest gate of the Inner City, are the remains of
 Tafu, Kublai Khan's capital. Three of four more famous
 pagodas in China are near the city-Hsi Huang Sze (the
 West Yellow Temple), Wu Ta Sze (Five Pagoda Temple).,
 and Pi Yun Sze (Temple of Azure Clouds). In form these
 pagodas are in the Indian style, but certain points of con-
 struction and decoration are characteristic of Chinese
 architecture.  There is another, the octagonal, thirteen-
 storeyed pagoda in Tien Ning Sze (Temple of Heavenly
 Tranquillity), outside the west gate of the Outer City,
 which is the oldest rind best preserved temple of Peking.
 It stands as a monument to the talents of the Chitan work-
 ing people and the Han craftsmen of the eleventh century.
 The big bronze bell in Ta Chung Sze (Great Bell Temple),
 west of Peking, was forged in the early fifteenth century.
 It, is 23.6 feet high, 11.3 feet in diameter and 7 inches
 thick.  The hook by which the bell is hung is over seven
 feet high, and the whole weighs 53 tons.
 When the Manchu dynasty was at its zenith, a number
 of palaces and gardens sprang up on the we?tern outskirts
 of Peking.  Between where the Summer Palace stands to-
 day and Hsiang Shan (Fragrance Hill) were three famous
 hills-Fragrance Hill, Jade Spring Hill and Longevity Hill
 -and five palaces including the Old Summer Palace; But
 the latter were all destroyed by the Anglo-French forces
 and the combined forces of the eight powers.  Then there
 are the Ming Tombs, a short train or car ride away, and
 the Great Wall of China.
 JADE SPRING HILL, TEMPLE OF THE SLEEPING
 BUDDHA AND TEMPLE OF AZURE CLOUDS
 Jade Spring Hill lies just over a mile west of the Sum-
 mer Palace.                              As early as the twelfth century the Golden
 Tartars had a pleasure palace here, and from the Yuan
 dynasty onwards the emperors and empresses visited it
 frequently.  It is a famous spring, with sweet and pure
 water, and an important source of Peking's water supply.
 There are several beautiful pagodas on the hill, such
 as Yu Feng Ta (Jade Peak Pagoda), Liu Li Ta (Glazed
 Pagoda) and Miao Kao Ta (Wonderfully High Pagoda).
 The latter stands like an awl piercing the sky, and is
 sometimes called the Awl Pagoda.  It is a landmark on
 the road to the Western Hills.
 The Temple of the Sleeping Buddha lies on the slope
 of a hill just over three miles northwest of Jade Spring
 Hill.  It was built on a site where a Tang temple stood
 in the seventh century.  In the fourteenth century, the
 temple site was enlarged and the temple rebuilt.  Two
 hundred and fifty tons of bronze were used to cast a
 twenty-foot high sublimely peaceful Buddha.   About a
 mile beyond this temple is a beauty spot-Chou Garden-
 and further on tall trees surrounding a crystal brook which
 runs through rocks of all shapes.
 Just a mile southwest of this temple is the Temple of
 Azure Clouds, on the east slope' of Fragrance Hill, the
 largest of this group of temples.  Originally a monastery
 built in the fourteenth century, it was enlarged and made
 into a temple during the Ming dynasty in the early six-
 teenth century.  In the eighteenth century the Manchu
 Emperor Chien -Lung built a stupa behind it.  The temple
 buildings, courts and steps run straight up the hill.  Near
 the top of the hill is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, where
 his body rested for four years before it was moved to the
 mausoleum at Nanking. The glass coffin presented by the
 Soviet Union is placed by the side of his bust.  On the
 left of this hall is a spring surrounded by ancient trees,
 and on the right is the Hall of Five Hundred Arhats.  Be-
 hind this hall, standing among the deep-green foliage of

 ancient trees, is the stupa, with seven small pagodas on
 it.  Here are kept some personal belongings of Sun Yat-
 sen.
 From the time Peking again became the capital in 1420
 until the end of the Ming dynasty, there were fourteen
 Ming emperors.  Thirteen of them are buried in Tien Shou
 Shan (Heavenly Age Hill), some 20 miles N.N.W. of
 Peking.  The tombs lie within a radius of 25 miles, scat-
 tered in a natural amphitheatre, surrounded by serrated
 mountains and valleys which are threaded with meander-
 ing streams. The surroundings are magnificent.
 The thirteen tombs were all built in roughly the same
 style, but vary in size-the tombs of Emperor Cheng Chu
 and Emperor Shih Chung being the biggest.  Leading to
 the Cheng Chu tomb is a long avenue with a wealth of
 stone bridges, monoliths, archways, pillars, and the famous
 pairs of stone animals and court attendants. Across several
 stone bridges is a great hall where sacrifices were offered,
 and behind it are more stone archways, monoliths and
 stone terraces.  Finally the tomb itself is reached amidst
 pines and cedars.
 THE GREAT WALL, CHUYUNGKUAN PASS AND
 PATALING HILLS
 The Great Wall is one of the world's architectural mar-
 vels. It stretches from Shanhaikuan on the Gulf of Pohai
 to Chiayukuan, in Kansu-a distance of 1,684 miles.  It
 was first built during the period of the Warring States,
 that is, between. the fifth and third centuries B.C. At
 that time several states in north China built walls along
 their northern borders to keep out the Huns. - Then, after
 the Chin dynasty unified China in 221 B.C., these walls
 were joined up.  The Great Wall was repaired by succes-
 sive dynasties, but it was during the Ming dynasty in the
 fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that the most extensive
 repair work on the wall was done.  The Great Wall,- as
 we see it at present, is, by and large, Ming work.
 The Great Wall is 25 miles from Peking at its nearest
 point. Here following the strategically defensible heights
 of the Yenshan range, the wall was. an important outer
 defence line of the capital in the old days.
 Nowadays we can take the Peking-Paotow train,
 through the Nankou Pass, where the mountainous area
 begins and the train winds through valleys and tunnels
 for eleven miles, to Ching Lung Chiao (Green Dragon
 Bridge) Station, from which we can climb Pataling Hills
 and see the Great Wall.  Here it is 19 to 39 feet high,
 16 to 32 feet wide, made of stone at the base and brick-
 faced on the upper part.                                                                                         On the top of the Wall, parapets
 line the side facing outward and balustrades the other
 side, with beacon towers every 120 feet, where of old the
 alarm fires were lit.
 Chuyungkuan Pass lies between Nankou Pass and
 Green Dragon Bridge.  Surrounded by continuous moun-
 tain. ranges, it is an important pass through the Great
 Wall.  The Peking-Paotow Railway runs nearby-three
 miles away.  It seems astonishing that a railway could be
 built at all in such a mountainous area.  It was designed
 by our famous engineer Chan Tien-yu, who is commemorat-
 ed by a statue at the Green Dragon Bridge Station.
 MARCO POLO BRIDGE
 Lukouchiao (Marco Polo Bridge), across the Yungting
 River, is nine miles west of Kuang An Men, one of the
 western gates of the Outer City. Built during the Golden
 Tartar period in the twelfth century, it is mentioned by

 the Venetian traveller Marco Polo, so its fame has long
 been known to the outside world.  It was repaired during
 the Ming dynasty. in the fifteenth century.  It is built of
 white marble, and is 820 feet long and 26 feet wide, with
 11 arches.  The balustrades are made of 140 carved pil-
 lars, ehch topped with a carved stone lion holding cubs,
 no two the same.  The whole is a magnificent example of
 the level of artistic creation which our engineers, archi-
 tects and artisans had already attained so long ago.
 It was near this bridge that the Japanese imperialists
 launched their all-out war against China on July 7, 1937.
 The very name Lukouchiao now symbolizes the beginning
 of our War of Resistance to Japanese Aggression.
 CHAPTER IV
 MUNICIPAL CONSTRUCTION
 1. MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT
 Peking is the capital of the People's Republic of China.
 Because of its importance there is no governmental tier
 between it and the central government.  There are only
 two other such cities in China, Tientsin and Shanghai. All
 others are administratively part of the provinces or au-
 tonomous regions in which they are situated.  Peking is
 divided administratively into 13 districts-seven in the
 city proper and six on the outskirts, the latter being again
 divided into 95 townships.  It has an area of 1,264 square
 miles and a population of 3,280,000 at the end of 1955.
 The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic
 state led by the working class and based on an alliance
 of the workers and peasants.  All power belongs to the
 people, who exercise it through the National People's Con-
 gress and the local people's congresses.  What does this
 mean in practice?  Let us see how it worked out in Peking.
 Soon after Peking came under the people's rule, the
 Peking Military Control Committee and the People's Gov-
 ernment called together a broad cross-section of Peking
 citizens-representatives of the workers, university prof...
 essors, industrialists, business men and national minori-
 ties; to ask their advice and consult them on the problems
 that faced the city.  And in August 1949 six months after
 liberation, Peking's first'People's Representative Conference
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 was convened -a consultative conference to which 332
 people from different walks of life in Peking were invited.
 Three months later - less than a year after liberation -
 the second People's Representative Conference was held.
 This second conference was, for all practical purposes, a
 people's congress. This method continued until such time
 as elections could be held.  Up to August 1954 there were
 four such conferences, with twelve sessions in all.  The
 number attending increased every time from 332 at the
 first conference to 555 at the fourth, which meant that
 the Conference became more and more representative. It
 included workers, peasants, teachers, capitalists, people
 from government offices, the armed forces, public bodies,
 religious circles, as well as people belonging to the Com-
 munist Party and other democratic parties and democrats
 without party affiliation. The method by which representa-
 tives were chosen gradually changed, too.  For the first
 three conferences, only a few were actually elected by their
 respective organizations.  The majority were invited or
 selected, subject to the consent of their respective organ-
 izations.  But by the time of fourth conference, 83.7 per
 cent of the representatives were elected by the bodies they
 came from.  This laid a good foundation for going over
 to electing deputies to the people's congress by universal
 suffrage.
 These representative conferences accomplished a good
 deal in a few years.  The city's work in all its important
 aspects came under their purview and scrutiny, and the
 conferences made decisions. They played a very important
 part in getting the people of the city into action on the
 various social reforms, such as land reform on-the rural
 outskirts and the great health and hygiene drive.  After
 the state plan of economic construction,was launched, the
 conferences, at session after session, discussed how it ap-
 plied to Peking and what they had to do about it.

 The people's representative conference elected the mem-
 bers of the Peking Municipal People's Government (known
 as the Peking People's Council since autumn 1954) includ-
 ing the mayor and deputy mayors.  It saw to it that the
 municipal government carried out the decisions and resolu-
 tions of the conference; discussed and approved the esti-
 mates and examined the financial statements submitted
 by the municipal government; examined the report on its
 work, etc.  During its meetings and sessions, members of
 the conference showed themselves very much alive to their
 responsibilities as servants of the public.  Criticism was
 frank, suggestions were many and practical.        The con-
 ference certainly had a great influence in improving the
 work of the municipal government and raising the efficiency
 of the local government workers.
 These four years of practical democracy were extreme-
 ly useful.  Peking's people grew more and more confident
 in themselves, their political understanding improved, and
 with it their organizational ability.  The time was ready
 for the next stage-people's congresses elected by universal
 suffrage. Between June 1953 and March 1954 elections
 based on universal suffrage were held throughout Peking.
 Over 92 per cent of those eligible voted (non-voters in-
 cluded those away from the city at the time). People of
 all callings and Han and brother nationalities enthusiastic-
 ally took part in. their first real election.  Five hundred
 and sixty-four deputies to the first People's Congress of
 Peking Municipality were elected. The composition of the
 Congress was as follows :

 Among them (though not as such) were 106 women
 and 37 people from brother nationalities. Among the dep-
 uties there were 62 model workers.                                           Our democratic
 system, as may be seen, is not only broad-based but built
 on fraternal unity between all democratic classes and na-
 tionalities.
 It is laid down in the laws governing local government
 bodies that local people's congresses which meet twice a
 year are the organs of government authority in their
 respective areas and the local people's councils are the
 executive organs of local people's congresses. The present
 People's Council in Peking consists of 47 members, includ-
 ing the mayor and eight deputy mayors, who were elected
 by the Peking People's Congress in February 1955. They
 control 47 administrative and other units which cover all
 fields of life-health and sanitation, public security, educa-
 tion, employment, industry, etc.
 The People's Council has to carry out the decisions of
 the People's Congress, and take appropriate action on pro-
 posals brought up at Congress sessions. People's deputies
 make a tour of inspection twice a year to see how the
 People's Council actually operates and, if necessary, criti-
 cize and make suggestions.
 As mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter,
 Peking is divided into districts and townships in the ad-
 jacent countryside.  Each district and township has its
 own people's council.. Below the urban district comes a
 number of street offices-sub-offices, as they were, of the
 district people's council. Below them come residents' com-
 mittees-self-governing welfare organizations.  The resid-
 ents co-operate on matters of common interest, such as
 questions of local hygiene, culture and recreation, sports,
 studies in current events, literacy classes, etc.  These
 activities in citizenship help to increase understanding and
 co-operation among the residents themselves and ensure
 close contact between government and
 welding them together in a collective spirit~pThethere le
 say, and mean it, "We mans                         people
 our own               manage our own affairs; we run
 government !"
 2.  PUBLIC HYGIENE
 Since liberation the municipal authorities have not only
 forgedtaneouslyo ahdead with new building and layout, but simul-
 ne
 a tremendous job in improving the existing
 sanitation and the roads in and out of the city.  In doing
 this, they did more than rid the city of outright or poten-
 tial dangers to health.  They made beauty grow where
 before was dirt.
 Carts by the thousand carried away the refuse and
 filth which had been allowed to accumulate for years be-
 fore liberation, and the sewage system, such as it was,
 which had almost completely broken down, was overhaul-
 ed and made to work again or installed for the first time.
 Great pools of stagnant water, a direct danger to life,
 were drained.  Waste land and swamps are now lakes and
 parks.  How this change came about is a fascinating story
 in itself.
 Dragon Beard Ditch, which lies north, of the Temple of
 Heaven in the Outer City, had, with good reason, been

 municipal construction was to clear the lakes, rivers, canals
 and drainage systems.  Thanks to the energetic efforts of
 the public and the People's Liberation Army, the Lake of
 Ten Monasteries came to life again.  Along the shores
 stone embankments were built.  Flowers and plants now
 beautify the banks, and weeping willows throw their re-
 flection on crystal-clear, active water.                                                                                         In the distance, amidst mist and
 the Western Hills appear and disa
 clouds.  Now this place is ideal for stroll ng and boating.
 On its banks is now a new swimming pool and sports
 ground.  When it was opened in 1951, it occupied eight
 acres and was then the best equipped in the country. There
 are four pools, one deep, one shallow, one for children and
 a racing pool, with a pleasant sunbathing ground,
 and lawns.  There are reading' rooms, with newspapers
 and periodicals for spectators.  At the opening ceremony,
 the Mayor of Peking, Peng Chen, said:

 Peking,owjustweabhout as insalubrious as it could

 plete you will, in a small boat, be able to go,by water right
 through the city to the outskirts, from, say, the Peihai
 Park or the Lake of Ten Monasteries to the Summer
 Palace or the Joyous Pavilion Park in the Outer City.
 The Joyous Pavilion Park, west of the Temple of Agri-
 culture, is believed to have been the site of the eleventh
 century Temple of Mercy.  A pavilion was built here in the
 seventeenth century. There is nothing left of any of this
 save an old temple close by the city wall, in a district very
 sparsely populated.  In feudal days any place like this
 was deservedly popular, as most parks and palaces were
 closely guarded imperial preserves. To the Joyous Pavil-
 ion came scholars and their friends to drink wine and
 write or recite poetry.  They cherished this isolated but
 beautiful spot, surrounded as it was by weeds and marshes,
 as a "mountain forest in the city."
 But on the eve of liberation, it had become completely
 waste land-a dilapidated temple, with forgotten graves.
 Just a rubbish dump and stinking water pits. Few cared
 to visit such a place, whatever the "historical interest."
 Then came liberation.  The Peking municipal authorities,
 concerned with the people's health, took on the job of
 clearing it up and improving sanitation in the vicinity gen-
 erally. Draining of the marshy swamps began in the spring
 of 1952.  And what a transformation !  What were then
 muddy puddles are now lakes, 46 acres in all of water, with
 winding banks more than two miles round.  The Joyous
 Pavilion itself stands on a little peninsula. Around the
 lakes are-seven little artificially created hills made of earth
 from the lake-bed, varying in height from 16 to 33 feet
 from which you see across to the Inner City. The banks
 and hills have been planted with trees and flowers. Scat-
 tered round the park are pavilions and towers, terraces
 for open-air dancing and playgrounds foi children.
 A striking thing to be seen on the little peninsula is
 a number of archways, or pailou.  There used to be many
 of these typically Chinese arches. They stood the crossroads and important streets, but as modern t aflic
 increased, they led to accidents. Now they gain a new
 lease of life, and give colour to this new beauty spot.
 Tse Chu Yuan (Court of Purple Bamboo), about a mile
 west of the Zoo, has also been renovated, and its old lake
 dredged and restored, with all that that implies for the
 hygiene of the .neighbourhood. Years ago there was a lake
 here which served as a reservoir for the middle reaches of
 the Changho.  During the " Manchu dynasty, the Dowager
 Empress and Emperor ICuang Hsu used to rest here on
 their way to the Summer Palace along the Changho.  As
 the feudal regime declined, the Changho was graduall
 allowed to silt up, and all that remained was marshy s amps
 and rice fields. In dry seasons, when the lakes and water
 courses in the city were crying out for water, this lake
 absorbed too much and in rainy seasons it could not con-
 tain downpours and flooded the city.  It had long lost its
 value as a regulator of the Changho.
 But by the autumn of. 1953 the work of changing the
 rice fields and swamps back into a lake was virtually com-
 plete.                                                                                   A new lake came into being, about 33 acres of it.
 Five wooden bridges with railings painted in red, connect:
 the edges.  In the centre are two' islets, and they and the
 lake-sides have been planted with trees and flowers..  The
 Court of Purple Bamboo Lake is once again a reservoir
 and regulator for the Changho and is once more beautiful
 -but now it serves the people.     ?
 So, in improving Peking's hygiene, the city was made
 beautiful. The work still continues, but the worst jobs are
 finished-including the -last open . drain in the Inner City,
 which was made int
 o a covered sewer in April 1956.

 3.  DRAINAGE, LIGHT AND WATER
 Today you hardly think twice about talking of the clean
 streets, running water, drainage and electric lighting in
 Peking.  But before liberation it was a very different mat-
 ter.
 The old sewage system had 178 miles of piping; but
 at liberation, only 13 miles of it were working; the rest
 was, to put it mildly, "out of order."  During the rainy
 season many parts of the city were flooded. In the work-
 ing-class districts, where there was no drainage system
 at all, conditions were deplorable.
 Let us hear what an old resident has to say.  Lao Sheh,
 the playwright, reminisces, "In the days before libera-
 tion, the night was often spent in darkness.                               There was
 some electric lighting, but it was so dim that we might
 as well not have it.  And anyhow it was always failing
 for hours at a time ! Political darkness dimmed even the
 electric light.  The same thing happened with the water
 supply.  In summer, the source of supply dried up; people
 could hardly get any water to drink.  At other times those
 with power and influence could squander water to their
 heart's content, while where the poor lived there was never
 running water; they had to put up with dirty well-water.
 You could say there hadn't been any real improvement in
 the provision of water and light to this old city under
 reaction for seven hundred years."
 Since liberation the People's Government has system-
 atically dredged and overhauled the old drainage system.
 The work was practically finished by the end of 1953. It
 .meant clearing out and overhauling 165 miles of drains!
 Between 1949 and the' end of 1955, 180 miles of piping
 were laid so that by the end of 1955, 358 miles were in
 service-27 times as much as in the early days of libera-
 tion.  Anticipating further municipal development, we
 have now installed at key points a separate drainage
 system, in which rain water and sewage are carried by
 different sewers.
 The biggest engineering job was done near the Lake
 of Ten Monasteries, as that is where enormous quantity
 of rain water collect and have to be
 d of.  To
 this, mil reinforced concrete tunnel has begot en made.ne a do
 two    es of it, nine feet high, and 91/2           arly Ivide. the western outskirts, a sewage system, eightt miles to g,
 has been laid to serve the college and university sector.
 Improved drainage has not, of course, been confined to
 the main roads.  First consideration was given to work-
 ing-class districts, in what used to be regarded as far-
 away, forgotten places-like the Dragon Beard Ditch dis
 trict already mentioned.
 Electric light, too, has been brought to the people. Lao
 Sheh has something to say on this, too:            ?
 he says, "has brought light to men's eyes as well lasiheart'
 s
 When the Peking Power Plant came under new manage-*
 ment, the workers improved their skill and worked as
 never before, and now the electric light has come into its
 own.  The workers have taken a vow to see that there
 is no shortage or stoppage in power Supply.
 dear old city reveals its splendid beauty.    At night the
 golden tiles, the red walls and marble bridges The green and
 glimmer and
 glisten under brilliant lights.  Moreover, there is sufficient
 power to feed the factories, so that Peking is fast becom-
 ing a producer city as well." Translating Lao Shell's point
 into figures, in 1955 Peking was producing 272.78 per cent
 light and power compared with 1948.
 A piped water system was first introduced in Peking
 over' forty years, ago, but at liberation, in 1949, the 228
 .miles of water Piping served only 640,000
 People.
 liberation the system was rapidly extended, with priorty
 to the factory and working-class districts. By the end of
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 1955 there were 650 miles of pipes serving 2,190,000 peo-
 ple.  That represents nearly everyone (96.6%) in the city
 proper, and 21.6 per cent in the rural districts round it.
 When water is flowing freely through the new system
 from the Yungting River all the citizens of Peking will
 have clean, piped water.
 Ever since Peking has been a capital there have been
 smooth, straight roads in and out of it.  But they were
 roads for the imperial court, for the nobility and the rich.
 The ordinary hutung-narrow lanes-where the majority
 lived, were unpaved, made of trampled earth.  In fact,
 there was a rueful proverb about them.    "No wind, three
 feet of dust.  Rain, and it's all mud!"   After liberation,
 roads which were asphalted, gravelled, or metalled total
 310 miles by the end of 1955.  At the beginning of 1949
 there were only 163 miles of decent roads. Between 1949
 and 1955 four times as many new roads were built as the
 reactionary rulers had done in the forty years between the
 end of the Manchu dynasty and liberation !
 As new factories, mining areas, offices, schools and
 universities spring up, new roads are laid in all directions.
 Beyond the eastern gates, a network of roads link the new
 factories. Beyond .Fu Hsing Men, a broad highway, 17 miles
 long, leads to the Mentoukou mining district via the in-
 dustrial town of Shihchingshan.
 In the northwestern outskirts, where most of the educa-
 tional and cultural institutions are located, the old road,
 barely two narrow traffic lanes wide, which led from Hsi
 Chih Men to the Summer Palace, has been widened.  It is'
 now two metalled double-track roads, with trees and shrubs
 planted down the centre and on either side.  Another road,
 eight miles long, has been built from near Teh Sheng Men,
 the northwestern gate of the Inner City, to the Summer
 Palace.  These two main roads, linked by crossroads,
 serve the colleges, universities and other cultural institu-
 tions, the parks and beauty spots on this side of Peking.
 In the city and the residential districts the old main roads
 are all asphalted.  Since liberation some 2,600 hutunag in
 the city have been resurfaced.
 Public transport within and without the city has been
 rapidly expanded.   Just after liberation, there were only
 49 trams and five buses, old and worn, Plying short dis-
 tances.  By the end of 1955 there were 240 trams on seven
 routes, serving a total length of 38 miles, and 401 buses
 on 13 urban and 14 rural routes, serving a total length
 of 215 miles.  The newly opened tram and bus routes lead
 to the factories, government offices, schools and housing
 estates. For instance, the newly laid double-track tram-
 way between the Bridge of Heaven and the Red Bridge,
 completed in October 1955, serves workers who were
 formerly off any public transport routes.  In 1949, trams
 and buses ran at twenty or thirty minute intervals. Now
 they come at intervals of three to five minutes.
 5.  NEW BUILDINGS
 Anyone who last saw Peking seven yea---       and
 comes here again today will hardly believe hissey so,when
 he sees the number of new buildings which have sprung
 up in all parts of the city, and when he sees carts and
 trucks loaded with steel rods and frames, timber, sand,
 cement, stones, bricks, tiles-all kinds of building mate-
 rials-wherever he looks.  Everywhere you turn whether
 in the main streets, the hutung, outside the city, even in
 the open fields, the varied sounds of building are heard
 -the roar of engines, the yo-ho of work-songs, shouting.  At night, the building sites are brill antlyelit

 -winter and summer, since the introduction of a method
 for carrying on work during even the bitterest winter
 -days.  Buildings have risen on both the ruins of the old
 and on sites where buildings never stood before. And still
 'scaffolding is going up everywhere. Buildings which went
 up between 1949 and the end of .1955, had a total floor
 space of 16,744,000 square yards, equivalent to 70 per cent
 of the floor space of all the buildings standing in 1949. Of
 the old Peking houses, 90 per cent were single storeyed.
 Now, over 60 per cent of the new buildings have four or
 five floors and not a few eight or nine.
 On the eastern and southern outskirts and in districts
 further out to the west and northwest of the city, state-
 owned factories have been built or expanded. These include
 the Fengtai Bridge Engineering Works, the Changhsintien
 Railway Repair Works, the Pelting Agricultural Machinery
 Plant, Peking Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Cotton Mills and large and
 small brick and tile kilns, marble works, etc.
 The actual speed of erection is very rapid.  Work on the
 Peking No. 1 Cotton Mill started in the spring of 1953.
 Even while the scaffolding was still rising on the upper
 storeys, engineers were installing machinery on the ground
 floor, and ? before the National Day 1954, the Mill was
 already producing large quantities of cloth for wear on the
 holiday!  And before No. 1 Cotton Mill was finished,
 building began on No. 2 Mill (twice the -size of No. 1) and
 then on No. 3 Mill.
 In the northwest district, where the colleges and univer-
 sities are, the total floor space built from 1949 to the end of
 .1955 was 1,578,720 square yards.  Of this, 538,000 square
 yards were built in 1953 alone.  In the last few years, ex=
 tensions have been added to both Tsing Hua and Peking
 Universities.  Between 1952 and 1954 the floor space of new
 extensions to Tsing Hua was half the total floor space of all
 its buildings put up over the previous forty years.
 But there are more educational buildings since liberation
 besides universities and scientific institutions. To meet the
 urgent need for technical personnel of all grades called for
 by the various plans for economic' development, a host of
 secondary technical schools which never existed before is
 coming into being.  There are, for instance, schools of iron
 and steel technology, chemical, electric supply and power,
 engineering and oil technology - each housed in spacious
 buildings with lecture rooms, laboratories and experimental
 workshops.  The School of Iron and Steel Technology has a
 floor space of 49,000 square yards. Between liberation and
 1955, 2,152,800 square yards of new classrooms were added
 to Peking's primary and secondary schools-the new
 schools, for the most part, being in districts where there
 were few schools before for the children of workers and
 peasants.
 New and enlarged hospitals, too, are to be seen - the
 Soviet Red Cross Hospital, the Moslem Hospital, the
 Children's Hospital, the Tuberculosis Hospital, the Tung-
 jen Municipal Hospital and the Peking Hospital, and fine
 new clinics connected with the Peking First and Fourth
 Hospitals and the Central Seventh Hospital.  There are
 also two tuberculosis sanatoria-the Sanatorium for
 Asian Students and the Peking Municipal Sanatorium.
 The Soviet Red Cross Hospital, which has a total floor
 space of some 40,000 square,yards, is a very large building
 on three floors.  Its layout and equipment are based
 on the very latest Soviet ideas in medical science.  Then
 there is the hospital set up in the Moslem district to serve
 Moslems exclusively-an unheard-of thing before.      The
 Sanatorium for Asian Students has a total floor space of.
 over 20,000 square yards, 300 beds and beautiful equipment
 and buildings.  It stands as a symbol of the unity and
 friendship between Chinese students and those of other
 Asian countries.  The new Children's Hospital which has

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 a total floor space of 35,806 square yards and 600 beds, is
 the largest, best equipped and most up-to-date of its kind
 in the country.  All types of cases can be treated-med-
 ical, surgical, ear-nose-and-throat,  and  eyes, with an
 isolation ward for infectious diseases. There are iron
 lungs for poliomyelitis cases and the full range of physical
 medicine apparatus.  There are exercise rooms .and play-
 rooms for convalescent children, residential and nursing
 rooms for nursing mothers of sick babies, and a premature
 baby ward.  The hospital also has two clinics in the city.
 The demand for more housing for government em-
 ployees, workers, teachers and students is ever more
 pressing.  It is being rapidly met; and gardens, squares,
 co-operative stores and department stores are also springing
 up both in the new and the old districts.
 The People's Government also looks after those who are
 not too well off - the families of men in the armed forces
 and the dependents of martyrs who died for their country.
 Tens of thousands of poor people who were formerly
 homeless or lived in wretched sheds have now moved into
 clean and comfortable new houses.
 New hotels have been built, such as the Peace Hotel,
 the Hsinchiao Hotel, hostels for foreign technicians, and a
 special transit hostel- for Chinese who return from overseas.
 Existing hotels have been renovated and enlarged-as
 have the Peking and the International Hotels.  These are
 all modern buildings, with exquisite interior decoration.
 Just outside four of the city gates are peasant hostels.
 They are for peasants coming in on business or pleasure,
 and are designed for the comfort of the users - with the
 kang of North China-brick-built beds heated by flues-
 sheds and stables for their carts and animals, canteens and
 retail co-operative shops dealing in farm implements, 'rec-
 reation rooms, a safe-deposit room, etc.
 Before liberation, Peking had 16 cinemas and 10 large
 theatres.  If they had been evenly distributed, they would
 still not have been adequate, but they were not sited ac-
 cording to Population densities.  To satisfy the
 people's
 cultural needs, between liberation and the end of 1955, the
 municipal authorities built 13 theatres and six cinemas and
 rebuilt three theatres.  Two vi the cinemas are in the
 north city, as is the spacious People's Theatre. At the
 Bridge of Heaven, outside Chien Men, where thousands of
 working people live, is a new theatre.  On the Wangfu
 Avenue in east city rises the beautiful Capital Theatre,
 which seats 1,385.  The stage can take 400 performers,
 and it is fully equipped with modern scene-shifting de-
 vices.  There is a full-size orchestra pit and spacious.foyers
 and bars.
 Outside the western wall, adjoining the Zoo, is the
 striking Soviet Exhibition Centre.  The buildings are
 grouped round a high gilded spire, topped by a glisten-
 ing red star which can be seen for miles.  There is a
 magnificent open-air theatre- seating 3,000, a cinema seat-
 ing 800, and a restaurant holding 400 at a sitting. It was
 opened in October 1954, when d magnificent exhibition was
 held, an exhibition of Soviet economic and cultural achieve-
 ments.  The exhibition buildings are now a permanent
 addition to Peking's cultural life.
 Another new landmark in Peking is the Department
 Store on the Wang Fu Ching Street which has .a. floor space
 of 22,700 square yards. Six storeys high, it is planned for
 the convenience of customers and can hold 10,000 customers
 at once, so well laid out are the sales floors and counters.
 There are over 1,000 assistants and the stock of goods is
 kept up so as to be able to supply 120,000 customers a day.
 A new gymnasium - the Peking Gymnasium - in
 southeast Peking in the Outer City was completed in
 October 1955.  It has a total floor space of 51,000 square

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 yards, with three main buildings.  In the centre, the main
 gymnasium has basketball, volleyball
 tennis and bad
 ,
 -
 minton courts, and space for other different kinds of
 physical exercises. There is seating for over 6,000 specta-
 tors, giant electrically controlled scoreboards and sets of
 lighting for various games.  The indoor swimming pool,
 164 feet long and 65% feet Wide, has room for 2,000 specta-
 tors, and is air-and-water-conditioned for all-the-year-round
 swimming.  The third building is for training in all kinds
 of sports. There is also a parachute tower 177 feet high
 nearby.
 Major construction work is still going on.  Of the larger
 buildings at present being built, a new hotel, the Chien Men
 Hotel, in the Outer City is typical.  It has a central build-
 ing eight storeys high ? and two six-storeyed wings.  The
 total floor space is 29,780 square yards, and it will accom-
 modate 400 guests. ' Another project is Peking's second
 open-air swimming pool, near the Joyous Pavilion Park,
 which will have shallow and deep pools and a pool for races.
 The swimming pools can accommodate 5,000 swimmers and
 the stands 6,000 spectators.  Another project is the Peking
 Planetarium, China's first, which will be west of the city
 near the Soviet Exhibition Centre.  Standing in an area
 of 6% acres, the planetarium will have a floor space of
 24,000 square yards.  The buildings consist of a domed
 hall, 75.4 feet in diameter, and a pavilion on either side
 for exhibition purposes.  A Zeiss planetarium projector
 (made in the German Democratic Republic) will be install-
 ed in the centre of the hall, from which thousands of points
 of light will be projected on to the inside of the dome,
 simulating the-form and motion of the celestial bodies.
 The planetarium will have its own observatory and
 meteorological station.  Research into ancient Chinese
 astronomy will also be carried out there.
 6.  BEAUTIFYING PEKING WITH GREENERY  .
 In the last few years public gardens have been made
 near the main roads.  Over seventy thousand trees have
 been planted along the roads and the banks of rivers and
 streams.                      In an' area of some 930 acres in the Western
 Hills, thirty million trees, mostly conifers, have been plant-
 ed, to act as a shelter belt against the sand-storms.  In
 the factory districts, three shelter belts over 100 ' acres of
 land have been planted, and Peking has 2,085 acres of
 nursery gardens where trees and shrubs are brought on.
 The citizens of Peking are going to make their whole
 city green. Much has been done already; more will be done,
 until all Peking is a beautiful garden.

 THE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL. CENTRE
 OF NEW CHINA
 Writers and Artists is in Peking.  The famous Peking
 Opera originated here, and all folk art and artists gravitate
 here, too.  Operas- classical, modern and local - folk
 songs, music and dances from all parts of the country can
 be heard in Peking.  Our famous professional actors and
 actresses and folk artists of China's national minorities,
 and those from other countries, bring their best to Peking
 audiences.
 Peking is, too, the chief publishing centre for news-
 papers,  periodicals,                                                                                           and  books.  Twenty-one national
 newspapers are published here, the most widely circulated
 being the People's Daily, Worker's Daily, Peking Daily,
 China Youth Journal, and Kwangming Daily.  There are
 two news-sheets in foreign languages-the Hsinhua News
 Agency Release, in English, and Druzhba, a full-size daily
 paper in Russian.  There are 246 periodicals published in
 Peking with national circulations. Several foreign language
 magazines, including People's China, China Pictorial, China
 Reconstructs, Chinese Literature, and Women of China, are-
 also published in the capital.
 There are forty or more publishing houses.  The largest
 is the People's Publishing House; others deal in specialized
 fields such as literature, the fine arts, science, national
 minorities, and so on.  There is the Foreign Languages
 Press, which introduces China and her people, their life, .to
 the world through books, pamphlets, pictorials and transla-
 tions of literary work both new and old.
 Peking is the educational centre of China.  By the end
 of 1955 it had twenty-eight institutions, of higher learning,
 and over a thousand primary and secondary schools. There
 are also various kinds of secondary technical schools.
 Since liberation considerable progress has been made in
 primary and secondary education in Peking., By the end of
 1955 the number of primary school children attending
 school in Peking was 336,980 - nearly three times as many
 Peking has, throughout the ages, been a treasure house
 of public records and famous as a scholastic centre. Since
 liberation this aspect of Peking has become even more pro-
 nounced.
 Peking is now the home of academic and scientific re-
 search in China.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences
 gathers together all the leading scientists and experts in
 all fields, and leads scientific research for the whole country.
 Much more emphasis than ever before is now placed on
 research, and the number of specialized studies, and, cor-
 respondingly, the number of research workers has grown
 The Chinese Federation) of Scientific Societies
 which
 ,
 had 34 affiliated specialized societies at the end of 1955
 and engages in all kinds of academic work, and the Chinese
 Association for the Popularization of Scientific and Techni-
 cal Knowledge, both have their head offices in Peking. So
 have many other associations, for instance, Political Science
 and Law Association of China, the Chinese People's In-
 stitute of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Philosophical
 Society, the Chinese Historical Society, and the Institute
 of Banking and Currency.
 Peking is the centre of China's literary and artistic
 activity.  The headquarters of the Chinese Federation of

 as in 1948; and the number of secondary school students
 was 141,971- an increase only slightly less.  In the pri-
 mary schools 76.7 per cent, and in the secondary schools
 76.9 per cent of the students come from the families of
 workers, peasants, government workers, and servicemen.
 There has been a radical change in what the schools teach-
 and the methods of teaching.  In New China, particular
 attention is paid to promoting the all-round development
 of her youngsters both in mind and body.
 To satisfy the people's longing for a full cultural life,
 spare-time schools for government and factory workers are
 run by government organizations, factories, or by the
 local communities.  That means there is an evening class
 for every so many streets or lanes. In the country dis-
 tricts on the outskirts there are regular spare-time and
 winter schools for the peasants.  By the end of 1955,
 government employees numbering 130,000 were taking part
 in spare-time cultural study; and over 100,000 peasants,
 handicraftsmen, government workers and their families
 and other citizens-were getting schooling in one shape
 or another.
 Peking is the centre for libraries, historical relics and
 archives.  It has the largest -library in the country - the
 National Library.  There is the Peking Municipal Library
 too, with reading rooms to serve the general public. Besides
 the main building it has two branches and 114 mobile book
 and magazine services which serve the factories and rural
 areas of Peking.  Since liberation 70 reading centres, large
 and small, have been opened in different parts of the city.
 As already mentioned, in Chapter III, there is a
 museum - the Palace Museum - in the Imperial Palaces.
 It is the largest in the country.  A great number of ancient
 finds which have been unearthed in China have been sent
 to Peking to be stored and exhibited there.

 Despite the repeated devastation wrought by imperialist
 aggressors  and  reactionary governments  in  the  past
 h                                                                                            years, Pelting is still a treasure house of buildings
 ofhundredistoric
 importance and artistic beauty, still the
 "Museum of China," and still, perhaps, one of the world's
 richest cities in this respect.
 .2. THE SPREAD OF HIGHER EDUCATION
 The spread of higher education can best be seen from
 the growth of Peking's western outskirts.  For some years
 past there have been two universities and an agricultural
 institute outside the western walls.  But since liberation
 over 20 new institutions of higher learning or scientific
 research have been established.  Now, when we go out of
 Hsi Chih Men or Teh Sheng Men, we see before us a very
 different aspect from what there was before.
 The Chinese Academy of Sciences is the central point
 of the entire district.  Buildings already completed or
 still under construction include those which house several
 institutes of the Academy- Physics, Geophysics, and
 Meteorology, Economics, Linguistics and Philology-and
 these are only a beginning.
 Now, radiating round the Academy of Sciences, are the
 Peking Normal University, the Central Conservatoire, the
 Peking Medical College, and the Institutes of Iron and
 Steel Technology, Oil Technology, Mechanized Agriculture,
 Aeronautics, Geology, Mining and Metallurgy, the North
 China Institute of Agricultural Research, the Central In-
 stitute for Nationalities, the Chinese People's University,
 Peking University, Tsing Hua University and the Marx-
 Lenin Institute and others.
 All these institutes of higher learning and scientific
 research, whether newly built or expanded, are training
 large numbers of technicians and specialists, who are in

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 great demand for China's economic construction.  By the
 end of 1955 the total enrolment in Peking's higher institutes
 was 60,544.  Increased facilities have enabled them to
 admit more and more students.  The Peking Institute of
 Iron and Steel Technology and the Peking Institute of Oil
 Technology, for example, had twice as many by the end of
 1955 as in 1953.   The Peking Institute of Geology had
 4,486 students at ,the end of 1955 - 61/., times as many as
 the total number of geological students who graduated in
 the 40 years previous!
 Prior to liberation, there were, all told, only 11 colleges,
 and about 10,000 students in Peking.  And even in this
 small group there was no co-ordination.  The curricula
 overlapped, there were gaps, and what was taught tended
 only to touch the fringes of the subject. Such science or
 engineering departments as did exist were, in part, only
 suitable for a semi-colonial, dependent country.  Students
 were not trained in designing or manufacturing, but only
 in assembly, overhaul and maintenance.  Some whole de-
 partments - geology, for instance - had only a handful
 of students.  Now, since reorganization, such neglected
 courses have become independent colleges in their own
 right.
 3. SCHOOLING OF A NEW TYPE
 Peking boasts of a number of institutions which have
 become models for similar schools elsewhere in the country.
 Let us first consider the Chinese People's University.
 Founded in 1950, it has the general courses, specialized
 courses, preparatory department, a short-term worker-
 peasant secondary school, a Marxist-Leninist evening
 college, and a research course in Marxism-Leninism.  By-
 the end of 1955 it had a total enrolment of 5,197 students,
 including research students.  Ninety per cent of them come
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 from government offices and enterprises, industry, or the
 armed forces and have been selected by their orgazations
 and sent here to Pursue more advanced stItdies.
 The fine traditions
 in the               of revolutfouar . eduatfOn laid down
 liberated areas during the Anti-japanese War by. tae
 North, China University have been     iced l~F the Chinese
 People's University. With the polio of Hnkf with practice, linking Soviet et              g teael22ng
 conditions of China as its guide, etn ERce with the concrete
 Leninist education to train worker andPrd on blarxL~t
 to conduct scientific research.  The Chinese People's Unand
 iversity has acquired rich experience in this re--  ,-t and
 has passed on its experience to other institution, through-
 out the country.  This has been a great help in furthering
 reform of teaching methods and teaching content generally.
 Peking University was founded in 1898. Ma
 President of the University, called it "one of the seeds o,
 revolution" at its 56th anniversarf
 y celebration. seeds o

 with this changed attitude that Peking
 made contact with Marxist Leninist theory.  Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, the great leader of the Chinese mode
 Party and the Chinese people, Comrade Li Ta-chaothe

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 But Peking University is not famous only for its
 glorious revolutionary traditions, but also for its tradition
 of scientific research.  And now it is a comprehensive uni-
 versity of a new type, its main task is the training of
 specialists in research and teaching the natural and social
 sciences.  By the end of 1955 the university had 13 de-
 partments including mathematics, natural sciences, philos-
 ophy, social sciences, linguistics and philology, and litera-
 ture, and these departments are again subdivided into 32
 specialized courses.  There is also a special short training
 course for librarians, a special class for foreign students,
 75 teaching and research groups, an institute of research
 in literature, and a short-term middle school for workers
 and peasants.  In 1955, it had 828 faculty members and
 5,881 students in all departments including the research
 students.   There are 40 laboratories and a library with
 1,700,000 volumes.
 Then there is Tsing Hua University.  After liberation
 it was reorganized; and since 1952 has become a new
 polytechnic, an industrial university, training engineers of
 a new type.    By the end of 1955 Tsing Hua had seven de-
 partments subdivided into 20 specialized courses, all direct-
 ly connected with heavy industry or capital construction.
 There are 822 faculty members and 6,577 students includ-
 ing research students.  There is a large library with
 spacious reading rooms, and a well-equipped gymnasium
 and beautiful sports grounds and facilities.  There are 47
 laboratories and an experimental workshop.    The students
 have their own self-governing groups-for example, phys-
 ical training groups, scientific research groups, and liter-
 ature, music and dancing societies.
 The Central Institute for Nationalities was established
 in 1951 in order to train people belonging to national
 minorities to work among their own folk in the political,
 economic, cultural and educational fields.  The institute is
 a.
 specially designed to carry out this task, with special de-
 partments in political science, linguistics and languages,
 and so on, and research departments in the history, culture
 and economic conditions of minority areas. By the end of
 1955 it had 229 teachers drawn from 31 nationalities and
 473 students, including research students, drawn from 53.
 The daily life of the students and staff of this institute
 is a miniature of the family life of the whole nation,
 embodying as it does China's policy towards national
 minorities -respect and equality, religious freedom and
 full observance of national customs.  Facilities for the full
 observance of this policy are complete. There are special
 buildings in rooms for Moslems and Buddhists to worship
 in and the kitchen provides different kinds of food to suit
 the dietary laws and tastes of the different nationalities.
 In addition to the new type of universities, colleges and
 institutes, Peking is well provided with new
 types secondary technical schools, such as the Peking Machine-
 Too] School, the Peking School of Iron and Steel Technology,
 the Peking School of Electricity, and so on.        Teaching in
 these schools is closely linked with the needs of the country,
 and facilities exist for students to obtain experience at the
 bench.  Examples of this method in practice can be seen
 in the Peking School of Iron and Steel Technology, which
 has its students' hostels close to the Shihchingshan Iron
 and Steel Works, and in the Peking Machine-Tool School,
 which is near the casting shop of the Peking No. 1 Machine-
 Tool Works, so that the students can take part in actual
 production and become familiar with their job in "real
 life."
 4.  THE BIGGEST LIBRARY IN CHINA
 The National Library, the biggest reference library in
 China, is, as we have already mentioned in passing, on the

 west bank of Peihai.  It is not only beautifully situated,
 but is a beautifully laid-out group of buildings.  Go through
 the gate in the red wall, guarded by two stone lions.  In
 front of you are lawns, surrounded by a close-cropped
 cypress hedge, and then a palace-like building, with green
 tiled tilted eaves and covered verandas, white stone balus-
 trades, and two more lions.  The interior of the building
 is modern.
 It has inherited a rich store from the Chingshih
 Library, the Peihai Library and others.  From the Ching-
 shih Library it -acquired the books and archives of the
 imperial Wen Yuan Igo Library-a famous collection
 which has existed for 500 years, and which, in turn, in-
 cluded books and manuscripts from the, imperial library
 of the Southern Sung dynasty some 700 years ago.  It
 also includes other famous collections from imperial libra-
 ries of the Manchu dynasty, imperial colleges and private
 owners, and is still increasing its priceless collection. By
 the end of 1955 more than 4,300,000 volumes stood on its
 shelves - books in 65 languages, including 13 minority
 languages of China - three times the number it had in
 1949. Among them are rare copies of ancient manuscripts
 and books of five dynasties, from the Sung to the Manchu,
 including 140,000 manuscript volumes on 18,000 different
 subjects, 8,700 copies of Buddhist sutras going back to the
 Southern and Northern dynasties (479-581 A.D.), the Sui
 (581-618 A.D.) and Tang (618-907 A.D.) dynasties, old
 maps, diagrams, and 25,000 rubbings from ancient in-
 scriptions on metal and stone. The Yung Lo Encyclopaedia
 of the Ming dynasty and the Sze IKu Chuan Shu (Imperial
 Library of Chien Lung) of the Manchu dynasty are kept
 here, too.  There are also revolutionary documents from
 the last hundred years and authors' original manuscripts.
 The library is open to all Peking's citizens.  Popular
 works and Marxist-Leninist works have been augmented,
 a reading and reference room for scientific and technical
 subjects has been opened, and a children's section, with a
 reading room, added.
 Besides supplying such normal public library facilities,
 exhibitions and lectures on current affairs are held, and
 readings, talks by authors, discussions and so on organized.
 The library plays its part, too, in the great work of construc-
 tion, both by supplying literature to the workers "on site"
 - by mobile libraries which go to factories and construc-
 tion sites, like the IKuanting Reservoir and the Fengtai.
 Shacheng Railway-and by supplying reference material
 and technical books to the planning staffs.  It answers re-
 quests for specific information and collects relevant material
 for individuals, governmental and non-governmental or-
 ganizations, factories, and so on.
 The library has also established inter-library exchanges
 with other large provincial and municipal libraries through-
 out the country.  So now geological workers tapping
 underground riches in the mountains and readers in the
 border areas can obtain books from the National Library.
 Reference books which are only available in single copies
 are microfilmed or directly photographed, so that copies
 can be supplied when needed.
 Stocks of new technical and reference books for use in
 our construction have been greatly increased.  The Soviet
 Union, in particular, has sent many from the Lenin State
 Library and the Academy of Sciences of U.S.S.R. on an
 exchange basis. Indeed, up to the end of 1955, the library
 received no less than 140,000 works from the Soviet Union,
 books and periodicals, which are of enormous assistance.
 ,The Soviet libraries regularly send books dealing with
 advanced scientific and technical subjects on publication.
 Similar exchanges are made with the libraries of other
 countries.

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 As the number and coverage of the books increase, so
 does the good they do readers.  In 1955 a new, six-storeyed
 building was completed which can take over a million
 volumes.  As the level of the people's culture and educa-
 tion rises, so will the National Library grow.
 CHAPTER VI
 ? INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND HANDICRAFTS
 1.  INDUSTRY
 Up to 'liberation Peking had been mainly a consumer
 city.  What little industry it had was poorly equipped, and
 only used out-of-date techniques; the quality of the prod-
 ucts was low, while costs were high.  Such low-quality
 products as Peking put on the market found few customers.
 Moreover, rapacious imperialists and the Kuomintang
 scrambled for control.  On the eve of liberation most of
 Peking's few industrial establishments were at a standstill
 or only partially in operation.
 Almost from the very day of liberation the People's
 Government carried out a policy of industrial rehabilitation
 and development.  By 1955 the value of Peking's industrial
 production was nine times what it was in 1949.  The value
 of modern industrial production, as distinct from industries
 using simple mechanical processes, increased from 74 per
 cent in 1949 to 80 per cent in 1955, in the total value *of
 industrial output in Peking.
 The old workshops and factories have all been repaired
 and expanded, and some entirely new ones built.  The
 Peking No. 1 Machine-Tool Works, for instance,. was
 formed from an amalgamation of fourteen ramshackle
 Kuomintang weapon-repair works, which had had no
 machinery worth mentioning.  It- is now turning out up to
 two hundred universal millers a year.  An even more
 dramatic change, perhaps, is, to be seen in the Peking
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 Agricultural Machinery Plant.  Formerly another old
 Kuomintang arsenal, it now turns out hundreds of thou-
 sands of Ploughs and harvesters-the new, improved
 models. "Swords into ploughshares" with a vengeance!
 And it has started on the production of combine harvest-
 ers, which have passed the prototype stage.
 Then, too, there is the Shihchingshan Iron and Steel
 Works which has gone from strength to strength. By 1955
 it was turning out nearly 15 times as much pig-iron as in
 1949.
 The Chingho Woollen Mill, which had previously 3,200
 spindles and 60 looms and was only able to turn out coarse
 army blankets and poor-quality serge, has now increased its
 spindles to 12,000 and added 56 new spinning frames.
 There is a new section which produces long-piled material,
 and other high-quality woollen goods.
 The cotton textile industry is completely new to Peking.
 The No. 1 Cotton Mill, with 50,000 spindles and over 1,000
 looms, and the No. 2 Mill, with 100,000 spindles and 2,400
 looms, are in full operation.  The No. 3 Mill which will have
 80,000 spindles and 3,600 looms is being built.  They use
 locally-produced cotton and are already meeting the needs
 of Peking and nearby districts.
 A great new enterprise is now in part operation -the
 North China Structural Metal Works, which makes steel
 frames and other building materials.  Production not only
 meets Peking's huge building programme, but can supply
 other parts of the country as well.   Then there is the
 Peking No. 1 Motor Accessory Works, which has begun
 production and, besides servicing all types of motor
 vehicles, -will support China's new motor industry.
 And, of course, the coal mines have not been left out
 of this new life.  They are being mechanized systematical-
 ly.  In the Chinghsi (western Peking) mining district,
 for instance, in 1955 three times as much coal was mined
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 as in 1949.  Two new shafts are in operation.  Peking's
 mines have good-quality coal, including anthracite. There
 is also a fairly wide range of other minerals-lime, quartz;
 white jade, marble, bluestone, slate, etc.
 Peking's industries, mainly light, produce a wide
 variety of manufactured goods.  As we have said, there
 are textiles (woollen and cotton goods), printing and dye-
 ing, knitwear, cloth and canvas bags, leather goods, rubber
 footwear, rubber-proof cloth, tires, enamel-ware, acid-
 proof material for industry, curved sheet glass, laboratory
 equipment, electrical supplies, etc.
 Since liberation the People's Government has carried
 out a socialist, transformation of private industry and
 handicrafts in Peking.  In 1949 there were 107,700 people
 employed in some 30 trades in private industry.  Price
 stabilization, the progress of national construction and the
 improvement in the living conditions of the people after
 liberation gave the industrialists a great opportunity of
 expansion.  The People's. Government has -adopted a
 variety of forms of state capitalism as half-way houses to
 socialization of private industry-forms such as the giv-
 ing out of government contracts for manufacture and pro-
 cessing by private industries, the purchasing and distribu-
 tion by the state of their output, and conversion into
 enterprises under joint, state and private control. In 1955
 these concerns (not including the last sort) were turn-
 ing out seven-tenths of the whole output of Peking's
 private, industry.  Most firms affected were running
 smoothly, turning out better goods and making a profit.
 The firms which had become "state-private"-76 of them
 -produced goods worth 2% times as much as in 1954.
 The advantages of joint state-private enterprise have
 become clear in the last few years.  This has made the
 capitalists see that their future lies only in linking their
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 ps and private houses, as often as not, one man
 or family concerns.  Now, since liberation, they have
 gradually gone over to co-operative working.  With the
 help of the government and the state-owned enterprises,
 they have been able to increase their capital, improve
 their equipment and organize their work on a more' ration-
 al basis.  This has proved a great success. Production has
 risen, and quality has improved enormously.
 In early 1956, as agriculture round Peking was going
 over to co-operative, collective farming, and inside the city
 = private industry and commerce were going socialist, Pe-
 king's handicrafts, too, went co-operative en bloc. The
 handicraft co-ops now have 84,000 members.
 The Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Works
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 own interests with those of the state.  The Communist
 Party and People's Government have re
 t
 dl
 pea
 e
 y assured
 them that any capitalist who has done something for the
 cause of socialism will not be forgotten by the state and
 the people, and will get a fair deal.  Capitalists have come
 - to realiz
 th

 at work is an honour and to exploit people
 something shameful.  Realizing this, they want to earn
 A heir living by their own labour.  Within their own fami-
 lies, too, sons, daughters, wives, cousins persuade and
 encourage those who may hold back.      At the same time,
 the employees in private industry have got together and
 have themselves played a large part in ' educating and
 transforming the capitalists. The high tide of agricul-
 tural co-operation which had reached Peking's very walls
 at the beginning of 1956 further showed c
 it
 li
 ap
 a
 sts the
 way things were moving.  Within a few weeks Peking's
 private industry took the first great step towards socialism
 almost overnight-4,556 private industrial concerns be-
 came joint state-private enterprises.

 always occupied an important place in the city's economy.

 State Farm
 The municipality of Peking includes some 201,108 acres
 of farmland. Here, too, changes are to be seen, reflecting
 the great changes in agriculture that have taken place over
 the length and breadth of China.
 Output has steadily increased, and with it happiness
 and well-being.  In 1955, total grain production was 2.7
 times what it was in 1949, cotton 6.5 times, and vegetables
 eight times.  Meat, dairy products and fruit have also
 greatly increased in quantity.          ,
 Several factors accounted for these changes.  First
 there was the carrying out of land reform around Peking.
 Here, as elsewhere, this made the peasants masters of
 their land, and gave them something they could put their
 whole hearts into.  Following land reform, the People's
 Government helped the peasants in every possible way,
 with loans, with advice on improved agricultural tech-
 niques, and so on, and helped them set up mutual-aid teams
 and co-operatives themselves.  In the mutual-aid teams
 both production and the incomes of the organized peasants
 progressively increased.  In the co-operatives, the later
 stage, this became ever more marked. Grain yields of 279
 co-ops at the end of 1954 were higher than those of mutual-
 aid teams or peasants working on their own-25.8 per cent
 above the mutual-aid teams' and 42.4 per cent up on in-
 dividual peasants': Peasants like to see things for them-
 selves !  They were not blind to such figures.  They saw
 that co-operative farming was the only way to progress
 for themselves.
 A great step forward was taken early this year, the
 culmination of the experiences of these formative years.
 In 1952, when the first co-ops near Peking started, only
 .08 per cent of the 120,000 peasant households in the mu-
 nicipality joined.  By 1954 and early 1955 the figure had

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 gone up to 46 per cent.  And by the winter of 1955 all
 peasant households were in "first stage" co-ops-that is,
 co-ops in which the land is pooled and worked in common.
 but wnere the plots remain the property of the individual,
 on which he receives dividends at harvest time.  Then a
 great upsurge took place on Peking's farmlands, and swept
 China.  The ordinary co-ops turned themselves into cnl.
 lective farms, in which land is no longer pooled but owned
 collectively.  No more dividends are paid on land; all pay-
 ments are for labour only.  By January of 1956 all the
 co-ops in Peking municipality had changed over to the en.
 tirely socialist type-otherwise known as collective farms.
 The striking thing is that the change-over has been so
 smooth and natural, but then all conditions were-ripe for
 it. In the first place, the majority of the poor and middle
 peasants were already in the lower type of co-ops, and
 knew full well that co-operation was the only road to pros-
 perity and happiness.  Secondly, at the lower stage, the
 bigger individually-owned farm implements and equip-
 ment, and the draught animals had been turned over to
 the co-op at a fair price, and the land dividends were any-
 way low.  Then the change-over to a higher stage gave
 a larger remuneration for labour, which more than com-
 pensated for the cancellation of land dividends and other
 shares.  Thirdly, there was the example of the seventy-
 seven out-and-out socialist co-operatives already in exist-
 ence-collective farms.  They had been set up since 1952,
 and in every case both production and the incomes of
 members had gone up. This, greatly encouraged the peas-
 Peking were pretty large, and well-suited for a diversified
 economy.  It was easy, therefore, for peasants in such
 surroundings to visualize an even larger and better stage,
 where it would be to their direct advantage to find work
 for everyone-whether they had full or ' partial labour
 power-and where proper help could be given to the old,
 feeble, orphaned or widowed, without placing undue strain
 on the able-bodied, or reducing their income untowardly.
 So they took this great step forward to socialism and
 immediately started to draw up comprehensive and far-
 reaching plans to develop production even further.  Let
 us take, for example, the plan of Red Star Collective Farm.
 That will show what the future holds for the 120,000 peas-
 ant households of Peking.
 Red Star Collective Farm lies in the southeast corner
 of Nanyuan District (south of Peking).  The ground is
 naturally poor, low-lying, often waterlogged and over-
 alkaline.  Yields were low and many varieties of crops
 simply would not grow there.  After liberation and land
 reform, things began to improve, but the average peasant,
 despite the fact that he owned his land and was no longer
 in bondage to the money-lender and the landlord, could
 still only make a bare living.  The peasants saw for them-
 selves the value of mutual aid and co-operation.  Life it-
 self taught them.  In 1952, two co-operatives started up
 as a try-out.  In the autumn of the same year these two
 merged and formed a collective farm-Red Star Collective
 Farm.  It started with 63 households.  By 1955 there
 were 850.  The farm now covers 2,800 acres.  In contrast
 to the old days when people could only look forward, half
 in dread, to the next harvest, they can now draw up a
 definite plan on a long-term basis.  In the autumn of 1955
 a comprehensive seven-year plan (1955-1962) was drawn
 joining up small plots of land held byvdiffer
 tiiica and
 en
 peasant
 households into large tracts; re-locating farm offs e
 s and
 members' homes; planning crop rotations in relation to
 actual fields; drainage, road-building, tree-planting, live-
 stock raising, training technicians; an education scheme
 both for children and adults,-and siting the school build-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 ings conveniently; having their own co-op retail stores,
 and so on.  It also sets up production targets.  By 1962
 the farm expects to produce six thousand 'tons of grain,
 176 per cent above the 1955 harvest, including 520 tons
 of rice, a new crop for this land.  Cotton output will reach
 1,250 tons (65 per cent above 1955), and there will be
 400 tons of fruit, 859,400 gallons of milk and 705 tons of
 pork.  Income and living standards of the farm members
 will rise steadily, in keeping with the growth of produc-
 tion.                            The income per household will at least treble. What
 was once an area which all the wiseacres thought could
 only keep its farmers at a bare subsistence level is now
 well on the way to being a prosperous mixed collective
 farm, combining farming with livestock raising, and rich
 in grain and domestic animals.
 Besides the collective farms, there are in Peking three
 state farms and a machine and tractor station.  The role
 of.the state farm is to popularize new and better methods,
 from abroad and from other parts of China, to grow and
 select better seed, to run experimental and demonstration
 plots and to arrange discussions and lectures for the peas-
 ants in the neighbourhood.  Here we shall briefly describe
 one of the state farms-Western Outskirts State Farm.
 It is a mixed farm, going in for intensive dairy farm-
 ing, pig-keeping, market-gardening, fruit (peach and apple
 orchards), ducks, and grain. The real speciality, perhaps,
 is peculiar to Peking. The ducks bred here are the famous
 Peking Ducks.  From here over 30,000 ducks are sent to
 market each year.  The succulent Peking Duck is the re-
 sult of years of expert knowledge.  The ducklings are
 brought up quite normally until they are 45 days old. They
 are then stuffed with sorghum and other coarse grains
 twice a day-literally stuffed for forty days.  In this
 time they put on some three to four catties over and above
 108
 their original weight, resulting in the delicious cluck that
 you eat in some of Peking's well-known restaurants.
 The Machine and Tractor Station works the fields for
 the collective farms and agricultural producers' co-opera-
 tives.  Now it has 41 tractors, three combine harvesters
 and three sprayers.  Before the end of 1956 it will have
 230 tractors and will cover the needs of 65,880 acres of
 land.
 3.  HANDICRAFT SPECIALITIES
 Peking is traditionally famous for beautiful handicrafts
 and luxury wares.  The skills of thousand of years were
 brought to Peking six hundred years ago and took firm
 root'in this ancient centre of culture.  The arts and craft
 artists here are representative of the Chinese creative
 genius.
 Peking specializes in rirany forms of handicrafts. Per-
 haps carvings come first to mind in many media jade,
 ivory, bone and wood-cloisonne, carved lacquer and lac-
 quers, inlays in mother of pearl and other materials, em-
 broidery, artificial flower making, carpets, lanterns in all
 shapes and sizes, particularly the large red palace lanterns,
 glassware, wrought metal work, and so on.
 Of course, these are highly individual creative arts.
 They have had a troubled history and were in danger of
 extinction before liberation. The grasping hands of greedy
 capitalists and imperialists, the inflation, the Japanese
 occupation, exploitation by reactionary rulers, dumping of
 mass produced foreign goods combined to all but kill the
 craft trades.  The craftsmen could not make ends meet.
 They ceased to take on apprentices, and their art itself
 declined.  Handicrafts had already become stereotyped by
 the last years of the Manchu dynasty and the subsequent
 demand for cheap and vulgarized goods by exporting mer-

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 chants either meant that the craftsmen had to lower their
 standards or else allow their art to die out.
 Liberation first and :foremost saved these handicrafts
 from decline and degradation.  In 1950 there were only
 1,680 'craftsmen; by the end of 1955 there were 13,000.
 They were guided by the head office of the Amalgamated
 Handicraft Producers' Co-operatives of Peking to organize
 themselves into forty producers' co-operatives and teams,
 with 7,298 members at the beginning. By early 1956 the
 co-op membership has increased to 13,065.  The decline in
 skill and taste was arrested. The best of the old and the
 stimulus of the new together started a renaissance.  In-
 dividual artistry, far from being stultified, has gone from
 strength to strength.  The carvers in ivory, for example,
 are not only carrying on the old intricate work but are even
 surpassing it and reflecting the new life in their subjects.
 Let us look into a small workshop-studio just outside
 Chien Men.  It is the Peking Ivory Carvers' Co-operative.
 The leading craftsman there, Yang Shih-hui, a man of 43,
 comes from a poor family of Peking craftsmen.  He start-
 ed as a lad, carving wooden architectural decorations, and
 was trained by his great-uncle.  But there was no living
 in this.  He turned to ivory carving, copying others or
 following traditional designs.  He had little formal educa-
 tion, but he had an artist's eye, and an old art master
 helped him.  But it was no easy life.  Then came libera-
 tion which changed his life, as it did that of all other
 craftsmen. As an expression of his love for the new
 society, he began to carve new subjects.  Now he and six
 assistants have finished-after 15 months' work-an im-
 . mense carving.  A huge 150-pound, 61/2 foot elephant
 tusk, its natural curve utilized in the design, has been
 used to make a panorama of Peihai Park.  All the beau-
 ties of Peihai are there-the island, the trees, the Dagoba,
 and the human figures, 1,298 in all-not the. contempla-
 tives or the court beauties and eunuchs, but the citizens
 of Peking and their families rejoicing on National Day.
 Some of the figures are so small that they can be seen only
 with the help of a magnifying glass.  Dancing, boating,
 climbing up *to look at the view, China's great `family of
 nationalities is reflected in this great carving.
 The co-operative in which Yang Shih-hui is the tech-
 nical head is flourishing. New China, with its respect for
 human dignity and labour, gives all the help and care it
 can to its Yang Shih-huis.  Yang himself gets a good
 wage, on the scale, say,, of an engineer.  And, finally, a
 significant fact-which shows how art is appreciated in
 the new China.  He is a member of the Peking Commit-
 tee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Confer-
 ence.
 Or take the case of jade working, or working other
 hard stones.  Jade in particular has a special place in
 Chinese art.  The texture of the stone itself has always
 had an attraction and is a symbol of beauty and treasure.
 When it is worked by the dextrous hands of the crafts-
 men, beauty is added to beauty.  This is an age-old craft.
 The workers themselves will tell you that it goes back
 three thousand years, long before any other people were
 working such hard material, let alone working it with such
 consummate skill.  Since the clays of the . Manchu Em-
 peror Chien Lung (1736-1795) the craftsmen were attach-
 ed to the imperial court, and Peking became the centre of
 the art.  Towards the end of the Manchu rule, the art
 began to decay.  After the revolution in 1911, it had a
 brief new lease of life. A brisk trade sprang up, for ex-
 port in worked jade.                                                                                        But the middlemen got' most of the
 profit.  During the Japanese occupation all seemed to go;
 no one could make ends meet, least of all highly special-
 ized workers who might take years over one miraculous
 piece.   In desperation, the craftsmen took to other trades.

 Great artists were pulling rickshaws, trying to peddle
 clumped goods, starving.  After the Japanese surrender
 came inflation and chaos, and there was practically no jade
 working done at all.
 Immediately after liberation the scene changed.  To
 illustrate the new course of events, let us look at one of
 the famous jade working establishments-now a co-opera-
 tive.
 Outside Chien Men, in a crowded street, is a jade carv-
 ing producers' co-operative.  Soon after liberation, sixty
 jade workers got together. They had no capital, no
 material, some not even their tools.  But they had their
 hands, and their skill, and their love of their craft; and
 they met with equal love and respect from the People's
 Government.  New ideas began to permeate them.  With
 the help of loans from the government, the co-op was set
 up.  Now it is a flourishing concern. There are altogether
 158 workers in it, including apprentices.  They are sup-
 plied with the stone by the state which handles the out-
 put.                          But the state does not specify certain article, nor
 expect the artists to turn out mass produced articles. The
 work to be produced depends entirely on the nature and
 shape of the stone, and the individual artists' particular
 bent. On the other hand, they are now able to improve
 on working methods, as there can be some division of
 labour.  They can do what they feel is their speciality-
 one, for instance, does ,birds and flowers, one human
 figures, one incense burners, and so on.  The apprentices,
 too, have a new and better life-receiving a general educa-
 tion beside learning their own craft.
 Or take cloisonne, another handicraft centred in -Pe-
 king.  That, too, goes back five hundred years to Ching
 Tai's reign in the Ming dynasty (1450-1475 A.D.)-hence,
 the name of this art, Ching Tai blue.  It is, perhaps, a
 more elaborate art than jade working as so many, proc-

 HOW THE CITIZENS OF PEKING LIVE
 Almost the first thing the ordinary citizen will tell you,
 if you ask him -what comes first to his mind about the
 change in everyday life since liberation, is:  "The cur-
 rency is stable; you know where you are with prices." The
 suffering and misery of the inflation days are still burnt
 into their memories.  Now they can plan, can look ahead,
 can know that they themselves and their dear ones can
 be sure of all their daily needs-food, clothes, housing.
 The nightmare days when prices soared, literally every
 hour, and nobody was sure whether the money in his hands
 would provide the next day's food for his family have gone
 for ever.  Every man and woman in Peking feels the ex-
 traordinary contrast of today's peaceful life-with its
 feeling of security-with the endless torments of the past.
 Ever since liberation incomes have been rising steadily.
 Wages have nearly doubled.  Besides this, workers in fac-
 tories and mines are entitled to benefits under the Labour
 Insurance Regulations, and all who work in government
 offices get free medical treatment and other amenities pro-
 vided by the management or their trade unions.
 Typical are the workers at the Shihchingshan Iron and
 Steel Works-west of the city.  Their wages have gone
 up, so that they can now live comfortably and put a bit
 by each month, whereas before they were always on the
 verge of starvation.  They are buying things they never
 thought to own before-wireless sets, bicycles, and so on.
 By 1955, the plant has spent over seven million Yuan on
 houses for its workers.  Most of them have already moved
 into sunny new homes, thankful to get away for ever from
 the old shacks which barely sheltered them from wind and
 rain.  There is a little song, a popular hit in China, which
 might have been written for this plant:
 "lit the bad old days whenever it rained,
 Our houses were flooded right out;
 But now that we're living in proper new homes,
 We've got something worth singing about."
 The People's Government attaches great importance
 to the welfare of the working people.  The Labour In-
 surance Regulations lay it down that it is the manage-
 ment's responsibility to cope with all difficulties aris-
 ing from injury, whether sustained at work or not,
 disablement, illness, birth, old age, death, etc., and give
 proper help. Women are specially looked after. Before
 liberation  women workers dreaded pregnancy.   They
 were lucky if they were not promptly sacked.  If they
 were not, they had to return to work within a few
 days of having the baby.  Now maternity cases get 56
 days' leave on full pay, and expectant mothers on tiring
 jobs are transferred to lighter work, without loss of pay,
 in or before the sixth month of pregnancy. Most factories,
 mines and other enterprises have their own nurseries and
 kindergartens, and-nursing rooms for mothers who are
 breast-feeding, for which they have time off, syithout loss
 of pay, in working hours.                    .
 Sanatoria and rest-homes for Peking workers have
 been enlarged, and new ones made available.  By the end
 of 1955 there were 114 with 2,578 beds, run by the fac-
 tories, mines, municipal offices and building enterprises in
 Peking.  Every year more and more model or advanced

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/02/01 : CIA-RDP81-01043R001500110002-7
 workers are sent to recuperate in specially equipped pavil-
 ions and bungalows in. the Summer Palace, a former im-
 perial summer resort, at Peitaiho, a famous seaside resort,
 or other holiday resorts.
 Besides such regular sanatoria and rest-homes, some
 factories and mines also run over-night sanatoria.  The
 Changhsintien Railway Repair Works Sanatorium, for in-
 stance, is run for workers whose health is, in general, good
 but who may suffer from chronic complaints, such as in-
 testinal troubles, neurasthenia, and so on.  They can work
 normally during the day, but really need extra care. They
 go back at night to the sanatorium, where they get suit-
 able treatment and special diet, and are looked after by
 doctors and nurses.  Save for a small deduction for food,
 all expenses are borne by the factory. About 1,600
 w,orkers at the Repair Works benefited from this between
 July 1951 and December 1955.  Many regained full health
 and put on weight, and returned to an ordinary life, happy
 and full of vigour.
 These striking changes in the standard of living are
 not confined to city workers only.  The peasants around
 Peking, as everywhere, are able to look ahead and live
 better now, and the farming co-operatives have their own
 welfare funds.  Gone for ever are the days when the
 money-lender took all that the landlord and taxes left.
 Take the Laikuangying Agricultural Producers' Co-
 operative on the eastern outskirts for example. Since the
 co-op was set up in 1953, the individual income of its mem-
 bers has steadily risen.  They find themselves better off
 every year.  Nobody goes in rags today.  In winter, young
 and old, men, women and children all have warm cotton-
 padded clothes and firing.    In the retail co-ops, gay new
 cotton prints, sweets, fruit, rice, white flour-all things
 which the average poor peasant never before held in his
 hands-find a ready sale. In fact, there is barely enough
 of them, so great is the demand, and so increased the pur-
 chasing power.  In the first half of 1955, the local co-op
 store was selling as many goods in a month as it did in
 a year before. And now ?brick houses are rising in the
 villages.  How many peasants in the old days even dreamt
 of having a brick house?
 Nor is there only material- improvement.  Co-op mem-
 bers enjoy an increasingly rich cultural life.                                                                                       This same
 co-op now has a regular primary school, and has a second-
 ary school within easy reach.  Three hundred and ninety'-
 six children go to primary school and there are 58 secondary
 school students, where before there were only 20.  Two
 hundred and twenty adults, men and women who were
 never able to go to school in their' youth, are now going
 to adult schools.  The co-op has a cultural centre stocked
 with over a thousand books and all the newspapers and
 journals you could want.  It has its own. newspaper read-
 ing groups, runs picture exhibitions, and has'its own wall
 newspapers and a mimeographed periodical.
 Before liberation the dreadful life in the poorer areas
 in the city = in places like Dragon Beard Ditch which we
 mention in Chapter IV-is almost impossible to describe.
 It is so close-only seven years ago - that all but small
 children remember it:  The small tradesmen, the black-
 smiths, barrel-makers, dyers, grass-hat plaiters, sock-
 makers, sewing women and other handicraftsmen all plied
 their trades out here. They lived huddled together and
 struggled for a living. The Kuomintang's heavy levies and
 the extortions of soldiers, policemen and local gangsters
 pressed so hard on the people that there was a steady
 stream forced into absolute penury. Finally they used to
 sell their tools and became rickshaw men or hauliers-any-
 thing they could get.  All too many were reduced to beg-
 ging. Now such conditions are no more. Houses have been
 provided at controlled rents, with cheap electricity and

 2.  AFTER WORKING HOURS
 Side by side with the rise in living standards goes a
 richer cultural and recreational life.  This has been part
 and parcel of the new life after liberation. Much was in-
 digenous and traditional.  The famous Peking Opera, of
 course, but also Shaohsing Opera, Ping Chu Opera, and
 other local operas..  Acrobatics, tumblers, puppets, street
 players-Peking was always rich in them, though they,
 too, had suffered, and some forms nearly died out.  Now
 they have new theatres, the arts are encouraged, and they
 mirror the old and the new, as they always did.
 There is a puppet theatre, built for children, but en-
 joyed also by adults. The old puppet players, their props
 hanging from two baskets on a bamboo pole, still give per-
 formances in the markets and hutung, but they also play
 in the puppet theatre.
 Theatres and cinemas are doing a roaring trade.  The
 "House Full" lights seem always to be up.      Peking's
 special contribution to the theatre, Peking Opera, is now
 world famous, and in great demand everywhere.  It was
 originally one of the many forms of folk opera.  It in-
 cludes many popular aspects of Chinese folk drama -
 acrobatics and tumbling, folk songs, folk tales, ballad sing-
 ers' stories - and has absorbed many distinctive forms
 and features from all over the place. It was a peasant art,
 and was introduced to Peking in the middle of the eight-
 eenth century, where it caught the fancy of the emper-
 or's family and court circle.  Later it came to be called
 Peking Opera.
 Peking Opera, in brief, is a synthesis of folk theatre.
 It is highly stylized, from the music, with its traditional
 instruments, the Chinese two-stringed fiddle, cymbals and

 piped water.  The handicraftsmen have got together into
 co-ops. Patched clothes are a rarity. For generations the
 children grew up in rags and spent most of their childhood
 among the rubbish heaps, looking for bits of coal, usable
 cinders, rags, and odds and ends of vegetables. They had
 to, if their families were to live at all. The discovery of a
 bent tin was often the cause of a fight. Today, when you
 see the children tumbling out of school, healthy and happy,
 going home to do their homework, no longer little old men
 and women before their time, when you see the chubby
 toddlers out in the sun with their grandpas and grannies,
 peaceful and serene, you can only remember with grief the
 little tramps in the streets who used to go hungry for
 days on end.
 The increase in general purchasing power in Peking
 hits you in the eye.  Under the Kuomintang except for a
 few shops dealing in luxuries ana catering for the rich
 only, the ordinary small "man and wife" shops were
 always on the verge of bankruptcy, even in famous shop-
 ping centres like those around Chien Men and in Wang Fu
 Ching Street.  But today it is a different picture.  The
 shops and book stores are thronged with customers, and
 on Sundays and holidays you can hardly move.      Before
 the big holidays shops of all kinds stay open late, and the
 supply of goods still cannot keep pace with demand.   In
 the first month after the new department store was opened
 in Wang Fu Ching Street, two million, customers bought
 over five million yuan worth of goods.
 There were many unemployed in Peking before libera-
 tion, but the figure is going down rapidly. By the end of
 1955, the Peking People's Council had found work for over
 .60,000 unemployed, and another 50,000 had found work
 themselves.  As industrialization gets under way, un-
 employment will be wiped out.

 bling and acrobatics, to the convention of movement, place
 and emotion. All is clone with consummate skill.
 Peking Opera is booming. Mei Lan-fang, who has been
 on the stage for fifty years, is the most famous actor-
 renowned for his actbig of feminine roles. There are other
 first-rate Peking Opera actors and actresses, perhaps just
 as versatile though not as popular, in the capital and all
 performances are packed with highly critical audiences.
 Peking audiences see the premieres of many plays put
 on in China. Playwrights and theatre companies like their
 plays to be shown in the capital - the galaxy of critics and
 writers who live in Peking help them to do their best, and
 also help them, by criticism, to perfect their works. Many
 modern plays have won success-Dragon Beard Ditch,
 The Long March, The Test, On the Komincr Steppes, and
 the popular play for children, Ma Lan Hua, to mention only
 a few. And famous foreign works from the Soviet Union
 and other countries, like The Inspector-General, Uncle
 Vanya, Julius Fucik and How the Steel Was Tempered
 have been performed in Chinese, and met with a great re-
 ception in Peking.
 It is not only Peking Opera or modern drama, however,
 which is shown in Peking. The national festivals of music,
 drama, folk arts of the theatre, all take place here.  The
 best artists of all China, the workers' amateur troupes,
 the minorities' representatives are all to be seen.
 There have been wonderful performances by folk
 artists-the Lion Dance, Donkey Dance, Drum Dance, Tea
 Pickers and the Butterfly, and so on, warmly welcomed by
 the audiences.
 With every encouragement from the government and
 the trade unions, amateur art is forging ahead. Many
 factories, mines and government officers have their own
 amateur dramatic and choral societies.  The Classical
 Song and Dance Group of the Changhsintien Railway Re-
 pair Works, for instance, is doing very well, and has put on
 Peking Opera with great success.  In an Amateur Music
 and Dance Festival held here, Peking was able to see the
 performances of other amateur groups.
 Peking audiences have a good chance of seeing the first
 performances in China of visiting cultural delegations and
 artists from many countries.    Swan Lake and Eugene
 Onegin by the Moscow State Arts Theatre Company (the
 famous Stanislavsky-Danchenko Theatre) left a deep im-
 pression on the Peking audience.  Performances from art-
 ists of sixteen nations have been seen here, from the Soviet
 Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic
 Republic, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, Yugo-
 slavia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Demo-
 cratic Republic of Vietnam  Mon( olio   India.   B

 "-?" ~?i~a.+?   uueit wonueriui performances, besides
 being first-class entertainment, help the Chinese to under-
 stand more about other countries.
 Sports and athletics are today nationally popular.
 Workers and peasants-who in the past never had a
 chance of such enjoyment-are now eagerly taking part.
 In this, too, Peking leads the way -its teams usually win
 in the inter-city and inter-organizational matches.  There
 are many public facilities for games-swimming pools,
 stadiums, gymnasiums, skating rinks - over and above
 those provided by individual organizations for their em-
 ployees.  Nearly all organizations provide facilities for
 basketball, net-ball, badminton, and other games from
 their welfare and trade union funds.  Records are con-
 stantly being broken. This is because of the facilities pro-
 vided for workers and peasants, who formerly had no
 chance at all to show their mettle and whose skill was un-
 known.
 Besides this there are the "unorganized" open-air en-
 joyments - swimming in the new swimming pools and in

 the lake at the Summer Palace - and boating in the lakes.
 These are summer amusements.  In the winter there are
 skating rinks on the frozen lakes. The parks are crowded
 on holidays and in the summer evenings, and the children's
 playgrounds ring with laughter all through the summer
 holidays. The big new gymnasiums are packed for the na-
 tional meetings. The largest of these so far were the
 Athletic, Meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
 in 1952 and the National Track and Field, Gymnastics and
 Cycling Meeting in 1953, but the international 'friendly
 contests are equally popular.  Peking has welcomed visit-
 ing athletes and gymnasts from many countries - the
 Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo-
 cratic Republic, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, the Demo-
 cratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Re-
 public of Vietnam, Mongolia, India and Burma.
 There is another traditional folk art which is well rep-
 resented in Peking-the  jugglers,  acrobats,  Chinese
 boxers and wrestlers, and weight lifters.  Before libera-
 tion they led a precarious life in the quarter of Peking that
 specializes in these arts - Tien Chiao, between Chien Men
 and the Temple of Agriculture. These Tien Chiao artists
 are famous throughout China - and now are famous
 abroad.  They played to packed houses everywhere when
 they went on tour abroad.
 As we have mentioned elsewhere, there are always ex-
 hibitions of one kind ti or another in Peking - drama, folk
 art, fine arts, puppet* theatre, shadow theatre, recent anti-
 quarian finds, ancient printed books, the Tunhuang murals,
 and so on. The Soviet Union, the People's Democracies in
 Eastern Europe and Asia, India and Indonesia have also
 presented exhibitions in Peking, the largest being the
 Economic. and Cultural Achievements of the Soviet Union,
 and Ten Years of Socialist Construction in Czechoslovakia.
 Both these were held in the Soviet Exhibition Centre.
 Amidst the new life, the old loves flourish.  Peking's
 citizens have a connoisseur's eye for landscape-gardening,
 trees and flowers and goldfish.  For countless years,
 Fengtai, a railway junction south of Peking city, has been
 known as the garden of Peking. All the parks and gardens
 are full of flowers in their seasons, and in Chungshan Park
 in the greenhouses, out of season as well. From the lilac
 and peonies, the wistaria of spring, through the gay flow-
 ers of summer to the chrysanthemums of autumn, flowers
 are grown and admired. Very few houses, even the small-
 est, have no flowers, if only in a flowerpot on the pave-
 ment.  The autumn chrysanthemum shows in Chungshan
 and Peihai Parks are a magnificent sight. The skill of the
 gardeners is only matched by the beauty of the flowers
 and the names of the varieties.  Thousands queue to see
 and buy these chrysanthemums. And nearly all the parks
 have a "garden" of goldfish.
 On Sundays and holidays citizens can go further afield
 - beyond the Summer Palace to the Western Hills, to the,
 Great Wall, or to the Ming Tombs.  Peking abounds in
 places of beauty, now freely open to its people.
 There is a saying:  "Once you live in Peking, you can-
 not leave it. If you do leave, you cannot forget it."

 WATER CONSERVANCY ACHIEVEMENTS IN NEW CHINA
 Our country stretches over various geographical regions, the major part being
 situated in the temperate and subtropical zones. It possesses fertile lands and plentiful
 products, and is traversed by numerous rivers with abundant water resources. Among the
 river basins, particularly those of the Yangtze, the Yellow, the Huai, the Pearl and the Sungari
 are the centres of our country's cultural and economical development.
 Our people have a long history in the development and utilization of water resources.
 For centuries, however, under feudalistic rules, especially under the combined oppression of
 imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat'i'c capitalism during the Kuomintang reactionary
 regime, the national economy was badly shattered, what had been achieved in water con-
 servancy was ruined owing to long years of negligence, and in consequence disastrous floods
 and droughts occurred frequently.
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party
 and the People's Government have paid much attention to water conservancy. During the
 period of national economic recovery and the period of socialist industrialization, the main
 tasks of water conservancy are to alleviate the disasters of flood and drought to insure a
 steady increase of agricultural production, and to promote the development of industry and
 river navigation. According to incomplete statistical figures up to June of 1955, more than
 4,200 million cub._ m. of earthwork were done, 32 million cub. m. of masonry laid and
 1,140,000 cub. m. of concrete placed. These great achievements have helped effectively in
 the diminution of-flood and drought. damages, played an important role in. the increase of
 agricultural production, and laid a firm foundation for the further development of water
 conservancy.
 Among our river projects now being carried on, that of the Huai River is the largest
 in scale and extent, with 5 reservoirs and 15 flood detention basins already completed and
 2 additional 'reservoirs under construction. In the.middle reaches of the Huai River, a flood
 control regulator has been constructed at Jenhochi. In the lower reaches, the Sanho Regulator
 has been constructed, and a main irrigation canal has been dug, in the northern part of
 Kiangsu Province from the Hungtze Lake to the Yellow Sea. Besides, dikes have been con-
 structed along the main water course and the tributaries, channels have been dredged, and
 the land drainage works are being under way.

 On the Yellow River, a great plan for the permanent control and unified development
 of the Yellow River has been prepared with the aid of Soviet experts, and has been ap-
 proved by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress.  Alongside of
 preparing for a valley development project 130 million cub. m. of earthwork have been
 done on the 1,800 km. dike system. Besides, flood detention basins have been constructed
 to cope with floods of 1933 magnitude. For the development of irrigation, People's Victory
 Canal has been built.
 On the Yangtze River, in addition to the strengthening of all (likes, a ,huge Chinkiang
 Flood Diversion Basin has been built on its middle reaches.
 In the Hai River system, the Kuanting Reservoir has been completed on the Yung-
 ting River, some channel improvement has been made on the Taching and Tzeya rivers,
 and a flood escape channel leading to the sea has been constructed.
 Together with river development projects, farm irrigation works have been carried on
 extensively in the vast plains and hilly regions. Among them, millions of canals, ponds, wells
 and pumping stations have been constructed, which serve a newly added irrigated area of
 over 83,000,000 morr
 The severe floods of 1954 proved the effectiveness of these works, notably those of
 Huai River and Chinkiang, all of which functioned satisfactorily according to plan, and
 protected many cities and vast farms from inundation and ensured the normal operation
 of the important railroads.
 The above-mentioned are but the great beginning of the water conservancy construc-
 tions in new China.  With the victorious progress of our socialist construction, water
 conservancy has been given a broad future for development. The agricultural mutual-aid co-
 operative movement have given more strength to the farmers, enabling them to carry out a
 wide variety of farm irrigation works. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
 Party and the People's Government, we are pursuing a policy according to which both
 water and land resources are to be systematically exploited and emergency and long-range
 measures are to be fully co-ordinated, to diminish flood and drought damages, and to
 develop step by step the water resources of the large rivers-the Yellow River, the Yangtze
 River, the Huai River, and the Pearl River-to push our industry and agriculture forward.

 THE REGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 HAI RIVER SYSTEM
 The Yungting River of the Hai River system is also a river in China which
 hich is being
 and developed.
 This river, known as the "Little Yellow River", has its sources on
 the southern slope
 of the Mongolian plateau and the hilly region of northern

 River) into its present name "Yungting River" (literally die "Ever-rest-

 resting for ever, but kept on inundating an area from 300 to 2,000 sq. km. In 1917 and
 again in 1939, flood water of the Yungting and Taching rivers s invaded the city of Tientsin,

 LAND MELIORATION
 While river harnessing works are being carried on, land melioration works are also
 progressing on a vast scale.
 During the past few years, 9,230,000 irrigation canals and ponds have been improved
 or dug, more than 250 major irrigation systems restored or constructed and a million wells
 drilled. Through these measures, we gain a total irrigated area of over 83,000,000 neon, not
 including that on which irrigation has been improved. This figure equals to about one
 fifth of the total accumulated irrigated area during the past thousands of years in our
 history.
 Land melioration is mainly private undertakings done with government aid in
 consideration of the local needs. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Govern-
 ment not only render effective organisational leadership to such work, but also make big loans
 every year to the farmers to help them solve their financial difficulties. The major projects
 are carried out with. government investments. Furthermore, power irrigation and power
 drainage have also gained considerable progress with a total increase in pump capacity amount-
 ing to 53,000 horsepower. As for the already existing irrigation systems, their administration
 work has been improved, regulations have been established, progressive irrigation methods
 like furrow method and border method introduced, and measures for the utilization of
 irrigation water in a planned, way have been practiced in connection with soil melioration to
 check alkalization.
 Soil conservation is also an essential part of land melioration. The building of
 1,800,000 check dams in co-ordination with afforestation has begun to change the natural
 features of the mountaineous regions and loess-deposit plateaus, and plays an important part
 in the checking of erosions.
 Accompanying the progress of the mutual-aid co-operative movement in agricultural
 production, die peasants become more enthusiastic in the development of production, and thus
 the land melioration works are advancing by leaps and bounds.
