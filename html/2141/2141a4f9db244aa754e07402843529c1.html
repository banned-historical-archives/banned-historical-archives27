 Cuba's Sugar-Coated Economic Chaos
 Although there have been complaints that the economic
 boycott against Cuba is hurting the trade of some free coun-
 tries, for others it is a blessing in disguise.  The election
 of prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies has been attributed in
 part to the sudden increase in prosperity in the sugar-pro-
 ducing territory of Queensland.  With most of Cuba's sugar
 going to Communist Bloc countries, and international quotas
 no longer in force, queensland has increased the production
 of sugar from 1,400,000 tons in 1931 to 1,950,000 in 1033,
 with the prospect of raising this to 2,135,000 tons in 1964.
 In fact, all sugar-producing countries of the free world
 have profited by the present Cuban-created situation, sell-
 ing more sugar and at higher prices -- up to 11 cents U.S.
 per pound.   Cuba, on the other hand, as a result of Castro's
 wildly erratic economic policies, is producing less sugar
 and selling it at lower prices.  Under a bi-lateral barter
 agreement, Cuba is exporting 1,000,000 tons of sugar to the
 Soviet Union in 1933.  Of this total, 100% will be exchanged
 for other goods at the rate of C cents per pound, and 20%
 will be sold for hard currency at 4 cents per pound.   All
 sugar that Cuba exports to other bloc countries is exchanged
 for barter at a cents per pound.
 Ile do not wish to present the above in such a way as
 to ma?=_e it look as though the sugar-producing countries of
 Latin America, for example, are profiting by the misfortune
 of the Cuban people.  However, Cuba's economic plight today
 serves as a good case history of how Communist mismanagement
 can bring economic ruin to the most prosperous country.
 Further, in the market vacuum created by Cuba, other sugar-
 producing countries of the world are building vested inter-
 ests in increased production.  Therefore, if Cuba continues
 to pursue its present Communist-dictated economic policies --
 which it undoubtedly will Co as long as Castro is in power it stands a good chance of losing its old sugar markets
 permanently.

 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 1.  The struggle in world Communism during this period
 focused on Warsaw, where representatives of the major parties
 fought a bitter  mutually damaging  5-day battle before more than
 400 delegates from  O-some coup rtes assemo a   or a meeting of
 the World Peace Council:   see detailed account in Chronology,
 November-?ecem er      The Soviets succeeded in marshaling an
 overwhelming majority in support o    eir pos   on on peace, cap-
 a a iz ng par  cu arly on their popular initiative on the test-
 ban treaty, -- with only the Chinese  Albanians tThNorth Koreans,
 forth Vietnamese  ana Japanese in o position.       e  n onesjans
 made speeches on the Chinese side bu   ai a to follow through
 with their votes.)  however, the nature of the bitter recrimina-
 tions, the refusal of the dissenters to accept the majority de-
 claration and the absence of many delegates from the voting matte
 the value of this Soviet "victory" rather doubtful.
 2.  Meanwhile, the official Rumanian acceptance of Yugo-
 slavia slavia as a full-fledged socialist state, spelled out in ajo
 communique which concerned economic agreements for the most part
 (Chrono, Nov. 30), tended further to counter Chinese offorts to
 stig:iatize "the Tito clique."
 3.  While the Chinese press continued to carry "routine"
 polemical materials and press reports supporting their line, the
 Soviet press continued to play down the dispute:   in tact, the
 first Soviet mention of Chinese obstructiveness and attacks at
 the WPC meeting came in ?ravda and Izvestiya articles on Dec-
 amber 3, alter its conclusion.  A 9,     wora' ?ravda article on
 the 3rd anniversary of the 31-party Moscow con erence (Chrono,
 Dec. 6) -- although it calls in calm language for discussion of
 zontroversial questions in "the normal channel of inter-party
 relations" and an end to open polemics "to ;neat more favorable
 con;itions for the convocation of a new conference" -- seems
 like a throw-bac?k to the 39 March CPSU letter to the CC'_?.   It
 iL1ies that it is up to the Chinese (without ever naming thee)
 to restore unity by correcting their erroneous views and refrain-
 ing frori their harmful activities
 Z-.  Reports (by NCNA) from Melbourne and Colombo indicate
 that pro-Chinese dissidents in Australia and Caylon are moving
 ciosar to the establishment of organized parties.   (Chrono, Tlov-
 eaber 23, December 3 and 4).

 Ny Dag of November 9,doscribed in our last installment, has been
 =owed up by three further letters, one of which expresses
 partial agreement, while the other two, including one by veteran
 party boss Hagber, rebut without engaging in any personal attack.

 translations of these articles were carried in the following
 numbers, of the series Translations on International Communist
 Developments;  the Nov. 9 article in No. 536, JPRS: 22,130 dtd

 Significance:
 There has been no further reliable information regarding
 prospects for Sino-Soviet bilateral talks or a world Communist
 meeting, but the developments at the Warsaw WPC meeting might
 be taken as a possible clue to the future.  Here the Soviets
 found the most favorable conditions they might ever expect for
 an international conference (infact, the Chinese delegation
 alone voted against the resolution for holding the Warsaw meet-
 ing when the WPC Presidium not in Vienna, 27-29 Sept. according
 to a report in the Indian Cn weekly New Age on 13 Oct.), i.e.:
 a.   Of all the issues in dispute, the Soviet
 position is by far the strongest and most
 popular on "peace," especially since the
 opposition to the test-ban treaty and their
 attack on the Indian border;
 b.   The UPC "apparat" has depended heavily on
 Soviet financial support; and
 c.   The meeting was held in "friendly" (to the
 Soviets) territory.
 Nevertheless, the Soviets, torn between their desire to bring
 the dissenters to heel and their need to maintain at least a
 semblance of unity, were unable to maintain their absolute con-
 trol over the W?C and had to be satisfied with a statement ac-
 cepted only by a majority, while the Chinese divulged to the
 world the texts of the two minority statements and the score of
 the voting.

 (5` 13' Cont.)
 We can conclude frori the lossOnS of the Warsaw TIM meeting
 and other recent developments (e.g. the resolution of the Italian
 C'..-, COL ITTAt2W #15 and 3PG #717) that the chances for a new world
 conference of all Communist parties are very dim indeed -- unless
 the Soviets would capitulate, in fact, before the peremptory de-
 mands of ?cuing.  Apparently the two contestants cannot even
 agree on the rules for the contest:   the Chinese insist on una-
 nimity for all decisions, the Soviets on majority votes.  More-
 over $ at sucLk a conference, the Chinese -- focusing their ar u-
 ients on world ro  ].ut?on, national liberation mover ents etc. -
 -would be in a zuch better position than at the      meeting where
 their rejection of the test ban treaty cast them, into a :lost dif-
 ficult role.
 We, therefore, assn; a that i1oscow can restore any wor tin
 unity of the '1CT   on terms acceptable to the present Kremlin
 leadership only if the Soviets either
 a.   return to Stalinist methods of discipline,
 by using military force, I:idnappings, as-
 sassinations etc. against Communist dis-
 santers; or
 b.   abanc'on tie increasingly meaningless fetish
 of "international proletarian solidarity,"
 acknowledge that they pursue objectives
 (both dozaestic and international) basically
 different fro,:i those of the Chinese and
 reorganize a new international alliance on
 their terms, cli:ainating the Chinese and
 their followers.
 Since no tlier development is li%ely in the for seeable ft.turo, 11ve
 do :lot expect a genuine restoration of unity in the W'TCIVI, at least
 for the time being.

 #13                                       23 November-6 December 1963
 November 23 - An Mongolian Party organ Unen editorial reiterates
 full support of the     J and denounces tM7adventurists and op-
 portunists, crudely distorting truth...(and) attempting... to dis-
 credit the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine."  Every M-L party
 must "give a crushing blow to the dogmatists, sectarians, and
 other apostates."
 November 24 - Peking gg-c   .quotes extensively from the Albanian
 ..opulli     Tovember denunciation of Tito, Khrushchev and
 company.
 November 25 - Peking papers give front-page prominence to a con-
 ference of the Department of Philosophy and Social Science of
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences -- under the self-explanatory
 heading "Oppose Modern Revisionism, Study Contemporary Revolu-
 tionary Questions."  Poking press also features a resqlution of
 the CP of New Zealand reiterating its stand that revision sm is
 the main danger to the movement.  The French and Belgian CPs
 simultaneously publish a joint communique strongly denouncing
 the Peking line and urging that s-"peps betaken to convene and
 insure the success of a conference of world Communist parties
 which would "reaffirm the general line of the International Com-
 munist movement in the light of new developments."  (AFP)
 November 26 - Peking press prominently plays a press release of
 t o  n onesian     s CC featuring Chairman tiidit s remarks in a
 12 November speech in -Djakarta:   he called for con inu na efforts
 to "crush" revistetmism, "a poison which weakens the anti-imperial-
 ist struggle," an                  pointed out that "armed struggle remains a
 salient feature of the people's struggle in the southeast Asian
 countries."
 November 27 - All Chinese papers feature an article from the
 December issue of the monthly literary journal Wen Yi Pao (The
 Literary Gazette) (published the 26th) which criticized as re-
 visionist three recent Soviet films and some statements made by
 their director, G. Chunkhrai.   "The smell of bourgeois humani-
 tarianism and pacifism spread by the films shows, in the field
 of art and ideology, precisely the political line of modern re-
 visionism and the political demand for peaceful evolution from
 socialism to capitalism."
 November 23 - People's Daily (and other  Peking press) publishes
 an 11 November "Declaration of Australian Marxist-Leninists,"
 with an editor's note explaining that it is'h reply of E.F. Sill
 and other comrades to the attack and vilification by the open
 letter of the CC/CPSU."  The (Chinese) editor continues:   "'It
 can be clearly seen from this reply that it is none other than
 the C?SU leaders who have actually violated the principles guid-
 ing relations of the fraternal parties and adopted extremely
 foul methods in imposing a revisionist line on a fraternal party,
 interfering in its internal affairs, attacking the Marxist-
 Leninists with the party, and creating an internal split in it."

 The Declaration itself gives a historical account of developments
 in "the deep-seated plot" of the CP$U leaders "to subvert the CPA
 to the line of the modern revisioniS s~ , in the course ox wfhic na
 they "tried alternately to intimidate, bribe, and flatter the
 leaders of the CPA."  It con rasts   a capitulation to   e CPSU's
 campaign by Sharkey and Dixon with "Hill's brilliant record of
 almost 30 years service of the Australian working class."
 November 23-December 2 - The Warsaw meeting of the World Peace
 Council brought another round of     er,   cn clashe'    ue weep
 the Chinese challengers and the Soviet-aligned majority, -- be-
 fore an assemblage reported (by Tass:  sessions were barred to
 the press) to consist of "close to 45011 delegates from more than
 30 countries, and also representatives of 13 international organ-
 izations.  Trouble broke out early in the first session:  here
 is HCIIA's account --
 Jadqued M .daule, a French Catholic.,.,lauded the
 a'sSassinated President of the U.S., John F. Kennedy,
 and paid "respects" to him for his "good will."...
 He even proposed that all stand up to observe a
 moment's silence in memory of Kennedy....The pro-
 posal was dictated by a handful of people anm-
 posed on the meeting as a suprise attack carefully
 thought out and arranged in advance.   It was an at-
 tempt to glorify the bbsses of U.S. imperialism in
 the same of the meeting....
 A Chinese delegate, Tan Ming-chao, at once in-
 dignantly voiced his opposition to the proposal and
 asked for the floor to protest against this shameful
 move.  But the executive chairman of the session, Ostap
 Dluski of Poland, turned down his legitimate request.
 Thereupon, delegates from China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan,
 Indonesia, the National Liberation Front of South
 Vietnam, Albania, and some European countries sat still
 and refused to observe the silence.  Some other dele-
 gations who had learned of the move in advance left
 the meeting hall before the proposal.
 Alter prolonged consultations, the executive
 chairman finally agreed that Tang Ming-chao speak
 briefly at the session....T. said:   'file could not be
 sincere to all the friends taking part in this meet-
 in, nor would we be honest to ourselves, if vie do
 not raise our voice in protest against the proposal
 to pay td ibute suddenly imposed on us in a prepared
 speech...."
 The delegates in the hall listened quietly and
 seriously to  his  statement.   His suggestion that the
 meeting pay tribute to the martyrs who fall in the
 fight against U.S. imperialism drew loud applause.
 Delegates from many countries walked up to the
 Chinese delegate to praise and greet him.  The U.S.
 delegates, first of all, shook  hands with him and

 other Chinese delegates with great warmth.  They
 exclaimed in one voice:  "Your statement is excel-
 lent."
 NCNA further reported that the Japanese and N. Vietnamese
 delegations protested the move in written statements to the
 presidium the following day.   On Dec. 1st, the N. Korean dele-
 gation ebief in a speech denounced the move as "a, disgrace to
 the WPC, and an indelible stain on the peace movement."
 The Chinese speaker on the afternoon of the opening day,
 Liao Chang-chih, delivered a hard 5,000-word exposition of the
 Chinese line, including a denunciation of the "certain persons"
 who viciously assail and libel all those who do not agree with-
 their erroneous line and who have recently "gone so far as to
 mat:a use of the name of the VIPC Secretariat, the VIPC Bulletin,
 the  ?C delegations, etc., and even of a forged letter allegedly
 from the Chinese :.people's Committee for World Peace  n an all-
 out assault on the Chinese people's just stand on defending world
 Peace. 11
 Among other speakers on the 29th was Spano of Italy, who,
 according to NCITA, "acted as an apologist for the  T.S. imperial-
 ist policy of aggression and war, while distorting and attac:ing
 the stand tai.on by the Chinese delegation for world peace."  He
 cias followed by the Indian delegate, Lrora, who "actually used
 the platform for work peace to make political provocations a-
 gainst China over the Sino-Indian border issuo,;.,,.All those re-
 were astonishingly similar to the themes of Moscow.
 After group discussions on 29 and 30 November, the plenary
 sessions resumed on 1 Deceraber, when, according to NCNA,
 "the delegates of Korea, Albania, Vietnam and Indonesia
 held aloft the banner of opposing; imperialism and de-
 fending world peace, denounced as a fraud the tripartite
 partial tost-ban treaty, and censured the modern re-
 visionists for their ignoble actions of prettifying
 and submitting to imperialism.  The delegates of prance,
 Bul :aria, Czechoslovalia and Zungar,, acting on ordors
 of the baton, advanced lane excuses to defend the Mos-
 cow tripa'titito treaty and justify the :modern revision-
 ists' actions of bogging immporialisu for peace.  By
 na:ao or by insinuation, they attr_c':ed China and other
 c:cfond ors of world peace."
 The Bulgarian rtielegate ?irinsi y, according to 11CHA, "slandered
 the position of China, Korea and Albania" on the Moscow treaty,
 and  "what  was :::ost absurd, ...went so far as to say that the
 treaty was 'signed by Chiang Ilai-shek' because China did not sign
 it.   ::ls statement aroused ina'igation and sneers a~ong the dele-

 In view of the highly technical nature of modern warfare,
 the purpose of this law is obviously not to add several hundred
 thousand untrained draftees to the present armed effectives.
 (We should not forget the enormous quantity of highly sophisti-
 cated weapons that have been shipped to Cuba.)  As summarized
 and expounded by Raul Castro, it seems to have three purposes:
 a)  Primarily, to provide an abundance of
 cheap labor.
 b)  Secondarily, to put additional thousands
 under military discipline without at the

 off the street and put tnem to work.
 Nowhere does the text of the now law refer to any but its
 purely military, national defense purposes.            However, as if
 under some Freudian compulsion, Raul Castro returned frequently
 to these hidden aims.  The armed forces, he said, have an
 obligation to help the economic production of the nation, there-
 fore,                    .  .  .   "vie ought to work, part of our service in sugarcane,
 to which we can devote three or four months.           .  .    We will have
 other jobs to do.  One of these will be coffee.        Then we will
 have to go and pick coffee beans, the socialized coffee beans
 of the people, of the state, and at the same time help the
 entire private sector of our peasants, setting an example by
 our work on behalf of the consolidation of the worker-peasant
 alliance of our socialist revolution."
 Without the least compunction, Raul Castro gives examples
 later in this speech of how the labor shortage in Cuba has
 brought about the system of "volunteer" labor brigades.  Now,
 it seems, even this system makes the cost of coffee production
 prohibitive.   Although the volunteers are paid on an incentive
 basis, at 55 centavos per tin of 28 lbs. of coffee beans gatherer.
 plus room  and board, efficiency is so low that the average wage
 is less than one peso per day.   Likewise, since rationing has
 vastly reduced the real value of money, many coffee pickers go
 along for the food and sometimes extra clothing they receive.
 All this, as Raul Castro put it, has required a second look at
 the costeabilidad of coffee growing in a socialist system.  That

 724 FE,NE.  The Formation of the Federation of Malaysia
 BAC!'GROUND:   On September 16, 1963 the Federation of
 Malaysia came into being.  This anti-Communist grouping is
 comprised of four Southeast Asian territories:   the former
 Federation of Malaya, a constitutional, parliamentary monarchy;
 Singapore, a semi-autonomous state; and Sarawak and North Borneo,
 both former British Crown Colonies.  The formation of Malaysia
 has created new controversies in the already tense situation
 in Southeast Asia.  What is the history of the Malaysian con-
 ception and why has it aroused such emotional controversy?
 Tunku Rahman proposal:   On 27 May 1961, Malayan Prime
 Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman met with the Foreign Correspondents
 Association of Southeast Asia at a luncheon in Singapore and
 in informal post-luncheon remarks he said:
 "Sooner or later Malaya should have an understanding
 with Britain and the peoples of Singapore, North
 Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak.   It is premature for me
 to say now how this closer understanding can be
 brought about, but it is inevitable that we should
 look ahead to this objective and think of a plan
 whereby these territories can be brought closer to-
 gether in political and economic cooperation."
 "'his was not a completely new idea, but it was the first time
 that it had been proposed publicly.   In spite of the vagueness
 of Tunku Rahmants proposal, concrete plans soon began to take
 shape.  Two months later (July 1931) the Malaysia Solidarity
 Consultative Committee was formed and this group of leading
 individuals from the five territories began to study the
 feasibility of the suggestion and to develop plans to reconcile
 conflicting local interests and requirements.  Progress continued
 at a rapid pace and in the Autumn of 1961 the Tunku went to
 L.Dneon to consult with the British government.  On 23 November,
 agreement in principle was reached with prime Minister MacMillan
 on the advisability of creating Malaysia.  The agreement
 included provision for appointing a commission to determine, on
 the spot, the wishes of the people of North Borneo and Sarawak,
 and to seen the views of the Sultan of Brunei.
 The Cobbold Commission (so named after its chairman,
 Lord Cobbold) went, to Saraw   and North Borneo in February 1962
 and interviewed several thousand private individuals, consulted
 the Legislative Councils in the two Colonies, and reviewed
 numerous memoranda from various groups and individuals in the
 territories.  The Commission also visited Brunei and consulted
 the Sultan and his Ministers.   In June 1962 the Cobbold Com-
 mission's report was completed and signed.   It summarized the
 problems involved in setting up the federation, made a series
 of unanimous recommendations and included separate recommendations

 by the British and the Malayan representatives.   Subsequently,
 there were e:.ten ive ncgetiattions on indi.vidr' I:?'herties,
 religious freedom, :  .ttsf~ of native peoples, o ucation, rural
 improvement, financ.: and trade, immigration control and repre-
 sentation in the Federation parliament.  Meanvwhile, the Tunku
 and wingapore's Prime Minister Lee Muan Yew had reached agree-
 ment on the terms of a merger of Singapore and Malaya anad their
 agreement was upheld by a referendum in Singapore in September
 1002.
 In July 19:3, four of the territories signed the formal
 agreement providing for the inauguration of the Federation of
 Malaysia on 31 August 1963.  Brunei had backed out at the last
 minute in a dispute over finances and issues related to the
 precedence of the Sultan among the new leadership.
 Foreign Opposition to Malaysia:   As the members of the
 proposed federation negotiated an  it became increasingly
 apparent that they would succeed in coming to terms, the govern-
 ments of Indonesia and the Philippines showed increasing concern
 and opposition.   In December 1962 antagonisms and hostilities
 reached a critical point.  The Brunei People's Party (Partai
 Ra'_yjat Brunei), led by A.M. Azahari, was vigorously opposed to
 the formation of Malaysia.  They favored the creation of a
 unified state consisting of North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei.
 The Brunei People's Party under Azahari had been influential
 in organizing a small rebel force called the "North Borneo
 National Army"   (TNKU).  On December B these rebel forces
 attacked several towns and oil fields in Brunei and Sarawak,
 and attempted to seize control of the area.  British troops were
 flown in from Singapore and by December 12 the revolt had for
 all effective purposes collapsed.  Azahari fled to Manila and
 thence to Indonesia.   Indonesia denied involvement although it
 had gone on record as supporting the objectives of the short-
 lived rebellion and had oven covertly assisted in training some
 of the rebel units.   In January 1963 Indonesia announced its
 policy of confrontation toward the formation of Malaysia.
 President Sukarno, of course, was the architect of this policy of
 menacing every aspect of the proposed federation and its
 supporters.  When Tunku Rahman refused to be intimidated and
 Afro-Asian circles failed to give any meaningful support, he
 abandoned that policy temporarily and on 31 May staged a recon-
 ciliation with Tunku Rahman.
 The Indonesian, Malayan, and Philippine foreign ministers
 met in Manila in June to pave the way for a meeting of their
 respective chiefs of state to seek a formula for agreement on
 the disputed issues.  President Sukarno, Prime Minister Abdul
 Rahman, and ?resident Macapagal then conferred in Manila in
 early )ugust.   Sukarno immediately made a series of demands that
 would have completely upset the Malaysia timetable; the Tunku
 refused to meet them.  Their differences were mediated by
 President Macapagal and the stormy conference finally ended with
 agreement that U.N. Secretary General U Thant would be requested
 to make a quick assessment of whether the peoples of North Borneo
 and Sarawak were really in favor of Malaysia.

 U Thant appointed a team of nine assessors (all of the
 disputants approved U Thant's choices) which proceeded immediately
 to the area, accompanied by two Indonesians, two Malayans, and
 two =Filipinos who had been invited as observers.     In accepting
 the Manila Conference's request for assistance the Secretary
 General made a strict condition that the findings of the U.N.
 team were not subject to confirmation by any of the governments
 concerned.  On 14 September U Thant released the report of the
 U.N. survey team which concluded that a clear majority of the
 people in Sarawak and North Borneo were in favor of Malaysia.
 Indonesia and the Philippines contended that the U.I.T. survey
 had not been carried out in accordance with the Manila agreements
 and refused to recognize the new federation.
 The policy of confrontation was immediately renewed and
 anti-Malaysian rioting -- encouraged, if not actually planned,
 by the Indonesian government -- took place throughout Indonesia.
 L mob sacked and burned the British   bassy in Djakarta on
 10 September and almost all other British and Malayan diplomatic
 and privately owned property was systematically looted and
 burned.   Indonesia cut off commercial and communications links
 with Malaysia and sent additional combat ready troops to the
 borders of Sarawak and North Borneo.  With the passage of time,
 the more frantic and delirious aspects of Indonesia's confronta-
 tion policy have subsided somewhat but the basic hostility
 remains, primarily in the form of the economic boycott of
 Malaysia and the support and training of anti-Malaysian guerrillas
 in Borneo.  The Philippine government has recently modified its
 position considerably and has even shown signs that it may
 recognize Malaysia if it can be done gracefully.
 Reasons for Indonesian Hostility:  Throughout the dispute
 over the formation of the  a aysian federation, Indonesia has
 cited two main contentions for its opposition to the Federation:
 First, it is an instrument of Great Britain and a tool for con-
 tinuing British colonialism in Southeast Asia.   Second, it is
 too small and weak to withstand pressure and the threat of being
 taken over by the Chinese Communists.  A third factor in the
 dispute is that Sukarno feels, and indeed has said, that the
 forces behind the formation of Malaysia thin': they can settle
 matters that concern Indonesia without even consulting Indonesia
 and that they must be taught otherwise.   It is generally conceded
 that the latter factor is an important one, perhaps the important
 one and that Sukarno has not been able to conceal his own
 aspirations to see an Indonesian empire stretch from Malaya to
 the northern tip of the Philippine Islands

 CULTURAL EXC EATTGE
 Almost immediately after the death of Joseph Stalin in
 March 1253, his successors proclaimed that they favored the "free
 development of contacts" between the Soviet Union and all other
 countries.  Partly in response to the Soviet "cultural offensive"
 the term "cultural diplomacy," came into increasing use in the
 West to describe exchanges of persons, particularly those of sci-
 on;i.fic eminence, and of cultural materials, conducted with po-
 ? t  e' ob4ectives or at least, with an awareness of their possible political
 consequences.
 In terms of human and financial resources involved, the
 e. fort with which we are here concerned represents a new dimeu-
 sio n of the : re :din's diplomacy and propaganda.  In its ultimate
 purposes, however, it is squarely in the revolutionary Lenin
 tradition which Xhrushch?ev sought to revive after his discredit-
 ing of Stalinism in 1953.   It also bears many :marks of the heri -
 tc:;e of Stalin, who himself, especially before the great purges
 0f  1Z3e-33, was an energetic practitioner of cultural diplomacy.
 Many of Stalin's actions reflected his belief that the dis-
 play of Soviet achievements to foreign visitors in the USSR, or
 to all who were interested abroad, was of ;great political siunifi-
 ca.ace .   EEe often interrupted his busy schedule to play host to
 delegations of labor leaders, arti  c and literary f gores, and
 other foreign notables.  !Sot infrequently he took the trouble to
 receive individually such personages as R.G. Wells, George 3ez   d.
 Shaw, Emil Ludwig, Lion uFeuchtwanger, and many others.   In a
 statement to the 14th Congress of the Russian Communist ?arty in
 Stalin revealed   a, basic motive for this policy.  hie told the
 Congress  that  visits of groups from India,    ypt, and China, as
 well as of delegations of workers from the W , .. constituted "the
 best, most forceful and active propaganda for the Soviet system
 against the capitalist system."  In a somewhat similar vein,
 Z-hrushchev, during his visit to the United States in Sept. 13531
 professed a desire for "the .;:oadest possible cultural and sci-
 entific exchange" between Russia and America, and linked such ex-
 change to peaceful competition between rival social systems.
 In 102"7, V? KS, the A.ll-Union Society for Cultural Relations
 with Foreign Countries, was established.   In Feb. 1053, VOI>S dis-
 solved itself and was replaced by the Union of Soviet Societies
 for Friendship and Cultural t`.elations with foreign Countries.
 Although Soviet sources stated that the meth ds employed by VGL`s
 had. become outmode~dd, there appears to be no essential d ffereace
 between  its activities and those of  its successor  organization
 which, li'::e VC;KS , is officially described as a "voluntary, public
 cganization" and is carefully distinguished in Sovietteriminolo;;y
 from such state agencies as the 111instry of Foreign Affairs or the
 t >~,e Committee for Cultural Relations with hood eign Countries,
 ec abolished in l v.7.  Like VOKS,  the Union of Friendship Societies
 operates mainly on a nominally nongovernmental level.   It invites
 sari: t: c, literary, and sometimes, scientific delegations to visit
 the. USSR and arranges for formal meetings between such groups and

 Soviet colleagues.   it also is active in the dissemination of
 Soviet publications to forai n schclars and intellectuals.
 The State Co--maittee for Cultural Relations with Foreign
 Countries, to the chairmanship of which Georgy A. Zhulov, former
 Pravda foreign editor, was appointed upon its establishment,
 played a major role in Xhrushchev's expansion of cultural di-
 plomacy.  The State Committee has negotiated a number of cul-
 tural agreements and treaties with foreign countries, including
 the United itingciom (1059). the German Federal Republic, India,
 France,  the United Arab Republic, and Afghanistan.  Of pa rticula.r
 interest to A;:ierica ns is the United States-Soviet Agreement on
 educational, Scientific and Cultural Exchanges, signed in Jan.
 / 3, and extended for two years in Dec. x.95'::.   In addition to
 negotiating over-all agreements, the State Committee takes a
 hang' in negotiation of i ipor tant individual cultural exchanges,
 ~~orhi~hg often with other Soviet agencies, such as the Ministry
 of Culture.
 Another organization which plays an important part in the
 Soviet system of guided culture contact is Intourist, the offici:.2.
 tourist agency.  Founded in 1923,as one of several Soviet-style
 "joint stow." companies, and still so organized, intourist had,
 as of 1'57, some five thousand employees, according to an article
 in the Soviet English language magazine for Americans, USSR.   Its
 staff has probably grown considerably since then, if one can as-
 sume some proportionality between its size and the swelling di-
 mensions of tourist travel to the USSR.   In the case of the United
 States, fox example, about 2,500 tourists visited the Soviet Union
 in l0-55, while estimates for 1060 were in the neighborhood of
 2 U, 000.  With its netrwork of hotels and restaurants and its staffs
 of interpreters, chauffeurs, and so forth, Intourist has shep-
 herded and guided, served, helped, and sometimes obstructed.? thou-
 sands of foreign tourists, teachers, students, businessmen, and
 others who have over the years come to the "land of socialism"
 to observe, to marvel, or to compare impressions based on printed
 sources with whatever aspects of Soviet reality they were able to
 see and appraise for themselves.  Lost foreign visitors to Russia,
 with the exception of such categories as diplomats and journalist:.
 on long-term assignmments, gust use the facilities of intourist by
 virtue of its :monopoly control over indispensable services.  With
 the recovery of the Soviet economy from the effects of World  War
 II and  the partial xae pening of the USSR to foreign contact that
 follovied Stalin's death,  the services of Latour ist were e aYha:l, ed
 and improved.  l owever, it is fair to say that the Soviet system
 of official tourism of which Intourist is a part still serves to
 render travel in Russia highly restricted by free world standards
 The consequences of this situation, in terms of concealing aspen
 of Soviet life which the Kremlin doe: not wish to disclose, are
 of course significant if, as is usually the case, foreign visi-
 t-ors do not have a vor.ing l.nowles;e of the Russian language.
 he main professed purpose of Soviet culture exchange policy
 has always been the "struggle for peace."  For example, TTi?kolr.y
 T; i vhaylov, Soviet minister of culture, wrote in Pravda for

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000200040004-3
 April 2,1956,that"the development of cultural relations between
 the Soviet Union and Great Britain will undoubtedly contribute
 to the nobel aims, coririon to both peoples, of consolidating
 peace." It is significant also that the posy-Stalin cultural
 campaign was launched in June 1953, at the Budapest meeting of
 the major international con.nmunist-front organization, the World
 '3o--ce Council, which has continued to coordinate its activities
 with those of the Soviet cultural apparatus.  This aspect of
 Soviet cultural diplomacy appears to be intended to strengthen
 the desired i:maga of the USSR and the Soviet bloc in general as
 champions of peace, while at the same time casting the United
 States in the role of chief warmonger.  Furtherance of Soviet
 disarmament policy and hindrance of American defense efforts are
 corollary themes of much of the Soviet propaganda disseminated
 in connection v:ith major Communist cultural exchange projects,
 suck, as the mai moth I:Ioscow Festival of Youth and Students (1057)
 an  t_e next in this series, held in Vienna in 1059....
 Although Moscowbras devoted less of its cultural resources
 to the underdeveloped countries than to W1 Europe and the United
 States, it is perhaps in the less industrialized lands that
 Soviet cultural diplomacy has the greatest potential for future
 influence.  Africa and Latin &aarica have not been neglected by
 the   Iat esmlin cultural strategists.  Be-inning in 1055 the Soviet
 authorities undertoo% a revival of Oriental studies which led
 to development of a substantial, growing program of te.-ching
 and research on the history, languages and literatures, and the
 econoic and political conditions of the peoples of the non-
 in:;ustrialized countries.  At both the 20th Congress of the C 2,3,U
 in 1053 an:1 the Extraordinary 21st Congress in 1953 such top-
 ranking party Presidium members as, respectively, Anas:t. s LIii:oynn
 and i:iiI hail Suslov demanded that Soviet scholars produce works
 which viould be useful in carrying the Soviet message to these
 areas .
 The visit by Nikita S. Khrushchev and Nikolay Bul;anin to
 Inc:in, Burma, and Afghanistan in 1955 and .hrushchevts visit
 in 159 to Indonesia and other S. E. Asian countries, again
 including India and Afghanistan, lent impetus to Soviet efforts
 nt cultural penetration in these and neighboring countries.
 I:.^.:oyc n t s visits and speech-na.iing in I+Iexico and Cuba in 150
 renine:ed North Americans that the Soviet Union did not intend
 to refrain from persuasion and subversion in the TH. hemisphere.
 A significant move, which may for some time be difficult to
 evaluate, was tas;en in 1053 when i~hrushchev announced in Indo-
 nesia that the Soviet government had decided to open, in Moscow,
 a special ?eoples' Friendship University...primar ily for stu-
 dents frori Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  According to
 covet `My' K'uitura (Soviet Culture), the newspaper of the Lain-
 istry of Cultu:'e, for Feb. 23, 1030, the near university was to

 Pitfalls of Cultural Exchange for the Soviets
 The recent arrest of the American Professor Frederick C.
 Barghoorn showed that, even today, visitors to the USSL, are not
 immune from arbitrary arrest and detention.  Clearly there was
 no real case against3arehoorn, and it is profitable to specu-
 late as to why he was arrested.  One possible reason may have
 been a desire by Soviet security and espionage authorities to
 exchange him for a Soviet trading organization employee recently

 Another, but a most  Tom improbable, explanation might be
 that there was an excess of zeal on the part of some very junior
 secret police officer. But  there is still another hypothesis,
 which we find ouch more likely:  Barghoorn may well have been
 arrested to discourage both western visitors and Soviet citizens
 from too much unsupervised personal contact with each other.
 In recent years, the Soviets have engaged in a very active
 program of cultural exchange, with stress on travel both to and
 from the Soviet Union.  Personal contacts can, under proper con-
 ditions, be a very fruitful means of breaking down western sus-
 2icion.  We may be unable to bear the cliches of Radio Moscow,
 but we will believe assurances of peaceful intentions from in-
 dividual Soviet citizens, who doubtless offer them in allsincerity.
 Many non-Communists return from the Soviet Union impressed by
 Soviet accomplishments; if they are unsophisticated they may not
 realize how carefully they have been guided and shepherded from
 one nodal factory to another.  As it happens, Professor Barghoorn
 was perhaps the leading American expert on the organization and
 methods used in the Soviet cultural exchange program.  Fie knew
 the techniques, and warned people against them.   But he also knew
 that, despite the Soviet intention, cuhiral exchange is bound to
 work in two directions.  Plants raised in an ideological hothouse
 may be more sensitive than those which have grown wild in an open
 environment.
 The operators of the Soviet cultural exchange program have
 groblems.   If they keep all foreign tourists under strict sur-
 veillance, and permit only hardened Communist "activists" to
 travel abroad, they will convince the rest of the world that
 things are just as they were under Stalin.  On the other hand, if
 they send Soviet intellectuals to meet foreigners, or allow for-
 sign visitors to converse freely with Soviet citizens, there is
 an exposure to non-Communist ideology.  The most valuable Soviet
 citizens for creating favorable impressions are precisely those
 who can think for themselves, and who are ready--when they have
 a chance--to voice independent thoughts.   Many non-Communist
 visitors to the USSR are by no means stupid, easily fooled, or
 inarticulate.  Ho doubt some Soviet officials are ready to "take
 a chance" while others--for example, those who engineered Profas-
 sor Barghoora's arrest--want to "play safe."  Professor Barghoorn
 seems to have underestimated the influence of the latter group;
 on the other hand, his release shows the importance of the former
 element.   The Soviet Union has gone too far to turn back to un-
 inhibited Stalinism, but if foreign contacts are permitted to

 Soviet Visitors kb-road.   In regard to Soviet visitors abToacd,
 the problems are s ioun by tihe regime's experiences a year ago
 with Va':tor I1e'crasov and Yev eny Yevtushenko.  IJel.rasov is a
 U::rainian writer who in ilovemb3r 13x2 publisha  an article in the
 Soviet, "liberal" literary journal Ilovy Mir (New Worl_'), describ-
 ing his expexiences in Italy and t e U     In  1 is ar -icle,
 Ile_:rasov wrote relatively little about the superiority of Soviet
 cow:~unism over capitalise, and many of his remarL:s acre likely tc

 Visitors..  r ? `ho ?.Soviet:,.13nion....".Jn. the case of foreign travel to
 I_e J C R , the problems are exemplified by the case of the 3n  ish
 philosopher, A.J. Ayer.  Western intellectual circles know .fyer
 as the leading exponent of the skeptical tradition ste:ping from
 David b}ume, and also as an extremely effective writer and speaker.
 In his younger days, he was a forceful advocate of the Viennese
 philosophy of logical positivism, which was hostile to vague
 metaphysical formulas, and which only assigned value to those
 st..tenents which coulc: be verified empirically.  Thus, unlike
 say Jeantaul Sartre, payer's phi'"osophica l sympathies pre poles
 apart from the Eagalian-Marxist tradition.  The Soviet philo-
 sophical 4ournal Voprosy  'ilosofii (?roblems of Philosophy) brot.e
 all precedents by solic9 ting an   in January       purl  isil-I ng an
 articia by Ayer.   In d'yer's words, his article "contained a :.ii1
 cL "t.ci ,ra of I.Iar:.ist dialectics. I argised that vih Lever other
 purposes they night serve, thep rinciples of the dialectics were
 not scientific laves.  LIy suggestion was not that they were fu se,
 but that since they were interpreter: in such a way that nothing
 could conceivably refute then. they had no empirical content."
 The artic1a was precoded by an editorial note, explaining that
 f.';73r cdid not understand the dialectic, and was followed by a
 j oine?er, defanzaia'.g Idarxisr~'s claim to be scientific.  Jut
 long re
 it was surprisL:ng that dyer's article should be published at all.

 Soviet phailosop,aers also invitad Ayer to the USSR, where he gave
 lecture: on British and Ar erican philosophy at 1.1oscovj and Lenin-

 Among the incriminating documents (subsequently released
 by the Congolese lovednnent) were two which proved direct Soviet
 encouragement and support of the Brazzaville plotters.  One,
 dated 10 November 1D63, was signed by Christophe Gbenye, a fol-
 lower of the late Patrice Lu;:iuuba.  It describes the organiza-
 tion of the Nat tiona? Liberation Co:.xmfittee (IMC), of which Gbenye
 is President, and the various political party components which
 cow,2rise it and discu:sse$ cisagreer:-.eats among members over the

 to take revolutionary and arr,'ed action in order to
 liberate the Congo from the bands of the iinpar i.alists,

 that Co-race Gbenye...would direct the action beyond
 the borders while Comrades Lubaya and Assuman:i would
 direct tlaa operations within the country.
