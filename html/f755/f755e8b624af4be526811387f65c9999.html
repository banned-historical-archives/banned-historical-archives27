 Briefly Noted
 The Chinese Comraunists, despite their frantic efforts, are
 still far from successful in their attempts to integrate peace-
 ful Tibet into the Chinese Peoples Republic.  China's bloody
 suppression of the 135        uprising forced the Dalai Lama and thou-
 sands of followers into exile and installed the puppet Panchen
 lama in his stead.  Evidence recently reaching the outside world
 indicates that despite harshly repressive measures against the
 Tibetans (the Dalai Lama's brother Norbu wrote an article in
 which he estimated that a half million had been executed),
 Chicom troubles in the area are increasing.  Armed rebellion,
 especially  in southern Tibet, is increasing and requires the
 use of even larger numbers of Chinese troops.  The Chicoms ap-
 plied their inimitable agricultural practices in Tibet with the
 usual results:  many crop failures despite widespread use   of
 Chinese and Tibetan soldiers in agriculture.  The resulting
 food shortage is aggravated by continuing exports of food to
 China.  Severe restrictions on religious practice in this for-
 raorly theocratic state have added to Tibetan hatred of the
 Chinese.
 A March 23 Foreign Ministry note to India protesting the
 Dalai Lama's commemoration of the anniversary of the Tibetan
 rebellion reflects China's failure to subdue and win the Tibetan
 Populace over to communism.  The Chinese note charges "Indian
 interference in Chinese internal affairs by continuing to sup-
 port Tibetan rebels wbo take refuge in India."  People's Daily
 of r,2arch 27 goes further:   "The Indian government has not ony
 allowed the Tibetan rebels to conduct open anti-Chinese activi-
 ties in India as an emigre government but has also been actively
 directing them to conduct similar activities in other countries
 in the same capacity."  Additional confessions of frustration
 are found in recent Chinese Communist broadcasts which urge
 Tibetan refugees to return to their homeland and promise them
 immunity from punishment and from collectivization of private

 Commentary
 principal Developments:
 1. The Soviet "moratorium on polemics" with the Chinese
 was broken on 3 April with the publication in Pravda of the mas-
 sive (35,003 word) Suslov report to the closed session of the
 February CPSU plenum, accompanied by the brief plenum "decision"
 seconding the report and by a Pravda editorial.    a  evening,
 Khrushchev, at a commemoration o  Hungary "s  national liberation"
 holiday in the Budapest opera house, struck out sharply at the
 "CCP leaders," referring to their 'open revis on or the main line"
 and their splitting as detailed by the materials published in
 Pravda and speaking of the "hard struggle to be fought against"
 them.  An advance text released by the Hungarian news agency in-
 cluding 8 additional hard-hitting paragraphs similar to the
 Suslov charges was withdrawn in favor of a softer version (which
 still served Soviet purposes through its reference to Pravda),
 but Hungarian newspapers used various versions in between  K.
 continued to hit at the Chinese during the remainder of his
 Hungarian visit, with doctoring of the reported text on at least
 one other occasion.  And by the time he gave his radio-TV re-
 port to the nation (back in Moscow) he was promising other par-
 ties that the CPSU would always treat them all as equals and
 never try to impose policy on them.   (Chrono, May 31 April 12).
 The Suslov diatribe is a detailed indictment of the CCp poli-
 cies and actions in contrast to the success-proved  genera     ne
 of the movement"" (Soviet style) and exemplary conduct in
 the familiar Soviet manner   'Tough it amp i  es on and extends
 previous charges and adds some new information -- such as con-
 firmation that "the Molotov-Kaganovich-Malenkov anti-Party group"
 have been "thrown out of our Party."    However, it gives no clear
 indication of Soviet plans or intentions, winding up with incon-
 clusive passages such as:                   "Soviet Communists will not be silent
 while the Chinese leaders wage an unbridled attack on our great
 cause of building Communism, on the Leninist course of our Party,
 on the positions of the ICM.  We shall have to explain for all
 to hear the essence of the anti- arx s   neo-  o sky  a position
 of the Chinese leaders.  Now, in all its sharpness, there stands
 the task of defending M-L from distortion by the Chinese lea ers
 Asserting that "the present positions of the CCP leadership
 do not reflect the genuine national interests of the Chinese
 people," Suslov adds:    e will do everythi ng necessary to re-
 turn relations between the Soviet 115ion and   e C-PH  o the path
 corresponding to the fundamental  n erests" of ou peoples. "We

 sition of the Chinese leaders   Facts show that there lies ahead

 a serious and ... prolonged struggle ... (for) it is now fully
 clear ta CCY leaders Intend to continue stubborn defense
 of their erroneous line and intend to develop their splitting
 activity even further...."
 Regarding a possible world conference, Suslov merely says:
 "Our Party supports the calling o  another conference of fra-
 ternal parties to discuss the basic problems o  our times" and
 that "a collective effort by all the fraternal parties would be
 the appropriate way to determine the ways and means essential
 to preserve and consolidate M-L unity....It is quite clear to
 the CPSU that the conferelpce must serve this aim."
 I
 The 1*000-word plenum decision "considers" that the situation
 "demands the ideological exposure of the anti-Leninist stand of
 the CCP leadership and the decisive repulsion of their split-
 ting actions", approves of the po     ca  and practical activity
 of the Presidium and First Secy N.S.X., and entrusts them to
 carry on, but it follows this by expressing "its readiness to
 continue efforts to normalize relations between the CPSU and

 All Soviet assets were thrown into the campaign in support
 of the new counter-offensive.  Top CPSU figures were reported
 addressing widely-spread meetings of Party elements, and the
 press and radio were full of editorials and reports of rallies,
 statements and letters (including two signed by groups of Old
 Bolsheviks) from all parts of the USSR, -- and a new "heretofore
 unpublished Lenin document" supporting Soviet "peaceful coex-

 party groups throughout the wor   were also publicized  y  oviet
 media,
 2. In fact, however, a world round-up ten days later in-
 dicates more hesitation and disagreement than unity and whole-
 hearted support.  The East Germans, Bulgarians and Hungarians,
 o vious y primed for the occas on, launched their attacks simul-
 taneously with the CPSU on the 3rd, -- but the Hungarians,
 w.a e  a ar joined ihrushchev in public attacks on the Chinese,
 have still failed to endorse the call for a conference.  Czech
 chief Novotny followed with full-support on the 5th,, but the
 Poles waited until the 9th (though Pravda had falsely reported
 an earlier reaction) and then explicitly shied away from "ex-
 communication."  Tass finally reported suppor   y the Mongolian
 ?arty organ  nen on the 11th, including the call for a confer-

 The Yugoslavs on the 5th thoughtfully criticized both parties
 and seemed to oppose a conference.  The remarkable zuman ans
 have still not reported or commented on the offensive, -- and
 unconfirmed reports say  ha  they have regues a   ov et ap-
 proval of another effort at mediation.
 In the free world, the French Cp rushed in with immediate,
 strong support, beginning on-the 4th.  The Italian C? continued
 its comments critical of the Chinese but opposed to a conference
 at this tine, and the Norwegian C? joined -them, while    e
 Swedish C? urged the two to resume their bilateral talks.  The
 Pinnis , Danish, Austrian, F1est German, Cyprus, Indian, Ceylonese,
 Chilean,  :: e avian, Sou n African and G,      were rep  eddy  ass -
 as in full support, most of them presumably including the con-
 ference.
 3.  None of the Chinese-aligned ruling parties (Chinese,
 H. Korean, 17. Vietnamese, Albanian) has yet mentioned the new
 Covie  campaign, -- nor, as far as wwe know, have any others of
 the Afro-Asian groupan , except for the Indian an   ey onese,
 as mentional. in facts we have seen no polemics at all from the
 Chinese camp during this period (except for Chinese commentaries
 on the recent IADL and IUS meetings and a report on pro-Chinese
 Communists in Chile).
 4.  Polish chief Goraulka led a delegation to Moscow after
 the period en ed (Chrono  April 9, and     en um, Apr    13),
 obviously for the primary purpose of discussing this situation,
 but no further information is available at this time.    There is
 no information as to what kind of a gathering there may be to
 celebrate Khrushchevts birthday on April 17.
 5.  Marshal Malinovsky returned from his 10-day visit to

 Suslov said at the February plenum that the CPSU "supports"
 the calling of a conference and Pravda publishes the time-table
 proposed by the C? U letter of 7-'arcl to the CCP, there is no
 indication in the Pravda editorial or in Z'hrushchev's remarks
 that the CPSU is prepared to push ahead with it in the fore-
 seeable future,  Moreover, whether as cause cr effect, support
 for a conference seems to be further declining among other
 parties.  Tie believe vie detect several increasingly influential
 factors:  (a) an opportunistic appreciation, particularly by
 the larger parties, of the increased independence and leverage
 which has accrued to then through the continuing rivalry;  (b)
 an increasing inability to decide which of the adversaries is
 lij.ely to win out in the long run; and (c) a strong feeling that
 the Chinese are far too important to be excommunicated; that al-
 though they are too rambunctious and difficult to get along with
 now  they should be treated indulgently like hulking, obstreperous
 boys who can ventually be quieted down and civilized (the Togliatti
 and Tito view, probably).
 Our attention is drawn to those passages of the Suslov report
 where he asserts that the positions of the CCP leadership do not
 reflect the genuine national interests of the Chinese people (if
 ever there ware a case of the not calling the kettle black?)
 and goes on to state that "we will do everything necessary" to
 return relations between the two states to a situation which
 corresponds to the fundamental in eres s of the two peoples.
 Me acknowledges awareness of the danger in this, because it is
 clear that the CC? leaders will not yield.  Should this not be
 read as a Soviet declaration of intent to doeverything necessary
 to remove the CC? leadership?  In fact, the  us ov report     ough:.-
 out -- and the Pravda editorial -- attribute Chinese policies
 and actions tompower chauvinism" which "have nothing in com-
 raon with the struggle for socialism," emphasizing the national
 power struggle more than any previous document.
 At any rate, Ithrushchev -- after months of silence in Moscow
 -- has finally been forced to reply to Pekcing's insistently in-
 creased series of provocations:  his reply is strong in words,
 but inconclusive and half-hearted as to future courses of action.
 Uhether this behavior (highlighted by the several "softenings"
 of texts) is due to uhrushchev's weaknesses, to domestic op-
 position and difficulties with the other CPs -- or whether this
 is a deliberate policy of giving the Chinese so much rope that
 they will finally hang themselves -- is still too early to de-
 cide.  "saving;; seen IQ's complete failure to do away with the
 heretic leaders of little Albania, neither the CC? nor we ought
 to take vague hints at "decisive action" against the Peking regime
 very seriously.
 Treatment:
 1.  The developments of this period give new urgency to the
 task we have been stressing over recent months:   to undermine
 the efforts of the various Party leaderships to gloss over "tie

 March 31-April 12 - Khrushchev's visit to Hungary set off, on
 the    it  da3Fs--TUng-expected     iet counter-attack against the
 Chinese CP.  The initial exchanges concerned only the- solidarity
 off the moo. On April 3, the campaign was launched simultaneously

 word 14 February report to the Gf plenum, the "decision" of
 that plenum, and an editorial describing   a Chinese onslaught
 which has made this counter-attack necessary.   (See Addendum

 erroneous policies and disruptive activities, with special at-

 "This is of particular importance under
 present conditions when the CCP leaders have
 openly come out with their splitting attitude.
 This attitude is an open revision of the main
 line of the international Communist movement,
 a revision of the line which was jointly
 evolved by the Marxist-Leninist parties at
 their Moscow consultations in 1957 and 1960.
 Pravda today published the materials of the
 el*'bru`ary plenum of the CPSU Central Committee
 concerning the struggle waged for the unity of
 the international Communist movement.  These
 materials make known our party's attitude, pro-
 vide a political assessment in principle of the
 anti-Leninist line of the CCP leaders, and show
 what a serious danger their undermining activity
 is in the socialist camp and the international
 Communist movement.
 We can be assured that in the hard strug-
 gle to be fought against the splitters,
 Marxist-Leninist parties will forge an even
 stronger unity under the lofty banner of Marx-
 Engels, and Lenin...."
 (Actually, an advance copy of the speech released by the
 Hungarian agency MTI included 8 hard-hitting paragraphs in the
 vein of the Suslov speech between the two paragraphs quoted
 above, but it was withdrawn in favor of the softer version
 which still served Soviet purposes through its reference to the
 materials in Pravda.  However, the Hungarian press published
 various versions between the two.)
 On an April 5 visit to Miskolc, Hungary's second largest
 city, Khrushchev used the strongest language of his visit.
 '17hoever loves Stalin can take him if the-y--Tike the shell of
 corpses,'  he sa  , referring to people "who want to re:iy  on
 the ax and the knife" rather than the ideas of Marxism-Leninism.
 He went on to shout that "they have invented charges against
 me," and "try to incite the people against me."  Citing a par-
 au le to demonstrate the need for Communist unity, he added:
 "Only a complete idiot could pretend to prove that it is easier
 to build Socialism alone.,.."  (These quotes come from reports
 of Western correspondents:  the official Hungarian report omitted
 all but the last, which is rendered as:   "Only people who have
 completely lost all reason....")
 The talks ended on the 8th, and the Hungarian statement
 stressed "the complete identity of views of the two parties on
 all questions discussed."  In a long speech to a "Hungarian-
 Soviet friendship rally" on the 9th, however, Ehrushchev went.

 Hungarians reported him intact.  "In the persons of the Chinese

 As Khrushchev arrived in Moscow on the 11th, a joint com-
 munique on the talks, dated the 9th, was released:   it "resolutely
 con emns the CC? leaders who are pursuing fractional activity,"
 who have drawn away from the Leninist guideline jointly evolved
 at the Moscow conference on every fundamental question of T7C1,1
 strategy and tactics," and who "on numerous issues have slipped
 into an essentially Trotskyite stand."
 Reporting on his trip to the Soviet people by TV and radio
 on the 12th, Khrushchev repeated his "slipping into Trotskyism"
 charge and said that the two parties "believe that it is im-
 perative in the obtaining situation to giv' a resolute rebuff
 to the anti-Leninist concepts and subversive ac  ons of t e
 Chinese leaders."  He made no mention o  a wor   meeting and
 talked only of bilateral meetings such as that just completed.
 He also included a strong statement aimed at dispelling any
 uneasiness in the lesser parties over Soviet pressures:

 editor of the Italian C?? daily L'Unita, denounced  he    inese

 flood o  communications demonstrating full support of the C?CU
 position (presumably including the call for a world conference)
 by Party elements in the USSR and around the world.  Organs of
 other Soviet-aligned parties have also given general support
 but without endorsing -- some even opposing -- the convening
 of a world conference.  The most significant of this large
 volume of statements are:
 -- Top CPSU members Brezhnev, Ilyichev, ICosygin, Podgorny,
 Shelest, Xirilen:o, Satyukov, were reported addressing meetings
 of C?SU organizations in all parts of the USSR.
 -- Pravda on April 5 printed a letter of support signed by Old

 Voyevodin and others.   Izvestiya on the 4th carried a letter
 signed by less famous veteran Leningrad Bolshevil.s.

 A review of this full 18,030 word text reveals that the
 NCITA summary which we had in hand two weeks ago was a faithful
 distillation, and our brief comments in the Addendum to the
 last Chronology present the essence of this generally familiar
 re-run of the Chinese line on revolution.  Therefore, we will
 here add only a few useful quotations.  The general line of
 attack is indicated by the headings of its tan (un-numbered)
 sections:
 (1) A Disciple of Bernstein and Kautsky
 (2) Violent Revolution Is a Universal Law of Pro-
 letarian Revolution
 (3) Our Struggle Against Khrushchev's Revisionism
 (4) Sophistry Cannot Alter History
 (5) Lies Cannot Cover Up Reality

 (7) Refutation of "Opposition to Left Opportunism"
 (8) Two Different Lines, Two Different Results

 Under (2), the Chinese quote Lenin on "civil war, without
 which not a single great revolution in history has yet been
 able to get along, and without which not a single serious
 Marxist has conceived of the transition from capitalism to
 socialism" ("Prophetic Words"), and conclude the section by
 adding solemnly:   "It is on this most important question that
 Khrushchev betrays Marxism-Leninism.''
 Under (6), they stress that half of the Communist parties
 in capitalist countries are still illegal and cannot possibly
 win a parliamentary majority:

 "cor ex:a:ple, the Communist ?arty of Spain
 lives under white terror and .gas no oppor-
 tunity to run in elections.   It is pathetic
 and tragic that Spanish Communist leaders
 lice Ibarruri should follow Khrushchev in
 advocating 'peaceful transition' in Spain."
 Under (S), they list "the main lessons of the successful
 proletarian revolutions in the countries extending from China
 to Cuba after World tar II.":
 "1 -- Violent revolution is a universal
 law of proletarian revolution.  To realize
 the transition to socialism, the proletariat
 must wage armed stru:,;gle, smash the old state
 machine, and establish the dictatorship of
 the proletariat.
 "2 -- The peasants are the most dependable
 allies of the proletariat.  The proletariat
 must closely rely on the peasants, establish
 a broad united front based on the worker-
 peasant alliance, and insist upon proletarian
 leadership in the revolution.
 "3 -- U.S. imperialism is the arche seriy
 of people's revolution in all countries.  The
 proletariat must hold high the national banner
 of opposition to U.S. imperialism and have the
 courage to fight with firm resolve against the
 U.S. imperialists and their lackeys in its own
 country.
 "4 -- TLe revolution of the oppressed na-
 tions is an indispensable ally of the pro-
 letarian revolution.  The workers of all coun-
 tries must unite, and they must unite with all
 the oppressed nations and all the forces op-
 posed to imperialism and its lackeys to form
 a broad international united front.
 "5 -- To make a revolution, it is es-
 sential to have a revolutionary party.  The
 triumphs of the dictatorship of the pro-
 letariat are impossible without a revolution-
 ary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, a
 party which is irreconcilable towards revision-
 ism and opportunism, and which takes a revolu-
 tionary attitude toward the reactionary ruling
 classes and their state power."
 They ad:   "Conversely, all those parties which adopted a
 non-revolutionary, opportunist line and accepted Ihrushchev's
 line of 'peaceful transition' are doing serious damage to t:.e

 reformist parties, or becoming completely degenerate and serv-
 ing as tools of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.  There
 is no lack of such instances," and they describe the parties
 of Iraq, Algeria, Cuba, France and Italy.
 In (9), just before demanding  r-3pudiation and liquidation of
 K'nrushchev's revisionism, they castigate him personally:
 "The revisionist Khrushchev is also scared out
 of his wits by the hysterical war cries o    le
 U.S.  taper alists, and he thinks that this
 "Noah's ark, " the earth, is threatened with
 destruction at any moment and has completely
 lost confidence in the future of ma:i :d. Pro-
 ceeding from national egoism, he fears that
 revolutions by the oppressed classes and na-
 tions create trouble for him and implicate him.
 Therefore, he tries to oppose ever revolution
 by all means and, as in  he case or  he Congo,
 does not scruple to take joint action with U.S.
 imperialism in stamping out a people's revolu-
 tion.     No  thinT.ks that by doing so he can avoid

 "...The entire progress of world development
 fully reaffirms the correctness of the general
 line of the WCM drafted at the conferences of
 fraternal parties in 1957 and 1960 and the
 vitality of the conclusions and principles of
 the 20th and 22nd CPSU Congresses and the
 Leninist Program of the CPSU.... iIowever, our
 successes could have been even more significant
 but for the serious difficulties which occurred
 within the socialist camp and the Communist
 movement as a result of the schismatic activity
 of the CCP leaders....Beginn ng w       e 19

 ng begun w    the revision of certain tactics
 and principles of the VJCM, went on step by step
 to deepen their differences with the CPSU and
 other fraternal parties on the most important
 contemporary problems.  Finally, running counter
 to the general course of the WCiI, they put for-
 ward their own special line, in which they re-
 vised  Fie basic principles of the declaration
 and statement from positions of big-paver I
 chauvinism and petty bourgeois a venturism....
 They have` in fac  c1eve ope  into d sagreement

 The CPSJ undertook numerous measures to surmount the dis-
 agreements and normalize relations, but the CCP leaders,
 "blinded by nationalist arrogance,...rejected our initiative
 and embarked on the road of open political struggle...: Chinese
 propaganda "is coming even closer to joining the ranks of anti-
 Soviet and anti-Communist organs of reactionary imperialist
 circles," Suslov says, and he points specifically to the 4

 the entire Soviet people" with its   e iri.ous arse: ions.

 amounts to an intention to foist their ad-
 venturist conceptions and methods onto the
 poeples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
 to set peoples against one another according
 to racial distinctions, to tear apart the
 union between the na  on al liberation and
 workers movements....
 ...The main strategic principle of the
 Chinese leadership:   to subject, regardless
 of the consequences, the Communist and na-
 tional liberation movements to their own
 great-pourer  narrow, egotistica  Interests.  -
 is precisely for   is pairpose that p: inci-
 pies of proletarian internationalise are being
 flagrantly violated....Marxist-Leninist teach-
 ing; is being redesigned and distorted....(and)
 the worst traditions of petty-bourgeois na-
 tionalism and the most shameless demagogy and
 slander are employed as weapons."
 An outline of the body of Suslov=s report follows:
 (1) Two Epproac:es to the Issue of the Role of the World Social-
 ist System.              s is toe familiar Soviet argu::ien a ion, se
 fortE in    o 14 July open letter and other statements.
 (2) Questions of War, ?eace,and Revolution.   In over 6,333 words,
 (t   1longest section), Sus ov follows the "Traditional Ithiu-
 shchevian line on these important questions, but in stronger
 language than any previous official statement.  Be says that
 "the CCP leaders have come to maintain that war constitutes an
 acceptable -- and in essence the sole -- meads of solving the
 contradiction between capitalism  nn  socialism," and that they
 "even boast about being prepared ...to agree to the annihilation
 of half of mankind," citing some old and some new Chinese     te-
 men s denonstra  ng their ruthless attitude.                He adds, "every
 timo it has been found possible to normalize a situation and
 avert a military conflict, Pelting has not been able to conceal
 its irritation and regret."  Suslov contrasts Chinese behavior
 in attempting "to e;;pand the armed conflict on the Sino-Indian
 frontier" where "there had been no armed classes between China
 and .India for centuries," with their "showering flattery on the
 reactionary ?a1istan regime before the eyes of the en ire
 world"" and ""virtually entering into a pact" with that member
 of the imperialist S3ATO and CLNTO niliTary alliances.  Further
 evidence of CCP hypocracy is their "feverish efforts to improve
 relations with Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Italy,"
 and they would do the same with tip U.S. "but they cannot see
 suitable conditions for it at the moment.''

 argumentation, but stronger.  In developing his charge that
 "the CCP leadership is obviously striving to assume control of
 the forces of the national liberation struggle in order to turn
 them into tools for realization of its own clans for hegemony,"
 Suslov expands on the previous accounts of the Chinese  an  -
 white" comments at the Uoshi AAPSO conference, and also on the
 "secret intention behind  ~e Chinese slogan" --'The East Wind
 Will prevail over the West Wind" -- which is "nothing more or
 less than an ideological and political expression of the he;emo-
 nic strivings of the Chinese leaders."
 (4) Soviet-Chinese Relations.  This 3,000-word section gives
 the Soviet picture of Their great aid to China, drastically re-
 duced on CCp initiative, and adds:
 'At present, the Chinese propagandists
 are positively bursting out of their skins
 to prove that there was no Soviet aid to China
 and that only the usual trade operations took
 place.  In an effort to destroy the peoples'
 memory of Soviet aid, they are even going so
 far as to remove factory trade marks from
 Soviet tools and machines and are slandering
 the Soviet Union by saying that it supplied
 China with obsolete equipment."
 They also "attempt to justify the failure in the development
 of the CPR national economy resulting from the 'great leap for-
 ward' policy" on "the issue of Soviet experts.".... "The Chinese
 leaders are striving to fence their people off from the Soviet
 pion.  '
 Q) Attacks by CCn Leaders on the C?SU Program.  3000-word
 justification of       Program line on evolving from the "dic-
 tatorship of the proletariat" to a "people's rule".
 (6) The Splitting Activity of the Chinese Leaders in the World-
 vita Mmunist Movement.   Anguished 4,300-word complaint, in-
 c ludino protest against new Chinese "pseudo-theoretical" dia-
 lectical law on inevitability of split in 4 Feb. article.  "The
 whole Chinese propaganda machine -- NCITA, the information
 centers, various bulletins and radios -- is now enlisted in the
 struggle against U -L parties."  He admits that the "ultra-
 leftwing revolutionary phraseology with which the Chinese leaders
 coat their adventurous concepts might find a certain response
 among the hundreds of millions of people unversed or inexper? ?.
 enced in politics...."
 (7) On the Danger of petty-bourgeois  Nationalist  Neo-
 Trotshyite Deviation,   In this  ,    -vrord sections Suslov ex-
 emits Soviet arguments even more than on other subjects:  The
 CC? leaders "have fallen so low that they now borrow many of
 their ideas and concepts from the ideological luggage o
 ots.:yism,   she ""petty bourgeois trea6s d eiea a  by ninism
 on; agog'' including "the fractional, schismatic methods of

 struggle," the "theory about the regions of Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America being the main zone of world revolution," and
 even the "repetition in new conditions of the old Trotskyite
 slander about the rebirth of the USSR into a Thermidorian state."
 In support, he quotes  on.; of   e leaders of   o s kyism in
 Latin America, Posadas," who said last July:
 "Co?:rade Chinese, you cannot assert that
 all the questions put forward by you as re-
 volutionary conclusionsare the exclusive re-
 sults of your own theoretical and political
 work alone.  These are the conclusions of the
 Fourth International."
 Suslov then turns to nationalism, which
 "is gaining the upper hand more and more in
 the overall policy of tW    nese leadership
 and is becoming the mainspring of their ac-
 tivity.  MIS became apparent even 'in the
 period of the great leap forward....This found
 its expression in such acts by the Chinese
 Govt. as the artificial inflation of national-
 istic passions concerning  or er questions,,
 the behavior of the CCP leaders during the
 Caribbean crisis, and the position of the
 Chinese Govt. on the nuclear question.
 All these and other facts expose the total
 split between the words and deeds of the     nese
 ers,     is becoming increasingly clear   at
 she  a tciing phrases and formulas are designed
 for export, for imposition on the  :. s of
 other countries.  The  C  leaders  ,aemse ves,
 when the su j eat is prac cal steps in the
 international arena, prefer to act not at all
 from poe4tions of revolutionary s rugg a with
 imperialism.  3xtreme  bewilderment is caused
 by the fact that Chinese propaganda boils down
 its struggle with imperialism to a struggle
 with the U.S., by-passing its allies -- Ja-
 panese, West Germans and French imperialists.
 Are they not really looking for partners in
 the monopoly circles of these countries in
 their struggle with so-called modern revasion-
 sm
 He concludes:   "The nationalistic course of the CCP leaders
 has nothing in common with the genuine interest of the fraternal
 Choi nese people.," and then turns to the "negative influence on
 the activity of theCC?" of "Mao Tse-tung's personality cult."
 Suslov says "our party smashed the Molotov- aanovich-
 Ma.len icov anti-party group" because they opposed elfin nation of
 the personality cu, -- and also because some were responsible

 for part of the mass repressions.   "Is it for the restoration
 of such inhuman methods that the Chinese leaders feel concerned?
 Is this why they display sympathy for people who have been
 thrown out of our Party?"
 (3) For the Unity of the V1CPd on the ?rinciplas of Marxism-
 Len nism.                  us ov begins its 2,    -word concluding sec  on by
 relating 1how "viie have done and are doing everything necessary
 to overcome the disagreements between and restore cooperation
 between the ^C? and th4o CPSU, " but the CCP leaders only launch
 increasin.- attac2ts.
 "They have concentrated their fire largely on
 IIikita Ser ;eyevich, who has headed the remark-
 able processes cihich have begun in our Party
 and our country since the 20th Congress and
 have guaranteed the successful advance of the
 Soviet people toward Communism.  This is why,
 with their undermining aims in view, they would
 li'.e to isolate T . .~ .  rom the CC and to sat
 our CC aga ns     e2ar y anc     oviet people.
 But this   Typo   sanempty, hopeless
 adventure.   It is doomed to a complete and
 sharseful failure. The Chinese leaders, and
 not only they, Liust note and firmly remember,
 that our CC headed by that loyal Leninist N.S.:;.
 is united and monolithic as never before."
 (Ode to K. con inues.
 Suslov stresses that it was the Chinese who "announced the
 suspension" of the bilateral talks last July.   It became clear
 that they "regarded our self-discipline, our desire for unity,
 as a manifestation of weakness."'and even "started saying that
 they V7111 not accept an  raprovement of relations with the CPSU
 except on the condition of unconditional surrender on our part."
 "In their nationalistic self--1 ove, they  oaste   i.n their 4 Feb.

 disorganize the activity of the par y created by the great
 Lenin."
 "For Soviet communists, tine sons and
 daughters of the October Revolution, the pio-
 neers of the new communist world, to whose lot
 such. heavy tests have fallen, it is simply
 ridiculous to listen to these threats.  Soviet
 Coi:ir.iunists will not be silent while the    inese

 25X1C1gkf2?  Further Sino-Soviet Clashes in Front Organizations
 BACKGROUND:  The Eighth Congress of the International Associa-
 tion of                 m cratic Lawyers (IADL) opened in Budapest on 31 March
 wi   4GO-500 participants, representing some 60 member organiza-
 tions.                  The participants came from 13 bloc, 13 European, 9 Latin
 American, and 7 Asian countries, and from Africa, the US and
 Canada.   Despite the broad geographic representation at the Congress
 and efforts to mute the Sino-Soviet dispute, the polemics between
 the Soviet and Chinese delegations dominated the Congress, just as
 they did the preliminary work on the Congress agenda in 1963.
 The large 30 member Chinese People's Republic (CPR) delegation
 came prepared for an anti-Soviet campaign.   In a press statement on
 29 March the delegation blamed the Soviets in advance "for the
 grave consequences which may ensue at the 8th Congress."  The state-
 ment said further:
 "It is to be regretted that certain responsible
 members of the IADL have taken an extremely un-
 democratic attitude to monopolize everything in
 regard to the agenda of the eighth congress, the
 reports, and the way the congress is to be con-
 ducted for the purpose of pushing through the
 erroneous line of the foreign policy of a certain
 country."
 The Chinese again attacked the legitimacy of the preparatory
 work for the Congress in a statement issued after the Council of
 the IADL had met on 30 March to give final approval to the agenda
 for the Congress:
 "The voting conducted by the council on the
 agenda is null and void and its result is not
 binding on the Chinese delegation, which re-
 serves the right to advance its own opinion."
 The leader of the Chinese delegation, Mrs. Han Yu-tung, con-
 tinued the attack on the practices of the Soviet Union and its
 followers in the IADL in a speech during the opening day of the
 Congress.   She accused "certain persons" of "manipulating and using
 the IADL to propagate the general line of so-called peaceful co-
 existence."  In an obvious appeal for support from the underdevel-
 oped nations, Mrs. Han said:
 "Those who talk loudly about subordinating
 everything to the general line of 'peaceful
 coexistence and to universal and complete

 (772 Cakpp-oved For Release                DP78-03( 114 Q20QAO001-3
 disarmament' have adopted a passive, scornful,
 and negative attitude toward the national inde-
 pendence movement in Asia, Africa and Latin
 America."
 Mrs. Han's speech concluded with a presentation of 7 proposals to
 the Congress.
 When the leader of the Soviet delegation, Lev N. Smirnov,
 replied to the Chinese attack (Mrs. Han's speech "has no connection
 with international law;  it only attacks the policy now supported by
 all the world"), Mrs. Han demanded the right to speak in rebuttal
 and after some argument was given the microphone but her speech
 could not be heard over the catcalls and other noise.   Pierre Cot,
 President of the IADL, then adjourned the session and said that
 the Congress would adhere strictly to the agenda.  The next general
 session of the Congress was not scheduled until the last day, April
 5th, with the intervening days devoted to work in the commissions.
 Very little reporting has appeared so far concerning the work
 of the comm.ssions or the final resolutions.  The Chinese evidently
 continued their opposition in the commissions and presented their
 own draft resolutions on the closing day.   Reportedly, when this
 resolution -_ which inter alia represented the partial nuclear test
 ban agreement as a fraud against the peoples and called "US
 imperialism the most ferocious and most arrogant aggressor in human
 history" -- was rejected by the political bureau of the Congress
 (31 to 9 with 7 abstentions), the Chinese delegation walked out.
 This clearly pointed up the weakness of their minority position.
 The Congress voted instead for a resolution drafted by the presidium
 which called for "coexistence between countries with different social.
 and political systems."
 Attempting to paper over these disruptive Chinese actions,
 Pierre Cot and the Secretary General of the IADL, Joe Nordmann,
 stated on 6 April after the concluding Congress session that "des-
 pite the arguments and differences of opinion, the general atmos-
 phere of the Congress had improved during the week it was in session
 The Congress was very successful."  The IADL officers also stated
 at this press conference that they considered the CPR still to be a
 member of the international association -- which means that if the
 Chinese wish to split the IADL formally they must take further
 initiatives.   It also means, however, that under existing conditions
 and in the absence of any official censure by the IADL, the Chinese
 and their followers are free to continue their regional recruiting
 efforts in the recently organized Afro-Asian Lawyers Organization,
 where the Chinese were able to get the Soviets excluded from the
 permanent secretariat established in November 1963.  That the
 Chinese splitting attempts will continue is clearly indicated by the
 fact that Mrs. Han stated her concern over Soviet control of inter-
 national front organizations very explicitly:   "They stop at nothing
 to control and use a number of international mass organizations as
 an instrument for the pursuance of this erroneous line."

 In Algiers, 200 delegates from 71 nations watched the feud
 between the Chicoms and their Soviet brethren rage throughout the
 Sixth Council Session of the Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organ-
 ization (AAPSO).  The verbal battle began even before the mee ing
 opened on 22 March and lingered on after the closing session on
 27 March.  This marks the  t h i r d  successive AAPSO meeting that
 has been disrupted by the Sino-Soviet quarrel.   When the public
 dispute made its AAPSO debut in February, 1963, at Moshi,the
 Chinese stole the show from the apparently unsuspecting Russians.
 The following September,a forewarned Soviet delegation firmly
 controlled the proceedings at the Nicosia executive committee
 meeting.   Meanwhile, some Africans and Asians have become exasper-
 ated with Sino-Soviet antics in AAPSO and their impatience came to
 the fore at Algiers.   Supported by such Afro-Asians, the Algerian
 Chairman of the Council Mohammed Ba Yazid acted as chief mediator
 and saved the March AAPSO Meeting from further ideological mud-
 slinging.
 The Chinese attacked Soviet foreign policy on the grounds that
 it is "appeasing imperialism" and "vacillating," decisively support-
 ing only strong and tested revolutionary moveFnents.   At various
 times during the six day conference, the CPR  e egation, led by
 Mrs. Kuo Chien, applied these criticisms to USSR relations with the
 United States, Israel, Cuba, the Congo, India and Algeria.   As a
 result, said the Chicoms, the Soviets are "traitors to the prin-
 ciples of Leninism"; the gist of the Soviet reply on all counts --
 "All the Chinese have said is lies."  To bolster their charge the
 Soviets cited extensive aid, particularly in Africa, suggozted that,
 "If not for Soviet aid, China would have collapsed" and concluded
 that the Chinese harassers were the "traitors to Lenin."
 The vehemence of Sino-Soviet debate in public and closed
 sessions prevented the Council from completing much of   e business
 at hand.
 (1)  The Chinese objected to Soviet proposals that an Afro-
 Asian Economic Seminar and Afro-Asian conferences for women, youth
 and writers be held in Moscow in 1964.
 (2)  Of seven committees scheduled to be chosen, only the
 Organization, General Declarations, and Political Committees were
 selected.   Significantly, membership on the Political Committee
 was evenly balanced between Chicom and Soviet supporters.
 (3)  Neither the Fund Committee (mechanism for funding revolu-
 tions in Africa) in Conakry, the Three Continent Committee (device
 for extending AAPSO membership to Latin America), relations with
 the Organization for African Unity (OAU), labor conferences, nor
 organizational changes were discussed to any useful degree, although
 all represent priority AAPSO problems,   The failure to do so can be
 tied to points of dissension in the Sino-Soviet argument. /Discussion
 of these and other controversial issues was to be resumed within
 the secrecy of the AAPSO Secretariat in Cairo on 8 April./

 The 37 resolutions (almost identical to those of last year)
 issued in the Council's final communique embodied the one over-
 riding element of unity in the entire meeting.  Every delegation
 opposed    imperialism, notably in South   a nam an   anama.
 That the Council managed to proclaim the regular battery of prop-
 aganda-laden resolutions and also decide on dates and places for
 the next two AAPSO confabs can be attributed to Afro-Asian
 mediators.
 In evidence since the Gaza meeting of 1961, certain Africans
 emerged in Algiers as the arbitors and disciples of Afro-Asian
 unity:
 (1)  Mohammed Ba Yazid, the Algerian Chairman of the Council
 and elected head o  the     itical Committee, suspended and closed
 sessions when debate grew heated, at one point ejected the press,
 and generally objected to the Sino-Soviet exhibition of attrcking
 solidarity.   He referred discussion of key and controversial ques-
 tions to the Secretariat, and was largely responsible for drawing
 the delegations together to accomplish the usual amenities and
 formalities, including the passage of resolutions.  Yazid undoubt-
 edly derived his strength from Ben Bella's backing.   Yazid's state-
 ment that, "Only African and Asian issues are proper subjects" for
 AAPSO consideration echoed declared sentiments of the Algerian
 head of state.
 (2)  Yazid's All-African supporting cast included Mahdi Ben
 Barka, an exiled  oroccan revolutionary (W96-makes his headquarters
 in    geria) and Chairman of the Organization Committee.  The Chair-
 man of the important Fund Committee, Guinean Abdoulaye Diallo was
 selected to head the General Declarations Commi  ee.  Egyptian
 Secretary General Yusuf Sibai was faced with lesser struggles,
 (e.g., India vs. Pa  stan over Kashmir, admittance of Malaysia,
 etc.) some directly (-e.g., two Ceylonese delegations, four Chicom-
 backed delegations from the Camerouns) caused by the more spectac-
 ular Sino-Soviet rift.
 Although Chicom and Soviet camp followers were present and
 discernible, AAPSO's traditional "a pox on both your houses" group
 endures.   When the Soviets and Chinese agreed, for once, on seating
 a new delegation from Zanzibar, the Arabs opposed it because Arabs
 had been slaughtered there.   At times, the Arabs (particularly the
 Egyptians) even talked of throwing both the  hrcoms and Soviets
 out of AAPS .  25X1 C10b

 25X1C1&?3.  Recent Revisionist Voices:   Looking Beyond Marxism-Leninism
 BACKGROUND:   Current news headlines describe the conflict
 between Moscow and Peking over who shall be the leader of world
 Communism.   Peking charges that the Soviet leaders are revision-
 ists and splitters who have abandoned the goal of revolution.
 Moscow accuses the Chicom leaders of factionalism, petty bourgeois
 nationalism, adventurism, and racialism.  Although each claims to
 be the true heir to Marx and Lenin, their differences appear to be
 unbridgeable; therefore, both cannot be right in terms of doctrine,
 and it does not take a very skeptical mind to suspect that neither
 is doctrinally in an entirely sound position.  For someone who
 believes in economic determinism, it might be natural to infer
 that the ideological conflict is based on the fundamental economic
 and political problems and aims of China and the Soviet Union, or
 in other words, that Khrushchev and Mao are following their con-
 flicting personal and national interests.  Marx s -  n n s s  n
 other areas may we    conclude that they have unique interests as
 well, corresponding with neither the interests of Moscow nor the
 interests of Peking.  This seems to be the conclusion reached,
 for example, by the government of Rumania.
 Common interests:   removal of dogmatic restraints.  Governments
 and po     cans, however, are not the on y ones -to have interests.
 Other people play prominent roles in modern society too:  writers,
 scientists, teachers, and critics, for example.  No first-class
 representative of any of these groups can be happy with a rigorous
 system of state or party control; their activities are best pursued
 with imagination, in an atmosphere of free discussion.  All of
 them, but especially the scientists, are indispensable to a modern
 society, and they contribute most to it when they are free. Their
 interest inevitably lies in the removal of dogmatic restraints.
 The Sino-Soviet conflict and the Soviet denigration of Stalin have
 undermined the moral authority of any official doctrine, and the
 concept of a single world-wide monolithic movement following the
 dictates of the First Secretary of the CPSU has been proven im-
 practical.   Communist and leftist intellectuals are taking advantage
 of the situation to claim new freedoms for themselves and their
 fellow citizens, and to advance new theories to modify those of
 classic Marxism-Leninism.  Particularly interesting for us, and
 no doubt particularly alarming for the Stalinists, are the indica-
 tions that the revisionists in the various Bloc countries draw
 support and encouragement from eac  other, and are not Isolate d by
 the barbed wire which separates   ese countries from each other as
 well as from the West.
 Marxism:   its several aspects. MLny ''?ecterners believe that
 Marxism, let alone Leninism, is basically and irremediably in con-
 flict with intellectual freedom.                 Marxism deals in unmeasurable
 abstractions, and its supporters refuse to admit that the doctrine
 could be proven false, thereby making it a matter of faith and not
 of fact or science.  Marxism fosters the tyranny of concepts over

 the mind by classifying everything in broad value-loaded categories,
 like Procrustean beds, so as to discourage hritical thought and
 mobilize the masses for action.   Ideally, we would like to see the
 Bloc throw off Marxism-Leninism altogether.  But this is not a
 practical goal at present.
 Or practical reason is that anyone arguing for a total rejec-
 tion of Marx would be considered, in the Bloc and in some circles
 outside it as well, as an agent of Western imperialism, and appro-
 priate action would be taken to silence him.  But more important,
 many intellectuals honestly believe that Marx had a vision of truth.
 Some who were brought up inside the system are unable to throw off
 all they were taught;  Marxism is a crutch to which they are accus-
 tomed.   Others who became Marxist-Leninists in a capitalist society
 still consider Marx's insights into and criticisms of that kind of
 society a liberating influence.  The revisionists have discovered,
 correctly, that Marx himself was inspired by humane impulses, by a
 detestation for the real suffering, bourgeois hypocrisy, and personal
 unhappiness--due to the isolation or alienation of the individual
 from any satisfying, human social life--which  e saw in capitalist
 society.  The humane ideas of Marx, which are obviously as counter
 to Stalinist society as they were to the society of 19th century
 England, are more likely to win acceptance among Communists and
 leftists than any blanket condemnation of Marxism.
 For many--those who are not expert theoreticians--the fine point
 of Marxist thought, whether Stalinist or that of the Young Marx, are
 a somewhat academe matter.  They are more concerned to affirm cer-
 tain intellectual or a    cal ideas which are really independent of
 Marxism, and which are important in themselves; they try to relate
 these to Marxism, but often somewhat as an afterthought, apologeti-
 cally.   Such ideas include demands for:   free investigation, open
 discussion, the review of Stalinism, free access to Western litera-
 ture, a turn away from the parrotting of Marxist-Leninist texts, and
 even an appreciation of the spiritual element.  These proposals con-
 stitute a rejection of Stalinism, and to say the least, a radical
 change in the direction of Marxism-Leninism, yet the-proposals are
 advanced as obvious and self-evident.  Only the party and state
 officials with a vested interest in a Stalinist system, try to stifle
 such statements; the officials often succeed where they still control
 the instruments of repression, but they are weak in terms of argu-
 ments.
 The new currents might almost be described as "liberalism"
 rather than as "revisionism," since their authors are rea  y con-
 cerne  with ideas outside, if not hostile to Marxism, and not with
 changing the content of Marxism.   Yet most of those who state these
 views would hotly deny that they are outside the Marxist-Leninist
 framework.      The following are characteristic revisionist figures;
 quotations from their writings or speeches are contained in an
 attachment:
 1.   Robert Havemann.  Havemann is an East German
 c em s , and a veteran Communist who escaped

 talents were needed in war research;  in the
 post-war years he got into trouble with West
 Berlin authorities (including the US mili-
 tary) because he attempted to conduct Commu-
 nist organizational activities.   In recent
 years he taught at the Humboldt University in
 East Berlin, and kept up a wide correspondence
 within the Bloc and with Western scientists
 like Linus Pauling.   Since Havemann believed
 that secrecy and conspiracy were wrong, and
 also since he expected to be able to defend
 himself with references to Soviet conditions
 and Soviet friends (such as the chemist and
 dialectician B.M. Kedrov), he delivered some
 remarkable lectures on the relation of dialec-
 tical materialism to natural science, particu-
 larly in the last months of 1963.  The Stalinist
 SED leadership was alarmed and suspected that
 Havemann was conspiring with liberal intellec-
 tual Czechs and with dissident elements in the
 GDR, and when Havemann granted an interview to
 a West German journalist, this was used as a
 pretext for dismissing him from his professor-
 ship.   Havemann has particularly sought the
 elimination of bureaucratic and arbitrary
 control, and has argued for open and free
 discussion.
 2. Georgy Lukacs.  Now eighty years old, Luk1cs
 was involved in controversy in the late '40s,
 and in the middle '50s he advocated "unfalsi-
 fied Marxism" to Hungarian students.  A
 Stalinist has accused him of hailing the
 Hungarian revolt of 1956 as a "democracy
 under which the traditions of the Hungarian
 revolt could unfold," and after the revolt was
 crushed he was deported to the USSR. Perhaps
 because of his age, Luka.cs was later permitted
 to return to Budapest, where he has been quietly
 working on a book on aesthetics.  On 18 January
 1964 the Czech literary journal Literarni Noviny
 (Literary News) published an interview with
 Lukacs, quoting him as urging a complete
 elimination of "Stalin's disfigured Marxism"
 and advocating that young people he permitted
 to see for themselves what the West produces.
 Such stories as this explain why Rude Pravo
 (the Czech equivalent of Pravda) has now (early
 April) published a strong  en ral Committee
 attack on major Czech and Slovak literary pub-
 lications, including Literarni Noviny.   (The
 Polish regime is using the subtler and perhaps
 more effective tactic of restricting the paper
 supply.)

 3.       Leopold Sedar Senghbr.   Senghor, the President of
 Senegal, is a different sort of figure from the
 dissident bloc intellectuals, in that he is an
 African political leader and a Catholic.  But he
 is also a man of real intellectual stature, a
 poet educated at the University of Paris, and a
 student of Marxist theory.   Senghor is interested
 in the humanist strain of Marx, but believes that
 the French Jesuit philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de
 Chardin, has largely superseded Marx with a
 broader, more profound analysis, regarding spirit
 rather than matter as the basic reality.
 Senghor also advocates the integration of Negro-
 African cultural values into socialism, creating
 an African socialism.

 n   e r attacks on both revisionism and dogma-
 tism because their clumsy ideological machinery
 was itself burdened with both faults.  At a
 conference with young people in Novi Sad on
 4 March 1964, Vranicki made some highly original
 remarks:  he suggested that Soviet and Chinese
 theoreticians were searching the works of Marx
 and Lenin for quotations when they should be
 thinking for themselves; he remarked that since
 Marx's most important idea was that of the
 liberation of man, socialists "should extol the
 personality cult, but a cult of all personalities,"
 rather than merely of one personality; and he
 said that it was an illusion to suppose that an
 omnipotent state monopolism might be the chief
 force in the fight against dogmatism.  The only
 solution to existing problems, Vranicki maintained,
 was workers' self-management.   In answer to a
 question about the foundations of Marxism under
 present conditions, Vranicki answered that "today
 Marxist thought has to base itself on everything
 which now represents the most valuable in science,
 philosophy and culture in general.  The Marxist
 idea has to turn toward the present rather than
 toward the past."

 774             Two Indian Communist Parties?
 25X1C10b
 BACKGROUND:  The largest Asian Communist party not now
 dominates y     ~e Chinese Communists may be on the verge of a
 formal break-up along the lines of an historic split.   In late
 1962 the CPI breached international Communist solidarity by
 denouncing Communist China's invasion of India's borderlands.
 Many members of the so-called "leftist" CPI group strongly ob-
 jected, arguing that Communist countries do not commit aggres-
 sion, therefore the guilt must be India's.  Differences between
 and within the two groups have increased since that time and
 are again being fought out in public.
 Two press disclosures of Party matters have sparked the
 current crisis but the underlying issue is the one besetting
 many Cps today:  whether their political allegiance shall belong
 to Moscow or ?eking. In the Indian party there are also many
 who urge independence from both.
 Since the Chinese invasion of India in October 1962, the
 CPI has maintained a pro forma unity under the leadership of
 Chairman S.A.Dange who'TraveTs regularly to Moscow for advice
 and assistance.  Nominally the Party supports Prime Minister
 Nehru's defense against Chinese aggression, as does Moscow.
 During the same time, the leftists   (many -- but not all -- of
 whom look to Pelting for leadership), have established independent
 regional offices and publications to purvey their own more mili-
 tant views.  But they have been unable to agree among themselves
 on whether to secede from the CPI and try to overthrow the
 government as a rival party, as has been done in Burma and
 Ceylon, or to work within the party to overthrow Dange and gain
 control.
 Public Disclosures.  Two new divisive elements increased
 the discord in March. -A right-wing Bombay weekly, Current,
 printed on March 7 a letter allegedly written by Range from
 prison in 1924, offering his services to the British colonial
 regime in return for his release.  Some press treatment has im-
 plied that Range may still be acting for the government.  The
 Range-dominated Party Secretariat immediately denounced the
 letter as a forgery.  Thereupon a leftist group spokesman, M.T.
 Basavapunniah, called a press conference to insist that the
 letter was genuine and to issue an unprecedented attack on Dange
 as a "traitor to the party."  A.I. Gopalan, the Communist op-
 position leader in the Loh Sabha (lower house of parliament)
 said publicly that Dange should resign as Chairman and, referring
 to the letter, that "even if it was 40 years back,  [Dange] can-
 not lead a revolutionary party."  Another spokesman, E.H.
 Idamboodiripad of the moderate-leftists, has castigated both
 groups for taking the case to the public rather than settling
 it within the party.  A government announcement that the alleged

 (za4 ~on`t.) ov
 Range letter had been removed from the National Archives for safe
 keeping, lends substance to its existence.
 Also contributing to this disarray is a draft party program
 allegedly drawn up by the leftists (apparently for presentation
 to the party) and distributed by a group of non-Communist Marxists
 The document praises China as "defender of peace," attacks India's
 non-alignment policies and calls for overthrow of the Indian
 government by "any and every means."  The leftists have not denied
 that they did draft a minority program but publicly claLiied that
 the published version is distorted.
 Future Prospects.  Whether these differences will lead to an
 open break may soon Be determined.  On April 9th the National
 Council, representing all state organizations, and the Central
 Executive Committee convened an emergency ;Meeting.   Thirty two of
 the leftist and centrist party figures Yra1:ed out of the sleeting
 to protest Chairman Range's refusal to vacate the chair for a
 discussion  of charges against him.  The Council then "suspended"
 the thirty two -- an apparent compromise with those who urged ex-
 pulsion.  A formal split and establisl:ient of a rival party ap-
 pear al.?iost inevitable but each of the various factions is ma-
 neuvering to put the onus :nor the final break on another.  If con-
 pr raise forces should succeed in patching up the appearance of a
 unified party, it mould be at least a temporary victory for Mos-
 cow.   In any case, Range's leadership has been seriously weakened
 and may be in jeopardy, one tray or another, before the party con-
 gress   in October.

 775 WFI,a. CUBA:  17FAAT'S BEHIND Tr;" ROD IGUEZ TRIAL?
 25X1C10b
 BACKGROUND:   [For a summary of names, dates and facts, see
 unclassified     tachments in English and Spanish.  These may be
 passed to indigenous assets, but with the caution that they must
 be used as fact sheets and  u o t  reproduced verbatim.}
 The trial of Marcos Rodriguez Alfonso occupied the center
 of attention in Havana during tthe last half of March and served
 to illuminate, more than anything else has done to date, the dis-
 sensions that agitate the ruling clique in Cuba.  Rodri .uez,
 who had been held incommunicado in La Cabana prison since Janu-
 ary 1961, was accused of betraying to Batista's police the hide-
 away of four of the survivers of the student underground group,
 Directorio Revolucionario (DR), that attacked the presidential
 palace on 14 March 1957.  During the second year of his impris-
 onment, Rodriguez wrote a complete confession, the volume of
 which can only be guessed from the lengthy excerpts read at the
 trial.  Many details from the confession and trial proceedings
 indicate that Rodriguez, who was a youth member of the Cuban
 Communist party (Partido Socialista Popular - PSP), had been in-
 filtrated into the DR by the PS?, was a regular informer for
 Batista's police, and in all probability reported the whereabouts
 of the "martyrs of 1rlunboldt 7" on orders of the high command of
 the PSP.
 The first phase of the trial was held behind closed doors,
 and it was clearly Castro's plan not to let the public in on
 this intra-party squabble.  However, Faure Chomon, one of the
 members of the DR and currently Minister of Communications, took
 the opportunity to get even with the leaders of the old PSP
 whom he had reason to believe were implicated in this and other
 crimes against the resistance -movement.  Either he or one of his
 cohorts leaked out information, which  as published in icevolucio:.z,
 official organ of the Castroite wing of the united Cuban Communist
 party (Partido de la Unidad Revolucionaria Socialista - PUPS).
 The trial had begun 14 March, the seventh anniversary of the at -
 tac't on the Presidential palace.  Five days later, Rodriguez was
 convicted as charged and sentenced to die before a firing squad.
 On 21 March, Fidel Castro himself announced that the "con-
 fusions and doubts" sown by "some intriguers" during the trial
 necessitated a new trial, which should be "as public as a trial
 can be."  These pseudo-revolutionary intriguers," he charged,
 would be satisfied with nothing less than "rolling the heads of
 honest revolutionaries" and having the Cuban revolution "devour
 its own sons, like Saturn."  They must be taught a lesson, he
 said.

 The second trial, which was televised and broadcast, was
 essentially a judicial review since no new material witnesses
 were heard nor new evidence adduced, and the accused, though
 physically present (according to televiewers in ;Zey West), took
 essentially no part in the proceedings, only mumbling a barely
 auidble answer to an occasional question.  Castro, President
 Osvaldo Dorticos, and other leaders appeared as "gitnesses" to
 defend the old-line Communists against the "slander" directed
 at them in the first trial.  In a four-and-one-half-hour speech
 on the night of 23-27 March, Castro criticized two prominent
 members of his official family, one a "new" and the other an
 "old" Communist.  lZe charged :sure Chomon with a serious error
 in implying, at the first trial, that the defendant had committed
 the crime because of his Communist affiliation and not, as Castro
 now claimed, in spite of it.  Then he criticized Joaquin Ordoqui,
 now a deputy minister of the armed forces, for taking steps to
 have the prisoner released, thus forcing the government to bring
 him to trial before it was adequately prepared -- this after a
 full three years of detention!
 Castro reserved his bitterest attack, however, for certain
 Cuban newsmen and the newspaper Revolucion in particular for thej:.r
 "lac% of revolutionary responsibility"  n -sensationalizing the
 case and converting it into a political trial.  What these "false"
 reporters had done, he charged, was to try to divide the revolu-
 tion and provide ammunition to the enemy.  Castro's repeated use
 of the tern "sectarianism" in characterizing these attitudes,
 revealed the existence of a schism within the Cuban PURS which
 indicates that Castro, despite his desperate efforts to keep
 aloof from the Sino-Soviet conflict, has not been able to es-
 tablish internal unity either.
 On 1 April, the Cuban Supreme Court upheld the sentence of
 death.  By sacrificing 'Rodriguez,  Castro may hope to appease his
 regime's "new communist supporters.     At the same tine,  the de-
 fendant was technically cleared of the charge 1) that he was a
 regular informer of the police, and 2) that he was doing what he
 did on orders of the PS?.  While this does not make the old guard
 entirely happy, they can be considered to have come off light.
 Thus the government of Cuba has been able to eat its cai.e and
 have it too.
 Cuban radio broadcasts, heard in Miami, have announced that
 Rodriguez was executed Saturday, 18 April.  Even though Castro
 intervened in the trial for the purpose of defending the PS?,
 he did not attempt to save the life of one of its members.
 Rodriguez, a disciplined Communist, was used by the ?arty as an
 instrument and, as such, was sacrificed.
 On balance, it can be concluded that Castro did not feel
 strong enough to oppose the old PS? leaders:  he was venting his
 fury on the "nev" Communists for having put him in an embarras-
 sing situation.
 Toro leading voices of official Communist opinion have ex-
 pressed satisfaction over the cutcone Of the trial:  Rude Pravo,

 of Prague, on 3 April, referred to the correctness of the death
 sentence and reported that lying statements of the defendant
 had been used to introduce divisions within the ?'S.  An article
 in Pravda, 29 March, emphasizes criticism of Faure Chomon and of
 the newspaper Revolucion and congratulates Castro for defending
 "Comrade" Edith  arcia  ?achaca.  Most remarkable, however, is
 Pravda's version, 2 March, of Rodriquez' affiliation with the
 youth sector of the old   ?:
 They [old ward communist] refuted testimony
 alleging that Marcos Rodriguez was a member of the
 organization of Socialist youth.  In particular,
 the assistant director of the paper 1oticias do
 Hoy, Raul Valdez Vivo, who earlier at   3e univer-
 s  y was the leader of the section of Socialist
 Youth, declared that the statement of Faure Chormion
 in the first trial to the effect that Marcos
 Rodriguez was a member of the Socialist Youth
 was wrong.  Marcos Rodriguez, he observed, is the
 product of anti-Communism.
 In spite of the Soviet version, we know that Rodriguez was
 a member of the Communist Youth.  Much of the evidence adducer
 at the trial indicates that he was acting, as an informer, on
 the orders of an older member of the PS?.  It could not !Ave been
 either Edith Garcia Buchaca or her husband Joaquin Ordoqui:  they
 were both out of the country for a year before the event.  That
 is probably why  theirs  were the only PS? names brought out in
 connection with the betrayal of Humboldt 7:  they have a perfect
 alibi.  But Rodriguez was in prison for three years, plenty of
 time for the "new" Communists to find out the identity of the
 "old" Communists who controlled him.  Castro undoubtedly knows,

 776 AF,NE,WH.   Current Attempts to Expand the international Role
 25X1 C10b        of M_ Soviet  ccup a   one o     rmany
 BACKGROUND:  The Soviet Occupied Zone of Germany (also
 referred T'o as'`East Germany," the "Deutsche Demokratische Re-
 publik" or the "GDR") has sought persistently to gain interna-
 tional acceptance as a respectable, sovereign power within the
 framework of the Communist "two Germanys" design.   Taking ad-
 vantage of the politico-economic unrest among neutralist and
 developing countries, the SOZG has had certain successes in its
 quest for some form of official recognition and influence, de-
 spite the threat of West German sanctions against countries
 which recognize the SOZG.  The countries where the Ulbricht
 regime now has some form of representation number 49, ranging
 from so-called "unofficial trade missions" through "official trade
 missions" to consulates, consulates general and full diplomatic
 recognition (embassies), all but one of the latter being in Com-
 munist countries.  The SOZG has succeeded in gaining full diplomatic
 relations with only one non-Communist country, Zanzibar, and
 consular or other lesser relations with eight others.  As
 diligent subordinates of the Soviets, the SOZG representatives
 at "trade missions" in 27 Free World countries are intent on
 converting these to diplomatic rank, while expanding both the
 scope and effectiveness of their propaganda, espionage and sub-
 version mechanisms.
 The SOZG's increased stature in the eyes of certain less
 sophisticated peoples -- including governments of some newly
 independent countries -- has enabled it to assume a growing role
 in promoting Communism in those circles.   Pankow's* most con-
 spicuous recent success came in the wake of the Zanzibar revolt.
 Almost before communications had been restored, Pankow "recog-
 nized" the revolt leaders and hurried one Guenter Fritsch to
 Zanzibar as "Ambassador," thereby heading the recognition rush
 and establishing Fritsch as "Dean of the Diplomatic Corps."
 Pankow now has full diplomatic relations with Zanzibar and has
 built up there an inflated Embassy comprising some 25 persons,
 thus matching in size the Chicom mission and setting a kind of
 precedent for the establishment, or the diplomatic upgrading,
 of SOZG representations in other African countries.  Pankow was
 also quick to send housing and agricultural advisors and a good-
 will deputation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Wolfgang
 Kiesewetter.   The former Chief of the Trade Dept. in Pankow's
 Finance Ministry, Martin Gentsch, has actually become an official
 within the Zanzibar Finance Ministry, serving in the same govern-
 ment with Foreign Minister Babu, who happens also to be on the
 editorial staff of Jacques Verges' pro-Chicom journal, Revolu-
 tion, published in Paris and Lausanne (see Prop Note 40B
 T'Revolution," 6 Jan 64).

 The pattern of the current Pankow expansionist effort is
 further evident in politburo member Bruno Leuschner's January
 1934 tour of Indonesia, Burma, Cambodia, India and Ceylon.   In
 the course of this excursion he persuaded Colombo to elevate
 Pan?.ow's Trade Mission there to Consulate General status, and
 he appears to have laid the groundwork for long-term economic
 cooperation with Cambodia, where the SOZG established a Consu-
 late General in 1063.  The SOZG's Consulate General in Burma
 grew from a Trade Mission.  SOZG Consulates General also exist
 in Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen and Egypt, the latter being headed by
 an "Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Arab
 States."  Syria has a Consulate.  The SOZG classifies its trade
 missions abroad as "official" or "unofficial," the distinction
 being based on whether a given mission includes personnel from
 the Foreign Ministry (Ministerium fuer auswertige Angelegenheiter.
 -- MAA).  Where FAA personne  are present, the senior      employ-*
 ee is usually the chief of the mission.   "Official" trade mis-
 sions are found in Algeria, Austria, Finland, Ghana, Guinea,
 India, Lebanon, Laos, Mali, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.   "Unof-
 icial" trade missions are those which do not (yet) have any
 personnel from the L'IAA and are controlled by the SOZG Chamber of
 Foreign Trade (I;ar mer fuer Aussenhandel - KFA, a creature of the
 SOZG Foreign Trade Ministry) .  Examples are found in Belgium,
 Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Nether-
 lands, Norway, Sweden, Turley, the UK, Uruguay and West Germany.
 Augmenting expansionist efforts abroad, Pankow long has made
 a practice of bringing Afro-Asian personnel from the ranks of
 students, journalists and labor unions to the SOZG for training.
 A recent example of this is the so-called training course for
 African journalists, the "School of Solidarity" at Buc'.ow, near
 Berlin, opened in November 1933.  22 African student journalists
 are now enrolled there from Basutoland, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria,
 N. Rhodesia, South Africa, South-West Africa, and Tan,anyika.
 With one exception, the students for this school were recruited
 by :?ankow entirely from countries where Pankow does not yet have
 even an unofficial trade mission.  The professed purpose of the
 school is to "assist newly independent Afro-Asian states and
 render support to the independence struggle."  Actually the stu-
 dents are indoctrinated to expound malicious anti-Western propa-
 r-anda in Africa and otherwise promote Communist objectives.

 777 AF,FE,NE,WH.   Communist China's Real Attitude toward Colonialism
 25X1C10b             and the Non-white Peoples
 BACKGROUND:  Communist China poses, both in its quarrel with
 the Soviet    non and its hostile belligerence toward the Free World,
 as the foremost opponent of "white imperialism and colonialism" and
 as the self-appointed saviour of the non-white peoples of the world.
 The facts are that the Chicoms are not only guilty of aggression
 against their non-white neighbors in India and Southeast Asia, but
 they persecute the national minorities within their own borders and
 are arrogant toward other colored races.  The Han people, the
 dominant race of mainland China, have a long record of arrogant and
 overbearing treatment of the 40-50 million non-Han national minori-
 ties living in China -- the Mongolians, the Uighurs in Sinkiang, the
 Yi people in the Liang Mountains of Szechuan province, the Thai
 people in Yunnan province, the Miao people in western Hunan province,
 the Tibetans in southern Kansu province and the Koreans in Kirin
 province of Manchuria.   Chinese Communist treatment of these minor-
 ity groups today is similar to the worst examples of the 19th
 century imperialists toward their subject peoples.
 In theory, these minorities are administered as "autonomous"
 regions;  in fact, they are subjected to Han chauvinism, which is
 admitted indirectly by the Chinese Communist press.  The People's
 Daily, the foremost Chicom paper, has admitted on numerous occ sons
 that     is common practice for minorities not to be consulted by
 the government officials who rule them and that government organs
 at a higher level often ignore the desires of the "autonomous" areas
 under their jurisdiction.  These government officials are Han Chinese
 whom the Communist Party has sent to the "autonomous" areas for the
 dual (and contradictory) purpose of subjugating the minority groups
 and of winning them over to the central government.   In a 1957
 address to the Supreme State Council, Mao Tse-tung spoke of the
 national minorities, saying:
 "Less than five percent of the people in China
 occupy more than half of our territory. They
 are tribesmen, once not regarded as part of the
 Chinese race.   We must convert them and convince
 them that they are Chinese."
 The problem is that these peoples do not want to be "Chinese" and
 Han arrogance is unable to comprehend it.  The minority group harbor
 strong suspicions justly based on centuries of subjugation and
 oppression, savage reprisals, and Chinese colonization; they have
 learned by bitter experience that the present rulers in Peking are
 the greatest colonizers of all.  They realize full well that they
 occupy the outlying parts of China that Mao spoke of because they
 have been pushed there by the Han Chinese.  The fact that their
 children are forced to learn Mandarin Chinese in the schools rather
 than their own national languages does nothing to ease or erase
 their antipathy toward the Han race.

 This history of highhanded colonialism by the Han people not
 only reminds the national minorities that their own interests are
 subordinated to the interests of the "sons of Han,"' in some extreme
 cases it stirs them to open revolt.  Tibet provides an outstanding
 case of how China's minorities react to Han Chinese imperialism
 and, in turn, how the Chicoms quell resistance with military action.
 (For an excellent summary of the International Commission of
 Jurists' condemnation of China's aggression against Tibet, see
 Denis Warner's "Hurricane from China," p. 56, the MacMillan Company,
 New York, 1961.  Also, see the Briefly Noted in this issue.)  But
 Tibet is not the only example of how Chicoms use wanton force
 against national minorities.  Among their own minorities, for example,
 Peking wants to subjugate the Chinese Moslems (the Hui's)
 just as it does all other groups under its rule.  The Chicoms have
 admitted that in Kansu Province between April and July 1952, some
 20,000 Moslems staged open rebellion, killed over 3,000 cadres and
 seized three districts before the Chicom Peoples Liberation Army
 mercilessly stamped out the revolt.
 Communist China's attitude toward her neighbors in the Far East
 and Southeast Asia is identical to her attitude toward the ill-fated
 minorities within her own borders.  Her neighbors in Southeast Asia
 understand this perfectly and they live in fear of Chinese oppres-
 sion.                  India's leaders have also come, although more recently, to
 understand the meaning and nature of Chinese imperialism.  Prime
 Minister Nehru has said:
 "The Chinese look down upon every country other
 than their own.  They consider themselves the
 Middle Kingdom, a celestial race, a great country."
 This is a frank evaluation by an Asian neutralist who was at one
 time the Chicoms' chief apologist.
 On the eve of China's second Five Year Plan, Chou En-lai said:
 "We always say that our nation is large in area,
 rich in materials and has a large population.
 However, all the large areas and rich materials
 are in the national minority areas and the Han
 people have only the densely populated areas."
 The national minorities know by now the meaning of this atti-
 tude for them and their natural resources, just as Southeast Asians
 know that the Chinese Communists are envious for example, of the
 rice bowl of South Vietnam, the rubber of Malaya, and particularly
 Indonesia's untold natural wealth in oil, rubber and tin.   In the
 Chinese provinces the inexorable process of colonization     from
 the densely populated areas has been going on for several years
 according to Party plan.  The administrative and military control
 of Peking reaches out with the settlers and the minority peoples,
 once free and unique, become more and more lost to view and absorbed
 by the increasing concentration of this new population.

 VOICES OF REVISION:
 Professor Robert Havemann
 /Following are excerpts from lectures given by Prof Dr. Robert
 Havemann under a heading of "Natural Science Aspects of Philosophi-
 cal Problems" between 18 October 1963 and 7 February 1964 at the
 East Berlin Humboldt University.  These extracts were published in
 Der Spiegel (Hamburg), 25 March 1964, pp 51-52.
 The life source of our cultural development, the blood in the
 veins of human culture, is the many-sided and increasingly compre-
 hensive dissemination of information to all members of society
 regarding all knowledge, all problems, and all questionsof our time
 Reactionary regimes have always striven to keep the people
 ignorant.  They followed their own experience which held that "what
 I do not know does not hurt me."  They counseled their people:   "what
 you do not know will not hurt you."  Thus, they attempted to keep
 the people in ignorance regarding the true state of affairs and,
 furthermore, closed their own eyes in order not to have to see that
 which, after all, everyone else could see....
 A government can only succeed in its important mission when it
 can rely on the active participation of all members of society. This
 support, however, can only be attained when the broad masses of the
 people are constantly informed about all the events and problems
 of their lives....
 One must not deceive people with ready-made answers and subject
 them to officially sanctioned views, since this only misleads them
 into schematic and superficial thought.  Through voluminous informa-
 tion we must make people more and more qualified to comprehend mattam
 We must sponsor a broad debate regarding all questions of the times.
 This is the only way in which the tremendous force of the popular
 masses becomes productively creative not dissipating    itself in
 destructive disagreements.
 Whosoever fears the results of a generally unlimited attempt at
 informing /the people7 and consequently hinders it, thereby creates
 the precise conditions for an unhealthy development.  This proves an
 old thesis of Greek tragedy which states that man brings about his
 own fate in attempting to avert it.
 The concept of freedom is of fundamental significance for
 humanity.  Freedom, as Hegel said, is the recognition of necessity.
 This phrase has frequently been interpreted in a very one-sided,
 very mechanical, and very mean-spirited manner.   It then has the
 character of scholarly presumption.  We are told, condescendingly:
 if you do not recognize that which is necessary -- and this
 necessity has usually been determined by those who say this -- then
 freedom is just what you cannot have, and you are therefore to be
 locked up.

 In other words, one could purchase freedom by doing voluntarily
 that which one must do although one does not at all want to do it.
 With unequaled cynicism, the Nazis wrote above the gates of their
 concentration camps:   "work makes one free."  I have formulated this
 as sharply as possible because this is not the content of /TTegel's7
 precept.   It is, rather, a dreadful distortion.  Any implication of
 such a meaning in connection with /Regel's7 precept is a crass falsi-
 fication.  This derives from the way of thinking according to which
 it is possible to command man's history and then to have it carried
 out.  Fortunately, this does not work.
 And in this method of thinking, there finally emerges only that
 mechanical-materialistic causal form of thought which, unfortunately,
 not only dominates the thinking of reactionary circles but also that
 of many well-meaning progressives....
 Freedom is only worthy of striving for, is only moral, when it
 is not the freedom of /gome7 individuab but the freedom of all; free-
 dom for every man is that which leaves each the opportunity to decide
 according to his will and according to his wishes.  That is freedom.
 Freedom is not a recognition of necessity in the sense that at
 a certain time one can only do a single necessary thing.  On the
 contrary, we only have true freedom when there is a broad choice of
 opportunities for us to pursue or leave aside.   The more one is not
 allowed to do, the less freedom there is.   We want to create a world
 in which all human beings have more and more opportunities so that
 each can act completely according to his individual aspirations, un-
 hindered and unrestricted by regulations, orders, and "principles."
 The French Revolution was followed by Napoleon Bonaparte.   Bona-
 partism is a danger for every revolution.                   In the final years of his
 life, Lenin had already recognized the danger of Bonapartism for the
 Soviet Union and had consequently warned against Stalin's excessive
 power.   Revolution, which fights for freedom, always undergoes a
 change once it has attained power.   Its principal goal is then to
 secure the revolution.   Constantly threatened from within and without,
 it fights to maintain and strengthen its power; and this, in concrete
 terms, is the power of the revolutionaries.  From this situation
 arises Bonapartism.  The militant methods of fighting of the pre-
 revolutionary and revolutionary periods as well as during the revolu-
 tion are carried over into the postrevolutionary era.  Thus, it is
 possible that the battle against the oppressor may temporarily turn
 into a new oppression.
 In the contradiction between socialism and capitalism, which
 appears in the foreground today as if there were nothing else, there
 also lies a unity.  The historical process which we have undergone
 in this century does not mean only:   "there is a world in decline and
 here a world on the rise."  No, both parts of this world exert an
 influence upon the other -- not only through disruption; in a sense,
 they need each other, and not only depend upon each other historically,
 but their development and their further transformation is a single
 total process....

 A constant and intensive interaction between these two parts of
 the world, rather than isolation and separation from each other,
 will hasten the transformation.  Herein I see the deeper meaning of
 peaceful coexistence.  Naturally, this should not mean that the
 revolutionaries should give up their party stand.   On the contrary,
 it is exactly on the intellectual level that they must measure their
 forces.  However, a world can never be transformed if the revolution-
 aries close themselves off and isolate themselves from the remainder
 of the world.  Truly revolutionary ideas do not stop at any border.
 Modern materialism differs from all past philosophies in that
 it does not  design in the mind an absolute and unshakable system
 of all world events and then demand that science drag in all manner
 of proof to support the correctness of the philosophical system.
 Unhappily, this errone~-ts attitude has occasionally appeared... even
 among Marxist philosophers....
 An expert in all d-?.alectic categories and teachings, be he ever
 so per-f- ct, %ould never  it down and say:   "There, now I am absolutely
 prepared;   eery }iell!  Mess .curs the physicists may now come.   I will
 solve their :.^ ? ? i :ms if they simply tell me where the shoe pinches!"
 And if,                   such a super-dialectician still attempts to do
 this, in      t: ir.^.1 analysis, it results only in displeasure and
 anger on all sides; and science will not have been assisted.  This
 procedure is completely nonsensical.
 As long as man is exploited, oppressed, and robbed of freedom,
 as long as people are prevented from freely developing their per-
 sonalities -- we 'shall?not be completely free of these fetters for
 hundreds of years -- these limitations and restrictions on human
 dignity will give rise to impulses to act against society.  The
 impulse to attain power in a society in which man is dominated by
 man is the source of all immorality, stemming from the immorality
 of the social structure.  This striving upward, this urge to subju-
 gate others and to oppress them for personal advantage, is most
 reprehensible.  Nevertheless, it is the normal, completely pervasive
 goal of the overwhelming majority... in societies which have a social
 hierarchy.
 We Germans have developed this effort to strive upwards to per-
 fection.   It is the system of the "bicycle rider" -- to step down-
 ward and bend the back upward.   It is the system of the careerists
 and bootlickers, the coward and the sycophant.  That this phenomenon
 still appears on such a large scale is not, say, a result of this
 reprehensible tendency being a part of a man's nature, but rather
 because he lives in a society in which such strivings give a prospect
 of success and he is constantly surrounded by people who achieve suc-
 cess in this manner.
 Such "morals" basically contradict our inner feelings.  Our
 hopes are directed toward a society of equal rights, toward the dis-
 solution of this stratification of society.   We seek a society of

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070001-3
 free and equal people.  As long as a utopian moral society is not a
 fact we shall always have a conflict.   Even in our efforts for a
 free, democratic, and moral society we shall find ourselves acting
 against our own principles.   Woe unto us if we should rise to the
 top!   We suddenly become people of significance and responsibility,
 men who point the way, and various other ridiculous things of this
 kind.  The more one rises the more one experiences contempt for
 everything beneath one's station.  This is not a human but rather a
 prof_,undly inhuman weakness.
 With a tremendous expenditure of effort, we are building for
 our future and not for the present.  The revolutionaries of this era,
 the leaders of states, must always strive to attain their goals as
 rapidly as psssible.  For as long as the standard of living does
 not correspond to general production, the people will be dissatis-
 fied because they feel themselves cheated in comparison with other
 industrial countries.
 The leaders of a socialist country find themselves in a com-
 plicated position.  The more rapidly they advance toward their goal
 the less they can give their people.  The less they give the people
 the more resistance to their policies arises and the more difficul-
 ties will they encounter.   It is a kind of vicious circle.   If one
 slows down the development of socialism because one accumulates less
 and consumes more, this will make the people more satisfied.  However,
 if one wishes to speed development, the people will be dissatisfied.
 In order to overcome this dissatisfaction and to facilitate
 rapid development one must do everything in one's power to foster
 enthusiasm among the masses....
 The fact that /oapital7 accumulation can only be purchased
 through the personal' sacriTice of millions can easily lead to a
 situation in which anyone who, for the lack of conviction, is not
 prepared for such sacrifice is regarded as an enemy of development.
 Thus, an animosity arises toward everyone who...is not prepared
 without question to adopt the principles of socialist construction.
 Whoever does not enthusiastically participate in this construction
 is finally suspected of being a lackey of enemy ideology or even an
 agent of western capitalism.  All of these things are naturally
 basic phenomena which are foreign and contradictory to true socialism.
 But it is very difficult to escape this danger.
 When in addition there is at the top a man like Stalin, who
 becomes a dictator and considers himself to be absolutely wise and
 all-knowing; when there is a man whose words are constantly being
 broadcast like a gospel; and when a multilithic hierarchy is formed,
 a large political bureaucracy which exercises absolute control over
 the individual, then it is virtually unavoidable that careerists
 and hypocrites without being personally convinced, should gain
 advantage by constantly mouthing big words in order to ingratiate
 themselves at the top.

 In a tremendously effective manner, an extraordinarily tenacious
 and persistent hierarchical system takes form.   It is difficult to
 overcome this hierarchy, even after the necessary insight has been
 gained, even when the system has really already begun to topple and
 more and more people have grasped the fact that it must be overcome.
 The reason it is so difficult to overcome the system is that,
 naturally, under such a system, many people have gained their posi-
 tions and functions not on the basis of real ability but simply on
 the basis of this loathsome ability to be able to...attain such
 positions.
 Nevertheless, the problem is not primarily one of personalities.
 True, personnel changes will be inevitable.  But they are not the
 primary problem, they are the secondary problem.  The thing which
 must change is the internal structure.  That which is necessary,
 that which is vital to socialism and which was lost during the period
 of Stalinism, is democracy,  Without democracy, socialism cannot be
 attained,
 What I have said here, Lenin said again and again with great
 sharpness and clarity,  He warned that democracy was being destroyed
 and he pointed out the dreadful consequences which the destruction
 of democracy must have on the creation of socialism.  Only through
 democracy can we convince the masses of the need to conduct a battle
 for socialism and to win them for this battle.
 One can command and prescribe many things for people but one
 cannot prescribe for them what they should think.     Human thought is
 the only thing which is actually and completely outside the realm
 of any kind of command.  One can only exert an influence upon
 thinking when one is prepared to subject one's viewpoint to criti-
 cism at any time, when one is constantly prepared to argue objec-
 tively and to recognize every objective argument.                     Maximum patience
 with those who think differently, objectivity in political argumen-
 tation and a readiness to recognize and admit one's own errors are
 the basic principles of all political work in socialism; without the
 voluntary preparedness of the masses we can attain little.
 I am an absolute and decided opponent of capital punishment.
 The death sentence is a very bad thing.   I believe that in several
 hundred years there will hardly be any understanding for the fact
 that in the middle of the 20th Century, progressive nations still
 resorted to this type of punishment.   It will be considered barbarism
 which will evoke just as much horror as the thought of cannibalism
 does today....
 In the final analysis, capital punishment is only demanded in
 order to be able to murder political opponents.   In olden times it
 was indeed the right of the dukes and kings to execute persons who
 rebelled against their state and their power personally with the
 sword.  Basically, this condition still prevails wherever the death
 sentence exists today.

 I myself was sentenced to death.   I managed to elude it.  But I
 saw my best friends executed.  This experience made me an uncondi-
 tional opponent of capital punishment.  Nor can I recognize this
 form of punishment if I am told that, after all, there were dreadful
 war criminals, heinous barbarians in human guise, like, for example,
 the supervisors in the concentration camps and prisons, who murdered
 and tortured prisoners.  A modern state must not soil its hands with
 blood simply because others have done so,
 /NOTE:  according to this same issue of Der Spiegel, p.40,
 T66 persons were sentenced to death in the       rom 1949
 to 1962; 108 of these were for political crimes.?
 But in the whole development up till now...what has hampered us
 most has been the tendency -- which came to the fore during the
 period of the personality cult and which is so alien to socialism --
 to eliminate democracy.  Man was being educated to be a hypocrite and
 to be untruthful.  Constantly, political avowals were being demanded
 of him which did not stem from an honest heart.  We must completely
 overcome all of this.  We must openly and unashamedly call it by

 these phenomena of political hypocrisy
 The socialist revolution has consolidated and stabilized itself.
 It has expanded extraordinarily in the economic sphere.   It now has
 the opportunity of dealing with these evils which have developed
 during the first phase.  The revolution has already taken the new
 path -- the path of democratic socialism.

 /Following are excerpts from an article in the Czech-language
 perio-dical Literarni Noviny (Literary News), 18 January 1964,

 In practice we can note a two-fold movement.   In the West,
 alienation continues to grow and is reflected in literature, even
 though the connections are very complicated.   It certainly is not
 a uniform process, and western art is simply loaded with antitheses.
 This also is the reason why we cannot react to it either wholly
 positively or wholly negatively.  As a result of the Stalinist epoch
 we have slept through fifty years of capitalist development, when
 otherwise it would have been possible to carry out an analysis of
 its antitheses persistently, on the basis of Marxist-Leninist
 methods.   It is thus completely logical that, because the windows
 are opened today, youth is embracing everything western.  Of course,
 it would be a terrible mistake if we were to try to keep them from
 it.  Blind, unlimited admiration is a children's disease and will be
 overcome only if youth has complete freedom to observe everything,
 even if it is only the latest fashion.   Intelligent young people will
 recognize, within two years, what is good and what is bad.  First
 we need thorough information about the West.  The rest will follow.
 Today we are faced with a long period of peaceful coexistence,
 and for this reason it certainly is of consequence how the litera-
 ture of the western world will come to terms with its own problems.
 Here, I think, we can again be served by the great example of Thomas
 Mann.   Doctor Faustus contains the whole problem of a fascist world,
 and thus    is boo  w  1 remain one of the great novels of our time.
 Today there exists a fashionable literature in the West which tries
 to demonstrate that this whole alienated world which they reject is
 something artistically interesting at the same time.  Thus, for
 example, there appeared writers in West Germany who have become a
 sort of non-conformist support of the Adenauer regime.  At the same
 time, however, there are also writers who have taken a serious stand
 against the alienated world.  At one time, Sinclair Lewis in his
 Babbitt revealed this alienation in a very sharp satirical form
 which in his day was of gigantic importance.  Twenty years later,
 however, this could not have been done in the same manner.  There
 appear tragicomical works where this struggle against alienation
 rises again (T.  Wolfe, O'Neill), and we are often witnesses of a
 tragic, dramatic battle against personal alienation.   Such as Styron,
 in his novel Set This House on Fire,who points out dialectically
 that the cause   or estrangement-71-ha rich man is his wealth, in a
 pauper his poverty,until there is finally a Raskolnikov-type explo-
 sion.   We must not overlook this.

 The great socialist novel will be created, but it will take a
 while until the socialist writers free themselves from all restraints
 and inner censorship.   They rust seek their allies in the great
 literature of the past and a:.:$o within the whole current of western
 literature, the stz-ucturo of which I have indicated; they must ob-
 serve how the best struggle against alienation.   In time we will
 also find among them political allies.   I'd like to say that this is
 not an exception to Sartre's attitude nor disagreement, but rather
 a supplement, a complement.
 The task of literature is to provide a picture of the gigantic
 alienation which was the product of the Stalinist epoch, and to
 help overcome it.  At the same time, something extremely new had
 been suppressed in that epoch, something that appeared, for instance,
 in Makarenkov's Pedagogic Poem, and it is our duty to bring it back
 to life.  And if It is true   at it is possible to eliminate a
 world-wide armed conflict, and I am convinced that this is true,
 just as I feel that even the cold war will gradually disappear, then
 in the period of peaceful coexistence there will continue a very
 sharp class struggle in new forms, and then our allies will be all
 those who are struggling against estrangement in the capitalist
 world -- not only writers but also sociologists, for example, such
 as the prematurely deceased Wright Mills.   There are sectarians who
 deny the possibility of coexistence, and others, again, hope that
 the class struggle will cease in the period of peaceful coexistence.
 I insist, however, and have insisted as early as 1956 (in an article
 published in the East-German periodical Aufbau /1econstruction7) on
 "tent ium datur":   a new form of class struggle.- Of course, i!' we
 are to understand this we must return to Lenin and place him face to
 face with Stalin.   Even during World War I in 1916 Lenin said of
 sectarians that these are people who imagine that they will create
 two large camps which will scream at each other:   We are for
 socialism!   We are for imperialism!   People who imagine things in
 this manner, said Lenin, will never understand the revolution.
 Matters are much more complicated, individual tendencies intertwine
 with one another, fronts change continuously.

 L4opold Sedar Senghor
 /Following are excerpts from two speeches by I,6opold Sedar
 Senghor, "The African Road to Socialism" and "Senegalese Socialism,"
 published in a collection of Senghor material, On African Socialism
 (New York:   Praeger, 1964), pp. 76-79 and 139-140.1
 From:   The African Road to Socialism
 As for Marxian humanism, which we now propose to discuss, I wises
 first of all to recall its strength and its weakness.   Its strength
 is that, starting from concrete facts, it elaborated the sociological
 realities which the analysis of European society in the mid-nineteen3
 century revealed:   the priority of the economic factor and the class
 struggle.   Its strength is also that it pointed out and renewed the
 notion of alienation.   Its weakness is that it did not carry the
 economic analysis far enough:   It neglected statistics, albeit the
 embryonic statistics then existing.   Its weakness lies above all in
 the fact that, as Marx proceeded in his writing of Capital, he in-
 creasingly stressed materialism and determinism, praxis and means, to
 the detriment of dialectics and ethics -_ in a word, to the detriment
 of man and his freedom.   I shall no longer say, as I did in my Report
 to the detriment of philosophical thought; for, rejecting the spite`
 of his Philosophical Works, Marx surreptitiously and paradoxically
 reintroduced metaphysics in the conclusion. But it is a terribly
 inhuman metap ysics, an atheistic metaphysics in which mind is
 sacrificed to matter, freedom to the determined, man to things. This
 is no doubt what Engels called Marx's "subjective whims."...
 What should be our attitude toward this Marxian humanism?  I
 answer, first, that we should not betray its fruitful contributions
 when faithfulness to it can only lead to lucid transcendence.  But
 West Africans are prone to betray it in both theory and practice,
 through blind allegiance.
 In theory, one betrays Marx by using Marxian dialectics as it
 stands, without changing a comma.  For this is reasoning twice in
 abstraction, the surest way to miss reality.  We must not tire of re-
 peating:   Dialectical materialism is born of history and geography;
 it was born in the nineteenth century in Western Europe.   Conceived
 in th,.t milieu, it was essentially designed to analyze and transform
 it.   Marx often affirmed this.  The proof is that today, in those
 same countries, scientists and philosophers, writers and artists,
 while assimilating Marx's methodological contributions, have gone
 beyond, shaded, and enriched them to penetrate realities no longer
 of the nineteenth but of the twentieth century.
 And what of Asian or African realities?  The Israelis, like the
 Chinese ,have been able to find their Asian road to socialism adapted
 to the spirit and realities of their native soil.   Theirs are exem-
 plary efforts to inspire us.   West African realities are those of
 underdeveloped countries -- peasant countries here, cattle countries
 there -- once feudalistic, but traditionally classless and with no
 wage-earning sector,    They are community* countries where the group
 'e                                                8-03061 A000200070001-3
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070001-3
 holds priority over the individual; they are, especially, religious
 countries, unselfish countries, where money is not King.   Though
 dialectical materialism can help in analyzing our societies, it can-
 not fully interpret them.   It did not even do so (nor does it now)
 in Europe, where we are witnessing a vigorous religious reawakening.
 Even in "Holy Russia," there is a resurgence of spiritual forces,
 with the defeat of false "socialist realism," which, provided peace i
 is preserved, we can anticipate in the near future.
 Therefore, we would betray Marx by applying his method like a
 veneer to West African realities.  We would betray him even more if
 we were to apply but not integrate European political, economic,
 social, and cultural organizations here, whether that of West or
 East, of liberal parliamentarianism or "peoples' democracy."  This
 would strangely betray Man, as well as Negro-African -- I mean
 Negro-Berber -- humanism.
 From a false theory, from a methodology which is inapplicable
 to the object, only im-materialism can result, insofar as matter is
 identified with the concrete:      y an in-humanism can result. In
 fact, the double abstraction just noted lea s us  n the first place t
 to consider man sub specie aeternitatis.  And man of all times and al
 places is no longer man  u  simply a mental image.  For one can
 grasp man's permanent features only through his historical, geographi
 cal, and ethnic background.  And the Negro, like the Berber, did not
 appear during the prehistoric era, not until the Neolithic Age, about
 the fifth millenium B.C.   In the second place, the abstraction con-
 sists in seeing, under a black or copper skin, Marx's man in Africa,
 the European in the Negro or Berber -- and classes struggling to
 conquer purchasing power in a mercantile world presented as an ideal
 of civilization.
 How can one fail to realize that, in these conditions, aliena-
 tion, far from being corrected, will be singularly aggravateU7-For
 T Realienation of the Negro Berber does not stem from Negro-Berber
 capitalism, nor even from European capitalism.  Nor does it stem
 from the class struggle.   Rather, it results from the domination of
 one country over another -- or rather, of one ethnic group over
 another.  Here, political and cultural domination, colored by racism,
 is fused with economic domination.
 Hence, for us, Man is not without a country, nor is he without
 a color or a history, a fatherland or a civilization.   It is West
 African man, our neighbor, exactly defined in time and space.   He is
 Malian, Mauritanian, Eburnian, Wolof, Targui, Songhai, Hausa, Fon, or
 Mossi.   He is a man of flesh and blood, nourished on milk, millet,
 rice, and yams.   He is a man humiliated for centuries, less perhaps
 in his nudity and hunger than in his skin and civilization, in his
 dignity.

 But, ..., what has become of the Marxist theory of the class
 struggle?  In Teilhard's opinion, this is merely one aspect --
 pecu             ar to capitalism -- of a much more general phenomenon:   the
 process of socialization.   I refer you to Volume V of the works of
 Teilhard, entitled L'Avenir de 1'Homme (The Future of Man) and, in
 Volume III, to the article "Les  ni  s humanines naturelles" ("The
 Natural Human Unities"),   As concerned with international life as
 Marx and Engels but more concerned than they with problems of race
 and nation, Teilhard shows us that conflicts between human groups --
 techni oc professional groups or "classes," nations, races -- are
 natural facts; moreover, that they are necessary steps in the proces.:
 of socialization; that we are today, with the Cold War, with class,
 national and racial conflicts, in an age of extreme divergence; but
 that already a movement of pan-human convergence has been set in
 motion by the very tension and the power of our technical means --
 peaceful and military.  From this movement, the planetary civiliza-
 tion will emerge, a symbiosis of all particular civilizations; and
 the scientist invites us, the underdeveloped peoples, to help con-
 struct the Civilization of the Universal.   Marx and Engels did not
 know us.   Teilhard restores our dignity and invites us to the
 dialogue.   He writes:   "Before the last upheavals that awakened the
 earth, peoples were only superficially alive; a world of energies wal
 still asleep within each of them.   Well, I imagine that these powers,
 still dormant within each natural human unity, in Europe, Asia,
 everywhere, are stirring and trying to come to light at this very
 moment; not to oppose and devour one another, but to rejoin and
 interfecundate one another.   Fully conscious nations are needed for
 a total earth."  This is justification for our nationalism and our
 Negritude, all the more so because, according to the paleontologist,
 it was in Black Africa that Homo sapiens first appeared about 30,000
 years ago.

 Predrag Vranicki
 following are excerpts from answers given by Professor
 Vranicki of Zagreb University to questions asked him at the Novi Sad
 (Yugosl:,via) "Tribune of Youth"; this is from material published in
 Vjesnik (Zagreb), 8 March 1964.7
 "Stalinism is still one of the important and essential problems
 of contemporary Marxism.   In its crudest form it has now moved to
 China.   We can analyze Stalinist dogmatism in view of its relationsh
 to the most vital question of the contemporary world, to the questionf
 of coexistence.   We see that in their polemics, Soviet and Chinese
 theoreticians have been waging a war over coexistence, although both
 of them refer to Lenin.   It is really true that each side has found
 in Lenin's books quotations which support its position.   However, in
 the fifties a new era in international relations emerged, while Lenii.
 who spoke from a platform valid in his lifetime, could not have anti-
 cipated the present-day situation.   Instead of analyzing contemporary
 capitalist society, the real distribution of power in the world,
 instead of facing squarely a completely new dilemma -- coexistence
 or the annihiliation of mankind -- the contemporary dogmatists are
 searching in the works of the classics of Marxism for ready-made
 recipes.   Such a non-creative attitude toward the Marxist heritage
 means the abandonment of revolutionary Marxist methodology in deal-
 ing with reality, which inevitably results in serious practical and
 political consequences.   There are situations where the Marxist idea
 cannot be applied by way of analogy.  The responsibility for the
 present-day situation is not borne by the classics of Marxism but
 rather by ourselves."
 Marx did not absolutize the dictatorship of the proletariat as
 a form of working class rule.                              As the next
 step in the process of the socialization of authorities, Marx foresav
 the withering away of the state.   In other words, Marx anticipated
 the disappearance of coercion from social life.  Eo ipso, any dogmati.
 uniformism and isolation of ideas, any Petting of free om of opinion,
 was alien to Marx.  And what is dogmatism?  This is the mastication c
 ideas coming from the supreme political form.  What is opportunism?
 This is the fear of people to think with their own heads.  And what
 are apologetics?  This is when people say 'yes' to everything coming
 from above.

 1957:  -- The attac > on the palace and the
 massacre at Humboldt
 7.  On 14 Marc -E. a group of university students of the so-
 jai lec   re                     rio Revolucionario (DR), in an effort to help
 Fidel Castro, who was already operating in the Sierra
 Laestra, made a suicidal attack ontbo presidential palace
 in Havana, in order to assassinate the dictator-president
 Fulgencio Batista.  The attack failed.  Of the survivors,
 four went into hiding in an apartment at no 7 Humboldt Street:
 Juan Pedro Carbo Servia, Fructuoso Rodriguez, Joe T7estbroo?.,
 and Jose Machado,
 20 April:   In the early morning, a friend of theirs,
 r1arcos Rodriguez Alfonso, 19 years old, a member of the
 youth organization of the Partido Socialista Popular  (PS?
 -- the Cuban Communist party), telephoned to one of Batista',
 police officers,   steban Ventura, that he had some important
 information that could only be transmitted personally.  Ac-
 cording to Rodriguez' confession, Ventura arranged for then
 to meet at three o'clock that afternoon in an apartment in
 Carlos Tercero Street.  During the interview, Rodriguez told
 him where he could find the fugitives.  A few hours later,
 they died in a hail of gunfire from Batista's agents.
 23 April,  or three days after the massacre at Humboldt
 7,           z took up asylum in the Brazilian  mbassy, osten-
 sibly from fear of Batista's police.                    In reality, however,
 the surviving members of theDR already suspected him of in-
 forming, and he was afraid they were going to "execute" him.
 During his stay of a month and a half in the Brazilian
 3;ibassy, he recieved several large sums of money, some say
 as much as 2,000 pesos (dollars), although during the trial
 he swore that he only received $500 from his father.  Also
 while in the embassy, he struck up a close friendship with
 the Brazilian Ambassador, Vasco Leitao ea Cunha and with
 his wife Virginia.  About the middle of June, he departed
 for Costa Rica and afterward went to Mexico and several
 other Latin American countries.
 1~5g;  During this period, before the fall of Batista, one of
 the leaders of the DR, Faure Chomon, currently Minister of
 Transport in the Castro government, tried to seek out I.arcos
 Rodriguez in order presumably to execute him, but was never
 able to catch up with him.  In Mexico, Rodriguez was in
 contact with 3dith Garcia Buchaca, who lived there with her
 husband Joaquin Ordoqui, both hard-core Cuban Communists
 and members of the Central Committee of the PSP.  According
 to his confession, published in part as a result of the
 trial of March 1964, Rodriguez talked to her about his role
 as a police informer in the Humboldt 7 case.   (During the
 trial, incidentally, she denied having received this con-
 fidence and he retracted this detail of his written confes-
 sions.)

 and Fidel Castro ascended to power as the supreme chief.
 A few weeks later, Rodriguez returned to his country. In
 February, or almost as soon as his presence in the country
 was known, he was arrested by Castro's police and inter-
 rogated in the prison of La Cabana.  In spite of the evi-
 dence of his guilt, he was set free, it is assumed as a re-
 sult of secret influence within the W. whose leaders were
 already beginning to occupy important posts in Castro's
 government.
 But Marta Jimenez, widow of Fructuoso Rodriguez; one
 of the victims of Humboldt 7, was carrying out her own in-
 vestigation:  she interviewed two of the agents of 3steban
 Ventura who had some knowledge of the case, but both were
 executed a few hours later, before being able to confront the
 accused informer.  %Text, she was able to show a photograph
 of Rodriguez to another of Ventura's agents, Francisco
 Idirabal.  The latter identified the person as the informer
 of Humboldt 7.  Later on, when he was brought face to face
 with Rodriguez, he refused to identify him, hoping, perhaps,
 to save his own life.  This he did not succeed in doing:
 Mirabal was tried and sentenced on 22 February and executed
 before a firing squad the next day.
 Meanwhile, in May of 1959, Rodriguez went to Prague, on
 an official mission, to study philosophy.  For almost two
 years, he studied, traveled to other iron-curtain countries,
 corresponded with friends in Cuba (among them Ordoqui), and
 made contact from time to time with Cuban visitors, among
 them Juan Marinello, old guard leader of the W.
 1901:      One day, in ':?ague, Rodriguez was visited by a Brazilian
 student who told him the Brazilian ambassador wanted to spea'h
 with him.  The ambassador told him that he had a letter from
 his colleague Vasco Leitao da Cunha, requesting that he warn
 Rodriguez that his life would .be in danger if he returned to
 Cuba.  Leitao offered him asylum in Brazil.  Apparently
 Rodriguez did not attach too much importance to the warning.
 On 10 January 1951, he was arrested by the Czech security
 police.  From Prague, he was transferred to Havana, to the
 prison of La Cabana, where he was kept incommunicado until
 the trial, which began 14 March 1964the seventh anniversary
 of the attack on the pres  en  a  palace,
 1934:      The Trial:  During these three years, it is assumed that
 the veterans of the DR and of the "2G July' movement sought
 to bring the informer of Humboldt 7 to justice, and that
 the Communists of the old ?3p made even greater efforts to
 prevent it.  It is known,  from Fidel Castro himself during
 his four-anal-a- a f-hour harangue in the second trial, that
 Joaquin Ordoqui went to ?resident Osvaldo Dorticos to ash
 that the prisoner be released.

 detailed reports of the trial, while Hoy, the newspaper of
 the Communist old guard, said nothing until the last day,
 when it published a very brief account, stating that Marcos
 Rodriguez had been accused of informing in the well-known
 Humboldt 7 case and condemned to die before a firing squad.
 The sentence was appealed, and Fidel Castro himself
 recommended a judicial review, castigating, at the same
 time, his old comrades of the "26 of July" movement for the
 excessive publicity that had been generated during the trial.
 This new trial, which lasted from 23 to 30 Larch, was tele-
 vised and broadcast via radio so that, according to Castro,
 nothing should be rent secret.  Castro spoke for over four
 hours, explaining all the involved complexities of the case,
 acting at tidies almost like a supreme judge, or a referee
 between two rival factions.  On 1 April 1934, the Supreme
 Court denied the appeal.  As this is being written,
 Rodriguez' execution has not yet taken place, and may or
 may not be carried out depending on the secret inf luences of
 the Communist old guard within the government of Cuba.
 Conclusion:  Three facts stand out in this extra-
 ordinary trial-f
 a) Rodriguez was declared guilty as charged
 and condemned to suffer the extreme penalty.
 Only this could avenge the victims of Humboldt
 7 and satisfy the survivors who, We Faure
 Chomon, were thirsting for vengeance.
 b) All facts presented in the second trial
 were handled to make it appear that the action
 of the accused was spontaneous, personal, an
 isolated instance, that he had no permanent
 connection with Batista's police.  Thus the
 trial proceedings     nowhere show that Rodriguez
 was a Communist agent who had been infiltrated
 among the students of the DR and that he had
 betrayed them on orders of the ?S?.
 c) Iievertheless, it is easy to glimpse in
 more than one place in Fidel Castro's lengthy
 discourse, as well as among the facts that
 came to light in the first trial, that Marcos
 Ridriguez Alfonso was collaborating with
 Batista's police in the same manner that the
 p3? was collaborating with the government of
 the dictator, while Castro and his bearded cot-
 rades were in the Sierra Laestra.
 The betrayal of Humboldt 7 was not, therefore, an iso-
 lated instance.  Rodriguez felt under some obligation to
 talk personally with police agent 3steban Ventura.   If he
 was not already known to Ventura, why did he not give him
 the information by telephone?  In this manner the identity
 of the informer would have remained unknown.

 For years the Soviets and their Satellites have been engaged
 in a massive espionage effort against the non-Communist coun-
 tries of the world.   In this espionage offensive the Soviet and
 Satellite countries ualte use not only of the classic tools of
 espionage, i.e. agents, couriers, codes, secret writing and
 photography, but they also make extensive use of their diplo-
 matic and other missions in the "target countries".   It is a
 well-established fact that Trade Missions are a favorite device
 of the Soviets and Satellites for infiltrating espionage agents
 anc: intelligence officers who ferret out the information desired
 by the Communists.
 While attempts by the East German regime to gain even de
 facto diplomatic recognition abroad have been largely unsuccess-
 i, it has been able to establish a number of official and
 ouasi-official Trade Missions and Trade Delegations in various
 non-C,ounist countries, sometimes under the guise of providing
 economic assistance to less-developed countries.  As one of the
 most subserviant Satellites of the Soviet Unions East Germany is
 actively engaged in promoting the cold war and is dedicated to
 furthering Soviet Comunist objectives in the non-Communist
 areas. While it has been well--ISnov:n for some time that Soviet
