 THE FATE OF COMMUNIST LEADERS
 What is the life expectancy of Communist
 Party leaders trained for positions of
 power at home by foreign Communist powers?
 Communist countries have harbored, trained and sent home many
 a rebel dissident to head Communist regimes.  Communists in
 Exile reports not only on the early purges of these exiles
 while in the Soviet Union (noted members of the CONINTERN for
 example) but, of those who lived to rule Communist regimes in
 Eastern Europe -- e.g., V1ko Chervenko in Bulgaria, Anna Pauker
 in Rumania, Rakosi  and Imre Nagy in Hungary, Rudolf Slansky in
 Czechoslovakia.
 All Communist countries today carry on
 massive programs to indoctrinate foreign
 youth and to train Communists and dissidents
 in the hope of establishing them in power
 in developing countries.
 Youth and dissidents in developing countries might learn some-
 thing from the history of the fate of CP leaders, presented in
 this succinct, background booklet, Communists in Exile.  Current
 news of purges in Cuba, Communist China, of dismissals and dis-
 appearances in the Soviet Union, would serve as additional mate-
 rial on the fate of Communist leaders.

 GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #48                         Commentary             17 Feb-2 Mar 1965
 Principal Developments:
 1.  The 1 March meeting of the "26-party preparatory commission" is
 under way in Moscow, -- but it appears to fall far short of the original
 (and perhaps even the current) Soviet objectives.  Though proceedings are
 shrouded in secrecy, we note:
 a.  Aggravated warfare in Vietnam. has made it impossible for Moscow
 to continue Khrushchev's aloofness;
 b.  The Chinese resumed a flow of belligerent polemics on the eve of
 the meeting (see para. 2).
 c.  All media of the participants refer only to a "consultative meet:
 ing," with no mention of preparing a world conference.
 d.  The 6 parties of the Chinese camp (Albania, China, Indonesia,
 Japan, N. Korea, N. Vietnam) demonstrated solidarity in boycotting
 the meeting, despite Kosygin's last-minute plea.and an ostentatious
 Soviet show of solidarity with N. Vietnam and N. Korea.  The indepenc:i-
 ent Rumanians also stayed away.
 e.  The British delegation arrived several days after the others, with
 a public statement that they decided to attend only because the meet-
 ing would be consultative and not preparatory.  The CPUSA delegates
 are classed only as observers, but this is probably related to the
 new U.S. action to prosecute U.S. Communists as agents of a foreign
 power.
 f.  The group issued a statement on 3 March condemning U.S. imperial.
 ism in Vietnam, -- but it did not go as far as recent Soviet state-
 ments threatening action in support of N. Vietnam.
 g.  Moscow correspondents are agreed that the meeting is discussing
 the problems of the movement, but there is little effort to predict
 the outcome.  One, the Yugoslav Barba?s, says that the meeting has
 agreed that it "should prepare draft documents for international CP
 consultations," but he describes three differing factions on the
 question of holding a world conference  new euphemism: `interna-
 tional consultations").
 2.  After demonstratively publicizing an 18 January attack on :Tru
 shchev and the present revisionists by Australian pro-Chinese Communist
 Hill a week before the meeting date, the Chinese began on the 25th with

 a stream of their own anti-Soviet articles, ostensibly commenting on anti-
 China materials in Soviet (also Czech and Polish) media but filled with
 vituperative attacks on Khrushchevian revisionism still being followed by
 his successors.  Especially harsh is their prefatory note to their 3rd
 volume of collected statements by Khrushchev  - see February 25-26.
 3.  Some unconfirmed clandestine reports indicate that Peking is
 calling on parties to convene for a rival meeting in Peking in the near
 future.  [There is no hard information on this and the reports can not be
 accepted without confirmation.]
 Significance:
 The CPSU finally "succeeded" in at least getting delegates from 18
 parties of the 25 invited to come to Moscow for the long-promoted 1 March
 meeting -- in a world upset by the escalation of warfare in Vietnam and a
 movement rent by dissensions, doubts and fears, and prodded by a resump-
 tion of belligerently hostile Chinese polemics.
 On the surface, it might appear that the CPSU leaders have abandoned
 their original objective of a preparatory meeting to plan for a world con-
 ference and have settled for the so-called "consultative meeting" as a
 face-saving alternative to avoid the appearance of total failure.  This
 would certainly be a further setback of large proportions to Soviet pres-
 tige and influence in the world movement, no matter how they might try to
 divert attention by brandishing the whip of solidarity against the bogey
 of U.S. imperialism.
 However, it is quite possible that the entire Soviet posture at this
 time -- its one-sided emphasis on unity and on fighting the "common enemy"
 and its bland "consultative meeting" formulation -- is largely window-
 dressing, behind which the CPSU is pushing its objective of a world con-
 ference just as diligently as ever.
 On the basis of present evidence, we can only assume that the chances
 are slight that the meeting will produce any agreement on a new draft docu-
 ment of a general line for the movement or on specific plans for a world
 conference.  At the same time, we remain fully aware that the continued --
 or even more exacerbated -- Sino-Soviet conflict may intensify their com-
 petition for "spectacular revolutionary deeds,," thereby further increasing
 additional and enlarged subversion and aggression in all parts of the world.

 CHI ONOTIOGY -- COWUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #48
 17 Feb-2 Mar 1965
 February 6 (delayed):  Italian CP weekly journal Rinascita reports the
 establishment of a "Committee of Initiative for a New Unity of the Left,"
 based in Milan.  Only 3 of the 19 members are from the PCI:  7 are from
 Nenni's PSI; 3 from Vecchietti's PSIUP (left-wing split from PSI); 4 from
 Saragat's Social Democrats; and 2 independents.           Secretary is Vittorio
 Orilla, PSI.
 February 11 (delayed):  Yugoslav Party weekly journal Komunist  carries
 interview with Mario Alicata, Director of PCI daily L'Unita, during
 Belgrade visit, February 3-8.  Asked about the Amendola      rorop  posal for
 creation of a new party to unite the left, Alicata says:  "We have agreed
 that the discussion must be carried forward, but that it is necessary to
 put it on a more solid basis."  He says that "a group of comrades is
 working on a document which will be discussed in the Party and in public,"
 and reviews briefly and generally the problems to be considered.
 February 17:  French CP daily L'Humanite publishes a letter signed by
 about 100 Partyllectuals, mostly professors at the University of
 Paris, asking for a full debate on the role of intellectuals in the Com-
 munist movement, -- together with a strong rebuke by t e Politburo.
 February 18, 20 and. 27: Albanian Party daily Zeri I Popull.it publishes
 3 editorials denouncing the 1Khrushchevite revisionists" for joining
 with the U.S. imperialists in voting against a motion introduced by the
 Albanian delegate to the U.N. General Assembly on the 16th.  (It called
 for resumption of normal voting procedures, which had been suspended to
 avoid a showdown on Article 19.  Only one delegation, Mauritania, voted
 with Albania, with 97 opposed and 13 abstentions.)  The Albanians' final
 blow is the hardest.  "The retreat and ca itulation of the Khrushchevite
 revisionists in the face of the imperi  ist diktat for   journment...
 is in itself a very serious act of treason....  The vote on the Albanian
 motion unmasked the great bluff of the Mt. and the K. revisionists con-
 cerning the alleged 'confrontation of the two great powers."'
 ZIP goes on say that now "the Afro-Asian people can understand why
 the U    insists so on its participation in the next A-A conference....
 (Soviet insistence) means that they intend to weaken and divide the
 anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist front of the people of these con-
 tinents and to halt and paralyze the revolutionary impetus of their
 liberation struggle.  As In other areas, there too they would like to
 propagate the revisionist poison of retreat, compromise, and capitula-
 tion to and collaboration with imperialism...."
 On the 20th, the Peking press supports the Albanian action and men-
 tions only the U.S., the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia as opposing it, adding
 that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. reached a'behind-the-scenes agreement to
 avoid voting.

 February 19:  Yugoslav Radio's Moscow correspondent Sundic reports that,
 despite good connections, or, as in usually stated, reliable sources,
 foreign correspondents is Moscow have ALiled until now to learn anything
 definite about the fate" of the scheduled, drafting commission meeting.
 "It is believed," he says, "that the initiators of the meeting themselves
 are not so enthusiastic about its taking place."  He adds that the ques-
 tion of differences between the majority and the minority of the ICM is
 not longer of much significance; now it is "the question of certain dif-
 ferences in the ranks of the existing majority."
 Februar  1y  9-20:  Moscow publicizes communiques on CPSU meetings with
 Portuguese and Finnish CP delegations.  Both emphasize unanimity of
 views on the need for strengthening the unity of the ICM.  (The latter
 was far more expansive, and covered many aspects of state relations as
 well.)
 February 20-22:     NCNA on 20th publicizes full text of statement by E.F.
 Hill, Chairman of the pro-Chinese dissident CP of Australia (M-L), pub-
 lished in the 18 January issue of his organ Vanguard, denouncing the
 CPSU-proposed 1 March meeting.  Hill adds,:
 "... Khrushchev did untold hares, but his advent had its posi-
 tive side.                                 It revealed clearly the rottenness latent in many Com-
 munist parties....
 "... The revisionists do not know what to do in the present
 circumstances.  They rush hither and thither, and they disagree
 among themselves.  They can never have unity, for revisionism ap-
 proaches problems not from any principle, but from case to case."
 Peking press 2ublishes on 22nd.
 February 21:  East German Party daily Neues Deutschland publishes com-
 munique on discussions with Danish CP delegation 16-19th.  "They estab-
 lished a unanimity of views on basic questions of the Communist movement
 and on efforts undertaken to consolidate unity and cohesion," but with
 no specifics.
 February 21+-25:  Swedish press features reportage and commentary on a
 press conference by Nils Holmberg, veteran Swedish Communist, leader
 of the Chinese-attuned, hard-line SKP dissidents, attacking the Hermansson
 leadership for leading the Party into a swamp of revisionism.  He calls
 for a new Party Congress.
 February 25-26:   NCNA distributes on 25th, and Peking papers print on
 26th, three articles describing "anti-China materials" in Soviet, Polish,
 and Czech media, respectively, and an announcement of Chinese publication
 of the third volume of Khrushchev's statements, together with the full
 text of  an, explanatory publisher's note" which prefaces the volume --
 and which returns to earlier Chinese vitujperation.

 The note begins by recalling that 2 volumes, covering the period
 1932-1953, had been published before K's downfall.  They intend to pub-
 lish "all of the public statements made by K between his assumption of
 the post of First Secretary of the CPSTJ/CC and his fall..."  which 'some
 to as many as 10 million words, truly a flood of putrid verbosity."  Thus,
 the Chinese coUecttio ~l come to as many as 30 volumes," -- and this
 will not include K's "shameful secret anti-Stalin report" at the 20th
 CPSU Congress, because "it was never made pis by the Soviet Union."
 The Chinese say that "modern revisionism bears the label of K," and thus
 the collection will be "an encyclopedia of modern revisionism."
 Following a very brief review of the most detested aspects of K's
 revisionism, the article pays tribute to'Iao, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and
 Stalin as positive teachers, but adds that "we also have teachers by
 negative example in Chiang Kia-shek, the Japanese imperialists, the U.S.
 imperialists, and those in our party who made the mistake of adopting
 left or right opportunist lines.  Those who belittle the role of teachers
 by negative example are not thorough-going dialectical materialists...."
 The old Chinese sarcasm bursts through:
 "We never interfere in the internal affairs of other coun-
 tries and other parties.                              However, we do want, just a bit, to take
 up the cudgel on behalf of K.  Those who spared no efforts in ex-
 tolling K. and who had just pinned medals on his chest suddenly
 about-faced when he fell and gave orders for the confiscation and
 destruction of all his works, photographs, and portraits.  That is
 not quite the way to do things.  Had they not been saying just a
 few days earlier that K had developed M-L, that K was an outstanding
 and talented leader and theoretician...?  They why ... consign to
 flames his works running to 10 million words?  Can it possibly
 prove that K revisionism has been thrown overboard?
 "K's forced exit from the world political stage marked the
 bankruptcy of K revisionishi.  But the sinister spirit of K has not
 departed.  After all, there are larger or smaller groups of people
 in the world, in the Soviet Union, even here in China, who believe
 in K revisionism.  Why?  Because k revisionism does not owe its

 Suslov (made at the CPSU plenum) for intensive study.  Another reports
 that the Polish Political and Economic Yearbook for 1964 contains attacks
 on China.  And the third details a charge, that "Czech papers have made
 vile attacks" on the Albanian UN motion described above.  "Chiming in

 made the proposal at the 'instigation' of China."
 Fe bruary 26:  TASS reports that "the latest issue" of CPSU journal Kom-

 It stresses Soviet "efforts to strengthen, the unity of the socialist

 for an end to the public discussion inside the WCM."
 February 26-27:  NCNA expands on its list of Soviet media recommending
 the use of the Suslov anti-China report, to include Kommunist of the
 Armed Forces, Kommunist of Belorussia, Kommunist of Soviet Latvia, and
 Party Life of the Kazakh SSR.  It adds that "anti-China books and pam-
 phlets in huge quantities  are available in Soviet bookstores, -- and
 were available in the Hall of Columns "even on 13 February when a public
 meeting was held there celebrating the 15th anniversary" of the Sino-
 Soviet treaty:"  Peking press publishes on 27th, and again on March 2.
 February 27-March 3:  Soviet Premier Kosygin visits East Germany in con-
 nection with the opening of the Leipzig Fair.  He is accorded so little
 public attention that speculation is rife:  either he is insisting on a
 new "cult of the nonpersonality," -- or the E. Germans are playing it
 wary because they are convinced that he's only a short-term interim
 premier.
 February 28-March 1:  NCNA distributes and Peking press publishes a
 plashing 3,000-word denunciation of a "recently published" Soviet "anti-
 China book, The International Revolutionary Movement of the Working Class,
 with B.N. Ponomarev, CPSU CC Secretary, as its chief editor.

 March 1 and cont.nuing:  The controversial "26-party meeting' is under
 M on 1 March as scheduled, but it appears to fall far short of Soviet
 objectives.  The proceedings are shrouded'in secrecy, as usual in such
 cases, but the following pertinent information has been published:
 a.  All public statements in media of the participants refer only
 to a "consultative meeting," with no mention of preparations for a
 world conference.
 b.  Only 19 parties, including the CPSU, are represented, with some
 50 delegates present.  Missing are the Albanians, Chinese, Indonesians,
 Japanese, N. Koreans, N. Vietnamese, -- and Rumanians.
 c.  The British delegation arrives I March, several days after the
 others, -- and the CPGB Executive Committee simultaneously releases
 a statement saying that it decided to send representatives only be-
 cause it would be a consultati eveaand not a preparatory meeting.  The
 CPUSA delegates are somew at mysteriously classed as observers rather
 than participants:  the American press comments that this might be
 related to the new move by the U. S. Justice Department to prosecute
 U.S. Communists as agents of a foreign power.
 d.  On 3 March the meeting issues a joint statement condemning U.S.
 imperialism in Vietnam, demanding an end to aggression against N.
 Vietnam and withdrawal of all U.S. personnel from the South.  (The
 statement does not go as far as recent Soviet statements, however,
 and does not imply any action in support of N. Vietnam.)
 e.  Moscow correspondents agree that the meeting is discussing the
 problems of unity in the movement, ideological differences, and the
 role of a. world conference, but there is little effort to predict
 the outcome.  One of them, Yugoslav Boorrba's, says on 2 March that
 the meeting has agreed that it "should prepare draft documents for
 international CP consultations," and then goes on to describe three
 different schools of thought on the question of "convening interna-
 tional consultations" (new euphemism for world conference!):
 "Some believe that everything should be done to convene inter-
 national consultations as soon as  ossible... (which) would afford
 the opportunity for achieving a minimum joint platform of unity with
 the CCP and those parties which support it.

 882.        FAILURES AND SHORTCOMINGS IN SOVIET EDUCATION
 25X1C10b
 SOON:  Soviet educational practices have sometimes been held
 up as a model, not least in the United States.  America.n.education has
 had its problems, while Soviet education has consistently taken more
 interest in the creation of human resources which would strengthen the
 Soviet state.  But all is not well in Soviet education, as various re-
 organizations and the abandonment of much-publicized reforms show.
 (See unclassified attachment for detailed discussion of Soviet education,)
 "r+`                    Problems faced by Soviet education include:
 1.  The tendency, contrary to Communist ideology, for higher
 education to become the prerogative of a closed elite of the
 children of party and'state officials.
 2.  The incompatibility of Party dogma with training encour-
 aging creativity, imagination, and intellectual honesty, and
 with objective scholarly and scientific research.
 3.  The disillusionment of much of Soviet youth with the of-
 ficial ideals of the Party.
 4+. The persistence of antiquated, learning-by-rote methods
 in academic teaching, with students expected to parrot the
 words of their instructors.
 5.  The reduction in the quantity (and therefore also in the
 quality) of academic teaching.
 6.  The failure to develop fruitful vocational education.
 Some of these problems, particularly No. 5, arise largely from the
 national shortage in young manpower, and the lack of good teachers, con-
 sequences of World War II and of Stalin's sacrifice of millions of poten-
 tial parents and teachers in deportations and slave labor camps.  Another
 problem, which concerns all the rest of the world, is the one-sided po-
 litical indoctrination of the population of the world's second strongest
 m,litary power, with dangerous implications for future world stability.
 There are some hopeful developments in Soviet education.  The grip
 of Trofim Lysenko on Soviet biology seems at last to be broken, and F.
 Burlatsky has advocated (in Pravda 10 January 1965) developing political
 science as an independent discipline, although still in a Marxist-Leninis

 framework. It is in the interest of the US that Soviet education become
 more open to opposing viewpoints and more adequate for the world of today.
 It is not in the interest of the US that the Soviet Union should be re-
 garded as an educational model for other, especially developing, countries.  25X1 C1 Oc

 883 AF,FE,TAE,WH      OAS REPORTS:  STNO-SOVIET
 25X1 C 1 INFLICT INCREASES COMMUNIST VIOLENCE
 SITUATION:  A recent publication of the Organization of American
 States has focused attention on an aspect of the quarrel between the USSR
 and Communist China that has been generally neglected.  In a report on
 "The Sino-Soviet Conflict and its Influence on Communist Activities in
 the Americas" the Special Consultative Committee on Security examines,
 country by country, the various aspects of Communist subversion in Latin
 America and concludes:  ..."that the dispute between China and the Soviet
 Union has not diminished the subversive activities of international com-
 munism in the Americas, but that, on the contrary, it constitutes, in
 many countries, a greater incentive for the use of methods of violence."
 It has been said that the Communist has no philosophy; he has only
 a method and a goal.  Certainly the factionalism that divides the Com-
 munist parties of Latin America  is less a result of differences in
 ideology than in methods.  The goal has remained the same:  to bury the
 free world.  The,dispute has been largely concerned with how to go about
 it:  predominantly through peaceful subversion and infiltration, includ-
 ing elections, as Moscow holds; or through terrorism, guerrilla warfare,
 and other forms of violence, as Peking insists.  We should not overlook
 that this is not simply an ideological dispute.  More basically, it is
 a conflict between two countries both of which are seeking control over
 the World Communist Movement and, through it, world domination.  With
 regard to the methods advocated by each side, the OAS report recognizes:
 In effect, the Soviet line, by opposing the Chinese Communist
 line in favor of the use of force, would appear to imply that Russia has
 renounced the use of force, whereas the truth is that Russian Com-
 munism continues its efforts toward world domination regardless of
 methods.
 The majority of the top leaders of the Communist parties in Latin
 America continue to favor the Soviet position.  Pro-Chinese elements have
 come closest to seizing leadership in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru.  In each
 of these three countries there are two separate Communist factions, each
 claiming to be the official party and expelling the other.  In Venezuela,
 the dominant faction, although nominally loyal to Moscow, has supported
 for several years a policy of urban terrorism and guerrilla warfare.
 However, as a result of the failure of the policy of violence to affect
 the elections of December 1963, the Venezuelan CP is currently trying to
 improve its image by calling for a suspension of terroristic acts in the

 cities.  Even so, it is actively supporting guerrilla warfare in the
 rural areas.  In Colombia, a split in the Communist youth movement put
 .the Chinese faction in a dominant position and brought on a wave of
 violence in rural areas and against U.S. companies.
 In all five of the above countries, as well as in a few others
 mentioned in the report, rivalry between the two factions of the Com-
 munist movement apparently causes either an actual increase in violence
 or a vast   increased  otential for violence and guerrilla warfare.  In
 Peru, for example, the potential has certainly increased, although overt
 violence is currently inhibited by a particularly stable political situ-
 ation.
 Most Latin Americans, the OAS report points out, are still living
 in the era of the caudillo -- the political boss, the man on horseback.
 Certainly they are more prone to follow a flesh-and-blood leader than an
 abstract ideal.  Moscow has cleverly exploited this tendency by building
 up the personality of Fidel Castro, who for millions of Latin Americans,
 particularly the radical youth, is a sort of new Messiah.  Castro-Commu-
 nism, or fidelismo, as it is more commonly called, is usually identified
 with advocates of violence, whether of the Moscow or the Peking persuasion.
 The meeting of Latin American Communist parties which took place in
 Havana in November 1964 [Reference C] apparently marked a change in tac-
 tics:  certain sections of the communique have been interpreted as call-
 ing for a shift in emphasis in some countries from legal and peaceful,
 to illegal and violent, methods to be used by the national parties in
 the pursuit of Communist goals.  This does not mean that the Soviet
 directed parties had ever renounced the use of force or that they now
 abjure legal means-.  they use the tactic best suited to their objective
 at a given time and place..
 In addition to the new dangers that may have arisen as a result of
 competition, the OAS report concedes -- courageously, since it was written
 predominantly by Latin Americans -- that the United States, with a politi-
 cally sophisticated population, can afford the luxury of dissent in the
 form of a Communist party:  it has "greater internal immunity" than its
 neighbors to the south.-
 "The special position of the United States, and its independence
 in developing its own policy, can have an effect on the rest of the
 American countries by contributing to the formation of a false con-
 cept of the 'peaceful coexistence' advocated by Russia."
 Also, that phase of the schism which projects the image of a China advo-
 cating violent revolution and a Russia advocating more peaceful approaches
 to the same goal may make the unwary Latin American think ..."that Russia
 has renounced the use of force."                                             25X1 C 1 Ob

 884+, AF, FE, NE           II AFRO-ASIAN CONFERENCE
 Will Malaysia be Allowed to Participate?
 More on Algiers as Site for International Conferences
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:        Six Forums for Sino-Soviet Conflicts. Algiers is the
 venue for six international conferences duringhy , most of which could
 provide a setting for extending Sino-Soviet quarrels, or at least for in-
 tense rivalry to dominate international organizations.  The conflict has
 already disrupted preparations for the conferences, has caused delays,
 and has become a source of embarrassement to Algeria.  Ben Bella is
 trying hard to avoid becoming exclusively aligned with either Moscow or
 Peking.  Algerian inability to complete accommodations for a March
 meeting of Afro-Asian heads of state effectively postponed this group's
 decision as to whether the essentially European Soviet Union should be
 invited to this II Afro-Asian Conference (II Bandung) --perhaps' the most
 important of the six conferences.as the only govt.-to-govt. meeting.
 Afro-Asian Conferences.  Many African and Asian nations deplore that,
 in recent years, international and Afro-Asian conferences have degenera-
 ted into propaganda forums for Sino-Soviet differences; with such
 prospects in view, they probably welcomed having the Conference delayed
 until 29 June, although their foreign policies are not too dissimilar from
 those of the host, Algeria.   Others, like India, clearly prefer no con-
 ference to one that would be dominated by the Chicom or Indonesian organ-
 izers.  The co-sponsoring Indonesians, who have supported the Chicom
 stand on exclusion of the Soviet Union, have been consistently eager to
 have the long planned Conference convened as soon as possible.  They re-
 gard it as a major platform for calling a Conference of New Emerging
 Forces (CONEFO) and reiterating their policy of confrontation against
 Malaysia, which they have labeled a puppet of "imperialism" and, thus, in-
 eligible to attend.
 Malaysia Attendance.  Between now and 24 June when the decision-
 making Foreign Ministers meeting is convened, both the Soviet Union and
 Malaysia will work to convince Afro-Asians that they should be included
 at the II Afro-Asian Conference,  The Soviet Union can present its case
 in many ways.   It can enlist influential nonaligned nations, like India
 --or Yugoslavia for that matter -- to work in its behalf; it can remind
 other countries, which receive substantial Soviet aid, that their bene-
 factor wants to be invited.                               Compared with the Soviet Union, Malaysia

 has limited capabilities for waging its campaign for acceptance.  How-
 ever, a strong Malaysian bid is important because, if Malaysian acceptance
 seemed imminent or were to be accomplished, the Indonesians might withdraw
 or, as the main organizer, force a further postponement.  No matter what
 the Indonesian reaction, the presence of Malaysians at the II Afro-Asian
 Conference would be a victory for moderate and pro-Western forces.
 Malaysia's strongest argument is that it is an (Afro-) Asian nation.
 It has economic problems, like over-specialization, that are common to
 many of the Afro-Asian nations; being an ethnically mixed society (Malays,
 Indians, Chinese), its social and political difficulties are similar to
 those of other Afro-Asian societies.  Indonesia's essentially propagan-
 distic assertion that Malaysia is dominated by a neo-colonialist, im-
 perialist power (Great Britain) has little meaning when subjected to
 closer examination:   of its own choosing,  Malaysia may retain ties (e.g.
 defense) with the United Kingdom; as a member of the Commonwealth, it
 has this privilege as do all former British colonies; former French colo-
 nies enjoy similar special relationships with France.  A more positive
 view finds that such arrangements basically are another form of foreign
 aid.  The contention that Malaysia is an artificial creation is irrele-
 vant:                  as a political entity, it is no more artificial than many other
 former colonial Afro-Asian nations, Indonesia included..
 Indonesia's case against Malaysian attendance is weak, but, more
 important, it is only a facade behind which Indonesian antagonism toward
 Malaysia is ill concealed.  Indonesian-Malaysian hostilities should not
 be allowed to prevent Malaysia's attending.  Differences, of comparable
 magnitude, exist between other Afro-Asian nations fe.g. between Somalia,
 Kenya and Ethiopia 7, but their names appear on the invitation list as
 they should.   One of the purposes of the II Afro-Asian Conference is to
 explore those areas (economic, social and technical) where these countries
 can cooperate despite political differences.   Seen in this light, Malaysia
 has the required credentials, and, turning to the positive, its potential
 for contributing usefully to attacking common Afro-Asian problems, in the
 economic field for instance, is far greater than ultra-nationalistic
 Indonesia's.
 Malaysia should be able to capture the sympathies of many Afro-Asian
 nations.  With behind-the-scenes assistance from Britain, particularly
 among Afro-Asian members of the Commonwealth, Malaysia has been and is
 now actively seeking support.  To this end, Deputy Prime  . Minister Razak
 departp  for East Africa iii; the mi(ddi.  6f .Mare.  Already numerous Afro-
 Asian nations have indicated that they will vote for Malaysia, with India
 as an especially strong proponent of Malaysia's cause.
 Theoretically, any nation which is not committed to the Chicom
 Indonesian "axis" should be willing to back Malaysia's bid.  Indeed, many
 who would find Soviet presence questionable, think that Malaysia shoald
 be invited.  Indonesia's recent withdrawal from the United Nations (ti)
 because Malaysia became a member of the Security Council may work in
 Malaysia's favor.  Those Afro-Asian nations aspiring to a policy of non-
 alignment, i.e. seeking to prevent becoming a battleground for influence

 between East and West and between Moscow and Peking, wish to rely on the
 continued existence of the United Nations.  As a consequence, they have
 expressed disapproval of Indonesia's actions and are likely to be less
 open to Indonesian petitions against Malaysia.  Algeria itself, as host
 to the Afro-Asian Conference, has taken steps to lessen  Indonesia's
 chances for either keeping Malaysia away or launching CONEFO as a com-
 petitor to the UN:  Algeria officially notified Malaysia that the March
 meeting would be postponed, and has also asked U Thant and Quaison-Sackey,
 Afro-Asians holding the two highest offices in the UN, to come to
 Algiers to the Conference.
 Algerian Strategy.  Algeria's posture toward the II Afro-Asian Con-
 ference is symptomatic of a general strategy that it seems to be evolving
 (to cope with the complications that have arisen from its play for a lead-
 ing role in African affairs):  Algeriai's policy toward the Afro-Asian Con-
 ference has been to delay until moderate pro-Afro-Asian elements can be
 brought in to insure that neither of the major Communist powers will have
 a free hand, perhaps if only to maximize its own role in international
 (front) meetings.   Originally they may have encouraged the location of
 Chicom and Soviet backed propaganda centers (i.e. African headquarters
 for international Communist front organizations) and the rash of con-
 ferences in Algiers with a view to deriving advantages from both the
 Soviets and the Chicoms.  From the Soviets, the Algerians receive sub-
 stantial economic and military aid; the Chicoms give only token aid, but
 their militant program for purging Africa of "colonialism" and "neo-
 colonialism" reinforces Algeria's "manifest destiny."  Algeria's current
 handling of the Conference problem may not be entirely to Moscow's
 liking but, on balance, is likely to be more in  its..- favor than Peking's.
 Of the five international Communist front meetings thus far scheduled
 for Algiers in 1965, three could very easily be disrupted by the Sino-
 Soviet dispute.  Preparations for the Ninth World Youth Festival in July
 have already been afflicted.  As a possible consequence and also to en-
 sure that the International Preparatory Committee (dominated by the Soviet-
 controlled World Federation of Democratic Youth and International Union
 of Students) accepts a modicum of an African orientation of the Festival,
 the Algerian Preparatory Committee seeks to assert a role of "co-determina-
 tion."  At the recent Afro-Asian Economic Seminar in February, where
 the Chicoms refrained from their usual harangue, the Algerians seemed to
 be in control.  Of other vulnerable conferences, the Afro-Asian Women's
 meeting has been postponed from April to June, undoubtedly to Algeria's
 satisfaction, and reportedly the Afro-Asian Youth Conference, which is
 not yet firmly scheduled for Algiors, will go begging.
 The Algerians have no apparent ready capability for imposing their
 control over the other two front fonferences now planned for April, the
 Fourth Conference of the Soviet-manipulated World Federation of Teachers'
 Unions (EISE) and the Chicom-Indonesian-dominated Second Conference of
 the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association (AAJA).  In the former, the Soviets
 will probably hew to their usual tactic of not initiating debate of the
 Sino-Soviet rift and, generally, trying to suppress the attempts of
 others to do so.  At the journalists' meeting, the Chicoms will be more

 testimonials from survivors of"the innocent victims of U.S. bombing" and so
 forth.
 Recently the NFLSV representatives in foreign countries have attempted
 to project themselves as the legitimate government of South Vietnam and the
 only true spokesman for the South Vietnamese people.  To support this image
 they have publicized a complete program of political and economic objectives.
 No foreign state has yet recognized the NFLSV as the government for South
 Vietnam, but a number of Communist-originated news releases on the Front say
 that "many governments" already consider the NFLSV to be the "real govern-
 ment" and the international missions of the Front to be "the real diplomatic
 envoys of South Vietnam."  NFLSV propaganda regularly stresses that "over
 one-half the population and two-thirds of the territory of South Vietnam are
 under the control of the Front."  Extensive publicity was given Australian
 Communist journalist Wilfred Burchett's interview with Ngyuen Huu Tho, head
 of the NFLSV, in which Burchett referred to Tho as the "de facto Premier of
 most of South Vietnam" and to the NFLSV as "to all intents and purposes a
 government."  The establishment of a provisional government is undoubtedly
 part of the Communist strategy for South Vietnam and they clearly would like
 to have it established before any international conference on South Vietnam
 takes place in order to demand a role for the NFLSV in the proceedings.
 This is confirmed by the fact that special groups of administrative cadres
 and governmental specialists are now regularly included among the personnel,
 infilitrated from North Vietnam.  (See unclassified attachment for additional

 15 March 1965
 Under Khrushchev, Soviet education underwent much the same impulses,
 negative and positive, as Soviet agriculture.  On the one hand there was
 Khrushchev's penchant for ignoring the advice of competent advisors, and
 for trying short-cuts.  On the other side, there was evidence of his de-
 sire to broak with the Stalinist pattern of bureaucratism and New Class
 privilege.  In education, Khrushchev was defeated even before his re-
 placement as Chairman and First Secretary.
 Proposed Reforms of 1958.  In September 1958, in the heyday of his
 power, Khrushchev proposed a number of reforms in Soviet education.
 First, compulsory education was to be extended from seven years -- the
 legal ideal, which was often not met in practice -- to eight years, after
 which most children would go to work (age 15).  Second, secondary educa-
 tion (to run from the ninth to eleventh year inclusive) should be centered
 on part-time evening and factory schools and correspondence courses, with
 only a small number of full-time secondary schools for especially gifted
 children.  Third, no one should be admitted to a university or higher
 school without two years post-secondary, full-time experience in produc-
 tion work, and the first half of university education should be part-
 time, with students also doing production work during that period.  At
 that time public criticism of Khrushchev's proposals was practically un-
 heard-of, but nevertheless certain educators spoke up and without naming
 the First Secretary, argued against the ideas of combining work and
 study, of establishing schools for the gifted, of interrupting education
 for work, and of evening schools.  Perhaps the critics were emboldened
 to speak by the fact that ideas similar to Khrushchev's had been tried
 out in the period of the First Five Year Plan, and had been abandoned.
 Such criticism, in the USSR, is also likely to reflect the existence of
 undercover support in very high quarters, such as the CPSU Presidium.
 New Class Threatened.  While much of the criticism reflected sound
 educational principles, it was supported by other considerations, too.
 Khrushchev had challenged the Soviet New Class in an area in which any
 privileged class will ardently defend its privileges -- its right to pass
 on a privileged status to its children.  In the post-revolutionary period,
 when a working-class background was required to enter a university, some
 parents forged personal documents to enable their children to continue
 their education.  Stalin dropped the ban on students of "undesirable
 social origin" in December 1935, and fees were introduced for secondary
 education in October 1940, in effect making such education the preroga-
 tive of the New Class,  The fees continued to be required until June,
 1956; their removal, increased the number seeking secondary and higher
 education.  Now Khrushchev was proposing to go further, and to require
 those whom he called "the white-handed ones" -- the children of the elite
 -- to do full-time manual labor for two years and part-time work for
 longer periods.  Like other more or less self-made men, N. S. Khrushchev
 was a great believer in the "school of hard knocks," and somewhat

 resentful of those who had never toiled with their hands.  His proviso
 for full-time schools for gifted children was poor consolation for the
 New Class; after all, their children might not all be gifted.
 Actual Reforms of 1958.  As it turned out, the legislation on
 educational reform, passed in November 1958, significantly modified
 Khrushchev's original plans.   All students were given the right to pro-
 ceed to secondary education after graduating from eight-year schools;
 regular secondary schools were retained, though now devoting one-third
 time to "theoretical and practical production work"; schools for the
 gifted were omitted (except for a few later experiments, and for schools
 in the arts, which already existed); two years of production work gave
 preference for university entrance, but was not absolutely required; the
 requirement for practical work at the university level was slightly re-
 laxed.                  In the case of students in the liberal arts, much less vocational
 work was expected.  Thus the main framework of secondary education was
 preserved, though with some impairment, and the over-all educational
 process was given a hybrid, trade school cum theoretical character.
 Loopholes remained open for the children of the New Class.
 Criticism.  The system did not prove a success.  By 14 September
 1962, Academician A. L. Mints was complaining in Izvestia that voca-
 tional training was having an adverse effect on academic standards.  In
 January 1964, four directors of Moscow secondary schools contributed an
 article to Komsomolskaya Pravda in which they complained that the qual-
 ity of education had deteriorated badly.  Under the  program inaugurated
 in 1958, students in secondary schools were spending four days a week in
 classrooms and two days in nearby factories, often simply killing time
 and picking up bad habits, such as drinking.  On 31 January 1964, Kom-
 somolskaya Pravda reported that at the Riga Electrical Plant seventh
 year pupils learned in one day how to perform operations on which
 eleventh year secondary students had spent two years.
 Neither were there any compensating advantages for the economy.
 Since Soviet factories are often very large, employing almost everyone
 in the area, schools often had only one factory to which they could send
 their students.  The reaction of the students to their exposure to a
 factory was usually a resolve to avoid at all costs spending their lives
 in that factory.  One school sent 185 students to be trained in clothing
 and electric clock manufacture; only 18 remained in these trades.  Out
 of 73 trainees at the Sverdlov plant, only one stayed on.  Often the
 training seems to have been make-work activity, using obsolete machinery.
 Only one narrowly circumscribed specialty was learned, rather than gen-
 eral skills useful in a variety of jobs.  At the same time, qualified
 employees have been needed to train the students, and they and material
 resources have been diverted from production.  More serious, the whole
 educational process was prolonged, keeping youth from genuinely produc-
 tive labor at a time when the manpower shortage, due to the drop in births
 during World War II, was becoming extremely acute.

 New Reforms 1964.  By the beginning of 1964, there were symptoms
 (such as the publication of critical articles) indicating that the 1958
 reforms were being reconsidered.  On 20 June 1964, a decree appeared re-
 ducing the time of study in advanced schools and universities by cutting
 down on the amount of time spent in production work.  On 13 August,
 Izvestia published a similar decree for secondary education, reducing it
 by a year, mainly by trimming down vocational work.  Since pre-secondary
 schooling remains at eight years, secondary schools are now expected to
 cover their curriculum in two years, probably the world's shortest sec-
 ondary school program.  Actually the main reduction in secondary train-
 ing did not occur in 1964, but in 1958 when the custom of spending one
 third of the school week in factories was introduced.  Another current
 development is the "schools of the prolonged day," largely for small
 children, which keep the pupils until 7 or 8 p.m., when their parents
 come home.  These also serve to replace another favorite plan of Khrush-
 chev's, that for the boarding schools or so-called internats, which were
 generally supposed to give priority to children from lower-income fami-
 lies, and which were designed to build "New Soviet Men" by completely
 controlling the child's environment; the internats have proven too costly
 to operate on a large scale, though some still continue.  To meet the
 problem of the shortened secondary school program, some secondary stud-
 ies are being transferred to the seventh and eighth years, and (since
 December 1964) some are simply being dropped, including elements of alge-
 bra, geometry, a survey of foreign literature, and the study of Deanran
 Bedny, Khrushchev's favorite poet.
 Holdovers and Continuing Problems.  One important element of the
 1958 system, an expanded system of night and correspondence schools,
 still remains.  It serves part to provide refresher work for those who
 are completing their two years in the factory between secondary and ad-
 vanced training.  These schools, too, have come in for complaints:  on
 February 1965, Pravda noted that the standards for evening school grad-
 uates were lower than those for graduates of day schools, and that many
 pupils abandon these schools without completing the course.  There is no
 sign, however, that the regime will abandon these schools.
 Various subjects on the curriculum have recently been criticized,
 including agriculture (in connection with the ouster of Lysenko), lan-
 guage (Pravda) 15 January 1965), mathematics (Pravda, 25 November 1964),
 and composition (Izvestia, 17 May 1964).  A general shortcoming of Soviet
 education seems to be that there is too much learning by rote, and too
 little opportunity for independent thought.  While a few Soviet scien-
 tists are unquestionably of top quality, the level of ordinary techni-
 cians does not measure up with that of the West.  In 1962-1963, Paul
 Metzger, a Swiss engineer, spent five months directing the installation
 of the automated controls of a chemical plant at Balakovo, 900 kilometers
 east southeast of Moscow.  Metzger reported:  "The training of a Soviet
 engineer compared at best with that of a Swiss trained mechanic; a Soviet

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000300020008-0
 trained mechanic knew less about how to do things than an untrained
 Swiss worker."  While Metzger's own observation was limited to Balakovo,
 Soviet co-workers assured him that conditions were the same all over the
 USSR.  The exceptional students and graduates are likely to be the chil-
 dren or proteges of elite scientists.  A special school was established
 in Moscow in 1963 to give instruction in advanced mathematics and physics
 to 14 and 15-year-olds; a Soviet teacher reporting on the results stated
 that the pupils were mostly from the families of mathematicians, but
 were by no means all prodigies.
 Privilege and Influence.  In any society which has social inequal-
 ities -- and the USSR is one of these societies -- the children of the
 privileged have advantages.  Mothers are at home to take care of the
 children; they and the fathers are better able to tutor their offspring;
 the parents do more to enrich the cultural experience of the children
 and   expose them to the attractions of science and the axts; the children
 are more likely to have quiet places to study; they will be able to buy
 their own books instead of having to wait to use library copies; and the
 parents will be more aware of the advantages of education, and will prod
 their children into studying harder.  In the USSR more than in most
 countries, the children in a few cities (such as Moscow and Leningrad)
 have better opportunities than other children out in the provinces.
 .Also, in the USSR blest or personal influence can go a long way, and
 there are several crucial points at which this influence may come to
 bear.
 After completing the general primary eight year course, the student
 (at about age 15) who continues his education may go into one of three
 different kinds of schools:  evening schools for individuals working
 full-time on farm or in factory, diplomas from which do not entitle
 their possessors to compete for entry into institutions for higher edu-
 cation; technicums which give specialized and relatively advanced tech-
 nical or managerial training, and the majority of whose graduates do not
 go on to higher institutions; and general education secondary schools,
 which continue to stress academic qualities, and whose graduates form
 most of that 20 per cent which is excused from two years' labor exper-
 ience.  (There are also factory training programs for those not proceed-
 ing with a secondary education.)  About one third of those leaving eight-
 year schooling enter one of the three kinds of secondary schools, and of
 this third, half or more go into the first category, and 25 per cent or
 less into each of the last two. The Soviet New Class naturally uses its
 influence to get its children into the last two types of school, and
 especially into the last one.
 Another point of selection comes at entrance into higher institu-
 tions.  Prestige schools, like the Moscow State University, have four or
 more candidates for every vacancy, while certain provincial teachers'
 training schools have fewer applicants than vacancies.  Soviet officials

 pull whatever wires they can to get their children into prestige insti-
 tutions without performing the two years of manual labor.  It is worth
 noting that students who succeed in continuing their education without
 interruption into post-graduate work can usually evade being drafted for
 military service.
 Character Recommendations.  A Khrushchevian measure, still in effect,
 makes university admission dependent on character recommendations from
 Party officials, the Komsomol, trade unions, and heads of plants or col-
 lective farms.  Party officials also sit on examining boards.  The most
 hard-working and competent workers are supposed to be selected for higher
 schools, -- also the most politically reliable.  As Khrushchev stated in
 November 1956, "We should admit to higher education only the best among
 the best of those who are  dedicated to the cause of Lenin." Further,
 plants or collective farms may subsidize a certain number of their workers
 in study at higher schools, and these need not compete with other appli-
 cants for entry; upon graduation, they are required to return to their
 former place of work.  In many cases, the "higher schools" to which such
 workers are sent are specialized trade schools, not representative of the
 top level of Soviet education.  It is obvious, however, that the general
 requirement for character recommendations from party hacks and factory
 bureaucrats tends to stifle creativity and intellectual honesty.  The
 worst feature is the premium placed on Party orthodoxy, reinforcing the
 efforts of the Soviet educational system to place ideological blinders
 on the youth.  Academic freedom, so highly prized by professors and stu-
 dents elsewhere, is completely missing.  Free dialogue and debate, essen-
 tial for intellectual maturity, are absent.
 Educational Crippling.  That part of the official propaganda which
 seeks to glorify labor and the party leadership probably has little effect.
 Soviet society blatantly contradicts this aspect of the indoctrination
 program.  But other parts, dealing with the theory of economics, modern
 history, politics, literature, and philosophy, are highly successful.
 The picture of the world outside the Bloc is grossly distorted, and in
 this case, there is little available information to contradict the offi-
 cial picture.  In studying the origins of World War II, for example, the
 Soviet student is taught that the British, French, and Americans tried to
 use Hitler in an effort to induce him to attack and defeat the Soviet
 Union:  e.g., "The British Government wanted no part of any collective
 measures [against Ansc.h.luss], for, like the U.S. and French governments,
 it was bent on encouraging Hitler's aggressions"   (G. Deborin, The
 Second World Wax, pp 26-27).  The study of foreign literature was'see
 above) one of the first things to be dropped when the curriculum was
 curtailed.  The state publishing houses produce a flood of literature on
 such themes as "Communism is the Future of Mankind," while non-Communist
 publications are almost completely unavailable.  One result of this sort
 of education is a kind of xenophobia which is sometimes a problem for the
 regime itself; it is no accident that African students at Lumumba Uni-
 versity have found themselves treated as savages of an inferior race.
 Another result is an incapacity for sophisticated thought in politics,

 economics, and philosophy:  there is not enough competition in ideas, and
 there is too much reliance on shibboleths and generalizations, a promi-
 nent feature of Marxist education.  A soviet general writing a serious
 article about anti-missile missiles states that it would be bad for
 "aggressors" to have such weapons, but that it is proper for "peace-loving
 countries" to have them; obviously he means that the capitalist nations
 belong in the former category, and the Communist countries in the latter.
 What is alarming is that after years of conditioning, he may really think
 that non-Communist countries are always aggressors -- and therefore fair
 targets for preventive attack as soon as the USSR is strong enough.  In
 order to shackle the non-Communist press, the Soviets have proposed a
 ban on "war propaganda," but there is actually no place where there is
 more spreading of hatred and glorification of "good" wars, (e.g., "wars
 of national liberation") than in the USSR.

 Hanoi's National Liberation Front Expands Operations
 In September 1960, at a North Vietnamese Communist Party Congress,
 Party First Secretary Le Duan called for the creation of a "broad united
 front" in the South which would have as its ultimate goal the establish-
 ment of a "national democratic coalition government."  In response to
 Le Duan's instructions, the Viet Cong on 20 December 1960 publicly pro-
 claimed formation of the "National Pont for the Liberation of South
 Vietnam."  Shortly thereafter, Hanoi's news and propaganda outlets be-
 gan to applaud and commend every statement and action undertaken by the
 Front.  In February 1961, the NFLSV issued its "Manifesto," a document
 that bears remarkable similarity to the phraseology and the substance
 of Le Duan's speech.
 The Front's most important tasks, according to the Manifesto, were
 to overthrow the Government in Saigon and form a "broad national demo-
 cratic coalition administration" to "negotiate" with North Vietnam on
 "reunification" of the whole country.  This objective of reunification
 of Vietnam under Communist control has not been changed; on the contrary,
 it has been made increasingly clear and insistent.  This fact should pro-
 vide ample discouragement to anyone who believes that a "neutralist"
 solution can be negotiated that would leave South Vietnam free from in-
 terference from the North.
 The domestic tasks outlined in the Manifesto included all of the
 pet slogans that Communists list in such documents:  land reform, full
 employment, low rent, democracy, and social justice.   It also pledged
 a general amnesty for all political prisoners and the elimination of
 foreign cultural influences
 The operation of the NFLSV has been patterned after earlier models
 used by Ho Chi Minh and his lieutenants.  To fight against the Japanese
 during World War II, Ho operated behind the facade of the Viet Minh
 (League for the Independence of Vietnam), which he cast aside when it
 was no longer useful.  Then in 1946, he formed the Lien Viet (Vietnamese
 United Front), this time to mask the Communist direction of the war
 against the French.
 The Communist background of the ostensible leaders of the NFLSV is
 a well-documented matter of public record.  Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho is
 a pro-Communist lawyer who has been involved in Communist political ac-
 tivities in Vietnam since 1947.  The first Secretary General, Nguyen Van
 Hieu, has been a Communist propagandist since 1945 with both the Viet
 Minh and the Viet Cong.  Current Secretary General and Vice Chairman of
 the Front Huynh Tan Phat has been involved in subversive activities since
 the 1930's and is a crypto Communist.  Other leaders of the Front have
 similar records.

 The NFSLV is of course said to be the spokesman for an exceedingly
 wide range of South Vietnamese organizations, including for example,
 Students and Pupils for Liberation, Peasants Union for Liberation, As-
 sociation of Patriotic and Democratic Journalists, Writers and Artists
 for Liberation, Labor Unions for Liberation, Vietnamese Nationalists of
 Chinese Origin for Liberation, Association for the Restoration of Bud-
 dhism and Hoa Hao, and so on almost ad infinitum.  But many of these
 are not really groups at all; they do not have memberships such as bona
 fide organizations do, nor do they represent those people engaged in the
 activity which their name implies, even where there is such an activity.
 These "organizations" are in reality small staffs with very little public
 participation; while their function is to create propaganda, one of their
 most important reasons for existing is simply to be a "member" of the
 NFLSV.  The tactic is used to give the impression that the Front repre-
 sents every social, ethnic, religious, professional, political, and eco-
 nomic group in South Vietnam.  The complete lack of support for the NFLSV
 in South Vietnam has been made perfectly obvious on many occasions, but
 perhaps never more clearly than on the overthrow of the Diem government.
 The Military Revolutionary Committee, in the first hours after the coup,
 issued a declaration restoring democratic freedoms and calling on all
 the South Vietnamese people for support.  The truly democratic groups
 that has been banned by Diem and the real patriots who had been exiled
 returned to South Vietnam to assist in reorganizing the government and
 establishing viable institutions to serve the people.  None of the con-
 stituent members of the NFLSV made any attempt to participate in these
 affairs.
 The most significant "member" of the NFLSV is the People's Revolu-
 tionary Party (PRP), which was formed in early 1962 and openly admits
 its Marxist-Leninist lineage from the original Indochinese Communist
 Party and from the Communist Lao Dong Party of North Vietnam.  Hanoi
 and the Front itself try to give the impression that the PRP is only a
 routine member and that it has no more influence than allegedly non-
 Communist elements in the organization.  Captured Viet Cong documents
 belie this masquerade by stating clearly that the PRP only poses an in-
 dependent party and that it is in fact the Lao Dong Party apparatus in
 South Vietnam; these documents are equally explicit about the PRP's
 vanguard role" in the affairs of the NFLSV.  This being the case,
 Hanoi's attempt to create the appearance of a popular front is further
 exposed.
 Internationally, the NFLSV has permanent missions in Algiers, Berlin,
 Cairo, Djakarta, Havana, Moscow, Peking and Prague.  These offices are
 staffed primarily by propagandists who give lectures, write articles, ar-
 range showings of "documentary" films, and numerous other typical propa-
 ganda activities all designed to show that all blame for the situation
 in South Vietnam lies with the "U.S. and their puppets," and to prove
 that the NFLSV is the "true representative of the South Vietnamese peo-
 ple."

 The Communists are currently stepping up the activities of the
 Front, particularly those activities designed to give it the appearance
 of being the legitimate government of South Vietnam.  Much publicity
 is given to. statements ttat the NFL-,SV is "considered by many people to
 be the reGJ_ go'>ernment of South Vietnarn'F or that the NFLSV representa-
 tives in forei6pi count-G?ies are "received as the real diplomatic envoys
 of South lietnez.."  All of this is part of the Communist plan to insist
 on a prominent role for the NFLSV in any discussions or negotiations that
 may take place on the Vietnamese situation.  The Front can be expected to
 do I.-s utmost to carry out the Its tructions originally given it by the
 Commo-nis-; Lao Doug Party of North Vietnam to form a "coalition" govern-
 ment: and reunite itself with North Vietnam.                         They do not say so, but there
 can be no doubt that the reunification will take place only on Communist
 terms and would mean Communist rule in South as well as North Vietnam.
