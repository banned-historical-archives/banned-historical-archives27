 PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 89th CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION
 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1966
 House of Representatives
 The House met at 12 o'clock noon.
 The Chaplain, Rev. Edward G. Latch,
 D.D., offered the following prayer:
 Truss in the Lord and do good.-Psalm
 37: 3.
 0 God, our Father, eternal source of
 wisdom, power, and love, who art above
 us and within us, who dost keep the
 planets in their courses and 'yet art
 mindful of the faint . whispers of our
 human hearts, before Thee we pause in
 reverence and awe, contemplating the
 grandeur of Thy being, the greatness of
 Thy power, and the glory of Thy love.
 Keep us restless until we find our rest
 in Thee, keep us dissatisfied until we
 find our satisfaction in Thee, keep us in
 weakness until we find our strength in
 Thee.
 Into our lives come appeals for causes,
 some of which are good and some of
 which are not good.  We pray that by
 Thy spirit we may be led-to make wise
 choices that our reactions may be good
 and for the good of all. Help us; to keep
 our minds and hearts responsive to Thee,
 that Thy grace may find an outlet in
 our lives and that we and our Nation
 may be channels for Thy spirit to estab-
 lish justice between men, good will with-
 in men, and peace in our world: through
 Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.

 H.R. 1426, FOR LOWER INTEREST
 RATES, SCIIIJI?t1LED FOR `FLOOR
 ACTION WEDNESDAY
 Mr. PATMAN.  Mr. Speaker, tomor-
 row the House_willopen debate on H.R.
 14026, the low interest bill of the 89th
 Congress.
 ~.    of   l s 11e for all Members
 of this  ollse. -'Phis bill will  lve u s a
 clear-cut vote on low interest vesushigh
 interest, We will know where every
 Member stands on thisissue.,
 H,R. 1402? would lower interest rates
 to 41/z percent on certificates of deposit
 under $100,000 and would put the Con-
 gress plainly on record for lower and
 lower interest rates.  If this bill is en-
 acted, we will have taken a giant step
 in rolling back interest rates nationwide.
 We will have done much to correct the
 serious errors of the Federal Reserve
 Board when it raised interest rates 371/2
 percent last December.
 The American people are watching this
 issue closely. They want concrete action
 to lower interest rates.  They want ac-
 tion to put the homebuilding industry
 back into business.  They want relief
 from this high interest gouging by the
 Federal Reserve Board.  They do not
 want us to pass the buck.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues
 to be on hand tomorrow to join in this
 battle against high interest rates. Later
 in today's RECORD, I shall place a series
 of questions and answers which outline
 basic points about H.R. 14026.
 CORRECTION OF ROLLCALL
 Mr. HORTON.  Mr. Speaker, on roll-
 call No. 203, on August 8, 1966, a quorum
 call, I am recorded as absent. I was pres-
 ent and answered to my name.  I ask
 unanimous consent that the permanent
 RECORD and Journal be corrected accord-
 ingly.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New
 There was no objection.
 CORRECTION OF THE RECORD
 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, on Mon-
 day, August 22, I spoke before this body
 in praise of the East Rochester Senior
 Little League World Champions.  Since
 that date, I have noted that my remarks
 in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of that date
 contain certain errors and omissions
 wbicli I.would, like to sec corrected in the
 permanent RECORD. I therefore ask that
 my remarks of August 22 be amended in
 the permanent RECORD by adding the fol-
 lowing paragraphs and making the indi-
 cated changes. I ask unanimous consent
 that the corrections appear in the REC
 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400110017-8
 No. 149
 ORD at this point and that the permanent
 bound RECORD be corrected accordingly.
 First. Change the second complete
 paragraph on page 19291 to read:
 Little League and East Rochester have
 been partners for many years.  As a matter
 of fact, East Rochester fielded in 1950 one of
 the very first Little League teams in New
 York State.
 Second. In the second complete para-
 graph in column three on page 19291
 hyphenate the words "drum-and-bugle."
 Third. In the fifth complete para-
 graph in column three on page 19291,
 hyphenate the word "co-volunteers."
 Fourth. After  the  ninth  complete
 paragraph on page 19291, add the follow-
 ing paragraph:
 Also, credit must be given to the local
 school officials who have given aid and, sup-
 port to this team, in particular, the mem-
 bers  of  the  School  Board, Mark  Harloff,
 David Topp, Mrs. Jean Doremus, and Ronald
 Spring. Additionally, much support and en-
 couragement came from Louis O'Bourn, Su-
 perintendent of Schools;  Frank O'Donnell,
 Principal of the High School; and Nicholas
 Verzella, Principal of the Junior High School.
 Fifth. Before the first complete para-
 graph and after the paragraph ending
 with the word "victories" on page 19292,
 add the following paragraph:
 Therefore, I want to give credit to various
 officials in the fire department who, in ad-
 dition to Chief Bagley, have made this activ-
 ity  possible.  I  first  want  to  salute                                                                                                                               the
 elected officers of the department: Leamon
 Williams,  President; Bob Connolly,  Vice
 President; Walt Brewer, Secretary;   Earl
 Bechard, Treasurer. Praise should also be
 given to the work of Frank King, 1st Assist-
 ant Fire Chief, and Ed Van Thom, 2nd As-
 sistant Fire Chief.  All of these individuals
 deserve a vote of thanks for the support
 they have given to the East Rochester Little
 Leaguers.
 Sixth. Omit the fourth complete para-
 graph on page 19292, column one, and
 add the following paragraphs:
 Golfers will recall that East Rochester gave
 the Nation Sam Urzetta, winner of the Na-
 tional Amateur and member of two Walker
 Cup teams, and Mike Ferentz, holder of the
 National Public Links Crown in 1948.  Jack
 Dianetti, the great track star, was an East
 Rochesterian, as was Arthur Ritchie,  for-
 mer State 440 Champ.  The 1951 National

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE        September 6, 1966
 Peterson Classic in bowling was rolled by
 East Rochester's Johnny Quinzi, brother of
 Pete Quinzi whom I mentioned a few mo-
 ments ago.  I also want to note that one of
 the young men now at West Point as the
 result of his success in competing for one of
 my service academy appointments, Ken Rice,
 was a standout athlete at East Rochester High
 School and has been a welcome addition to
 athletic teams at the U.S. Military Academy.
 The athletic teams of the East Rochester
 High School have long been highly respected
 for their sportsmanship and their winning
 ways.  Perhaps the most telling example of
 their consistent high performance is the fact
 that the basketball team has participated in
 post-season Section 5 tournament play in
 19 of the past 23 years and has been victor-
 ious in seven of these competitions.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New
 York?
 There was no objection.
 ALLEGATION    THAT    FEDERAL
 "HANDOUTS" ARE BASED ON PO-
 LITICAL FAVORITISM
 (Mr. MIZE asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute and  to  revise       and  extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. MIZE. Mr. Speaker, in a front
 page article in this morning's Washing-
 ton Post entitled "Campaign 66-The
 Battle Begins" among other things, the
 following was stated:
 In the House races, which provide perhaps
 the best national barometer of public sen-
 timent, the Democrats are showing excep-
 tional strength.   This is particularly true
 of the 71 freshmen, who have benefited both
 a large-scale public relations program and
 a lavish flow of Federal projects into their
 districts.
 This implication that Federal "hand-
 outs" are based on political favoritism is
 a serious allegation; so serious, I chal-
 lenge the Democratic leadership to deny
 the truth of the statement.  If they do
 not, we must conclude it is true, and the
 American people should be made aware
 of the ends to which the incumbent ad-
 ministration will go to perpetuate a dan-
 gerous dynasty.
 Mr. Speaker, will the real Democratic
 leadership please stand up?
 NEED TO SEEK REALISTIC ASSIST-
 ANCE FROM ASIAN NATIONS IN
 VIETNAM
 (Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota
 asked and was given permission to ad-
 dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
 vise and extend his remarks.)
 Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota. Mr.
 Speaker, as the war in Vietnam continues
 to escalate, more and more consideration
 is being given here in Washington to a
 suggestion I made a year ago.
 At that time I suggested to President
 Johnson that we must have more coop-
 eration, more participation, and more
 fighting men from our allies in southeast
 Asia.  Members of the Southeast Asia
 Treaty Organization certainly should be
 more interested in helping win this war
 on their very doorsteps-halting the
 takeover of Asia by the Communists.
 We now have 400,000 men in Vietnam
 and experts tell us it will take 750,000
 to end the conflict. I have just written
 the executive ~ department urging the
 President and State Department again
 to seek realistic assistance from these
 Asian nations.
 I also urged them to take positive steps
 toward setting up a peace conference of
 Asian nations with the single objective
 of finding a way to bring this seemingly
 endless war to an honorable conclusion.
 It is obvious that Asians would be more
 receptive to the decisions of an all-Asian
 peace conference than they would to a
 European proposal out of the Geneva
 Conference.  Asians are as deeply loyal
 to their heritage as people of any other
 nation.
 More and more voices are being added
 to those! urging an intensified effort
 toward peace--hastening the day when
 the Vietnam conflict will end.

 ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINIS-
 TER  HENDRIK  VERWOERD  OF
 SOUTH AFRICA
 (Mr. O'HARA of Illinois asked and was
 given permission to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
 it is my painful duty to announce the
 death by assassination at 8:37 a.m. this
 morning of the Prime Minister of South
 Africa, the Honorable Hendrik Verwoerd.
 The stabbing occurred just at the time
 the Parliament was convening and the
 bells were ringing.  The Prime Minister
 was stabbed several times in the neck.
 Efforts were made to give him mouth-ta-
 mouth resuscitation, but he died shortly
 after he was stabbed.
 The assailant, according to the U.S.
 Embassy report, was previously assigned
 to the press gallery and heretofore had
 not been permitted on the assembly
 floor.  Other parliamentary messengers
 said that he was a white man over 6
 feet tall.
 He came from the capital of Mozam-
 bique, according to information supplied
 to the U.S. Embassy.
 Mr. Speaker, Americans deplore assas-
 sination whether in our own or in an-
 other nation. I am shocked by the report
 from South Africa, and I join with all
 Americans in reaffirming our faith that
 the dagger or the bullet of the political
 assassin can only block and never clear
 the road to progress and reform.
 With most Americans, I disagreed
 violently with the Prime Minister on the
 morality of apartheid and on the whole
 concept of government by the minority,
 but I recognized him as a man of deep
 learning, great ability, and of abiding
 conviction in the righteousness of his
 course.  The fact that I disagreed with
 him did not detract from my respect for
 his sincerity and his devotion to his duty
 as he saw it.
 Mary Benson, well known South Afri-
 can authoress, testifying before the Sub-
 committee on .Africa, of which I have the
 honor of being chairman, said:
 I feel an extreme sense of urgency in testi-
 fying to you.
 She had come all the way from South
 Africa and at her own expense especially
 to testify,.
 Miss Benson did not foresee the tragic
 assassination of the Prime Minister, but
 she felt that violence was on the horizon
 in her native country because there were
 wrongs there that trampled upon human
 rights.
 Mr. Speaker, the assassination of the
 Prime Minister will not hasten the hour
 of the correction of those wrongs.
 To the people of South Africa may I
 say for the people of the United States
 that we return to them intensified the
 expressions of horror, indignant resent-
 ment, and sympathy that they in their
 goodness of heart sent to us when assas-
 sination blackened our own horizon.
 ADDITION TO LEGISLATIVE
 PROGRAM
 (Mr. BOGGS asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, first I
 would like to announce for the benefit of
 the Members of the House that on to-
 morrow the conference report on the
 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards
 Act of 1960 will be called up for con-
 sideration in the House.
 Mr. ARENDS.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. BOGGS.   I will be very happy to
 yield to the gentleman.
 Mr. ARENDS.  Will this be the first
 order of business tomorrow?
 Mr. BOGGS.   It is my understanding
 it will be the first order of business.
 Mr. ARENDS.  I thank the gentleman
 from Louisiana.
 MAJORITY LEADER, CARL ALBERT,
 ENTERS BETHESDA NAVAL HOS-
 PITAL
 (Mr. BOGGS asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, I have the
 duty to announce to the House that the
 majority leader, our distinguished and
 beloved colleague, the gentleman from
 Oklahoma [Mr. ALBERT],  entered Be-
 thesda Naval Hospital just a few minutes
 ago. We have been informed by his of
 flee that he has been ordered to rest for
 2 or 3 weeks; he has had a minor coro-
 nary occlusion.                                                                                          The doctors assure us
 there are no complications. I have a copy
 of the release from his office which I will
 ask unanimous consent to include In the
 RECORD.
 The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Louisiana?
 There was no objection.
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, I may say
 I had the privilege of being with our dis-
 tinguished majority leader on Sunday
 night, both with him and his lovely wife,
 and he seemed to be in very good health.
 He said he was tired. He had been mov-
 ing from his home to an apartment. We
 expect to get full reports about him, and
 I am sure he will have a good recovery.
 He is beloved by everybody in the House,
 and I just wanted the Members of the
 House to know of this development.  I

 religious conviction who possessed true and
 abiding compassion for American working
 men, and women. In the latter part of the
 19th Century he applied the Angelic teach-
 ings of Pope Leo' XIII's encyclical Revum
 Novarum in defending the rights of workers
 to organize into trade unions.
 As an alumnus of the Catholic University
 of America I am most pleased to' point out
 that he was the principal founder and the
 first Chancellor of the Catholic University.
 He was so universally admired that in 1911,
 on the occasion of his Golden Jubilee as
 priest and his Silver Jubilee as Cardinal, the
 most distinguished men in the United States,
 without regard to religion, gathered to pay
 him homage.
 As we meet here on Labor Day, 1966 to re-
 dedicate ourselves to the unfinished tasks in
 the labor movement we particularly should
 have before us the bright image of Cardinal
 Gibbons in one of his manifold activities,
 that of defender of a democratic society,.
 Today we have a free society; we can and
 we must preserve it.  We can preserve it
 best if we strengthen and expand the labor
 movement.  Our organizations are truly the
 peoples lobby, working toward the social
 and economic improvement of all citizens,
 organized and unorganized.  In the 1930's
 Franklin Roosevelt recognized the need for
 a  bigger, stronger labor movement.   He
 wanted to strengthen workers at the bar-
 gaining table and he wanted big unions as a
 countervailing force to big business in the
 political and economic processes. Through
 legislative and executive action he created a
 public atmosphere favorable to collective
 bargaining.  Unparalleled growth in union
 membership resulted.-
 After the end of the Roosevelt era the rate
 of union growth declined.  Technological
 change, more white collar workers, and other
 similar., factors have been extremely signifi-
 cant.  Anti-union legislation and less favor-
 able attitudes of government over most of
 the period since World War II have had a
 very negative effect on growth.
 In trying to ascertain the principal rea-
 son as to why the climate for collective bar-
 gaining has been less favorable, my conclu-
 sion is that almost all of the mass commu-
 nication media, including newspapers, radio,
 television and periodicals are biased against
 unions and every day give evidence of such
 bias.
 The influence of advertisers, capital re-
 quirements, employer orientation, etc. ex-
 plain the general 'anti-labor history of the
 mass media but cannot justify it.
 With the guarantee of freedom of the
 press in the First Amendment of the Con-
 stitution goes the obligation of responsibil-
 ity-responsibility to tell citizens the true
 and undistorted facts about the events of
 the day.
 In 1947 an eminent Commission on Free-
 dom of the Press presented a_ Report which,
 in its five requirements, provided a theory
 of responsibility.  The standards proposed
 are applicable to all mass communication
 media. They were:
 L The press must give a truthful, com-
 prehensive, and intelligent account of the
 day's events in a context which gives them
 meaning.
 2. The press must provide a forum for the
 exchange of comment and criticism.
 3. The press must'project a representative
 picture of the constituent groups in the
 society.
 4. The press must present and clarify the
 goals and values of the society.
 5. The press must provide full access to
 the day's intelligence.
 Various  plans  have  been  advanced  to
 achieve these standards as well as similar
 standards, but without success.
 Recently Mr. McGeorge Bundy made a pro-
 posal which I believe is definitely on point.
 In behalf of the Ford Foundation Mr. Bundy
 asked the Federal Communications Commis-
 sion to consider creating a non-profit cor-
 poration to distribute TV programs across
 the country through four fixed satellites, one
 in each time zone.  Savings from the less
 expensive satellite distribution of commercial
 programs would be funneled into non-com-
 mercial or educational TV.
 It is estimated that thirty million dol-
 lars per year could thus be made available
 for educational TV.  Surprisingly, the Amer-
 ican  Broadcasting                                                              Company,  N.B.C.  and
 C.B.S.,  expressed  immediate  approval, in
 principle, of the Ford concept, while reserv-
 ing comment on the details of the plan.
 With stronger signals and adequate financ-
 ing educational TV can bring an exciting new
 dimension to the quality of information, edu-
 cation and culture available to the Ameri-
 can people.  The possibility of free time for
 political candidates is conceicable through
 the new concept.
 All citizens should examine and evaluate
 this new proposal and if it is workable we
 should support it.
 Before closing I wish to publicly thank
 Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle for his stead-
 fast and loyal support of organized labor for
 so many years.  Words cannot convey the
 depth of our appreciation.
 In the coming year let us try, most hum-
 bly, to emulate the righteous zeal of Cardinal
 Gibbons in the pursuit of social justice and
 the preservation of freedom.
 CORPUS CHRISTI PROCLAIMS NA-
 TIONAL PARK SERVICE DAY
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 August 25 was the 50th anniversary of
 the establishment of the National Park
 Service.  I wish to add my congratu-
 lations to the many that were voiced on
 that historic occasion, to this organiza-
 tion which has done so much to conserve
 the natural history of America.
 In Texas, the Service is doing out-
 standing work at Padre Island National
 Seashore, one of the most beautiful un-
 spoiled seashores in America.  It was a
 long tough 4-year fight to get the sea-
 shore approved by Congress, and as the
 author of the act I wish to commend
 the Park Service for t e fine work they
 have done in implementing it.
 Recently  Corpus  Christi,  the  city
 closest to Padre Island, passed a resolu-
 tion'proclaiming August 25, 1966, as Na-
 tional Park Service Day.  I ask unani-
 mous consent that the proclamation be
 printed afthis point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the proc-
 lamation was ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 PROCLAMATION
 Whereas, August 25, 1966, will mark the
 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the
 National Park Service in the Department of
 Interior; and
 Whereas, the purpose of the National Park
 Service is to conserve the scenery and the
 natural and historical objects and the wild-
 life therein and to provide for the enjoyment
 of the same in such manner and by such
 means as will leave them unimpaired for the
 enjoyment of future generations; and
 Whereas, this area will greatly and lastingly
 benefit from the establishment and develop-
 ment Of the Padre Island National Seashore
 area, one of the major recent additions to the
 national parks system:
 Now, therefore, 1, McIver Furman, Mayor
 of the City of Corpus Christi, deem it appro-
 priate tr remind our people of this anniver-
 20911
 sary and its significance in preserving for
 posterity one of Texas' outstanding national
 wonders and to proclaim August 25, 1966, as
 "National Park Service Day" in the City of
 Corpus Christi, and to respectfully urge our
 citizenry to reflect upon our great fortune
 in having a part of this great park system
 virtually at our back door.
 In witness whereof, I have hereunto set
 my hand and caused the Seal of the City of
 Corpus Christi, Texas, to be affixed this 25th
 day of August, 1966.

 THE LIONS PEACE ESSAY CONTEST
 Mr. INOUYE.   Mr. President, as a
 member of Lions International, I was
 most pleased to learn that Lions Interna-
 tional-the world's largest service club
 organization-has announced sponsor-
 ship of the Lions peace essay contest.
 This essay contest is open to any male
 or female who will be 14, but less than
 22 years of age as of January 15, 1967.
 Awards will be made on several levels,
 ranging from the international level to
 the local club level.
 The grand prize winner will receive
 a $25,000 personal educational and/or
 career-assistance grant to be adminis-
 tered by the International Association
 of Lions Clubs.  Each winner in the
 eight world geographical divisions will
 receive a $1,000 cash prize, travel ex-
 pense-paid trip to Lions International
 50th Anniversary Convention in 1967, in
 Chicago, Ill., a gold medal, and a per-
 sonalized division award plaque.
 Mr. Edward M. Lindsey of Lawrence-
 burg, Tenn., international president of
 Lions International, announced the pur-
 pose of the contest is to focus the atten-
 tion of people on the desirability of
 searching for ideas and developing a plan
 toward making world peace a reality.
 Goals of the peace essay contest are:
 First. Discovery of a workable plan for
 world peace.
 Second. Concentration of attention on
 the subject of world peace.
 Third. The accentuation of the mean-
 ing of freedom and liberty.
 This Lions International peace essay
 contest is a most commendable project.
 I trust it will meet with the full support
 of my colleagues.
 *1ETNAM-TESTING GROUND FOR
 THIRD WORLD WAR
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, in an
 article, entitled "This is the Third World
 War," the Economist of London has
 drawn a clear picture of how vital it is
 that the United States resist the so-
 called war of national liberation in Viet-
 nam.  The Economist points out that
 Vietnam, despite what we hear from some
 quarters, is, indeed, the testing ground
 for the theories of Mao Tse-tung and
 Lin Piao, the Red Chinese prophet who
 laid out the strategy of Peking in his
 now famous paper "On People's War" a
 year ago.
 In view of Lin Piao's ascension to ever
 higher power, it behooves us to pay heed
 to his words.  For, as the Economist
 notes, Mao is not backing down from Lin
 Piao's thesis. This is the most impor-

 tant fact about Asia today. I ask unani-
 inous consent that the article, published
 in the Economist for August 20, 1966, be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article

 as follows:
 [From the Economist, Aug. 20, 19661
 THIS IS THE THIRD WORLD  WAR
 There is no Mao but Mao, and Lin Piao
 Is his prophet. That is what the past week's
 events in Peking (see page 719) boil down to.
 The communique from the Chinese com-
 inunists' central committee at the weekend,
 followed by the ominously martial rally in
 Peking on Thursday, with a uniformed Mao
 Tse-tung  presenting  his  "close  friend  in
 combat" Lin Piao to the people, marks out
 unmistakably the path Mao means China
 to follow. It was predictable that the cen-
 tral committee, in the sort of words Stalin
 once made Russians use about him, would
 c(uly declare Mao Tse-tung a genius, "the
 greatest Marxist-Leninist of our era."  After
 the Mao-organised purges of the last four
 months, and his baptism in the Yangtze
 last month, this was inevitable.   Like all
 monopolists of temporal power, from the
 Roman emperors to Stalin, Mao is spending
 his last years in arranging to become a god.
 What was not inevitable is the emergence
 of Marshal Lin Piao as China's number two,
 and the meaning this has for China's foreign
 policy.  The only other Chinese mentioned
 by name among the encomiums to Mao in
 the central committee's communique-and
 twice at that-is Lin Piao.  At Thursday's
 rally in Peking it was Lin Plao who took
 precedence immediately after Mao himself,
 before the country's president and prime
 minister and the communist party's secre-
 tary-general.   It was Lin Piao who made
 the main speech under the approving gaze
 of Chairman Mao. Sick man or not, palely
 self-effacing or not,  the defence minister
 has risen to the rank of Mao's chief assist-
 ant and his successor-apparent.  He has
 clone this partly because he can speak for
 the army, and partly because he has loyally
 used the army as a guinea-pig for the "cul-
 tural revolution" dose of salts with which
 Mao Is now purging the whole country. But
 Lin Piao has probably risen for another
 reason too, and this is bad news.
 A year ago Lin Piao wrote the famous
 article, "On People's War," which said that
 China's foreign policy was to encourage guer-
 rilla wars in the "countryside of the world"-
 Asia, Africa and Latin America-in order to
 encircle and destroy the imperialists in the
 "cities of the world," north America and
 western Europe.  The year that has passed
 since Lin Piao wrote his article has been a
 bad one for China's foreign policy, in Indo-
 nesia, in Africa and now even in North Korea
 (see page 721).  It would have been reason-
 able to expect China to whistle its revolu-
 tionary tune under its breath this year.  Not
 a, bit of it.  The central committee has picked
 out the Lin Piao article for a pat on the back
 as a scientific analysis of "the world revolu-
 tion of our time."  And Mao has picked out
 Lin Piao as his chief assistant.  The meaning
 Is clear.  Mao Tse-tung, now almost mystical
 In his certainty, is not backing down one
 inch from his hopes of ideological expansion.
 This is the most important fact about Asia
 today.  It is the background against which
 the debate on American policy In the Far
 East    has to be measured.  Whether the
 United States has a job to do in Asia is not,
 at bottom, something to be decided in Wash-
 ington.  It has already been decided in Pe-
 king.                The Americans were a Pacific power
 long before they became an Atlantic power.
 In Europe they have generally had a com-
 forting layer of friendly countries between
 them and their main potential enemy, Ger-
 many or Russia.  Across the Pacific, there is
 nothing but cold water.  That is why the
 Americans sent Commodore Perry to Japan
 a century ago, when all they were asking of
 Europe was to be left alone by it. It is why'
 they now have virtually no choice but to
 resist what China is trying to do.  No one
 else can. It will take the other Asians at least.
 a decade to summon up the strength to look.
 after China themselves.  The British are still.
 snarled up in the non-sequitor of thinking
 that belonging to Europe means not belong-
 ing to the rest of the world.  The Russians
 took a long step in the right direction at
 Tashkent this year, when they declared their
 interest in the stability of the Indian sub-
 continent; but they have still not been able
 to bring themselves to say out loud that
 China's idea of  universal  revolution  is  a
 hell of a way to ran the world.   They prob-
 ably will in the end.   But meantime the
 Americans, and the Americans alone, are in
 a position to do something about the prob-
 lem-man of the 1960s: Mao the evangelist,
 with his hot gospel of guerrilla liberation
 tucked under his arm.
 None of this is really in dispute.  Mr. Wal-
 ter Lippmann, the most persistent and in-
 telligent of President Johnson's critics, agrees
 that it is right for the United States to use
 its strength to establish a balance of power
 against the Chinese.  The argument is about
 how  much  strength   will  be  needed,  and
 where it can best be applied.
 It can be argued. that in the end the whole
 business of restraining China's missionary
 zeal may turn out to be much easier than it
 looks right now. China is a very poor country
 indeed.  An article on page 720 argues that
 its chances of ever becoming a rich one, or
 even of building up a modestly successful
 industry, are much dimmer than most people
 have usually assumed.  If China does re-
 main a poor country, its hope of inspiring
 revolutions all around the world will be ra-
 tioned by the amount of help it can actually
 send to would-be revolutionaries.  And that,
 to be fair to Mao. is all he aims to do.  He
 is not an expansionist in the sense of want-
 ing to push China's own territory beyond
 what he considers its historic boundaries.
 He just wants to spread the good word-but
 "out of. the barrel of a gun."   Ten years
 hense, if China is still too poor to export
 many guns and many missionaries, Lin Piao's
 thesis about. "the revolution of our time"
 could look as punctured as President Nas-
 ser's grandiose aims of the 1950s look now.
 This is the optimistic way of looking at
 things.  There is nothing wrong with hoping
 that the worst will not happen.  But it is
 not a basis for policy.  You look so stupid
 if the worst does come.  Until and unless
 there is solid evidence that China does not
 intend to do what Lin Piao says it wants to
 do, or cannot do it, the only safe assumption
 for the Americans or anybody else to make
 is that the Chinese mean every word they
 say.   That is where any sober Asia policy
 starts from.
 That is where it starts from.  Did it really
 have to lead to what is happening In Viet-
 nam?                                                                        Mr. Johnson's critics say that it need
 not have done.  But lately it has looked very
 much as if some of the steam has been going
 out of the critics' arguments. This is not
 because they like this singularly beastly war
 any better than they used to.  Nobody does.
 It is because, if one leaves aside the Marxists
 and the honourable pacifists, a good many of
 the crttes are finding it increasingly hard to
 disagree with the basic premise of Mr. John-
 son's policy--that it is at present America's
 job to try to keep China's evangelism under
 control.  Having accepted that, they then
 find it increasingly hard to suggest any posi-
 tive alternative to doing it in Vietnam.  And
 every time Mao Tse-tung does something
 that seems to justify everybody's worst fears,
 the critics' job gets that much tougher.
 Senator FiuasalcriT, for instance, has not
 taken direct issue with the policy for Asia
 that President Johnson spelled out at White
 Sulphur  Springs  on  July  12th.  He  pre-
 ferred to argue that the President ought to
 have consulted Congress first.  It is an argu-
 ment that would have carried more weight
 if Mr. Truman had consulted Congress be-
 fore deciding that the Americans must take
 over the job of defending Greece and Tur-
 key-the "Truman doctrine"-in 1947.  Mr.
 Lippmann, for his part, has walked into a
 couple of traps.  He tried to argue on July
 26th that there is no connection between the
 guerrilla war in Vietnam ("one small corner
 of the world")   and other possible guerrilla
 wars that might follow it elsewhere.  But
 Marshal Lin Plao saw the connection all right
 for China's purposes in the article on "peo-
 ple's war" that the Peking central commit-
 tee has just commended:
 "The people in other parts of the world
 will see     . that what the Vietnamese peo-
 ple can do, they can do too."
 That was one trap, and Mr. Lippmann
 dropped into it.  The other is bigger and
 deeper, and goes right down to the funda-
 mental question about the whole war: how
 can you defend the non-communist parts of
 Asia unless you are ready to fight a war in
 Asia?  Mr. Lippmann says, quite rightly, that
 with the single exception of Korea in 1950
 the United States has always avoided land
 wars in Asia like the plague.  So he argues
 that the Americans should discharge their
 responsibility to the Asians by means of sea
 and air power alone-which means, in effect,
 by air power deployed from aircraft carriers
 and from islands off the Asian mainland.
 But Mr. Lippmann himself has scathingly
 pointed out how limited the uses of air power
 have been in Vietnam.  If air power has not
 yet succeeded in tipping the scales in a war
 to  which  the  Americans  have  committed
 300,000 troops, how on earth can it protect
 non-communist Asia all by itself?
 The blunt truth is that this is now an
 academic argument.  China has nominated
 Vietnam as a test-case for what it claims to
 be a new kind of war.  It is a land war,
 fought by relatively small formations of very
 brave men who are prepared to persist for
 years with the tactics of ambush and ter-
 rorism until the other side's nerve cracks.
 Those who believe that this technique of
 "people's war" should be opposed, because
 its aim is to set up an unacceptable form of
 society, have little choice but to fight it on
 its own terms: that is, by a land war.  It is
 not the "right war in the right place." De-
 fensive wars seldom are.  It is not the sort
 of war that the Americans will be able to
 bring themselves to fight time and time again
 in other parts of the world.  But if it comes
 out right in Vietnam, it will with luck not
 have to be fought all over again elsewhere.
 if the dissident minority in South Vietnam
 fails to take power by force of arms, dissident
 minorities in other places will think twice
 before they believe Lin Piao's tip that they
 are on to a winner.
 But if the technique of "people's war"
 does succeed in Vietnam, the past week's
 events In Peking will take on a new light.
 Those who do not like the war In Vietnam,
 but equally do not want to see Mao Tse-
 tung's beliefs sweeping across Asia in a wave
 of guerrilla war, have a duty to ask them-
 selves where else they think the wave can be
 stopped.  Thailand?  But the non-commu-
 nist Thais are not going to call for help from
 a defeated American army, and In any case
 it is logically much harder to get help into
 Thailand than into Vietnam.  Burma?  Not
 on the cards.  India, then?  But the mind
 swerves away from the difficulty of doing
 anything to help that fragile country if the
 guerrillas once get to work in West Bengal or
 Kerala or wherever.
 The fighting In Vietnam, it is said, could
 grow into the third world war.  In a sense,
 it already is the third world war.  It is not

 by the Americans' choice that this has be-
 come a testing-ground. for the theories of
 Mao Tse-tung and Lin Plao,  It need not
 have been.  If there were any reasonable
 grounds for thinking that a communist vic-
 tory in Vietnam would not be followed by
 communist bids for power in the rest of
 Asia-starting In Thailand, and moving from
 there towards India-it would not be neces-
 sary to make a stand in Vietnam.  It would
 not be necessary if Lin Piao had not written
 what he has written, and had not now been
 given  Mao's  accolade  for writing it.  It
 would not be necessary if Russia were able
 to assert its authority over the communists,
 of south-east Asia and guarantee that a
 stable truce line, like the line between the
 two parts of Germany, could be drawn along
 the Mekong between a communist Indo-
 china and a non-communist Thailand.  If
 either of those things applied, a deal could
 be done in Vietnam tomorrow.  The only
 losers would be those  South Vietnamese,
 Buddhists and Catholics alike, who keep on
 telling anyone who will listen that they do
 not want to be ruled by communists.  It
 would be a cynical deal; but it could be
 struck.
 The deal the Americans cannot reasonably
 be asked to strike is one that threatens to
 sell the pass to the whole of southern Asia.
 This Is Mr. Johnson's enormous problem.  It
 is also the problem of those who criticise his
 decision to take America into the war. Those
 of them-an increasing number-who agree
 that America has a responsibility towards
 the non-communist nations of Asia cannot
 dodge the question it poses.  How else can
 you suggest holding the line, if not by fight-
 ing in Vietnam?
 SCHOOL MILK EXTENSION PASSED
 BY HOUSE
 Mr. PROXMIRE,  Mr. President, on
 July 12 the Senate passed a child nutri-
 tion bill which among its several pro-
 visions included language extending the
 special milk program for schoolchildren
 through 1970. 1 am happy to say that
 an amended version of this legislation
 passed the House last Thursday. I am
 very hopeful that the Senate will accept
 this House version, which generally fol-
 lows the Senate-passed bill.  The alter-
 native is a time-consuming conference
 which could Jeopardize the final action
 on  this  legislation  before  Congress
 adjourns.
 During my 9 years in the Senate, no
 legislation has received the strong sup-
 port given the school milk extension pro-
 posal. When I introduced a bill making
 the program permanent earlier in the
 year, 67 of my Senate colleagues co-
 sponsored the measure.  Similar bills
 were introduced in the House by well over
 50 Congressmen.
 Consequently, in my estimation, it can
 fairly be said that failure to act with dis-
 patch to approve the House-passed bill,
 or an amended version of the bill as
 agreed on by a conference between the
 two Houses, will thwart the will of a sub-
 stantial majority in both Houses of Con-
 gress. While I salute the House's action,
 I feel that both bodies must recognize
 the urgency of acting quickly to consoli-
 date the gains already made.
 MRS. OLGA T. WEBER, ORIGINATOR

 No. 149-14
 in the eyes of the residents of Lousiville,
 Ohio.  She is the originator of Constitu-
 tion Day celebrations, the founder of the
 Constitution Day Committee, Inc., of
 Louisville, and the reason Louisville be-
 came known as the Constitution Town.
 Mrs. Weber's tireless efforts in promot-
 ing patriotic endeavors are now being
 recognized by the State of Ohio.  An in-
 vitation has been extended to her by the
 Historical Records Association to par-
 ticipate with biographical data for pub-
 lication in "Ohio Lives," the Buckeye
 State's Who's Who.
 I ask unanimous consent that an
 article published in the Louisville Herald
 on August 18 in regard to the honor ac-
 corded Mrs. Weber be printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 "OHIO LIVES"?SEEKS BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA OF
 CONSTITUTION TOWN'S OLGA T. WEBER
 The Historical Record Association proudly
 announces the publication of "Ohio Lives,"
 the Buckeye State's Who's Who!
 Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "There is
 properly no history: only biography."  And
 the Historical Record Association says, "Your
 own life record is an important chapter in
 Ohio History."
 The Association directs this statement to
 those invited to participate with biographical
 data for publication of "Ohio Lives."
 The invitation has been issued to Mrs. Olga
 T. Weber of Louisville and, in part, reads:
 "In recognition of your accomplishments
 and contributions to your community, state
 and nation, you are Invited to be included
 with notable Ohioans In our forthcoming
 publication, "Ohio Lives," the Buckeye Who's
 Who, which is now being produced under the
 editorship of  Dr.  Clyde  Hissong, formerly
 Ohio State Superintendenf of Public Instruc-
 tion."
 It continues: "There is presently a dearth
 of record that gives the life of our present-
 day  leaders.                                                                               Ohio  Lives will  furnish  11-
 braries, schools, newspapers and individuals
 -with a source of carefully selected biographi-
 cal material of Ohioans and will be widely
 distributed in Ohio as., well as in the nation.
 Invitations are being issued to those who are
 designated by  the  supervising  editor,  Dr.
 Hissong, with the assistance and recom-
 mendations of the Editorial Advisory Board.
 They represent leadership in the professions,
 finance, business, agriculture,  politics, re-
 ligion, education and culture in their com-
 munities.  Local   and  state                                                                                       records  are
 studied to determine eligibility of nominees.
 These people are being invited to furnish
 biographical data of themselves to assure
 accuracy of the edition.
 "Ohio Lives will be a handsome volume,
 elaborately printed and permanently bound
 In a rigid artcraft binding with lettering in
 gold.  It will be a beautiful addition to any
 library and a ready source of information
 about prominent Ohioans you know or are
 likely to meet.  It will be tangible records of
 lives  that  will  be  passed  on  to  future
 generations."
 The publication is a public service per-
 formed by a private enterprise organization
 of long experience and enviable record.
 NEED FOR 12-MILE FISHERY ZONE
 Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, it is
 apparent to me that there is consider-
 able doubt on the part of members of the
 House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
 Committee as to the critical value of the
 20913
 passage of the 12-mile fishery zone bill
 in the present Congress.
 I cannot subscribe to the objections of
 some segments of the American fishing
 industry that the bill will adversely affect
 their present relations with South Amer-
 ican nations, off whose shores they pres-
 ently fish. It is my feeling that a strong
 position in behalf of America's fishermen
 by reserving this additional 9-mile pro-
 tective and conservation zone will assist
 us immeasurably in our international
 negotiations on fisheries questions.  If
 we do not take action on this matter in
 the 69th Congress, it seems to me that
 we are clearly advising the world fish-
 eries community that America does not
 care very much about her fishermen, and
 further, welcomes the plunder of her ad-
 jacent coastal resources.
 It is intolerable that the United States
 should be forced to negotiate a 12-mile
 agreement with the Soviet Union.  The
 Soviets have 12-mile protection, and our
 fishermen are certainly deserving of
 equal consideration.  Everyday of delay
 means that tons more of these resources
 are finding their way into the holds of
 the Soviet fleet, while our own fishermen
 suffer from the antiquated protection of
 3 miles.
 There seems to be no question that
 some segments of the American fishery
 Industry have made a convincing case
 against this apparent need. Mr. George
 Johansen, the secretary-treasurer of the
 Alaska Fishermen's Union, whose juris-
 diction also extends to crewmen aboard
 coastal  trawlers,  has  written  some
 thoughtful answers to the case made by
 the American tuna fishermen who fish
 off South America. It seems to me that
 this discussion is of such interest that it
 should be made available to every Mem-
 ber of Congress.
 I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Jo-
 hansen's letter be printed at this point
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter was
 ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as
 follows:
 ALASKA FISHERMEN'S UNION,
 Seattle, Wash., August 5, 1966.
 To: Washington State, congressional delega-
 tion and other Members of Congress.
 Subject: The conservation and preservation
 of U.S. coastal fishery stocks.
 GENTLEMEN:  It has been brought to our
 attention that during the recent discussions
 on HR 9531 (the 12-mile limit fishery bill),
 the tuna industry advanced a number of
 reasons why this bill or similar bills should
 not be reported at this time.  We do not be-
 lieve those reasons to be valid.                                                                                                 We feel that
 if Congress were to follow the "no action"
 recommendations, not only would the United
 States lose a big part of its domestic fisheries,
 but more importantly, we would lose respect
 and could conceivably be subject to addi-
 tional abuses from those countries which
 have  made  excessive  claims  for  fishery
 jurisdiction.
 Following are the reasons advanced by the
 tuna industry why HR 9531 or any similar
 bills should not be reported at this time, and
 our replies:
 1. No action should be taken until the
 technical discussions recently agreed to by
 the USSR and which are about to take place
 have come to a final conclusion.
 Answer: If the United States fails to ex-
 hibit proper concern at this time as to coastal
 fishery  resources  by  rejecting  legislation
 which will provide considerable protection in

 the immediate future, it can only have the
 effect of encouraging increased fishing ef-
 forts by Russia, and, in the final analysis,
 will make a meaningful treaty or agreement
 more difficult to obtain.  It should also be
 noted Russia has already adopted the 12-mile
 limit.
 2. No action should be taken until S.J. Res.
 29 has been enacted and a report submitted.
 At this time we do not know the extent and
 importance  of  the  domestic  resources
 actually involved.
 Answer: We are strong believers in the
 intent and purpose of S.J. Res. 29.  It is
 regrettable legislation of this type was not
 enacted several years ago.  However, this
 Joint Resolution provides for a rather ex-
 tensive undertaking, one which could not be
 concluded within a short period of time.
 The millions upon millions of pounds of
 fish harvested weekly and monthly by the
 Russians do not allow for an unlimited wait-
 ing time, but call for action NOW, not some-
 time in the future.  Their take is approxi-
 mately one hundred million pounds as of
 this date, and will exceed a quarter billion
 pounds at the end of 1968.
 8. No action should be taken until we have
 better data concerning the possible impact
 on U.S.-based distant water fisheries, e.g.
 shrimp and tuna, both of which are fished
 to an important degree Inside 12 miles of
 the coast of, and around islands belonging
 to, other countries.
 Answer: One must assume that most of
 the fish caught by United States citizens on
 foreign coasts consist of tuna.  Contrary to
 arguments advanced by the tuna industry,
 passage of this legislation would not bring
 about a change for the worse, as far as con-
 ditions which now exist with respect to
 American fishermen fishing in South Ameri-
 can waters, in our opinion.  These South
 American countries have already promul-
 gated fishery limits far in excess of anything
 contemplated by HR 9531.  It is reasonable
 to assume they will continue their harassing
 efforts in the future, and we see no reason
 why the passage or non-passage of this bill
 would make any difference.  In any event,
 charity begins at home-we are far more
 concerned with the fisheries resources im-
 mediately adjacent to our coasts.  We be-
 lieve it is the responsibility of the United
 States to protect the stocks that have been
 so carefully preserved for the use of present
 and future generations, as far as it is possi-
 ble for us to do so.
 4. No action should be taken until the
 Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries
 has had an opportunity to hold more exten-
 sive hearings to receive the testimony of ex-
 perts in the field of international law of the
 sea in an atmosphere not characterized by
 the hysteria and emotions generated by the
 recent Russian activities.
 Answer: We can understand the reluctance
 of an industry (which, in the nature of its
 business, is fishing off foreign shores) to ac-
 cept any restrictions in relation to extension
 of fishery limits.  We do not believe the ex-
 tension of our present territorial 3-mile limit
 to twelve miles for fishery purposes presents
 any complications in the field of interna-
 tional law.  The table inserted in the Senate
 hearings on S. 2218 shows an overwhelming
 majority of the world's coastal nations have
 adopted a fishery limit of more than three
 miles.  In a letter to Senator Magnuson,
 Douglas MacArthur II, Assistant Secretary
 for Congressional Relations stated:
 "In view of the recent developments in in-
 ternational practice, action by the United
 States at this time to establish an exclusive
 fishery zone extending 9 miles beyond the
 territorial sea would not be contrary to in-
 ternational law and it should be emphasized
 that such action would not extend the ter-
 ritorial sea beyond our traditional 3-mile
 limit and would not affect such traditional
 freedoms of the sea as freedom of navigation
 or of overflying."
 While there have been considerable ex-
 changes of views between countries because
 of the extension of fishery limits, there has
 been no serious challenge as to the validity
 of these actions (taken mostly on a uni-
 lateral basis) under international law.  We
 do not subscribe to a philosophy which
 makes it possible for other countries to take
 unilateral action but which denies this same
 privilege to the United States.  In our opin-
 ion, if these actions that have already been
 accomplished by those coastal nations which
 extended their fishery limits did not produce
 complications under international law, the
 fact that the United States followed the ex-
 ample by the majority of nations should ren-
 der international law complications exceed-
 ingly remote.
 Of course, if the opponents of H.R. 9531
 succeeded, in entangling this proposed legis-
 lation in a number of international law ques-
 tions, this would, of course, produce endless
 delays and give Russia and Japan ample time
 to decimate United States coastal fisheries
 resources,
 5. No action should be taken until an at-
 tempt has been made to implement the 1958
 Geneva Convention on Fishing and Conserva-
 tion of the Living Resources of the High Seas,
 and the results of that effort analyzed.
 Answer: We believe the 1958 Geneva Con-
 vention on Fishing and Conservation of the
 Living Resources of the High Seas should. be
 implemented at the earliest possible moment
 and that general rules for conservation and
 contiguous zones encompassing the inhabited
 areas of the fishery stocks in question, should
 be established.  However, it appears to us
 that extending, such contiguous conservation
 zones from the 12-mile limit instead of the 3-
 miles, will enhance the protection for United
 States stocks.
 6. No action should be taken on the basis
 that this legislation provides any real pro-
 tection to stocks of fish contiguous to our
 coast.  Except for limited stocks of shrimp
 and crab off the west coast states, most other
 species migrate freely beyond any 12-mile
 line.
 Answer: In the nature of things, one must
 crawl before he can walk.  In order to ob-
 tain complete protection for our coastal
 stocks of fish, our present territorial limits
 would have to be extended several hundred
 miles.   We cannot reasonably expect such
 results, and therefore we consider the present
 legislation a good start in the right direction.
 We would gain much protection in the State
 of Alaska where 12 miles would prohibit the
 entry of foreign fishermen in a good many
 inlets and bays now open to international
 fishing.  One must consider that any distance
 one can remove a foreign fishery vessel from
 our shoreline is a help.  With the pressure
 of Japan and Russia steadily increasing, we
 need all the help we can get.  This is ex-
 ceptionally true legislatively because federal
 legislation enacted into law is a declaration-
 more than by any other means-of the pur-
 pose and intent of Congress to render its
 best efforts to preserve and protect our fish-
 eries.
 7. No actions should be taken on the basis
 that this legislation solves any of the prob-
 lems confronting our coastal fisheries.  No
 single witness claimed the bills are any more
 than "a step in the right direction".
 Answer: We, of course, agree with the tuna
 Industry that it Is not a complete package.
 We do need contiguous fishery conservation
 zones in addition to what this legislation
 will accomplish.  It would be most desirable
 to find complete solutions, but seldom? if
 ever, are such results obtained-except by
 degrees.  Steps in the right direction spell
 progress for which we in the Pacific North-
 west and Alaska are most thankful.
 The tuna industry goes on to say that pas-
 sage of such legislation will:
 A. Create problems of jurisdiction as be-
 tween the several states and between the
 states and the Federal Government.
 Answer: We do not believe this legislation
 will create problems of jurisdiction between
 the several states individually or between the
 states and the federal government.  The
 pending legislation provides United States
 jurisdiction with respect to the additional
 9-mile fishery zone when the bill states that
 "the jurisdiction of the United States ex-
 tends to all waters in the zone and the
 United States will exercise the  same ex-
 clusive rights in respect to fisheries in the
 zone as it has in its territorial sea, subject
 to the continuation of traditional fishing by
 foreign states within this zone as may be
 recognized by the United States".
 To a layman, the language quoted seems
 conclusive and should eliminate problems
 of jurisdiction between the states and the
 Federal Government.
 B. Create problems between the Ua_iited
 States and other friendly nations, e.g. Can-
 ada, Japan, and Mexico.
 Answer: Canada has already declared a
 12-mile limit for fishery purposes.  At the
 present time, the Canadians are recognizing
 historical  fishing  rights  of United States
 citizens.   In our opinion, our position of
 bargaining with Canada in the future would
 be greatly improved  with the adoption of
 a 12-mile limit.
 Japan, of course, can be depended upon
 to oppose any extension of fishery limits.
 It would not be in the national interests of
 Japan to agree to legislation of this kind,
 but Japan has to face 12-mile limits on the
 coasts of other countries, and there is no
 reason to believe that the adoption of this
 legislation will create more problems with
 Japan than those we already have.  Japan
 is one of the countries which makes it nec-
 essary for the United States to adopt an
 extension of the present fishery limit and to
 establish fishery conservation zones. The
 steady fishing pressure exerted by both Japan
 and Russia on the Pacific Coast stocks will
 call for more protection in the future, not
 less.
 In relation to Mexico, wedlave a number of
 problems at the present 'time which have
 been with us for a good many years.  It
 seems to us that in view of the almost gen-
 eral  adoption of a 12-mile limit by the
 majority of the coastal nations of the world,
 sooner or later this problem will have to be
 worked out with Mexico.  We have been able
 to work with Canada, our neighbor to the
 north, and it is our belief we will equally be
 able to work out existing problems with
 Mexico.
 C. Trigger exaggerated and excessive re-
 taliatory claims and actions by other na-
 tions, especially the Latin American nations
 off whose shores our shrimp and tuna fisher-
 men operate on the high seas.
 Answer: We do not follow nor can we un-
 derstand why the adoption of a 12-mile limit
 by the United States should trigger exag-
 gerated, excessive and retaliatory claims and
 actions by South American countries. There
 is nothing in this legislation which will in
 any way be injurious to any of these coun-
 tries which do not fish off the coasts of the
 United States.  Consequently, we reject al-
 leged contentions of ret; liatory actions by
 South American countries as unfounded.
 D. Create problems concerning the admin-
 stration of the Nicholson Act (46 U.S.C. 251),
 and the Fishermen's Protective Act, PL 680,
 83rd Congress.
 Answer: During the Senate hearings on
 S. 2218, there was considerable discussion in
 regard to the tuna industry's position that
 passage of the 12-mile limit bill would create
 problems as far as the Nicholson Act is
 concerned.  Problems arise because of differ-
 ences in interpretations as to the meaning
 and intent of specific law.  It is our under-
 standing that the contiguous fishery zone

 and-at least by implication--scolding the
 Johnson administration for not forcing the
 rates down.   Mr. Truman broke a self-
 imposed rule of silence to warn that high
 Interest could lead to a depression.
 Worry over the trend in interest rates is
 by no means confined to Democrats and ex-
 Presidents.  Anyone who has had to borrow
 to buy a house or a car or to keep his busi-
 ness going knows all too well what a pinch
 has overtaken the money market in recent
 months.  But unanimous concern has failed
 to produce a consensus as to what to do
 about it,
 Mr. Truman says the "drastic increase in
 interest rates has been imposed on the
 American economy," as though the rise were
 some dark plot hatched by the bankers.
 AFL-CIO President George Meany and other
 "easy money" advocates seem to think that
 if only the rates were knocked down by edict
 the problem would disappear.
 This is a little like saying that if you just
 powder over the spots, the patient will no
 longer have measles.
 The basic fact here is that money reacts
 to the law of supply and demand just as
 products and commodities do,  Demand is
 strong because the economy is straining un-
 der the forced draft of the war in Viet Nam
 plus the burgeoning needs of the Great So-
 ciety.,  The  supply  of  money                       is  limited.
 Competition to borrow what  is available
 naturally forces up the price.
 Arbitrary curbs on interest rates could
 scarcely succeed without a lid on prices and
 wages across the board. And in that direc-
 tion lies a totalitarian control of the econ-
 omy with all the evils that go with it.  We
 cannot believe that even the loudest propo-
 nents of easy money want that.
 ' Yet the alternative to this meddlesome
 route is to drive interest rates down by ex-
 pansion of the money supply.  And this is
 'inflation, pure and simple, for money thus
 pumped into the supply line quickly dilutes
 the value of money.
 What the high interest rates are primarily
 telling us is that the economy is getting out
 of balance-and the stook market has al-
 ready got the message.  High interest has a
 braking effect on the inflationary trend, and
 if it were operating in tandem with sound
 fiscal policy the effect could be beneficial
 rather than otherwise.
 Unfortunately, monetary policy is apply-
 ing a brake while the government's fiscal
 policy of overspending and deficit financing
 still pushes the accelerator to the floorboard.
 No wonder fears are rising that the machine
 may be going into a skid.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, September 6, 1966
 Mr. CALLAN.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to extend my personal applause at
 this to the International Association of
 Lions Clubs, the world's largest. service
 -club organization.
 For some time, I have observed with
 sincere thankfulness the work of Lion's,
 International in the field of visual im-
 pairment. Numerous programs, actively
 supported by the more than 20,000 Lions
 ,clubs in the world, have been undertaken

 A4673
 which of the fifty states he is from, considers
 Chairman RIVERS his Congressman.
 We recently received a letter from one of
 our Shipmates in  Vietnam  stating,  "if  a
 presidential nomination and election were
 held now,  with only the  military  voting,
 Chairman   L.   MENDEL    RIVERS   would be
 elected hands down."
 The shipmate was expressing the feelings
 of thousands and thousands of servicemen,
 active duty or retired.   Chairman RIVERS
 has earned this loyalty not only because
 he knows and cares about the problems of
 service personnel but because he is doing
 something to resolve those problems.
 When he assumed the       Chairmanship  of
 this key Congressional Committee eighteen
 months ago, everyone was aware that he had
 a big pair of boots to fill. For he succeeded
 Representative Carl Vinson and "Uncle Carl"
 had an unprecedented fifty years of accom-
 plishments behind him.
 Chairman RIVERS is handling his new du-
 ties in a  seamanlike  manner.   He under-
 stands the principles of team work and the
 delegation of responsibility. His thirty-seven
 man  Committee  is  the more active  and
 stronger because of this. Party affiliations
 are erased by the need to provide for the
 nation's security.
 He knows his colleagues in the House and
 Senate well. His leadership is making pos-
 sible realistic legislation.                                                                                                                                       Witness the pro-
 gressive military legislation enacted during
 the past eighteen months.
 His differences with his opponents within
 the  Administration  are  honest  differences
 that stem from his belief that the Congress
 is an equal partner on our national defense
 team.   He  knows   that  the    Constitution
 grants certain powers and responsibilities to
 each branch of Government. He intends for
 his Committee to exercise the powers granted
 to it.
 It is in pursuit of this belief that he has
 initiated firm, progressive action in military
 personnel matters.  His accomplishments of
 the past herald an even brighter future for
 our nation's fighting men.  He fully recog-
 nizes the needs of the man behind the gun
 and intends to provide for those needs.
 That is why L. MENDEL RIVERS is the Serv-
 and to promote eye care among all
 peoples.
 The several civic programs carried out
 by Lions International are all tailored
 to the organization's deep involvement
 in humanitarian activities and the foster-
 ing of better understanding among the
 people of the free world.
 In this the 50th year of organization
 for Lions International it is befitting the
 past performances of the 800,000 mem-
 bers of Lions International that a new
 and exciting undertaking is being initi-
 ated.  That undertaking is a worldwide
 essay contest on the. subject "Peace Is
 Attainable."  Launching of this great
 new project is in keeping with the theme
 "Search for Peace."
 Promotion of the search for ideas de-
 signed to make world peace a reality is
 the worthiest and most commendable of
 goals.  Judging from the past successes
 of Lions International, I believe all the
 .peoples in this Nation and in this world
 can take heart from this new effort.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

 Mr. TENZER.                                                          Mr. Speaker, the war
 in Vietnam has taken on an increasingly
 dangerous turn.                                                                           Our  engagement  in
 South Vietnam is the most important
 and troublesome problem facing the Na-
 tion today.  The people in my district are
 concerned and vexed by its complexi-
 ties and its tragedies. 'I, therefore, deem
 it  incumbent upon me to once again
 speak out to my distinguished colleagues
 on this issue.
 I firmly support the traditional Amer-
 ican spirit of free and open debate, hope-
 fully, we may gain enlightenment from
 these talks.  Our voices, however, need
 not always be raised in dissent-mere-
 ly for the sake of dissent-but rather in
 the spirit of constructive purposeful pro-
 posal.
 I have supported and will continue to
 support our basic commitment to the
 Affairs,  the  magazine  of  the  Fleet
 Reserve Association.
 As one who proudly boasts of being an
 honorary  member     of  New    Orleans
 Branch 92 of the FRA, I am pleased to
 call this editorial to the attention of the
 House.
 The force and clarity of this editorial
 is not surprising in view of the initials
 with which it is signed-R. W. N. Those
 initials signify Robert W. Nolan, who, in
 his brief period as national executive sec-
 retar~y of the FRA, has become widely
 known, respected, and trusted on Capitol
 Hill as a spokesman for the enlisted man.
 He is a tireless worker for the 65,000 FRA
 members and is singularly qualified to
 pick the "Serviceman's Congressman."
 The editorial follows:
 THE SERVICEMAN'S CONGRESSMAN
 Ask the average American of voting age
 who is his United States Representative and
 chances are he will be unable to tell you.

 people of South Vietnam-our determi-
 nation.to allow these people to lead lives
 of dignity and freedom, with the right to
 choose their own form of government,
 free from aggression from without.
 I have also supported all legislation to
 uphold the hands of our fighting men in
 South Vietnam.  But I am at the same
 time deeply distressed, by what appears
 to be a continued prolongation and in-
 tensification of the war. We seem to be
 indeterminately sinking  deeper  and
 deeper into the perilous quagmire of an
 extended land war on the continent of
 Asia.
 That is why, in March of 1965, I was
 among the first, if not the first, Member
 of Congress to conduct an open forum
 on Vietnam.  More than 300 concerned
 citizens came to hear a State Depart-
 ment spokesman explain the basis for
 the U.S. commitment in South Vietnam.
 My constituents in turn expressed their
 views freely and all who were privileged
 to be present profited by the experience.
 Shortly after the public forum, I was
 one of the first Members of Congress to
 propose a pause in the bombing as evi-
 dence of our desire for peace.
 In the month of December 1965, I was
 among the first to urge the President to
 accept the Christmas truce and because
 the lines of communication were thus
 opened to extend the truce and the
 bombing.  I was disappointed that the
 38-day pause did not result in a recipro-
 cal deescalation of the conflict.
 In January 1965, I joined with 78 col-
 leagues urging the President to continue
 his policy of measured restraint and not
 to consider our vote in favor of the de-
 fense appropriation bill as- an indication
 that we favor an escalation of the con-
 flict.
 In July 1966, I was one of 47 Members
 of the House who criticized Premier Ky's
 irresponsible proposal for escalation of
 the war.
 In August 1966, I was one of 22 Repre-
 sentatives in Congress who spoke out in
 favor of an Asian conference.
 In August 1966, I joined with 177 of
 my colleagues in urging U Thant to con-
 tinue as Secretary General of the United
 Nations.
 Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that all
 of these actions were consistent and in
 harmony with our President's policy of
 measured restraint and his earnest de-
 sires for peace.  I have never been able
 to understand Hanoi's refusal to nego-
 tiate.  .
 I feel, therefore, that it is now even
 more urgent for us to increase our efforts
 to bring about a reciprocal deescalation
 of military activities in Vietnam and a
 cease-fire, and to approach the termina-
 tion of our own military involvement.
 To accomplish this noble purpose I
 have sent the following letter to our
 President outlining my proposals for
 convening a Vietnam peace conference:
 CONGRESS OF THE, UNITED STATES,
 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
 Washington, D.C., August 1966.
 President LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
 The White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 'DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: The conflict in Viet-
 nam is the number one problem troubling
 most of my constituents.  The increasingly
 dangerous course which the conflict Is tak-
 ing is of grave concern to all of us.  Recent
 developments make it even more urgent,
 that we intensify our efforts to search for
 peace through diplomatic channels and by
 political means.
 I recognize that our foreign policy is based
 on the principle that we encourage the dle-
 velopment of a community of nations exer-
 cising the freedom to choose their own form
 of government.  That is why our basic com-
 mitment to South Vietnam is morally cor-
 rect. At the same time, a great Nation must
 have an equally great commitment to peace,
 and it is to this I wish to address myself.
 I have told my constituents that you want
 peace as much as I do, and as much as they
 do.   I have told them that you have the
 greater responsibility in making the day-to-
 day and hour-to-hour decisions.
 I have told them of your efforts to search
 out peace and of your numerous proposals
 for peace.  I related how you searched with-
 out                                                                          success  for  signs  of  reciprocal  de-
 escalation                                                                                during  the   two pauses   in  the
 bombing.
 Our Nation is the greatest and the strong-
 est                                                                    in  the      world  and  with  that    greater
 strength goes greater responsibility.   There-
 fore, in exercising and carrying out that re-
 sponsibility I suggest that we show to the
 nations of the world, and to our troubled
 citizens at home, that we can match our
 greater strength with even greater humil-
 ity-because our common objective is world
 peace.
 Mr  President, you have ofttimes stated
 that it is the policy of the United States to
 seek a settlement of the conflict by peaceful
 means; that we do not seek either territory
 or permanent bases in South Vietnam; that
 we are ready to meet any place, any time and
 that we welcome "negotiations without pre-
 conditions."
 Mr. President, I suggest that you initiate
 a courageous and dramatic step to move the
 Vietnam war from the battlefield to the con-
 ference table.  I make the following pro-
 posals, which, hopefully and prayerfully may
 bring about an end to hostilities and the be-
 ginning of negotiations for peace.
 Announce to the world that you have:
 1. Set the date, fixed the time, and ap-
 poined the place for a peace conference on
 Vietnam.   (Consider Asia or Geneva);
 2. Sent    invitations  to  North  Vietnam,
 South  Vietnam, the     National Liberation
 Front and. other interested parties to par-
 ticipate;
 3. Agreed that twenty four (24) hours be-
 fore the conference, as further evidence of
 our peaceful intentions, the United States
 will cease aerial bombings in North Vietnam,
 pending the  appearance  of Hanoi  at the
 Peace table;
 4. Agreed  that  seventy-two  (72) hours,
 after the conference starts, there shall he a
 reciprocal cease-fire coupled with a cessation
 of all movement of troops and materiel while
 negotiations are being carried on in good
 faith.  Provision for removal of the sick and
 wounded and movement of food, clothing and
 medical supplies, under appropriate inspec-
 tion and supervision shall be made;
 5. Agreed that. if items 3 and 4 above have
 been complied with-then 48 hours after the
 cease fire, the Secretary of State will be pres-
 ent at the negotiations to meet with his
 counter parts of the other nations invited to
 the conference;
 6. Agreed that the agenda to be mutually
 agreed upon may include the 14 points of the
 United States, the 4 points of the Hanoi gov-
 ernment, the Geneva agreements of 1954 and
 1962, and such other items which the parties
 may by mutual agreement add;
 7. Extended an invitation to the co-chair-
 man of the Geneva Conference, (the Soviet
 Union, and Great Britain), to the members of
 the International Control Commission (India,
 Canada and Poland) and to the Secretary
 General of the United Nations to take part in
 the conference.
 Mr. President, by making these proposals
 you will have announced to the world and
 to our concerned citizens that the United
 States not only has the sincere desire, but
 also the determination to pursue peace, and
 that our government wants to see all killing
 and destruction stopped.  By these proposals
 you will have seized initiative and given to
 the world the full measure of the continuing
 efforts  of the United States to achieve a
 peaceful settlement.
 Mr. President, you now have an excellent
 opportunity  for  creative  diplomacy   and
 dynamic statesmanship.  Let us hope and
 pray that North Vietnam and the National
 Liberation Front  will  recognize our  good
 intentions and come to the peace table.  If
 they do, both sides will have gained much.
 Should they fail to appear, let the eyes of the
 world behold the empty chairs and let the
 ears of the world hear the thunder of the
 silence from those invited-but unrepre-
 sented at the peace table.
 Lead us, Mr. President, in once again tak-
 ing the first steps on the path of de-escala-
 tion and on the path towards peace.  The
 world will recognize that you heeded the
 words of the Prophet Zechariah, 9: 10, who
 said: "And he shall speak peace unto the
 nations".
 This act of courage and magnanimity will
 be applauded by the entire world and our
 citizens at home.
 Respectfully,
 HERBERT TENZER,
 Member of Congress.
 Mr. Speaker, I respectfully urge my
 colleagues to express their views on my
 peace conference proposal.
 Commendation to Minnesota Future
 Farmer of America
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ALBERT H. QUIE
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, August 24, 1966
 Mr. QUIE. Mr. Speaker, the Minne-
 sota Future Farmers of America orga-

 most active in the Nation. I would like
 to commend the young men taking part
 in the many programs as well as Mr.
 W. J. Kortsemaki, Minnesota Future
 Farmers of America executive secretary.
 The Minnesota. FFA has begun an ex-
 citing statewide wildlife habitat pro-
 gram which has received support from
 sportsmen's club; the Minnesota State
 Conservation Department, and the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture's Soil Con-
 servation Service.
 FFA members are to be congratulated
 for  taking  part  in  many  programs:
 First, Operation Coverup in which the
 FFA helped to screen 15 to 20 dump-
 grounds and junkyards by tree plant-
 ings.  Second,                                                                                                                                   keep  Minnesota clean
 and scenic.    Third, trash-burner pro-
 gram in which members construct rub-
 bish burners in their farm shops and
 make them available to local communi-
 ties.  Fourth, raising ducks and pheas-
 ants as well as distribution of the birds.
 Fifth, cooperating with the Farmers
 Union in their Green Thumb and debris
