 PART II/F
 BULGARIA - 1956-1958
 The Year 1956
 1.     Thanks to exceptionally favorable crop weather
 in 1955, Bulgaria, like Rumania, entered the year 1956 in bet-
 ter economic shape than in any year since the beginning of World
 War II.   The availability of food reserves apparently encouraged
 the government to intensify the drive, begun in 1955, to hasten
 the collectivization of agriculture which had stagnated since 1951,
 By the end of February1956, about twice as many peasants were
 reported to have joined collective farms as had joined in the en-
 tire preceding year.  This success was presumably owing> partly
 to the economic advantages offered new collective farm members
 - among them, by a decree promulgated in October 1955, the can-
 cellation of certain debts - and partly to pressure.  The methods
 used must have been subtle, for much less was heard about them
 than during the earlier drive, but they must, nevertheless, have
 been effective, for the inducements offered could hardly alone
 explain such a sudden change in peasant psychology.
 2.     The fact that the Bulgarian budget for 1956 allo-
 cated almost as much to agriculture as to heavy industry - 21.4
 percent and 23. 5 percent respectively - and that under an agree-
 ment signed on 3 February 1956, Bulgaria obtained from the
 USSR a $92. 5 million credit for agricultural machinery, and
 fertilizer plants, appeared to confirm the opinion voiced in the
 Economist of 25 February 1956, that Bulgaria was slated for
 the role of "model of socialized agriculture" in the Balkans.
 Full collectivization was to be achieved within three years.
 Whether by coincidence with the Soviet credit or not, the govern-
 ment on 5 February announced reductions in the prices of a large
 number of foods and textiles.

 3.    In view of later developments, it is interest-
 ing to note that the Soviet credit to Bulgaria was granted one
 day after the announcement of a grant to Yugoslavia bringing
 the total which the latter country received within a month to
 over $200 million, and that relations between the two neigh-
 bors were once again strained.  On 29 January 1956, Cher-
 ve.nkov, the Bulgarian party boss, in a press interview had
 defended the Cominform, and denied that it was an obstacle to
 the improvement of Bulgarian- Yugoslav relations.  This state-
 ment, the Yugoslav newspaper Privredni Pregl.ed- 1 retorted,
 "could not stand up to criticism or analysis, " and Cherven-
 kov's views were again attacked by Radio Belgrade on 15 Feb.,
 ruary.
 4.     The improvement in the situation on the eco-
 nomic front was not matched on the political.  Without explana-
 tion for the delay, Radio Sofia on 2 February broadcast the text
 of a speech made by Chervenkov to a meeting of the Writers'
 Union on 28 December 1955, in which he said that the session
 had been marked "by concentrated fire opened by some mem-
 bers against the present management" which was tantamount
 to attacking the Central Committee itself.  He specifically
 scored the writer Gocho Gochev who had written in Issue No.
 37 of Literaturen Fronten that industrialization in Bulgaria
 was being carried out at the expense of the people and that
 "the people were grumbling against the policy of the Party.
 5.     Chervenkov was,. with Enver Hoxha of Albania,
 the only satellite boss who had the courage - or the foresight -
 to ignore the XX Party Congress and Khrushchev's denunciation
 of Stalin.  He made no public report on the proceedings he had
 attended, nor did any Party organ even mention the name of
 Stalin.  Rabotnichesko Delo, in a 17 March editorial, merely

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 scored the "cult of personality" aberration, which was also
 evident in the Bulgarian Communist Party but would have to be
 totally eliminated.  In the meantime Stalin's pictures in Sofia
 were as much in evidence as before, and the scheduled visit of
 a Yugoslav parliamentary delegation was postponed without ex-
 planation.
 6.     On April 6, however, the Bulgarian Central
 Committee adopted a resolution censuring the Party boss for
 having fostered a cult of personality centering on himself, to
 the injury of the Party and state, and replaced him in the premi-
 ership with Anton Yugov, the second ranking Bulgarian Commu-
 nist.
 7.     Chervenkov's demotion was naturally widely
 considered to be only the first of a series in Eastern Europe.
 But as time passed and the other holdovers from the Stalin era
 retained their jobs, it became obvious that neither extreme
 ruthlessness nor an earlier anti-Tito attitude was sufficient to
 make a satellite boss persona non grata in Moscow.  What mat-
 tered was close adherence to the sinuosities of the Party line.
 In the majority of cases, verbal and purely token conformity
 proved satisfactory, but in the case of Chervenkov, Khrush-
 chev's policy of reconciliation with Tito also demanded con-
 crete action which Cherve.nkov. r.efused:to: take.  This conclusion
 seems to be justified by the facts that it was not until after the
 demotion of Chervenkov that the intention to rehabilitate Trai-
 cho Kostov, executed in 1949 for Titoism, was announced, and
 that the planned visit to Sofia of the Yugoslav delegation actually
 took place.
 8.     Whatever the charges against Chervenkov, they
 were obviously not grave enough to compromise him irremedia-
 bly, for he retained his membership in the Politburo and was
 appointed to one of the deputy premier ships.  His Communist
 colleagues apparently did not see any incongruity between Cher-

 venkov's membership in the government and the Party leader-
 ship and a flow of speeches and newspaper articles in which
 they belabored him for "brutal administration and ordering
 about, " for "violations of socialist legality, " and for "one-man
 leadership at all levels. "1  These attacks were obviously only
 intended to provide an alibi in case of changes in Moscow, for
 nothing was done to reform the system.  Neither was anything
 done to punish those guilty of the judicial murder of Kostov,
 unless it be that the implied branding of Chervenkov as the
 man responsible was considered sufficient atonement - by the
 Party, at any rate.  It was considered far from sufficient by
 the population at large, which nursed the illusion of a far-
 reaching change in methods as well as men.  This disappoint-
 ment was shared by the Yugoslavs, who gave it outward expre s
 sion by refusing to grant visas to two members of a Bulgarian
 delegation which was to have returned the Yugoslav visit in May,
 an affront which led, as was to be expected, to the cancellation
 of the return visit.
 9.    By the middle of May, the Bulgarian Party
 leaders were in a position to read Moscow's mind more accur-
 ately and realized that they were not really expected to let
 liberalism go very fair.  On 20 May, the Party organ Rabotni-
 chesko Delo severely rebuked those guilty of "harmful criti-
 cism, " among others the Fatherland Front organ Otechestven
 Front, one of the regime's sharpest critics.  The effect was,
 however, not immediate, and Rabotnichesko Selo was obliged
 to repeat its warnings in a series of editorials on 9, 10 and 11
 June, and at the same: time to reveal the extent of popular feel-
 ing against Stalinist methods.  Among those branded as guilty
 of harmful criticism figured members of the Sofia Party organ-
 ization who had "wrong political opinions, " writers and artists,
 who demanded an end to ideological control, . and the general
 public, which questioned the regime's economic policy.

 10.   The regime's defense followed the standard
 pattern of admitting certain shortcomings, while denying they
 were as serious as represented, and of claiming that steps to
 correct the mistakes had already been taken.  Rabotnichesko
 Delo, in its 11 June editorial, admitted that there was "tempor.-
 ary" urban unemployment, that the pay of workers in some
 important industries such as textiles, food, and tobacco, was
 well below average, that large families were hard up and pen-
 sions too low, but it asserted that real income had been steadi-
 ly rising' and promised further price reductions.
 11.   These optimistic expectations were presum-
 ably based on the fact, announced by Premier Yugov in his
 maiden speech, that industrialization in Bulgaria would in
 future be carried out in line with plans for intra-bloc coordin-
 ation, "on the basis of available raw materials. "  Yugov at
 the same time painted a rosy picture of agricultural prospects
 which had greatly improved as a result of the recent Soviet
 credit.  Between January and April, he said, 282, 000 peasant
 families had joined cooperative farms, so that now 77 percent
 of the peasants were members as against 55 percent at the be-
 ginning of the year.  But Yugov certainly exaggerated the ef-
 fect of the Soviet credits, for Party Secretary Dimitur Ganev,
 in a speech on Lenin's anniversary, admitted that there had
 been cases "where the principle of voluntariness had been
 violated. "
 12.   The Rabotnichesko Delo editorials of 9,  10,
 and 11 June 1956 - and perhaps other unpublicized arguments
 .-. were extraordinarily successful in convincing dissatisfied
 elements of the population of their errors.  On 20 June -
 presumably after the removal of chief editor Topencherov, a
 1
 Rabotnichesko Delo of 30 April had published figures purport-
 ing to show that average annual income had increased by 13. 5
 percent since 1952.

 brother-in-law of Kostov - Otechestven Front published a
 full recantation of its "wrong and harmful" criticisms, and on
 19 July, Literaturen Front, the organ of the Writers' Union,
 revealed that the Union had, in its 12 July meeting, squelched
 the -writers' revolt.  The literary policy laid down by Cherven-
 kov in December 1955 was to remain in force.  In the local
 Party election conferences in July, the rebellious spirit mani-
 fest in similar meetings in April was absent.  Indeed, outward-
 ly at least, the malcontents had been so successfully cowed
 that Rabotnichesko Delo found no occasion to revert to the sib-
 ject of inadmissible criticism.  With the renaming of institu-
 tions named after Chervenkov, and the reversion of Stalingrad
 to its old name of Varna, the leadership appeared to consider
 the matter of de-Stalinization closed.
 13.     After the Poznan riots, the Party leadership
 deemed it prudent to take steps to reduce some of the underly-
 ing causes of discontent.  Rabotnichesko Delo of 7 July admon-
 ished local Party leaders to "strengthen their ties with the
 working people and respond to their needs in time, " for many
 of them displayed "a soulless attitude toward the people."
 Industrial ministries and people's councils were ordered to
 hire many of the unemployed, 1 prices in factory canteens
 were reduced.  By decree of 11 July, obligatory deliveries
 of products of private plots, except wool, were abolished,
 while the prices of obligatory deliveries of most products of
 collective farms, and of some state purchases, were increased
 by about 20 percent.
 14. The decree also declared that full voluntary
 collectivization was feasible within two or three years.  Todor
 Zhivkov, the First Party Secretary, in his report on the decree
 Rabotnichesko Delo, 25 July 1956.

 to the National Assembly, added the information that kulaks
 could in future be granted membership in collective farms,
 if they had the "right" mentality.
 15.     But the latent unrest, even within the Party,
 was apparently not allayed.  On 19 September, the Central
 Committee issued "decisions, " in which it admitted.that
 alien, casual, and careerist elements have penetrat-
 ed the ruling.-Party . . . they yield to hostile influ-
 ence easily and become the propagators of alien,
 bourgeois, and petit--bourgeois concepts.  The weak
 ideological and political training of a section of the
 Party membership is another important reason for
 the political instability of some Party members.
 But, the Committee concluded, "there can be no place for
 liberalism and conciliation . . . ".
 16.     Apparently as a result of prodding by Moscow,
 the Party Central Committee further announced that the charges
 of Titoism against the defendants in the 1949- 1950 trials had
 been found groundless, that the role of Parliament would be
 enhanced, and that control over the police by the courts, and
 the powers of people's councVls would be increased.  But these
 concessions to liberalism were balanced by a stern warning to
 "bourgeois elements" to refrain from "machinations and slan-
 ders. "
 17.     Three days after the announcement of these
 alleged proofs of Bulgarian anti-Stalinism, the Parliamentary
 delegation which was to have visited Yugoslavia in May, ar-
 rived in Belgrade, minus the two delegates to whom the Yugo-
 slavs had objected.  But the visit did little to effect a genuine
 improvement in Bulgarian- Yugoslav relations, the Yugoslavs
 apparently not being convinced of the sincerity of Bulgarian

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 anti-Stalinism as long as Chervenkov continued to wield
 influence in Sofia.  The result was a vicious circle:  the
 more antipathy the Yugoslavs showed to Chervenkov, the
 greater his popularity and influence among Bulgarians, and
 vice versa.
 18.     On 9 October, the semi-official Yugopress
 stated openly that there were basic disagreements between
 the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Communist parties on "essential
 questions of social theory and practice, " which the ambiguous
 joint communique of 7 October had not mentioned.  On 18
 October, Yugqpress even expressed open dissatisfaction
 with Bulgarian de-Stalinization and complained particularly
 about the lack of information concerning the fate of surviving
 Titoists.  Unfortunately, in Bulgaria, Yugoslav encourage-
 ment of Polish and Hungarian revisionism during these criti-
 cal months of 1956 was, if anything, the kiss of death.  Never-
 theless, there can hardly be much doubt about the feelings of
 the majority of Bulgarians at that time, especially since the
 Polish and Hungarian developments coincided with a bread
 shortage, part of the blame for which was naturally put on
 to the excessive speed of collectivization.  The authorities
 themselves betrayed their fear of a revolt by sharply in-
 creasing security precautions and by announcing on 31 Octo-
 ber that restrictions on the buying of flour would be lifted
 on 10 November, thank to "generous" Soviet wheat ship-
 ments.  The Bulgarians thus became the first of the satel
 lites to be helped out by grain deliveries in 1956. .It also
 happened to be the first time since World War I that Bulgaria
 imported wheat instead of exporting it.  There were numerous
 - albeit unconfirmed. - reports that Soviet generosity went
 even further, and that assistance to Bulgaria had included
 Soviet troops, landed in the last ten days of October.  The
 authorities can have had no objection to the spreading of
 these rumors -= or even to launching them.

 19.     Nevertheless, the regime felt far from re-
 assured.                                   In November and December, a number of unrelia-
 ble persons, particularly students, were arrested, and mas-
 sive expulsions of Sofia inhabitants were effected.  Some
 30, 000 people are believed to have been forced to leave the
 capital for the provinces, with only a few hours' notice at
 dead of night, and allowed only to take with them as much
 as they could carry.  Opinions differ as to the reasons for
 this typically Stalinist measure, some observers holding
 that they were primarily economic, that is to relieve. the
 over-crowding of the capital, to reduce unemployment, and
 so forth, but while these considerations may have carried
 weight, the timing alone points to preponderantly political
 reasons, i. e., punishment and fear.
 20.     At the same time, the regime, following the
 standard Bloc practice in such cases, proceeded to alleviate
 the most crying economic hardships hoping to placate at least
 one large section of the malcontents.  On 27 November, the
 government announced that cooperative farmers would be en-
 titled to pensions, allowances for children tripled, wages for
 low paid workers increased and a number of compulsory agri-
 cultural deliveries abolished.  - i or May 1957, an industry-
 wide wage increase was promised.
 21.     The economic plan for 1957, approved by the
 National Assembly on 30 December 1956, confirmed that most
 of the funds for these improvements were to be obtained by
 the simple expedient of reducing investments by 34 percent
 below the 1956 plan.  Further resources were presumably to
 be made available by a 30 percent reduction in the State ad-
 ministrative personnel, decided upon by the Central Com-
 mittee Plenum of 17 January 1957.

 The Year 1957
 22.     Although no disinterested observer could
 discern any signs that the Bulgarians, oblivious of the Buda-
 pest tragedy, were contemplating an uprising against the
 regime and its Soviet protectors, the Party leaders gave
 every indication of continuing nervousness, manifesting
 itself by appeals for vigilance against the internal enemy,
 purges among students and a rather unexpected propaganda
 campaign for deepening Russian-Bulgarian friendship.
 Zhivkov, on 19 January, countermanded the decision taken
 in February 1956 to merge the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship
 societies with the Fatherland Front and also urged that Bul-
 garian-Soviet Friendship month should be observed anew,
 after a three-year lapse.  Zhivkov presumably felt that al-
 though fear, rather than love, of the Russians was what he
 should, but could not, stress if he wanted to curb rebel-
 liousness, the next best thing was to make sure the people
 were constantly reminded of their "close ties" with the
 USSR.  The rest could be safely left to their imaginations.
 . 23.     The curtailment of the Fatherland Front by
 no means signified a demotion of that organization.  On the
 contrary, the proceedings of its Fourth Congress which
 opened on 11 February revealed that the Party expected
 great things from that organization, nothing less than to
 succeed where the uncamouflaged Party had failed.
 It is necessary for the FF (said Radio Sofia) to
 consolidate and develop as the broadest national
 autonomous political organization, to represent
 a real unity between the working class, the peas-
 ants, and the intelligentsia, to educate the people
 in a patriotic spirit and be the broadest political
 mass support for the regime.  The FF must con-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 tinue to improve its educational, explanatory, and
 cultural work for the political education of the people
 in a patriotic and socialist spirit.
 24.     On the following day, (13 February 1957) the
 replacement of Chervenkov as chairman of the FF Executive
 Board by Demeter Ganev, a Central Committee Secretary,
 was announced.    The change did not mean a. further demotion
 of Chervenkov, for he was at the same time appointed Minis-
 ter of Culture and Education.  Any doubts on the subject were
 promptly dispelled when Chervenkov, although only a member
 of the Bulgarian delegation headed by Yugov and Zhivkov,
 which visited Moscow 15-21 February, was treated by the
 Russians as the actual leader.
 25.     The final communique reflected the full agree-
 ment of the two governments on the causes of the Hungarian
 I tcounte r revolution' I and the Soviet "military assistance, " on
 proletarian internationalism,  revisionism - the USSR was once
 again in_ conflict with Yugoslavia - and similar subjects.  The
 coma}unique also disclosed an economic agreement on trade,
 which emphasized Bulgaria's role as truck gardener and pur-
 veyor of non-ferrous metals for the Bloc, the USSR undertak-
 ing to cover Bulgaria's wheat and cotton needs.  Bulgaria ob-
 tained a 200-million ruble credit for needed plant construction,
 as well as contracts for building and repairing Soviet ships,
 and for the production of clothes and shoes from Soviet mater-
 ial, apparently intended to relieve serious Bulgarian unemploy-
 ment.  A secret agreement providing for the employment of
 15-20, 000 Bulgarian laborers on the virgin lands in Siberia
 also appears to have been signed at that time.
 26.     Presumably knowing their countrymen better
 than foreign observers who could see no, portent of a Bulgarian
 revolt, the Communist leadership not only continued but inten-
 sified their precautions against such an eventuality.  Policemen

 continued to be armed with machine guns instead of their
 regular pistols and public buildings were under armed guard.
 In March, April and May, there was a new wave of expulsions
 of "undesirables" ., estimated to number between 10 and 20, 000
 - from Sofia, the exact reasons for which remained as obscure
 as before.  This coincided with a further purge of "reactionary-
 oriented" students and of Party members, "large numbers" of
 whom had "blunted the militancy" of Party organizations by fail-
 ing to implement Party decisions.  (Rabotnichesko Delo, 21
 March).  Novo Vreme, the Party theoretical organ, explained
 in its March issue that the purge was needed among other things
 to sharpen "revolutionary vigilance, " the lack of which had
 lowered Party morale and discipline.  On 6 April Papazov, the
 first secretary of the Sofia organization, confirmed that the
 Sofia Party Committee had been "unable to ignore the incorrect
 expressions and activities, and doubts about the correctness of
 Party policies and the essentials of our unbreakable friendship
 with the Soviet Union, " and that after the Hungarian events,
 "the question of membership and the unity and militancy of the
 Party organization was once again placed before us. "
 27.     Papazov, however, made the mistake of de-
 manding that the cleansing of the Party ranks should be care
 ried out "intelligently, peacefully, and in an orderly manner,
 and that an improvement should be sought primarily by in-
 creased indoctrination.  Two days after his speech he was
 demoted to deputy first secretary, for having "failed to analyze
 facts correctly, " (Rabotnichesko Delo,  .3 April).
 28.     The April Congress of the National Agrarian
 Union was only remarkable for the further proof it gave of the
 Peasant Party's total subservience to the Communist Party,
 and the Trade Union Congress which followed, for its implied
 admission of worker disaffection.     Todor Prakhov, the Central
 Council chairman, according to Rabotnichesko Delo of 17 April,
 conceded the occurrence of. "brutal violations of the labor code, "

 failure to consult workers "on basic problems connected with
 their production interests, for example in problems dealing
 with urgent amendments in the norms and payment of labor, 11
 and other shortcomings., which should of course be corrected.
 In no case, however, by following the Yugoslav model, for
 Prakhov told his listeners that they must "struggle against
 attempts to undermine the role of the trade union in the pro-
 gram to draw workers into more active participation in the
 administration of economic enterprises. "
 29.     The unusually elaborate and gay decoration
 of the capital for the 1957 May Day celebration was attributed
 by foreign observers to the regime's desire to dispel the at-
 mosphere of gloom and terror produced by the nocturnal ex-
 pulsions of citizens.  If that was the purpose, the increase in
 the number of portraits of Stalin was a mistake, which may
 explain the apathy of the large crowds watching the parade,
 noted by foreign observers.
 30.     If Narodna Mladezh, the organ of the Dimitrov
 Youth Union, is to be believed, the regime soon .found a means
 to cheer up the Bulgarians.  On 6 June it announced that the
 recently launched campaign to sig4 up young men and women
 for three years of work in Russian mines, building projects
 and state farms, had "brought great joy, because it . . . is
 the incarnation of their long years of dreaming of their love
 for the Soviet Union. " Todor Zhikov told a New York Times
 correspondent on 21. September that 10, 000 Bulgarians had
 gone to work in the USSR, and 4, 000 more in Czechoslovakia.
 As he further stated that 81 percent of the able-bodied popula-
 tion were employed, it followed that 19 percent were unem-
 ployed. in a socialist country, where unemployment was not
 supposed to occur.
 31.     The Bulgarian Communist leaders were the
 next, after the Rumanians, to follow the Russian example
 and to get rid of troublesome Party members.  On 15 July

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 the expulsion of Georgi Chankov from the Politburo and the
 deputy premiership, and of Labor Minister Dobri Terpeshev
 and of Yonko Panov from the Central Committee by decision
 of the 11- 12 July Plenum, was announced.  The charge against
 all three of them was "fractionalism, 'r that is, apposition to
 the leaders, and against Chankov in particular, that he had
 attempted to build up his own following among "unhealthy ele-
 ments" in order to "attain the highest post in the Party. " How-
 ever, unlike the victims of the Moscow purge, the Bulgarian
 victims all belonged to the liberal wing of the party and were
 credited with "Titoist" sympathies.  Moreover, the men who
 replaced them in the Politburo and the Central Committee, as
 well as some additional new members, were all known Stalin-
 ists, even extreme Stalinists like Dimitur Ganev and Todor
 Pavlov, chairmen of the Academy of Sciences.  But in such
 matters "national" communism, i. e. a deviation from the
 Moscow pattern, was apparently practiced with the approval
 of Moscow, for Zhivkov and Yugov had been - incognito - in
 the Soviet capital in the beginning of July, and two days after
 the announcement of the Bulgarian purge, Zhivkov was back
 again in Moscow, this time as guest at a reception in honor of
 Albanian and Yugoslav leaders.
 32.     Chankov, Terpeshev, and Panov were of course
 not the only black sheep in the BCP.  Literaturen Fronten, the
 organ of the Bulgarian Writers' Union, in its 18 July 1957 issue,
 conceded that
 obviously, the existence of such centrifugal forces in
 the highest leadership of the Party had its repercus-
 sions and gave rise to unhealthy, non-Party manifesta-
 tions in some organizations and in some Party mem-
 bers.
 Members of the Writers' Union had of course not remained im-
 mune to the disease which must have been very contagious, for
 the article claimed no more than the existence within the union
 of a "healthy nucleus. "

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 It must be said (the article went on) that a great num-
 ber of those who showed unhealthy tendencies have
 influenced by proper criticis-m--
 J lived down their sub-
 jective errors or are now in the process of doing so.
 The Hungarian events helped them to see what harm
 their wrong behavior can cause to the unity of Com-
 munist writers.  Some others, however, continue to
 be the bearers of sickly, alien, and non-Party mani-
 festations, which they disseminate under the guise of
 combatting dogmatism
 It goes without saying that the 'article ended with an invitation
 to wage "a merciless and irreconcilable struggle against per-
 nicious petit bourgeois attitudes and dissatisfactions . . . "
 33.     In its fight against dissatisfaction the regime
 was providentially supplied with a strong argument by an excep-
 tionally bountiful harvest.  This justified the chance it had tak-
 en in May when it had decreed a general 10-18 percent wage
 increase, which for an undisclosed reason was only announced
 in August. As in the other satellites, the Bulgarian govern-
 ment, pursuant to a Central Committee decision of September
 1956, increased by a decree of 12 July 1957, the powers of
 people's councils over minor industries and over their own
 budgets, in an attempt to encourage local initiative and efficien-
 cy.  Further concessions to popular demands were made in Nov-
 ember; a law increasing pensions was passed and the Labor Code
 was amended to augment annual and mate;iaity leaves and over-
 time pay and to grant survivors' benefits and funeral expenses
 upon the death of a worker.
 34.     The opening at long last of a crossing point for
 motor vehicles on the Bulgarian-Yugoslav frontier, announced
 by Radio Sofia on 3 October, seemed to mark a definite im-
 provement in relations between the two countries as a result
 of the Tito-Khrushchev meeting in Bucharest in August.  But

 how superficial the reconciliation was, soon became manifest
 when the October issue, of Novo Vreme came out with a polem-
 ic article on the subject of divided Macedonia, accusing Yugo-
 slavia of coveting Bulgaria'.s share.  The Yugoslavs naturally
 retaliated by accusing the Bulgarians of similar designs on
 Yugoslav Macedonia.
 35.     Although, outwardly at any rate, perfect calm
 continued to reign in Bulgaria, the regime's uneasiness was
 betrayed by such symptoms as the creation of a "workers'
 militia" composed of the most reliable Party members, which
 paraded publicly for the first time on. 7 November, the anni-
 versary. of the Russian Revolution, and by a further attack on
 recalcitrant writers.  Literaturen Fronten of 17 October 1957
 complained of the "persistent silence" with which writers had
 met the opportunity to "discuss" the recent restrictive inter-
 pretation of the XX Congress decisions on literature.  But,
 the. periodical explained, their silence was only in print, for
 in private, they were loud in their denunciations of that develop-
 ment.  A month later, Zhivkov himself, addressing a joint elec-
 toral rally of the Party and the Fatherland Front, found it neces-
 sary to stress the need for the intelligentsia "to struggle even
 more actively against bourgeois and petit-bourgeois influences
 in its ranks. " As for the bourgeois themselves, he disclaimed
 any desire for the intensification of the class struggle and even
 asserted that he had nothing against their dreaming about their
 past glories and property, but, plagiarizing Cyrankiewicz after
 Poznan, he warned that if they dared to raise their hands against
 the regime, they would be cut off,
 36.     On the economic front, alluding to the division
 of labor among socialist countries, Zhivkov claimed that Bul-
 garia would only develop those branches of industry which were
 most suitable for her, but that priority would be granted to
 heavy industry as before.  "At the same time" he promised
 "light industry and food production will be developed to satisfy
 more completely the needs of the working people, " (Rabot-
 nichesko Delo, 26 November 1957).

 37.     The promise of a somewhat better life for the
 Bulgarian people was borne out by the figures given by Russi
 Khristozov, chairman of the State Planning Commission, to
 the National Assembly on 8 December.  The share of the na-
 tional income allotted to consumption in 1958 was to be in-
 creased over 1957 from 80 to 83 percent, and the share of
 industrial investments allotted to light and food industries
 was also to be substantially increased, while investments
 as a whole would still remain below 1956 levels.  Housing
 credits were to be increased by 20 percent over the 1957
 figure, and credits were to be made available to collective
 farms to facilitate the extension of truck gardening.
 38.     At the Fifth National Conference of Agricul-
 tural Cooperatives, 2-4 December 1957, Zhivkov announced
 that land collectivization was virtually achieved, 86. 5 per-
 cent of the arable land being now collectivized.  He himself,
 however, made the voluntariness of the operation seem very
 questionable by berating some of the collective farm manage-
 ments for allowing members to expand their private plots at
 the expense of the collective.  The complaint by Deputy Premi-
 er Georgi Traikov, that farmers were overdoing specializa-
 tion in truck gardening, even planting fertile flat fields to
 grapevines, seems also to betray a preference for the more
 individualistic forms of farming.   Traikov also severely
 criticized collective farms which did not honor their deliv-
 ery contracts with the state or sold most of their produce on
 the free market.  Zhivkov added the specific complaint: "We
 increased wool prices, we increased the number of sheep,
 and now we must buy wool from the capitalist market for the
 requirements of our industry! "
 39.     In spite of - or perhaps thanks to - these un-
 socialist practices, and certainly as a result of good weather,
 a marked improvement in living conditions had occurred in
 1957.    Food was now plentiful and a large variety of consumer

 goods - of- very poor quality it is true   were available in the
 shops.  Better still, the Party's good dispositions toward the
 people showed no signs of abating - far from it.  The ratio
 between expenditure in light and heavy industry which had
 been 18:85 in 1957, jumped to 27:73 in the budget for 1958.
 40.     Although the regimels solicitude for the mater-
 ial needs of the population no doubt reduced anti-regime senti-
 ment in the country somewhat, opposition to its policies was
 by no means extinct.  According to the New York Times (25
 January 1958), two villages on the outskirts of Sofia "were
 surrounded by squads of Party stalwarts and policemen armed
 with machine pistols" and the villagers were forced to join
 collective farms.  They were presumably included in the num-
 ber of peasants who, according to the Sofia newspapers and
 radio of January and February 1958, were "applying" to join
 collectives.
 41.     The campaign against "revisionist" Bulgarian
 writers which had been sharply intensified after the publica-
 tion in August 1957 of Khrushchev's literary directives
 achieved only limited success.  The official position was
 perhaps most clearly stated in Vecherni Noviny (29 October
 1957).     The paper denounced the "fallacious notion" of Emil
 Manov, author of the novel An Unauthentic Case, of Todor
 Genov, author of the play Fear, and of other writers, that
 it is sufficient for a writer to proceed from "either Socialist
 or sincere democratic positions. " A writer did not have to
 be a Communist, the paper stated, but "his position must co-
 incide with the Party position. " It was therefore obviously
 inadmissible to portray people's leaders as evil, as those
 writers had done.
 42.     The two lines of defense of the writers were,
 in the words of Manov, that "sometimes a man is more

 important than the institution, r'1 and in those of Panteley
 Zarev:  "Revisionism would not have occurred if the Lenin-
 ist norms of Party life had been observed. rr2
 43.     In an attempt to reestablish Party discipline,
 a meeting of the Writers' Union Party organization was held
 in Sofia from 29 November-1 December 1957, at which its
 Secretary, Andrei Gulyashki, listed the writers' shortcom-
 ings.  He named ten who had, "to put it mildly, an attitude
 of holding reservations about Sociallisin. "  This was partic-
 ularly disturbing, for their attitude found a sympathetic echo
 among the young.
 Some writersand critics (Gulyashki said) particu-
 larly of the younger generation, wave in an inspired
 manner the banner of petty bourgeois liberalism,
 and flirt with their 'courage' to cast doubt on the
 method of Socialist realism.
 Deplorable was also the passivity of orthodox Communist
 writers, and the complicity of editorial offices, which, Gul-
 yashki admitted, were overflowing with works arousing
 "misgivings about Socialism. " Among the more specific
 charges presented by Gulyashki were the approval by some
 writers of the "Polish-Hungarian experience, " and criticism
 of the Party by others for "following a wrong line on collec-
 tivization of farms. "
 44.     Perhaps the most important fact brought out
 by the Writers' Union meeting was the inability of the Party
 leadership so far to intimidate the rebellious writers.

 "There are Party members, " said Gulyashki, "who declare
 that they are not going to obey the majority's decisions,
 which are obligatory under the Party statute. " Three secre-
 taries of the Union were criticized at the meeting for their
 failure to take a stand against the offenders, and Literaturen
 Fronten, in its report on the proceedings (26 December 1957)
 complained that the culprits had not only refused to renounce
 their errors, but had defended their writings.  It is true,
 however, that the sanctions threatened by the official spokes-
 men were not very terrifying.  Gulyashki merely warned that
 the Party's patience was not limitless and that the leadership
 of the Union might be reshuffled.
 45.     It must be admitted that Gulyashki was in a
 rather embarrassing position, since he was also the chief
 editor of Plamuk, which had published many of the incrimin-
 ated works, including Manov's An Unauthentic Case.  How-
 ever, Gulyashki's rather mild speech to the Writers' Union
 Party organization meeting and an equally mild self-critical
 editorial in the December issue of the magazine were appar-
 ently considered sufficient for his rehabilitation, for he was
 one of the four editors retained on the board of the magazine.
 Besides the other six editors of Plamuk, other writers known
 to have been victims of the campaign were the editor-in.- chief
 of Otechestven Front and a member of his staff, Topencharov,
 who happened, however, to have been Traicho Kostov's btother-
 in-law and a violent critic of Chervenkov.
 46.     There were also some victims in the scientific
 world.    A report to the Party organization of Stalin district in
 Sofia charged members of the Academy of Sciences, the Insti-
 tute of Political Economy, and a number of agricultural col-
 leges with revisionism, and the entire board of the journal
 Filosofska Misl with complacency toward bourgeois ideology.
 The report approved the Party organization in the Academy
 of Sciences for "expelling pseudo-scientific workers and alien,
 hostile elements. "

 47.     One of the explanations for the Party's rela-
 tive forbearance in its conflict with the "revisionist" writers
 was given by Ivan Martinov who, according to Literaturen
 Fronten saw the real causes of ideological deviation "in the
 unsatisfactory situation of the Party organizations and in the
 frequent and, in most cases, unprincipled struggles, striv-
 ings, and personal squabbles. "   It is safe to assume that
 the "deviationists" owed their relative immunity, both to dis-
 unity in the Party ranks, among whom they undoubtedly had
 many friends, and to their numerical and qualitative import-
 48.     Another problem which the Bulgarian regime
 shared with other Communist governments was the spread of
 "hooliganism, " On 26 January 1958, it made a determined
 effort to control the situation by the arrests of two to three
 thousand suspects, mostly young workers of peasant origin,
 who had allegedly fallen victim to "rock and roll" and other
 bourgeois influences.  This was followed on 5 February by a
 law for the repression of hooliganism passed by the National
 Assembly.  Among its provisions was the establishment of a
 Juvenile Delinquency Commission to direct the campaign
 against hooliganism, and of "labor educational schools. " An
 attempt to curb the twin evil of drunkenness, a "remnant of
 capitalism" which refused to wither away despite its lack of
 justification under socialism, was made by a decree of 18
 February 1958, which introduced severe restrictions on the
 sale of liquor.  At the same time, the authorities inaugurated
 a policy of stricter enforcement of the laws against "economic
 crimes" against the people, which were multiplying at an
 alarming rate.   Nine executions and many more jail sentences
 were announced in the first quarter of 1958, as against four
 in the entire preceding year.

 49.     Political-ideological crimes were more dif-
 ficult to combat in the post-Stalin era, in spite of the grow-
 ing threat they seemed to represent.  "Individual, unhealthy
 and hesitant elements in the Party have started to develop
 petty bourgeois concepts of 'freedom' and 'democracy' at
 meetings, conferences, and in the press, " Novo Vreme
 complained,  (issue of February 1958).  Otechestven Front
 deplored the "shortcomings and omissions which have been
 noted of late in the ideological-political education of the young
 generation, " (13 March 1958), and Rabotnichesko Delo (ZZ
 March 1958) pilloried "the bourgeois ideology manifested
 among student youth. " But Otechestven Front could think of
 nothing more concrete with which to correct the evil than a
 joint "struggle" against bourgeois influences among the young
 by all institutions and organizations "directly or indirectly
 responsible for the education of the young generation, " (loc.
 cit.) .
 50.     The disappointing orientation of the younger
 generation of intellectuals was confirmed by Todor Zhivkov
 himself at the annual meeting of the Writers' Union (7-9 April
 1958).    He deplored the "decadent tendencies" of young writers:
 "We see young creators in our poetry, literature, cinemato-
 graphic and pictorial art, music and theater who have lost their
 way and thus become victims of harmful influences . .   "
 Obviously, then, the younger generation was proving "tougher"
 than the older one, for the atmosphere at.the April meeting of
 the Writers' Union was much more subdued than in the preced-
 ing November.  Some of the rebellious writers, among them
 Emil Manov, still maintained a dignified silence - and were
 not re-elected to the Presidium - some even delivered fresh
 attacks on dogmatism but others, including Todor Genov,
 apologized for their mistakes.  "Gentle persuasion" had ap-
 parently been successful.  It was soon to score an even more
 impressive victory when on 17 May Manov himself informed
 an interviewer from the Bulgarian News Agency that he had
 seen the light.

 51.     The atmosphere for deviationists had indeed
 become increasingly unhealthy during the weeks: which followed
 the revival of the anti-Yugoslav campaign.  In April, there
 were persistent rumors that some thirty followers of Traicho
 Kostov - who had been rehabilitated in September,  1956, in a
 gesture to placate Tito - had once again lost favor and been
 expelled from the Party.  On 11 May Dimitur Ganev, a mem-
 ber of the Politburo, formally accused the Yugoslav leaders
 of treason. against Communism, a theme which was amply
 developed in a Rabotnichesko Delo editorial of 15 May 1958.
 A secondary theme was supplied by the familiar quarrel over
 Macedonia which was revived for the occasion, Bulgaria and
 Yugoslavia accusing each other of casting concupiscent glances
 at the other country's slice of that area.
 52.     Moscow was presumably not at all displeased
 by the prospect. of envenoming Bulgarian- Yugoslav relations
 to the utmost, peaceful coexistence notwithstanding.  Indeed,
 the CPSU representative at the Seventh Congress of the BCP,
 held in Sofia 2-7 June, was Khrushchev himself who delivered
 the strongest attack yet against Bulgaria's recalcitrant neigh-
 bor.
 53.     Why Khrushchev should have thought it neces-
 sary or desirable to go to Bulgaria for that purpose is far
 from clear, for the Bulgarian declarations of loyalty to the
 Moscow Party line left nothing to be desired.  In his report
 to the Congress on Party activities since 1954, Todor Zhiv-
 kov had claimed for the BCP the merit of having steered the
 correct middle course between the Scylla of "mechanical im-
 itation" of the USSR and the Charybdis of exaggeration of
 "national peculiarities.'' Moreover, Zhivkov affirmed, the
 BCP subscribed to every word of Mao Tse-tung's statement
 at the Moscow Conference of November 1957, that the World
 Communist Movement '; ,4 ,,1

 could not develop successfully without a center,
 a head, that as the result of history the great
 Soviet Union is the head of the Socialist camp
 and that the head of the international Communist
 and Workers' movement is the heroic Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union.
 54.     Khrushchev, in the part of his speech deal-
 ing with the concept of "many roads to socialism, " returned
 the compliment, citing Bulgaria's success in land collectiv-
 ization - 90 percent of agricultural land had been collectiv-
 ized according to Zhivkov - as an example of "creative inter-
 pretation" of Marxism-Leninism.  Later in the proceedings
 Chervenkov elaborated on this theme, pointing out, that, un-
 like the USSR, Bulgaria had not nationalized the land or pro-
 hibited private trade in land.  The regime had, instead, pro-
 moted cooperative farms in which the members theoretically
 still owned their land.  But, Chervenkov concluded, "in prac-
 tice, the victory of cooperative agriculture means the aboli-
 tion of private ownership of land in the villages. "   Accord-
 ing to Chervenkov,
 the complete victory of labor-production coopera-
 tives in our agriculture is a clear example of crea-
 tive application of Marxism-, Leninism in the solu-
 tion of the common international task by taking into
 consideration the historical and national peculiar-
 ities of the country.
 It would follow that the "creative application" of Marxism-
 Leninism consisted, in his opinion, in the use of misleading
 labels and that gullibility was a Bulgarian characteristic.
 55.     It was, indeed, probably only a coincidence
 that two days after the end of the Congress, Chervenkov was
 relieved of his post of Minister of Education and Culture.

 It is true he himself had admitted that it was "unconditionally
 necessary to improve the work of the Ministry of Education
 and Culture, " but he may have meant to chide the Party for
 insufficient appreciation of its importance, despite his own
 efforts.  This interpretation is by no means incompatible .
 with the puzzling self-criticism for past failings which Cher-
 venkov belatedly delivered more than two years after his de-
 motion, at a time when Stalinism had long since ceased to be
 a term of approbrium in the Soviet orbit, except perhaps in
 Poland.
 I consider it my duty (he said), to say to the Con-
 gress that I have personally passed the school
 severe public self-criticism of our Party at the
 April 1956 Central Committee Plenu_m7, that in my
 practical work I have drawn and am trying to draw'
 all necessary conclusions from the decisions of the
 Plenum . . . and that I am doing this as a faithful
 soldier of the Communist Party.
 56.     It should be noted that while Chervenkov was
 conceding some past shortcomings, he took advantage of the
 opportunity to. give himself good marks for his present atti-
 tude, which was more important.  At any rate, he retained
 his deputy premiership and membership in the eleven-man
 Politburo and many competent observers thought he had been
 relieved of his ministerial duties merely in order to be free
 to play a more important political role.  The only other change
 of any importance was the demotion of General Peter Panchev-
 ski, who lost his alternate membership in the Politburo and
 the portfolio of Defense.  He was undoubtedly considered res-
 ponsible for the shortcomings in political work in the Army,
 of which a former head of the Political Department in the
 Ministry of Defense and member of the Politburo had com-
 plained to the Congress.

 57.     Economic data were supplied to the Congress
 by the First Party Secretary and the Premier.  Todor Zhiv-
 kov said that industry now accounted for two-thirds of the
 national product (as against less than one-fifth in 1939) and
 that agricultural output had increased about 20 percent since
 1948 - although livestock numbers had dropped.  The number
 of workers in State industry had grown from 92, 000 in 1929
 to 386, 000 in 1956, while the number of working peasants had
 decreased from 3, 325, 000 in 1948 to 2, 950, 000 in 1957, and
 the "intelligentsia" had grown from 191, 000 in 1946 to 458,
 000 in 1956.  Zhivkov did not mention the problem of urban
 unemployment, estimated at 14-18 percent of the labor force.
 58.     The report on the Third Five Year Plan,
 which was to run from 1958 to 1962, was delivered by Prime
 Minister Yugov.    Its chief characteristic was renewed em-
 phasis on the development of heavy industry, thus reversing
 the policy followed since the death of Stalin, especially after
 the Hungarian Revolution. 1  The amounts to be invested in
 agriculture were surprisingly small, and perhaps even more
 surprising was the fact that, in spite of practically total col-
 lectivization, the increase planned for agricultural produc-
 tion was only 35 percent, as against the 66 percent increase
 called for by the Second :Five Year Plan - which, it is true,
 had actually only amounted to 25 percent.  Equally surpris-
 ing was the failure of the plan to make any provision for the
 intensification of truck gardening.
 59.     In spite of the priority enjoyed by heavy
 industry, the Bulgarians were assured that the plan would
 ensure an improvement of living standards, which were ad-
 mittedly not yet "gat the desired level. " Real wages were
 1"Accumulation, " that is, investments plus state reserves,
 during the third Five Year Plan, was estimated to account for
 23 percent of national income, as against 18.4 percent during
 the second.

 expected to rise by 30 percent.  Coincidentally, labor produc-
 tivity in industry was expected to rise by 29 percent, and
 production costs to drop by 12. 5 percent.
 60.     In the meantime, the Bulgarian regime had to
 confess that, whether or not the old Bulgarian claim that they,
 unlike some of their neighbors, were poor but honest, had been
 justified in the past, it was not justified now.  Like other
 people's democracies, they found it necessary for economic
 reasons to crack down on thieves, embezzlers agid squander-
 ers of state property, and for political reasons to stop flagrant
 abuses committed even by highly placed Party officials.  Rabot-
 nichesko Delo of 4 July accused four deputy ministers, the heads
 of two national mass organizations, numerous presidents of
 regional and district committees, and collective farm managers,
 of "disgraceful violations of state discipline" in the acquisition
 of automobiles.  "A double violation is involved - illegal pur-
 chase and the diversion of social funds from their real, intend-
 ed destination, It the paper wrote, adding that the Council of Min-
 isters "had taken the necessary steps to deal with the violations. "
 61.    Extended but unspecified powers to deal with the
 small fry guilty of the simpler crimes against socialist property
 were granted to the people's courts by a decree of 11 August 1958.
 The decree also introduced the novel principle of awarding in-
 creased pay to "responsible" - that is, presumably honest -
 employees and officials.  Steps to curb a widespread abuse in
 another field were announced by Kooperativno Delo of 16 July.
 It appeared that the executive committees of many cooperative
 farms, apparently despairing of preventing the peasants from
 devoting most of their time to their private plots, had simply
 seized them.  The magazine invited the executive committees
 to restore the plots to their owners, their abolition being il-
 legal as well as uneconorrnic, for the vegetables, fruit and meat
 they produced were badly needed.  At the same time, the Party
 press took up with renewed vigor the campaign for the recruit-
 ment of youth brigades during the summer holidays to help with

 farm work, which had been revived in 1957 after a lapse of
 seven years.  On the other hand, the cities continued to be
 plagued by the problem of unemployment, although, when the
 authorities first admitted its existence (in June 1956) they
 had asserted that it was only a "temporary" phenomenon due
 to the influx of some 400, 000 peasants into the cities since
 1944.
 62.     Any remaining uncertainty as to the reasons
 for General Panchevski's dismissal was removed by an article
 in Narodna Armiya of 23 July 1958, complaining that meetings
 of Party activists in the armed forces were often nothing more
 than conferences at which. "communists are abused without any-
 one listening or paying attention to their opinions. " After the
 2-4 October Plenum of the BCP Central Committee, a number
 of high-ranking officers, including five generals, were said
 to have been dismissed for political shortcomings; a rumor
 which found adequate confirmation in a Narodna Armiya article
 of 16 October, in which General Mishev, head of the Political
 Administration in the Defense Ministry, revealed that the
 Plenum had taken further steps to correct political shortcom-
 ings in the Bulgarian army following the dismissal of Marshal
 Zhukov in October 1957.  The Plenum had decided, General
 Mishev stated, that Party organizations must concern them-
 selves with all aspects of military life, including training,
 that the number of Party activists in the army must be in-
 creased and receive better training, that military command-
 ers must participate in political work, and that ideological
 indoctrination of new recruits must be intensified.  As the
 Plenum had also decided that military orders and directives
 must not be criticized at Party meetings, although criticism
 and self-criticism were commended, it does not seem that
 the conflict between military and political officers had been
 satisfactorily resolved.

 63.     Bulgarian preoccupation with revisionism
 was once again confirmed by. the communique, issued on 10
 October at the end of the visit of East German leaders; this
 included a pledge to continue the "'irreconcilable" struggle
 against "modern revisionism" which found clear expression
 in the Yugoslav program .and had proved in 1956 to be the
 harbinger of "counterrevolution. 11
 64.     More sensational was the resolution p.9sbd
 by the 2-4 October Plenum that.the Third. Five Year Plan,
 adopted only four months earlier, in June 1958, was to be ful-
 filled one or two years ahead of schedule, in other words, was
 being scrapped.   As a preliminary n  asure, the collective
 farms were to be amalgamated into larger units.  On 10 Nov-
 ember, representatives of fifteen collective farms in. the neigh-
 borhood of Varna announced that they had decided to merge
 their farms into one large unit "in the image of the Chinese
 commune s tt and to call it "Commune. " The next day, Zhivkov
 gave a Plenum of the Central Committee details of the "great
 leap forward" which would carry the country to the "threshold
 of the building of communism, " mainly by trebling agricultur-
 al production by 1960.  This was to be achieved by a thorough-
 going "mobilization" of idle manpower mainly carrying out
 "do-it-yourself" projects.  Peasants were to work on irriga-
 tion and draint .ge projects .during the slack winter months,
 white collar workers were to do manual labor thirty to forty
 days a year and school children were to form labor brigades.
 At the same time, toe efficiency of the cooperative farms was
 to be greatly increased by their amalgamation into larger units.
 65.     Available investment funds were, contrary to
 standard practice, to benefit light and food industry rather
 than heavy industry.  Light was thrown on the respective posi-
 t-', ons of the USSR and the CPR by the mif.adventure of a Rabot-
 nichesko Delo editor, who on 7 December announced that all
 the collective farms in Botevgrad okolya (district) had been
 merged into a single unit and that the chairman was at the
 -29-

 same time okolya party secretary.  But the next day, the news-
 paper issued a denial of the information, adding that the guilty
 editor had been 'punished. " This was followed by a Radio Sofia
 broadcast on 16 December, denying that Chinese methods were
 being adopted in Bulgaria.  Bulgaria, Radio Sofia stated, learned
 first of all from the Soviet Union, and experience from other
 Socialist countries would be utilized "in a creative manner and
 in accordance with our specific conditions. 11
 66.     Practical steps to implement the allegedly
 specifically Bulgarian leap forward were taken without delay.
 On 16 December a decision of the Council of Ministers intro-
 ducing continuous workshifts in factories on weekdays was
 announced.  The Congress of People?s Youth Unions (27 Nov-
 ember-2 December) was informed in a speech by Zhivkov that
 "polytechnization" of education had not gone far enough and
 that the programs must be revised to provide for alternate
 days of classes and practical work.  Ostensibly, the aim was,
 as in other Communist countries, to give youth better prac-
 tical training, but there were a remarkable number of speeches
 in which the duty of young people to help fulfill the Five Year
 Plan ahead of time was heavily stressed.
 67.     The amalgamation of cooperative farms pro-
 ceeded with extraordinary rapidity.  On 12 December the
 authorities were able to announce that some 3, 300 farms had
 been merged into 700 larger units.
 68.     A sweeping economic and administrative re-
 organization was embodied in a number of theses spelt out
 by Zhivkov to a Central Committee Plenum which approved
 them on 17 January 1959.  Their main feature  was,  a far-
 reaching administrative decentralization achieved by the abol-
 ition of seven economic ministries as well as of the thirteen
 existing okrug s  (regions) and their 117 subdivisions (okolyas)
 which were replaced by thirty new "administrative-economic"

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 okrugs representing "a unification of the entire political.,
 state, economic and cultural life "within their territories. "
 As Yugov explained in a subsequent speech, the "basic" unit
 was to remain the obshtina (the smallest administrative unit,
 equivalent to a "commune") coinciding with the territory of
 each amalgamated collective farm, whose executive council
 was to coordinate its activities with the cbshtina people's
 council.
 69.     The main purpose of the reform was said to
 be to reduce red tape by eliminating two administrative units
 between the lowest, the obshtina, and the highest, the Coun-
 cil of Ministers.                            At least that was the theory, for the Min-
 istry of Agriculture was retained and a number of economic
 and social committees were newly created.  The Machine
 Tractor Stations (MTS) were to be abolished and the farm
 machinery sold to the collective farms.  Land rent was to
 disappear, compulsory deliveries to be abolished, and pay-
 ment in cash was gradually to replace payment in kind, except
 for minimum personal needs.  The goal was to equalize labor
 conditions in agriculture and industry, with the ultimate object
 of eliminating the difference between "national and coopera-
 tive ownership. "
 70.     Zhivkov also called for a revision of work
 norms in industry, higher wages and, later one shorter work
 days.  He recognized, however., that a serious obstac]c in the
 way of achieving a uniformly high standard of living was the
 difference in the number of dependents the wage earner had
 to support.  Zhivkov proposed to eliminate this obstacle by
 enabling all able-bodied members of a family, chiefly the
 women, to work.  For this it was necessary to provide more
 jobs - which he expected the "economic leap" to do - and to
 free women from housework "slavery, " by multiplying public
 canteens, laundries, and other services, and expanding the
 number of kindergartens and children's homes.  This would

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 not only help women to "overcome philistine bourgeois sur-
 vivals about life and work" but would also "create a new,
 healthy situation inside the family which will enable the com-
 munist education of youth. "
 71.     To round out his picture of the Bulgaria of
 the future, Zhivkov mentioned the need to "intensify" construc-
 tion in towns and for "rapid planning's in villages, to "make
 them like towns through water supplies, electrification, and
 transportation" while inhabitants of "dispersed small vil-
 lages" should be relocated.  One of the "main ways" to over-
 come the difference between intellectual and physical labor
 was, Zhivkov asserted, the polytechnization of education
 which included "participation in material production. " He
 failed to explain why the fact that a student or white collar
 worker worked one day a week with his hands would "wipe
 out the difference between intellectual and physical labor. "
 72.     Industrial production by 1962 was to increase
 by amounts varying between 50 and, 200 percent over the June
 1958 directives, depending upon the industries, the "prefer-
 ential status of branches making means of production" being
 preserved - or rather, reintroduced.
 73.     In agriculture, the leap forward was to be
 still more spectacular.  Noting that the earlier directives
 had envisaged."an average annual increase of about 8 per-
 cent, " Zhivkov announced that "in 1962, the national income
 in agriculture must be about 3. 5 times higher than that of
 1958.''
 74.     Summing up, Zhivkov informed his audience
 that by 1962,
 industrial production will be more than doubled, as
 against an increase of only 62 percent envisaged in
 the directives . . . agricultural productions will

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 attain 40 to 45 billion leva, or Z5 billion more . . .
 national income will attain 80 or 85 billion or 30 to
 35 billion leva more   . . in 1965 national income
 will total 100 to 110 billion leva . . . Labor produc-
 tivity is expected to increase Z.4 times as compared
 with 1957, instead of the 45 percent envisaged in the
 directives.  In 1965 it will be more than three times.
 75.     Observing that "socialism and science are
 inseparable, " Zhivkov, discussed at considerable length "the
 main shortcomings" of Bulgarian science and listed measures
 that had to be taken for their correction.  In this field, he
 failed to give any figures indicating even approximately the
 increases expected by 1962.
 76.     In his peroration, Zhivkov expressed the
 customary unbounded devotion of Bulgaria to the Soviet Union
 and promised to follow as always unswervingly in its wake.
 77.     The publication on 16 January 1959 of an
 amendment increasing the number of crimes legally punish-
 able by compulsory resettlement was undoubtedly not a coin-
 cidence, including as it did among them the crime of "shun-
 ning useful public work. " The laws embodying the various
 administrative reforms, the new state plan, and the budget,
 were passed by the National Assembly at its Third Session,
 9-14'March 1959.
 78.     Perhaps as a result of Zhivkov's visit to
 Moscow for the XXI Congress of the CPSU, some changes
 were made in the original plan.  The increase in agricultural
 production planned for 1959 was reduced from 100 to 74 per-
 cent.  The number of amalgamated cooperatives was to be
 increased from 650 to about 1, 000, some of them being, ac-
 cording to Zhivkov, 1 too large for direct management by ad-
 Report to National Assembly, 10 March 1959.
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 ministrative councils.  He also stressed that the
 trends and expectations in many administrative
 councils of cooperative farms that after the present
 National Assembly session almost all labor-produc-
 tion cooperatives in villages and all local industrial
 enterprises in villages will be turned over to them
 . . . are neither justified, nor present, nor realistic
 at the present stage . . . The industrial enterprise
 which is under the direct leadership of the okrug's
 people's council is the basic production unit.
 79.     Presumably in order to lay the ghost of the
 Chinese Communes once and for all, Rabotnichesko Delo
 (19 March 1959) found it expedient to stress that "the Bulgar-
 ian administrative-economic okrugs`r  might indeed differ
 from the Soviet "economic regions" and "the new organiza-
 tional forms of industrial administration in the GDR and Czecho-
 slovakia, " but that there were also "a number of essential dif-
 ferences" between them and the people's communes in China.
 The latter were being created primarily in the agricultural
 regions of the country, and "under them, " there was a "fusing
 of the administrative organs with administration of the economy, "
 while in the former, "both the organizational independence of
 the cooperative farms and the operative independence and pe-
 culiarity of the state enterprises and other economic organiza-
 tions" had been preserved.  Moreover, in Bulgaria, the obsh-
 tinas were the basic administrative unit within the (okra s,
 whereas the Chinese communes had no smaller administrative
 components.
 80.     Zhivkov ended his speech with a restatement
 of the Moscow Party line, as laid down by Khrushchev at the
 XXI Congress, on the laws governing the transition from
 socialism to communism.  He ended with full concurrence in

 the principle of the "almost simultaneous" passage to com-
 munism of all the countries of the socialist camp.
 81.     Considerable surprise was caused by Premier
 Yugov's unusual request - which was naturally granted by the
 National Assembly - that a minister be. relieved of his post
 because "of his failure to cope with his work. " The victim
 was Boris Taskov, Minister of Trade.  On 24 April, Radio
 Sofia announced that "the work and conduct" of comrade Taskov
 had been considered by the Central Committee of the BCP.
 which had decided to "release him" from the Politburo and
 to demote him to candidate membership of the Central Com-,
 mittee.  The most important reason for his failure, a Partien
 Zhivot editorial, broadcast by Radio Sofia on 12 June, ex-
 plained, was "his lack of conviction in the correctness of
 our party policy for the rapid development of our country. "
 He was, moreover, believed to have argued that there was
 no way of balancing the 1959 budget unless Bulgarian exports
 to the West were increased considerably.
 .82.     The reaction of the Bulgarian people to the
 ambitious aims of. the regime leadership can only be gauged
 from the intensity of their efforts to perform the necessary
 work. One can hardly take at face value Zhivkov's assurance
 to the Pleven Okrug Party aktiv on 28 February 1959, that
 "prefulfillment of the Five Year Plan . . . has been whole-
 heartedly approved and supported by the Bulgarian people, "
 especially since he himself proceeded to mention facts diffi-
 cult to reconcile with that claim.
 The fulfillment of the production plan by our indus=-
 try is 102 percent (he said).  However, a number
 of weaknesses lie behind this success.  Certain
 important enterprises are   . . lagging behind the

 irrigation projects for about 230, 000 decares of
 land (by the end of March?) but so far only 50, 000
 can be irrigated.  As for the reclamation of a planned
 100, 000 decares so far only 50 percent has been re-
 claimed . . . the insufficient rainfall during the win-
 ter and spring may cause additional difficulties.
 83.     The situation in Pleven county,- was by no
 means unusual, for a Kooperativno Selo editorial of 3 Febru-
 ary had reported that of the 1. 5 million decares of degraded
 land to be reclaimed by 30 March, less than one-third had
 actually been reclaimed in the first two-thirds of the allotted
 period.   Radio Sofia on 29 January complained that seed
 preparation for spring sowing was lagging alarmingly.
 84.     All this did not bespeak great popular enthu-
 siasm or augur well for the success of the plan, in agricul-
 ture at any rate.  There must, however, have been a radical.
 change in the popular attitude in March, if one is to believe
 the Central Statistical Administration announcement on 21
 April that "Tt'he plan concerning total industrial output during
 the first quarter of 1959 was fulfilled 101 percent.  Compared
 with the first quarter of 1958, the volume increased 18 per--
 cent. " In agriculture, too, great progress was claimed over
 1958 in the early tilling of land, in irrigation and in fertiliz-
 ing.
 85.     Apparently, all that had been needed in order
 to make the Bulgarians work twice as hard and twice as
 efficiently was the First Party Secretary's word, a decrease
 in the size of thekrugs, and an increase in the size of the
 collective farms.  Even more remarkable was the fact that
 their beneficial effects extended also to the animals:  the
 Statistical Administration announcement reported an increase
 in, livestock productivity during the first quarter on collective
 and state farms.

 Foreign Relations
 86.     In the foreign political field the most strik-
 ing development in 1958 was the sudden dropping in October
 of the territorial claim on Yugoslav Macedonia, although the
 campaign against Yugoslav revisionism continued unabated.
 As late as on 23 September, Rabotnichesko Delo carried a
 speech by Dimitur Ganev, one of the foremost, if not the
 foremost Party theoretician and future chief of state, in
 which he declared:
 The wonderful day will come when the (Macedonian)
 population on the other side of the border will suc-
 ceed in escaping from the impasse in which it
 presently'finds itself, in order to build a socialist
 society in Bulgaria . . .
 87.     But only a few weeks later, Premier Yugov,
 in a newspaper interview broadcast by Radio Sofia on 10
 October 1958, denied the existence of any special anti-
 Yugoslav campaign in Bulgaria, claiming that the differences
 with Tito were purely ideological.  Since that time, Bulgaria
 has lived up to the claim and has refrained from mentioning
 the territorial issue - as distinct from alleged oppression
 of Yugoslav Macedonians.  It does not seem far-fetched to
 assume that the order came from Moscow.  Raising claims
 to parts of Macedonia on irredentist grounds was bound to
 alarm the Greeks at a time when the Cyprus issue seemed
 to offer favorable prospects for a Soviet Bloc-Greek rap-
 prochement.  Furthermore, Moscow has very good reason:
 to discourage irredentism in general.  It would, for example,
 be difficult to prevent Hungarians from taking up the cry,
 with disastrous results for the Socialist "commonwealth"
 of nations. 1

 Standard of Living
 88.     Observers of the Bulgarian scene agree
 that as a result of the lowering of industrial investments
 the standard of living has improved somewhat during these
 last three or four years, 1 although it is still low and con-
 siderably below pre-war levels.  Food supplies are still
 surprisingly limited for an agricultural country, and the
 improvement in the consumer goods situation is evident
 much more in the quantity than in the quality and price of
 the products offered for sale.  Wages are very low.  The
 housing situation in Bulgaria is among the worst in'th.e Bloc.
 Unemployment must still be considerable.  Politburo mem-
 ber, Rayko Damianov, in his speech to the January 1959
 Plenum, conceded implicitly that even the "great leap for-
 ward" may not provide work for all unemployed, and he
 predicted that "by the end of the year, a.total of 140, 000
 new workers will be employed, " whereas competent ob-
 servers have put the number of unemployed at a minimum
 of 200, 000.. Moreover, the number of people seeking em-
 ployment will be swollen by part at least of the white collar
 workers slated to be transferred from their desks to "pro-
 ductive work", if the planned 45 percent cut in administra-
 tive personnel is carried out - not to mention the annual
 natural growth of the labor force.
 The Party
 89.     Party membership in Bulgaria is close to
 the general satellite average.  Zhivkov reported to the
 Seventh Congress in June 1958 a total membership of 485,
 000 - a gain of 29, 000 since the last Congress.  Since 1948
 the percentage of workers had risen from 26 to 36 percent,
 of white collar workers from 16 to 22 percent, while that

 of peasants had dropped from 45 to 36 percent.
 90.     Although there is no reason to assume that
 all Party members in Bulgaria agree as to the correct Party
 line any more than in other communist countries - or that
 they are even all loyal Communists   during these recent
 years there has been no outward evidence of the existence of
 identifiable factions.  Differences of opinion have no doubt
 arisen but the minority seems with few exceptions to have
 bowed to the decision of the majority, or at any rate of the
 leaders.  If Chankov, Tcherpetchev and Panov were disci-
 plined on account of ideological as distinct from personal
 differences, all one can say is that they must either have
 had no followers, or, if they did, they were abandoned by
 them without much ado.
 91.     Apparently,  "Kostovism" is still rampant
 in the BCP.  But Kostovism is described as a very mild form
 of national communism which can be easily kept under control.
 92.     What lends interest to the Party situation in
 Bulgaria is the Chervenkov enigma.  Since his dismissal as
 Premier in April 1956, on the charge of excessive fostering
 of the cult of personality, of Stalinism in other words, a
 charge he implicitly justified in his "self critical" speech to
 the Seventh Party Congress in June 1958, the opinions of
 "well informed" observers haves. been about equally divided.
 Some claim he is still the power behind the throne, on good
 terms with its present occupants and former proteges, Zhiv-
 kov and Yugov, and presumably in the good graces of Khrush-
 chev, while others claim that he is Zhivkov's and Yugov's dis-
 gruntled rival, is unfavorably looked upon by Khrushchev,
 that his influence is continually declining, and that he owes
 his continued membership in the Politburo and various tem-
 porary official assignments, -~ such.as'..-the po:rtfalio 'of Edu--
 dation.and.his :mis'lion...to:China?i-n Oct6ber,1958. r only to his

 considerable number of crypto-Stalinist members of the BCP.
 Of late, Chervenkov has also been depicted by a number of
 observers as the prime mover of the "great leap forward"
 and even as the head of a so-called "Chinese" faction, in al-
 leged opposition to a "Moscow" faction.
 93.     Since Chervenkov was no worse than other
 holdovers from the Stalinist era such as Ulbricht, Rakosi,
 Gheorghiu-Dej, or Enver Hoxha, and since anti-Stalinism
 was not exceptionally violent in Bulgaria, the reasons for
 his ouster remain as obscure as ever.  Considering the fact
 that it took Chervenkov ever two years to make up his mind
 to perform the rite of public self-criticism and that there
 seems little doubt that he adamantly opposed the policy of
 advances to Tito, it is possible that he had been more out-
 spoken than his colleagues in his private exchanges with
 Khrushchev on this subject and had thereby aroused the lat-
 ter's displeasure.  That was all that was needed to ensure
 Chervenkov's demotion by the BCP.  On the other hand, he
 was presumably wiser than Molotov, his Soviet counterpart,
 and refrained from active opposition to Khrushchev and his
 policies, as carried out by Zhivkov and Yugov.  Chervenkov
 could be content with the satisfaction of having been proved
 right by events:  the Hungarian Revolution and the second
 break with Tito.  And Khrushchev seems to have been mag-
 nanimous enough to forgive him for having been right, but
 not to the extent of publicly acknowledging the fact by having
 him reinstated in his former dominant position.
 94.    Very possibly, Chervenkov is perfectly con-
 tent with his present position in which he seems to enjoy
 considerable influence with little responsibility.  There is
 nothing to prevent harmonious collaboration with Zhivkov
 and Yugov, especially since, short of an unlikely reversion
 to unbridled police terror, it is difficult to imagine Cherven-
 kov acting very differently from them.  As for the "great

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 leap forward, " this seems to be one of those cases in which
 paternity will be impossible to establish.  Chervenkov certain-
 ly spoke and wrote approvingly of the Chinese developments,
 but he was always extremely careful to stress their peculiar
 suitability to Chinese conditions and to avoid the appearance
 of advocating their adoption in Bulgaria.  In general, the team-
 work between Chervenkov, Zhivkov, and Yugov seems to have
 been excellent, although that does of course not preclude dif-
 ferences of approach in initial policy discussions.
 95.     The selection of Chervenkov to address the
 official Party meeting in. Sofia to celebrate Lenin's birthday
 anniversary on 21 April, which was attended by the Soviet
 Ambassador, and his appointment two weeks. later to head
 the State Scientific Council, do not indicate any loss of influ-
 ence or any hostility toward him either on the part of Moscow
 or of his official superiors. in Sofia.  The occasion was seized
 by Chervenkov to stress his unreserved devotion to pure Len-
 inism.                      He even went so far as to assert that 'the task assigned
 to our people - to prefulfill the Five Year Plan - is integrally
 connected with Lenin's teaching. " If the attribution to Lenin
 of responsibility for the assignment of the heavy burdens of
 the great leap forward seems to contradict official assertions
 that they had been demanded by the people, this only tends to
 prove Chervenkov's privileged position.  On 11 June, Cherven-
 kov addressed a meeting devoted to Soviet-Bulgarian friend-
 ship and peace.  The speech, dealing almost exclusively with
 the former topic, was described as "ardent" by Radio Sofia.
 96. There also have been rumors of disagree-
 ments between Zhivkov and Yugov, the latter being represent-
 ed as critical of some of the more radical aspects of Zhivkov!s
 January theses. If so, all one can. say is that the official
 broadcasts of Yugov's speech on the subject gave no inkling
 of disagreement, rather the opposite.

 97.     At any rate, it hardly seems worth while to
 devote too much time to the solution of the power problem
 within the Bulgarian Communist Party.  For Chervenkov,
 Zhivkov, Yugov, and their friends and clients, it may or may
 not be important what position each one of them holds, but it
 is of little moment for the rest of the world or even for the
 vast majority of Bulgarians.  As far as one can tell, there is
 today no significant difference between the policies or methods
 that these men stand for, and none of them shows any indica-
 tions of being a potential Nagy, Tito, or even Gomulka.
 98.     Although economic plans in the socialist
 countries, for all their "scientific" foundation, have been re-
 vised upwards or downwards more than once throughout their
 history, the speed with which the Bulgarian Five-Year Plan,
 adopted in June 1958, was scrapped and the ambitiousness of
 the new goals were without parallel in the Soviet Bloc.  Since
 economic achievements of Communist countries have more
 than once confounded the predictions of skeptics, one may
 hesitate to prophesy the failure of the Bulgarian "great leap
 forward. " There is, however, no need to go to the other ex-
 treme and to take for granted that Communists never overrate
 their capabilities.  They have done so quite often in the past
 and have not become infallible overnight.  It seems, therefore,
 that, while a successful implementation of the stepped-up plan,
 or at least of parts of the plan, should not be completely ruled
 out, strong doubts on the subject seem fully justified.
 99.     To a large extent, these doubts are based upon
 what Zhivkov himself said or left unsaid.  He declared cate-
 gorically, for instance, at the January 1959 Plenum, that
 "the reorganization and development of industry and agricul-
 ture . . . cannot be accomplished without the all-round devel-
 opment of science . . . " In view of the limited time avail-
 able, one would have expected Zhivkov to announce that all

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 Bulgarian scientists and institutions were ready to.go.  Just
 the opposite.  Zhivkov bluntly accused Bulgarian science of
 "seriously lagging behind" and proceeded to enumerate what
 needed to be done, starting with the necessity to "solve the
 basic issues in organization, problematics, and the material
 basis of the individual branches of science. " Among the basic
 issues were a discussion of necessary changes in the "organ,
 izational. structure, methods, and style of leadership of the.
 Bulgarian Academy of Science, " the construction of a well
 equipped physics institute, "minimum funds necessary for
 scientific institutes, comfortable premises and up to date
 equipment" part of which should be made in Bulgaria if it
 proved "possible and economically advantageous. " Another
 problem still to be solved was the "selection and training of
 scientific cadres." It was also rather surprising to hear,
 after the announcement of the planned production figures,
 our economic sciences . . . must analyze and the-
 oretically sum up the experience of our socialist
 development, bring to light and show the ways and
 methods . . . for a steady increase in public pro-
 duction, for a sharp rise in labor productivity, for
 a reduction of costs   . . for a correct development
 of our trade, our finance and price policy, for a
 rapid increase in our national income, and for rais-
 ing our people's material prosperity .   . On the
 basis of their scientific research work, they must
 make practical suggestions . .   for the develop-
 ment of our socialist economy..
 No wonder the Planning Commission was reported to have
 asked Zhivkov to give it more time before announcing the
 target figures, a request which he did not heed.
 100.    Zhivkov's theses were completely silent. on
 the subject of finances, although a sharp increase in produce

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 tion obviously demanded a corresponding increase in funds. 1
 101.    Premier Yugov, in his speech to the January
 Plenum, did say that it would demand. "large capital invest-
 ments, " but subsequent references to the possible sources of
 the necessary money, certainly a matter deserving serious
 treatment, were almost haphazard.  Yugov mentioned the need
 for economy - a "state-conscious approach to the problem of
 spending" to stretch the available resources, as he put it.
 The chairman of the State Planning Commission, Rusi Khris-
 tozov, stated over Radio Sofia on 19 February, that the planned
 increases in the number of workers and in labor productivity
 were the main factors in the growth of the national income,
 but that "a certain increase in the relative share of the accum-
 ulation fund of our national income is inevitable. f?
 102.    As it seems most unlikely that these internal
 sources of additional capital will prove adequate, one might
 have expected Bulgaria to be counting on foreign, that is Soviet,
 credits.  But all that has transpired on this subject so far are
 two rather casual statements by Premier Yugov and First
 Deputy Premier Damianov.  Referring to a 130 million ruble
 credit, announced on 27 December 1958, for the construction
 of a thermo-electric station and an oil refinery - to process
 Soviet crude oil, most of the refined products being shipped
 back to the USSR, just as Bulgarian plants had been producing
 clothes out of Soviet textiles for the Russians - Damianov
 explained in an interview on 19 February that this credit would
 help Bulgaria to carry out the "great leap forward. "
 IIn order to attain a 12. 3 percent increase in agricultural
 production, the Czechoslovak Government is increasing the
 1959 allotment to agriculture by 12.4 percent.  Statement by

 103.    Yugov, in his address to the January Plenum,.
 spoke about "the large amount of machines that will be im-
 ported from the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist
 countries" and ended with the statement that "close coopera-
 tion.with the countries from the socialist camp and especially
 the aid received from the Soviet Union, will be .an important
 factor in the implementation of these great tasks. " On 13
 March, he specified that 89.5 percent of the increase in na-
 tional income in 1959 (31.8 percent) was to. be obtained from
 the increase in labor productivity.  Neither Zhivkov nor
 Khristozov explained whether the promised reduction in
 working hours and in the work week, and the improved stand.
 and of living were to be achieved parallel with the great leap
 forward in production or only after it had made substantial
 progress.  Assuming the latter to be the case it would appear
 that Zhivkov relied on the increase in the labor force and a
 temporarily reduced standard of living to. achieve the goal.
 The increase in productivity can hardly. make itself felt for
 quite some time, for on Zhivkov's own showing much of the
 indispensable machinery still remains to be built.  In agri-
 culture, for example, where he laid great stress on land
 reclamation and especially on expansion of irrigation, he
 also said that "it is necessary to master as soon as possible
 the production of machines for land improvement, irrigation,
 fertilizing, livestock breeding and so forth. ". In other words,
 the Bulgarian factories have still to master the techniques
 for the production of needed machinery.  Moreover, most
 industries, before they can increase production, need a
 greatly expanded "raw materials basis" for which in turn
 many new machines are a prerequisite.    It should also be
 noted that spking of the second Five Year Plan period,
 Khristozov claimed no more than a 21. 6 percent increase
 in individual worker output in industry. It will have to be
 many times larger over the next three or four years.  In
 the meantime, Rabotnichesko Delo reported on. 19 March
 1959, that "labor production in a considerable number of .
 Sofia enterprises in January 1959 was lower than the 1958
 average. "

 104.   As for additional labor resources, the regime
 can undoubtedly count on the unemployed, numbering "more
 than 100, 000, " according to Khristozov.  How long it will take
 to organize the canteens, nurseries, laundries and other ser-
 vices needed to free most women from their household duties
 - provided they agree that factory work is really more pleas-
 ant than housework - is difficult to estimate, but there seems
 little doubt that Zhivkov will be disappointed in his expecta-
 tions of greatly intensified agricultural work during the winter
 months.  Even the strongest Communist faith cannot keep a
 man warm or melt the snow or soften the soil in sub-dro
 weather, nor dry it fast enough to be worked during warmer
 spells - except perhaps in the southernmost parts of the coun-
 try.                         It may also be pertinent to remark that, if after forty
 years of socialism it was only by plowing up vast expanses of
 virgin soil that the USSR managed to increase agricultural
 production to any noticeable extent, and if the Soviet Seven-
 Year Plan foresees an increase of only 70 percent, it seems
 unlikely that Bulgaria which has no Kazakhstan can increase
 agricultural production by 300 percent in four years merely
 through merging small collective farms.
 105.    Surprisingly, fruit (except grapes) and Arege-
 tables, high priced crops in which Bulgaria was supposed to
 specialize according to the 1957 CEMA decision, received
 little attention. It is true that vegetable production was to
 increase 50 percent, but sugar beets were to increase 91 per-
 cent, cotton 80 percent and corn 66 percent.  Incidentally,
 Khristozov, in his expose of the 1959 economic plan to the
 National Assembly on 13 March, commented that adequate
 amounts of fertilizer would not be available. The deficiency
 was to be made up by stable manure, but for once he failed to
 specify the prescribed increase in production.
 106.    Inevitably, the question arises what made the
 Bulgarian leadership run the risk of damaging its prestige by
 formally committing itself to such over-ambitious goals?
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 Even if theoretically attainable, they would demand a degree
 of coercion and austerity which already twice before, in 1953
 and 1956, had proved extremely dangerous.  Would it not have
 been wiser to set the sights somewhat lower, and eventually
 to overfulfill the plan?
 107.   It is indeed impossible to find a rational ex-
 planation for the action of the Bulgarian leaders.  One can
 only fall back on the belief of the ancients that man is pun-
 ished by the gods by fits of megalomania or h bris, which
 blind him to realities.  On the other hand, the inspiration for
 the wishful thinking which culminated in the targets set for
 the great leap forward is fairly obvious.  It was undoubtedly
 supplied by the Soviet Seven Year Plan which was accompan-
 ied by clear allusions to the desirability of an allround rais-
 ing of the economic sights.  As internal socialist competition
 is in. high favor in the communist world, and as - in the words
 of the East German Tribuene pf 18 April 1959 - "every day's
 pre schedule implementation of the plan in the socialist com-
 petition Eith capitalism  is a gain of time and therefore a
 success for socialism, " the Bulgarian leaders, dizzy with
 their victory in the race for collectivization, were naturally
 eager to gain first place in the general rating of socialist
 states.  At the same time that the alleged successes of the
 Chinese great leap forward were creating a world sensation
 - that is, everywhere but in the USSR where they were ig-
 nored - it is not surprising that the Bulgarian leaders, pre-
 sumably prodded by Chervenkov, should have been tempted
 to emulate them.  Both countries were industrially backward,
 but had an excess of manpower largely as a result of over-
 rapid collectivization and had a generally docile population.
 If the idea worked in China, why should it not in Bulgaria?
 108.    What was certainly even more important
 than production figures themselves was their connection with
 the problem of the achievement of communism, a matter
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01445R000100120001-4
 which directly affected claims to leadership in the Communist
 orbit.  The Bulgarian leaders had some justification in con-
 sidering their country the most advanced on the road to com.
 munism, excepting the USSR, of course.  Having very little
 industry to socialize, and only a small urban population to
 feed, they had been able to concentrate on agriculture, and
 could rightfully boast that they were the first to have social-
 ized both industry and agriculture.
 109.    The resolution of the Seventh Party Congress
 in June 1958 boasted that ;'socialism is the completely domin-
 ating and only commanding force in the entire national economy.
 In our country the socialist construction of our economy.has
 already been achieved. " But significantly, Khrushchev, while
 full of praise for Bulgarian successes in collectivization, did
 not echo the BCP's boast.  B. Ponomarev, writing in the
 October 1958 issue of Kommunist, endorsed the claim that
 socialism had conquered in Bulgaria, but omitted any men-
 tion of the claim that the construction of socialism had al-
 ready been achieved.
 110.    One can well imagine that the Bulgarian. lead-
 ers were eager to proclaim that they were following immediate-
 ly in the wake of the "Big Brother" and were starting to build
 communism.        What a feather in their cap if they were to over-
 take the other more advanced satellites I  But in the absence
 of any encouragement from Moscow, the Bulgarian leaders
 were certainly hesitant to take such a step alone and without
 at least moral support from a powerful quarter.  At this junc-
 ture, on 29 August 1958, the CPR published a resolution which
 concluded with the words:  "The realization of Communism in
 our country is already not something far away.   We must
 actively use the form of the people's communes and through
 it find the concrete road of transition to Communism. " On
 November 21st, General Chu Te-h,, China's deputy chief of
 state and vice-chairman of the Party's Central Committee,

 told a youth rally that full-blown Communism would be
 attained in this generation.  Zhivkov practically paraphrased
 Chu-Teh when he announced on 1 December 1958, in a speech
 to the Komsomol Congress:
 The building of Communism will begin much earlier
 than we had imagined and certain fundamental objec-
 tives of Communism will be achieved in the near
 future by the present leaders of the Party and of
 the Government .     The children who will finish
 school ten or twelve years from now will find. them-
 selves in a purely communist country.
 111,    Two weeks later, the Chinese announced their
 leap backwards.  Life published Khrushchev's strictures on
 Chinese claims, as reported by Senator Humphrey, and by
 17 January 1958, Zhivkov claimed no more for Bulgaria than
 to be entering on the stage of  the completion of the construc-
 tion of socialism and the preparation of the conditions for the .
 transition to Communism. "
 112.    Whereas therefore in June the socialist con-
 struction of the Bulgarian economy had been described as
 already "achieved, " seven months later the construction of
 socialism still remained to be "completed. "   At the same
 time Zhivkov stressed the leading role of the USSR more
 heavily than ever, for it indicated "the only correct path for
 the building of the Communist society. " Chervenkov in an
 article on the Chinese communes, published by Rabotniches-
 ko Delo of 15 January 1959, emphatically stressed that the
 innovation was only suited to the specific conditions in China,
 and in no case could enable a country to overleap the social-
 ist stage.
 113.    At the end of the month, Khrushchev clinched
 the matter by his statement to the X)  Congress that after the
 -49,-

 fulfillment of the Seven Year Plan it would take the USSR
 about five years more to "complete the initial stage of Com-
 munist construction" and that in any case the socialist coun-
 tries: '.'would more or less simultaneously pass to the higher
 phase of Communist society. "
 114.   It would have been too much to expect the
 Bulgarian leaders to practice the virtue of self-criticism to
 the point of admitting they had been mistaken.  In his report
 to the National Assembly on 10 March, Zhivkov put the
 blame for having jumped the gun on the anonymous authors
 of "certain articles published in our press and periodicals
 which expressed the incorrect views that we are now begin-
 ning construction of the highest levels of the Communist
 society . . . " He then proceeded to recapitulate and to
 endorse Khrushhiev's dicta on the fundamental difference
 between socialism and communism - reward according to
 labor and allocation of goods according to need - and on the
 continuity between socialism and communism, which made
 it impossible to define when one came to an end and the other
 began.
 115.   It maybe observed, however, that whereas
 in January Zhivkov had retreated to the point of merely
 claiming that Bulgaria was entering the stage of the "com-
 pletion of the construction of socialism and the preparation
 of the conditions for the transition to communism, t' in March
 - after his visit to Moscow - he denied only that Bulgaria was
 "beginning construction of the highest levels of the commu-
 nist society. "1
 116.    Even without the indiscretions of the Bulgar-
 ian newspapers, the Chinese inspiration for the Bulgarian
 great leap forward seems apparent.  The identical term used
 to describe the new phase, its amplitude, far exceeding any

 plan revision within the Soviet Orbit, some features of the
 administrative reorganization, the stress on "communaliza-
 tion" of family life, all had a distinctly Chinese flavor.  Nor
 can Chervenkov's mission to China at the particular time it
 took place have been a mere coincidence.  And perhaps most
 revealing were the excessive protestations of conformity
 with the Soviet model.
 117.    Nevertheless, Zhivkov and his friends, know-
 ing that one cannot be too careful when one has to do with Mos-
 cow, and doubtless disturbed by the ominous absence of Soviet
 praise for the Chinese developments, prudently lagged some
 distance'behind Mao T.se-tung and refrained from openly com-
 mitting themselves.  Events amply justified their prudence.
 118.    But the fact remains that the Bulgarian lead-
 ers did show an unusual amount of courage, one might even
 say, of "national" communism, in going as far as they did.
 Granted that they probably expected Moscow to swallow the
 Chinese initiative with outward good grace and.to_,pernit. them
 to ride on the Chinese coattails, the mere fact of embarking
 on such a course without Moscow's prior approval betrays an
 unwonted spirit of independence.  It also betrays, besides a
 surprising misunderstanding of Soviet motivations, the same
 megalomania which was apparent in the economic targets of
 the Bulgarian leap forward.  Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi.
 It should have been obvious to the Bulgarians that Bulgaria
 was not China and that for a satellite to out-perform the
 USSR smacked of lese-majesty:  What was more important,
 Moscow was clearly not going to allow a satellite to decide
 for itself how far it had progressed on the road to Commu-
 nism.  Moscow's claim to leadership of the communist camp
 being ostensibly based on the fact that it has advanced fur-
 thest on the road to Communism, it will not allow a satellite
 to claim to have caught up with it.  That would simply be an-
 other road to Titoism.  Hq.pce the importance of the thesis

 of the continuity between socialism and Communism, explicit-
 ly accepted by Zhivkov.  In the absence of objective criteria,
 it is up to the leader of the most advanced communist party
 to decide for each country when the moment to enter upon the
 communist stage has come.  Moreover, to avoid ill consid-
 ered "great leaps forward, " or possible bad feeling, the
 socialist states have been warned that progress will be "al-
 most simultaneous. It
 119.    Although the Bulgarian leaders have undoubt-
 edly been absolved b y the Kremlin of any disloyal intent, all
 indications point to Soviet luke-warmness toward their econ-
 omic plan and skepticism with regard to its chances of suc-
 cess.                  It is true that Zhivkov, after his return from the XXI
 Congress in Moscow, reduced the planned increase in agri-
 cultural production to a more realistic figure.  It is also true
 that in March, Khristozov confirmed the grant of the Soviet
 credit, but its modest proportion considering the magnitude
 of the task was tantamount to damning with faint praise.  In
 Soviet articles dealing with economic progress in the Orbit,
 the absence of the usual encomia for overfulfilling norms,
 even of simple acknowledgement of the Bulgarian effort, is
 remarkable.  Izvestia, for example, in a 17 January 1959
 article on the subject, bestowed no special praise on Bulgaria.
 Pravda, in an article on'The Great Commonwealth (sodruzhest-
 vo) of Socialist Countries" (28 April 1959) wrote:
 In the seven-year period . . . the USSR plans to
 increase the output of industrial production 1. 9
 times.  The growth of industrial production in
 Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the GDR will be ap-
 proximately the same.  The national economy of
 the CPR and the other socialist lands will develop
 at a fast pace.
 Bulgaria, which plans to treble industrial production in four
 years, is not even mentioned by name.

 120.    Soviet skepticism with regard to Bulgaria's
 prospects is not astonishing, considering that many Bulgar-
 ians themselves are high y pessimistic, especially as the
 most important prerequisite, popular enthusiasm, seems to
 be entirely lacking.  Talk as Zhivkov may of the compulsion
 under which the planners allegedly found themselves to heed
 the "indomitable striving of the people's masses to advance
 their movement, aimed at fulfilling the tasks ahead of sched-
 ule, "1 he sounds less convincing than other Central Commit-
 tee members,  Rada Todorov, for instance, who declared:
 'None of us, including me, believes that the job will be very
 easy or very smooth . . . But I believe that our people under-
 stand and will understand that all this is happening for their
 welfare, for their happiness . . . it 2    Vladimir Bonev,
 another mer;ber, thought that in "implementing these gigan-
 tic tasks . . . we will indisputably encounter great difficulties,
 particularly in Sofia where these reorganizations affect a cone
 siderable part of our national industry and whence the most
 employees will be sent into material production. "3 P. Kuba-
 dinski, Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, admitted
 that "the nationwide movement for the prefulfillment of the
 Five Year Plan also encounters serious difficulties of objec-
 tive and subjective character. r'4
 121.    These statements hardly seem to confirm
 Zhivkov's. claim that the great leap forward had been decided
 in response to an irresistible popular demand.  Chervenkov

 appears to have been more honest when he placed the respon-
 sibility on Lenin.  Whether the, great leap succeeds or fails,
 it will hardly improve the standing of the Party among, Bul-
 garians in the coming years.  Failure would do no good to
 the Party's prestige and to public faith in Communist planning,
 while success can only be at'the price of an exhausting phy~
 sical effort, the material reward for which is bound to lag
 considerably.  There is no reason to assume Bulgarians will
 like it any better in 1959 than in 1953.
 122. It is therefore safe to predict a further drop.
 in Communist Party popularity in Bulgaria, which, as a mat-
 ter of fact, has never been as high as seems to be rather
 widely assumed.  It is true that collectivization has been
 achieved in Bulgaria more rapidly and completely than in any.
 other Communist ruled country, but there are no grounds for.
 the assumption that the Bulgarian peasants were any less op-
 posed to it than Polish, 'Yugoslav, or Hungarian peasants.
 The difference seems to have been that the regime could af-
 ford to disregard the inevitable drop in production.  Nor does
 the fact that in the cities there have been no large scale anti-
 regime outbreaks as in East Germany, Hungary, or Poland
 prove that the Bulgarian white and blue collar classes are
 any less opposed to the regime.  Their numerical weight is,
 however, much smaller.  As for the Bulgarian intelligentsia,
 it has been one of the most outspoken in its opposition to the
 regime.
 123.    On the other hand, in Bulgaria, practically
 alone among the satellites there is no historic anti-Russian
 as distinct from anti-communist sentiment.  There was very
 little fighting, and therefore plundering by the Russians after
 World War II.     No occupation troops remained to offend nation-
 al pride, nor had Russia ever annexed any formerly Bulgarian
 territory.  Political and cultural ties with Russia, the "Pro-
 tector" of the smaller Slav nations, had always been close.

 However, the fact that Russians are not generally hated and
 feared by Bulgarians, as they are by Russia's immediate
 neighbors, does not make present day Russian ideology any
 more palatable to them.  But it may help to explain - together
 with the stolidity of   e Bulgarian - why popular opposition
 remained below the boiling point in 1956 and why, in the words
 of the BCP Central Committee meeting of 5 December 1958,
 the regime leaders were able, by a judicious display of "im-
 placability" and "Communist principles, " to save the country
 "from defeat at the hands of revisionism. if
 124.    Of equal, if not greater importance, for the
 relative smoothness of the Bulgarian waters was the failure
 of the BCP to produce another Kostov during the 1956 crisis.
 Under present circumstances, even if one should emerge, it
 would make little difference.  The pendulum is now every-
 where swinging away from revisionism, let alone from anti-
 communist outbreaks.  If and when it again swings in the op-
 posite direction, the Bulgarian people can be counted upon to
 be as eager as any other to take advantage of every favorable
 opportunity to regain their freedom.
