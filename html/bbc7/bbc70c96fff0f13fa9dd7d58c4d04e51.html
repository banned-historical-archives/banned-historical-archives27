 VIETNAM  WEEKLY                    REVIEW
 INTRODUCTION
 Vietnamese communist comment on President Nixon's foreign policy report
 sees "nothing new" in its review of U.S. Vietnam policies which,
 according to Hanoi and the Front, add up to pursuit of Vietnamization
 in an attempt to impose "neocolonialism" in South Vietnam.  Propaganda
 claims that the report's discussion of America's future world role is
 indicative of the "stubborn and crafty" nature of the United States
 in its "weakened and defeated position."
 Current Moscow comment on Vietnam focuses on the report's statements on
 the Vietnam problem.  Dealing in stock generalities, Soviet commentators
 complain that the President reaffirmed the "old policy" of Vietnamization
 and that despite talk about peace the Administration is in fact spreading
 the war and blocking progress at the Paris talks.  Peking media have not
 yet mentioned the President's report.
 Coverage of the 55th session of the Paris talks on 19 February--as
 usual confined to VIA and LPA accounts of the session itself--features
 PRG delegate Mme. Binh's charges of U.S. use of chemicals in South
 Vietnam and DRV acting delegation head Nguyen ivjinh Vy's general review,
 along standard lines, of the main issues.  VNA notes that Ambassador
 Habib did not make a formal statement at the session, but it does not
 indicate the nature of the lengthy verbal exchange between the
 delegates.
 Other propaganda on allied use cf chemicals in South Vietnam includes
 a statement from the South Vietnam War Crimes Commission, released by
 the PRG representative at an 18 February press conference in Hanoi.
 The statement, which publicizes statistics on the alleged use of
 chemicals since 1961, is followed by a flurry of other statements and
 comment on the subject.
 The departure of the Soviet Foreign Ministry delegation led by Deputy
 Foreign Minister Firyubin from Hanoi on 21 February is reported by VNA
 on the 22d.  VNA says the delegation was received by DRV Foreign Minister
 Trinh, but there is no indication of the substance of any talks.
 On 24 February Moscow briefly reports the departure of the group, which
 had arrived in Hanoi on the 13th.
 Alleged U.S. action against the DRV on 19 and 20 February is condemned
 by the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to Hanoi radio on
 23 February.  The spokesman charges that the United States launched
 artillery attacks from ships "against many areas belonging to Vinh
 (Gang village, Vinh Linh area" on the 19th and that U.S. planes "intruded"
 into the airspace of Ha Tinh Province and the Vinh Linh area the following
 day.  No air attacks on the 20th are claimed.

 25 FEBRUARY 1970
 Vietnamese communist media report scattered military action in the South.
 A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial, 'broadcast by Hanoi on 21 February,
 focuses on the situation in the delta and on the importance of attacking
 the allied pacification effort.
 Politburo member Le Thanh Nghi her recently attended and addressed a
 number of conferences held by various DRV production branches to
 review achievements in 1969 and set forth directions and tasks for 1970.
 On 17 February Hanoi radio reports that Nghi visited the architectural
 conference; VNA reports on the 18th that he met with the light industry
 branch;* on the 19th Hanoi radio reports his attendance at the chemical
 production branch conference; and on the 22d the radio recounts a
 communications and transportation branch conference, also attended by
 Nghi.
 An editorial in the January issue of HOC TAP, the party's theoretical
 journal, concentrates on the importance of the commemoration of North
 Vi:.,tnam's four major anniversaries this year.  The editorial lists
 party building, the improvement of cadres' and party members' knowledge
 of Marxism-Leninism, party lines and policies, and President Ho's
 ethics and behavior, as well as the initiation of a production and
 combat emulation movement as components in the sh1^cessful celebration
 of the anniversaries.
 PRESIDENT NIXON'S FOREIGN POLICY REPORT
 HANOI AND     President Nixon's 18 February foreign policy report is
 THE FRONT     denounced in fairly widespread comment in Vietnamese
 communist media.  The first available Hanoi reaction appears
 in a domestic broadcast on the 19th, there is further comment in a
 broadcast on the 20th, and on the 22d commentaries are published in
 NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN and a VNA commentary is publicized by
 the press and radio.   (The NHAN DAN commentary, noted in the Hanoi radio
 press review, has not been disseminated by 1:he radio or VNA.)
 The first Front comment on the President's report is a brief derisive
 remark by PRG delegate Mme. Binh at the 19 February Paris session.
 There is LPA comment on the report on the 22d.
 *  On 74 February Hanoi ra0.io had briefly reported a conference of
 the light industry branch and had noted Nghi's presence there.
 Presumably VNA'3 report on the 18th discusses the same conference.

 25 F;BBRUARY 1970
 The 19 February Hanoi broadcast charges that the President's report
 reiterated the "deceitful arguments" put forward by the U.S. side in
 Paris, accused the DRV-PRG side of lacking goodwill, and "absurdly"
 said that the United States would adopt a flexible and generous attitude
 when serious talks begin.  According to the broadcast, the report
 demonstrates that the Administration refuses to seek a negotiated solu-
 tion and "only wants to score success by means of force."  It notes the
 report's reference to President Thieu's 11 July 1969 election proposals
 and dismisses them as proposals for elections "organized by the
 puppets under the cannon muzzle of the puppet and U.S. occupation
 troops."  The Hanoi broadcast on the 20th again attacks the report's
 statements on Vietnam and goes on to assail the United States' global
 strategy.
 The broadcasts on the 19th and 20th note that the President pointed to
 the strengthening of the South Vietnamese armed forces and extension
 of pacification as the main elements of Vietnamization.  The VNA
 commentary on the 22d says the report "magnified the imaginary successes"
 of the Vietnamization program.  And the 22 FebruaryQUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 commentary echoes the earlier broadcasts in saying that, the document
 could not conceal the President's "anxiety" over the Vietnamization
 program's future when it posed, but did not answer, a number of questions
 regarding the program's status.  "In short," the paper comments, the
 President "conceded that the Vietnamization program is facing very
 gloomy prospects."
 The LPA commentary of the 22d, much like Hanoi's comment, calls the
 President's report "merely a rewrite" of the principal 1969
 presidential addresses dealing with Vietnam, all of which were
 "repeatedly rejected by the Vietnamese people."  The commentary says
 the President revealed his "evil colonialist design to firmly cling
 to the Thieu-Ky-Khiem clique" in his reassertion that a great nation
 cannot renege on its pledges.
 MOSCOW      Dealing in stock generalities, commentaries on the President's
 foreign policy report complain that the President, while
 "admitting that the Vietnam wax has already divided American society,"
 reaffirmed the "old policy" of Vietnamization.  They also assail the
 report for failing to give a timetable for troop withdrawal.   Matveyev
 in IZVESTIYA on the 20th finds "absolutely nothing new" on Vietnam in
 the report.  Commentators note that despite promises to end the war
 when the Administration came into office, a year later the war is
 spreading into Laos and Cambodia and the United States is blocking
 progress at the Paris talks.  Commenting on the statement that pacifica-
 tion will be extended, commentators describe pacification as a program
 of "terror" and "annihilation."

 Mayevskiy ii.,PRWDA on 22 February, commenting on responsibility for the
 continuation of the war, says that the authors of the presidential
 report are "wasting their ink" when they try to lay responsibility
 on "the Soviet Union because it is helping the Vietnamese people"--an
 allusion to the expression of regret, in the section of the report
 on relations with the Soviet Union, that the Soviet Union bears a
 heavy responsibility for continuation of the war because it gives
 the DRV the overwhelming majority of its war materials.  Mayevskiy
 ignores the statement that the Soviet Union has "failed to exert a
 helpful influence" over the North Vietnamese at Paris.
 PARIS TALKS:   19 FEBRUARY SESSION
 COMMUNIST      PRG delegate Mine. Nguyen Thi Binh's statement at the
 SPEECHES       55th session of the Paris talks dealt almost exclusively
 with the chemical warfare aspect of the "extermination
 war" allegedly waged by the United States in South Vietnam.  Repeating
 charges made earlier in Vietnamese communist propaganda, she Stated
 that while the Nixon Administration had recently renounced any use of
 bacteriological weapons and first use of lethal or paralyzing chemicals,
 American troops were continuously spraying chemicals in South Vietnam
 in order to "poison the population and destroy the crops."  She
 charged that under the Nixon Administration the United States has
 "intensified" the use of chemicals and toxic gases in South Vietnam.
 Over the last eight years, she said, the United States has sprayed
 toxic chemicals over 43 percent of South Vietnam's arable land and
 "poisoned" 1,293,000 people, most of them elderly people, women, and
 children.
 Remarking that the U.S. reaction to the Son My incident had been to label
 it an isolated one, Mme. Binh asked:   "Does the chemical warfare that
 the United States has been conducting in South Vietnam these last few
 years also constitute an 'isolated case?"'  She coupled her routine
 demand that the Unite :states end its "aggression" in the South with a
 call for U.S. renunciation of the use of "chemical weapons" and of "any
 other criminal act to massacre the South Vietnamese people."
 The VNA account of the session indicates that acting DRV delegation head
 Nguyen Minh Vy expressed support for Mine. Binh's statement in remarks
 made prior to the reading of his formal statement.  And the attack on
 U.S. chemical warfare was sustained on 20 February with the release of
 a statement by the PRG Paris delegation spokesman--carried by LIBERATION
 PRESS AGENCY on the 24th--denouncing the State and Defense Departments
 for reacting in a cursory fashion to Mme. Binh's accusations.

 Reporting the remark in Nguyen Minh Vy's statement that U.S. "aggression"
 against Vietnam was the immediate cause of the war, the VNA account
 notes that the remark .;as responsive to Ambassador Habib's denial of an
 allegation to this effect at the previous session.         (Vy said U.S.
 aggression is "so obvious an objective reality in Vietnam that it needs
 to be proved no further.")   The account further notes Vy's standard
 critical portrayal of the Nixon Administration's Vietnam policies, its
 attitude at the Paris talks, and its domestic policies and practices.
 In this connection, VNA reports Vy's denunciation of the Administration's
 "fascist repression" of antiwar leaders at the Chicago conspiracy trial.
 He points by contrast to the "goodwill and serious attitude" of the
 DRV and PRG and to the "fair and logical" NFLSV 10-point proposal for
 a settlement.
 Vy picked up Ambassador Habib'& remark at the 54th session that the U.S.
 side was flexibly and reasonable, asking rhetorically how flexibly
 and reasonably the United States is behaving when it is pursuing the
 Vietnamization program, "encroaching on the security and sovereignty"
 of the DRV, posing "conditions" for an allied troop withdrawal,
 maintaining the Saigon "stooge" administration, and downgrading the Paris
 talks with a view toward "sabotaging" the conference.
 ALLIED        VNA reports GVN Ambassador Lam as repeating "the ridiculous
 SPEECHES      charge that North Vietnam commits aggression against the
 South" and as "brazenly" supporting U.S. policy in South
 Vietnam.  Lam claimed, VNA adds, that "the Vietnamese people are
 committing aggression in Laos, thereby attempting to conceal the
 aggressive nature of the United States, which is intensifying and
 expanding its special war in that country."
 VNA says that Ambassador Habib "delivered no speech" but "only repeated
 the old themes and renewed the preposterous demand for mutual withdrawal
 with a view to evading the fundamental problem--namely, that the United
 States must withdraw totally, promptly, and unconditionally its troops
 and the troops of its satellites from South Vietnam."  The VNA account
 thus obscures the nature of the lengthy verbal exchange during which
 Habib spoke nine times.  VNA reports routinely that Mme. Binh and
 Nguyen Minh Vy, in their additional remarks, "completely rejected all
 the absurd allegations" of the U.S. and GVN delegates and declared that
 the responsibility for the Paris deadlock lies with the allied side.

 STATEMENTS ON USE OF CHEMICALS IN THE SOUTH
 A flurry of propaganda denouncing alleged allied use of chemical weapons
 in South Vietnam is highlighted by a statement of the South Vietnam War
 Crimes Commission, released at an 18 February press conference held by
 the PRG representative in Hanoi.  VNA's report that day on the press
 conference indicates that the statement contains statistics on the use
 of -:hemical weapons in the South and that it charges that Vietnam is being
 used as a testing ground and the people gas, guinea pigs,   The statement
 routinely asserts that the Nixon Administration has increased the use of
 chemical weapons.  It recalls the President's 25 November statement on
 CBW and claims that the tear gas and weed killers excluded from his ban
 are being used in Vietnam to "massacre" people.  Chemical weapons, it
 alleges, have never before been used on such a large scale or for such
 a long period as in the Vietnam war.
 Other statements on allied use of chemicals include one from the Vietnam
 Biologists Association, dated 20 February and released by VNA on the 22d,
 which similarly charges that the extent of the use of chemicals in the
 Vietnam war is without precedent.  This statement alleges that chemicals
 are being used "in execution of a systematic and large-scale genocide."
 A statement from the Kien Phong revolutionary committee, dated 10 February
 and broadcast by the Front radio on the 24th, denounces the allies for
 intensifying the use of chemical weapons in the province.  Also on the
 24th, LPA publicizes a "recent" communique of the central Trung Bo NFLSV
 committee claiming that the allies diunped over 8,000 tons of noxious
 chemicals on the region during 1969,   The communique lists chemical
 substances frequently used, including mixtures of arsenite and arsenate,
 and enumerates gases allegedly used against the population in pacification,
 including CS,  The teaching staff and students of Hanoi Polytechnics on
 23 February held a meeting which condemned the use of chemical weapons
 and, according to VNA on the 25th, adopted a resolution demanding that
 the allies stop using toxic chemicals.
 Several of the statements outline the effects of the chemicals on humans,
 including birth defects and insomnia as well as death.  LPA reports on
 the 24th that the South Vietnam Wa:1 Crimes Commission has released
 documents proving the bad effects of the chemicals on child-bearing.
 A Hanoi radio commentary on the 24th cites statistics from the South
 Vietnam War Crimes Commission statement and again charges that the use
 of chemicals has increased since the Nixon Administration came to power.
 It recalls President Nixon's 25 November statement on CBW and calls
 attention to domestic U.S. criticism of continuing use of chemical
 weapons.  The commentary also describes the use of chemical weapons 'by
 the allies as genocide.

 SCATTERED ACTION IN THE SOUTH, COMMENT ON PACIFICATION
 Vietnamese communist propaganda continues to report scattered military
 activity throughout the South.  The only available comment comes in a
 21 February Hanoi broadcast of that day's QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial
 claiming successful attacks on ARVN marine units in the delta..  The
 editorial says the ARVN units were sent to replace the U.S. 9th Division,
 which had been "forced" to pull out, and to strengthen forces supporting
 pacification.  ARVN main force divisions and U.S. combat units are also
 being mobilized to "assume pacification," the editorial says.  The
 paper states that by continually attacking troops supporting pacification,
 the communists can not only annihilate forces but also create favorable
 conditions for guerrilla warfare, thus assisting the rural people in
 rising up against the allies.  The armed forces, particularly guerrilla
 and regional units, are urged to step up combat and force the allies
 to leave their fortifications, thus exposing themselves to heavier blows.
 SOUTHERN WOMEN'S AND INFORMATION/CULTURE GROUP MEETINGS
 Liberation Radio on the 14th reports a conference held by the information
 and cultural jection of the central Nam Bo NFLSV committee from 26 January
 to 3 February,  No conference of this sort is known to have been
 publicized previously.  The gathering reviewed work accomplished in 1969
 in the ideological and political area, praising the popularizing of Ho's
 testament.  Stress was on determination to consolidate and develop the
 section, "especially the assault propaganda forces."
 The third all-South women's conference was held from 5 to 12 February,
 according to a Front radio report on the 18th.  This conference, a-i:,ended
 by more than 100 delegates, reportedly reviewed the 1969 women's move-
 ment and discussed their tasks for 1970.  The meeting was presided over
 by Mrs. Nguyen Thi Dinh, president of the Liberation Women's Union.
 (The second conference, held in January 1969, issued its communique
 on 20 January.)
 The communique released by the conference, broadcast by the Front on the
 18th, hails women's achievements in 1969 and charges that pacification
 involves terrorization and "massacre" of women.  The communique further
 accuses the allies of trying to weaken the women's support by holding
 out the lures of a depraved culture and money and by "subduing them
 sentimentally."  The women's movement dcv'!ioped rapidly where the 1969
 conference resolution was disseminat':d 4tlt was weakened in areas where
 the cadres clung to old work methods and had no confidence in the
 masses, the communique says.   It adds that 1969 successes showed the new
 capabilities of the women's struggle against Vietnamization.  A
 resolution for 1970 urges the women to mobilize and work using armed and
 political struggles. to defeat Vietnamization, to annihilate allied
 forces, and to prese_ve the revolutionary administration.

 ASSEMBLY STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY HOANG VAN HOAN
 A communique on a DRV National Assembly Standing Committee meeting held
 18-19 February, carried by Hanoi radio on the 19th, notes that this
 "regular" session was presided over by committee vice chairman Hoang
 Van Hoan,  This is the first session of the Standing Committee that
 Hoan has presided over since 10 June 1969, duriag the extended
 absence--from 20 March to 19 July--of its chairman Truong Chinh.
 Available propaganda offers no explanation for Truong Chinh's current
 apparent absence,
 According to the communique, the Standing Committee discussed its
 tasks for 1970,  It approved a regulation for the application of the
 marriage and family laws in the Tay Bac Autonomous Region, and it
 heard a report from the Nationalities Commission of the National
 Assembly on the situation of nationality activities and the campaign
 for permanent resettlement and cultivation in the cooperativization
 of agriculture in the mountainous regions.  The committee also
 approved several ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary appoint-

 HOC TAP ON DRV's FOUR MAJOR ANNIVERSARIES IN 1970
 An editorial in the January issue of HOC TAP, the VWP's theoretical
 jouranl, concentrates on the importance of the commemoration of North
 Vietnam's four major anniversaries in 1970:  the 40th anniversary of the
 VWP, 3 February; Lenin's 100th birthday, 22 April; Ho's 80th birthday,
 19 May; and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the DRV, 2 September.
 Calling 1970 an extremely important year because of the anniversaries, the
 editorial recalls that on 22 April 1969 the Politburo* had pointed out
 that activities marking the anniversaries must aim at 1) improving the
 cadres' and party members' knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, of the party's
 lines and policies, and of President Ho's ethics and behiavor; 2)
 initiating a production and combat emulation movement "in order to
 transform the spirit of the four great anniversaries into concrete acts";
 and 3) consolidating and developing the party.
 The editorial says the 1970 anniversaries will be good occasions on which
 to accelerate the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle and socialist
 construction.  It adds that "we must strive to study" Marxism-Leninism,
 the party's lines and policies, and Ho's virtues "in order to strengthen
 solidarity and unanimity with the party and consolidate absolute
 confidence in the party Central Committee's leadership and in the
 Vietnamese revolution's inevitable victory."
 *  The Politburo resolution was not released until 8 July, when it was
 carried by Hanoi radio.

 The editorial recalls that the Central Committee had decided that 1970
 was a good occasion "to consolidate and develop the party" and "absorb
 into the party a new class of party members called the 'Ho Chi Minh
 class.."  It urges preparation for and satisfactory implementation of
 the new party member recruiting phase and emphasizes the importance of
 training new party members.
 HOC TAP points to the importance of carrying out production and combat
 tasks and of satisfactorily implementing the 1970 state plan.  It goes on
 to note that socialist reforms in the national economy will be continued;
 and in this connection it points to several continuing problems which must
 be corrected.  It says that in agriculture "we will continue to satisfac-
 torily and correctly implement the agricultural production cooperative
 statutes and correct deviations and mistakes in the 'three-contract
 system for peasant families."'  With regard to handicrafts, it urges the
 people "to overcome such negative manifestations as stealing  raw
 materials and materials from the state .  .  . and other exploiting forms
 which have appeared in a number of handicraft cooperatives."  And it says
 "we must continue achieving socialist reform vis-a-vis small trade which
 has developed again in cities and vis-a-vis bourgeois industrialists and
 merchants--a number of whom are again practicing illegal business."  In
 1970, says the editorial, or%~er and security must be firmly maintained,
 free markets closely managed, and all social vices and illegal business
 undertakings elminated.
 The editorial also stresses the importance of mobilizing labor for production
 and improving economic   leadership.   It claims that "only by successfully
 mobilizing the socialist labor force will we be able to overcome the present
 situation in which the number of persons engaging in productive labor is
 small, labor output is low, and social products are 1t.mited."  The journal
 declares that the two tasks--the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle and
 socialist construction--require everyone to engage in productive labor; it is
 necessary "to make everyone deeply aware of the present situation and
 tasks .  . , to effect a strong ideological change" so that the 1970 state
 plan may be implemented and the North's economy improved, making it possible
 to "fully and promptly satisfy all. requirements" of the two main tasks.
 SOVIET CRITICISM OF PEKING POLICIES ON VIETNAM
 Some Moscow broadcasts in Mandarin currently attack Peking's Vietnam
 policies.  A 20 February commentary on the Sino-U.S. meeting in Warsaw that
 day recalls that such talks had been held in early 1965 allegedly to discuss
 the Chinese attitude toward planned U.S. bombing of the DRV, Mao Tse-tung
 having previously assured the United States that the Chinese would go to
 war only if Chinese territory were directly attacked.  The commentary once
 again recalls that Peking turned down a Soviet proposal for united action
 to counter U.S. aggression in Vietnam.  A broadcast on the 23d revives
 charges that Peking profits from selling food supplies in Hong Kong to
 U.S. forces from Vietnam.

 U. S n "AGGRESSION ,  BOMBING I N PLAIN OF JARS CONDEMNED
 PATHET LAO      T'he NLIIX denounces various aspects of alleged U.S.
 aggr:~ssion in connection with current fighting in the
 Plain of Jars area through a barrage of official statements on
 20 February.  An NLIIX Central Committee statement condemns the United
 States for using B-52's on 17 and 18 February for the "first time to
 bomb the Xieng Khouang-Plain of Jars region."  Decrying this "crazy act
 of war" wnich further aggravates the situation in Laos and seriously
 threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the statement routinely
 calls upon the peace-loving countries of the world, especially the
 participants in the 1961-62 Geneva conference, to compel the United
 States to respect the Geneva agreement.  The use of B-52's is also
 condemned in a 20 February message to the Geneva conference cochairmen
 from Phoumi Vongvichit, NLHX Secretary General and member of the national
 commission for implementation of the Geneva agreement.
 Another NLIDC Central Committee statement on the 20th once again deplores
 the participation of Thai troops in the fighting in Laos, citing an AP
 report on 28 January as confirmation that there are "about 12,000" Thai
 troops in Laos.  A third Central Committee statement that day denounces
 alleged "war crimes" against Buddhists in Xieng Khouang Province bf the
 Americans and their "puppets."
 An "authorized statement" by the Pathet Lao news agency on 20 February
 denounces a press conference held by the RLG Information Minister to
 condemn the North Vietnamese attack on the Plain of Jars and to present
 DRV prisoners.   (Pathet Lao Radio carried the statement on 19 February,
 saying it was dated the 18th.)  The statement "flatly refutes" this
 "trick" and argues that current attacks launched by the Laotian People's
 Liberation Army and the Laotian Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces are
 aimed at punishing the "U.S. aggressors and their puppets" for their
 "illegal nibbling attacks,"  On 17 February a similar VNA statement had
 refuted  he "calumny" of the press conference.
 HANOI            VNA takes the 14"ixon Administration to task on 21 February
 for intensifying the war in Laos by the "new step" of
 using B-52's as well as other aircraft to bomb Laos to an "unprecedented
 degree."  It also refers to Souvanna Phouma's 19 February statement that
 "North Vietnam escalates the war in Laos," and the press agency "flat7,,r
 rejects" his "deceitful claim."

 A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial carried by VNA on 24 February hails the
 exploits of the Laotian People's Liberation Army in the Plain of Jars?
 Meng IGhouang area, noting that the area has been part of the "liberated
 zone" since before the signing of the 1962 Geneva agreement.  It praises
 the Pathet Lao's victories and warns that the United States and its
 puppets remain very aggressive and stubborn, are intensifying the use
 of aircraft, including B-52's,and are ordering Souvanna Phouma to
 "slander" the DRV with charges it is escalating the war in Laos.  The
 editorial concludes by praising the victories of the Laotians as a
 "strong encouragement to and a valuable act of coordination with the
 Vietnamese people's resistance to U.S. aggression."
 On 23 February a Hanoi English broadcast to Southeast Asia cites
 expressions of concern by Senators Mansfield and Symington over the use
 of B-52's, saying that these statements expose Souvanna Phouma's
 allegation regarding the DRV presence as cover for U.S. air escalation.
 MOSCOW      Routine-level propaganda from Moscow charges the United States
 veith escalating the war in Laos and denounces alleged, American,
 efforts to conceal the truth about the U.S. activity.  A TASS dispatch on
 the 19th, for example, takes the State Department to task for refusing
 to comment on the bombing and for keeping secret the testimony at the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Laos.  At the same time,
 TASS notes, the American press is publicizing the 17 and 18 February
 B-52 strikes.  A 22 February broadcast to North America says the United
 States is developing a "second Vietnam" in Laos, claiming among other
 things that more than 12,000 "American advisers" are there as well as
 1,200 Green Berets.  An IZVESTIYA article summarized by TASS on the 23d
 condemns U.S. efforts to conceal the real scale of its aggression in Laos
 and predicts further escalation will stem from Washington's "recent
 decision" to use B-52's against liberated districts.  A PRAVDA commentator,
 according to TASS on the 25th, says the Pentagon's "dangerous" attitude
 toward defeat in the Plain of Jars is revealed by the fact that  ii'
 recent days a large part of the U.S. air power based in Thailand and
 in the Seventh Fleet was used in Laos, the U.S. Command even deciding to
 "weaken temprvarily" the bombings of South Vietnam.
 PEKING      NCNA reports the NLHX Central Committee statement denouncing
 the use of B-52's as well as a number of reports attributed
 to Pathet Lao media on the fighting in the Plain of Jars, but Peking is
 not known to have commented on its own authority.

 PRC  AND  NORTH  KOREA
 NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR BACK I N PEKING
 Chou En-lai received the DPRK Ambassador for a "cordial and friendly talk"
 on 17 February, according to NCNA that day, and the Pyongyang KCNA
 reports on the 19th that the meeting took place in a "friendly atmosphere."
 Shortly thereafter, TASS reports on 23 February that Kosygin received
 the DPRK Ambassador in Moscow for a "friendly" meeting.
 The reports of the meeting in Peking provide the first available
 Indication of the ambassador's presence in the PRC capital in more
 than two years?  Accredited in June 1967, he was last reported in Peking
 in September 1967 when he hosted a reception marking DPRK National Day.
 The new sign of further normalization of Sino-Korean relations follows
 reports some weeks ago of the signing of a new agreement on navigation
 on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers.*  Since then, Pyongyang has been giving
 the PRC some atypical routine-level propaganda support:
 +  A MINJU CHOSON article carried by KCNA on 5 February denounced a U.S.
 "scheme" to perpetuate the occupation of Taiwan, "an inseparable part
 of the territory of the PRC," and decried this "grave hostile act against
 People's China."  A similar charge was made in a NODONG SINMUN commentary
 carried by KCNA the same day scoring Japanese support for alleged U.S.
 aggressive plans in Asia.
 +  A MINJU CHOSON article also carried by KCNA on the 5th, denouncing
 President Nixon's 30 January press conference, remarked that he spoke
 "balderdash about 'countering nuclear attack' from People's China,"
 thus showing that he was resorting to schemes of "nuclear blackmail."
 +  On 7 and 12 February KCNA gave unusual replay to Peking comment,
 reporting an NCNA commentary on the State of the Union address and a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY article denouncing Japanese militarism.
 Korean Army Day on 8 February, however, got standard propaganda treatment
 from Peking.  In the pattern of last year, Peking publicized only an
 NCNA report of a reception and film show by the DPRK military attache.
 The report noted that in toasts the DPRK attache and the PRC deputy
 defense minister praised the "militant frierdehip cemented in blood"
 of the two peoples and armies.  Although this formulation has not
 appeared in Peking propaganda on DPRK Army Day for some years, it has
 appeared sporadically in reports on other North Korean anniversaries,

 MIDDLE  EAST
 25 FEBRUARY 1970
 PROTEST MEETINGS IN USSR CONDEMN ISRAEL FOR ABU ZABAL RAID
 Moscow continues to extol the recent Soviet "initiatives" toward a
 Middle East settlement--the Kosygin letters to the United States,
 Britain, and F:Lznue, revealed on 12 February, and the 16 February
 TASS statement pegged to Israel's bombing of a UAR metal plant on
 the 12th.  The Abu Zabal raid is the focus of comment assailing
 Israel for its deep raids into Arab territory and its treatment of
 the Arab population in the occupied territories.  Following the
 TASS statement, Moscow on the 20th began tc mount a campaign of
 protest mestings throughout the USSR condemning the Abu Zabal raid
 and supporting Soviet policy in the Middle East.  The ground was
 prepared for the protest campaign, still being publicized on the 25th,
 with a flurry of statements by various Soviet public organizations
 and messages to their UAR counterparts expressing indignation over,
 Abu Zabal,  At the same time, comment on the raid rejects Israeli
 explanations of pilot error.  A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article by
 Agaryshev on the 21st recalls that Nasir has said that if Israel
 has decided to bomb civilian enterprises, "not only Egyptian plants
 will be attacked."
 Current Moscow propaganda is largely devoid of comment on the U.S.
 and Soviet proposals for a settlement or of references to the Big
 Four talks.  There _:, still reiteration of the need for a political
 settlement, which Israel is accused of thwarting.  The November 1967
 Security Council resolution continues to be cited as the basis for a
 settlement, and there is the usual insistence on Israeli withdrawal.
 IZVESTIYA on the 21st, along with other comment, construes U.S. policy
 in the Middle East as an extension of "Vietnamization," with Israel,
 using American weapons, attempting to attain U.S. aims in the region.
 Having long argued that the United States seeks the downfall of all
 "progressive" Arab governments, Moscow plays up President Nasir's
 charge, in recent interviews, that the Americans have tried for years
 to overthrow the Egyptian regime.  Soviet commentators maintain that .
 this effort will prove"unsuccessful.  TRUD on the 24th, acknowledging
 "temporary successes" by the Israeli "aggressors," echoes the language
 of the Kosygin notes in declaring Soviet determination to frustrate
 imperialist adventures in the Middle East.
 Abba Eban's visit to the FRG--the first by an Israeli foreign minister--
 is the peg for a recounting df Bonn's past and present support for Israel
 and fs seen by Moscow as evidence of further cooperation, despite FRG
 "talk about the desire to restore links" with the A  I-)s.

 SWISSAIR CRASH      Moscow comes to  he defense of Palestinian resistance
 organizations, which have denied responsibility for
 the 21 January crash of an Israel-bound Swissair plane near Zurich and
 for the explosion aboard an Austrian airliner on the same day.*  Previous
 incidents involving El Al planes, for which responsibility was claimed
 by Palestinian fedayeen groups, were virtually ignored by Moscow.
 Implying its disapproval of such actions, Moscow briefly reported but
 gave no further attention to the hijacking of an El Al plane to Algeria
 in July 1968, and it acknowledged but obscured the details of the
 December 1968 attack in Athens and the February 1969 incident in Zurich.
 The subsequent hijacking of a TWA airliner to Damascus and incidents
 involving El Al offices abroad apparently got no Soviet propaganda
 attention.
 In Moscow's first reaction to the new incidents, TASS commentator
 Velichanskiy says on the 23d that Washington and Tel Aviv immediately
 attributed the crash to sabotage by Arab guerrillas, seizing on "a
 false communique hurriedly concocted which allegedly came from some Pales-
 tinian organization." Noting the Palestinian denial;,-he says the.."yells" of
 Israeli and Western "propaganda" were aimed at distracting attention
 from the Abu Zabal raid, justifying in advance announcements of new
 U.S. arms deliveries to Israel, and "compromising the heroic struggle
 of Arab guerrillas" on "occupied Arab territory"--a qualification Moscow
 has always been careful to insert when supporting partisan operations.
 Subsequent comment sustains the line that the outcry is intended merely
 to cover up Israeli and imperialist "crimes" in the Middle East, and
 Moscow stresses Palestinian and Arab denials of involvement.  A Shakhov
 foreign-language commentary on the 24th asserts that Western propaganda
 uses one set of criteria when "it is a matter of crimes in Vietnam, Laos,
 or Cambodia" but resorts to "every kind of slander and fabrication" when
 it is a matter of people's struggles for liberation.
 Dealing with Israeli Foreign Minister Eban's visit to West Germany, a
 Moscow commentary broadcas`:; in German on the 24th says the visit is
 taking place in an atmosphere of "premeditated hysteria and unresttained
 propaganda" against the Arabs and cites "agitational" news about the
 "recent fire in Munich" and the Swissair crash.  These and other
 incidents are linked with partisan activity, the commentary says,
 although the West German police admit there is no evidence to prove this.
 *  An initial claim of responsibility for the crash by a fedayeeii splinter
 group was reported on the 21st by REUTERS and Baghdad radio and disavowed
 the next day, and a spokesman of the fedayeen's new Unified Command on
 the 23d deplored the explosions on both planes and denied any responsiblity
 by the Command's member organizations.

 PALESTINIAN DELEGATIONS VISIT TO USSR GETS LITTLE PUBLICITY
 Moscow is uninformative in its minimal attention to the 10-20 February
 visit -to the USSR by a Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation
 led by it3 chairman, Yasir Arafat, at the invitation of the Soviet Afro-
 Asian Solidarity Committee  A cor;nunique released by TASS on the 20th
 and published in PRAVDA on the 21st says the group visited Moscow,
 Leningrad, Volgograd, and Tashkent, and held talks in Moscow with the
 host organization on questions of mutual interest, "including cooperation
 In the join. struggle for liquidation of the consequences of the
 imperialist aggression by Israel and in defense of the lawful rights*
 and interests of the Arab people of Palestine."  The PLO delegation, it
 says, told of the people's resistance in the occupied territories and
 expressed gratitude for the Soviet people's support.
 The communique stresses the people-to-people aspect of the vsit, with
 no suggestion of any c  Ltacts by the delegation with Soviet Government
 officials.  The delega,;ion thanks the Soviet people for their support,
 it says, and the Soviet host committee emphasized the Soviet people's
 support for the Arab peoples "against the Israe:L:  aggressors and their
 imperialist patrons in support of the national liberation and anti-
 imperialist struggle of the Palestinian Arab people."  A subsequent
 commentary in Arabic on the 23d follows the lines of the communique9
 again emphasizing the "people's" friendship in citing Arab reaction to
 the visit
 During the visit an Arabic-language commentary on 12 February said the
 struggle of the Palestinian fedayeen "has enjoyed the recognition and
 support of all progressive mankind."  The Arab press, it noted, has
 pointed out that the visit aims at strengthening contacts between the
 Soviet and Palestinian Arab peoples.  The Arab papers are correct, it
 added, in saying that Arafat's visit is a "logical result of Soviet
 policy which aims at backing national liberation movements."  It
 explained that the basis of the attitude of the Soviet Government and
 pecple toward the Palestinian patriots' struggle "is not prompted by
 temporary considerations necessitated by any specific circumstances,"
 but by "firm principles," and it went on to recall Kosygin's statement
 of support for the Palestinian organizations' struggle in a 10 December
 speech.  Kosygin, however, had added a qualification to his statement
 which the commentary seems at pains to deny:   "In conditions of the

 return to Beirut that the Soviet attitude toward the Palestine issue "has
 changed greatly," and that the USSR "now recognizes our people's national
 rights" in Palestine.  AL-MUHARRIR says this is an "important step," since
 the Soviets had been using the expression "legitimate rights."

 continuing Israeli aggression," he had said, the Soviet people regard
 th' struggla of Palestinian organizations for the liquidation of the
 aftermaths of the aggression as a just national liberation and anti-
 imperialist struggle and support it.
 ARAFAT        The MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY (MENA) on the 20th says that
 C01+ENTS      a Voice of Palestine radio correspondent accompanying the
 delegation reported that the group held several meetings
 with "senior Soviet figures," and that Arafat met with the chief editors
 of PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA and with TASS and Soviet TV officials.  Reporting
 Arafat's arrival in Beirut from Moscow on the 20th, MENA says that Arafat
 expressed great satisfaction with the results of the visit, "where he was
 given head-of-state treatment," and said his talks with "Soviet officials
 and trade union representatives were very beneficial."  Asked whether the
 USSR had decided to extend aid to the fedayeen operations, MENP says
 Arafat replied that no such agreement was reached "but we hope. -co receive
 such aid."
 At a press conference in Amman on the 24th, reported by MENA's Damascus
 office, Arafat said the visit to the USSR "was supposed to have taken
 place four months ago," before the Arab summit conference in Rabat.
 The coming days, he added, "will show the great, reaction to and the
 important outcome of this visit."  TASS briefly reports the press
 conference, citing Arafat as saying the delegation was warmly received
 and that the Soviet people support the "national liberation, anti-
 imperialist struggle of the Palestine Arab people."
 The Syrian news agency reports on the 24th that a Fatah source announced
 that, a French CP delegation would be arriving in Amman shortly to continue
 discussions begun during a Fatah delegation's visit to France 4-10 February.
 The Fatah delegation attended the French CP congress, the report adds, and
 also held talks with representatives of the NFLSV, the DRV, the USSR, and
 other countries "which helped strengthen the Palestine revolution's
 international relations."

 MOSCOW HITS CHINESE ON WARSAW TALKS; PEKING RESTRAINED
 While Peking devot+.~s only one item to anti-Soviet themes, a 21. February
 NCNA report on Czechoslovak-Soviet relations, Moscow accuses the Chinese
 of seeking to put pressure on the Soviets at the current Peking
 neg;tiation$ through dual policies of propagating anti-Sovietism and
 war psychosis at home while: talking with the United States in Warsaw.
 Mosc,:w charges in a Mandarin broadcast on 19 February that the Chinese
 :leaders' militaristic domestic policies are aimed at "applying pressure
 tc the Soviet Union in order to win the upper hand at the Soviet-Chinese
 talks in Peking" and suggests that the holding of talks in Warsaw is
 intended "to intimidate the Soviet Union  by presenting a possibility of
 collu2ion with the U.S. imperialists."  The current issue of the SovJ_et
 weekly LIFE ABROAD, according to the Belgrade TANYUG on the 22d, directly
 links the Warsaw talks with an intensification of Chinese hostility toward
 the Soviet Union and other socialist states.
 Soviet media fcr the first time point tc Chinese initiative for the resumption
 of the Warsaw talks.  For example, a 21 February commentary'in French over
 Moscow's purportedly unofficial R&.dio Peace and Progress states that "it
 is the Chinese side which specially insisted on holding this meeting as
 quickly as possible"
 After totally ignoring the 14 February anniversary of the 1950 Sino-Soviet
 treaty of alliance for the fourth successive year, Moscow uses the 36th and
 37th installments--on 20 and 22 February--of the continuing Radio Moscow
 aeries in Mandarin on "Glorious Chapters in the History of Soviet-Chinese
 Relations" to discuss the significance of the treaty, But the commentaries
 begged the question of the treaty's current status by restricting the
 discussion to the period of the early 1950's.
 In Moscow's continuing portrayal of dissension at all levels of the CCP
 in the course of efforts to rehabilitate the party organizations, a
 23 February TASS report on public show trials in Peking places Mao and
 Chou En-lai in the same camp by citing slogans and wall posters defending
 them against "ultraleftists," class enemies, and counterrevolutionaries.

 PEKING REPORTS WARSAW SESSION. CONTINUES RESTRAINED ATTACKS
 Following the pattern set in January, Peking issued a brief, noncommittal
 statement after the 20 February session of the Warsaw Talks, stating
 only that the meeting had been held and that the next one would be
 scheduled by mutual agreement.  Anti-U.S. polemics are still being
 aired, though with some elements of restraint.  There has been no
 Peking comment so far on the President's State of the World message;
 and while attacks on the State of the Union message continue, PRC
 media still avoid mention of the President's remarks about China.
 The most pointed anti-U.S. statements to appear in PRC media during
 the past week are contained in scattered references to the downing
 of a U.S. drone over PRC territory on 10 February.  A broadcast to
 Taiwan on the 22d charges, for example, that the "Nixon government"
 has stepped up the tactic of talking of peace while "continuing to
 carry out military threats and war provocations."  Concern over Japan's
 potential as a major threat to the PRC is evinced in a 23 February
 NCNA article which also brings in the USSR and the "Taiwan independence
 movement" as parts of a U.S.-instigated plot to pave the way for
 Japanese reannexation of Taiwan.

 STRATEGIC                             WEAPONS
 ARMED FORCES DAY ARTICLES MENTION SOVIET ABM CAPABILITY
 Articles by Defense Minister Grechko and Chief of the General. Staff
 Zakharov marking the 52d anniversary of the Soviet armed forces
 (23 February) break a two-year pattern of reticence on the question
 of Soviet ABM capability.   Grechko's article, appearing in PRAVDA on
 the 23d, says that great 2hanges have taken place in the troops of the
 USSR's air defense and that "the combat means we possess are capable
 of reliably striking both enemy aircraft and missiles, regardless
 of their altitude and velocity, at great distances from the defended
 targets,"   In IZVESTIYA on 22 February, Marshal Zakharov says that
 thn air defense forces have the latest means for insuring the
 reliable destruction of "any aircraft and many rockets" of the enemy.
 This formulation, introduced by the then Defense Minister Malinovskiy
 in April 1966, was repeated in substance by key spokesmen through
 early 1968 and appeared in comment surrounding the armed forces
 anniversary that year.
 Since the early-1968 period, Moscow has broached the matter of the
 USSR's ABM capability with less frequency and in language, less
 precise than the Malinovskiy formulation.  Typically, Warsaw Pact
 commander Marshal Yakubovskiy, in a 23 February 1969 RED STAR article
 marking last year's armed forces anniversary, said Soviet forces were
 equipped with "rocket antiaircraft complexes providing reliable
 protective coverage for our Soviet skies."  Commander of the Ground
 Forces General Pavlovskiy, interviewed by TASS on 7 May 1969 on the
 anniversary of V-E Day, stated that the "air defense forces . . .
 are capable of reliably shielding the country's territory and
 successfully destroying any air targets."
 :he Moscow domestic service report of last November's October Revolution
 anniversary parade in Red Square said that the soldiers of the
 "antiair defense are always ready to thwart a sudden enemy strike
 from the air, to destroy the enemy's means of attack, and to safeguard
 the vital activities of the state and the fighting ability of our
 armed forces."  A Budapest report on the same parade had t.titated that
 "antimissile missiles" were on display, "every one of them serving as
 an argument to prove that not even the additional billions of dollars
 invested in armaments can provide the U.S. Defense Department with
 the desired strategic superiority."
 On offensive weaponry, Grechko says routinely in PRAVDA that the
 Strategic Missile Forces "are equipped with powerful missiles with
 nuclear warheads capable of inflicting a crushing blow upon an
 aggressor in any part of the planet."  The Commander of the Strategic
 Missile Forces, Marshal Krylov, says in an interview in TRUD on

 20 February that the USSR has powerful nuclear weapons with "practically
 limitless target-destruction range"--an observation he had also made
 in a NEW TIMES article reported by TASS on the 18th.
 MOSCOW SUSTAINS LOW-KEY ATTACK ON SAFEGUARD PROGRAM
 Moscow continues to press its low-key attack on Administration plans to
 move forward with the Safeguard ABM system, focusing on U.S. domestic
 opposition.  TASS on the 24th, for example, promptly reports
 Secretary Laird's proposals for construction of a third ABM site in
 the United States, noting that Laird again came forward with "hackneyed
 assertions about the so-called 'Soviet threat."  According to TASS,
 the "American public strongly objects to the governnicnt's decision
 to expand the Safeguard system.  And really this system, in the final
 count, will devour scores of billions of dollars so much needed for
 solving acute domestic problems." An earlier dispatch on the 24th
 had cited Senator Kennedy for the observation that construction of
 Safeguard "is a senseless waste of money."
 While predictably remaining silent on the possible effect of Soviet
 missile and antimissile development on the strategic arms limitation
 talks (SALT) which will open in Vienna on 16 April, Moscow continues to
 publicize U.S. concerti over the consequences of Washington's weapons
 programs for these talks.  Thus, TASS reports on the 20th that at a
 recent press conference former Ambassador Harriman indicated that the
 United States' attempts to develop its "nuclear missile capability
 make it more difficult for Washington to reach an agreement with the
 Soviet Union for the limitation of strategic armaments."  And TASS on
 21 February, reviewing Secretary Laird's report on defense programs to
 Senate committees the previous day, concludes that "it does not tally
 with the declarative announcements by official Washington about the
 aspirations of the United States to find ways and means of limiting
 strategic nuclear missile weapons."
 Otherwise, propaganda currently devotes little attention to SALT.  TASS
 on 20 February does report an interview granted its correspondent by
 Senator Symington, who observed that the talks "provide an excellent
 opportunity to start tackling the problem on which the destiny of
 entire mankind largely depends."  TASS quotes the Senator as saying
 that "if we fail to stop the dangerous and costly race of missiles
 and nucleax armaments, history might not give us another such chance."
 He also noted, according to TASS, that the fact that the USSR and the
 United States each "can destroy the other binds us to approach the
 program of arms limitation with complete responsibility. .  .  ."
 Soviet propaganda on President Nixon's 18 February report on foreign policy
 has acknowledged his reaffirmation of intent to move ahead with the second
 phase of the Safeguard program, but Moscow has not mentioned his remarks on
 SALT.

 WARSAW  PACT
 GRECHKO ARTICLE RECAPS DETAILS ON PACT ORGANIZATION
 Marshal Grechko's armed forces day article in PRAVDA on 23 February is
 nota'hle for a brief reiteration of details on the Warsaw Pact organiza-
 tion which had been pointed out in an article by Pact Chief of Staff
 Shtemenko in RED STAR in January.  Shtemenko's article had evoked wide-
 spread comment in the West and new gestures of defiance from Bucharest.
 Included in the 23 February TASS report of the Grechko article, but
 omitted from a summary broadcast the same day in Serbo-Croatian to
 Yugoslavia, is the remark that "national armies [of the Pact members]
 have assigned detachments and units" to the joint armed forces
 "to ensure better interaction."  The Serbo-Croatian version merely
 reports the Defense Minister as "stressing the increasingly mutual
 fighting cooperation" between the Soviet and Warsaw Pact members' armies.
 Shtemenko's article had gone out of its way to emphasize the subordination
 of the "allocated" forces to the "Joint" command rather than to the
 "national" commands.  It had left the impression that such "Joint" land,
 sea, and air forces had been created at the March 1969 Pact summit
 meeting in Budapest rather than at the inception of the Warsaw Pact
 in 1955.  Such an interpretation of Shtemenko's article was branded a
 "Western canard" in a Leontyev article in the 5 February RED STAR.

 POMPIDOU  VISIT
 MOSCOW CONTRASTS U1S, "HOSTILITY" TO FRANCE, SOVIET AMITY
 Soviet propaganda surrounding French President Pompidou's visit to
 the United States contrasts alleged U.S. "hostility" toward the
 French President and French policy with the "friendship" and policy
 of rapprochement prevailing in French relations with the USSR and its
 allies.  Reports of anti-French demonstrations said to be planned
 throughout the country, particularly by "pro-Israeli" groups, get wide
 Soviet publicity.
 A Schlenovv commentary broadcast by Moscow for French listeners on the
 23d typifies Soviet media's handling of the visit.  Schlenov notes
 that France's withdrawal from NATO had an importance far beyond the
 military framework and marked the starting point for "crucial measures
 adopted by French foreign policy," the "essential" measure being the
 improvement of relations with the Soviet Union and the other socialist
 countries.  He states that U.S. attempts to change French policy have
 ranged from "successive attacks by the United States and Federal Germany
 against the franc," designed to undermine the French economy and thereby
 force France to alter its "independent foreign policy," to "gross
 interference" in French election campaigns.  Schlenov suggests that
 recently U.S. tactics have been changed, and "American propaganda speaks
 in every key" of traditional French-American friendship while in reality
 there has been "no noticeable change" in U.S. policy toward France.  The
 commentator refers to French-U.S. differences still persisting on the
 issues of a European security conference, the question of military blocs,
 a po15.:y of detente, creation of a European security system, and the
 Middle East, adding that in the latter case "pro-Israeli American
 propaganda" practically treats the French Government's sale of jets to
 Libya "as a treacherous blow inflicted on Israel."
 A 25 February Moscow domestic service report on the Pompidou visit says
 U.S. "political circles" have displayed "visible irritation for some time
 now" and at times "even open hostility" toward French foreign policy.
 It adds that while Washington publicly asserts a desire to "disperse
 the so-called distrust" and improve relations, it "is actually striving
 to obviate all hindrances and difficulties" which France's "independent
 policy" creates for the "aggressive and long-outdated foreign policy
 course" of the United States.
 Several Soviet reports call attention to the "fierce anti-French
 campaign" allegedly being waged in the United States by Congressmen,
 big business, and various Zionist organizations.  A domestic service
 report on the 22d alleges that "some political figures close to the

 White House" are urging a boycott of Pompidou'a visit and demonstrations
 as an expression of "open hostility to France" because of its~ifldupendent
 course "in all cardinal foreign policy problems."  A PRAVDA report on
 the 22d says "favorable conditions are being created for all kinds of
 provocations on the part of influential pro-Israeli circles" in the
 United States.
 A Moscow broadcast for French listeners on the 23d reassuringly quotes
 a comment by LA NATION, "w%ich is close to the French Government," as
 indicating that Pompidou's trip "does not mean a renunciation of the
 policy of rapprochement with the countries of Eastern Europe, and
 primarily with the Soviet Union."
 Moscow's only coverage of Pompidou's Press Club speech so far is a brief
 TASS report, devoid of editorial interjections, noting that the French
 President expressed deep concern about the Middle East situation and is
 seeking :formalization of the area, adding that he said Israel needs
 peace, and reporting without elaboration that he said there axe differences
 between Washington and Paris "in the approach to different questions of
 international life."

 WEST  GERMANY
 GDR MEDIA DISPLAY DOUBTS STOPH-BRANDT TALKS WILL BL FRUITFUL
 East German media have begun laying groundwork for propaganda that
 would blame Chancellor Brandt for any breakdown in the forthcoming  talks
 between Brandt and GDR Premier Stoph, in evident anticipation that the
 talks may be abortive.  NEUES DEUTSCHLAND commentaries and editorials
 draw on the whole catalog of GDR complaints against the FRG in a tone
 that has become increasingly vituperative and angry following Brandt's
 18 February message to Stoph and the 20 February announcement of
 agreement to hold low-level preparatory talks.  GDR and Soviet media
 report "complete agreement" in the opening discussions Ulbricht and
 Stoph. had with USSR Foreign Minister Gromyko, who arrived in Berlin
 for a "detailed exchange of views" on the 24th.
 Consistent with past practice, GDR media have not publicized the text
 of Brandt's 18 February letter to Stoph proposing preliminary low-level
 talks in early February, to be followed by top-level talks in March, or
 Brandt's statement "I cannot accept preconditions."  GDR media have
 also ignored the West German Chancellor's suggestion that a second
 meeting between Stoph and himself take place  3.. Bonn.  Soviet media
 have acknowledged the latter suggestion.
 GDR media concentrate primarily on charges that the Brandt government
 has been guilty of evasion, revanchism, and rejection of recognition
 for the GDR.  Stress is laid on Brandt's "failure" to respond to
 Ulbricht's earlier proposal, renewed in the 11 February Stoph letter to
 Brandt, calling for an agreement on "establishment of equal relations
 between the GDR and the FRG."  By "refusing to take up this proposal,"
 ADN reports on the 18th, Brandt "in effect is trying to evade the
 basic question of the safeguarding of peace."  An ADN commentary on the
 19th denounces Brandt for dragging out "the old text of so-called
 preconditions" and seeking to "disguise the clear facts" and to raise
 a "completely unacceptable condition, based on the old revanchist
 claim to sole representation," by demanding that the GDR renounce
 "normal relations under international law and thereby equality."  It
 also berates unnamed West German politicians for speaking of "intra-
 German relations" between the GDR and FRG, arguing that such "new
 vocabulary" cannot render palatable for the GDR "anachronistic and
 presumptuous claims" by "West German imperialism" to sole
 representation.
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND on the 24th accuses the FRG of making "maximum demands"
 for negotiations with the GDR and denies that the GDR's proposals are
 of maximum scope,  calling the GDR draft treaty proposed in December
 "only a minimum program."  The paper adds that if the Brandt government
 does not wish to grant the GDR recognition, "then one cannot take its
 promises seriously."

 SED Politburo member Paul Verner casts doubt on the feasability of a
 GDR-FRG renunciation-of-force agreement, as proposed by Brandt, in an
 18 February speech reported by ADN. Verner says such an agreement
 would be "so much worthless paper" if the FRG refused to recognize
 the territorial status quo and the GDR under international law.
 GROMYKO VISIT      GDR and Soviet media report that Gromyko came to the
 GDR on the 24th at the invitation of the GDR
 Government for "several days" of consultation to "define point policy
 for the defense of peace."  The inclusion in the Gromyko delegation of
 Soviet Foreign Ministry officials involved in Gromyko's recent talks
 with West German State Secretary Bahr appears to confirm that Gronyyko's
 main task is to inform the GDR on the state of the Soviet-FRG talks.
 Following talks with Ulbricht and Stoph on the 24th, Grromyko is
 reported on the 25th to have talked with GDR Foreign Minister Winzer
 on "intensifying" GDR-Soviet relations, "problems of international
 policy," and European security issues, according to ADN.
 East German sensitivity to West German charges that the GDR operates
 under Soviet tutelage is evident in a 21 February NEUES DEUTSCHLAND
 report.  The paper denounces as "primitive lies and mental contortions"
 a Wect German press report, "fabricated in Hamburg and disseminated in
 Bonn," to the effect that the GDR's draft treaty proposing equal
 relations between the two German states "had been formulated upon
 'Moscow's' initiative!"   NEUES DEUTSCHLAND calls this "news concoction"
 a "lie from beginning to end" and "more proof of the value of news
 eme.nating from Bonn, including DPA news."

 the 20th, says they were marked by cordiality "and frankness."  During
 the pre-invasion liberalization, in April 1968, the atmosphere of
 Zhivkov's discussions with Dubcek in Prague had been sternly described
 as one of "sincerity and comradely frankness."  Husak's visit to
 Sofia in July 1969--in the first flush of his takeover as CPCZ First
 Secretary--was the occasion for "warm and cordial" talks.
 Zhivkov appeared to vent his spleen on the Czechoslovaks in a press
 conference carried in RUDE PRAVO on the 19th, as if in revenge for the
 way he had been treated on his arrival in Czechoslovakia in April 1968.
 On that occasion the liberal Prague radio had broadcast Zhivkov's
 evasive written answers to questions submitted to him in advance
 regarding the scanty coverage given the Czechoslovak liberalization by
 Bulgarian media.  Now, Zhivkov indulged in overkill in taking his cue
 from a question by Bratislava PRAVDA chief editor Nittman on the
 "counterrevolution."  The Bulgarian leader replied that "the defeat of
 the counterrevolution in Czechoslovakia was received with great joy and
 relief by our party and our people," and "we are proud that in
 August 1968 we could, together with the other fraternal socialist
 countries, help the people of Czechoslovakia retain the positions of
 socialism and destroy the counterrevolution."  He added, for good
 measure, his conviction that in time "all honest people throughout the
 world will realize how great an act was done on 21 August 1968" for
 Czechoslovak socialism and world peace.
 Husak characteristically skirted the issue of the counterrevolution and
 the August intervention in his interview with Sofia's RABOTNICHESKO
 DELO, published on the 20th.   He merely recalled the failures of the
 "weak, rightist-inclined" post-January 1968 leadership and added that
 "everyone is aware of the critical situations" which resulted; he
 stressed his own restorative efforts as party leader since April 1969.
 On Zhivkov's visit itself, Husak expressed himself as only "very
 pleased" and noted that "we quite frankly discussed the issues."
