 LAOS:  Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma has
 adoptec~`a" flexible tone in responding to the most.
 recent Pathet~Lao proposal s. fora cease-fire and
 bombing halt.
 25X1
 ouvanna accep e  t e Communist proposal that
 negot~.ations be-held alternately in Vientiane and
 on the Plaine des Jarres.  He artfully sidestepped
 .the Communist demand that a country-wide cease-fire
 precede negotiations.  Instead the government pro-
 posed that. a limited standclown.be imposed in a 20~
 mile radius around the Plaine?  The talks themselves
 would take up the larger gLlestians of a country-wide
 cease-fire and bombing halt: and then other outstand-
 ing issues.
 The government proposal is ostensibly an effort
 to get the negotiations onto the same-track as last
 year when the. two sides came close to agreeing to a
 limited cease-fire on the Plaine.  It is doubtful
 that. the Communists will buy the scenario this year--
 particularly because much of the Plaine is presently
 in government hands--and the government was well
 aware of  this ,when it framed its  response.
 On the Plaine, Vang Pao's irregulars are con-
 tinuin,g to press forward .and are noia moving north-
 ward toward Phou Keng,,the dominant high ground
 north of the Plaine.  Other irregulars, are. conducting
 clearing operations in the Muong-Pot Valley some four
 miles east of Ban Na; the valley is thought to be a
 major North Vietnamese supply and logistic center.
 Communist forces have made probes and. harassing at-
 tacks on irregular outposts on the Plaine, but there
 is as yet no indication that a major North Vietnamese
 assault is imminent.

 COMMUNIST CHINA:  Kong Sheng, heretofore the
 fifth-ranked member of the elite politburo standing
 committee, appears to have lost all political power.
 In a recent conversation with the US ambassador
 in Bucharest concerning the visit of Romanian party
 chief Ceausescu to Peking last month, First Deputy
 Foreign Minister Macovescu declared flatly that "Kang
 no longer occupied a post."  Kang, who made his only
 public appearance since last November at a major re-
 ception held by Mao Tse-tung far Ceausescu on 3 June,
 was described by Macovescu as a sick man who had come
 out of the hospital to greet the Romanians as a cour-
 tesy.  The removal of a leader of Kong`s stature from
 his posts for health reasons simply does not accord
 with past Chinese Communist practice, and his prin-
 cipal "illness" is almost certainly political.
 During Kong's nearly seven-month absence from
 public view, several stories circulated in Peking
 that he, along with his still-missing colleague on
 the politburo standing committee, Chen Po-ta, had
 been heavily censured at the major party plenums last
 year for extremist activities during and since the
 Cultural Revolution.  In recent months, there have
 been numerous reports that a nation-wide crackdown
 on extremists is intensifying, and it appears that
 Chen Po-ta, at least, has been purged on the grounds
 that he organized the notorious "May 16 Corps"--an
 ultraleftist group which in 1967 allegedly had at-
 tempted to undermine the positions of Premier Chou
 En-lai and several of the major regional military
 commanders now on the politburo.  Although Kang was
 also linked with the "May 16 Corps," the recent
 charges against him were never specified even in
 the rumors, suggesting that the question of his
 political fate was the subject of prolonged debate.
 Even if the Romanian account of Kong's status
 is correct, it still is not clear why he appeared at
 the reception in June.  Whatever the explanation, the
 complex maneuvering within Chi:na's uneasy ruling
 coalition continues, and Kong's brief reappearance

 probably indicates that the influence of the leftist
 forces with which he has been associated has not
 waned completely, even though he has lost his per-
 sonal standing.
 Kang's political demise would mean that at
 least four full or alternate politburo members of
 varying political persuasions apparently have lost
 status since last year.  The leadership situation
 in Peking continues to be fluid, however--a point
 which was underscored last week by the extraordinary
 absence of a public display of China's top officials
 during the 50th anniversary celebration of the Chi-
 nese Communist Party.

 BURMA:  Continued military domination of the
 government seems ensured by developments at the
 government party's first congress.
 Current military and government leaders have
 been elected to all key posts in the Burma Socialist
 Program Party (BSPP), the country's only recognized
 party, which is now in the second week of its con-
 gress.  The announced purpose of the congress i.s to
 transform the BSPP from a "cadre" party into a "mass"
 organization with elected leaders.  The government
 leader, General Ne Win, has often promised to return
 power to the people, and in the future, the govern-
 ment will be theoretically responsible to the party.
 To the surprise of no one, General Ne Win was
 unanimously .elected chairman of the BSPP, and his
 heir presumptive, Brigadier Sa:n Yu, was voted gen-
 eral secretary.  Of the 200 members of the Central
 Committee, which apparently will be the highest:
 policy-making body in the government, 146 are senior
 military officers.
 The congress, which still has to complete the
 task of developing the party's substructure  is
 likel  to ad'ourn next week.

 IRAN:  Tehran has stiffened its conditions for
 stopping its increasing production of opium.
 In 1955 Iran,. bowing t:o international pressures,
 placed a complete ban on opium production.  As a re-
 sult, a thriving illicit commerce soon developed
 with Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to fill the
 large domestic demand.  To get some measure of con-
 trol over the domestic narcotic problem, the Shah
 reinstituted poppy cultivation in 1969, along with
 a strict program of addict registration and control
 of illegal traffic.  At that time, the Shah said
 that Iran would suspend poppy cultivation only when
 Turkey and Afghanistan adopted a similar ban.
 Prime Minister Hoveyda recently told US offi-
 cials that it remained Iran's policy to end poppy
 cultivation when "a11 its neighbors who were sources
 of supply" did so.
 Iran has increased its poppy crop yearly and
 expects to produce 130 tons of usable opium this
 year.  This output is barely sufficient to meet the
 needs of the country's 65,000 registered addicts.
 An additional 250 tons of opium, to supply about
 300,000 unregistered opium users, are expected to
 be smuggled in, mainly from Afghanistan.
 Meanwhile, Tehran continues its highly effective
 control over the production and distribution of the
 drug.  Registration of farmers, continuous observa-
 tion of the harvest, and guarded transport of opium
 have so far kept Iranian odium from entering the
 illicit market

 MALTA:  Prime Minister Mintoff is moving on
 severa~~iplomatic fronts at the same time.
 Mintoff, who maintained a strong anti-Italian
 position during the election campaign, has sent a
 message to Rome indicating his desire to make a new
 start in Italian-Maltese relations and suggesting
 that a special emissary be dispatched for discussions.
 25X1
 Mintoff's private secretary met with Libyan
 Prime Minister Qadhafi last week and, according to
 press reports, negotiations will begin soon on eco-
 nomic and trade relations.  Libya has also agreed
 to release the small amount of Maltese funds blocked
 in Libyan banks since the overthrow of the monarchy
 in 1969.  It is likely that Valletta will-conclude
 an economic agreement with Tripoli, but whether it
 becomes more than a symbol of Mintoff's desire for
 a neutral Malta will depend greatly on the outcome
 of the renegotiation of the defense and financial
 agreements with the UK.

 Mintoff is incensed over British. press and par-

 tegic importance and over London's delay in sending
 an-envoy to open talks.  He has threatened to -ter-

 if  a minister  is  not  sent  "without delay."
 The results of the-talks with the UK-will also
 affect Mintoff?5 attitude toward. the Soviets.  Accord-

 ITALY:  The government is taking steps to stim-
 ulate economic activity.
 Five decree laws aimed at reviving investment
 demand and production have been issued.  The new,
 wide-ranging measures, which are effective immedi-
 ately but require parliamentary approval within 60
 days, have an estimated budgetary cost of $900 mil-
 lion over the next 18 months.  Their provisions in-
 clude temporary lowering of employer social security
 contributions, particularly for smaller companies
 and. for those located in southern Italy, and addi-
 tional funding for subsidizing credit to industry
 and agriculture.  The government also plans to ac-
 celerate tax rebates on exports.  Although several
 measures will immediately improve the self-financing
 ability of industrial firms, the full impact on in-
 vestment probably-will not be felt until later this
 year and in 1972?
 The decree laws provide a badly needed stimulus
 to the economy.  Investment and consumer demand are
 sluggish and industrial output actually declined
 three percent in the first five months of this year
 compared with the same period in 1970.  Major factors.
 behind the slowdown are a squeeze on industrial prof-
 its, continued labor strife, and concern about the
 durability of the present coalition government.
 Economic growth estimates far this year. we re down-
 graded in March from an initially optimistic six-to-
 seven percent to about four percent, and the govern-
 ment is now hoping that the new measures will help
 keep economic growth from fal_linq below three per-
 cent.

 RH?DESIA-UK:  British envoys, sent last week to
 probe t e re a  Rhodesian government?s negotiating
 position, have completed their talks with officials
 in Salisbury with no indication of a break in the
 impasse.
 The British press has characterized-these meet-
 ings as a prelude to eventual ministerial-level dis-
 cussions between the two governments designed to
 reach a negotiated settlement.  Both governments,
 however, have been conspicuously silent on these.
 talks in public and private.  The joint statement
 issued on the departure of the British negotiators
 simply said that "all aspects of the problems" had
 been discussed and that it was now "necessary for
 the two sides to report-back to their respective
 governments."  Because of the Tories' election cam-
 paign promise to make a last-ditch attempt to reach
 a settlement, further meetings between the two are
 likely even if the latest round of negotiations
 proved unproductive.
 Unless one side or the other is ready to make
 substantial concessions, however, a settlement seems
 as remote as ever.  The Heath government, like its
 predecessor, is committed to a settlement based on
 the principle of eventual African majority rule in
 Rhodesia, an anathema to the white-minority govern-
 ment in Salisbury.  Even in the unlikely event that
 Heath were willing to settle for something less, he
 would face formidable obstacles including charges
 of a sell-out from African Commonwealth members and
 the Labor Party as well as the knotty problem of
 how to end UN economic sanctions.  As for the Rho-
 desians, they probably are adhering to a stand-pat
 position.  They have been hurt by economic sanctions
 but not enough to make them bend very much. ~

 UGANDA:  President Amin may be turning the
 spotligT ht on Uganda's quarrel with Tanzania in an
 effort to obscure a deteriorating domestic situa-
 tion.
 Amin, who has repeatedly charged Tanzania with
 harboring guerrilla supporters of ex-president Obote,
 has closed Uganda's border with Tanzania.  Last, week
 the government officially attributed sizable mili-
 tary losses suffered since the coup to encounters
 with guerrilla groups entering from Tanzania.  The
 losses--670 officers and men of an army of over
 10,000--are in fact more likely to be the result of
 clashes between Amin's fellow West Nilers and troops
 from other tribes.  General Amin has also placed re-
 strictions on two Tanzanian officials in the East
 African Community in retaliation for Tanzanian ac-
 tions against Ugandan representatives to the Commu-
 nity.
 Tanzania does not pose a serious threat to
 Uganda, but Amin, who has failed to solve such do-
 mestic problems as a worsening economic situation,
 a serious crime wave, and the excesses of an in-
 creasingly tribalized and unruly army, will probably
 continue to exploit the issue.

 participate in Pact exercises for several years.
 Headquarters elements of a Romanian division did
 take part in last year's "Comrades-in-Arms" maneu-
 vers in East Germany, but Bucharest has apparently
 decided against even such minimal participation
 this year.  Conflicting information on the number,
 type,  and national;~ty.,of  un~t~ .scheduled  to  take
 part in the exercise has been received from various
 East. European sources, but apparently at least So-
 viet and But arian forces wall be involved.
 BULGARIA:  Party boss `.Codor Zhivkov's elevation
 ---~--r-
 to the position of chief of state, which had been
 expected, will involve him rnore directly in foreign
 affairs and also places him at the head of the body
 that will be the dominant government institution.
 Under the new constitution, the State Council, tech-
 nically a successor to the ~>owerless Presidium of
 the National Assembly, has greater legislative and
 executive responsibility, as well as more scope for
 independent action.  The Cot~neil is similar to Ro-
 .mania's Council of State, bL1t is unlike Poland's
 State Council or Hungary's Presidential Assembly,
 both of which are little more than bolitica7 r~?~+-_
 bins.

 PHILIPPINES:  The Supreme Court has ordered a
 full   rollback  in recent price  increases  for petz-o-
 leum products.  The move, in response to a legal
 action which had the support of the Philippines
 solicitor general, is aimed at forestalling further
 strikes and antigovernment demonstrations.  The
 Supreme Court action comes as a surprise to the oil
 industry, which felt that President Marcos had given
 tacit approval for the price hike.  Earlier this
 year oil companies, mainly US awned, tried to raise
 prices with only limited success.  As a result of
 the 1970 devaluation, tariff increases, and the
 higher cost of crude oil, the Industry expects a
 serious profits squeeze unless some price adjust-
 ments are made.  The rollback may temporarily take
 some of the w?   ut of demands to nationalize the
 oil industry.
 ECUADOR:  The government as again seeking fi-
 nancial ass stance from US oil companies to ease its
 budget problems.  The Velasco administration is ask-
 ing the Texaco-Gulf consortium to guarantee a $55-
 million loan it is trying to negotiate with seven
 US banks.  In May it had requested the cansorti.um
 and  two other oil  companies  to provide  a  $15-million
 loan--an arrangement successfully used in-1969 when
 budget difficulties developed.  The consortium is
 willing, at most, to guarantee a much smaller loan
 than is now being requested by the government, and
 then only if issues concerning the government':
 financial provisions applicabl   o forthcoming pe-
 troleum exports are resolved.
