 the USSR:
 [Soviet media have begun to send out mixed
 signals on the outlook for Soviet-US relations.
 The evidence is tentative, but there are signs that
 Moscow has some qualms about continuing to
 accord detente with Washington the degree of
 prominence that has become commonplace over
 the past two years or soo
 / fA major article in Pravda on March 30,
 marking the third anniversary of the 24th party
 congress at which Brezhnev launched his "peace
 offensive," gave scant attention to US-Soviet ties.
 By contrast, last year's anniversary article placed
 considerable stress on the gains achieved in bila-
 teral relations.)
 I  IThe recent article did take brief note of the
 "extremely  important  effect"  improved  US-
 Soviet relations have had on international affairs.
 The usual references, however, to meetings at the
 summit, SALT, and recent progress in bilateral
 ties were missing.7
 I Fin addition, the allusion to the US was fol-
 lowed by a reference to the "great complexity"
 of the current international situation. This situa-
 tion, said Pravda, is marked by the continuing
 military preparations of various capitalist coun-
 tries and by their counterattacks against Mos-
 cow's efforts toward detente)
 I  ILast year's Pravda article hailed the "para-
 mount international significance" of US-Soviet
 relations and praised the results of the May 1972
 summit. It listed the major agreements concluded
 between General Secretary Brezhnev and Presi-
 dent Nixon, and it expressed optimism over
 prospects for SALT.
 Last week's Pravda article is not the only
 straw in the wind. Earlier this year, the Soviet
 Communist  Party's  theoretical  journal  Kom-
 munist gave a similarly perfunctory treatment to
 relations with Washington. Handling of this sensi-
 tive issue in the Soviet press suggests a more
 cautious attitude on Moscow's part, if not a slack-
 ening of enthusiasm on the part of some Soviet
 leaders
 IThe Soviets have already found ways to
 demonstrate their displeasure with Washington's
 expanded role in the Middle East, with the delay
 in granting the USSR most-favored-nation status
 in trade, and with US statements on nuclear tar-
 geting. These concerns, together with uncertainty
 over the political situation in the US, may have
 led the Soviets to pause and take stock of their
 own expectations with regard to detente:?
 1  This has not prevented Moscow, however,
 from trying to counter what Soviet commentators
 have called "pessimistic" press accounts of the
 outcome of Secretary Kissinger's recent visit to
 Moscow.(
 One commentator said that the Secretary's
 visit was a "new contribution" to relations and an
 "important step" toward guaranteeing the success
 of President Nixon's planned visit to the USSR.
 Taking issue with negative Western press assess-
 ments of the progress made on SALT during the
 recent Moscow talks, the commentator contended
 that mutually acceptable solutions are possible
 despite the complicated nature of the problem.
 The  Soviet  international  affairs weekly, Life
 Abroad, went even further, asserting that "an
 agreement could be worked out in time for the
 planned summit meeting."]
 fA similarly positive portrayal of the Sec-
 retary's visit was carried by Tass, which noted

 that improvement in US-Soviet ties has allowed
 tangible results in several major areas, including
 arms  control.  Refuting  allegations about the
 "tough" position Moscow adopted on SALT dur-
 ing the Secretary's visit, Tass branded these idle
 speculation.
 )An article in Izvestia took much the same
 line. It presented a more sober appraisal of the
 prospect for progress at SALT, however, pointing
 to the complicated nature of the problem and the
 alleged opposition of the Pentagon.
 There is increasing evidence that the Soviets
 have decided to cut back significantly on the
 number of Jews allowed to emigrate to Israel.
 This decision is probably related to the poor
 prospects Moscow sees for gaining most-favored-
 nation treatment from the US. During the first
 three months of 1974, Soviet Jewish emigration
 to Israel was about 22 percent less than the same
 period last year]
 \The  Soviets contend disingenuously that
 there are simply fewer Jews who now wish to
 leave the Soviet Union. According to a Moscow
 radio commentator, applications for emigration
 decreased sharply as a result of the October war
 in the Middle East, and in January of this year
 applications were less than half the number of
 January 1973. The commentator claimed that
 educated Soviet Jews do not want to give up the
 advantages of socialism and are skeptical about
 the kind of treatment they would receive in
 Israeli
 tt  it  is becoming clear, however, that the
 authorities have deliberately put new bureaucratic
 obstacles in the way of prospective emigrants.
 These procedures have included greater police
 scrutiny of the applicant, the need to submit
 character references that go back at least six
 months, qnd a requirement that application forms
 be typed.j
 I  In practice, a would-be emigrant must now
 quit his job at least six months before applying
 for emigration, since upon applying he runs the
 risk of being fired and thus receiving a poor
 Awaiting Transportation
 character reference. The requirement that applica-
 tion forms be typed is a lesser obstacle, although
 it does mean that a prospective emigrant must
 secure a permit-required of all private citizens-
 to purchase a typewriter, or find some other
 method of having the application typed./
 4   ,Such harassment has doubtless discouraged a
 great number of potential applicants but probably
 is not the only factor contributing 'to the decline
 in emigration. Despite persistent Soviet prot-
 estations that "practically any" citizen may go to
 Israel, there have recently been signs that Soviet
 authorities are simply refusing exit permits to
 large numbers of Jews even after they have
 managed to satisfy the bureaucratic requirements.
 Moscow's tougher policy can probably be
 atri uted to the trouble the USSR is having in
 getting most-favored-nation treatment from the
 US. The message seems to be that if the US
 Congress is willing to turn down trade concessions
 to Moscow by linking the issue to Soviet emi-
 gration policy, the Kremlin is prepared to reverse
 this linkage and restrict emigration until most-
 favored-nation  treatment  is  grainted.

 Egypt: Countering The Critics
 f : President Sadat appears to be growing in-
 creasingly concerned that criticism of his foreign
 and domestic policies from the Soviets and Arab
 radicals will adversely affect the willingness of
 other Arab states to continue peace negotiations?
 He has begun counter-attacking and, in a major
 policy address on April 3, lashed out at the USSR
 for being not the protector of Arab interests it
 claims to be, but instead a hindrance to the Arab
 cause!
 SSadat recited a long history of unfulfilled
 Soviet promises of aid and charged that Moscow
 had obstructed his efforts over the years to initi-
 ate hostilities by consistently attempting to limit
 his  focus  to diplomatic  rather than  military
 action. At the same time, he implied, Soviet
 tactics virtually guaranteed that diplomatic action
 would   be fruitless.  Largely  because Moscow
 sought to keep the Arabs militarily weak, the US
 gained the impression that the Arabs were ineffec-
 tive "dead bodies" too weak to bargain with or to
 deserve  diplomatic  intervention to  break the
 Arab-Israeli impasse
 0 f3y emphasizing that the Arabs would still be
 in this stagnant situation had he heeded Soviet
 opposition t:o war, Sadat was telling the other
 Arabs, particularly Syria, that Moscow is an un-
 reliable ally and that dependence on Soviet advice
 in the cyyrrent negotiations will also do the Arabs
 nogoodi
 jSadat has attempted  in recent weeks to
 back rack from the blatant criticism of Nasir by
 noting that he shares responsibility for all of
 Nasir's policies and is attempting now not to
 "destroy Nasir's legacy" but to correct the "nega-
 tives" of his predecessor's regime. This oft-re-
 peated theme---emphasized again in his speech this
 week-reflects some misgivings that Soviet crit-
 icism on the issue might strike a responsive chord
 among Egyptians, as well as other Arabs
 (g Although Sadat seems to  be somewhat
 defensive in countering Soviet propaganda on
 internal Egyptian affairs, his outspoken attack on
 Moscow's  war  and  peace policy may herald
 harsher attacks in the future on Soviet interests in
 Egyptl\The speech was preceded by an AI-Ahram
 editorial questioning the continued value of the
 Soviet-Egyptian friendship treaty and, although
 Sadat himself did not mention the treaty, he laid
 (y the groundwork for a later call for its modifica-
 tion if the close relationship with Moscow that it
 symbolizes begins to rankle still more. Such a
 move would risk Egypt's major source of military
 aid, however, and Sadat will have to approach this
 issue cautiously]
 Soviets in treating domestic matters, although
 ,,in this case his approach was more in the nature
 of a defense of his own policies than a direct
 attack on the critics of those policieslVBoth the
 7 Soviets  and  radical  Arabs  have  weighed  in
 strongly against the anti-Nasir propaganda cam-
 paign launched in Cairo newspapers two months
 ago by overzealous Sadat supporters. Moscow and
 the radical Arabs seized  on the campaign as
 indicative of a general rightward drift in Egypt,
 and Sadat is concerned about the impact of their
 charges that he is selling out both Nasir's "revolu-
 tion" and general Arab interests for the sake of
 the US and of his own domestic power position./
 `Moscow, which has not yet responded to
 Sadat's speech, announced on Wednesday that it
 is sending a new ambassador to Cairo-Vladimir
 Polyakov. Although he has less status than his
 predecessor, Polyakov is an expert in Middle East
 affairs and probably has the primary task of
 salvaging  whatever  is possible of the Soviet-
 Egyptian relationship
 (a  SSince the October war, Moscow has made
 energetic efforts to consolidate its relations with
 other Arab states----mainly Syria and Iraq-as
 alternative areas of influence. The Soviets will
 most likely, however, attempt to maintain their
 military  aid  program  in  Egypt,  where they
 undoubtedly want to protect their investment
 while waiting hopefully for the balance to again
 swing back in their favor.

 Military Tensions High
 growing sense of crisis developed on the
 Golan front this week as shelling between Israeli

 Aviv demonstrated its concern by giving wide
 publicity to its reinforcement of the front in a
 move apparently designed both to warn Damascus
 against any renewal of offensive action and to
 reassure  the  home  front  of  Israel's military
 preparedness. Late in the week, however, Israel
 reduced its level of military action, possibly to
 give the situation time to cool down, as well as to
 assess  the  effect  of  its  recent  measures on
 Damascus.,

 I ~-r [Damascus apparently believes it must main-
 tain military pressure on the Golan front to sup-
 port its negotiating aims. It may also consider
 that an aggressive posture now will blunt criticism
 of any future concessions. Israel views this as a
 military threat, however
 1,    One  result  of  the  prolonged  period  of
 grb Wing tension has been to increase the chances
 of miscalculation  by  both    sides, raising the
 possibility that a minor incident could lead to a
 major outbreak of fighting.      Both Syrian and
 Israeli forces are in positions from which they
 could attack with little or no warning, and either
 side  might  launch a pre-emptive attack if it
 believed the other were about to strike
 Negotiations Begin
 J     On the political side, the Syrian delegate to
 the Washington disengagement talks, Brigadier
 Hikmat Shihabi, is scheduled to arrive next week.!
 1   During his visit to Washington last week,
 srae i Defense Minister Dayan submitted a disen-
 gagement proposal which, according to the Israeli
 press, would leave the Israelis still in control of a
 part of the salient captured in the October war.
 This proposal, which probably represents only
 Israel's initial bargaining position, would clearly
 be unsatisfactory to the Syrians, who reportedly
 will insist that the Israelis withdraw completely
 from the salient as well as from the town of
 al-Qunaytirah, which was captured in the 1967
 war. The Syrians also want a linkage between an
 Israeli commitment to withdraw from all the oc-
 cupied territories and any immediate disengage-
 ment accord. For their part, the Israelis are in-
 sisting on the exchange of POWs prior to any
 withdrawal.]
 I (o [The Israelis are aware that their proposal is
 unacceptable to the Syrians, but they would
 apparently prefer to see the negotiations drag out
 for some months in the hope that the Syrians will
 modify their position. It is clear that for any
 disengagement to occur, both sides will have to
 modify their present positions 5ignificantly.~__

 France: Vying to Succeed Pompidou
 The first round of elections to selec
 uc-
 cesso            to President Pompidou will be held on
 April  28 or May 5-earlier than either the Gaull-
 ists or their leftist rivals would have preferred.
 Gaullist  Jacques  Chaban-Delmas and Socialist
 Francois Mitterrand are the main contenders, but
 there will be several other candidates; most will
 declare within a week.
 The Communists, Socialists, and left Radi-
 cals had hoped an election would not occur until
 at least next year. They wanted more time to
 develop an image of international statesman for
 their leader, Socialist Francois Mitterrand, 57.
 The leftist alliance also hoped for time to exploit
 popular dissatisfaction with the government's fail-
 ure to resolve the country's economic problems.
 One Socialist leader recently said, "If we believed
 in God, we would be in church lighting candles
 for Pompidou's health."
 The leaders of the leftist alliance are still not
 agreed on how to present their candidates. The
 Communists want Mitterrand to run as the sole
 leftist candidate fearing that one of their own
 would do poorly and expose the party's weak
 position. Mitterrand, however, wants his allies to
 Francois Mitterrand
 field candidates so he can run on a moderate
 platform, rather than be associated with the more
 extreme portions of the alliance program. He is
 gambling that he will win enough' votes on the
 first round to make it into the second, where he
 hopes to prevail with the additional support of
 Communist voters.
 The other main candidate, Jacques Chaban-
 Delmas, 58, is a liberal Gaullist and a former
 prime minister. At a party congres's last Novem-
 ber, his Gaullist colleagues indicated that they
 would support him as a successor to Pompidou.
 The governing coalition-Gaul lists, Independent
 Republicans, and a small centrist! group-is in
 some disarray however. One of their major prob-

 will be no exception. Uncommitted voters make
 up some 30 percent of the French electorate and
 usually determine the outcome. The French con-
 stitution provides that the Constitutional Council
 must set an election date within 20 to 35 days of
 the death of a president. Candidates must file by
 April 9 or 16. If no candidate receives an absolute
 majority on the first ballot, a second must take
 place two weeks later, with the two candidates
 who receive the most votes on the first ballot
 participating in the run-off. The law also allows
 the top candidates to withdraw in favor of one of
 the first-ballot losers. This can happen when a
 candidate is thought more likely to draw wide

 CHINA: HARD LINE EXPECTED AT UN

 IThe special session, which will deal with raw
 materials and economic development, affords
 China the opportunity again to champion efforts,

 by the developing countries to control their own
 natural resources. The Chinese may also antic-

 cuss Taiwan and other issues with US officials
 14t the session itself, the Chinese almost
 certainly will criticize the US and USSR for
 `plundering  the economic resources of the
 developing countries. The Chinese, for example,
 probably will defend the pricing policies of the oil
 producing states and seek to blame high oil rites
 on the "exploitative" nature of capitalism and on
 manipulations by the large oil companies. Because
 of leftist pressure built up during the current
 anti-Confucius, anti-Lin campaign in China, Teng
 and Chiao probably will be much more critical of
 the international activities of US  orporations
 than they have been in the recent past)
 A      Chou seems to be holding firm on other
 foreign policy issues bearing on relations with the
 West. Western businessmen have encountered few
 i delays in conducting business with the Chinese,
 and the volume of Chinese imports from the West
 continues high despite criticism in the Chinese
 media of "over-reliance" on such imports. Despite
 the fact that Chou is under pressulre-on Taiwan
 as well as other issues-there appears to be no
 alteration in the substance of Chinese forei n
 policy.
 \Increased criticism of US business would be
 in line with the more militant note Peking has
 been sounding on several foreign policy issues in
 recent weeks. Speeches by Premier Chou En-lai
 have included reminders that China, as a socialist
 country, would continue to support revolutionary
 causes, and Chou's speech at a banquet on April 1

 civilian rule in Bangkok, the first signs of restive-
 ness among the Thai military have begun to
 appear. Earlier attempts to develop a democratic
 system  of government have almost invariably
 foundered for lack of strong leadership and have

 Thanom Kiittikachorn's military regime collapsed
 last October and he was replaced by civilians,

 COMMUNISTS SEEKING OIL FOR AID
 P" (p3 -14)
 he USSR and Eastern Europe are seeking
 more oil from the Middle East as well as increased
 cooperation with the national oil companies in
 producing countries. Eastern Europe is increasing
 its  reliance on Middle Eastern oil-about one
 fourth of their imports is scheduled to come from
 Iran and the Arab producers this year.
 The USSR and Eastern Europe have pro-
 vided more than $1.4 billion of aid for the devel-
 opment of national oil industries in the less-devel-
 oped countries-almost half of which went to
 India and Iraq. Since 1969, the agreements in-
 creasingly stipulate repayment in oil. In February,
 Moscow was negotiating a contract with Iraq to
 accelerate development of the third and final
 stage of the North Rumaila oil field. This year,
 Romania extended the only new Communist aid
 for oil development-a $37 million credit for
 machinery and equipment to Argentina. More-
 over, Bucharest and Ecuador jointly announced
 plans for Romania to provide, probably on a
 commercial basis, technical services to Ecuador's
 petroleum sector.
 Although still less than 10 percent of total
 Soviet - East European aid undertakings in the
 Third World, oil development assistance in some
 countries has been a critical factor in establishing
 national oil industries. This was particularly true
 in India, where Communist assistance made pos-
 sible 50 percent of New Delhi's crude oil produc-
 tion and 60 percent of its refinery capacity. Iran's
 natural gas industry was encouraged by Soviet
 willingness to take gas, which had been largely
 burnt off in the past. Soviet-developed oil fields
 and a Czechoslovak-built refinery account for all
 of Syria's production capacity.
 The Communist countries have given aid to
 national oil industries in hopes of assuring a guar-
 anteed oil supply for Eastern Europe, but this is
 not succeeding. In January, Iraq stopped oil ship-
 ments on Soviet account after Moscow refused to
 pay $17 per barrel, the price Baghdad was de-
 manding                   from  Western  customers. Shipments
 under previous agreements apparently have re-
 sumed recently. Earlier Soviet plans to obtain as
 much as 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi oil this
 year-three times the estimated 1973 level-may
 be scaled down. It also is doubtful that the two
 parties will agree to long-term deliveries at fixed
 prices. East European countries, often agreeing to
 pay the higher prices demanded for Middle East
 oil, nevertheless also had difficulty in buying oil
 this year. Libya, however, may become an im-
 portant supplier to Eastern Europe; agreements
 signed so far this year call for a doubling of oil
 exports.
 Some less-developed countries that purchase
 Soviet oil are facing problems, in part due to
 Soviet difficulties in procuring oil from the Mid-
 dle East. Moscow notified Ghana, for example,
 that the price for Soviet crude would be raised to
 nearly $15 a barrel. In other moves, Moscow
 reportedly  reduced  its  1974 commitment to
 Morocco below the 20,000 b/d supplied last year,
 and it told Bangladesh that it will now have to
 pay hard currency for Soviet petroleum prod-

 RESTRAINING THE CONSERVATIVES

 party policy or face stern disciplinary measures.
 Some of the phrasing revives the question of
 Soviet intentions toward Yugoslavia, a rare occur-
 rence since Tito's rapprochement with Brezhnev
 hit full stride last fall'
 The warnings almost certainly reflect an
 eme   ing consensus in the leadership that conserv-
 ative elements are using Tito's drive to tighten
 party discipline as a screen for attacking their
 ideological opponents. Tito himself has cautioned
 against "witch-hunts" or other attempts to alter
 his moderate internal policies. Nevertheless, con-
 servative extremists, in boldly agitating for com-
 prehensive party controls, have recently criticized
 prominent party dons-like Vladimir Bakaric in
 Croatia-for their softness toward liberals and
 nationalists.

 ISRAEL: ON THE HOME FRONT
 Nom's+,at rF
 The partial results oche official inquiry into
 Israel's conduct of the war last October, which
 were published this week, are unlikely to mute
 the controversy surrounding the handling of the
 war  by  Prime Minister Meir's government. In
 effect, the findings clear the government of direct
 responsibility for the shortcomings uncovered in
 the investigation and place the blame squarely on
 the military.
 The  five-member  commission,  which  is
 headed by Israel's chief justice and includes two
 former chiefs of staff, chose not to deal with the
 broader question of ministerial responsibility and
 focused on the more easily defined issue of mili-
 tary accountability. Such an approach should for-
 mally get Prime Minister Meir's government off
 the hook, but it has raised a storm of controversy
 and leaves the commission open to charges of
 conducting a whitewash.
 Israeli editorials are already claiming that the
 commission report is suspiciously protective of
 Defense Minister Dayan, in particular, and are
 calling on the commission to direct more atten-
 tion to the activities of the senior political leaders
 during  October.  Predictably,  the  opposition
 Likud bloc called on the government to accept
 the  moral  and  political responsibility for the
 short-comings highlighted in the report and to
 resign. The Likud is likely to offer a motion of no
 confidence in the government when the Knesset
 meets in a special session on April 10 to hear a
 government statement on the commission's find-
 ings. The government should be able to withstand
 such a challenge.
 Chief of Staff Elazar, who quit in view of
 the report's findings, complained in his letter of
 resignation that the report was unfair in treating
 him differently from Dayan. Professional military
 men are likely to become more bitter and even
 demoralized should the commission's final report,
 expected in late April or May, absolve the govern-
 ment of direct responsibility and put the burden
 of blame on  the military establishment, This
 could touch off resignations by officers not impli-
 cated by the commission.
 THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE WAR
 FOCUSED ON MILITARY ACCOUNTA-
 BILITY RATHER  THAN MINISTERIAL
 RESPONSIBILITY.
 The report bore down particularly hard on
 the military intelligence staff, charging it with
 failing to detect Arab preparations for war and
 improperly evaluating available information. It
 recommended the removal of intelligence chief
 Zeira and several other senior military intelligence
 officers, including Zeira's deputy for estimates.
 Meanwhile, Mrs. Meir's cabinet avoided an-
 other potential crisis when the Notional Religious
 Party's central committee, in a stormy session,
 voted to endorse the party leadership's earlier
 decision to join Mrs. Meir's coal',ition. The vote
 failed to head off the resignation of Social Wel-
 fare Minister Hazani, who held one of three cabi-
 net posts allotted to the party. Hazani said his
 action was motivated by the difficulty he had in
 reconciling the party's decision to stay in the
 government with contrary advice from Israel's
 Chief Rabbinate. Hazani, however, assured Mrs.
 Meir of his continued support in the Knesset.
 The National  Religious Party  remains di-
 vided over the question of participation in the
 cabinet without having first obtalined legislation
 revising the Law of Return to apply only to
 orthodox  Jewish   immigrant converts.  Despite
 these  strains,  the  party's  other  two cabinet
 members-Interior Minister Burgl and Religious
 Affairs Minister Raphael-apparen',tly will stay on.
 The  party  will  not    immediately  name a re-
 placement for Hazani, presumably as a gesture to
 its more conservative wing.

 f  The coalition government of Prime Minister
 Bulent Ecevit, in office since February, is pushing
 controversial  political-amnesty legislation and
 considering  lifting the ban on cultivation of
 opium poppies. In tackling these issues, it has met
 behind-the-scenes pressure from conservative mili-
 tary officers, who are wary of both coalition
 parties and determined to prevent any deviation
 from what they consider Turkey's national in-
 terests./
 1'1- I
 A general amnesty-particularly for "crimes
 of t ought -was an important issue in the elec-
 tion last fall for Ecevit's left-of-center Republican
 Peoples Party, the dominant partner in the gov-
 ernment coalition. Senior officers, however,
 object to provisions in the government's bill that
 would include in the amnesty those charged with
 disseminating communist propaganda and with
 advocating violent overthrow of the government.
 `J Military leaders have rallied their supporters
 in parliament and believe the provisions they
 oppose, which have been attacked by the opposi-
 tion parties,, will be removed. The controversial
 provisions are also disliked by fervently anti-com-
 munist deputies of the Islam-oriented National
 Salvation  Party,  the junior coalition partner,
 although they have reportedly agreed to vote for
 the bill.)
 IThe army has also made its weight felt on
 the opium poppy question. The opposition of
 most officers to ending the ban on cultivation, a
 move advocated by both coalition parties during
 the  election  campaign,  was  probably  partly
 responsible for the government's postponement
 of a decision on the issue until the end of July.
 The army does not want to complicate relations
 with Washington, lest it jeopardize US military
 aid. The ban has been unpopular, however, among
 peasants in the poppy-growing areas, who are
 being courted by the opposition parties in antic-
 ipation of a possible breakdown of the present
 coalition and early elections. The planting of
 poppies for seed was resumed on state farms last
 month to ensure adequate seed stocks for a
 normal fall planting.
 I Military pressures on Ecevit's government
 raise the specter of the March 1971 "coup by
 memorandum" in which the army forced the
 resignation of the Justice Party government, led
 by Suleyman Demirel, and brought about a two-
 and-a-half year period of rule by military-backed
 "above party" cabinets. Although the key officers
 who signed that memorandum have now been
 retired and the army displayed considerable
 patience during the three-month crisis that pre-
 ceded the formation of the present government, it
 clearly has not given up its role as watchdog.
 Ecevit reportedly hopes to retire most of the
 remaining senior officers who supported the 1971
 coup. He will have until August-the customary
 time for retirements -to generate enough support
 within the military to ensure that there will be no
 adverse reactions.

 Africa, especially at the expense of the Chinese,

 concerned about maintaining stability in the area,
 however, and have cautioned the Somalis, for
 example, about pressing their irredentist claims
 against  Kenya  and  Ethiopia.  Moreover,  it is
 unlikely that the additional Soviet arms will give
 any recipient a significant military advantage over
 its neighbors. Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda do
 not now have the capability to utilize effectively
 the equipment currently in their inventories, and
 the introduction of more sophisticated equipment
 will only complicate matters.

 Although Peruvian revanchism is the strong-
 est factor tending to raise tensions between the
 two countries., ideology may also have been play-
 ing a role since the conservative military regime
 took power in Chile.
 Recent Peruvian military moves that have

 instructors in January, and the announcement last
 month that the army's armored school will be

 and  on  order.
 Partly in response to Peru's military pur-

 corps. A high-level military procurement team is
 touring West Germany, France, and the US in
 search of tanks to replace outdated US models,
 thus far without success. In the face of turndowns
 j6y both Paris and Bonn, the team is expected to
 press Washington for the tanks, as well as for
 TOW anti-tank missiles and self-propelled artil-

 recent press reports raising the specter of Peruvian
 aggression, possibly with Soviet involvement, will
 further isolate the regime from its Latin American
 neighbors. Lima is sensitive to the fact that Velas-
 co's government stands out as the most radical in
 South America, and it apparently does not want
 to offend further its more conservative neighbors,
 especially Brazil. In addition, Velasco appears to
 be interested in bettering Peru's relations with
 Washington, a policy likely to be made more
 difficult by reports and rumors that Lima has
 aggressive plans. Nevertheless, mutual suspicion
 and hostility are likely to grow. The prospect,
 therefore, is for a continuing arms buildup on
 both sides, concurrent with Peruvian efforts to
 quiet the hysteria through political  and dip-

 VENEZUELA: NEW DIRECTIONS
 113-111
 Venezuela's new g    nment,  c cumulating
 massive financial resources as a result of high oil
 prices, is beginning to chart new directions in
 economic policy. Caracas has adopted a cautious
 approach, however, and is emphasizing careful
 preparation before spelling out specific courses of
 action.
 In his first major step to fulfill his promise
 to nationalize the oil industry, President Perez has
 named a study commission to analyze alternative
 approaches.  The  commission,  headed by the
 minister of mines and hydrocarbons, is to report
 to the President within six months. Congressional
 action on nationalization is likely to be taken by
 the end of this year.
 In a second major decree, Perez has ap-
 proved a 90-day freeze on prices of goods and
 services to give the government time to work out
 a general plan for wages, prices, and employment.
 The government also has ordered a study to lay
 the groundwork for a unified national planning
 effort and has named a commission to study
 reform of public administration.
 Minister of Mines Hernandez
 At current oil prices, Venezuela's revenues
 could rise by over $7 billion this year, an increase
 of about 200 percent over last year. The gain may
 not be so high because of signs that world oil
 prices are softening; nevertheless the quantum
 jump in revenue will permit the government to
 undertakesignificant investments ;in support of its
 commitment to rapid economic development.
 Perez has stated that investment will be directed
 toward areas of high productivity, with emphasis
 on diversifying exports; industries specifically
 mentioned are petrochemicals and steel.
 There are limits, however, to the extent that
 government spending can be stepped up. Even
 with a planned increase in exp nditures of 20
 percent this year, there could be  surplus of over
 $6 billion. The government is preparing legislation
 to establish a fund that would use half of the
 surplus for foreign investment; several US banks
 have  been  consulting  Caracas  about  such
 possibilities.
 Other excess oil revenue would be used to
 finance  international  projects,  particularly in
 Latin America, through multilater4al organizations
 including the Inter-American Development Bank,
 the Caribbean Development Bank, the Central
 American Bank, and the Andean Development
 Corporation. Caracas also intends to help de-
 veloping countries import Venezuelan oil at cur-
 rent prices. Caracas has stated that its further
 objectives are to increase the export capacity of
 developing countries and to act as a catalyst for
 multinational projects, in order to 'Contribute to a
 global redistribution of income.
 Concern about growing inflationary pres-
 sures motivated the decision to impose a price
 freeze. Even in the first nine months of 1973-
 before the sharpest oil price increases-the general
 price index rose 8.7 percent, compared with 3.5
 percent in 1972. Domestic price increases last
 year reflected higher prices for imports and the
 effects of a poor agricultural crop, in addition to
 increased demand. Expanded government expend-
 itures this  ear will add to domestic inflationary
 pressu res.

 Even though Delfim is widely acknowledged

 labor groups apparently are having little success in
 their efforts to unseat the governors, and Peron
 may be counseling a go-slow approach, especially
 if he believes popular support for removal of the
 elected officials is lacking.l
 11 Meanwhile, the federal take-over of Cordoba
 has left deep scars, and the political situation in
 this key industrial city continues to be shaky. The
 administrator  sent  out  by  Buenos Aires has
 alienated  both  right- and left-wing Peronists,
 thereby complicating his task of pacifying the
 turbulent  Cordobans.    The  thorny  dispute  is
 aggravated by the hostility of the provincial con-
 11 jress to federal intervention. Adding to the dif-
 ficulties, university students have occupied offices
 at the University of Cordoba to protest the
 naming of a new rector by federal authorities
 Unless the sharp differences among feuding
 government officials, labor unions, and student
 groups are resolved, the current balancing act will
 prove to be little more than a palliative. There are
 signs that tempers are rising on all sides, in-
 creasing the likelihood that further violent clashes
 will  b    rovoked b  extremists.
