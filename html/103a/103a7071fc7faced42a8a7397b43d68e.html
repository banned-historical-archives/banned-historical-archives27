 THE problem of unemployment examined in this pamphlet is
 one of vital interest at the present day.
 The number of unemployed in the capitalist countries is not
 only very high, but is tending to increase. The table below, com-
 piled from government statistics eloquently demonstrates this:--

 There are, however, countries where there is no longer any
 question of unemployment, since this has been abolished by virtue
 of the fact that the causes of unemployment have themselves been
 abolished.
 In these countries, the right to work is assured, not merely
 in the text of the Constitution, but in actuality, in real life.
 Unemployment, which is a consequence of the economic
 organisation of the countries in which it is rife, develops through
 the impoverishment of the working masses, the inadequacy of their
 * France. There, are no official statistics in France relating to unemploy-
 ment as a whole; certain categories of unemployed being considered
 merely " assisted persons."  Inquiries made by " poll " methods have,
 however, established that the number of totally unemployed has risen
 ,by at least 20(.000,-and that of partially unemployed by more than
 500,000.

 purchasing power, the too high prices of products and articles of
 common consumption, and the obstacles impeding normal com-
 mercial trading with all countries. It is at present becoming fur-
 ther increased and heightened in these countries under the weight
 of the armaments burden.
 A considerable portion of the national income is absorbed by
 increased armament expenditure, and this also acts to the detriment
 of production for the civilian sector of the economy
 The grievous consequences of unemployment are felt in the
 first place by those out of work, but they do not spare certain other
 social strata, in particular small trades-people, peasants and evert
 the owners of numerous small and medium undertakings.
 The big industrialists and trusts strive to profit from uneniploy-
 ment crises by suppressing numbers of small and medium
 undertakings in order to remain in control of the market and in
 this way to augment still further their excessive profits.
 The trade union organisations can certainly not permit them-
 selves to be satisfied with establishing the facts, without at the
 same time acting with the necessary energy to fight against
 unemployment and the causes which give rise to it.
 They struggle against this social curse of unemployment and
 against the bankruptcy of capitalist society which has proved itself
 incapable of ensuring work to millions of able-bodied men and
 women, who have no other means of existence apart from their
 wages.
 Those trade union organisations catering for workers in
 industries severely affected by unemployment put the struggle
 against unemployment in the forefront of their responsibilities.
 The interchange of experiences of these struggles, which will
 take place at the time of the International Conference on Social
 Security, which will he held in Vienna in early March, 1953, will
 make it possible to  improve the methods of dealing with
 unemployment.
 At the same time as the trade union organisations tight against
 unemployment, they also undertake the defence of the claims of
 the totally and partially unemployed.
 IN THIS FIELD IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
 THAT THE RISK OF UNEMPLOYMENT SHOULD BE
 COVERED BY SOCIAL SECURITY.
 In those countries where the workers are still without the
 benefit of Social Security, the trade union organisations should
 not fail to introduce into their programmes the necessary demand
 that the risk of unemployment be covered by Social Security.
 It is necessary to start with the principle that every wage-
 earner, without consideration of his profession, family status or
 age, from the moment when he is deprived of his wages through
 unemployment. must be able to draw benefits, without any restric-

 tion, in the form of unemployment pay-commencing with the day
 when he loses his employment, and without any time limit.
 Agricultural workers, who very often suffer unemployment,
 must have the same right as industrial workers to receive unemploy-
 ment benefit without any restrictions.
 In matters regarding the scale of unemployment benefit, it is
 necessary, in our opinion, to make this the concern of the trade
 union organisations in each country.  By taking into account the
 actual detailed situation in their own countries, they will be in a
 better position to determine the scale.                 -
 The condition of the partially unemployed should also be kept
 in sight by the trade unions.  We are at present witnessing the
 development of partial unemployment in the capitalist countries.
 There is no need to stress that workers receiving a reduced
 salary are exposed to want and privations, since even those who
 work a full week experience difficulties in satisfying their own
 needs and those of their families, in view of tHe gap which exists
 between wages and the cost of living.
 All these questions, bound up with the grave problem of
 unemployment, will be examined, discussed and clarified in the
 course of the work of the International Conference on Social
 Security.
 This pamphlet has for its aim simply to make a contribution
 to the discussion of these problems and to assist the trade unions
 in finding solutions which will enable millions of partially and
 totally unemployed to receive full employment, and provide a
 decent unemployment benefit to those who remain "unemployed
 in spite of themselves."
 These discussions, like the campaign itself, will be carried out
 in the spirit of the broadest possible working class unity, which
 we must constantly promote in the interests of all workers.

 President of the International
 Union of Fur and Leather Workers.

 HOW TO DEAL WITH
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 IN the capitalist countries, the forms in which insurance against;
 unemployment exists and their range are extremely varied,
 extending from the complete absence of any system, or of systems
 extremely restricted in respect of the numbers of people affected
 and of the value of the benefits allowed. This makes it particularly
 difficult to formulate the basic characteristics of unemployment
 insurance.
 The fundamental reasons fcr these profound differences are
 of course to be found in the variety of the concrete economic
 conditions. the way these have developed and the resultant rela-
 tion of class forces.  There is thus a direct relation between, on
 the one hand, the various situations of the market and the struggle
 waged by the working class in order to protect itself against
 unemployment. and on the other hand, the concrete system
 brought into being.  In general, there exists more extensive
 insurance in countries with an advanced economic development
 and where the working class has emphasised the problem in the
 course of its struggles.  In countries where, by reason of a
 retarded  economic  development,  unemployment  has  become
 inherent in the system, and is growing, the systems in existence are
 generally restricted. In these cases their extension presents basic
 problems, whose solution in terms of precautionary measures is
 possible on condition that this is organised on a much broader
 basis.
 Before entering on an analysis of the characteristics assumed
 by social precautions against unemployment in the various
 countries, it would be well to examine briefly the effects of
 insurance of this kind.
 The Effects of Unemployment Benefit
 WHATEVER may be its forms and financial requirements,'
 unemployment benefit entails a certain amount of expen-
 diture.  It is essential that a part of the national income, without
 consideration of the means by which it is to be set aside, should
 be devoted to allowances for the unemployed.  As long as this,
 levy had to be supported exclusively by the persons concerned, as
 was the case in the former Workers' Mutual Aid Societies, and as

 Western Germany.  The despair of the unemployed-who will give my
 father work?

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 was the general rule in all the voluntary mutual aid funds. this
 protection expressed itself in the redistribution of a portion of the
 income of the working class within the limits of the working class
 itself, without profits or interest being at all affected. But in pro-
 portion as the struggle of the workers developed, the employers
 were compelled to assume, in whole or in part, .whether directly
 ,by contributions or indirectly by taxation, the financial burden of
 unemployment insurance. (In the capitalist countries the costs at
 the moment are generally speaking shared between the workers
 and the employers, with or without state participation.  In some
 countries, however, e.g., Italy, the workers have 'succeeded in
 making the employers bear the entire burden of insurance.)
 Insurance of this kind deals a blow at profits by bringing
 about an increase in the price of labour without a proportionate
 increase in the output or price of the goods produced.
 It is thus entirely understandable that the employers have
 attempted and are still atempting by every means to avoid the
 application of this sort of insurance, or to apply it only in so far
 .as they are compelled to do so.
 On the other hand, the fact must be taken into consideration
 that in numerous markets controlled by monopolies, the most
 powerful groups of employers, that is those who dominate the big
 factories, have succeeded in transferring to prices, and in conse-
 quence to the consumers, at least a part of the increase in the costs
 of production resulting from the system of unemployment insurance,
 and in this way diminishing the effect of the latter on their profits.
 Another consequence of unemployment insurance makes itself
 felt in the development of capitalist production. We well under-
 stand the reasons why this cannot function without a certain mass
 of unemployed workers, who in offering their labour power, cause
 its price to be lowered and thus keep down the wages of the
 employed personnel to a level consistentwith high profits. In fact,
 capitalism keeps down the wages by playing off the unemployed
 against those in employment. But in order that this stabilisation
 and even reduction of wages can be put into practice, it is necessary
 that the unemployed person should have no other sources of income
 than his labour power, which he is not in a position to utilise.
 That is to say, he is held in a vice by his own needs and those of
 his family.
 Now the application of social insurance schemes includes
 economic benefits which allow the unemployed person a certain
 purchasing power and have the effect of strengthening his resistance
 and making it possible for him to refuse to sell his labour power
 below its value. If, for example, the benefits represent 60% of the
 average wage and allow the unemployed person to obtain for him-
 self at least a minimum subsistence, then he will not only not accept
 a wage inferior to the benefits, he is receiving already, but since
 his livelihood is ensured, he will be able to offer resistance and to
 fight to obtain the same treatment as the employed workers. The

 ''effect on the level of wages of the existence of a mass of un-
 ,employed is reduced in proportion as social insurance is more
 effective. Thus, the latter does not merely attack the profits of the
 employers, like the other forms of social insurance, but at the same
 'time represents a significant check to the continuance of a low. level
 .,of wages, and so is a favourable condition for the raising of this
 level. It is only when one considers this double effect-on profits
 and on the level of wages (these last constituting in effect an indirect
 `attack on profits)-that the strength of the employers' resistance
 is explained, resistance of such a kind that this form of social
 insurance is non-existent in many countries, or else is restricted to
 those categories of workers who have succeeded in obtaining it in
 :the course of their. struggles.
 In certain states social legislation does not in any way provide
 for unemployment insurance.  This is the case in a large number
 of semi-colonial countries-Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, etc.-where
 production relations are still semi-feudal.  These countries are,
 for the most part, openly exploited by foreign imperialism, and
 have an excessive labour force with a very low standard of living.
 The same conditions prevail in the majority of technically back-
 ward countries which have reached a certain level of industrial
 . development, usually financed by foreign capital, but where the
 local labour force is relatively poor.  In these countries the
 .employers do their best to keep wages down in order to guarantee
 .high profits.  Such conditions exist in the majority of Latin-
 American countries.
 In Portugal, social unemployment protection still assumes the
 form of charitable aid, reminiscent of the " Poor Law " of Queen
 Elizabeth, or the " Institution " of the Papal States in force up to
 1860-70.  Even in those developed capitalist countries where un-
 employment is not a permanent feature and is only very limited-
 during periods of less prosperity-and where the wage level is
 fairly high, there are no compulsory forms of insurance against
 unemployment.  This is left to voluntary mutual organisations,
 which are administered for the most part by the trade unions,
 with some financial assistance on the part of the State.  Sweden
 and Finland are typical examples of this position.
 As to the countries where compulsory unemployment insurance
 systems are in force, a comparison of the numbers of people
 covered with those of the health insurance systems shows that the
 first usually embraces a very much smaller number of workers than
 the second.  This demonstrates that social insurance against un-
 employment in the capitalist countries assumes a more restricted
 form than health insurance.
 The Extension of Unemployment Protection
 IN examining the achievements in the capitalist countries, we can
 establish at once that the almost universal application of rigid
 qualifications in the regulation of social insurance against unem-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 4 i`gnt~ is a common characteristic of these countries, despite the
 8iffefent economic conditions.
 We must first of all explain what we understand by a system
 ~goyerned by insurance qualifications." Such a system of social
 insurance exists when the right to receive appropriate benefits is
 0 (granted to an individual in his capacity as a member of the
 lronfinunity, or as possessing some particular quality, for example,
 in being. a worker but when this right proceeds from the fact of his
 having made the appropriate contribution to the insurance funds,
 tf:&e of his having been employed in an approved field of activity.
 An" Insurance system of this kind, even though compulsory, retains
 A, the characteristics of private insurance, since the right to
 benefit is not an automatic right, but proceeds merely from the
 fact of having contributed to the finances of the social insurance
 system itself.
 I:t is necessary to stress that the application of such criteria
 iA not made only in countries where there is large-scale, permanent
 unemployment, but also in countries of less unemployment. Now
 if in the cases where there is large-scale, permanent unemployment,
 complete social protection for the whole working class presents
 financial probbeins;''such difficulties can certainly not be used to
 justify the existence of protection based on an insurance system
 (wmetimes extremely restricted), where unemployment is not
 permanent and where its extent is comparatively limited.
 Of all the capitalist countries, only Australia and New Zealand
 have instituted social security systems protecting the entire work-
 ing. population, without exception, against the risk of unemploy-
 ment, and guaranteeing benefits regulated by the sole condition
 that the applicant should have reached working age and should be
 in, need of support.
 It is nevertheless clear that a system based on insurance,
 however broad this may be, not only fails for technical reasons to
 Fgrrespond to the requirements arising from permanent unemploy-
 ment, but is further only able to ensure incomplete and imperfect
 protection in situations of temporary unemployment.
 The existence of a system based on the insurance principle
 arises. from a denial of the right of the entire working class to
 social, protection against unemployment.  In other words, in main-
 taimng these qualifications it is possible to limit the right to draw
 f epefits, by excluding this or that category of workers, or this or
 tlfa;;~ector of the-economy. Thus, what should be the right of the
 c ire.. working class is allowed only to certain categories of
 % ork`er$~-those to whom it is impossible to refuse benefit.
 The extent of the existing systems with regard to the number
 f people covered varies very much from one country to the other
 sC >4-s may ~e summed up as follows :

 professional category to which they belong. Such. systems: arc
 extremely few in number, and exist' only in " Great Britain
 and in 16 Swiss cantons.
 (b) Systems protecting the majority of employed workers;
 but excluding certain categories in receipt of an income above
 or below an established level; or else workers who are able
 to rely on relatively stable employment; or again workers,
 occupied in certain fields of the economy, domestic workers,
 or seasonal workers, or those engaged for short perit s, or
 finally workers employed in small undertakings. The most'
 frequent exceptions relate to one or other of the following
 categories: employees of public services, agricultural,'domestic
 and seasonal workers and craftsmen.
 (c) Systems protecting only certain trades, generally
 covering workers in large-scale industry.  The difference
 between these sytsems and those of group (b) is an essentially
 quantitative one, and consists in the number of workers
 excluded from participation.
 The most common systems are those of the two last categories.
 Such a classification is, however, hardly a complete one.  For
 example, in the United States, side by side with the federal laws
 (in force for the whole country), providing for, compulsory insurance
 of workers in certain sectors of the economy, there are local laws
 as well covering categories which vary from one State to another:
 In Switzerland, a system insuring, all employed workers is in force
 in 16 cantons, whereas in the other 6, such provision either does
 not exist, or functions only on a voluntary basis.  In countries
 having entirely voluntary schemes, it is evident that these are
 .Limited to the most easily organisable sectors of industry, and thus
 exclude not only workers in various branches of the economy, but
 also all workers in small-scale industry and in more scattered
 sectors of production.
 The systems in force vary considerably from one country "to'
 another and range from the absence of any sort of protection right
 up to, in some rare cases, the protection of the entire working
 population-with the most diverse intermediate stages. The extent
 of the system naturally depends on economic conditions and on the
 struggles of the workers.  Thus, for example,,in certain countries,
 where there is only a certain amount of scattered unemployment,
 the lack of protection may be explained by the fact that unemploy-'
 ment has only a minor and local significance.  In case of a
 temporary worsening provisional help is ,provided which eases, the'
 pressure thus enabling the problem to' be. dealt with as,soon as the
 crisis" stage is past.
 We can find indirect confirmation of this analysis in st~}dyin
 which categories of workers are most frequently excluded from the.
 right to unemployment protection in the capitalist. countries. . These.
 are, in effect, the weakest and poorest groups ,who And it partied
 fatly difficult to organise any fight by reason of the,niture cif their

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 work, in which there is no concentration of workers.  Such are
 agricultural workers, seasonal and domestic workers, and in certain
 cases workers engaged in small undertakings or handicrafts, or
 workers receiving wages below a certain minimum level.  It is
 evident that exclusions of this kind are not made by reason of the
 absence of unemployment risk, or the absence of economic need-
 which is the fundamental reason for bringing about the adoption
 of some form of social protection against unemployment.  In fact
 it is probable that these categories of workers suffer on the average
 more frequently from unemployment and that their economic
 situation is in general worse.  These exclusions are actually due
 to the fact that, arising from the low degree of organisation of
 these workers, the employers, by not including them in the system,
 are able to secure considerable economies.  Thus they have also
 at their disposal a body of unemployed not receiving any compen-
 sation, and tending by their unlimited competition on the labour
 market to exercise a downward pressure on wages.
 A rapid examination of the laws in force in countries posses-
 sing some kind of protection allows us to form a sufficiently clear
 idea of the kind of exclusion carried out in respect to employed
 workers.
 There is no exclusion in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain
 and the  16 Swiss cantons, which have introduced a system
 embracing all employed workers.  In the countries where there is
 only inconsiderable and temporary unemployment, as for example
 Austria, Norway and Holland, there are fairly considerable
 exceptions. In Norway, for example, not only employees in public
 .services, but also fishermen, domestic workers and all those earning
 less than 600 crowns a year are, in practice, excluded from
 insurance.  This, moreover, holds good for all workers without
 permanent occupation, that is to say precisely those who have the
 greatest need of benefits in order to make up their insufficient
 income.  In Austria, public officials and employees, agricultural
 workers, foresters and domestic staffs are not included in the
 insurance.  In the Netherlands, insurance covers all employed
 workers, with the exception of domestic workers with an income
 lower than 6,000 florins a year.  In France, a country possessing
 one of the most inclusive systems, since it embraces not only
 employed workers, but also-which exists in no other country not
 possessing a social security system for all workers-writers, artists
 and young people in search of their first employment, seasonal
 workers are nevertheless left without protection.
 Countries with more unemployment, like Belgium and the
 United States, have unemployment insurance systems with very
 serious exclusions.  In Belgium, apprentices, domestic workers
 and workers in public services are not included in the system.  In
 addition there are certain restrictions for agricultural workers. In
 The United States, a highly developed country where unemploy-
 ment, already high enough in normal times, reaches terrifying
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 proportions in periods of crisis, the following categories are in
 practice excluded from every kind of protection by either federal
 or state legislation : all workers in the federal or local public
 services, agricultural workers, domestic workers, and all those
 working in concerns which have too few workers to come under
 the unemployment laws. Thus, in effect, unemployment protection
 covers only workers in large-scale industry.
 In countries where there is considerable inherent unemploy-
 ment there are also very restrictive systems in being.  In Western
 Germany, although there is no system of protection on. a national
 scale, but only local systems, the exclusion of agricultural workers,
 of domestic and seasonal workers can be considered an accom-
 plished fact for the whole country.  In Italy, agricultural and
 seasonal workers. workers in public services. and those not having
 continuous employment are excluded, as well as all part-time
 workers.
 It is appropriate to make some observations on the technical
 difficulties which it is claimed are involved in establishing protec-
 tion against unemployment in agriculture and in general in seasonal
 and non-permanent occupations. and which the ruling class makes
 use of as a pretext to justify its failure to meet its obligations.
 When it is a matter of unemployment or of being temporarily
 out of employment (as we shall see, these are two quite different
 problems). the solutionl is particularly easy to find.  It is evident
 that it is a question rather of insuring the workers against a future,.
 uncertain risk. by guaranteeing a certain income for the period
 already known in advance, during which these workers, for reasons
 independent of their will, are unable to work at their usual trade,
 or in any other job. since there is an absence of demand.  It is
 thus a matter of guaranteeing a yearly reserve of income, whose
 size should be related to the duration of employment in the given
 sector, and also to the possibility possessed by the particular
 economies to utilise the man-power available during the "off-
 in " in other sectors.  The matter is therefore far from being
 without a solution.  In confirmation of this, it is sufficient to cite
 the fact that this problem has been concretely solved in numerous
 capitalist countries without the emergence of any of the difficulties
 warned against.
 Necessari Conditions for the Right to Benefits
 AS we have already said, an insurance system does not guarantee,
 even in the best examples. anything but incomplete and defec-
 tive protection.  In reality, the first and principal effect of such
 systems is to exclude from the right to benefit a fairly considerable
 section of the workers, even those included in the system. since
 one must satisfy conditions of contribution or employment quali-
 fication before acquiring the right to benefits.  The worker must-
 in order to be able to claim compensation. be in a position to prove

 Workers queueing up for work at Labour Exchanges.  Although factories
 engaged on rearmament are employing more workers, war preparations
 have produced mass dismissals in the consumer goods industries.  The
 United States television industry has dismissed 10,000 workers in recent
 weeks.
 a certain sung of contributions, or a certain period of employment
 during a prescribed period preceding the unemployment.         Since
 no contributions can be paid if the worker is not occupied in a
 branch of industry where insurance is obligatory, the right to
 benefits is made dependent on the work recently performed. There
 can be no question that within the framework of capitalist economy,
 the establishment of such qualifications is unjustifiable, since the
 possibility of obtaining work does not depend only on the will of
 the worker. Under such conditions, all young people in search of
 their first jobs are automatically excluded from the right to benefits,
 even in cases where this is not stipulated by law.
 Among the existing systems of unemployment protection-
 without speaking of Australia and New Zealand, where this protec-
 tion covers the entire working population without any other
 consideration than economic need-the French system is the only
 one to admit young people seeking their first employment to the
 right to claim compensation, if they are less than 17 years old.
 providing that there exists an unemployment fund and have com-
 pleted their studies more than a year before, and are registered
 with an official employment bureau.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 The significance of the exclusion of young people in countries
 with permanent unemployment, is absolutely clear.  An increasing
 number of workers will be unable to find work, will be left without
 resources, and will exert pressure on the labour market, thus
 lowering the standard of living of the mass of the working class.
 In countries where unemployment is only temporary, absorption
 into production of new contingents of man-power never follows at
 once.  Moreover, the process of absorption may be considerably
 slowed down by the effects of a crisis which throws young people
 out of work.  They are not absorbed into production until
 .economic recovery begins to make itself felt.  Thus, even in
 countries which normally make use of their new sources of power,
 young workers may remain without work for a considerable time-
 without having the right to claim benefit.
 The fact that such conditions as the payment of contributions
 or a time qualification are exacted, excludes from the right to
 benefits all those who for one reason or another have not been in
 a position to fulfil the necessary conditions before becoming
 unemployed.  The extent of these exclusions depends naturally on
 the conditions exacted and the situation in the labour market of
 the country concerned.
 These conditions, although varying considerably from country
 to country, all display a tendency to exclude the greatest possible
 number of the unemployed.  In order to have the right to claim
 benefit, it is necessary in Great Britain to have paid contributions
 for 26 weeks.  In Norway, 45 insurance weeks over the 4 years
 preceding the unemployment are demanded, and in Austria, 20
 insurance weeks during the course of the year preceding the
 ompensation claim.  In the Netherlands, 156 working days during
 the foregoing year are required.  In Belgium 6 months of work
 over the last 10 months preceding the benefit claim are necessary
 in sectors where insurance is compulsory, while in Italy a worker
 must have been insured for at least 2 years, of which I year at
 least must have been during the past 2 years.
 Duration of Benefits
 A system based on the principle of insurance is incapable of
 guaranteeing benefits for the entire period of unemployment,
 even in cases of temporary unemployment, and above all when
 unemployment is increasing as a result of a cyclical crisis.  Since
 this kind of system is the most widespread, it follows that in the
 capitalist countries social protection is, in the majority of cases,
 limited in respect of its duration.  The only exceptions are
 Australia and New Zealand, which have instituted a social security
 organisation, and also France and Belgium, whose legislation takes
 no account of time limits for the receipt of benefit.
 In certain cases, the limitation of the duration is uniformly
 applied to all insured persons.  In others an extension (equally
 limited) is only granted if the contributions of the person insured

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 exceed the required minimum by a fixed amount. In others again,
 the duration of benefit is made dependent on qualifications in time
 (for example, 1  week of benefit for 2, 3, or 4 weeks of
 contributions).
 In Great Britain, for example, benefits are granted for a
 period of-180 days,, which is extended to one year, if the insured
 person has paid at least 50 contributions during the year preceding
 his last benefit claim.  After the expiration of the benefit period,
 the unemployed person must, in order to be able to receive com-
 pensation again, be able to show a credit of 13 other weekly
 contributions.  In Austria, benefits are granted for a period of 12
 weeks, if contributions have been paid over at least 20 weeks;
 for 20 weeks, if 30 weekly contributions have been lodged in the
 course of the 2 years preceding the demand; for 30 weeks, if
 during the course of the 5 years preceding the demand, contri-
 butions have been paid for 30 weeks at the minimum.  In Italy,
 the duration of benefit is for 180 days, without regard to the time
 over which contributions have been lodged. In the Union of South
 Africa, one week of benefit is granted for 4 weeks of contributions,
 in Norway one week of benefits for 3 contribution weeks, with a
 maximum of 15 weeks of compensation annually.  In the Nether-
 lands, unemployed people have the right to 48 days of compensa-
 tion paid out by the professional insurance organisation and to
 78 days of benefit paid out by the ordinary insurance, or, if he
 does not possess the right to trade insurance, he receives benefits
 paid out by the ordinary insurance over a period of 126 days.
 Without paying attention to the method which determines the
 duration of benefits, it is apparent that its limitation is characterised
 by the exclusion from compensation of all unemployed who, after
 the expiration of the limits laid down, have not been absorbed
 into production.  Wherever unemployment has a permanent
 character, this is the equivalent of depriving the protection scheme
 of part of its value. Added to the other disqualifications, there
 results a profound difference between the number of unemployed
 who receive assistance and the actual number of unemployed, of
 which the first represents only a small percentage of the second.
 (For example, in Italy, the numbers benefiting from unemployment
 allocations represent only 10-12%  of the total numbers of
 registered unemployed).
 Such limitations also involve exclusions from the right to
 claim compensation in situations of temporary unemployment. In
 the United States, only 50% of the unemployed receive benefits;
 in Switzerland, 40%; in Austria about 70%.  In normal times the
 severity of these exclusions is determined by the duration of the
 period for which compensation is payable and by the mobility of
 labour, and in the last analysis by the volume and character of
 unemployment.  In times of crisis, the volume of exclusions
 increases as the crisis itself grows more serious.
 In some countries, as for example in Great Britain and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Austria, the unemployed person whose right to obtain allowance
 has expired before he has found work and who is in a state of
 need, is able to claim certain other benefits, in most cases without
 any time limit.  However these benefits are not granted in the
 form of insurance benefits, but as public relief.  Parallel with the
 insurance systems there thus exist assistance schemes financed not
 by contributions, but by taxation.  This double system of protec-
 tion, when at a given moment relief takes the place of insurance
 which has run out, exists only in very few countries, where, by
 reason of the local characteristics of unemployment, relief only
 entails a very limited expenditure, since not only the number of
 beneficiaries utilising these systems is small, but, moreover, the
 benefits available are inferior to those granted by the insurance
 organisations.
 "The reason for which such " insurance criteria " are to he
 found  in  almost  all  unemployment  protection  systems  is
 undoubtedly explained by the two-fold interest of the employers
 to pay out as little as possible and to keep the unemployed in the
 worst economic conditions, in order that they should constitute a
 factor tending to lower the wage of the employed workers. In fact,
 the short analysis that we have just made clearly demonstrates
 that the workers excluded from protection-the young people in
 search of their first job, the unemployed who are unable to satisfy
 the contribution demands, and those who are left without work
 after the expiration of the period of compensation-constitute a
 considerable mass of unemployed, unable to obtain compensation
 and exercising for these reasons severe competition on the labour
 market.
 Benefit Scales
 THE real scale of the benefits allowed in the different countries
 varies considerably.  They can be either fixed for the duration of
 the benefit or they can vary according to a given index or according
 to the cost of living or level of wages.  The benefits can be set at
 a uniform amount for all insured people or they can vary according
 to the amount of contributions made, according to trade qualifi-
 cations or according to the wages drawn.
 It is necessary to make special mention of benefits which are
 not fixed.  By this we mean benefits granted according to systems
 which do not take into account any changes in the cost of living,
 except by special decision, as for example by a law establishing a
 new amount of compensation.
 This kind of benefit is characteristic not only of countries
 with a relatively stable currency, but also of countries with an
 unstable currency, such as Italy and Austria.  Now a system of
 fixed benefits presents in the present stage of capitalism a serious
 threat to the real value of the benefits. All recent experience shows
 us that a stable currency under capitalism cannot be achieved.
 The sharpening of capitalist contradictions by imperialist wars and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 periodic crises have compelled the final abandonment of any
 stable currency. Currency manipulation has become a characteristic
 of. present-day capitalism.  Further, all-out rearmament creates,
 inflation.  This is why a system of fixed benefits under present
 conditions amounts to permitting the employers to decide the real
 value of benefits.
 Scales of benefit in capitalist countries are fixed according
 to the balance of class forces.  But if we examine the extent to
 which the level of benefits varies, we find that only in exceptional
 cases does this exceed two thirds of the average wage.  In the
 Netherlands, benefits vary between 60% and 80% according to the
 number of dependents (this percentage in fact includes the family
 allowance supplements, which implies the renunciation of family
 allowance).  In other countries the scale is much lower: in Austria
 from 38% to 50%, in Great Britain, below 40%.  In Belgium it
 is 50%, of the wage for unskilled labour (i.e., the lowest wage).
 In the Scandinavian countries it stands at about two-thirds of the
 wage and in Italy at less than 30% (including supplements for
 dependents).
 The compensation scales although generally including supple-
 ments for dependents, are nevertheless expressed as a percentage
 of the net wage, excluding the family allowance. The compensation
 received therefore represents a considerably lower percentage of
 the worker's ordinary income.
 The low general level of allowances is mainly due to the
 tendency of the employers to impose the biggest possible economies.
 In the countries where unemployment is temporary and affects few
 people, the desire of the employers to use unemployment to force
 down wages also plays a part.  The lower the benefits, the more
 the unemployed person is driven to exert pressure on the labour
 market by his search for work. That is why in certain countries
 where benefits are not limited with respect to time, and are still
 paid after the expiration of the right to draw benefit, the amount
 is reduced after a certain period.  In this way the unemployed
 person, his resources further reduced, is even more " inclined " to
 ask less for his labour power.  In France, compensation is in this
 way reduced by 20% after one year of assistance, and thereafter
 by 10% for each subsequent year.    In Great Britain public assis-
 tance benefits are less than three-quarters of the benefits paid out
 by the insurance.
 When benefits are ridiculously low (as in general is the case
 in.. countries having high permanent unemployment, and where
 only a small number of unemployed receive assistance after the
 expiry of the insurance benefits), not only is the effect which they
 exert on the consumer goods market a minimum one as a result
 of the very insignificant sums paid, but further than this, demand
 tends to fall.

 Finance and Organisation
 FINANCING differs considerably from country to country, both
 as regards method and the source.  A simple classification of
 methods may be made as follows.
 (a) Financing exclusively by the State, which covers costs:
 by taxation. This method is used not only in countries with 'a
 social security system, but equally in other countries.
 (b) Financing partially by the State, partially by contri-
 butions.  State assistance may be expressed by an annual
 appropriation of a stated sum, as in Great Britain, or by an
 appropriation when the need arises, as in Belgium and
 Norway. Contributions may be shared between workers and
 employers, in equal or unequal parts. as is the case in
 practically every country, or may be the exclusive responsi-
 bility of the workers, as in Sweden and Switzerland.
 (c) Financing only by contributions, without any assis-.
 Lance from the State.  In this case also, the contributions may
 be shared between the workers and the employers, or may be
 the responsibility of a single category, as in Italy, where they
 are borne exclusively by the employers.
 Contributions may be based on a fixed scale, or may be made
 proportional to wages, with a top limit, or again may be propor-
 tional to the real income.  In Great Britain, Norway and Austria
 contributions are fixed. In other countries where financing is
 carried out by contribution, a top limit exists.
 The effects of financing exclusively by contributions totally or
 partially supported by the industrial enterprises are well-known.
 A system of this sort determines the amount of contribution levied
 in relation to the demands of compensation and not to the income
 of the particular industrial concern.  That is to say, that the
 economic possibility of supporting the expenditure is not taken into
 account.  This has the effect of favouring all activities requiring
 a small labour force, that is, utilising mechanised processes, which
 are in short the large monopolist undertakings.  The others who
 are obliged to employ many work people, and who belong to the
 less monopolised sectors of the economy, are put at a disadvantage.
 Furthermore, contributions are, like taxation of wages, used as a
 pretext to reduce employment.
 The introduction of a top limit for contributions, or still
 worse, the establishment of a fixed contribution scale, brings about
 the suppression of any relationship between income and contribu-
 tion.                                      In other words, if a wage exceeds the maximum limit, or
 if the contribution is fixed, any extension of the working day fails
 to bring with it an increase in contributions, which has the same.
 effect as reducing the cost of overtime work and permitting the
 substitution of overtime for the taking-on of fresh workers.  Fur-
 thermore  this  tendency  considerably  increases  the                                           injustice
 existing in the distribution of the costs of social protection in..

 respect of certain branches of production.  In fact it increases the
 possibility of making the branches of industry with a large un-
 skilled labour force (where wages are below average) bear the main
 burden, whereas those branches of production which employ a
 small number of specialist workers (whose wages are above the
 average) are able to profit from the fact that the cost of specialised
 work does not cost more.  In this way the strongest among the
 employers' groups-those dominating the great monopoly con-
 cerns with a high level of mechanisation and employing a certain
 number of specialist workers-succeed in passing on thegreatest
 burden of insurance costs to small and medium industry.  This
 defective distribution exists in the same country between the
 more economically developed sectors and the more backward
 sectors.  In the case of the first, a considerable part of the wages
 are above the average, while in the others, the wages are average.
 That is to say that the deductions will be greater in relation to
 income in the second group, i.e., precisely in the poorest sectors.
 Contributions imposed on the workers represent an absurdity
 from any point of view.  The insurance benefits form a part of
 the income of the working class, that is to say of the price of
 their labour power.  It is therefore quite obvious that the price
 of labour, in other words the wage, plus the parts of the wage
 which are really a form of delayed investment, i.e., contributions
 or taxes, which are the equivalent of benefits--must be paid by
 the employers.  From this it follows that not only the contribu-
 tions, but also taxation destined to finance the benefits (in

 countries where insurance is financed with assistance from the
 State), must come out of profits in all its forms-industrial profit,
 rent, and interest.  Where the State participates in financing, this
 must be utilised to adjust the cost of insurance according to
 economic capacity (a function which a system based on contri-
 butions is unable to accomplish).  The collection of the requisite
 amounts should be carried out by a personal and progressive tax
 on unearned income, and not by indirect taxation, which has to
 be supported by the workers in their capacity as consumers, and
 still less by a percentage tax (as is the case in New Zealand) where
 the same percentage is subtracted from all incomes.
 As to the organisation of insurance schemes, we find here
 a great diversity of forms.
 In certain countries. insurance is directly administered by
 government authority, as in Great Britain and Luxembourg.  In
 other countries, Italy or the Netherlands, by one or several auto-
 nomous institutions: in other countries like the United States, by
 local government organs: in others as in France, by regional, local
 or professional funds: and finally in some countries, as in Denmark
 directly by the trade unions.  The degree of workers' participation
 in management is equally very diverse.  There is none when the
 insurance schemes or social security are directly administered by
 government or local authorities (Australia, New Zealand, Great
 Britain, Austria, etc.)  In other cases, the workers participate in
 management together with the employers, and generally speaking
 with government representatives. In practice even in the best cases,
 only a minority of the workers participate in the management of
 this form of social protection in capitalist countries.

 COMPLETE PROTECTION AGAINST
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 ,OUR examination has established that unemployment is a normal
 phenomenon of capitalism.  We have shown its manifestation
 in present-day conditions, and also the forms and extent of social
 .protection provided for in particular countries.
 We have seen that social protection does not exist in many
 countries, and that the problem of making both ends meet while
 unemployed is left to the individual worker. We have seen how in
 other countries, far from there being guaranteed protection for the
 whole working class, such protection is limited to certain categories
 of workers who sometimes only represent a minority of the
 working population who must have been able to satisfy certain
 conditions laid down, in the matter of contributions made or work
 ,done. Finally, we have seen that the benefits are inadequate and
 everywhere are limited in duration. Thus, in the great majority of
 countries which have instituted a form of unemployment protection,
 this is organised on a restrictive basis and is therefore incapable of
 insuring satisfactory protection.
 The Right to Social Protection
 The first problem is to define the number of people to be
 ,covered by unemployment insurance.  We have seen that in the
 schemes at present in force, protection is extended to various cate-
 gories of workers either because they are insured or because the
 scheme covers the industry in which they work.  In other words,
 the right to claim protection is conditioned.  Any reform having
 for its sole aim the inclusion in the existing scheme of certain
 categories of workers, at present excluded from it, for example,
 agricultural, seasonal or domestic workers, would only mean a
 purely quantitative change affecting the numbers entitled to social
 protection, without at all altering its restrictive conditions.
 We must, however, reaffirm the principle that social protec-
 tion must apply to every worker who becomes unemployed,
 without regard to whether he is registered with an insurance scheme,
 or whether he has worked in a prescribed job.
 Production is not a series of private acts, but a collective act
 of society. The right to obtain protection must for this reason be
 'based on the fact that the workers as a class produce the national

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 wealth, and that the incident covered by the protection occurs,
 independently of their will.  In fact, in capitalist society the possi-
 bility of finding work does not depend on the wish of the worker,.
 but on the demand for labour and in the last analysis, on the
 organisation of production.   If capitalist production. being based
 on private profit and not the needs of consumption, is unable to
 make use of the available labour, then it must at least guarantee
 adequate social protection to workers whom unemployment has
 left without resources.
 Social protection against unemployment is therefore a right
 which is applicable to the whole working class without exception.
 Not only workers employed in industry but also groups of young
 workers, agricultural, seasonal and domestic workers and others at
 present excluded by legislation in almost every capitalist country,
 must be covered.
 As soon as we recognise the right of the whole working class
 to receive unemployment protection, it becomes clear that benefits
 will apply to any unemployed person who can prove he is a worker,.
 without any condition of insurance qualification, of contributions
 or of work.
 There can be no question that this qualification must apply to
 all those who, before losing their employment, have worked in
 some sector or other of production or distribution. It is a different
 matter for young people in search of their first employment and
 for agricultural workers, who at the same time, are owners of a
 small holding incapable of absorbing, and in consequence of
 repaying all their labour power.  For the first group the difficulty
 can. be easily overcome, by fixing a minimum age-at the end of
 the compulsory education period or at the beginning of the legal
 working age-for compulsory registration with an employment
 bureau, which amounts to a certificate of qualification to become
 a worker.
 The question of the agricultural worker is more complicated.
 This includes also owners of small holdings which prove insufficient
 to afford them full subsistence. But in this case also the difficulties
 arising when it is necessary to assess them as workers with a right
 to social protection can be overcome, since it is possible to establish
 the period of real unemployment during the year.
 It is necessary to protect every worker not merely against
 absolute unemployment but also against partial unemployment,
 resulting in a partial loss of income.
 Duration and Scale of Benefits
 HAVING defined the categories entitled to social protection during
 unemployment, and the basic conditions for the granting of
 benefits, we must now determine the nature of this compensation.
 The aim of a complete scheme of protection must necessarily
 be (if protection is not to degenerate into charity) the defence of
 the living standards of the working class against all risks of society
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 ed Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 which are attended by a loss or diminution of income, an increase
 of expenditure, or both occurring simultaneously.  The scheme
 must therefore provide specific benefits which will permit those
 affected to get by without a serious lowering of their living condi-
 tions.  This is why, from the moment when a social security
 system has been put into operation, the living standards of the
 working class will depend not merely on total earnings (i.e., after
 deduction of all stoppages), but also on the sum of benefits, whether
 these replace the wage (as sickness, accident and unemployment
 .allowances) or whether they add to it (as family allowances).
 To the worker, unemployment means a loss of earnings.  It
 is naturally accompanied by a lowering of his living standards and
 constitutes an extra burden for the employed members of his family.
 Social protection against such an eventuality must therefore neces-
 sarily provide adequate compensation to make up for the wage he
 previously received.
 Taking into consideration that the right to unemployment pro-
 tection applies to all workers from the moment of unemployment,
 .and that the aim of this protection is to maintain a certain living
 standard, the cash benefits should cover the whole period of
 unemployment, without conditions or time limits.   The latter
 .actually has no valid justification except in the desire to save a
 portion of the benefits.  If a time limit should be established, the
 teffect could only be to exclude from compensation all those who,
 through no fault of their own, were unable to find employment.
 Benefits must cover the entire period of unemployment. They
 must be granted until the moment when the out-of-work person,
 who must, be registered with an employment bureau, receives an
 offer of work at his own trade. It is obvious that an offer of work
 at some other trade cannot be used as an excuse to terminate
 benefit.
 It would otherwise be really too simple for the ruling class to
 reduce the number of those receiving benefit.   In circumstances
 where there is no possibility of taking on workers with given trade
 qualifications the protection scheme must itself set about organising
 retraining courses, with the aim of facilitating the absorption of
 the unemployed into economic life.
 It is more complicated to fix the rates of benefit than to
 decide the duration period, in spite of the fact that we have already
 defined the aim of social protection as the defence of the living
 standards of the workers.  For obvious reasons it is impossible to
 demand full-scale compensation for the worker, i.e., compensation
 equalling the amount of wages previously earned, or which would
 have been earned if the worker had been allowed to take part in
 production.
 On the other hand it is impermissible that the benefits should
 be so low as to create a considerable gap between the living stan-
 dard of the unemployed, and that of the unemployed, workers. If
 this were the case, the very aim of social protection would be com-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 promised, without mentioning the drastic reduction in demand for
 consumer goods which would follow, with the consequent threat
 to wages resulting from the competition taking place on the labour
 market.
 In order to determine the scale of benefit, it is necessary there-
 fore to take the various factors into account. Benefits must ensure
 the unemployed person not merely a simple existence, but also a
 given and determinable living standard, on the basis of concrete
 needs, which should approximate to those of the employed workers.
 If the level of wages in a given country allows the working class to
 enjoy only a very reduced living standard compensations must not
 he allowed to differ at all significantly from this level, while in
 cases where the wage level is more favourable to the workers, the
 gap may be wider, although to a limited extent.  In any case, we
 are of the opinion that the scale of real compensation should vary
 between 70%, and 85%; of normal income.  Benefits below this
 level would be insufficient to satisfy the most essential and imme-
 diate needs.  In fact, if we examine the average level of wages in
 the capitalist countries, we can establish that the greatest proportion
 of wages is absorbed by the most urgent needs, such as food-
 clothing and housing.  Any worsening of the situation makes it
 extremely difficult to satisfy those basic needs.
 It goes without saying that the living standard of the unem-
 ployed person depends on his right to benefit and on the value
 of the latter.  But the living standard of the unemployed is not a
 matter which concerns them alone, since the lack of any adequate
 protection compels them to offer their labour power at a price
 lower than that demanded by the employed workers. The existence
 of a proper unemployment protection system and the struggle to
 obtain it are thus of direct interest to the entire working class, not
 only because its members may in future be caught by unemploy-
 ment. but above all as a medium of defence and in order to
 eliminate the obstacles which hinder the improvement of wage
 levels.  This common interest must therefore form the basis of
 unity between all workers, in the struggle for a proper unemploy-
 ment protection scheme.
 If we tackle the question. of compensation scales, we must con-
 cern ourselves with the problem of how to determine this compen-
 sation.                                         We already know why it is necessary to do away with
 benefits of fixed amount, since these are incapable of being adapted
 automatically to a new situation.
 If protection is to be limited merely to guaranteeing a certain
 purchasing power to the unemployed, it would be necessary to
 establish the relationship between the benefits and the cost of
 living.  In this manner the real value of the compensation, ex-
 pressed in consumer goods, would be able to adapt itself more or
 less completely to the variations in the value of money.  Thus we
 would have succeeded in ensuring the "constancy" of benefits in
 kind, expressed in consumer goods, without reference to the

 carried by these unemployed Italian workers.
 development of wages.  In other words, if employed workers were
 to obtain a wage increase during the period in question, without
 the cost of living being affected the real value of the compensation
 would nevertheless remain constant, which means that the gap
 between the living standards of the employed and unemployed
 workers would be increased.
 If, on the other hand, we mean to defend the standard of living
 of the working class by means of social protection. then compensa--
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 tion must necessarily be equal to wages. Earnings will tend to rise
 if the cost of living rises, even where there is no provision for a
 sliding scale, since workers are particularly inclined to fight to
 maintain the real level of their wages.  But the workers' fight is
 not confined to this field, and it tends just as much to improve
 living standards at the expense of profits.  If, however, compen-
 sation is linked to wages and follows wage advances, it is then
 adapted automatically not only when the cost of living goes up,
 but also when there is any real improvement won by the working
 class.  In this way the ties between the employed and unemployed
 workers can be strengthened and the direct interest of the
 unemployed aroused in all wage battles.
 A SCHEME of social protection against unemployment must not
 limit itself to the allocation of benefits, but must also seek to
 facilitate the re-entry of the unemployed into production.  Under
 the anarchy of capitailst production, a situation is often found
 where there is a relative excess of manpower in one industry and
 a relative scarcity in another.  On other occasions, unemployment
 arises from technical changes in production, which result in certain
 specialist qualifications being no longer required, while a new
 demand arises for different qualifications.  Often the absorption
 of labour forces is hindered by the lack of trained personnel, either
 in an absolute sense or in relation to the qualifications sought.
 Other things being equal, those possessing the necessary skill stand
 the best chance of obtaining work.
 Without doubt society is interested in having at its disposal a
 suitably qualified labour force (from the technical point of view).
 Equally the workers have the right to be productively employed,
 which would, within the limits of possibility, reduce the severity
 of unemployment.  Further to reduce the possibility and duration
 of unemployment, implies equally to reduce the expenses of
 unemployment protection.  The problem thus takes on particular
 importance within the framework of the social protection system,
 in the same way as the question of prevention must be of interest
 to bodies dealing with benefits for industrial accidents.
 Vocational training must necessarily be directed towards those
 sectors which present practical opportunities of expansion.
 Finance and Organisation
 IN selecting a system, it is necessary to keep in view the aim to be
 realised. To assert that social protection constitutes a funda-
 mental right for all workers, and that in consequence, the right to
 benefits extends to all, with no other condition than that of actual
 unemployment, to assert further that there must be no limit to the
 duration of compensation, and that the scale of benefit must be

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 such as to ensure a certain standard of living-to assert all this sig-
 nifies implicitly to exclude all schemes of the insurance type.
 These last are in fact based on restrictions which limit either
 the number of beneficiaries or the duration of benefit, the right to
 benefit, etc.  It is apparent that the desired conditions can only
 be realised by a broad social security system, requiring as qualifi-
 cation for benefit only membership of the working class and being
 unemptoyed:' The transition from a system based on the insurance
 principle to a system based on a social security system requires not
 only a quantitative change, that is to say an enlargement oL;.the
 system  elf, but a qualitative change, i.e., in the structure of social
 protection.
 The financing of such a system is rather complicated. In our
 opinion, the means should be found either in a mixed system-of
 contribution and taxation-or exclusively in the state resources.
 The reasons for which a system based solely on contributions
 must be rejected have already been indicated; since such a system
 does not take into account, in the distribution of costs, of the
 economic capabilities of the enterprises; it bears chiefly on concerns
 with a large labour force and on the other hand favours the great
 monopolist enterprises.  Moreover, contributions, if they are high
 enough, have the effect of a tax on wages and make themselves felt
 as a hindrance to expansion, and sometimes also encourage the
 employers to cut down their staffs.
 It is not difficult to realise that it is not permissible to require
 the workers to make contributions, for this would transform social
 protection into a redistribution of part of the employed workers'
 income among the entire working class, and would reduce the
 living standards of the workers below that permitted by their gross
 wages.
 For the constitution of the funds, independently of the manner
 in which this is done, it is necessary to take into account the fact
 that the benefits granted in the case of unemployment make 'tip a
 portion of the price of labour power of the community, and that
 its costs must consequently be borne by the employers. .In the.
 actual conditions of the various countries, it would be necessary to
 select the methods of financing and where necessary the sharing
 of the costs between contributions and taxation, in such a manner
 as to insure the best distribution of the cost of social protection.
 Thus, in one country it might be preferable to have a system
 financed by contributions with the participation of the state, and
 .in another country to have the financing carried out exclusively by
 taxation.  In the second case, it is necessary to ensure that the
 choice of taxation methods should be made in a responsible way,,
 since it is necessary to avoid all taxationwhich might be capable
 of being transferred in the last resort to the workers in their capacity
 as consumers.
 We have already been able to show that the schemes at presebc
 in force are organised in a very different way, that some of them
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 are based on a central organisation, others on local funds while
 others again are controlled directly by the State or by local
 authorities.  This variation corresponds to the diversity of local
 situations, and for this reason it is not an easy matter to decide
 which is the best system. That is why it seems to us more correct
 that each country should study locally the best applicable form of
 organisation for the scheme, in connection with which it is a matter
 of ensuring smooth working and at the same time obtaining the
 greatest possible economies in administrative expenditure.   But
 whatever the system selected the administration of the organisation
 (or various units) should be entrusted to the trade union movement
 in cases where this is a united body and can offer responsible
 guarantees of representing the whole working class and its demo-
 cratic character . In other cases, it should be handed over to repre-
 sentatives elected by all the workers.  When the financing of the
 scheme is guaranteed exclusively by the State, it is necessary to
 obtain a mixed administration, permitting the broad participation
 of the, workers and the. full preservation of their rights.
 The Fight for Social Protection in Countries with Temporary
 Unemployment
 THE ensuring of a suitable social security system against involun-
 tary unemployment, on the basis. of the principles which we
 have just explained, involves much lesser difficulties if it is a ques-
 tion of temporary unemployment. In this case its importance, com-
 pared to the number of employed workers, is relatively limited, and
 only becomes serious with the development of the cyclical crisis.
 In such a case the structure of society theoretically allows the
 utilisation of the entire available labour force, since this structure
 does not show a profound disequilibrium between the demand and
 supply of labour.  In circumstances where such a disequilibrium is
 present, unemployment is only able to decrease as a consequence
 of an expansion in the means of production.  Assuming that there
 is no permanent body of inherent unemployment, which is in-
 capable of being absorbed even in prosperous times, the absolute
 and relative variations in employment over short periods depend
 on the evolution of the cycle itself, which brings with it in conse-
 quence a high mobility of labour, and for any individual worker a
 fairly regular distribution of work and a rather shorter period of
 unemployment.  In the average "labour-life" the periods of
 employment are therefore incomparably longer than the periods of
 'unemployment.
 We thus find a situation where, unemployment has the
 following characteristics : limited volume compared with the total
 available manpower and with the degree of employment; short
 duration when compared with the average labour-life.  The intro-
 duction of a very broad system of social security is unable to secure
 substantial and structural modifications in the distribution of the
 social 'product.

 .   . It is apparent that with the extension of the scheme to cover
 more people, with the- recognition of the right of the whole working
 .class to enjoy protection and with the abolition of all preliminary
 conditions qualifying the right to benefit, the number of bene-
 4iciaries will naturally increase up to.the point of coincidence with
 The actual number of unemployed. But we have already seen that
 this number is limited, and in :consequence, the average number of
 beneficiaries will also be limited.  The abolition of the time limit
 for benefits and their modification to support the real burden of
 unemployment will naturally bring about an increase in expendi-
 ture, which will be greater insofar as the difference between the
 efFicacity of the scheme in force and that to be won is more con-
 siderable.  Moreover the expenditure also mounts proportionately
 to the number of beneficiaries.  But even in this case the increase
 is obviously limited. In spite of the additional costs and the aboli-
 tion of the workers' contributions, financing does not present prob-
 lems particularly difficult to solve, which should be a matter of
 financing by taxation or of a combination of financing by
 .employers' contributions together with State assistance.
 Having cleared the ground of all preconceptions on the ques-
 tion of the possibility of bringing into being an efficient unemploy-
 ment protection scheme, we must concretely define the aims to be
 attained in relation to the actual situation in the individual coun-
 tries, the advantages already achieved by the workers, the balance
 bf class forces and the political and trade union maturity of the
 workers.
 As we have already said, the final aim is not to achieve a
 modification of a purely quantitative type in the schemes, (where of
 course such schemes are in existence) by demanding for example the
 inclusion of new categories of workers, the reduction of the required
 conditions in the field of contributions or of work, in order to be
 able to obtain benefit, the increase of the latter, etc. Rather is it
 a question of carrying out a qualitative change, making the right
 to benefit (the scale of which should guarantee a given living stan-
 dard) apply to all workers, in the event of unemployment.
 Similarly, where there are no social protection schemes, or where
 the existing systems are not obligatory, the final aim must not be
 to set up a protection scheme with limitations in regard to the
 numbers affected, the scale and right to benefit. But it must be to
 :set up a system capable of putting into practice the principles we
 have just indicated.
 If we take- into consideration the consequences of social
 unemployment protection, that is the reduction of the employers'
 profits and the prevention of the exercising of pressure on wages,
 it is obvious that no benefit system cani be achieved without a united
 struggle; drawing in all workers, whatever their political or religious
 -opinions and: trade union affiliations. It is not enough to mobilise
 ,either thoseDwho at the moment are excluded from social protection
 or those unemployed who receive little or no benefit. On.?the con-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 trary, all workers should be directly concerned since unemployment
 affects them all, because it constitutes a permanent menace to their
 living standards.
 The mobilisation of the masses can only be achieved on the
 basis of concrete and attainable aims, which must be adapted to-
 conditions in the different countries and to particular categories of
 workers, and must also form a part'of working class policy directed
 towards better standards of life.
 These aims must therefore be determined according to the
 priorities and the initia1,?volume of popular support in a given
 country, in such a way as to ensure the broadest mobilisation in
 action.  The working class should seek support from craftsmen,
 small and medium employers, tradespeople, the liberal professions,.
 and smallholders cultivating their own land.
 An adequate system of social protection allows the employed
 person to maintain a given standard of life.  Benefits thus con-
 stitute a part of current income and so help to maintain purchasing
 power. This is particularly significant during periods of stagnation
 and crisis.  At such times, the demand for consumer goods falls
 suddenly because of mass unemployment (in cases where the
 unemployed are not compensated), which itself helps to increase
 the difficulties of the tradespeople, artisans, etc.
 This is why the workers must seek for an alliance with these
 sections in their struggle for unemployment protection, since they
 stand to benefit indirectly by its achievement.
 In Italy, for example, the working class has developed an
 alliance with such sections.  In their fight against the policy of
 shutting down basic .industry, which among other things leads to a
 loss of wages as a result of dismissals, and in consequence in a
 lowering of demand for consumer goods, the workers have had as
 allies the tradespeople, small agricultural proprietors, and shop-
 keepers who have gone into action by means of strikes, petitions,
 collections of signatures, meetings, etc.
 A second sphere where it is possible to realise this sort of
 policy is that of financing social security schemes. The extension
 of the social security system and the abolition of workers' contri-
 butions mean an increase in the employers' contributions.  This
 increase in costs may be covered by an increase either in contri-
 butions or in taxation.  A system based solely on contributions
 does not distinguish between the economic capabilities of individual
 enterprises, but fixes the contributions on the basis of the wages
 paid out, and thus constitutes a heavier burden for enterprises
 employing a greater labour force in relation to the total capital
 invested in production. A parallel situation may be produced in
 the case of total or partial financing by the State, when the money
 is obtained by taxes which bear most heavily on the consumers
 (which brings about a contraction of the market) or on the small.
 and medium enterprises.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 It is therefore necessary to take into account not only the
 .additional social expenses which result from the transformation
 of the protective system, but also the expenses already existing,
 and to redistribute them according to the real income of the various
 enterprises.  On this basis, not only the working class, but also
 most small and medium employers, can participate in the fight.
 This is why, in determining the concrete aims to be realised,
 it is necessary to take into account not only the economic and
 social situation, but also the need for an alliance of the working
 class with as many other sections of the people as possible.
 In certain capitalist countries where there is already a broad
 system of social protection, the immediate objective must be to
 change its character and extend it.  In France, for example, the
 ,C.G.T. has aimed at just such a radical transformation. Elsewhere,
 short-term aims can be achieved, like the increase in benefit scales
 and their determination not as a fixed sum, but in relation to
 wages, the extension of the scheme to more people, with for
 example the inclusion of young people in search of their first
 employment, agricultural workers, etc., the abolition of workers'
 contributions and of time limits or conditions attached to benefits,
 the readjustment of social insurance charges according to income,
 the control of social protection by the workers, or at the least their
 participation.
 But in a case where the situation allows only limited aims to
 be set, these should be seen as part of a fight to achieve the right
 to social security against unemployment.
 The Fight for Social Protection in' Countries with Permanent
 Unemployment
 IN the capitalist countries where unemployment has taken on a
 permanent character as a result of an insufficient capitalisation
 on the one hand and a superabundant supply of labour power on
 the other, the realisation of an adequate system of unemployment
 benefit raises much more serious problems.
 The setting-up of a system to guarantee unemployment benefit
 .and to ensure a given living standard, raises very difficult financial
 problems.  Taking into consideration the constant high number
 of beneficiaries, and the scale of benefits which must guarantee a
 living standard not too much below that of the employed workers,
 the expenditure on such a scheme will be very high and difficult to
 .apportion, if one does not wish to run the risk that its consequences
 may bring about serious harm to the economic life of the country.
 If the financing led to an increase in the contributions, this would
 act as a pretext for reducing employment.  The raising of the
 necessary funds by taxation might..also have similar effects.
 The introduction of benefits results in an increased demand
 for goods.  If the cost of the benefits is not carried by the
 employers' profits, but is transferred to prices, we end up not with

 an increase in production. but with inflation.  But this does not
 mean that it is necessary to renounce the policy of acting directly
 on consumption by a policy of increasing the benefits, even in the
 case of inherent unemployment.
 The problem, however, cannot be solved if we limit ourselves
 to social protection.  The solution must be found in the field of
 economic policy. The only genuine and effective protection against
 unemployment is its, virtual abolition through the elimination of its
 fundamental causes, on the basis of expanding production.
 It is. of course, obvious that it is impossible to do this without
 eliminating the forces interested in holding back production, and
 restricting the market for the benefit of monopoly profits.
 In this way the struggle for social protection becomes part of
 the general struggle against the monopolies for the expansion of
 the national economy.
 We are unable to enter as fully as we should like into the
 details of such action on the part of the working class.  We will
 merely draw attention to the experiences of the Italian working
 class, which through its unified trade union organisation. the
 C.G.I.L.. has put the problem in actual terms of struggle, in its
 " Plan for Labour."  This plan which, in the economic conditions
 of Italy. constitutes the alternative to the ruling class policy of
 stagnation  and  war was conceived  with  the  perspective of
 bringing about. by a campaign of public investment and by political
 action. a recovery of production in certain basic sectors of
 economic life, capable of producing a general increase in produc-
 tion and employment, and in consequence. an expansion of the
 market.  The key sectors have been specified as follows:
 -The indispensable condition for a general recovery of
 production is the expansion of the hydro-electric industry (which
 in Italy represents the same thing as the coal mines for Great
 Britain. that is. the industry producing the motive power), by
 means of public investment and the elimination of monopoly
 through nationalisation:
 -The development of uncultivated or insufficiently cultivated
 land in order to enlarge the disposable land fund (and, in conse-
 quence. to achieve more stable employment in agriculture) and in
 order to increase production and extend retail sales for products
 of the metal and engineering industries. whose recovery would thus
 he equally assured:
 --An increase in the people's housing, not only to deal with
 the terrible shortage of houses, but above all to stimulate the
 recovery of all industries linked to building.
 On this basis the Italian working class is every day succeeding,
 in enlarging its,sphere of activity by an effective policy of alliance
 with ever broader sections of small and medium employers.
 How is it possible to link the fight for unemployment protec,,
 tion to the fight for increased production, and the expansion of.

 These five lads are busy building a fort with the debris from behind one
 of the working-class dwellings between 8th and 9th Avenue, in 52nd Street,
 New York City. U.S.A. When they leave school, will they find work?
 employment'?  An alliance of this kind can be achieved by
 including in the general struggle such concrete objectives in the
 field of social protection as are capable of mobilising not merely
 the workers, but the broadest strata of the population.  Thus a
 campaign to obtain an increase in benefits (the extension of the
 number of beneficiaries or increase of the rates of benefit, etc.),
 seen as part of the general fight against the monopolies, would
 stimulate increased consumption, bringing pressure to bear on one
 aspect of the crisis, by securing fuller use of existing enterprises,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 and at the same time would act as a stimulant to make more
 effective the campaign to alter the structure of the economy. It.
 is with this perspective that the working class should see its actions.
 Parallel with the struggle against the shutting-down of industry by
 demanding measures to ensure the recovery of the basic sectors of
 production, it is essential to raise in concrete terms the problem
 of the, expansion of the consumer market, whether by an increase
 in wages, or by antincrease in the volume of benefits by raising the
 number of beneficiaries and the rates of compensation granted. In
 the case of permanent unemployment, the fight must be carried
 through on the basis of broad unity, drawing in employed workers
 in the same way as the unemployed and all other economic strata
 interested in a recovery of production, on the basis of common
 objectives. But these aims must be defined not in narrow terms of
 social protection, but as part of a broad political platform,
 according to the actual conditions in the individual countries.
 Thus in Italy, for example, the following objectives are laid
 down for the purpose of broadening the scheme in relation to the
 numbers affected, the inclusion of wide groups of workers at
 present excluded, such as agricultural and seasonal workers, and
 young people in search of their first employment (since the
 influence of this category on the total of unemployed rises every
 year, as a consequence of the incapacity of Italian economy to
 absorb them).
 --Revision of the rates and duration of benefit, as well as the
 methods used to determine these.
 --Organisation of an effective system of employing workers,
 ensuring an equitable distribution of opportunities for work and a
 trade training scheme designed to provide new forces for industry
 and agriculture.
 --Equitable distribution of assessments on wages.
 -Participation of the workers in the control of institutions
 for social protection, etc.
 All these demands are a part of the struggle carried on by
 the working people for a new economic policy, the expansion of
 production, and prosperity.

 APPEAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
 FOR THE DEFENCE, IMPROVEMENT AND
 EXTENSION OF SOCIAL INSURANCE AND
 SOCIAL SECURITY
 AT the end of the second World War the people of all countries
 hoped to see at last the fulfilment of their earnest desire for
 prosperity, progress and security in the social order.  They were
 looking forward especially to improvement in the existing social
 insurance systems and the introduction of social security schemes
 for protecting the entire population against all risks.
 These aspirations were so strong that important advances
 were registered in various branches of social legislation and social
 rights.  However, this favourable development never extended to
 all countries. In particular, the colonial and economically un-
 developed countries where social security was non-existent were
 still, in the main, left out.
 Today, however, the people are confronted with the fact that
 not only are there no further advances but that an opposite ten-
 dency has set in.  In an increasing number of countries 'there
 has been regression in the sphere of social legislation and advan-
 tageous projects already adopted are either being deferred or with-
 drawn. These attacks make themselves felt especially in the field
 of unemployment insurance, old age pensions and health setvices
 but they also affect other branches of social security.
 In those countries where social security schemes do not exist
 increasing obstacles are being raised against their introduction.
 The real value of social security benefits is being reduced and
 the functioning of social security systems jeopardised through
 inflation, rising costs of living and the heavy burden of armaments.
 Millions of men and women are condemning this situation as
 it is well known that the economic, financial and technical resources
 of the world would be sufficient to ensure decisive advances in
 social security, and this is, in fact, proved by the continual pro-
 gress achieved in this sphere by some countries which are con-
 stantly perfecting their social security systems.  Consequently the
 most varied sections of the population in countries where there is
 regression in social security are expressing their very justified
 apprehensions and are insisting that this regression shall end.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Within the trade unions and other working class organisations
 the members have already carried on many activities expressing
 their determination to reverse the present trends.  This desire has
 also found expression amongst many professional people including
 doctors, administrators and specialists in social questions, basing
 themselves on the support of the masses of social security
 beneficiaries.
 Thus the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions
 in calling an International Conference for the Defence, Improve-
 ment and Extension of Social Insurance and Social Security meets
 the needs of the present situation.
 The International Conference, planned originally for Decem-
 ber 1952 has been postponed at the request of several national
 groups to March 2nd-6th, 1953.  It will be held in Vienn_,
 Austria.
 The
 (1)
 (2)
 following Agenda is proposed :
 Adoption of the Agenda and rules of the Conference.
 The Defence, Improvement and Extension of Social
 Insurance and Social Security and its inauguration in
 countries in which it does not exist.
 Adoption of the recommendations of the Conference.
 It is proposed that the Conference should bring together, in a
 discussion open to the expression of all points of view, the
 experiences of the various countries; analyse concretely the present
 situation; establish general principles which may serve as a basis
 for social security systems in all countries, discuss the means to
 realise this programme and consider how best the people can
 defend and impr.o a their systems of social security.
 11 We are calling upon all who are in favour of social justice to
 endorse the present appeal and invite all organisations to. elect or
 appoint delegates to attend this important Conference.
 By contributing to the success of the International Conference
 you will help to raise the level of activity for the defence and
 advancement of social security and for its introduction where it
 does not yet exist. Thus a great contribution will be made towards
 raising the living standards of the people and opening the way for
 security and welfare in all countries.
 Appeal adopted by the Preparatory
 Committee of the International
 Conference.
 16th September, 1952.

 many shortcomings. But :we are aware, of them, and are
 doing everything we can to remove them as quickly as pos-
 sible.
 .In talking with people from other countries, and when.
 reading the foreign press, one often meets with incorrect
 ideas about the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As
 First Secretary of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.,
 I should like to dwell a little on this question.
 Yes, many. legends are spread about the Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union. And this is not surprising, be-,
 cause our Party organizes and unites the masses for the build-
 ing of an entirely new society-a communist society, one,
 fundamentally  different  from  the  old,  capitalist so-,
 ciety.. .
 I think you will not suspect, me of indulging in propaganda..
 (Laughter and applause.) We consider that ideas are a matter
 of the conscience, the outlook not only of each nation, but
 of each individual. After all, there are people in our country
 who do not belong to the Communist Party. The Commu-
 nist Party has 8 million members, and the Young Communist
 League nearly 18.5 million members, as against the 200
 million inhabitants of the Soviet Union. (Animation.) Con-
 sequently, very far from all in our country are members
 . 49

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of the Party or the Young Communist League, and, what
 is more, that is not our object. But all the people of our coun-
 try are united around the Communist Party, and rightly
 regard it as their organizer and leader. In our country, the
 people and the Party are inseparable.
 Ideas and convictions are the personal affair of each indi-
 vidual. In the U.S.S.R., Communists and non-Communists,
 atheists and believers work jointly and harmoniously for
 the good of the people. Freedom of worship is recognized for
 all citizens. Freedom of conscience and religious faith is not
 only proclaimed, it is strictly guaranteed by the state as
 a constitutional right of the citizens of the U.S.S.R.
 (Applause.) Among the Soviet citizens are Christians,
 Moslems, Buddhists, Baptists and people of other denomi-
 nations.
 Our great teacher, Lenin, who deeper and better than
 anyone understood the laws of development of modern so-
 ciety, founded the Communist Party as the vanguard of the
 working class, as the most advanced section of the peoples
 of Russia. Appreciating the gigantic power of the working
 class and the labouring masses generally, he aroused them
 for the decisive attack on the slave, feudal and capitalist
 order of things which fettered the peoples of Russia. Lenin
 did this not only for the sake of the freedom and happiness
 of the peoples of our country. He knew that it would benefit
 the peoples of other countries.
 The Great October Revolution ushered in a new era in the
 life of mankind. As Jawaharlal Nehru says in his book,
 The Discovery of India: "The Soviet revolution had advanced
 human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame
 which could not be smothered. (Applause.) It had laid the
 foundations for that `new civilization' toward which the
 world  would  advance."  We  fully  agree with  these
 words.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 It has been said that there was much unnecessary sacrifice
 of life in that revolution. But that is not true. The October
 Socialist Revolution was the most bloodless of the great rev-
 olutions. (Applause.) Having taken the power into its own
 hands, the working class did not blindly punish those who had
 wronged and oppressed it for ages. More, in the first months
 after the October Revolution, it released on their word of
 honour many reactionary tsarist generals, who then per-
 fidiously broke their pledges and took up the sword against
 their people. The Soviet republic needed peace, and Lenin
 and the workers' and peasants' government proclaimed peace.
 But a bloody struggle was forced upon us. It was not of
 our choosing. After all, it is not propaganda but an histori-
 cal fact that the armies of the French, British, American,
 Japanese and other invaders, armed to the teeth, were
 hurled against Soviet Russia.
 The war thus imposed on us caused incalculable losses.
 But, I repeat, it was not we that chose it. We were attacked,
 they sought to strangle the Soviet state, to tear our country
 to pieces.
 And, is it not to the credit of Lenin, to the credit of the
 Communist Party, to the credit of all our people, that we
 did not bow our heads and capitulate to the superior forces
 of an enemy armed to the teeth? The working class and all
 the peoples of our multi-national country rallied around their
 collective leader, the Communist Party, and rose in a sacred
 patriotic war. The enemy was shattered, and the Soviet state
 firmly established itself as the mighty power of the liberated
 peoples. (Applause.)
 Having won the longed-for peace, the Soviet people, with
 inexhaustible energy, addressed themselves to the peaceful
 reconstruction of their country, in which they achieved
 outstanding success. Engaged in peaceful labours, we knew
 that the forces of reaction had not quietened down. Fearing

 the very existence of the Soviet country, where the people
 enjoy the fruits of their labour, our enemies let loose
 against our country the mad dog of Hitler fascism. How the
 fascist invasion ended is well known. Nazism, that formid-
 able menace to free mankind, was crushed, and Hitler
 has long since mouldered in his grave.
 The Second World War caused tremendous damage  to
 our country. Here, too, the Soviet people, inspired by the
 Communist Party, did not retreat in face of the difficulties.
 They have fully repaired the ravages of the war. And now,
 with unparalleled energy, the people are building new mills
 and factories, and the biggest hydro-electric stations in the
 world.
 I say this not because I want to foist upon you the Soviet
 path of development, but in order that you may have a better
 idea of the difficult path our people have travelled. But it is
 a noble path, and advancing along it our people have regis-
 tered tremendous gains and achievements. We have in this
 period acquired great experience. And if you want in any de-
 gree to utilize the experience we have achieved in this or
 that branch of economy or culture, we shall readily, amicably
 and disinterestedly share it with you and give you all pos-
 sible assistance. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 Our people are absorbed in a gigantic task of construction.
 The Soviet Union is now engaged on a programme envisaging
 a swift advance in all branches of the national economy, in
 order to promote the economic and cultural progress of the
 Soviet Union and a continued rise in the living standards
 of its people.
 We are gladdened and inspired only by peaceful work.
 We strive tirelessly for peace and peaceful relations between
 countries. It must however be said that we do not always
 meet with proper response and support from a number of
 other countries in the work of strengthening peace.

 We stand for the-fullest development of international trade
 and cultural intercourse. All the world knows of the Soviet
 Government's efforts for relaxation of international tension.
 We stand for peace and for the peaceful co-existence of
 states, regardless of their internal social systems. This is
 corroborated by all our country's ? foreign policy measures.
 An important international event was the Conference of
 the Four-Heads of Government in Geneva, which resulted in
 a ,certain easing of international tension. In pursuance of
 the Directives of the Four Heads of Government, a conference
 of the Foreign Ministers of these countries recently took place
 in' Geneva. But it dhd not achieve any great results, because
 the Ministers were confronted with very complicated prob-
 lems which cannot be solved at one conference. We are
 confident, however, that if we adhere to the course charted
 by the Geneva Conference of the Four Heads of Government,
 we shall achieve further relaxation of international tension,
 and shall move forward step by step to the settlement of
 all complicated international problems.
 We cannot close our eyes to the fact that there are some
 who cannot stomach the spirit of Geneva. Certain elements
 in some countries are still trying to carry on the notorious
 "positions of strength" policy, the policy of holding up the
 threat of atomic weapons, which is a disgrace to modern
 civilization.
 After the Second World War, the reactionary elements
 sought to frighten us with the atomic bomb and hold us in
 subjection. But, as you know, nothing came of this. Soviet
 scientists discovered the secret of producing atomic energy.
 (Applause.) In order to frustrate the aggressive designs of
 certain bellicose -foreign leaders, we were compelled to man-
 ufacture atomic and hydrogen bombs ourselves. But having
 produced these weapons, we declared there and than that
 we did not want them ever to be used. The Soviet Union was

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the first in the world to place atomic energy at the service
 of peaceful development. We have made proposals for the
 prohibition of the production and use of atomic and hydro-
 gen weapons, and for a solemn undertaking by the govern-
 ments not to employ these weapons. But so far the Western
 Powers have not agreed to these proposals.
 The forces of reaction are doing all in their power to disrupt
 peace. But we are convinced that victory will be on the side
 of the peoples and individuals who desire peace, for peace
 among the nations is the dream of all progressive men and
 women. We are glad that in this we have such a fine ally as
 India. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 The Soviet people and the people of other countries highly
 appreciate the big contribution made by the Indian people and
 their Government to the effort for peace, the effort to elim-
 inate the threat of another war. India worked actively for
 ending the wars in Korea and Indo-China. (Prolonged ap
 plause.) Despite the obstacles raised, India continues to
 discharge the difficult, but honourable international duty of
 supervising observance of the armistice terms in Korea and
 Viet-Nam.
 There are still many complex and unsolved problems
 in the present-day world. Much effort, perseverance and pa-
 tience will be required to preserve and consolidate peace, but
 we have firm faith in the triumph of this noble cause.
 Mr. Chairman, Honourable Members,
 We may note with satisfaction that the economic and
 cultural ties between our countries have lately become con-
 siderably stronger. (Prolonged applause.) There are good pros-
 pects for extending mutually beneficial economic relations
 between the U.S.S.R. and India, and this will help to
 bring our peoples still closer together. Trade is successfully
 developing on the basis of the Soviet-Indian Trade Agree-
 ment signed in 1953. (Applause.) We  believe  that an

 important contribution to the strengthening of our eco-
 nomic ties is the agreement concluded this year, providing
 for the construction in India, with the help of the Soviet
 Union, of an iron and steel works which will produce a
 million tons of steel annually. (Applause.) Soviet workers
 and engineers have undertaken with great enthusiasm the
 fulfilment of the orders  connected  with  this project.
 We attach great importance to personal contact between
 leaders of the Republic of India and the Soviet Union. The
 visit of the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, to the Soviet
 Union has left a deep impression on the minds of the Soviet
 people. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 Soviet people display tremendous interest in India's
 rich and ancient culture. Many works by Indian writers
 have been translated into Russian. The splendid productions
 of India's great writer and public figure, Rabindranath
 Tagore, enjoy great popularity in our country. (Applause.)
 Books by modern Indian writers are read with unflagging
 interest by our people. (Prolonged applause.) In the period
 of Soviet rule, Indian literary works have been published
 in the Soviet Union in a total of more than two million
 copies. (Applause.) Russian translations have been made of
 the writings of Mahatma Gandhi, who had such a thorough
 knowledge of his country and its great people, and who
 played such a big part in your history. (Prolonged applause.)
 The Discovery of India, the book by the distinguished
 statesman and political leader, the Prime Minister of the
 Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has been published
 in a large edition. (Applause.)
 We stand for all-round and broad exchange in the sphere
 of culture and art, and for exchange of technical and scien-
 tific achievements. The Soviet people are always glad to
 see Indian friends in their country. (Applause.) The better
 we know each other and help each other, the firmer will

 throughout the world. (Prolonged applause.)
 Allow me to thank you for the warm and friendly welcome
 you and your hospitable people have accorded our delega-

 people of India happiness and prosperity. (Stormy applause.)

 VISIT
 OF N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 TO THE BHAKRA-NANGAL
 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
 November 22
 On  their  arrival in Bhakra, N. A. Bulganin and
 N. S. Khrushchov inspected the construction of the dam
 and acquainted themselves with the project of the entire
 Bhakra-Nangal system.
 After the inspection  of the  dam  construction site,
 C. P. N. Singh, Governor of the State of Punjab, gave a lunch-
 eon in honour of N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov.
 In the course of the luncheon the Governor made a brief
 speech of welcome to N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov,
 in which he said: "We are very glad to have you visit the State
 of Punjab. The warm welcome and hospitality shown you by
 the people of Punjab are an expression of the sincere, friend-
 ly feelings of the entire Indian people for the people of the
 Soviet Union. The construction project you have seen today
 symbolizes everythitig we should like to do in our country.
 We should like your help in this great work. We could
 draw a great deal from your experience."
 In his speech of reply N. A. Bulganin expressed deep grat-
 itude for the warm welcome and hospitality accorded them.
 He noted that the hospitality of the Punjabis was a stirring
 demonstration of the friendship between the peoples of In-
 dia and the Soviet Union. "The attitude of the Punjabis
 towards us," he continued, "deeply moved us and carried us,

 in our mind's eye, home, where we should like to tell the
 Soviet people how affectionately we are being welcomed in
 India. Our two countries are separated by high mountains,
 by vast expanses, but our friendship knows no barriers. It is
 not hindered either by the mountains or the expanses." (Ap-
 plause.) To a fresh outburst of applause N.A. Bulganin said
 in Hindi, "Hindi Rusi bha'i bha'i/" (Indians and Russians
 are brothers!) Emphasizing that he and N. S. Khrushchov had
 been particularly pleased by their inspection of the Bhakra-
 Nangal construction project that day, N.A. Bulganin proposed
 a toast to the great people of India and to Soviet-Indian
 friendship.
 N. S. Khrushchov then made a short speech.
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOT
 "Friends,
 "We have already been a number of days in your remark-
 able country. Indeed, we have had so many interesting
 impressions and meetings that I have lost count of the days.
 We have met a great number of people. We have seen many
 of the fine things created by the people of India. (Applause.)
 We have had the opportunity of seeing both ancient temples
 and projects under construction. But the most valuable
 thing of all for us is the friendship shown us everywhere.
 (Applause.)
 "Your Prime Minister Nehru visited us not long ago and
 he was given a warm welcome. We, in the Soviet Union,
 have a very high opinion of him, and the reason for our
 high opinion is that he realizes the importance of friend-
 ship between our countries and of our common struggle to
 strengthen peace and friendship among nations.
 "We have different political outlooks, you have your
 outlooks and your philosophy, we have ours. What is the
 use of finding out now what points we differ on? The im-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 portant thing is to see that we are at one on the main thing
 (applause), the question of war and peace. This is a ques-
 tion on which no man can be indifferent. No honest person
 can help wishing for peace and fighting for it. (Applause.)
 And we are looking for friends in the struggle for peace,
 no matter how great or small the states they belong to,
 no matter what their political outlooks, races or creeds may
 be. The important thing is that there should be a common
 desire to strengthen peace. It is each country's domestic
 affair what system of government it has. And political views
 are each man's own concern. That is why we ask others not
 to interfere in our internal affairs and do not allow our-
 selves to interfere in anybody else's. (Applause.)
 "The Five Principles of peaceful co-existence proclaimed
 by Prime Minister Nehru and our friend Chou En-lai
 satisfy us  completely. (Applause.) We confirmed this
 in the Statement which Mr. Nehru signed with us when
 he was in Moscow.
 "As for problems of political structure, our views are quite
 definite and clear-cut, but we have no intention of imposing
 them on others. Economic construction and technology are
 another matter, they are international problems.
 "Nikolai Alexandrovich was right when he said here that
 it was a pleasure for us to see the power station construction
 shown to us today. It was a greater pleasure to see the men,
 their eager eyes and the enthusiasm with which they work.
 "We were particularly glad that it was the building of a
 power station that our friends showed us. This is a fight
 against the elements, a fight to harness nature and to make
 it serve man. To accomplish this task is especially impor-
 tant to the Indian people who have been lagging behind eco-
 nomically not through their own fault, but through the fault
 of others; I am not going to be more explicit, you know who
 it is that I mean and they will know themselves. (Applause.)

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 "We have said already that we are willing to share our
 experience in peaceful construction with you. But some
 newspapers, voicing the views of those who are displeased by
 our trip to India, have been saying that Khrushchov and Bul-
 ganin are cunning and can deceive India with their promises
 of technical aid, and that the Indians would do well to be
 on their guard. (Laughter.)
 "Here is what we say to those who write such things:
 perhaps you want to compete with us in friendship with the
 Indians? All right, we agree. (Applause.) What have we come
 here with? We have come to you with open hearts (applause),
 and honest intentions. (Applause.) We say to you: You want
 to build industrial establishments? We are glad to hear it.
 Perhaps you have not enough experience? Ask us, we will
 help you. (Applause.) You want to build power stations?
 If the task is new to you or if you want technical assistance,
 ask us, we will help you. (Applause.) You want to send your
 students and engineers to us for training? Do so, by all means.
 (Applause.)
 "Well, that's our 'cunning'-see that we don't deceive
 you now, as some people are writing. (Laughter, applause.)
 We should very much like other countries to show the same
 'cunning.' It is better to compete in this field than in the
 production of atomic and hydrogen bombs. (Stormy ap-
 plause.) This is a nobler occupation.
 "We are not at all worried by the scribblings and broad-
 casts of people who want to set us at loggerheads. They talk,
 write, and broadcast speeches, but it all goes in at one ear
 and out at the other. (Applause.) People are now in the hab-
 it of judging by deeds rather than by words. (Applause.)
 And when we meet Indians, although we do not know
 their language, we read friendship in their eyes." (Ap-
 plause.)
 N. S. Khrushchov closed his speech with a toast to firmer

 Indo-Soviet friendship and the health of Prime. Minister
 Jawaharlal Nehru.
 Then the Maharaja of Patiala presented gifts to N. A.
 Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov-two ancient sabres with
 silver- and gold designs. "May these swords serve peace," the
 Maharaja said. N. A. Bulganin  and N. S. Khrushchov
 thanked the Maharaja for the precious gift and handed
 him presents made by Soviet handicraftsmen.
 Thanking the Maharaja for the gift, N. S. Khrushchov said,
 "I shall treasure this gift as a symbolic souvenir of friend-
 ship, Here is what I thought as I looked at this :splendid:
 sword: When a baby is born, we Soviet people say, it needs
 good care. If .it is left without care, defenceless, unlooked
 after, it will die. It must be cared for and defended until
 it is able to defend itself. I like the way you look after trees.
 When they are small you carefully fence them off so that
 the wind will not break them, or a careless foot tread upon
 them. Once the tree has grown up it needs no more fencing.
 A tall and strong tree fears neither wind nor storm. That is
 true of a state too. Our state came into being 38 years ago.
 It was still weak, and could hardly keep on its legs, and then
 fourteen countries fell upon it .all at once. The British took
 up arms against us. I hope the British journalists here
 present will excuse me. But you cannot get away from it,
 it is an historical fact. The Americans, the French and the
 Japanese crusaded against us. What were we to do? Sit back
 with folded arms? That is not what our people did. They
 unsheathed their swords and rose to defend their new-born
 state. We fought well. We drove out the invaders and said
 to them: Don't try war on us again. There was a Russian
 prince who said a long, long time ago: He who comes
 to us with a sword shall perish by the sword. That
 is the rule we keep to now. We welcome guests and treat
 them well. But anybody wishing to come to us with a

 sword, as an enemy, would do well to remember what
 happened to Hitler; the same will happen to any enemy.
 (Applause.)
 "I do not want to give you any advice, but I cannot re-
 frain from the question: how long was India under the sway
 of colonialists? For centuries. You are determined, of course,
 to maintain your freedom and independence. I will tell you
 what I know from our own experience: there are some who
 look at us with envious eyes and wonder how they could
 smash us. We, of course, should like our bombs and shells
 to remain unused for ever. We would prefer to produce
 tractors and other useful things. But what would happen
 to us if we were disarmed? We would certainly be torn to
 pieces, and then our grandsons would say: Lenin was a
 great man who properly understood the interests of the peo-
 ple. Under his leadership Soviet rule was established and
 the Soviet State created, but posterity failed to uphold
 their freedom and independence. We are upholding our
 freedom as a sacred thing so that this may never happen.
 We cannot do without it. You, too, must guard what you
 have won in a hard struggle.
 "That is what we sincerely wish you." (Applause.)

 IN BOMBAY
 SPEECH OF WELCOME BY M. DESAI,
 CHIEF MINISTER OF STATE OF BOMBAY,
 AT AIRFIELD
 November 23
 Your Excellencies, we are very happy to welcome you
 to the city of Bombay. In the short time you have been
 in India you have visited our capital and some of the other
 interesting places in our country. Now you have arrived
 in Bombay. Bombay is a city where one can meet people
 from all the provinces of India and from various countries
 of the world. Your visit to this universally known city is
 a tremendous joy for the citizens of Bombay.
 Our Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, recently visited
 your great country. The peoples of India and Russia used
 the opportunity which that visit provided to establish
 closer contact. Your visit to India will further promote the
 friendly relations between our two countries.
 India has always believed in the ideals of peace and reject-
 ed the use of force. The father of our state, Mahatma Gandhi,
 enjoined us to maintain friendship with all the nations of the
 world. The nations desirous of establishing peace throughout
 the world have expressed their faith in the Five Principles,
 Panch Shila; your great and powerful nation is one of them.
 The people of India believe that peace and understanding
 among nations will ensure progress for all of us, and then
 there will be no place for destruction. We believe that friend-
 ship between India and Russia will substantially promote

 the creation of friendly ties among the various countries
 of the world and will ensure the welfare of mankind. I hope
 that this will bring us to an era of peace, to prosperity the
 world over. Once again I welcome you, from the bottom of
 my heart, to the city of Bombay.
 SPEECH BY N. A. BULWANIN
 Dear friends,
 We heartily thank you for your friendly and warm recep-
 tion. Nikita Sergeyevich and I, and all the friends who have
 come with us are happy to greet the citizens of the glorious
 city of Bombay.
 We are well familiar with the history of your remarkable
 city where the beginning. was laid for the organized move-
 ment of the Indian people to regain their national independ-
 ence. Your city is known as a world transport and indus-
 trial centre, as a centre of national culture and science.
 We know very well what an important part your remark-
 able city is playing in the economic and cultural develop-
 ment of the Republic. That is why we are especially glad to
 visit the glorious city of Bombay, to make the acquaintance
 of its inhabitants and to learn of their achievements in the
 economic, cultural and scientific fields.
 We are very glad to be able to convey, in person, friend-
 ly, ardent greetings from the peoples of the Soviet Union
 to the residents of Bombay.
 Once again we thank you, dear friends, for your warm and
 friendly welcome.
 (N. A. Bulganin's words were greeted with stormy applause.)

 ADDRESS OF MAYOR OF BOMBAY
 Your Excellencies,
 On behalf of the citizens we, the members of the munic-
 ipal corporation of Greater Bombay, convey our heartfelt
 greetings to you. We are glad that you are with us and that
 we have the opportunity to convey, through you, our best
 wishes to the peoples of Russia. We assure you that we shall
 remember you a long time. We welcome you as represent-
 atives of a great nation whose resolute struggle we have
 admired throughout four decades. Your country has won
 many splendid battles against foreign aggression. Your
 emergence into the world arena as a great power is truly
 an.event of immense importance. It is perfectly clear that
 a nation which has experienced so much should strive
 to follow the paths of peace. Russia's adherence to the
 Five. Principles of peaceful co-existence formulated by.
 our Prime Minister Nehru on the basis of Indian expe-
 rience has created a highly favourable international at-
 mosphere for successful co-existence. Since the consoli-
 dation of India's freedom the bonds of friendship between
 our countries have grown stronger. We saw how heartily
 the people of Russia welcomed our Prime Minister when
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 he visited that country. We hope th:t your visit to In-
 dia will bring our countries still closer together to their
 mutual benefit. We honour Your Excellencies as worthy
 leaders and faithful servants of your people. You, Mr.
 Bulganin, have risen to a high post thanks to your out-
 standing qualities and devotion to your country. You have
 had a long and distinguished career. Having begun it at
 the age of 22, in the period of the revolutionary movement,
 you have played an  outstanding role in your country's
 development. The fact that you were Mayor of Moscow
 from 1931 until 1938 is particularly gratifying to our
 corporation, for it establishes bonds of  kinship between
 our two cities. You rendered outstanding services to your
 country in the difficult years of the Second World War.
 In March 1947 you were appointed Minister of the Armed
 Forces of the U.S.S.R. and Vice-Chairman of the Council
 of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.; in March 1953 you were appoint-
 ed First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the
 U.S.S.R. and Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union.
 Your country has conferred on you the title of Hero of So-
 cialist Labour and decorated you with the Orders of the Red
 Banner, Suvorov, Kutuzov, and the Red Star. Your elec-
 tion as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by the session
 of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. on February 8, 1955,
 marks the highest point in your distinguished career and
 testifies to the trust which the people of Russia place in you.
 Our city greets you, Mr. Khrushchov, as another outstand-
 ing Soviet leader. Born into a working-class family, you
 have devoted your energies to a great cause and have earned
 the trust, respect and admiration of your people. You be-
 gan your career as a worker in a mine in the Donbas, and
 you fought heroically on the Southern Front during the
 Civil War. Since then you have done a great deal of impor-
 tant and responsible work for your country. During the

 Second World War you were a member of the Military
 Council of theKiev?Area. In 1952 you were elected a member
 of the Presidium of"the Central Committee of the Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union, and Secretary of that Committee.
 Today you are one of the most experienced and respected
 members of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. Your grateful country has rewarded you with
 high honours: Orders of Lenin, Orders of Suvorov, the Or-
 der of the Red Banner of Labour; on your 60th birthday,
 in April 1954, it conferred on you the title of Hero of So-
 cialist Labour.
 I hope you have a pleasant stay in our city and in our
 country. We also hope that your visit will still further
 strengthen our common determination to fight for peace
 and the happiness of mankind.
 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGIANIN
 Mr. Mayor,
 Dear friends,
 Allow me on my own behalf, on behalf of Comrade Ni-
 kita Sergeyevich Khrushchov and the friends who have
 come with us to India, and on behalf of the many millions
 of Soviet people to convey ardent greetings to you. Our
 hearty thanks to you, the many thousands of citizens of
 this wonderful city who have come here to express their
 friendly feelings of love to the representatives of the Soviet
 people. Such a welcome is striking evidence of the fact that
 in your great city the Soviet Union has many good friends
 who appreciate the friendship between our peoples. (Stormy
 applause.)
 The name of the city of Bombay is well known to Soviet
 men and women. We know it as a big modern city, as a
 major industrial centre, as an important seat of science and
 culture, and, lastly, as one of the world's biggest ports. The

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 glory of Bombay throughout many generations has been
 created by the intensive labour of the ordinary Indian work-
 ing men. It is they who have built its factories and mills,
 railways, beautiful edifices. It is they who have worked and
 are working at industrial establishments producing goods
 generally known beyond the bounds of India.
 Bombay is one of the centres of the creative endeavours
 of the Indian people, their national pride. Here the Indian
 people have demonstrated with special clarity that they,
 like other peoples of Asia, are successfully mastering the
 highest achievements of world culture and science, are build-
 ing up a modern industry and developing modern means
 of communication.
 Your city played a considerable part in the Indian na-
 tional liberation movement which enabled India to rid
 herself of colonial oppression and gain long-awaited freedom.
 The Soviet people always followed that struggle of the
 Indian people with great attention and sympathy. As early
 as 1908 Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, our leader and the founder of
 our socialist state, uttered prophetic words about the inev-
 itable crash of the colonial regime in India. His remark-
 able words have come true.
 India is now an independent country. Her people are
 in a position to shape their destiny as they wish. The sig-
 nificance of this goes far beyond the bounds of India. It
 reflects the great changes now taking place in Asia, where
 the colonial regimes forced on the peoples from outside are
 collapsing. We are glad to observe the great constructive
 work in which the Indian people are engaged. You have set
 yourselves a very important aim, namely, to make your
 country economically independent.
 Our Soviet people know from their own experience how
 tremendously important it is to achieve that aim. The So-
 viet Union fully sympathizes with the legitimate desire
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of the people of India to gain economic independence and
 is prepared to co-operate with India in the sphere of eco-
 nomic development. We are in favour of expanding econom-
 ic intercourse with India, of extending trade between
 our countries, of exchanging scientific and technical achieve-
 ments, and of constructive and mutually beneficial co-
 operation.
 In its foreign policy the Government of the U.S.S.R.
 invariably follows the principle of peaceful co-existence
 of countries with different social systems which was put
 forward by the great Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The foreign
 policy of the Soviet Union is a policy of further relaxing
 world tension, promoting confidence among states in the
 interests of adjusting and settling international problems
 through  negotiations, and ensuring universal  security
 and a firm and lasting peace. The Soviet Union actively ad-
 vocates broad international co-operation, the expansion of
 economic, scientific, technical and cultural contacts between
 all countries whatever their social systems.
 The Soviet people are deeply satisfied to note that the
 peoples of India are in the vanguard of the champions
 of peaceful co-existence. It was India which first proclaimed
 the Panch Shila, the Five Principles of peaceful co-operation
 among countries. (Stormy applause.) One cannot fail to pay
 particular tribute in this connection to the outstanding role
 of that distinguished political leader, the Prime Minister
 of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, whose name is closely associated
 with the struggle of the peoples for peace, for translating
 into life the principles of peaceful co-existence among na-
 tions. The Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru,
 is quite right in pointing out that co-existence is the only
 wise possibility for all countries, for the only other alterna-
 tive would be mutual annihilation. In this connection I
 wish to say that the Government of the U.S.S.R. deeply
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 respects the position of the Government of India, which has
 come out for the reduction of armaments, the prohibition
 of atomic weapons, the removal of the threat of another war
 and the settlement of all international problems through
 negotiations, and against the formation of aggressive mili-
 tary blocs. The Soviet people are well aware of the Indian
 Government's efforts to achieve a further easing of world
 tension and a strengthening of peace.
 The Soviet people welcome India's contribution to peace
 and to the settlement of the outstanding problems of Asia.
 It was through the combined efforts of the People's Repub-
 lic of China, India and the Soviet Union that the wars in
 Korea and Indo-China were ended. (Stormy applause.) The
 Soviet Union and India are working jointly for the People's
 Republic of China to be granted its rightful seat in the Unit-
 ed Nations. The Government of India advocates a peaceful
 settlement of the Taiwan question with due regard for the
 national interests of the Chinese people. India was one of the
 sponsors of the first Asian and African conference in Bandung,
 which is of outstanding significance for strengthening world
 peace and guaranteeing the rights and interests of the peoples
 of Asia and Africa.
 The fact that the interests of the Soviet Union and India
 in preserving and strengthening world peace coincide pre-
 determines the friendly co-operation of our countries on
 many international problems. This is in line with our com-
 mon interest in providing the necessary conditions for the
 prosperity of our countries.
 We have something to learn from each other in the field
 of science. Indian science has an ancient history. It has
 given the world a number of eminent scientists whose dis-
 coveries have enriched world science and culture.  Your
 science maintains these good traditions today, too.
 Many foreign scientists come to the Soviet Union. Scien-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 tists of your city, which is one of the country's leading
 scientific centres, have also visited us.
 We believe that our Soviet scientists, on their part, can
 learn many useful things in India. Such exchange of scien-
 tific achievements and scientific co-operation are very use-
 ful both for your scientists and for ours.
 Living and working in your city, which is one of the
 leading cultural centres, are, for instance, many well-known
 writers and workers in the arts who are known and loved
 in the Soviet Union. Bombay is the centre of India's
 film- industry. Several Indian films made in Bombay have
 been shown in the Soviet Union. Soviet audiences liked
 them very much. This fact alone shows what an important
 role your city can play in promoting cultural interchange
 between our countries, for which we have vast and as yet
 unused opportunities. This interchange will contribute to
 still closer friendship between our countries, our peoples.
 In conclusion, allow me to wish success to your city and
 state, to your great people. That is the wish of the entire
 Soviet people, who love and value their Indian friends.
 (Applause.) It is with attention and joy that the Soviet people
 are following the Indian people's battle for peace and their
 efforts in building a new life, and the friendship of our great
 peoples is a firm bulwark of world peace. Let us, then, pre-
 serve and strengthen this great friendship. (Stormy applause.)
 Long live the friendship of the Indian and Soviet peoples!
 (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY

 Bombay and the Mayor of the city of Bombay for the hos-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 pitality they have accorded us. (Applause.) Allow me to
 thank all of you who' have come here to meet us. Allow me
 to thank also all the citizens of Bombay who came out today
 to welcome us and who, I saw it in their eyes, were so sincere
 in expressing their sentiments towards us, towards the Soviet
 Union, towards our people. (Prolonged applause.)
 Words cannot express the warm feelings with which our
 hearts overflow in these days of friendly meetings with the
 Indian people. (Applause.)
 We rejoice at your initial successes and we wish you still
 greater successes. We are glad that the peoples of India have
 freed themselves  and  acquired national  independence.
 (Applause.)
 There is deep and thoroughgoing understanding between
 us. We are fighting together for peace. (Stormy applause.)
 I should like to say a few words in this connection about what
 the Soviet people understand by fighting for peace. (Ap-
 plause.)
 If you ask anybody in the world today whether he is
 for peace or for war, he will certainly say he is for peace!
 (Applause.) Even he who is for war at heart will not say it
 openly. He would prefer to declare that he stands for peace.
 He knows that the peoples do not want war and that it is
 dangerous to speak up openly for war. (Applause.)
 Some of those who now say that they, too, stand for peace
 would certainly not be averse to achieving without war the
 aims they set themselves. What they would like to have is
 a peace in which some peoples submitted to others. But that
 is not what the peoples want. This is the crux of the matter
 and the key to all the differences.
 You know that the Heads of Government of the Four
 Powers met at Geneva and that later the Foreign Ministers
 of the Four Powers met there. Much effort was made to
 achieve agreement but the results are very small so far. That

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 is because we understand the same words to mean different
 things.
 As for the Soviet people, our understanding is clear and
 understandable to all. We say: peace for all the peoples of
 the world! (Stormy applause.) We say: there should be no
 interference  in  the  internal  arrangements  of  other
 states and peoples. (Stormy applause.) That is the main
 thing.
 We are working for these principles which have been
 set out so very well in the Statement proclaimed by India
 and China and known to all. (Applause.)
 Like all Soviet men and women, I am certain that truth
 will prevail, that peace will prevail. (Stormy applause.)
 But we must exert all our efforts towards that. We must not
 slacken our perseverance, we must not relax our efforts in
 working for world peace. (Applause.)
 Ladies and gentlemen, friends, we live in happy times.
 This is the spring-time of mankind, when colonial slavery
 is crumbling and there is no return to the past.
 We are travelling now through the cities and villages
 of India, and meeting the Indian people. We see how bright-
 ly sparkle the eyes of the free men who have won their coun-
 try's independence and who want to be the masters of their
 state, of their destinies.
 This outstanding. fact is appraised in different ways. As
 for the peoples of the Soviet Union, they sincerely welcome
 those successes. We rejoice that the peoples of great China
 won a great historic victory, cast off for ever the yoke of
 the imperialists and are building their great people's state.
 We rejoice that the peoples of great India have won national
 independence. All the peoples of Asia and Africa are now ris-
 ing to fight against colonial slavery. That is an ocean wave
 which nothing can block! (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 The peoples_ of the Soviet Union stretch out a hand of

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 fraternal and everlasting friendship to the peoples of India.
 (Prolonged applause.)
 Our stand has been, and is, that the internal structure
 of states should be a matter for the peoples themselves to
 decide. We do not interfere, nor shall we over interfere, in
 anybody else's affairs. You and we have very many inter-
 ests in common on which there is complete understanding
 between us. On the basis of this understanding, on the basis
 of mutual respect, we should cement our friendship for the
 sake of world peace.
 As we visit  Indian towns and villages these days I often
 hear fine words with which I agree entirely. And it is with
 these words that I would like to close my speech today:
 "Hindi  Rusi        bha'i bha'il"  (Indians and Russians are
 brothers!) (The concluding words of N. S. Khrushchov aroused
 prolonged, stormy applause.)

 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN
 AT RECEPTION GIVEN BY M. DESAI,
 CHIEF MINISTER OF THE STATE
 OF BOMBAY
 November 24
 Mr. Chief Minister, Member3 of the Bombay State Legis-
 lative Assembly,
 First of all I should like to express my gratitude for your
 hospitality. Allow me to express personally and on behalf
 of Comrade Khrushchov and the friends who have come with
 us, our sincere gratitude for the warm-nay, I would say
 more than warm-for your friendly welcome, for a wel-
 come usually accorded only to one's closest friends. (Ap-
 plause.)
 We have been instructed by the Soviet Government, and
 this instruction reflects the will of the entire Soviet people,
 to convey to the Indian people the Soviet people's warmest
 and fondest regards. (Applause.)
 We do not doubt that our visit to the Republic of India
 will still further consolidate the friendship of our two peo-
 ples-the great Indian people and the great Soviet people.
 (Applause.) Both the Soviet people and the Indians desire
 peace, want to live in tranquillity and to work fruitfully
 for the happiness of the future generations. The stronger
 our friendship is, the more enduring will peace be, thegreat-
 er will be the hope of a lasting peace. (Stormy applause.)
 You and we are people of the 20th century and there is
 one very happy thing we have in common: we live in an age
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 In which the consciousness of the peoples has grown im-
 measurably, in which they are taking their destiny into their
 own hands and starting to build a new life, guided by the
 teachings of the men whom they look up to as their teachers.
 You had an outstanding leader who did much for your
 country. I am speaking of Mahatma Gandhi, who is held in
 high esteem in your country as a glorious patriot and friend
 of the people. We pay due tribute to his memory and to the
 work of his successor, Jawaharlal Nehru. (Applause.)
 We, Soviet people, are guided by the teachings of the great
 Lenin who showed us and all the other peoples the way to
 freedom, independence and happiness.
 We, Lenin's pupils, do not share Gandhi's philosophical
 views, but we consider him an outstanding leader who did
 much for the development of a peace-loving attitude in your
 people and for their struggle for independence.
 It was only after our people had freed themselves from
 capitalist oppression that they were able to embark on the
 building of a free and independent country and improving
 their welfare. It was only after India had gained her inde-
 pendence that new possibilities and new prospects opened
 up for her development.
 The peoples inhabiting this nlobe are all striving for peace
 and are fully resolved to ensure that the future generations
 may work and live in tranquillity and happiness. But let us
 not speak now of the tasks facing all the peoples. Let us
 speak only of the task facing our two peoples: the great In-
 dian people and the great Soviet people. Let us then say:
 Long live lasting peace between our peoples! Long live
 enduring and indestructible friendship between the Indian
 and Soviet peoples! (Stormy applause.)

 RECEPTION IN THE INDO-SOVIET
 CULTURAL SOCIETY
 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN
 Friends, allow me first of all to thank you for the cordial
 and ardent welcome you have given us.
 It was not without emotion that we approached the bor-
 ders of your country. It was not without emotion that we
 set foot on Indian soil, in your admirable city of Delhi, the
 capital of your country.
 We have come here to acquaint ourselves with your coun-
 try, with your people, with you.
 Having been several days in your country, I must say
 that at our meetings with the Indian people, with their
 representatives and with the Indian authorities, and at this
 meeting with you today we have been deeply stirred by the
 cordiality and friendship shown us. We feel here as if we were
 at home, among close friends. (Stormy applause.)
 Tcday we are the guests of the Indo-Soviet Cultural So-
 ciety. The very name of your society speaks of its aims and
 objects.
 In recent years quite a number of delegations and individ-
 ual representatives of the great people of India have been
 to the Soviet Union. Many people from the Soviet Union
 have been to India.
 The Soviet Union has received visits from Indian scien-
 tists, writers, many public figures, cinema workers, actors
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 and producers. Many of them are now very, very popular
 among the Soviet people. We have seen many here with whom
 we are personally acquainted. (Applause.)
 We are happy to be at this meeting. We address our grat-
 itude today to the respected President of your society, Dr.
 Baliga, who directs its activities-We are also grateful to the
 Governor of Bombay State, Mr. Mehtab, for making it
 possible for us to be present here at this wonderful gathering.
 I propose a toast to the continued expansion of the activ-
 ities of the Indo-Soviet Cultural Society. I drink to the
 health of its President, Dr. Baliga, and to the health of the
 Governor of Bombay State, Mr. Mehtab.
 Long live Indo-Soviet friendship! (Prolonged applause.)
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHIIUSHCHOY
 Friends, I permit myself to call you friends because we are
 here at a meeting of a society whose object it is to promote
 and strengthen friendly relations between India and the So-
 viet Union. (Applause.)
 Like my friend Bulganin, I want to thank the President
 of your society, Dr. Baliga, and the Governor of Bombay
 State, Mr. Mehtab, who is assisting the work of your society
 and who has graciously invited us to your fine city. (Ap-
 plause.)
 I also address my thanks to the Chief Minister of your
 State, Mr. Desai. (Prolonged applause.) I thank you all
 for coming here to meet us. (Applause.)
 Sometimes, when beginning a speech, you involuntarily
 feel excited, until you get down to your subject and can
 smoothly develop your speech. (Animation and applause.)
 It seems to me that on this occasion a very good subject
 would be friendship between nations. There are different
 kinds of friendship. There is the friendship of people who
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 are close companions, and there is the "friendship" of people
 who are neighbours but are not on visiting terms. (Laugh-
 ter and applause.) So it is with countries. Between some of
 them there is no real friendship, but they live on one planet,
 and whether they like it or not they have to get on
 together.
 That is the kind of relationship which our great Lenin
 called co-existence. The principle of co-existence is a very
 important principle. But there are people who ask: is co-
 existence possible? One would think that there cannot be
 any such question, since states co-exist in practice. (Ani-
 mation.) But the question is asked. all the same.
 What I want to say is this. The birth of a child depends
 on the parents. But the day and hour it is born does not de-
 pend on them, nor whether it will be the kind of child they
 would like it to be. (Animation.) How is it possible to halt
 the development of history, to prevent the birth of new so-
 cial forms? Just as the sun rises every morning, so obsolete
 social forms are supplanted by new and more progressive
 ones. (Prolonged applause.)
 Well, that is how our Soviet state was born. It was the
 first proletarian state, the first workers' and peasants' state
 in the world. (Applause.) The appearance of this state was
 greeted by all other states without the ringing of bells.
 (Animation.)
 Since the old, tsarist system in Russia was rotten through
 and through, the October Revolution was almost bloodless.
 But then they came along and said to us-not in so many
 words, of course, and without a protocol-but by their
 actions: How's this? Who authorized the Soviet state to
 appear? By what right have the workers and peasants taken
 the power into their own hands? (Animation.)
 They not only said this, but hurled their armies against
 the young Soviet state. The French interventionists landed
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 in Odessa, the British in Arkhangelsk, the American in
 Vladivostok, and the Japanese followed suit.
 Everybody knows what came of this. The Soviet people
 swept out the invading forces, as a good housewife sweeps
 the dust out of her cottage. (Animation and stormy applause.)
 But this did not seem enough to some gentry. They wanted
 a repetition, and instigated the Second World War. They
 hurled the big armed forces of Hitler Germany against the
 U.S.S.R.
 How this ended is also known to all. Again the Soviet
 Union defeated its enemies. But far from being weakened
 by the war, the U.S.S.R. acquired even greater strength.
 (Applause.) Now the Soviet people have healed the wounds
 of the war, repaired their shattered economy, successfully
 fulfilled their first postwar five-year plan, and are now on
 the point of fulfilling their second postwar five-year plan.
 Our country is rapidly developing and blossoming luxu-
 riantly.
 I remember the early days of the October Revolution,
 and the years of the Civil War, when only Lenin clearly
 foresaw our future development and how powerful the new-
 born Soviet state would become.
 An absolute majority of those present here are members
 of the intelligentsia. I should therefore like to tell you how
 the revolution was greeted at that time by the intelligentsia
 of Russia. Many intellectuals welcomed the revolution and
 honestly began to serve the young Soviet state. But some
 of them argued as follows. What is going to happen? Lenin
 and the Communists have summoned the workers and peas-
 ants to rule the country. The guidance of the country is in
 the hands of illiterate workers and still more illiterate peas-
 ants. What will become of Russian culture? Who will
 be the connoisseurs of Russian art? Presumably, there will
 be no more Russian ballet, which was world-famous even
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 before the. revolution. Presumably, there will be no more
 opera, which was also on a high level before the revolution.
 Presumably, the other arts will likewise go under. There
 will be no real. connoisseurs!.  .
 But developments belied these misgivings. Soviet culture
 is much superior to the culture of the old Russia. Many of you
 have been to the Soviet Union in late years. You have seen
 with your own eyes that art. in the Soviet Union is more
 highly appreciated than it ever was before the revolution.
 The workers and peasants singled out the finest among their
 number and sent them to university and college, and, what
 is more, they themselves at the bench acquired culture.
 We are proud of this.
 Whether our ill-wishers like it or not, the Soviet Union
 exists. And not only does it exist; it is successfully growing
 and developing. Our economy is expanding, our culture is
 progressing, the living standards of our people are rising.
 And all this at a time when we are compelled to reckon
 with. the existence of hostile forces who have still not given up
 the idea of strangling our country. We are obliged to spend
 quite considerable funds on national defence. If we could
 divert the funds now spent on armaments to peaceful pur-
 poses, the living standards of our people would be even higher.
 This our ill-wishers realize. And that is why certain polit-
 ical leaders abroad are afraid to talk seriously of disarma-
 ment, and do not want to put an end to international ten-
 sion. They are afraid we might use the funds now spent
 on defence for peaceful construction.
 But despite this, we are confident that, even as things are
 now, in peaceful competition between the capitalist and
 socialist systems, it is we, socialism, that will win. (Pro-
 longed applause.)
 I happened to say this publicly at one of the receptions
 in the Kremlin. The bourgeois correspondents blazoned it
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 around the world that Khrushchov had been "incautious"
 and let out that the Bolsheviks had not abandoned their
 political plans. No, I was not incautious and did not let
 out anything, but said what we think and what we con-
 fidently believe. We have never abandoned, and never
 will abandon, our political line, which was mapped by
 Lenin; we have never abandoned, and never will abandon,
 our political programme. (Prolonged applause.)
 As our proverb has it: you don't leave a good life to look
 for a bad one! (Animation.)
 Why should we abandon that which has led our country
 from age-old backwardness to the level of the industrially
 and economically most advanced and developed countries?
 Why? What have we to gain by abandoning it?
 And so we say to tha gentry who are expecting the Soviet
 Union to change its political programme: "Wait until the
 crab whistles!" And you know when the crab whistles. (Ani-
 mation.)
 Hence, there is only one possibility-co-existence. Co-
 existence of the two systems. Co-existence of the socialist
 and capitalist systems.
 I, personally, dislike very much the capitalist system.
 (Applause.) I speak of co-existence not because I want capi-
 talism to exist, but because I cannot help recognizing that
 this system does exist. (Animation.)
 But the other side refuses to reconcile itself to the existence
 of the socialist system, though it is not only we that have
 built a socialist state; many other countries have embarked
 on the same path. Socialism is being built by our close friend,
 the great Chinese people-and that is a state which, as
 the saying goes, you cannot step over without noticing.
 Socialism is being built by a whole number of European
 and Asian countries, which stand shoulder to shoulder with
 the Soviet Union.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 The Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, has said that
 India will also follow the socialist path. (Stormy applause.)
 That is good. Of course, our conceptions of socialism differ.
 But we welcome this statement and this intention.
 And so, the socialist system exists, and does not ask any-
 body's permission to do so. (Animation and applause.) We
 not only exist, but can well defend our existence.
 If we had confined ourselves to pleading for co-existence,
 we should have been crushed long ago.
 Our enemies might like very much to see the end of us,
 but that is not in their power. (Prolonged applause.)
 Hence, like it or not, love it or not, the socialist and capi-
 talist states have to live together on one planet.
 We say to the capitalist countries: If you don't like us,
 don't have us as your guests, but we will exist all the same.
 Such is the situation in the present-day world.
 We want such co-existence as will facilitate normal de-
 velopment of relations between all states. We want, in par-
 ticular, to trade with all countries. Let them buy from us,
 and we shall buy from them.
 Just now they are trying to practise trade discrimination
 against us, and do not want to trade with us in important
 items. But our country is developing and growing stronger
 all the same. And between you and me,. their discrimination
 has only induced us to bend our efforts to produce those
 items which the capitalists are unwilling to sell us. We now
 produce these items ourselves, and are moving ever onward.
 Consequently,  the trade discrimination policy has not
 harmed, but even benefited us.
 We stand for broader cultural intercourse between coun-
 tries. We want more people from the capitalist countries to
 come to us, and more of our people to go to these countries.
 We have been accused of erecting an "iron curtain." But
 only this year a large number of U.S. senators have visited
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the U.S.S.R., and quite a number of American scientists
 and press representatives, also American and British farm-
 ers, and American war veterans.
 We do not refusevisas to thosewho wish to visit our country.
 You are probably acquainted with the biblical legend
 about Noah's ark. When Noah gathered the beasts into
 his ark, he took of those that were clean by seven pairs and
 of those that were not clean by two pairs. Well, I can tell
 you it was mostly the unclean that came to our country,
 but we received them without fear. (Animation.)
 The way we looked at it was, suppose an unclean one- does
 come-he won't dirty us.
 Hence, if international cultural intercourse is not devel-
 oping as fast as one would like, we are not to blame.
 These are a few aspects of the question of peaceful co-
 existence. I think that if a classical example of co-existence
 is needed, it is provided by our relations with India. Not
 only do we co-exist; we are friends, despite our different
 political views on a number of questions. The basis of this
 friendship is our common effort for peace. We must therefore
 not relax this effort. Let us continue to break down every-
 thing that stands in the way of peaceful co-existence. Let us
 promote everything that facilitates the development of
 peaceful co-existence of states.
 We have had a small, perhaps microscopic, success in
 this respect as a result of the Geneva meetings. The Four
 Power Foreign Ministers Conference has just ended. It did not
 produce the results that might have been expected. But
 we are not particularly discouraged. Evidently, the time
 had not yet come. The question was not ripe for decision.
 And our partners had not given up the idea of negotiating
 from so-called "positions of strength."
 I must again frankly warn that anyone who tries to speak
 to us from "positions of strength" will get nowhere.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Well, it looks as if we shall have to wait for the settle-
 ment of the questions which were brought before Geneva.
 Well, we are prepared to wait. The wind, as they say, is not
 blowing in our faces. We shall wait for fairer weather. We
 shall wait until these questions can be settled in the inter-
 est of the people.
 When I was already in India, I read the speeches of a
 number of statesmen assessing the results of the Geneva
 Conference. I am glad that the statements of the partici-
 pants in the conference were restrained. This presumably
 indicates that they did not want just now to give rein to
 passions that would aggravate international tension.
 I am concluding. There must be co-existence. We do not
 demand it or request it; we really exist, just as capitalist
 states really exist. Nobody can transplant us to Mars-what
 is more, the scientists have not discovered the means of
 doing so. Presumably, the capitalist states do not want
 to transplant themselves to Mars either. (Animation.) Con-
 sequently, we have to live on one planet. And living means
 co-existing.
 That being so, the task is to prevent the aggressive forces
 from  unleashing another war.
 The work of your society furthers the solution of the
 problem of peaceful co-existence. The better we know each
 other, the closer we co-operate, the more we help each
 other, the stronger will be the forces of peace, and this
 will act as a restrain on the aggressive forces. Aggressors,
 you know, cannot be weaned from aggressiveness, they can
 only be restrained by active efforts, by an active struggle
 of the peoples for peace. (Applause.)
 I propose a toast to all present here-to all who are
 working might and main in this direction. I propose a
 toast to friendship. Your health, friends! (Stormy and
 prolonged applause.)

 MASS RALLY OF CITIZENS OF POONA
 IN HONOUR OF
 N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. IIHRUSHCHOV
 November 25
 ADDRESS OF CITIZENS OF POONA READ
 BY MAYOR B. N. SANAS
 On behalf of the people and the municipal corporation
 I gladly, from the bottom of my heart, welcome Mr. Bulganin
 and Mr. Khrushchov and their companions. This is truly
 a festive day in the history of our city. The visit 'of the
 Russian leaders is a historic event; our comrades crossed
 the Himalayas to pay us this visit.
 The inhabitants of Poona are happy that during their
 short stay in India our guests have found time to visit
 our city. I hope that even in these brief hours of their stay
 here we shall be able to win their favour.
 The Soviet Union is one of the greatest countries in the
 world.  It emancipated its peoples from age-old tsarist
 oppression. The people's revolution in Russia has its paral-
 lels in other parts of the world.
 Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi we, on our
 part, launched a peaceful struggle and won our freedom.
 British imperialist colonialism has departed from our ter-
 ritory.
 Today we can with full justification recall the heroic
 Russian defence of Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad against
 the monstrous forces of Hitler. Under the leadership of
 Stalin our guests guided and inspired the Soviet people to
 fight to the last drop of blood. They helped to destroy the

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 spectre of Nazi imperialism. That is why we are happy
 that you, gentlemen, are here today among us. Only five
 months ago our beloved Prime Minister had the opportunity
 to visit your country. The great Soviet people welcomed
 him everywhere he went, welcomed him with all their hearts.
 We shall not forget that friendship and love for our Prime
 Minister and for us. Your visit to India will bring our na-
 tions still closer together. If representatives of the coun-
 tries of the world were to meet and hold talks as often as
 possible, it would undoubtedly promote mutual under-
 standing, peace and the prosperity of the nations. The So-
 viet Union and the Republic of India have a total popula-
 tion of 550 million people whose sole desire is to ensure the
 nations of the world peace and friendship.
 Mr. Mayor, dear friends,
 Allow me to convey ardent greetings from the Soviet
 people to you and, through you, to the entire population
 of Poona.
 Your city has glorious historical traditions. In the past
 it was the capital of the courageous and intrepid Marathas,
 who bravely defended their country's national independence
 against foreign invaders. Here, not far from Poona, coura-
 geous Maratha soldiers waged battles against the colonial-
 ists. Your forefathers did not shed their blood in vain.
 The memory of their deeds has always inspired the Indian
 people's struggle for national liberation. The aspirations of
 your brave forefathers have come true: India has become
 an independent state.
 Now the Indian people are gradually turning historic
 Poona into a city of science and learning. The university,
 the colleges, the observatory, the National Academy of

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Defence, the water and power research station-all these
 are centres of high culture and education of the youth.
 May the noble, freedom-loving Maratha traditions of
 yesteryear live on for ever in Poona, and may the contem-
 porary culture of the Maratha people develop ever broader
 and broader.
 May friendship between the Soviet and Indian peoples
 grow and strengthen. We shall work together for a lasting
 and stable world peace, for friendship among all nations.
 Allow me to thank you for the warm welcome you have

 N. A. ~ BULGANIN AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 IN BANGALORE
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY AT CITY RALLY
 November 26
 Friends, brothers,
 Allow me on behalf of myself personally, of my friend,
 Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, and of all the friends
 accompanying us on this wonderful tour of your great coun-
 try, to thank you for the invitation which has enabled us
 to visit your State of Mysore and the splendid city of Ban-
 galore. (Applause.)
 I want also to express our gratitude to the Rajpramukh
 of Mysore, Mr. Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar Bahadur, the
 Chief Minister, Mr. K. Hanumanthaiya, and the Mayor of
 the city, Mr. V. P. Deenadayalu Naidu, for having said
 such kind things about our country, about the achieve-
 ments of the Soviet Union. (Applause.)
 We have now been several days in your great country.
 Our tour and our acquaintance with India are going so
 swiftly and eventfully that we have lost count of the days.
 This morning, for instance, Nikolai Alexandrovich and
 I had an argument about what day this is-Saturday or
 Sunday. (Animation and laughter.)
 In the few days we have been in India we have seen much
 and learned much. We have accumulated a mass of impres-
 sions. Today we drove about your fine city. Howmany people,
 young and old, came out into the streets, what cries of

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 welcome expressing the friendship and regard of the
 Indian people for the peoples of the Soviet Union! (Ap-
 plause.)
 We should be very petty indeed if we thought that the
 friendship and regard manifested by the Indian people were
 meant for me, my friend, Nikolai Alexandrovich, and the
 other friends who have come here with us. They express
 the love and respect of the Indian people for the peoples of
 the Soviet Union.
 What have- the peoples of the Soviet Union done to deserve
 the deep affection and warm gratitude of the great people
 of India?
 I ask this question because the appearance of our Soviet
 state, a state organized on new principles, was greeted by
 the capitalist world very ungraciously, indeed with hostil-
 ity.  But despite this, our state steadily grew and devel-
 oped.
 We have advanced a very long way since the establishment
 of the Soviet state. The great Lenin, and the Communist
 Party he founded, issued the call for peace and for the build-
 ing of a new society in our country, and this call was taken
 up by all the peoples. In the early period of Soviet govern-
 ment, our country was poverty-stricken and devastated.
 Industry was in a state of disruption. Most of the population
 was illiterate. And in these conditions it needed Lenin's
 vision, his boldness and perspicacity, to foresee the great
 future of the new-born workers' and peasants' state, and to
 win the following of all the peoples of our country.
 At that time our enemies said that before a year was
 out the Soviet state would collapse and Lenin and the
 Bolsheviks would have nothing for their pains.
 Well, what do you think now? Do these gentry qualify
 as prophets, or have they no place among the prophets?
 (Animation.)

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Far from collapsing, the Soviet country, as you know,
 grew into a mighty power, with a powerful industry and a
 highly developed economy.
 Wherein lies the strength of our Soviet state? After all,
 it came into being against the opposition of all the capi-
 talist countries. It received no assistance or capital from
 anyone. On the contrary, everything was done to prevent
 us, the Soviet people, from building up the Soviet state.
 Wars and economic blockades were organized against us,
 and every other obstacle was put in our way. Yet, despite
 all this, our country grew stronger from year to year, built
 mills and factories, universities, colleges and schools, raised
 its cultural standards, and moved steadily forward.
 Now the Soviet Union can compare favourably with any
 capitalist country as regards the number of intellectuals,
 of engineers.
 Well, then, wherein lies our strength? Our strength lies
 in the people. The people are the chief capital. They are
 the makers of everything mankind has produced.
 We know from our own experience that if a people has
 won the freedom of its country, it may be illiterate today
 but will be literate tomorrow. A man may be illiterate to-
 day, but tomorrow he will not only be literate; he may be-
 come an engineer or a scientist.
 In the early years of Soviet government, we had no intel-
 ligentsia of our own. Now we have a numerous people's
 intelligentsia, an intelligentsia that has come from the ranks
 of the workers and peasants. (Applause.) This, friends,
 we consider one of our biggest achievements. (Applause.)
 Why is it that you applaud us so heartily and greet us
 so amicably? For, you know, there are some who abuse us.
 I shall not go in for propaganda and name those who abuse
 us. You read the newspapers, and you know what some of
 the representatives of the bourgeois press are writing about
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 our tour of India. But you don't believe them. You don't
 believe them because you know that all the nasty things
 they write about us are sheer slander. (Applause.)
 And we say to these hacks: Write what you like, say
 what you like-dirt does not stick to the clean. (Anima-
 tion.) We have a folk saying I should like to cite: a man
 passes, the dog barks, the bark is carried away by the wind,
 the man goes on his way. (Laughter.)
 And we, too, are going on our way, a way which human-
 ity has never yet followed-the way of socialist con-
 struction. Our country is paving the way to a bright future
 for all mankind.
 Our people are building a communist society, and they
 will achieve their goal-they will build communism!
 You may respond in different ways to our ideas.  Your
 conceptions and ours may differ on a number of questions.
 You must choose your own path of development, that which
 pleases you most. Not only shall we not try to deter you;
 we shall assist you in the good work of developing your coun-
 try, for the benefit of your great and noble people. (Applause.)
 We say, perhaps there is something in our practical expe-
 rience that may suit you. If so, use it; if not, don't. We
 do not force anything upon anyone; we are not seeking to
 impose any political obligations. Why do we say this to you
 so frankly? Because our attitude towards you is sincere,
 as towards brothers. (Applause.)
 We feel that your welcome to us is a special one. We have
 visited many Indian towns and villages and have seen much.
 India today resembles a mighty current that has broken
 down the obstacles in its way and spread far and wide.
 That current makes the old world tremble. But we are
 glad that the Indian people have broken out of colonial
 slavery, that India has embarked on the path of independent
 development.  (Applause.)

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Why, do we feel about India like this, and why are cer-
 tain other countries averse to India's independent develop-
 ment? Because it is not our object to take advantage of the
 weakness of your industrial development; but certain other
 countries want to exploit this weakness for gain.
 We want to see you rapidly building your own wills and
 factories. You showed us today a very fine college. It will
 not be long before you see yourselves that it is a small col-
 lege, that it is only a beginning.
 We sincerely wish that India may become as great and
 strong economically as she is great today in spirit, in cul-
 ture and moral grandeur. We should like her to have a highly
 developed industry, an advanced agriculture and a high
 national standard of living. We, on our part, are ready
 to help you in this good and splendid cause. (Applause.)
 Friends, in the speech he made here, the Mayor of your
 city spoke very well about the Five Principles which were
 first proclaimed in the Joint Statement signed by Mr. Nehru
 and our great friend, Chou En-lai. (Applause.) These prin-
 ciples were endorsed in the Soviet-Indian Statement signed in
 Moscow during Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to the Soviet
 Union. It is on this document that we base our relations
 with your country.
 As I have said, there are some points both-of method
 and  theory-on  which we  differ. We do not conceal
 it, nor do you. But this does not prevent us from being friends.
 Why? Because, neither of us has any evil designs on the
 other. You really. are our sincere friends, and we are your
 best friends and brothers. (Applause.) Here we have a graphic
 example of peaceful co-existence of countries with' different
 social systems.
 We propose to all countries: let us live in friendship
 instead of quarrelling and attacking one another in the
 press and public statements. But we also frankly say that
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 we do not like the capitalist method of economic organi-
 zation, just as not everyone likes our methods.
 Let us, we urge the leaders of the capitalist states, prove
 in practice which system is the best. Let us compete without
 war. (Applause.) Is that a bad proposal? It is better, surely,
 than to say, let us compete and see who produces the most
 weapons and who smashes the other. That would be competi-
 tion against the interests of the people, competition in
 annihilating human beings. What we propose is peaceful
 competition in raising the living standards of all peoples.
 We stand, and always shall stand, for such competition as
 will help to promote the prosperity of the peoples, to raise
 their living standards. Therefore, our proposals are very
 clear and comprehensible. They are comprehensible to all
 people. And I am sure that this clear and just position of
 the Soviet Union is welcomed by the Indian people. But we
 must view things soberly and assess the situation correctly.
 Every beast has its own food. The tiger, for example, lives
 on meat, and the buffalo on grass. You cannot force the
 buffalo to feed on meat, nor the tiger to feed on grass. (Anima-
 tion.) I shall not develop this thought any further, so as not
 to be suspected of propaganda. I think you understand it.
 (Animation and applause.)
 Friends, we have put forward very clear proposals on disar-
 mament. The Mayor of your city pointed out here that we
 have reduced our armed forces by 640,000 men. We have
 liquidated our base at Porkkala Udd, in Finland, and
 given up the naval base we had in Port Arthur.
 The Soviet Union has proposed prohibition of the use
 of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and has submitted pro-
 posals on reduction of conventional armaments. We have
 proposed the establishment of effective control. But, they
 say, so long as you do not agree to a form of control which
 will enable the United States to control the territory of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the Soviet Union from the air, and, conversely, the Soviet
 Union to control the territory of the United States, we
 shall have no talks with you on questions of disarmament.
 It is obvious to all that this form of control is unaccept-
 able, because it does not solve the problem. Assume that
 American aircraft begin to fly over the Soviet Union, and
 Soviet aircraft over the United States. What will be the
 use? The aircraft will fly, and the airmen will see: there is
 a town here, a village there; here troops are stationed, there
 some factories are located. Supposing we see that the Ameri-
 cans have a large number of airfields. In that case we shall
 have to conclude that we must make more headway so as
 not to fall behind, and build several more airfields. (Anima-
 tion.) The Americans, in their turn, see what we have, and
 will also say that they must have more airfields and aircraft,
 and perhaps other things too.
 Hence, if we accept this proposal, it. will only only lead to an
 arms race. We say to the Western statesmen: If you are
 afraid to disarm, to destroy your bomb stocks, let us
 pledge our word of honour as gentlemen that none of us
 will ever employ atomic weapons. They reply that they
 cannot pledge their word, because, supposedly, they need
 hydrogen and atomic bombs to maintain "equilibrium."
 And what does this "equilibrium" mean? It means an arms
 race. Hence, considerable resources, a substantial propor-
 tion of the national labour goes not for the peaceful develop-
 ment of the country, but for military purposes. Can we
 continue to reduce armaments unilaterally, when the Western
 Powers do not want to do likewise? I shall answer this
 question in the words of a Russian saying: if you live with
 wolves, you must howl like a wolf. (Animation.)
 If the Western Powers do not want to prohibit the pro-
 duction of atomic and hydrogen weapons, if they do not
 even want to pledge their word to prohibit their employ-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 went, this compels us, too, to produce atomic and hydro-
 gen bombs, rocket weapons and all the other means of anni-
 hilation.
 Today the newspapers in many countries, including some
 Indian newspapers, stated that an atomic bomb was explod-
 ed in the Soviet Union. I shall not say that there was no
 such explosion. (Animation and laughter.) There really was
 an explosion. It was an explosion of incredible power.
 Tomorrow our press will be publishing a statement on the
 subject.
 Lately, in pursuance of a plan of research and experiment
 in atomic energy, new types of atomic and thermonuclear
 (hydrogen) weapons have been tested in our country. The
 tests have fully borne out the computations of our research
 workers. They have, also, demonstrated important  new
 achievements by Soviet scientists and engineers. The latest
 experimental hydrogen bomb explosion was the most power-
 ful explosion carried out so far. Our scientists and engineers
 succeeded, with the use of a comparatively small amount of
 nuclear material, in producing an explosion equal to that
 of several million tons of ordinary explosive. But I declare,
 friends, that the Soviet Union will never abuse its posses-
 sion of these weapons. (Animation and applause.) We
 shall be happy if these bombs never explode over towns
 and villages. (Applause.) Let the bombs lie in storage
 and get on the nerves of those who want to unleash war.
 Let it be known that one cannot unleash war, because if
 he starts war, he can be sure of meeting with a proper re-
 buff. (Animation.)
 We were compelled to develop this terrible type of weap-
 on. It is not this that.enthuses us. We work with greater
 satisfaction on the making of more machines, tractors,
 ploughs, in order to grow more wheat, rice and cotton, and
 in order that our people may have meat, vegetables, fish and

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 other foods in abundance. That is what we want, and that
 is what we are working for. (Applause.)
 To this end, we shall. continue to strive persistently for
 world peace. (Applause.) We shall continue to strive for
 reduction of international tension. (Applause.) We shall strive
 for the ending of the "cold war," and work for the devel-
 opment of trade among all countries. It will be our concern
 to promote friendly international contacts. This is what life
 demands. This is what mankind needs.
 We shall do all that we can for the satisfaction of man's
 requirements. We must not relax our efforts, we must mobilize
 everything necessary to compel the aggressive-minded ele-
 ments in a number of countries to talk less of war, and more
 of contacts, of the promotion of peaceful relations between
 countries and elimination of international tension.
 If I have said anything that may be unpleasant to anyone,
 please forgive me. (Animation and applause.) What I chiefly
 wanted was to express my warm feelings of friendship for
 your great people, to tell you that all the Soviet people
 entertain the most friendly feelings for the peoples of India.
 (Prolonged applause.)
 In conclusion, I should like once again to express our deep
 gratitude and acknowledgements to the Prime. Minister of
 India, Mr. Nehru, that excellent man and distinguished
 statesman who ipvited our delegation to your great and
 hospitable country.. (Applause.)
 Long.live the .fraternal friendship of the peoples of India
 and the Soviet Union!

 RECEPTION GIVEN
 BY K. HANUMANTHAIYA,
 CHIEF MINISTER OF STATE OF MYSORE,
 IN BANGALORE
 November 26
 K. Hanumanthaiya, Chief Minister of the State of Mysore,
 gave a reception in Bangalore on November 26 in honour
 of the Soviet visitors. During the reception Chief Minister
 Hanumanthaiya and N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the
 U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, exchanged speeches.
 "We are happy to welcome among us two such outstanding
 leaders of the U.S.S.R.," K. Hanumanthaiya said. "Your
 arrival in our country has brought joy to 360 million
 Indians. The arrival of such distinguished leaders is indeed
 a historic event. That is particularly true of this case, be-
 cause your arrival is of deep and beneficial import for the
 whole world. Friendship between our two great countries
 is nothing new, but now it is firm and solid.
 "Before the Great October Revolution Russia was in the
 clutches of imperialism and capitalism. Russia was a poor
 country, she was among the backward countries. Now,
 thanks to the leadership of Lenin and his successors, Russia
 has become one of the most powerful and influential coun-
 tries in the world. That the face of an entire huge country has
 been so greatly transformed in the lifetime of a single gener-
 ation is in itself something like a miracle. I trust you are
 gratified by the fact that not only your country alone has
 enjoyed the fruits of your labours. Russia helped to weaken

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the chains of world imperialism and colonialism. Your
 efforts to prevent war and establish a durable peace have
 won you the regard and gratitude of the entire war-weary
 world."
 K. Hanumanthaiya went on to say: "We live in the age of
 the atom. This is a critical moment in the history of man.
 Never before has mankind striven so persistently for peace.
 At this time all your energies are directed towards the
 noble goal of employing atomic energy for the welfare of
 man."
 The Chief Minister emphasized further that the Indians
 were by tradition a peace-loving people. "Having  won
 independence," he said, "India has devoted all her efforts
 to the maintenance of world peace. The meeting between
 India and Russia that your arrival marks is therefore a meet-
 ing of two great forces working for a common aim, for
 the cause of peace. It is this feeling that lies at the bottom
 of the spontaneous outburst of rejoicing called forth by your
 arrival. Your arrival is the prelude to a new great era. We
 have read the speeches made by you in various towns of
 our country, we have heard your assurances that you will
 do everything possible to help the backward countries.
 Your speeches breathe simplicity, courage and modesty,
 they are permeated with brotherly sentiments."
 The Chief Minister also pointed out that th3 State of
 Mysore has a population of 10 millions. "A mere eight
 years have passed," he said, "since we threw off the yoke
 of imperialism and autocrccy. Along with the people of
 the other pzrts of India, we have undertaken to establish
 in our country a society of the socialist type. Your visit
 will undoubtedly be an additional source of inspiration to
 us in the fulfilment of this great task."

 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN
 On behalf of Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchov and on my
 own behalf I thank you, and through you all the citizens
 of Bangalore, for the exceptionally warm welcome given us
 here. We are full of the finest impressions of the industrious
 and gifted people of Mysore, of their great achievements in
 building a new life, and of their wonderful monuments of
 ancient culture created by skilled folk craftsmen.
 To our regret we do not have the time to make a more
 detailed acquaintance with all the aspects of life and many
 places of interest in Mysore, although we should like very
 much to do so. Allow me to express the hope that the con-
 tacts we have made here with the citizens of Bangalore
 will be successfully continued and developed in future.
 There is no need to dwell here on the importance of the
 development of all-round ties between India and the Soviet
 Union. The significance of these ties is very great, and we are
 confident that their extension accords with the interests of
 the peoples of both countries, India and the Soviet Union.
 I should like in this connection to cite one example which
 shows how greatly friendly contacts benefit both our peo-
 ples. Beginning with 1948 delegations of scientists from the
 U.S.S.R. Academy of Science have been taking part annual-
 ly in sessions of the Indian Scientific Congress. In these
 years many Soviet doctors, statisticians, geologists, metal-
 lurgists and other specialists have visited India, and many
 of your scientists have visited the Soviet Union. They have
 exchanged experience and advice, with definite benefit both to
 India and the U.S.S.R.
 In future, too, Indian delegations will have every opportu-
 nity to acquaint themselves with the Soviet Union's indus-
 trial and agricultural development, scientific and engineering
 achievements, public education and the health services,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and achievements in culture and art. They can always count
 on receiving the necessary aid and due attention during
 their stay in the Soviet Union. (Applause.)
 Direct contact and close, broad ties between the Soviet
 and Indian peoples benefit both our countries and promote
 friendship and co-operation between India and the So-
 viet Union. This friendship between our two great peoples
 is an important factor for the promotion of peace and inter-
 national security. Long live the growing friendship between
 the Indian and Soviet peoples! (Applause.)
 Long live world peace! (Stormy applause.)

 PUBLIC RALLY
 IN MADRAS IN HONOUR
 OF N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 November 28
 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN
 Esteemed Mr. Governor,
 Esteemed Mr. Chief Minister,.
 Mr. Mayor,
 Dear friends,
 We gladly accepted the invitation to visit your splendid
 city of Madras. Allow me, on my own behalf, on behalf of
 Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchov- and our friends who have
 arrived together with us, to thank you for the warm reception
 accorded us during our stay in your city. We also thank you
 for the presents you have given us. Allow me also to extend
 to you fervent and friendly greetings from the Soviet people,
 who entertain deep respect for the great and peace-loving
 people of India. (Applause.)
 Before coming to Madras we visited a number of other
 Indian cities. One could speak at length about the impres-
 sions this very useful trip has made on us, but I want to say
 first of all that everywhere in India we have observed an
 irrepressible desire of the people to preserve peace. The indus-
 trious Indian people, who have won national independence
 for their country, are engaged in constructive labour.
 The peoples of the Soviet Union are likewise engaged in
 peaceful constructive labour. They are building a new society
 together with other peace-loving peoples and are fully re-
 solved to prevent another world conflagration from breaking
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 out, because they know from their own experience what war
 is like. Ready at any moment to defend their interests, the
 Soviet people are consistently upholding the cause of peace;
 they are working to ease international tension, to remove
 the danger of another war and assure peaceful co-opera-
 tion between all states, irrespective of their social systems.
 The Soviet people are happy that they have many allies
 in this lofty cause, and among them such a splendid ally
 as the people of your great country.
 Other peoples of Asia who are now living through a great
 turning point in their history are also working to preserve
 a firm and lasting peace. For decades, indeed for centuries,
 the peoples of Asia have groaned under the yoke of foreigners
 and have fought selflessly for their freedom and national
 independence, and now the colonial regime is collapsing and
 passing out of existence for ever. (Applause.) Yet there are
 some states in Europe which still fail to understand that
 the days of the old colonial order are gone never to return.
 There is no justification whatever for the existence, to this
 very day, of the Portuguese colony of Goa on what since time
 immemorial has been the territory of India. This is a disgrace
 to the civilized nations. (Applause.) The sympathies of the
 Soviet people have always been, and will always be, on the
 side of those who are fighting against colonialism and its
 survivals. (Stormy applause.)
 One cannot say that the peoples of Asia have already
 overcome all their difficulties on the road to independent
 development. Attempts are still being made to push them
 off the path of peaceful development and on to the path of
 militarization andpreparation of another war. That, in partic-
 ular, is the purpose behind the various military pacts and
 blocs which are being knocked together in Southeast Asia,
 the Middle East and other parts of the world. They arouse
 justified suspicion on the part of the peoples of Asia because
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 their initiators are the same forces which in their day im-
 planted and defended the colonial system. Your Government,
 headed by Mr. Nehru, that outstanding statesman of our
 time, has taken a wise decision in refusing to join those
 military groupings, clearly realizing that they hamper the
 efforts of the peoples to secure a firm and lasting peace, and
 that the existence of such groupings greatly increases the
 danger of another war.
 We note with satisfaction that many Asian countries
 have taken a determined stand against the building of
 foreign military bases and the stationing of foreign troops
 on their territory, being perfectly aware that the establish-
 ment of foreign military bases and the stationing of foreign
 troops on their territory is fraught with the great danger
 of it being turned into an area of war and annihilation.
 We know that Madras is famed for its ancient culture.
 The wonderful architectural monuments which have arisen
 on your land throughout the centuries bear witness to the
 tremendous talent of your people, of your architects and
 builders. The State of Madras holds an important place in
 India's economic and cultural life. The state's chief treasure
 and asset, however, is its people, the creators of its wealth and
 its material values.
 Today all the peoples of India are working to strengthen their
 country's independence. We do not doubt that a broad road
 to new achievements in all spheres of the country's economic
 and cultural life lies open before them. We wish you success
 in further strengthening the unity of the peoples of India,
 in increasing her wealth and in steadfastly upholding the
 cause of peace. In the peoples of the Soviet Union you have
 true and reliable friends (applause), staunch and consistent
 champions of peace. (Applause.)
 Friendship between our peoples has glorious and ancient
 traditions. Never have relations between them been clouded

 by friction, still less by conflicts. This alone means much
 in evaluating prospects for the development of Soviet-
 Indian relations, prospects for further strengthening friend-
 ship and co-operation between the two countries.
 The Soviet people note with deep satisfaction that India
 is in the vanguard of the champions striving for the peaceful
 co-existence of nations (applause), and for the implemen-
 tation of Panch Shila (applause), the Five Principles pro-
 claimed in the Statement of Jawaharlal Nehru and Chou
 En-lai, and in the Joint Soviet-Indian Statement issued
 during the recent visit of Prime Minister Nehru to the
 Soviet Union. The Soviet people highly appreciate the con-
 tribution made by India and her Government to the cause of
 peace and peaceful settlement of outstanding international
 problems. In the Republic of India and her Government they
 see a like-minded ally in the struggle for peace and for,
 further relaxation of international tension.
 Long live thegreat industrious people of India! (Applause.)
 Long live the inviolable friendship of the peoples of India
 and the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause.)
 Long live world peace! (Stormy applause.)
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHR.USHCHOY
 Friends,
 I subscribe to what my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich
 Bulganin has said, in his speech. To what he said I will add:
 Our feelings of friendship blend with yours. We are fighting
 for peace together with you. (Applause.)
 If we use the strength of our friendship wisely and unite
 our efforts in the struggle for peace, then none of the forces
 bent on launching another war need hold Any fears for us.
 They will be swept out of the way and peace will be en-
 sured. (Stormy applause.)

 The Soviet people rejoice at every success of the peoples
 of India. They rejoice at your successes because in the past
 they themselves were oppressed and exploited by the tsar-
 ist autocracy, by domestic and foreign oppressors. In bit-
 ter struggle they created their powerful workers' and peas-
 ants' state, independent of the whims of foreign enslavers.
 This is why the Soviet people rejoice that the peoples of
 India, having rid themselves of colonial oppression, are
 now building their own independent state.
 We know from the experience of our own country that
 winning independence is not enough; after it has been won,
 independence must be consolidated, so that it can be upheld.
 (Stormy applause.) The way to consolidate the independence
 you have won is by building up a powerful industry of your
 own and steadily raising the living standard of the people.
 (Applause.) It is our sincere wish that the Republic of India
 may have a powerful, highly developed industry of her own,
 and a national economy independent of foreign states.
 Our people advanced towards that goal in their own way
 and they have achieved big results. You are following your
 own road, the road you have chosen. But you should know,
 friends, that the Soviet people will always be with you in
 your efforts to consolidate the independence you have won.
 (Stormy applause.)
 Long live the great people of India! (Applause.)
 Long live everlasting and inviolable friendship of the peo-
 ples of India and the peoples of the Soviet Union! (Applause.)
 'Long live world peace, everlasting peace among nations!

 IN CALCUTTA
 RALLY OF THE PEOPLE OF CALCUTTA
 IN HONOUR OF N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 November 30
 The rally was opened by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru,
 who emphasized that such a large popular gathering had nev-
 er before taken place in Calcutta.
 S. C. Ghosh, the Mayor, read an Address of the people
 of Calcutta to N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the U.S.S.R.
 Council of Ministers, and N. S. Khrushchov, Member of
 the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet.
 ADDRESS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALCUTTA
 To His Excellency the Prime Minister of the Soviet
 Union, N. A. Bulganin, and His Excellency the great Soviet
 leader, N. S. Khrushchov. May they live long years!
 Dear and Honoured Guests,
 We extend to you our most cordial greetings. This noble
 city of the East welcomes you with open arms and with
 a profound sentiment of devotion and respect. In the deci-
 sive epoch of the past it was in this city that our culture
 first came under the influence of the dynamic civilization
 of the West. Subsequently India started a new chapter in
 her history and opened her gates wide to ideas from the
 West. Today you have come from the West as envoys of a
 new political system and we welcome you. You are achieving

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 your aims with never-failing resolution and purposeful-
 ness. India is filled with respect for you.
 Creators of the new order,
 From the very beginning of its history mankind has strived
 to find new ways of life and has tried out new social systems.
 India has never lagged behind in those ceaseless searches.
 The lives of hundreds of her great men enrich the annals of
 her history. By her persistent efforts she has at last attained
 her goal, her ideal of individual freedom and tolerance.
 India believes in the greatest possible freedom for the indi-
 vidual because she considers that only thereby can full
 development of personality be achieved. But India also
 believes that other countries may have different systems and
 ideals. Tolerance is the key to Indian culture. Truth is one,
 but different roads lead to it. India acknowledges the excep-
 tional efforts of the Soviet people to raise the welfare of the
 common man. May your efforts be crowned with success!
 Dear friends,
 How pleasant the ties of friendship and affection be-
 tween peoples, between nations can be! Yet we see today
 that the world is in a state of tension, rent by con-
 flict and plunged in the fear of war. Our great leader, Pandit
 Jawaharlal Nehru, has shown where the solution lies-in the
 acceptance of the principles of co-existence, the principles
 of Panch Shila. Let every nation follow its own way of life
 and build up its destiny without interference from others.
 It is a great satisfaction for India that the mighty Soviet
 Union has accepted that idea. May the ties between India
 and the Soviet Union be strengthened, and may the joint
 efforts of the two nations for world peace bear fruits;
 may the world be spared the horrors of total destruc-
 tion!
 Long live the Soviet Union!
 Jai Hind! (Long live India!)

 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 Esteemed Dr. Mookerjee, Governor of Western Bengal,
 Esteemed Dr. Roy, First Minister of Western Bengal,
 Esteemed Mr. Ghosh, Mayor of Calcutta,
 Dear men and women, citizens of Calcutta (applause),
 Allow me to thank you for the exceptionally warm and
 friendly reception you have extended us representatives of
 the Soviet Union, your unselfish friend and brother! (Stormy
 applause.)
 During our short stay in your country we have become
 convinced of the Indian people's sincere desire to strengthen
 and further develop friendship with the peoples of the
 Soviet Union. This friendship has deep roots. (Applause.)
 The historic destinies of our peoples have much in common.
 That is why we understand each' other so easily. Our friend-
 ship is based not only on community of aims in the struggle
 for freedom and independence in the past, but on community
 of aims today and in the future too.
 Wonderful prospects for independent national develop-
 ment and for the building of a new life have opened out
 before the peoples of India since they freed themselves
 from age-old colonial oppression and adopted the line of
 independent development.
 India has won her political freedom, thus creating the
 prerequisite for the progress of your great country.
 We are particularly glad of the solidarity of the Asian
 peoples who have risen for the decisive storm of the world
 colonial system and have tremendous achievements to their
 credit.
 The peoples of great China, our common friend and
 brother, have gained an historic victory. (Applause.)
 Great India has won political independence! (Applause.)
 Other Asian peoples too are freeing themselves from hated

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 colonial oppression. They are choosing their path of devel-
 opment, non-interference of other states in their inter-
 nal affairs. We greet the peoples of these countries in their
 great endeavours.
 There are countries which fasten themselves like ticks
 to a healthy body. I mean Portugal, which refuses to leave
 Goa, to relinquish its hold on that territory which legiti-
 mately belongs to India. (Applause.)
 But this will happen sooner or later and Goa will be free
 of foreign domination and become a component part of the
 Republic of India. (Stormy applause.)
 The solidarity of the Asian peoples is a mortal blow to
 the world colonial system.
 We are in famous Calcutta, the centre of Western Bengal,
 which made greater sacrifices in the struggle for India's
 independence than any other state in India. (Stormy ap-
 plause.)
 The people of Calcutta have displayed great understand-
 ing of their role in the struggle for an independent India.
 We are happy to greet them, happy to convey the most sin-
 cere greetings from the peoples of the Soviet Union (applause)
 and wish you, our dear friends, success in strengthening
 the state of your birth. (Stormy applause.)
 We know from the experience of our country what inex-
 haustible forces people display when they struggle for a
 great cause like the strengthening of the independence they
 have won. Our whole people together built up its own
 powerful industry. No one helped us. More than that, the capi-
 talists did all they could to harm us.
 But utilizing all our domestic resources we have built
 a strong socialist state.
 We now have a powerful industry which enables us to
 attain important successes in the development of our nation-
 al economy.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 We sincerely and heartily wish you success in developing
 your home industry-the condition for strengthening the
 independence of any great state. (Applause.)
 You have immense possibilities for the development of
 a powerful industry of your own-an enormous raw mate-
 rial base and industrious and talented people. As yet, of
 course, you have little experience. But we are prepared
 to share ours with you, to pass on to you the necessary tech-
 nical knowledge. (Applause.)
 We had no such friends when we began to build our indus-
 try. But we found strength to surmount all difficulties.
 We believe that India will build a mighty industry of her
 own.
 In the very first years of Soviet power Lenin put forward
 the idea of peaceful co-existence of the socialist and the
 capitalist systems. He said that the socialist state would
 constantly grow and gain strength and, whether the capi-
 talist states liked it or not, they would be compelled to
 trade with the Soviet Land, to have close economic ties
 with our country. We Soviet people have always stood for
 peaceful relations between states irrespective of their polit-
 ical system, for independent development of both large and
 small countries and respect for their territorial integrity,
 for non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.
 That is why we so heartily support the Five Principles
 proclaimed in the Statement signed by Mr. Nehru, your
 Prime Minister, and Comrade Chou En-lai, as represent-
 ative of the great Chinese people. (Applause.) These Five
 Principles conform to our foreign policy, and we gave them
 our full support by signing the Joint Statement of the
 Soviet Union and India. (Applause.)
 Friends,
 The peoples of our countries, engaged in peaceful con-
 structive endeavour, are vitally interested in maintaining
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 and strengthening peace. The friendship between the peoples
 of India and of the Soviet Union is growing and becoming
 stronger in the fight for peace.
 Each going its own way, the peoples of our countries
 are working for their bright future.
 Further consolidation of our friendship, mutual exchange
 of experience and broad development of economic and cul-
 tural ties between the peoples of our countries will undoubt-
 edly promote the earliest attainment of the noble aims
 they have set themselves.
 . Our friendship enriches the peoples of India and of the
 Soviet Union materially and spiritually.
 Friendship between the peoples of India and of the Soviet
 Union, however, is not to the liking of some people, who
 would not be averse to destroying it. It is clear to us why
 certain circles in some countries are trying to achieve this.
 They fear friendship between peoples because it promotes
 the strengthening of world peace.
 We have never imposed our ideas or our way of life on
 other countries, as the governments of some states do. We
 build our relations with other countries on mutual respect
 for the way of life chosen by those nations.
 . We stand for reduction of armaments and prohibition of
 atomic and hydrogen weapons. (Applause.) But to our
 regret we are not getting proper support in this matter
 from the Western states. They do not want this because the
 monopolists thrive on the armament race. They do not want
 any cut in armaments because they strive to make us spend
 more for defence purposes so that we will not be able to
 spend more on the peaceful development of our national
 economy or to render assistance to economically underde-
 veloped countries.
 It is our task to exert an active influence on the reaction-
 ary forces and to work for the prohibition of atomic

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 weapons. We are in favour of control over armaments, but
 of effective, not fictitious, control. (Applause.)
 We have special pleasure in visiting your wonderful city
 since it is one of the biggest industrial and cultural centres
 in India. It is a pleasure for us to visit it also because it is
 the birthplace of the great son of the Bengali people, the
 writer of genius and public figure Rabindranath Tagore.
 (Applause.) Tagore was a sincere and loyal friend of the
 Soviet Union. (Applause.) The Soviet people deeply re-
 spect him and are fond of his works. (Applause.)
 Our compatriot Gerasim Lebedev  lived and worked
 in your city, and together with, advanced representatives
 of the Indian, intellectuals he founded the first Bengali
 theatre in 1795.
 We should like relations between our countries to grow
 broader and stronger.. We should like your people to come
 oftener to our country, where they will always find the
 warmest and most cordial welcome. (Applause.)
 Allow me to thank you once more, dear friends, for the
 -warm and exceptionally hospitable reception you extended
 us. We take it, as the expression of your love for the peoples
 of the Soviet Union, a love of which we are very proud. The
 peoples of India and of the Soviet Union are brothers!
 (Stormy applause.)
 We express our most heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Nehru,
 that outstanding statesman and political leader, whom
 we sincerely and highly respect (applause), and. we wish
 to thank him once more for the invitation to visit your
 country and to acquaint ourselves with her life and the
 wonderful Indian people.
 May the fraternal friendship between the peoples of India
 and of the Soviet Union grow stronger and develop! (Ap-
 plause.) Long live world peace! (Stormy applause and
 cheers.)

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Twelve days ago our esteemed guests arrived in Delhi
 and were welcomed by our people. Then they made a journey
 through other parts of India, visited several of our famous
 cities and saw some of our rural localities. Now they have
 arrived in this, our largest city, and you have organized
 the biggest reception for them. I congratulate you on this,
 although I should have liked your enthusiasm to have been
 more disciplined.
 Our guests have seen some of our achievements and the
 work we are doing in our country and have got to know the
 spirit of our people, just as I saw their great achievements
 when I visited the Soviet Union and was welcomed by
 the Soviet people five months ago. Thus we come to know
 and understand one another better, and  the friendship
 between us is growing stronger.
 Our guests have everywhere laid stress upon the Five
 Principles  of peaceful  co-existence-Panch  Shila-and
 expressed their agreement with them. These Five Principles
 are the basis of our relations with other countries and we are
 sure that if relations between countries rest on this founda-
 tion they will be sound, peaceful and in the spirit of co-
 operation, because such relations are based on equality,
 mutual  respect  and  peaceful  co-existence  and  exclude
 aggression and interference in each other's internal affairs.
 A conflict arises when one country reigns over another or
 interferes in its internal affairs. Were the Five Princi-
 ples fully and sincerely adopted by all countries peace
 would be guaranteed everywhere and co-operation would
 exist.
 That does not mean that all countries must resemble one
 another or pursue the same policy. It means that each coun-
 try must develop freely in the way it considers necessary,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 being at the same time friendly towards other countries.
 India and the Soviet Union have different economic and po-
 litical systems. Nevertheless, we are friendly countries and
 co-operate in many fields, because we respect each other's
 freedom and way of life and do not want to interfere.
 For us in India peaceful co-existence is not a new idea.
 It has been our way of life and it is as old as our thought
 and culture. Two thousand two hundred years ago, India's
 great son Asoka proclaimed this idea and carved it on a
 rock which still exists today and conveys his message to us.
 Asoka told us that we must respect the faith of others,
 that a man who extolls his own faith and abases another's
 does harm to his own. That is a lesson in tolerance and peace-
 ful co-existence and co-operation, in which India believed
 for many centuries. Now we speak more about economic
 and social systems, but the approach is the same as for-
 merly.
 That is why we do our best to be friends with all coun-
 tries, whether we agree with them or not. That is why we
 refrain from criticizing other countries, even when we do
 not agree with their policy, provided circumstances do not
 force us to explain our point of view.
 From this it naturally follows that we must keep out
 of military and similar alliances and not join any of the
 groups of the Great Powers which rule the world today.
 We are pursuing our own independent policy, but not in
 a spirit of pride or arrogance. We cannot do otherwise,
 unless we have forgotten everything that India stood for
 in the past and stands for today. We welcome relations and
 friendship with all and exchange of thoughts and ideas of
 all kinds, but we reserve for ourselves the right to choose
 our own way. In this lies the essence of Panch Shila.
 The great reception which our guests have had in India
 has disturbed some of our friends in other countries who
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 cannot help thinking in categories of hostile camps and
 military alliances. I have frequently declared that we do
 not intend to join any camp or alliance. That is our basic
 policy. But we want to co-operate with all for peace and
 security and the improvement of the condition of mankind.
 No one must object to friendship and co-operation among
 others. We must show love and avoid hatred, coercion
 and enmity.
 We are happy that India and the Soviet Union have been
 brought nearer to each other through the historical visit
 of the Soviet leaders, and we desire fruitful co-operation for
 peace and the well-being of mankind. This friendship
 and this co-operation are not directed against any nation
 or people. We hope that the zone of friendship and co-opera-
 tion will extend until in the end it covers the whole world.
 To this we dedicate ourselves.
 I again greet our esteemed guests and hope that they will
 convey our message of friendship and greeting to their
 people.
 (Nehru's speech was frequently interrupted by applause.
 The crowd cheered when, in conclusion, he hailed Indo-
 Soviet friendship and world peace.)

 RALLY IN JAIPUR
 IN HONOUR OF N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 December 8
 A rally in honour of N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov
 was held in Jaipur on December 8. In his speech of welcome
 M. L. Sukhadia, Chief Minister of the State of Jaipur, said:
 "On behalf of the people of Rajasthan allow me to convey
 sincere greetings to you on the occasion of your visit to
 our historic city of Jaipur. We in Rajasthan eagerly looked
 forward to your visit and, we welcome you with deep satis-
 faction and joy. We are happy to have you here among us,
 today. Although your visit will be brief, I hope you will
 feel that the heart of the common man of India is filled with
 deep love for you and the great people of the Soviet Union.
 "I greet you as esteemed representatives and leaders of
 a great friendly nation. Our people are proud to welcome
 you here as friends and comrades on the road to the prosperity
 of mankind. The heroic struggle of your courageous peoples
 against the forces of darkness during the Second World
 War met with boundless sympathy and admiration from our
 compatriots, although, unfortunately, at that time we were
 merely sorrowful onlookers in an enslaved country."
 The Chief Minister went on to say: "Your visit to India
 has given us an opportunity to become better acquainted
 with the Soviet Union, to understand it better. India fully
 subscribes to the passionate desire of the Soviet people to

 preserve world peace. We in India have great and old tra-
 ditions of peace and tolerance, bequeathed to us by Mahatma
 Gandhi, the father of our country. Our Prime Minister is,
 in his own way, following in the footsteps of the great teach-
 er. What with the tremendous reserve of good will existing
 in the world today, we are confident that India and the Soviet
 Union, hand in hand, will successfully uphold all the values
 and ideals which give meaning and worth to human life....
 For our part, I should like sincerely to assure you that we
 shall always retain the most vivid and precious memories
 of your visit to India.
 "Allow me once again to take advantage of this occasion
 to convey through you and your comrades our heartiest
 greetings and warm wishes for peace and prosperity to the
 friendly people of the great Soviet Union."
 Mr. Chief Minister, Mr. Mayor, dear friends,
 Allow me on my own behalf, on behalf of Comrade Nikita
 Sergeyevich Khrushchov, on behalf of the friends who are
 accompanying us, and  on behalf  of the  entire multi-
 million Soviet people, to convey friendly greetings to you.
 (Applause.)
 We heartily thank you, dear friends, for your warm wel-
 come and fraternal hospitality. (Applause.)
 Jaipur is known as a city with a glorious history, as a city
 with wonderful monuments of Indian architecture.
 We know that the population of Jaipur together with all
 the people of Rajasthan for a long time heroically upheld
 their independence and inscribed many glorious pages in
 the annals of India's struggle for independence. (Applause.)
 We know how courageously the people of Rajasthan are
 combating grim nature, and we wish them successes in

 converting the droughty areas of the state into flourishing
 fields and orchards, into sources of the people's prosperity.
 (Prolonged applause.)
 During our stay in India we have visited many towns and
 districts of your great country. We have seen and learned
 a great deal. We have made the acquaintance of the people
 of India, who everywhere have greeted us as friends and
 expressed their ardent love for the Soviet people. (Prolonged
 applause.)
 We have been deeply moved by the warm fraternal welcome
 you accorded us. We shall never forget it. (Prolonged ap-
 plause.)
 The friendship between the Indian and the Soviet peoples
 is a great historical achievement. This friendship was born
 in the struggle of the peace-loving nations against war,
 in the struggle for peace and security. The friendship be-
 tween our peoples is of immense importance for the further
 consolidation of the forces of peace. (Applause.)
 The relations between our countries are based on the well-
 known Five Principles, Panch Shila. (Prolonged applause.)
 The Soviet Union firmly adheres to these principles. (Ap-
 plause.) We want the friendship and co-operation between
 India and the Soviet Union to develop and gain in strength
 for the benefit of our great countries, for the benefit of
 peace. (Prolonged applause.)
 Dear friends,  allow me to wish success and prosperity
 to the wonderful city of Jaipur, to your state and to the
 entire Indian people. (Prolonged applause.)
 May the sovereign and independent Republic of India-
 our country's great friend-grow in stature and strength!
 (Stormy  applause.)
 Long live the friendship between the peoples of India and
 the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause.)

 N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 IN KASHMIR
 STATEMENT BY N. A. BULGANIN AT AIRFIELD
 December 9
 Sadar-i-Riyasat, Mr. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
 Allow me to convey to you, and in your person to the pop-
 ulation of Kashmir, our sincere gratitude for your warm
 and  hearty welcome.
 We have been to many cities in India, have visited indus-
 trial establishments and plantations, construction sites and
 scientific institutions and are full of impressions of everything
 seen in that great country.
 India is a country of immense potentialities and the Indian
 people are filled with desire to build a new, economically
 strong India.
 During our trip we have met representatives. of many
 peoples inhabiting India who differ in language, historic
 traditions and culture, but they are all united in their striv-
 ing for peace and peaceful labour. We can assure you that
 in their striving for peace the Indian people have loyal and
 consistent friends in the peoples of the Soviet Union. (Ap-
 plause.)
 Our tour of India has proved very useful to us. We must say
 with all frankness that the conception of India we had
 was far from adequate. Thanks to the opportunity kindly
 granted us we travelled through the whole of South and
 Central India. But without visiting the northern part of

 India we would not have been- able to geta full idea of India.
 (Applause.)
 That is why we have accepted with great satisfaction the
 invitation of the Sadar-i-Riyasat  Yuvraj Karan Singh
 to visit Kashmir. (Applause.) The trip to Kashmir is inter-
 esting to us because the peculiar natural conditions of
 Kashmir, the rich original culture of its peoples and the art
 of the popular craftsmen have won Kashmir world-wide
 renown. The trip to Kashmir is of interest to us, representa-
 tives of the Soviet people, also because Kashmir is near to
 our country. In the past we always had extensive trade ties
 with Kashmir. (Stormy applause.)
 We should likCe-to make use of our sojourn in Kashmir
 to learn about the life and customs of the Kashmiri people,
 their rich, original culture and their achievements.
 Once again we thank you, dear friends, for your warm
 welcome. (Stormy applause.)

 GIVEN BY SADAR-I-RIVASAT YUVRAJ
 KARAN SINGH
 IN HONOUR
 OF N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 December 10
 SPEECH BY SADAR-I-RIYASAT Y. K. SINGH
 The natural beauties and the arts and crafts of this state
 of the Indian Union are known the whole world over. Ever
 since your visit to India was announced we hoped you
 would come to Kashmir. We are grateful to you for having
 honoured us with your visit despite all the inconveniences it
 caused you. This gesture of yours is highly appreciated by
 our people. We only regret that at this time of the year we
 cannot show you Kashmir at its best. I sincerely hope you
 come to us sometime in the spring or summer, when the
 gifts of our nature shine in all their wealth and splendour.
 Your visit to India, following close upon the historic visit
 of our great Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to Russia,
 has tremendous national  and international significance.
 Between our two countries there exists a long-standing tra-
 dition of friendly, good-neighbourly relations, although
 until recently, owing to historical reasons, close cultural
 relations between us did not develop. But now that we have
 become a sovereign, independent republic, ties of friend-
 ship and mutual understanding have been created between
 India and the Soviet Union on the basis of the noble Five
 Principles, Panch Shila. This friendship is a good sign for
 the establishment and maintenance of world peace, for the
 creation of conditions under which all energies can be con-

 centrated on improving human well-being. We in Kashmir,
 together with our fellow-citizens in the other parts of India,
 welcome this historic process.
 Allow me once again to thank you for having honoured
 us by your presence, and to express the hope that friendship
 between our two countries will grow from day to day. Jai
 Hind! (Long live India!) (Stormy applause.)
 Sadar-i-Riyasat,
 We heartily thank you for your warm and friendly wel-
 come and for the kind words you have addressed to us here.
 We gladly accepted the invitation to visit Kashmir. (Ap-
 plause.)
 The Soviet people are well familiar with the rich and dis-
 tinctive culture of Kashmir, which has presented India
 with many outstanding scientists, historians, writers, polit-
 ical leaders and artists.
 The productions of the industrious and talented crafts-
 men of Kashmir are highly valued in the Soviet Union.
 .In this we were not mistaken. When visiting today the
 exhibition of the work of local craftsmen, we had one more
 opportunity to convince ourselves of their great skill.
 We think that the talented and industrious people of
 Kashmir, together with all the peoples of India, will achieve
 further success in economic and cultural development.
 Sadar-i-Riyasat, you rightly observed that ca-operation
 between the Soviet Union and India is now particularly
 fruitful, developing as it is on the basis of the Five Prin-
 ciples, Panch Shila. These principles not only ensure the
 peaceful co-existence and co-operation of our countries;
 they serve the general cause of the peace and security of the
 nations.

 The Soviet Union is perseveringly working to ease
 international tension and to strengthen confidence between
 the states, so that international problems may be fully
 solved by negotiation. We  are  confident that a real
 international detente will come when universal confidence
 has been established, as expressed in renunciation of the
 policy of forming military blocs, in cessation of the arms
 race, in successive reductions of armed forces and arma-
 ments, arid in unconditional prohibition of the production
 and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.
 We are very glad that on many of these problems India's
 views and our views concur.
 Allow me to wish you, your people and all the population
 of Kashmir continued and even greater achievement.
 The warm and cordial welcome we have received is evidence
 of the friendly feelings cherished by your people for
 the Soviet Union.
 Long live the friendship of the peoples of India and the
 Soviet Union! (Applause.)
 Long live world peace! (Applause.)

 RECEPTION
 GIVEN BY G. M. BARSHI,
 PRIME MINISTER OF KASHMIR,
 IN HONOUR
 OF N. A. BUL(IANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 December 10
 SPEECH BY G. M. BAKSHI
 Your Excellencies,
 It is, with deep satisfaction that I welcome you from
 the bottom of my heart on behalf of the people of Jam-
 mu and Kashmir. We are grateful to you for your consent
 to visit these places, although, we believe, it has bur-
 dened you to a certain extent. Allow me. to assure you
 that we regard your consent as an expression of your
 warm, sincere attitude towards us, and that the memory of
 your visit will remain as a fond and pleasant memory in the
 hearts of the people of Kashmir.
 Throughout the centuries Kashmir has hospitably wel-
 comed people from all over the world who have visited this
 splendid valley. There was a time when we maintained,
 through the Pamirs, lively relations with many parts of
 Central Asia. The commercial and cultural intercourse which
 then existed laid an imprint on our life and culture. Wel-
 coming you today, we take advantage of the occasion to
 emphasize our century-old cultural and commercial relations
 with the peoples of your country.
 We are happy that, for the first time in history, it ap-
 pears, such outstanding guests from the neighbouring great
 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have visited us. This
 is a memorable event of our time, marking the broadening

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 relations of friendship and good will which the people are
 striving to establish with all parts of the world and with
 all nations....
 Pursuing the ideal of peace and progress, India has stretched
 out a hand of friendship and alliance to all the nations of the
 world. Prompted by a sincere desire to relax international
 tension, our leader and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru,
 has dedicated all his energies and all the resources of the coun-
 try to influence the international situation, with a view to
 preventing war and violence and bringing near security,
 peace and co-operation. We note with satisfaction that all the
 peace-loving peoples of the world, regardless of the colour
 of their skin or their religion, are united in the attainment
 of that historic goal.
 The preservation of peace is particularly important to the
 people of Kashmir, for they have experienced the sufferings
 and deprivations caused by armed conflict. At  a time
 when the war had ended everywhere, our people were drawn
 into a struggle which has left a bitter mark in the memory
 of our generation. The powerful desire of our people for peace
 and frecdom is therefore  fully  understandable, and we
 welcome the good will of all supporters of freedom, peace
 and progress.
 The visit of Your Excellencies to our country testifies to
 the growing understanding and good will of the great Soviet
 Union towards India. The warmth and sincerity with which
 our people have welcomed you everywhere during your
 visit is a testimony of the feelings which the Indians enter-
 tain for your country. We stand on the threshold of great
 social and economic changes, and the co-operation and
 assistance of all our well-wishers sincerely concerned with
 progress and freedom will promote the further development
 of good-neighbourly relations between our two countries.
 The close bonds which link the U.S.S.R. and India on

 the basis of the great Five Principles of peaceful co-existence
 inspire our people with confidence that the danger of war
 will be eliminated and that the zones of possible conflict
 will gradually give way to zones of concord and friendship.
 May the friendship between our peoples pave the way to
 the establishment of more peaceful and happy relations the
 world over! (Applause.)
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 Dear friends,
 Allow me first of all to express my deep gratitude
 to the Sadar-i-Riyasat of Jammu and  Kashmir,  Mr.
 Y. K. Singh, the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir,
 Mr. G. M. Bakshi, to all present here and to all the
 people of your state for the cordial reception you have
 given us. (Prolonged applause.)
 We shall never forget the very hearty welcome we received
 from the people of Kashmir. Yesterday, when we rode
 in the boats on the river, with its banks crowded with wel-
 coming people, and through the thronged streets of Srinagar,
 we were deeply moved by the manifestation of most cordial
 friendship and affection entertained by the inhabitants of
 Kashmir, as of all the other Indian cities and states we
 visited, for their friend and brother, the people of the Soviet
 Union. (Applause.)
 Your state is situated nearest of all to the Central Asian
 republics of the  Soviet Union-Tajikistan,  Turkmeni-
 stan, and Uzbekistan. (Applause.) That is why we accepted
 with deep gratitude the invitation of the esteemed chief
 of your state, Yuvraj Karan Singh, to come to Kashmir.
 It has been a pleasure to visit your state, because it is
 the birthplace of your esteemed Premier, Mr. Nehru. (Pro-
 longed applause.)
 Your climate, too, is similar to that of our Central Asian
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 republics, and the crops you grow have much in common
 with theirs. When we came here we felt, as it were, the breath
 of our native country, of its southern, Central Asian part.
 The population of Kashmir and of the capital of your state,
 Srinagar, is not homogeneous in composition.  Here live
 Kashmiris, Dogras and Ladkhis; the inhabitants of Kash-
 mir include Hindus, Moslems, Sikhs and members of other
 nationalities and religions. But when we drove through
 the streets of Srinagar, we felt that we were being welcomed
 in equal degree by people of all religions and nationali-
 ties. This was expressed both in the mottoes of welcome
 and in the kind words addressed to us by the inhabitants
 of Srinagar.
 All this was linked with the name of the Prime Minis-
 ter of the Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who enjoys
 here, as in the other states of India, immense popularity
 and prestige. (Prolonged applause.)
 All this indicates that the peoples of Jammu and Kash-
 mir, though of different nationalities and different faiths,
 live together harmoniously and want to work effectively
 for the welfare of their motherland, the Republic of In-
 dia. (Applause.)
 Friendly co-operation of peoples is something we under-
 stand and  dearly prize. Our country is multi-national in
 composition. In it live people of many faiths.  But this
 does not give rise to any misunderstanding, and the Soviet
 people live and work together in one harmonious family.
 (Applause.)
 Religion is a matter for the conscience of each individ-
 ual, and of each nation. Our delegation includes Jabar
 Rasulov, Zukhra Rakhimbabayeva and Sharaf Rashidov,
 representatives of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, whose peoples
 profess the Mohammedan faith. But in what way do our
 Moslems differ from members of other faiths? We make no
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 such distinction, because all the peoples of our country are
 worthy members of the great Soviet Union, and constitute
 one family of nations. (Applause.),
 We in the Soviet Union have effectively solved the nation-
 al problem and the problem of freedom of religion. Every
 citizen of our country may worship in the way he thinks fit.
 I say this in order that you may have a clearer idea of
 our attitude to this question. There are states which still
 seek to sow discord among the peoples of India by stirring
 up national enmity or dividing the peoples on religious lines.
 Official representatives of these states attempt to foment
 artificial conflicts.
 But is this to the benefit of India and her peoples? We think
 that it is to the detriment of the interests both of India as
 a whole and of the peoples of India.
 The peoples want to have the opportunity to work, to
 raise their cultural standards; and to live in material secu-
 rity. They want to have a state of their own which is free
 and not dependent on the whims of imperialist states.
 But does all this depend on the faith this or that people
 professes? I think not. (Applause.)
 In order to enjoy the political freedoms and to be able
 constantly to raise  one's educational standards, and to
 live in material security, there is no need to base one's state
 on one particular religion. What is necessary is that the
 people shall be free, that there, shall be no exploitation of
 man by man. (Applause.)
 We have never attempted to force our views or our form of
 government on anyone. The peoples of each country can,
 and should, themselves -decide what form of government
 to ' choose, and what ideology to adhere to. But we want
 to record the fact that the path chosen by our people has
 led to the unfolding of all their constructive energies, has
 created immense potentialities for the continuous. progress

 of their national economy and culture, and for the promotion
 of the welfare of the broad masses of the people.
 Why has the so-called Kashmir question arisen at all?
 It did not arise among the people. Certain states find it to
 their advantage to foment  animosity  among the peo-
 ples of countries which are emancipating themselves from
 colonial oppression, which are throwing off their age-old
 subjection to alien oppressors. (Applause.)
 In this, the monopolists are solely pursuing their own
 ends. They incite some of the peoples of these countries
 against others, so as to bring these countries under greater
 economic subjugation and make them dependent on their will.
 It is hardly necessary for me to name the states which
 are constantly straining the Kashmir issue, for this is wide-
 ly known. Nor do these states themselves particularly
 conceal their interest in further straining the issue.
 The Kashmir question was discussed in the Security
 Council, and the representative of the Soviet Union clearly
 set forth our view, the Soviet view, on this question.
 Our attitude to this question is as clear-cut and definite
 as it could be. The Soviet Union has always maintained
 that the political status of Kashmir is a matter to be
 decided by the people of Kashmir themselves, in accord-
 ance with the principles of democracy and in the interest
 of promoting friendly relations among the peoples of this
 area. (Prolonged applause.) While maintaining an impartial
 and objective attitude to the Kashmir issue, the Soviet
 Union has always expressed its sincere sympathy with the
 people of  Kashmir and their peace-loving democratic
 forces, who have established friendly relations with the pro-
 gressive and peace-loving forces of the Republic of India,
 which is fully cognizant of the national aspirations of the
 Kashmiri people.
 The facts show that the inhabitants of Kashmir do not
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 want Kashmir to be a plaything of imperialist forces.
 (Stormy applause.) And this is precisely what certain powers
 are striving for on the pretext of supporting Pakistan's posi-
 tion on the Kashmir issue.
 If I may, I should like to state my opinion generally
 concerning the division of India into two states. We, the
 friends of India, were grieved that the imperialist forces
 succeeded in dividing India into two parts: India and Pak-
 istan. Before the Indian people won the independence of
 their country, India was united. It was not in the interest of
 the peoples of India that India was divided. But precisely
 for this reason, passions were kindled over the different
 religions of the peoples of India, though religion has never
 been the chief consideration when any state was established.
 One might cite our country as an example. In the Soviet
 Union there are more than 15 million Moslems, as well as
 members of other religions. And despite the different
 faiths, the peoples of our country live in fraternal friend-
 ship. They have created, and are constantly strengthening,
 a united state-the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
 a socialist country. (Applause.)
 Consequently, it was not the different religious faiths
 of the population that was the chief consideration in estab-
 lishing Pakistan and separating it from the united India.
 Other states, who conduct their policy in accordance with
 the old principle of "divide and rule," had an active
 hand in the matter. They exploited the existence of dif-
 ferent religions for the furtherance of their own ends.
 We are firmly convinced that when passions subside and
 the peoples come to realize all the significance of this artifi-
 cial division of the territory of India, they will regret it.
 But the establishment of two separate states-India
 and Pakistan-is a decided issue, and I have not stated
 my opinion on this score so frankly in order that the ques-
 6?                          131
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 tion might be re-examined in any quarter. I note it as a
 fact. And inasmuch as the two states exist and are develop-
 ing, it is scarcely necessary now to redraw their boundaries,
 as certain powers would like to do. (Applause.) We know
 that changes of frontiers are always a painful process and
 involve bloodshed.
 That Kashmir is one of the states of the Republic of India
 has been decided by the people of Kashmir. It is a question
 that the people themselves have decided. (Stormy and pro-
 longed applause.) I think the two sides should display great-
 er determination to preserve peace in this area, as both
 India  and Pakistan can develop only in conditions of
 peaceful co-existence. (Applause.)
 Very good and friendly relations have developed between
 us and the Republic of India. (Applause.) They have so
 developed because we build our relations on the Five Prin-
 ciples of peaceful co-existence. We have common views on
 very many international issues. We adhere to a common
 position in condemning the formation of military blocs
 and military alignments of any kind. The Governments
 of our countries pursue a policy which helps to relax
 international tension and prevent war.
 The independent and sovereign Republic of India is a
 young and growing state. What draws us together is that
 it is actively striving for world-wide peace.
 Just as we do not interfere in the internal affairs- of India,
 so India does not interfere in our internal affairs. (Applause.)
 The internal affairs of every state are a matter for the
 people of that state.
 If in the Republic of India we see an ally in the effort
 for peace, for the peaceful settlement of outstanding issues,
 this, unfortunately, cannot be said of Pakistan.
 Pakistan is also a young state. But we are alarmed by
 the policy of its rulers. The facts show that their policy is
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 not guided by the vital interests of their people, of their
 state, but is dictated by the monopoly circles of other-coun-
 tries. The present Government of Pakistan frankly adver-
 tises its particular closeness with American monopoly
 circles. (Animation.) It was one of the first participants
 in, one of the sponsors of, the notorious Baghdad pact,
 the aim of which is anything but peace. (Animation.)
 It has sanctioned the establishment of American military
 bases on its territory-that is, in close proximity to the
 borders of the Soviet Union.
 We say frankly that the establishment of American mil-
 itary bases in Pakistan cannot but arouse our alarm. With
 the active participation of Pakistan, further efforts are now
 being made to enlarge the membership of the Baghdad pact.
 It is a regrettable fact that the Government of Iran has
 bowed to the imperialist forces and has acceded to this pact.
 We say frankly that we never have supported and never
 shall support the parties to the Baghdad pact, or to any
 other alliance directed against the Soviet Union.
 We should be politically blind if we acted otherwise. It
 is obvious to all that the Baghdad pact is spearheaded
 against the Soviet Union and other peaceable countries.
 It is therefore our task to weaken this belligerent alliance,
 one of the hotbeds of possible warlike ventures.
 We sincerely want the peace-loving, independent Re-
 public of India to grow in stature and strength. (Stormy
 applause.)
 We have learned of the following unfriendly act of the
 Pakistan Government. The Soviet Ambassador to Pakistan
 was called to the  Foreign Ministry and recommended
 that my friend, Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, and I
 should give up our visit to Kashmir, decline the invitation
 of the chief of your state to visitSrinagar and other parts
 of your state.. (Burst- of laughter.)
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 This can only be taken as an unprecedented instance of
 interference in the affairs of others. Never before has a third
 state permitted itself to tell us where to go, and why, and
 what friends we should choose. (Animation and applause.)
 We very much dislike the Baghdad pact, one of the most
 active participants. in which is Pakistan, though without
 benefit to itself or its people. But we are patient and are
 confident that the Baghdad pact will burst like a soap bub-
 ble, and that nothing will remain of it but an unpleasant
 memory. (Animation and stormy applause.)
 The representative of the Pakistan Foreign Ministry also
 told our Ambassador that the Pakistan Government would
 not like us to visit Afghanistan, a neighbour of our country.
 (Animation.) But that is already going far too far, and
 those who make such recommendations are taking much
 too much upon themselves.
 Afghanistan is our good neighbour, with whom we have
 long maintained friendly relations. (Applause.) We want
 to develop and strengthen these relations, and we~hope that
 our visit to Afghanistan will facilitate this. (Applause.)
 We should very much like to have similar relations with
 Pakistan, and it is not our fault that such relations have
 so far not developed. But we shall persistently strive to
 improve these relations in the interest of peace.
 The Soviet Union has always stood for world peace, for
 friendship between nations and between states. We were
 enjoined to follow this course unswervingly by the great
 Lenin. (Stormy applause.) And we shall follow this course
 undeviatingly, strengthening and extending our friendship
 with all states and nations.
 Long live friendship and co-operation between the Re-
 public of India and the Soviet Union! (Prolonged ap-
 plause.)
 Long live world peace! (Stormy and prolonged applause.)

 DELIVERED IN VILLAGE OF BHATGAON

 After thanking the inhabitants of Sonepat District on
 his own behalf and on behalf of N. A. Bulganin for the
 hearty welcome given them, N. S. Khrushchov said they
 were very glad to be guests of the Indian peasants that day.
 The Soviet Union, he noted further, had demonstrated
 in practice what rapid progress the peasants can make when
 the conditions for it are created. He conveyed to the audi-
 ence, and through it to all the peasants of India, the wishes
 of  the  Soviet  Union's  collective-farm  peasantry  for
 the flowering of their spiritual and material forces. He
 emphasized that the road to the peasantry's material and
 spiritual advancement lies through the development of
 machine methods of production, through the supply of the
 countryside with machinery, and wished the people of
 India success in this work.

 RECEPTION
 GIVEN BY N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 IN DELHI
 December 12
 Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, dear friends,
 Our stay in India is drawing to an end. We have spent
 almost three weeks in your country and thanks to the oppor-
 tunity kindly given to us by your Government and Mr.
 Nehru we have been able to see many towns and regions of
 India, visit many enterprises and construction sites, planta-
 tions and scientific institutions; we have been to the West
 and South, to the East  and North of your country;
 we have acquainted ourselves with your people and gor-
 geous monuments of ancient culture and economy. For all
 this we are very grateful to you.
 We have seen a lot of fine things during our trip. We
 have found out many useful things. At present I should
 like to touch on a point which, to my ;mind, is very im-
 portant.
 The sincerity and strength of the sentiments displayed
 by the Indian people for us have shown with great force
 that the Indian people are loyal friends of the peoples
 of the Soviet Union. (Applause.) We have seen a lot
 with our own eyes, we came into contact with representa=
 tives from different social strata, we heard from the mouth
 of the people themselves about their wishes, their aspira-

 We will never forget the fine words which we heard every-
 where we went: "The Indian and the Soviet peoples
 are brothers." (Applause.) These few simple words reflect
 the sincere desire of our peoples for friendship and co-oper-
 ation.
 We are deeply convinced that friendship and co-opera-
 tion between our peoples are necessary not only for the
 happiness and prosperity of our states, they are needed
 also for the strengthening of peace and security. Friend-
 ship between India and the Soviet Union is a weighty con-
 tribution to peace which the enemies of peace cannot dis-
 regard. I propose a toast to the further development of
 friendship and co-operation between India and the So-
 viet Union, to the health of Prime Minister of India Jawa-
 harlal Nehru. (Applause.)
 SPEECH BY JAWAHAR;AL NEHRU
 When I visited the Soviet Union six months ago, I had
 the honour not only of meeting you and your colleagues,
 but to a certain extent of establishing contact with the
 peoples of the Soviet Union. I have learned that the Soviet
 people are exceptionally friendly and hospitable. I felt
 great sympathy for them and that is why I said at my de-
 parture that I was leaving a part of my heart in the Soviet
 Union. (Applause.) I believe that friendship always evokes
 friendship, and that is why the friendship which was dis-
 played towards us by the Soviet people aroused in its sen-
 timents of exceptional sympathy for them.
 During- your stay in India you have met a great number
 of people from different social strata, and I think you
 were warmly and cordially received everywhere you went.
 I love my people, .and naturally I am biassed Sin. its favour,
 but I think that you also liked our people. Thus, through

 friendship we have opened a way to mutual understanding,
 to friendship not only between individual persons, but
 between the peoples.
 We are always ready to expand this area of understand-
 ing and confidence in each other. (Applause.) You say you
 have often heard from the people of our country that the
 Soviet and the Indian peoples are brothers. This is not
 only a slogan, it is actually so in reality. There is an old
 Indian saying that all the peoples of the world are brothers.
 But to our regret, suspicion, fear and mistrust still poison
 relations between nations. These relations will develop if
 we succeed in removing those fears and suspicions.
 I am very happy that if there was certain misunderstand-
 ing between our peoples, it has disappeared as a result
 of my visit to the Soviet Union and still more as a result
 of your visit to India. We now look confidently forward to
 the extension of the sphere of our co-operation not only for
 our mutual benefit, but in the interests of insuring world
 peace. Both you and we will whole-heartedly devote ourselves
 to this great cause. Peace is indivisible, and that is why
 we must strive for it everywhere, so that the violation of
 peace in one place will not affect the preservation of univer-
 sal peace.
 I hope that you will convey to your people our greetings
 and best wishes. Tell them what you have seen, because
 an eye-witness of friendship is better than any words. Millions
 of people in India who were very happy to see you will
 preserve for ever the good memories of your visit.
 I hope that your visit to India is not the last, but only
 the first visit. We shall be always happy to receive you
 here. And next time our people will welcome you as good
 old friends.
 (In conclusion Mr. Nehru proposed a toast to the health
 of N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov.)

 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN
 OVER ALL-INDIA RADIO
 December 13
 Dear friends,
 I am very grateful for this opportunity to speak over the
 Indian radio.
 Tomorrow we leave hospitable India, carrying away
 with us many fond and indelible memories of your country
 and your people. We shall never forget our friendly meet-
 ings with the people, or the hearty welcome they gave us.
 We visited many towns and districts during our stay in
 India. We went to construction projects and factories in
 Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore, Madras and Sindri, we saw
 centres of agricultural reconstruction, a number of scien-
 tific institutions, and wonderful gems of ancient architec-
 ture. We also acquainted ourselves with the life and work
 of your multi-national people, and with their art.
 What made the biggest and most unforgettable impres-
 sion on us was the people, their enthusiasm and energy,
 their buoyant youth, their talent and industry, their un-
 swerving desire for peace and co-operation with all peace-
 loving nations. Everywhere we went, the Indian people met
 us with hospitality and cordiality. We saw, everywhere, an
 expression of sincere and ardent friendship for the peoples
 of the Soviet Union.
 We have visited your country at a very important time
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 In its history, when, after a long period of colonial oppres-
 sion, the Indian people have gained the right to shape their
 own destiny.
 In her few years of political freedom India has made great
 progress. India now plays a big role in the settlement of
 major international problems.
 As we have seen for ourselves, the Indian people also
 have registered big achievements in advancing their economy,
 in industrial development.
 The friendly relations established between our countries
 make it possible to promote all-round economic, scien-
 tific and cultural co-operation. We are always ready to
 share our scientific and technical experience, our experience
 in construction, should India require it.
 Our visit to India has helped to reach agreement on a
 number of major problems pertaining to the continued
 expansion of economic, scientific and technical co-operation
 between our countries. It has enabled us to continue our
 talks with Mr. Nehru, the Prime Minister, and to establish
 contact with other leaders of the Indian state. This personal
 contact has reaffirmed that our countries have a common
 aim: to live in friendship, to preserve and consolidate world
 peace, to promote among the nations confidence in their
 morrow.
 You well know that the relations between the Soviet
 Union and the Republic of India are built on a solid and
 reliable basis, on the Five Principles, Panch Shila.
 The Soviet Union steadfastly adheres to the Leninist
 principles of respect for the territorial integrity and sover-
 eignty of other states and non-interference in their inter-
 nal affairs.
 The relations between the Soviet Union and India are a
 graphic example of friendship and co-operation between
 states with different political systems.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Our exchange of views with Mr. Nehru and a number of
 other Indian government leaders has shown that the Govern-
 ment of the Soviet Union and the Government of India have
 full understanding on all questions of Soviet-Indian re-
 lations, and also that their opinions concur on many major
 international problems. We are confident that the good-
 neighbourly relations and friendship between our countries
 will grow and strengthen. This will exercise a beneficial
 influence both on the development of our countries and on
 the consolidation of world peace.
 In conclusion, I should like to note the exceptionally
 warm welcome given us in India, in every town and dis- '
 trict we visited. I should like once again to thank your Gov-
 ernment, and Prime Minister Nehru personally, who did
 everything to make our stay in your country as pleasant
 .and useful as possible.
 I should like also to thank the governments and authori-
 ties in the states and cities we visited for the splendid or-
 ganization of our tour and for their warm welcome.
 I also express our sincere gratitude to the public organi-
 zations and citizens who warmly welcomed us and sent us
 sincere, heartfelt greetings. I deeply regret that time did
 not permit us to answer all the friendly invitations and
 greetings.
 Once again my hearty thanks to you, our dear friends.
 Good-byel

 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 OVER ALL-INDIA RADIO
 December 13
 Our  dear friends,
 Citizens and citizenesses of the Republic of India,
 We have been in your country for more than three weeks,
 during which we have visited many states, towns and vil-
 lages, acquainting ourselves with India's splendid people
 and her rich and ancient culture.
 We were deeply moved and touched by the friendly and
 most heartfelt reception given us, as representatives of
 the Soviet Union, both by the leaders of the Republic of
 India and by her people. This is something we shall never
 forget.
 We had known of the Indian people's friendly feelings
 for the Soviet Union, but what we have seen and felt here
 surpassed all our expectations. They were indescribable
 meetings; it is hard to find words to express the feelings
 that welled up in our hearts.
 In all the towns and villages we visited we heard and
 read mottoes of welcome in honour of the friendship between
 India and the Soviet Union. And most frequently of all
 we heard those simple words, coming straight from the
 heart, "Hindi Rusi bha'i bha'il"
 These words particularly moved us, for they fully express
 our feelings as well, the feelings of the peoples of the Soviet
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Union towards the peoples of India. Yes, our peoples
 are brothers, brothers always, in easy times and in hard
 times.
 The friendship between our peoples is a great, historic
 gain. It should be prized and strengthened to the utmost,
 for it is to the benefit of both our peoples.
 We are eager to promote to the utmost the historical
 friendship between our countries which is growing stronger
 all the time. We realize, however, that to uphold universal
 peace friendship must be promoted not only with one
 nation, even though a great one, but with all nations. It
 is essential that friendship among all the nations of
 the world should constantly grow and broaden. This is
 what the peace-loving peoples of all countries and conti-
 nents so sincerely and fervently desire. And we shall con-
 tribute in every way to that great and noble goal.
 We hope that the development of friendly relations. be-
 tween India and the Soviet Union will serve the cause of
 continued peace throughout the world and the develop-
 ment of our countries.
 Industrial development is essential for the swift advance-
 ment of  your country's economy. Without one's own
 national industry it is impossible to assure genuine state
 independence. We know that well from our own experience.
 We have visited a number of Indian national factories
 and mills, including large industrial establishments, and
 the construction sites of hydro-electric stations. With
 what pride our Indian friends showed us all that!
 We understand this pride, for in those establishments
 one can see the contours of India's future powerful industry,
 bulwark of her independence, of her national might.
 In -order to build :such an industry you need your own,
 national cadres, particularly cadres of engineers and tech-
 nicians. These cadres are growing in your country. We
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 saw young engineers and technicians, skilled' builders,
 who have sprung from the ranks of India's intellec ials.
 They are burning with a desire to work for the welfare of
 their country.
 But in order that you should have more such people
 we are ready to share with you our knowledge and the ex-
 perience we have accumulated, so that your country might
 accomplish the complex and difficult task of building
 your own industry more quickly than our country did.
 The reason we say this to you is not because we want
 to tell you what to do. No, we want to give the people of
 India, the Republic of India disinterested aid because
 we wish the free and sovereign Republic of India to develop
 and grow ? stronger.
 The Soviet Union and India are following different
 paths of development. Our stand has always been that a
 country's path of development is exclusively an internal
 matter for its peoples.
 Our relations with other states are based on the Five
 Principles, which are now shared by many countries. Peace-
 ful co-existence of states with different social systems is
 now an indisputable fact.
 During our stay in India we have received a great number
 of warm greetings and invitations to visit many Indian
 towns and districts. We regret that the comparative brief-
 ness of our stay in your country prevented us from accept-
 ing them all. I should therefore like to take advantage of
 this occasion to thank all our friends in India-all those
 we met and those we regrettably were unable to meet-for
 their friendly words of welcome and their kind wishes.
 We shall be glad to have any number of our Indian friends
 visit our own country. Visit us, see how we live and work,
 acquaint yourselves with our experience. You will always
 meet with a most cordial reception from our people. Mutual

 exchange of delegations will promote a further consolidation
 of the friendship between our peoples.
 Once again we express our gratitude to the Prime Min-
 ister of India, Mr. Nehru, and to the Government of India
 for' the honour of visiting your splendid country, for' the
 opportunity to see for ourselves your country and your
 industrious and talented people.

 MEETING
 OF N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. IIHRUSHCHOV
 WITH INDIAN M.P: S,
 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTARY
 ASSOCIATION
 FOR PROMOTION OF HINDI LANGUAGE
 December 13
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 Dear friends,
 Allow me to thank you with all my heart on my own
 behalf and on behalf of Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin
 for your warm and heartfelt reception. We greet your
 association and consider its work to be highly useful and
 fruitful for the Indian people and their cultural advance-
 ment.
 I must tell you frankly that before we came to your
 country we did not know it well enough. And we felt this
 most keenly when we arrived here. Our stay in India, brief
 as it has been, has helped us to fill in this gap to a consid-
 erable extent.
 N. A. Bulganin and I have discussed the question of doing
 everything possible on returning from India so that Soviet
 people might have greater opportunities to learn the Indian
 languages, Hindi in the first place, and we promise you that
 we shall do this.
 In order to know one another better, in order fully to de-
 velop economic and cultural ties between our countries, it
 is important to have direct contact, and a third language
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 as a means of communication between our two great peoples
 can hardly be.acceptable for long. We shall see to it that
 an educational institution is opened in our country in
 which our best and most gifted youth could learn Hindi
 and other Indian languages. This will help to promote
 still better understanding between our peoples and make
 it possible for us to know one another better.
 The British and American newspaper correspondents have
 been greatly annoyed with N. A. Bulganin and myself for
 our public speeches in your country and in Burma opposing
 the colonial regime. - They have no cause for offence. I do
 not think that there is anything in what we have said against
 colonialism that could cause antagonism between peoples.
 Our speeches must be understood as a denunciation of co-
 lonial robbery and the colonial order. If some people do not
 like what we said, that is purely a matter for their own con-
 science, but we are against colonialism and we shall contin-
 ue to say so always and everywhere.
 We have no wish to incite anyone against the United States
 of America and Britain, nor do we intend to quarrel with
 them ourselves. The Soviet Union wants to live in friendship
 with those countries. But that does not mean that we should
 hide the truth, that we should tell everyone, including the
 advocates of the colonial regime, only what they want
 to hear. Can we say that the centuries of British rule in
 India have been of benefit to the Indian people? We could
 never say such a thing. It would be a crime to say that.
 We speak of colonialism as an historical fact. I am sur-
 prised that our statements against colonialism, especially
 against the continuation of the colonial domination by Portu-
 gal of Goa and other Portuguese possessions on Indian territo-
 ry have prompted certain statesmen in the United States to
 come out in support of the Portuguese colonialists, on the
 grounds that these possessions have been held by Portugal
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 for nearly 400 years. No matter how many years have passed,
 stolen property remains stolen property and should be
 returned to its rightful owner. Stolen property ought to be re-
 turned and, what is more, with interest. That is, of course,
 if one has a conscience. (Stormy applause.)
 I should like to dwell on one other question. If I am not
 mistaken, the population of the Republic of India is 370
 million. India thus has the second largest population in the
 world after China. This makes India one of the most power-
 ful states on earth. (Applause.) The literature and art of
 the Indian people are on a very high level. India is one of
 the most ancient seats of world civilization. The talent
 of the Indian.people and their cultural level are reflected in
 the many historical monuments which one can find in any
 corner of India. Many of these structures were erected sev-
 eral thousand years ago. All this testifies to the greatness of
 India and her people. But hitherto India has not officially
 been considered one of the great world powers. It is custom-
 ary to count among the Great Powers the Soviet Union,
 the United States, Britain, France and China. For that
 matter, some Western politicians would like to deprive
 China too of the right to be considered a Great Power. Ab-
 surd as it is, in speaking of China they usually imply the
 Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched on Taiwan Island. And
 so, the five countries I mentioned are considered Great Pow-
 ers. Looking at it objectively, however, the question natu-
 rally arises: why is India not considered a great country?
 Evidently because the colonialists want to belittle your
 country and your people. To recognize India as a Great Power
 would mean altering their position. But we believe that
 India is a Great Power and that she ought to rank among
 the leading Great Powers of the world. (Stormy applause.)
 Here is something else I should like to say. N. A. Bulganin
 and myself are being accused by some people of setting the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9

 East in opposition to the West.71at, of course, is a downright
 invention. Our country represents both Europe and Asia.
 We have always been against setting any part of the world
 in opposition to another, against the domination of any con-
 tinent by another. (Applause.)
 We want all nations to be independent and to develop
 as they wish; we want them to promote their economy and
 culture in every way and to live in peace and friendship.
 (Applause.)
 We wish you success. We, for our part, will do everything
 in our power that the* friendship between our peoples, be-
 tween our two countries, may grow stronger and flourish.

 PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN
 BY N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 IN DELHI
 Decerynber 14
 On December 14 N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the
 U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, and N. S. Khrushchov,
 Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet,
 held a press conference for Indian, Soviet and other corre-
 spondents in Delhi. More than 150 journalists representing
 leading Indian, Soviet and other agencies and newspapers
 were present.
 N. A. Bulganin made the following statement.
 STATEMENT AT PRESS CONFERENCE
 We came to India on a visit of friendship at the invita-
 tion of the Indian Government. Our visit to India, like
 the friendly visit to the U.S.S.R. of Mr. Nehru last June,
 is of major significance for the further improvement of the
 friendly relations between our countries and for world peace.
 You already know of the Joint Soviet-Indian Declaration
 signed yesterday which sets forth the views of the states-
 men of the Soviet Union and India on the most important
 aspects of the relations between the two countries, and on
 cardinal international issues. This declaration is not only
 highly important in strengthening further the friendly
 relations between the Soviet Union and India; it is of great
 international significance as well.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 During our stay in India we have visited a number of
 towns and regions, big construction projects, industrial
 enterprises in Bombay, Calcutta, Bangalore, and Madras,
 agricultural reconstruction centres and scientific institu-
 tions, and have seen some remarkable monuments of ancient
 architecture. We have acquainted ourselves with the life
 and activities of the multi-national Indian people, with
 the progress they have made during the years of independ-
 ence, and have formed some idea of the vast natural re-
 sources and the potentialities of India. We have been most
 profoundly and unforgettably impressed by the great In-
 dian people, their buoyant children and youth, their talent
 and industry, their unswerving desire for peace and friendly
 co-operation with all countries. Wherever we went, we met
 with the hospitality and cordiality of the Indian people,
 evidence of their deep regard and friendship for the peoples
 of the Soviet Union.
 We were also greatly impressed by what the Indian people
 are doing to develop their national economy, especially
 their efforts to advance industry, which is the foundation
 of economic progress, the prime guarantee of the independ-
 ence of any country. The construction undertakings in
 the Damodar Valley and at Bhakra-Nangal, the projected
 construction of iron and steel mills, and the drafting of a
 new five-year plan are undoubtedly important measures
 undertaken by the Indian Government for the development
 of the country's economy.
 India has all the conditions for the successful development
 of her national economy: vast natural resources, huge areas
 of fertile land and, what is most important, the inexhaustible
 creative forces of the talented and hard-working Indian
 people, who have built undying cultural monuments in
 the course of their long history. We Soviet people, who have
 some experience in economic planning, have formed the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 opinion that India, with her present striving for economic
 development and for the full utilization of her material
 resources and manpower, will be able in a short time substan-
 tially to increase agricultural and industrial production
 and thereby considerably raise the living standards of her
 people.
 The friendly relations that have been established between
 our peoples create favourable conditions for close economic,
 scientific and cultural co-operation between our two coun-
 tries. The Soviet Union, as we have already said, is prepared
 to share its experience in the sphere of science and engi-
 neering on mutually advantageous conditions, to share its
 experience in economic planning and the construction of
 industrial enterprises and hydro-technical installations.
 It would also be glad to learn from the experience which
 the Indian people have accumulated in various branches
 of economy, science and culture. We believe that the expan-
 sion of cultural ties between India and the Soviet Union
 will serve to strengthen the bonds of friendship between
 our countries. We are happy to note that as a result of our
 visit to India and the talks we have had with Mr. Nehru
 and other Indian leaders agreement has been reached on a
 number of important questions connected with the further
 expansion of economic co-operation between tha Soviet
 Union and India.
 Our stay in India has left us with the firm conviction
 that the people of India are resolutely striving for peace
 and are ready to work vigorously for the maintenance and
 consolidation of peace.  India is playing an increasingly
 important role in deciding international problems and
 establishing friendly relations between states. There is
 not a single serious problem in Asia-and not only in
 Asia-that can be settled today without the participation
 of India and the Chinese People's Republic. A striking
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 example of the active and fruitful participation of India
 and the Chinese People's Republic in settling international
 issues is the part they played in bringing about the ter-
 mination of the war in Indo-China, and also their active
 participation in the work of the Bandung Conference, which
 played an outstanding role in reducing international ten-
 sion and promoting co-operation among the Asian and Afri-
 can countries.
 The Soviet Union and India are building and will con-
 tinue to build their relations on the basis of the famous
 Five Principles of peaceful co-existence, inasmuch as these
 principles accord with the interests of all peace-loving na-
 tions, the interests of peace. These principles fully conform
 to the foreign policy which the Soviet Government has pur-
 sued ever since the inception of the Soviet state. They have
 already been endorsed by a number of countries and formed
 the basis of the decisions of the Bandung Conference. The
 acceptance of these principles by all other countries, includ-
 ing the United States, Britain and France, would be an
 important step towards further relaxation of international
 tension and the establishment of the necessary confidence
 among nations. As for the Soviet Union, it always has pur-
 sued and will pursue 'a policy of peace and respect for the
 sovereign rights of nations, a policy of non-aggression, equal-
 ity ' and mutual benefit, non-interference in the internal
 affairs of other states,. a policy of. peaceful co-existence of
 states with different social and political systems. This pol-
 icy is determined by the very, nature of the Soviet state Iwhich
 has invariably and consistently: pursued a policy; of -peace.
 We all know that there are * many very pressing Far
 Eastern problems that still await solution. For one thing,
 the Indo-China problem can be fully and finally settled
 only on the basis of the decisions of the Geneva Conference
 on Indo-China. There must be no.lurther delay in settling

 the important question of granting the Chinese People's
 Republic its rightful place in the United Nations, the ques-
 tion of Taiwan and the other coastal islands-inalienable
 parts of C.P.R.'s territory-in accordance with the na-
 tional rights of the Chinese people.
 The Government of the Soviet Union has always been
 opposed to the organization of diverse military blocs in
 various parts of the world and to the creation of military
 bases on the territories of other states, inasmuch as the
 setting up of such blocs and bases constitutes a serious
 threat to peace and raises additional obstacles to the reduc-
 tion of international  tension and the consolidation of
 peace. We believe that genuine -security of the nations can
 be ensured not by setting up military blocs, but by the
 joint, collective efforts of states aimed at strengthening
 peace. It is this that prompted the Soviet Government to
 submit its proposal to establish a system of collective se-
 curity in Europe.
 The present arms drive and the continued production
 and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons are a dan-
 ger to peace and weigh heavily on the shoulders of the work-
 ing people, who bear all the burden of military expendi-
 ture. We know that reduction of armaments, the full and
 unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons
 are an urgent task confronting the states at the present time,
 and primarily the Great Powers. Until agreement is reached
 on this score, the Soviet Union will naturally be obliged to
 continue to concern itself with strengthening its own de-
 fence capacity and to produce atomic and hydrogen weap-
 ons. Under the circumstances we have no alternative.
 We take leave of the hospitable land of India, filled with
 gratitude to the Indian people, their Government and the
 administration of the states we visited for the exception-
 ally warm reception we were accorded everywhere. This

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 hospitable reception is evidence of the genuinely friendly
 feelings the Indian people cherish for the peoples of the
 Soviet Union. We assure our Indian friends that our Soviet
 people cherish the same warm feelings for the great people
 of India. We take this opportunity to convey hearty frater-
 nal greetings to all the people of India from the people of
 the Soviet Union.
 We trust that the friendship and co-operation between
 our two countries will continue steadily to grow stronger
 and broader to the benefit of our peoples and in the inter-
 ests of world peace.
 Summing up the results of our tour and the impressions
 we carry away with us, I should like to dwell on two more
 questions which, for reasons we well understand, deeply
 affect the Indian people. We refer to the question of the
 Indian territory of Goa, unlawfully held by Portugal, and
 the so-called Kashmir problem..
 In our public speeches in the course of our tour we have
 stated the position, of the Soviet Union on these questions.
 The Soviet Union resolutely advocates the abolition of
 the remnants of the moribund colonial system. It be-
 lieves that the peoples inhabiting territories unlawfully
 seized and brutally exploited for many decades by colonial-
 ists must themselves decide their own destinies.
 It is common knowledge that Goa is Indian territory.
 Everyone knows that the population of that territory is
 bound by inseparable ties of kinship with their Indian moth-
 erland and cannot endure to be severed from her. We are
 convinced that this question will be settled in favour of
 the Indian people whether the colonialists want it or not.
 The colonialists will have to get out of territory that does
 not belong to them.
 As for Kashmir, during our visit there we saw how great-
 ly the Kashmirians rejoice in their national liberation,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 regarding their territory as an integral part of the Republic
 of India. And we are deeply convinced that the people of
 Kashmir will solve all their problems without outside
 interference. That question will be decided according to the
 wishes of the peoples of Kashmir themselves.
 We believe that this statement will provide the answer
 to the many questions we have received yesterday and to-
 day from journalists. There were a great many of these
 questions. They could be divided into several groups.
 Firstly, many of you are interested in a number of con-
 crete aspects of Soviet-Indian economic co-operation, in
 the prospects of this co-operation, the spheres of economy it
 will extend to, etc. To this we may say that we are nego-
 tiating on this score with the Government of India at the
 present time. The initial results of these negotiations are
 known to you from the Joint Indo-Soviet Communique
 signed yesterday concerning economic relations between
 India and the U.S.S.R. We may also declare that there
 exist good grounds for the development of our economic
 relations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual ben-
 efit.
 Secondly, many non-Indian journalists are asking with
 assumed alarm whether the U.S.S.R. intends to make the
 strengthening and development of its friendly relations
 with India conditional on India's rejection of business
 co-operation with the United States and other Western
 countries. Only those who are interested in sowing dis-
 trust between India and the Soviet Union could put the
 question thus. We have said and we repeat that we are for
 peaceful co-operation and friendship with all countries,
 the United States, Britain and France included. The fear
 that Indo-Soviet friendship might jeopardize the relations
 of India or the Soviet Union with other states is utterly
 groundless.

 Thirdly, many correspondents want to know what are the
 further prospects of international relations. Some of them
 express concern at .the fact that certain circles-which
 circles, you know yourselves-have begun to assert that
 the Geneva spirit is dead, that the time has come to renew
 the "cold war" at full force, and so on.
 You see yourselves that there are some who are trying
 to return to the "cold war" in connection with our visit
 to India and Burma and our forthcoming visit to Afghani-
 stan. The things your irresponsible colleagues have been
 writing about our speeches! The garbled accounts they have
 given of them! But we Soviet people,do not suffer from a
 lack of sang-froid. Abuse gets one nowhere. We calmly ig-
 nore such outpourings. "Dirt doesn't stick to the clean,"
 as the saying goes.
 As regards the substance of this question, we believe
 that the spirit of Geneva, which arose as a result of the
 fruitful meeting of the Heads of the Four Great Powers
 in Geneva last summer, has played a. beneficent role and
 cannot be buried. We are for continuing and deepening in-
 ternational co-operation, for peaceful co-existence of all
 countries. And if the recent conference of the Foreign Min-
 isters of the Four Powers in Geneva did not yield the
 results which the nations of the world expected of it, that,
 as we have said, was only because the situation was evi-
 dently not yet ripe. It shows that some Powers have not
 yet  abandoned  the "position of strength" policy long
 .since- condemned. It must be said with all firmness that so
 -long as .this position is adhered to, negotiations cannot
 yield any results.
 At any rate the Soviet delegation at the Geneva Confer-
 ence, as you know, submitted a good number of important
 and practicable proposals on the questions of collective
 security, reduction of armaments and prohibition of atomic
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 weapons, expansion of international contacts, etc. It is
 therefore not our fault if no agreement has yet been reached.
 We shall continue to spare no effort for the settlement of
 these vital issues.
 In the same connection many correspondents ask whether
 the time has not come to call a new conference of the Heads
 of the Great Powers, after the pattern of the Geneva Con-
 ference, to discuss the most important of the Far Eastern
 problems. We believe that this idea is worth supporting.
 Of course, such a conference could produce favourable
 results only if all its participants cast aside the notorious
 "positions of strength" policy in examining the questions
 at issue. It goes without saying that the Chinese Peo-
 ple's Republic and India should take part in such a con-
 ference.
 We have received many questions concerning disarmament.
 We do not think it necessary to give once again a detailed
 exposition of our position on this question. It is sufficiently
 well known to you. The Soviet proposals on disarmament,
 submitted this year to the United Nations, open the way
 to a speedy and effective solution of the problem. And were
 it not for the sudden change in the position of the United
 States, which unexpectedly went back on its own earlier
 proposals, the solution of these problems might have been
 in sight. Some correspondents put the question thus: would
 the Soviet Union not agree to unilaterally reduce its own
 armaments to set an example to its Western partners?
 We think you will agree that this is hardly a serious
 approach to the question.
 How can the Soviet Union agree to unilateral disarma-
 ment at a time when our partners in the negotiations not
 only evince no intention of reducing their own armed forces,
 but, on the contrary, declare openly that they intend to
 build up their armaments still more? Under these circum-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 stances, to undertake unilateral disarmament would be stu-
 pid and harmful not only for the Soviet Union but for all
 the peace-loving nations.
 We are for disarmament on the clear and definite con-
 dition that our partners agree to disarm with us. We are
 for prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons if our part-
 ners are prepared to do this simultaneously with us. We
 are for establishing strict international control over the
 carrying out of these measures provided there is a realistic
 approach to the solution of this task.
 The fourth group of questions concerns the internal
 affairs of the Soviet Union. We appreciate the interest
 shown by Indian public opinion in the life of our country.
 In this connection we would be glad to see the Indian press
 represented by permanent correspondents in Moscow, as
 some of you have suggested here. We do not think it would
 be hard to solve the technical problems which are said to
 complicate the presence of permanent Indian correspond-
 ents in the U.S,S.R. at the present time. Judging by
 the questions put to us, India, like a number of other for-
 eign countries, still lacks objective information about our
 life, about the specific aspects of our economic, social and
 political system.
 For instance, it is asked: why is there only one party in
 the U.S.S.R.? This question evidently springs from a
 -lack of understanding of the fundamentals of our socialist
 society.
 As you know, it is in the nature of the bourgeois class
 state to have many parties; parties reflect and uphold the
 interests of their respective classes, and each class naturally
 has a party of its own. In the Soviet Union, as a result
 of the victory of socialism, an entirely new, socialist society
 has been established, in which there are no antagonistic
 classes, no groups whose interests might clash and conflict.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Today we have a homogeneous society, a society which is
 strong by virtue of its unity and solidarity.
 Pre-revolutionary, tsarist Russia had many parties.
 There was a party of the capitalists, a party of the land-
 lords, a kulak party which ambitiously called itself the
 Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and a party of the working
 class, the Bolshevik Party, founded by the great Lenin.
 This party was able to rally the working class to the strug-
 gle against the capitalists and landlords, against the tsar-
 ist regime. It was able to secure the alliance of the working
 class and the peasantry. This Party was able to win to the
 side of the working class the progressive intelligentsia, and
 under its leadership the Great October Socialist Revolution
 was carried out, the exploiting classes were defeated and
 abolished, and a new, socialist society was built. Now the
 Soviet people are successfully building a communist society.
 Whom could a party of capitalists and landlords represent
 today in the Soviet Union? We have no capitalists or land-
 lords, and hence the question of having such a party cannot
 even arise. Whom could a kulak party represent today in our
 country? With the establishment of the collective-farm sys-
 tem, we put an end for ever to the old economic system in
 the countryside which daily and hourly gave rise to capital-
 ism. Our young people today know about the kulaks only
 from books and from the accounts of people of the older
 generation.
 Soviet society is a society of working people, of the
 workers, peasants and working intellectuals. As has been
 recorded in the Constitution of the U.S.S.R., the Commu-
 nist Party is the vanguard of the working people in their
 struggle for the construction of a communist society, the
 leading force of all the working people's organizations, both
 public and state.
 Such is our society aitd such our system. We do not seek
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 to impose it upon anyone, but, frankly speaking, we believe
 that it is the best system. There are people who try to make
 it appear as if the spread of communist ideas all over the
 world is the result of some sort of intrigues on the part of
 the U.S.S.R., yet everybody knows that long before the
 October Revolution communism existed in Europe and the
 communist doctrine founded by Marx and Engels had struck
 root in the toiling masses.
 In this connection we would like to dwell also on another
 question put to us by some correspondents-concerning
 the Information Bureau of Communist Parties, or Comin-
 form, as it is sometimes called. The activities of this organ-
 ization to which the Communist Parties of a number of
 European countries belong and whose aim it is to exchange
 information and experience in the struggle of the working
 class for emancipation, worry all those who would like to
 perpetuate the old system of exploitation of man by man,
 which has outlived its time.
 Sometimes the question is put thus: Is there no way of
 abolishing the Cominform? But, after all, why should the
 Communist Parties deprive themselves of this generally
 accepted form of international contact and co-operation?
 Why, for instance, do those who seek the abolition of the
 Cominform not object to the activities of the Socialist
 International, which unites the Social-Democratic Parties?
 Why should they consider it natural and legitimate for
 capitalists to unite in international monopoly combines and
 meet regularly in order jointly to transact their business,
 while denying the working class the right to give effect to
 the great slogan of international solidarity, "Workers of
 all countries, unite!" proclaimed by Marx and Engels and
 corresponding to the vital interests of all the working people?
 We have always stood and always will stand for the
 strengthening and development of international co-operation

 of the working class in defence of the vital interests of all
 working people, and in the struggle for peace.
 The Communist Parties, which stand guard over the
 interests of the working class and all working people, fol-
 low the most progressive and humane of all teachings-
 the teaching of Marxism-Leninism, the application of which
 in the Soviet Union, the Chinese People's Republic and the
 People's Democracies has so brilliantly proved its worth.
 This teaching is spreading more and more over the whole
 world. We are against any "export of revolution," as Lenin
 said, for to speak of anything of the kind would be unscien-
 tific. Progressive ideas inevitably make their own way and
 triumph over old, outdated ideas. Thus it has always been,
 thus it will be in the development of human society.
 Such are the remarks we wished to make in connection
 with your questions.
 Allow me in conclusion to thank you for your attention.
 Good-bye.
 At the close of the press conference N. S. Khrushchov
 thanked the Indian journalists for their impartial and
 truthful reporting of the visit of N. A. Bulganin and N. S.
 Khrushchov to India, and observed that such unbiassed
 reporting serves to strengthen friendly relations between
 India and the Soviet Union.

 DEPARTURE
 OF N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. HHRUSHCHOY
 FROM INDIA
 December 14
 SPEECH BY N. A. BULGANIN AT PALAM AIRFIELD
 Mr. Prime Minister, friends,
 The time has come for us to leave your hospitable land.
 We have seen and learned a great many fine things dur-
 ing our tour of India. It is hard to describe the wealth of
 impressions we have obtained in the course of our eventful
 visit. Most unforgettable of all were our meetings with the
 people of India, who gave such a sincere expression of their
 friendly feelings for the Soviet Union. We shall tenderly
 cherish these friendly feelings in our hearts.
 In the course of our visit we have seen something of
 India's past, the unforgettable monuments of your ancient
 culture, created by the skilled hands of Indian craftsmen.
 We have seen your present too-your towns and rural
 localities, and the efforts which the people and the Govern-
 ment of India are devoting to the development of your in-
 dustry and agriculture.
 We wish you success with all our heart.
 The most important result of our visit to India is that it
 will strengthen and promote still further the. friendship
 between our nations. The friendship of the Indian and So-
 viet peoples is a great historical achievement.
 Personal contact between our Governments, which began
 with the visit of Prime Minister Nehru to the Soviet Union,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 has been deepened and consolidated by our visit to India.
 During our stay here we have had extremely useful talks
 with Mr. Nehru and other members of the Government of
 the Republic of India. These talks were conducted in an
 atmosphere of cordiality and friendship.
 The Joint Declaration which was signed yesterday is a
 document of great historical significance. It is an important
 contribution to the cause of peace.
 Permit me to express to you, Mr. Prime Minister, and to
 the Government of India and all the Indian people our most
 profound gratitude for your hospitality and your affection
 for us.
 Long live Indian-Soviet friendship!
 Good-bye!

 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOti
 Dear friends,
 In a few minutes we shall leave the capital of the country
 of the great Indian people.
 The reception we have been accorded by the Government
 and the people of India has been exceptionally warm and
 cordial. I wish once again to express my gratitude and ap-
 preciation to the esteemed Prime Minister of India, Mr.
 Nehru, the President of the Republic of India, Mr. Prasad,
 the Government of India and the great Indian people for
 the courtesy and kindness shown us throughout our stay in
 India.
 In the course of our visits to the different towns and
 states of India we constantly heard many kind, ardent words
 about the friendship between our peoples. This friendship
 will continue to grow ever stronger, for it is surely one of
 the sources of strength for world peace.
 We are happy that our visit to the Republic of India
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 has served this noble cause. But our trip and our talks with
 the leaders of India would not have yielded such tangible
 and valuable results had we not met with the necessary un-
 derstanding on the part of our Indian friends.
 The identity of the views of India and the Soviet Union
 on the further strengthening of friendship between our two
 countries and on major international issues has found ex-
 pression in the Joint Soviet-Indian Declaration signed yester-
 day. Dear friends, when Mr. Nehru, on the termination of
 his tour of the Soviet Union, took leave of our country and
 its people he said that he had left a part of his heart in our
 country. And now as we take leave of you, of the great
 people of India, 1 realize how true are these simple but
 profound words. Part of my heart, too, will remain here in
 India. And in my heart there has grown and become
 firmly rooted an ardent love for India and her people. We
 are happy to have gained so many great, good friends here;
 we are happy that the friendship between our two countries
 has become stronger than ever.
 . Never has the friendship of our peoples and countries been
 darkened by enmity or conflict. And we are deeply convinced
 that it never will be. We shall do everything in our power
 to foster the friendship between the peoples of our coun-
 tries so that it may be eternal and unbreakable.
 Good-bye, dear friends! Till we meet  again!
 Namaste/
 The speeches by N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov were
 repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause. Their conclud-
 ing words were drowned in enthusiastic cheers of "Bulganin
 and Khrushchov zindabad!" (Long live Bulganin and Khru-
 shchov!), "Hindi Rusi bha'i bha'il" (Indians and Russians
 are ,brothers!)

 SPEECH BY JAWAHARLAL NEHRU
 "Eminent guests, dear friends,
 "A short while ago Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchov first
 set foot on Indian soil. Today these guests are leaving our
 country. The last few days which they have spent here are
 a great historic event, and many pages of our history will
 be devoted to those days."
 Nehru went on to say that India had entered a new stage
 of her life. He said: "What is our goal? Our goal is to achieve
 progress for our country and our common people, and to
 live in friendship and harmony with others. World peace
 is very essential, very important for the attainment of that
 goal. It is also quite indispensable that our relations with the
 great country which is our neighbour should be close rela-
 tions based on friendship and co-operation."
 Referring to the speeches made by N. A. Bulganin and
 N. S. Khrushchov the day before, Nehru continued: "Yes-
 terday you said that friendship between India and the So-
 viet Union was not directed against any other country.
 We wish to be friendly with each and every country, in
 order that the range of our friendship may expand and
 that co-operation and peace may prosper. What friendship
 can there be if it envisages hostility to others? We must be
 friendly with all, and we hold out our hand to all. For this
 reason, our rapprochement with that great country-the So-
 viet Union-is very important. But it does not imply that
 we are moving away from any other country. That is not
 so now, nor will it be so in the future. We have always de-
 sired, and we desire now, co-operation between the countries
 of the world with a view to promoting universal peace."
 The Prime Minister further said that a free and frank
 exchange of ideas was an important element of friendship
 between India and the Soviet Union. "The importance of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 this friendship; he said, "lies In the fact that we respect
 each other's ideas and methods, although sometimes we may
 hold different views or go different ways. The cause of world
 peace will be promoted if we show tolerance to each other
 and strive for co-operation between all countries. Thus we
 are setting an example of friendship with all countries,
 using their experience and following our own course. This
 is what Panch Shila stands for."
 With reference to the Joint Declaration, Nehru said: "If
 you read that document carefully you will see that it con-
 tains nothing indicative of hostility towards anyone. It is
 a document of friendship and co-operation between India
 and the Soviet Union." He said that both India and the So-
 viet Union desired peace all over the world and wanted to
 march towards peace, that they desired major problems to
 be settled by peaceful means. "Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khru-
 shchov have just described this document as a historic one.
 It clearly marks a rapprochement between the two coun-
 tries. This is a very important matter.
 "During their tour," Nehru continued, "the Soviet leaders
 have seen many old and new aspects of India. They have
 looked into the hearts of millions of Indians." Addressing
 N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov he said, "you had a
 chance to get an idea not only of the old times but of the
 desires of our people today and of the fact that we want to
 see them fulfilled.
 "On behalf of the Government of India, on my own be-
 half, and on behalf of our people I thank the Soviet leaders
 for having come here and voiced their friendship towards
 the Indian people. I should also like to thank them for hav-
 ing expressed their readiness to help us in various ways
 and to promote friendship between our countries. The last
 few days will be memorable not only to me. India will
 likewise remember them long."

 MESSAGE
 OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU,
 PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA,
 TO N. A. BULGANIN
 AND N. S. KHR USHCHO V
 I am deeply grateful to you for the message you sent me
 while crossing the border of our country. Your tour of
 India was a historic event which has left indelible impres-
 sions in the minds of our people. We, who were in close con-
 tact with you during your short stay here, are saddened by
 your departure. We hope, however, that both, our personal
 friendship and friendship between our states will grow and
 bear rich fruit for the great cause of world peace and co-
 operation.
 I send you best wishes from my people and myself.

 RETURN
 OF N. A. BULGANIN AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 TO MOSCOW
 December 21
 BALLY OF THE PEOPLE OF MOSCOW
 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOY
 Comrades, dear friends,
 Allow me first of all to express our heartfelt thanks for
 this exceptionally warm and stirring welcome.
 We have returned home from our month's tour of three
 friendly countries, India, Burma and Afghanistan, full of
 memorable impressions. The biggest impression of all was
 made on us by the tremendous love and sincerest respect
 which the peoples of India, Burma and Afghanistan en-
 tertain for our country, for the peoples of the Soviet Union.
 We accepted the invitations of the respective Govern-
 ments to visit India, Burma and Afghanistan because we
 had a clear and simple aim: to strengthen still further the
 friendship and co-operation that had been established be-
 tween those countries and the Soviet Union.
 We endeavoured to  carry out  this task with credit,
 firmly convinced that strong friendship between the peoples
 of our countries will benefit the nations and serve the cause
 of world peace. I think it was a useful trip which will bring
 positive results.
 I lack words to express the heartiness, the enthusiasm,
 we felt on the part of the great people of India. This was a
 manifestation of the brotherly, exceptionally heartfelt love
 of the peoples of India for the peoples of the Soviet Union.

 We were very warmly received by the Prime Minister
 of Indian Mr. Nehru, and his colleagues.
 In the cities of India, hundreds of thousands of people,
 millions, in fact, came out to welcome us. And everywhere
 we went we heard and read these simple words, coming
 straight from the hearts of the Indian people:
 "Friendship for ever!"
 "Long live the friendship of the peoples of India and the
 Soviet Union!"
 "Russians and Indians are brothers!
 That was the voice of the great people of India.
 And we said to them: yes, we are brothers! Brothers not
 only in days of peace but in hard times as well. We are
 brothers in the struggle for a better future for mankind,
 in the struggle for peace throughout the world!
 In Burma and Afghanistan both the people and their
 leaders met us with the same friendliness and hospitality. -
 True, the meetings there were not so large as in India,
 but there was the same ardent love of the peoples for the
 Soviet Union, for our great Soviet people.
 When we saw this brotherly love of the Asian peoples
 for our country, we thought of Moscow, and in our mind's
 eye there arose a picture of that great titan, the Soviet
 people, a people of heroes, a people of builders. It is to
 them, the Soviet people, that our country owes its great-
 ness. It is they, the Soviet people, who, led by their Com-
 munist Party, have raised our country to such a height and
 transformed it from backward Russia into the most advanced
 and mighty power in the world. It is they, the Soviet
 people, who built socialism, thus embodying mankind's
 dream in the life and affairs of our Homeland.
 Our hearts overflowed with pride that we were sons of
 the great Soviet people, its envoys and servants.
 In our speeches in India, Burma and Afghanistan we

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 exposed the criminal policy of the colonialists, whose
 long years of rule in those countries caused the peoples tre-
 mendous damage and greatly hindered their economic
 development.
 The peoples of India, Burma and Afghanistan approved
 of what we said, for we spoke the truth.
 But what furious hatred did our words draw from cer-
 tain public figures in bourgeois countries, and particularly
 from reactionary newspapers and magazines!
 This hatred is fully understandable. The colonial system
 Is collapsing. It has already gone bankrupt in Asia. In many
 countries-the  Korean  People's  Democratic Republic,
 the  Democratic Republic  of Viet-Nam, the Republic
 of India, the Union of Burma, and others-the people have
 freed themselves from the colonial regime and are consoli-
 dating their national independence.
 This is to say nothing of our great friend 'and brother, the
 Chinese people, who, under the leadership of their Commu-
 nist Party, have expelled from their land for all time the
 colonialists who tormented them. The Chinese people have
 defeated their internal enemies, and firmly taken the path
 of building socialism.
 That is a blow from which the world system of colonial-
 ism will never recover.
 The colonial regimes are a disgrace to mankind today.
 We have said that and we shall never stop reiterating it
 as long as colonialists exist.
 Comrades, dear friends, there are many things I should
 like to tell you about our big and very eventful tour.
 But that cannot be done in a single speech-a speech,
 moreover, made when we have just arrived in Moscow.
 We met all kinds of people, members of all classes.
 The workers, peasants and intellectuals sincerely admire
 our country's achievements and heartily endorse them.

 a convinced champion of peace.
 And India, China and the Soviet Union, as Lenin taught
 us, are an invincible force.
 Comrades, our trip to India, Burma and Afghanistan took
 place at a time when the entire Soviet.Land has been pre-
 paring to meet the 20th Congress of the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union in 'a worthy manner.
 We approach the 20th Party Congress with big successes
 both in the further consolidation of the Soviet socialist
 state and in the strengthening of our country's international
 position. But that does not give us any right to rest con-
 tent.
 Our task is to develop our national economy, and partic-
 ularly its foundation, heavy industry, to the utmost, to
 assure a continued advance in all brapches of agriculture,
 to strengthen the friendship among ity the of all peoples
 e members our
 country and the moral and political
 of our socialist society.
 We are marching along the right road to our great goal:
 the building of communism in our country.

 organizer of all our victories)
 Long live our Soviet .Homeland, bulwark of the peace
 and security of national (Stormy applause.)

 SPE1C$ $y N. A. BULGANIN
 Dear comrades,
 Words cannot describe how happy W,  A
 loved Moscow again and to meet you, dear' to see our be-
 I thank you deeply for this warm and.. ea t
 Our tour, a splendid tour in all respecu  as welcome
 than a month. Of course, one month is not enough to gain
 a good knowledge of India, Burma and Afghanistan, of all
 aspects of life in these countries, particularly in such a great
 country as India. For all that, we saw and learned much.
 As you know, we visited the capitals of these countries,
 Delhi, Rangoon and Kabul, and also many of the biggest
 towns, industrial  districts  and  construction  projects,
 agricultural establishments, and educational, medical and
 research institutions. We met and talked with statesmen
 and with members of various sections and classes of so-
 ciety. We had meetings with the people, with millions of
 ordinary people, with intellectuals, with workers in fac-
 tory and field. They all expressed their warmest and most
 sincere feelings towards us. They welcomed us as their dear-
 est guests, as their best and closest friends, as brothers.
 A feeling of great pride in our country welled up in our
 hearts at the sight of the unforgettable enthusiasm with
 which we, representatives of the Soviet people, were wel-
 comed in the towns and villages.
 Everywhere we went the people expressed their heart-
 iest gratitude towards the Soviet Union for its foreign
 policy of peace, for its policy of friendship and co-operation
 among nations.
 We saw that the enthusiasm and joy with which we were
 met everywhere by the peoples of India, Burma and Afghani-
 stan were an expression of friendship and love for the Soviet
 Union, for the Soviet people who, under the leadership of
 their Communist Party, have so glorified their country.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 We saw that the countries we visited are peace-loving
 countries, that their peoples and governments desire peace-
 ful co-operation will all states. That is the main thing
 that draws us together, that creates the necessary condi-
 tions for friendship and co-operation.
 Peace is th     atest, blessing the nations can have. And
 friendship and co-operation between the peoples of the
 Soviet Union and the peoples of India, Burma and Afghani-
 stan are a great factor for .international peace.
 Friendship and co-operation among the Soviet Union,
 India, Burma and Afghanistan are a factor for peace which
 the opponents of peace and co-operation among the nations
 cannot help taking into account.
 The five great principles' of peaceful co-existence and
 co-operation-that is the basis on which we build our rela-
 tions with countries having different social and political
 systems. More and more states, as we see, are subscribing
 to these principles.
 Our friendship with. great India, with Burma and with
 Afghanistan is a splendid example of the triumph of the
 Leninist foreign policy principles of the Soviet state. It
 is a great and historic gain.
 Our trip showed us how very important personal con-
 tacts among statesmen are for establishing mutual under-
 standing and friendly relations, for all-round co-operation
 and ties between countries. Our contacts with the leaders of
 India, Burma and Afghanistan helped us to come to know one
 another better, to bring out common view-points on major
 international problems, and to find the right path to the
 solution of questions pertaining to co-operation and relations.
 You know from the press that a result of our visit to
 India, Burma and. Afghanistan was the publication of
 joint declarations. These historic documents mark a new
 stage in the development of relations between the Soviet

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Union and each of those three . countries. Our common
 striving for friendship and co-operation also led to good
 results in the talks on extending commercial, economic,
 cultural and other relations. These relations are based on
 our unvarying principle of equality and mutual benefit.
 We stand for such economic co-operation and relations as
 do not involve any political conditions or obligations.
 Our tour had such rich and beneficial results thanks to
 the exceptional courtesy and hospitality shown us by the
 esteemed Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, the
 esteemed Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, and the es-
 teemed Prime Minister of Afghanistan, Mohammed Daoud.
 I take advantage of this occasion to convey to them, again
 and again, our heartfelt thanks.
 And so, the most important result of our trip to great India,
 to Burma and to Afghanistan was a further rapprochement
 between the Soviet Union and these countries, a further de-
 velopment of friendship and co-operation among our peoples.
 Not everybody, however, likes that. Our tour and our
 speeches, particularly the speeches by Nikita Sergeyevich
 Khrushchov, aroused not only stormy approval from friends
 but also stormy indignation from the reactionary press
 and certain prominent public figures and statesmen in West-
 ern countries, especially in Britain. Our only comment is:
 they do not like our frank statements about their colonial
 policy, they do not like our friendship with India, Burma
 and Afghanistan, but we like this friendship very much and
 it suits us very much. This friendship among nations has
 strengthened the front of the peace-loving countries, has giv-
 en it still greater unity. The front of the peace-loving coun-
 tries has become stronger than ever. It will grow still strong-
 er, and we are confident that it will triumph! (Applause.)
 Long live friendship and co-operation among nations-the
 greatest factor for world peace! (Applause and cheers.)

 REPORT
 BY N. A. BULGANIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE
 U.S.S.R.
 COUNCIL OF MINISTERS,
 ON THE VISIT TO INDIA, BURMA AND
 AFGHANISTAN
 DEUTERED AT FOURTH SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET
 OF THE U.S.S.R.
 December 29, 195
 Comrade Deputies, this session of the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. is meeting in the closing days of 1955, a year
 of important international developments that led to major
 changes in the relations between states.
 The outgoing year will go down in history as a year of
 a definite change in the tension which has characterized the
 international situation in recent times. No little credit for
 this must be put down to the efforts of the Soviet Union
 to guarantee peace and security of nations, to strengthen
 confidence among nations, and to promote broad political,
 gapoomic and cultural intercourse between countries, regard-
 lesJ of their social and political systems.
 For Soviet foreign policy, 1955 was a year of exceptionally
 active and persistent efforts to consolidate peace, les-
 sen international tension, and-extend co-operation between
 nations and states. Nobody can now deny that the efforts
 made by tie Soviet Union in this direction have been
 crowned by notable achievement.
 A  big contribution to the promotion of peace was,
 undoubtedly, the development of friendship and co-operation
 between the Soviet Union and India, Burma and Afghani-
 stan, countries which Comrade Khrushchov and I recently
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 visited. This visit was a graphic manifestation of the
 peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet state, end a fitting
 conclusion of 1955, a year rich in important international
 events. (Applause.)
 The immediate result of our visit to India, :3urma and
 Afghanistan was to strengthen and broaden the relations of
 friendship and co-operation between the Soviet Union and
 these countries, and to bring the Soviet people into closer
 contact with the great people of India and the peoples of
 Burma and Afghanistan. But its importance is not confined
 to this.
 The visit acquired tremendous international signifi-
 cance, primarily because it reaffirmed the correctness of the
 basic, Leninist principle of Soviet foreign policy, t.ie principle
 of peaceful co-existence of countries with different social
 and political systems. It demonstrated clearly a:id convinc-
 ingly that this principle is a reliable basis for strengthen-
 ing world peace and security and for promoting confidence
 among states.
 We know that the Asian countries, whose inhabitants
 constitute more than half the population  of the globe,
 are becoming an increasingly important factor in the inter-
 national affairs of our time. For centuries th -1 peoples of
 many Asian countries had been, and some of thorn still are,
 victims of harsh colonial oppression. Seeking; to justify
 their policy and their domination over the Asian peoples,
 the colonialists sought, and still seek, to port:?ay them as
 backward peoples, culturally and socially. But i; should not
 be forgotten that historically the development'A the Asian
 peoples began long before the peoples of Europe entered the
 arena of history. And if in recent centuries social and polit-
 ical development in Asia was retarded and lagged behind,
 this was the fault not of the Asian peoples, but of the colonial-
 ists who established in the countries of Asia-and not only
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of Asia, but of Africa as well-a system of administration
 based on violence, robbery and inhuman exploitation of
 the people. This system is a source of fabulous wealth for
 the colonialists, but for the oppressed peoples of Asia and
 Africa it spells poverty and dire suffering.
 This situation prevailed for a long time, but it could.not
 last for ever. To all who had the slightest acquaintance with
 the laws of social development, it was clear that a national-
 liberation movement was bound to develop in the Asian
 countries and would acquire ever greater dimensions. And
 it did. The Asian peoples began to awaken and straighten
 their backs. This great awakening was stimulated by the
 Great October Socialist Revolution in our country, and by
 the weakening of the colonial powers as a result of the two
 world wars, especially the second.
 Speaking of the countries of the East, our great teacher
 Lenin said on more than one occasion that the masses of
 these countries would inevitably rise to put an end to their
 unequal position and become independent builders of a new
 life. The time would come, Lenin said, when Asia's millions
 would become an active factor in world history and take part
 in shaping the destiny of mankind. That time has come.
 Today we see that the colonial system is crumbling in Asia
 and throughout the East.
 The great Chinese people, led by the Communist Party of
 China, are stepping out along the broad highway of nation-
 al                                 regeneration and independence,  building a socialist
 society in their country. The historic victory of the Chinese
 people has tremendously influenced the whole situation in
 Asia and the East generally. It has given a new impetus to
 the -national-liberation movement of the colonial and de-
 pendent peoples.
 The colonial yoke has been thrown off by the people
 of the great land of India and the people of Burma. Inspired

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 by the urge to revive and- regenerate their countries, these
 peoples have now entered a period of independent economic
 and political development.
 The path of freedom and independence has been taken
 by Indonesia and other Eastern countries.
 A movement for the consolidation of national independ-
 ence is acquiring ever broader scope in the Arab countries.
 Active struggle for emancipation is being waged by the peo-
 ples of Africa.
 Comrade Deputies, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchov and
 I spent three weeks in India. And from the moment we set
 foot on Indian soil to the moment of our departure from that
 hospitable country,  we were surrounded by friendship
 and regard of the Indian people. They displayed the warmest
 friendship for us, and welcomed us with enthusiasm as the
 representatives of the Soviet Union. (Prolonged applause.)
 For that reason, our visit to India may be called a meeting
 with the great Indian people. (Applause.)
 When we left for India, we knew that this was a friendly
 country and that a warm welcome awaited us. But what we
 saw and heard surpassed all expectations. Descending from
 the plane on our arrival in Delhi, we saw people who had
 come to meet us, headed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru,
 and an immense crowd, and heard the continuous roar of
 many thousands of voices. The people cried to. us in words
 we could not understand, in words of their own language.
 But we knew that those were words of friendship and joy,
 for they rang so heartily and sincerely. Here, we felt, were
 true friends of the Soviet people, here were our brothers.
 (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 In Delhi, nearly a million people came to meet us on
 the Ramlila Square. It was an unforgettable sight. The
 great square surged with excitement, cries of greeting came
 from all sides, we saw streamers with the words in Russian:

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 !`Indians and Russians are brothers!" (applause); "Long live
 Indian-Soviet friendship!" (applause); "Long live world
 peace!" (applause); "Welcome to us, our dear guests from the
 Soviet Union!" (Applause.) These greetings came straight
 from the hearts of the Indian people. (Applause.)
 We realized with pride that the enthusiasm with which
 the. Indian people welcomed us was meant for our glorious
 country, for the great Soviet people who, led by the Commu-
 nist Party, carried out the Great October Socialist Revolu-
 tion, routed numberless external and internal enemies and,
 unswervingly adhering to the general line of our Party, estab-
 lished the first socialist state in the world. (Applause.)
 The Indian people welcomed us so heartily because we
 represented the peoples of the Soviet Union who upheld
 their achievements in a grim struggle against the fascist
 hordes in the Great Patriotic War, and are now work-
 ing with unflagging constructive energy to build a new,
 communist society. (Applause.)
 We realized that the achievements, the successes and
 victories of our country are appreciated and prized by the
 Indian people, are hailed by them sincerely and whole-
 heartedly.
 It is with deep emotion also that we recall the meetings
 with the Indian people in Bombay, Poona, Coimbatore,
 Bangalore, Madras, Jaipur, Srinagar and other cities. But
 the most vivid, the most unforgettable impression was made
 on us by our meeting with the population of Calcutta. For
 days before our arrival, people had-been flowing in from the
 surrounding towns and villages. The Prime Minister, Mr. Neh-
 ru, came to Calcutta. The newspapers reported afterwards
 that we had been welcomed in the streets of the city by more
 than three million people. It was a surging and tumultuous
 sea of human beings, Here,. too, we heard warm words of
 greeting, words of friendship and affection for the Soviet

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Union. We were told that many who attended that meeting
 in Calcutta had come to the square the day before in order
 to be sure of a place near to the platform.
 We witnessed manifestations of friendship for us, as the
 representatives of the Soviet people, not only in the cities
 but in the small villages, where men and women, old and
 young, lined the roads to meet and welcome us. Here, too,
 we heard joyous cries in honour of our country.
 We were deeply impressed by our meeting with the
 members of the Indian Parliament, who received us most
 cordially and listened with deep attention to and warmly
 applauded our speeches. We were warmly and hospitably
 received by the statesmen of India and the governments of
 the states we visited. They did much to make our stay in
 India pleasant and useful.
 In Delhi, we were the guests of the President of India,
 Mr. Prasad. We stayed at his residence. Mr. Prasad did
 everything to make Comrade Khrushchov, myself, and our
 companions feel comfortable and at home in his residence.
 We had several talks with him. We transmitted to him a
 message from Comrade Voroshilov, President of the Presid-
 ium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. Mr. Prasad expressed
 deep gratitude for the message and tendered us a reply for
 transmission to Comrade Voroshilov.
 We had meetings, with the Vice-President of India,
 Mr. Radhakrishnan, an outstanding statesman who, as the
 Speaker of Parliament, received us cordially and said.many
 kind things about the Soviet Union in his speech.
 Special mention should be made of our meetings with
 the Prime Minister o'f India, Mr. Nehru, one of the most
 distinguished statesmen of our time. (Prolonged applause.)
 All our meetings with Mr. Nehru were marked by sincere
 friendship. Wherever we went, we were conscious of his
 kindness and solicitude.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Warm and sincere esteem and friendship for the Soviet
 people were also expressed by the peoples of Burma and
 Afghanistan, whom we met later. In the towns and villages
 of Burma and in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, the people
 welcomed us with joy and sympathy as the representatives
 of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.
 In Delhi and other Indian cities, and in Rangoon and
 Kabul, it was said that never before had these cities witnessed
 such a friendly and impressive welcome as was accorded to
 us, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the Soviet
 people.
 During our stay in India we were able to acquaint our-
 selves with many aspects of the life of the people. The Indian
 Government made it possible for us to tour the western,
 eastern, southern and northern parts of the country. Using
 our Soviet FIJI-1411 plane, designed by Sergei Vladimirovich
 Ilyushin, we flew 22,500 kilometres, including some 10,000
 kilometres in India alone. We visited various parts of India,
 many cities and villages, building sites and industrial enter-
 prises, government farms and many cultural establishments,
 and saw remarkable memorials of India's rich and ancient
 culture.
 For nearly two centuries. India had been ruled by British
 colonialists for whom this rich land was an agrarian, raw-
 material adjunct of the metropolitan country, a market for
 its manufactures. Naturally, the British had no desire to
 develop industry in India. That is the way of all colonialists,
 whose aim is to squeeze the greatest possible profit out of
 the colonies and to give them nothing, or practically noth-
 ing, in return.
 Having thrown off the colonial yoke and regained their
 independence, the Indian people,guided by their Government,
 proceeded to the economic development of their country.
 The first achievements have been registered in this direction.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 We visited India's principal industrial area, which has been
 developed in the past few years. It lies at the junction of the
 States of Bihar and West Bengal, in the valley of the River
 Damodar. Metallurgical, engineering and chemical works
 are located here; there are coal and ore mines in the area.
 In Chittaranjan we saw the new locomotive works. This
 is a government enterprise which began making locomotives
 in 1950. While we were there it turned out its 300th
 locomotive. The Indians are proud of this works-the first-
 born of their engineering industry. The engineers who showed
 us round stressed that more than 80 per cent of the locomo-
 tive parts were made in the works itself.
 We also visited an artificial fertilizer factory in Sindri.
 This is another new government enterprise and it plays an
 important part in the economy of India whose agriculture is
 in great need of mineral fertilizers. The town of Sindri, which
 has grown up around the factory, is only four or five years old.
 India is an agricultural country; more than three-quarters
 of her population are tillers. One of the most important
 problems connected with increasing India's agricultural
 output is artificial irrigation. Unirrigated fields yield poor
 crops, and the Indian Government is making a great effort
 to develop a powerful irrigation system.
 We made a detailed inspection of one of India's biggest
 construction projects, the Bhakra-Nangal development,
 where a big dam is being built, to be followed by a power
 station. This big development has been conceived on broad
 and bold lines; and interesting solutions have been found
 for a number of technical problems. But the most interest-
 ing thing we saw was the remarkable labour enthusiasm
 of the people-the workers and engineers-who are building
 the project. The Bhakra-Nangal scheme reminded us of the
 atmosphere of our first five-year plan, when we were building
 our first big enterprises.

 The Indian Government is seeking for ways and means
 of developing agriculture within the framework of private
 landownership. For this purpose, it is carrying out in the
 rural areas measures known as the Community Projects and
 the National Extension Service Development Programme.
 We were told that these programmes now embrace about
 20 per cent of the villages of India, and that it is intended in
 the period of the second five-year plan to extend this system
 of agrarian development to the whole country.
 We visited a number of government farms. These are
 small but well-organized undertakings which, in our opinion,
 are undoubtedly doing valuable work as experimental farms.
 While in India, we saw for ourselves that, now that they
 have thrown off the colonial yoke, the Indian people are
 capable of advancing boldly along the road of industrial
 progress and building an economically independent state.
 We also had ample evidence of how deeply the Indian people
 desire peace and co-operation with other countries.
 The visit of the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru,
 to the Soviet Union this summer already revealed the iden-
 tity of interests of the Soviet Union and India in working
 for peace and international security, and this found reflec-
 tion in the first Joint Soviet-Indian Statement signed in
 Moscow on June 22, 1955.
 In our conversations with Prime Minister Nehru and
 other Indian statesmen during our stay in Delhi, we again
 exchanged views both on questions relating to the_ further
 extension of friendly co-operation between the Soviet Union
 and India and on major international problems. These
 talks resulted in the Joint Soviet-Indian Declaration of
 December 13.
 In this historic document, which is of great international
 importance, the two Governments reaffirmed their adher-
 ence to the principles of respect for each other's territorial
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference
 in each other's internal affairs for any motives of an econom-
 ic, political or ideological nature, equality and mutual
 benefit, and peaceful co-existence. These principles are a
 reliable basis for the peaceful co-existence of states with
 different social and political systems. The Soviet Government
 considers that the adoption of these principles by other
 countries, including the United States, Britain and France,
 would contribute to further relaxation of international ten-.
 sion and the establishment of the necessary confidence
 among the nations.
 In the Delhi declaration, the Soviet and Indian Govern-
 ments condemned the present arms drive, which is assuming
 increasingly dangerous dimensions, and unanimously called
 for its termination and for relieving the nations of the heavy
 burden of military expenditure. Fully cognizant of the danger
 of a situation in which atomic and hydrogen weapons are
 being systematically  and continuously accumulated, the
 two Governments pronounced in favour of unconditional
 prohibition of these weapons, of freeing mankind from the
 fear of atomic war and the incalculable destruction of
 property and life it would involve.
 The Soviet Union has always advocated the termination
 of the arms drive and the conclusion of an international
 agreement prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, and
 other weapons of mass destruction, including guided mis-
 siles, which have been greatly developed in recent years and,
 one might say, have become inter-continental weapons.
 In May 1955, the Soviet Union submitted a proposal on re-
 duction of conventional armaments and prohibition of atomic
 weapons. Implementation of this proposal would be a sub-
 stantial contribution to the cause of peace. We are glad
 that in this noble cause the Indian Government takes a
 staiid which is similar to ours.

 Our talks in India resulted in full agreement to the effect
 that the policy pursued by certain countries of forming mili-
 tary blocs directed against other countries heightens inter-
 national tension and increases the danger of a new war,
 and that this policy is incompatible with the promotion of
 co-operation among all countries, irrespective of their
 political and social systems.
 The peoples of Asia and Africa cannot but be alarmed
 by the creation of such  aggressive military alliances as
 SEATO and the recently formed Baghdad bloc.
 The United States, Britain and France sponsored SEATO.
 As to the Baghdad military alliance, we know that Britain
 had the chief hand in its formation. The Baghdad pact is
 a manifestation of colonialism in a new form. It is essentially
 an aggressive pact, as can be seen from the character of the
 obligations assumed by the participants in this military
 alliance. This became particularly obvious when Iran was
 drawn into this alliance.
 The Soviet Government has repeatedly called the atten-
 tion of the Iranian Government to the fact that the partici-
 pation of Iran in military alliances, into which the Western
 Powers have long been trying to draw her, is incompatible
 with the maintenance of good-neighbourly relations between
 Iran and the Soviet Union. We pointed out at the same time
 that we want to have good relations with Iran, as with other
 neighbouring countries. Unfortunately, those who are re-
 sponsible for Iran's policy have taken a different course;
 they have joined the Baghdad pact, thereby assuming grave
 responsibility for the resultant situation.
 We reject, as untenable, the assertion of the Iranian Gov-
 ernment that Iran's adhesion to this pact strengthens
 peace in the Middle East. There is as little truth in this
 assertion as there is in the assertion that the Atlantic
 bloc strengthens peace in Europe.

 We heard with satisfaction the statement made from this
 rostrum by the head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation,
 Mr. Sayed, to the effect that the Government and the people
 of Iran sincerely desire to further friendly and good-neigh-
 bourly relations with the Soviet Union. But we are forced to
 reckon with the fact that the formation of the Baghdad bloc,
 and the integration into it of neighbours of the Soviet Union,
 cannot but affect the security of our country. The Soviet Union
 is, accordingly, obliged to draw the necessary conclusions.
 The Joint Declaration signed during our stay in India
 condemns the policy of forming military alliances and region-
 al military blocs, and stresses that peace and genuine se-
 curity for the peoples can be assured only by the collective
 efforts of the states.
 The Soviet Government and the Government of India
 expressed the conviction that permanent peace in Asia is
 impossible without granting the People's Republic of China
 its rightful place in the United Nations. The two Govern-
 ments emphasized the necessity for a speedy settlement of
 other Far Eastern problems, including the problem of Taiwan
 and the Chinese coastal islands, which must be settled on the
 basis of satisfying the lawful rights of the People's Republic
 of China. Our Joint Declaration expresses the hopethat these
 problems will be settled without delay through agreement.
 The Governments of the two countries emphasized the
 necessity of settling the Korean question on the basis of
 recognizing the national rights of the Korean people and in
 accordance with the interests of peace in the Far East, and
 also the necessity of implementing the Geneva agreements
 on Indo-China. We know that attempts are now being made
 to obstruct implementation of these agreements, although
 their violation, as the Soviet-Indian Declaration of Decem-
 ber 13 rightly points out, would have "exceedingly grave
 consequences for both Indo-China and the whole world."

 The similarity of the views of the Soviet Union and India
 on the outstanding problems of Asia and the Far East is
 undoubtedly an important factor, capable of contributing
 to the settlement of these problems on the basis of recog-
 nizing the lawful rights of the peoples and in accordance
 with the interests of peace.
 Pursuing a policy of 'peace, the Soviet Union and India
 are successfully co-operating on a number of important
 problems which the United Nations is now working to
 solve. This is reflected not only in the identity of the
 views of the two countries on such problems as disar"mament,
 but also on the question of U.N. membership. We note with
 satisfaction that the Indian'Government supported the Soviet
 proposal for the admission to the United Nations of sixteen
 countries: Albania, Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Hungary,
 Italy, Austria, Rumania, Bulgaria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal,
 Libya, Cambodia, Laos and Spain. We 'share the hope ex-
 pressed by Mr. Nehru that those countries still outside the
 United Nations will soon be admitted to membership.
 The Soviet-Indian Declaration records that the Soviet
 Union and India concur in their evaluation of the results
 of the Geneva Conference of the Four Heads of Government,
 and ? of the recent conference of the four Foreign Ministers.
 There was full understanding between Mr. Nehru and our-
 selves that the effort to lessen international tension must
 be continued, and that the best method of settling contro-
 versial issues is by negotiation.
 Comrade Deputies, the identity of the views of the Soviet
 Union and India on vital international problems is not due
 to transitory causes or considerations of the moment. It
 springs from the fundamental interests 'of the peoples of the
 two countries, who want peace and security.
 The Soviet people, led by the Communist Party of the So-
 viet Union, are engaged in the peaceful constructive work
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9

 I
 of building a communist society, implementing the great
 plans of economic and cultural development and raising
 the well-being of the Soviet people. We have never threat-
 ened anyone, nor do we threaten anyone now, and the peace-
 loving nations will always find in the Soviet Union a staunch
 champion of peace and international co-operation. (Pro-
 longed applause.)
 India's policy of peace likewise rests on profound foun-
 dations deriving from the nature of the development of
 the Indian state. We have seen the great effort the Indian
 people are making to develop their economy. Our talks with
 Mr. Nehru and other Indian statesmen brought home to us
 the immensity of the tasks confronting India in raising the
 standard of living of her people. The Indians are vitally
 interested in peace, in being able to work in peace and create
 material values for the good- of their country.
 Identity of the interests of the Soviet Union and India in
 working for peace is a firm foundation for maintaining and
 further developing the friendly relations between the two
 countries.
 A factor of great significance for the further strength-
 ening of our relations with India is economic intercourse
 between the two countries and the potentialities which exist
 in this sphere. We therefore exchanged views with the Indian
 Government concerning ways and means of broadening
 economic intercourse, of enlarging the volume of trade
 between India and the Soviet Union.
 It was agreed that in the three years beginning with
 1956 the Soviet Union will supply to India one million tons
 of rolled ferrous metals-300,000 tons in the first year and
 350,000 tons in each of the two following years. We shall
 also supply to India various kinds of industrial equipment
 and other goods. It has been agreed that the Soviet Union
 will increase its purchases of Indian goods. The two

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 parties considered it essential to arrange regular shipping
 services between Soviet and Indian ports and to establish
 air communication between the two countries.
 The Soviet Government considers that international co-
 operation implies, among other things, pooling of experience
 between countries, including countries with different social
 systems. In the course of our meetings in India, we stated
 that the Soviet Union was prepared to share its experience
 with India and, in the first place, experience in economic
 development. We observed, at the same time, that we did
 not want to force our experience on anybody, but that if
 our friends, the Indian people, desired to avail themselves
 of our experience in any degree, we were prepared to share
 it with them. We should also like to avail ourselves, and
 should avail ourselves, of the experience of India, which
 has a centuries-old culture.
 The strengthening of political and economic relations
 between the Soviet Union and India can, and should, be
 supplemented by the development of cultural intercourse
 between the two countries, for which there is a mutual desire.
 We had the opportunity while in India to convince our-
 selves of the tremendous creative ability of the Indian people,
 who have produced world-famed memorials of material
 and spiritual culture, inimitable specimens of national
 architecture, and a distinctive and remarkable school of
 scenic art, dancing and music, which preserves and carries
 forward the traditions of folk art.
 On the other hand, a strong desire for close cultural con-
 tact with the Soviet Union is to be observed in India. We
 welcome this desire, being convinced that such contact will
 be useful to both peoples.
 We had many meetings and conversations in India with
 statesmen and public figures, with managers of industrial
 enterprises and farms, with workers in science, culture and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A03380070000
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 art, and with members of the most diverse professions.
 They all displayed keen interest in the Soviet Union, in
 the life and work of the Soviet people. We invited many of
 them to visit our country to get to know the Soviet people
 more closely, to see with their own eyes how they live and
 work. This will undoubtedly help to strengthen the bonds of
 friendship, and promote closer contact between our peoples.
 The reactionary press and some government  leaders
 abroad were greatly annoyed by our frank statements on the
 Goa and Kashmir questions.
 As you know, there is still a small Portuguese colony on
 an integral part of Indian territory-Goa. The Indians are
 rightly demanding that this intolerable state of affairs should
 be ended and Goa liberated. We have only to glance at the
 map of India and at these "possessions" of the Portuguese
 intruders to see how justified and lawful is the claim of the
 Indian Government that this Indian territory should be
 reunited with the motherland. The Soviet Government
 supports this just demand and considers that maintaining
 a Portuguese colony on Indian territory-as maintaining the
 colonial system in our day generally-is a disgrace to
 civilized nations. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 As regards the Kashmir problem, it has been generated
 by countries pursuing definite military and political aims
 in this area. On the pretext of supporting Pakistan on the
 Kashmir question certain countries are trying to entrench
 themselves in this part of India in order to threaten and exert
 pressure on areas in the vicinity of Kashmir. The attempt
 was made to sever Kashmir from India artificially and
 convert it into a foreign military base.
 The people of Kashmir are emphatically opposed to this
 imperialist policy. The issue has been settled by the Kashmi-
 ris themselves; they regard themselves as an integral part
 of the Republic of India and want to live in the fraternal

 family of Indian peoples, to take part in building the new
 and independent India, and work for international peace and
 security. (Prolonged applause.) We became profoundly con-
 vinced of this during our meetings with the people in Srina-
 gar, and in our conversations with the Prime Minister of
 Kashmir, Mr. G. M. Bakshi, and his colleagues.
 The Soviet Government supports India's policy in rela-
 tion to the Kashmir issue (applause), because it fully accords
 with the interests of peace in this part of Asia. We declared
 this when we were in Kashmir, we reaffirmed our declaration
 at a press conference in Delhi on December 14, and we de-
 clare it today. (Applause.)
 Our visit to India has brought our two countries still
 closer. The bonds of friendship between the Soviet Union
 and India have been greatly strengthened. We knew before,
 and during our stay in India our conviction was confirmed,
 that the Indian people entertain sincere brotherly feelings
 for the peoples of the Soviet Union. A new and powerful
 stimulus has been. given to the all-round development of
 political and economic co-operation between the two coun-
 tries. Better opportunities for cultural and scientific inter-
 course have been created.
 We, Soviet people, wish our great friend, the people
 of India,, every success in furthering the economic progress
 of their country, in developing industry and agriculture,
 in raising their standard of living and cultural level, in
 consolidating the Republic of India as an independent and
 sovereign state. (Prolonged applause.)
 Friendship and co-operation between the Soviet Union
 and India constitute a most important factor in safeguarding
 international peace and security. This great friendship we
 shall continue to develop and strengthen. (Applause.)
 I shall now speak about our visit to Burma.
 Burma embarked on the path of independent national
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 development as the result of the devoted struggle waged
 by all her people against the long years of British colonial
 rule, and then, in the Second World War, against the invasion
 of the Japanese militarists, who ruthlessly plundered the
 Burmese and their national wealth.
 In their struggle for independence the Burmese displayed
 determination and heroism. The leader of their struggle, the
 popular hero, Aung San, and many of his comrades met their
 death at the hands of the enemies of national liberation.
 But the people attained their aim: the chains of colonial
 slavery were broken, and an independent state-the Union
 of Burma--established. In the face of enormous difficulties,
 arising from the aftermath of colonial oppression and the
 devastation of war, the Burmese set about rehabilitating
 and upbuilding their economy.
 The visit of the Burmese Prime Minister, U Nu, to the
 Soviet Union in October and November 1955 laid the foun-
 dation for close and friendly contact between the Union of
 Burma and the Soviet Union.
 A Joint Soviet-Burmese Declaration was signed in Moscow
 on November 3, its keynote being the desire to promote
 international confidence and co-operation. The declaration
 emphasized that the sincere and friendly relations between
 the two countries were based on the Five Principles of
 peaceful co-existence already recognized by many states and
 nations, and which are aimed at strengthening peace among
 the nations.
 Our stay in Burma from December 1 to 7, our meetings
 with the people of this hospitable country, and our personal
 contacts with her leaders once more confirmed that Burma
 is an active champion of friendly relations between states,
 condemns the formation of military blocs, and advocates
 collective effort by the states for the consolidation of peace.
 We arrived in Rangoon, capital of Burma, on December 1.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 There we were given a friendly and very cordial reception
 by the population and by Burmese government leaders,
 headed by Prime Minister U Nu. Our meetings with the
 people were equally cordial and hearty in all the other cities
 we visited during our six-day stay in Burma. Besides Ran-
 goon, we visited the Shan State, part of the Union of Burma,
 and its capital, Taunggyi, and also the second largest Burmese
 city, Mandalay. Everywhere the Soviet people, the Soviet
 Union, and Burmese-Soviet friendship were warmly and sin-
 cerely hailed by the people of Burma. (Prolonged applause.)
 We were happily impressed, in particular, by our meeting
 with the students and teaching staff of the University of
 Rangoon, where several thousand young men and women
 are studying.  The  younger generation of this nation,
 now that it has thrown off the yoke of colonial servitude,
 is making the first steps in the acquisition of the scientific
 knowledge required for independent advancement along
 the road chosen by the people, for the development of the
 national economy and culture.
 The students listened with rapt attention to the speech
 of Comrade Khrushchov who gave a detailed account of
 the Soviet Union, of our way of life, and of our educational
 system. Great interest was evoked by the passages in the
 speech denouncing the colonialist policy of the imperialist
 states,-and declaring that the Soviet Union did not support,
 indeed emphatically opposed, this policy. This statement,
 like many other passages, was greeted by the students and
 professors with stormy applause.
 During our stay in Burma we had useful meetings and
 talks with the President of the Union of Burma, Dr. BP U,
 to whom we transmitted a personal message from the Presi-
 dent of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, Com-
 rade Voroshilov. Dr. Ba U expressed his deep gratitude for
 the message.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 On behalf of our Government, we invited the Burmese
 Minister of Defence, U Ba Swe, and the Minister of Industry,
 U Kyaw Nyein, to visit the Soviet Union. Both Ministers
 accepted the invitation.
 Special mention should be made of our meetings and con-
 versations with U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma,
 which were marked by cordiality and friendship. These
 meetings resulted in the Soviet-Burmese Declaration signed
 in Rangoon on December 6.
 The Declaration notes the identity of the views of the
 two countries on the major international problems requiring
 settlement: disarmament, including prohibition of atomic
 and hydrogen weapons, the Far East, including the necessity
 of satisfying the lawful rights of the Chinese People's Repub-
 lic in relation to Taiwan and the coastal islands, and the
 question of granting the C.P.R. its rightful place in the
 United Nations.
 The two Governments reaffirmed their unanimous opinion
 that the policy of forming blocs is to be condemned, and
 that only a policy of non-participation in such blocs can
 establish confidence and good will among states. "Interna-
 tional peace," the Soviet-Burmese Declaration says, "can
 be strengthened and the peoples' confidence in the future
 can be assured, not through the creation of blocs, but only
 through joint and collective efforts of all peoples."
 The views of the two Governments were also found to
 concur on the results of the Geneva Conference of the Four
 Heads of Government, and of the recent Conference of the
 Four Foreign Ministers. The Soviet-Burmese Declaration of
 December 6 states that the two countries consider that
 further efforts should be made to solve outstanding inter-
 national problems.
 Our relations with Burma rest on a firm foundation,
 since both parties are vitally interested in maintaining
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 and furthering co-operation on the basis of the Five Princi-
 ples of peaceful co-existence.
 Our economic relations with the Union of Burma are
 based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and
 preclude imposing political or any other shackling condi-
 tions by either party. In full conformity with these principles,
 which are shared by the Burmese Government, we discussed
 during our stay in Rangoon measures for furthering Soviet-
 Burmese co-operation in the economic, cultural, scientific
 and technical spheres, and, in particular, for enlarging the
 volume of trade between Burma and the U.S.S.R.
 It was agreed that the Soviet Union would co-operate in
 the drawing up of a programme of agricultural development,
 construction of major irrigation works, and the building
 of several industrial enterprises in Burma. Burma, in re-
 turn, will sell the Soviet Union rice, and in the event of the
 quantities purchased being insufficient to compensate for
 the value of our deliveries, Burma will enjoy the right to
 credit, that is, to defer the payments in kind over a number
 of years by mutual agreement.
 In token of good will and respect for the people of the
 Union of Burma, we offered on behalf of the Soviet Govern-
 ment, and on its instructions, to build and equip, with So-
 viet means and resources, a technological institute in Ran-
 goon as a gift to the Burmese people. (Prolonged applause.)
 The Government of the Union of Burma highly appreci-
 ated the motives which prompted the Soviet Government to
 make this offer, and accepted the gift with deep gratitude
 to the Soviet Government and the Soviet people. (Ap-
 plause.)
 On behalf of the Burmese people, Prime Minister U Nu
 offered, in turn,  an appropriate quantity of rice and
 other  commodities of  Burmese produQtion as  a gift
 to the Soviet Union. On behalf of the people of the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Soviet  Union, we accepted  this gift with  gratitude.
 (Applause.)
 A strong desire for cultural intercourse with the Soviet
 Union is manifested by the Burmese leaders and Burmese
 intellectuals. We declared that the Soviet Union was ready
 to develop cultural intercourse with Burma, since this could
 but benefit the two countries and help to strengthen their
 friendly relations.
 The Government of Burma expressed satisfaction with
 the good will displayed by the Soviet Government in the
 Rangoon talks. We, on our part, wish the Union of Burma
 that it may speedily cope with the aftermath of colonial
 oppression and war devastation, consolidate and unite the
 Burmese people, and achieve further success in building
 an economy independent of foreign states and free of the
 difficulties it is still experiencing owing to the efforts of
 certain foreign powers to place Burma at a disadvantage in
 the world market.
 The peoples of the Soviet Union and Burma are unani-
 mous in the desire to preserve and consolidate peace, to
 safeguard the security of nations, and to promote inter-
 national co-operation and friendship. The visit of Comrade
 Khrushchov and myself to Burma as the guests of her Govern-
 ment, and our meetings with the Burmese people, have
 brought the Soviet Union and Burma still closer. The friend-
 ship and co-operation between the two countries is becoming
 a factor of increasing importance in the effort to relax
 international tension.
 We shall do everything in our power to strengthen and
 broaden the friendship and co-operation between the two
 countries for the well-being and happiness of their peoples.
 (Prolonged applause.)
 I shall now turn to our visit to Afghanistan.
 It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and re-

 suits of our stay in Afghanistan as the guests of His Majesty's
 Government. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have a
 common border of 2,346 kilometres , and the two countries
 are bound by close and friendly relations of long standing.
 The Afghan people won their national independence in
 bitter struggle against the British imperialists, who sought
 to convert Afghanistan into their colony. The courageous
 Afghans were thrice victorious in this struggle, and in 1919
 they firmly established their independence and statehood.
 A big role in establishing Afghanistan's independence was
 played by the defeat suffered by the intervention troops
 in Central Asia at the hands of Soviet Russia.
 Afghanistan has invariably enjoyed the support of the
 Soviet Union. We were the first power to recognize Afghan-
 istan as a sovereign state, in 1919. Afghanistan, on the
 other hand, was one of the first foreign countries to recognize
 the Soviet state established by the Great October Socialist
 Revolution. These facts suffice to show how deeply rooted
 are the good relations between the two countries. Experience
 has shown that these good-neighbourly relations are in the
 best interests of the peoples of the two countries.
 Our meetings in Kabul with His Majesty King Mohammed
 Zahir Shah, Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud and other
 leading Afghan statesmen revealed their desire to maintain
 and develop the good-neighbourly relations between the
 two countries.
 This desire of His Majesty's Government of Afghanistan
 is only to be welcomed, as we said in Kabul. On its part,
 the' Soviet Government has done, and intends in the future
 to do, everything necessary to strengthen and develop our
 relations with this neighbouring country. (Applause.)
 The exchange of views with leading Afghan statesmen
 revealed the desire of both Governments to contribute to
 a further lessening of international tension and extension

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of international co-operation. We noted with satisfaction
 that the views of the two Governments concur on a number
 of international problems, including  disarmament and
 Asian and Far Eastern problems, and this was reflected in
 the Joint Soviet-Afghan Declaration signed in Kabul on
 December 18.
 In our statements in Kabul we set forth our attitude to the
 Pushtunistan issue, which is deeply agitating the Afghans.
 Pushtunistan is inhabited by Afghan "independent tribes."
 The region was annexed to the British Empire in 1893, and
 in 1947, against the interests of the tribes inhabiting Pushtu-
 nistan, it was incorporated into Pakistan.
 We regard as justified and well-founded the demand of
 Afghanistan that the inhabitants of the bordering region of
 Pushtunistan should be given the opportunity for a free
 expression of their will. The people of this area have as much
 right to national self-determination as any other people.
 No justification can be found for those who refuse to reckon,
 and do not reckon, with the lawful national interests of the
 people of Pushtunistan.
 Our relations with Afghanistan are based on a series of
 treaties concluded after Afghanistan became an independent
 state. One of the most important is the Treaty of Neutrality
 and Mutual Non-Aggression of June 24, 1931.
 During our stay in Kabul, agreement was reached with
 His Majesty's Government of Afghanistan that this treaty
 should be prolonged for ten years, that is, until 1966. We
 also agreed that on the expiry of this period the treaty shall
 continue in force unless either of the parties proposes that
 it be terminated. A special protocol to this effect was
 signed in Kabul. This is an act of great importance, and
 testifies that both parties take their obligations seriously
 and intend to develop their relations on the basis of the trea-
 ties and agreements they have concluded.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 We consider that the policy of neutrality and good-neigh-
 bourship pursued by His Majesty's Government of Afghan-
 istan in relation to other countries helps to strengthen the
 position of the Afghan state. In contrast to Pakistan, which
 finds herself, owing to her participation in the Baghdad mili-
 tary bloc, in a difficult position internally and externally,
 Afghanistan undeniably enjoys great possibilities for inde-
 pendent economic and political development.
 We would like to see Pakistan, too, enjoy such possibilities.
 The Soviet Union would like to have no less friendly rela-
 tions with Pakistan than it has with India, Burma and Af-
 ghanistan, and it is not our fault that this is so far not the
 case. However, the Soviet Government has endeavoured,
 and will continue to do so, to improve our relations with
 Pakistan.
 During our stay in Afghanistan we had a fruitful exchange
 of views on economic relations between the two countries
 and the possibility of expanding them. Our conversations
 with leading Afghan statesmen revealed new potentialities
 for broadening economic co-operation between the two coun-
 tries and, in particular, for enlarging the volume of Soviet-
 Afghan trade.
 On the instructions of our Government, we granted to
 Afghanistan a long-term credit of 100 million U.S. dollars.
 While in Kabul we, on behalf of the Soviet Government,
 extended an invitation to Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud
 to visit the Soviet Union at his convenience. Mr. Mohammed
 Daoud accepted the invitation and expressed the wish to
 visit our country in 1956. We have no doubt that his stay
 in the Soviet Union, like the stay of Comrade Khrushchov
 and myself in Afghanistan, will strengthen the friendly
 relations between our countries. (Applause.)
 In the thirty-six years since the establishment of the in-
 dependent state of Afghanistan, our relations with her have
 7,                          293

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 been a model of genuine good-neighbourship and friendly
 co-operation. And we intend to continue our relations
 with Afghanistan in a manner that accords with the inter-
 ests of the peoples of the two countries and with the interests
 of peace.
 We want to see Afghanistan an economically strong and
 politically independent state, and are glad that our policy
 towards that country meets with the full understanding of
 His Majesty's Government of Afghanistan and of the Afghan
 people.
 Comrade Deputies, the strengthening of our friendly ties
 with India, Burma and Afghanistan is a triumph for the
 Leninist principles of the Soviet Union's peace-loving for-
 eign policy, a triumph for the principle of peaceful co-
 existence.
 As we know, the Soviet Union, India, Burma and Afghan-
 istan have different social and political systems. But this is
 not, and will not be, a hindrance to the continued strengthen-
 ing of relations between our countries-they are firmly found-
 ed on the Five Principles of which I have already spoken.
 It is on these principles that the Soviet Union, the Chinese
 People's Republic, India, Burma, Afghanistan and a number
 of other countries in Europe, Asia and Africa build their
 relations with one another and with other countries.We deeply
 respect these principles, as being in full accord with the
 principles of Soviet foreign policy, and consider that the
 greater the number of countries that adopt and guide them-
 selves by them, the more effectively will international confi-
 dence develop, and the more rapidly will tension be lessened
 and peace be strengthened.
 Our visit to Asia evoked much comment all over the world,
 and especially in Asia and Africa.
 In our addresses to rallies and assemblies in India,
 Burma and Afghanistan, we spoke of the friendship of our
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 people for the peoples of these countries, and of the peace-
 loving Leninist policy of our Government. We hailed the
 peoples who have thrown off the yoke of colonial slavery,
 and expressed our sympathy with those who are still the
 victims of colonial oppression. Comrade Khrushchov, in
 his statements, truthfully and frankly expressed our opinion
 of the actions of the imperialists and colonialists in Asia,
 Africa, and wherever they have formerly ruled or still main-
 tain their rule.
 Foreign press comments reveal the importance attached
 to our statements in the East. In particular, the press
 noted that no representative of the bourgeois world would
 venture to tell the Asian peoples the truth about the colo-
 nial powers, that it can be told only by those who champion
 the equality of all nations, by those who actively work for
 freedom for all countries and for their right to develop in
 their own way. (Prolonged applause.)
 Our frank and forthright statements were received with
 sympathy and understanding not only by those to whom they
 were directly addressed; they were carried far beyond the
 confines of India, Burma and Afghanistan and reached the
 hearing of other Asian and African peoples.
 Together with these nations, the positive results of our
 visit are bailed by the peoples of the Chinese People's Repub-
 lic and the People's Democracies. Our visit is approved by
 progressive-minded men and women all over the world, by
 all our friends. (Applause.)
 However, our visit to the Asian countries was not to the
 liking of all. Our statements in India, Burma and Afghani-
 stan, and the documents of friendship signed in Delhi,
 Rangoon and Kabul, evoked the dissatisfaction and even
 the resentment of the reactionary press and of official spokes-
 men in certain countries. Our friendship with India, Burma
 and Afghanistan is not to their liking. But it is very much to
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 our liking, and we shall work to strengthen it, and also our
 friendship and co-operation with other countries. (Prolonged
 applause.)
 Our frank statements on colonial policy were distasteful
 to certain leading figures in the West. But the colonialist
 policy itself is even more distasteful to us and to the Asian
 and African peoples. (Prolonged applause.) We have de-
 nounced it and will continue to do so because we consider the
 colonial system a disgrace to the modern world, and incom-
 patible with the peaceful and democratic principles of the
 United Nations. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 During our visit, it was alleged in the West that our tour
 of India, Burma and Afghanistan was designed to prejudice
 relations between the peoples of these countries and the
 peoples of the Western Powers. This assertion is devoid
 of all foundation. The strengthening of the Soviet Union's
 friendly relations with India, Burma and Afghanistan,
 far from being prejudicial to the relations of the peoples
 of these countries with other peoples, will help to promote
 international co-operation.  (Prolonged applause.)
 This, perhaps, is incomprehensible to those who are in
 the habit of thinking in terms of military blocs and pacts.
 But we approach the matter of improving the Soviet Union's
 relations with other countries in a different way. And a sim-
 ilar view is held by the leading statesmen of India, Burma
 and Afghanistan; they, like us, are in favour of broadening
 international co-operation on the basis of peaceful co-exist-
 ence. (Applause.)
 Comrade Deputies, the results of our visit to India, Burma
 and Afghanistan once more show the importance of personal
 contact between leading statesmen in furthering mutual un-
 derstanding between nations and lessening international ten-
 sion. We intend to make full use of such contacts in the future.
 I should like to take this opportunity to express the cordial

 thanks of. the Soviet. Government and our people to the peo-
 ples of India, Burma and Afghanistan for the warm and hearty
 reception they accorded us. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 We send warm greetings to the peoples of these three
 countries-sincere friends of the Soviet Union-and wish
 them success in consolidating their national independence
 and in their peaceful constructive labours. (Stormy and
 prolonged applause.)
 We whole-heartedly thank the Prime Minister of India,
 Mr. Nehru, who did so much to make our stay in India useful
 to both countries. (Prolonged applause.)
 We tender our cordial thanks to the Prime Minister of
 Burma, U Nu, with whom' we have established warm and
 friendly relations. (Prolonged applause.)
 We heartily thank the Prime Minister of Afghanistan,
 Mr. M. Daoud, who is actively upholding Afghan independ-
 ence and neutrality. (Prolonged applause.)
 We deem it our duty to express our acknowledgements to
 the President of the Republic of India, Mr. Prasad, to the
 President of the Union of Burma, Dr. Ba U, and to the King
 of Afghanistan, His Majesty Mohammed Zahir Shah. (Pro-
 longed applause.)
 We thank all the government and public leaders of these
 countries who contributed to the success of our visit and gave
 us every possible help. (Prolonged applause.)
 In conclusion, I deem it necessary to declare that the
 Soviet Government will unswervingly and firmly carry out
 all the agreements concluded with India, Burma and Afghan-
 istan during our visit.
 We shall spare no effort to develop and strengthen friend-
 ship and co-operation between the Soviet Union, India,
 Burma and Afghanistan, for the good of our peoples and for
 the good of world peace. (Stormy and prolonged applause
 and cheers. All rise.)

 SPEECH BY N. S. KHRUSHCHOV
 DELIVERED AT FOURTH SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET
 OF THE U.S.S.R.
 December 29, 1955
 Comrade Deputies,
 We have listened to Comrade Nikolai Alexandrovich
 Bulganin's report on the results of our visit to the three
 friendly countries of India, Burma and Afghanistan. The
 report expressed the essential of what had to be reported
 to the Supreme Soviet on the results of our visit and the
 talks which we had on the instructions of the Soviet Govern-
 ment in those countries and on the agreements reached
 between the Government of the Soviet Union and the Govern-
 ments of India, Burma and Afghanistan.
 I entirely agree with all that Comrade Bulganin said
 in his report. I would also like to comment on certain
 questions.
 The  Soviet Government accepted with great pleasure
 the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru of India and sent
 us to India on a friendly return visit in order to establish
 personal contact with the leaders and the people of India.
 There is much in common that unites our two countries
 and the chief thing is the fight for the strengthening of
 international peace.
 I do not think it is necessary to speak about the
 importance of the Republic of India. The great Indian
 people are determined to strengthen the national  and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 political independence that their country has won. India
 as a peace-loving state plays an ever-increasing role in the
 settlement of the most important international questions.
 She is an active fighter for the preservation and strength-
 ening of peace in the whole world.
 Having freed themselves from the colonial regime the
 peoples of India are persistently seeking ways to develop
 their country. The Government of the Republic of India
 led by such a prominent statesman and politician as the
 esteemed Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nebru is pursuing a
 consistent policy of independence. And this is worthy of
 profound respect.
 Close exchange and businesslike co-operation of our
 countries is useful and profitable to both countries.
 We were guided by the same ideas when we accepted the
 invitation of the Governments of Burma and Afghanistan
 to visit those countries.
 We knew that our visit to India, Burma and Afghanistan
 would provoke dissatisfaction on the part of the colonialists,
 who are afraid that the strengthening of the Soviet Union's
 friendship with countries which were but a short time
 ago oppressed by them will further weaken the positions
 of the colonial powers.
 But Messrs. the Colonialists have only got themselves to
 blame.
 It is generally known that the principles of co-operation
 and friendship of the Soviet Union with other states differ
 radically from the principles on which the policy of colo-
 nialists is based. The Soviet Union, setting the example of
 deep understanding of and respect for the interests of all
 peoples and countries, both great and small, proceeds from
 the thesis that there are no unequal or inferior nations.
 Strengthening its friendship with other states the Soviet
 Union does not impose its will on them or dictate any pre-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 liminary conditions as the imperialist states do. It does not
 seek thereby any special advantages for itself, but proceeds
 from the principle that it has to do with equal partners
 whose interests must be respected.
 Every people has the right to build its life as it wishes.
 The enslavement or plundering of one country by another
 is a crying injustice and disgrace.
 The equality of nations, non-interference in the internal
 affairs of other states, non-aggression and peaceful co-exist-
 ence of countries irrespective of their political systems,
 these are the principles on which our relations with other
 countries have always been based. Our strict observance of
 these principles and our co-operation with the states of
 Asia, which is becoming closer and closer, are forcing the
 colonialists to revise their tactics in regard to those countries
 where they are striving to hold their positions, and easing the
 situation in those countries.
 This is a factor of no mean importance.
 We also bore in mind that our visit to India, Burma and
 Afghanistan would promote close contacts between both
 the peoples and the leaders of our countries. The peoples
 of India, Burma and Afghanistan received the opportunity
 of knowing more about the Soviet Union and about the life
 of the peoples of the Soviet country. This will further
 strengthen our friendship.
 Finally, we were firmly convinced that our visit to
 India, Burma and Afghanistan would further strengthen
 the position of world peace and would weaken the camp of
 the supporters of war. That circumstance alone made our
 visit extremely necessary, for the cause of peace is a
 great cause which reflects the greatest wish of the whole
 of humanity.
 We may now say that the great hopes which were laid
 on that visit have been fully justified. (Prolonged applause.)

 Comrade Deputies,
 I shall not claim your attention for an account of our
 impressions - of our journey through India, Burma and
 Afghanistan, for that would take too long. I shall say one
 thing-that our impressions are exceptionally strong and
 stirring. They are unforgettable. And the strongest of all
 our impressions is that of our meetings. with the people.
 We expected a cordial welcome in India from her leaders
 as well as from her. people. But our feelings in the first
 minutes of our stay there exceeded all that we had ex-
 pected.
 In Delhi, the capital of the Republic of India, and in
 all the other states and towns of India we were welcomed
 by hundreds of thousands, millions of people. We were
 welcomed with exceptional cordiality in which we saw an
 expression of the deep love of the peoples of India for the
 peoples of the Soviet Union.
 Wherever we appeared we were surrounded by friends
 acclaiming the eternal and indestructible friendship of
 India and the Soviet Union. As a beloved brother is welcomed
 in a loving family, so we were welcomed in the great family
 of the peoples of India, warmly and cordially as represent-
 atives of the great Soviet people. (Prolonged applause.)
 The same friendly welcome was extended to us by the
 peoples of Burma, Prime Minister U Nu, and other lead-
 ers of the Union of Burma. Just as warm was our welcome
 in Afghanistan by the people and also by Prime Minis-
 ter Mohammed Daoud and the other leaders. of Afghanistan.
 We certainly did not think that the enthusiasm and
 cordial friendship expressed by the peoples  of India,
 Burma and Afghanistan towards us applied to us personally.
 We saw in them an expression of the boundless love and
 respect of the peoples of those friendly countries for the
 peoples of the Soviet Union.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 We saw in them a sincere acknowledgement by the peo-
 ples of India, Burma and Afghanistan of the historical serv-
 ices of the peoples of the Soviet Union in the fight for world
 peace and a bright future for all humanity. (Stormy applause.)
 While in India, Burma and Afghanistan we had an ex-
 tensive exchange of opinions with the Governments of those
 countries on many of the most important questions of in-
 ternational politics. Everywhere we met general mutual
 understanding on all questions discussed. The chief things
 which we discussed were peaceful co-existence of coun-
 tries with different social systems and questions concerning
 the further development of the economic and cultural links
 between our countries.
 The course of the talks showed unanimity of views and
 we quickly found mutually acceptable solutions for all
 questions and the necessary formulas for joint declarations
 and agreements.
 That was the case in India as it was also in Burma and
 in Afghanistan. It is very pleasant to note this.
 Does not this prove that with good will and honourable
 intentions of the leaders of countries it is possible and indis-
 pensable to solve by peaceful means all questions of mu-
 tual relations between countries in spite of differences in
 social systems?
 There are some general questions the solution of which
 is absolutely indisputable and mutually acceptable, and in
 which all peoples are equally interested irrespective of
 whether they live in socialist or capitalist countries. In
 the solution of such questions our co-operation can be
 crowned with success.
 The most obvious and convincing example of this is per-
 haps the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and
 India. The social and state systems in the Soviet Union and
 in India differ one from the other. We and the leaders of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 India have different points of view on a number of ques-
 tions. Neither we nor our friends, the leaders of the Indian
 state, try to hide this.
 However, this does not hinder us and our Indian friends
 from keeping to the Five Principles of peaceful co-existence
 on which we base our relations with other countries, or from
 maintaining and developing friendly relations between the
 Soviet Union and India. The cordial and friendly relations
 between our countries are progressing and developing.
 It is in the same direction that our relations with the
 Union of Burma and Afghanistan are developing. Afghan-
 istan{'has long been our friend and good neighbour.        I
 As a result of our visit to India, Burma and `Afghani-
 stan mutually profitable economic agreements have been
 concluded between the Soviet Union and those countries,
 which will serve the interests of the Soviet Union, India,
 Burma and Afghanistan.
 In states like the Republic of India, the Union of Burma
 and Afghanistan we see equal partners in the fight for uni-
 versal peace. Between us and the leaders of the countries,
 which we visited there is no difference of opinion on ques-
 tions of the fight for peace. And these questions are the main
 ones. Their solution deeply concerns all humanity.
 Our visit to India, Burma and Afghanistan and the
 results of the Soviet-Indian, Soviet-Burmese and Soviet-
 Afghan talks have produced a favourable impression on all
 friends of peace.
 In some countries, however,  our  visit  called forth
 unfriendliness on the part of certain individuals, including
 official personalities, and even outspoken hostility and
 attacks on us.
 This was to be observed mainly in Britain and the United
 States of America. Some echoes or rather undertones were
 to be heard in other countries too. For example, in Canada,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 where the Foreign Minister, Mr. Pearson, made a short-
 sighted declaration.
 What was the reason for this?
 They censured us, lectured us and reacted in various
 other ways towards us because from their point of view
 we were wrong in attacking colonialists, because we sharply
 criticized that form of oppression and plundering of the peoples
 of colonial and dependent countries by the imperialists.
 Well, what was new in what we said about the colonialists
 and colonial regimes? Why did our utterances call forth
 such a furious reaction among the colonialists and their ad-
 vocates? The facts we quoted are known to all and are indis-
 putable.
 Take the fact, for example, that the British colonialists,
 not the people but the colonialists, lorded it over India for
 nearly two centuries and that for a long time they oppressed
 the peoples of Burma and Afghanistan.
 What did that lead to?
 I allow myself a reference to an authoritative expert
 in this question, the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal
 Nehru, who enjoys universal respect.
 In his book The Discovery of India he points out that "the
 most obvious fact is the sterility of British rule in India
 and the thwarting of Indian life by it. Alien rule is inevitably
 cut off from the creative energies of the people it dominates.
 When this alien rule has its own economic and cultural
 centre far from the subject country and is further backed by
 racialism, this divorce is complete, and leads to spiritual
 and cultural starvation of the subject peoples."
 Describing the effects of British rule in India, Mr. Nehru
 recalls the terrible famine which spread over the country
 during the Second World War. He writes:
 "This famine unveiled the picture of India as it was below
 the thin veneer of the prosperity of a small number of people
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 at the top-a picture of poverty and ugliness and human decay
 after all these generations of British rule. That was the
 culmination and fulfilment of British rule in India. It was
 no calamity of nature or play of the elements that brought
 this famine, nor was it caused by actual war operations and
 enemy blockade. Every competent observer is agreed that
 it was a man-made famine which could have been foreseen
 and avoided."
 To this we can add that according to figures given by the
 Indian economist B. Singh, author of the book Population and
 Food Planning in India, in the last quarter of the nineteenth
 century alone India suffered famine eighteen times; at that
 time 26 million persons died of hunger. In the twentieth
 century the scale of famine grew. In 1943 alone about three
 and a half million persons died of hunger in India.
 These are facts. Facts which do not speak in favour of
 the colonialists.
 The fate of the Burmese people, who was also under the
 domination of the 'British colonialists, was just as tragic.
 As early as 1824, Britain started an armed conflict to seize
 Burma, which ended in 1885 by the complete occupation of
 the country. Burma was ruled by a governor-general with
 unlimited powers, appointed by Britain.
 During the Second World War Burma was occupied by
 the Japanese. After Japan capitulated in 1945 the British
 colonialists returned to Burma and tried to restore their mas-
 tery. However, the patriotic forces of Burma, which had
 grown in the fight against Japanese occupation, offered
 determined resistance. In January 1948 the British impe-
 rialists were forced to grant Burma independence.
 The peoples of India, as also of Burma and Afghanistan,
 did not invite the colonialists to plunder their countries.
 The colonialists asserted their mastery in those countries as
 the outcome of wars of conquest and plunder. The territo-
 215

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 rtes of India and Burma were not barren lands when the
 colonialists invaded them; they were inhabited by peoples
 who had a high culture of their own. It is known for example
 that the culture of the peoples of India was not inferior in
 level to the cultures of European countries, including
 Britain. But India was weak from the military point of view,
 she was not so well armed. That was the only reason why
 she fell a prey to the colonialists.
 Some apologists of the colonial regime now say:
 "Did we not volunteer to give India her freedom?"
 That is, to put it mildly, a rather conventional way of
 expressing how and why the colonialists left India and
 agreed  to the existence of an independent Republic of
 India.
 They were forced to agree because it was their only way
 out. Had they tried to remain in India they would have sus-
 tained enormous losses and would have been driven out in
 the end by the Indian people just as the colonialists of all
 colours and shades and Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt band
 with them were driven out of China by the Chinese people.
 (Stormy applause.)
 The colonialists sometimes like to say that they have a great
 historical role, that of spreading civilization. Such legends
 are intended for simpletons and overcredulous people who do
 not know history.
 Perhaps the British colonialists did raise the culture
 of the popular masses in the countries they conquered,
 helped those countries to create their industry, to develop
 science and to raise the welre of the people?
 No, they were plunderers in the fullest sense of the word.
 They plundered those countries and greatly delayed their
 development. I remember how on a visit to a milk farm in
 Bombay the Chief Minister of the State of Bombay,
 Mr. Desai, said bitterly:

 "Everything vas reduced to nothing  in the years of
 British rule. During those 200 years we nearly returned to
 barbarism."
 The peoples of India, Burma and other countries where
 the colonialists ruled will need great efforts to liquidate the
 dire consequences of the mastery of the colonialists.
 Is it not a fact that until recently more than 80 per cent of
 the population of India and 63 per cent of the population of
 Burma were illiterate?
 It is also a fact that the standard of living of the popula-
 tion of India, the exploitation of which was a gold mine for
 British capitalists, is considerably lower than the living
 standard of the population of Britain. The same can be said
 of Burma and the other countries where the colonialists ruled
 for a long time.
 "But," the defenders of the colonial system will say,
 "these countries were members of the British Empire and
 were on an almost equal footing with Britain."
 Where is the equality they talk about?
 We did not see any trace of it. We saw that as long as the
 mastery of the British colonialists lasted they built for them-
 selves wonderful palaces in India and in Burma.
 They created conditions for a handful of feudal lords,
 who went over to their side, and supported them. But the ,
 millions of the Indian people were deprived of all rights
 and most cruelly exploited.
 The Indians could naturally not put up with such a sit-
 uation. The Indian people and all its fighters against the
 power of the colonialists in India, under the leadership of
 prominent men like Gandhi, Nehru and other leaders, played
 a great role in the conquest of India's political independence.
 We naturally sympathized with them in their fight, re-
 joiced in their successes, and give them their due for the
 courage they showed. (Prolonged applause.)

 We are now told that by opposing the colonialists and un-
 masking their plunderous policy we showed a certain un-
 friendliness towards Britain and other countries, although
 we did not name any other countries and did not name
 Britain very often either. (Animation.) But we do not want
 to play hide and seek. We know just as the whole world
 does who were the colonialists in India, Burma and Afgha-
 nistan.
 Indeed, when we spoke of the ignoble role of the colo-
 nialists we meant the British colonialists also. But the colo-
 nialists are not Britain and her people. The British colo-
 nialists will never have the right to identify themselves
 with the people of Britain.
 There was nothing in our speeches that was at all insult-
 ing for Britain or the British people. We have a deep
 respect  for  the  talented  and  hard-working British
 people and we desire friendship with them. (Prolonged
 applause.)
 We said nothing insulting or offensive for the British
 Government either. We condemned and still do condemn the
 colonial system, considering that the sooner it ends the better
 it will be, for it is extremely unjust and inhuman. The sooner
 the peoples of the colonial countries are freed from it the
 better it will be. We are the sincerest friends of those who
 fight against colonial slavery and colonial dependence.
 (Applause.) We shall rejoice in and acclaim the liquidation
 of colonial regimes. I think the majority of the British
 people will do the same. (Applause.)
 The time when the colonialists could boss it over the colo-
 nial and dependent countries with impunity is receding into
 the past.  But the colonialists themselves will not, of
 course, wish to part of their own free will with a system
 which enables them to plunder whole peoples. That is not
 a thing to count on.

 In our speeches and acts we wish to express our sympathy
 with the, peoples who have pot yet freed themselves from
 the yoke of colonialism and their fight for national lib,-
 eration. (Prolonged applause.)
 We understand that if the colonialists feel insulted it is
 not because in our speeches we condemn the past activity of
 the colonialists in India and Burma.
 In their efforts to justify by some means the activity of
 their predecessors in the oppression of the peoples of the colo-
 nial and dependent countries they try to maintain the pres-
 ent positions of the colonialists, which are still powerful
 enough. For even now they have a lot of colonies.
 Let 'us just take Africa. It is divided entirely between
 European and non-European countries. There are various
 forms and various methods of pursuing colonialist policy,
 but that does not make the chains of colonial slavery any
 the lighter. Those chains strangle the peoples of colonial and
 dependent countries and make them hate the colonialists.
 The peoples of these countries rise with greater and great-
 er determination to fight against the colonial regimes, And
 we sympathize with their struggle and wish them every
 success. (Stormy, applause.)
 One must simply wonder at certain short-sighted poli-
 ticians accusing,us of hostility towards Britain' or America
 and saying that we want to raise quarrels between those coun-
 tries and India, Burma and other countries. They themselves
 commit hostile acts towards those countries.
 What, for example, can be the attitude in India to the
 statement made by Mr. Dulles and the Foreign Minister
 of Portugal, Mr. Cunha, concerning Goa?
 Just think of what Dulles said: he took the liberty  of
 openly declaring that the Indian territory of Goa must be-
 long to Portugal just because the Portuguese conquerors
 seized it 400 years ago.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 In this respect the Indian press justly reminded Mr.
 Dulles that 250 years ago what is now the United States
 of America was a British colony, and that if we followed
 his logic then he, Dulles, should consider himself even
 as a subject of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain.
 (Laughter. Applause.)
 To agree with Mr. Dulles' statement would be not only
 blessing but  even  perpetuating the system of colonial
 oppression.
 We, of course, cannot agree with it. We are of the opinion
 that it is an incorrect statement arising from an incorrect
 attitude to the interests of peoples. And the Indian people,
 as well as the leading politicians in India, estimated  the
 Dulles-Cunha joint statement about Goa at its just worth,
 for this statement is a disgrace for civilized states.
 Allow me, in the same connection, to say a few words
 about another question over which the Indian people are
 rightly worried, the so-called  Kashmir question. During
 our visit to Kashmir Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin and
 I said clearly and definitely what Soviet people think on
 this question, which rose not in the people but was artificially
 conjured up by certain states who wish to sow enmity be-
 tween peoples.
 In Kashmir we were convinced that its people regard
 its territory as an inalienable part of the Republic of India.
 This question has been irrevocably decided by the people
 of Kashmir and it is our profound conviction that the Kash-
 mir people will succeed in finally arranging its affairs with-
 out any interference from outside, whether or not that
 pleases those who desire to create in Kashmir a new centre
 of unrest and international dispute. (Applause.)

 Republic of India has the understanding and sympathy of
 the Soviet people, as have also the desires of all peoples
 fighting for their national independence.
 In our speeches in India and 13urma we said that our
 country is European and Asian at the same time, and that
 a large part of its territory lies on the Asian continent. At the
 same time we stressed that all the peoples of the Soviet
 Union, irrespective of whether they live in the European or
 the Asian part of the country and of the colour of their skin
 and their religious beliefs, make up a single brotherly fam-
 ily, strong in its indestructible friendship. All the peoples
 of our country are united by the great aim of building com-
 munism. (Stormy applause.)
 The Soviet Union is a great multi-national state composed
 of sixteen equal voluntarily united Union Republics. All
 power in our country belongs to the working class, the la-
 bouring peasantry and the intellectuals-the workers of
 Soviet society.
 We have always been opposed to national oppression, to
 the exploitation of man by man whatever its form, and
 more so to the mastery of the colonialists who have brought so
 much suffering to humanity. We declared this once more
 quite frankly and straightforwardly in our speeches in
 India and Burma, underlining that the colonial system is
 anti-popular and profoundly unjust.
 Why are the colonialists so worried?
 Because our words stirred enormous sympathy in the
 popular masses. And not only where we spoke, but where
 people heard of our speeches and where they will still hear
 more of the unshakable position of the Soviet Union, condemn-
 ing the colonial system of oppression and enslavement.
 (Stormy applause.)                            I
 These are words of truth, and the imperialists will not
 succeed in keeping them out by any iron curtain.

 It must be noted that the enemies of colonialism are not
 the only ones to censure Dulles' position; it is censured too
 by men who are not opponents of the colonial regime. As an
 instance we may quote the speech by American Senator
 Kefauver.
 "We in the United States," the Senator said, "must com-
 pletelydisassociate ourselves from the old colonialism in Asia."
 Note the fact that Mr. Kefauver does not call for a renun-
 ciation of colonialism in general, but of the "old" colonialism.
 (Laughter and animation.)
 He would like the colonialists to look for new forms in order
 to consolidate their colonial mastery and advises "new-
 fashioned" colonialism.
 That is why he gives the challenge: "We must not allow
 our aid to be used to prop up bad governments."
 That is a most valuable acknowledgement.
 The colonialists see how determinedly the peoples are
 rising against colonial slavery. They see that the peoples are
 prepared for self-sacrifice and courageous feats and a self-
 less fight for the freedom and national independence of
 their countries. The colonial ists have already been driven out
 of a large number of countries.
 An inspiring example for all the peoples in the colonial
 and dependent countries has been set by the great Chinese
 people, who have thrown off the yoke of foreign oppression,
 taken their destiny in their own hands and created a powerful
 Chinese People's Republic, under the leadership of the glo-
 rious Communist Party, and are now scoring successes in the
 building of socialism. (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 The colonialists have now decided to change the forms
 of their colonial domination. They more and more seldom use
 harsh forms of violence such as sending troops to colonial
 countries and other acts of gross interference in the affairs
 of enslaved countries.

 Now they do it more delicately; they bribe people and th e
 powers that be, they implant "good governments" and create
 aggressive blocs like the Baghdad pact.
 . They release funds for what they call "economic aid,"
 give "free" arms to certain countries. But in payment for
 these arms the states which receive them must supply the
 colonialists with cannon fodder and raise great armies, thus
 exhausting their own people.
 The colonialists give one dollar in the form of "aid" in order
 later to receive ten dollars.in exchange by the exploitation
 of.the peoples who have accepted that "aid." When they
 succeed in this they enslave the peoples politically too.
 These are the "new" forms of colonial rule.
 This does not apply to the countries of Asia alone, or to
 Africa or the other so-called underdeveloped countries.
 The U.S.  monopolists, are vigorously introducing these
 forms of "aid" in the countries of 'Europe. There is a
 strong flavour of this about NATO too.
 How can we explain such "magnanimity" on the part of
 the United States, which induces it to supply free arms to
 European countries, including Western Germany which her-
 self is a highly developed country? The aim they pursue is the
 same. To fetter to themselves with chains of gold the under-
 developed countries and the highly developed ones as well.
 Exposing this policy, we say that. NATO and other similar
 blocs are organizations. which pursue far-reaching political
 and economic aims.
 They say that. NATO was organized because the Soviet
 Union displays aggressiveness and therefore some super-
 mighty united army of the states incorporated in NATO
 must be created to oppose the Soviet Union and all the coun-
 tries of the socialist camp.
 . It. is not difficult to understand for whom and for what
 such lies are needed. They are resorted to in order to divert

 the attention of the popular masses from the changes now
 taking place in countries which are becoming more and
 more dependent on the U.S. monopolists.
 But the mirage thus artificially created is already begin-
 ning to fade, and people now come to realize where truth
 is and where untruth.
 People are beginning to reason as follows: if the Soviet
 Union indeed intended to lay the road to the new social
 organization in other countries by means of war it would
 have done so long ago.
 Who in fact does not know that it was the Soviet Land
 which had the strongest army at the end of the war? Nothing
 hindered the Soviet Union then from pushing forward its
 armies and occupying the whole of Europe. Yet that did not
 happen, and it-could not happen.
 There is a well-known principle of Marxism-Leninism
 that revolutions are not exported but are achieved by the
 peoples themselves fighting for their emancipation. The
 Soviet people always followed and will follow the path of
 peaceful co-existence shown by the great Lenin, which
 provides for non-interference in the  internal  affairs of
 other states. (Prolonged applause.)
 Why, then, since the end of the war have some imperialist
 circles been fanning war hysteria in their attempts to scare
 peoples with an imaginary "Soviet menace"?
 Just for their own selfish profits.
 Their aim is clear: war hysteria is necessary for the
 imperialists in order to plunder the people with impunity, to
 develop war industry at the cost of great taxation in the
 interests of the monopoly bosses who are working for war.
 Thereby they accumulate enormous capital. It is suffi-
 cient to remember that the big U.S. monopolies now draw two
 and a half times more profits from production of war mate-
 rial than they did during the war.

 . In 1955 the profits of American corporations according
 to incomplete data were 43,000 million dollars. The monop-
 olists have therefore enough funds to give what they call
 "aid" to those countries which the United States draws into
 its sphere of influence. In reality this is not aid but throwing
 crumbs from the master's table on terms equal to slavery.
 The Soviet Union condemns such a policy. It bases its
 relations with other countries on equality and mutual ad-
 vantage and on non-interference in the internal affairs of
 those countries.
 When we give economic or technical help to this or that
 country we do it as friends, not imposing our own conditions.
 We have no superfluous capital. Our economy is run ac-
 cording to a plan. We are not interested in exporting capital
 or in exporting goods which we produce in the quantity re-
 quired for our country and for our allies and to guarantee
 trade with foreign countries. For the time being some articles
 are produced in our country in lesser quantities than we need
 for the satisfaction of the growing requirements of the
 country.
 In spite of this, however, we consider it our duty to share
 with our friends and to help them as brothers. Such help, ren-
 dered on conditions of mutual advantage, is profitable to
 both sides. Our friends see that they get disinterested help
 from us out of funds assigned from our domestic resources.
 And our friends cannot but appreciate this, for it shows our
 honourable intentions.
 In these conditions the monopolists are obliged to change
 their methods to a certain extent. Some of the more reasonabl
 bourgeois figures now say that economic help to the un-
 derdeveloped countries from the capitalist countries must be
 intensified. That is not bad. Let the capitalist countries
 give such help. It is much better than involving those coun-
 tries in war blocs and alliances.

 This aid which the capitalist states intend to render
 the countries which recently won their independence can-
 not but be regarded as a form of Soviet assistance to
 these countries. For if the Soviet Union did not exist, would
 monopolist circles and imperialist states render help to
 underdeveloped countries? Of course they would not. That
 never happened before. (Animation. Applause.)
 But I have said that the so-called "free" aid can in real-
 ity lead to the enslaving of those to whom it is offered if
 those countries are not discriminate in their  attitude
 towards it.
 Recently reviewing the successes achieved by the Conserv-
 ative  Government the then British Minister of Foreign
 Affairs, Mr. Macmillan, said among other things that that
 government had achieved success in the settlement of
 affairs with Iran, with the result that Abadan petrol began
 to flow to Britain in a broad stream.
 But this is wealth belonging to Iran that is flowing
 away. It is gold going from Iran into the  vaults of
 British, American, Dutch and French banks. And this at a
 time when the peoples of Iran are in great need. By their
 "aid" to Iran they are picking up Iran petrol dirt-cheap and
 growing rich on it and on the hunger and poverty of the
 Iranian people.
 We do not say to the peoples of Asia: do not take aid offered
 to you by the American and British monopolists. But we
 honestly warn them that they must be careful with such
 "aid," because the monopolists do not give anything free.
 Capitalists do nothing without getting paid for it. Cap-
 ital cannot exist without profits.

 workers, peasants and intellectuals of India, with all we
 came in contact with.
 We highly appreciate friendship with India, with her
 great and hard-working people, friendship with Mr. Nehru
 and other prominent Indian politicians with whom we estab-
 lished contact, and we wish to maintain and develop our
 friendly relations.
 We and our Indian friends should like to develop and
 strengthen these friendly relations without prejudice to our
 relations, or to those of India, with other states.       -
 Our friendship, as we understand it, should not be con-
 fined to friendly contacts with one, two or several states. We
 want friendship with all states.
 That is why we areglad of the friendly relations which our
 friends are developing with other states, including some
 with which we, for one reason or another, perhaps have
 somewhat strained or cool relations. Through the friend that
 we consider India to be we hope to improve our relations
 with those states.
 We have always sincerely strived for friendship with all
 countries, including the capitalist countries. In particular
 we want friendship with the most powerful of the capital-
 ist countries, the U.S.A., Britain'and France.
 When we have achieved this, and it depends mainly not
 on us but on the Governments and the peoples of the U.S.A.,
 Britain and France, we shall have created the conditions
 for real peaceful co-existence and competition between the
 two systems.
 Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved this, but we do
 not give up hope and shall spare no efforts to attain it.
 (Applause.)
 The standpoint of the leaders of India, who have declared
 that India occupies a neutral` position between us and' other
 states, 'meets with full understanding and support from us.

 India indeed is a neutral state and deserves trust and
 respect from us as well as from other states.
 Our relations with the great Chinese People's Republic
 are most brotherly. The peoples of our two countries are
 brothers.
 Friendly relations have been established and are being
 strengthened between us and the Republic of India. Wher-
 ever we went in India we heard, coming from the hearts
 of the people, the  words:  "Hindi Rusi  bha'i  bha'i/"
 - "Indians  and     Russians  are  brothers!"   (Stormy

 The Soviet Union, the Chinese People's Republic and the
 Republic of India make up one half of mankind and are
 a powerful force in the struggle for the maintenance and
 strengthening of world peace. (Stormy applause.)
 Comrade Deputies,
 Discussing the results of our visit to India, Burma
 and Afghanistan, analyzing our speeches in those countries,
 some foreign politicians and some of the more indiscriminate
 bourgeois journalists accuse the Soviet Union of renouncing
 the spirit of Geneva. That is untrue.
 We are active partakers in the important contribution
 to the easing of international tension that took place as a
 result of the meeting of the Heads of Government of the
 Four Powers in Geneva.
 We fought for that easing at the Conference of the Heads
 of Government and at the Conference of Foreign Ministers
 who were charged with considering such most important
 problems as the guarantee of security in Europe and the
 German problem, which is connected with it, the question
 of disarmament and the development of contacts between
 East and West.
 It is not our fault that we have not yet achieved the re-
 sults for which the peace-loving peoples are fighting in

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 their effort to ensure further relaxation of world tension
 and strengthen peace.
 The Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of
 the Four Powers and the Conference of Foreign Ministers,
 particularly the former, were warmly acclaimed by all peo-
 ples in the world. The peoples' desire for relaxation of inter-
 national tension and the strengthgning -of peace obliged the
 participants of these conferences to model their speeches
 and proposals accordingly.
 Unfortunately, it must be acknowledged that the repre-
 sentatives of the Western Powers at the Conference of the
 Heads of Government went no further than fine words in
 support of a relaxation of international tension. This applies
 especially to their Foreign Ministers, who displayed no
 desire to work effectively and try to achieve the aims set
 before them by the Conference of the Heads of Govern-
 meat.
 This shows that the Governments of the Western Powers,
 in sending their top representatives to the Conference of
 the Heads of Government of the Four Powers, were not
 animated by the desire for a concrete solution of the questions
 on the agenda of the conference. In going to that conference
 they were making a concession to public opinion. which
 exerted pressure on them.
 The very fact of the convocation of the Conference of the
 Heads of Government of the Four Powers, the declarations
 made at it and the programme of action outlined by the
 Heads of Government for their Foreign Ministers-all this
 naturally contributed to the relaxation of international
 tension and gave rise to hopes for some more concrete steps
 to avert military conflicts and end the "cold war." Thus the
 spirit of Geneva was born.
 The peoples hailed this because they want peace, they want
 cuts in, taxation, a decrease in expenditures on armaments,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 they want these huge sums to be expended for raising the
 living standard of the population. That is the concrete de-
 sire of the peoples.
 But what pleases the peoples, what the peoples dream of,
 does not please the capitalists, who are producing atomic and
 hydrogen bombs  and  other weapons. The prospects of
 a cut in armaments and still more of disarmament are consid-
 ered by the monopolists as a prospect of a cut in profits,
 and that they can by no means agree to.
 That is why, immediately after the Conference of the Heads
 of Government of the Four Powers, those who produce means
 of destruction and those who carry out their will and occupy
 leading posts in the capitalist states, not only did not try
 to broaden and deepen the spirit of Geneva, but, on the
 contrary, they endeavoured to nip it in the bud.
 As for the Soviet Union, during the Conference of the
 Heads of Government and at the Conference of Foreign
 Ministers of the Four Powers, its representatives did all they
 could to achieve positive results.
 Unfortunately, we met no reciprocity in our endeavour,
 and the questions about which all mankind is so deeply
 concerned were not settled.
 We shall spare no efforts to settle these questions at last.
 But for that our efforts alone are not sufficient. The efforts
 of our partners are also needed.
 Finally, an enormous role falls to the social forces, the
 forces of millions of people who are for the guarantee of
 security, for disarmament, for the relaxation of international
 tension and for the cessation of the "cold war."
 The most acute question today is that of European secu-
 rity. On the solution of this question depends the settlement
 of other international problems. You know, however, that
 our partners in the negotiations, the U.S.A., Britain and
 France, opposed to this question the German problem.

 Their position is that the German Democratic Republic
 must be united to Western Germany, liquidating the social
 gains of the workers in the G.D.R., and that that united
 German state must be armed to the teeth and at the same
 time included in NATO. On these conditions they are not
 unwilling to sign a treaty on European security, although
 in fact it would not lead to a guarantee of security in
 Europe but would, on the contrary, greatly increase the dan-
 ger of a new war in Europewith all the terrible consequences
 for the peoples.
 The supporters of this position do not hide the fact that
 such a "military combination is designed for only one aim:
 to strengthen the camp of the NATO countries and to
 create for it a preponderance which would force the Soviet
 Union and the-People's Democracies to capitulate to them
 and accept their conditions.
 Fine securityl .
 Every man of common sense will understand that such
 plans are not fated to be realized. And if there is a real
 desire to solve the problem of European security, the problem
 must be approached seriously, and the real situation taken
 into account.
 This real situation Is characterized first of all by the fact
 that on German territory at present there have been estab-
 1 ished two states with different political and social systems,
 one of them, the German Democratic Republic, following
 the path of struggle for the strengthening of peace and de-
 mocracy, while the leaders of the other state, the German
 Federal Republic, aresupporters of the policy "from strength"
 with the German Federal Republic a member of the ag-
 gressive North-Atlantic bloc.
 What does this mean? It means that in the present condi-
 tions there `is no real possibility for the unification of these
 two so different German states: But does that mean that it

 Is now impossible to guarantee collective security in Europe
 and thereby to contribute to the guarantee of world peace?
 No, by no means.
 The ensuring of security in Europe and the provision of
 conditions for strengthening peace are in the interests of
 Britain and the U.S.S.R., France and Poland, Czechoslo-
 vakia and Belgium, all European states and the U.S.A. too.
 If we really proceed from this principle and remember
 that both German states,which are now members of contending
 groups of states, could successfully be members of a general
 European system of security which could replace both these
 groups, the question can be solved in the way the interests
 of the peoples demand.
 We see no other solution. Nobody will force us to strength-
 en with our own hands a military bloc directed against
 the Soviet Union and the other peace-loving states. (Ap-
 plause.)
 But that is just the aim of those who propose that we should
 agree to such a unification of Germany as would involve
 a unified Germany's membership in an aggressive anti-
 Soviet bloc.
 First of all we should like the Germans themselves, espe-
 cially in Western Germany, to understand us correctly on
 this question. The peoples of the U.S.S.R., Germany and
 the European countries of People's Democracy have twice
 been involved in the bloodshed of world wars, and the
 peoples of our country and of Germany had to bear the heav-
 iest sacrifices of all in those wars. It is high time to think
 of this and to find the correct solution which will prevent
 the reoccurrence of such events in the future.
 As for our relations with Western Germany, we have more
 than once declared that in the interests of the Soviet Union
 as well as of the German Federal Republic it is expedient
 that good friendly relations should be established between
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 our countries. All conditions are to hand for the establish-
 ment of such relations.
 I shall remark in passing that our efforts for the guarantee
 of general European security and for an appropriate solution
 of the German question are in no degree opposed to the inter-
 ests of Britain and France. On the contrary, if it is supposed
 for an instant that the completely unrealistic dream of
 militant personalities in the U.S.A. for the inclusion of a
 unified Germany in the aggressive bloc were realized, it
 would hardly be possible for the British and French to live
 in tranquillity. The German revanchists would have their
 hands untied. They would take what action they think fit,
 and naturally France would be the most tempting morsel
 for them.
 We are not talking of this because we want it to be so.
 No, we shall do everything for it not to be so. But the expe-
 rience of history teaches us that this danger exists all the
 more as France-and even Britain-is weaker than the So-
 viet Union and the People's Democracies.
 That is why it is our sincere desire to be correctly under-
 stood in France and Britain too. Is it not better for us to co-
 ordinate our activities and find the right solution for the ques-
 tion of European security rather than waste our efforts on prep-
 arations to fight against one another? (Prolonged applause.)
 In this connection I wish to recall that the proposals
 made at Geneva by the French Prime Minister, M. Edgar
 Faure, and the British Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden,
 provide a basis for negotiations on European security.
 Agreement on this question would also ease the solution
 of other most important problems, including that of dis-
 armament.
 We are all well aware that at the Geneva conferences,
 just as in UNO, the Soviet Union put forward a number of
 concrete proposals for a cut in arms, the prohibition of atomic

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and hydrogen weapons and the establishment of interna-
 tional control. Agreement on these questions was hindered
 by the change in the position of the U.S.A., which suddenly
 went back on its former proposals when we agreed to take
 them as a basis.
 Now the U.S.A., laying aside, in fact, the question of a cut
 in armaments, brings to the fore the only proposal made by
 President Eisenhower at Geneva, that of exchange of mili-
 tary information and of unhindered air photography.
 We have already pointed out that the air photography
 suggestion does not solve the problem. As long as a cut in
 armaments is not actually foreseen, but an increase of
 armaments is contemplated, the flying over territories and
 taking of air photographs can only help to fan military pas-
 sions and war hysteria. Thus we do not get control or any-
 thing like control. It is in actual fact a means for better
 reconnoitring the forces of the other country. Is it not clear
 that the information thus obtained can be used in order to
 pick out the appropriate time for a sudden attack on it.
 The question is: what is the difference between this and what
 is called military reconnaissance? There is no substantial
 difference.
 It is quite another matter to show a realistic approach to
 the problem of disarmament: to agree on levels of armament,
 on the prohibition of atomic anc! hydrogen weapons, to es-
 tablish a reasonable system of international control, practi-
 cable in present conditions, on railway junctions, naval
 bases, aerodromes and so forth, which would make it possible
 to prevent sudden attack on one country by another. Such
 measures could be quite well realized and all peoples would
 welcome them.
 Some opponents of disarmament proceed from the false
 supposition that they are superior in power and it is there-
 fore disadvantageous for them to disarm. We have warned
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and still warn, these. champions of the infamous policy
 "from strength" that they may make serious miscalculations
 in their hazardous game. (Stormy and prolonged applause.)
 We do nc t want to scare anybody. Still less do we want
 to boast about our military and technical achievements.
 But in order to cool the ardour of. the most violent champions
 of .the armament race we must remind them of the results
 of the experiments recently carried out on the latest Soviet
 hydrogen bomb.
 The power of this weapon, as was already stated, is equal
 to that of millions of tons of ordinary explosive and it can
 be considerably increased.. We are still in favour of the pro-
 hibition of the production, testing and use of all kinds of
 atomic and hydrogen weapons. But those who are opposed
 to this would do well not to forget the results of the experi-
 ments referred to. (Stormy applause.)
 The question of the development of contacts between
 East and West, which was discussed at Geneva, is, also
 of great importance. The Soviet Union does in fact promote
 the development. of such contacts. In our desire to relax in-
 ternatioual .tension. and establish business contacts with
 various foreign personalities, we, for example, have not
 refused and do not refuse visas to .foreigners who express
 thedesire to come to.the Soviet Union and learn about its life.
 This year many American senators, and congressmen were
 in our country; we willingly received them and had con-
 versations with them..
 Many correspondents of reactionary American newspapers
 who specialize in inventing the most absurd anti-Soviet
 articles travelled freely over the Soviet Union. We knew
 about this and allowed them to come to the Soviet Union,
 although it was.. common knowledge that such journalists
 come to us. only in order to.carry on writing in the spirit of
 the "cold war.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 But the American authorities have so far allowed the
 travel to America of only a small agricultural delegation,
 a delegation of builders and a single group of Soviet jour-
 nalists, who, by the way, had to wait for their visas for
 .nine months. Children were even born to some of them during
 that time. (Laughter. Applause.)
 We want an intensification of the contacts of Soviet
 people with the widest circles of the U.S.A. and other coun-
 tries. We want the strengthening of mutual friendship but
 not interference of other countries in the internal affairs
 of the Soviet Union, as someone suggested in Geneva. Nat-
 urally, we will never allow that.
 We cannot refrain from noting in passing that some
 statesmen in the West have recently manifested an under-
 standing of the spirit of Geneva which, to say the least,
 is a strange one. They want the Soviet Union unilaterally
 to disarm and to disarm morally, spiritually and ideologi-
 cally too.
 Talk on this subject is not new, this is not the first year
 it has been going on, although life has already given severe
 lessons to those who wanted to impose such conditions on
 the Soviet Union.
 I shall not be revealing any secret if I say that this unreal-
 istic policy towards the Soviet Union is being pursued most
 persistently in the United States of America, the ignoble
 role of its singular theoretician having been taken on by
 the present U.S. State Secretary, Mr. Dulles.
 It is he who for a long period has been actively agitating
 for the infamous idea of "hurling back," "massive retal-
 iation" and other absurd things.
 Not wishing, obviously, to reckon with reality, certain cir-
 cles in the U.S.A. still try under present conditions after
 the Geneva Conference of the H eads of Government of the Four
 Powers to speak the language of the already long bankrupt
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 policy "from strength." This is the source of all the talk
 that "pressure must continue to be exerted on the Soviet
 Union," "to force the Reds to retreat."
 Special mention must be made in this connection of the
 stand taken at present by some prominent U. S. statesmen,
 including President Eisenhower, who, as we know, spoke a
 lot at Geneva about the necessity for relaxation of interna-
 tional tension.
 I refer in particular to the so-called Christmas Messages
 of President Eisenhower, State Secretary Dulles and other
 responsible personages in America to the populations of
 the People's Democracies, messages which in no way reflect
 the spirit of Geneva and are nothing else but gross interfer.
 ence in the internal affairs of free and sovereign states,
 which are also members of the United Nations.
 In their Christmas Messages these American leaders stated
 that they "pray" for a change in the existing order in
 those countries and openly promise the "support".-of the
 United States of America in this respect.     /
 Does this show a desire for reconciliation, alyf endeavour
 to strengthen and extend the spirit of Geneva.
 No, it tends in exactly the opposite dirttioni, it leads to
 the fanning of passions and, consequently; to anew armament
 race, to the aggravation of the threat of war.
 I really did not want to talk about all this and especially
 of Mr. Eisenhower, for whom I have particular respect. It
 may be said that Khrushchov, when he talks about these
 questions, wants to do away with the spirit of Geneva. But
 really it i*hot I who put forward all these questions; I am
 just answering those who violate the spirit of Geneva, by
 openly' interfering in the internal affairs of our allies
 and friends, the countries of People's Democracy.
 As I have come to talk of the Christmas Messages which
 have such an outspoken political character, we can under-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 stand their authors for they belong to pretty solid firms.
 Let us take as an example an eminent representative of that
 group, Mr. Harriman. It is common knowledge that he is
 a multi-millionaire. Others too have more or less solid capi-
 tal; God knows how much, we have not counted it; but if
 they have fewer millions than Harriman, they certainly want
 to have more than he has. (Animation.)
 They are therefore bothered not so much about human souls
 as about their own fortunes. (Laughter. Applause.)
 When the authors of the Christmas Messages advise a
 change of order in the countries of People's Democracy,
 they are backing Bat'a, Radziwill, Potocki, Bratianu and
 other big capitalists and landed magnates who were pitched
 out of the countries of People's Democracy by the workers
 of those countries. (Prolonged applause.) But the peoples of
 those countries must not be identified with the Bat'as, the
 Radsiwills, the Potockis, the Bratianus and others.
 The American authors of the by no means religious Christ-
 mas Messages are closely connected with the capitalists who
 were drivers away or fled from the countries of People's
 Democracy. In their desire to change the new way of life
 in the countries-of People's Democracy these American poli-
 ticians want the restoration in those countries of the capi-
 talist order, the restoration of capitalist works and factories,
 the return of the land to the big estate-owners.
 But Mr. Harriman does not want the capitalists alone
 to return to those countries, he himself apparently wants
 to boss t,in Hungary's economy as he did befdre People's
 Democty was established there.
 But there is no return to the old. No Christmas Messages
 will help either the landlords or the capitalists, the bankers
 or the big tradesmen, or any other exploiters whom the work-
 ers have driven out of the countries of People's_Democracy.
 (Stormy, prolonged applause.)

 Here we can recall our ows experience: When the peoples
 of our country overthrew the capitalist order and created
 the first state of workers and peasants in the world there
 were no few champions of the old capitalist order within
 the country as well as abroad, who prayed hard.for the res-
 toration in, Russia of the old capitalist order.
 Abroad they were praying with all theii hearts for the
 Milyukovs, the Tereshchenkos, the Hugheses, the Ryabu-
 shinskys and other representatives of big capital, for the
 restoration of the power of the capitalists and landowners.
 But what came of it?
 All the attempts of international imperialism to rehabili-
 tate the capitalist order in our country fell through. The
 Soviet people, led by its experienced leader, the Communist
 Party, shattered all who tried by force of arms or by va-
 rious other methods to restore the capitalist order in Russia.
 The peoples of our country set out assuredly and firmly
 on the path of socialist development and were the first in
 the. world to build a socialist society, thus turning into a
 reality the age-old dream of labouring mankind. They creat-
 ed a powerful socialist industry, the level of whose develop-
 ment can be, characterized by the following figures: in 1955
 the gross production of all industry in the U.S.S.R. exceeded
 the 1913 level 27 times, while the production of means of
 production robe sixtyfold, the production of electric power
 86 times and engineering production more than 160 times.
 (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 Agriculture in our country is growing and developing.
 Whereas before the revolution 76 per cent of the popula-
 tion of Russia was illiterate, illiteracy in our country had
 disappeared in the main by the Second World, War.
 This year there are nearly 35 million pupils in the schools
 and technical schools in our country. In the higher educa-
 tional establishments there are now more than 1,,865,000 stu-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9

 dents. Considerably more specialists are turned out in the
 Soviet Union than in Britain, France, Italy and other West
 European capitalist countries taken together. (Applause.)
 It was not without reason that that active opponent of
 communism, Mr. Churchill, who not only prayed for the
 restoration of the capitalist order in our country, but want-
 ed to restore that order in Russia by force, is now compelled
 to admit that in the preparation of specialists the Soviet
 Union has by far outstripped the capitalist countries. That
 grieves Mr. Churchill but it gladdens us all. (Stormy
 applause.)
 The remarkable results in the development of our country
 are an inspiring example for the workers in the countries
 of People's Democracy and the peoples of other countries.
 The peoples of the whole world, including those of the
 colonial and dependent states, are opposing with growing
 determination the exploitation of man by man, the oppres-
 sion of some countries by others.
 In that we cannot fail to see an expression of the great
 force of the teachings of  Marxism-Leninism which are
 penetrating into the conscience of millions of people on all
 continents. The future belongs to these teachings. (Stormy,
 prolonged  applause.)
 The workers in the countries of People's Democracy,
 who have been convinced by their own experience that only
 the overthrow of the power of the capitalists, the passing
 of power into the hands of the people, leads to real freedom,
 will answer the intrigues of their ill-wishers by rallying
 still more closely round their Communist Parties, Workers'
 Parties and Parties of Labour.
 No matter how the capitalists rage they will not succeed
 in disorganizing the socialist camp. We shall continue to
 march along the path shown to us by the great Lenin; we
 shall go on together firmly hand in hand, sweeping from our

 way in our countries all that hinders progress in the building
 of communist society. (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 Certain more far-sighted and sober politicians in Britain,
 the United States of America and France realize that the
 stand taken of late by certain circles in the Western Powers
 is contrary to the spirit of Geneva.
 I may quote the recent speech by Lord Chorley who admit-
 ted that the Western Powers were largely responsible for
 the failure of the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers.
 "I must say," said Lord Chorley, "that I think the theory
 that the Western Powers have the monopoly of reasonable-
 ness will not stand up to examination...." I shall point out,
 by the way, that we quite agree with this. (Animation.)
 "They have in fact pursued what seems to me to be quite ob-
 viously the policy of old-fashioned 'power politics.' On the
 other hand, the U.S.S.R. has, I think, made quite substan-
 tial concessions and pursued a policy which is much more
 flexible and as a result of that has obtained advantage."
 One cannot fail to agree with this appraisal.
 Trying to throw the blame on others and to accuse us of
 violating the spirit of Geneva, some bourgeois journalists
 refer to my speeches and to speeches of other Soviet statesmen
 and politicians. They complain that in our speeches we say
 that the teachings of Marxism-Leninism will triumph. Is
 that violating' the spirit of Geneva?
 We did say and we still say that in peaceful competition
 between the two economic systems the socialist system. will
 win, being the most progressive and most advanced system
 which relies on the only correct Marxist-Leninist theory.
 (Stormy applause.)
 We are not surprised and we do not protest when the ideol-
 ogists of the capitalist world, that is, of the opposite system,
 affirm that capitalism will win. We consider such an argu-
 ment natural. Only history will decide it.

 If some politicians consider our assurance that socialism,
 the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, will win as a violation
 of the spirit of Geneva, they evidently misunderstand the
 spirit of Geneva. They should remember that we have never
 renounced and never will renounce our ideas or the fight for
 the victory of communism. They will never see ideological
 disarmament  in  our  country.  (Stormy, prolonged  ap-
 plause.)
 Our conviction in the final victory of communism is not
 to the liking of the supporters of capitalism, and that neither
 surprises nor embarrasses us. But we say: in this competition,
 in this contest we shall never start an aggressive war; we
 shall tirelessly oppose all armament races and support disar-
 mament, the strengthening of peace and peaceful co-exist-
 ence.
 Thus facts convincingly show that it is not the Soviet
 Union but our Geneva Conference partners who are violating
 the spirit of Geneva.
 Let us take the following examples. The ink on the joint
 communique on the results of the Geneva Conference was
 still wet, when certain of our partners at that conference
 started to enlist new countries into the aggressive Baghdad
 pact; they have drawn Iran into it and are drawing other
 states into it.
 At the first sitting of the present session of the Supreme
 Soviet we listened with attention to a speech by the head of
 the parliamentary delegation of Iran, Mohammed Sayed,
 who said that the people of Iran want peace and friendship
 with the Soviet Union.
 We greet this statement, but we cannot refrain from
 saying that in spite of all the efforts of the Soviet Union to
 guarantee friendly relations with Iran the Government of
 that country has entered the Baghdad military bloc and
 therefore put the territory of Iran at the disposal of aggres-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 sive forces who are hatching plans of violence against the
 Soviet Union.
 This applies not only to Iran, it applies to Turkey too.
 It will be recalled that when Turkey was led by Kemal
 Atatiirk and Ismet Inonu we had very good relations with
 her which were subsequently darkened. -We cannosay that it
 was only Turkey's fault, on our side, too, inappropriate dec-
 larations were made which cast a shadow over our relations.
 But subsequently measures were taken on our part to
 change the situation and restore friendly, relations with that
 country. On the Turkish statesmen's part, however., there
 was unfortunately no reciprocity.
 American generals and admirals travel through Turkey
 making bellicose speeches, demonstrating their power by
 visits of naval detachments.
 It is hardly reasonable of the Governments of Iran and
 Turkey to link their fate with the aggressive Baghdad pact
 and to refuse to establish good-neighbourly, friendly rela-
 tions with the Soviet Union.
 The position of Pakistan towards her. neighbours is a simi-
 lar one; she is also a member of the Baghdad pact. Is it not
 a fact that Pakistan's relations with India, with Afghanistan
 and with the Soviet Union leave much to be desired?
 In particular we cannot fail to notice that quite recently
 the American Admiral Radford visited Pakistan and then
 Iran. He travelled through these countries obviously not
 in order to strengthen economic and cultural ties, but for
 quite different aims.
 This visit by an American admiral confirms the fears
 expressed previously that contrary to their national interests
 Pakistan and Iran are being more and more involved in
 adventurous machinations by the organizers of aggressive
 blocs. There is no doubt that if Pakistan had adopted the
 same independent attitude as, for example, India, quite
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 different conditions would have been provided for the estab-
 lishment of friendly relations between Pakistan and neigh-
 bouring countries.
 We are sure that it will be understood in Pakistan in what
 an unenviable position the country has fallen and that the
 necessary conclusions will be drawn. We on our side are
 ready to meet attempts to'establish friendly relations with
 Pakistan.
 In connection with the Baghdad pact a few words must
 be said about the situation in the Middle East countries.
 As is known, the organizers of the Baghdad pact are doing
 all they can to draw the Arab countries into that pact. How-
 ever, they are meeting growing opposition from the peoples
 of those countries.
 The Soviet public has followed and still follows with
 sympathy the courageous struggle of the people of Jordan
 against attempts to include the country in the Baghdad
 pact against its will.
 We understand the strivings of the peoples of the Arab
 countries who are fighting for their full liberation from
 foreign dependence. At the same time the activity of the
 state of Israel, which ever since it came into existence has
 been threatening its neighbours and pursuing a hostile
 policy towards them, must be condemned.
 It is clear that such a policy does not correspond to the
 national interests of the state of Israel and that behind
 those who are pursuing it are imperialist states which are
 known to all. They are trying to make use of Israel as a
 weapon against the Arab peoples with a view to plunder-
 ing the natural wealth of that area.
 While the Western Powers continue the policy of armament
 race and build up aggressive blocs, the Soviet Union is con-
 sistently and firmly pursuing its peace-loving foreign poli-
 cy, strengthening friendship with all peoples who desire

 it in the interests of the consolidation of peace and
 security.
 This year alone the Soviet Union cut down its armed forces
 by 640,000 men, gave up its military base in Finland-
 Porkkala Udd-and withdrew its troops from Port Arthur
 before the appointed time. The Soviet Union signed, the
 State Treaty with Austria, which has now set out on the
 path of permanent neutrality, and withdrew its troops from
 her territory; it established diplomatic relations with the
 German Federal Republic and undertook a number of other
 just as effective measures for the strengthening of peace.
 The Soviet, Union re-established friendly relations with
 Yugoslavia, with whom for a long time we had had abnormal,
 tense relations. We will continue to develop our :good-
 neighbourly, friendly relations with Yugoslavia, to extend
 economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and
 Yugoslavia. (Prolonged applause.)
 Our visit to India, Burma and Afghanistan holds a
 prominent place in this series of measures, as also do the
 agreements achieved between the Soviet Union and these
 countries.
 During the discussion on the State Budget for 1956 at the
 present session of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. we
 all voted unanimously for a decrease in expenditure on de-
 fence needs by almost 10,000 million rubles in comparison
 with last year.
 On the other hand, the Defence Minister of the U.S.A.,
 Mr. Wilson, declared recently that expenditures for the
 maintenance of the U.S. armed forces will be increased
 in the new budget year by 1,000 million dollars and will
 amount to the enormous sum of 35,500 million dollars. Wil-
 son did not say that over and above this the budget foresees

 mulation of supplies of strategic material and  military
 "aid" to foreign states.
 This, whereas on our side there are concrete steps to ease
 international tension, on the other side, on the side of
 the Western Pcwers, we unfortunately see nothing of the
 kind. On the contrary, in the United States of America
 allocations for armament-, are being increased. Leading
 politicians in that country are extending aggressive pacts,
 and some of them come forward with warlike declarations
 which are by no means directed towards the strengthening
 of the spirit of Geneva.
 Who therefore is strengthening the spirit of Geneva and
 who is undermining it?
 In cpnclusion I should like to dwell on the question of the
 further existence of the Information Bureau of Communist and
 Workers' Parties, which in the West is called the Cominform.
 Strictly speaking, there are no grounds for such a question
 to arise. But foreign journalists in India often asked us:
 "Why do you not dissolve the Cominform? Can the activity
 of the Communist Parties in other countries not be stopped?"
 Other people asked us the same question in their conversa-
 tions.
 We in turn said to those people: "But why do you not sug-
 gest the dissolution of the Socialist International? Why do
 you not suggest to do away with the various international
 unions of capitalists?"
 Our interlocutors could give no answer.
 Naturally, the Cominform is not to the liking of the op-
 ponents of communism. But scientific communism as a
 doctrine existed almost a hundred years before the Inform-
 bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties was founded.
 Collaboration within the framework of the Cominform is a
 domestic matter for the Communist and Workers' Parties
 which stand on the platform of Marxism-Leninism and prop-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 agate a definite order of social organization. The Commu-
 nist Parties represent the working class, they express and
 defend its interests, the vital interests of the popular masses.
 It is not only the Cominform that the enemies of commu-
 nism do not like. Still less to their liking is the irrefutable
 fact that the all-triumphant doctrine of communism is
 every year winning to its banner more and more people in all
 countries. (Prolonged applause.)
 The Soviet people will remember how at one time the
 S.-R.'s, Mensheviks and other enemies of the working class
 said that they were for Soviet power but without the Bolshe-
 viks. By such slogans those parties wished to deceive the
 people, to tear them away from their leader, the Communist
 Party, founded by the great Lenin. They knew that power could
 be changed, but that it was impossible to change the Commu-
 nist Party. It is impossible to force it to retreat from the de-
 fence of the interests of the working class, theinterests of the
 people, for the Communist Party is the genuine leader of the
 working class and the labouring peasantry, the leader of the
 people.and the mouthpiece of their vital interests. (Stormy
 applause.)
 The Communist Parties in all countries, following the
 example. of the Communist Party, of the Soviet Union,
 link all their activity indissolubly with the interests of the.
 people, the interests of the working class. This is not to the
 liking of those who wish to oppress the people for ever.
 No more to their liking is the international solidarity of the
 working class; they naturally wish that the Cominform should
 cease to exist. But that does not depend on them! (Stormy
 applause.)
 These are perhaps all the questions which it was necessary
 in my opinion to dwell upon in detail.
 To conclude my speech I should like to express the assur.

 ante that the Supreme Soviet will approve the results
 of our visit to India, Burma and Afghanistan, for it pro-
 motes the strengthening of friendship and co-operation of
 the peoples of the Soviet Union with the peoples of India,
 Burma and Afghanistan. And in the friendship of the peoples
 of the world lies the mighty source of the power of the peoples
 who are barring the way to the outbreak of a new war.
 (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 Allow me, Comrade Deputies, from this rostrum to express.
 once more our heartfelt gratitude to the great Indian people,
 to the Government of the Republic of India and to the Prime
 Minister, Mr. Nehru, personally (stormy applause); to the
 friendly people of the Union of Burma, her Government and
 the Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, personally (stormy
 applause); to the friendly people of Afghanistan, her Govern-
 ment and to the Prime Minister, Mohammed Daoud, per-
 sonally. (Stormy applause.)
 We are grateful from the bottom of our hearts for the hospi-
 tality, solicitude and affection the millions of people in
 those countries showed towards the Soviet Union and to
 our great people during our visit to India, Burma and
 Afghanistan. (Stormy applause.) From the bottom of our
 hearts we thank the statesmen and public figures whom we
 met, the leaders of the states and provinces which we visited
 and in which we were everywhere given the most cordial
 welcome. (Stormy applause.)
 Long live the great friendship of all the peoples of the
 world! (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 Long live the Soviet people, the powerful and fearless
 fighter for the cause of peace! (Stormy, prolonged applause.)
 Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
 the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet
 Union! (Stormy and prolonged applause and cheers. All
 rise.)

 JOINT DECLARATION OF N. A. BULGANIN,
 CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S.S.R. COUNCIL
 OF MINISTERS,
 N. S. HHRUSHCHOV, MEMBER
 OF THE PRESIDIUM
 OF THE U.S.S.R. SUPREME SOVIET,
 AND JAWAHARLAL NEHRU,
 PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA
 At the invitation of the Government of the Soviet Union
 the Prime Minister of India visited the Soviet Union in
 June 1955. He was given a warm welcome and his trip
 strengthened friendship and mutual understanding between
 the peoples of both countries. A Joint Statement by
 the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.
 and the Prime Minister of India was published towards the
 end of the visit, on June 22, 1955.
 At the invitation of the Indian Government N. A. Bul-
 ganin, Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers,
 N. S. Khrushchov, Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet, and other official representatives of the
 Soviet Union accompanying them visited India in November-
 December 1955. The population of India enthusiastically
 welcomed them wherever they went. Their visit strength-
 ened the bonds of friendship linking the two countries and
 their peoples. N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov visit-
 ed different agricultural, industrial and hydro-technical
 developments, and regions where agricultural reconstruc-
 tion is being carried out, state-owned farms and other cen-
 tres of Indian economic development.
 The visit to India of N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the
 U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, and N. S. Khrushchov,

 Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet,
 and the visit to the Soviet Union of the Prime Minister of
 India, Jawaharlal Nehru, provided them with the opportu-
 nity of making personal acquaintance with the peoples of
 these countries and their way of life, with the problems,
 achievements, and aspirations of each country, and led to
 mutual understanding between them and the peoples of
 their respective states, based on mutual respect, good will
 and tolerance.
 The above-mentioned  Joint Statement  published on
 June 22, 1955, expressed their firm adherence to the Five
 Principles also known as Panch Shila.
 These Principles proclaim that countries differing from
 one another politically, socially and economically can and
 must co-operate on the basis of mutual respect, and non-
 interference in one another's home affairs, and must abide
 by the policy of active and peaceful co-existence in the
 common desire to attain the ideals of peace and the improve-
 ment of living conditions.
 Since these Five Principles were proclaimed a number
 of countries have adhered to, or expressed their agreement
 with, them. The countries represented at the Bandung
 Conference unanimously adopted a Declaration confirming
 these Principles, which have now won general recognition
 as a solid basis for co-operation between countries.
 During the present visit of N. A. Bulganin and N. S.
 Khrushchov to India a free and frank exchange of opinion
 on problems of the international situation took place between
 them and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This
 exchange of opinion bore out their firm conviction that in-
 ternational relations must be based on the Five Principles
 and that everything must be done to ease international
 tension and promote the consolidation of peace and inter-
 national co-operation.

 The Four Heads of Government Conference in Geneva in
 July 1955 resulted in the recognition by the Great Powers
 represented there of the senselessness of war, which owing
 to the development of atomic and hydrogen weapons can
 bring only calamities to mankind. This fundamental admis-
 sion that war must be ruled out as a method of settling in-
 ternational disputes was received with deep satisfaction by
 the peoples of the world and resulted in a substantial relax.
 ation of international tension. Although basic problems
 of Europe and Asia still remain unsolved, the natural con-
 sequence of excluding war as a method of settling'' out.
 standing questions was a change. in the approach to them
 and the striving to solve them through negotiations. Dip.
 lomatic relations  were established between the; Soviet
 Union and the German Federal Republic. Ne~tiations
 were started and are still continuing on an ambassadorial
 level between the United States of America afthe Chinese
 People's Republic. The conference on tle uses of atomic
 energy for peaceful purposes successfully concluded its
 work this August, and the U.N. General Assembly passed
 a resolution on the setting up of an International Atomic
 Energy Agency.
 In order to continue the settlement of outstanding ques-
 tions through  negotiations, the Four Heads of Govern-
 ment Conference held in Geneva last July pointed to the
 necessity of convening a Conference of Foreign Ministers
 of the respective countries. This conference was recently
 held in Geneva. It did not reach any agreement on the
 problems discussed, therefore the great hopes which had
 appeared as a result of the Four Heads of Government
 Conference have so far not materialized. The conference,
 however,- contributed to a clearer understanding of the prob-
 lems facing the world, and it- is an indisputable fact that all
 these problems can be solved only by peaceful methods and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 through peaceful negotiations if war is to be excluded as
 it should be according to the general opinion. Therefore,
 disappointment over the results of the Geneva Foreign
 Ministers' Conference can be only temporary and it is
 necessary to continue to exert every effort to ease inter-
 national tension, considering negotiations to be the sole
 method  of settling  outstanding  issues. The statesmen
 of both countries express their hope that the negotiations
 on an ambassadorial level between the United States of
 America and the Chinese People's Republic will lead not
 only to the  solution of the questions under discussion,
 but also to greater mutu'l understanding through confer-
 ences at a higher level. They are convinced that durable
 peace fn Asia is unthinkable without according the Chinese
 People's Republic its legitimate place in the United Nations.
 They express deep regret at the delay in recognizing this
 indisputable fact. They sincerely hope that other Far East-
 ern and Asian Iproblems will be speedily solved through
 agreement, namely: the legitimate rights of the Chinese
 People's Republic to the offshore islands and Taiwan must
 be satisfied and the Korean question solved on the basis
 of recognition of the national rights of the Korean people
 and in conformity with the interests of peace in the Far
 East.
 The statesmen of the U.S.S.R. and the Prime Minister
 of India expressed satisfaction with the Geneva Conference
 on Indo-China held last year. That conference put an end
 to the destructive war in Indo-China and outlined the pro-
 cedure for settling the problems of the Indo-China states.
 They note with regret that obstacles are being raised to
 the implementation of the Geneva agreements for Viet-
 Nam and that there are also difficulties in implementing
 the Geneva agreements on Laos. Violation of these agree-
 ments will have exceedingly grave consequences both for
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Indo-China and the whole world. Therefore, the statesmen of
 both countries wish to appeal to all the signatories of,
 and the parties concerned in, the agreements to eliminate
 the obstacles now standing in the way of an effective im-
 plementation of the Geneva agreements and to co-operate fully
 in the execution of these agreements both in letter and spirit.
 It is their firm conviction that the principle of universal-
 ity must be applied in respect of United Nations member-
 ship. Until this principle is observed the United Nations
 will not be representative of all the countries of the world.
 Therefore they welcome the recommendation of the United
 Nations General Assembly on the simultaneous admission
 of 18 countries to the United Nations and sincerely hope
 that this recommendation will soon be adopted by the Se-
 curity Council and carried into effect.
 There is no other way of establishing peace throughout
 the world and eliminating the conditions leading to an-
 other devastating world war than disarmament. The increase
 or even the maintenance of the existing level of armaments
 is a constant threat of war, a source of fear and the cause
 of the race in the production of latest types of weapons of
 mass destruction. A pressing need of disarmament rises in
 direct proportion to the invention and accumulation of
 weapons of ever-growing destructive potential. The wide-
 spread desire to see war eliminated demands positive, con-
 structive and swift steps towards disarmament. Agreement,
 has already been achieved to a great extent on this ques-
 tion, and obviously there is no reason why the remaining
 obstacles should not be quickly overcome if the estab-
 lishment of lasting peace is the set goal. In particular,. the
 statesmen of both countries wish once again to express
 their firm conviction that the manufacture, use and testing
 of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons must be uncondition-
 ally prohibited.. Besides this, there must be a substantial
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 reduction of conventional armaments and an effective in-
 ternational control to ensure the strict implementation of
 such prohibition and disarmament. Until this is achieved the
 whole world will be darkened and depressed by the fear of
 war and the peoples will doubt the sincerity of the desire for
 peace.
 The statesmen of the U.S.S.R. and the Prime Minister
 of India have agreed that the forming of military alliances
 or regional military blocs is not a means of safeguarding
 peace and security. Such alliances have extended the bounds
 of the "cold war" and have introduced the element of in-
 stability in the areas in question, have increased fear and
 tension and raised additional obstacles to the peaceful de-
 velopment of the countries concerned. Peace and genuine
 security of the peoples can be assured only by the collective
 efforts of states.
 One of the most effective means of reducing  fear and
 international tension is to eliminate barriers to mutual
 co-operation and understanding. For this purpose cultural
 and economic relations between countries should be encour-
 aged. The statesmen of both countries noted with satis-
 faction the ever-increasing opportunities for the peoples
 of both countries to get to know each other better through
 the regular exchange of visits by scientists, technical ex-
 perts,  economists,  members  of  parliament, writers and
 other cultural workers of both countries. They hope that
 there will be a steady extension of such opportunities for
 mutual contacts on a basis facilitating understanding of,
 and respect for, the different ways of life in the two coun-
 tries.
 The Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers,
 the Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme So-
 viet and the Prime Minister of India, therefore, welcome the
 development of co-operation between the two  countries
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9

 in building the BhilaiIron and Steel Works in India and
 in carrying . out other projects on which negotiations are
 already  being conducted. India's second five-year plan,
 which devotes main attention to the development of heavy
 industry, can offer further possibilities for such co-operation.
 They consider it desirable that upon completion of the nec-
 essary  preliminary  work competent  representatives of
 both countries meet to examine mutually advantageous
 forms of economic and technical co-operation and to reach
 agreeihent on concrete matters in cases when this is deemed
 necessary.
 The visit of N. A. Bulganin and N. S. Khrushchov to
 India is an exceedingly important event not only because
 it has brought the two countries closer together, but also
 because it promotes the cause of universal peace. The
 Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, N. A. Bul-
 ganin, Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet, N. S. Khrushchov, and the Prime Minister of India,
 Jawaharlal Nehru, again proclaim their faith in the future
 and their firm resolve to devote their efforts to the consoli-
 dation of peace for the good of the peoples of their countries
 and of the whole world.

 JOINT SOVIET-INDIAN COMMUNIQUE
 ON ECONOMIC RELATIONS
 BETWEEN INDIA AND THE U.S.S.R.
 The Joint Declaration of N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of
 the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, N. S. Khrushchov,
 Member of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet,
 and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, notes the
 desire of both countries to develop economic co-operation
 and to extend trade relations. In connection with this, rep-
 resentatives of the Government of the U.S.S.R. and the
 Government of India held preliminary negotiations and ar-
 rived at the understanding that it would be to the mutual
 advantage of both countries to increase the volume of trade
 to the maximum. As a first step in this direction the follow-
 ing agreement has also been reached:
 1. A) The U.S.S.R. will deliver and India will buy
 over a period of three years beginning with 1956 one mil-
 lion tons of rolled ferrous metals, including 300,000 tons
 in the first year and 350,000 tons annually during the two
 following years. The time-limits and terms of these deliveries
 are to be agreed upon during subsequent negotiations.
 B) Over a period of three years the U.S.S.R. will sell
 and India will buy such equipment for oil extraction, for
 the mining industry and other equipment, and also such other
 goods as may be agreed upon by the parties. The delivery
 dates and the terms of sale and purchase of these goods

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and equipment will be agreed upon during subsequent
 negotiations.
 C) The U.S.S.R. will considerably  increase its pur-
 chases both of raw materials and manufactured goods in
 India on terms and at dates which will be agreed upon by
 negotiation between the buyers and sellers. The hope is
 expressed that the total value of such purchases, including
 the sums which may be required for the maintenance of
 Soviet official organizations in India, will be equal to the
 total value of the goods purchased by India in the U.S.S.R.
 D) As provided for in the Soviet-Indian trade agreement,
 both Governments will afford maximum facilities as regards
 the imports and exports of the aforesaid goods, permitted
 by their respective laws, rules and regulations, and will
 co-operate in every possible way towards that end,
 2. Taking into account the planned increase in the volume
 of trade and with a view to ensuring the proper conditions
 for shipment of these goods, both Governments consider it
 necessary to establish regular shipping lines between the
 ports of the U.S.S.R. and India, using Soviet and Indian
 vessels.
 3. The representatives of both Governments have also
 agreed to send delegations from the U.S.S.R. to India or
 from India to the U.S.S.R. within the shortest possible
 delay to discuss terms and to conclude agreements for'the
 implementation of the arrangements set above.

 RESOLUTION
 OF THE U.S.S.R. SUPREME SOVIET
 ON THE RESULTS OF THE VISIT OF N. A. BUL4 ANIN,
 CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S.S.R. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS,
 AND N. S. KHRUSHCHOV, MEMBER OF THE PRE-
 SIDIUM OF THE U.S.S.R. SUPREME SOVIET,
 TO INDIA, BURMA AND AFGHANISTAN
 Having heard and discussed the reports of Comrade N. A.
 Bulganin, Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers,
 and Comrade N. S. Khrushchov, Member of the Presidium
 of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, on their visit to the Repub-
 lic of India, the Union of Burma and Afghanistan, the Su-
 preme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. expresses its full satisfaction
 with the results of the visit.
 The Supreme Soviet notes that the friendly visit of the
 Soviet government leaders to these countries was a major
 political event and contributed to the promotion of peace
 in Asia and the Far East and to further relaxation of inter-
 national tension.
 The enthusiasm and cordiality with which the Soviet
 statesmen were greeted in India, Burma and Afghanistan
 is regarded by the Supreme Soviet as a manifestation of
 the deep respect and friendship cherished by the peoples
 of these countries for the peoples of the Soviet Union. The
 warm reception accorded to the representatives of the Soviet
 people shows that the efforts of our people for peace, and our
 country's achievements, are understood and appreciated by
 the peoples of India, Burma and Afghanistan.
 The Supreme Soviet notes that the visit of Comrades
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Bulganin and Khrushchov was another important step in
 strengthening the friendship and co-operation of the U.S.S.R.
 with the great country of India, with Burma and Afghanistan
 in working for peace, ending the "cold war" and securing fur-
 ther relaxation of international tension. The identity of
 the aims and aspirations of these countries in relation to
 the fundamental problem of international life-the preser-
 vation and consolidation of peace-has been reaffirmed.
 This identity of views of the U.S.S.R., India, Burma and
 Afghanistan is explained not by transitory causes, it is the
 result of their common fundamental interests as countries
 which desire international peace and security.
 The talks revealed an identity of views on major aspects
 of the relations between these countries, also on such cardi-
 nal international problems as disarmament and uncondition-
 al prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, satisfying
 the lawful rights of the Chinese People's Republic in rela-
 tion to the coastal islands and to Taiwan, granting the Chi-
 nese People's Republic its rightful place in the United Na-
 tions and settling other outstanding Asian and Far Eastern
 problems in accordance with the legitimate rights of the
 nations.
 Of great importance is their unanimous agreement that
 peace can be safeguarded only by collective efforts of the
 states.
 The relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma
 and Afghanistan are based on the principles of mutual respect
 for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-
 aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
 equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence irre-
 spective of their social systems.
 The Supreme Soviet notes with satisfaction that these
 principles are gaining ever wider international recognition.
 They have been made the basis of the relations of the Chinese
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 People's Republic with other countries, and they are sup-
 ported by the countries which took part in the Bandung
 Conference and by a number of other countries in Europe
 and Asia. Adoption of these principles as the basis of the
 relations between all countries would be of enormous impor-
 tance for establishing the necessary confidence among na-
 tions and removing the threat of a new war.
 Another important result of the visit of Comrades Bulganin
 and Khrushchov to these Asian countries is the agreements
 reached with them for expanding trade, economic, cultural
 and other relations, based on the principle of equality and
 mutual benefit, and without imposing any obligations of
 a political or military nature.
 The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. Is confident that the
 contacts and co-operation between the Soviet Union, India,
 Burma and Afghanistan in various spheres of state, economic,
 social and cultural activity will effectively develop, and that
 measures will be taken to facilitate wider acquaintance of
 their peoples with each other's life, achievements and cul-
 ture, and broader interchange of experience.
 Identity of the interests of the U.S.S.R., the Republic
 of India, the Union of Burma, Afghanistan and of all other
 peace-loving states in the matter of ensuring peace and
 national independence of the peoples creates the necessary
 conditions for the development of firm and enduring friend-
 ship between these countries, and for growth of co-opera-
 tion between them, for the benefit of their peoples and in
 the interests of universal peace.
 The visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchov to India,
 Burma and Afghanistan evoked the whole-hearted approval
 of the peoples of many countries, especially colonial and de-
 pendent countries, and was hailed by all who are sincerely
 interested in eliminating the danger of war and in firm and
 enduring peace.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics considers that the visit of Comrades N. A. Bul-
 ganin, Chairman. of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers,
 and N. S. Khrushchov, Member of the Presidium of the
 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, has demonstrated the great
 importance of personal contact between statesmen for fur-
 thering mutual understanding, establishing confidence be-
 tween states, and developing international co-operation.
 This visit will have the effect of weakening the forces of
 war and of strengthening peace throughout the world.
 The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
 publics resolves:
 To approve the activity of Comrade  N. A. Bulganin,
 .Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., and
 Comrade N. S. Khrushchov, Member of the Presidium of the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., during their visit to the
 Republic of India, the Union of Burma and Afghanistan,
 as being in full accord with the peace-loving foreign policy
 of the Soviet Union and as contributing to international
 peace, friendship and co-operation.

 Chapter I
 ELECTORAL SYSTEM
 Question 1. What are the "Regulations Governing
 Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R."?
 Answer. The "Regulations Governing Elections to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R." constitute the Soviet
 electoral law; they establish the procedure of organizing
 and conducting elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. on the basis of universal, equal and direct suf-
 frage by secret ballot.
 Hence, the Regulations are a practical guide in hold-
 ing elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 Without the Regulations, it would be impossible prop-
 erly to carry out the complex work of elections for the
 supreme organ of state power in such a vast country as
 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
 That is why the Regulations are of such great impor-
 tance and why every citizen of the U.S.S.R. should be
 well acquainted with them.
 The original "Regulations Governing Elections to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R." were approved by the
 Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R. at its Fourth
 Session held on July 9, 1937; they governed the first elec-
 tions to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. held in the
 same year.
 The second elections to the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet,
 held on February 10, 1946, were conducted in conformity

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 with the "Regulations Governing Elections to the Su-
 preme Soviet of the U.S.S.R." approved by a decree of the
 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet dated October 11, 1945.
 The 1950 elections to the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet were
 held on the basis of the electoral law of January 9, 1950,
 which also governed the fourth elections to the Supreme
 Soviet in 1954.
 Question 2. What is set forth in the "Regulations Gov-
 erning Elections to the Supreme Soviet
 of the U.S.S.R."?
 Answer. The Soviet electoral law is based on the Con-
 stitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics the
 distinguishing feature of which is its genuine socialist
 democratism. The Regulations lay down the principles of
 the electoral system as established by the Constitution
 and which govern the elections to the Supreme Soviet.
 The Regulations tell how the lists of voters are compiled,
 how election districts and wards are formed, how and
 by whom the election commissions are set up and explain
 their rights and duties; they also prescribe the procedure
 for nominating candidates to the Supreme Soviet, the
 voting and the method of establishing the results.
 Question 3. In what way does Soviet electoral law
 differ from electoral laws in capitalist
 countries?
 Answer. There is a radical difference between the So-
 viet electoral law as laid down in the "Regulations Gov-
 erning Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R."
 and the electoral laws in the capitalist countries.
 The difference is no less striking than that between
 the Soviet Constitution and bourgeois constitutions. In
 substance, bourgeois constitutions give legal embodiment
 to the rule of the capitalist class, to a social and state
 system based on private ownership of the instruments
 and means of production, on the exploitation of man by
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 man, and on the subjection of vast masses of workers
 and peasants to a propertied minority. The constitutions
 in bourgeois democracies safeguard the class interests
 of this minority, not the interests of the working people.
 Nor can it be otherwise, for bourgeois democracy, "al-
 though a great historical advance compared with me-
 dievalism, always remains, and under capitalism cannot
 but remain, restricted, truncated, false and hypocritical,
 a paradise for the rich and a snare and a deception for
 the exploited, for the poor."
 In his historic report to the Extraordinary Eighth All-
 Union Congress of Soviets, J. V. Stalin pointed out that
 the constitutions of bourgeois countries rest on the pillars
 of capitalism. Bourgeois constitutions reflect these pillars
 and embody them in law.
 Bourgeois constitutions proceed from the premise that
 guidance of society by the state (the dictatorship) must
 be in the hands of the bourgeoisie, that the constitution
 must give legal embodiment to a social order that suits
 and benefits the propertied classes, and  that nations
 and races cannot have equal rights. Bourgeois consti-
 tutions merely proclaim the rights of citizens, they do
 not give them the real opportunity to exercise these
 rights.
 The 1936 Constitution of the U.S.S.R. is the constitu-
 tion of victorious socialism and rests on the great gains
 of socialism. These gains consist of the fact that in the
 land of Soviets the capitalist system with its exploitation
 of man by man,  unemployment  and  suffering for
 the masses of the people has been abolished, and of the
 victory of the workers and peasants who have established
 their own rule and built a new, socialist society.
 At bedrock of the new Constitution, J. V. Stalin said,
 are the principles of socialism, its main pillars, already

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 won and established. The Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
 reflects and embodies these principles in law.
 The Constitution of the U.S.S.R. proceeds from the
 proposition that "guidance of society by the state (the
 dictatorship) is in the hands of the working class, the
 most advanced class in society; that a constitution is need-
 ed for the purpose of consolidating the social order
 desired by and beneficial to the working people."*
 The Soviet Constitution affirms complete equality of
 rights for nations and races and ensures to citizens the
 real exercise of the rights that are theirs.
 Nothing like this exists, or can exist, in countries of
 the West.
 The constitutions and electoral laws of capitalist
 countries contain all kinds of reservations, "specifica-
 tions," "supplements" and "notes" which detract from,
 and reduce to nought, the rights and liberties formally
 proclaimed therein. This is what Marx said of bourgeois
 constitutions:
 "... each paragraph of the Constitution contains its
 own antithesis, its own Upper and Lower House, namely,
 liberty in the general phrase, abrogation of liberty in the
 marginal note."**
 The main defect of all bourgeois constitutions is their
 inherently contradictory, false, and hypocritical nature.
 J. V. Stalin pointed out that bourgeois constitutions
 often contain reservations and restrictions that mutilate
 democratic rights and liberties. As a rule the electoral
 laws in bourgeois countries best of all fulfil this function
 of "mutilating" constitutions.
 Very often bourgeois electoral laws alter or re-edit
 constitutions and, by way of "explaining" the various
 provisions of the latter virtually nullify them.

 As for the Soviet Constitution and Soviet electoral
 law, they both convey the same principles and ideas. The
 electoral law of the U.S.S.R. does not truncate, limit, or
 "correct" the Constitution, as is the case with bourgeois
 electoral laws, but ensures the fullest and most consistent
 application of the electoral system established by the
 Soviet Constitution.
 Question 4. Why does the Supreme Soviet, the high-
 est organ of state power in the U.S.S.R.,
 consist of two Chambers?
 Answer. This is explained by the special nature of the
 Soviet Union which is made up of sixteen Union Repub-
 lics that include within their boundaries several Autono-
 mous Republics, Autonomous Regions, and National
 Areas. There are many nations and small peoples in the
 Soviet state. It is obvious that their specific interests and
 needs must be reflected in a definite manner in the su-
 preme organ of state power in the country.
 "We have a supreme body," as J. V. Stalin pointed
 out, "in which are represented the common interests of
 all the working people of the U.S.S.R. irrespective of na-
 tionality. This is the Soviet of the Union. But in addition
 to common interests, the nationalities of the U.S.S.R. have
 their particular, specific interests, connected with their
 specific national characteristics. Can these specific inter-
 ests be ignored? No, they cannot. Do we need a special
 supreme body to reflect precisely these specific interests?
 Unquestionably, we do. There can be no doubt that with-
 out such a body it would be impossible to administer a
 multi-national state like the U.S.S.R. Such a body is the
 second Chamber, the Soviet of Nationalities of the
 U.S.S.R."
 The two-chamber system enables all the Soviet peo-
 ples, even the smallest, to have their specific national

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 needs and interests represented by their own deputies in
 the supreme organ of state power of the U.S.S.R.
 In establishing the two-chamber system the Constitu-
 tion of the U.S.S.R. proceeds from the fact that, in the
 Soviet Union, all the nations and races without exception
 have equal rights in all spheres of the economic, social,
 political, and cultural life of society.
 The two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R., the Soviet of the Union ,and the Soviet of Nation-
 alities, have equal rights.
 The equality of the two Chambers is ensured by the
 fact that both are equally entitled to initiate legislation,
 and a law is considered adopted provided it is passed by
 both Chambers; the Chambers are elected for an equal
 term and appoint similar standing commissions; their
 sessions begin and terminate simultaneously. In the event
 of disagreement between the Chambers, the issue is re-
 ferred for settlement to a conciliation commission formed
 on a parity basis, and if the conciliation commission fails
 to reach agreement, or if its decision fails to satisfy ei-
 ther of the Chambers, the issue is once more considered
 by both Chambers. Failing agreement, the Presidium of
 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. dissolves the Supreme
 Soviet and decrees new elections.
 Question 5. What is meant by universal suffrage?
 Answer. Universal suffrage means that all Soviet cit-
 izens who have reached the age of 18 participate in elec-
 tions, with the exception of the insane and persons sen-
 tenced by court of law to penalties involving forfeiture
 of electoral rights.
 Article 123 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. guaran-
 tees equal rights to all citizens of the U.S.S.R. irrespec-
 tive of nationality or race. Any restriction of rights or the
 establishment of any direct or indirect privileges for some
 citizens as against others on account of race, and any
 advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and contempt are punishable with  all the  severity
 of law.
 In accordance with Article 135 of the Constitution of
 the U.S.S.R. all Soviet citizens who have reached the age
 of 18, irrespective of race or nationality, sex, religious
 creed, standard of education, domicile, social origin, prop-
 erty status or past activity, have the right to participate
 in the election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. This signifies real exercise of universal suffrage.
 Citizens who have reached the age of 23 are eligible
 for election to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 In the conditions of the Soviet system and victorious
 socialism, universal suffrage is one of the most powerful
 means of drawing the masses of the people into state
 administration, ensuring free expression of the people's
 will, and increasing public control over all work of the
 various state bodies.
 "Universal, equal, and direct suffrage with secret bal-
 lot in the U.S.S.R. will be a whip in the hands of the pop-
 ulation against those organs of government which work
 badly. In my opinion, our new Soviet Constitution will
 be the most democratic constitution in the world."*
 Question 6. Are foreign citizens residing in the Soviet
 Union entitled to vote in the election of
 deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. No, they are not. The Regulations establish
 that persons residing on the Soviet territory who are not
 citizens of the U.S.S.R. but are citizens or subjects of for-
 eign states, are not entitled to elect or be elected to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 Question 7. Is universal suffrage actually exercised in
 bourgeois countries?            a

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Answer. Universal suffrage is formally proclaimed in
 many bourgeois countries. As a matter of fact, however,
 there is not a single bourgeois country in which genuinely
 universal suffrage is ensured and in which electoral
 rights are not curtailed in one way or another. Residen-
 tial, property, educational and other qualifications bar
 numerous categories of the population from participation
 in elections, with the result that suffrage is virtually de-
 prived of its universal character. In many countries
 (Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Switzerland and elsewhere) women
 are denied electoral rights. In most countries men serving
 in the armed forces are disfranchised; in those cases
 where they formally possess electoral rights they are, in
 practice, unable to exercise them. In 1942, at the height
 of the Second World War, the U.S. Senate granted serv-
 icemen the right to participate in the Congressional elec-
 tions, but only those quartered on American territory.
 Participation of the working people in elections is se-
 riously handicapped by the property qualification which
 exists in many countries.
 Another wide-spread restriction on the suffrage is the
 requirement of prolonged residence in a specific locality
 prior to the compilation of lists of voters. in a number of
 states in the U.S.A., for instance, this qualification re-
 quires that a person shall have resided in the same local-
 ity for two years, and in Belgium for six months. In
 capitalist countries, hundreds of thousands of seasonal
 workers and unemployed are affected by this qualification.
 National minorities in bourgeois countries are, as a
 rule, restricted in their electoral rights or deprived of them
 altogether. Millions of people are debarred from partici-
 pation in elections on account of race or nationality. In
 the Union of South Africa, most Negroes and Indians,
 who constitute over 85 per cent of the population, are dis-
 franchised. Countries turned into colonies or dominions
 have been placed at a disadvantage compared with the
 metropolitan countries.  In  the French  colonies, for
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 example, the entire native population, some 60 million
 people, are completely disfranchised. The vast population
 of the British colonies is in a similar position. In a num-
 ber of states in the U.S.A., Negroes cannot participate in
 elections because of an educational qualification; to ac-
 quire the right to vote, people there must be able to read,
 write and speak English. In other states of the Union
 electoral laws forbid assistance to illiterates in filling
 ballot papers, with the result that "illiterate" Negroes
 are virtually excluded from participation in elections.
 A big section of the youth in many bourgeois coun-
 tries is barred from participation in elections because of
 the high age qualification. In Britain, the U.S.A. and
 France electoral rights are not granted before the age of
 21, in Turkey 22, in Sweden 23, in Holland 25, and in
 Afghanistan 28.
 This being the case, all talk about universal suffrage
 is so much deceit and hypocrisy.
 Question 8. What does equal suffrage mean?
 Answer. Equal suffrage means that at elections every
 voter is entitled to one vote equal to that of any other vot-
 er, that all citizens participate in elections on an equal
 footing and that, hence, no voter has special privileges.
 Under Article 122 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
 women have equal rights with men in all spheres of eco-
 nomic, state, cultural and socio-political activity. In ac-
 cordance with Article 136 of the Constitution elections of
 deputies are equal, which means that each citizen has
 one vote and all citizens participate in the elections on
 an equal footing. Article 137 of the Constitution specifies
 that women possess the right to elect and be elected on
 equal terms with men.
 Under Article 138 citizens serving in the Armed
 Forces of the U.S.S.R. have the right to elect and be elect-
 ed to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. on equal terms
 with all other citizens.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Equal suffrage is proclaimed by some bourgeois con-
 stitutions too, but in actual practice it does not exist in
 capitalist countries.
 In recent years, knowing that elections even on mild-
 ly democratic lines would spell defeat for them, the ruling
 circles in a number of capitalist countries have rushed
 reactionary electoral laws through the parliaments of
 their respective countries. In France, for instance, a new
 electoral law passed in 1951 provides that blocs of any
 parties contesting the elections shall occupy all the seats
 in Parliament from this or that department provided they
 get a simple majority, while the other parties get no
 seats, no matter how many votes they polled. If the dem-
 ocratic principle of proportional representation were
 applied, the other parties would have a corresponding
 number of seats. Small wonder then that, under this elec-
 toral "law" which has nothing in common with a genu-
 inely democratic electoral system, the French Right-wing
 Socialists secured as many seats as the Communist Party
 of France, although they polled only half the vote record-
 ed by the Communists.
 The 1953 elections to the legislature in Italy were
 held under a new law, which the people aptly dubbed the
 "big swindle." This law established a so-called "prize
 for the majority," i.e., a rule providing that the party or
 bloc of parties polling, even by one vote, more than 50 per
 cent of the votes, would get 380 of the 590 seats, or 65 per
 cent of the total. Had Italian reaction succeeded in achiev-
 ing its aim, about four million voters would, in effect,
 have been deprived of the right to send representatives to
 Parliament. The high level of political consciousness and
 activity of the masses prevented Italian reaction from carry-
 ing its plans into effect; it suffered :a heavy defeat. Later,
 in 1954, as a result of mass pressure the law was repealed.
 In the elections held in Western Germany in Septem-
 ber 1953 a fraudulent electoral system operated whereby
 the parties polling less than five per cent of the vote and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 not in any bloc were completely deprived of representa-
 tion in the Bundestag. As a result of this machination the
 German Communist Party was denied representation in
 the Bundestag, although it polled more than 600,000 votes
 which entitled it to at least 12 seats. On the other hand,
 the reactionary catholic "Centre Party" which was in a
 bloc with Adenauer's party, polled only one-third of the
 Communist Party vote and yet was allocated four seats.
 It is worth taking a look at the candidates of the Ade-
 nauer bloc in these elections. Along with tycoons of West
 German capitalism and banking like the "cement" king
 Dyckerhoff, Schacht, Henle, Pferdmenges, and others,
 there were airforce general Stumpf, a war criminal, Hit-
 ler generals and admirals Manteuffel, Heye, and Field
 Marshal Kesselring. Side by side with them on candi-
 dates' lists were such out-and-out Hitlerites as von Dern-
 berg, former departmental head in Ribbentrop's ministry,
 Schmidt, Hitler's personal interpreter, and Meinberg, so-
 called "Fiihrer of the Reich Peasants."
 Such electoral laws are obviously unjust; they are
 aimed against the working masses and serve the inter-
 ests of the ruling reactionary classes in the capitalist
 countries.
 Genuine equality of electoral rights for citizens is
 fully ensured in the Soviet socialist state.
 This equality also finds expression in the procedure
 for forming the Supreme Soviet election districts.
 Election districts or constituencies have been formed
 for the Soviet of the Union, each district comprising
 300,000 people. Under the Soviet electoral law all the So-
 viet of the Union election districts are equal, each elect-
 ing only one deputy.
 Equal suffrage in electing deputies to the Soviet of
 Nationalities is guaranteed by the fact that the Union
 Republics elect 25 deputies each, the Autonomous Re-
 publics 11, the Autonomous Regions 5, and the National
 Areas one deputy each.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 In conformity with this the territory of each Union
 Republic is divided into twenty-five districts equal in pop-
 ulation; the territory of each Autonomous Republic, into
 eleven districts, also equal in population, and the territory
 of each Autonomous Region, into five equal districts;
 each National Area constitutes one election district re-
 gardless of population. The Soviet of Nationalities elec-
 tion districts, too, elect one deputy each.
 The system of elections to the Soviet of Nationalities
 established by the Constitution and the Election Regu-
 lations is fully in keeping with the great principles of the
 Lenin-Stalin national policy which has ensured power-
 ful economic, political, and cultural progress for all
 the numerous nationalities of the U.S.S.R., united in a
 single multi-national socialist state of workers and
 peasants.
 In some capitalist countries unequal election districts
 are formed, with the result that in political terms the spe-
 cific weight of the voter in one constituency often turns
 out to be less than that of a voter in another constituency.
 In Britain the inequality of constituencies was also
 retained at the 1950 elections. The electorate in the
 Sutherland constituency, for instance, nt mbered 25.887,
 while the Leyton and Dartmouth constituencies num-
 bered 78,491 and 79,085 respectively. This system gives
 preponderance to backward rural districts at the expense
 of the more progressive industrial centres.
 In capitalist countries the democratic principle of
 equal suffrage is grossly violated by the requirement that
 a deposit be advanced for each candidate, which is ex-
 tremely embarrassing to the needy voters. Such an elec-
 toral system is clearly incompatible with the interests of
 the vast democratic sections of the population.
 As for the Soviet electoral system, it guarantees vot-
 ers real equality and genuinely equal suffrage.
 In the U.S.S.R. the voters enjoy equal rights irrespec-
 tive of social origin, property status or occupation. Work-

 ers, peasants and intellectuals participate in elections on
 an equal footing.
 The equal suffrage effected in the Soviet Union is
 proof of the consistent development of Soviet democracy.
 Question 9. What does direct suffrage signify?
 Answer. The Soviet Constitution (Article 139) has es-
 tablished direct suffrage, that is, an electoral procedure
 according to which deputies to all organs of state power,
 including the Supreme Soviet, are elected by all citizens
 directly.
 Prior to the adoption of the 1936 Constitution, only
 town and village Soviets were elected by direct vote.
 The higher organs of Soviet power were elected at the
 appropriate congresses of Soviets. The working people
 elected delegates to the district congresses of Soviets.
 These congresses elected delegates to the regional, terri-
 torial and republican (in republics where there was no
 regional division) congresses, which in their turn elected
 delegates to the congresses of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. In
 the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and in
 the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic delegates to re-
 publican congresses were elected at the regional (terri-
 torial) congresses of Soviets. The Central Executive
 Committee of the U.S.S.R. and the Central Executive
 Committees of the Union Republics were elected at the
 Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. and at the Republican
 congresses of Soviets respectively. As a result, the Dis-
 trict Executive Committees were elected by a two-stage
 system, the Territorial and Regional Executive Commit-
 tees as well as the leading organs of the Autonomous Re-
 publics and the Central Executive Committees of the
 Union Republics in which there were regions, by a three-
 stage system, and the Central Executive Committee of the
 U.S.S.R. by a four-stage system.
 In the past this system was necessary and it complete-
 ly justified itself. It was conditioned by the state of the
 Soviet economy at the time, the nature of the bonds be-

 tween town and country, the cultural level of the popula-
 tion and the degree of activity of the masses. It is well
 known that during the Civil War and for a number of
 years afterwards the economic, cultural and socio-politi-
 cal situation in the country made it difficult to replace
 indirect elections by direct elections.
 Speaking about the advantages of introducing direct
 elections, Comrade Molotov said:
 "Direct elections will further enhance the prestige of
 the organs of Soviet power and reinforce the ties between
 these organs and the broad masses of the working people.
 The workers and peasants will have a better knowledge
 of their representatives not only in the districts and re-
 gions, but in the central organs of the Soviet state; they
 will be linked more directly with them, and, !as ia result,
 the entire work of the leading organs of Soviet power will
 be further improved."*
 Question 10. What is implied by the secret ballot?
 Answer. The secret ballot, established by Article 140
 of the Constitution, is a procedure in which balloting is
 not done, for instance, by show of hands in the presence
 of other voters, as is the case with the open ballot, but by
 filling ballot papers in a booth where the presence of oth-
 ers, including members of the ward election commission,
 is forbidden. This procedure guarantees the electorate
 complete freedom of expression of will. In these condi-
 tions the voter feels perfectly independent, since no one
 knows, or can know, for whom he casts his vote.
 On the other hand, the secret ballot, being a power-
 ful means of control on the part of the electorate, makes
 the deputy have more respect for public opinion, work
 better, and attend still more conscientiously to his busi-
 ness, to his duties in relation to the state.

 In the countries of bourgeois parliamentary democra-
 cy there is no genuinely secret ballot, although nominally
 it has been instituted there. The system of bribery, open
 trading in votes and downright terror against the electo-
 rate grossly violate the secrecy of balloting. The very
 method of holding elections contributes to this. In many
 countries the holding of elections is entrusted to officials.
 of the Ministry of the Interior and the police. The Ade-
 nauer government, for instance, mobilized 100,000 police-
 men during the elections held in September 1953, ac-
 cording to press reports, for the purpose of ensuring the
 success of the elections, to say nothing of the numerous
 terrorist fascist gangs hired for the same purpose.
 The replacement of the open ballot by the secret bal-
 lot vividly illustrated, as V. M. Molotov pointed out, the
 desire of the Soviet authorities to place the work of their
 organs under increased supervision by the workers and
 peasants.
 The Election Regulations set forth rules the observ-
 ance of which guarantees complete secrecy of balloting.
 Chapter II
 Question 11. What is meant by voters' lists referred
 to in Chapter II of the Election Regula-
 tions?
 Answer. The voters' list (register) is a most important
 electoral document authorizing the issue of ballot papers
 to the electorate. Receipt of the ballot paper enables the
 elector to participate in voting. But before he receives it he
 must be entered in the list of voters in his election ward.
 Articles 15 and 17 of the Election Regulations provide
 that the voters' register shall be drawn up in each elec-
 tion ward in the form established by the Presidium of the

 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. In towns the registers are
 compiled by the Executive Committees of urban Soviets
 of Working People's Deputies, in cities divided into dis-
 tricts, by the Executive Committees of the district Soviets,
 in smaller towns, by the Executive Committees of the
 town Soviets, and in rural localities, by the Executive
 Committees of rural (stanitsa, village, hamlet, kishlak,
 aul) Soviets of Working People's Deputies.
 Question 12. Who are entered in the voters' register?
 Answer. Since elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R. are held on the basis of universal suffrage, the
 voters' lists include all citizens who have reached the age
 of 18 by election day, who enjoy electoral rights and re-
 side (permanently or temporarily) in the territory of the
 given Soviet at the time of compilation of the lists.
 With regard to electors who have reached the age of
 18 by election day, it is required that the year, month and
 date of birth be registered in the list of voters. If the So-
 viet of Working People's Deputies lacks exact informa-
 tion concerning the month and date of birth of such an
 elector, it is assumed that he was born on January 1 of
 the year in question.
 Persons deprived of electoral rights by court of law
 are not entered in the lists of voters for the period of depri-
 vation of electoral rights specified in the sentence; nor
 shall the voters' lists include persons certified insane in
 the manner prescribed by law.
 Question 13. What identification papers are required
 for the citizens to be included in the vot-
 ers' register by the Executive Commit-
 tees of Soviets?
 Answer. The Executive Committees of Soviets may
 not demand from citizens any papers for the purpose of
 putting their names on the voters' register. It is the duty
 of the Executive Committee,; themselves to compile these
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 registers. In towns, for instance, lists of voters are com-
 piled in conformity with the records in house-registers,
 and in rural localities, in conformity with farmstead reg-
 isters, or with the lists of temporary residents.
 Question 14. What guides the Executive Committees
 of Soviets of Working People's Depu-
 ties in deciding that persons deprived
 of electoral rights, or certified insane,
 shall not be entered in the lists of
 voters?
 Answer. Regarding persons deprived of electoral
 rights by court of law, the Executive Committees of So-
 viets shall be guided by absolutely reliable and carefully
 checked evidence, such as copy of the sentence or an of-
 ficial announcement by organs of the Procurator's Office
 or courts of law. Statements in this respect by private in-
 dividuals are not sufficient in themselves.
 In regard to insane persons the Executive Committees
 shall be guided either by the certificate issued by court of
 law on the basis of an pact by judicial and psychiatric
 experts, or by official notifications of medical establish-
 ments (asylums, special medical commissions), acting on
 special powers vested in them by the law.
 Question 15. Should citizens sentenced by court of
 law to a penalty that does not involve
 either imprisonment or deprivation of
 electoral rights be included in lists of
 voters?
 Answer. Such citizens are included in lists of voters.
 The lists should not include citizens convicted by court
 without deprivation of electoral rights, if they are under
 arrest, since in such circumstances they are unable to
 participate in elections.
 Besides, voters' lists do not include persons under
 judicial examination and therefore held under arrest.

 Question 16. How and where are nomads (e.g., Gip-
 sies) included in voters' lists?
 Answer. They are included in voters' lists on an equal
 footing with all other citizens by the Executive Committees
 of the Soviets of Working People's Deputies in whose ter-
 ritory they are camped at the time of compilation of the
 lists.
 Question 17. Can a citizen be entered in more than
 one voters' register?
 Answer. No. The Election Regulations (Article 13)
 establish that no voter can be entered in more than one
 list of voters, otherwise the principle of equal suffrage
 would be violated.
 Question 18. How are voters' lists compiled in mili-
 tary units or military formations? In
 what voters' lists are all the other per-
 sons on military service included?
 Answer. Lists of voters in military units and military
 formations are drawn up by the command and signed by
 the commander.
 All other persons on military service are entered in
 voters' lists according to place of residence by the Exec-
 utive Committees of the appropriate local Soviets, and
 they vote, too, according to place of residence.
 Question 19. Do persons serving in military units and
 military formations of the Soviet Army
 and Navy beyond the Soviet frontiers
 participate in elections to the Supreme
 Soviet of the tl.S.S.R.?
 Attsz;.cer. Yes, they do. By a decree dated October 14,
 1945, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 settled this matter guided by Article 138 of the Constitu-
 tion which establishes that citizens serving in the Soviet
 Army have the right to elect and be elected on equal terms
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 with all other Soviet citizens. They vote in special election
 districts. The rate of representation for the troops is one
 deputy in each of the two Chambers of the Supreme So-
 viet of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet of the Union and the So-
 viet of Nationalities, for each special district.
 Question 20. What facilities are at the disposal of
 electors for  inspecting  voters'  reg-
 isters?
 Answer. The Regulations bind the Executive Com-
 mittees of Soviets of Working People's Deputies to exhib-
 it voters' lists for public inspection thirty days prior to
 elections or to enable electors to acquaint themselves
 with the lists on the premises either of the Soviet or the
 election ward.
 Question 21. What is the significance of providing
 citizens with facilities for prior inspec-
 tion of the voters' lists?
 Answer. Prior examination of voters' lists is of great
 importance since it makes it possible timely detection and
 correction of errors (non-inclusion in the list of citizens
 possessing electoral rights, inclusion of persons deprived
 of electoral rights, distortion of surname, given name or
 patronymic, etc.).
 Question 22. What is the procedure for correcting
 voters' lists?
 Answer. To have any inaccuracy in the lists correct-
 ed-inaccuracies such as non-inclusion or exclusion from
 the lists, distortion of surname, given name or patronym-
 ic, incorrect inclusion of persons deprived of electoral
 rights, etc., the citizen must submit an appropriate appli-
 cation to the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Work-
 ing People's Deputies which published the list. It is the
 duty of that body to consider the matter within three
 days.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Any citizen may submit such a claim to the Executive
 Committee of a Soviet either directly or through the ward
 election commission.
 Question 23. Is it permissible to appeal against a de-
 cision taken by the Executive Committee
 of the Soviet concerning corrections in
 voters' lists?
 Answer. Yes, appeal can be made. To do this the citi-
 zen must submit his complaint to a People's Court. The
 court is obliged to examine the complaint in open session
 within three days in the presence of the claimant and a
 representative of the Executive Committee of the Soviet
 in question and immediately announce its decision both
 to the Executive Committee of the Soviet and to the claim-
 ant.
 The decision of a People's Court is final and is not
 subject to appeal.
 The foregoing shows that the procedure of compiling
 voters' lists in the Soviet Union is simple and democrat-
 ic in the highest degree and fully guarantees the cor-
 rection of possible mistakes.
 Question 24. How do voters who have changed their
 place of residence after publication of
 voters' lists participate in elections?
 Answer. A voter who has changed his place  of
 residence in the interval between the date of publication
 of voters' lists and election day, can be included in the
 register at his new place of residence.
 For this he must obtain from the Executive Committee
 of the appropriate Soviet of Working People's Deputies
 the "Voting Right Certificate" established by the Presid-
 ium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. He then
 submits this certificate, together with his identification
 papers, to the Executive Committee of the Soviet at his
 new place of residence-permanent or temporary-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 whereupon he is entered in the voters' list and so partic-
 ipates in tl e elections in the ordinary way.
 Question 25. What is the voting procedure for elec-
 tors who arrive at a new place of resi-
 dence on polling day?
 Answer. An elector who arrives at a new place of
 residence on polling day may go to any election ward
 where, upon presentation of the "Voting Right Certifi-
 cate" and identification papers, he will be entered in the
 voters' list, receive ballot papers and vote on equal foot-
 ing with the other electors.
 Chapter III
 SOVIET OF THE UNION AND SOVIET
 OF NATIONALITIES
 ELECTION DISTRICTS
 Question 26. On what principle are the election
 districts for the Soviet of the Union
 formed?
 Answer. The election districts for the Soviet of the
 Union are formed on the following principle: the entire
 territory of the U.S.S.R. is divided into election districts
 of 300,000 inhabitants per district.
 Hence, there are as many election districts in the
 U.S.S.R. as obtain from division of the total population
 by 300,000. For the 1954 elections to the Soviet of the
 Union there were 700 election districts.
 Question 27. How are the election districts for the
 Soviet of Nationalities formed?
 Answer. Twenty-five election  districts  have  been
 formed in each Union Republic. Since there are sixteen
 Union Republics in the U.S.S.R., 400 districts were formed
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 for the 1954 elections. There are 11 districts in each
 Autonomous Republic-'a total of 176 for the 16 Auton-
 omous Republics. The nine Autonomous Regions have
 five election districts each or 45 altogether. The ten Na-
 tional Areas have one election district each. The total
 number of the Soviet of Nationalities election districts
 in 1954 was 631.
 In all, 1,331 election districts were formed for the 1954
 elections to the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, not counting
 the special election districts formed in military units and
 military formations of the Soviet Army and Navy beyond
 Soviet territory.
 Question 28. How many deputies are elected to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. Since each election district elects but one
 deputy, the total number of the Supreme Soviet deputies
 is 1,331, besides, a certain number is elected by voters
 serving in military units and military formations of the
 Soviet Army  and Navy  beyond the Soviet Union's
 frontiers.
 Chapter IV
 Question 29. What is the election ward and for what
 purpose is it set up?
 Answer. The election ward is formed for the purpose
 of polling ballots and counting the votes. To this end
 every city and district forming part of an election dis-
 trict or constituency is divided into wards common for
 elections to the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of
 Nationalities.
 The break-down of election districts into election
 wards comprising a small number of inhabitants, and
 situated as close as possible to the voter's place of rest
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 deuce, makes the holding of elections in the district much
 easier.
 If the voters of a whole district had to vote in one
 place, both polling and the counting of votes would be
 exceedingly difficult and would require much more time,
 whereas, according to the Regulations, elections to the
 Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. must be held in the course
 of one day.
 Plainly it is much more convenient and rational to
 poll ballots and count the votes according to small wards
 rather than in one large election district.
 Question 30. Who is empowered by law to set up
 election wards?
 Answer. In cities divided into districts the duty of
 setting up election wards is assigned to the Executive
 Committees of the district Soviets of Working People's
 Deputies, and in towns with no such division, to the
 Executive Committees of the town Soviets; in rural local-
 ities the task falls to the Executive Committees of the
 district or uyezd Soviets of Working People's Deputies.
 Question 31. On what principle  are the  election
 wards formed?
 Answer. In towns, industrial centres, villages and
 rural localities with more than 2,000 inhabitants, election
 wards are formed so that each ward comprises from
 1,500 to 3,000 inhabitants.
 As a rule, the territory of a rural Soviet with not
 more than 2,000 inhabitants constitutes a single election
 ward; each stanitsa, village, kishlak, and aul with 500
 or more inhabitants, but not in excess of 2,000, consti-
 tutes a separate election ward.
 In villages or groups of villages with about 500 in-
 habitants, but not less than 300, separate election wards
 may be set up, if the distance from these villages to the
 election ward centre exceeds ten kilometres.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 In remote northern and eastern regions, where small
 communities prevail, it is permissible to form election
 wards of not less than 100 inhabitants.
 As for the National Areas in the North as well as in
 mountainous and nomadic regions, the Election Regula-
 tions permit the forming of election wards there, even
 if the population is below 100, provided, however, that
 it is not below 50.
 Military units and military formations  constitute
 separate election wards of not less than 50 and not more
 than 3,000 voters.
 Question 32. What facilities are there for voters in
 hospitals, maternity homes, sanatoria
 and invalid homes to participate in
 elections?
 Answer. In all medical establishments and invalid
 homes too, with not less than 50 electors, separate elec-
 tion wards are formed. In hospitals of several buildings
 election wards may be set up in each building, provided
 it houses not less than 50 voters.
 As regards voters who, while not in hospitals, are
 unable to reach the election ward because of illness, it
 is the duty of the members of the ward commission or of
 specially authorized persons to visit the voter's home
 upon request where the ballot paper is filled in and
 placed in a miniature ballot box.
 Question 33. How do voters on board ship on election
 day participate in elections?
 Answer. Vessels under sail on election day, and with
 not less than 25 voters on board, may constitute separate
 election wards, to be included in the election district of
 the port of registry.
 Question 34. What about citizens travelling in long-
 distance trains on election day, how do
 they participate in elections?
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Answer. In long-distance trains that are under way
 on election day, wards are arranged so that voters hold-
 ing "Voting Right Certificates" can poli their ballot
 papers. Train election wards are registered either in the
 districts where the respective trains were marshalled, or
 in the districts whose territory they cross on election day.
 In the light of the foregoing it is clear that the Soviet
 principle of forming election wards ensures maximum
 attendance by voters, and, by removing every hindrance
 and difficulty in the way the elector exercises his rights,
 makes the voting for the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 genuinely universal. Every point in the Election Regula-
 tions reflects the broad popular democratism of the
 Soviet electoral system. Small wonder, therefore, that as
 a rule the overwhelming majority of the electorate goes
 to the polls in the Soviet Union.
 Chapter V
 ELECTION COMMISSIONS
 Question 35. What election commissions function for
 elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. The following election commissions are set
 up for the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet elections:
 1) The Central Election Commission for the elections
 to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.; 2) Soviet of
 Nationalities Election Commissions for the Union Repub-
 lics, Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Regions and
 National Areas; 3) District Soviet of the Union Election
 Commissions; 4) District Soviet of Nationalities Elec-
 tion Commissions; 5) Ward Election Commissions.
 Question 36. How  are  the  election  commissions
 formed?

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Answer. The election commissions consist of repre-
 sentatives from trade-union organizations of workers
 other employees, co-operative bodies, Communist
 and
 Party and youth organizations, cultural, technical and
 scientific societies, and other legally registered public
 organizations and societies of the working people, as
 well as representatives elected at meetings of workers
 and other employees in enterprises and servicemen in
 army and naval units, and at meetings of peasants on
 collective farms, in villages and volosts, and of workers
 and other employees on state farms.
 Question 37. What is the composition of the Central
 Election Commission and what are its
 functions?
 Answer. The Central Election Commission is com-
 posed of a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and 24
 members. It is endorsed by the Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. not later than fifty days prior to
 the date fixed for the elections.
 The Central Election Commission:
 a) Sees that the "Regulations Governing Elections to
 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R." are strictly observed
 throughout the Soviet Union;
 b) Deals with complaints concerning irregularities
 on the part of election commissions and takes final deci-
 sions on the complaints;
 c) Establishes the models of ballot boxes, the form
 and colour of ballot papers, the form of the official records
 of registration of candidates by the district election
 commissions, the form of the official records of the count,
 the form of the certificates of election, and the design of
 seals for the election commissions;
 d) Registers the deputies elected to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R.;
 e) Turns over the election files and records to the

 Credentials Commissions of the Soviet of the Union and
 of the Soviet of Nationalities.
 Question 38. What is the composition of the Soviet
 of Nationalities election commissions
 and what are their functions?
 Answer. The Soviet of Nationalities election commis-
 sions of the Union Republics, Autonomous Republics,
 Autonomous Regions and National Areas consist of a
 chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and from ten to six-
 teen members and are confirmed by the Presidium of the
 Supreme Soviet of the Union and Autonomous Republics
 or by the Executive Committees of the Soviets of Work-
 ing  People's  Deputies of Autonomous Regions  and
 National Areas not later than fifty days prior to election
 day. These election commissions see that the "Regula-
 tions Governing Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the
 U.S.S.R." are strictly adhered to in the course of the
 elections; they also deal with complaints of irregularities
 on the part of Soviet of Nationalities election commis-
 sions.
 Question 39. What  is the composition of district
 Soviet of the Union election commis-
 sions and of district Soviet of National-
 ities election commissions?
 Answer. District Soviet of the Union and district
 Soviet of Nationalities election commissions are com-
 posed of a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and eight
 members, and are endorsed in accordance with Articles
 45 and 49 of the Election Regulations not later than
 fifty days prior to the polling day.
 Question 40. What are the functions of the district
 election commissions?
 Answer. District Soviet of the Union and district

 Chapter VI
 PROCEDURE FOR NOMINATING CANDIDATES
 TO THE SUPREME SOVIET
 OF THE U.S.S.R.
 Question 44. How are candidates to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. nominated?
 Answer. In accordance with Article 141 of the Consti-
 tution of the U.S.S.R. the Election Regulations establish
 that the right to nominate candidates to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is ensured to public organizations
 and societies of the working people, namely, Communist
 Party organizations, trade unions, co-operatives, youth
 organizations, and cultural societies.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 The right to nominate candidates is exercised by the
 central bodies of public organizations and societies of the
 working people and by their republican, territorial,
 regional, uyezd and district bodies, as well as by general
 meetings of workers and other employees in enterprises,
 and of servicemen in army and naval units, and also by
 general meetings of peasants on collective farms, and of
 state farm workers and other employees on state farms.
 In conformity with Article 126 of the Constitution, all
 citizens of the U.S.S.R. may, regardless of occupation,
 unite in various public organizations: trade unions, co-
 operative associations, youth and sports organizations,
 cultural, technical and scientific societies; and the most
 active and politically-conscious citizens in the ranks of
 the working class and other sections of the working
 people may unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet
 Union, which is the vanguard of the working people in
 their struggle for building communist society, and the
 leading core of all organizations of the working people,
 both public and state.
 It is clear that this procedure, which provides Soviet
 citizens with the greatest opportunity of participating in
 the nomination of candidates to the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. is genuinely democratic.
 Question 45. Who may be nominated as candidate to
 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.?
 Answer. Under the Soviet electoral law any citizen
 who has reached the age of twenty-three and enjoys
 electoral rights is eligible for election to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 This law does not make any special claims on candi-
 dates to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 The situation is quite different in bourgeois countries.
 In Britain, for example, each candidate must deposit
 150 pounds, in Canada 300 dollars, and in Japan 2,000
 yen. Moreover, in the event of the candidate not polling
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 a definite minimum of votes, this deposit is confiscated
 for the benefit of the state. In some countries candidates
 meet the expenditure in acquiring ballot papers.
 Nothing like this exists in the Soviet Union where
 there are no "election deposits" or payment of election
 expenditure by candidates.
 According to Article 11 of the Election Regulations
 all the expenditure incurred in elections to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is borne by the state.
 Candidates to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 are nominated by the people themselves, who proceed
 solely from the personal ability of the citizens concerned,
 from the quality of their work, and from their devo-
 tion to the people and country.
 Question 46. How are the candidates to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. nominated and
 registered?
 Answer. According to the Election Regulations public
 organizations or societies of the working people nominat-
 ing candidates for the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.
 must submit to the district election commissions the
 following documents indicated in Article 61 of the Elec-
 tion Regulations: first, the minutes of the meeting at
 which the candidate was nominated; second, a declara-
 tion by the candidate of his consent to stand for election
 in the given election district on behalf of the organiza-
 tion which nominated him.
 The minutes must state the surname, given name and
 patronymic of the candidate, his age, address, party
 affiliation and occupation. Besides, they must state the
 time and place of the meeting and the number of persons
 present:
 The minutes must be signed by the members of the
 presidium of the meeting, and stating their addresses
 and the name of the organization nominating the candi-
 date.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Not later than thirty days prior to the (late of elec-
 tions the candidates must by registered by the district
 election commission for the Soviet of the Union or by
 the district election commission for the Soviet of Nation-
 alities, depending on which body the candidate in ques-
 tion is nominated for.
 Not later than twenty-five days prior to the date of
 elections, the respective district election commission
 publishes after registration the surname, given name,
 patronymic, age, occupation and party affiliation of the
 given candidate and the name of the public organiza-
 tion nominating him. Thereafter the registered candi-
 dates.are entered in the ballot paper.
 If it is established at the time of registration that
 some requirement or other put forward to a candidate
 by the Regulations has not been complied with, the
 district election commission is entitled to refuse regis-
 tration of the candidate. In that case the candidate is
 not included in the ballot paper.
 Question 47. Is it permissible to appeal against the
 refusal of a district election commission
 to register a candidate?
 Answer. Yes, it is. The Election Regulations point out
 that the refusal of a district Soviet of the Union election
 commission or a district Soviet of Nationalities election
 commission to register a candidate may be appealed
 against within a period of two days.
 Question 48. With what  body is the refusal of a
 district election commission to register
 a candidate for the U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet appealed against?
 Answer. Appeal against refusal of a district Soviet
 of the Union election commission to register a candidate
 is lodged with the Central Election Commission.
 Appeal against refusal of a district Soviet of Nation-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 alities election commission to register a candidate is
 lodged with the respective election commission of the
 Union or Autonomous Republic, Autonomous Region or
 National Area, and appeal against the decision of this
 body is lodged with the Central Election Commission.
 The decision of the Central Election Commission is
 final and is not subject to appeal.
 Question 49. Is it permissible to nominate one can-
 didate in several districts?
 Answer. Yes, this can be done. No matter where a
 candidate lives and regardless of whether he has already
 been nominated in one district, he may be nominated by
 electors in any other district. But the Election Regula-
 tions provide that a candidate for the Supreme Soviet
 of the U.S.S.R. may stand for election only in one dis-
 trict. The candidate must declare his consent to stand
 for election in the given district on behalf of the organi-
 zation nominating him.
 Only those candidates are balloted who have been
 nominated, according to Article 141 of the Constitution
 of the U.S.S.R., by public organizations and societies of
 the working people and registered with the district elec-
 tion commissions in proper time.
 Question 50. What is the ballot paper?
 Answer. The ballot paper is a sheet printed in the
 form prescribed by the Central Election Commission. It
 indicates the name and number of the election district,
 the surname, given name and patronymic of candidates
 for the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., as well as an
 enumeration of the organizations nominating the candi-
 dates.
 The ballot papers must be printed in the language of
 the inhabitants of the election district in question. If in
 that district there are groups of inhabitants speaking
 different languages, the ballot papers must be printed
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 in the respective languages and in quantities sufficient
 to supply all the voters with ballot papers in their
 native languages.
 Question 51. When and where do electors receive
 the ballot papers?
 Answer. The ballot papers must be printed by the
 district Soviet of the Union election commissions and
 the district Soviet of Nationalities election commissions
 not later than fifteen days prior to the date of the elections
 and then distributed to all the ward election commissions
 which issue them to the voters on polling day.
 Chapter VII
 VOTING PROCEDURE
 Question 52. Are elections to the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. held on one day or are
 they spread over a number of days?
 Answer. The Election Regulations provide that elec-
 tions to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. shall be
 held in the course of one day, which shall be the same
 throughout the U.S.S.R. The elections are held on a
 Sunday, otherwise part of the electorate would be unable
 to participate in voting.
 In some bourgeois countries, on the contrary, elec-
 tions are held on week days, with a view to preventing
 working people from participating in elections.
 Question 53. Where does polling take place?
 Answer. Polling takes place on premises specially
 set aside for the purpose. Every day, for a period of
 twenty days prior to the elections, the ward election
 commissions publish, or otherwise make generally known
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 to the electors, the place of voting as well as the date of
 the elections.
 Question 54. What are the polling hours?
 Answer. Polling takes place  from 6  a.m.  until
 midnight local time. At 6 a.m. on election day the chair-
 man of each ward election commission examines the
 ballot boxes in the presence of the members of the com-
 mission and ascertains that there is a list of voters com-
 piled in the prescribed form, whereupon he seals the
 boxes with the seal of the commission and invites the
 electors to vote.
 At midnight on election day, the chairman of the
 ward election commission declares polling terminated,
 and the commission proceeds to open the ballot boxes
 and count the votes.
 Question 55. How does polling take place?
 Answer. Every elector votes personally at the polling
 station. There he presents to the secretary or any other
 authorized member of the ward election commission his
 passport, or collective-farm or trade-union membership
 card, or some other evidence of identity. After his name
 is checked in the voters' list and an entry made in the
 list, recording the issue of ballot papers, he is given
 ballot papers of the prescribed form.
 He then proceeds to a special room, a booth, to fill in
 the ballots. There, in the absence of members of the ward
 election commission or any other persons, he leaves the
 name of the candidate he votes for and crosses out the
 names of the others. Thence he proceeds to the room
 where the ward election commission is located and drops
 his ballot papers into the ballot box.
 Question 56. Can a number of electors be simul-
 taneously admitted to the room set
 aside for filling in the ballot papers?
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Answer. Yes. In this case, to ensure the secrecy of
 balloting, the law requires that the room set aside for
 filling ballot papers be fitted with partitions or screens
 and divided into booths according to the number of vot-
 ers admitted simultaneously, so that one elector may not
 see what is done by the other.
 Question 57. How do illiterates vote?
 Answer. The law provides illiterates with  every
 opportunity to participate in voting. An illiterate voter
 is entitled to invite any other voter to enter the room set
 aside for filling ballot papers and help him to fill his
 ballot papers.
 Question 58. What is the method of voting for in-
 valids or persons unable owing to phys-
 ical disability to fill the ballot papers
 themselves?
 Answer. For this category of voters, as is the case
 with illiterates, the law provides the necessary voting
 conditions by permitting them to invite any other voter
 into the room assigned for filling ballot papers so as to
 fill their ballot papers with that person's help.
 Question 59. Is electioneering work permitted during
 the hours of voting?
 Answer. The Election Regulations say that every
 organization nominating a candidate registered with a
 district election commission, in the same way as every
 citizen of the U.S.S.R., is ensured the right freely to can-
 vass in favour of that candidate at meetings, through
 the press, and in other ways.
 Electioneering is forbidden only at the polling sta-
 tions on polling day. This is done so that no one shall
 exercise  any influence on  electors  at  the time of
 voting.

 Chapter VIII
 COUNTING THE VOTES
 Question 60. How does the ward election commis-
 sions conduct the count?
 Answer. The Election Regulations contain the follow-
 ing rules: at midnight local time on election day, the
 chairman of the ward election commission declares
 polling terminated, and the commission proceeds to open
 the ballot boxes. The right to attend the counting of
 votes on the premises of the election ward is extended
 to representatives of public organizations and societies
 of the working people, specially authorized for the pur-
 pose, and to representatives of the press. Having opened
 the ballot boxes, the ward election commission checks
 the number of ballots cast with the number of persons
 who received them and enters the result in an official
 record. When the ballot papers have been checked, the
 chairman announces in the presence of all the members
 of the commission the results of the vote cast by each
 ballot paper. The votes cast are counted separately for
 the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities.
 When the counting of the votes cast for each candi-
 date is completed, the commission draws up official
 records in the prescribed form and announces the results
 in the presence of all its members, i.e., informs them of
 the total number of votes cast for each candidate.
 These official records are signed by all the members
 of the ward election commission, the signatures of the
 chairman and the secretary being indispensable.
 Question 61. Can a ward election commission declare
 ballot papers invalid?
 Answer. Yes, it can do so if the ballot papers contain
 the names of more candidates than the number of depu-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 ties to he elected, and also if the papers are not printed
 in the prescribed form.
 Question 62. W'hy are such ballot papers declared
 invalid?
 Answer. If a ballot paper contains the names of
 several candidates and a voter leaves the names of, say,
 two of them, it will not be clear to the election commis-
 sion which of the two candidates the voter wants to
 elect. Such a ballot paper will be declared invalid. Every
 voter must, therefore, choose one candidate from those
 whose names are entered in the ballot paper, i.e., leave
 only that candidate's name, striking out the other names.
 Ballot papers not made out in the prescribed form
 are declared invalid for the simple reason that the poll-
 ing of such ballot papers may entail various abuses,
 and also because the secrecy of the ballot may be vio-
 lated; such papers make it possible to reveal the identity
 of the voter and by the same token to establish for whom
 the elector in question voted. Hence, the Central Election
 Commission prescribes a definite form of ballot paper,
 and the Election Regulations establish that ballot pa-
 pers in any other form are null and void.
 Question 63. How do the district election commis-
 sions conduct the count?
 Answer. The district election commissions conduct
 the count on the basis of the official records submitted
 by the ward election commissions and then determine the
 number of votes cast in the election district for each
 candidate. The official records of the vote, drawn tip by
 the district election commission, are signed by all its
 members, the signatures of its chairman and secretary
 being indispensable.
 Question 64. What does the official record of the
 district election commission indicate?
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Answer. The official voting record of the district
 election commission indicates:
 a) The number of ward election commissions in the
 district;
 b) The number of ward election commissions that
 have submitted official records;
 c) The number of electors in the district;
 d) The number of voters who received ballot pa-
 pers;
 e) The number of electors who have voted;
 f) The number of ballot papers declared invalid;
 g) The number of ballot papers in which the names
 of all candidates have been struck out;
 h) The number of votes cast for each candidate;
 i) A brief summary of the claims and complaints
 submitted to the district election commission, and the
 decisions adopted by the district election commission.
 Question 65. How is supervision of the work of
 ward and district election commissions
 ensured?
 Answer. As stated above, the right to be present in
 the room where the votes are counted by the ward elec-
 tion commission is extended to representatives of public
 organizations and societies of the working people, spe-
 cially authorized for the purpose, and to representatives
 of the press.
 Attendance by representatives of the Soviet public
 makes for better supervision by electors of how the mem-
 bers of election commissions observe the rules of counting
 votes and helps preclude any possibility of error and,
 above all, abuses.
 Representatives of public organizations, of the press,
 and of societies of the working people may also attend the
 counting of votes by district election commissions.
 Both ward and district election commissions must
 briefly set forth in their official records the claims and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 complaints submitted and the respective decisions adopt-
 ed by them.
 The official records of the ward election commissions
 are transmitted to the respective district election commis-
 sions; the official records of the district Soviet of the
 Union election commissions are sent to the Central
 Election Commission, while the records of the district
 Soviet of Nationalities election commissions are sent to
 the respective Soviet of Nationalities election commis-
 sion of the Union or Autonomous Republic, Autonomous
 Region or National Area. This enables the higher-level
 election commissions to check the work of the ward and
 district commissions.
 Question 66. Which candidate for the Supreme So-
 viet  of  the  U.S.S.R.  is  considered
 elected?
 Answer. The candidate for the Supreme Soviet of
 the U.S.S.R. is considered elected provided he has polled
 an absolute majority of the votes, or more than half the
 total number of the valid votes cast in tha district.
 Question 67. Is the candidate who polls an absolute
 majority of the votes regarded as being
 elected in any case?
 Answer. No. Should the number of votes cast in a
 district be less than half the number of the electors en-
 titled to vote in the given district, the election will be de-
 clared void. Hence, a candidate polling an absolute
 majority of the votes in such an election is not regarded
 as being elected, since the number of votes cast is less
 than half the number of the electors in the given election
 district.
 In some countries elections are deemed valid even if
 only 30 per cent of the electorate goes to the poll. Accord-
 ing to Soviet law this is impermissible and such prac-
 tices are out of the question.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Question 68. Does the Soviet electoral  law permit
 re-balloting of candidates?
 Answer. Yes, it  does. Re-balloting is conducted if
 none of the candidates in the given election district polls
 an absolute majority of votes, i.e., if each receives less
 than half the number of the votes cast.
 When this occurs, a re-balloting is ordered not of all
 the candidates contesting the district but of the two can-
 didates who received the largest number of votes.
 Question 69. Who orders the re-balloting and what
 is the time-limit for it?
 Answer. Re-balloting is ordered by the district Soviet
 of the Union election commission, or by the district
 Soviet of Nationalities election commission, as the case
 may be, and takes place not later than two weeks after
 the date of the first ballot.
 Question 70. What is to be done if the number of
 votes cast is less than half the number
 of the electors in the given election
 district?
 Answer. If in any district the number of votes cast is
 less than half the number of electors entitled to vote in
 that district, new elections are ordered. In this case the
 district election commission makes a note to that effect
 in the official record and immediately informs the Central
 Election Commission and the Soviet of Nationalities
 election  commission  of the Union  or  Autonomous
 Republic, Autonomous Region or National Area.
 The Central Election Commission orders new elec-
 tions to be held not later than two weeks after the date
 of the first elections.
 Question 71. What is to be done when for one rea-
 son or another a seat in the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. falls vacant?
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Answer. In this case the Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. appoints a date for the election of
 a new deputy for the district concerned, to be held not
 later than two months after the seat in the Supreme
 Soviet falls vacant.
 Re-balloting or new elections are conducted on the
 basis of the lists of voters drawn up for the first elections.
 Question 72. In what way are electoral rights pro-
 tected by law?
 Answer. The Election Regulations contain two arti-
 cles which stipulate that anyone who seeks to prevent
 Soviet citizens from exercising their electoral rights
 shall be severely punished.
 Article 109 of the Election Regulations reads as
 follows: "Any person who by violence, fraud, intimidation
 or bribery hinders a citizen of the U.S.S.R. in the
 exercise of his right to elect and he elected to the Supreme
 Soviet of the U.S.S.R. shall be liable to a term of im-
 prisonment of up to two years."
 And Article 110 of the Election Regulations says:
 "Any official of a Soviet or member of an election com-
 mission guilty of falsifying election documents, or of
 deliberately falsifying the count, shall be liable to a term
 of imprisonment of up to three years."
 Such is the content of the "Regulations Governing
 Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R." which
 guarantee the genuinely universal character of elections.
 The Election Regulations provide all the necessary con-
 ditions for holding elections to the supreme legislative
 body of the U.S.S.R. strictly in keeping with the great
 principles of the Constitution of the land of Soviets,
 which, under the leadership of the Communist Party, is
 stepping out confidently towards communism.

 CHAPTER  ONE
 INTRODUCTION
 COMRADES ! I MUST APOLOGISE. It is quite some
 time since you asked me to give you a talk but I
 have had to delay coming until today. The question I am
 going to talk about is the cultivation of Communist Party
 members.  I think that it may not be unprofitable for
 us to talk about this question at a time when we are
 facing the basic task of building and consolidating the
 Party.  I want to divide my talk into several parts, so
 today I shall deal with one part only, leaving the rest
 for next time.  In order to enable many of the younger
 comrades to understand, I shall have to give more ex-
 planations and examples on certain questions.  Conse-
 quently, I cannot make my talk very succinct. This I
 must make clear at the very beginning.
 Why Must Communist Party Members
 undertake Self-cultivation?
 Comrades, why must Communist Party members
 undertake self-cultivation?

 Ever since man came into the world, in order to be
 able to live, he has had to struggle against nature to
 produce the material values essential to his existence.
 However,
 men carry on a struggle against nature and utilise nature
 for the production of material values not in isolation from
 each other, not as separate individuals, but in common, in
 groups, in societies. Production, therefore, is at all times
 and under all conditions social production.  In the produc-
 tion of material values men enter into mutual relations of
 one kind or another within production, into relations of
 production of one kind or another.  (The History of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B) Short Course,
 English edition, 1951, pp. 188-189)
 Thus, the struggle carried on by men against nature
 for production is social in character.      It is a struggle of
 men as social beings against nature.        It is in this cease-
 less struggle against nature that human beings have
 been continuously changing nature and simultaneously
 themselves and have changed their relations with one
 another.  It is in the course of the long struggle of men
 as social beings against nature, that men's physical forms
 (hands, feet, posture, etc.), their social relations, their
 forms of social organisation as well as their brains,
 ideology, etc. are all continuously being changed and
 improved.  This is because:
 The first feature of production is that it never stays at
 one point for a long time and is always in a state of change
 and development, and that, furthermore, changes in the mode
 of production inevitably call forth changes in the whole
 social system, social ideas, political views and- political
 institutions.  (Ibid pp. 189-190)

 Man has evolved from animals.  In ancient times,
 man's mode of life, social organisation and ideology, etc.
 were different from what they are today.  In the future,
 man's mode of life, social organisation, ideology, etc. will
 also be different from what they are today.
 Humanity itself and human society are a kind of
 process of historical evolution.  They are developing and
 changing and they can be, and have already been, con-
 tinuously changed in the course of struggle.
 When human society developed to a certain historical
 stage, class society arose.  Thereafter, men in a class
 society exist as men of a given class.  According to the
 principles of Marxist philosophy, men's social being
 determines their ideology.   Thus, in a class society men's
 ideology represents the ideology of a given social class.
 In a class society there are ceaseless class struggles. Thus,
 in the course of constant struggle against nature and
 constant struggle of social classes, men change nature,
 change society and at the same time change their own
 ideology.
 Marx once told the workers:
 You will have to go through fifteen, twenty, fifty years
 of civil wars and international conflicts, not only to change
 existing conditions, but also to change yourselves and to
 make yourselves capable of wielding political power.
 In other words, men change themselves not only in
 their struggle against nature but also in constant social
 struggle. The proletariat will also have to consciously go
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 through a long period of social struggle to change society
 and itself.
 Thus, men should regard themselves as being in
 need of, and capable of, being changed.  They should not
 look upon themselves as something unchanging, perfect,
 holy and beyond reform.  It is in no way an insult but
 the inevitable law of natural and social evolution; other-
 wise, men cannot make progress.
 We Communist Party members are the most advanced
 revolutionaries in modern history and are the contempor-
 ary fighting and driving force in changing society and the
 world.  Revolutionaries exist because counter-revolution-
 aries still exist. Therefore, to conduct a ceaseless struggle
 against the counter-revolutionaries constitutes an essen-
 tial condition for the existence and development of the
 revolutionaries.  If they fail to carry on such a struggle,
 they cannot be called revolutionaries and still less can
 they advance and develop.  It is in the course of this
 ceaseless struggle against the counter-revolutionaries that
 Communist Party members change society, change the
 world and at the same time change themselves.
 A Communist Party member changes himself through
 his struggle against counter-revolution in various fields.
 It means that to achieve one's own progress and to raise
 one's revolutionary qualities and technique requires the
 unification of the following two aspects: one's steeling in
 the practical struggle and the cultivation of one's ideas.
 To pass from a novice to a mature and well-experienced
 revolutionary able to cope with any situation calls for a
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 very long process of revolutionary steeling and cultiva-
 tion, that is, a long process of reformation.  A compara-
 tively inexperienced revolutionary is still unable to ac-
 quire a really profound understanding of the enemy, of
 himself, of the laws of social development and the laws
 of the revolution because lie has grown up in the old
 society and naturally has brought with him remnants of
 various ideologies, prejudices and habits of the old society
 and because he is still inexperienced and has not yet
 undergone a long period of revolutionary practice.
 In order to change this situation, besides studying
 revolutionary experiences from history (the practice of
 our predecessors) he must himself participate in the con-
 temporary revolutionary practice.  In this revolutionary
 practice, that is, in the struggle against various counter-
 revolutionary elements, he should develop his subjective
 initiative and redouble his efforts in study and cultiva-
 tion.  Only then will he be able to gradually learn from
 his experience and to understand more profoundly the
 laws of social development and the laws of the revolu-
 tion; be able to understand the enemy and himself; be
 able to discover the incorrectness of his own former ideas,
 habits and prejudices and to correct them; be able to
 raise the level of his consciousness, and his revolutionary
 qualities and improve his revolutionary methods, etc.
 Therefore, in order to change himself and raise the level
 of his consciousness, a revolutionary should not of course
 isolate himself from revolutionary practice, or abandon
 his own subjective efforts to carry on self-cultivation and
 to learn through practice (both his own practice and that
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of others).  Without the latter it will still be impossible
 for a revolutionary to improve himself.
 For example, several Communist Party members go
 together to take part in a certain revolutionary mass
 struggle, undergo almost the same revolutionary practice
 and yet in the end the influence exerted on these Party
 members might be entirely different.  Some may advance
 very quickly and some formerly backward members may
 even overtake others.  Some may advance very slowly.
 Others may even begin to vacillate in the course of the
 struggle,  and  the  revolutionary  practice,  instead  of
 enabling them to advance, has left them behind.       What
 is the cause of all this?
 Again for example, many of our Communist Party
 members took part in the Long March, which was a
 severe test for our Party members and which exercised
 an extremely progressive and positive influence among
 Party members and even among the broad masses of the
 people.  However, in the case of a very small number
 of Party members the influence was just the opposite.
 Having gone through the hard struggle of the Long March
 and the ten years' Civil War, they grew fearful of this
 hard struggle.  They attempted to retreat and run away.
 Finally, they deserted the revolutionary ranks as a result
 of outside inducement.  Many Party members took part
 in the Long March and yet the influence upon them and
 the results thus obtained were vastly different.  What is
 the cause of all this?
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 This is because these Party members possessed dif-
 ferent revolutionary qualities, because they developed in
 different directions in revolutionary practice and because
 they differed in their subjective efforts in revolutionary
 practice, and in their degree and methods of self-cultiva-
 tion.  Because of the different qualities possessed by
 revolutionaries and the variation in their subjective efforts
 and self-cultivation, it is possible that in the same revolu-
 tionary practice,  entirely  different or  even  opposite
 results and influences may ensue.  Such cases can be
 found even in your school. In the school you all receive
 the same kind of education and training. However,
 because of your different qualities, experiences, cultural
 levels, subjective efforts and the degree and methods of
 self-cultivation, you may get different or even opposite
 results.  Have you not noticed that a small number of
 people have moved further away from the revolution after
 receiving education and training in schools in Yenan?
 This is due to the same cause. Hence, for a revolutionary
 to change and improve himself, subjective effort, self-
 cultivation and learning in the course of the revolutionary
 struggle are absolutely necessary and indispensable.
 Not every revolutionary who has undergone the
 steeling of long years of revolutionary struggle can
 develop into a very good and experienced revolutionary,
 chiefly because his own efforts and self-cultivation are
 insufficient.  But all those who have succeeded in be-
 coming very good and experienced revolutionaries must
 certainly have gone through long years of steeling and
 self-cultivation in the revolutionary struggle.  Hence, our
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Party members can make themselves politically inflexible
 revolutionaries of high quality only by steeling themselves,
 strengthening their self-cultivation, not losing their sense
 of the new and by improving their reasoning power in
 the course of the revolutionary struggle of the broad
 masses under all difficulties and hardships.
 Confucius said:
 At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty,
 I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew
 the decree of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient
 organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow
 my heart's desire, without transgressing what was right.
 Here Confucius was relating the process of his steel-
 ing and self-cultivation.  He did not regard himself as
 a born `sage'.
 Mencius said:
 When Heaven is about to confer a great office on any
 man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, and his sinews
 and bones with toil. It exposes his body to hunger, and
 subjects him to extreme poverty. It confounds his under-
 takings. By all these methods it stimulates his mind, hardens
 his nature, and remedies his incompetencies.
 What Mencius said also refers to the process of
 steeling and self-cultivation that a great man must
 undergo.   As  Communist  Party  members  have  to
 shoulder the unprecedentedly `great office' of changing
 the world, it is all the more necessary for them to go
 through such steeling and self-cultivation.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 The cultivation of Communist Party members is a
 revolutionary cultivation.  We cannot carry on our cul-
 tivation                                    by  divorcing  ourselves  from  revolutionary
 practice or the practical revolutionary movement of the
 broad toiling masses, particularly the proletarian masses.
 The aim of our cultivation is solely to serve the interests
 of revolutionary practice and to direct more effectively
 the practical revolutionary movement of the masses.
 Herein lies the difference between our cultivation and
 other idealistic, formal and abstract cultivations which
 are divorced from social practice.  I shall make a further
 brief explanation on this point later on.
 Our Party members should steel themselves and
 intensify their self-cultivation not only in the course of
 arduous, difficult and even unsuccessful revolutionary
 practice but also in the course of favourable, successful
 and victorious revolutionary practice.  Some Party mem-
 bers cannot keep their balance when they are heartened
 by success and victory and become dizzy with victories.
 Victory, success, the tribute paid them by the broad
 masses of the people as well as a certain amount of
 prestige which they enjoy among the masses make them
 unscrupulous, arrogant, bureaucratic or even vacillating,
 corrupt and degenerate, thus completely losing their
 former revolutionary spirit.
 These are individual cases which are frequently
 found among our  Communist Party members.   The
 existence of such phenomena within the Party should
 serve as a serious warning to our Party members for it
 was almost an inevitable rule that such phenomena
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 existed among the revolutionaries of past generations.
 But such phenomena definitely will not be tolerated in
 our Party.  The revolutionaries of past generations, prior
 to the success and victory of the revolution and their
 own success and victory, were able to represent the de-
 mands of the progressive and oppressed masses and retain
 their revolutionary qualities, but as soon as the revolution
 and they themselves were crowned with success and
 victory they would more often than not become corrupt,
 bureaucratic and degenerate, thus losing their revolu-
 tionary qualities and their progressive character and
 becoming obstacles to the revolution and social evolution.
 We know that many revolutionaries in China in the
 past hundred years,  or more  recently  in  the  past
 fifty years, began to show signs of corruption and de-
 generation the moment they had achieved a certain mea-
 sure of success and risen to some responsible position.
 This is due to the class basis of those revolutionaries of
 past generations. Because the revolutionaries of the past
 represented the exploiting classes they naturally turned
 around and oppressed the exploited masses after the
 victory of their revolution and thus became obstacles to
 the continuous progress of the revolution and social evolu-
 tion.  It is an inevitable rule that the revolutionaries of
 the past would become corrupt, bureaucratic and even
 degenerate and lose their revolutionary qualities after the
 victory and success of the revolution.
 However, this cannot and will not be the case with
 us Communists.  As the exploited proletariat which we
 represent does not'exploit anybody, it can carry on the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 revolution to the very end, completely liberate mankind
 as a whole and eventually make a clean sweep of all forms
 of corruption, bureaucracy and degeneracy in human
 society. It can build up a party and State apparatus with
 strict organisation and discipline for the purpose of
 carrying on an irreconcilable struggle against all forms
 of corruption, bureaucracy and degeneracy and to cease-
 lessly purge the Party and the State apparatus of those
 elements who are corrupt, bureaucratic and degenerate
 in their work (no matter what `big-wigs' such elements
 are), so that the purity of the Party and the State
 apparatus can be preserved.
 This outstanding feature of the revolutionary Party
 of the proletariat was not, and could not be, found in any
 of the revolutionary parties of the past.  Therefore, our
 Party members must clearly understand this outstanding
 feature and see to it that even in the course of the success
 and victory of the revolution and*in the course of the
 infinite rise of our popularity and authority special care
 is taken to intensify our self-cultivation and preserve to
 the last our pure revolutionary qualities so as to avoid
 going the way of the revolutionaries of the past who
 became degenerate after they had been crowned with
 success.
 Such revolutionary steeling and cultivation are im-
 portant for every one of our Party members and parti-
 cularly so for those new Party members of non-prolet-
 arian origin.  Why are they particularly important for
 new Party members  of non-proletarian origin?  (1)
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Precisely because such Party members are of non-prolet-
 arian origin.  Lenin said that Party members of worker
 origin have the innate qualities of the proletariat.  It
 follows then that Party members of other class origin
 naturally have the innate qualities of other classes. Al-
 though they have now accepted the Communist ideology,
 they more or less still retain remnants of non-Communist
 ideology and habits.  (2) Precisely because they are new
 Party members and have not yet undergone much steel-
 ing.  Therefore, they have to steel and cultivate them-
 selves in the course of the revolutionary struggle before
 they can become good revolutionaries.
 Steeling and cultivation are important for every
 Party member, whether he be a new member of non-
 proletarian origin or even a veteran member or a member
 of proletarian origin.  This is because our Communist
 Party did not drop from the heavens but was born out of
 Chinese society and because every member of our Party
 came from this squalid old society of China and are still
 living in this society today.  Hence, our Party members
 have more or less brought with them remnants of the
 ideology and habits of the old society and they remain
 in constant association with all the squalid things of the
 old society.  We are still in need of steeling and cultiva-
 tion in every respect for the sake of enhancing and pre-
 serving our purity as the proletarian vanguard and for
 the sake of raising our social qualities and revolutionary
 technique.
 That is the reason why Communist Party members
 must undertake self-cultivation.

 Strive to Become the Best Pupils
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin
 To become a Communist Party member one is only
 required to possess the qualifications as laid down in the
 Party Constitution-namely, any person may become a
 member of the Party who accepts the Programme and
 Constitution of the Party, pays Party membership dues
 and undertakes assigned tasks in one of the Party's
 organisations.  These are the minimum qualifications that
 every  Party    member  must  possess.   Without  these
 qualifications one cannot become a Party member.    But
 every one of our Party members should not merely be a
 member of minimum qualifications, should not merely
 be satisfied with and should not confine himself to these
 minimum qualifications but should rather seek to make
 progress and ceaselessly raise his own consciousness and
 understanding of Marxism-Leninism. This is also a duty
 to the Party and to the revolution, which must not be
 shirked by any member of the Party.  This duty has also
 been included in the new Party Constitution recently
 adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 (B).  However, in order to fulfil this duty satisfactorily
 our Party members must intensify their own steeling and
 cultivation.
 Therefore, the goal of Party members in steeling and
 cultivation should not merely be the standard of minimum
 qualifications but should be the standard of maximum
 qualifications.  At present we find it very difficult to
 define these maximum qualifications.  However, we have
 before us the words and deeds, the achievements and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 qualities of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin throughout
 their lives as our examples and as the criterion of our
 cultivation.  By cultivation is meant raising our own
 qualities in every respect to the same level as those of
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  Let us strive to become
 their best pupils.  In his speech concerning the elections
 to the Supreme Soviet Comrade Stalin said:
 The electors, the people, must demand that their Deputies
 should remain equal to their tasks; that in their work they
 should.not sink to the level of political philistines; that in
 their posts they should remain political figures of the Lenin
 type; that as public figures they should be as clear and
 definite as Lenin was; that they should be as fearless in battle
 and as merciless towards the enemies of the people as Lenin
 was; that they should be free from all panic, from any
 semblance of panic as Lenin was, when things begin to get
 complicated and some danger or other looms on the horizon;
 that they should be as wise and deliberate in deciding com-
 plex problems requiring a comprehensive orientation and a
 comprehensive weighing of all pros and cons as Lenin was;
 that they should be as upright and honest as Lenin was; that
 they should love their people as Lenin did.
 This is a simple description of how to learn from
 Lenin, a picture of Lenin's best pupil.  The cultivation
 of Communist Party members is for the purpose of learn-
 ing from Lenin exactly in such a way in order to be such
 a pupil of Lenin.
 Some say that it is impossible to acquire the great
 qualities of revolutionary geniuses like Marx, Engels,
 Lenin and Stalin and that it is also impossible to raise
 our own qualities to the same level as that of Marx,

 Lenin and Stalin as mysterious beings by birth.  Is it
 correct to say this?  I think not.
 For so long as our comrades genuinely, resolutely,
 consciously and consistently take up their stand as the
 vanguard fighting for the liberation of the proletariat,
 have a truly Communist outlook on life and world out-
 look, and never divorce themselves for a single moment
 from the present-day great and profound revolutionary
 movements of the proletariat and the masses of the peo-
 ple, and make great efforts to learn, and to steel and
 cultivate themselves, they will be perfectly able to raise
 their qualities and become as `clear and definite', as 'fear-
 less in battle and merciless towards the enemies of the
 people', as `free from all panic and from any semblance
 of panic' amidst difficulties and dangers, and as `upright
 and honest' as Lenin was, and to `love the people' as
 Lenin did, and they will also be perfectly.able to employ
 the Marxist-Leninist method and approach in solving t,
 complicated problems, in thinking over the problems from
 all angles and in weighing all pros and cons notwith-
 standing the fact that today our ordinary comrades are
 far from having such great talents, such wide scientific
 knowledge, such an environment and good stamina for
 learning as had Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin and that
 a great many of our comrades cannot expect to achieve
 such profound erudition in the study of the theory of the
 proletarian revolution as did Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin.  In other words, so long as we are determined to
 study hard, and cultivate and steel ourselves, do not

 divorce ourselves from the revolutionary movement of
 the masses of the people, and master the method of
 Marxism-Leninism, we will be perfectly able to raise
 our qualities to the level of those of the statesmen of the
 Lenin type, so that in our work and struggle we can
 employ the style of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, that
 is, to `remain political figures of the Lenin type' and not
 to `sink to the level of political philistines.'
 Mencius said:  `Everybody can be a Yao or a Shun.'*
 It means the same thing.  We should not resign our-
 selves to despair and hesitate to go ahead when we first
 perceive the qualities of such great revolutionaries as
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  To do so is to become
 just such a `political philistine,' 'rotten wood that cannot
 be carved,' and 'a mud wall.'-
 But different kinds of people adopt different kinds
 of attitudes towards learning from Marx, Engels, Lenin
 and Stalin.
 The first kind learns from Marx and Lenin without
 penetrating into the essence of Marxism-Leninism but
 merely acquires a smattering of Marxism-Leninism.  Al-
 though they read Marxist-Leninist literature over and

 over again and learn by heart many ready-made prin-
 ciples and conclusions from Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin, yet they are unable to flexibly apply these prin-
 ciples and conclusions as methods to solve existing
 concrete and practical problems.  They feel content with
 reciting these principles and conclusions, which they jot
 down and make use of mechanically. Although they work
 under the banner of Marxism and consider themselves as
 'genuine' Marxists, nevertheless they are not genuine
 Marxists and their methods of work are exactly the
 opposite of Marxism-Leninism.
 ? Comrade Stalin wrote in an article in commemora-
 tion of the fiftieth anniversary of Lenin's birthday:
 There are two groups of Marxists. Both work under the
 banner  of  Marxism  and  consider  themselves  'genuine'
 Marxists. Nevertheless, they are by no means identical.
 More, a veritable gulf divides them, for their methods of
 work are diametrically opposed to each other.
 The first group usually confines itself to an outward
 acceptance, to a ceremonial avowal of Marxism. Being
 unable or unwilling to grasp the essence of Marxism, being
 unable or unwili~n-g to translate it into reality, it converts
 the living and ~Tevolutionary principles of Marxism into
 lifeless and meaningless formulas. It does not base its
 activities on experience, on what practical work teaches, but
 on quotations from Marx. It does not derive its conclusions
 and directions from an analysis of actual realities, but from
 analogies and historical parallels. Discrepancy between word
 and deed is the chief malady of this group.
 This is one kind of attitude towards learning from

 The first kind of people once constituted a not incon-
 siderable number within the Communist Party of China.
 The worst representatives among them were even worse
 than those mentioned above.  In fact, they never really
 had any intention of `studying' Marxism-Leninism.  They
 did not concern themselves with the great proletarian
 character and the supreme qualities of Marx and Lenin.
 They attempted to imitate in a superficial way certain
 styles of Marx and Lenin, picked up at random some
 Marxist-Leninist terminology, regarded themselves as the
 Marx and Lenin of China, posed as Marx and Lenin
 within the Party, and had the impudence to ask our Party
 members to respect them as we do Marx and Lenin, to
 support them as `leaders' and to offer them loyalty and
 devotion.  They also made bold to appoint themselves as
 `leaders,' climbed into responsible positions without wait-
 ing to be nominated  by others,  issued  orders like
 patriarchs within the Party, attempted to teach our Party,
 abused everything within the Party and wilfully attacked,  v
 punished and rode roughshod over Party members.  This
 kind of people had no intention of `studying' Marxism-
 Leninism or fighting for the realisation of Marxism-
 Leninism but rather they were opportunists within the
 Party and brokers and black. sheep in the cause of Com-
 munism.  It is beyond doubt that this kind of people
 within the Party should be opposed, exposed and buried
 in oblivion by our Party members.  And our Party
 members have already buried them in oblivion.  How-
 ever, can we say with full confidence that there are no
 more people of this kind within the Party?  We cannot
 yet say so.

 The second kind of people is just the opposite of the
 first. They regard themselves first and foremost as pupils
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin and try to master the
 essence, spirit and methods which made Marx, Engels,
 Lenin and Stalin what they are.  They look up to the
 great personal characteristics of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin and their qualities as proletarian revolutionaries
 and painstakingly carry on their own cultivation in the
 course of the revolutionary struggle and examine them-
 selves to see whether their way of dealing with matters
 and people and the way they themselves behave are in
 conformity with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.  They
 likewise read over and over again the works of Marx,
 Engels, Lenin and Stalin; but they lay great emphasis on
 analysing the living. realities, ponder upon the special
 features of all aspects of the situation facing the pro-
 letariat at the time and in the country in which they live
 and draw their own conclusions therefrom.  They do not
 content themselves with committing to      memory the
 principles  and  conclusions  of Marxism-Leninism but
 strive to stand firm on Marxism-Leninism and master the
 methods of Marxism-Leninism and put them into practice
 in order that they may energetically direct all revolution-
 ary struggles, change the existing state of affairs and
 at the same time change themselves.  Their entire activi-
 ties and the whole of their lives are guided by the
 principles of Marxism-Leninism and are aimed at one
 thing-the victory of the proletariat, national liberation,
 the liberation of mankind, the success of Communisn*
 and nothing else.

 Comrade Stalin said:
 The second group, on the other hand, attaches prime
 importance not to the outward acceptance of Marxism, but
 to its realisation, its translation into reality. What this group
 chiefly concentrates its attention on is determining the ways
 and means of realising Marxism that best answer the
 situation and changing these ways and means as the situa-
 tion changes-to this group may be fully applied Marx's
 saying that Marxists cannot rest content with interpreting
 the world, but must go farther and change it. This group
 is known as the Bolsheviks, the Communists.
 This is another attitude towards learning from Marx,
 Engels, Lenin and Stalin.
 Only the second attitude is correct.  Only by adopt-
 ing this attitude towards studying Marxism-Leninism can
 one avoid the mistake of `drawing a tiger which looks
 like a dog' and improve one's own qualities so as to
 become a proletarian, Communist revolutionary of the
 Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin type.
 Those who really carry on painstaking self-cultiva-
 tion and who are faithful pupils of Marx, Engels, Lenin
 and Stalin pay special attention to nothing other than
 the mastery of the Marxist-Leninist  standpoint  and
 methods and the solution of various problems facing the
 proletariat in the revolution in the same manner as did
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  Apart from this, they
 don't care whether their position and prestige within the
 Party are high or low simply on that account. They never
 claim to be the Marx or Lenin of China and never demand
 or harbour any illusion that others should respect them

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 as they respect Marx and Lenin.  They do not consider
 themselves entitled to such a right and they know that
 to think so would be betraying Marx and Lenin and
 sinking to the level of political philistines.  However, it is
 precisely because of this and because of their courage and
 unrivalled ability in the revolutionary struggle that they
 win spontaneous respect and support from the rank and
 file of the Party.
 Comrades !  Of course it is no easy matter to take
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin as our models in self-
 cultivation and to become their most faithful and best
 pupils. It calls for an iron will and firm determination in
 the arduous struggle for the cause of the proletariat.  It
 calls for a life-long devotion to studying Marxism-Lenin-
 ism and putting it into practice in the course of the
 revolutionary struggles of the broad masses, and for
 steeling and cultivation in every aspect.
 The, Aspects and Methods of Cultivation
 Comrades !  In order to become the most faithful and
 best pupils of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin we need
 to carry on cultivation in all aspects in the course of the
 long and great revolutionary struggle of the proletariat
 and the masses of the people.  We need to carry on cul-
 tivation in the theories of Marxism-Leninism and in
 applying such theories in practice; cultivation in revolu-
 tionary strategy and tactics; cultivation in studying and
 dealing with various problems according to the stand-
 point and methods of Marxism-Leninism; cultivation in
 ideology and moral character; cultivation in Party unity,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 inner-Party struggle and discipline; cultivation in hard
 work and in the style of work; cultivation in being skilful
 in dealing with different kinds of people and in associat-
 ing with the masses of the people and cultivation in
 various kinds of scientific knowledge, etc.  We are all
 Communist Party members and so we have a general cul-
 tivation in common.  But there exists a wide discrepancy
 today between our Party members.  Wide discrepancy
 exists among us in the level of political consciousness, in
 work, in position, in cultural level, in experience of
 struggle and in social origin.  Therefore, in addition to
 cultivation in general we also need special cultivation for
 different groups and for individual comrades.
 Accordingly,  there  should  be different  kinds  of
 methods and forms of cultivation.  For example, many of
 our comrades keep a diary in order to have a daily check
 on their work and thoughts or they write down on small
 posters their personal defects and what they hope to
 achieve and paste them up where they work or live,
 together with the photographs of persons they look up
 to and ask comrades for criticism and supervision.  In
 ancient China, there were many methods of cultivation.
 There was Tseng Tze* who said:  `I reflect on myself
 three times a day.'  The Book of Odes has it that one
 should cultivate oneself `as a lapidary cuts and files,
 carves and polishes.' Another method was `to examine
 oneself by self-reflection' and to `write down some mottoes
 on the right hand side of one's desk' or `on one's girdle'

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 as daily reminders of rules of personal conduct.  The
 Chinese scholars of the Confucian school had a number
 of methods for the cultivation of their hndv and mind.
 Every religion has various methods and forms of cultiva-
 tion of its own.  The `investigation of things, the exten-
 sion of knowledge, sincerity of thought, the rectification
 of the heart, the cultivation of the person, the, regulation
 of the family, the ordering well of the state and the
 making tranquil of the whole kingdom' as set forth in
 The Great Learning* also means the same.  All this
 shows that in achieving one's progress one must make
 serious and energetic efforts to carry on self-cultivation
 and study.  However, many of these methods and forms
 cannot be adopted by us because most of them are
 idealistic, formalistic, abstract and divorced from social
 practice.  These scholars and religious believers ex-
 aggerate the function of subjective initiative, thinking
 that so long as they keep their general `good intentions'
 and are devoted to silent prayer they will be able to
 change the existing state of affairs, change society and
 change themselves under conditions separated from social
 and revolutionary practice.  This is, of course, absurd.
 We cannot cultivate ourselves in this way.  We are
 materialists and our cultivation cannot be separated from
 practice.
 What is important to us is that we must not under
 any circumstances isolate ourselves from the revolution-
 * The Great Learning is said to be 'a Book handed down by
 the Confucian school, which forms the gate by which beginners enter
 into virtue.'

 ary struggles of different kinds of people and in different
 forms at a given moment and that we must, moreover,
 sum up historical revolutionary experience and learn
 humbly from this and put it into practice.  That is to say,
 we must undertake self-cultivation and steel ourselves in
 the course of our own practice, basing ourselves on the
 experiences of past revolutionary practice, on the present
 concrete situation and on new experiences.  Our self-
 cultivation and steeling are for no other purpose than that
 of revolutionary practice.  That is to say, we must
 modestly try to understand the standpoint, the method
 and the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and understand how
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin dealt with people.  And
 having understood these, we should immediately apply
 them to our own practice, i.e., in our own lives, words,
 deeds and work.  Moreover, we should stick to them and
 unreservedly correct and purge everything in our ideology
 that runs counter to them, thereby strengthening our
 own proletarian and Communist ideology and qualities.
 That is to say, we must modestly listen to the opinions
 and criticisms of our comrades and of the masses, care-
 fully study the practical problems in our lives and in our
 work and carefully sum up our experiences and the lessons
 we have learnt so as to find an orientation for our own
 work.  In addition, on the basis of all these, we must
 judge whether we have a correct understanding of
 Marxism-Leninism and whether we have correctly appli-
 ed the method of Marxism-Leninism, found out our own
 shortcomings and mistakes and corrected them.  At the
 same time, we must find out in what respects specific
 conclusions of Marxism-Leninism need to be supplement-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 ed, enriched and developed on the basis of well-digested
 new experiences.  That is to say, we must combine the
 universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete
 practice of the revolution.
 These should be the methods of self-cultivation of us
 Communist Party members.  That is to say, we must
 use the methods of Marxism-Leninism to cultivate our-
 selves.  This kind of cultivation is entirely different from
 other kinds of cultivation which are idealistic and are
 divorced from social practice.
 In this connection, we cannot but oppose certain idle
 talk and mechanicalism on the question of cultivation and
 steeling.
 First of all, we must oppose and resolutely eliminate
 one of the biggest evils bequeathed to us by the education
 and learning in the old society-the separation of theory
 from practice.  In the course of education and study in
 the old society many people thought that it was un-
 necessary or even impossible to act upon what they had
 learned.   Despite the fact that they read over and over
 again books by ancient sages they did things the sages
 would have been loath to do.  Despite the fact that in
 everything they wrote or said they preached righteous-
 ness and morality they acted like out-and-out robbers
 and harlots in everything they did. . Some `high-ranking
 officials' issued orders for the reading of the Four Books
 and the Five Classics* yet in their everyday adminis-
 ? The Four Books and Five Classics are nine ancient Chinese
 classics of philosophy, history, poetry, etc. of the Confucian Canon.

 trative work they ruthlessly extorted exorbitant requisi-
 tions, ran amuck with corruption and killing, and did
 everything against righteousness and morality.  Some
 people read the Three People's Principles over and over
 again and could recite the Will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, yet
 they oppressed the people, opposed the nations who
 treated us on an equal footing, and went so far as to
 compromise with or surrender to the national enemy.
 Once a scholar of the old school told me himself that the
 only maxim of Confucius that he could observe was:  `To
 him food can never be too dainty; minced meat can never
 be too fine,' adding that all the rest of the teachings of
 Confucius he could not observe and had never proposed
 to observe.  Then why did they still want to carry on
 educational work and study the teachings of the sages?
 Apart from utilising them for window-dressing purposes,
 their objects were:  (1) to make use of these teachings
 to oppress the exploited and to make use of righteousness
 and morality for the purpose of hoodwinking and sup-
 pressing the culturally backward people, (2) to attempt
 thereby to secure better government jobs, make money
 and achieve fame and reflect credit on their parents.
 Apart from these objects, their actions were not restricted
 by the sages' teachings.  This was the attitude and return
 of the `men of letters' and `scholars' of the old society to
 the sages they `worshipped.'  Of course we Communist
 Party members cannot adopt such an attitude in studying
 Marxism-Leninism and the excellent and useful teachings
 bequeathed to us by our ancient sages.  We must live up
 to what we say.  We are honest and pure and we cannot
 deceive ourselves, the people or our predecessors.  This is

 an outstanding characteristic as well as a great merit of
 us Communist Party members.
 Comrades!  Is it not possible that the evil legacy of
 the old society still exerts some influence upon us?  It
 does influence us.  Among you students there are, of
 course, none who try to study Marxism for the sake of
 obtaining higher government posts, making money or
 oppressing the exploited.  You are studying Marxism for
 the sake of eliminating the system of exploitation of man
 by man.  However, I cannot guarantee that you have
 lived up to all that you have learnt.  Are there none
 among you who think in the following way?  That is to
 say that their thoughts, words, deeds and lives need not
 be guided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism and that
 the principles they have learnt need not be put into prac-
 tice.  Again are there none among you who think that
 they study Marxism-Leninism and study profound theory
 in order that they may get promotion, to show themselves
 oft and to make themselves celebrities?  I have no
 guarantee that there are absolutely none among you who
 think this way.  Yet this way of thinking does not con-
 form to Marxism and it represents a gap between Marxist
 theory and Marxist practice. We have no objection to the
 study of theory and moreover we must study theory, but
 what we have learnt we must put into practice. We study
 for the sole purpose of putting into practice what we have
 learnt.  It is for the Party and for the victory of the
 revolution that we study.
 For example, you have very often shouted the slogan
 `combine theory with practice' but have you combined
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the theory you have learnt with your own practice?  Are
 there not still some people among you whose practice is
 entirely divorced from the principles of Marxism-Lenin-
 ism?  It seems that there are still people among you
 who understand the combination of theory and practice
 in the following way:  They want comrades working
 outside the school to come to report on their experiences
 so as to see how others combine theory with practice.
 This is of course a combination of theory and practice but
 it is theirs and not yours. I think the fact that you shout
 the slogan ought to mean that you should combine the
 theory you study with your own practice.  If you do not
 understand this point in such a way, then what is the
 use of your shouting the slogan?  I will give another
 example.  You have shouted many slogans about the
 need for steeling yourselves, but are there not some
 people among you who have shown themselves anything
 but steeled or have shown that they could not stand up
 to being steeled when the hour of real test came, when
 they met with a rebuff, or when they were subjected to
 criticism and punishment, to the pressure of public opinion,
 and to the correct or incorrect supervision of the great
 majority of the people?  They forgot that a Communist
 Party member should have a firm will and clear stand-
 point, etc.  They looked dejected, not knowing what to
 do.  Are these not examples of empty talk about steeling
 and cultivation?
 As a matter of fact, the training you receive and the
 study you make in school are also forms of steeling and
 cultivation. We are trying to make you into useful cadres

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and Party workers through training and studying in
 school, not just to get you to learn _ only some abstract
 `theory' and Marxist-Leninist terminology and formulas.
 Moreover, we want you to cultivate and steel yourselves
 so as to become cadres who can think correctly, have a
 firm will and be able to solve in a practical way all
 kinds of complex problems. However, I have often heard
 it said that to study in school is not the way to become
 steeled and that in order to steel and cultivate oneself
 one must leave school and take up practical work.  Com-
 rades ! Steeling and cultivation are a life-long and many-
 sided task.  They are needed everywhere at all times and
 in relation to all problems.  We cannot say that we can
 undertake steeling and cultivation only at certain times,
 in certain places, in connection with certain matters but
 not at other times, in other places and in connection with
 other matters, although we don't deny the fact that Com-
 munist Party members should steel and cultivate them-
 selves mainly in the course of the practical struggle of.
 the masses.
 That is why we are opposed to idealism, idle talk, and
 mechanicalism on the problem of cultivation.  That is to
 say we should be able to stand up to being steeled.  We
 should steel ourselves in school, among the masses, and
 in the struggles both inside and outside the Party.  We
 should study and cultivate ourselves under all circum-
 stances, both of victory and defeat.

 The Relation Between the Study of Marxist-Leninist Theory
 and the Ideological Cultivation of Party Members
 Among our Communist Party members a compara-
 tively prevalent way of thinking is the following:  The
 firm and pure proletarian Communist standpoint has
 nothing to do with a Communist Party member's under-
 standing and mastery of the theory and method of
 Marxism-Leninism.  They think that although their class
 standpoint is not very firm and their ideology not very
 pure (they still retain remnants of the ideology of other
 classes, and they are still selfish and have worldly desires
 and so on), they can nevertheless thoroughly understand
 and master the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism
 all the same.  Some comrades think that it is possible to
 thoroughly master the theory and method of Marxism-
 Leninism merely by means of one's own intellect, ability
 and study.  Comrades !  This way of thinking is wrong.
 Mitin, a Soviet philosopher, is quite right when he
 says:
 As to Marxism.... differences in profundity of under-
 standing require a class explanation. For example, at the
 present time, in the epoch of the decay of capitalism, no
 matter how talented some ideologist of the bourgeoisie may
 be, his creative ability, his ability to obtain a penetrating
 understanding of the laws of development are `constrained'
 by his class nature, by the conservatism of the class he
 represents. The inability of the bourgeoisie to foresee the
 future, determines, narrows down the limits and reduces the
 depth of understanding of the phenomena of social develop-
 ment by bourgeois theoreticians. Notwithstanding all their
 talents, ideologists of those classes which are passing from

 the stage of history are not in a position to make really
 profound scientific conclusions and discoveries. This Marxist
 truth has been confirmed by the whole history of the
 development of science and philosophy.  (Dialectical and
 Historical Materialism, Part I, p.285 of the Russian edition,
 edited by M. Mitin. OGIZ. Moscow 1934)
 Marxism-Leninism is the science of the proletarian
 revolution.  It can be thoroughly understood and master-
 ed only by those who fully take the proletarian standpoint
 and who adopt the ideals of the proletariat as their own.
 It is impossible for anyone to thoroughly understand and
 master the Marxist science of the proletariat, only by
 means of his intellect and strenuous study if he lacks the
 firm standpoint and pure ideals of the proletariat.  This
 is also an obvious truth.  Therefore, in studying the
 theory and method of Marxism-Leninism today it is
 necessary that our , tudy proceeds simultaneously with
 our ideological cultivation and steeling because without
 the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism, we should
 have nothing to guide our thoughts and actions and our
 ideological cultivation would also be impossible.  These
 two are closely related to each other and are inseparable.
 We have often come across some of the best Party
 members of working class origin who are less developed
 in the theory of Marxism-Leninism as compared with
 those who are making a special study of theory.    They
 would certainly prove less proficient if asked to recite
 Marxist-Leninist formulas or quotations from Marxist-
 Leninist works.  But when it comes to studying the
 theory of Marxism-Leninism, quite often their interest is
 keener and their understanding deeper than those Party

 members of student origin, provided it is explained to
 them in words they understand.  For example, the chap-
 ter in Capital dealing with the theory of surplus value is
 most difficult for some Party members to understand but
 it is not so difficult for members of working class origin,
 because workers fully understand how in the process of
 production the capitalists calculate wages and working
 hours, how they make profits and how they expand
 reproduction, etc.  Therefore, it often happens that they
 are able to understand Marx's theory of surplus value
 more deeply than other Party members.  Especially in
 observing and dealing with various practical problems,
 they often prove more apt, more correct and more in
 conformity with the principles of Marxism-Leninism than
 others.  Why is this so? It is because they have the firm,
 pure proletarian and Communist standpoint and ideals,
 an objective attitude towards things, and in their minds
 they have no pre-conceived ideas whatever, no worries
 about personal problems or about impure matters.  There-
 fore, they can immediately perceive the truth of things
 and courageously uphold the truth without any hesitation
 or difficulty.
 If among us Communist Party members there are
 still some whose class standpoint is not very clear-cut and
 firm, whose ideology is not correct and pure, who still
 retain to some degree remnants of various kinds of
 ideology, habits and prejudices of other classes and of the
 old society and who still have personal interests and
 private ends and all kinds of worldly desires and selfish
 ideas, Marxist-Leninist principles and conclusions are

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 certain to clash with all such things of theirs when they
 come to study the theory and  method  of  Marxism-
 Leninism.  In that case, they will either try to overcome
 such things of theirs or try to distort the principles-and
 conclusions of Marxism-Leninism to suit their prejudices,
 thus preventing  them from  understanding Marxism-
 Leninism.  They will be unable to penetrate deeply into
 the essence of Marxism-Leninism, to absorb the quin-
 tessence of Marxism-Leninism which has a distinct class
 character and to make this quintessence a weapon of their
 own because such a weapon has ncfthing in common with
 their former class ideology.
 Again, when they deal with various practical pro-
 blems in the course of the proletarian revolution, the
 solution of these problems in accordance with Marxism-
 Leninism will often be incompatible with their habits and
 prejudices and will be in conflict with their personal inter-
 ests.  Under such circumstances, they will show them-
 selves to be petty-minded, irresolute, hesitant and waver-
 ing.  They will be unable to deal with problems- aptly,
 correctly and in an objective way, or to perceive truth
 without difficulty or to courageously uphold the truth.
 They will go so far as to cover up or distort the truth con-
 sciously or unconsciously. Comrades !  Such cases are by
 no means rare and strange but are of common occurrence.
 Thus we can say:  If a Communist Party member
 lacks the clear-cut, firm, correct and pure standpoint and
 ideology of the proletariat, it will be impossible for him
 to thoroughly understand and master the theory and

 method of Marxism-Leninism and to make of it a weapon
 in his own revolutionary struggle.
 .Therefore, first and foremost in the cultivation of
 Communist Party members should be ideological cultiva-
 tion which is the foundation of all other cultivations.
 This I shall speak about in the following.

 THE IDEOLOGICAL CULTIVATION OF
 PARTY MEMBERS
 COMRADES ! IN DEALING WITH the ideological cul-
 tivation of Communist Party members, I shall try to
 discuss this problem on the basis of certain phenomena
 as manifested in the ideology of some members of our
 Party.  What I am going to talk about in this connection
 is only the most basic ideology of Party members.
 What, after all, is meant by ideological cultivation?
 I consider that it is in the main a struggle in our minds
 between the ideology of the proletariat and other ideo-
 logies; a struggle in our minds between the Communist
 outlook on life and the Communist world outlook on the
 one hand, and all other outlooks . on life and world out-
 looks on the other; and a struggle between two concepts:
 the personal interests and aims of Party members and
 the interests and aims of the Party and of the people.
 I consider that this is a struggle of, conflicting ideas
 reflecting the economic and political demands of different
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 classes in a given society.  The outcome of this struggle,
 so far as the ideology of our Party members is concerned,
 should be the conquest and even elimination of all other
 ideologies by the proletarian ideology; the conquest and
 even elimination of all other outlooks on life and world
 outlooks by the Communist outlook on life and the
 Communist world outlook: the conquest and absorption
 of the idea of the Party members' personal interests and
 aims by the idea of the common interests and aims of
 the Party, of the revolution, and of the liberation of the
 proletariat and mankind.  Should the outcome prove to
 be otherwise, then it would mean the conquest of the
 latter by the former and the Party member would become
 backward and even lose his qualifications as a Communist
 Party member.  To us Party members, this would indeed
 be a dreadful and disastrous outcome.
 It is in the course of all the ideological, political and
 economic struggles both inside and outside the Party that
 we Communists temper our own ideas and come to under-
 stand the realities of the revolution.  At the same time
 we should constantly sum up and absorb the experiences
 gathered from revolutionary practice and examine our
 own ideas to see whether they are completely in con-
 formity with Marxism-Leninism and with the interests
 of the struggle for the liberation of the proletariat.  To
 eliminate in the course of such a study, reflection and self-
 examination all our incorrect ideas and to nip in the bud
 even the faintest idea which runs counter to the inter-
 ests of Communism-this is what we mean by ideo-
 i

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 logical cultivation.  It is also a form of ideological self-
 steeling.
 Comrades ! As you are aware, all the actions of man
 are guided by his ideology.  Furthermore, every man has
 his outlook on life and his world outlook as a general
 guide to his ideas and actions.  Therefore, in carrying on
 ideological cultivation we Communists must, first of all,
 clearly define our outlook on life and our world outlook
 because all our ideas and activities are connected with
 our outlook on life and our world outlook.
 It Is Necessary to Understand that the Cause of
 Communism Is the Greatest and Most Arduous
 Cause in the History of Mankind
 The outlook on life and world outlook of uss Com-
 munists should represent the system of ideology of the
 proletariat.  They are the Communist outlook on life and
 world outlook and are also the methodology of us Com-
 munists.  Since this subject has been treated at great
 length in Marxist-Leninist literature and especially in the
 works of Marx and Lenin on philosophy and since you
 have learnt a great deal about it, I am not going to talk
 about this today.  Here I shall speak only briefly about
 how we should understand our own cause-what, after
 all, is the cause of Communism and how should we Com-
 munist Party members further our cause?
 What is the most fundamental and common duty of
 us Communist Party members?  As everybody knows,
 it is to establish Communism, to transform the present
 world into a Communist world. Is a Communist world
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 good or not? We all know that it is very good. In such a
 world there will be no exploiters, oppressors, landlords,
 capitalists, imperialists or fascists.  There will be no
 oppressed and exploited people, no darkness, ignorance,
 backwardness, etc.  In such a society all human beings
 will become unselfish and intelligent Communists with a
 high level of culture and technique.  The spirit of mutual
 assistance and mutual love will prevail among mankind.
 There will be no such irrational things as mutual decep-
 tion, mutual antagonism, mutual slaughter and war, etc.
 Such a society will, of course, be the best, the most
 beautiful and the most advanced society in the history
 o4 mankind.  Who will say that such a society is not
 good? Here the question arises:  Can Communist society
 be brought about?  Our answer is `yes.'  About this
 the whole theory of Marxism-Leninism offers a scientific
 explanation that leaves no room for doubt. It further
 explains that as the ultimate result of the class struggle
 of mankind, such a society will inevitably be brought
 about.  The victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. has also
 given us factual proof.  Our duty is, therefore, to bring
 about at an earlier date this Communist society, the
 realisation of which is inevitable in the history of man-
 kind.
 But we should understand the other aspect, that is,
 in spite of the fact that Communism can be, and will
 inevitably be realised it is still confronted by powerful
 enemies that must be thoroughly and finally defeated in
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 every respect before Communism can be realised.  Thus,
 the cause of Communism is a long, bitter, arduous but
 victorious process of struggle.  Without such a struggle
 there could be no Communism.     Of course, this struggle
 is not, as some people have said, an `accidental' social
 phenomenon or something engineered by certain Com-
 munists who are `rebellious by nature.'  On the contrary,
 it' is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of the
 development of a class society. It is a class struggle which
 is unavoidable.  The birth of the Communist Party, the
 participation of the Communists in the struggle, their
 organisation and direction of the struggle are also inevit-
 able phenomena, which are in conformity with the laws
 of social development.  Because imperialists, fascists,
 capitalists and landlords-in short, the exploiters-have
 oppressed and exploited the overwhelming majority of
 mankind to such an extent that the oppressed and ex-
 ploited people can hardly live, they cannot but unite to
 oppose this oppression and exploitation; otherwise they
 cannot live and develop.  Consequently, this struggle is
 an entirely natural and unavoidable phenomenon. On the
 one hand, we must understand that the cause of Com-
 munism is the greatest cause in the history of mankind,
 because Communism will  eventually  abolish  classes,
 liberate the whole of mankind and raise human society
 to heights of happiness unparalleled in the history of
 mankind.  On the other hand, we must also understand
 that the cause of Communism is the most arduous cause
 in the history of mankind because Communism must
 triumph over an extremely powerful enemy-the exploit-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 ing classes, along with all their influences, traditions and
 customs, etc. among the people.
 By relying on the proletariat and on the broad masses
 of the exploited and oppressed people and employing the
 strategy and tactics of Marxism-Leninism in directing
 the revolutionary struggle of the broad masses and in
 advancing society towards the great goal of Communism,
 the Communist Party is certain to win final victory.  This
 is because the historical process of the social evolution of
 mankind is advancing towards Communist society, because
 in the ranks of the world proletariat and the masses of
 the exploited and oppressed people the greatest revolu-
 tionary forces lie latent which, when mobilised, united
 and organised, are capable of defeating all the reaction-
 ary forces of the exploiting classes and decaying capitalism
 throughout the world; and because the Communist Party
 and the proletariat are forces that are arising and develop-
 ing.  `Only that which is arising and developing is
 invincible.'  (The History of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union (B) Short Course) This can be fully proved
 by the entire history of the Communist Party of China
 and by the entire history of the international Communist
 and working class movements.
 So far as the present situation is concerned, Com-
 munism has already won a great victory on one-sixth of
 the surface of the globe-in the Soviet Union.  The
 Communist movements in all countries of the world are
 in the process of rapid growth and development. Militant
 Communist parties, armed with, the theory of Marxism-
 Leninism, have already been established in all countries,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and the strength of the world proletariat and the
 exploited, oppressed masses is being rapidly mobilised
 and united in ceaseless struggles.  Therefore, the cause
 of Communism has become a powerful, invincible force
 throughout the world.  There is not the slightest doubt
 that this force will continue to develop and advance and
 will win final and complete victory.  Despite this, how-
 ever, the strength of the international reactionary forces
 and of the exploiting classes are still more powerful than
 ours and for the time being are still predominant in many
 respects.  Consequently, we shall have to go through a
 long, bitter, circuitous and arduous process of struggle
 before we defeat them.
 As exploiting classes have ruled over mankind for
 thousands of years, they have not only made themselves
 extremely powerful in every respect by seizing everything
 under the sun but have also exerted an extremely bad
 influence upon the masses of the exploited classes and
 people in society.  These influences account for all kinds
 of backwardness, ignorance, selfishness, mutual deception,
 mutual antagonism, mutual slaughter, etc. in human
 society.  This phenomenon is bound to occur in class
 society, especially in a society of commodity economy and
 in capitalist society.  This is an inevitable phenomenon
 created by the exploiting classes for the sake of their class
 interests and class rule, because without the backward-
 ness, ignorance, dispersion and disunity of be masses
 of the exploited classes and of the colonial peoples it
 would  be  impossible  for  the  exploiting  classes  to
 maintain their position as exploiters.  Hence, in order

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 to achieve victory we must conduct a sharp struggle not
 only against the exploiting classes but also against the
 prolonged influences of the exploiting classes among the
 masses, against the backward ideology and phenomena
 among the masses so that we can raise their consciousness
 and unite them to defeat the exploiting classes.  Herein
 lies the difficulty we face in the struggle for the cause
 of Communism.
 Comrades !  If the masses were all conscious, united
 and free from the influences of the exploiting classes and
 from backward phenomena as certain people imagine,
 then what difficulties would still remain in the revolution?
 Such influences of the exploiting classes not only existed
 long before the revolution but will continue to exist for
 a very long time after the victory of the revolution and
 after the exploiters have been kicked out of their position
 of political power by the exploited classes.  Just pause
 to think: how many complicated and difficult tasks and
 struggles shall we have to undertake if we are to liberate
 and change the whole of mankind, to finally defeat the
 exploiting classes and their influences among the people,
 to reform tens of millions of small commodity producers,
 to eventually abolish classes and to raise, step by step,
 mankind which for thousands of years has lived in class
 society with all kinds of old customs, traditions and
 backward phenomena  (in such a society mankind is
 divided into classes and nations who fight and kill one
 another and thus create the ideas and customs of selfish-
 ness, mutual deception and mutual antagonism) and to

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 raise it to the height of an intelligent, unselfish, Com-
 munist mankind with a high level of culture and
 technique?
 Lenin said:
 The abolition of classes means not only driving out the
 landlords and capitalists-that we have accomplished with.
 comparative ease-it also means abolishing the small com-
 modity producers, and they cannot be driven out, or crushed;
 we must live in harmony with them; they can(and must)
 be remoulded and re-educated only by very prolonged, slow,
 cautious organisational work. They encircle the proletariat
 on every side with a petty-bourgeois atmosphere, which
 permeates and corrupts the proletariat and causes constant
 relapses among the proletariat into petty-bourgeois spineless-
 ness, disunity, individualism, and alternate moods of exalta-
 tion and dejection. The strictest centralism and discipline
 are required within the political party of the proletariat
 in order to counteract this, in order that the organisational
 role of the proletariat (and that is its principal role) may
 be exercised correctly, successfully, victoriously .... The force
 of habit of millions and tens of millions is a most terrible
 force.... It is a thousand times easier to vanquish the
 centralised big bourgeoisie than to 'vanquish' the millions
 and millions of small owners; yet they, by their ordinary,
 everyday,  imperceptible,  elusive,  demoralising  activity,
 achieve the very results which the bourgeoisie need and
 which tend to restore the bourgeoisie....
 Lenin again said:
 ... the bourgeoisie, whose resistance is increased tenfold
 by its overthrow (even if only in one country), and whose
 power lies not only in the strength of international capital,
 in the strength and durability of the international connections
 of the bourgeoisie, but also in the force of habit, in the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 strength of small production.  For, unfortunately,  small
 production is still very, very widespread in the world and
 small production engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie
 continuously, daily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass
 scale. For all these reasons the dictatorship of the proletariat
 is essential, and victory over the bourgeoisie is impossible
 without a long, stubborn and desperate war of life and death,
 a war demanding perseverance, discipline, firmness, indo-
 mitableness and unity of will.
 This was written by Lenin two years after the victory
 of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union.  , (This
 most difficult task has now already been solved in the
 Soviet Union.)  Hence, the proletariat still has the most
 difficult task to solve even after the victory of the re-
 volution, because our revolution is different                                             from  all
 other revolutions in history.  The bourgeois revolution,
 for example, is usually accomplished by the seizure of
 State power; but to the proletariat, political liberation
 and victory mean only the beginning of the revolution.
 Gigantic tasks still lie ahead after political victory has
 been attained.
 Bourgeois revolution was confronted by only one task-
 to sweep away, to cast aside, to destroy all the fetters of
 the preceding society. By fulfilling this task every bourgeois
 revolution fulfils all that is required of it; it accelerates the
 growth of capitalism.
 The social revolution is in an altogether different
 position. The more backward the country which, owing to
 the zigzags of history, has proved to be the one to start the
 socialist revolution, the more difficult is it for her to pass
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 from the old capitalist relations to socialist relations. To
 the tasks of destruction are added new, incredibly difficult
 tasks, viz., organisational tasks.
 Hence, the proletariat still has difficult tasks even
 after the victory of the revolution.  Hence, the cause of
 Communism is comparable to a `100-year great task' as
 we say, and can never be `accomplished at one stroke.'
 The proletariat in different countries must go through
 different stages of development and defeat different
 enemies  before  Communist  society      can  be  finally
 established.  For example, China is still in the stage of
 ? a democratic revolution of a bourgeois character and its
 enemies  are  imperialism  which  conducts    aggression
 against China, and the feudal forces in collusion with
 imperialism.  These enemies must be defeated before the
 revolution of a bourgeois character can be completed.  In
 the present stage, the broad masses of the small producers
 still constitute a very great motive force of the revolution.
 Our country must undergo a prolonged period of socialist
 reconstruction before it can finally pass, through gradual
 transition, into Communist society.
 Comrades !  To establish Communism is our most
 fundamental duty.  Therefore, to overcome the various
 above-mentioned difficulties confronting the cause of
 Communism is the bounden duty of us Communists.
 Just because the cause of Communism is such a great
 and difficult cause there are today still many people
 (here we speak of those who have a sense of righteous-
 ness and who seek truth) who doubt Communism or
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 withdraw from the cause of Communism because they
 have lost faith in the possibility of establishing Com-
 munism.  They do not believe that mankind can be
 developed and transformed into an exceedingly pure
 Communist mankind and that such difficulties can be
 overcome. Or they have not anticipated such difficulties
 so the moment they meet with difficulties they become
 pessimistic, disappointed and even wavering.
 We Communists must possess the greatest courage
 and revolutionary determination of mankind.   Every
 Party member should gladly and seriously make up his
 mind about shouldering this unprecedentedly great and
 difficult  task  in  human  history-the  realisation of
 Communism.       While we clearly see the difficulties con-
 fronting the cause of Communism, we are not in the least
 daunted by them for we also clearly understand that
 these difficulties can certainly be overcome in the course
 of drawing into the revolution countless millions of
 people.  We clearly understand that the cause of Com-
 munism is a `100-year great task.'  We must fulfil the
 great mission which historical evolution has devolved
 upon us. We have the support of the great masses.  We
 must accomplish a great part of the task of the cause of
 Communism in our generation and leave to posterity the
 final completion of the task. Comrades !  The great vision
 - and courage of us Communists has never been matched
 by that of any past heroes in the annals of mankind. In
 this respect we have every reason to be proud of
 ourselves.

 I remember a learned bourgeois biographer from
 Western Europe who visited the Soviet Union and asked
 Comrade Stalin what he thought about comparing Lenin
 with Peter the Great of Russia.  According to this bio-
 grapher, Comrade Stalin replied that Lenin could be
 compared to the waters of a mighty ocean while Peter
 the Great was only a single drop in the ocean.  Com-
 rades !  Such is the comparison between a leader of the
 Communist cause of the proletariat and a leader of the
 cause of the feudal-bourgeois class in relation to their
 place in history.  From this comparison we can under-
 stand that a leader who fights for the success of Com-
 munism and for the cause of the liberation of mankind
 appears so very great while a leader who fights for the
 cause of a handful of exploiters and parasites appears so
 very small.
 Communist Party members have the greatest ideals,
 greatest objective of struggle and the .most practical
 spirit of `searching for the truth from concrete facts' and
 also carry on practical work.  These are the character-
 istics of us Communists.
 Comrades ! If you only possess great and lofty ideals
 but not the spirit of `searching for the truth from con-
 crete facts' and do not carry on genuinely practical work,
 you are not a good Communist Party member.  You can
 only be a dreamer, a prattler or a pedant.  If on the con-
 trary, you only do practical work but do not possess the
 great and lofty ideals of Communism, you are not a good
 Communist, but a common careerist.  A good Communist

 Party member is one who combines the great and lofty
 ideals of Communism with practical work and the spirit
 of searching for the truth from concrete facts.
 The Communist ideal is beautiful while the existing
 capitalist world is ugly.  It is precisely because of its
 ugliness that the overwhelming majority of the people
 want to change it and cannot but change it.  In changing
 the world we cannot divorce ourselves from reality, or
 disregard reality; nor can we escape from reality or sur-
 render to the ugly reality.  We must adapt ourselves to
 reality, understand reality, seek to live and develop in
 reality, struggle against the ugly reality and transform
 reality in order to realise our ideals.  Therefore, we Com-
 munist Party members should begin our great Com-
 munist task of changing the world by starting from the
 very people in close contact with us and from the very
 work that we can immediately undertake.  Here I shall
 have to criticize some errors frequently made by certain
 young comrades-their attempts to escape from or to
 disregard reality.  It is very good that they have lofty
 ideals.  But they often complain that this place is no
 good and that place is no better; that this kind of work
 is no good and that kind is no good, either.  All the while
 they are looking for some kind of ideal place and work
 so as to enable them to smoothly `change the world.'
 However, such places and such work do not exist except
 in their wishful thinking.
 This is my understanding of the cause of Communism,
 which is our life-long work.  It also constitutes the most
 important part of our outlook on life and our world

 outlook.  Our activities throughout our whole lives are
 for the sake of this and nothing else.
 The Unconditional Subordination of the Personal Interests
 of a Party Member to the Interests of the Party
 Apart from clearly establishing his Communist out-
 look on life and his Communist world outlook, a Com-
 munist must also clearly define the correct relationship
 between his personal interests and the interests of the
 Party.  The Marxist principle is that personal interests
 must be subordinated to the Party's interests, partial
 interests to total interests, temporary interests to long-
 range interests, and the interests of one nation to the
 interests of the world as a whole.
 The Communist Party is the political party represent-
 ing the proletariat.  Apart from the interests of the
 emancipation of the proletariat, the Party has no other
 interests and aims of its own.  The ultimate emancipation
 of the proletariat, however, ' must needs be the ultimate
 emancipation of mankind as a whole, because the pro-
 letariat cannot emancipate itself if it fails to emancipate
 all the working people and all nations, in other words,
 if it fails to emancipate mankind as a whole.  Hence, the
 proletariat must loyally assist and lead all working peo-
 ple, all oppressed nations and peoples in fighting for
 their own emancipation and raising their own living
 standards and their own cultural and political levels.
 Therefore, the interests of the emancipation of the pro-
 letariat are identical with, and inseparable from, the
 interests of the emancipation of the whole of mankind

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and of all the oppressed nations.  Therefore, the interests
 of the Communist Party are the very interests of the
 emancipation of the proletariat and mankind as a whole.
 They are also the interests of Communism and social
 evolution.  Therefore, the subordination of a Party mem-
 ber's personal interests to the Party's interests means
 subordination to the interests of class and national eman-
 cipation and to the interests of Communism and social
 evolution.
 Whether or not a Communist Party member can
 absolutely and unconditionally subordinate his personal
 interests to the Party's interests under all circumstances
 is the criterion with which to test his loyalty to the Party,
 to the revolution and to the Communist cause.  Since the
 realisation of Communism must depend upon the pro-
 letariat and the Communist Party, Communism will never
 be brought about if the interests of the proletariat and
 the Communist Party are impaired.
 At all times and on all questions, a Communist Party
 member should take into account the interests of the
 Party as a whole, and place the Party's interests above his
 personal problems and interests.  It is the highest prin-
 ciple of our Party members that the Party's interests are
 supreme.  Every Party member should firmly build up
 this conception in his ideology.  This is what we have
 often spoken of as `Party spirit,' `Party conception' or
 `organisational conception.'  He should have only the
 Party and the Party's interests uppermost in his mind
 and not considerations of a personal character. He should

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 ensure that his personal interests accord with the Party's
 interests or even merge with them.   Thus when his
 personal interests conflict with the Party's interests he
 will be able to submit to the Party's interests and sacrifice
 his personal interests without the slightest hesitation or
 reluctance.  To sacrifice one's personal interests and even-
 one's life without the slightest hesitation and even with a
 feeling of happiness, for the cause of the` Party, for class
 and national liberation and for the emancipation of man-
 kind is the highest manifestation of Communist ethics.
 This is a Party member's highest manifestation of
 principle.  This is the manifestation of the purity of
 proletarian ideology of a Party member.
 In the Party our members should not have personal
 aims independent of the Party's interests.  The personal
 aims of our Party. members can only be part of the Party's
 aims.  For example, our Party members want to study
 Marxist-Leninist theory, enhance their ability, lead the
 victorious revolutionary struggle of the broad masses and
 establish various kinds of revolutionary organisations, etc.
 If all these are their personal aims they are part of the
 Party's aims as well since they are also in the interests of
 the Party.  And the Party certainly needs large numbers
 of such Party members and cadres.  But apart from this
 our Party members should not have independent aims of
 their own such as personal position, individual heroism
 and so forth.  If they have such aims, they may depart
 from the Party's interests to such an extent as to become
 opportunists in the Party.

 If a Party member has only the interests and aims
 of the Party and Communism in his ideology, if he has
 no personal aims and considerations independent of the
 Party's interests, and if he is really unbiased and unselfish,
 then he will be capable of the following:-
 (1)  He will be capable of possessing  very good
 Communist ethics.  Because he has a strict standpoint he
 `can both love and hate people.'  He can show loyalty to
 and ardent love for all his comrades, revolutionaries and
 working people, help them unconditionally, treat them
 with equality and never harm any one of them for the
 sake of his own interests.  He can deal with them in a
 `faithful and forgiving' spirit and `put himself in the
 position of others.' He can consider others' problems from
 their points of view and be considerate to them.  `He will
 never do to others anything he would not like others to
 do to him.' He can deal with the most vicious enemies of
 mankind in a most resolute manner and conduct a
 persistent struggle against the enemy for the purpose of
 defending the interests of the Party, the class and the
 emancipation of mankind.  As the Chinese saying goes:
 `He will worry long before the rest of the world begins to
 worry and he will rejoice only after the rest of the world
 has rejoiced.'  Both in the Party and among the people
 he will be the first to suffer hardship and the last to enjoy
 himself.  He never minds whether his conditions are
 better or worse than others,' but he does mind as to
 whether he has done more revolutionary work than
 others or whether he has fought harder.  In times of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 adversity, he will stand out courageously and unflinch-
 ingly and in the face of difficulties he will demonstrate
 the greatest sense of responsibility.  Therefore, he is
 capable of possessing the greatest firmness and moral
 cqurage to resist corruption by riches or honours, to resist
 tendencies to vacillate in spite of poverty and lowly status
 and to refuse to yield in spite of threats or force.
 (2)  He will also be capable of possessing the great-
 est courage.   Since he is free from any selfishness
 whatever and has never done `anything against his con-
 science,' he can expose his mistakes and shortcomings and
 boldly correct them in the same way as the sun and the
 moon emerge bright and full following a brief eclipse. He
 is `courageous because his is a just cause.'  He is never
 afraid of truth. He courageously upholds truth, expounds
 truth to others and fights for truth.  Even if it is tem-
 porarily to his disadvantage to do so, even if he will be
 subjected to various attacks for the sake of upholding
 truth, even if the opposition and rebuff of the great
 majority of people forces him into temporary isolation
 (glorious isolation) and even if on this account his life
 may be endangered he will still be able to stem the tide
 and uphold truth and will never resign himself to drifting
 with the tide.  So far as he himself is concerned, he has
 nothing to fear.
 (3)  He will be best capable of acquiring the theory
 and method of Marxism-Leninism, viewing problems and
 perceiving the real nature of the situation keenly and
 aptly.  Because he has a firm and clear-cut class stand-
 point, he is free from personal worries and personal
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 desires which may blur or distort his observation of things
 and understanding of truth. He has an objective attitude.
 He tests all theories, truths and falsehoods in the course
 of revolutionary practice and is no respecter of persons.
 (4)  He will also be capable of being the most
 sincere, most candid and happiest of men.  Since he has
 no selfish desires and since he has nothing to conceal
 from the Party, `there is nothing which he is afraid of
 telling others' as the Chinese saying goes.  Apart from
 the interests of the Party and of the revolution, he has no
 personal losses or gains or other things to worry about.
 He can `look after himself when he is on his own.'  He
 takes care not to do wrong things when he works in-
 dependently and without supervision and when there is
 ample opportunity for him to do all kinds of wrong things.
 His work will be found in no way incompatible with the
 Party's interests no matter how many years later it is
 reviewed.  He does not fear criticism from others and he
 can courageously and sincerely criticize others.  That is
 why he can be sincere, candid and happy.
 (5)   He will be capable of possessing the highest
 self-respect and self-esteem.  For the interests of the
 Party and of the revolution, he can also be the most
 lenient, most tolerant and most ready to compromise and
 he will even endure, if necessary, various forms of
 humiliation and injustice without feeling hurt or bearing
 grudges.  As he has no personal aims or designs, he has
 no need to flatter others and does not want others to
 flatter him, either.  He has no personal favours to ask
 of others, so he has no need to humble himself in order
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 to, ask help from others.  For the interests of the Party
 and the revolution he can also take care of himself,
 protect his life and health, raise his theoretical level and
 enhance his ability. But if for the sake of certain import-
 ant aims of the Party and of the revolution  he  is
 required to endure insults, shoulder heavy burdens and
 do work which he is reluctant to do, he will take up the
 most difficult and important work without the slightest
 hesitation and will not pass the buck.
 A Communist Party member should possess all the
 greatest and noblest virtues of mankind.  He should also
 possess the strict and clear-cut standpoint of the Party
 and of the proletariat (that is, Party spirit and class
 character).  Our ethics are great precisely because they
 are the ethics of Communism and of the proletariat.
 Such ethics are not built upon the backward basis of
 safeguarding the interests of individuals or a small number
 of exploiters. They are built, on the contrary, upon the
 progressive basis of the interests of the proletariat, of the
 ultimate emancipation of mankind as a whole, of saving
 the world from destruction and of building a happy and
 beautiful Communist world.  To a Communist, it is most
 unworthy and inadvisable to make sacrifices for the in-
 terests of any individual or a small number of people.
 But if sacrifice has to be made for the Party, for class and
 national liberation, that is, for the emancipation of
 mankind, for social evolution and for the interests of the
 greatest majority of mankind embracing countless millions
 of people, countless Communist Party members will face
 death with equanimity and make any sacrifice without
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the slightest hesitation.  To the majority of Communist
 Party members, it will be accepted as a matter of course
 `to lay down one's life for a noble cause' or `to die for
 righteousness,' if necessary.  This is not because they live
 in fantasy or are ambitious for praise and fame but
 because of their scientific understanding of social evolu-
 tion
 and their consciousness.  This is exactly why our
 ethics are the greatest and the most scientific.  Apart
 from this, we do not admit that there are so-called greater,
 more scientific `super-class' and general ethics in a class
 society.  This is only deceptive nonsense.  These so-
 called `ethics' are, in fact, built upon the basis of safe-
 guarding the interests of a small number of exploiters.
 This concept of `ethics' has always  been idealist  in
 character.  It is only we Communists who build ethics
 upon the scientific basis of historical materialism and it
 is only we Communists too who openly build ethics upon
 the material basis of the interests of the struggle for the
 emancipation of the proletariat and mankind.
 The Communist Party represents not only the in-
 terests of individual Party members but also the long-
 range interests of the entire body of workers and the
 emancipation of mankind.  The Party's interests are the
 crystallisation of the interests not only of individual Party
 members but also of the entire body of workers and the
 emancipation of mankind.  Apart from the interests of
 the proletariat and the emancipation of mankind, the
 Communist Party has no other interests and aims. There-
 fore, the Communist Party must not be regarded as a
 narrow, small group like a guild which seeks only the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 r         personal interests of its members.  Whoever holds such
 a view is not a Communist.
 ?         Of course, a Party member has his personal interests
 and personal development. At certain times such personal
 interests may come in conflict with, or become antagonistic
 to, the Party's interests.  Should this happen, a Party
 member is required to sacrifice his personal interests un-
 conditionally and should not sacrifice the Party's interests
 to meet his personal interests (no matter under what
 cloak or pretext).  Since the personal interests and
 development of the Party member are included in the
 interests and development of the Party, the success and
 victory of the Party and class also mean the success and
 victory of a Party member.  Therefore, only in the
 struggle for the development, success and victory of the
 Party can a Party member hope to develop himself.  He
 cannot divorce himself from the development of the Party
 in order to strive for his personal development.  In short,
 only in the course of the struggle for the development,
 success and victory of the Party can a Party member
 develop himself; without this, he cannot develop himself
 at all.  Therefore, the personal interests of a Party
 member must and- can be made completely identical with
 the Party's interests and development.
 A member of our Party is no longer just an ordinary
 person.  He is a conscious vanguard fighter of the pro-
 letariat.                                             He should not only represent his personal
 interests. He should prove himself a conscious living
 representative of the interests and ideology of the pro-
 letariat.                                             Since he has already become one of the general
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 representatives of the proletariat, his personal interests
 should never stand out as against the interests of the Party
 and proletariat. As to the cadres and leaders of the Party,
 it is all the more necessary for them to become the living
 representatives of the general interests of the Party and
 of the proletariat and to thoroughly merge their personal
 interests and aims in the general interests and aims of
 the Party and the proletariat. As circumstances now exist
 in China, the proletariat alone can best represent the
 interests of national liberation.  Therefore, our Party
 members have proved themselves the best representatives
 of the interests of the nation as a whole.
 This is one aspect of the problem to which our Party
 members should pay attention.      But there is another
 aspect.
 Although the general interests of the Party include
 the personal interests of a Party member, yet the former
 cannot embrace the whole of the latter.  The personality
 of a Party member cannot and should not be eliminated.
 In any case a Party member will still have some personal
 problems to solve. Furthermore, he still needs to develop
 himself according to his personality  and  his  special
 ability.  Therefore, the Party permits its members to
 build itp their personal and family life and to develop
 their personalities and special abilities so long as these
 do not violate the Party's interests.  Moreover, under all
 possible conditions, the Party will help a Party member
 to develop his personality and special ability in the
 interests of the Party, provide him with appropriate work
 and working conditions and even give him all possible
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 encouragement.  Also under all possible conditions, the
 Party will look after and safeguard the personal, indis-
 pensable interests of a Party member-for instance, the
 Party will give him opportunities to receive education and
 to study, help to solve his domestic and health problems
 and, if necessary, even give up certain Party work in
 order to preserve comrades, etc.  However, all such
 measures are taken with no other purpose than that of
 safeguarding the interests of the Party as a whole because
 the tasks of the Party cannot be accomplished if the Party
 fails to guarantee its members the minimum conditions as
 regards living, work and education in order to enable them
 to work enthusiastically and without worries.  In dealing
 with the problems of Party members the responsible
 leaders of the Party must pay attention to this point.
 This is the other aspect of the problem.
 To sum up, a Party member should unreservedly
 submit to the interests of the Party.  He should be strict
 with himself and public-spirited and should have no
 personal aims or considerations. He should not think only
 of himself in all matters.  He should not make a lot of
 personal demands' on the Party or blame the Party for
 not having promoted or commended him.  Besides, a
 Party member should endeavour, under all- circumstances,
 to study and improve himself to the best of his ability,
 to struggle courageously and to ceaselessly raise his
 consciousness and his understanding of Marxism-Leninism
 in order to render greater contributions and assistance to
 the Party and the revolution.  In dealing with Party
 members' problems the Party and its leaders must pay

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 attention to the working, living and educational conditions
 of Party members in order to enable them to do better
 work for the Party, to develop themselves and to raise
 their consciousness to the greatest extent in the pro-
 letarian revolutionary cause.  Great attention should be
 paid especially to those comrades who are really strict
 with themselves and public-spirited.  Only in this way,
 that is, only by paying attention to both aspects and
 co-ordinating them can the Party be most benefited.
 Examples of Various Kinds of Erroneous
 Ideologies in the Party
 Comrades !  If we take the Communist outlook on
 life and world outlook, our understanding of the cause
 of Communism, and the establishment of a correct rela-
 tionship between the Party's interests and those of Party
 members as our criteria for evaluating our Party members
 and cadres, we will find out that on the one hand, there
 are many Party members and cadres who conform to
 these criteria and can serve as models for other Party
 members, but that on the other hand there are also some
 Party members and cadres who still do not conform to
 these criteria, and still retain different kinds of incorrect
 ideologies to a greater or lesser degree.  Here I shall
 openly point them out in a general way, so that our
 comrades may pay attention to them while carrying on
 their self-cultivation.
 What are the basically incorrect ideologies among
 comrades in the Party?  They can be listed roughly as
 follows:
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Firstly, those who have joined our Party not only
 come from different social strata, but bring with them
 different aims and motives.  Despite the fact that most
 members have joined the Party in order to fight for the
 realisation of Communism, for the great aim of emancipat-
 ing the proletariat and mankind, there are, however, still
 some other members who have joined the Party for other
 reasons and aims.  For example, some peasant comrades
 regarded as `Communism' the `striking down of the local
 despots and the distribution of the land' which we carried
 out in the past and they did not understand genuine
 Communism as meaning anything more when they joined
 the Party.  At the present time quite a few people have
 joined the Party chiefly because of the Communists'
 determined resistance to Japan and because of the anti-
 Japanese national united front.  Certain other people
 have joined the Party as a way out because they could
 not find a way out in society-they had no trade, no
 job, no school to attend, or they wanted to escape from
 their families, or from forced marriages, etc.  Some came
 because they looked up to the prestige of the Party, or
 because they recognised, though only in a vague way,
 that the Communist Party could save China.      And finally
 there were even some individuals who came because they
 counted on the Communists for tax reduction, or because
 they hoped to become influential in the future, or because
 their relatives and friends brought them in, etc.  It is
 very natural that such comrades should lack a clear and
 definite Communist outlook on life and world outlook,
 should fail to understand the greatness and difficulties of
 the Communist cause, and should be unable to take a
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 firm proletarian stand.  Therefore, it is also very natural
 that at certain turning points, under certain conditions,
 some of them should have wavered or changed.  They
 have brought with them all kinds and shades of ideologies
 into the Party.  Consequently, their education, steeling
 and self-cultivation are an extremely important matter.
 Otherwise, they simply will not be able to become
 vanguard fighters of the proletariat.
 Despite this, however, it is by no means a serious
 problem.  That certain people come to rely upon the
 Communist Party, come to the Party to seek a way out
 and give support to the Party's policies-all this, after
 all, cannot be regarded as wrong.  They are not mistaken
 in having sought out the Party.  We welcome such people
 except for the opportunist elements, enemy spies and
 traitors.  The Party's Programme and Constitution must
 be accepted and observed.  As to further study and
 understanding of Communism and of the Party's Pro-
 gramme and Constitution, they can do this after joining
 the Party, and moreover on the basis of their studies they
 can further steel and cultivate themselves in the course
 of the struggle, and thus it is entirely possible for them to
 make themselves into very good Communists.
 As a matter of fact, it is impossible to require many
 people to have a profound understanding of Communism
 and of the Party's Programme and Constitution before
 they join the Party.  It is for this reason that we only
 prescribe the acceptance of the Party's Programme and
 Constitution as a condition for admission into the Party,
 instead of prescribing a thorough understanding of the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Party's Programme and Constitution as a condition,
 Although such persons still do not thoroughly understand
 Communism they may become active fighters in the course
 of the present Communist movement and the present
 revolutionary movement.  Moreover, in the long course
 of the revolutionary struggle, they may become excellent
 and conscious Communists through intensive studies and
 cultivation.   Besides,  our Party  Constitution further
 stipulates that Communist Party members shall have the
 freedom to withdraw from the Party (there. is no freedom
 to join the Party). If any member lacks a profound belief
 in Communism, cannot endure strict inner-Party life, or
 for any other reason, he is free to withdraw from the
 Party.  So long as he does not give away Party secrets,
 does not oppose Communism, does not engage in subver-
 sive activities against the Party, the Party allows any
 member to withdraw and will leave him be.  As to
 opportunists and traitors who have sneaked into the Party,
 we will naturally expel them.  In this way the purity of
 our Party can be preserved.
 Secondly,  certain Party  members  still have  an
 ideology marked by relatively strong individualism and
 self-interest.
 This kind of individualism finds expression in the
 following ways: certain persons, when solving all kinds
 of concrete problems, place their personal interests above
 the Party's interests; or they are always worrying about
 their personal gains and losses, weighing their personal
 interests; or they engage in jobbery, taking advantage of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Party work to achieve certain personal aims; or they
 attempt to pay off their personal grudges against other
 comrades on the pretext of a question of principle, or of
 Party interests.
 When it comes to questions of salaries, amenities and
 other matters concerning private life, they always want
 to surpass others, and to compare and compete with the
 very highest cadres and `use any means to achieve this
 end,' and will brag about such things.  But when it
 comes to work, they want to compare with those who are
 less capable. When there are hardships, they try to avoid
 them; in times of danger, they attempt to run away.  As
 to orderlies, they always want more.    As to living
 quarters, they always want the best.  They want to show
 off and share the honours bestowed on the Party.   They
 try to monopolise all the good things, but will have no
 part in anything that is in something of a mess.
 Comrades !  There are such people in our Party.
 Their heads are full of the ideology of the exploiting
 classes. They even believe in such expressions as:
 `Everyone for himself, and the devil take the hindmost,'
 `Man is a selfish animal,' `There is no such thing in the
 world as a genuinely unselfish person, or else such a
 person is a simpleton or an idiot.'  They make use of all
 such expressions of the exploiting classes to justify their
 own selfishness and individualism.
 This kind of selfish individualism frequently finds
 expression inside the Party in such mistakes as un-
 principled disputes, factional struggles, sectarianism and

 departmentalism. It also finds expression in actions which
 disregard or even undermine at will Party discipline.
 Most unprincipled struggles arise from personal interests.
 Factional struggles and sectarianism often place the
 interests of the individual or the minority above Party
 interests.  Such people often consciously undermine the
 organisation and discipline of the Party in the course of
 unprincipled factional struggles, attack certain persons in
 an unprincipled manner or deliberately, and make friends
 in an unprincipled way with certain people for the
 purpose of not offending each other, mutual shielding and
 mutual boasting and praising.
 As to departmentalism in the Party, it is different
 from such individualism.  Departmentalism comes about
 chiefly because a comrade sees only partial interests, sees
 only his part of the work, does not see the situation as a
 whole and does not see the work of others.  Therefore,
 he commits the mistake of only looking after the interests
 of his part of the work to such an extent that he obstructs
 others.  Politically speaking, this is a thing resembling
 guildism.  In the case of comrades committing the mis-
 take of departmentalism their motives and their starting
 points may not necessarily be very bad.  This of course
 cannot be compared with individualism.  Nevertheless,
 persons with an individualistic outlook often commit the
 mistake of departmentalism.
 Thirdly, self-conceit, individual heroism, showing-off
 etc. still exist to a greater or les* extent in the
 ideology of quite a few comrades in the Party.

 The first consideration of people with such ideas is
 their position in the Party.  They like to show off, and
 want others to flatter them and admire them.  They have
 a personal ambition to become leaders.  They take ad-
 vantage of their abilities and like to claim credit, to show
 off themselves, to keep everything in their hands and they
 are intolerant.  They are full of vanity, do not want to
 bury their heads in hard work and are unwilling to do
 technical work.  They are haughty.  When they have
 made some small achievements they become very arrogant
 and domineering as if there were no one else like them
 in the world.  They seek to overshadow others and cannot
 treat others on equal terms, modestly and politely.  They
 are self-conceited and like to lecture others, to instruct
 and boss others.  They are always trying to climb above
 others, and do not accept directions from others, do not
 learn modestly from others and particularly from the
 masses, nor do they accept criticisms from others.   They
 like to be `promoted' but cannot stand being `demoted.'
 They can only work `in fair weather' but not `in foul.'
 They cannot bear attacks or injustices and are unable
 to adapt themselves to circumstances. They are not `great
 men capable of asserting themselves when necessary or
 of keeping in the background when required.'  They have
 not yet got rid of their deep-rooted `desire for fame' and
 they try to build themselves up into `great men' and
 `heroes' in the Communist cause, and even have no
 scruples in employing any means for the gratification of
 such desires.  However, when their aims cannot be
 achieved, when,Aiey receive rebuffs or cool treatment
 from comrades in the Party, there is a possible danger

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 of their wavering.  In the history of the Party there have
 been not a few members who left the Party because of
 such wavering.  In the minds of such persons there exist
 remnants of the ideology of the exploiting classes.  They
 do not understand the greatness of Communism, nor do
 they have the broad vision of a Communist.
 Communists should not indulge in self-complacency
 or haughtiness.   Granted certain comrades are very
 competent and have done certain work well and made
 great achievements.  For example, our army officers led
 thousands upon thousands of men and won victories, or
 our Party and mass-work leaders in various places
 through their work brought about a much more favourable
 situation.  Theirs may probably be `great' achievements
 of which they may be proud, yet compared with the cause
 of Communism as a whole how great are these achieve-
 ments after all?  Their achievements are but 'a drop in
 the ocean.' To a person with a Communist world outlook,
 what is there in this that one may be really proud of?
 So far as individual Party members are concerned
 how can one's personal position be worth worrying about?
 One's position can never be higher than that of an
 emperor, nevertheless,  comparing the position of an   ?
 emperor with that of a fighter for the cause of Communism,
 how great is it after all?  It is only 'a drop in the ocean,'
 as Stalin has said.  So what is there that is worth worry-
 ing and bragging about?
 Yes, in our Party, in the Communist cause, we need
 countless numbers of Communist heroes and a great

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 many Party and mass leaders with prestige and position.
 At present, we really have far too few revolutionary
 heroes and leaders with prestige. We still need to temper
 and cultivate a great number of very good Communist
 revolutionary heroes and leaders in all fields.  This is a
 very important thing in our cause which simply cannot be
 neglected.  Whoever shows contempt for this point simply
 does not understand how to advance the Communist
 cause.  Therefore, we must still greatly enhance our
 Party members' keenness and aspiration for progress in
 the revolutionary cause.  At present we are not doing
 enough in this respect.   This point shows itself, for
 instance, in the fact that certain Party members are not
 studying hard enough, and their interest in politics and
 theory is not deep enough.
 Therefore, we oppose individual heroism and show-
 ing-off but we certainly do not oppose such aspiration
 for progress among our members-this is a most precious
 quality of Communist Party members. But the proletarian
 and Communist aspiration for progress is entirely differ-
 ent from the individualistic aspiration for progress.  The
 former seeks truth, upholds truth and moreover fights
 most effectively for truth.  It has a perspective of un-
 limited development and is of a progressive nature.        But
 the latter, as far as the individual goes, is extremely
 limited in its progressive nature and furthermore has no
 perspective, because, for the sake of the individual's
 personal interests, it often consciously negates, covers up
 or distorts truth.  Therefore, our comrades must under-
 stand that real leaders and heroes in the Communist
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 cause can never be individualistic and self-appointed.
 Anyone who appoints himself as a leader or who in-
 dividually tries to become a leader can never become a
 leader in our Party.  All leaders, whether national or
 local, have achieved success through mass support.  The
 rank and file of our Party will not support as their leaders
 those persons who are self-conceited, given to individual
 heroism, showing-off, personal ambition for leadership
 and vanity.  No Party member has the right to demand
 that other members and the masses support him as a
 leader or to safeguard his position as a leader.  Only
 such Party members who have not the slightest personal
 aim, who are loyal to the Party, who have a high degree
 of Communist ethics and qualities, who cfh master the
 theory and methods of Marxism-Leninism, who have
 considerable practical ability, who can actually direct
 Party work, who try unceasingly and strenuously to study
 and to make progress can win the confidence and support
 of the Party and the masses and thus become heroes and
 leaders in the Communist cause.
 Our comrades should further realise that a Party
 member, a leader or hero, whoever he may be, can only
 carry out a part of the work of the Communist cause
 and shoulder only a part of the responsibility.  The
 ?       Communist cause is a collective task involving countless
 tens of millions of persons over a long period of time,
 and cannot be monopolised by any individual.  Even our
 great leaders, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin fulfilled
 only a part of the work of the Communist cause. Their
 work still needs the continuous efforts of tens of millions
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 of us.  We ordinary Party members also carry out a part
 of the work and shoulder a part of the responsibility in
 the cause of Communism.  Our part is of course much
 smaller than that of Marx, Engels, Lenin or Stalin.
 Nevertheless, we all have our part.  Although there is a
 difference between a great part and a small part, it is
 a part all the same.  Therefore if we can do a part of the
 work well, it means that we have fulfilled our duty.
 Of course, we should try our best to do a bigger part.
 But if we cannot, we can still do a smaller part just as
 well.  So far as we individually are concerned, this is
 nothing worth while worrying about.  In any case, we
 should at least try not to obstruct the development of the
 Communist cause, and should do our part of the work,
 be it big or small.  That is the attitude we should adopt
 towards our own work.  There are certain comrades who
 are not willing to do technical work, thinking that to do
 so is to belittle themselves, and that it would prevent
 them from becoming famous in later generations (actually
 they can, like Edison and Stakhanov, etc. who all rose
 from among technical workers), and prevent them from
 displaying their talents.  They seem to think that for
 them to do such work would be a great loss to the
 Communist cause.  Therefore, they more or less lose the
 aspiration for progress required of all Party members.
 Comrades !  Such a way of thinking is incorrect !
 Technical work plays an extremely important part in our
 Party work.  Those comrades who are doing such work
 are also doing their part for the cause,of Communism in
 the same way as comrades doing other kinds of work.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 A Communist should do any work that is important at the
 time no matter whether the work is to his liking or not
 or whether it can win popularity or not.  For example,
 following the victory of the Russian revolution many
 cadres doing important Party and political work were
 mobilised to learn the art of trade for the purpose of
 carrying out the New Economic Policy, for at that time
 only by carrying on trade efficiently could the Communist
 Party triumph over private capitalism.  Even though
 none of the Party members liked to do trade yet they
 all did it because it was important. It was right that they
 did it, and it would have been wrong if they had
 not.
 Here, let me repeat, Party leaders in assigning work
 to Party members should naturally take into considera-
 tion the different  circumstances  of individual Party
 members, see to it that the work assigned to them should
 suit their personality and help to develop their strong
 points and encourage their enthusiasm for progress.
 However, the Party member to whom the work is assigned
 should not refuse the assignment on such grounds.
 Fourthly, there are a small number of comrades in
 the Party who strongly reflect the ideology of the ex-
 ploiting classes.  In dealing with Party comrades and
 inner-Party problems they often adopt methods used in
 coping with the enemy, being utterly devoid of the great,
 sincere, Communist and proletarian spirit of mutual
 assistance and solidarity.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Persons with such an ideology seek to elevate and
 develop themselves in the Party, but they achieve this
 purpose by holding others down and obstructing their
 development.  They want to jump over the heads of
 others and are jealous of those who are more capable.
 They feel displeased if others go ahead of them, catch
 up with them or overtake them. They will not be pleased
 until they have succeeded in keeping others down or
 behind them.  They are not willing to be under others.
 They only care about their own well-being, their own
 development, without any consideration for the difficulties
 of others.  When they see other comrades meet with
 difficulties, setbacks, frustration or attacks, they are happy
 over the calamity, secretly rejoice, and are entirely
 devoid of sympathy.  They even scheme to injure other
 comrades, to `throw stones at them when they are already
 down the well' and take advantage of the weak points
 and difficulties of other comrades to attack them and ruin
 their reputation.  In the Party they also take advantage
 of the weaknesses in the Party's organisation and work
 to serve their ulterior purposes, to garner certain personal
 benefits by means of exacerbating such weaknesses.  In
 the Party they are fond of spreading rumours, speaking
 ill of others behind their backs, and scheming to drive a
 wedge in the relations between comrades.  They like to
 take part in all the unprincipled disputes in the Party,
 and take great interest in all `controversies.' Especially
 when  the Party is  in  difficulties,  they create and
 exacerbate such controversies inside the Party.

 In short, they are thoroughly vicious and not in the
 least upright.  Is it not a sheer joke to say that such
 persons can master the theory and method of Marxism-
 Leninism, and can reflect the ideology of the proletariat?
 Quite evidently, theirs is absolutely the reflection of the
 ideology of the declining exploiting classes because all
 exploiters, in order to develop themselves, will impair
 the interests of others.  To increase their own wealth or
 to prevent themselves from going bankrupt during a
 depression, the capitalists crowd out a great many smaller
 capitalists, and compel countless workers to starve.  To
 expand their land, the landlords exploit the peasants and
 deprive many. of their landholdings.  Fascist countries
 like Germany, Italy and. Japan, to expand themselves,
 hindered the development of other countries and con-
 quered  Austria,  Czechoslovakia,  Ethiopia,  etc.                                              and
 committed aggression against China.  To impair the
 interests of others and to render others bankrupt are
 conditions essential to the development of the exploiters
 themselves, whose happiness is founded upon others'
 sufferings.
 Therefore, among exploiters it is impossible to find
 genuing, firm  unity,  genuine  mutual  assistance  and
 genuine human sympathy.  The exploiters must work
 out treacherous  schemes   and underhanded     measures
 against others, for it profits them to undo others or to
 render them bankrupt.  Nevertheless, they are compelled
 to tell lies and pose before the masses as pseudo-saints
 and `supporters of justice'. These are the characteristics
 of all exploiters in their decline.  Such things, however,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 are also reflected in the ideology of some people in our
 Party.  To the exploiters such things may be the standard
 of their `noble' ethics; but to the proletariat, they are
 outright treason.
 The proletariat is entirely different from what has
 just been described.  The proletariat does not exploit
 others, but is exploited by others.  There are no basic
 conflicts in interests among the workers, or between the
 workers and all the other oppressed and exploited toiling
 masses.  To develop themselves and to win their own
 emancipation, the workers not only have no need to
 impair the interests and development of other workers
 or toiling people, but have need of uniting with other
 workers and toiling people.  Only then can the workers
 develop themselves, raise their own position and eman-
 cipate themselves.  The emancipation of the proletariat
 itself must be accompanied by the emancipation of all
 toiling people and mankind as a whole.  It is impossible
 to separately emancipate an individual worker or a
 section of the workers.   The cause of emancipating
 humanity must be carried out to the end, and it is
 impossible to stop or compromise halfway.  And it must
 be the common, complete emancipation of humanity as
 a whole.
 The ideology of the awakened workers, reflecting this
 objective situation of the proletariat, is entirely contrary
 to the ideology of the exploiters.  On the one hand, they
 must of course employ the most merciless measures in
 dealing with the common enemy of the people; on the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 other hand, they never employ such measures in dealing
 with their own brothers and comrades, thus clearly differ-
 entiating, their attitude and measures adopted  against
 their enemy from those directed towards their friends
 and comrades.  They have a great and sincere friendship,
 love and sympathy for their own class brothers and for
 all the toiling people who are being exploited and oppress-
 ed.  They display a great spirit of mutual assistance, of
 firm solidarity and of genuine equality in dealing with
 their own brothers.  They absolutely refuse to recognise
 that any one among their own brothers or among
 humanity has any special privileges and they do not
 cherish the idea that they themselves have any special
 privileges.  To them such a thing is unthinkable and an
 insult.  They want to develop and elevate themselves
 but they know they must at the same time develop others,
 raise the position of the whole labouring class, and only
 thus can they elevate themselves.  They are unwilling
 to lag behind others as regards ideology, politics or work
 and they have a lofty aspiration to strive for progress,
 but they know they must respect, love and help those
 persons who are better qualified in such aspects.  They
 strive to learn from such persons without any jealousy.
 They show extreme concern for the painful and difficult
 situation of their own class and of the whole of the world's
 labouring people.  They are concerned about the struggle
 for the emancipation of labouring people everywhere and
 about their victories and defeats.  They realise that every
 victory or defeat of the labouring people, wherever it
 takes place, means their own victory or defeat, and more-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 over, they express very great sympathy and concern about
 such victories and defeats.
 They consider that in the struggle for the emancipa-
 tion of any labouring people or of all the oppressed people
 it would be criminal to adopt an attitude of indifference
 or to gloat over other's misfortunes.  They love their
 own comrades and brothers; they openly, frankly and
 sincerely point out the weaknesses and mistakes of their
 comrades and brothers.  (Indeed, this is a true expres-
 sion of love).  In matters of principle, they never appease
 or compromise with their comrades or even encourage
 their mistakes and weaknesses (to do so would not- be
 an expression of love), but use every means to help them
 overcome and correct such weaknesses and mistakes.
 They do not utilise or aggravate such weaknesses and
 mistakes to force their comrades into an unfortunate or
 even hopeless situation.
 In dealing with their own comrades and brothers,
 they `return good for evil.'  If only the other comrades
 will correct their mistakes they will have not the slightest
 desire for retaliation.  They are able `to require much
 from themselves and little from others.'  They are strict
 with themselves but rather lenient towards other com-
 rades.  Nevertheless, they take a firm and strict position
 in matters of principle, and adopt a candid, upright and
 serious attitude.  They will not compromise on questions
 of principle.  They will not tolerate anyone who in any
 way harms the interests of the Party, nor will they allow
 anyone to insult them without reason.  They are especial-
 ly contemptuous of anyone who lavishly praises, flatters
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 or adulates them in an unprincipled way.  They oppose
 all unprincipled struggle among their own comrades and
 at the same time keep themselves from being involved in
 unprincipled struggles.  They are not influenced or irritat-
 ed by those irresponsible and informal criticisms made
 behind their backs and will not on this account lose
 their own stand on matters of principle or their cool-
 headed and calm attitude.
 All this represents the ideology of the proletariat
 and should be reflected, developed and learnt by every
 one of our Party members.  The entire lives of our great
 leaders, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin represent the
 highest model and concrete embodiment of such ideology.
 All this represents the uprightness of humanity in the pre-
 sent society, and it is the Communist Party that manifests
 such uprightness.  We must promote and elevate such
 uprightness in order to overcome all viciousness.
 Fifthly, bureaucracy still exists in our Party and
 in various organisations.  I will speak again on this
 subject later on.  Among some comrades there still exist
 such weaknesses as narrow-mindedness and the minding
 of small matters without taking into consideration the
 overall situati    They do not have the great courage
 or. the far-gig    ness of a Communist.  Blind to the
 bigger issues, they are very much interested in small
 matters ? under their nose.  They are not very  much
 interested in the vital problems and the highly important
 events of the Party and the revolution, but instead often
 concern themselves with trifles as small as a needle or
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 a piece of thread or with insignificant remarks.  Over such
 trifles they will seriously and endlessly argue with others
 and become overwhelmed with unrestrained emotion.
 They can also be easily bribed by others with small
 favours or gifts.  They have all the characteristics of
 narrow-mindedness of the small producer in rural society.
 Also there are still certain individuals who seem to
 have no clear and definite standpoint.  To them, this may
 be all right and that may also be all right.  They play
 ball with both sides and try to please everybody.  To
 his face they can get along very well with a person whom
 they hate.  They can speak well of you to your face,
 while speaking ill of you behind your back.   They may
 speak well of a certain person to one man, and speak
 ill of the same person to another man.  `To show himself,
 when speaking, to be a respecter of persons and cir-
 cumstances,' to `tack with the wind,' and to lean without
 principle on the winning side-such are their characteris-
 tics.  Sometimes they are just fence-sitters, watching to
 see which side is winning and going over to 'hat side.
 Such people who are neither `fish, flesh, nor fowl' but
 who are `double-dealing' creatures are not altogether
 unknown in our ranks.  They display the characteristics
 of a broker.
 In addition, there are certain persons who simply
 cannot stand the temptations of the exploiting classes of
 the old society.  They begin to waver when they see
 around them the kaleidoscopic world, glittering gold and
 beautiful women.  As a result, they may commit crime,
 or may even betray the Party and the revolution.

 Furthermore,  the  impetuosity  and  inconsistency
 which characterise the petty-bourgeoisie, and the des-
 tructive character of the lumpen-proletariat and the
 bankrupt peasantry are also often reflected in the ideology
 of some of the comrades in the Party.  We have no need
 to go further with. our list.
 To sum up, apart from those who represent the
 Communist ideology of the great and resolute pro-
 letariat, there still exist in our Party certain comrades
 who, to a greater or lesser degree, reflect various kinds
 of non-proletarian ideology and even the ideology of the
 declining exploiting classes.  Such ideology is sometimes
 latent in the Party and only reveals itself in some small
 individual  daily, problems.   Sometimes  it  grows and
 systematically exposes itself in various problems of
 principle in the Party, in important political questions
 and in inner-Party struggles.  Certain individual sections
 or links of the Party organisation may also be controlled
 or corroded by such erroneous ideology. When it develops
 to the highest degree, for instance, during the time when
 Chen Tu-hsiu,.Chang Kuo-tao and the like were in power
 in the Party such erroneous non-proletarian ideology even
 temporarily controlled the major part or the most
 important part of the Party leadership.  But in normal
 times such ideology is overcome by correct proletarian
 ideology.  This  is  demonstrated  by  the  inner-Party
 ideological struggle.
 The same is also the case with certain Party members.
 Sometimes, their erroneous ideology lies dormant and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 under control.  But at other times it may develop to the
 point of controlling their actions.  This is demonstrated
 by the contradictions and struggles between the two
 different ideologies possessed by the same individual.
 Our ideological cultivation means that we should
 consciously adopt the proletarian and Communist outlook
 on life and world outlook and have a correct understand-
 ing of the relationship between individual development
 and the interests of the emancipation of the class, nation
 and mankind in order to overcome and eliminate all kinds
 of incorrect and non-proletarian ideologies.
 The Origin of the Various Erroneous
 Ideologies in the Party
 Comrades!  The Communist  Party represents the
 brightest and the most progressive side of contemporary
 human  society. It is here that the best ideology of
 humanity-Marxism-Leninism-exists and develops.  Ga-
 thered together in the Communist Party are the world's
 most conscious, progressive, and sound persons with the
 highest sense of morality and righteousness.  They per-
 sistently fight against all evil influences and struggle for
 the bright future and for the final emancipation of human
 society.  The Chinese Communist Party is one of the best
 Communist Parties in the world.  It is powerfully armed
 with Marxist-Leninist theory, and, at the same time, it
 has inherited the finest traditions of the many progressive
 thinkers and prominent men who have made  great
 achievements in past generations in China's history. It
 stands for the most progressive and the brightest side

 of Chinese society.  In its organisation are gathered
 together the most splendid Chinese men and women. It
 has carried on a protracted struggle against the old, evil
 influences and traditions of Chinese society and it has
 accumulated rich experiences, and gone through many
 trials over a long period of revolutionary struggle.  All
 these are matters which we Communists can be proud of.
 Furthermore, we can assert, with full confidence and on
 every authority, that we shall certainly athieve final
 victor*and final success.
 However, even so, not everything in our organisation
 is perfect.  Our organisation is not without defects or
 mistakes.    Our ranks are not without unsound elements
 or even bad eggs.  And it is still not impossible for such
 unsound elements and bad eggs to do foul and harmful
 things. That is to say in our bright Party there are
 still things of darkness, there is still a seamy side.  These
 are the things which I have previously enumerated.
 Once. a family has taken in marriage an ugly son-
 in-law or daughter-in-law, it will not be possible to
 keep him or her from meeting the guests.  With regard
 to the things of darkness, even if we try to adopt an
 attitude of `not washing our dirty linen in public,' it will
 be impossible.  The masses of people are in constant
 contact with our Party, our sympathisers will come to
 visit us, and a vast number of people, young men and
 women, who look up to us, desire to come here (Yenan
 -Translator) to learn from us or to join our Party. When
 they arrive here, apart from seeing all our progressive,

 bright, and beautiful things and family-members, they
 will meet our ugly son-in-law or daughter-in-law, who
 in the presence of many people, talks nonsense, or makes
 a fool of himself or herself.  In such cases some of our
 guests and new Party members will, wonder.  They will
 ask such question:  Isn't the Communist Party supposed
 to be the most just? Aren't Communists the best men and
 women?  Why are there still such ugly persons and bad
 things in the Communist Party?  Isn't this strange?
 Some young comrades, before they joined the Party,
 were very bitterly dissatisfied with existing society and
 felt that there was no way out and that only the Com,
 munist Party offered the brightest hope.  They thought
 that after they joined the Party everything would be
 satisfactory and hopeful.  But after they joined they
 began to feel that in the Party there were also certain
 mistakes, defects and things of darkness. Moreover, in
 fact, we cannot make them feel satisfied with everything
 (because what they find to be satisfactory may be more
 or less not in conformity with the interests of the Party
 and the revolution).  What they now actually feel does
 not exactly coincide with their former ideals.  Then they
 began to feel doubtful and puzzled and asked:   `Why are
 there also such things in the Communist Party?'  Before
 some of them came to Yenan and entered the Anti-
 Japanese University they thought that Yenan and the
 Anti-Japanese University must be as good as they had
 dreamed them to be, but after they had arrived and
 entered the University they found that not everything was
 satisfactory.  Then they again became puzzled, asking:

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 `Why are there still such unsatisfactory things at Yenan
 and in the Anti-Japanese University?'  Certain persons
 even became pessimistic and disappointed because they
 could not find answers ?to these questions.
 With reference to these questions, in addition to
 sharpening  our vigilance  and  instructing  our  Party
 members and cadres to pay serious attention to carefully
 treating and guiding our new Party members and those
 who are inclined to us, and not giving them an unfavour-
 able impression, it is necessary to give an explanation to
 our comrades inside and outside of our Party.
 Why are there still such bad things in the splendid
 organisation of our Party?  The reason, I think, is very
 simple.  It is that our Party is not a Party that has
 fallen from the heavens; it is a Party which has grown out
 of the existing Chinese society.  Although in general our
 Party members are relatively the best Chinese men and
 women, the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat, they
 come, however, from every stratum of Chinese society
 and are still living in this society which is replete with
 the influences of the exploiters--selfishness, intrigues,
 bureaucracy and every kind of filthy thing.  Most of our
 best Party members are unlikely to be influenced by
 such things, but is it so strange that there should still
 be other Party members who to a greater or lesser extent
 bring into our Party, or reflect in our Party, some of the
 filthy things of society?  Is it anything strange that there
 are muddy stains on a person who crawls out of the
 mud and who constantly dabbles in the mud?  It is not
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 strange at all.  It is a matter of course.  It would be
 very strange indeed if there were absolutely no such
 filthy things in the Communist Party.  How could it be
 possible for such a filthy society to give birth to a Com-
 munist Party that is perfectly immune from filth?  It is
 utterly inconceivable.  It can be said that so long as
 there are still such filthy things, so long as there are
 still classes and the influences of the exploiting classes in
 society, there are bound to be such filthy things in the
 Communist Party to some extent.
 Therefore the Communist Party is confronted with
 the task of  carrying  on  the  revolution  and it is
 necessary for Communist Party members to carry on
 self-cultivation and steeling. Because of this, in addition
 to waging struggles against all dark and backward in-
 fluences and things in society we must carry on inner-
 Party struggle to oppose the wavering, unsteady elements
 who reflect in the Party all kinds of dark and backward
 things in society.  This constitutes the very basis of our
 inner-Party contradiction and inner-Party struggle.  In
 the course of the various struggles inside and outside of
 the Party we seek to remould society, to gradually rid
 it of the dark, backward things and at the same time to
 remould our Party and Party members, to solve inner-
 Party contradictions so as to develop our Party and
 Party members to a sound and firm level.
 ... the sources of contradiction within proletarian parties
 lie in two circumstances.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Firstly,  pressure by the  bourgeoisie  and bourgeois
 ideology on the proletariat and its Party in the course of
 the class struggle-pressure which the least steadfast strata
 of the proletariat, and that means the least steadfast strata
 of the proletarian Party, not infrequently give way to. It
 cannot. be considered that the proletariat is completely
 isolated from society, that it stands outside society. The
 proletariat is part of society, connected with its various strata
 by numerous ties. But the Party is part of the proletariat.
 Therefore, the Party cannot be free of connections with, and
 the influence of, the various strata of bourgeois society. The
 pressure of the bourgeoisie and its ideology on the proletariat
 and its Party- finds expression in the fact that bourgeois
 ideas, morals, customs and moods not infrequently infiltrate
 into the proletariat and its Party through certain strata of the
 proletariat, connected in one way or another with bourgeois
 society.
 Secondly, the heterogeneity of the working class, the
 presence of different strata within the working class.  I
 think that the proletariat, as a class, may be divided into
 three strata.
 One stratum is the basic mass of the proletariat, its core,
 its permanent part, it is that mass of `thoroughbred' pro-
 letarians, which has already long ago severed its ties with
 the capitalist class. This stratum of the proletariat is the
 most dependable support of Marxism.
 The second stratum consists of those who only recently
 came from the non-proletarian classes, from the peasants, the
 middle classes, the intelligentsia. These people who come
 from other classes, who only recently joined the ranks of
 the proletariat, have brought with them into the working
 class their customs, their habits, their hesitations, their
 instability.  This stratum represents the most favourable
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 breeding ground for all sorts of anarchistic, semi-anarchistic.
 and `ultra-leftist' groupings.
 Finally, there is a third stratum:  the working class
 aristocracy, the elite of the working class, the best provided
 for section of the proletariat, with its tendency towards a
 compromise with the bourgeoisie, with its dominant tendency
 to adapt itself to the powers that be, with its striving 'to
 become a somebody'.  This stratum represents the best
 breeding ground for outspoken reformists and opportunists.
 Comrades!  This is the origin of various non-pro-
 letarian ideologies, errors, defects and filthy things which
 still exist in our splendid proletarian Party.  This is the
 origin of the various contradictions that still exist in the
 Party.
 The Attitude Towards Various Erroneous Ideologies
 In the Party and Inner-Party Struggle
 Because of the influence of the exploiting classes,
 because of the heterogeneity of the working class and of
 our Party, there arise among different Party members
 differences in ideology, viewpoint, custom, habit and
 mood;  there  arise  among  different  Party  members
 differences of varying degree in their philosophy of life,
 their world outlook, and their concept of ethics; and
 there arise among different Party members differences
 in methods of looking at things and ways of thinking
 with regard to various revolutionary problems.   Some
 look at things in a correct objective manner, from the
 angle of their development and their inter-connection;
 while others look at things in an incorrect subjective
 manner, taking things to be in a state of stagnation and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 isolation.  Some only observe or exaggerate this aspect
 of things, while others only see or exaggerate that aspect
 of things; that is to say, they do not view problems as a
 whole in accordance with the laws of the development
 and relation of objective things, but view problems in
 a one-sided and subjective way; therefore differences as
 to the method of activity are brought about among Party
 members and differing ideas, views and arguments arise
 and in this way inner-Party struggles are aroused.
 Such  differences  and  arguments  will  inevitably
 become all the sharper, especially at turning points of
 the revolution, in conditions of ever-intensifying revolu-
 tionary struggles and growing hardships and under the
 influence and pressure of the exploiting class and its
 ideology. Therefore, the crux of the problem is not
 whether there are differences an ideology ? and opinions
 in the Party-there are bound to be such differences.
 The point i  low to solve the contradictions within the
 Party, how to get rid of these differences, how to over-
 come the various erroneous non-proletarian ideologies in
 the Party. Naturally, it is only through inner-Party
 struggle that we can solve these contradictions, clear
 away the differences, and overcome the various erroneous
 ideologies.  Just as Engels said:  `No one can at any
 time hide contradictions for long.  Contradictions must
 be solved by means of struggle.'
 Different kinds of people, both inside and outside of
 the Party, hold different kinds of views and adopt
 different kinds of attitudes towards the various errors
 and defects and undesirable things in the Party.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 People of one kind do not see or are unwilling to
 see the defects, errors, and undesirable things in the
 Party.  They are blindly optimistic and take it for granted
 that everything is all right in the Party; therefore they
 relax their vigilance and slacken their struggle against
 the defects, errors and all the undesirable things.
 People of a second kind see nothing or almost nothing
 but errors, defects and undesirable things; they do not
 see the bright side of the Party.  They consider that
 nothing is good in the Party; therefore they become
 pessimistic, disappointed and lose their cdnfidence in the
 future of the Party.  Or having seen such things, they
 become alarmed and regard such things as `disastrous.'
 Both of these views are incorrect and one-sided.
 Our view is different from both.  On the one hand, we
 know that our Party is the most progressive, most
 revolutionary political party of the Chine$$ proletariat.
 On the other hand, we clearly realise that in our Party
 there are still various kinds of errors, defects and un-
 desirable things, both large and small.  At the same time
 we clearly understand the origin of these things, the
 method of gradually correcting them and eliminating
 them.  Accordingly, we must strengthen our efforts and
 work and carry on the necessary struggle in order to
 advance our Party and the revolution.
 Just as the standpoints and views of various persons
 are different, so there are also different kinds of attitudes
 towards the undesirable things in our Party.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 The first kind of attitude is:  To enjoy seeing the
 defects, errors and "undesirable things in our Party and
 to gloat over them and by every means utilise and magnify
 them in order to undermine our Party (sometimes the
 method used is to oppose certain mistakes and to support
 the Party line in such a manner as to channel the mis-
 takes in another direction).  This is the attitude adopted
 by our enemies outside the Party and by the spies and
 trotskyites lurking within the Party.
 The second kind of attitude is:  To sympathise with,
 accept and learn from certain erroneous ideologies and
 bad examples in order to gratify certain personal ambi-
 tions and desires.  People with this attitude consider that
 the existence of certain defects and errors in the Party
 is to their advantage, therefore they themselves con-
 sciously or unconsciously promote the development of
 such defects and errors and make use of them.  This is
 the attitude adopted by opportunists and Party members
 of the most undesirable character.
 The third kind of attitude is,  To leave these errors,
 defects and undesirable things undisturbed and to let
 them take their own course.     People with this attitude
 try to take things easy and are unwilling to struggle
 against these things.  Or they fear inner-Party struggle
 and self-criticism, and consider these as harmful and not
 beneficial to the Party.  Or they are apathetic and unwill-
 ing to recognise these phenomena or they adopt a perfunc-
 tory,  conciliatory and eclectic attitude towards these
 phenomena.. This is the attitude adopted by Party mem-
 bers who have but a weak sense of duty towards the Party
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 and who are profoundly imbued with liberalism and who
 are guilty of bureaucracy.
 The fourth kind of attitude is:  To harbour violent
 hatred towards the errors, defects and persons in the
 Party whose ideology is incorrect.   People with this
 attitude bluntly sever. relations with such persons, attempt
 to purge them and expel them from the Party at one
 stroke.  But if they fail in this or if they themselves meet
 with rebuffs they give up and become disheartened and
 melancholy.   They  `mind  their  own  business,'  keep
 themselves aloof or stand far away from the Party. This
 kind of absolute attitude also finds expression in a
 mechanical understanding of inner-Party struggle and
 self-criticism. They think that the more  bitter   the
 struggle among comrades in the Party the better; they
 raise every trifle to a so-called `level of principle'; they
 label the tiniest fault as political opportunism, etc., and
 abuse the organisational methods of the Party or even
 methods used in struggles outside the Party to punish
 comrades.  They do not carry on the inner-Party struggle
 in an appropriate and concrete manner in accordance
 with the objective requirements and the laws of develop-
 ment of objective things, but, on the contrary, they carry
 on the `struggle' mechanically, subjectively, violently and
 unscrupulously.  They consider that inner-Party struggle
 must be carried on under any circumstances, and the more
 frequent and the more bitter the struggle the better, with
 the result that they deliberately hunt for `targets for
 struggle,' deliberately create inner-Party struggle, and
 seek to promote the work of the Party by relying upon
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 such mechanical `struggle.'  This is the attitude adopted
 by Party members who do not understand the origin of
 the contradictions within the -Party and who lack know-
 ledge of the methods of dealing with inner-Party differ-
 ences and who only mechanically understand inner-Party
 struggle.
 The fifth kind of attitude is the very attitude we
 should adopt, an attitude which is opposite to the four
 kinds previously mentioned.
 1.  We first of all recognise and make out which of
 the various phenomena, ideologies, diverse opinions and
 views are correct, beneficial to the long-range interests
 of the Party and the revolution and which of them are
 incorrect and detrimental to the long-range interests of
 the Party and the revolution.  Maybe both sides to the
 dispute are wrong but a third opinion and view may be
 right.  After sober analysis and consideration we decide
 our clear-cut attitude, and take up our stand on the cor-
 rect side.  We do not blindly follow or idolise anybody.
 2.  We study, promote, and develop all that is good
 and upright and uphold all the correct views and opinions
 in the Party.  We do not imitate the bad examples or
 allow ourselves to be influenced by incorrect ideology.
 3.  We do not adopt a liberal attitude but carry on
 an irreconcilable struggle against various ideologies and
 views which are wrong in principle and against all unde-
 sirable phenomena in the Party in order to constantly
 try to overcome such mistakes and phenomena.  We do
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 not temporise or permit the development of these mistakes
 and phenomena to jeopardise the interests of the Party.
 Nor do we fear this kind of inner-Party struggle.
 4.  We do not, however, adopt a mechanical, absolute
 attitude.  We combine irreconcilability and clarity in
 principle with flexibility in the methods of struggle and
 with the spirit of patient persuasion.  In the course of
 prolonged struggles, we seek to educate, criticise, steel
 and reform those comrades who possess erroneous ideo-
 logies but who are not incorrigible.  In a concrete and
 appropriate way we carry on ideological struggles in the
 Party which are essential to the various questions of
 principle at different stages but do not recklessly carry
 on struggle in the Party in a subjective, mechanical and
 fanatical manner.  Nor are we addicted to struggle.
 5.  By means of inner-Party struggle we consolidate
 the Party and `enhance its discipline and prestige, and
 mete out organisational penalties to the incorrigible
 elements or even expel them from the Party in order to
 ensure the soundness and consolidation of our Party. This
 is the attitude which all good and mature Party members
 should adopt.
 Of the five previously-mentioned attitudes only the
 fifth is the correct Bolshevik attitude.  It is obvious that
 the first and second attitudes are incorrect.  It is not at
 all strange that our enemies should make use of all our
 errors and defects in order to undermine our Party.  In
 addition to constantly sharpening our vigilance, we should,
 on every occasion when defects and mistakes occur inside
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 the Party, reduce any opportunity which could possibly
 be utilised by the enemy.  This is the bounden duty of
 every comrade who loves our Party.  If in the course of
 inner-Party struggle a Party member ignores this point,
 or is only concerned with victory in the  immediate
 struggle and his own momentary gratification, or if he
 does not reject assistance from bad elements, but joins
 in with them, or if he utilises certain forces and help
 from outside the Party in order to attain a certain goal
 in inner-Party struggle, he will commit an unforgivable
 political mistake and a gross violation of Party discipline.
 Our Party members should reflect the correct ideology,
 learn from good examples and not from incorrect ideo-
 logies and bad examples in the Party.  They should fight
 against such incorrect ideologies and bad examples.
 There are, however, still certain comrades in the Party
 who, apart from reflecting correct ideologies and follow-
 ing good examples, sometimes more or less reflect certain
 incorrect ideologies and follow bad examples.  It seems
 easy for certain comrades to learn to be bad but hard
 for them to learn to be good.  This deserves our serious
 attention.
 These comrades, in the event of certain mistakes
 occurring in the Party, are apt to help to develop or
 magnify such mistakes either intentionally or uninten-
 tionally and in the course of inner-Party struggle they
 often line up on the wrong side, or for certain reasons
 they join the winning side.  These comrades will scarcely
 make any progress, unless seriously prodded and steeled.

 It is, I think, quite clear to you students of the
 Institute of Marxism-Leninism that the comrades of the
 third kind who adopt a liberal and bureaucratic attitude
 towards the various errors,  defects  and undesirable
 phenomena are of course extremely wrong and entirely
 non-Bolshevik.   For in Party Construction which you
 have studied, there is a whole chapter devoted to the
 necessity of self-criticism and ideological struggle in the
 Party.  Lenin and Stalin have likewise on many occa-
 sions given clear and profound explanations on this point
 to which you may make reference, and the fourth and
 fifth chapters of the book On Political Parties, published
 by the Chinese Publishing House, deal with this question
 at great length, therefore I need not go into details now.
 What I do want to point out, however, is that there are
 still not a few comrades in the Party who adopt this kind
 of attitude.  They have been very inadequate in carrying
 on self-criticism and particularly in self-criticism from
 the lower levels upwards, and in exposing various errors,
 defects, and undesirable phenomena in the Party in a
 responsible, formal, and sincere manner in order to cor-
 rect and eliminate them.  In this respect, we still need
 great improvement.  But there is quite a lot of irrespon-
 sible, informal and cowardly criticism and discontent,
 backbiting and gossiping in the Party about this or that
 person or concerning this or that matter.  These are two
 expressions of liberalism in the Party.  This shows that
 the political development and courage on the part of some
 comrades in the revolutionary struggle are still inade-
 quate and that the correct practice of inner-Party demo-
 cracy is also still inadequate.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Certain comrades dare not dispense with face-saving,
 fear to give offence to others or to incur their animosity
 or counter-criticism.  They would rather leave the various
 errors and defects in the Party alone and adopt a perfunc-
 tory attitude of `muddling through' and `the less trouble
 the better' and yet they criticize others behind their backs.
 This is not beneficial but detrimental to the Party..  Such
 irresponsible criticism and talk may lead to unprincipled
 disputes and splits in the Party, and may offer opportuni-
 ties to spies lurking in the Party and bad elements to
 carry on disruptive activities in the Party.   Furthermore,
 the mistakes and defects in the Party will never be correct-
 ed by means of such kind of irresponsible criticism.
 Therefore the Party rules adopted at the Sixth Plenary
 Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
 of China prohibit such irresponsible criticism and talk
 and promote inner-Party, responsible and formal self-
 criticism which is beneficial to the Party.
 Since various errors, defects and incorrect, non-
 proletarian ideologies exist in the Party, each of these
 incorrect ideologies may at some time develop into a
 certain trend in the Party, give rise to differences in the
 Party over certain principles and affect the Party's unity
 in action.  If under such conditions we do not correctly
 carry on self-criticism in the Party and constantly expose
 and correct the various errors and defects, overcome all
 incorrect ideologies and conduct inner-Party struggle to
 overcome inner-Party differences, but instead adopt an
 eclectic attitude and `middle' line and try to muddle
 through-then, `we shall not be able to correctly educate
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 the Party, the proletariat, and the masses' (Stalin).  'We
 shall not be able to advance or develop'; 'we shall no
 longer be proletarian revolutionaries and we shall be
 doomed to failure.'  (Lenin).
 Stalin said:
 The 'middle' line on questions of principle is a 'line' that
 muddles up one's head, a 'line' that covers up differences, a
 'line' of ideological degeneration of the Party, a 'line' of
 ideological death of the Party.
 The policy of the 'middle' line on questions of principle
 is not our policy. The policy of the 'middle' line on question
 of principle is the policy of a party that is declining and
 degenerating from day to day. Such a policy cannot but
 lead to the transformation of such a party into an empty
 bureaucratic organ, functioning fruitlessly and detached from
 the working masses. This road is not for us.
 Therefore, .... the  overcoming  of  the  contradictions
 within the Party by means of struggle is the law of
 development of our Party .... the All-Union Communist Party
 (Bolsheviks) grew and gained strength by overcoming the
 contradictions within the Party.
 Therefore, it is incorrect to adopt a liberal and
 bureaucratic attitude; self-criticism must be developed
 and inner-Party struggle carried on to oppose all undesir-
 able phenomena, and to overcome differences in the Party
 before it can be consolidated, developed and advanced.
 Liberalism is manifested in another phenomenon.
 When a particular dispute has broken out in the Party
 many comrades put aside their regular work and for
 days and nights engage in inconsequential discussions or
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 deliberately indulge in denouncing everything in  the
 Party, and in the course of such debates they weaken
 Party unity, disintegrate the solidarity of the cadres,
 weaken Party discipline, incapacitate the Party leader-
 ship, destroy Party prestige and convert militant Party
 organisations and the Party apparatus into debating
 societies.  Cases like this have taken place more than
 once in the past in certain of our Party organisations.
 As Stalin says:  `This is not self-criticism but a scandal.'
 `This is slandering the working class.'  This is alien, anti-
 Bolshevik `self-criticism.'  It has nothing in common with
 the self-criticism we advocate.  The reason why we need
 self-criticism is not to destroy Party prestige, undermine
 Party discipline, weaken Party leadership, but to promote
 Party prestige, consolidate Party discipline, and streng-
 then Party leadership.
 The comrades of the fourth kind who adopt an
 absolute attitude are also wrong.  This attitude is the
 opposite of liberalism-the third attitude mentioned
 above.  Those who adopt this attitude do not understand
 that the incorrect ideologies in the Party have a deep-
 rooted social origin and cannot be eliminated at one
 stroke. All comrades in the Party, at different times,
 are more or less apt to reflect some incorrect ideology of
 society. Only people like Marx, Engels, Lenin and
 Stalin, people so pure, so firm, and so correct, keen and
 profound in observing things can be perfectly free from
 the influence of these ideologies.  That is why Dr. Sun
 Yat-sen called Lenin `the sage of the revolution.'  It is
 inevitable that everyone of us will commit some mistakes

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 in our work.  If we do not tolerate and make allowances
 but absolutely reject and even eliminate all comrades who
 to some degree or other reflect non-proletarian ideologies
 of society and who commit some mistakes but who are
 not incorrigibly bad elements, then our Party cannot be
 built up.  The ultimate result of such rejection and
 elimination may lead to the eventual elimination from
 the Party of the very comrades who adopt this absolute
 attitude, because they are not `sages of the revolution'
 and they themselves cannot help committing mistakes.
 For example, in the past some comrades committed mis-
 takes  during  the  campaign  to  suppress  reactionary
 elements because they adopted this absolute attitude.
 Comrades who adopt this attitude do not specifically
 understand  that  in  the course of the  struggle for
 the cause of Communism, the greatest and most difficult
 task is to transform mankind into selfless citizens of
 Communist society.  If they understand this point, if
 they understand that even mankind with all its weakness-
 es, can in the long course of struggle, be steeled, educated,
 and converted into highly civilised Communists, why
 can they not educate and reform Party members who
 have joined the Party but who still retain to some degree
 or other the remnants of the ideology of the old society?
 Naturally, it needs long, patient education and steel-
 ing to reform and educate these Party members.  It is
 a difficult task.  However, if we are reluctant to under-
 take this small, difficult task and shrink from it, how
 can we talk about changing the world' and mankind?
 Since we have made up our minds to undertake, and not

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 to shrink from, the unprecedentedly arduous task  of
 changing the world and mankind what other arduous tasks
 in the world today can daunt us?  Party members who
 believe in the Communist philosophy of life and world
 outlook are dauntless and unafraid of any difficulties and
 hardships, and at the same time understand that the
 course of progress of world events is a tortuous one.  The
 comrades who adopt an absolute attitude do not yet
 understand the arduous and tortuous nature of the cai tse
 of Communism.  If they fear hardships, desire to travel
 a straight road, to eliminate at one stroke all the undesir-
 able things, and immediately to leap into their ideal
 world, they will certainly run their heads against the
 wall.  After they have run their heads against the wall
 they will become pessimistic and disheartened, lose their
 confidence in the future of the cause of Communism, thus
 exposing the very substance of their non-proletarian ideo-
 logy.                                           What a pity it is that there are still not a few
 comrades in our Party who more or less adopt such an
 attitude!
 Zhe reason why inner-Party struggle is necessary
 is that differences over principles inside the Party are
 brought about in the course of the development of the
 Party and the struggle of the proletariat; at such times,
 differences can be overcome and contradictions solved
 ,only by a fight for one or the other principle, for one or
 the other goal of the struggle, for one or the other method
 in the struggle leading to that goal.'  No compromise will
 be of any avail.  Inner-Party struggle is necessary not
 because we like to struggle or to argue.  That is to say,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 when questions have developed to the level of principle
 and cannot be solved by any means but struggle, we
 should unflinchingly carry on inner-Party struggle to
 solve them.  It does not mean that we have to conduct
 inner-Party struggle in a fussy and uncompromising way
 and with a long face, against all dissenting views con-
 cerning current policies and purely practical matters.
 Comrade Stalin said:
 We can and must reach all kinds of agreements with
 dissenters within the Party on questions of current policy, on
 questions of a purely practical character.
 When  opportunist  ideology  manifests  itself  and
 differences in principle take place in our Party, we must
 carry on struggle to oppose these erroneous principles
 and opportunism and overcome them; it does not mean
 that when there is no difference in principle, no oppor-
 tunism in the Party-we subjectively and deliberately try
 to magnify some difference in opinion among the com-
 rades concerning certain purely practical matters and
 take it for `difference in principle,' and deliberately
 `hunt' for certain comrades as `opportunists,' regarding
 them as `targets' in inner-Party struggle.  It does not
 mean that we think that the work of the Party, the
 development of the Party and the victory of the prole-
 tarian revolutionary struggle will be miraculously ex-
 panded simply by relying upon intensifying the fire
 against such `targets.'  Of course, this is not conducting
 inner-Party struggle seriously but is simply making a
 mockery of the Party, and making child's play of inner-
 Party struggle, which is of an extremely serious nature.

 It is necessary to prod, publicly criticize or even
 mete out organisational penalties to certain comrades in
 the Party who, having committed mistakes in principle
 and displayed opportunist ideology, turn a deaf ear to
 persuasion,  ignore  Party  criticism,  and  furthermore
 persist in their errors and become so headstrong and
 obstinate as to struggle against the policy of the Party
 or adopt a double-faced attitude.  But we should not
 attack or punish comrades who have committed mistakes
 if they do not persist in their mistakes and after dis-
 cussion and persuasion, are willing to correct their mis-
 takes and give up their former points of view, or when
 they are calmly thinking over their mistakes or are dispas-
 sionately discussing them with other comrades.. In carry-
 ing on self-criticism and inner-Party struggle we do not
 mean that the grimmer the face the better nor do we mean
 that the more comrades we punish the better.  The
 highest aim of self-criticism and inner-Party struggle is
 to effectively educate the Party, to educate the comrades
 who have committed mistakes, to correct errors and to.
 consolidate the Party.  If this aim can be attained by
 means of peaceful discussion, persuasion and criticism
 instead of pulling a long face, engaging in heated discus-
 sion, punishing or attacking comrades-if this is possible,
 then of course, it is all the better.  However, during
 certain periods in the past, we hardly ever heard in the
 Party openly expressed views to the effect that such inner-
 Party peace and solidarity resulting from the absence of
 differences over principle were both desirable and essen-
 tial.  According to some seemingly crazy people, inner-
 Party peace is bad even if it results from unity in prin-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 ciple and line, and only by deliberately creating inner-
 Party struggle out of nothing can we be called 'Bolshe-
 viks.'  Of course people of this kind are not `Bolsheviks'
 at all but are almost incorrigible people and careerists
 usurping the name of `Bolshevik.'
 This is the reason why the four previously-mentioned
 attitudes are wrong.  This is the answer to the question
 as to what attitude we. should adopt in dealing with the
 errors, defects and undesirable phenomena in the Party.
 As a matter of fact, it is through the struggle against the
 things of darkness inside and outside the Party that we
 seek to change the world and mankind, as well as our
 Party and "ourselves.  Inner-Party struggle is the reflec-
 tion of the class struggle outside the Party.  In the course
 of the class struggle outside the Party-the revolutionary
 mass struggle-the Party steels, develops and consoli-
 dates itself and at the same time, in the course of the
 inner-Party struggle achieves solidarity and unity so as
 to be able to lead the revolutionary mass struggle
 systematically, correctly and effectively.
 Therefore, it is entirely wrong and favourable to the
 enemy to adopt a liberal attitude towards the various
 mistakes,  defects and undesirable phenomena in the
 Party, to try to deny differences over principle in the
 Party, to evade inner-Party struggle, to cover up inner-
 Party contradictions and `muddle through,' because it is
 against the laws of development of the class struggle
 and against our fundamental standpoint of changing the
 world and mankind through struggle.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Therefore, it is also wrong to separate inner-Party
 struggle from the class struggle outside the Party-the
 revolutionary struggle of the broad masses-and to turn
 it into empty talk because the Party cannot steel, develop
 and consolidate itself if it divorces itself from the re-
 volutionary struggle of the broad masses.
 However, it is not right, either, to carry the matter
 to another extreme-to adopt an absolute attitude to-
 wards' the comrades who have defects and mistakes but
 are not entirely incorrigible, and to mechanically carry
 on, or even subjectively create, inner-Party struggle,
 because this will undermine the Party, afford opportuni-
 ties to the enemy to attack our Party and is against the
 laws of development of the Party.  We should not break
 with the honest comrades in the Party the moment they
 have committed some mistakes but should seek to per-
 suade, educate, and steel them in a considerate and
 sympathetic manner.  We should not publicly attack
 them or expel them from the Party unless it is absolutely
 necessary.
 In spite of certain errors and defects, certain indivi-
 dual, isolated, bad phenomena that still exist in our Party
 we are fully confident that in the development of the
 working class movement and in the great revolutionary
 struggle of the masses, we can and shall certainly elimin-
 ate these things.  The history of the past more than ten
 years' struggle of the Chinese Communist Party, its great
 progress in all respects, and the history of the development
 of the working class movement in the various. countries
 of the world have thoroughly convinced us on this point.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Inner-Party struggle is an indispensable and essen-
 tial component part of the revolutionary struggle of the
 Party.  Therefore our comrades should not only be steeled
 and cultivated in the course of the struggle outside the
 Party, but also be steeled and cultivated in the course of
 inner-Party struggle on two fronts.  However, not a few
 of our comrades still do not thoroughly realise this point
 and lack self-cultivation and steeling in this respect.
 This is manifested in many unprincipled struggles in the
 Party, and in the following examples: some of our com-
 rades, especially those who have worked for a relatively
 long time in the army, never vacillated, complained or
 felt disheartened in the course of the struggle against
 the counter-revolution, no matter how cruel and hard
 the struggle was or how many attacks, wrongs, or in-
 justices they suffered.  But during inner-Party struggle
 they could hardly bear any criticism, attacks and in-
 justices, not even a single word.  Or they were suspi-
 cious and thought that what other people said alluded
 to them and on this account they would complain and
 become extremely disheartened. Comrades, we cannot
 but pay attention to such phenomena.
 We ought to say that they are in general very good
 comrades because they resolutely fought against the
 counter-revolution and regarded the Party as their affec-
 tionate mother.  After having undergone many hard
 battles against the counter-revolution and returned to
 the arms of their own great mother they expect to meet
 with encouragement, consolation and affection and not
 more attacks, criticism and injustices.  It is only natural
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 that they should have such expectations.  However, what
 they have not taken into account or into full account is
 that since there are still various errors and defects in the
 Party it is necessary to conduct inner-Party struggle in
 which every comrade must take part.       It is inevitable
 in the course of inner-Party struggle for everybody to
 meet with correct or incorrect criticisms, attacks or even
 injustice and humiliation.  This must be undergone by
 every comrade.  It is not because our Party is merciless,
 but because this is an inevitable phenomenon of the Party
 in the course of the class struggle.  However, these com-
 rades fail to take this point into account, therefore the
 moment they come across such phenomena they are sur-
 prised and feel exceptionally miserable and disheartened.
 In this respect, I think that our comrades should on
 the one hand, take care to unite with other comrades,
 treat them in a sincere and candid manner and should
 not hurt their feelings by casual malicious remarks, or
 throw sharp sarcastic remarks at them, and especially
 should not irresponsibly criticize comrades behind their
 backs.  With the exception of those who are most ob-
 stinate and who persist in their mistakes and do every
 kind of wrong thing in the Party, we should, in general,
 clearly and sincerely admonish and criticize, in their
 presence, and in a considerate and helpful  manner,
 comrades who have committed mistakes.  This is what
 we, and especially our comparatively responsible com-
 rades, should pay attention to.  We should bear in mind
 an old Chinese maxim:  `If the body is cut with a sharp
 knife, the wound will heal, but ill-feeling roused by
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 sarcasm will never be forgiven.'  On the other hand, our
 comrades on their part should always be prepared for
 inner-Party struggle and should have the courage to bear
 criticism, attacks or misunderstandings and injustices and
 especially should not be aroused to anger by other's irres-
 ponsible  and  even  incorrect  criticism  and  rumours.
 Besides formal and mutual criticism made among the
 comrades in Party organisations, so long as our ideology
 and behaviour are correct, we may, if necessary, make
 some explanations in answer to the irresponsible criticism
 and misunderstanding by others, and if such explanations
 are of no avail we had better let others say what they
 like.  We should also bear in mind two other old Chinese
 maxims:  `Who is not gossiped about by others behind
 his back, and who does not gossip about others?T  'When
 the storm rises, sit calmly in the fishing boat.'  There is
 not a single person in the world who is not misunderstood
 in some way by others.  On the one hand, we should be
 able to bear any misunderstanding and not involve our-
 selves in unprincipled struggles; on the other hand, we
 should always keep ourselves on the alert and examine
 our own ideology and behaviour.
 That is to say, we should riot casually hurt other
 comrades' feelings by our remarks but we should be able
 to bear any remarks others may cast at us.
 We are radically opposed to unprincipled disputes
 in the Party.  Since they are `unprincipled' they are
 harmful and unprofitable to the Party.  Since they are
 `unprincipled' there is nothing right or wrong, good or
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246A033800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 bad about them.  We should not try to find out who is
 right and who is wrong, or who is good and who is bad
 in unprincipled , struggles, because these matters cannot
 be straightened out.  We are radically opposed to this
 kind of unprincipled struggle and ask comrades who are
 engaged in it to stop it unconditionally and return to
 questions of principle. This is the policy we should adopt
 in unprincipled disputes.  What shall we do, if in spite
 of prohibition by the Party and opposition by us, un-
 principled disputes in the Party still take place or many
 unprincipled questions are involved in certain struggles
 over principle?  What shall we do if unprincipled ques-
 tions are thrust upon us and we become involved in them?
 In cases like this, we must concentrate our attention on
 the questions of principle and not on the unprincipled
 ones and must seriously deal with unprincipled disputes
 in accordance with the above-mentioned policies, firmly
 maintaining our standpoint to the end without becoming
 entangled in unprincipled disputes.  We should not re-
 turn `wrong' for `wrong.'  We should consistently, stand
 upon the `right' side to oppose the 'wrongs' of others.
 This is not very easy for some of our comrades to do.
 Therefore we must carry on steeling and cultivation.
 In a word, the aim of our ideological cultivation is
 fundamentally to steel us as loyal, pure, progressive,
 model Party members and cadres.  We should do the
 following:
 1.  Build up our Communist philosophy of life, world
 outlook and firm Party and class standpoint through the
 study of Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary practice.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 2.  Examine our own ideology, behaviour, correct all
 erroneous ideas and at the same time look at questions
 and other comrades on the basis of the Communist philo-
 sophy of life, world outlook and firm Party standpoint.
 3.  Constantly adopt an appropriate attitude and
 method in the struggle against various erroneous ideo-
 logies in the Party, especially those that affect the re-
 volutionary struggle of the time.
 4.  Strictly control ourselves in ideology, speech and
 behaviour. We should particularly control those political
 ideologies, speeches and activities which concern the
 revolutionary struggle at the time by taking a firm stand-
 point and by sticking to principle.  In addition it would
 be best to pay attention even to many 'trifles' (private
 life, behaviour, etc.).  But as regards other comrades,
 except on questions of principle and important political
 questions, our restrictions imposed upon them should not
 be too severe.  We should not try to find fault over
 'trivialities.'
 Comrades!  This is, in my opinion, what is meant by
 the fundamental ideological cultivation of Communist
 Party members.

 APPENDICES
 THE CLASS CHARACTER OF MAN
 (Written in June, 1941)
 IN A CLASS SOCIETY, man's class character forms the
 very nature and substance of man.
 In a class society all human beings exist as human
 beings of a particular class.  Therefore, the social charac-
 ter of man is determined by his class status.  As the class
 status of one person is different from that of another, so
 is his social character.  In the past, Mencius, Kautze,
 Hsuntze* and others had argued `whether human nature
 was good or evil' without ever achieving any result.  This
 was because they did not understand or deliberately
 wanted to cover up the class differences in the social
 character of man. In a class society men's ideas of good
 and evil are different.  What is regarded as good by the
 ? All the three were leading Confucian scholars of the latter part
 of Chou Dynasty (1122-255 B.C.). They held different views with regard
 to human nature. Mencius was of the opinion that human nature
 was primarily good. lisuntze regarded it as evil while Kautze thought
 that it was likely to change.
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 exploiters is regarded as evil by the exploited, and vice
 versa.  Naturally, to discuss the question as to whether
 human nature is good or evil without taking into con-
 sideration the relationship of classes will get nowhere.
 Likewise, if we do not adopt the proletarian standpoint
 we cannot judge how good or how bad certain people
 are, still less can we judge the party spirit of these people.
 The class character of man is determined by his class
 status.  That is to say, if a given group of people have
 for a long time held the status of a given class, i.e., a
 given position in social production, and have for a long
 time produced, lived and struggled in a given manner
 they will create their particular mode of life, and their
 particular interests, demands, psychologies, ideas, cus-
 toms,  viewpoints, manners  and relations with other
 groups of people and things, etc.  All these are different
 from, or contrary to, those created by other groups of
 people.  In this manner the particular characteristics of
 men, their particular class character, are formed.
 As men of different classes in society have different
 interests, demands, ideas and customs, so they have differ-
 ent ways of looking at, and different policies in dealing
 with, everything in society and history-such as politics,
 economics, culture, etc.  The ruling classes enact laws
 and systems in accordance with their interests, demands
 and viewpoints.  As a result, all political, economic and
 cultural systems in society become tools of the ruling
 classes and all are permeated with a class character.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 In a' class society all ideas, utterances, behaviour,
 social systems and doctrines of men are permeated with
 a class character, representing the particular interests
 and demands of certain classes.  From the different de-
 mands, doctrines, ideas, utterances and behaviour of men,
 we can find out their different class character.
 For example, natural agricultural economy and the
 method of handicraft production are the basis of feudal
 society.  In such production the feudal lords are in a
 position to exploit. the surplus labour of the peasants.
 They do not work' but rely upon land rent and corvee
 as a means of living.  Therefore they want to get hold
 of more land and to possess it permanently.  They de-
 mand that the peasants pay more land rent and contribute
 more unpaid services, and recognise as justified their
 right of trampling on and exploiting the peasants, thus
 giving rise to their feudal sectionalism, swallowing-up
 of others, extravagance, laziness, cruelty and social rank.
 Such are the characteristics of the feudal class.
 The method of machine production in modern indus-
 try is the basis of capitalist society.  In such production
 the bourgeoisie own the means of production and all the
 products with which to exploit the surplus labour of the
 proletariat.  Their livelihood is dependent upon the sur-
 plus value created by the workers.      Such being the case,
 they want free buying and selling of commodities and
 of labour power, and free competition.  They use econo-
 mic means to destroy their competitors and to create for
 themselves an economic and political monopoly.  They
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 claim the inviolability of their private property and
 demand that the workers give their surplus labour in
 greater quantity (longer working hours and speed-up)
 and in better quality (better and more experienced skill)
 for less pay.  They also want the workers to recognise
 as justified their right to become rich and to monopolise
 the wealth of society, thus giving rise to their competition,
 monopoly, extravagance and the centralised and mechani-
 cal character of their organisation.  Such are the charac-
 teristics of the bourgeoisie.
 Take the case of the peasants. The peasants have
 for a long time been tied to the land and have been
 engaged in production in a form that is scattered, inde-
 pendent, simple, self-sufficing and with little mutual co-
 operation.  Their way of life is simple and individualistic
 and they bear the burden of land rent and unpaid services,
 etc.  Thus, the ground is prepared for their lax ways,
 conservatism, narrow-mindedness, backwardness, outlook
 as of private owners, revolt against the feudal lords and
 their demand for political equality, etc.  Such are the
 characteristics of the peasantry.
 The proletariat are concentrated in big industries,
 carrying on production with a minute division of labour;
 all their actions are governed by machines and mutual-
 dependence; they are wage-labourers who sell their labour
 power and who do not possess any means of production;
 they rely on wages as a means of livelihood and their
 basic interests do not conflict with those of other toilers.
 Hence the ground is prepared for their great solidarity,
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 mutual co-operation, sense of organisation and discipline,
 progressive outlook and demand for public ownership of
 property, revolt against all exploiters, militancy, tenacity,
 etc. Such are the characteristics of the proletariat.
 All exploiting classes deceive and oppress the exploit-
 ed and fight among themselves. for the surplus products
 or surplus value of the, exploited, thus giving rise to their
 deceitfulness, oppression of man and mutual plundering.
 Many wars in history were caused by the exploiting class-
 es fighting among themselves over the seizure and division
 of the-surplus products and surplus value produced by
 the exploited.
 A feature common to all exploiters is that they build
 their happiness upon the sufferings of other  people.
 Sacrificing the happiness of all mankind, or the great
 majority of the people, subjecting them to hunger, cold
 and humiliation in order to provide special privileges
 and special enjoyment for an individual or for a small
 number of people-such is the foundation of the `noble
 character,' 'greatness' and `respectability' and moral basis
 of all exploiters.
 The reverse is the case with the proletariat and the
 Communists. They want to build their happiness upon
 the basis of sharing their happiness with all others. In
 the struggle for the emancipation of the broad masses
 of the working people and of all mankind, they seek
 to emancipate themselves and eliminate the special pri-
 vileges of the small number of people.  Such is th foun-
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/23: CIA-RDP80T00246AO33800700001-9
 dation of the noble character, greatness, respectability of
 the Communists and the foundation,of Communist ethics.
 Such are the various class characteristics of men in
 a class society.  These class characteristics are gradually
 formed as a result of the specific position of men who
 engage for a long time in production, their specific rela-
 tions of production and specific way of life.  They become
 a kind of nature of men.  This nature is social in
 character.
 Party spirit is the highest crystallisation of such
 class characteristics of men.  Therefore men possess party
 spirit of various kinds:  The party spirit of the feudal
 class, the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, etc.
 The Party spirit of a Communist is the highest cry-
 stallisation of the class character, the substance and the
 interests of the proletariat.  The steeling and cultivation
 of a Communist in the Party spirit is the remoulding of
 his substance.
 The Communist Party should develop the many great
 and progressive characteristics of the proletariat to the
 highest level.  Every Communist should remould himself
 in accordance with these characteristics and equip him-
 self with these excellent characteristics.  This is the re-
 moulding of substance.  All Party members who do not
 come from the ranks of the industrial workers possess
 non-proletarian characteristics, and therefore need all the
 more to be remoulded.

 Nor are the characteristics of the proletariat un-
 changeable.  It was in the course of the birth and growth
 of the proletariat that the characteristics of the proletariat
 took shape, grew and finally gave rise to Marxism-
 Leninism.  During the period of socialist transformation
 in the future and the period when socialism is passing
 into Communism,  the  proletariat  will  continuously
 change society and the substance of mankind, and, at the
 same time, its own substance and characteristics.  In
 Communist society class distinctions between men Will
 die out and so will the class characteristics of men. Then
 the common character of mankind, 'namely common
 human nature, will be formed.  This represents the entire
 process of the remoulding of the substance of mankind.
 However, in the history of the world only the Com-
 munists and Marxists acknowledge their own Party spirit
 and class character as well as those of all other people
 and of all historical and social matters.  This is also due
 to the fact that the special class status of the proletariat
 enables the Communists to openly recognise and declare
 this truth. The declaration of this truth does no harm
 to the proletariat but deals a serious blow to the exploit-
 ing classes for their treachery is exposed and they will
 be placed in a more difficult position to uphold the in-
 terests of a small number of people. None of the other
 parties or classes admit their party spirit and class
 character and they try to describe themselves as if they
 were `super-party' or `super-class.'  As a matter of fact,
 behind this nonsense about `super-party,' and `super-class,'

 are hidden as many vested interests as there are exploit-
 ing classes.  Before the exploited they dare not admit
 their party spirit and class character.  Because of their
 illusions and ignorance the petty-bourgeoisie accept this
 fallacy of `super-party,' `super-class.'
 The petty-bourgeoisie is characterised by its indul-
 gence in illusions and by its fear of serious practice and
 struggle.
