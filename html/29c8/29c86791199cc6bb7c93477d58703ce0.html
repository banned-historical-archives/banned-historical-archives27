Prefatory Remarks 
This paper is one of a series of reports on systems of mass 
communication in Communist China,* It is a comprehensive study 
on the state of publishing in Communist China, We have exhausted 
all the major sources on this subject in Chinese and English 
available publicly abroad. The bulk of our data, however, is 
in Chinese.

Background 
The first Chinese printing can be placed at about 600 A.D., 
but modern publishing for mass consumption was introduced to China 
from the West in the late nineteenth century. After the Opium War 
in 1839, a big influx of Westerners came to China; the biggest 
group were missionaries. 
To propagate their faith, the missionaries brought modern 
printing techniques to China. To modernize so as partially to 
withstand the rapid social change brought by Westerners, the Manchu 
government set up official publishing bureaus to translate Western 
technical books. These two forces gave birth to modern publishing 
in China. 
At first, the policy of the missionaries' publishing enter-
prises in China was to print many popular educational books along 
with religious ones so long as the content of the former did not 
contradict Christian dogma. The policy of the Manchus was to 
print only technical books. The result was that the missionary 
publishing houses enjoyed a brisk business. The Manchu government 
did not print popular educational books until Emperor Kuang }Isi's 
abortive "reform movement" in 1898, But in the meantime Chinese 
entrepreneurs were already developing private publishing concerns.

In 1897, a group of young Chinese who had been apprentices 
in a missionary printing shop started a business of their own. 
They established the now well-known Commercial Press (Shan Wu Yin 
Shu Kuan), Their former Western masters now became their major 
customers. The missionaries had set up many schools in China and 
the Commercial Press printed their text books. But it was after 
1902 that the Commercial Press became a real publishing house in-
stead of just a printing shop. Riding on the tide of Chinese 
interest in Western culture, the Commercial Press published language 
books like Elementary English (Hua Yin TSU Chieh) and Advanced  
English (Hua Yin Chin Chieh) which contained Chinese explanations 
...moswiimorts marmairs? 
of the English text. These books earned good profits for the 
Commercial Press, which soon became the biggest private publish-
inc house in China. From 1902 to 1930, it turned out 8,039 books.1 
They covered a variety of subjects but economics, law, politics 
literature and general reference books were the most numerous. In 
addition, the Commercial Press was one of the major book stores 
that supplied school text-books in pre-Communist China, It had 
its headquarters in Shanghai and 36 branch stores all over China. 
In addition it had two branch publishing houses in Peking and 
Hong Kong.2 
The Commercial Press, however, was just one of several pri-
vate publishing companies then in China, As Shanghai grew, more

private nublishing houses onened. In 1906, the Shanghai Chamber 
of Publishing Houses was formed, which had 22 publishing com-
panies as its members. In the same year, the Manchu government 
approved the first batch of modern school text-books, totaling 102 
titles. Among them, 85 were published by private publishing com-
panies.3 
The 1911 revolution established the Republic of China, and 
a new era of modernization began. Heralding this new age was the 
opening of Chung Hua Shu Chu (China Book Company) in 1912 in 
Shanghai. This company was financed by one of the wealthiest 
families in modern China, the Kungs, who were also Generalissimo 
Chiang Kai-shek's relatives. It was contracted to print the 
Chinese currency. Chung Hua became the chief competitor of the 
Commercial Press. Wherever there was a branch office of the latter, 
the former set up one too. But Chung Hua overextended itself and 
was on the brink of bankruptcy by the end of 1919. It survived 
this financial crisis by getting another Chinese tycoon to throw 
in his lot with the company. It again became the second most im-
portant publishing company after the Commercial Press in pre-
Communist China, specializing in text-books, classical writings, 
dictionaries and translations of foreign works on philosophy and 
social sciences.4 
The Republican era was marked by new cultural movements, and 
the publishing business thrived until the Sino-Japanese war. The

war not only washed out small printing companiesibut also damaged 
big companies like the Commercial Press. The Japanese troops 
burned the library, research facilities and translation unit of 
the Commercial Press in Shanghai. The library's collection of 
372,000 books and periodicals was destroyed totally in the fire. 
Japanese artillery also bombed and severely damaged the printing 
shops of the Commercial Press in Shanghai.5 
After the war the private publishing business in China had a 
brief breathing space before the civil war engulfed them once more. 
The Chinese Communists expanded their own publishing agent as they 
moved from the north to the whole Chinese mainland. This was 
Hsin Hua Shu Chu (New China Book Company). 
Hsin Hua was first established by the Communists in 1942 after 
Mao Tse-tung's declaration on "art and literature for peasants and 
workers." Hsin Hua expanded as the Red Army marched to conquer 
China. In 1945, it was already turning out 124 books with 596,000 
copies a year. Among these, 128,000 copies were works by Mao, 
Lenin, Marx and Engels and 293,000 consisted of popular reading 
matter, proselytizing the people to the Communist cause.6 After 
1949, Hsin Hua became the Party's sole agent for distributing books 
around the country. In the meantime, the Party was tightening its 
net around the private publishing industry on the Chinese mainland.

II 
Publishing Under the Communist Regime 
A survey in 1949 found that there were 315 publishing com-
panies on the Chinese mainland. Among them, 215 or 68 percent 
were in Shanghai. Peking had 44. The rest were scattered among 
24 cities, of which 13 were in the eastern coastal provinces.7 
Planning for Reform: The 1950 Conference on Publishing  
To put these publishing houses under its control, the Com-
munist regime set up the Publications Administration under the 
Committee of Cultural and Educational Affairs which, in turn, was 
directly responsible to the cabinet, the Government Administration 
Council. Under the Publications Administration were the Office of 
Director, Bureau of Editing and Censorship, Bureau of Translation, 
Bureau of Publication and Hsin Hua Book Company. 
Hsin Hua expanded rapidly from 1950 to 1951, increasing its 
branch stores from 700 to 1,100.8 In September, 1950, the Publi-
cations Administration convened the first National Conference on 
Publications. It was attended by some 320 representatives of the 
nation's publishing companies. All the resolutions adopted by the 
conference were geared toward centralizing the publishing business 
in China.

First, the conference established Hsin Hua Book Company as 
the nation's sole agent of book distribution. Its local stores be-
came centers for distribution of national and local books. Also 
the main store of Hsin Hua in Pekina was split up. Its Publishing 
section was meraed with the Bureau of Editing and Censorship to 
form the authoritative Peonle's Publishing House. The publishing 
sections of Hsin Hua's local stores also became independent local 
People's Publishing Houses. The main printing unit of Hsin Hua  
in Peking became the independent Hsin Hua Printing Company. The 
local printing units of Hsin Hua likewise were changed into in-
dependent companies. 
Thus in each province there was this triplet of People's 
Publishing House, Hsin Hua Book Company and Hsin Hua Printing 
Company. With the local Cultural Bureau as the 
these four formed a pyramidical control network 
matter of the public. A schematic presentation 
network is found in Chart I on the next paae. 
Second, the conference resolved that the publishing industry 
was to specialize. The Commercial Press and Chung Hua Book Company 
were to publish books on natural sciences, technology, agronomy, 
medicine and hygiene. Two other private publishing companies, 
San Lien (Triple Union) Book Store and E2j. Min (Enlightenment) 
Book Store were assigned to turn out books on applied social 
science, literature, history and books of medium range.* In

addition, the regime set up three new specialized publishing houses, 
the Workers' Publishing House, the Youth Publishing House and the 
People's Education Publishing House. The last was responsible for 
the nation's text-books. 
Third, the conference also resolved that all public and pri-
vate publishing companies submit long-range and periodical plans 
of publication to the Publication Administration (later to the 
Bureau of Publications). These were required to specify categories 
and quantities of books to be published. 
The above mainly concerned organizational readjustments. So 
far as the quality of publications was concerned, the conference 
in 1950 made it plain that all publications must serve politics 
and all publishing companies must eliminate "thoughts and influ-
ences of feudalism, Fascism and compradorism." This took the form 
of outright book burnings and close-downs of private publishing 
companies. 
Reform of Publishing in Action: The Book Burning Movement, 
1959-1953  
After the 1950 conference, a campaign of book burning began. 
Up to 1950, the Commercial Press had published some 15,000 
titles. By the late summer of 1950, only 8,800 remained. At the 
end of November, 1951, 1,354 remained, or 14 percent of the original 
stock. Among books on literature, history and geography, only five 
to six percent of the original collection survived. Among books 
on social science, three percent survived. The rest were either

Chuna Hua Book Company 
was first allowed to retain 2,000 books out of its 
titles.10

For this movement, Hsin Hua selected one of 
in Kwanqsi province as a model. This store ini-
tiated a campaign of "Book Exchanges and Collection for the Elimi-
nation of Poisonous Feudal Culture." In November, 1952, alone, 
2,807 pounds of books were collected and sold to Kwangchow Tung  
Hsin Paper Mill as pulp. Hsin Hua called all its branch stores to 
emulate this model and they resnonded. In some places, cadres 
beat drums and gongs to call the local people to contribute old 
books to be burned. Books collected for destruction by the authori-
ties in Chekiang province "were piled up like a mountain."12 
The Initial Results of Reform: 1955-1956  
the 
The most 
obvious result,. of reform on publishing by 1955 was 
reduction of the number of private publishina companies. For 
example, from 1951 to 1955, 53 publishina companies in Shanghai

were merged into four, operated "jointly by the state and private 
publishers."13 By 1956, there were 101 publishing houses in the 
nation as compared with 315 in 1949. "In 1956, all the legitimate 
private publishing houses in the country were merged into 19 
publishing houses jointly owned by the state and private interests. 
Private publishing houses have become an historical term."14

In mid-1956, the Communist press suddenly carried a series of 
articles criticizing the publishing industry. The main criticism 
was that there were too many unsalable books and too few books 
that were in demand. There were also charges of waste of human 
resources, bureaucracy and low quality of publications. Let us 
examine each of these in a bit more detail. 
The most serious problem was that, to quote one newspaper 
article title, "Several Million Books Become Waste Paper."15 
For 
example, 10700,000 copies of National Program for Agricultural 
Development from 1956 to 1957 (D 
aft) Illustrated were printed. 
Yet by the end of 1957, in Peking alone, 320,000 copies were put 
in warehouses and 900,000 copies were shelved in other cities. 
Thus about 72 percent of the total copies of this booklet could 
not be sold.16 
This situation was aggravated further by

senseless duplication of books:17 
The tendency for books on the same subject 
to come out like a swarm of bees is another mani-
festation that books were published blindly with 
no regard given to actual need. No less than ten 
books on worker-peasant alliance have been pub-
lished by different publishing houses. Take, for 
example, the elimination of sparrows and rats. 
The fact is that sparrows and rats in one place 
do not differ from those in other places and the 
way to get rid of them is the same everywhere. 
Yet many books on this have been published. As 
a result, the Hsin Hua Book Company's offices 
are flooded with popular books on this subject. 
This is a great waste. Since China is suffering 
from paper shortage, such a phenomenon is worthy 
of our attention. 
It was also reported that more than 50 books were published on 
hoc breeding by 27 publishing houses in Peking. The Juvenile and 
Children's Publishing House turned out a book on hog breeding. On 
the subject of managing "rural clubs," 39 books were published.18 
Actually the cause of this situation lay in the very nature 
of the triplet system imposed on the publishing industry by the 
regime. The publishing, printing and distributing units were now 
independent of each other. Each of them was responsible to the 
Bureau of Publications. Hence there was no need for the printing 
company to be concerned with the amount of copies printed. On the 
other hand, the publishing companies had no power over the number 
of copies to be printed. The distribution company, Hsin Hua, had 
the final say about this. But for Hsin Hua, as a distributing 
agent, the more books it distributed or had printed, the greater
