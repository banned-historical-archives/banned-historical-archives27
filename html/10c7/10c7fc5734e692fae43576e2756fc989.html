 DCI STATEMENT
 re
 Worldwide Wrap-up
 I plan to give you an overview of the many levels of rivalry and of actual
 and potential conflict which concern us around the world.  I plan to do this
 briefly, largely in the context of what has developed recently and what we see
 ahead.
 What I have to tell you this morning is gleaned and backed up by some 60
 intelligence estimates produced during the past year by the intelligence community
 through the National Foreign Intelligence Board.
 The Soviets have achieved strategic nuclear capabilities at least equal
 to our own and continue to further improve the accuracy and striking power of
 their offensive forces, with deployment of additional MIRVed land based and
 submarine based intercontinental missiles and BACKFIRE bombers, plus some 300
 SS-20 missiles aimed at Western Europe and the Far East.
 We see no let-up in their drive to develop and deploy still further
 improvements in their strategic arsenal.  We expect initial deployment of AWACs
 aircraft in 1983, of new MIRVed missiles for the Typhoon submarine in 1984,
 sea- and ground-launched cruise missiles as early as 1983 and an air-launched
 cruise missile in about 1985, solid propellant missiles for mobile deployment
 in 1985, and a new long range B-1 type bomber in 1986.  Although there will
 always be uncertainties, it is our best estimate that, in a well-executed
 strike, they could destroy close to 80 percent of our Minuteman silos today,
 and over 90 percent by the mid-1980s.

 The Soviets are upgrading missile defenses at Moscow, constructing new
 large radars and developing new ABM systems and components.  This will give
 them several options for widespread ABM deployment in the late 1980s.  Even if
 such a missile defense could potentially be overcome by an attacking force, it
 would create major uncertainties about the effectiveness of a US retaliatory
 strike.
 In strategic air defenses, we estimate that by the mid-1980s the Soviets
 will have deployed in large numbers a variety of systems--interceptors,
 SAMs, and AWACs--that will give them a much greater technical capability to
 engage low-altitude planes and cruise missiles.
 The magnitude of Soviet space programs gives ominous indications of future
 military applications in space.  They are working on antisatellite systems
 which can destroy or interfere with US satellites.  We believe their objective
 to be the establishment of permanently manned space stations with weapon systems
 employing directed-energy technology.
 Overriding these force development programs, the Soviets emphasize command,
 control, and communications (C3) as critical to nuclear warfighting.  Their
 own command systems are highly survivable as the result of hardening, mobility,
 and redundancy.  At the same time, we believe they have the capabilities to
 destroy or interfere with most major elements of the US tactical warning and
 attack assessment system, and may be able to severely degrade command and
 control of our nuclear forces.
 All the evidence indicates that the Soviets are attempting to prepare their
 leaders and military forces for the possibility of having to fight a nuclear
 war, and are training to be able to maintain control over increasingly complex
 conflict situations.  They are well aware that the course of a nuclear conflict
 will probably not go according to plans.  But they believe that preparations
 in force structure, doctrine and training to continue operations after a nuclear
 attack is the best way to deter one and will limit damage and raise the prospects
 for a favorable outcome if a nuclear conflict should develop.
 In conventional forces, Warsaw Pact forces outnumber NATO by 2 to 1 in
 divisions and tanks and 2 1/2 to 1 in combat aircraft.  The Warsaw Pact
 divisions are smaller, but they are more heavily armed.  The past few years
 have widened the numerical disparity and eroded the qualitative edge NATO
 once had.  Most of the recent improvements have been to Soviet forces.  Moscow's
 East European allies, which account for about half of the initially available
 Pact forces, have equipment which is obsolete relative to the Soviets and NATO.
 The Soviet Union would depend heavily on its Warsaw Pact allies at least
 in the early stages of a war with NATO.  Poland provides 15 divisions, about
 25% of the Pact's forces, and controls critical lines of communications between
 the Pact's forward based forces and Moscow's primary reinforcement base.  The
 Soviets are likely to be reluctant to risk military encounter with NATO until
 their interests in Poland are fully assured.
 In the technological race, there is the constant threat of a breakthrough
 which could tip the strategic balance against us.  The Soviets have some 40
 weapon design bureaus with a capacity to accommodate over 200 new or modified
 systems in a ten-year period.  We have evidence of some 150 programs in
 development, of which about 40 are for space and 30 are associated with
 strategic weapons.  We see a new modern tank, advanced countermeasures to our
 anti-tank weapons, and much the same thing in air attack and air defense weaponry
 and countermeasures.

 A community intelligence estimate just completed concludes that the
 Soviets have provided lethal chemical warfare agents including yellow rain
 to Laos, Kampuchea and Afghanistan, either directly or through the transfer of
 technical know-how.  This demonstration of a will to use their chemical warfare
 arsenal through their own forces or those of their allies poses a serious threat
 to the US and its allies.
 During this year we have established that the increasing sophistication,
 accuracy, power, impenetrability and countermeasure capability of Soviet
 weapons, against which we must defend ourselves, is based on our own expenditures
 in research and development to a far greater degree than we had ever dreamed.
 The Soviets conduct a massive far-flung and well organized effort to get
 technology from the West through trade, theft, illegal purchase, espionage,
 scientific exchanges and study programs.  This has given them a huge free ride
 on our military R&D and on our civilian technology.  We have paid for much of
 the vastly increased military threat which will now require us to increase our
 military spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over this decade.
 This expanding Soviet military power will back up growing aggressiveness
 in seeking enhanced political and economic influence on a worldwide scale.  In
 the military domain they continue to improve their ability to project power
 over considerable distances.  This was seen in moving tanks and other heavy
 weapons to supply Cuban forces in Angola and Ethiopia.
 We know the Soviets have examined exercise scenarios calling for the
 introduction of large Soviet forces into Iran, planning to occupy the country
 over a six-week period.  In the military districts opposite Iran they maintain
 23 divisions, with 13 additional divisions available in their strategic reserve.
 We estimate that within a month or so they could prepare a force of 10-20
 divisions for operations in Iran.

 However, although the Soviets have the world's largest airborne force,
 Moscow's capability to project and support those forces beyond contiguous
 areas is currently constrained by a shortage of long-range transports and
 their inability to provide fighter cover for operations far from the USSR.
 They have only enough aircraft to move one airborne division at a time.  We
 estimate the Soviets have the capability to airlift an airborne division of
 7,000 men and their equipment to the Middle East in some 600 sorties over a
 period of several days.  They could sealift a motorized rifle division with
 12,000 men and 200 tanks to the region in two weeks.  This would be beyond the
 range of Russian-based tactical airpower and without basing near the intended
 operational area, the Soviets could conduct military operations only against
 light opposition.
 Beyond the direct reach of its military power, Moscow, with its proxies
 and clients, Cuba, Vietnam, East Germany, Libya and North Korea, seeks power
 and influence in the Third World through a sophisticated mix of tactics
 including traditional diplomacy, aid to revolutionary groups, active disinfor-
 mation measures and extensive arms aid.  All the problems and conflicts around
 the world do not originate in Moscow, but the Soviets and their associates are
 skillful and diligent in finding and exploiting opportunities to weaken the
 United States and separate it from its friends and allies.
 The Soviets in 1980 sold about one-third more arms to the Third World
 than we did.  They offer better terms and more speedy delivery.  This is a
 drastic shift from the late 1970s when we sold twice as many arms as they did.
 Moscow's ability to quickly meet its clients' needs for arms was shown last
 year in Cuba, where Soviet arms deliveries more than tripled from about 20,000
 to over 60,000 tons.  The number of Soviet military advisors in the Third World

 continues to grow, now numbering almost 16,000.  This is four times as many
 as 1965 and double the number in 1975.  Arms sales now account for over 16%
 of Soviet hard currency earnings, second only to oil and energy exports.
 Moscow also combines traditional diplomacy and subversion to undermine hostile
 government and to befriend leftist ones.  Almost 8,000 Soviets are assigned to
 official Soviet installations in the Third World.  About one quarter of those
 are KGB and GRU intelligence officers.  At the same time, Moscow's involvement
 in the Third World is becoming increasingly costly and is generating its own
 counteraction.  The USSR and its clients are now bogged down in five major
 counterinsurgency campaigns (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique)
 which they are having a hard time winning and Soviet economic assistance to
 its clients becomes more and more burdensome.
 Now let's look at specific areas starting with the Middle East.
 For Egypt, failure to regain the Sinai from Israel in April would be a
 serious setback.  There are misgivings in Israel but we expect that Begin will
 be able to meet his Sinai commitment, even though it is clear that Mubarak
 intends a gradual warming of relations with the Arab world.  Mubarak has made
 it clear that he intends to re-establish economic and diplomatic relationships
 with the Soviet Union and open up arms supply relationships with France and
 probably other countries.  In this, a primary objective will be to reduce the
 domestic cost of the perception of exclusive dependence on the United States,
 which he believes contributed to fundamentalist disenchantment with Sadat.
 The prospect of bridging the gap between Egypt and Israel on Palestinian
 autonomy is not promising.  Egypt wants an autonomy agreement that gives the
 West Bank Arabs sufficient power and responsibility to attract broad Palestinian
 support.  The Israelis want an agreement that restricts the powers of the
 Self Governing Authority to administrative matters and leaves control of the
 territory and all key security issues with Israel.  If Israel does go through
 with the Sinai withdrawal, Begin may follow up by establishing stronger control
 over the West. Bank.  This is a delicately balanced situation which can be upset
 by changes in mood and as yet unseen circumstances particularly in Lebanon
 where the Israelis consider the continued presence of increasingly well armed
 Fedayeen a threat to their security.  They are poised to eliminate this threat,
 and to assist their Lebanese Christian allies with a massive strike into southern
 and central Lebanon if there is significant provocation.  Such a strike could
 involve combat with Syrian forces as well.  The likelihood of a Soviet inter-
 vention in support of Syria is slim--especially if conflict is confined to
 Lebanon-but as time goes by the Syrians will continue to strengthen their
 military and political ties with the USSR.
 With the exception of continued leftist insurgency in North Yemen supported
 by Soviet-supported South Yemen, the prospects for stability in the Arabian
 Peninsula remain good over the next year.  There is no detectable organized
 opposition to the Saudi regime.  Should Iran predominate in its conflict with
 Iraq, we are likely to see renewed political agitation in the Shia areas of
 the Persian Gulf.  We have already seen support from the the Iranian regime
 for a coup in Bahrain with its predominantly Shia population.  The end game of
 the Iran-Iraq war might also lead to further attacks on oil-related targets in
 both countries and possibly on the Arab side of the Gulf.
 In Iran, the clerical regime has significantly consolidated its control
 during the past six months, and appears to have broken the main strength of
 the principal opposition group, the leftist Mujahedin.  The standing and power
 of the Revolutionary Guards has been enhanced.  Also, there appears to be

 increasingly frequent collaboration between the Soviets and the Islamic
 Republican Party--particularly in arms procurement and probably security
 matters.  What we may be contending with in a year's time is not a power vacuum,
 as we had feared, but a strengthened fundamentalist central regime with increas-
 ingly closer Soviet ties.  Iran looks increasingly like Libya and other pro-Soviet
 Third World countries.
 In Afghanistan, things are going badly for the Soviets.   Soviet soldiers
 in the cities do not leave their barracks at night and the Soviet road convoys
 are confined to the main roads and sometimes required to stay off them for
 days at a time.  The insurgents control 60% of the country.  Recently, the
 Soviets increased their military strength there by 5,000-10,000 men.  For the
 Soviets to crush the insurgency and more effectively limit insurgent support
 across the borders, the Soviets would probably need at least 300,000 additional
 men.
 Pakistan, while nervous about pressure from Russia and potential pressure
 from India, remains firm in quiet support of the Afghan resistance.
 India has a decisive military superiority over Pakistan in virtually all
 areas.  The planned US delivery of 40 F-16s to Pakistan over the next five
 years will not significantly alter India's overwhelming air superiority.
 In Libya, an apparent assassination attempt on Qadhafi last December
 highlights his vulnerability to an unpredictable act of this nature.  During
 the fall, Libya, Ethiopia, and South Yemen entered into a pact to threaten
 Sudan, Somalia, and North Yemen, all of them friendly to the US and economically
 and militarily very wobbly.  This, in turn, could in time constitute a threat
 to Saudi Arabia and possibly Oman.  Sudan is particularly vulnerable to Libyan
 Approved For ReleaseT200075/05RS1 I C__ 11.4 RIDP8    049ROO1002520002-5

 subversion.  Libya's withdrawal from Chad last November is probably only temporary.
 The withdrawal was motivated by Qadhafi's desire to ensure the success of his role
 as chairman of the Organization of African Unity that he will assume next July.
 There are not many states in Africa which do not find themselves threatened
 or heavily influenced by some combination of Eastern Bloc arms, Libyan money or
 Cuban troops.  We see Libya moving in West Africa threatening Niger, Mali, and
 Togo, seeking influence with the new military government in Ghana, developing
 Benin as a base from which to spread subversion in West Africa by using dissidents
 brought from other West and Central African states and trained in Libya.  Morocco
 faces severe pressure with economic problems arising from poor harvests and
 heavy unemployment in Casablanca, and desert nomads in the Western Sahara, known
 as Polisarios, knocking its planes out of the air with Soviet SAMs funded by Libyan
 money.
 There are 13,000 Cuban troops and 1,700 Soviet military advisors in Ethiopia.
 Most of the Cubans are in the Ogaden region near Somalia.  Libya trains and assists
 Somali dissidents for use against the Somali government.
 In Angola, there is a weak economy and 25,000-30,000 Cubans, 75% of whom
 are military, together with 2,000-3,000 Soviet and East German advisors.
 The struggle for Southern Africa is being played out mainly in northern
 Namibia and southern Angola, where South African military forces are arrayed
 against the Soviet- and Cuban-backed guerrillas of SWAPO, which operate out of
 Angola.  South Africa has constrained SWAPO's ability to operate in Namibia by
 conducting aggressive cross-border operations into Angola during the past year
 and a half.  There is increasing evidence that the Soviets are making efforts
 to impede the progress of negotiations for a Namibia settlement.

 In Zaire, there is general agreement that the danger of an outbreak of
 hostilities in Shaba is greater than at any time over the past three years.
 The Soviets are ready to exploit signs of instability in Shaba and elsewhere
 in mineral-rich Zaire.
 In Central America violence reigns.  Managua has become an international
 city as Cubans, Soviets, East Germans, Bulgarians, North Vietnamese, North
 Koreans and radical Arabs support insurgency in El Salvador, Guatemala and
 Honduras and develop Nicaragua into a superpower on a Central American scale.
 Nicaragua with a population of
 2 1/2 million is on the way to military power which will dominate surrounding
 countries with a population of 18 million.   Somoza had a national guard of
 11,000 at the height of the Sandinista insurgency.  The country is now
 divided into seven military districts and                                    2 X1
 built on a model seen in Cuba, for each of these seven militi  l
 districts.  We see an army of 20,000 and a militia of 20,000 being steadily
 increased, with an announced goal of 50,000 in the army and 200,000 in the
 and 152 mm. artillery.

 dominant Cuban influence in Nicaragua is reflected in Havana's nearly 6,000
 advisers, some 1,800 of whom are military/security personnel.  With guidance
 from Cuban and East German security personnel, a block by block organization
 just like in Cuba is being imposed along with increasing repression of the
 leading moderates, intellectuals, opposition politicians, businessmen and
 independent media.

 All this is generating a growing number of dissidents within Nicaragua.
 Nicaraguans who have exiled themselves in Honduras and Costa Rica are now close
 to 30,000.  Indians on the isolated east coast have been attacked and their
 villages razed.  As a result, thousands have crossed into Honduras to join the
 exiles.   The Sandinistas' mounting concern about raids by anti-regime bands
 operating largely from Honduras increases the likelihood that Managua will
 move decisively against anti-Sandinista camps in that country.
 In El Salvador, some 5,000 armed insurgents are locked in a war of attrition
 against government forces numbering 24,000.  The insurgents are supplied with
 arms and trained leaders by air and sea from Nicaragua, smuggled by land through
 Honduras, and controlled through a communications network operated from Nicaragua.
 The El Salvador government's land reform and other economic measures are being
 implemented but are seriously impeded by the civil war.  Real and threatened
 attacks on economic targets reduce investment faster than economic assistance
 can be provided.  The failure of last year's final offensive to spark a
 popular uprising forced the guerrillas to adopt more modest short-term goals,
 while counting on economic sabotage, mounting armed forces' casualties, and
 international condemnation of the government to tip the balance in their favor
 over the longer term.  The guerrillas' current priority is to disrupt the
 28 March elections.  They got a big lift from the recent night time sabotage
 job which destroyed a large portion of the government's air force at a major
 airport near San Salvador.  This is likely to provide additional steam to the
 insurgents' plan to escalate small unit attacks on power, transportation and
 other economic targets to damage the economy and intimidate voters away from
 the polls.

 Guerrilla activity in Guatemala has increased sharply since last fall,
 reflecting a major growth in the strength of the insurgents, whom we now estimate
 to number some 4,500.  The Cubans and Nicaraguans are also laying the groundwork
 for an eventual insurgency in Honduras and are accelerating guerrilla training.
 The force of these insurgencies, the concerted nature of their external support,
 and the magnitude of the Nicaraguan military buildup is creating increasing
 concern throughout Latin America as witnessed by the recent vote in the Organi-
 zation of American States overwhelmingly supporting the election plan of the
 government in El Salvador, by the opposition voiced by the South American
 states to Mexican and French expresssions of support for the insurgents in
 El Salvador, and by the more recent call by Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador
 for assistance from Colombia, Venezuela and the United States against the
 threat they perceive from their joint neighbor, Nicaragua.
 Going to the Orient, the Chinese leadership continues to plan for its
 own succession.  Although the aging Deng Xiaoping remains preeminent, his
 economic development policies favoring agriculture and light industry are
 producing modest results at best.  Moreover, Deng and his allies must still
 restore institutions damaged during the Mao era and build support for a reform
 program that minimizes the role of ideology.  Some military leaders and many
 middle-level bureaucrats have reservations about these policies.  If a smooth
 succession to Deng is implemented, Soviet capabilities to expand their influence
 at China's expense will be minimized; a failed succession, on the other hand,
 would present the Soviets with tempting opportunities.  China-US relations
 remain heavily influenced by Taiwan.  As a result, mutually acceptable management
 of the Taiwan arms sale issue tops the Chinese-US agenda for 1982.

 The military stalemate in Kampuchea has led to increased political
 maneuvering among Communist and non-Communist resistances forces and their
 supporters outside Kampuchea.  Although the military balance still favors
 Vietnam (180,000) and their Kampuchean puppets (15-20,000), they are unable
 to consolidate control.  Singapore and Thailand are pressing for a loose
 coalition of Communist and non-Communist resistance forces with the objective
 of forcing Hanoi to seek a political solution.  Both the Soviets and the
 Chinese also have equities in Vietnam and Indochina.  The Soviets keep
 Vietnam afloat economically by contributing $2-3 million per day and gain
 the use of facilities in Cam Ranh Bay.  The Chinese, for their part, continue
 to support the resistance forces while occasionally threatening to "teach
 Vietnam a second lesson" along their common border.  These measures are
 designed to force the Vietnamese out of Kampuchea and the Soviets out of
 Vietnam, but they are unlikely to succeed soon.
 Of all these arenas of rivalry, in the long run the relative economic and
 political performance of the free societies and the command societies may be
 the most relevant and critical.  Third World countries are finding that military
 aid from the Soviet Union does not solve their pressing economic problems.
 Moscow's proxies--Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Angola, and Nicaragua--have
 become economic basket cases.  The world has witnessed the failure of the
 Communist system in Poland.  The prospect is that the Polish military will
 find it more difficult to govern than it was to decapitate the Solidarity
 movement which is likely to continue as a powerful force if only in passive
 resistance.
 A Soviet Union running out of hard currency will face growing financial
 demands to keep things going not only in Poland, but in Cuba, Vietnam, and

 other satellites.  Within Russia, for three years in a row, overall economic
 growth was 1% to 2% and the harvest failure got worse each year.  Growth is
 slowing in the labor force, in investment, in labor productivity, in primary
 energy production, and in overall industrial output.       Economic problems have
 brought a growing social malaise, with rising alcoholism, higher labor turnover,
 more corruption and black market activities, and growing resentment among the
 increasing Moslem and non-Russian population against Moscow's domination.  A
 continuation of a 4% annual increase in Soviet military outlays while economic
 growth remains in the 2% range can only squeeze consumption, worker productivity
 and investment still harder.  What we have been witnessing in Poland during
 the last three months may well symbolize the ultimate failure of the command
 economy, proof that it cannot work without brutality and repression.
 On the other side of the curtain, in Western Europe, unemployment, social
 dissidence and political tension will run high.  The political turn to the
 left in France and Greece seems likely to compound and further complicate
 these tensions.  The way Europe balances its commitment to security against the
 Soviet military threat and its temptation to ease growing unemployment by credits
 to a Soviet Union running out of hard currency seems likely to be at the heart
 of the East-West relationship.  As we look around the world, it appears that
 only the market economies of East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong
 and Singapore are doing well.  In addressing the concerns I have outlined, we
 have a heavy stake in how well the nations of the Atlantic Alliance and East
 Asia mesh their economic and political gears and outperform the command economies
 in the economic and political arena.
