 [Text]  i?ioscow, June 7,  ['TASS)--Follows the full text of the speech by Leonid
 L+re:a:nev, the head of the CPSU delegation at thu international meeting of communist
 and '.aorkcrs parties in Moscow, on June 7,  1969,
 ~cr comrades,  the principal item on  the agenda of our meeting; is  the question of
 the task;; of the struggle against imperialism at the present stage and of unity of
 aci.ion of communist and workers parties and of all anti-imperialist forces,   From our
 poin.  of view, the essence of the problems covered by this agenda is clearly formulated
 in -Lae draft of the main document,  The CPSU Central Committee considers that the
 draft, as well as the other documents which we shall have to examine, conforms to
 the  present-day tasks of the communist movement,
 [de are convinced, comrades,  that our meeting, at which most of the communist parties
 in the world are represented, will play a major role in formulating the actions
 of tae fighters against imperialism.   It will contribute towards uniting the entire
 world front of the forces  championing peace,  democracy,  national independence,  and
 socialism,
 At the same time, we are confident that the work of this meeting and the joint
 struggle for the aims which it will chart will help to surmount the difficulties
 that have emerged in the communist movement and strengthen its unity on the
 principled foundation of Marxism-Leninism.;  All this will still further enhance
 the prestige and influence enjoyed by communists among the broad masses of working
 people and all progressive forces in the world,
 One,.  The Present International Situation and the Tasks of the Anti-imperialist
 Straggle,
 Comrades, a little under nine years have passed since representatives of the
 communist parties of all continents had last gathered in order jointly to map out
 the further course of their revolutionary struggle,   This has been an extremely
 Important and eventful period,   To us communists it has brought many successes and
 opened up further possibilities for achieving the great aims of our movement.   At
 the same time, this period has brought serious problems and complications.
 L-'e have very closely followed the speeches made here in which the comrades touched
 a numcer of major issues of the anti-imperialist struggle.  We have been
 instructed by the Central Committee of the CPSU to expound here, in the light of
 the basic ;,ask to which the meet_:',-:g is devoted, our partyes viewpoint over the past

 ?Tne 1960's have: brought considerable changes into the alignment of forces in that
 part of the world...   In the period, 44 foemer colonies won independence,  But more
 h.han 35 million people remain in col. ,vial slavery.  The peoples of the last colonies
 are  waging a  1hexc tic,  as a rule;  a."r-lt'C;.  struggle for  the1.r  liberation,    Soviet  Comnunlsss

 most important crendio.ions which make such development possible is cooperation betwecn
 the  progressive   young States  and      the  socialist  countries,
 The ..'sates which have emba-okad on non--capitalist develo,pmne are mating a tangible
 contribution to the ante-imperialist st-:cuggle.   It is true that these scases are still
 few  and that  i;hc'-re are many difficulties  in their dev,"lopisent.   Apart  from  the serious
 internal problems which remain, it should be borne in mind that it. is above all  against
 the prog essive states  of Africa and Asia that the subversive policy of  imperialism,
 on tnese  continents is directed.   But whatever the  difficulties, they cannot minimise
 the importance  of  the  cardinal  fact  that  a  start  has  been made  in a  fundamentally
 new direction for,- the development of the newly independent countries,          And their
 example will carry the greater conviction the more headway the revolutionary-democratic
 countries make in their economic and cultural development, the fuller the advantages
 of non-capitalist development are revealed.
 Communists regard assistance to and support of these young countries as one of the
 most important tasks  of their foreign policy.   The work the communist and workers
 parties of the socialist countries have been doing in this direction is generally
 known.  Considerable possibilities in this respect are also open to the fraternal par-
 ties i.n the aeveloped capitalist countries.

 an,  a rei;n of   terror has been instituted                 ain'at all progressive forces.   The
 imperialist states use  the      territories of  many of these countries for their af,g e?                        ve
 purposes, notably,      for military bases.    T?e           conditions  of   tr g ie  for Cor.:rcunlst5
 and their all'es  in these countries      are  in many respoct similar to the conditions of
 the  colonial  period.
 ho:-:ever,  w:n.at  can  be  said  about  a considerable , _r t  of      the  states  liberated from
 colons l    dependence  is,  perhaps,  that their further path has not yet been clearly
 defined. An intense struggle            for the  future              in  these  countries  between the
 progressive  forces  and           internal  reaction  supported     by  imperialism.    In these  countries,
 the process of     internal  social  division  is            deepening.  The  working  people  are  ever
 more actively demanding far-reaching reforms capable of providing                     answers  to burring
 funda:.:e_n?:al problems.          On the other hard, the top crust of the national bourgeoisie,
 guided by its class interests, resists social progress and the pursuit of any con-
 sistent anti-imperialist line,                                           An increasingly acute class struggle is unfolding on
 this basis.
 The tasks now facing the newly independent countries are complex and diverge.   It is
 a question of consolidating the independence they have won, to secure the extablis:.ment
 of an  independent national. economy and  to overcome  the legacy of backwardness.   t-1
 t,hi.s can be achieved only through progressive social  development and consistent
 stru ;;;le a;;, i.nst imperialism, throu;_;h an alliance with the socialist countries and
 the International working-.class movement.
 11.:pot ~nlcsm is  actively working; to  oiow down  the  advance towards  independence and
 suchel  pro;ress,  to keep its former colonies writ'.in  the framework of the capitalist
 sad to retain them a   objects of exploication,  even if  in modified fours.
 l.'ith  their cake on nationali'ari and separatism,  the imperialist forces  are trying to
 wcahon   trio developing countries from within to range them against each other and
 to hamper their contacts with          the socialist world.
 Ail  this        is  a most grave  threat to the future  of  the young independent countries.
 Their peoples are gradually coming to realize that neocolonialism     no lesser danger
 than colonialism.   This means         that ahead  lie most acute batt"les between the fighters
 for read freedom and those who would like to fetter the young national states
 wit:. the chairs of a new bondage.     In this  struggle,  the formation of a sound
 alliance of all progressive, all anti-imperialist forces acquires crucial importance.
 The central question of the revolutionary process of Asia and Africa today is that
 of the ..land of the peasantry, which there constitutes a majority of the population.
 The peasants in that purr of the world are a mighty revolutionary force, but in most
 cases  they  are an  elemental  force,  with  all  t.e  ensuing  vacillations  and  ideological
 and political contradictions.      Nor could it have been otherwise for the time being,,,
 because the great majority of the peasantry still lives in conditions of monstrous
 poverty and denial of rights, surviving feudal and sometimes even prefeudal relations.
 The experience of the revolutionary movement in various parts of the world has shown
 that the surest way of effectively involving the peasants  in the  struggle against
 imperialism, for true social progress, is to establish a strong alliance between them
 and the working class.   That is also the  task in the zone of national liberation.

 The al*;iance of the working class and the peasantry will rake it possible to carry
 the national  liberation revolutions to the end and totally eliminate-  the lega;:y of
 colonialism,  and make  the movement;  to  socialism more  confidence  and  purposeful.
 great  res,;Donsibility devolves  on us    communists  in  this  sphere.    Tremendous
 attention  to the  proletariat's peasant ally, and additional  elaboration  of  some
 aspects of  strategy  and  tactics in  appiic:a tion  to  the  specific  conditions in  the
 former  colonial  countries  is  demanded  of  the  communist movement.
 In present-day conditions, the problem of relations between the working class and
 the peasantry in the former colonial countries is largely of an international nature.
 It is  a question of consolidating tee alliance of the whole international working
 class with the peasantry,    with all the working people of the young liberated
 countries.   This  includes  the strengthening of the revolutionary alliance between
 the national liberation movement,     the young national states and the countries of
 the socialist community,  and the promotion. of the closest ties between the fighters
 for national liberation and the communist parties coming forward as the vanguard of
 the  international working class.
 In this context we attach great importance to contacts and ties between the communist
 parties  and the revolutionary-democratic parties  in the developing countries.   These
 parties and organizations  are our follow-fighters  in the struggle  against
 imperialism,  for social progress,   ft present,  the C?SU has contacts  and ties --'th
 18 national-democratic parties,      whi'.a Soviet mass organizations have connections with
 democratic  organizations  in all    countries  of  that Dart  of  the  world. We  believe
 everything has to be done so that the relations between the communist parties and
 the revolutionary-democratic parties continue to grow stronger.
 Thus,  comrades, a realistic assessment of toe present state of affairs in the world,
 a comparison between the development of imperialisn,  on the one hand,  and of         all
 the forces opposing it,  on the other,  warrants  only one conclusion:   The main lines
 of world development continue to be determined by the activity of the forces of
 revolution and socialism, of the peace forces and the nationa'. liberation movement,
 Communists,  of  course,   refuse  to  bo comp ac  1'v and  smuj            `'ie  are  well  aware  T;mat
 ahead  of  us lies  an  intense  struggle  in  the most  Oive_'se  -ector-s.           Ana tee  role   Of

 For  tee  communist  and  workers  parties  the  struggle against    "imperialism   is  inseparable
 from the struggle for our ultimate goals, for the winning of political. power by
 the working class in alliance witn all the other contingents of the working people,
 for socialism,     We believe  the cohesion of the communists of the world,          the
 strengthening of the alliance of all the anti-imperialist forces to be the key to
 success.

 Somo  Problems of the Communist Movement and Unity of Action in the Struggle
 ~..    Imperialism,
 c;,:.rades, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regards with the greatest attention
 rd respect the great work being carried on by our foreign comrades.
 `, e historical experience of many countries,  the e.  .ricnce of the  class struggle has
 given convincing evidence of how necessary the ac'.  -ity of the communist parties     for
 and  how fruitful this  activity  is  for  so- 'al  developI:nent.    Guided  by  Ma:exi:t-
 Leninist theory, the communist parties show the peoples the road to the communist
 future.   They rally the peoples to the struggle and steadfastly march in the vanguard
 of the             ii-,ass  movements  for  the great goals  of social progress.        Communists:  are  always
 in the front rank of the fighters for the vital rights of the working people, for
 pace.   They carry high the invincible banner of the socialist revolution.
 Soviet  Communists,  whose path to the socialist revolution was complex and difficult,
 are well aware of the tension, the determination and flexibility, steadfastness of
 spirit and readiness at any moment to sacrifice everything for the party's cause that
 the revolutionary fighters confronting the class enemy must constantly display.
 These qualities of communists are of  special importance in our time, a time of intense
 and dogged class battles,
 h  successes which the: communist  ?artier have achieved are incontestable.   But our
 weeting is right to concentrate its attention on unresolved tasks, on the new
 possibilities in the anti-imperialist struggle, on the difficulties that arise in its
 path.   Such difficulties do exist, and some of them spring from the state of affairs
 in our movement itself, which is going through a difficult period of its development.
 Unity has been seriously disrupted in some of its links.   Some fraternal parties have
 suffered setbacks and even defeats.
 There are various reasons for these difficulties.   One  of them is connected with the
 fact that in present-day conditions, when a tremendous social break-up of the pillars
 of the old world is taking place under the  onslaught of socialism and all the
 revolutionary forces,  there is growing resistance from the bourgeoisie.   To safeguard
 its positions it strives to use all the economic and political possibilities of state-
 monopoly capitalism.                                    In the capitalist countries, anti-communism has been elevated
 to the status of state policy.   To erode the  communist and the whole revolutionary
 movement from within is now one of the most important directions of the class strategy
 of imperialism.
 Another reason for the difficulties that have arisen is that fresh millions of people
 belonging to various social strata are being drawn into vigorous political action.
 Many of them enter politics with a great store of revolutionary energy, but with rather
 hazy ideas about how to solve the problems agitating them.   Hence the vacillations--the
 swings from stormy political explosions to political passivity, from reformist illusions
 to anarchic impatience.   All this tends to complicate the activity of the communist
 parties, multiplies the number of their tasks, and increases the volume of demand on
 their practical work,   in this situation, communists must display Marxist  Leninist
 firmness and loyalty to principle and a creative approach to the problems of social
 development, if they are to keep control of developments, and tackle their problems in
 the light not only of short-term requirements but also of the long-term interests of
 the revolutionary movement.   Otherwise, grave errors in policy are inevitable.
 We cannot afford to ignore the divergences existing in the  communist movement today and
 pretend they do not exist,  These differences have been largely caused by the penetra-
 tion into the communist movement of revisionist influences both of a right and of a
 "left" nature.

 And  these  influences are making themselves  felt not only  in th;?  snncro  of  "pure"
 theory.     Revisionism  in  theory  paves  the  '.day to opportunist practices, which inflect
 direct harm on the ant i-.:np rialst struggle    Revisionism is,  after all,      a de~jar?tue
 from proletarian crass positions, a surstetut-:on for ~'ar?xism-Leninism of all sorts of
 bourgeois and petty-bourgeois  concepts,  old and modernistic.
 We share    the  stand of the  fraternal parties which in their decisions draw ettontion
 to the need for resolutely combating, this dange_.   The communist parties        Justly
 believe that the interests of their can cohesion, the interests of the ..hole anti-
 imperialis,; movement insistently demand an intensif_cat ion of the struggle against
 revisionism and both right and  "left" opportunism       principled stand on this  .issue
 has  always been a most  important  condition for strengthening a party's political
 positions and has always mobilised and enhanced the activity of communists in the
 clear struggle.
 Right-wing opportunism means a slide-down to liquidationist positions and to
 reconciliation with  social-democracy  in  policy  and  ideology,  in  socialist countries,
 opportunism goes  to  the  extent  of  repudiating  that  the  Marxist-Leninist
 p:r?ty should play the  leading, role, and this can lead to surrender of the positions
 won by socialism and to capitulation to the anti-socialist  forces.
 "Left-wing" opportunists,  behind a barrage of ultrarevolutionary verbiage, push the
 masses  into adventurist action,  and the party onto the sectarian path,  which paralyses
 its  ability  to rally the  fighters against             imperialism.   For all  their distinctions,
 deviations  from Marxism-Leninism to the  right or to the               "left" ultimately result
 in sirailarly harmful consequences:   They weaken the militancy of the communist parties
 and undermine the revolutionary positions of the working class and the unity of the
 anti-immperialist forces,
 A frequent feature of "left" and right-wing opportunism is concessions to nationalism,
 and sometimes even an outright switch to nationalistic positions.   Lenin showed up
 this connection a long time ago.   He wrote,  "The ideological and political affinity,
 co:".necticn, and even identity between opportunism and social-nationalism is beyond
 doubt."   (Collected Works, vol. 21, p. 154)
 Of course,  the  struggle against opportunism and nationalism and one  country or
 another is,  above  all,  a  sphere within the  competence  of the fraternal party concerned.
 i:o party can advance successfully unless it consistently and resolutely upholds the
 purity of Marxist-Leninist principles.   But it is also true that when this struggle
 is abandoned in some sector of our movement,  it is reflected or. the movement as a
 whole .
 Trio  stand taken by the leadership of the  Communist    Party of China offers a striking
 example of the harm that can be done to the common cause of the communists by a
 departure from Marxism-Leninism and a break with internationalism.
 Frankly speaking,  just recently we had no intention at all of touching on this
 lion at the meeting.   However, the events of the recent period, particularly the
 nature of the decisions taken by the Ninth Congress of the CPC, have forces us to deal
 With: it.   There has arisen a new situation which is having a grave negative influence
 cn the 4hole world situation and the conditions of the struggle of the anti-imperialist
 Forces.
 Peking's present political platform,  as you are well aware,  was not  shaped either today
 or yesterday.   Almost 10 years ago Mao Tse-tung and his supporters mounted attacks on
 the principles of scientific communism.

 Of  course,  noisy statements  arc.  a  far  cry from      actual  possibili.tieo.    The Soviet  Union
 has enough strength to stand up for itself, and the Soviet people have strong nerves--tri:
 will not be frightened by shouting.   Eat the direction of official Chinese propaganda
 speaks for itself.
 in the  light of all this,  the policy to ..:ilitarlse China takes  on a specif_c meaning.
 We  cannot help comparing the  feverish military preparations with the  farnirg of
 chauvinistic feelings hostile.  ;to the socialist  eodii'cries,  with the general apps?oach. by
 the Chinese  leaders  to the problems of war and peace  in the mouern epoch.

 Exercising its leading role,  the party does  everything to  enable the working ,?ec-ie
 actively to  influence  the       ing and imple-:entin   of state policy and    ves  them
 every opportunity to display initiative, a pioneering spirit.   The party resolutely
 fights bureaucratic tendencies against which the administrative apparatus is not
 fully guaranteed under socialism either.
 Enhancement  of  the  party's  leading  role  increases its  responsibility  for everything
 done in the country, for the present and the future of the Soviet state.  And this
 means that the party itself mast develop, sustain the militancy of its ranks,  and
 reinforce their ideological and organizational unity.   In the little more than eiEht
 years which have passed since the last meeting of communist and workers parties, the
 membership of the CPSU has     increased by more   than 4,500,000.
 it now has in its ranks almost 14 million members.  More than half of the party
 menbers are workers and peasants.  Ile attach great significance to workers holding a
 leading place in the party.  This corresponds to the class nature of our party, to
 the role and place of the working class in the life of our society.   The collective-
 farm peasantry plays a big part in the life of the party.   The party unites millions
 of trained specialists,  scientists,  workers  in culture,  and other intellectuals who
 are contributing greatly to social,   scientific, technological,  and cultural  progress.
 The growth of our party's ranks strikingly attests to the high prestige it enjoys
 among all sections of the people in our country.   The Communist Party and its home
 and foreign policy have the whole-hearted, unanimous support of the entire Soviet
 people.
 We associate the improvement of the party's work with the consistent development of
 democracy within the party,  with the undeviating application of the principle of
 democratic centralism.   All or you know how much has been and is being done along
 these lines in recent years, and what place these questions held in the decisions of
 the 20th, 21st, 22d and 23rd Congresses of the CPSU.
 Comrades, the way things are shaping out in our country, the successes in communist
 construction largely determine the scale and depth of the influence exerted by the
 Soviet Union's  foreign policy on the international  situation.   The main aims and
 trends of this policy were clearly defined in the decisions of the 23rd Congress of
 the CPSU.
 In foreign affairs the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concentrates on making -hu
 socialist world stronger today than yesterday,  and stronger tomorrow tnan today.   Th:s
 is concretely embodied in the efforts made by our state, Jointly with other socialist
 countries, to further co-operation in the political, defense, and economic spheres.
 The Soviet Union,  together with other socialist countries,  holds active positions in
 the wide and seething; front of the national liberation movement, and renders firm
 political  support and moral and material help to the peoples fighting for liberation
 The Scviet Union will  continue to give effective military and economic assistance anal
 moral and political support to the Vietnamese people in order to repulse imperialist
 aggression.   In our view, the prograr.,-ne for a political settlement of the Vietnam
 question set out in the "10 points" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietn..r
 is perfectly justified and fair, and we declare our support of it.
 Young Asian and African states invariably find support in the Soviet Union.   Our
 country co-operates with many of them in economic, scientific, technological, and
 cultural spheres and in the training of national personnel.
