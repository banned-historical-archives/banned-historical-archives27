 Aprils 12, 1967           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 not hope to make the contribution that
 otherwise would be within our power.
 I shall not add much to what the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Illinois has al-
 ready stated about the importance of
 strengthening  the  ties  between  the
 United States and Japan.  I was in Ja-
 pan about a year and a half ago, and I,
 too, appreciate the tremendous contri-
 bution which that country is making
 toward the extension of a democratic
 way of life in Asia, and the added
 strength that is thus given to our deter-
 mination and our convictions in all of
 the Orient.
 Certainly newsprint is an important
 commodity, one that is becoming more
 important as time goes on.  I, too, come
 from a State which has some timber
 stands.  Because I do, I would say to
 those from the East who are not as aware
 of the fact as some of us are that with
 the ravages of insect disease, the prob-
 lem with timber is not simply a matter
 of storing or keeping a resource for use
 at some future time. Timber has a life-
 span; it has a life cycle; it grows up.
 If it is not used at the time when it be-
 comes ripe, it is often felled by insect
 diseases, and it can be scourged by the
 ravages of fire.
 That fact lends a special importance
 to the wise observations made by the
 junior Senator from Oregon as to tak-
 ing advantage now of the opportunity
 to institute a national program that will
 contemplate the use of these resources
 on a sustained yield basis, and which
 would permit the great capability of the
 State of Oregon and other States in the
 Pacific Northwest to utilize better this
 important renewable resource.
 As we do that, as we make more jobs
 available, and as we add to the income,
 to the industry, to the prosperity, and
 to the tax base of the States in the
 Pacific Northwest, we will contribute to
 the strength of America and make pos-
 sible places for Americans to find homes
 where the air is clear and the streams
 are clean, and we do not have all of the
 problems that exist in some of our metro-
 politan areas.
 What the Senator from Oregon has
 said this morning is of great importance.
 I compliment him for his keen under-
 standing of the many ramifications of
 the problem, and I urge that the Senate
 heed and consider carefully the impor-
 tant message he has given us.
 Mr. HATFIELD.  Mr. President, I wish
 to express my appreciation to the Sen-
 ator from Wyoming [Mr. HANSEN] for his
 comments and observations.  I had the
 privilege to serve with him as a fellow
 Governor and am completely aware of
 his great leadership in the area of nat-
 ural resource development. I am proud
 to sit with him now in the back row of
 the U.S. Senate.
 Mr. FANNIN.  Mr. President, I join
 my fellow Senators in commending the
 junior Senator from Oregon.  Although
 I did not have the privilege of being
 present when he made his remarks, I
 did hear the statements by the junior
 Senator from Illinois and the junior
 Senator from Wyoming in relationship
 to his remarks.  I know of his great abil-
 ity, how articulate he is in expressing
 himself, and how dedicated he is to his
 State of Oregon.  My State, too, is
 vitally interested in the problem to which
 he referred; so I shall be eager to read
 his statement.  I again congratulate him
 for his outstanding services to his State
 and to the Nation.
 Mr. BROOKE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. HATFIELD.  I am happy to yield.
 Mr: BROOKE.  Mr. President, I am
 pleased to commend the distinguished
 junior  Senator from  Oregon  for his
 timely and informative remarks con-
 cerning the crisis confronting the timber
 industry in the State of Oregon and in
 the western part of our Nation.
 I sincerely trust that we in the Sen-
 ate will join with Senator HATFIELD in
 requesting an early meeting of United
 States and Japanese Governments and
 industry officials to review all aspects of
 the log export issue with a view to
 uniting the effort needed for remedial
 action.
 Senator HATFIELD is to be congratu-
 lated for bringing this important matter
 to the attention of the Senate.
 Mr. HATFIELD.  I thank the Sen-
 THE IBM-~ET US BEGIN
 Mr. FANNIN.  Mr. President, years
 from now when historians sit down to
 write a treatise on the 90th Congress
 they doubtless will emphasize its concern
 with foreign policy and military affairs.
 For this Congress, more so than most
 other Congresses, it seems to me, has
 focused its attention on efforts to secure
 and construst a meaningful peace in the
 world.
 Admittedly, our efforts to secure man's
 oldest dream, his natural right to be his
 own master, have been strikingly dis-
 similar.  On one hand, we have sub-
 stantially increased military aid to South
 Vietnam, a small Asian nation struggling
 for the right to determine its own des-
 tiny.  And at the same time, we have
 entered into another agreement with the
 nation that, by deed no less than word,
 is our principle adversary; and we have
 done so in the hope that it might some-
 how be a step toward peace.
 Needless to say, these were not easy
 decisions to make, either for the Presi-
 dent or for Congress.  Nor were they
 unanimously made. They involved com-
 plex and interrelated problems and men
 of good will supported each side of both
 issues, as they do even today.
 Some years ago Yale classicist Rich-
 mond Lattimore observed that the es-
 sence of Greek tragedy is not that it is                                                        world, would invite an automatic re.-

 tween good and good-an observation      to them. And our strategy has worked.
 that applies equally well to the present Nuclear peace has been maintained. But
 situation. No one knows with certainty  we are faced now with a different set

 one amoung us who does not desire the
 cessation of hostilities, not only in Viet-
 nam, but also throughout the world.
 There is no one in this Chamber who
 does not pray for better relations among
 all nations.  Nor is there a responsible
 American who does not long to curb the
 worldwide aggressiveness of what Ed-
 mund Burke, in another age, described
 as an armed doctrine.
 But, as Professor Lattimore suggested,
 the choice open to us is not clear, neither
 black nor white.  And those who view
 these decisions in terms of "war or peace"
 or "Red or dead" or "hawk or dove" do
 a great disservice to the Nation.
 But still the euphemisms are hurled
 about carelessly, often maliciously.
 This dilemma can best be illustrated
 in the present controversy of whether
 the United States should proceed to in-
 stall                                                                                           an  antiballistic  missile--ABM-
 system.                                                                                               To some, principally spokes-
 men for the administration, the deploy-
 ment of such a network, even though
 it is purely defensive in design, is viewed
 as a needless escalation of the nuclear
 arms race.  To others, including many
 military experts, some of whom are
 Members of this body, the ABM system
 is viewed as the best deterrent to a nu-
 clear war.                                                                                                  Surely, no one can say with
 assurance that those who support the
 second proposition are less concerned
 with peace than those who support the
 first; neither can one logically argue
 that those who endorse the initial prop-
 osition are less concerned with national
 defense than are those who support the
 second.  The issue is not that deducible.
 Personally, although I am neither a
 military expert nor a scientist, I am con-
 vinced of the superiority of the second
 argument: that the United States must
 undertake immediately to develop and
 deploy an effective antiballistic missile
 system.
 I take this position for two reasons.
 First, according to intelligence reports,
 Soviet Russia is already beginning to
 deploy a defense system designed to pro-
 tect its major cities against attack by
 intercontinental ballistic missiles.  And,
 second, increasing amounts of reliable
 evidence suggest apparent advances in
 the Soviet's offensive capacity, notably
 in the area of multiple warhead tech-
 nology.
 Since the beginning of the nuclear age,
 approximately  two  decades  ago,  the
 United States has preserved an uneasy
 world peace by its unquestioned superi-
 ority in strategic offensive weapons. We
 have made it clear to would-be aggres-
 sors that any sneak attack they might

 F:ESSION. L RECORD --SENATE           April   r 197
 Clearly, the decision to develop and
 deploy an. antiballistic missile system is
 a painful one for the administration to
 make, but it is a decision which must
 nevertheless be made, and made now.
 We stand once again at a crossroads in
 our efforts to deter a major nuclear war,
 and the decision to act cannot be held
 any longer in suspension.
 So far the administration has resisted
 every attempt to speed up the deploy-
 ment of an antimissile defense network,
 arguing that to do so would touch off
 the biggest and most expensive arms race
 the world has ever known.  And, accord-
 ing to this argument, when the balance
 of military strength is again stabilized,
 on the new plane so expensively pur-
 chased, the world will be less secure than
 ever.  Consequently, the administration
 has sought to end the arms and defense
 spiral   through   diplomatic   efforts,
 through negotiation.  It has atterapted
 to persuade the Russians to enter into
 an agreement banning the deployment
 of antiballistic missiles by both the
 United States and the Soviets.  But its
 efforts so far have been in vain. In fact,
 only 7 weeks ago in London, Soviet Pre-
 mier Alexei Kosygin apparently ruled out
 a ban on antiballistic missiles.
 r believe that defense systems, which pre-
 vent attacl:
 Said the Premier-
 are not the cause of the arms race, bu  con-
 stitute a factor preventing the death of peo-
 ple.
 Yet even if the Soviet Union were to
 express interest in such an agreement,
 the agreement itself must be suspect.
 Surely, the Soviet Union will not enter
 into an accord that provides for verifica-
 tion and inspection, particularly when
 verification in this field would involve
 disclosures even more sensitive than
 those involved in inspection of ther-
 monuclear explosions.  And, from. the
 standpoint of the security of the free
 world, an agreement without verification
 is totally unacceptable.  Also, there is
 the important point that my knowledge-
 able colleague, the Senator from South
 Carolina [Mr. THURMOND]  raised when
 he said:
 A piece of paper with the name of the
 Soviet Union on it is not an acceptable al-
 ternative  to  an  effective  ballistic  missile
 system.
 It is not that the distinguished Sen-
 ator, or myself or the majority of Amer-
 ican people would not like to believe the
 Russians and to take these agreements at
 face value.  It is not that at all.  It is
 rather that history has proven, by ex-
 ample after example, that Soviet oflcials
 will honor agreements only as long as
 they serve their sinister purposes to rule
 the world.
 But even if we share the administra-
 tion's opinion and optimism that Russia
 is interested in halting the arms race,
 that it will open its country to inspection
 and  verification,  and  that it can  be
 trusted to abide by the terms of the
 treaty, even if we grant all these im-
 probabilities, where does that leave the
 United States in the face of Red China's
 growing nuclear threat?  What cou:id be
 more foolish than to agree with the
 Soviet Union on a treaty banning A:BM's
 if it meant eventually facing a Com-
 rnunist China armed with sophisticated
 nuclear weapons and protected by an
 ABM system of its own?  And Red
 China's threat as a nuclear power must
 not be dismis:,ed lightly.  Indeed, De-
 fence Secretary Robert McNamara has
 conceded that the Chinese probably will
 launch a long-range, nuclear-tipped bal-
 listic missile before the start of a new
 year.
 Therefore, any agreement between the
 United States and the U.S.S.R. not to
 deploy a ballis;ic missile defense system
 would be of questionable value.  To be
 truly effective, such an agreement must
 bind all nuclear nations; and there is
 little likelihood that China, given its
 present bellicose nature, is in any way
 interested in it
 I am not suggesting the United States
 abandon its efforts to reach an accepta-
 ble   agreement.   These   negotiations
 should continue. Yet the fact remains
 that while we agonize over what to do,
 and while  th-:  administration speaks
 hopefully of an effective anti-ABM sys-
 tem treaty, the Soviets are dep::oying an
 ABM system  throughout the U.S.S.R.
 and,, at the same time, are enlarging
 their offensive ixsenal.
 Reliable    intelligence    information
 proves that the Soviets' missile defense
 system is not limited to the Moscow area,
 as  spokesmen  for  the  administration
 have thus far insisted.  Rather, the So-
 viet system reportedly rings several large
 cities and is stretched throughout the
 northeastern regions of the country, the
 corridor which U.S. land-launched mis-
 siles must travel to hit vital Russian tar-
 gets                                                    In fact, less than a month ago
 leading Soviet military leaders, includ-
 ing Gen. Pavel F. Batitsky, a deputy de-
 fense minister, boasted unqualifiedly that
 missiles fired a ; the Soviet Union would
 never reach their targets.  While that
 claim. doubtles; is an exaggeration, it
 nevertheless indicates, or certainly im-
 plies, that some Soviet officials are con-
 vinced they could protect the most vital
 parts of their farflung territory from
 attack.
 I need not remind anyone, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that the Soviets never stopped to
 consult with American authorities before
 beginning to deploy their missile defense
 network.   Unquestionably,  they  had
 previously  concluded that  the anti-
 missile  .missile                                                          would  in  some way en-
 hance  their o 'erall                                                           strategic military
 posture.  Authorities are of the opinion
 that the Soviets' decision to start, pro-
 duction on an iiBM system was made in
 1964, after they had time to analyze the
 results of their A-bomb tests of 1961-62.
 It is worthwh.le to remember that with
 those tests, which were designed in part
 to gauge the effectiveness of antimissiles
 at various altitl ides, the Soviets broke a
 pledge to the United States by ignoring a
 moratorium on nuclear explosions.
 But, however, the Soviets arrived at the
 decision to prcceed, by doing so they
 clearly rejected the assumption that U.S.
 reaction to such deployment would ne-
 gate its strate?:ic importance, whether
 that value is vie wed in political, psycho-
 logical, or milite ry terms.
 However, it is in terms of the U.S. stra-
 tegic requirements-not the Soviets'-
 that the l.,sue must finally be resolved.
 It is usefi 1. therefore, to examine the
 question  of  an  antimissile  defense
 system-N ke   X--from  the   following
 three viewpoints: First. Would it save
 lives?  Second. World it strengthen our
 deterrent 'once?  Third. Would it en-
 hance our aver all strategic position in a
 meaningfu way?
 As for sa.'ins lives, it must be acknowl-
 edged that the very best defense system
 man can ( ver hope to devise probably
 will be ina legs;ate against a nuclear at-
 tack.  And in t his regard the ABM is no
 exception.  But in light of the unavail-
 ability of a better defense network, and

 Americans an clement of hope-at least
 until such ime as we can effect a change
 in the inte:.-na tonal situation or, better
 yet, in human nature.  An adequate de-
 fense syste;n is necessary because all men
 have not accepted the teachings of the
 prophet Is, iah who warned that lasting
 peace will come only when men "beat
 their word; into plowshares, and their
 spears into priming hooks; nation shall
 not lift up sword against nation neither
 shall they earn war any more."
 In the United Skates alone, it is esti-

 deaths from 1:;0 million-the estimated
 number wr o would. die in a surprise at-
 tack if no : uch system were in force-to
 60 million- -thy is a saving of 70 million
 American lives Such an estimate can-
 not be disr iissrd lightly.  James Burn-
 ham, a higi dy respected military analyst
 with whom I mostly agree, argues against
 an antimissile defense by writing that
 there is ne  sib nificant strategic differ-
 ence between 130 million and 60 million
 casualties.  And perhaps he is right-
 strategicall '.  But Americans by and
 large have been conditioned by Haw-

 No, we can never hope to save the lives
 of all Americans, or perhaps even the
 majority of Americans; but that does not
 mean that'ae would not safeguard how-
 ever many lives as possible, within our
 capacity to do so.
 As to whether the ABM system would
 strengthen our deterrent force, the an-
 swer is aga n an unqualified "Yes."  No
 matter how gocd its own defense, no na-
 tion 'would be so foolish as to unleash
 an attack against another nation whose
 defense it  oul:d not hope to penetrate
 and whose retaliatory capacity it could
 not hope to imriobilize.  To do so, would
