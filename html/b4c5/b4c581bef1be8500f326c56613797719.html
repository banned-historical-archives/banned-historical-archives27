 Overview
 Information available
 as of 15 August 1983
 was used in this report.
 China's Sixth National
 People's Congress                                          25X1
 last year.
 China's Sixth National People's Congress (NPC), which was held from 6
 through 21 June, reaffirmed the policies of Deng Xiaoping's reform
 leadership and produced no surprises. The NPC, though billed as China's
 parliament, is essentially a rubberstamp body for decisions taken by the
 party leadership. The meeting emphasized stability, moderation, and the
 rule of law, continuing the reformers' attack on radical leftism such as
 characterized the Cultural Revolution. As is usual with NPCs, economic
 matters were the central focus. The overall tone of the Congress was, of
 course, upbeat, but the speeches showed a sober realization of the problems
 China still faces. The atmosphere was more constrained, the mood more
 conservative than the freewheeling exuberance displayed at some meetings
 purged during the Cultural Revolution.
 ? Peng Zhen as Chairman of the Sixth NPC.
 The NPC confirmed or announced several new appointments (see appendix
 D). Among the most important:
 ? Deng Xiaoping as chairman of the new Central Military Commission.
 ? Li Xiannian as President of China-a post vacant since Liu Shaoqi was
 Zhao Ziyang (see appendix G).
 In addition, two new vice premiers were named, bringing the total to four.
 The two new men, Li Peng and Tian Jiyun, are both relatively young and
 have backgrounds in energy and finance. We believe they are proteges of
 be involved in investigations of economic crimes.
 Six ministers, including the economic planning chief, were replaced. The
 Congress created a new Ministry of State Security and a new ministerial-
 level body, the Auditing Administration. The creation of the new security
 ministry reflects the leadership's dissatisfaction with the previous security
 organs and concern over the increased incidence of espionage, hijackings
 and defections, and a rising crime rate. The Auditing Administration may
 localities and enterprises, in the direction of greater central control.
 Major speeches at the Congress, while praising China's economic achieve-
 ments, were frank in assessing problems (appendixes A through Q. Chief
 among these are revenue shortfalls, poor planning and coordination,
 excessive capital construction, and too-rapid heavy industrial growth-at
 the expense of light industry and agriculture. There was some retreat from
 the policies of the recent past, which favored increased autonomy of

 United front activity occupied a prominent place at the session. Beijing
 stressed the diverse makeup of the delegates, with greater representation of
 .minority peoples-13.5 percent of the delegates. Non-Communist Party
 members accounted for 37.5 percent of the total, a 10-percent increase.
 The united front theme was played largely for the benefit of Hong Kong
 and Taiwan, both of which were reprepresented by PRC-picked delegations
 at the Congress.
 In foreign affairs, the leadership stressed China's opposition to hegemon-
 ism, blamed the United States and the USSR for problems in their
 relations with China, and played up China's connections to the Third
 World. The Congress reiterated China's calls for Vietnamese withdrawal
 from Kampuchea and Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
 Statements on military matters emphasized increased professionalization
 and organizational streamlining. Most of the members named to the new
 state military commission are associated with Deng Xiaoping's reform
 policies, which have been opposed by some conservatives in the party and
 Army. The People's Liberation Army had a slightly smaller percentage of
 delegates than in previous congresses, which some observers saw as
 symptomatic of reduced PLA influence.
 Premier Zhao repeated the message that China's intellectuals have an
 important role to play in modernization and admonished localities to
 improve their status. Zhao echoed recent statements, however, emphasiz-
 ing the responsibility of intellectuals and workers in art and literature to re-
 member their duties to the people and to socialism, indicating continued
 tightening of artistic and ideological standards. Education was assigned a
 high priority, especially secondary vocational schools.
 The Sixth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
 also met from 3 through 22 June, overlapping-as has become the
 custom-the NPC session. The CPPCC is a united front conclave designed
 to provide a forum for discussion of national issues outside official party
 and state arenas. The CPPCC always has heavier representation of
 nonparty members and minority peoples, and from overseas Chinese, than
 the NPC. This year, only 40 percent of the CPPCC delegates were party
 members. The organization has no real policymaking or legislative power
 and not much influence. The fifth CPPCC was chaired by Deng Xiaoping;
 he resigned this year and was replaced by Politburo member Deng
 Yingchao, Zhou Enlai's widow and a longtime associate of Deng Xiaoping
 (see appendix F).

 Appendix A
 Excerpts From Premier Zhao's Work Report
 Achievements                 We have achieved and enhanced political stability and unity throughout the
 country and made more efforts to improve socialist democracy and legality.
 During the past five years our political life has steadily returned to normal. The
 National People's Congress and its Standing Committee adopted a number of
 laws, and the State Council promulgated a series of statutes. All this has helped
 strengthen democratic management in economic, political, and other activities of
 the country and has helped ensure public order and order in production and other
 work across the land. In particular, the promulgation of China's new Constitution
 marked a new stage in our effort to build up socialist democracy and legality.
 China's economy has freed itself from the instability caused by serious imbalance
 among its major branches and has gradually moved onto a path of sound growth.
 The implementation of the principle of readjusting, restructuring, consolidating,
 and improving the national economy over the past few years has led to a radical
 change in the longstanding high rate of accumulation and serious backwardness of
 agriculture and light industry.
 China's agriculture has extricated itself from protracted stagnation and achieved a
 sustained overall upsurge. The State Council has implemented a series of rural
 policies in the past few years to stimulate labor enthusiasm of the peasants. We
 have raised the purchase prices of farm and sideline products by a wide margin, in-
 creased the import of grain, and reduced the quotas of grain purchase by the state
 in some areas. All this has helped revitalize the countryside. As a solution to a fun-
 damental problem that has long plagued China's socialist agriculture, it represents
 a step forward that is of profound and far-reaching historic significance.
 Our government work still leaves much to be desired and we face many difficulties
 on the road ahead. As regards production, capital construction and circulation,
 and economic results, for example, productivity gains and lowered costs are still
 unsatisfactory and the waste of manpower and material and financial resources is
 appalling. Owing to inadequate control over the market and prices, open or
 disguised increases in the prices of certain commodities, particularly nonstaple
 foodstuffs, have occurred in quite a few places. The building of a socialist spiritual
 civilization that promotes socialist ethics has not yet received adequate attention in
 some localities, departments, and units. There are certain unwholesome things in
 the spheres of ideology, culture, and art. The unhealthy tendencies and practices in
 society have not been forcefully and completely checked, and there is no lack of
 economic crimes and some other serious crimes. Some government functionaries
 have not yet effectively corrected the reprehensible habit of bureaucratism and the
 unhealthy practice of seeking personal gain through abuse of government power.

 Tasks Ahead              Based on our analysis of the work done in the past five years, as well as on the cur-
 rgnt situation and problems, this State Council deems it necessary to make the fol-
 lowing suggestions in regard to the work of the incoming administration for the
 Congress to examine.
 The main tasks of the government for the coming five years should be to mobilize
 the people of all our nationalities to fulfill or overfulfill the Sixth Five-Year Plan,
 draw up and carry out the Seventh Five-Year Plan, continue to push ahead with
 work in various fields centering on economic development, bring about a funda-
 mental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation and in standards
 of social conduct as put forward by the 12th National Congress of the Chinese
 Communist Party, and thus win a signal victory in the struggle to create a new sit-
 uation in all fields of socialist modernization.
 Economic Priorities       In the next five years, we must first of all ensure that agriculture and light and
 heavy industries grow in a balanced way ... While promoting the steady growth of
 agricultural production, we should get heavy industry to better serve agriculture,
 light industry, and technical transformation. We should continue to apply the
 principle of giving light industry priority in the supply of energy and raw and
 semifinished materials, access to transport facilities, allocation of investment and
 loans, and use of foreign exchange.
 Centralization Versus    Some comrades now hold that reform simply means decentralization of power and
 Autonomy                 interests. This view is both incorrect and harmful. It is wrong to exercise excessive
 and rigid control over specific economic activities of enterprises-this hamstrings
 their initiative. A proper measure of flexibility is entirely necessary. But major
 economic activities that concern overall interests should nevertheless be central-
 ized. Any attempt to weaken such centralization means retrogression rather than
 progress and cannot ensure the growth of our economy along socialist lines. Powers
 and interests appropriate to enterprises must be respected. But it must first of all
 be made clear that as the reform gradually spreads, much higher demands and
 ever heavier responsibility will be placed on the enterprises. For the various forms
 of responsibility, systems characterized by the combination of responsibility,
 power, and interests, responsibility is of primary importance.
 Economic Law              We shall continue to speed up economic and administrative legislation. The State
 Council will have a number of economic statutes enacted so as to serve the
 requirements of China's modernization. Leading members of government econom-
 ic departments and other economic organizations should learn how to use legal
 means to supervise economic activities so as to close the loopholes and overcome
 weak points that criminals of different stripes may exploit and to safeguard
 socialist economic order.

 Revenue Problems             While working to accomplish these tasks, particularly of giving priority to key
 construction projects, we face the most urgent problem of inadequate central
 financial resources combined with serious decentralized use of funds. In the four
 years from 1979 through 1982, the total output value increased by 33.6 percent,
 which is not a small figure, but our state revenue in the same period dropped by
 3.3 percent.
 A major reason for the decline in state revenues over the past few years was poor
 economic results-as manifested in the continuing high cost of industrial produc-
 tion and transport-and the large amount of funds being tied up in commodity
 circulation.
 Another important reason for the state's inadequate financial resources in recent
 years is excessive decentralization of funds, which means that too few funds are
 concentrated in the hands of the state. The proportion of financial revenue in the
 national income dropped from 37.2 percent in 1978 to 25.5 percent in 1982 ... All
 departments, localities, and enterprises must bear firmly in mind the need for
 improving economic results and must never stress input to the neglect of output, or
 stress state investment to the neglect of making contributions to the state in return.
 Wages, Profits,            The rate of increase for wages, bonuses, and welfare funds for workers and staff
 Taxes                      members must be less than that for profits and taxes turned over to the state by the
 enterprises. The practice of indiscriminately issuing bonuses must be stopped. The
 increase in peasant income must come mainly from expanded production and
 lower costs. The state provides 32 billion yuan in price subsidies for farm produce
 and other kinds of subsidies at present. If measures are not taken, this figure may
 continue to rise sharply in the future. This is beyond the state's financial capability
 and must be checked ... Nevertheless, the state must be assured of the largest
 share of the increased profits of the enterprises, mainly through taxation and the
 fixing of a rational ratio between the after-tax profits to be kept by the enterprises
 and the amount to be turned over to the state ... The State Council holds that, in
 the future, rational distribution of national income, prevention of excessive
 decentralization of funds, and appropriate increases in the proportion of financial
 revenue in the national income must be placed on the agenda as an extremely im-
 portant task of our government work.
 Structural Reform        It is imperative to speed up structural reform of the economy so as to meet the re-
 quirements of economic development. At its fifth session, the Fifth National
 People's Congress approved the measures submitted by the State Council to be
 taken in the last three years of the Sixth Five-Year Plan period to restructure the
 economy.

 Economic Reforms Under Way
 The first step in instituting a system of taxation instead of delivery of profits to the
 state has been taken in all state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises as of
 1 June. In conjunction with the restructuring of government administration, we
 are expanding experiments in encouraging key cities to organize production and
 circulation better as a way to handle properly the contradictions between higher
 and lower levels and between departments and regions. The plan for reform of the
 system of rural commodity circulation has been put into effect on a trial basis
 throughout the country. These three reforms, being a breakthrough in the present
 organization of the economy, have already started, but much remains to be done
 and we should continue to push the work ahead.
 Planning
 First, to reform the planning system and strengthen the state's effective control
 over the national economy and guidance to it ... Under the principle of ensuring
 the leading role of the planned economy supplemented by market regulation, we
 should adopt such methods of management as mandatory planning, guidance
 planning or market regulation with regard to different enterprises, products, and
 tasks. We should do a better job of economic forecasting and step by step devise
 scientific regulations for planning as regards decisionmaking, programing, overall
 balancing, appraising, and job responsibility so as to improve and refine the entire
 planning system. While making proper use of administrative and legislative means,
 the state should use more effectively such economic levers as pricing, taxation and
 credits, strengthen statistical work and supervision by statistical means, and guide
 the economic activities of localities, departments, and enterprises in the right
 direction, so as to ensure fulfillment of the state plan.
 Commodity Circulation
 Second, to organize production and circulation according to the requirements of
 large-scale socialized production and develop a single socialist market. The main
 points are as follows: take cities as centers and organize economic activities
 according to the inherent laws of economic growth, breaking down the barriers
 between regions, departments, and town and county. We must continue to
 reorganize or merge enterprises on the principle of achieving coordination among
 specialized departments and improving economic results, and gradually rationalize
 the organization of enterprises and their system of management. We must
 earnestly remove barriers and blockades, open up diverse channels of circulation
 and reduce intermediate links in circulation to ensure the free flow of commodities
 and gradually form intertrade and transregional economic zones and networks.
 Tax, Wage, and Labor Systems
 Third, to reform the financial system and the wage and labor systems. The system
 of taxation instead of the delivery of profits to the state should be improved, some

 of revenue. Reform the wage system step by step, carry out the principle of "to
 each according to his work," and overcome egalitarianism so as to link the income
 of the workers and staff members closely with economic results, the success or
 failure of enterprise operation, and their own contributions in work. Reform the
 personnel system step by step so that people can be transferred to other jobs or go
 to a higher or a lower post as required.
 Enterprise Management    All departments, localities, enterprises, and institutions should unfailingly cut
 down production costs and other expenses specified in the state plan. Any
 enterprise that fails to do so will incur a proportional deduction in the portion of
 profit retained for its own use. All units must ... meet tax and profit quotas
 assigned them by the state ... Any unit that fails to do so because of poor
 management is, in principle, not entitled to give wage increases to its workers and
 staff members. Appropriate quotas must be set according to the merits of each
 case for the amount of circulating funds used by enterprises, and any unauthorized
 increase is forbidden. All enterprises that run at a loss due to poor operation must
 reverse this trend within a given time limit.
 Capital Construction       Because of the serious overdecentralization of funds, it has been impossible to
 control the overall scale of capital construction, resulting in overlapping or blind
 construction. It has also been difficult to check the growth of funds for
 consumption and, in particular, the rapid growth in the indiscriminate handing out
 of bonuses and subsidies in cash or in kind.
 At present, waste in capital construction is appalling, and investment in many key
 projects is above budgetary estimates. In the future, a strict economic responsibil-
 ity system must be practiced in capital construction and waste of all kinds
 eliminated. No locality, department, unit, or individual is allowed to collect fees
 arbitrarily or extort anything from the organizations charged with building the key
 construction projects. The State Council has decided to organize, after this session,
 necessary forces to conduct investigations at the key projects.
 Energy and Transport       In the next five years, we must work harder to build key energy and transport proj-
 ects and promote the technical transformation of existing enterprises ... In
 tackling the energy problem it is essential to continue to apply the policy of laying
 equal stress on development and conservation. In every new project we should
 make rational use of energy by adopting new energy-saving techniques and
 technologies ... We should step up expansion of the power industry by building
 hydroelectric, thermal, and nuclear power stations. A number of large hydro-
 electric stations should be gradually constructed along the upper reaches of the
 Huanghe River and the upper and middle reaches of the Changjiang River and its
 tributaries, and in the Hongshui River Basin. A number of electric power stations
 should be built one after another near the coal mines in Shanxi Province, Nei
 Monggol, Huainan and Huaibei regions in Anhui Province, and the Liupanshui
 region in Guizhou Province.

 With regard to railways, we should focus on augmenting their capacity to carry
 coal while actively transforming old lines and building new ones where necessary.
 To meet the needs of domestic economic development and foreign trade, we should
 increase the capacity of harbors, inland waterways, roads and air transport, and
 further improve post and telecommunications facilities.
 Foreign Policy        We have adhered to an independent foreign policy and achieved new successes in
 foreign affairs. We have continued to expand relations with other countries on the
 basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
 integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs,
 equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
 Our socialist modernization requires a peaceful international environment. The
 preservation of peace is the common desire of the people of China and the rest of
 the world. The superpower contention for world hegemony is the main source of
 turmoil in the world today. It is imperative to oppose hegemonism in order to
 safeguard world peace. The Chinese Government takes opposing hegemonism and
 safeguarding world peace as the basic point of departure for its foreign policy and
 seeks to develop relations with other countries on the basis of the five principles of
 peaceful coexistence and to promote the progress of mankind.
 Sino-Soviet Relations The relations between China and the Soviet Union have been strained over a long
 period of time, and this is not to the advantage of either party. The people of China
 and the Soviet Union are all interested in the normalization of relations between
 the two countries. The Chinese side put forward positive proposals for normaliza-
 tion during the Sino-Soviet consultations, which started last October. We hold that
 to improve Sino-Soviet relations, the first step to be taken is for the Soviet side to
 remove the real threat to China's security. This is a major issue that cannot be
 evaded. We are waiting for the Soviet side to prove its good faith by deeds.
 Vietnam and the Soviet Union must withdraw their troops immediately, uncondi-
 tionally and totally from Kampuchea and Afghanistan, respectively, leaving the
 people of these countries to settle their own affairs.
 Eastern Europe         There has been steady growth in the close solidarity and friendly cooperation
 between China and the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Socialist Federal
 Republic of Yugoslavia ... The Chinese people also cherish friendly feelings
 toward the people of the other East European countries. We are interested in their
 accomplishments and experience in socialist construction. In recent years, our
 economic, cultural, and sports exchanges with these countries have been increas-
 ing. We believe that, through joint efforts, the relations between China and these
 countries will continue to improve.

 Vietnam and Other           We are distressed by the fact that the once friendly Sino-Vietnamese relations
 Asian States              have deteriorated to the point of serious confrontation in recent years as a result of
 the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea by the Vietnamese authorities who
 have pursued regional hegemony in Indochina and Southeast Asia, discriminated
 against Chinese residents, and opposed China. Nevertheless, we are ready to
 continue our efforts to improve Sino-Vietnamese relations.
 We are happy to see that our relations with the ASEAN countries have developed
 in the struggle to safeguard peace and security in Southeast Asia. We also note
 with satisfaction that our traditional friendship and cooperation with Bangladesh,
 Burma, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka are being constantly strengthened. There
 has also been some improvement in the relations between China and India in
 recent years. With 2,000 years of peaceful relations behind them, China and India
 ought to be able to get along well with each other. The Sino-Indian boundary ques-
 tion left over from the past can without doubt be settled through consultations in
 the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. Even if it cannot
 be settled for the time being, it should not stand in the way of improving our rela-
 tions. We are ready to strive for better Sino-Indian relations.
 Taiwan and Hong Kong     Fellow deputies, the reunification of the country, and the unity of the people of all
 our nationalities provide the fundamental guarantee for the growing strength and
 prosperity of our motherland. The people of all our nationalities, including our
 compatriots in Taiwan, Xianggang (Hong Kong), and Aomen (Macao), and
 Chinese nationals residing abroad, eagerly look forward to the reunification of the
 motherland at an early date, and this is our most sacred task.
 We must continue our efforts to remove as soon as possible this artificial barrier
 that separates the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We shall, at an
 opportune moment, recover Chinese sovereignty over Xianggang and take appro-
 priate measures to maintain its prosperity.
 Third World              The Third World constitutes a powerful force against imperialism, colonialism,
 and hegemonism. China is part of the Third World. Our basic stand in foreign
 affairs is to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other Third World
 countries. It is our sacred duty to support other Third World countries and people
 in their struggles to win and uphold their national rights. We firmly support the
 people of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. in their struggle against aggression.
 New Economic Order       Many Third World countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have entered the
 new historical stage of consolidating their political independence through expand-
 ing their national economies and have done very well in developing their
 economies. They are still faced with grave economic difficulties, however, due to
 prolonged rule and plunder by foreign powers in the past and to the shackles of
 present unfair and unequal international economic relationships. The Third World
 countries strongly demand that this irrational state of affairs be changed and that
 a new international economic order be established. The Chinese Government
 firmly supports this just stand.

 Middle East              We firmly support the Arab people, and particularly the Palestinian people, in
 their struggle against Israeli aggression and expansion. Israel must withdraw from
 the Arab territories it has occupied. The national rights of the Palestinian people
 must be restored to them.
 Africa
 Central America
 Intellectuals
 We resolutely support the Namibian people in their struggle for national
 independence and the people of South Africa in their struggle against racial
 discrimination and apartheid and for national liberation.
 We resolutely support the peoples of Central America, and particularly of the
 Caribbean region, in their struggle to uphold independence and sovereignty and to
 oppose foreign intervention.
 The persistent, erroneous tendency to belittle knowledge and discriminate against
 intellectuals has gradually been corrected, and education, science, and culture
 have improved. From now on we should stress the development of intellectual
 resources, giving priority to the development of culture, which focuses on the
 promotion of education and science and technology. This is a prerequisite for
 invigorating China's national economy.
 The key to strengthening cultural work lies in implementing more fully our policies
 on intellectuals so as to bring their enthusiasm into full play. All departments and
 localities should, in the light of their own conditions, adopt measures to improve
 their work toward intellectuals in real earnest. Intellectuals should receive gradual
 and appropriate increases in remuneration for their work. Since the salaries of
 those middle-aged intellectuals, who play the backbone role, are far too low, the
 state will, despite financial difficulties, do its best to raise their salaries gradually
 to a level corresponding to their posts and titles.
 In order to tap our intellectual resources and promote the advance of education,
 science, literature, art, physical culture, and public health, thus ensuring a
 balanced and proportionate economic and social development in our country, the
 State Council has decided to increase investment in these areas year by year.
 We must now give prominence to developing higher education and quickly training
 personnel for all trades and professions. The State Council recently approved the
 report submitted by the Ministry of Education and the State Planning Commission
 on speeding up the expansion of higher education in different forms. Enrollment in
 regular colleges and universities is to rise from 315,000 in 1982 to 550,000 in 1987,
 a 75-percent jump in those five years. We will also try to provide higher education
 through such forms as radio, TV, and correspondence university classes and
 evening colleges, and college for training managerial personnel and for advanced
 training of teachers so that their enrollment can grow from 290,000 in 1982 to 1.1
 million in 1987, a 280-percent rise.

 China's specialized secondary school education has been slow in growing over the
 years, with the result that the ratio of intermediate and high-level specialists is
 seriously out of balance ... Senior middle vocational school students should
 account for over 40 percent of the total senior middle school enrollment in the next
 five years ... More secondary schools and institutes of political science and law
 should be established to provide regular training for in-service personnel so that
 the public security, procuratorial and judicial contingents become a well-trained
 force cherished by the people as the pillar of public order.
 Science and Technology The most pressing problem confronting us is the unified arrangement and proper
 use of scientific and technical personnel. In order to do this, we will take the
 following measures: (1) break down the barriers between departments and between
 regions and work out unified placement and appropriate use of scientific and
 technical personnel on a nationwide scale through the drawing up of the
 development program, the joint tackling of key scientific and technical projects,
 and establishment of technological development centers; (2) transfer in a planned
 way a number of scientific and technical personnel from heavy and defense
 industries to energy, transport, light industry, and agriculture where such person-
 nel are few; transfer a number of personnel from institutions of higher education
 and scientific research that are well staffed to secondary schools or vocational
 schools to augment their teaching staff; (3) set up a system of rational interflow of
 scientific and technical personnel so that they can move from overstaffed to
 understaffed departments and to encourage them to go to small and medium-sized
 cities, the rural areas, national minority areas, and remote border regions; (4)
 create a system of dual control over the country's scientific and technical
 personnel, grading them according to whether they come under the management
 of the central or local authorities, and according to their trades or professions and
 specialties; and (5) improve the systems of appraisal, promotion, and awards and
 the conferring of academic titles on scientific and technical personnel so as to raise
 the professional competence of those who are young and middle age.
 Efforts should be continued during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period to build the 38
 key research projects and to disseminate and apply 40 major scientific and
 technological research achievements ... In addition, the government is organizing
 the scientific and technical personnel concerned to make first-phase preparations
 and begin research on important construction subjects for the 279 major projects
 now planned. We should also strive to digest, assimilate, and spread advanced
 technology introduced from other countries so as to raise China's level of
 production and technology more quickly through imported technology and joint
 production.

 Ideology, Art, and   Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and the
 Literature           principles of integrating theory with practice and of "letting a hundred flowers
 blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," people specialized in
 philosophy and other social sciences should conduct creative research into the
 major ideological, theoretical, and practical problems arising from our socialist
 modernization, summarize from a historical perspective the achievements and
 lessons gained in all fields since the founding of the People's Republic, and
 analytically study and criticize different trends of thought in the world so as to
 assimilate what is useful and produce research results of high quality.
 Our aim is to ensure the flourishing of socialist literature and art and enhance the
 ideological and artistic quality of writers and artists and of their works. While
 continuing to overcome "left" errors, we must constantly watch out for the
 tendency of some works toward crass commercialism regardless of social conse-
 quences; this has already appeared and had a pernicious influence. We should
 adopt effective measures to rectify this tendency ... All ideological, cultural, and
 art workers must cultivate a deep sense of responsibility to the people and live up
 to their expectations.
 Law and Order        The success of China's modernization requires us to redouble our efforts to build
 socialist democracy and the legal system, improve the work of public security, the
 procuratorate and the judiciary, curb violations of the law and social discipline,
 make a fundamental turn for the better in the standards of social conduct, and
 continue to strengthen political stability and unity.
 The new Constitution is the basic statute for the Chinese people in running the
 affairs of the state. The people must be educated and organized to enforce it
 conscientiously. There has been improvement in recent years, thanks to the efforts
 made by various quarters, but public order is still not as good as in the best years
 after the founding of the People's Republic. Such criminal offenses as murder,
 robbery, rape, and larceny pose quite a problem in some places. The recent plane
 hijacking indicates that there are serious loopholes and defects in our system of
 management, that public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments have
 failed to perform some of their functions effectively as organs of dictatorship, and
 that some departments are intolerably apathetic both politically and ideologically,
 maintaining not the slightest vigilance against enemies.
 It is imperative to build up urban residents' committees, villagers' committees, and
 public security and people's mediation organizations under them, and to encourage
 the urban residents and peasants to draw up common pledges and work regula-
 tions, so as to foster the initiative of the masses in maintaining public order and
 observing social morality as masters of the country.

 Internal Security             Fellow deputies, China's socialist modernization is being carried out in a complex
 and turbulent international situation. To protect the security of the state and
 strengthen our struggle against espionage, the State Council is submitting to the
 present Congress for its approval the request to establish a Ministry of State
 Security, which will provide more effective leadership over such work.
 We must continue to modernize our national defense and raise our national
 defense capabilities to keep pace with current international developments. The
 Chinese People's Liberation Army must step up its military and political training;
 strive to revolutionize, modernize, and regularize itself; and increase its capability
 for operations by combined Army units and for quick response under conditions of
 modern war.
 Population Control         Stimulating production and improving the people's living standards both require
 that we continue to lay special stress on population control. This is our national
 policy, a policy of fundamental, strategic importance. We must persistently
 advocate late marriage and one child per couple, strictly control second births,
 prevent additional births by all means, earnestly carry out effective birth control
 measures, and firmly protect infant girls and their mothers. In order to promote
 family planning, we must use all available means to provide diverse forms of old-
 age care.

 Appendix B
 Highlights of Vice Premier
 Yao Yilin's Report
 on the Economy
 Vice Premier Yao Yilin, in his capacity as State Planning Commission chief,
 delivered a report on the 1983 economic plan. He discussed current problems in
 the economy-most notably excessive investment spending-and described the
 general focus of economic work in the coming year to address these problems.
 Agriculture             Yao attributed the unusually large increase (11 percent) in the value of agricul-
 tural output to the government's agricultural policies and to favorable weather ...
 output of grain, China's most important commodity, hit a historic peak of 353
 million tons ... cotton increased by 21.3 percent ... oil-bearing crops hit alltime
 highs ... sugar-bearing crops, mulberry silkworm cocoons, tea, pork, beef, mutton,
 and aquatic products all registered substantial increases ... the 1983 target for
 agricultural growth is 4 percent, far below the 1982 growth rate ... except for
 some southern areas where production has been hampered by windstorms, summer
 crops promise bumper harvests.
 Industrial output value registered a 7.7-percent increase over 1981 and exceeded
 the 4-percent target ... 91 of the 110 major industrial products reached or
 surpassed the plan ... light industry fell shy of the 7-percent target because of a
 market-induced reduction in the output of synthetic polyester-cotton fabric ...
 output of bicycles, sewing machines, TV sets, washing machines, tape recorders,
 cotton cloth, woolen and silk fabrics, paper, and detergents all increased ... heavy
 industry output value rose by 9.9 percent, far exceeding the target of 1 percent,
 due to the sharp increase in demand for investment goods and to the unanticipated
 rise in demand for agricultural producer goods ... steel products, cement, glass,
 acids, alkalis, plastics, power-generating and mining equipment, and walking
 tractors all surpassed their goals ... output of coal, crude oil, and electricity all in-
 creased and surpassed targets, but Yao claimed that 1982 plan targets for these
 products had been deliberately set low ... railway, water and road transport, civil
 aviation, and post and communications targets were all overfulfilled ... the 1983
 plan calls for "ensuring a 4-percent increase and striving for a 5-percent increase"
 in industrial production ... light industry is to grow by 4.1 percent, heavy industry
 by 3.9 percent ... output value of industry in January-April 1983 was 7.6 percent
 higher than the corresponding period of 1982.

 The 1982 investment in the state-owned sector was 84.5 billion yuan, of which 55.5
 billion yuan was capital construction (investment in new fixed assets) and 29 billion
 yuan went to renewal and replacement of existing assets ... 1982 capital
 construction overshot the plan by over 11 billion yuan and the government's 1983
 investment goals are to cut overall spending-by deleting many local projects-
 and to concentrate investment in key construction projects, particularly in energy
 and transport ... capital construction in 1983 is targeted for 50.7 billion yuan and
 replacement will be 24 billion yuan.
 Retail Sales and Prices Retail sales in 1982 increased by 7.3 percent in real terms ... the supply of
 foodstuffs, clothing, and daily consumer goods was "fairly adequate," while
 supplies and selections of some other commodities showed the need for improve-
 ment ... market prices remained stable, rising about 2 percent ... the goal for
 1983 is to increase retail sales 7.8 percent while constraining purchasing power
 increases ... circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas must
 improve ... the government will attempt to stabilize purchase prices of major
 farm and sideline products and control price subsidies for farm produce and
 agricultural producer goods.
 Living Standards      Living standards of the urban and rural population continued to rise in 1982.. .
 annual per capita net income of peasants averaged 270 yuan, an increase of 15.2
 percent ... 6.65 million persons were given jobs in urban areas ... housing
 conditions improved ... government, scientific, cultural, educational, public health
 workers received wage increases.
 Foreign Trade         Foreign trade continued to expand, registering an increase of 5 percent over 1981
 .  exports were up by 12.7 percent, while imports dropped 2.7 percent, resulting
 in a trade surplus of 5.7 billion yuan.
 Major Problems        Yao cited three major problems facing the economy ... first, the increase in the
 scale of investment was excessive ... second, overspending on investment caused
 too great an increase in heavy industry, consequently depriving light industry of
 inputs ... third, too little emphasis was placed on improving productivity.

 Alleviation of Problems  Continue to apply the policy of "readjusting, restructuring, consolidating, and
 improving" the national economy, and concentrate on raising productivity ... Yao
 cited three specific areas of focus ... first, strictly control the volume of
 investment and ensure the completion of key construction projects on schedule ...
 second, continue with reorganization and consolidation efforts, including the major
 reform of taxing state-owned enterprises ... third, keep the rate of heavy industry
 growth within the plan and develop light industry faster ... generally, targets
 should be set low to facilitate concentration on productivity improvements.

 Appendix C
 Summary of Wang Bingqian's Report
 on Final State Accounts for 1982
 Finance Minister Wang Bingqian's report on the 1'982 state budget followed the
 pattern of previous speeches and provided the usual breakdowns of revenues and
 expenditures. It also discussed "salient features" and "problems" in the implemen-
 tation of the 1982 budget and described the budget position in the first four
 months of 1983.
 State revenues totaled 112.40 billion yuan ... expenditures were 115.33 billion
 yuan ... according to Wang, the deficit, 2.93 billion yuan, will be made up by an
 overdraft from the People's Bank of China ... (see tables 1 and 2 for budget data).
 Wang said revenues have begun to pick up, reversing a three-year decline ... tax
 receipts greatly surpassed the budgeted figure, due to increased production,
 expanded commodity circulation, stronger fiscal oversight, and new taxes ...
 profits fell below the state target partly due to poor performance in some sectors
 and partly because new taxes supplanted what were originally to have been profit
 remittances ... treasury bonds were oversubscribed by 9.6 percent.
 Expenditures             Capital construction appropriations exceeded the state target because of increased
 investment in the infrastructure ... funds to tap the potential of existing
 enterprises and finance their technical transformation greatly exceeded the
 budgeted figure because additional allocations were provided by central financial
 authorities, and localities used some of their own reserve funds ... operating
 expenses for agriculture exceeded the target due to additional outlays by central
 financial authorities and by localities from reserve funds ... expenses for culture,
 education, science, and public health services exceeded the plan as more personnel
 were hired and some workers received pay hikes ... administrative expenses
 increased as more personnel were recruited to strengthen public security and
 judicial work ... allocation of circulating funds for enterprises fell short of the tar-
 get ... geological prospecting appropriations basically met needs of its expansion
 ... expenditures for foreign loans repayment exceeded the plan by 39.8 percent
 due to favorable balance of foreign trade, which allowed payments to be made
 ahead of schedule.
 Unresolved Problems      A low effectiveness in production, circulation, and construction ... overdecentrali-
 zation of funds ... an increase in state revenue that lags behind the growth in pro-
 duction ... lack of a management system to allocate funds for key construction
 projects ... ordinary projects squeezing out key projects ... duplicate construction
 ... blind development.

 Current Performance   Up to the end of April 1983, the growth rate of revenue failed to reach the annual
 budget target, while expenditures were above the specified figure.
 Finance Minister Wang indicates that the state deficit will be made up by an over-
 draft from the People's Bank of China. Official bank figures, however, do not
 confirm this ... beginning 1 June 1983, China implemented an experimental tax
 policy in which the state-run enterprises substitute the payment of taxes for the
 current system of delivery of profits, in order to break the situation in which
 "everyone eats from the same big pot." We expect to see a change in the
 composition, and a possible increase, in state revenues as the result of the
 implementation of this policy ... although budgetary appropriations for capital
 construction exceeded the estimated figure, key projects were affected by a lack of
 funds because investment by various localities, departments, and units using their
 own funds or bank loans increased tremendously, dispersing manpower, material,
 and financial resources.

 People's Daily Concluding Editorial
 Renmin Ribao (22 June 1983)
 The first session of the Sixth NPC concluded success-
 fully yesterday. The first session of the Sixth CPPCC
 National Committee is to conclude today. The people
 of all nationalities throughout the country have been
 keenly concerned with these two meetings, which have
 successfully elected their new leading bodies and new
 state leadership and have smoothly effected the pur-
 pose of substituting the old with the new and carrying
 out cooperation between the old and the new. All this
 has provided a reliable organizational guarantee for
 the healthy development of the socialist cause in all
 fields. All deputies attending the first session of the
 Sixth NPC have made lively discussions on the gov-
 ernment work report delivered by Premier Zhao
 Ziyang and other reports. They generally hold that
 the reports conform to the ideological line of seeking
 truth from facts and tally with our country's actual
 conditions, so those reports are inspiring. All members
 of the CPPCC attending the NPC session as observers
 have also discussed these reports, have put forward
 many proposals and ideas, and have adopted a resolu-
 tion on the work of the CPPCC. We warmly congrat-
 ulate the complete successes achieved by the two
 important sessions.
 At a democratic consultative meeting held before the
 two sessions by the CPC central leadership with
 personages from all fields, Hu Yaobang, general
 secretary of the CPC Central Committee, put forward
 12 Chinese characters meaning "never forget unity
 and strive to build a strong China." This is a great
 mission that history vests in us. It represents the
 common desire of the people of all nationalities
 throughout the country and the fundamental interest
 of the Chinese people. Over the past five years, we
 have created a good situation in which the people have
 united and worked hard by setting things to rights and
 overcoming demerits and developing advantages, and
 have begun the great cause of making China a strong
 nation. From beginning to end, the first session of the
 Sixth NPC and the first session of the Sixth CPPCC
 have been filled with an atmosphere of democracy and
 unity and have embodied a spirit of seeking unceasing
 progress. The sessions manifest the great unity of the
 1 billion people of our nation and the vigorous politi-
 cal situation in our country. The success of the two
 sessions will further arouse the enthusiasm of the
 people of all nationalities throughout the country and
 personages in all fields of our society. They will play
 an important role in promoting the socialist modern-
 ization drive in our country.
 The Chinese nation has a strong centripetal force and
 a strong coagulative force. The Chinese people have a
 strong urge for improvement and strong zest for their
 cause. Precisely because of this, in our history over the
 past thousands of years, our nation can overcome
 division and maintain unification and can develop
 continuously by surmounting various difficulties. Af-
 ter the victory of the new democratic revolution led by
 the CPC, a new chapter began in the history of the
 Chinese nation. Although we have experienced a
 tortuous course over the past 30 years and more, our
 achievements are still unprecedented as compared
 with any historical period. We are now standing at a
 new starting point. The situation of stability and unity
 in China is irreversible. The great cause of reunifica-
 tion is irreversible. The prosperity of China is also
 irreversible. We must further consolidate the great
 unity of the people of all nationalities throughout the
 country, further develop and strengthen the patriotic
 united front, and promote the realization of the
 objective of the peaceful reunification of the mother-
 land. We must continue to carry forward the enter-
 prising spirit, work hard, handle affairs in a down-to-
 earth and realistic manner, and ensure the smooth
 development of our socialist modernization drive.
 During the five-year tenure of the Sixth NPC, we will
 fulfill the Sixth Five-Year Plan and begin the Seventh
 Five-Year Plan. Those will be the five years vital to
 our modernization process. By doing a good job in

 these five years, we will successfully fulfill the work of
 laying a foundation in the first 10 years ending in
 1990 and will create more favorable conditions for the
 planned economic upsurge in the second 10 years. As
 deputies pointed out in their discussions, the targets
 for the next five years are positive and are also
 realizable through efforts. The recent NPC session
 has earnestly summed up the basic experience of the
 past five years and has laid down a more positive
 guideline for economic work. We will resolutely focus
 all economic work on the attainment of better eco-
 nomic results, will adhere to the realistic principle of
 developing construction steadily and surely, and will
 ensure a healthy development of the national economy
 at a steady speed so as to gain real benefits for the
 people. Now, our national economy as a whole has
 moved onto the path of healthy development and the
 conditions for speeding up the reforms have gradually
 become ripe. The overall situation is excellent.
 Of course, the better the situation, the more sober our
 minds must be. "A car may go smoothly on a steep
 slope but overturn on a flat road, because the driver is
 cautious in times of difficulty and becomes careless
 when the situation is smooth." On this point, Premier
 Zhao has made repeated cautions in his government
 work report. We must work cautiously and conscien-
 tiously and must have an overall viewpoint and take
 into consideration the overall interests. We must be
 determined to overcome the problem of overdecentra-
 lization of funds and to concentrate our strength on
 gearing up the key construction projects with a bear-
 ing to the future of our modernization program. We
 must strive to improve economic results and ensure
 the steady growth in the national economy in the next
 five years.
 Socialist modernization is a cause of the millions of
 people. In order to realize the targets for the next five
 years, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the
 people of all nationalities throughout the country, and
 members of the NPC must join hands with all
 democratic parties and people with lofty ideals in all
 fields. The tasks listed in the government work report
 for the next five years not only represent the people's
 interests and aspirations, but also include the people's
 ideas and embody their wisdom. The issues mentioned
 by the report, such as the issue of concentrating funds
 to ensure key construction, the issue of carrying out
 economic structural reform, and the issue of exploit-
 ing intellectual resources, are all matters with which
 the people are concerned and are matters that have
 been frequently discussed at NPC sessions and other
 meetings in recent years. The people's proposals and
 critical opinions about these matters have been
 changed into effective and feasible measures by the
 government after thorough consideration, and these
 measures have been or will be put into practice. This
 is a prominent new characteristic of the government
 work report approved by the recent NPC session. This
 once again vividly proves that our government re-
 spects and represents the will of the people. A govern-
 ment representing the people's interest is inevitably an
 authoritative government. It can be believed that
 Premier Zhao's government work report will greatly
 mobilize and inspire the people of all nationalities
 throughout the country. Workers, peasants, and intel-
 lectuals will go in for the building of material civiliza-
 tion and socialist spiritual civilization with higher
 consciousness. Our work in all fields in the next five
 years will be more successful than in the previous five
 years.
 The lasting stability and peace of our nation is a
 precondition and a guarantee for the smooth develop-
 ment of the modernization drive. Our socialist democ-
 racy and the building of the legal system have made
 marked progress. The 36 laws adopted by the Fifth
 NPC and its Standing Committee, especially the
 formulation and promulgation last year of the new
 Constitution, have ensured that the political life of the
 state and of our people is governed by laws and will
 proceed healthily. We must mobilize all our strength
 to guarantee the implementation of the Constitution
 in all fields and must continuously strengthen socialist
 democracy and step up the building of a legal system.
 The fundamental law still requires a whole set of
 concrete laws to guarantee its implementation. In this
 field, there is still a great deal of work that we must
 properly handle. Developing socialist democracy and
 perfecting a socialist legal system is our long-term
 task and calls for our unremitting efforts to ensure the
 effective implementation of the Constitution and oth-
 er laws in our country's political life and all aspects of
 our social life.
