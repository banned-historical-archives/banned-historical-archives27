 This report focuses on the turbulence which has been
 evident in the Chinese leadership in the past few months,
 If Peking is to be believed, all it has done t s to purge
 a handful of traitorous intellectuals and party renegades
 who want to restore capitalism.   Signs are mounting, how-
 ever, that the targets have included key men in the party
 machinery, and that this machinery has undergone its most
 massive shakeup in the history of the regime.   This shakeup
 has reached into Mao's inner circle of advisers itself, and
 there are signs that it has led to the removal of a host of
 officials in the party machinery, military and security
 apparatus.  Almost to a man, those who are believed to be
 in trouble are hardliners with records of unswerving
 loyalty to Mao and the party.
 The number and character of the men whose status is
 in question are a further indication that the recent tur-
 moil, to a large extent, is the external sign of a struggle
 by top party leaders to be in a position to take over once
 the aging Mao finally departs.
 On 1 July the Peking Peoples Daily, in an editorial
 commemorating the 45th anniversary o     e Chinese Communist
 Party, claimed that the struggle was over.   The editorial
 described recent events as an attempt by "counterrevolu-
 tionary" plotters to seize the leadership of the party,
 army and the government.   It asserted that the plot had
 been thoroughly crushed, and the scene is quiet again.
 This could prove to be'Ahe case, but it is also possible
 that the struggle is merely entering a new phase.
 If stability has been restored, it may well prove
 transitory.   Considering all that has happened, especially
 Mao's apparent inability to exercise sustained control,
 it is doubtful that the situation will fully stabilize
 until Mao finally departs and a successor consolidates
 his position.   In any case, the ultimate outcome remains
 murky, and it is too early to speculate on what policies
 the ultimate victor will follow,

 The Extent of the Shakeup
 The status of 42 party and military leaders, out of a
 power structure of slightly more than 100, is in question.
 (See Annex A)   Evidence is accumulating that many are in
 deep trouble, not just inexplicably out of public view.
 The list is larger than the one published in the
 17 June DDI Memorandum "The Leadership Upheaval in Communist
 China."  However, it continues to consist almost entirely
 of hardline men who hold key positions in the party?s
 instruments of control -- the party machinery, the army,
 and the security apparatus.   The regime claims that it  is
 after "bourgeois revisionists" who want to restore capital-
 ism and who cannot be trusted to carry on Mao?s polities.
 If so, the wrong men are under attack.   Not one of the rela-
 tive "softies" on the politburo, government administrators
 and economic planners like Chou En-lai, Li Hsien-nien, Li
 Fu-shun and Po I-po,seems to have been touched by the
 struggle.
 Few of the leaders now in trouble have had close asso-
 ciations in their careers with the party general secretary
 Teng Hsiao-ping, who seems to have gained ground in the
 past tumultuous months.  Teng men, such as Minister of
 Public Security Hsieh Fu-chip, generally have survived.
 Many who are on the list owed their rise solely to Mao Tse-
 tung and some enjoyed the reputation of being his personal
 spokesmen.   Their removal could weaken his ability to
 manipulate the levers of power and leave in doubt that he
 has been running the show, as the regime claims.
 Little is known about new appointments, but that little
 also suggests that Teng is strengthening his position.,  The
 replacement named for Deng Chen in early June as first secre-
 tary of Peking was Li Hsueh-feng, believed to be a protege
 of Teng.   The only key appointment announced since then was
 a new deputy director of the general political department
 (the party's control apparatus in the army).   This man
 served under Teng Hsiao-ping in the Southwest Area in the
 early 1950s.

 II.  Evidence that an Official Is in Trouble
 Of the 42 party leaders now considered to be in a
 questionable status, only four have been clearly identified
 in the Chinese press,   These are Peng Chen,  his deputy Liu
 Jen, party cultural spokesman Chou Yang,  and the Heilungkiang
 provincial party secretary Ouyang Chin.   Evidence that the
 remainder are on thin ice rests mainly on a record of public
 non-appearances and on press criticism of their domain.
 This type of evidence is a good though not infallible
 indicator of a man's standing in normal times.   It is a
 still better one when the political scene is unsettled
 as in recent months.  At such times it is important for
 a leader to do what he can to establish that he is in good
 standing.   Appearances not only enhance a leader's stature,
 they remind subordinates that he still exercises authority.
 Several chronic absentees have pointedly shown up at
 least once since April, as if to demonstrate they are in
 good standing.   In addition, many of those who are out of
 sight were very active up through March, so their hiatus of
 appearances represents an abrupt change of habit.
 In late June the Peking press began adding appreciably
 to the pressure that a leader show up to prove his standing.
 It began to demand that responsible officials,  including
 explicitly all provincial first secretaries,  "personally"
 take charge of the current ideological purification drive
 in their own domain.
 Such demands could foreshadow charges of malfeasance
 against officials who can be represented as not complying.
 This was the technique used to bring down Peng Chen.   Before
 Peng's formal removal from his post as first secretary of
 Peking city, several writers and lesser officials in the
 Peking city party and government apparatus were attacked
 for their "antiparty" writings and activities.   The Peking
 city organizations were not represented as acting against
 the "antiparty" criminals.   This would seem to establish
 the general proposition that, when political shortcomings
 are publicized in a leader's domain, and he is not repre-
 sented as engaging in the necessary cleanup action, he is
 in trouble.
 At the moment,  at least eight provincial leaders and
 two department heads in the central committee have been
 implicated by this type of indirect attack.   (See Annex B).
 There has also been political criticism of the air force
 and of military units near Peking which might implicate

 Approved For Release.al]O)G1RE1T-RDP79T00826A001000010011-2
 the air force chief and the commander of the Peking Mili-
 tary Region.   Both have been out of sight for months.  At
 a minimum, such men would seem to be under a cloud, but
 Peoples Daily on 24 June indicated that, their fate was not
 necessarily finally settled.   It urged leading officials
 under attack not to lose heart if they are really loyal to
 the party but to work to try to clear themselves.   This
 may not be very reassuring to those under attack, since
 Peoples Daily had been unsuccessful in its apparent efforts
 eater ier this year to defend Peng Chen.
 One man whose status was in question in May showed up
 in June under circumstances suggesting that he had been
 under attack but had managed to clear himself.  This was
 the first secretary of the Shantung party committee, who
 was out of public view between 29 March and 11 June,  During
 May "antiparty" activities were exposed in Shantung but were
 not reported to have been cleaned out.   Shortly after the
 secretary's reappearance in June a new pocket of subversive
 activity was uncovered and cleaned out by the party committee.
 Doubtless some of the 42 men whose status is in question
 have not been in trouble at all, but are out of sight for
 some other reason.   It is believed that there are relatively
 few in this category, however.   The majority of the men on
 the list are under suspicion on other grounds than merely
 failure to show up recently.   In addition to the four who
 have been publicly identified, ten have had their domain
 criticized, six have been out of view suspiciously long
 (six months or more), and two were very active and eight
 were fairly active before dropping out of. sight,

 This 'IChart considers the status of only those men who
 appeared to form the active power structure in March 1966,
 just before the fall of politburo member Peng Chen.. Some,
 who hold multiple posts, are counted in more than one grouping.

 III.   Shakeup in the Party Machinery  (See Annex C)
 The disarray in the party machinery is not immediately
 evident from the status of the politburo alone.  As of the
 end of June, only one politburo member has been publicly
 displaced but he was sixth in the hierarchy and a member of
 Mao's inner circle of advisers.  One alternate member appears
 on the basis of his long absence and attacks on his areas
 of responsibility also to have fallen victim to behind-the-
 scenes maneuvering.
 This should not be misconstrued.   Six politburo members
 and three alternates were already out of favor, inactive
 because of illness, or relatively unimportant politically
 before the present party crisis.   Five members and one
 alternate have been engaged more in government administra-
 tion than in party work per se for most of the last decade.
 This leaves only six members and two alternates whose
 primary responsibilities had been in the central control
 of the party.
 The day-to-day direction of party affairs,  as distinct
 from policy formulation and the issuance of general direc-
 tives, is entrusted to the Secretariat of the Central Com-
 mittee,  As General Secretary of the CCP and senior member
 of the Secretariat, Teng Hsiao-ping derives much of his
 strategic power from the Secretariat, and his ten colleagues
 (full and alternate members) have all been among the most
 influential in the party.  Now, four of these are purged
 (Peng Chen) or under a cloud of suspicion _: (Lu Ting-i, Lo Jui-
 ching,  and Yang Shang-kun),   Remaining active with Teng are
 the party specialists in agricultural policy, financial and
 economic policy, theoretical work, and regional administra-
 tion.  The men who are apparently out handled propaganda,
 police, the armed forces, and general administration,
 Central Committee Departments
 The Secretariat exercises its authority through a
 series of about ten Central Committee Departments.  Of the
 eight publicly designated heads of these departments, half
 'are out of sight--those who oversee propaganda, organiza-
 tion (i.e., party personnel policy), political work in
 finance and trade, and the Young Communist League.  The
 Propaganda Department has been singled out for attack in
 the press, and one of its deputy directors, Chou Yang, has

 Approved For Release 2006/SE eIREPf T00826A001000010011-2
 just been revealed in this propaganda as a leader in the
 insinuation of the anti-party "black thread" into China's
 culture and art (a charge that is,  grotesque.  in light of
 Chou's policy speeches of the last decade.)
 Regional Bureaus and Provinces
 All five of the party's regional bureau heads have
 appeared since the fall of Peng Chen and appear to be in
 good standing, although their record of appearances is
 much scantier than in 1965.
 In the sixth bureau, East China, no successor has yet
 been named for Ko Ching.shih, who died in April 1965.  The
 apparent inability of party leaders to agree on a successor
 in 1965 might have beers one of the factors which spurred
 the later dissension.
 Although regional chiefs all remain in good standing,
 many other key officials in the regional bureaus and in the
 provincial party committees are fairly obviously in trouble.
 In the North, East, and Northeast regions, large percentages
 of top party leaders have gone unreported since April.   The
 Northwest, Southwest, and Central-South regions so far have
 been relatively untouched.
 Some elements in this pattern of regional variations
 can be explained as part of a drive to remove associates of
 Peng Chen.  Both East and North China probably included
 strongholds of support for Peng Chen.  Although the nominal
 head of the North China bureau,  Li Hsueh?feng,  is believed
 to be a Teng,Hsiao-ping man, Peng undoubtedly exercised
 considerable authority there.   In East China,  the late Ko
 Ching-shih was considered to be an. ally of Peng.  One of
 the men in trouble in the Northeast is an old associate
 of Peng Chen.
 The Southwest Bureau (which is in good shape) is an
 old stronghold of Teng, who was party boss there in the
 early 1950s.   The current party boss in the Southwest,
 Li Ching?chuan,  is a longtime Teng associate,  The first
 secretary in the Northwest is a Teng appointee, who
 evidently has been successful in keeping Peng Chen men
 out of his area.
 Tao Chu, head of the Central-South bureau, is the only
 regional leader who seems to-have built his own power base.
 There had been some doubt about Tao's status, as he failed
 to show up between 4 April and 2 June, but he was one of the
 top party leaders to greet Chou En-lai at Peking on his
 return from abroad on 1 July.

 IV.   Possible Shakeup of the Military
 An unusual number of key military men are out of public
 view (See Annex D), and there is considerable press criticism.
 of political problems in the armed forces, but in the absence
 of hard information it is difficult to say how deeply the
 military has become embroiled in the political turmoil.   Cer-
 tainly, however, party leaders struggling for power would
 keep the vital factor of the army in mind.
 Press criticism of the military is couched in terms
 of longstanding complaints against "professional military
 men" who resent party control and question Mao's dictum
 that men are more important than weapons.   Peking hints
 that there are still key officers who secretly support Peng
 Te-huai, the defense minister purged in 1959, among other
 things, for objecting to Mao's decision to challenge
 Khrushchev and jeopardize the flow of Soviet military aid.
 There may well be a body of "professionals" under
 attack, but if so it is difficult to equate them to the
 men whose status is now in question.  Most spent their
 careers enforcing party primacy over the military.  Some
 were put in their jobs in'the aftermath of the Peng Te-
 huai purge.  The air force chief is a former commissar.
 Top military men in China are not as obliged as
 political leaders to make frequent public appearances,
 but even so this wholesale failure to show up for three
 months or more is remarkable.   Considering the background
 of the men concerned, the removal of almost any should be

 ANNEX A:   LEADERS WHO HAVE NOT APPEARED IN PUBLIC SINCE APRIL
 A list of 25 leaders whose status was in question was published
 in DD/I Intelligence Memorandum, 17 June 1966 "The Leadership Upheaval
 in Communist China".   Only one of those men, Shantung's first party
 secretary, has reappeared since then.  The 42 names below represent an
 expansion from the original list to include additional figures whose
 political status has come into question.   Roughly 60 men of equal
 stature in the power structure apparently remain  in, good standing.
