 (Information as of noon EDT, 7 October 1965)
 VIETNAM
 At least nine missiles were fired on 5 October at US
 aircraft attacking the vital transportation lines link-
 ing Hanoi with China to the northeast.   One plane was
 shot down.  Most of the SAMs came from an unconfirmed
 site on Cat Ba Island off the coast east of Haiphong.
 The same day the Chinese claimed they too downed one
 of four US aircraft allegedly over Chinese territory.
 North Vietnamese commentary on negotiations continues
 to stress that the US must accept Premier Pham Van
 Dong's four points before there can be any "political
 settlement" of the war.   In the South, Viet Cong mili-
 tary activity is still at a relatively high level, and
 the political situation in the northern provinces re-
 mains unsettled.

 THE INDIA-PAKISTAN SITUATION
 Violations of the cease-fire have declined, but neither
 India nor Pakistan has withdrawn its forces from forward

 issue in the public eye, and continues to infiltrate
 guerrilla forces into Indian-held Kashmir.  The Indians
 are increasingly insistent that the issue is not nego-
 tiable.   Economic repercussions of the fighting are be-
 coming more apparent.   Peking and  New  Delhi  have
 stepped up   diplomatic countercharges, and the Chinese
 also are evincing irritation over Pakistan's recent
 actions.
 THE COUP IN INDONESIA
 The army, having countered a leftist coup on 1 October,
 is for the time being firmly in control of Indonesia.
 The question remains as to whether it now will follow
 President Sukarno in a conciliatory political settle-

 the Communists.

 much.

 The North Vietnamese again
 demonstrated their acute sensi-
 tivity to attacks on the vital
 lines of communication between
 Hanoi and the Chinese border to
 the northeast by reacting vigor-
 ously to a US air strike in that
 area on 5 October.   At least
 nine missiles were fired while
 US Air Force and Navy planes were
 conducting strikes against im-
 portant bridges and an ammuni-
 tion depot near Kep.   One US
 aircraft was shot down by a mis-
 sile--the fifth lost to a SAM
 thus far.
 A Chinese Communist news
 release claimed that Chinese
 fighters shot down one of four
 US aircraft which allegedly
 penetrated Chinese airspace the
 same day.
 At  least seven of the mis-
 siles fired on 5 October were
 seen to come from Cat Ba Island,
 off the North Vietnamese coast
 east of Haiphong.   This prob-
 able SAM site has not yet been
 confirmed by photography.   A
 navy pilot acting as coordinator
 for one of the strikes reported
 seeing another missile being
 launched from an area southwest
 of Kep Airfield.   This site also
 lacks photographic confirmation.
 Hanoi. Comment on Negotiations
 Hanoi continued its public
 commentary on negotiations this
 week.   Although the comments
 reflected no change in its basic
 terms on a political settlement,
 the frequency with which the
 subject was discussed suggests
 an effort to justify the DRV's
 position,and to counter any
 impressions that it is unyield-
 ing or negative.   The discussion
 may also represent a continua-
 tion of what Hanoi considers a
 public dialogue with the US.
 Following last week's of-
 ficial Foreign Ministry memoran-
 dum which re-emphasized the
 DRV's insistence on its four-
 point proposal of last April,
 Premier Pham Van Dong this week
 restated DRV terms for a set-
 tlement on   two  separate oc-
 casions.   At a Hanoi reception
 celebrating Communist China's
 National Day on 1 October,  the
 premier demanded not only Ameri-
 can recognition of the four
 points but also that the US
 "prove it by practical deeds"
 before any talk about a politi-
 cal solution can take place.

 In an interview with an
 Egyptian journalist on the 5th,
 broadcast by Radio Hanoi, the
 premier returned to the less
 precise language of the 23 Sep-
 tember DRV memorandum on negotia-
 tions, asserting that the US must
 "declare" its acceptance of the
 four points before a "political
 settlement can be considered."
 The Liberation Front (NFLSV),
 has again joined in the commen-
 tary on negotiations after sev-
 eral weeks of ignoring the sub-
 ject.                              An NFLSV central committee
 statement of 29 September con-
 demned US "acts of aggression"
 and said that there can "be no
 contact or political solution"
 as'long as they continue.   On 2
 October,  in a statement to the
 Red Cross on prisoner-of-war
 treatment,  the front used the
 POW issue to try to pressure the
 US into direct talks with it.
 The statement said "as long as
 the US refuses to recognize the
 NFLSV as the only authority com-
 petent to settle all questions
 concerning South Vietnam there
 can be no basis for any contact
 to discuss prisoners of war."
 Peking Maintains Hard Line
 Peking continues to mani-
 fest its hard line on Vietnam.
 In a four-hour press conference
 on 29 September, Foreign Minis-
 ter Chen Yi attempted to refur-
 bish the image of a resolute
 and formidable China--an image
 which has been dimmed by Peking's
 failure to follow through pub-
 licly on its commitments to North
 Vietnam.   He declared that China
 was ready for an invasion by the
 US and its henchmen, including
 the Soviet Union.   Chen asserted
 that the war in Vietnam was go-
 ing well for the Viet Cong and
 reiterated Peking's opposition
 to negotiations except on its
 own terms.
 On 3 October Premier Chou
 En-lai reformulated the Chinese
 position on assisting the Viet-
 namese Communists in what ap-
 pears to be another effort to
 harden Peking's public warnings
 without actually increasing the
 Chinese commitment.   Chou de-
 clared that if the US presses
 ahead along the "dangerous path'
 of war expansion, China "will
 unhesitatingly" join the "Indo-
 chinese people" in "completely
 driving the US aggressors out
 of Indochina and the whole of
 Southeast Asia."
 The Chinese treatment of
 the alleged shootdown of the US
 aircraft over China on 5 October
 followed the pattern of pre-
 vious such incidents and re-
 flected no escalation of Peking's
 earlier open threats. New China
 News Agency quoted a responsible
 official of the Chinese Defense
 Ministry as declaring that the

 US "air intrusion" was "another ex-
 tremely serious war provocation" and
 another step toward "imposing war on
 the Chinese people in disregard of
 the repeated warnings, of the Chinese
 Government." The official, however,
 concluded with the standard warning
 implying that China would not take
 the initiative in provoking a war,
 declaring that if the "US dares to
 come, we will dare to hit back."
 South Vietnam     25X1
 In a major address on 1 Octo-
 ber reviewing his first 100 days in
 office, Premier Ky characterized
 the military situation as improved,
 and spoke of plans for social
 and economic betterment in the fu-
 ture.   Several cabinet changes were
 also announced, including the eleva-
 tion of General Co to deputy premier
 for pacification, in addition to his
 duties as minister of war.   The si-
 multaneous announcement of a new
 secretary for rural construction
 and subsequent discussions of rural
 pacification with US Embassy offi-
 cials indicate a renewed interest
 by the Vietnamese Government in
 this key aspect.
 The political situation in
 northernmost I Corps, meanwhile,
 remains unsettled.   Buddhist re-
 sentments have focused on the ci-
 vilian chief of Quang Tri Prov-
 ince--a Catholic and Dai Viet party
 member.   Further nonviolent pres-
 sure for his removal seems likely,
 according to the US consul in Hud.
 For the first time,  I Corps  com-
 mander General Thi has been openly
 criticized by militant students in
 Hud.  A newspaper published by
 these elements also criticized US
 policies and military presence in
 South Vietnam.   This may foreshadow
 a. renewed antigovernment campaign,
 although the student group respon-
 sible presently does not have a
 large following.
 Despite record high casualties
 during the past two weeks, Viet
 Cong military activity continues
 at a relatively high level, includ-
 ing several recent battalion-size
 attacks.   Heavy fighting flared
 again during the week in the Phu Cu
 Pass area of Binh Dinh Province--
 the scene of two major engagements
 during the previous week. Further
 heavy fighting in this area seems
 likely in view of the concentration
 of government and Communist forces,
 including probable elements of the
 North Vietnamese 325th Division.
 Viet Cong forces are also show-
 ing increased resistance to US Army
 and Marine patrols in Bien Hoa Prov-
 ince and near Da Nang.   Meanwhile,
 the number of incidents in the delta
 area south of Saigon continues at a
 hi h level.

 SOVIET INDUSTRIAL REORGANIZATION ENHANCES BREZHNEV'S POSITION
 The USSR Supreme Soviet,
 meeting last week to enact the
 industrial reorganization pre-
 sented by Premier Kosygin at the
 party central committee plenum
 several days earlier, also made
 several top-level appointments
 which appear to have a political
 overtone.   Belying rumors which
 had been widely current, Kosygin
 and party First Secretary Brezhnev
 emerged   from the meetings with
 their positions intact.   Brezhnev,
 in particular, has managed to re-
 inforce his influence in the
 Kremlin hierarchy.
 The Supreme Soviet swept
 away the system of regional eco-
 nomic councils  (sovnarkhozy) es-
 tablished by Khrushchev and
 created 28 vertically organized
 industrial ministries.   The USSR
 Council of Ministers remains an
 oversize body of 100 members,
 despite the shuffling of minis-
 terial personnel.   Changes at the
 deputy premier level, the actual
 locus of governmental power,
 should have the effect of strength
 ening Brezhnev politically.
 Dmitry Polyansky, a close
 associate of Brezhnev and a. major
 architect of the agricultural
 program put forward by the first
 secretary last March, was pro-
 moted from deputy to first deputy
 premier, a post he now shares
 with Kirill Mazurov.   His eleva-
 tion, together with the promotion
 earlier in the week of Fedor
 Kulakov--believed to be close to
 Polyansky--constitutes a reaffir-
 mation of the regime's commitment
 to a new approach in agriculture.
 With his promotion,-Polyan-.
 sky now outranks in the Council
 of Ministers Aleksandr Shelepin,
 another of the ambitious younger
 leaders, who now is the sole
 party presidium member serving
 in the council below the rank
 of first deputy premier.   More-
 over, the speeches of both
 Kosygin and Brezhnev at the
 plenum contained no mention, as
 might have been expected,  of
 Shelepin's party-state control
 apparatus.   Indeed, Brezhnev's
 call for a large role for pri-
 mary party organizations within
 the new ministerial system,
 suggests that the power of Shele -
 pin's organization may be weak-
 ened.
 Nikolay Tikhonov,  one of
 three newly appointed premiers,
 has old ties with Brezhnev.
 In the past a deputy chairman
 of Gosplan,  he now is probably
 serving as minister without
 portfolio, much as Polyansky has
 served for three years.   The two
 other new deputy premiers, Nik-
 olay Baybakov and Vladimir
 Kirillin, have no obviously close
 connections with any of the top
 leaders.   Baybakov, however, was
 chairman of Gosplan from 1955-
 1957, a period when Kosygin be-
 came involved in central planning
 prior to his chairmanship of
 Gosplan in 1959 and 1960.   Kiril-
 lin has had important positions
 in both the party and government.
 The election of Brezhnev
 to the  Presidium of the Supreme
 Soviet gives him a formal govern-
 ment post from which he can

 TITO'S VISIT TO BULGARIA
 The major accomplishment of
 Yugoslav President Tito's 22-27
 September official visit to Bul-
 garia--his first since 1947--
 was to re-establish contacts be-
 tween the two national parties.
 Such contacts had remained in
 abeyance despite limited improve-
 ment of state relations in the
 past year.
 The essential problem has
 been the conservatism of the Bul-
 garian party hierarchy, many of
 whose members fear the possible
 divisive effects of Yugoslav doc-
 trinal unorthodoxy on the Bulgar-
 ian party.   Their apprehensions
 will not quickly disappear.
 Although Yugoslav-Bulgarian
 economic relations were not
 stressed in the joint communiqud
 signed at the end of the visit,
 increased economic cooperation
 apparently figured prominently
 in the talks.   When addressing
 itself to the international scene,
 the communiqud reflected positions
 more identifiable with Belgrade
 than with Sofia.   Thus, the moder-
 ate references to US aggression
 in Vietnam contrasted sharply
 with Sofia's customary hard stand
 on this issue.   The communiqud
 also repeatedly stressed the Yug-
 oslav position that  "national
 peculiarities" require different
 approaches to Communism, and made
 no reference to the unity of "the
 socialist movement."
 There were also gains for
 Sofia., however. Tito's visit to
 Bulgaria, as well as the one by
 Rumanian party chief Ceausescu
 earlier in September, probably
 strengthened Bulgarian party boss
 Zhivkov's domestic position.   By
 inviting two such independent-
 minded leaders, Zhivkov may have
 been responding in part to Soviet
 advice to improve Sofia's external
 posture in the wake of the anti-
 regime conspiracy discovered last
 April.   The visits also are con-
 sonant with Zhivkov's efforts
 over the past 20 months to promote

 the normalization of relations in

 Nevertheless, strains in
 Yugoslav-Bulgarian ties are still
 apparent, and basic policy differ-
 ences persist.   Friction periodi-

 minorities resident in each coun-

 tively easy to establish innoc-
 uous contacts such as sending Yu-
 goslav musicians to Bulgaria, it
 is quite difficult to develop con-
 tacts in the journalism and pub-
 lishing fields, and particularly
 to exchange political information.
 These long-standing difficulties
 are unlikely to be easily or
 quickly resolved.

 NEW ELEMENTS IN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP
 Two tough veteran revolu-
 tionaries--Tao Chu,  chief of the
 party's central-south regional
 bureau, and army Chief of Gen-
 eral Staff Lo Jui-ching--are be-
 coming increasingly important
 figures in the Chinese Communist
 regime.   They have a strong back-
 ground in party, propaganda, or
 security work and are probably
 representative of the kind of
 men being groomed for major
 leadership roles.   Each is 58,
 several years younger than most
 of the 71-year-old Mao Tse-tung's
 immediate lieutenants.
 Neither man is on the polit-
 buro,  the Chinese equivalent of
 the Soviet presidium, but this
 may mean merely that they were
 second-ranking offi
 cials in 1958, when
 formal additions
 were last made to
 the body.   Both
 would almost cer-
 tainly be included
 in a public listing
 if a new one were
 issued today.
 Tao Chu,  a
 former political
 commissar in the
 army, was secretary
 of the Kwangtung
 provincial party committee in
 the 1950s.   In 1961 he was named
 first secretary of the central-
 south bureau, one of six newly
 created and powerful regional
 bureaus of the party.   He ac-
 quired a major government posi-
 tion for the first time in De-
 cember 1964 when he was named
 vice premier.
 In the summer of 1965 Tao
 emerged as an influential party
 figure of national importance
 when half a dozen articles pre-
 senting his views on agriculture
 and various aspects of culture,
 obviously mirroring views held
 by Mao Tse-tung, were published
 in authoritative newspapers and
 journals in Peking.   Such ex-
 posure of an individual's name
 in national publications is un-
 precedented in recent years,  and
 apparently reflects an effort to
 build up Tao's stature as a party
 leader capable of formulating
 concrete policies which put Mao's
 high-flown and nebulous precepts
 into practice.
 Tao's articles urge a greater
 role for politics
 in agriculture--a
 prescription that
 allegedly  will
 bring about a "new
 great leap forward"
 throughout China--
 and adoption of an
 extremely stiff
 anti-intellectual
 line in cultural
 affairs.  Tao's
 exhortation demand-
 ing a political
 solution to rural
 problems was fol-
 lowed closely by the establish-
 ment of a new central committee
 unit named the Political Work
 Department for Agriculture and
 Forestry.   Its formation com-
 pletes a process begun in 1964
 to establish an army-style polit-
 ical structure throughout the
 economy.

 Tao Chu  has a harsh, color-
 ful style that evidently appeals
 to Mao Tse-tung.   In a recently
 published speech to a group of
 theatrical workers he asserted
 that a "little coercion" of in-
 tellectuals is a good thing.
 Noting that people generally con-
 demn Emperor Chin Shih Huang Ti
 for burning books and burying
 scholars alive 2,200 years ago,
 he defended the right of the
 Communists to do "the same sort
 of thing," in order to consoli-
 date their rule and their ideo-
 logical position. In the same
 speech Tao declared flatly that
 he was imposing a total ban on
 performance of traditional plays
 and opera in the central-south
 region.   He said:   "Only revolu-
 tionary modern plays now will be
 allowed to be written and pro-
 duced.   Is that not too crude
 and arbitrary?  No.    Man is like
 that. Sometimes he has to be
 put under pressure."
 According to a Soviet prop-
 aganda   blast at Chinese leaders
 made in 1963, Tao Chu once cal-
 lously advised a visiting Czech-
 oslovak official to accept phil-
 osophically the possible loss
 of his entire country in a thermo-
 nuclear war, and to think in-
 stead of the benefits such a war
 would bring to the world Commu-
 nist movement.
 Lo Jui-ching is not a the-
 oretician like Tao Chu,  but his
 numerous positions and influence
 in the army, party, and security
 apparatus make hint one of the
 most powerful men in China.   He
 ,is chief of general staff of the
 People's Liberation Army (PLA);
 secretary general of the mili-
 tary affairs committee,  the
 party's supreme organ for making
 military policy; a member of the
 party's key secretariat; and a
 vice premier.   Lo was minister
 of public security from 1949 to
 1959,  and there is evidence
 that he is still actively involved
 in public security work.
 In addition, Lo Jui-ching
 has to function as a de facto
 military commander most of the
 time since his superior, Minis-
 ter of National Defense Lin Piao,
 is chronically ill.   Lo rather
 than Lin usually represents the
 military at ceremonial affairs
 and often makes important mili-
 tary pronouncements.
 Both Tao and Lo appear to
 be Mao's personal favorites and
 are not closely associated with
 the other leaders.   Both appear
 to have reached positions which
 will make them important figures
 in the event a struggle develops
 over the succession after Mao
 goes.

 PEKING BACKS AWAY FROM AFRO-ASIAN CONFERENCE
 It now is extremely doubtful
 that the long-heralded Second
 Afro-Asian Conference will be
 held as scheduled in Algiers on
 5 November. There is a marked
 lack of enthusiasm among most
 moderate African and Asian na-
 tions and a growing resentment
 of heavy-handed Chinese efforts
 to stage-manage the proceedings.
 This is evident even among the
 more militant and radical na-
 tions that are normally sympa-
 thetic to Peking.
 Algeria,  the host country,
 has not yet issued formal invita-
 tions, and the 15-nation prepar-
 atory committee has not met since
 late June when it announced post-
 ponement of the conference until
 November.   Officials in Algiers
 have indicated both publicly and
 privately that they would just
 as soon the whole thing were
 postponed or dropped altogether.
 The Chinese also now appear to
 be having doubts about the de-
 sirability of the conference.
 The Chinese had hoped to
 duplicate their success at Ban-
 dung ten years ago, but have re-
 cently become disenchanted be-
 cause it now is clear that they
 would not be able to control the
 Algiers conference.   Peking has
 adamantly insisted that the
 Soviet Union be excluded and
 that all participants agree on
 an explicit condemnation of "US
 imperialism."
 On both issues Peking ap-
 pears to have received resound-
 ing rebuffs.   The UAR endorsed
 Soviet attendance in the communi-
 qud at the conclusion of Nasir's
 visit to Moscow on 1 September,
 although the Egyptians are not
 anxious that the conference be
 held next month.
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi
 apparently came a cropper during
 his visits to Algeria, Guinea,
 and Mali in early September and
 seems to have antagonized his
 hosts in all three countries.
 In Bamako he reportedly railed
 against Moscow's "defection to
 the imperialists," and lectured
 angrily on Mali's shortcomings
 as a socialist state.
 Chen appears to have bee
 n equally
 tactless in Guinea, and
 both
 visits ended without the
 custom-
 ary joint communiqud, ap
 parently
 as a result of sharp dif
 ferences
 over the Afro-Asian Conference.
 In Algeria, Chen is reported
 to have castigated officials for
 inviting the UN Secretary General
 as an observer,  and in his wide-
 ranging press conference on his
 return to Peking he delivered a
 virtual ultimatul that China
 would not attend an Afro-Asian
 gathering at which the Soviets
 were seated.

 Violations of the cease-fire
 have declined and both India and
 Pakistan now seem willing to see
 the incidents along the front fur-
 ther reduced.   Neither has with-
 drawn its forces from forward po-
 sitions,  however,  and tensions re-
 main high.
 President Ayub has issued
 strict instructions to Pakistani
 troops to observe the cease-fire,
 and Pakistani officers reportedly
 now are more willing to comply.
 The Pakistanis continue,  however,
 to stress the extreme fragility
 of the cease-fire arrangement in
 an effort to keep the Kashmir is-
 sue before the public eye.   They
 have most recently alleged an
 Indian build-up for an attack
 near Ferozepore.
 Infiltration of Azad (free)
 Kashmir  forces into Indian-held
 Kashmir apparently continues.
 Pakistani newsmen in Azad Kashmir
 reported recently that they had
 observed several companies of men
 without insignia who were described
 by a local official as being reg-
 ular Azad Kashmir units trained
 as guerrillas and preparing to in-
 filtrate Indian lines.   Although
 India continues mopping-up efforts,
 upwards of 3,000 infiltrators, who
 began their intrusions in early
 August, are believed still at
 large behind Indian lines in Kash-
 mir.
 The UN observer mission which
 is to supervise the cease-fire is
 still far from
 fully operational,
 and
 fewer than half it
 s members
 have
 arrived.   The US
 Embassy in
 New
 Delhi reports the
 impression
 that
 the UN operation
 is still
 wobbly, uncertain, and ineffec-
 tive.   The embassy states that
 strong and creative leadership
 by General MacDonald and his mis-
 sion is needed at the various
 points of conflict, since Indian
 politicians and civil servants
 seem poorly informed and some-
 what baffled as to how to pro-
 ceed.
 There is still no sign of
 give by either side on the basic
 issue underlying the recent con-
 flict--Kashmir.   Pakistani offi-
 cials stress that progress on this
 issue is vital if peace is to be
 maintained on the subcontinent.
 The Indians,  on the other hand,
 are increasingly insistent that
 the Kashmir question is not nego-
 tiable.                                                                                  Backed by a buoyant pub-
 lic opinion and obviously reflect-
 ing a sense of having "won" the
 war, Prime Minister Shastri, Con-
 gress Party boss Kamaraj,and De-
 fense Minister Chavan have all
 taken an adamant public position
 on this issue in the past week.
 Chavan and Kamaraj  in addition
 have reflected Indian sensitiv-
 ity to possible Western pressure
 on India to compromise.  Kamaraj
 has declared that any power which
 aids Pakistan is an "enemy" of
 India,  and Chavan has threatened
 to "go it alone" if the West seeks
 to cut off aid to India.

 Attempts to make progress on
 the Kashmir issue within the UN
 have also made little progress.
 Secretary General Thant says that
 last week Soviet Foreign Minister
 Gromyko was "somewhat" negative
 concerning a proposed four-power
 Security Council committee to as-
 sist Thant in implementing the re-
 cent Security Council resolutions.
 UN Under Secretary Bunche, describ-
 ing the idea as "moribund," attrib-
 uted Moscow's stand to India's
 "stiff opposition."   The Soviets
 probably are also concerned that
 their participation in such a com-
 mission wouldgive Peking new am-
 munition to charge US-Soviet col-
 lusion.
 Satisfied that a cease-fire
 of sorts has been effected, the
 Soviets will probably now move
 cautiously and avoid any initia-
 tives which run the risk of alien-
 ating Pakistan or especially India.
 Recent Soviet protests concerning
 the organization and financing of
 the UN cease-fire observer mission
 seem intended to underscore the
 standard Soviet contention that
 only the Security Council--with
 its big-power veto--has the au-
 thority to establish the guide-
 lines of UN "peacekeeping"  opera-
 tions.
 Economic repercussions of the
 recent conflict are becoming more
 apparent in both India and Pak-
 istan and are likely to multiply.
 The military confrontation has
 caused disruptions in both land
 transport and ocean shipping.
 Production cutbacks or shutdowns
 in many factories have increased
 unemployment.   A tight credit
 situation is also evident in
 Pakistan,  and in parts of west-
 ern India rice and wheat rations
 have been cut.
 On the Sino-Indian border
 there has been almost no activ-
 ity on the ground,  but both sides
 have stepped up the tempo of dip-
 lomatic charge and countercharge.
 Almost daily Peking and New Delhi
 exchange notes alleging frontier
 incursions.
 Sino-Pakistani relations ap-
 pear on the surface to be as warm
 as ever,  and Peking is evidently
 seeking to consolidate and in-
 crease its ties with Rawalpindi.
 The Chinese,  however,  are evinc-
 ing signs of irritation with re-

 particularly outraged the army
 because it involved the torture

 top generals.
 President Sukarno,  however,
 in the interest of national unity
 and fearing the political ascend-
 ency of the army,  has asserted
 that the present situation is a
 political problem that requires a
 political solution and that he
 wishes to settle it himself.   In
 a statement following a cabinet
 meeting on 6 October at Bogor Pal-
 ace, he stressed the need to avoid
 divisiveness in Indonesia's  polit-
 ical  life or between the military
 services.   He apparently hopes to
 return the Communist Party to the
 favorable political position it
 enjoyed before 1 October.
 The major question is whether
 the army will follow Sukarno in
 a conciliatory political settle-
 ment or whether it will insist on
 anti-Communist action.
 The coup was carried out by
 a group which called itself the
 "30 September movement" and was
 led by Lt. Col. Untung of Sukar-

 Meanwhile the PKI is trying
 to undercut the army's efforts to
 move against it by denying com-
 plicity in the coup.   The party--
 officially silent since 1 October
 --has issued a statement on 5
 October through its information
 bureau declaring that the PKI
 central committee did not par-
 ticipate in the 30 September
 movement and that the coup group
 did not request the approval of
 party members whose names were
 included in the short-lived "Rev-
 olutionary Council."   The party
 fully supports the "message of
 President Sukarno"--presumably
 his call to preserve unity and
 not take revenge--and calls on
 all members and sympathizers to
 help carry it out.
 Although the army has tried
 to suppress the statement,  it
 has become public knowledge.
 Subandrio alluded to it on 6 Oc-
 tober, and the world press is
 reporting it.   Internally it may
 take a few days to filter down
 to lower levels in view of pres-

 ADDITIONAL SOVIET ECONOMIC AID FOR BURMA
 More Soviet economic aid
 will be extended to Burma as a
 result of Premier Ne Win's re-
 cent visit to Moscow.
 Burma's minister of mines,
 now touring the USSR studying min-
 ing and fishing industries,  in-
 dicated that Soviet aid may be
 forthcoming for such enterprises
 in Burma.   The USSR may also pro-
 vide aid for industrial construc-
 tion,  oil exploration,  and geo-
 logical surveys.      However,  details
 of the new Soviet credit remain
 to be worked out.
 Total Soviet economic aid
 extended to Burma since 1956 has
 amounted to only about $14 mil-
 lion,  accounted for mainly by
 the Kyetauktaung dam,  a techni-
 cal institute,  a hospital,  agri-
 cultural equipment,                     and a hotel.
 Most of these projects have bees,
 completed except for the dam,  a
 modest project which is in the
 final stages of construction.
 Several other Soviet aid projects
 agreed to in the mid-1950s were
 canceled by Burma as uneconomic.
 By way of comparison,  the
 Chinese aid effort in Burma totals
 $84 million, one of Peking's
 largest economic aid commitments
 in the free world.   Chinese aid
 projects include paper, textile,
 and plywood plants, bridges, sugar
 mills, and irrigation projects.
 Other Communist economic aid to
 Burma has been provided by Poland,
 which recently extended a $10-
 million economic credit and Czech-
 oslovakia, which has supplied a
 small amount of agricultural
 equipment.
 NASIR RESHUFFLES CABINET IN EGYPT
 President Nasir, in pursuit
 of a plan nourished since his
 re-election in March, last week
 designated Zakariya Muhieddin
 to form a new cabinet to increase
 efficiency and revivify the na-
 tion's spirit.   The regime evi-

 solving internal problems.   No
 changes in foreign policy have
 been announced, but Cairo may be
 considering a reduction of its
 involvement in expensive foreign
 operations.
 Prime Minister Muhieddin
 has been a close and loyal as-
 sociate of Nasir's since the
 1952 revolution, and he is ex-

 policies faithfully.   Previously

 up the regime's surveillance
 and control of subversive groups
 like the Muslim Brotherhood,
 which has recently re-emerged
 as a focus of public discontent
 and disorder.
 The retention of a highly
 qualified group of economic min-
 isters implies that the economic
 rationality they have recommended
 may now gain greater acceptance.
 In the past Nasir's concern for
 rapid economic growth and for
 influence in world affairs fre-
 quently led him to reject the
 advice of his economists.   Now,
 however, Egypt's precarious
 economic position is forcing
 him to face realistically this
 greatest threat to his regime.
 Former prime minister Ali
 Sabri has been appointed sec-
 retary general of the flounder-
 ing Arab Socialist Union (ASU),
 Egypt's sole legal political
 organization.   Nasir created
 this state party to instill revo-
 lutionary consciousness and fer-
 vor in the people,  and hopes
 that the energetic,  ideologically
 oriented Sabri can provide the
 forceful leadership the ASU needs
 if it is to have any chance of
 overcoming the apathy that has
 gripped it since its inception
 in 1962.
 The shift of the left-lean-
 ing Sabri to a position of es-
 sentially internal significance
 may have been motivated in part
 by a desire to placate the US
 from whom Nasir desperately needs
 to obtain a new PL-480 food as-
 sistance agreement.   Without
 this aid, which has amounted to
 $150 million  annually, Egypt's
 economy would have to undergo
 sharp cutbacks, slowing growth
 and leadin   to public disaffec-
 tion.
 RHODESIAN INDEPENDENCE AT ISSUE IN LONDON
 As Harold Wilson and Rho-
 desian Prime Minister Ian Smith
 opened talks this week in London,
 the Wilson government appeared
 determined to talk tough.
 The British. prime minister,
 with the full support of his
 cabinet, will threaten severe
 economic sanctions if Rhodesia
 makes a unilateral declaration
 of independence (UDI)  as expected
 within the next few weeks.   Al-
 though a definite course of ac-
 tion apparently has not been de-
 cided on,  US Embassy officials
 in London believe that a UK em-
 bargo on Rhodesia's major ex-
 port crop,  tobacco, would be a
 virtual  certainty,  and that
 this might in turn lead to a
 wide-scale trade embargo.

 The UK is concerned lest
 sanctions provoke Rhodesian re-
 taliation against Zambia,  from
 which the UK imports 50 percent
 of its copper.   Zambia relies
 on Rhodesia for coal, rail ac-

 ANTI-TSHOMBE POLITICIANS JOIN IN CONGO
 Intensive political maneu-

 the Congolese Parliament has
 led to an open challenge to
 Premier Tshombd.
 On 1 October,  Interior Min-
 ister Nendaka announced the for-
 mation of a new group--the Congo-
 lese Democratic Front (FDC)  to
 oppose Tshombd's national coali-

 organize such a voting bloc

 candidate narrowly defeated a
 Conaco man for the Senate presi-
 dency.   However, Tshombd-sup-
 ported candidates won the Senate
 vice-presidency and both top
 positions in the more powerful
 Chamber of Deputies.   Conaco is
 still the largest voting bloc
 in Parliament, but Congolese

 MAJOR PARTIES CLASH IN NIGERIAN REGIONAL ELECTIONS
 All four major Nigerian par-
 ties are involved in a campaign
 for regional parliamentary elec-
 tions to be held in the country's
 Western Region on 11 October.  The
 conservative,  incumbent party
 appears to hold a slight edge by
 virtue of its control of the
 election machinery and its back-
 ing by the group which dominates
 the federal government.   The
 frustrated opposition may resort
 to violence.
 The Western Region has
 been politically unsettled since
 1962 when a split in the then
 ruling Action Group brought an
 unpopular splinter party to power.
 This splinter,  now known as the
 Nigerian National Democratic
 Party  (NNDP),probably would not
 win a majority of the 94 par-
 liamentary seats in a fair elec-
 tion.   Its major liability is
 the serious economic situation
 in the West--once the federation's
 richest region--brought on mainly
 by the decline in the price of
 cocoa, the state's main crop.
 In an effort to retain
 power,  the NNDP has turned to
 general pressure tactics and
 apparently to electoral rigging.
 It has banned all public meet-
 ings and demonstrations.   On
 30 September the electoral com-
 mission announced that 15 NNDP
 candidates had been returned
 unopposed.   The opposition is
 challenging this in the courts,
 and may yet turn to more dras-
 tic measures.   A similar devel-
 opment in the federal elec-
 tions last December resulted in
 a boycott and a major political
 crisis.
 Sporadic violence has al-
 ready been reported in the West,
 although the region has been
 flooded with police and army
 units.   Despite federal Prime
 Minister Balewa's promise to
 use whatever force is necessary
 to maintain order,  a major up-
 rising would seriously tax fed-
 eral security forces and could
 severely strain the federation
 itself.
 The election pits the NNDP,
 allied with the Northern Region's
 powerful conservative Northern
 People's Congress  (NPC),  against a
 progressive alliance of the Action
 Group and the National Convention
 of Nigerian Citizens  (NCNC) which
 controls the Eastern and Mid-
 Western Regions.
 Barring a major upheaval,
 the postelection period will
 probably see defections to the     25X1
 winning side and possibly the
 West's return to a virtual one-
 party system such as prevails
 in the other three regions

 NYERERE TIGHTENS CONTROL IN TANZANIA
 President Nyerere,  strength-
 ened by the outcome of Tanzania's
 national elections late last
 month, has tightened his control
 of the government.   His reorgan-
 ized cabinet reflects his deter-
 mination to concentrate on domes-
 tic development and may presage
 a period of improved relations
 with the US.
 Nyerere's overwhelming per-
 sonal endorsement at the polls
 gave him freedom to make exten-
 sive changes in his one-party
 state.   He has assumed the ex-
 ternal affairs portfolio and
 transferred his radical national-
 ist foreign minister, Oscar Kam-
 bona, to the Ministry of Regional
 Administration.  Nyerere is likely
 to continue his policy of non-
 alignment and his support for
 southern African liberation, but
 he may try to tone down his more
 extremist countrymen in order to
 improve Tanzania's image in the
 West, particularly the US.
 During the past year the
 emphasis on supporting Congolese
 rebels and other "liberation"
 movements has drained the coun-
 try's resources, jeopardized its
 security,  and strained relations
 with Washington.   Nyerere's ex-
 pectations of Communist eco-
 nomic aid have not been fulfilled,
 and he has become increasingly
 aware that only the major Western
 powers can provide the bulk of
 the aid he needs.   His appoint-
 ment of a top-notch,  trusted
 career officer to be the new
 ambassador to Washington is in-
 dicative of the impression he
 is trying to create. The new
 finance minister is an able,
 long-time confidant of Nyerere.
 Other changes have improved the
 government's competence and
 energy in the development field.
 Nyerere apparently is con-
 tinuing to balance the factions
 represented on the one hand by
 Kambona and on the other by
 party leaders allied with Vice
 President Kawawa.  Those on the
 Kawawa group resent the ambi-
 tious Kambona, who was studying
 in England while they were build-
 ing the preindependence party,
 and they have been maneuvering
 to oust him as party secretary
 general.   By relieving the over-
 worked and ailing Kambona of   .
 his foreign affairs role instead,
 Nyerere has put him in a posi-
 tion to control and consolidate
 party and government structures
 at the regional level.
 At the same time the trans-
 fer of Kambona's closest cohort
 from the Ministry of Home Af-
 fairs, which controls police,
 refugee movements, and clandes-
 tine arms, places all security
 and defense under the Kawawa
 faction which is as radical as
 Kambona but more responsive to
 Nyer er e .

 Europe
 A more determined opposition
 to De Gaulle's efforts to recast
 the Common Market may be emerg-
 ing from talks among France's five
 EEC partners.   The loose "coali-
 tion" is still eagerly looking for
 an end to the crisis before the
 mere passage of time does serious
 damage, but it appears unwilling
 to accept De Gaulle's terms or
 even the toned-down interpreta-
 tions which some French officials
 have been passing out.
 New instructions which Bonn
 has given its EEC delegation in
 Brussels reject any revision of
 the EEC treaty to diminish the
 role of the commission or to elim-
 inate the provisions for majority
 voting.   Bonn is willing to talk
 about improving cooperation be-
 tween the commission and the mem-
 ber governments, but it is wary
 of any formal understanding on
 either issue.   With respect to
 financing the common agricultural
 policy--the question which sparked
 the French walk-out on 30 June--
 the Germans will insist that sat-
 isfaction of the French on this
 be linked to progress on matters
 of interest to the other members.
 Although still under consid-
 eration, Belgian Foreign Minister
 Spaak's proposal for at least one
 meeting of the Six without the
 commission is also being treated
 with greater caution.   The Dutch
 and the Germans are insisting
 that any such meeting be in the
 EEC framework,  that it be a reg-
 ular session of the EEC Council,
 and that the commission be called
 in on any discussion of matters
 under its purview.   The Italians
 also want the five to reach agree-
 ment on agricultural financing
 before they talk to the French.
 If the five decide to pro-   25X1
 ceed with the Spaak offer,  it is
 questionable that the French will
 accept,  even thought
 De Gaulle might welcome an agricul-
 tural agreement just before the
 French presidential elections on
 5 December.   When council Presi-
 dent Fanfani met with French For-
 eign Minister Couve de Murville
 in New York on 29 September, Couve
 was emphatic that the EEC treaty
 must be "aylapted to the realities
 of intergovernmental relations"
 through gentlemen's agreements
 negotiated in an intergovernmental
 framework before an agricultural
 settlement is reached.   He also
 made it clear that France would
 not attend a meeting of the Six
 during the electoral campaign.
 The  five thus face the
 possibility that the French boy-
 cott will continue   until at
 least early next year, and al-
 though they are exasperated with
 De Gaulle's blowing hot and cold,
 it is uncertain how far their
 courage will permit them to go.
 Pressure to take pending commu-
 nity decision,  some with unavoid-
 able deadlines, may be equaled
 by pressures to avoid decisions
 in hope   something will turn up,
 or out of fear that they might
 provide De Gaulle the excuse to
 leave the community.                   25X1

 BRITISH LABOR PARTY CONFERENCE SHOWS FIRM WILSON CONTROL
 Prime Minister Wilson emerged
 from the Labor Party's conference
 last week with increAsed stature
 as a national leader and a tight
 grip on the party organization.
 He successfully turned back left-
 wing attempts to put the confer-
 ence on the record criticizing the
 government's foreign and domestic
 policies.   His success helped to
 dispel the public's belief that
 the trade unions and the party's
 left wing exercise a veto over the
 government's policies.
 With the approach of a new
 parliamentary session, Labor Party
 supporters are increasingly opti-
 inistic that the Wilson government
 will remain in office despite its
 extremely narrow majority in Com-
 mons.   The pound sterling's posi-
 tion is stronger,  and there is im-
 provement in Britain's balance of
 payments compared with the same
 period last year.
 As a result, the optimism
 which filled Conservative Party
 ranks following the election of
 their new leader,   Edward Heath,
 has been dissipated.   In addition,
 faulty tactics by Heath--notably
 in condemning out of hand the
 government's new economic plan
 which leading businessmen helped
 to draft--have tarnished his pub-
 lic image.   The US Embassy in
 London reports that Heath now
 realizes that such attacks on
 government policy have been too
 broad and negative.   He therefore
 intends to use the Conservative
 Party conference--opening next
 week in Brighton--to spell out a
 constructive prescription for
 Britain's economic health and to
 build the  groundwork  for a vig-
 orous attack on the government's
 program when Parliament assembles
 on 9 November.
 In the meantime two by-elec-
 tions are expected,  one in the
 Tory stronghold of London/West-
 minster  and the other in the
 Labor seat of Erith/Crayford.
 Both results will be carefully
 scrutinized to detect an  shift
 in  7 ty standings.

 DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT STILL
 Incidents in Santo Domingo
 during the past week suggest that
 Communist groups have begun car-
 rying out their reported terror-
 ist campaign to delay elections
 and create anti-US sentiment by
 provoking clashes between Domini-
 cans and US troops.   In four
 separate incidents, six US sol-
 diers and nine Dominicans were
 wounded.
 Former president Joaquin
 Balaguer claims, however, that
 the terrorist strikes are not the
 work of extreme leftists or Com-
 munists but rather of the "re-
 actionary element," which hopes,
 by spreading fear and panic, to
 establish an atmosphere conducive
 to a violent right-wing coup.
 The    Octo er
 om  ng of the offices of the pro-
 rebel weekly magazine Ahora may
 have been carried out by rightist
 elements.
 The propaganda chief of Juan
 Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary
 Party  (PRD),  Jose Pena Gomez,  has
 stressed to Ambassador Bennett
 his concern over the mounting
 pressures from the extreme left.
 Pena Gomez painted a picture of
 CHALLENGED FROM LEFT AND RIGHT
 intense Communist effort to suc-
 ceed to the PRD's pre-eminent
 position in the rebel camp.   He
 said the Communists were especially
 active in the labor field and had
 taken over the leadership of the
 PRD labor movement.   Pena Gomez
 termed the arms collection program
 almost a total failure, although
 he did indicate that rebel leader
 Caamano  has  made  a good try.
 The program for integrating
 rebel officers into the armed
 forces remains stalled, although
 27 rebels who individually requested
 integration   this   week  were
 accepted at the ranks they held
 in April and assigned to army
 posts outside the capital.----~  25X1
 The hassle over control of
 the University of Santo Domingo
 continues unresolved.   The post-
 ponement of a scheduled meeting
 of the university's governing body
 until 9 October leaves the campus
 in the hands of the Communist-
 influenced insurgent university
 council.   The delay indicates the
 weakness or disorganization of
 the legitimate authorities, who
 apparently still hope for force-
 ful support from Garcia Godoy.
 The President's intentions, how-
 ever,  remain unclear.

 critical of the US and the In-

 continued occupation of several
 public school buildings by IAPF
 troops.  Also, the continued
 operation of the Voice of the
 Dominican Armed Forces at the
 San Isidro Air Base in defiance
 of a government order to close

 OPPOSITION GAINS IN BRAZILIAN
 The gubernatorial elections
 in Brazil on 3 October have re-
 sulted in apparent victories in
 the key states of Guanabara and
 Minas Gerais by candidates con-
 nected with forces in opposition
 to the Castello Branco govern-
 ment.   In both states, nearly
 complete returns show supporters
 of former president Kubitschek
 far ahead.   The outcome may also
 undercut the presidential as-
 pirations of the incumbent gov-
 ernors, Carlos Lacerda of Guana-
 bara and Magalhaes Pinto of
 Minas Gerais, who had campaigned
 for other candidates.
 The strong showing by Fran-
 cisco Negrao de Lima in Guana-
 bara and Israel Pinheiro in
 Minas Gerais, both Social Demo-
 crats, presents serious problems
 for the administration.   In ad-
 dition to his close ties to
 Kubitschek, Negrao de Lima has
 GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS
 accepted Communist Party support
 in the campaign.
 The final results in the
 other nine states involved prob-
 ably will be unavailable for at
 least several days, but incom-
 plete returns show one or two
 disturbing trends as far as the
 government is concerned.   The
 strong showing in Alagoas of
 Social Democrat Muniz Falcao, for
 example, suggests a continuation
 of corrupt local politics that
 the administration has been de-
 termined to eliminate.
 Military leaders have re-
 acted strongly to. the election
 results, which they regard as
 representing a resurgence of
 leftist influences and corrup-
 tion.   President Castello Branco

 ones, made him too dangerous and
 disruptive an element.   Guevara's
 views on future Cuban economic
 development, the part Cuba should
 play in the Sino-Soviet dispute,
 and Cuba's role as a catalyst
 and supporter of revolutions in
 Africa and Latin America all
 seem to have been determining
 factors.
 Guevara was the chief arch-
 itect of Cuba's economy and the
 policy of accelerated industri-
 alization at the expense of agri-
 cultural production.   By late
 1963, the new industries had
 proven inefficient and the Cuban
 economy was in chaos.   Soviet
 advisers, among others, recom-
 mended a "rationalization," with
 heavy stress on agricultural
 production, economic decentrali-
 zation, and the use of material
 incentives to increase produc-
 tion.   Castro has been imple-
 menting this change, but Guevara
 apparently continued to oppose
 it.
 By excluding Guevara and
 four of his close associates
 from the new central committee
 of the Cuban Communist Party,
 Castro has renounced the economic
 policies they once represented.
 In a speech on 28 September,
 Castro revealed that he would
 shortly explain Guevara's six
 months' absence and constitute
 a party central committee. When
 the 100 members were announced
 three days later, Guevara and
 four of his proteges--two of
 whom are still government minis-
 ters  and another a vice minis-
 ter--had   been excluded.  No
 other minister or high official
 was so slighted.   Moreover, the
 new party's five-man economic
 committee is headed by Carlos
 Rafael Rodriguez--a long-time
 opponent of Guevara's economic
 policies.
 In addition to following
 precepts in internal matters
 which reflected Chinese more
 than Soviet inspiration, Guevara
 apparently continued to press
 for Castro's acceptance of the
 more militant Chinese policies
 in international affairs.   Here,
 too, Castro's policies have un-
 dergone a significant shift,
 however, and Guevara's views
 have been ignored.   Guevara's
 disappearance last March, im-
 mediately after his return from
 Africa and Peking, suggests that
 the positions he took there were
 a factor in Castro's decision.
 In another speech on 2 Oc-
 tober,  Castro read what he said

 was a letter from Guevara.   Al-
 though it specifically expressed
 support for Cuba's foreign pol-
 icy, it indicated differences
 with the Cuban leader since the
 early days of the revolution.
 In an attempt to convey the im-
 pression that his withdrawal
 was voluntary,  the letter said
 Guevara was abdicating all of

 because "other lands of the
 world" demanded his efforts.
 There is, however, no evidence

 Despite its success in
 quelling the September rebellion
 in the mines, the Bolivian junta
 faces multiplying problems.   Dis-
 satisfaction among the miners
 remains, additional political
 disturbances are threatened, and
 some military officers are urg-
 ing political changes.
 In an attempt to pacify the
 miners,  the junta has offered
 them a small basic wage increase.
 Initial reaction to the proposal
 appears to be favorable at some
 mines
 Trouble of another kind
 may develop in Cochabamba this
 week end in connection with a
 meeting of top-level leaders of
 the center-right Bolivian So-
 cialist Falange  (FSB).
 Growing concern on the part
 of ranking officers with mili-
 tary involvement in politics
 also presents a potentially
 serious problem for the junta.
 A group of senior officers re-
 cently presented a memorandum
 asking the junta to:   (1) an-
 nounce immediately the date for
 elections; or (2) set up a mixed
 cabinet including civilians; or
 (3) turn the government over to
 the supreme court.   Barrientos
 apparently dissuaded this group
 from pressing the issue, but he
 admitted to US Ambassador Hen-
 derson that the memorandum is an
 accurate reflection of a sentiment
 which is spreading from officers
 to the lower ranks.
