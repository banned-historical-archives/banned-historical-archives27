 TOP SECRET
 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 USSR,  Pravda prints article by British Foreign Secretarys  As a result
 of a challenge last month by Herbert Morrison, Pravda printed in full
 and without alteration an article by the Foreign Secretary which high-
 lighted the internal freedoms of domestic British life and briefly ex-
 plained the UK's policy and aims in international relations.  The article
 was accompanied by a Soviet rebuttal that contradicted Morrison point by
 point.  By agreement the rebuttal was published in full in Britain, ap-
 pearing in more than twenty morning newspapers,  (U NY Times, 1 Aug 51).
 Comments  Pravda's unprecedented action may well be part of Mos-
 cow's new propaganda line and tactics apparently designed to soften
 Western anti-Soviet unity,  At the same time, however, the publication
 of propaganda material criticizing the West has not diminished in amount
 or intensity.   There has still been no mention in Soviet media of Pres-
 ident Truman's message of friendship from the American to the Russian
 people sent about a month ago,
 Two Soviet cruisers depart from Baltic areas  The Soviet cruisers
 Chapayev and Zheleznyakov were last reported in the Skagerrak early on
 17 July after leaving the Baltic Sea,  Although no further contact has
 been established, the ships are believed enroute to the Northern area
 or possibly the Par East via the Northern Sea route,  (S Navy DID 143,
 20 Jul 51).
 Party units ignore link with massess  At the recent plenary session
 of the Central Committee of the Byelorussian Communist Party, the Minsk
 Provincial Party Committee was "Justly" criticized for its lack of in,
 itiative and its inability to organize farmers and machine tractor sta-
 tion workers for the purpose of raising the province's agricultural out-
 put.  Party units were once again warned to develop the ecreative init-
 iative" of the masses and to make the widest possible use of every labor-
 saving device.  The meeting was reminded that a party worker whose link
 with the masses is "feeble" cannot successfully discharge the tasks en,
 trusted to him, As an example of this, the speaker cited the case of
 the Magnitogorsk Town Party Committee, which weakened its link with the
 primary party organizations by frequently ignoring the valuable initia-
 tive derived from below.  While the party organization at the Magnito-
 gorsk Metallurgical Works was reported to have achieved excellent re-
 sults in implementing the State Plan, the Town.Party Committee was cri-
 ticized for insufficiently studying and applying the 8?considerable" ex-
 perience amassed by this organization.  (R FBIS0 31 Jul 51),

 Approved For Rele 2001/09/06 : CIA-RDP79T01146A00`"00310001-5
 Comments  This is another example of the constant struggle of the
 Soviet Communist Party to increase agricultural production by attempting
 to overcome the apparently permanent sluggishness of the disinterested
 agricultural worker.
 EASTERN EUROPE,  PINLAI+1D,  Formation of new cabinet postponed until
 Septembers  The Finnish Government has confirmed reports that the forma-
 tion of a new Cabinet will not take place until after the Diet reconvenes
 in September.  All parties except the Communists supported the decision
 to delay the Cabinet reshuffle, which has become necessary because of
 changes in party strength in the Diet resulting from the national elec-
 tions of 2 and 5 July,  (R Helsinki 61, 29 Jul 51)a
 Comments The Diet recessed on 31 July?  Postponement of the forma-
 tion of the new Cabinet was probably due in large part to the incumbent
 governmentce desire to complete its study of new inflation control mea-
 sures.  This delay will also permit more time for interparty discus-
 sions concerning the composition of the new Cabinet and the best means
 for continuing to keep the Communists out of the Cabinet.
 POLAND,  Indictment of former Aim~* officers le s emphasis on national
 deviations  The indictment of nine former senior Polish Army officers
 on trial in Warsaw emphasizes their alleged efforts to create a "Titoist
 Fascist regime" in Poland and to a lesser extent their criminal,:
 subversive and espionage activities for the US and UK.  The indictment
 accuses former Polish Communist Party Secretary Gomulka and ex-Minister
 of National Defense General Spychalski of protecting these officers.  It
 also associates the defendants with other Polish national elements, inm
 eluding former Socialists, the Mikolajczyk Peasant Party and the wartime
 partisans who have been brought to trial in recent years.
 The US Embassy in Moscow reports that the Soviet press has given
 the indictment a buildup comparable to that accorded the Rajk trial in
 Hungary in 1949.  The embassy points out that the trial may be intended
 to underline Molotov Qs recent warning against national deviation.  (R
 Warsaw 510, 50 Jul 519 C Moscow 176, 31 Jul 51).
 Comments  Although the majority of the defendants were arrested or
 disappeared during 1949 and 1950 when the Polish Army underwent extensive
 purging of politically suspect officers, this is the first public trial
 of Polish Army officers.  It is the first time since the fall of 1949,
 when Poland0s leading deviationists Gomulka and Spychalski were publicly
 denounced for Titoism and demoted, that national deviation has been at-
 tacked with such vehemence.  The extent of play given the problem of

 national deviation suggests again, as did. Molotov's recent speech, the
 strong Soviet preoccupation with this weakness on its strategic European
 periphery.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 NEAR FAST,  Concern expressed over increase in Communist activity:  The
 secretary General of the Arab League is "alarmed" over the vigor and vio-
 lence of Communist propaganda,, especially in Egypt, within the last month.
 He noted that all the propaganda was directed against the US and wondered
 if Washington were aware that the Communists "are shooting the works" in
 the Near East.
 The Yugoslav Minister in Cairo also expressed concern to the US
 Ambassador about the trend of Communist propaganda within the past month.
 He belies that "a lot of money is changing hands."  (S Cairo 135, 31
 July 51; C Cairo 136, 31 July 51),
 Comment:  Isolated fragments of information indicate that Communist
 effor s a.n t e Near East are being stepped up.- (a)                            25X1 C
 that a Communist demonstration, involving 50 people, an   e  eve  to be
 preliminary to a larger one scheduled for 3 August, as held in Baghdad
 on 30 July; (b) plans are being made for a Middle East Peace Congress to
 meet at an undetermined time and place; (c) a sizeable delegation of stu-
 dents from Syria. Lebanon, and Iraq are on their way to the World Youth
 Festival in Berlin; (d) it is suspected that the Communist press in Egypt
 is subsidized by the Soviet Legation,  In addition, events in the Near
 East, such as the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis and the assassination of Ab-
 dullah, offer the Communists ideal focal points for propaganda.
 GREECE.  Shifts occur in Greek Cabinet: Following the dissolution of
 Part ament on f  July and the scheduling of national elections for 9
 September, the King appointed four non-partisan ministers to the key
 electoral posts of Justice, Interior., National Defense and Governor
 General of Northern Greece.  There has been some shifting of-less im-
 portant ministries, among Prime Minister Venezelose Liberals, but eco-
 nomic posts remain in the same hands.  (U Athens 552, 31 July 51),
 Comment;  It is believed that the appointment of non-partisan men
 to key -e ec oral posts will provide sufficient assurance of impartiality.
 Perpetuation of Venezelost government should do a great deal toward pro-
 viding much needed continuity in economic policy,
 JO    N.  US Minister optimistic about future of Jordan:  The new Jordan-
 ia Same Minister has impressed the US Minister in    an, with his serene
 and statesman-like attitude toward his country's future problems.  The
 US representative feels that if hostile or ambitious neighbors can be
 deterred from interfering, Jordan will remain a friend of the West and an

 Approved For Rel   a 2001/09/06 : CIA-RDP79T01146AOC   0310001-5
 element of political and military stability in the Near East,  The Prime
 Minister has told him that he fears that the Mufti's men., in conjunction
 with the Communists, might capitalize on economic distress induced by the
 current drought to create disorders which his Arab neighbors would util-
 ize to intervene in Jordan.  The Prime Minister stated that he would not
 perpetuate . ,bdullah's plan for a Greater Syria and dismissed the idea of
 a union with Iraq,  He promised that his government would enforce strict
 observance of the armistice agreement with Israel but would not continue
 Abdullah's policy of seeking bilateral settlement with Israel.
 The US Minister suggests that UK US high level policy talks might
 be held to ascertain British views on continued financing of the Arab
 Legion,, the possibility of a majo:? expenditure for military base expan-
 sion., and the extension of bilateral economic aid.  (C Amman 51, 31 July
 .51).
 Comment:  Tawfiq .Abut Huda has been prime minister twice previously
 and isy respected as an astute politician.  He is known to be a
 close friend of the British Minister., whose guidance will be sought and
 generally followed on major problems.  His government is expected to be
 short-lived, as previously scheduled general elections will be held on
 29 August.  With the convening of Parliament' which will contain a large
 number of Palestinian Arabs, a more volatile political situation will
 exist.  Abdullah had trouble with the Arab Palestinians and there is no
 available replacement for his firm hand.  The situation will be touchy;
 but if the present calm can be maintained until after the elections., the
 anticipated internal confusion may not materialize.
 INDONESIA  Government remains firm in denying entry to Chinese Embassy
 spa e a   as  from   e  epang radio charging a violation
 Ma        I
 personxze_
 of international law (see OCI Daily Digest, 31 July Sl),, the Indonesian
 Government continues to stand firm in denying entry to 16 additional
 staff members of the Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta,  The Secre-
 tary General of the Foreign Office delivered a strong statement to the
 press charging that this is the third occasion the Chinese Embassy has
 acted without prior authority and has violated diplomatic courtesy.  Two
 leading Djakarta newspapers editorially backed the government's stand.,
 reviewing the unsatisfactory aspects of Indonesian-Chinese diplomatic re-
 lations.   (C Djakarta 148, 28 July 51).
 Comment:  The Indonesian Government's stand on the matter continues
 to be based more upon what it considers a diplomatic insult than upon its
 concern over Chinese Communist activities.  However., the episode has
 highlighted Communist China's diplomatic procedures and may result in a
 sterner attitude on the Tart of Indonesia toward the Chinese Embassy's
 activities,

 INDONESIA. Criticism of cabinet continues: Grave criticism of the current
 coalition cabinet was voiced by leaders of two of the government's support-
 ing parties during the past week.  Tadjuddin Noor, parliamentary leader
 of the Greater Indonesian Party, stated that his party would withdraw its
 representatives from the cabinet unless there is noticeable improvement
 by the end of August.  Engel, leader of the Democratic Faction, declared
 that the cabinet should be replaced by experts under the leadership of a
 "strong man"--p'eferably Vice President Hatta.
 A cabinet spokesman subsequently told the press that in order to
 strengthen the government, all important decisions will henceforth be
 referred to "consultation party councils" before they are implemented?
 Pedoman, the independent Socialist daily, commented that this procedure
 may help if prime consideration is given to the government's basic ills,
 but that if attention continues to be focused chiefly upon the various
 parties' relative positions in the cabinet, there is little hope for im-
 provement.                 (C Djakarta 148, 28 July 51).
 Comment.- The current cabinet is largely composed of men lacking in
 ability and experience.  Although the government has a solid majority in
 parliament which would permit it to take decisive action, it has taken no
 effective steps toward the achievement of law and order, increased pro
 duction, or the control of Communist activity.  Should the cabinet fall,
 a "strong man" government, although technically unconstitutional, might
 be arranged.
 MALAYA. Lack of success in suressing, Malaya's rebels reported; During
 a recent tour of northern Malaya, the US Consul in Penang was told by
 prominent British administrative and security officials that no end to the
 emergency is in sight so long as the Communist-led terrorists retain hope
 of eventual aid from outside Malaya.  The officials are hopeful, however,
 that efforts to cut off the rebels' food supply and an increase in the home
 guard will decrease their numbers.  It, is not expected that the now neutral
 mass of Malayan Chinese will turn against the terrorists until it is quite
 clear that the West is winning the world power struggle.  (C Penang unnumbered
 31 July 51).
 Comments Lack of success by the British in their campaign to destroy -
 the 4,000 to to 5,000 insurgents has been interpreted by US officials in Malaya
 as the reason for the intended resignation of Lt. General Sir Harold Briggs,
 Director of Operations.  The General, who devised the "Briggs Plan" to ex-
 terminate the rebels, was put in charge of its execution.  If the plan had
 been proceeding successfully, he might have been expected to continue in
 command.

 BURMA. Increased smuggling to China reported:  The US Embassy in Rangoon
 has been reliably informed that the smuggling of tires, auto parts, gaso-
 line and oil from Burma to China is increasing.  The Burmese Foreign
 Office, when approached on the matter, assured the embassy that additional
 measures for the restriction of smuggling and the enforcement of the
 Burmese Government's policy of non-reexport of scarce commodities were
 being considered,  (S Rangoon 127, 31 July 51),
 Comment: This information provides further evidence of Chinese
 interest in exploiting Burmese sources of supply.  The general disorder
 that prevails in Burma, as well as widespread corruption among officials
 and indifference to the smuggling problem, will prevent the establishment
 of an effective control system in the near future.
 Retention of Ne Win as C-in-C predicted:   The US Military Attache
 in Rangoon believes that neither Defense Minister U Win nor the Socialist
 Party can force C-in-C Ne Win to relinquish his post.  The MA thinks that
 Ne Win, upon his return from vacation, will be more amenable to govern-
 mental policies than heretofore.  (S MA Rangoon 80, 27 July 51).
 Comment: Although it seems unlikely that Ne Win would fight to retain
 his job, the Socialists are at a loss to name a generally acceptable re-
 placement and probably will allow him to continue in office.
 Burmese reconsidering Japanese treaty: The Burmese Foreign Minister
 told US Ambassador Key that his government is reconsidering its rejection
 of the Japanese Peace Treaty, and that a final decision will be reached
 in the next two or three days,  (S Rangoon 132, 31 July 51).
 Burmese labor organization joins WFTU:  The World Federation of
 Trade Unions has accepted the application for membership, effective
 1 July, of the Burma Trade Union Congress, the labor instrument of the
 pro-Communist Burma Workers and Peasants Party.  (S Rangoon 115, 27 July 51).

 Comment: This report is unconfirmed but is supported by the May Day
 1951 statement of P'eng Chen, Secretary of the Peiping Committee of the
 CCP, which promised a "systematic and complete reorganization of the
 Party."  Liu Shao-ch'i would be the logical man to announce and supervise
 such an effort.  The CCP has expanded almost 600 per cent in six years;
 its 5.8 million members are of uneven quality, and a continuing purge is
 to be expected.
 Continued "rein of terror" reported in Shanghai: A British national
 who left Shanghai,on 26 July reports that the city's "reign of terror has
 not abated," and that
 (a)  An estimated 200 to 300 people were being executed daily up to
 the date of source's departure;
 (b)        Both Chinese and foreigners are "thoroughly intimidated,"
 fearing arrest at the "slightest misstep";
 (c)  Nearly all British residents now wish to leave the city; and
 (d)  Nothing has been heard from three Americans imprisoned in
 Shanghai, while a fourth, Dilmus Kanady, is seriously ill and
 will be reincarcerated if he recovers.  (C Shanghai 415,
 31 July 51).
 Comment: With the possible exception of the execution figures, this
 report is probably true.
 Polish vessel to carry Ceylonese rubber to Communist China.  The
 Polish merchant ship Kilinski is expected to call at Colombo in mid-August
 to load up to 3,000 tons of rubber for Communist China.  Credit facilities
 to finance the major part of this shipment have already been arranged.
 The Ceylonese prime minister indicates that nothing can be done to prevent
 the rubber shipments.  (C Colombo 58, 30 July 51 ).
 Comment: There had been reports that the Communists would have dif-
 ficulty arranging for shipping space because of the inability of Polish
 vessels to get needed bunker fuel.  Apparently, however, the Poles have
 arranged for the necessary bunkers.  The statements of Ceylonese officials
 suggest unconcern about rubber shipments to Communist China, despite
 earlier expressions of a desire to cooperate with the US in this matter.

 The USSR end Stalin omitted from Chinese Army Day slo;ansa  The 18
 slogans approved by Peiping for public use on Chinese Communist Army Day
 (1 August) make no mention of either the USSR or Comrade Stalin.   In
 contrast, the 35 slogans for Army Day in 1950 included one exhorting
 "support" for the USSR and one wishing long life to Stalin.  (R FBID,
 29 July 1950-51).
 Comment: The omissions from the slogans, plus Chinese Communist
 studies published on the CCPQs 30th anniversary (1 July), have been
 cited as evidence of "serious trouble" between Moscow and Peiping.
 Neither the slogans nor the documents support such a conclusion.  On the
 contrary, the document--analyzed at length in the OCI Bi-Weekly Survey
 of International Communism, 10 July 51--strongly indicate that the earlier
 divergence (1920-35) between Mao Tse-tung and the Kremlin has been re-
 paired over the past 15 years.  There have been inconclusive indications,
 in the past two weeks, that Moscow and Peiping, contemplating the adoption
 of a superficially conciliatory line toward the West, may be encouraging
 speculation that all is not well with the Sino-Soviet alliance.

 view of a'Chinese Communist official that the Korean cease-fire proposal
 resulted from Peiping?s realization of Communist inability to win the war

 itself to an "endless drain" in Korea., while Moscow was unwilling to provide
 Comments It is not known whether this report is based on information
 or speculation.  The pilots of jet planes encountering UN aircraft in Korea
 have not been positively identified but have been reported to be Soviet.
 However, Communist air operations in Korea to date have been primarily
 defensive, not of a nature or scope appropriate to an effort to expel UN
 forces from Korea.  It is possible, and has been reported by many sources,
 that Soviet unwillingness to provide either the materiel or the personnel
 for an offensive operation was a major factor in motivating the cease-fire
 proposal.
 the requisite Soviet pilots.
 KOREA. Communists hint at local offensives during negotiations: The Communist
 delegation at the Kaesong Conference meeting of 28 July stated that due re-
 gard must be given to military realities which the present battle-front
 situation does not reflect.  The Communists added that battle lines are
 constantly changing and could change even during the present negotiations.
 (S Outgoing State Circular 92, 31 July 51).

 Comment: A 31 July PANA report from Kaesong claims that Communist
 newsmen hinted obliquely that their side might have to use force to break
 the stalemate, in view of the adamant UN stand.  General Peng Teh-huai
 allegedly advised the UN in a 1 August broadcast to accept the Communist
 'terms or be exposed to "a fatal danger."
 It has been obvious for some time that the Communists have the
 capability of launching at least local offensives.  It must be recalled,
 however, that Communist propaganda was very threatening immediately prior
 to the Communist agreement to drop from the Kaesong agenda the issue of
 foreign troop withdrawal.
 JAPAN. Government plans to decontrol staa le foods: The Japanese Govern-
 ment has received "fundamental agreement" from SCAP to decontrol staple
 foods (rice, wheat, barley), effective in April 1952, according to the
 Japanese news agency "Kyodo.n  (R FBID, 31 July 51).
 Comment: Abolition of the decade-long control over price, collection,
 and rationing of cereals has been a major objective of the Liberal Party,
 which is wedded to a concept of "free economy."  Agitation toward this end
 commenced during early 1950, when world food supplies appeared ample to
 assure Japan of its needs.  However, under present conditions--sharply
 rising world food prices, tightening of world grain supplies, and the
 shipping shortage, combined with inflationary conditions in Japan--the wis-
 dom of food decontrol is highly questionable.  The dangers inherent in an
 inequitable distribution of inadequate rice supplies have been amply
 demonstrated in Japan's history and would be intensified with the present,
 less-regimented population.
 Plan for nonpartisan peace delegation fails: The Japanese Government's
 plan to send anon-partisan Japanese delegation to the peace conference has
 failed, according to the Jiji news agency.  Prime Minister Yoshida announced
 that the delegation will be composed of state ministers and others whose
 appointment does not require Diet approval; therefore, an extraordinary
 session of the Diet will not be called.  (R FBID Ticker, 1 Aug 51).
 Comment: The Socialists had already refused to participate on grounds
 of policy; the Peoplees Democratic Party, although previously supporting
 the government on foreign policies, reportedly refused to'participate unless
 the draft treaty could be debated at a Diet session prior to the conference-
 something which Yoshida feared would have unfortunate consequences abroad.
 Failure of the opposition partics to participate will force the Liberal
 Party to accept the full brunt of expected political attacks based on the
 treaty, and may create scepticism among some of the signatory nations.

 Dollar clause abolished in sterling area trade agreement: A new
 sterling area-Japan trade agreement,.now being drafted as the result of a
 recent conference between representatives of Japan and the UK, reportedly
 abolishes the clause which provided for settlement of adverse trade balances
 in dollars,.  (R FBID, 31 July 51).
 Comment:  Removal of the threat of a dollar drain very likely will in-
 crease Japans trade with the sterling area.  Japan has been reluctant to
 place too great emphasis on sterling trade, however, fearing the accumulation
 of sterling balances which could not be used in making dollar purchases.
 Japan also recognizes that the sterling area is unable to supply Japan's
 needs for foodstuffs, coking coal, cotton, and iron ore, and is therefore
 hesitant in diverting exports from the dollar to the sterling area.

 WESTERN EUROPE,  Widespread opposition in NATO to US position on possible
 September Council meetings      Further discussion in the NATO Deputiest. mee ings
 o  the proposal to hol     a Council meeting at Ottawa on 15 September. has led
 to sharp disagreement between the US and most of the other NATO members.
 Many members believe the presence of the Defense Ministers is essential for
 a decision on Greek and Turkish membership in NATO.  The UK,. with Dutch,
 Norwegian and Danish support, insists that a decision on the Middle East
 command structure be reached concurrently.  The French are in general agree-
 ment with the US in opposing these views and desiring definitive action on
 basic questions such as the proposed European Defense Forces and agreements
 on Germany,  The French join the Norwegians and the Dutch, however, in
 preferring to abandon the proposal for a September meeting.  The majority
 of the members oppose any serious consideration of the German question or
 of additional steps for financing the defense effort, and favor giving
 primary attention to the non-military aspects of NATO problems aside from
 the admission of Greece and Turkey.  (S London 138-139, 31 July 51)
 GERMANY.  Embassy Moscow believes USSR is showing restraint in Berlin:  US
 Embassy Moscow, commenting on the Berlin trade impasse, considers that the
 USSR is anxious to avoid showing itself in an openly provocative attitude
 at a time when "the peaceful coexistence repertoire is playing in other
 theaters of operation".  The Embassy bases this judgment on the cautious
 Soviet approach to the Berlin issue, the sporadic willingness to negotiate
 with the Allies, and the lack of Soviet propaganda emphasis on the situation.
 The Embassy feels, however, that the Kremlin hopes to profit from even soft-
 pedalled tactics in Berlin, as long as the West refrains from taking stringent
 action.  Embassy officials endorse the plan for a limited Allied. airlift,
 including military planes, as a practical means of easing the present West
 Berlin expert backlog and demonstrating to the Politburo the mass and
 flexibility of Allied air-power,
 The State Department meanwhile recommends a considerable extension of
 the present partial embargo of West German shipments to East Germany.
 Although conceding that French objections might preclude the complete
 termination by the Allies of interzonal trade, the Department urges that
 at least shipments of all essential and strategic goods to East Germany
 should be halted, in an attempt to damage the East German economy and force

 Victims of Nazi Persecution (VVN) under Article 9 of the Basic Law which
 prohibits associations directed against the constitutional order.  The
 ban stems chiefly from the VVN's continued support of the communist anti-
 remilitarization plebiscite in defiance of the government's 26 April .
 prohibition of the plebiscite.  The local organizations of the VVN are
 not affected by the ban of the central council, but the federal govern-
 ment has requested the state governments to take appropriate prohibitive
 action if the local VVN groups continue to follow the policy of the
 central councils  (R Bonn 75, 31 July 51)
 Comment:  The VVN was formed in early 19)7 on a non-party basis, but
 as it  e     more and more Communist penetrated and controlled, it was
 discredited and lost much of its influence in West Germany.  The government's
 ban of the VVN follows similar action against the Communist youth organization
 on 26 June.
 New maps are being made with Soviet symbols:  HICOG Frankfurt has
 learned tha  he East German Government has been conducting a field check
 of the basic German maps of the zone., and is providing them with the Russian
 conventional signs and symbols.  To execute this program, a central surveying
 office (VVB Vermessung) was established in January 1951.  (C Frankfurt Desp,

 Comment:  Probably the Soviet occupation. authorities have ordered the
 making of t ese maps.  In other Satellites, the USSR itself has completely
 usurped the mapping functions,
 FRANCE.  Fears of - German militarism rekindled.-  All elements of the Paris
 press have reac e  violen 1y to former German General Ramckews speech
 calling for a free German hand in military matters and the release of war
 criminals.  Most commentators consider Ramckets proposal to rearm Germany
 only upon satisfaction of these demands a threat of a renewed, unregenerate
 Hitlerism.  They are particularly disturbed because the Bonn government
 permits such rabble-rousing and has failed to take a stand on the war-
 criminal question.  There is unanimity of opinion that both the reinte-
 gration of Germany into Europe and the Schuman Plan are endangered unless
 German good-will is forcefully demonstrated.  (U Paris 681, 31 July 51)
 Comment:  Ramcke was recently released from a French war prison.  His
 remarks upon. his return to Germany have been a source of embarrassment to
 the government, as in the earlier case of a former German general returned
 from Belgium.
 Incidents of this kind are apt to have an ill effect upon the French
 attitude toward German rearmament.  The French originally accepted the idea

 of a German defense contribution reluctantly, but have recently had their
 suspicions lulled by the sincere approach of the German delegation to the
 European Army Conference.  The French are determined to forestall the re-
 creation of the German General Staff, which would inevitably follow the
 development of an independent German national army such as Ramcke favors,
 and any hint that responsible Germans have such a goal will reverse the
 progress so far made toward Franco-German cooperation,
 FRENCH MOROCCO,  Juin again reported to be planning deposition of Sultan:
 Accorcing to a nationalist source, Resident Genera  Juin again is -7 empting
 to obtain official support for the deposition of the Sultana  This step
 supposedly will be taken clandestinely and immediately in order to eliminate
 the possibility of foreign opposition, particularly from the US.  Juin is
 said to be convinced that the outcry from the Moslem states would be inef-
 fectual and belated.
 US Consul McBride thinks that Juin would consider the Sultan's removal
 a great-personal victory.  Because of the Sultan's outspoken pro US stand,
 however, his deposition would be considered a defeat for US prestige through-
 out the Moslem world,  (S Rabat 5, 31 July 51)
 Comment:  The bitter relations between Juin and--the Sultan have not
 been a 1eviated since the crisis of February 1951.  Although a rightist-
 oriented French Government conceivably could approve Juin's scheme, such
 a government is more likely to relieve Juin so that he can devote his full
 energies to his SHAPE command, and to assign to Morocco another strong
 military commander in an attempt to make peace with the Sultan.
 There is an increasing realization among French officials in Paris
 that the dangers inherent in antagonizing the Moslem world outweigh the
 dubious advantages of ousting the Sultan.  While Juin has ample force to
 suppress any disorders that might follow his removal of the Sultan, such
 -'disorders would provide the Communists with an opportunity to exploit the
 situation.

 in reaction to US High Commissioner Donnelly's accusations of Soviet stalling

 issue "hypocritical", "calumniation of the Soviet Union", and "babble
 designed to deceive public opinion".  The article used many arguments to
 show that the US is converting Austria into a "military bridgehead and source
 of raw materials", and concluded that the facts clearly demonstrated "who
 is the real culprit" in denying Austria a treaty,  (U; Vienna 374, 30 July 51)

 NORWAY.  Shortage of military personnel may delay MDAP deliveries&  The
 US  n assador an  the Chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group
 (MAAG), Norway, have recommended postponing delivery of the major portions
 of MDAP material until the Norwegian Defense Ministry has made plans to
 procure sufficient regular personnel to maintain and utilize US equipment
 adequately.  In the interests of good relations with Norway, however, the
 Ambassador feels that the MDAP Committee of the Norwegian Cabinet should
 be informed before such action is taken.  Also, he believes that if the
 Cabinet is apprised of the full significance of the recommendation and is
 shown the need for substantial increases in regular personnel (which has
 repeatedly been pointed out to the Defense Minister), the government may
 take the necessary corrective measures.  (S London DEPTO 132, 30 July 51)
 Comment:  The factor of adequate regular personnel,is the heart of
 the problem of building up and improving the Norwegian military forces.
 The historic Norwegian military concept of a mobiliz able force with only
 a small percentage of regulars causes 'both Norwegian military and civilian
 officials to react sensitively to proposals that the regular military
 establishment be geared to standards determined by other NATO countries.
 Procurement of personnel, moreover, is made difficult by an extremely low
 pay scale for regular officers and NCOs and by a very tight labor market
 in Norway.  The Defense Minister has taken a somewhat negative at toward MAAG and NATO efforts to have Norway begin expansion of its regular
 force; no change is likely unless officials outside the Defense Ministry
 are made aware of MAAG appraisals that Norway currently is incapable of
 utilizing MDAP equipment and has no adequate plan for fulfilling its
 Medium Term Defense Plan contribution.  (see OCI Daily Digest, 17 July 51)
 UNITED KINGDOM.  Britain sharply protests Nehru's charges against British

 to withdraw his recent insinuation that retired British Generals Auchinleck
 and Gracey have been advising Pakistan in the preparation of military plans
 and operations directed against India.  The UK protest in New Delhi followed
 an investigation by British officials who reportedly obtained a satisfactory
 account of the recent activities of both officers.  In indirect response
 to Nehruts rejection, Prime Minister Attlee subsequently stated in Parlia-
 ment that he greatly regretted Nehru's lending the weight of his authority
 to such unfounded allegations.  (S New Delhi 1417, 30 July 51; U IBIS

 in order to avoid arousing antagonisms which might place added strain on
 the Commonwealth ties of the two countries, and which might doom any hope
 of eventually developing their defensive capabilities in line with Britain's
 over-all strategy in South Asia.  The present incident, occurring at a time
 of serious tension between the two Asian countries, justified official
 action on the highest level?  No evidence has been received that Auchinleck
 and Gracey have recently been consulted by the Pakistani high command,
 although both were employed by Pakistan before retirement, and both have
 recently been accessible to the Pakistanis for advice.
 ECUADOR.  Revolutionary plots against the Ecuadoran government::  Carlos

 Comment:  Political conditions in Ecuador remain unstable, and reports
 that a rev. ution has been scheduled have been received on the average of
 one a month for the past seven months.  The two currently most important
 revolutionary groups are led by Carlos Guevara Moreno and Minister of
 Defense Manuel Diaz-Granados, either of whom would set up a dictatorship
 should he come to power.  Two recent events suggest that chances for the
 initiation of a coup by either group are slightly better now than they have
 been for some times  On 24 July Guevara Moreno (who had been in prison for
 over a year for leading a revolution in July 1950) was released on bail..
 He is therefore again able to assume personal leadership of his revolutionary
 group, which has remained organized and active during his confinement,
 On 16 July Minister of Defense Diaz-Granados presented his resignation "for
 reasons of ill health".  Upon President Plaza's request, he agreed to with-
 draw the resignation, but took a 30-day "sick" leave in Guayaquil.  It is
 probable that in this period Diaz-Granados is attempting to increase his
 following in Guayaquil, the region in which Guevara's strength is concen-
 trated (see OCI Daily Digests, 18 and 31 July 51).

 relies on militant agrarian and labor elements for support.  In the present

 well-organized local supporters and some army backing, he represents a
 significant political influence.  It is quite possible that Lombardo would
 favor Henriquez above other candidates,,, though it seems doubtful that
 Henriquez would benefit at this time from Lombardots support.

 NEPAL.    Chinese Communists desire to open embassy in Nepal:.  The Nepalese
 Ambassador to India has expressed his government's concern over the Chinese
 Communists' desire to open an embassy in Katmandu.  The Nepalese Government
 is faced with two choices:  to display no, interest in the opening of an em-
 bassy and consequently expose itself to a possible Chinese revival of the
 debatable question of Nepalese sovereignty; or to agree to establishment of
 an embassy, thereby obtaining Chinese recognition of Nepalis independent status
 but at the same time enabling the Chinese to,make the embassy a center for
 subversive activities.  (S S/S New Delhi 395, 28 Jul 51)
 Comment:  Regardless of the action taken, Nepal probably will be unable
 to prevent the infiltration of Communist elements from Tibet and India.  Both
 the nature of the terrain and the absence of firm government control outside
 the capital make it difficult to detect and limit the activities of undesir-
 ables, some of whom are already operating in Nepal.
 INDIA.    India re'ects proposed Burmese-Indonesian-mediation:  The Burmese
 t   sador to Pakistan on 26    y revealed to the     m assador his
 US                       -
 mentts plan to propose that the Prime Ministers of Burma and Indonesia jointly
 visit New Delhi and Karachi to offer their good offices toward easing the
 tension between India and Pakistan.  Two days later, however, the Burmese
 envoy stated that although the Pakistanis and Indonesians were favorably
 disposed toward the project, it had been rejected by Nehru.  (S S/S Karachi
 109, 31 Jul 51)
 Comment;  Burma's concern over tension between India and Pakistan was
 evidenced last week by the visit of the Burmese Foreign Minister to New Delhi
 to inquire if his government could help solve the impasse on Kashmir.
 India's rejection of the mediation offer undoubtedly derives partly from
 a fear of losing face through mediation by two nations it looks upon as ttsatel--
 lites.ti  More importantly, however, India's refusal reflects a confidence in
 its ability to maintain independently its present power position vis-a-vis
 Pakistan and the United Nations, as well as a belief that its current actions
 will not lead to open warfare with Pakistan.

 public opinion, which he admits the Wafd has created, the Foreign Minister
 feels he can follow none but the present policy regarding British evacuation
 of the Sudan and the Suez Canal Zone.  Therefore, before the end of the
 parliamentary session he must make a statement that there is no use continu-
 ing the negotiations,  The Foreign Minister also stated that whether or not
 the negotiations were continued, he felt that the opposition should be in-
 cluded in the government.  No other members of the government share this
 opinion.  The British Ambassador feels that when the above remarks were made,
 the Foreign Minister had no knowledge of the King's message that the negotia-
 tions should not be broken off.  (TS S/S Cairo 134, 31 Jul 5l).
 Comment.-  These admissions by the Foreign Minister do not encourage
 optimism over the future of the negotiations.  Regardless of what action may
 be taken before the Egyptian Parliament adjourns in mid-August, some state-
 ment about the treaty will have to be made in`the speech from the throne at
 the opening of the next parliamentary session. Public criticism of the treaty,
 which has been fostered by the government, could force denunciation of the
 treaty.
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 2.    PANAMA.  Promulgation of decree on shipping delayed.  Efforts to broaden the
 decree on, shipping        the. Panama flag so as to prohibit all calls 'in Cow
 munist China or North Korea were reportedly well received by President Arose-
 mena, but have apparently caused delay in its promulgation.  Ambassador
 Wiley reports that opposition to broadening the decree is partly based on the
 argument that the ships affected would change to Honduran or Liberian regis-
 try,, thus depriving Panama of revenue.  (C Panama City 71, 31 Jul 51; C S/S
 State to Panama City 57, 31 Jul 51).
 Cor cent:  On 29 July, a Panama decree penalizing ships under its flag
 which carry strategic.materials to Communist China or North Korean ports was
 approved by the President and Cabinet, and the signature of President Arose-
 mena was expected on 30 July.  If the decree should be broadened to forbid
 all calls at these ports, it would somewhat curtail smuggling of contraband
 goods, would eliminate disputes as to the definition of contraband, and

 would hinder the acquisition of shipping by the Chinese Communists.  While
 ships affected by the more comprehensive decree might well transfer to some
 other Western flag, Honduran registry would be relatively unattractive since
 a Honduran government order in January 1951 prohibited Honduran vessels from
 entering ports of Communist China.
