 VF     ie Doubts Red China Will Enter
 Vietnam Conflict
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. RIC14ARD L. ROUDEBUSH
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 23, 1966
 Mr. ROUDEBUSH.  Mr. Speaker, the
 distinguished commander in chief of the
 Veterans of Foreign Wars, Mr, Andy Borg
 of Superior, Wis., has made many ap-
 pearances since assuming the leadership
 of that organization nearly a year ago.
 He has won a reputation for being candid
 and forthright in discussion of public af-
 fairs. On June 16, 1966, he made a visita-
 tion to the Department of Arkansas, and
 as always his remarks were of great value
 in their printed reference to the situa-
 tion in Vietnam. I, therefore, submit a
 newspaper article covering the text of
 his . remarks, so that all Members may
 be aware of the statements made:
 VFW CHIEF DOUBTS RED CHINA WILL ENTER
 VIETNAM CONFLICT
 The commander in chief of the Veterans
 of Foreign Wars of the United States here
 Friday ruled out the possibility of Red China
 entering the yiet Nam war.
 Andy Borg of Superior, Wis., also called for
 "total victory" in the Southeast Asian con-
 flict, in an interview prior to Friday's open-
 ing session of the 35th annual convention of
 the state department of the VFW at the Velda
 Rose Tower.
 The VFW commander said his belief that
 Red China would not enter the war was based
 on eight reasons, "many of which were given
 to me by Chiang Kai-shek when I discussed
 the matter with him on Formosa."
 He then listed his reasons as follows:
 "One, Red China is in economic difficulty.
 "Two, If Red China entered the war we
 would bomb her atomic installations immedi-
 ately and she is very desirous of preventing
 that so she can perfect the atomic bomb.
 "Three, because of the feud between Red
 China and Russia, she does not have the parts
 to repair her war machine which was fur-
 nished by Russia.
 "Four, if Red China entered the war, we
 would give air support and naval support to
 Chiang Kai-shek and that Is the last thing
 that Red China would want-to have Chiang
 Kai-shek get a footfold on the mainland of
 China.
 "Five, the war in South Viet Nam is a
 peninsular war and we control the sky and
 sea, and Red China would have difficulty in
 getting men and supplies in to South Viet
 Nam, and we would not make the same mis-
 take we made in Korea by not bombing the
 sources of supply.
 "Six, the Vietnamese people do not desire
 to have Red China in Viet Nam any more
 than any other outside power.  There is a
 long-lasting dislike of the Chinese by the
 Vietnamese people.
 "Seven, Red China would not have any-
 thing to gain by entering the war because
 at the present time they are fighting the war
 with North Viet Nam soldiers without the
 loss of face and men and supplies.
 "And eight, there is an internal struggle
 going on within the Communist regime to
 determine who will succeed Mao Tse-tung."
 Borg then lashed out at at Sen. J. WILLIAM
 FULBRIGHT  and asked the Senator to "give
 his reasons for believing that Red China
 might enter this war."
 The VFW commander said, "I don't know
 what Senator FULBRIGHT stands for."
 Borg, a former district attorney, said Sen.
 FULBRIGHT should step. down and let others
 ask him questions.  "I certainly would like
 to ask him questions as a trial lawyer."  Sen.
 FULBRIGHT is chairman of the Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee.
 He said he would like to know just what
 the Senator advocates in the Viet Nam war.
 The. commander-in-chief said he believed
 both Sen. FULBRIGHT and Sen. WAYNE MORSE
 of Oregon, a critic of the Viet Nam war,
 "should go to Viet Nam and see for them-
 selves.-
 Pointing to a quote attributed to the Ar-
 kansas senator as saying the United States
 was "arrogant," Borg said "this country has
 been good to him myself and everyone.  I
 have never called my country arrogant."
 Asked his views on possible peace talks
 with the Red Chinese leaders, the VFW com-
 mander said the U.S. should fight with the
 idea of "total victory" in the war.
 "By using our power,"  he said, we would
 have a much better chance of peace talks
 with them than by this so-called graduated
 escalation.
 "We've announced we will talk.  Now it's
 up to them."
 He was quick to point out, however, as
 Washington had said "there is no substitute
 for victory."
 During his address of the state VFW dele-
 gation, the commander again called for "a
 big and fast step-up in the U.S. war effort,
 in Viet Nam."
 Borg urged+a four-point program in step-
 ping-up the U.S. war effort.
 "Cut-off free world and Communist-bloc
 shipping into North Viet Nam by blockade
 and  if  necessary,  mining  the  Haiphong
 harbor.
 "Bomb fuel supplies and other military
 targets in the Hanoi area.
 "Destroy railroad communications between
 Red China and North Viet Nam.
 "Build-up U.S. troop strength in South
 Viet Nam."
 The commander also said "the VFW fully
 supports the stronger action being taken by
 the Johnson Administration in South Viet
 Nam. The VFW believes that the United
 States has no choice but to win this war.
 "To do so requires patience, perseverance
 and power.  We must prove to the Commu-
 nists and to the free world that we have, as a
 nation, these indispensable ingredients for
 victory."
 An Editorial in Support of the Interna-
 tional Education Act of 1966 by Hen-
 rietta and Nelson Poynter, St. Peters-
 burg (Fla.) Times, June 19, 1966
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN BRADEMAS
 OF INDIANA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 22, 1966
 Mr. BRADEMAS.  Mr. Speaker, I in-
 sert in the RECORD a most thoughtful
 editorial describing the International
 Education Act of 1966, which the House
 of Representatives passed on June 6,
 1966, and which is now awaiting action
 in the Senate.
 This editorial, which appeared in the
 June 19, 1966, issue of the St. Petersburg,
 Fla., Times, was written by two distin-
 guished journalists, Henrietta and Nel-
 son Poynter.
 The editorial follows:,
 NEEDED:  GREATER UNDERSTANDING
 College students next year may take a hard
 look at new, demanding courses that can lead
 to careers overseas working for their govern-
 ment, international organizations or busi-
 ness and banking enterprises.
 Congress has toyed with the idea of a "West
 Point of Diplomacy" and other schemes to
 train officers for the Department of State.
 But the U.S. Senate now has a bill-already
 passed by wide bipartisan support in the
 House-to make better use of existing insti-
 tutions of higher learning to train the thou-
 sands of Americans needed to do the wide
 diversity of chores of a world power which
 has had greatness and responsibility thrust
 upon it.
 "The Ugly American" was an overdrawn
 novel about the thousands of our country-
 men in foreign enclaves who had neither the
 desire nor capacity to understand the people
 of the country to which they were assigned.
 The International Education Act is de-
 signed to help  find and stimulate young
 Americans with the urge to know the world--
 not just to travel it.  Our guess is that such
 a program will solve the dilemma of many an

 educated young woman who may find a re-
 warding spouse and a career too.
 A program of federal aid to stimulate the
 study of agriculture, started more than a
 century ago, has paid off in bounteous crops
 beyond the dreams of those who originated
 it, as well as important research in fibers and
 new products.
 Since the first Russian Sputnik went orbit-
 ing  In  1957,  the federal  government  has
 poured money into most of our colleges and
 universities to stimulate scientific and tech-
 nical specialities.  The International Educa-
 tion Act is recognition of our critical need
 for new skills not, only in the language of
 the tongue but empathy and understanding
 of the aspirations and needs-and ? strength
 and limitations-of the bewildering variety
 of people who make up the rest of our world.
 President Johnson has pushed this specific
 bill by speeches and special messages.  When
 he was a member of the Senate he worked
 toward better educational facilities for those
 especially interested in Asia.  His work has
 been effective.  Only two members of the
 Florida delegation-JAMES HALEY of Sara-
 sota and ROBERT SIKES of Crestview-voted
 against the new act.
 Its two principal sections authorize gradu-
 ate centers for research and training which
 may be set up regionally by several universi-
 ties and grants to colleges and universities
 and grants to colleges and universities for
 comprehensive programs at the undergrad-
 uate level.  The bill also amends the Defense
 Education Act to cut out the limit of "50
 per cent" support for language and area study
 centers and deletes the, provision that such
 centers be limited to teaching languages for
 which adequate instruction was not readily
 available In the United States.
 As JOHN BRADEMAS, Democrat of Indiana.,
 the floor leader of the House bill explained.,
 this does not mean that colleges have to
 teach Czech or Tagalog to qualify.  There
 is great need for languages like French and
 Spanish too.  All of this "will help to bring
 the nation's educational system into line with
 the responsibilities of the United States in
 the world community, and with the new
 realities of an increasingly interdependent
 world."
 The federal funds would supplement exist-
 ing grants from public and private non-profit
 agencies and encourage exchange programs
 for teachers and students-such as the Mexi-
 can  study  group  at  Florida  Prebyterian
 ,College.
 By coordinating the activities of various
 government agencies in the field of inter-
 national studies In a special branch of the
 Department of Health, Education and Wel??
 fare, thebill could utilize the skills of Ameri-
 cans returning from the Peace Corps, Ful-
 bright fellowships and other programs, as well
 as government and industry experts in a
 various areas of the globe.
 The results hoped for from this bill as
 stated in the debate are:
 The exposure of nearly all undergraduates
 to some substantial international studies,
 particularly in relation to non-Western areas.
 . The integration of international studies
 Into the curriculums of our universities as
 central, not peripheral concerns.
 The provision of an effective international
 dimension in as many departments and pro-
 fessional schools of our universities as appro-
 priate and possible.
 The encouragement of inter-institutional.
 arrangements among groups of colleges and
 universities to support effective programs in.
 international study.
 But of prime importance, in the minds of
 the congressmen, is the potential for peace
 in this legislation.  Rep. CARLETON SICKLES,
 Democrat of Maryland, who has worked all
 through the Par East, and whose wife was
 born in Shanghai, summed it up for his col-
 leagues with:
 "Only by really knowing the peoples of
 other lands, their hopes, their problems-not
 as we see them, but as they see them-can
 we really develop the mutual understanding
 upon which permanent and lasting peaceful
 relationships can be based.  There is no
 greater cause than this."
 Florida-Colombia Alliance Program: A
 Progress Report
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 or
 HON. DANTE B. FASCELL
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 22, 1966
 Mr. FASCELL.  Mr. Speaker, I am ex-
 tremely pleased to announce that Flor-
 ida's exciting partnership with Colombia
 under the Alliance for Progress is being
 expanded to include the Republic of
 Venezuela.  Florida Secretary of State
 Tom Adams spoke in Tallahassee on June
 16 and announced that the State-to-
 nation program has been so successful
 in its first 33 months of operation that
 "we are now ready to take another im-
 portant step, in making this an effort. of
 true hemispheric proportions."
 Florida's new partnership with Vene-
 zuela will begin with a student exchange
 program. The first Venezuelan graduate
 students will arrive in Florida in Sep-
 tember.
 Mr. Speaker, problems of hunger,
 disease, and illiteracy continue to plague
 our hemisphere.  But through the ever
 increasing scope of activities such as the
 Partners of the Alliance the war against
 the deepest causes of instability can be
 won.
 PROGRESS  REPORT:  FLORIDA-COLOMBIA
 ALLIANCE PROGRAM
 (By Secretary of State Tom Adams, June
 1966)
 Now that 33 months have elapsed since the
 Florida-Colombia Alliance was initiated, it
 is appropriate that we stand back from our
 work, appraise our efforts thus far and take
 a brief look at where we hope to go in the
 years ahead.
 In a very real sense, the Florida-Colombia
 Alliance constitutes a unique approach to
 international good will and assistance pro-
 grams.   It was one of the first "state-to-
 nation" programs embarked upon in the
 United States.  It combines the talents of
 government, private organizations and in-
 dividuals of both nations.  It is generated
 not by monetary gifts but by an exchange of
 people, ideas, talents and technical know-
 how.  It is built on the premise of helping
 our good hemispheric friends to help them-
 selves and on the recognition that in return,
 we have much to gain from their rich cul-
 ture and new technology as well as from
 commercial exchanges.  For only in such a
 way can be built mutual respect and truly
 friendly relations between the peoples of the
 Americas.
 Because our approach has been new and
 different, the Florida-Colombia Alliance has,
 by design, sought to move slowly and de-
 liberately in the Initiation of our programs.
 For us, it has been a case of learning to
 crawl before we could walk; of gaining ex-
 perience before we could embark on ambi-
 tious ventures.
 As a result, I am pleased to report that we
 have succeded in establishing a sound base.
 The  Florida-Colombia  Alliance  is  now  a
 strong, dynamic and growing concern.   With
 active state-wide committees established in
 both Florida and Colombia, we are ready to
 move forward with increasing effectiveness
 in the areas of education, agriculture, civic
 organizations and sister city affiliations. In
 addition, new committees are soon to be ap-
 pointed to guide our efforts in public health,
 culture, tourism, commerce and public ad-
 ministration.

 scholarships on a matching basis to Florida
 students.
 During the first sixteen months of these
 reciprocal scholarships, a total of 47 Colom-
 bian students were placed in universities and
 junior colleges in Florida.  In January, 1966,
 the first three Florida students began classes
 in Colombian universities.
 Study-Travel Program
 An 8-week study and travel program was
 organized by the Alliance and the Experiment
 in  International Living in  Bogota  for  15
 Florida junior college students beginning in
 July, 1966.   The major colleges of the Colom-
 bian Department of Cundinamarca have de-
 veloped a special six-week course in Spanish,
 Latin American History and Literature, for
 which no enrollment fees are being charged.
 Technical Assistance
 Through the Alliance, Dr. Harvey K. Meyer,
 Director of Research in Teaching at Florida
 Atlantic University, went to Colombia this
 year to advise on the establishment of aca-
 demic programs at the Universidad del Norte,
 a new, private technological institute sched-
 uled to open in Barranquilla in July.  On a
 contract to the university, Dr. Meyer surveyed
 facilities, interviewed professors,  developed
 curriculums  and  recommended        necessary
 textbooks.
 Public health
 Medicines Dispatched
 On July 20, 1965, Colombia's Independence
 Day, the Alliance delivered 500 pounds of
 urgently needed medicines and medical sup-
 plies to the Children's Hospital in Barran-
 quilla to combat an epidemic of dehydration.
 As a result, the hospital director reports that
 the lives of many young children were saved.
 Similar pleas from other hospitals and clinics
 are  also receiving  an  affirmative response
 by Florida-Colombia Alliance Committees.
 Health Survey
 A detailed public health survey was con-
 ducted along the north coast of Colombia
 through the auspices of the Alliance.  The
 consequent report is providing the basis for
 continued development of health programs
 in that area.
 Agriculture
 Soil Kits
 Early in 1965, soil testing kits and mate-
 rials to assist in plant disease recognition
 and control were dispatched to the Secre-
 tary of Agriculture in the Colombian State
 of Atlantico.

 It is a sad thing when our soldiers have

 bought back at a profit to the holders
 and then flown to Vietnam; when a small
 American command has to ask General
 Ky's headquarters  in Saigon before
 making a local attack on an assembly of
 Vietcongs, when military helicopters are
 summarily requisitioned in the battle
 area to carry civilian supplies, and when
 the record shows that 70 percent of sup-
 plies reaching Saigon by ship are not
 military supplies at all.
 Whatever happens in the future, the
 American people are not going to forget
 or forgive the massive mismanagement
 of a war in which their sons, husbands,
 and fathers are fighting and dying.

 HON. AL ULLMAN
 OF OREGON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 23, 1966
 Mr. ULLMAN.  Mr. Speaker, the sta-
 bility of our economic today is being
 threatened  by skyrocketing  interest
 rates. The inflationary pressures of in-
 reased money costs are being reflected
 in the price of many consumer goods.
 At the same time, the homebuilding in-
 dustry is being adversely affected by the
 drain from the mortgage market. I am
 concerned that these and other irreg-
 ularities are not receiving the required
 attention from the administration.  De-
 cisive action is needed to bring interest
 rates within the zone of safety to permit
 a continuation of our economy's record
 expansion.
 In the accompanying article from the
 Washington Post of June 19, Columnist
 Joseph Kraft recalls the efforts of the
 late President Kennedy in expressing the
 distinction between-myth and reality in
 economic affairs.  Today, reality de-
 mands that the accelerating trend to
 higher interest rates be halted and rev-
 ersed before it imposes an unbearable
 burden on our economy.
 NEW ECONOMIC MYTHS
 (By Joseph Kraft)
 At Yale four years ago, President Kennedy
 made his famous distinction between myth
 and reality in economic affairs.  President
 Johnson has at all times shied away from
 that distinction.  And now there are signs-
 faint but unmistakeable-that the myth-
 makers are staging a comeback.
 The focus of the distinction between myth

 The Postmaster General at his news confer-

 arrange to supply ZIP Code information by
 telephone on a regular basis during normal
 business hours.  To be of necessary service,
 to the meetings held for a hundred here and
 a hundred there?  We anticipate chaos of
 immense proportions.
 I am informed, much to my dismay, that
 this situation was fully discussed at a meet-
 ing of the Postmaster General's Technical
 Advisory Committee about a year ago.  Why
 wasn't this problem brought back for dis-
 cussion in association bulletins at that time,
 so that at least the insiders could go to work
 on exploring the problem.  Why was this ap-?
 parently a surprise to The Department at
 recent hearings?  What can be done now In

 Maginnis, Lee Epstein and Manny Cohen of
 Mailmen, Inc., Syosset, spoke at length about
 the potential inequities of that system; that
 it opened the door to 33,000 different opinions

 horrified to see that it was a copy of the first
 directory Issued in 1963, thoroughly out of

 There is little indication that the local
 government omelet   can be unscrambled.
 ,The urban county, interlocal  contracting,
 voluntary councils of elected officials, re-

 control, metropolitan planning, supervision

 home rule powers; these will all help pre-

 of fragmentation.  But this may be the best
 that can be hoped for in the way of intra-

 most objective analyses of the situation

 SOUTHEAST ASIA
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, on
 Tuesday evening, June 21, the distin-
 guished commentator, Mr. Eric Sevareid,
 made a personal report on the CBS
 television network. Mr. Sevareid is well
 The New Yorker, January 8, 1966, p. 93.
 See "The State of the Region," Presi-
 dent's Annual Report Delivered to the Board
 of Trustees of the Metropolitan Fund, Inc.,
 Detroit, Michigan, January 26, 1966, p. 5.

 , 54 munity-Defining Federalism," The  Annals,
 years and men will it take?
 To each question, the official rhetoric of
 Washington gives the optimistic response.
 These officials speak from faith, not fact.
 The total of the known facts does not deny
 their optimism; but it does not confirm it,
 either.
 Through this fog of uncertainties the re-
 porter must pick his wa'y; he must report
 out of instinct, experience and impression.
 He can guess, estimate, and try to project
 what seem to him the probabilities.
 And his first task is to break through the
 crust of his own pre-conceived notions.
 I think I was only dimly aware of what
 the American power in the Pacific world
 really means.  As you fly the great arcs to
 Alaska and .Japan, and down the eastern rim
 of Asia's land mass, you begin to under-
 'June 23,1966
 stand.  The vast Pacific and the skies above
 it belong to American power.  America-its
 men, money and machines-is intermingled
 with the affairs of governments' everywhere,
 the daily lives of hundreds of millions of
 people.
 Consider the world of the Pacific Ocean
 and the southern seas in this American era:
 Alaska-30,000 military men.
 -Hawaii-100,000 military men.
 Guam-20,000 military men.
 Okinawa-25,000 military men.
 Japan-39,000 military men.
 Korea-55,000 military men.
 Taiwan-10,000 military men.
 The Philippines-25,000 military men.
 Vietnam-about 285,000 military men.
 Thailand-20,000 military men.
 Besides,  of  course,  the  Seventh  Fleet
 itself-60 to 70,000 men.
 This is the legacy of the defeat of Japan
 in World War Two; of the take over of China
 by the communists; of the collapse of Euro-
 pean rule; of the Korean war; and now, of
 the fighting in Vietnam.  It is also the legacy
 of habit, of the military man's fear of ever
 giving up any salient, of the idea that Com-
 munist China, is bent upon military aggres-
 sion, as were Hitler's Germany and Stalin's
 Russia.
 There is a strange phenomenon that comes
 into play in the relationship between im-
 pressions and reality.  It has to do with time
 and space.  For distance lends, not only en-
 chantment, but apprehension.  So, to Amer-
 icans at home, the Buddhist riots in Saigon
 means that all Saigon is in turmoil.  But
 the man sitting in a cafe a block from the
 riots is relaxed; he knows it's not.  So, to
 us at home, China appears a frightening
 monster,  straining at the leash, eager to
 smash her neighbors.
 But some of her neighbors are far more
 relaxed than we.  This is true of the gov-
 ernment of Japan, the most powerful non-
 communist society of eastern Asia.  Their
 view of China as an aggressive threat is
 closer to  the view of Senator FULBRIGHT
 than to that of Secretary Rusk.
 They believe that China is already con-
 tained.  She is contained by the existence
 of the nuclear bomb, by the simple knowl-
 edge that if she marches over the border of
 a friendly country that we are able to help,
 we  shall  immediately  help.  She  is  con-
 tained by this gigantic ring of steel built by
 the United States along her eastern and
 southern borders and by Russia's ring of
 steel along four thousand miles of her west-
 ern borders.  If she feels encircled, no big
 power ever had more right to feel that way.
 She fears what the United States may do
 more than some of her neighbors fear what
 she may do.
 China can try the methods of subversion
 in Southeast Asia, she has and she does.
 But it is doubtful how successful she would
 be, even without our presence and resist-
 ance in Vietnam.  Nationalism is basically
 stronger than any ideology.  Most nations
 are not dominoes, that fall over with a click.
 These nations of Southeast Asia, like Thai-
 land or Burma, are more like sponges.
 Their edges can become waterlogged with
 Communist-trained resistance groups,  but
 there are a thousand natural obstacles to
 the water seeping through the whole or-
 ganism.   One  is  the  historic dislike                                                                                                                                         and
 distrust of, the Chinese throughout these
 regions.
 A crucial question is whether our resist-,
 ante in Vietnam is preventing the spread of
 Chinese dominance in other Asian countries.
 through   their   propaganda,   infiltration,
 subversion.
 The administration points to Indonesia
 where the powerful Chinese-inspired Com-
 munist apparatus was smashed not, long ago.
 That would never have happened.. they like
 to think, were we not there, in Vietnam.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  SENATE
 If this Is true," all of us would all feel very
 much better about this war in Vietnam. My
 personal opinion is that that is not true.
 Indeed, it was the conclusion of Japan's
 ambassadors to Southeast Asian countries,
 in recent consultation, that Vietnam had
 nothing to do with those events In Indonesia,
 that internal, domestic pressures alone were
 responsible.
 . Korea in the north, Thailand in the south
 are exceptions to this line of thought.  The
 men who rule Thailand have thrown in their
 lot with the United States and its argument.
 Contrary to Burma on their west, Cambodia
 on their east, they do fear China and Com-
 munism in general,  and they have given
 welcome and facilities to American power.
 The That government tries to keep as
 much of all this as secret as it can; and we
 help them in this out of diplomatic consider-
 ation. For the truth is that we have upwards
 of twenty thousand military men in Thai-
 land, mostly on the great bomber bases from
 which we hit North Vietnam and the Ho Chi
 Minh trail.  Reporters are not permitted to
 see these bases.  Twenty thousand is more
 men than we had in Vietnam itself when Mr.
 Johnson became the President.
 Our military wanted, at one time, to put
 ground combat units into Northeast Thai-
 land where skirmishes go on with Chinese
 trained guerrillas.  Our diplomats stopped
 that; but we have more than a few special
 forces advisory and fighting teams in the
 Northeast.  And there one sees how war
 tends to spread and of why military men
 must be kept in constant check by political
 men.
 Laos, technically neutral by the Geneva
 Agreements, is thoroughly engulfed in the
 'war already.  The North Vietnamese run
 their supplies and fresh soldiers through
 much of Laos and therefore we bomb it con-
 stantly.  We admit to no men on the ground
 in Laos. My Information from people I con-
 sider reliable, is that we have several thou-
 sated soldiers inside Laos, including spotter
 groups and special forces teams.  When an
 American is killed in or over Laos, his death
 is officially registered as having occurred in
 Vietnam.
 Cambodia Is becoming more and more
 deeply involved in the fighting.  We have
 bombed and shelled Cambodian territory,
 more than once, for some time back because
 we have had to.  I believe our front line
 intelligence reports and our eyewitnesses.
 When General` Larsen, Commander of our
 second corps, whose boundaries lie along
 the Cambodian line, said there are heavy
 North Vietnamese troop concentrations in-
 side Cambodia-I am Inclined to believe him
 rather than the Pentagon's immediate denial
 of this.  After all, he is on the scene.
 This, then, is how war spreads-in spite of
 all the official proclamations that we shall
 .not allow it to spread.
 War has a logic, a momentum, impera-
 tives               of        its  own.  And  In  this  process,
 language  is   adulterated, reason  twisted,
 policy follows ink the wake of actions, in-
 stead of the other way around, and the in-
 ner sequence of cause and effect is lost to
 men's comprehension.
 (And so,) the administration argues that
 unless we stop communism, or China, or
 both in Vietnam now, other nations will fail,
 as happened in Europe in the thirties, until
 the grand confrontation of World War Three
 with China will be forced upon the world,
 It seems to me that it is quite as logical
 to"argue that our very presence in Vietnam,
 with this inevitable osmotic spread of hostil-
 ities'across other borders, is just as likely to
 produce war With 'China, unless we are ex-
 tremely careful and extremely lucky.  And
 If that happens, it willbe like World War
 One, if not World War Two; men still argue
 how World War one got started, as actions
 led to reactions and still further reactions,
 engulfing nation by nation.   And if we are
 sucked into collision with China in these
 regions, we will never be sure of the precise
 point in space or time when it happened.
 How the Vietnam war goes will be the test
 of all this; Vietnam is the anvil on which
 our  future relations  with  vast,  emerging
 China are being hammered out, and the
 sparks fly in all directions.
 Until we got into it, the Vietnam war was
 essentially a civil war;  a civil war and a
 social revolution and a struggle for national
 identity and freedom from European rule.
 For legal and diplomatic reasons, Wash-
 ington must argue that it is not a civil war
 at all, but an aggression and invasion by an
 external power.  But when men speaking
 the same language, living within the same
 cultural context, raised in the same cities
 and villages fight one another by the thou-
 sands that is civil war.  When the men of
 the north (including Prime Minister Ky)
 are part of the government of the south, and
 vice versa, it is civil war. Even the Geneva
 Agreements called the two "zones" of the one
 country, not sovereign states,
 North Vietnam has gone to the Chinese
 weapons system;  their material help from
 China and Russia is considerable.  But no
 Chinese officer or soldier has ever been found
 among the enemy's fighting cadres, to my
 knowledge.
 It is the apparent conviction of Washing-
 ton that if North Vietnam will just stop its
 infiltration into the south the war could be
 settled.  Not necessarily, not unless Hanoi
 also ordered a cease fire all down the line.
 One of our leading generals there argues
 strongly that the units from the north need
 the local guerrillas far more than the guer-
 rillas need them.  The guerrillas are home;
 they need ammunition but not trucks or oil
 or great depots of rice.
 How many men are coming down from the
 north?  Last fall, Secretary McNamara said
 it was forty five hundred a month; this April
 we were told in Saigon that it had gone
 higher  and might reach  seven  thousand.
 The other day the Pentagon again said forty
 five hundred.  These figures are educated
 guesses, no more.
 How many in all have come down?  At the
 Saigon headquarters you are told there are,
 at a generous estimate, fifty battalions of
 North Vietnamese now in the south.  Their
 battalions are far smaller than ours-perhaps
 four or five hundred men.  That means
 about twenty five thousand northerns in
 their own combat units.  That in turn, is
 only ten per cent of the estimated total of a
 quarter   million   organized (and   semi-
 organized) enemy fighting men that we and
 the South Vietnamese now face.
 On both sides, it's a much bigger war than
 a year ago, when it was nearly lost and when
 President Johnson ordered the massive in-
 fusions  of  American troops.  Our  intelli-
 gence officers out there now believe that the
 enemy is now better armed, man for man,
 than our South  Vietnamese allies. Far
 worse armed, of course, than we.
 Our fighting men, our weapons and de-
 vices, our tactical ingenuity-all are pro-
 foundly impressive.                                                                             We could not fight this
 war at all were it not our side that enjoys the
 real "privileged sanctuaries"-the sea and
 the sky.  Both are denied to the enemy.
 If our tactics are ingenious, our grand
 strategy remains a mystery, at least to me.
 We are fighting what is essentially a war of
 attrition, the most disagreeable kind of war,
 counting progress by the number of enemy
 bodies.
 The count is accurate when our men can
 actually go among the bodies; when the Air
 Force claims so many Viet Cong killed from
 bombing and strafing runs, those are foolish
 guesses.  The claims of enemy killed by the
 South Vietnamese forces-and the figures on
 their own casualties-may be approximately
 '13483
 right or widly wrong; hone of us can really
 check.
 It might be better if we in the news busi-
 ness reported weekly progress in terms of
 hamlets restored  or re-settled,  classrooms
 built, village chiefs who feel it safe to to back
 and sleep in their own houses.    This, after
 all, is what the war, is about.  And in this
 respect there is progress. It is something to
 see tough American Marines acting as dedi-
 cated; social workers; it Is a fact worth know-
 ing that of the three thousand Marines who
 have voluntarily extended their term of duty
 In Vietnam, most are those men who work
 daily with the ordinary people.  Progress,
 but painfully slow progress, and against it
 must be set the great numbers of refugees
 who come into our secured areas. About a
 million of them now.  And not all, by any
 means, fleeing from Viet Cong terror; many
 fleeing from the terror of our napalm and
 high  explosives  which  have,  inescapably,
 killed and maimed hundreds of innocent
 people.
 We are not really conquering territory.
 Our official statement is that at the end of
 last year eight and half per cent of the
 total land area was considered secure; at the
 end of February nine and half per cent; all
 the rest is in enemy hands or disputed and
 unsafe, or empty.  About eight million peo-
 ple, a bit over half the population, are in
 secure allied controlled areas.
 We are using giant sledgehammers to kill
 hornets.  The Vietcong's National Liberation
 Front in the south has an annual budget es-
 timated at about ten million dollars.  Our
 annual costs in this war run to about fifteen
 billion.  The  enemy  needs  an estimated
 eighty seven tons of supplies each day; the
 American establishment alone needs about
 twenty-thousand tons a day.  In terms of
 last year's total expenditure for the war,
 each enemy soldier killed last year cost us
 well over a million dollars..
 What of our human investment and hu-
 man losses?  Of the total American military
 in-country, say 285,000 (or so) only a dis-
 tinct minority do the real fighting, on the
 ground and in the air.  They alone are the
 heroes.  All the rest, in the enormous sup-
 port and supply echelons, in the cities and
 ports, in the countless offices--they may oc-
 casionally court danger, but their life is
 wholly different, usually comfortable, for a
 great many enjoyable.
 We had, when I left, five combat divisions
 and two brigades in the field, around eighty
 five thousand men,  Add to that the special
 forces teams and the combat fliers.  Of these
 I would guess, generously, that about sixty
 thousand can be defined as men in frequent
 combat.  Now this is an arbitrary definition,
 but necessary-some definitions necessary-
 if we are to think at all about our human
 investment and losses.
 And thinking, from that rough definition,
 one feels obliged to say that our casualties
 are high, not low.  They are low in relation
 to the total number in Vietnam, mostly men
 who never or rarely ever see the enemy.  And
 low compared to enemy losses.   But our
 loses in combat dead and wounded have
 mounted rapidly to the current rate of about
 30 thousand a year.  One year is a man's
 term of service there. On the statistical face
 of it, then, the chances for the individual
 fighting soldier in an active combat zone
 avoiding  death  or  wounds  in his  twelve
 months are not great, about fifty-fifty. What
 lengthens his odds is the increasing rotation
 of more units, not just between home and
 Vietnam, but between the fighting zones and
 the rest zones.  It enemy attacks slacken,
 that, of course, will improve the odds.
 For every man admitted to hospitals, in
 Vietnam for combat injuries, three times as
 many are admitted for non-combat injuries
 and disease.  In terms of combat troops, one
 is forced to the conclusion that we lose the

 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. In other words,
 we Americans, who like to regard our-
 selves as the most revolutionary nation
 in the world, have become, it seems, the
 most unrevolutionary in nature.  The
 generals with whom we are associated
 and are supporting and keeping in pow-
 er in Saigon were the Tories of that day,
 and we are aiding and abetting them at
 this time. That fact is further-evidenced
 that there is a civil war raging in Viet-
 nam, and the National Liberation Front,
 which led the fight for freedom from
 1946 on, is still fighting for the freedom
 of Vietnam as they see it.
 This is further evidence that we are

 In 1954 12,000 of the French forces

 in Parade, which is the Sunday maga-

 many other newspapers of our Nation,
 there was a very important and very in-
 teresting item in the June 19, 1966, issue,
 an item startling in character.  In an
 article the question was asked:
 The 10 generals who govern Vietnam with
 Nguyen Cao Ky at the head-can you tell
 me how many of them fought the French?
 The answer given was:
 Of the 10 generals in the junta, only one
 joined the Viet Minh resistance movement
 against the French in 1945.  He is Lt. Gen.
 Phan Xuan Chieu, popularly recognized in
 Saigon as the only junta member who fought
 to free his country from French colonial
 rule.  The other nine either fought on the
 side of the French or took training in French
 military schools during the Vietnamese war

 The Vietminh who waged guerrilla
 warfare for the liberation of Vietnam
 and what is now Cambodia and Laos
 from 1946 to September 1954 came from
 all areas of Vietnam. Historically, there
 is no North nor South Vietnam.  The
 demarcation line at the 17th parallel
 effected by the Geneva Accords was sup-
 posed to be temporary pending elections
 to be held in 1956 throughout all Viet-
 nam. These were called off by our pup-
 pet head of state in Saigon, Diem, with
 the approval of Secretary of State John
 Foster Dulles.
 In the 8 years of struggle for free-

 oppressors  thousands  of  Vietnamese

 no member of the National Liberation
 Front, whether or not he is suspected of
 being a Communist, and no neutralist,
 will be permitted to vote. It is wishful
 -thinking that such an election would re-
 sult in pacification of South Vietnam.
 France having squandered tremendous
 sums of money in addition to the billions
 of dollars in military aid from the
 United States finally withdrew. We now
 have nearly 380,000 men of our Armed
 Forces in South Vietnam.  In addition,
 40,000 in Thailand, and 50,000 officers
 and men of our 7th Fleet off the Vietnam
 coast. Our servicemen in southeast Asia
 are the "cream of the crop."  They are
 the finest fighting men in the world.
 Their morale is high.  Their firepower
 Is so tremendous many more Vietcong
 have been killed than Americans; and we
 have suffered more than 2,000 who have
 died in combat this year.
 What assurance can there be if by late
 December our forces have been increased
 to 600,000 or 800,000, as seems probable,
 that guerrilla tactics of the Vietcong will
 have been ended and Vietcong resistance
 crushed? Even if the Hanoi government
 is silent as to offers to negotiate and dur-
 ing the coming years the Vietcong do
 bury their weapons, return to their
 farms or go to Saigon, Cam Ranh Bay
 and elsewhere in South Vietnam to work
 for the Americans and even if the shoot-
 ing and the killing should cease, is there
 anyone who can say following the time
 we "bring the boys home" that guerrilla
 warfare will not again break out?
 What is occurring in Vietnam seems
 to be a rerun of the 8-year struggle on
 the part of French generals against the
 Vietnamese  seeking  freedom  from
 French oppression.  Also it is most un-
 fortunate for us that heads of State of
 Japan,  the Philippine Republic and
 other Asian allies and of allies like
 Canada have refused to give us any mili-
 tary aid whatever.
 WHY NOT HELP AND NOT DIS-
 CRIMINATE  AGAINST  THE  ST.
 LAWRENCE SEAWAY?
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 earlier this month I spoke out in this
 Chamber strongly opposing recent at-
 tempts to increase tolls on the St.
 Lawrence Seaway.  At that time I stated
 that\should tolls on the seaway be In-
 creased, I intend to ask that the Senate
 Committee on Public Works review Fed-
 eral expenditures for future improve-
 ments of entrance channels leading from
 the oceans to our ports with the view to-
 ward placing all entrance channels on
 the same self-liquidating basis as the St.
 Lawrence Seaway.
 What is good for the goose is good for
 the gander.  All of this Nation's sea-
 ports, including the Great Lakes ports,
 should be placed on the same economic
 footing with equal rights of access to the
 oceans of the world.  It is high time that
 officials of port authorities in Eastern and
 in Gulf States and executives of rail-
 roads serving 'those cities recognize the
 fact that ports and great cities on the
 Great Lakes such as Cleveland, Toledo,
 Lorain, Duluth, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Chi-
 cago, and others have become interna-
 tional seaports in every sense of the word
 and are no longer to be considered as
 poor country cousins from the Midwest.
 Millions of our Nation's taxpayers'
 dollars have been spent for construction
 of entrance channels for ports such as
 New Orleans, Philadelphia, Houston, and
 other cities and on none of these water-
 ways do shippers pay a penny in toll
 charges.  At the same time, one ship
 traveling from Montreal, Canada, to
 Cleveland, Ohio, loaded with 15,000 tons
 of cargo now pays seaway tolls and tran-
 sit charges amounting to more than
 $14,000.
 Mr. President, at the present time the
 great St. Lawrence Seaway Is a self-
 liquidating project on which 31/2 percent
 interest is being paid on every dollar bor-
 rowed by our Government to construct
 it. Both principal and interest must be
 returned from toll revenue derived from
 all toll shipping within a 50-year period.
 What is important today is to encourage,
 not to discourage, use of the great St.
 Lawrence Seaway.  In doing so, we shall
 not only take advantage of the great po-
 tential which the seaway holds for Ohio
 and for all the States in the Midwest, but
 in the long run through greater use of
 the St. Lawrence Seaway we shall enable
 it to liquidate its debt with greater dis-
 patch and probably in many fewer years
 than the 50 years now contemplated.
 Increasing toll rates at this time would
 only work to destroy the effectiveness of
 the seaway.
 Mr. President, on June 16, 1966, there
 appeared an excellent editorial, entitled
 "Why Not?" in the Toledo Blade, one of
 the great newspapers of our Nation,
 commenting on this subject.  I commend
 this to my colleagues and ask unanimous
 consent that it be printed in the RECORD
 at this time as part of my remarks.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Toledo Blade, June 16, 19661
 WHY  NOT?
 "All of this nation's seaports, including
 the Great Lakes ports, should be placed on
 the same economic footing with equal rights
 of access to the oceans of the world."-Ser a-
 tor STEPHEN YOUNG.
 It remained for Ohio's Senator YOUNG to
 inject a bit of irrefutable logic into the de-
 bate over whether tolls on the St. Lawrence
 Seaway ought to be maintained at present
 levels, raised, or reduced.  It boils down to a
 question of just why this one waterway con-
 necting U.S. ports with ports abroad should
 be saddled with discriminatory tolls when
 other U.S. waterways on which tax funds are
 spent are toll-free.
 Senator YOUNG indicated that he intends
 to introduce legislation to impose tolls on
 vessels using coastal ports if the drive, led
 by Seaway opponents, to increase tolls on
 that waterway succeeds.  There is fully as
 much justification for that as there is for
 requiring vessels moving to and from the
 Great Lakes via the Seaway to pay tolls that
 run into thousands of dollars per passage.
 U.S. taxpayers, for instance, have had to
 pick up the $100 million bill-nearly as much
 as the entire U.S. investment in the Seaway-
 for construction of a ship channel serving
 New Orleans, but not a cent of toll is charged
 there.  Another $70 million in tax funds went
 into the Delaware River channel, $57 million
 into a channel linking Houston with the Gulf
 of Mexico, and $50 million to connect Sacra-
 mento with salt water, to mention but a few
 13433
 cases.  Yet, on none of those waterways do
 shippers pay a penny in toll charges.
 Why, then, should a 15,000-ton vessel using
 the Seaway be forced to fork over $14,000 in
 tolls, when the same ship could use any
 other U.S. waterway free?
 That is  a point  which  Senator  YouNG
 should keep raising, as he pierces the smoke-
 screen of propaganda thrown up by lobbyists
 for the eastern  ports, the railroads, and
 others who have little interest in seeing the
 Seaway succeed.  The Seaway should expect
 no special favors from our Government or
 from anyone else;  on the  other hand, it
 should not be hit by a toll schedule that no
 other tax-built and publicly supported wa-
 terway must carry.
 If those forces trying to reduce the Sea-
 way's competitive thrust by imposing higher
 tolls will not listen to reason, then perhaps
 they will get the Senator's message when, as
 the second ranking member of the Senate
 Public Works Committee, he dusts off legis-
 lation to meet fire with fire.
 HOME RULE FOR THE DISTRICT OF
 COLUMBIA
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, the lead
 editorial in today's Washington Post,
 entitled "The Road to the Polls," points
 out very well the difficulties besetting
 efforts to obtain home rule for the Dis-
 trict of Columbia.
 A reading of this editorial should per-
 suade anyone that is a cynical partisan
 political power play behind some of these
 efforts, seeking to lock in political power
 at the expense of what is needed and good
 for the people of the District.
 Specifically, these power interests wish
 to have elections at large on a partisan
 ticket; and they are content to pursue
 these goals even if it means the loss of
 a home-rule bill for the District.
 I recall, at the time the Senate passed
 a bill last year, the partisan power that
 was used to defeat amendments to make
 these elections nonpartisan and to re-
 quire members of the city council to be
 elected from separate wards rather than
 some or all of them at large.
 Those who genuinely wish to see home
 rule for the District would do well to
 dissociate themselves from the partisan
 political power players, who must bear
 the full responsibility for the failure of
 the Congress to promptly enact a good
 home-rule bill for the District.
 I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
 torial be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 The hope for city elections in Washington
 this year is being demolished by the very
 people who want them most. There are now
 four bills to extend the city's voting rights,
 and each is being vociferously attacked by
 the partisans of the others.  As the city's
 political leaders go  after each other,  the
 genuine enemies of local democracy can look
 on with their hands in their pockets and
 smiles on their faces.
 If none of these bills is passed in this
 Congress, the city will not be able to blame
 that misfortune on the wicked segregationists
 and the Board of Trade,  The responsibility
 will lie a great deal closer to home.  The Dis-
 trict's Democratic Central Committee is par-
 ticularly culpable.  Instead of using its au-

 all 'who favor elected self-government in
 Washington, the Committee is indulging it-
 self in the luxury of old vendettas and fol-
 lowing narrow factional interests.
 The future distribution of political power
 in the city depends heavily upon the char-
 acter of the election process.  Election at
 large, citywide, gives an advantage to poli-
 ticians with access to large citywide organiza-
 tions. Partisan elections give power to party
 managers.   Nonpartisan elections help in-
 dependent candidates, and elections by ward
 are essential to those who, like most slum
 politicians, have a personal following con-
 centrated in one neighborhood.
 The Administration's home rule bill, passed
 by the Senate but not the House, would es-
 tablish partisan elections and, for most of the
 important offices, citywide elections at large.
 It would greatly benefit the proprietors of the
 only citywide political organization In town,
 the Democratic Central Committee.  Small
 wonder that the Committee is ready to de-
 fend this version to the bitter end.
 The Sisk city charter bill, passed by the
 House but not the Senate, would establish an
 elected charter committee to decide the form
 of the future city government.  Since the
 elections to the, crucial charter committee
 would be nonpartisan but at large citywide,
 the Sisk bill is widely supported among the
 Democratic faction that was beaten in the
 last primary.
 The Green amendment, still in the House
 Education and Labor Committee, would es-
 tablish a School Board elected by ward on a
 nonpartisan ballot.  This kind of election
 would directly help the rising generation of
 young leaders in the central city, who have
 been working through social action organiza-
 tions and have no hope of favor from the
 parties.
 The fourth bill, to provide a nonvoting
 District delegate in the House, carries, little
 power and causes little stir.  All of these
 bills are honest and useful proposals.  The
 most promising, at this particular moment,
 is the bill for an elected School Board.
 While the Administration home rule bill
 prothises much more, It cannot be moved
 without massive intervention by the White
 House.
 But none of the bills can be passed without
 some measure of agreement among the city s
 political and civic leadership. It is still pos-
 sible for the city to go to the polls within the
 next year, but only If factional leaders show
 themselves capable of tactical skills not cur-
 rently visible.
 TAXATION AND INFLATION   ,
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, a timely
 and outstanding article, entitled "Taxa-
 tion Alone Cannot Cope With Inflation,"
 written by Harley L. Lutz, was published
 in the Wall Street Journal of Tuesday,
 June 21, 1966.  Dr. Lutz is professor
 emeritus of public finance at Princeton
 Vniversity.
 Dr. Lutz persuasively points out that
 an excessive increase in the money sup-
 ply is the direct cause of inflation; that
 taxation has no effect on the money
 supply; that budget balancing can be
 achieved by reduced Federal spending;
 and that this would be the better way to
 control the money supply in view of the
 drag effects of taxation.
 I ask unanimous consent that this
 article be printed in the RECORD.

 TAxATION ALONE CAN'T COPE WITH INFLATION
 (By Harley L. Lutz)
 The critical phase of the New Economics
 doctrine of perpetual prosperity through
 Government manipulation of the economy is
 approaching.   The  first stage-stimulation
 through deficits, cheap money, tax cuts, and
 guidelines for wage increases-is drawing to
 an end.  Despite positive evidence of an un-
 dercurrent of inflation, its existence, when
 not denied or ignored, was rationalized on
 the ground that expanding total demand was
 the chief prop of prosperity. This was a com-
 forting doctrine for both Government and
 business as long as inflation worked under-
 ground.  When It erupted into the price in-
 dexes the facts could no longer be disre-
 garded.  Inflation is now recognized to be a
 present danger.  The moment of truth is at
 hand.
 Inflation has two aspects.  One is the visi-
 ble evidence of rising prices, the other an ex-
 cessive increase of the money supply, exces-
 sive in relation to the supply needed to effect
 the exchange of produced goods and services
 at a given price level.  As used here money
 supply means demand deposits in commercial
 banks and currency In circulation.  Rising
 prices are more generally perceived and un-
 derstood than details of bank statements and
 Treasury reports.  They are not, however, the
 real thing but rather a symptom or outward
 expression of the basic inflationary force.
 TWO CATEGORIES AND POLICIES
 The policies designed to cope with infla-
 tion fall into two categories, according to
 whether the attack is directed at the symp-
 tom of rising prices or at the root cause.  The
 difference between superficial and fundamen-
 tal inflation control measures is apparent In
 the following summary:
 Policies aimed at inflation through price
 control:
 1. Price control by a Government agency,
 as In World War I1.
 2. Real or simulated outrage at price in-
 creases proposed by business concerns and
 severe pressure for rescission. No similar in-
 dignation at or condemnation of wage in-
 creases exceeding the guidelines.
 3. Dumping of Government stockpiles to
 prevent price increases.
 4. A campaign for consumer boycott of
 goods deemed to be priced too high.
 5. Pressure on business concerns to curtail
 or defer programs for new capital invest-
 ment.  Hints at repeal of the 7% investment
 credit.
 8. Tax Increase in the mistaken belief that
 it would cause prices to fall by reducing total
 demand.
 .  Policies aimed at curbing inflation by lim-
 iting or reducing money supply.
 1. Restriction of the capacity of commer-
 cial  banks  to  increase  demand  deposits
 through loans and Investments.
 2. Federal budget balance.
 The political approach to the problem
 deals primarily with the superficial aspect
 of inflation-rising prices-and only as a last
 resort, if at all, with the basic cause.  This is
 natural for more popular support can be
 garnered by attacks on profiteering and price
 "chiseling" than by essays on the technical-
 ities of monetary and fiscal policy.  An illus-
 tration is the bad semantic connotation of
 budget balance.  Moreover, a switch now to
 emphasis on fundamentals would mean an
 admission that the Government policies re-
 sponsible for inflation had been wrong. Any
 hint of fallibility is bad for the political
 image.
 Since inflation is a blowing up, or Inflat-
 ing of the money supply, effective control
 involves action to halt the expansion.  Thin
 requires a combination of monetary and fis-
 cal policy.  The details- of monetary policy
 must be dealt with here only briefly for the
 main emphasis Is to be on the role of taxa-
 tion in an inflation control program.  Spe-
 cifically, it is a question of the extent to
 which taxation, as an instrument of policy,
 can check inflation by influencing the money
 supply.
 SOURCE OF NEW MONEY
 The main source of increased money sup-
 ply is the expansion of loans and Invest-
 ments by commercial banks through the pro-
 cedure  of                                                                                                                                                                           entering the proceeds of these
 transactions as demand deposit credits.  Cur-
 rency in circulation has also increased. but its
 chief function is to serve as pocket and till
 money and for some payrolls.   Any issue
 above these needs will not stay in circula-
 tion but will drift into the banks.  For the
 greater part of total purchases and other pay-
 ments is effected by means of checks and
 other documents drawn on deposit accounts.
 Restriction of bank credit expansion  is
 applied through appropriate monetary ac-
 tion, including sales of securities  by the
 Federal Open Market Committee to soak up
 member bank reserves  and  a higher dis-
 count rate when these banks borrow from
 their respective Reserve Banks to replenish
 reserves.  The discount rate was advanced
 to 4,5% last winter amid grumblings from
 "diehard" cheap money advocates.  In  a
 single week of mid-April, 1966, the Commit-
 tee sold $1,084 million of Government se-
 curities to tighten the brakes on credit ex-
 pansion.  Further restrictive action may be
 in the offing.
 The expansion of demand deposits occurs
 in response to both private and public de-
 mand for more credit accommodation.  Just
 why the process of bank lending and invest-
 ing should, in the course of a boom, lead to
 creation of an excessive money supply is
 explicable only In terms of human attitudes
 and  behavior.   It  can best be explained
 briefly by saying that in a boom expectations
 eventually outrun realizations. Speculative
 anticipation of.the future becomes extrava-
 gant.  Hence loans are made at greater risk.
 Investments are screened less cautiously.
 Assurance of Government economists that
 the economic cycle has been abolished con-
 tributes to expansionary enthusiasm by re-
 moving the fear of a deflationary downturn.
 In recent years the Government's own ex-
 ample and influence have been on the side
 of cheap money, easy credit, and disregard
 of prudence in spending. For these and other
 reasons,  over-optimistic  credit  policy  in-
 creases the money supply at a greater rate
 than justified by long-term reality.    Infla-
 tion control requires that the increase be
 slowed down to a rate consistent with main-
 tenance of a stable price level.
 Both the private and the public sectors of
 the economy have contributed to excessive
 expansion of credit and adequate control
 measures must be appropriate to these re-
 spective transactions.  In this regard a sig-
 nificant difference  emerges.  Private credit
 can be controlled and regulated by mone-
 tary policy, provided the Federal Reserve
 System is not prevented from -exercising the
 necessary restraint by political pressure and
 interference.  There is no authority superior
 to the Federal Government to regulate the
 amount and the terms of its borrowing.  Its
 fiscal and monetary discipline must be self-
 imposed.
 Thus we have a definite boundary to our
 topic.  Established agencies can effectively
 control private credit excesses, though there
 will always be criticism of Federal Reserve
 operations as being sometimes too much, too
 little, too soon, or too late.  From this point
 on the concern will be with the measures

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                   `13409
 league has laid down, there is, I believe,
 a duty incumbent upon the executive
 branch of the Government to respond to
 this challenge posed by the Senator from
 Michigan.  it should indicate to the
 Senator and to the Senate how it intends
 to improve the procedures and how it in-
 tends to remove the apparently tremen-
 dous opportunity for corruption that
 exists in the use of the commodity im-
 port program.
 I would also like to state to my able
 friend from Michigan that I thoroughly
 applaud his excellent and constructive
 suggestion that businessmen in America
 devote their knowledge and experience
 to the business of the Government of the
 United States for a temporary period of
 time.  In this manner, they can bring
 their unique and successful qualifications
 under the free enterprise system to bear
 in the exceedingly important cause of
 freemen 10,000 miles from this Chamber.
 There is also a great deal of pride for
 all Americans, to be found in. what our
 young men in the U.S. Marine Corps did
 with respect to the civilian population of
 South Vietnam.  The  Senator from
 Michigan has ably drawn our attention
 to the outstanding efforts of our fighting
 men in the small hamlets and villages in
 the rural part of that tragic and melan-
 choly land. I was particularly proud to
 know that our men in uniform have as-
 sisted  young people  in constructing
 schools and the local, Indigenous popu-
 lfztion in improving agriculture.
 Now I should like to ask the Senator
 a question. In the Senator's opinion, is
 our civilian aid program working with
 the civilian aims of our military person-
 nel in that country?
 the able Senator in that we do have ex-
 cellent and able American civilians in
 that area. Some of them raised consid-
 erable question, in connection with our
 Appropriations  Committee  function,
 that perhaps there was not sufficient at-
 tention given to the problems of the
 civilian population. As the Senator has
 said, 80 percent of the people in Vietnam
 live in rural areas. It is in these small
 villages and hamlets, where such prob-
 lems as inadequate sanitation and anti-
 quated techniques of agriculture and the
 like, offer a tremendous opportunity for
 this fine program to help the civilian
 population and the cause for freedom.
 I would like to thank the Senator for
 his admirable presentation and for his
 lucid response to my question. I would
 again like to welcome the Senator from
 Michigan to the Senate and to thank
 him for his able and constructive speech.
 Mr. GRIFFIN.  I thank the Senator.
 I also wish to express appreciation to
 the majority leader for making it pos-
 sible for me to make this speech at this
 time.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I am glad we had
 the opportunity to have the Senator
 make his speech.                -
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, let me
 say that I regret that committee assign-
 ment respofisibility prevented me from
 being on the floor when the distinguished
 Senator from Michigan  [Mr. GRIFFIN]
 addressed the Chamber. His experience
 in that troubled area, his great record
 in Congress, have enabled him to give
 to our own colleagues, and indeed to the
 Nation, a great insight into the prob-
 lems to which he has directed attention.
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Senator
 from Kansas [Mr. PEARSON] be allowed
 to speak for 5 minutes, and I also ask
 unanimous consent that thereafter the
 Senator from Alaska [Mr.  BARTLETT]
 may be allowed to speak for 30 minutes.
 The   RESIDING  OFFICER.         Is
 there q~bction?  Without objection, it
 is sd o  e ed.
 Mr. GRIFFIN.  Mr. President, first, I
 thank my distinguished colleague from
 California for his very kind observations.
 I think, generally speaking, that there
 is close cooperation and liaison between
 our AID agency in Vietnam and our mili-
 tary.          I elaborate On my statement by
 emphasizing that my criticism is not
 focused, or is not intended  to  be
 focused, on all aspects of our AID pro-
 gram in Vietnam.  I am particularly
 pointing out the commodity import pro-
 gram.
 I also want to emphasize that we have
 many fine, competent, dedicated people
 in Vietnam in the AID agency.  They
 are not all incompetent, by any means.
 Particularly in the pacification program,
 for example, we have people in the AID
 agency who are out in the countryside,
 incurring considerable personal risk, and
 who are doing a very fine job in some of
 the same areas in which the marines are
 doing it.  When I mentioned the ma-
 rines, I do not wish to imply that that is
 the only part of the military that is doing
 this work with the people there. It just
 happens that I had an opportunity to be
 . a the field with the marines.
 I hope, with That elaboration, perhaps
 the address I have made today will be
 placed in a proper perspective.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  The Senator has in-
 deed done Just that. What prompted my
 interest was an Opportunity I had to
 speak with some returning military and
 civilian personnel over the last year.
 Our conversations reflected the views of
 VIETNAM CREDIBILITY GAP
 Mr. PEARSON. Mr. President, on May
 29 Radio Moscow devoted some attention
 to the speech I made on this floor on May
 27 wherein the Soviets indicated that yet
 another U.S. Senator had criticized the
 President for his Vietnam policy.
 I would not expect to be correctly re-
 ported or correctly interpreted by Radio
 Moscow, but I shall not let their misrep-
 resentation go without response.
 Mr. President, I support a policy aimed
 at the containment of communism in
 southeast Asia; the halting of Commu-
 nist aggression and the guarantee of an
 independent  and  a  peaceful  South
 Vietnam.
 But, Mr. President, what I sought to
 interpret on May 27 is some meaning as
 to why the American people are con-
 cerned and confused about our commit-
 ment and about our participation in
 Vietnam.  For the truth of the matter
 is that our Nation is at war. Our objec-
 tives are honorable and worthy.  The
 American people genuinely want to sup-
 port the President in any international
 crisis.
 Yet to the average citizen whose sup-
 port is so vital in our democratic system
 we appear to be helpless victims of a
 situation we cannot control; that the
 most powerful Nation in the world can-
 not determine its own destiny; and that
 while we know where we have been, it is
 impossible to guess where we will be in
 the future.
 Why is there such uncertainty and
 confusion?  Why do the polls and the
 surveys indicate a lack of support for
 the President who acts as the Com-
 mander in Chief of a nation which has al-
 ways responded with  great unity in
 times of international confrontations?
 The inevitable answer was that the
 administration's position was not be-
 lievable. There was a lack of credibility.
 And in the Washington lexicon of the
 day there existed a "credibility gap."
 With some due candor I would assume
 that this is a result of partisan politics
 in an election year. Yet the most vocif-
 erous critics are members of the Presi-
 dent's party.  And one cannot overlook
 the fact that there continue to be a
 growing number of newspaper editors
 and columnists who are constrained to
 question our policy.
 So, while the ever-present partisan
 politics is always present, this lack of
 belief in the administration's policy must
 be caused by something else. And that
 something else is a mismatch between
 words and deeds, a contradiction be-
 tween ends and means and a conflict in
 statements and actions which have ex-
 isted over a long period of time and
 which in turn brings about that slow
 erosion of public confidence.
 Therefore, the tragedy of the most
 agonizing episode in the midsixties for
 all Americans may be that our Vietnam
 policy may fail-not because they are
 wrong, but because our people are con-
 fused and disillusioned.              -
 Mr. President, this confusion stems,
 it seems to me, from three administra-
 tion weaknesses regarding our policy in
 Vietnam.  The first is the administra-
 tion's unhealthy obsession with a notion
 that it is always right and never wrong-
 or that, at least, it should so present
 itself.
 And second is the administration's
 overpowering urge to be "all things to all
 men," to govern by consensus not only
 in domestic, but in foreign policy.  The
 emphasis, therefore, has been on nul-
 lifying domestic and international criti-
 cism rather than following a policy best
 designated to achieve the objectives
 sought.
 And third is what appears to be the ad-
 ministration's aversion to long-range
 planning, a predisposition of "playing
 things by ear," of responding rather
 than taking the initiative.
 If one asserts that such weaknesses
 exist, there is, of course, the responsi-
 bility to offer some documentation.
 Mr. President, in recent weeks there
 have been repeated stories of shortages
 of war materials in Vietnam.  Now if
 we know anything about past military
 buildups of this sort, we know that such

 Treaty Obligations.
 The administration talks about our
 commitment by past administrations, by
 the Kennedy administration and by the
 Eisenhower administration. These com-
 mitments supposedly are binding upon
 our Government and on our people for
 which we are honor bound.  The truth
 of the matter is that the Eisenhower
 commitment was nothing more than a
 letter to the Diem Government offering
 economic and technical assistance upon
 the  condition  that there would  be
 achieved certain social, economic and
 political reforms.
 June !2, 1966
 great political display. But even at the
 time it was underway many felt that
 the objective was to nullify criticism
 rather than to find a response to our
 peace offensive.
 The point is if in the past months we
 had been making the proper diplomatic
 efforts then this diplomatic spectacular
 would have been unnecessary.  And if
 we had not been making the proper di-
 plomatic efforts for peace then this jet
 diplomacy would convince no one.
 Let me make reference to the severe
 problem of government stability in South
 Vietnam.  A great cloud hangs over
 America's involvement with the numer-
 ous Saigon governments.
 I specifically make reference to the
 Honolulu Conference.  The situation at
 that time was that the peace offensive
 had failed, the bombing had been re-
 sumed in the north, the desperately
 needed economic, social, and political re-
 forms had not taken place, criticism of
 the administration's position was in-
 creasing as manifested by the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee hearings.
 It was precisely at this point that the
 President, together with his top advisors,
 went off to a conference with Premier
 Ky, and here again the general feeling
 among many was that this was to nullify
 criticism at home rather than to extend
 a long range policy.
 Secretary McNamara's recent offhand
 comment that the conflict between the
 Ky regime and the Buddhists was
 healthy sign was either thoughtless or
 naive.
 Now, Mr. President, one can under-
 stand the niceties of diplomacy and the
 delicate circumstances of international
 relations.  But if the United States ap-
 proves and supports each government,
 we, in turn, compound the confusion in
 the minds and in the consciences of our
 people.
 Mr. President, the great confusion lies
 in the mismatched words and deeds of
 the administration.
 Mr. President, if we are to reduce this
 to a single proposition, looking back over
 the long and troubled past, one will see
 that the administration from time to
 time has taken a public position that we
 would commit ourselves only so far, and
 at the same time the administration as-
 serted that there were certain actions
 which we would not do and that this
 scope of commitment would achieve the
 objectives that we seek.  Then inevit-
 ably conditions change and the admin-
 istration does the very act that they
 promised not to do, whether it be in-
 creased troop commitment or some other
 action

 The Senate met at 11 o'clock a.m., and
 was called to order by the Acting Presi-
 dent pro tempore (Mr. ME'rcALF).
 The Chaplain, Rev. Frederick Brown
 Harris,  D.D.,  offered  the  following
 prayer:
 0 Lord our God, whose love is so gra-
 cious and tender that it passeth under-
 standing, we bow before Thee in grati-
 tude at the remembrance of Thy mer-
 cies. Bring us, we beseech Thee, into the
 quiet sanctuary of Thy presence that we
 may be still and know that Thou art God.
 In spite of all the evil that stalks the
 earth with shackles and chains, we thank
 Thee for human kindness, for hope that
 shines undimmed, for faith that is daunt-
 less, and for all the qualities of high per-
 sonality that cannot be bought. Let Thy
 beauty, 0 Lord, be upon us, that our
 spirits may be radiant as in Thy strength
 we face the perplexities of these troubled
 days. Use us, we pray Thee, as ambassa-
 dors of good will.  At the end, without
 stumbling or stain, strengthen our arms
 as in all the world we fight for righteous-
 ness and justice and truth.
 We ask it in the name of that One
 who is the life and truth and the way.
 Amen.

 ING TRANSACTION OF ROUTINE
 MORNING BUSINESS
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that at the con-
 clusion of the speech to be delivered by
 the distinguished junior Senator from
 Michigan [Mr. GRIFFIN], which I under-
 stand is not to exceed 45 minutes, there
 be a period for the transaction of rou-
 tine morning business, with statements
 to be limited to 3 minutes.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. Without objection, it is so ordered.
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr.     MANSFIELD.  Mr.  President,
 once again I wish to state that after the
 Senate disposes of the metal and non-
 metallic mine safety bill, which will be
 the pending business at the conclusion
 of the morning hour, it is our intention
 to take up tomorrow the Traffic Safety
 Act. I urge all Senators to be in the city
 and available for attendance in the
 Chamber, because there may be amend-
 ments to be voted on.

 Chair recognizes the Seljator from Mich-

 at an hour of testing in the history of
 the Republic.
 Ten thousand miles from this Cham-
 ber, on the other side of our planet,
 more than 300,000 young Americans are
 engaged in fighting an enemy who is
 everywhere and nowhere-an enemy who
 walks barefoot through the rice paddies
 of the Mekong Delta and rides through
 the streets of Saigon on a bicycle carry
 ing a bomb.
 Mr. President, I served 14 months over-
 seas during World War II, and I do not
 claim to be a military expert.  Recently,
 I spent 5 days, from May 9 to May 14, in
 Vietnam as a member of the House
 Subcommittee on Foreign Operations
 and Government Information, studying
 the commodity import program of the
 U.S. Agency for International Develop-
 ment.  I do not come back and profess
 to be an expert on all the problems of
 Vietnam.  During my visit in Vietnam,
 I had an opportunity to meet and engage
 in discussions with our top military, po-
 litical,  and economic representatives,
 with our soldiers in the field, and with
 the Vietnamese people themselves.
 With all humility, I offer some assess-
 ments and conclusions.  I earnestly hope
 that they will contribute to a better unf
 derstanding of the problems we face in
 Vietnam.  For one need not be an ex-
 pert to realize that in Vietnam we are
 confronted with a new and terrible kind
 of war-terrorism that makes pawns of
 the innocent, and severely tests the mo-
 rale, the loyalty, and the steadfastness of
 the civilian population.
 In Vietnam the economic and political
 know-how of the 20th century is strug
 gling to bring nationhood out of subver
 Sion, and some order out of chaos..
 Whether South Vietnam, with the
 military and economic help of the United
 States, will be able to survive this ordeal,
 no one can predict with certainty. Mili-
 tarily speaking, I believe we can see
 some light at the end of the tunnel ;
 however, the possibility continues that
 the tunnel may cave in before we reach
 the end.
 THE CHALLENGE OF  COMMUNIST TERROR
 I should like to suggest that two wars
 are raging in Vietnam today: one is the
 war to defeat the Communist Vietcong
 in the countryside and in the villages of
 the south and to repel overt aggression
 from the north; the other is the war
 to win the people, so that they can create
 a viable political, social, and economic
 order-in short, so that they can build

 13408                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 WHO IS TO BLAME?
 A good part of the blame for the past
 and present situation in Vietnam must
 be laid at the door of top AID officials.
 Consider these facts about the AIL)
 mission In Vietnaxfi:
 First. On March 26, 1966, AID mis-
 sion personnel in Vietnam totaled ap-
 proxynately 2,800 which is nearly the
 number stationed in Washington. How-
 ever, until recently there were only a
 handful of American AID employees in
 Vietnam whose principal concern was
 the administration of the commodity
 import program.  A year ago there was
 only one such employee.
 Second. While I was in Vietnam, four
 key administrative posts, including the
 position of Deputy Director, were vacant.
 Third. There have been four different
 Directors of the Vietnam AID mission
 during the past 4 years.
 Fourth. There have been few audits of
 the AID operation in Vietnam.  At the
 time of our visit, there had been no au-
 dits of the operation by AID-Washing-
 ton since 1961.  Controls and supervi-
 sion over the commodity import program
 by Washington or Saigon have been min-
 imal or nonexistent.
 In,, other words, the AID agency in
 Washington and Saigon has been "look?-
 ing the other way."  Its personnel poli-
 cies have been inadequate.  During the
 past 5 years there have been no mean-
 ingful measures, to check or audit this
 vital program.
 Since the House Foreign Operations
 Subcommittee took an interest in this
 problem several months ago, however, I
 am pleased to report that the attitude in
 Washington has been changing. In re-
 cent weeks three high level teams have
 been dispatched to Saigon to investigate,
 including the Inspector GenerqLl for For-
 eign Assistance, the Controller of AID,
 and a high level team from the General
 Accounting Office.
 These are important-although disas-
 trously late-first steps toward improv-?
 ing the administration of the commodity
 import  program.  I trust these first-
 hand observations will help to spur
 meaningful reforms.
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?
 In the long run, peace in South Viet-
 nam means political security and eco-?
 nomic  progress  for  the  people.  The
 United States, alone, cannot supply these
 vital commodities under any foreign aid
 program, but we can help the Vietna-
 mese if they will help themselves.
 Our military men are doing their job.
 But when soldiers are dying in battle for
 the cause of South Vietnam's freedom,
 our civilian personnel must also perform
 up to the same standards.  In many re-
 spects, -their responsibilities are more
 subtle, more complex, and more difficult
 than military objectives.  One thing is
 certain, this economic and social chal-
 lenge will not be met just by throwing
 U.S. funds around as if they were hand
 grenades in a battle.
 Specifically, I would recommend four
 steps to be taken right now to upgrade
 our civilian programs in Vietnam.
 First, I propose the establishment of
 an Executive Service Corps patterned
 along the lines of the Peace Corps.  I
 believe greater incentives must be pro-
 vided to attract businessmen and others
 with special training and experience to
 serve as civilians in the "other war" in
 Vietnam.  We need to put to work the
 best talents and the genius of American
 enterprise in this total effort.
 I envision a program that would stim-
 ulate greater interest among American
 businessmen to serve their Government
 on a longer term basis than is currently
 the case.
 The program might involve an expan-
 sion of principles and guidelines already
 laid by the successful International Ex-
 ecutive Service Corps, which is a private
 nonprofit group of volunteer business-
 men who have served in such countries
 as Iran and Taiwan, but not in Vietnam.
 The Executive Service Corps should
 encourage executives to take a 1- to
 3-year leave from their businesses-with-
 out loss of position or status-to serve
 the country overseas while enlarging
 their  own  administrative  experience.
 Such an infusion of talent would provide
 a real "shot in the arm" for the AID
 program in Vietnam and, at the same
 time, it could open the way for more
 meaningful' cooperation  between    the
 business community and Government in
 the whole field of economic development.
 Second, a team of auditors and investi-
 gators must be stationed in Vietnam-
 not to execute the profiteers, but to show
 simply and firmly that the United States
 insists. upon honest accounting for its
 funds. By cutting back and stopping the
 "under the table" profits in Saigon, we
 would help significantly to combat the
 traditional country-city hostility in Viet-
 nam and spread the benefits of U.S. aid
 more equitably among the South Viet-
 namese people.
 Third, career incentives should be de-
 veloped to attract the most competent
 and dedicated AID personnel to serve in
 Vietnam.  This could be accomplished
 by requiring successful service in a crisis
 area like Vietnam as a condition of pro-
 motion above a certain level, or by per-
 mitting AID or Foreign Service person-
 nel with responsibilities in Vietnam to
 be eligible for promotion within a shorter
 period, or by screening AID personnel for
 Vietnam so carefully that such an as-
 signment would be considered an indi-
 cation of superior ability.  There are
 many ways, within the AID organiza-
 tion, to insure that only the best are sent
 to Vietnam, but so far, to my knowledge,
 these methods have not been fully em-
 ployed.
 Fourth,  additional       programs  are
 needed to reach the rural areas-which,
 after all, contain 80 percent of the Viet-
 namese people.  They must be programs
 that do not pour black market money
 into the countryside.     Such programs
 should offer realistic and practical help
 in farming,  irrigation,  transportation,
 health, and the like. Community clinics
 for such endemic ills as trachoma, and
 sympathetic    treatment  for  civilians
 wounded by military actions, for example,
 would have a far-reaching impact upon
 the South Vietnamese people.
 THE  ULTIMATE  OBJECTIVE
 The ultimate objective for South Viet-
 nam is nationhood.  But the South Viet-
 June rR, 1966
 namese, not the United States, must
 build it.  As Americans strive and look
 forward to peace and a day when mean-
 ingful elections will be held-when the
 South Vietnamese will freely select their
 own government-we must not forget
 that in the long run the United States
 cannot rule, the Vietnamese people--we
 cannot govern for them.
 Mr. President, while I was in Vietnam,
 I spent a part of a day with the U.S. Ma-
 rines in the Da Nang area visiting a small
 village-actually a hamlet-where about
 35 or 40 people live.  The marines had
 helped to build a very crude school for
 the youngsters in that hamlet; it was ap-
 parent that the Marine Corps is concen-
 trating particular attention on the Viet-
 namese children.  Throughout the Da
 Nang area our marines are taking a very
 real personal interest in the people of the
 villages and hamlets, working with them
 on their agricultural problems, helping
 them find ways to irrigate the fields and
 to grow more rice, and helping to provide
 security during the harvest. At a near-
 by children's hospital built and operated
 .by our marines, Vietnamese nurses were
 being paid by the marines out of their
 own pockets.
 The marines that I visited in the Da
 Nang area represent the kind of example
 that Americans must hold out to the peo-
 ple of Vietnam. Surely, it is not asking
 too much to expect that U.S. civilian per-
 sonnel in the "other war" will demon-
 strate a comparable interest and com-
 petency, and that our AID programs will
 be administered efficiently and effective-
 ly. This is the least that American civil-
 ians can do while American servicemen
 are sacrificing their lives.  At present,
 unfortunately, it is more than we are
 doing.
 Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President,: will the
 Senator from Michigan yield?
 Mr. GRIFFIN. I am happy to yield to
 the Senator from California.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, I would
 like to say, with respect to the lucid ad-
 dress to which the Senate has just lis-
 tened, that as an American, I am de-
 lighted to greet our new and able col-
 league from Michigan.
 As a Republican, I am particularly
 grateful that one with his background in
 American government now graces this
 Chamber.
 I believe it was my late, great, and il-
 lustrious predecessor, Hiram Johnson
 who on one occasion said, "In war, the
 first casualty is truth."  It is an aspect
 of this problem which the distinguished
 junior Senator from Michigan has out-
 lined so carefully to the Senate today.
 I trust that his message will carry beyond
 this Senate to the executive branch of
 the Government.  These problems have
 arisen in the heat of conflict; a conflict
 which certainly involves the honor and
 integrity of the American system. They
 must be brought to the attention of the
 American people. Action must be taken
 to increase our scrutiny of the manner
 in which our commodity import program
 is being conducted in South Vietnam to-
 day.
 in view of the gravity of the charges
 which have been made and the specific
 recommendations which our able col-

 league has laid down, there is, I believe,
 a._duty incumbent upon the executive
 branch of the Government to respond to
 this challenge posed by the Senator from
 Michigan.  It should indicate to the
 Senator and to the Senate how it intends
 to improve the procedures and how it in-
 tends to remove the apparently tremen-
 dous opportunity for corruption that
 exists in the use of the commodity im-
 port program.
 I would also like to state to my able
 friend from Michigan that I thoroughly
 applaud his excellent and constructive
 suggestion that businessmen in America
 devote their knowledge and experience
 to the business of the Government of the
 United States for a temporary period of
 time.-- In this manner, they can bring
 their unique and successfur'qualifications
 under the free enterprise system to bear
 In the exceedingly important cause of
 freemen 10,000 miles from this Chamber.
 There is also a great deal of pride for
 all Americans, to be found in what our
 young men in the U.S. Marine Corps did
 with respect to the civilian population of
 South Vietnam.   The Senator from
 Michigan has ably drawn our attention
 to the outstanding efforts of our fighting
 men in the small hamlets and villages in
 the rural part of that tragic and melan-
 choly land. I was particularly proud. to
 know that our men in uniform have as-
 sisted  young people  in constructing
 schools and the local, Indigenous popu-
 lation in improving agriculture.
 Now I should like to ask the Senator
 a question. In the Senator's opinion, is
 our civilian aid program working with
 the civilian aims of our military person-
 nel in that country?
 Mr. GRIFFIN.  Mr. President, first, I
 thank my distinguished colleague from
 California for his very kind observations.
 I think, generally speaking, that there
 Is close cooperation and liaison between
 cur AID agency In Vietnam and our mili-
 tary.         I elaborate on my statement by
 emphasizing that my criticism is not
 roeused, or is not Intended  to  be
 Focused, on all aspects of our AID pro-
 tram in Vietnam.  I am particularly
 )ointing out the commodity import pro-
 ;ram.
 I also want to emphasize that we have
 nany fine, competent, dedicated people
 n Vietnam in the AID agency.  They
 are not all incompetent, by any means.
 )articularly in the pacification program,
 For example, we have people in the AID
 agency who are out in the countryside,
 ,incurring considerable personal risk, and
 who are doing a very fine job in some of
 the sane areas in which the marines are
 doing it.  When I mentioned the ma-
 rines, I do not wish to imply that that is
 the only part of the military that is doing
 this work with the people there. It just
 happens that Thad an opportunity to be
 in the field with the marines.
 I hope, with that elaboration, perhaps
 the address I have made today will be
 placed in a proper perspective.
 Mr. KUCHEL. 'the Senator has in-
 deed done just that. What prompted my
 interest was an opportunity I had to
 speak with some returning military and
 civilian personnel ' over the last year.
 Our conversations reflected the views of
 the able Senator in that we do have ex-
 cellent and able American civilians in
 that area. Some of them raised consid-
 erable question, in connection with our
 Appropriations  Committee  function,
 that perhaps there was not sufficient at-
 tention ' given to the problems of the
 civilian population. As the Senator has
 said, 80 percent of the people in Vietnam
 live in rural areas. It is in these small
 villages and hamlets, where such prob-
 lems as inadequate sanitation and anti-
 quated techniques of agriculture and the
 like, offer a tremendous opportunity for
 this fine program to help the civilian
 population and the cause for freedom.
 I would like to thank the Senator for
 his admirable presentation and for his
 lucid response to my question. I would
 again like to welcome the Senator from
 Michigan to the Senate and to thank
 him for his able and constructive speech.
 Mr. GRIFFIN.  I thank the Senator.
 I also wish to express appreciation to
 the majority leader for making it pos-
 sible for me to make this speech at this
 time.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I am glad we had
 the opportunity to have the Senator
 make his speech.
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, let me
 say that I regret that committee assign-
 ment responsibility prevented me from
 being on the floor when the distinguished
 Senator from Michigan [Mr. GRIFFIN]
 addressed the Chamber. His experience
 in that troubled area, his great record
 in Congress, have enabled him to give
 to our own colleagues, and indeed to the
 Nation, a great Insight into the prob-
 lems to which he has directed attention.
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the Senator
 from Kansas [Mr. PEARSON] be allowed
 to speak for 5 minutes, and I also ask
 unanimous consent that thereafter the
 Senator from Alaska [Mr.  BARTLETT]
 may be allowed to speak for 30 minutes.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.      Is
 there objection?  Without objection, it
 is so ordered.
 tives are honorable and worthy.  The
 American people genuinely want to sup-
 port the President in any international
 crisis.
 Yet to the average citizen whose sup-
 port is so vital in our democratic system
 we appear to be helpless victims of a
 situation we cannot control; that the
 most powerful Nation in the world can-
 not determine its own destiny; and that
 while we know where we have been, it is
 impossible to guess where we will be in
 the future.
 Why is there such uncertainty and
 confusion?  Why do the polls and the
 surveys indicate a lack of support for
 the President who acts as the Com-
 mander in Chief of a nation which has al-
 ways responded with  great unity in
 times of international confrontations?
 The inevitable answer was that the
 administration's position was not be-
 lievable. There was a lack of credibility.
 And in the Washington lexicon of the
 day there existed a "credibility gap."
 With some due candor I would assume
 that this is a result of partisan politics
 in an election year. Yet the most vocif-
 erous critics are members of the Presi-
 dent's party.  And one cannot overlook
 the fact that there continue to be a
 growing number of newspaper editors
 and columnists who are constrained to
 question our policy.
 So, while the ever-present partisan
 politics is always present, this lack of
 belief in the administration's policy must
 be caused by something else. And that
 something else is a mismatch between
 words and deeds, a contradiction be-
 tween ends and means and a conflict in
 statements and actions which have ex-
 isted over a long period of time and
 which in turn brings about that slow
 erosion of public confidence.
 Therefore, the tragedy of the most
 agonizing episode in the midsixties for
 all Americans may be that our Vietnam
 policy may fail-not because they are
 wrong, but because our people are con-
 fused and disillusioned.
 Mr. President, this confusion stems,
 it seems to me, from three administra-
 tion weaknesses regarding our policy in
 Vietnam.  The first is the administra-
 tion's unhealthy obsession with a notion

 shortages inevitably occur. And if these
 shortages are not the result of gross mis-
 management then they constitute only
 another of harsh facts of war-which
 is organized confusion at best.
 But what has been the administra-
 tion's response to, first, the press dis-
 closures of these shortages and later con-
 firmation by congressional committees?
 At first they were categorically denied.
 The Secretary of Defense described them
 as ?baloney,? an extreme example of the
 administration's overreaction of critics
 and an administration that admits no
 mistakes;  and  administration  policy
 which seeks to discredit critics, but
 which finally only raises new doubts.
 And then there was the speech by the
 distinguished junior Senator from New
 York [Mr. KENNEDY 1, who suggested that
 the United States should negotiate with
 the Vietcong.
 The  administration's  overreaction
 once again proposed that, first, they were
 in agreement; second, that they'were in
 complete disagreement; and, third, that
 they were "very close to Mr. KENNEDY'S
 views."
 This is another illustration of an ad-
 ministration trying to cover all bets, at-
 tempting to be all things to all people at
 all times.  But In the meantime, what
 is ow policy?  New doubts are raised.
 New confusions are created.
 In the order of things these may be
 matters of small circumstance, but let
 us go on to review issues of greater
 consequence.
 In the administration's explanation of
 the basic reasons as to why we are in
 Vietnam they speak in generalities.
 The administration spokesmen talk of
 defending freedom and democracy in
 South Vietnam.  These are admirable
 causes,  The very basic tenants of our
 foreign policy are to expand the bound-
 aries of freedom by means of halting ag-
 gression and by means of peaceful per-
 suasion. But admirable as they may be,
 who among us now really believes there
 is any real meaningful freedom and de-
 mocracy in Vietnam or indeed in south-
 east Asia?
 The administration speaks in terms of
 narrow legalisms, of honoring commit-
 ments, of contending that we are bound
 by the SEATO Treaty.  But if we are,
 other treaty members apparently do not
 appear to believe that they are so bound.
 And apparently the administration does
 not either for it has never really con-
 sulted with our allies regarding Vietnam
 policies.  It talks to them in terms of
 more men and material commitment, but
 it does not discuss policy or SEATO
 Treaty obligations.
 The administration talks about our
 commitment by past administrations, by
 the Kennedy administration and by the
 Eisenhower administration. These com-
 mitments supposedly are binding upon
 our Government and on our people for
 which we are honor bound.  The truth
 of the matter is that the Eisenhower
 commitment was nothing more than a
 letter to the Diem Government offering
 economic and technical assistance upon
 the  condition  that there would  be
 achieved certain social, economic and
 political reforms.
 Mr. President, the real reason we are
 in South Vietnam today is to prevent the
 spread  of  imperialistic,  totalitarian
 communism into South Vietnam and
 into the rest of southeast Asia which
 threatens the peace of the world.   This
 has been a cornerstone of our foreign
 policy for two decades.  It is the basis
 of the Marshall plan; it was the reason
 we instituted the airlift into Berlin; that
 we resisted Soviet-sponsored thrusts into
 Greece, Iran, and Turkey; it is the rea-
 son we opposed conventional warfare in
 Korea; it is the reason we reacted to the
 missile crisis in Cuba; and indeed it is
 the reason we are committed in south-
 east Asia. And the administration ought
 to say so.  The American people would
 understand.  But  to  talk  about  our
 presence there in terms of treaty com-
 mitments, legalistic arguments and talk
 of a war for freedom and democracy
 clouds the real reason and creates doubt
 and confusion.
 Let me make reference to another
 phase of this problem which has long
 been difficult for the American people
 to understand.  This is our position in
 regard to negotiations with the Commu-
 nists.  In May 1965 the President, in his
 now famous Johns Hopkins speech, said
 we would negotiate anywhere at any
 time without prior conditions. We then
 immediately imposed a condition our-
 selves and that was that we would not
 negotiate with the Vietcong.  Now, Mr.
 President, there may have been good
 and valid reasons why we should not
 negotiate with the National Liberation
 Front. Certainly we should not negotiate
 only with the Communists in South Viet-
 nam as Hanoi and Peking would suggest.
 But here again is more uncertainty.
 Note also that every time we escalate
 our peace effort we also escalate, in like
 manner, our military effort.  One dilutes
 In relation to the so-called peace feel-
 ers, I would remind the Senate that after
 our declaration that we would explore
 all possibilities of negotiation, the Amer-
 ican people learned of the overtures
 through the United Nations, through the
 Italian Foreign Minister and others only
 after evidence had come forth to the
 extent that the administration could no
 longer deny that they existed.  Again
 these overtures may not have been
 worthy of consideration.  The adminis-
 tration's position may have been abso-
 lutely sound.  But the administration
 was discredited when they first denied
 their existence and then had to acknowl-
 edge such contracts after public disclo-
 sure.
 I make reference also to the so-called
 peace offensive of January 1966. At that
 time all will recall that the bombing
 had  stopped.   Ambassador  Harriman
 was sent to Poland, Yugoslavia, and In-
 dia; Mr. McGeorge Bundy went to Ot-
 tawa; Ambassador Goldberg was sent
 to the Vatican, Rome, Paris, and Lon-
 don; the Vice President toured the Far
 East capitals; Ambassador Kohler called
 upon those in authority in the Soviet
 Union; Mr. G. Mennen Williams con-
 tacted several African nations; and Mr.
 Thomas Mann went to Mexico.
 This was a massive peace offensive. A
 great political display. But even at the
 time it was underway many felt that
 the objective was to nullify criticism
 rather than to find a response to our
 peace offensive.
 The point is if in the past months we
 had been making the proper diplomatic
 efforts then this diplomatic spectacular
 would have been unnecessary.  And if
 we had not been making the proper di-
 plomatic efforts for peace then this jet
 diplomacy would convince no one.
 Let me make reference to the severe
 problem of government stability in South
 Vietnam.  A great cloud hangs over
 America's involvement with the numer-
 ous Saigon governments.
 I specifically make reference to the
 Honolulu Conference.  The situation at
 that time was that the peace offensive
 had failed, the bombing had been re-
 sumed in the north, the desperately
 needed economic, social, and political re-
 forms had not taken place, criticism. of
 the administration's position was in-
 creasing as manifested by the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee hearings.
 It was precisely at this point that the
 President, together with his top advisors,
 went 'off to a conference with Premier
 Ky, and here again the general feeling
 among many was that this was to nullify
 criticism at home rather than to extend
 a long range policy.
 Secretary McNamara's recent offhand
 comment that the conflict between the
 Ky regime and the Buddhists was a
 healthy sign was either thoughtless or
 naive.
 Now, Mr. President, one can under-
 stand the niceties of diplomacy and the
 delicate circumstances of international
 relations.  But if the United States ap-
 proves and supports each government,
 we, in turn, compound the confusion in
 the minds and in the consciences of our
 people.
 Mr. President, the great confusion lie:
 in the mismatched words and deeds o`
 the administration.
 Mr. President, if we are to reduce thi
 to a single proposition, looking back ove
 the long and troubled past, one will se
 that the administration from time t
 time has taken a public position that w
 would commit ourselves only so far, an
 at the same time the administration a:
 serted that there were certain actiot
 which we would not do and that th
 scope of commitment would achieve tl-
 objectives that we seek.  Then inev;
 ably conditions change and the admin-
 istration does the very act that they
 promised not to do, whether It be in-
 creased troop commitment or some other
 action.  But now they say this new es-
 calation, this new commitment, will solve
 the Vietnam problem.  Yet the solution
 never comes.
 Let me illustrate.  In 1964 the Presi-
 dent said our objectives can be achieved
 without American troops.  Today there
 are  over  400,000  American troops  in
 North Vietnam.
 In 1954 the President indicated that.
 there would be no bombing north of the
 17th parallel.  At a later time air strikes
 into North Vietnam became necessary to
 cut the supply lines, yet supplies con-
 tinue to flow over the Ho Chi Minh trail
 in ever-increasing volume.

 electric cooperatives.  Therefore, I be-
 lieve every Member of this body will ben-
 efit from reading the careful discussion
 of the British Columbia financing scheme
 as reported in Barron's.  For this reason,
 I will insert this article iri its entirety at
 this point in my remarks:
 [From Barron's, June 13, 1966]
 THE PEACE MONGERS-A NOTE ON THE BRTTTsH
 COLeMBIA HYDRO AND POWER AUTHORITY
 "British Columbia Hydro and Power Au-
 thority has filed a registration statement
 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-
 mission relating to a proposed public offer-
 ing of $50,000,000 of Sinking Fund Bonds,
 Series Y, due July 2, 1991.  The underwriting
 group will be headed by Kuhn, Loeb & Co.,
 The First Boston Corp., Halsey, Stuart & Co.,
 Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
 Inc., Allen & Co., W. E. Button & Co., and
 James Richardson & Sons, Inc.  The Bonds
 will be direct and unconditional general ob-
 ligations of the Hydro and Power Authority.
 Principal and interest will be uncondition-
 ally guaranteed by the Province of British
 Columbia and will be payable in New York
 City in U.S. dollars.  Annual sinking fund
 payments commencing July 2, 1971, will re-
 tire 50%  of the issue prior to maturity.
 Purchases of the Bonds by United States
 persons will not be subject to the Interest
 Equalization Tax."
 In the busiest new issue market in the
 annals of Wall Street, the foregoing an-
 flouncement last week caused barely it rip-
 ple of interest.  On the previous day, after
 all, Louisville Gas & Electric Co. accepted
 a bid which represented the highest return
 on Triple-A utility obligations in a half-
 century.  Next day Fannie May offered the
 first instalment-$530 million worth-of loan
 participation certificates,  novel and con-
 troversial  government  securities  priced
 to yield up to an unprecedented 5.75%. De-
 spite its distant origins and relatively small
 size, however, the B.C. Hydro and Power Au-
 thority issue rates at least a footnote to
 financial history.  For it points up one of
 the Street's most unfortunate failings, its
 willingness to do business with men one
 can't trust.
 On this score British Columbia Hydro and
 Power Authority, as a creature of the Provin-
 pial government, eminently qualifies. A half-
 decade ago this government, headed then as
 now by the Honorable W.A.C. Bennett, leader
 of the Social Credit Party, launched the Au-
 thority through the simple expedient of seiz-
 ing the British Columbia Electric Co. After
 years of litigation, during which the B.C.
 Supreme Court ruled that Premier Bennett
 had acted illegally on every count, the Prov-
 ince and the utility finally reached a settle-
 ment.  From a bad beginning the Authority
 is moving steadily toward a dubious end: In
 view of the restraints on investment, domes-
 tic and foreign, now being urged on private
 enterprise in the U.S. and Canada alike, this
 is a curious moment to pursue a huge and
 costly project. Even in the best of times, as
 the prospectus neglects to point out, the
 Peace River development which the new
 bonds will help to finance would strike most
 observers as highly speculative.  Power, as
 Lord Acton once said, corrupts.   He should
 have lived to see public power.
 It's quite a sight.  On the U.S. side of the
 border stand such monuments to lack of
 principle as the obsolete nuclear power sta-
 tion at Hanford, Wash., as well as the Illegally
 financed generating plant of the Colorado-
 Ute Electric Association (Barron's, February
 21).  Now a project is rising north of the
 border, which-for size, cost and potential
 waste of resources-will dwarf anything on
 the continent.  Portage Mountain Dam on
 the Peace .River, spine 600 miles north of
 Vancouver, will boast on ultimate capacity

 of 2,270,000 kilowatts, several hundred thou-
 sand more than Grand Coulee, currently the
 largest in the world.  Including three storage
 dams planned under the Columbia River
 Treaty, the B.C. Hydro and Power Authority
 has blueprinted total capital outlays of $1.36
 billion for the next half-decade.  According
 to the prospectus for the forthcoming offer-
 ing, which constitutes merely the first round.
 "The Authority expects to obtain the $932
 million balance of the capital funds required
 by borrowing approximately two-thirds of
 that balance from Provincial Government in-
 vestment accounts and the remainder from
 other investors."
 While bursting with statistics, the pros-
 pectus is something less than a model of full
 disclosure.  For example, it scants the pro-
 tracted dispute between the Authority and
 the original owner of the properties, the
 British  Columbia  Electric  Co.  The  issue
 arose in mid-1961, when a bill to expropriate
 B.C. Electric was passed in record time. Lit-
 erally,                                                                             overnight,  as  Barron's  observed, a
 century-old     private   concern  became an
 agency of the Crown.         "The speed of the
 move," we went on, "was matched by its
 highhandedness.      In a previous case, an im-
 partial tribunal, after weighing such factors
 as future earning prospects and replacement
 costs, fixed the compensation.  Here, in con-
 trast, the price was decreed, solely on the
 basis of paid-in capital by the government
 itself, with no provision for appeal     . The
 terms are patently unfair to most stock-
 holders.  In the view of the Dominion's
 financial community, which has denounced
 them as 'arbitrary, unfair and inconsistent
 with the Canadian tradition of equity and
 legal recourse' such terms smack less of ex-
 propriation than of confiscation."
 The "Supreme Court of British Columbia
 agreed.  In July of 1963 it declared the en-
 abling                                                                             act  unconstitutional.   The  court
 added that the takeover price of $172 mil-
 lion, which purported to be "full, fair and
 adequate compensation," was too low.   B.C.
 Electric finally settled with the Province for
 $197 million,
 Water over the dam, some may say.      How-
 ever, in view of the large sums of private
 capital-all guaranteed by Victoria-which
 the Authority hopes to raise, surely the past
 is worth recounting.  As to the future, the
 prospectus sheds equally dim light.  For ex-
 ample, it nowhere breaks down total sched-
 uled investment between the three Colum-
 bia River dams, two of which will generate
 neither electricity nor profits, and the Peace
 River project itself.  It makes no effort to
 suggest where the power ultimately will go,
 or at what price or cost.  Queried about
 markets last week, the Authority told Bar-
 ron's it expects to sell its output primarily
 in British Columbia, with any surplus tick-
 eted for the Bonneville Power Administra-
 tion.  However, in view of the huge projected
 increase  in  kilowatts  (Portage  Mountain
 Dam will more than double present Provin-
 cial generating capacity), the competition
 likely from new discoveries of oil and gas
 (Rainbow Lake), and the declining cost of
 nuclear power, the confidence of the Peace
 mongers may prove misplaced.   As to the
 U.S., the Pacific Northwest, according to pri-
 vate utilities, will not lack for power in the
 'Seventies.
 If the past and future look murky, the
 present is clear.  B.C. Hydro and Power Au-
 thority, the prospectus shows, operates like
 anything but a business.    Its railroad and
 transit operations run at a loss.  Since tak-
 ing over from B.C. Electric, it has steadily
 reduced rates, notably to residential users,
 at the expense of profits.  In the 1962 fiscal
 year, the Authority showed a net income of
 $16.3 million on aggregate revenues of $133
 million; last year, in striking contrast, on
 $160 million it earned only $7.5 million.  In
 short,  a 20%  Increase in  gross has gone
 hand-in-hand with a 55% drop In net.
 In some circles, to be sure, such results
 are praiseworthy.  Thus, the Northwest Pub-
 bile Power Association last Spring presented
 British Columbia Hydro and Power Author-
 ity with the Paul J. Raver Award for Com-
 munity Service.                                                                                                                                      After listing its achieve-
 ments, the Citation reads: "The annuals of
 of the electric utility industry have never
 recorded so much progress in so little time."
 On both sides of the border, what former
 President Eisenhower labelled creeping so-
 cialism lately has been )making a great leap
 forward.  Wall Street    ould be the last to
 AM
 (Mr. WAGGONNER asked and was
 given permission to extend his remarks
 in the body of the RECORD and to include
 an editorial.)
 Mr. WAGGONNER.  Mr. Speaker, I
 have spoken a number of times about
 the failure of the news media to carry
 to the people the full story of our opera-
 tion in Vietnam.  I am pleased now for
 the opportunity to say that one paper I
 know of has no hesitancy to speak up on
 this vitally important side of our opera-
 tion there.  The Shreveport Times car-
 ried an editorial on June 18 which ex-
 presses my view exactly and I think it
 is important that other Members have
 a chance to see it also.
 THAT OTHER WAR
 What the average American hears from
 Viet  Nam usually  concerns  one  of  two
 things-combat operations against the Com-
 munists or the latest political upheaval in
 Saigon.
 But there's a third story about Viet Nam
 that ought to be told and that is what Amer-
 ica is doing, amid the chaos of war and polit-
 ical  turbulence, for the  people  of South
 Viet Nam.
 Most people are not aware that swarms
 of Americans are out working in the Viet-
 namese countryside;  not fighting, but re-
 building what has been lost in the war;
 building things like schools and clinics that
 Viet Nam never has had.
 Literally hundreds of thousands of Viet-
 namese people have been treated by Amer-
 ican medical teams, not' for war wounds but
 for ailments like round-worms and berriberri.
 What's more, nearly every American de-
 fense perimeter has a military clinic-and
 it serves not only U.S. and Vietnamese troops
 but, Vietnamese men, women and children.
 At the great Marine base of Da Nang, for
 instance, Marine doctors not only patch GI's
 but attend to Vietnamese villagers-many
 of  them  kids-who  sleep  right  alongside
 armed leathernecks.
 Politically, American forces are trying to
 teach the people some representative democ-
 racy at the grassroots, in the villages and
 provinces.  The idea is to build a viable,
 free-working  political  structure  from  the
 ground up.   If Viet Nam does ever have a
 really free election, this kind of American
 work will pay off.
 These positive American efforts to help all
 the Vietnamese people are not very often em-
 phasized.                                                                                                                                       Here we confess to puzzlement.
 The administration, it seems, could go a long
 way toward building up public confidence in
 what we are doing in Viet Nam by publiciz-
 ing our non-war efforts.
 For the truth is that Americans are fight-
 two wars in Viet Nam.  We can win and are
 winning the military war.  We also are try-
 ing to win a war against disease, poverty and
 ignorance.  We cannot be victorious in just
 one of these two struggles; both must be won
 if a real peace is to come to Viet Nam.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE            June 23,: 1966
 HORTON  RECOGNIZES  ANNIVER-
 SARY OF' EAST BERLIN UPRISING
 (Mr. HORTON asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to revise and
 extend his remarks and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, June 17
 marked the 13th anniversary of the East
 Berlin uprising.  While the House of
 Representatives was not in session on
 that day, I feel it is fitting at this time
 to recognize this significant event in
 man's fight for freedom and to honor the
 memory of those who participated in it.
 The entire world was aroused by the
 incidents which took place behind the
 Iron Curtain on June 17, 1953.  Even
 today freemen continue to marvel at the
 revolt which took place in East Berlin
 causing the Russian Government serious
 embarrassment and clearly demonstrat-
 ing'to the world how cruel and heartless
 the commissars and their puppet East
 Germans could be.
 Though under Russian occupation, the
 East Berliners, nevertheless did not lose
 sight of progress and improved living
 conditions made by their countrymen in
 the Western sector.  Those in the East
 were aware of the propaganda which the
 Soviets were feeding them, and when the
 hated dictator Stalin died in March 1953,
 the people of East Berlin felt that here
 was their chance to public dissatisfac-
 tion with their living conditions and lack
 of political freedom.  Thus on June 17
 began the heroic, but short-lived revolt
 which the Russians brutally put down.
 Many brave men and women were caught
 up in the Russian retaliation and paid
 the supreme sacrifice-their lives.  The
 example of their courage was not lost,
 however, and a few years later a similar
 revolt broke out in Hungary.    Clearly
 the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain was be-
 ing splintered and much of the credit
 belongs to the gallant people of East
 Berlin who defied the goliath of the
 Communist world.
 That Soviets and East Germans still
 fear the East Berliners' quest for free-
 dom is obvious with the construction in
 1962 of the infamous Berlin wall. What
 further indictment of communism's fail-
 ure is required than for it to feel obliged
 to wall a large segment of its people in?
 Mr. Speaker, it is possible that those
 East Berliners of the June 17 revolt never
 dreamed that its repercussions would
 still be felt in this year 1966.  But to
 their credit the regime of the East must
 either institute more repressive means to
 stifle dissent or grant the people more
 generous measures of freedom and equal-
 ity.            Time will judge what they choose.
 But time cannot erase the role played by
 those participants of the June 17 move-
 ment who struck a blow for freedom, the
 effects of which are still clearly evident.
 DEMOCRATS: THE HIGH INTEREST
 RATE PARTY
 (Mr. CURTIS (at the request of Mr.
 BucHANAN)   was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include. extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. CURTIS.  Mr. Speaker, I was ap-
 palled the other day to see $530 million
 of federally owned mortgages offered at
 an interest rate of 5.75 percent and a
 great loss to the Government.  This sale
 further  tightened  an  already  tight
 money situation and exerted further
 pressures toward high interest rates. It
 also diverted funds from the savings and
 loan industry and the housing market,
 further compounding the problems in
 those areas.  I think we can now truly
 call the Democrat Party the "high in-
 terest rate party."  It is particularly
 alarming that also involved is a decep-
 tive effort to cover up excessive deficit
 spending for more mismanaged Great
 Society  programs. Under  unanimous
 consent I insert an article from the Wall
 Street Journal of June 17 describing this
 situation :
 THE TANGLED WEB
 When officials first planned to step up sales
 of Government-owned.mortgages to private
 investors, they were sure they had a good
 idea, but by now they should be having their
 doubts.
 The Administration arguing for the sales,
 could picture itself as a foe of Big Govern-
 ment; after all, wasn't it substituting private
 for public credit?  True, in a sense: Private
 investors indeed will be collecting the in-
 terest on the loans.  The mortgages remain
 Federally insured, though, so the  Govern-
 ment still assumes most of the risk.
 Aside from principle, the sales had their
 practical aspects. By disposing of a lot of
 mortgages,  the  expenditure  side      of  the
 administrative budget, as well as the deficit,
 could be reduced.  And that would leave
 room,  on paper  anyway,  for  more  Great
 Society programs.  Of course it was a little
 deceptive, but how many voters understand
 the workings of high finance?
 However    many    such  well-versed voters
 there may be, quite a few members of the
 electorate plainly don't care much for high
 interest rates. As evidence of that, a num-
 ber of Democratic politicians have largely
 built their careers by campaigning for ever-
 low interest charges.
 That being true, it must have been a little
 embarrassing to some people the other day
 when  $530  million  of  Federally  owned
 mortgages were offered at an interest rate of
 5.75%. It's a good bit more than the Gov-
 ernment has to pay when it sells its own
 securities;  several Republicans were quick
 to claim that the Democrats had now be-
 come the exponents of high interest rates.
 The high rate also promises to divert funds
 from the savings and loan industry and the
 housing market, thus slowing their growth.
 While a little slower growth might be de-
 sirable after years of exuberance, you don't
 find many Democratic politicians saying so.
 If they want to, the Democrats can point
 out that the Republicans also sold off plenty
 of mortgages during the Eisenhower Admin-
 istration, but we don't think they will find
 this  any  great consolation.  When  you're
 stuck in a tangled web, it doesn't matter
 much who first began to weave it.
 CRACKS IN THE FACADE OF
 ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
 (Mr. CURTIS (at the request of Mr.
 BucHANAN)  was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, cracks are
 beginning to appear in the Nation's
 facade of economic prosperity. Over the
 past year, there has been a sharp re-
 duction in the rate of increase of our
 standard of living as a result of higher
 taxes and price inflation.
 The Wall Street Journal on June 21.
 1966, pointed out that between the sec-
 ond and third quarters of 1965 "real"
 income per capita grew $47.  The in-
 crease fell to $29 between the third and
 fourth quarters and to only $13 between
 the fourth quarter and the first quarter
 of 1966.
 The slowdown in the growth of per
 capita personal income adjusted for tax
 increases and rising prices is already
 having effects on the economic outlook.
 Unless checked, the growth of the econ-
 omy itself will level off in the coming
 months. Even worse, inflation may con-
 tinue or even accelerate. The decline in
 "real"  spendable  earnings  will  spur
 union leaders to make unusually large
 wage demands during the heavy bargain-
 ing that is scheduled for next year.
 The slower growth of consumer pur-
 chasing power is already having its
 effects on the economy.  The personal
 savings rate has fallen substantially in
 recent months, putting even more up-
 ward pressure on interest rates that
 already are at historically high levels.
 Retail sales also are increasing less
 rapidly than last year, while surveys of
 consumer buying plans indicate a level-
 ing off of purchases in the coming
 months.
 In an inflationary environment such
 as exists today, this news should draw
 some cheers. Indeed, this would be the
 case if it were the result of a conscious
 effort by Government to reduce excessive
 demand by reducing or deferring non-
 essential civilian spending.
 Today, however, inflationary excesses
 themselves are braking economic growth
 and, at the same time, creating pressures
 for inflationary wage demands next year.
 If military spending is then increased in
 the face of an emerging wage-price
 spiral, the Johnson administration will
 face a Hobson's choice of its own making.
 It will be forced to permit galloping in-
 flation, apply harsh and painful mone-
 tary and fiscal restraints or seek au-
 thority to impose wage-price controls.
 No matter what the policy choice, the
 American people will lose.
 The situation that is building up to-
 day is what the minority members of
 the Joint Economic Committee warned
 against in their annual views contained
 in the committee's 1966 annual report on
 the Economic Report of the President.
 In that report, we said that failure by
 the administration to take timely and
 effective action against inflation would
 lead to a recession next year.
 Since then, the administration has
 followed a policy of drift and delay, re-
 lying largely on the wage-price guide-
 posts.  The guideposts, however, have
 proven not only ineffective, but they
 came under such sharp attack from,
 economists that they are now all but
 dead and buried.
 Except for the increase in payroll and
