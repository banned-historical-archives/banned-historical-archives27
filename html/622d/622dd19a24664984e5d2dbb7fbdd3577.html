 COMMUNIST CHINA:   Eyewitnesses report that out-
 ward calm prevails in Peking, but other unusual de-
 velopments suggest that the leadership crisis is
 unresolved.
 Press reports state that preparations for low-
 key celebrations of National Day on 1 October are
 going forward in the parks of Peking,c and also that
 Canton television will carry a "special and impor-
 tant" newscast tomorrow night about the "ci cum-
 stances" of the National Day commemoration.   1
 There is no heightened military presence
 in the capital nor any sign that the Peking garrison
 troops are on alert status.
 Despite the air of calm in Peking, behind-the-
 scenes tension within the ruling politburo apparently
 remains high.   Three military leaders on the polit-
 buro were in the party that saw Vice Premier Li
 Hsien-nien off when he departed for Hanoi, but other
 top-ranking military figures, including army chief
 of staff Huang Yung-sheng and air force commander
 Wu Fa-hsien, have been out of public view since the
 major leadership meeting convened on 12 September.
 There is no new information on Mao Tse-tung?s
 health, but a recent report concerning heir-designate
 Lin Piao suggests that uncertainty over Lin?s phys-
 ical condition, or perhaps his future political role,
 may be a crucial factor in the current leadership
 crisis.   This impression has been reinforced by the
 refusal of the Chinese ambassador in Ottawa, Huang
 Hua, to comment on rumors concerning Lin during a
 conversation with a Canadian foreign affairs officer
 on 23 September.   :Huang, who appeared tense, point-
 edly dodged two direct queries on Lin?s health and
 answered the second query by saying that Mao?s health
 was excellent when Huang last saw him,   Huang left

 traditional National Day holiday banquet  os a                   by
 Premier Chou En-lai would be held as scheduled on
 30 September.  This event may not shed any further
 light on Mao or Lin?s status, because neither usually
 attends the banquet.   Although the decision to hold
 this affair probably is intended to convey an im-
 pression of normalcy, Peking's postponement of other
 scheduled activities suggests that the regime antic-

 USSR:   The top three Soviet leaders are con-
 tinuing to add new destinations to their already
 crowded fall itineraries.
 General Secretary Brezhnev, following his
 visit to Yugoslavia, unexpectedly flew to Budapest
 to brief Hungarian leaders on his talks with Presi-
 dent Tito.   He arrived in Sofia on Sunday to make
 a similar report to Bulgarian officials.
 Premier Kosygin reportedly has added Morocco
 to his October schedule, possibly between his pro-
 jected visit to Algeria and his 17-27 October trip
 to Canada. The US Embassy in Ottawa has received a
 number of hints that Kosygin may be interested in a
 visit to the UN and perhaps meetings with the "highest"
 US officials during or after his Canadian stay.   The
 Soviets have already asked the Canadians if they would
 be "unhappy" if Kosygin were to visit the UN after
 leaving Canada..

 YUGOSLAVIA-USSR: General Secretary Brezhnev's
 talks with President Tito last week produced a state-
 ment of intent to improve relations but probably did
 not allay Yugoslav suspicions of Soviet intentions.
 The joint statement signed on Saturday calls
 generally for increased party, government, and eco-
 nomic cooperation.   Belgrade, however, will watch
 closely for follow-through on promises of the Soviets
 to soften their critical attitudes toward Yugoslavia's
 experiments in political and economic reform, to
 pursue reciprocity in information agreements, and
 to help ease tensions in the Balkans.   On the latter
 point, Brezhnev agreed that a nuclear-free zone in
 the Balkans "could be" a means of stabilizing peace
 in the area.   This position still falls short of
 Yugoslav and Romanian demands for a renunciation of
 the use of force in the Balkans.
 The agreement mentioned the 1955 Belgrade and
 1956 Moscow declarations which guaranteed Yugoslav
 party and government independence, but the agree-
 ment did not specifically satisfy Tito's desire for
 a clear-cut Soviet hands-off policy toward his coun-
 try.   Throughout the visit,  there were indications
 of Yugoslav uneasiness over Brezhnev's ambiguity on
 Yugoslav sovereignty and the Brezhnev doctrine.   The
 face-to-face talks last Thursday and Friday reportedly
 were difficult and Brezhnev abused protocol several
 times by keeping Tito waiting.   The final communique
 was cool, mentioning only an exchange of views on a
 wide range of problems.
 After his departure Saturday, Brezhnev flew to
 Budapest and on Sunday to Sofia, where he probably
 briefed local leaders on the effects of the joint
 agreement on their special interests in relation
 with Yugoslavia.   Each of these countries has fig-
 ured prominently in the pressures on Yugoslavia
 this past summer.

 USSR-UK:   Moscow has reacted to London's ex-
 pulsion of 105 Soviet citizens for espionage with a
 predictable protest of outraged innocence and threats
 of retaliation.
 In a statement presented to the British ambas-
 sador in Moscow yesterday, the Soviet Foreign Ministry
 officially protested the British action, branding it
 as "groundless" and "fabricated."  The statement fur-
 ther declared that the expulsions were the latest
 manifestation of Britain's policy of creating obstacles
 to detente, particularly in European affairs.   It also
 charged that the move was an attempt to cover up ac-
 tivities by British "special services" against the USSR,
 including Soviet institutions and personnel in Britain.
 The Foreign Ministry statement warned that if the
 British measures are left in force, the USSR "will
 have nothing to do but take corresponding measures of
 reply."  TASS meanwhile is quoting British press re-
 ports that the ouster "may entail very serious con-
 sequences for London."   In the past, the expulsion of
 Russians for espionage has led to retribution in kind;
 however, the magnitude of the British move and the
 possibility of further expulsions elsewhere in the
 West may temporarily stay Moscow's hand--though prob-
 ably not its public media.
 The thrust of Moscow's reaction seems as much
 directed against the timing and, politics of the
 British action as it is at denying the charges.  The
 expulsions may at least temporarily set back current
 Soviet diplomatic initiatives in Western Europe  the
 Conference on European Security in particular.

 NORTH VIETNAM - COMMUNIST CHINA:   The current
 visit to Hanoi by a high-level Chinese politburo
 delegation, although billed as a routine aid mission,
 appears to have an essentially political purpose.
 The Chinese initiative itself--sending politburo
 member Li Hsien-nien and his aid team to Hanoi rather
 than having the Vietnamese come hat-in-hand to Peking--
 suggests that more than the annual aid protocol is in-
 volved.
 In terms of timing it comes shortly before the
 scheduled visit to Hanoi of Soviet President Podgorny.,
 The Vietnamese are responding enthusiastically,re-
 f erring to the delegation as one of "friendship,"
 comparing it to Chou En-lai's visit last March, and
 are highlighting Chinese support for Hanoi's war aims
 rather than Peking's material aid.   The tenor of Li's
 banquet speech on 24 September is especially pleasing
 to Hanoi ears.   He engaged in the kind of harsh de-
 nunciation of US motives that Hanoi is currently using,
 characterizing US imperialism as the "most ferocious
 enemy of our times" and criticizing the Nixon adminis-+1
 tration for making "noises about a peaceful settlement
 while continuing its war of aggression" in Indochina.
 Li also offered unqualified support for Hanoi's nego-
 tiating posture and reassured the Vietnamese that the
 destiny of Indochina would indeed be decided by the
 "peoples of the three Indochinese countries."
 The Li visit appears to be another Chinese effort
 to assuage Vietnamese anxieties generated by the an-
 nouncement that President Nixon had been invited to
 Peking.   For about a month thereafter, Hanoi engaged
 in unprecedented polemical lecturing of the Chinese,
 accusing them of consorting with the enemy, abandoning
 friends, and not being true revolutionaries.   These
 attacks stopped on 22 August as suddenly as they had
 begun, and by mid-September the Vietnamese were delib-
 erately avoiding public criticism of Peking.                                Hanoi
 press media,  for example,edited out the anti-Chinese
 comments of a visiting Japanese Communist delegation.
 The Li visit thus restores, at least for public pur-
 poses, the image of Peking-Hanoi solidarity unmarred
 by any Vietnamese apprehensions over any possible
 Chinese effor      mediate the Vietnam war in talks
 with the US.

 BELGIUM:   Strife within the Socialist and
 Social Christian coalition parties has forced Prime
 Minister Eyskens to call national elections for 7
 November,  seven months ahead of schedule.
 With only two weeks before the reconvention
 of parliament, the government agreed to dissolve
 both chambers.  To assure governmental continuity
 during the electoral campaign, the cabinet will
 resign only upon the formation of a new cabinet
 after the elections.
 Eyskens blames the international monetary
 situation and an expected billion-dollar deficit
 in the country's 1972 budget for the current polit-
 ical crisis.   Actually,  the approaching electoral
 deadline had accelerated the centrifugal forces
 within the coalition.
 Eyskens, leader of the Social Christians, was
 unable to maintain order within his own party.   The
 Flemish faction, backed by the Flemish press, had
 previously indicated an unwillingness to act this
 fall upon the legislation most desired by the
 Socialists--a cultural pact, the institution of
 regional economic bodies,  and a bill resolving the
 disputed situation in six bilingual communes along
 the country's linguistic frontier.   In early July,
 Eyskens had promised these provisions to the So-
 cialists and the opposition :Liberals in return for
 their support of his program for constitutional
 revision.   The government's existence largely de-
 pended on the fulfillment of this bargain.
 The politically confident Walloon (French-
 speaking)  Socialists,  led by party co-president
 Leburton, have been eager to test their strength
 before the holiday season.   More specifically,
 competition between Leburton and the current vice-
 premier, Andre Cools, for the position of prime
 minister has propelled the party in this direction.
 The intensely ambitious Leburton, to further his

 with the Social Christians on the recent implementa-

 Christians precipitated the crisis.

 UN-DRUGS:   Deterrents to international traf-
 ficking in drugs will provide the focus for the
 four-week meeting opening today in Geneva of the
 UN's Commission on Narcotic Drugs .(CND).
 The CND, a subsidiary of the Economic and
 Social Council, is expected to pay considerable
 attention to US-suggested amendments to the 1961
 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.   The basic
 thrust of these proposed amendments is to give
 the International Narcotics Control Board  (INCB)
 mandatory powers in, areas where it currently can
 only request voluntary compliance.  A number of
 countries have expressed reservations, maintaining
 that the measures would constitute a significant
 infringement on their sovereignty.  They appear to
 have special concern over the proposal that the INCB
 be able to impose a narcotics embargo against nations
 incapable of preventing major illicit activity.  A
 high-level diplomatic conference set for March 1972
 will review and take final action on the suggested
 amendments.
 The recently completed draft convention on
 psychotropic (mind-bending) substances complements
 the 1961 legislation by identifying 32 chemical-
 origin drugs not regulated a decade ago that are
 regarded by the international community as dangerous
 today.   The most notorious example in this category
 is LSD.   The commission is likely to seek more rat-
 ifications--a total. of 40 are needed--to the new
 convention in the hope that it can, enter into force
 soon.   Most observers believe that will occur during
 the first half of 1.972.  There has been some concern,
 however, that international controls over the psy-
 chotropic substances will be inadequate--weaker
 than US suggestions for amending the 1961 convention.
 The less developed countries, primary producers of
 the "natural" drugs. regulated by the 1961 convention,
 maintain that the new legislation affects less harshly
 the developed nations,  in which most psychotropics
 are manufactured.

 The CND is certain to seek more backing for
 the UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control.  The fund was

 expected to be used to expand greatly the drug-

 especially the Food and Agricultural Organization,
 which is developin  economic alternatives to illicit
 opium production.

 UN-AFRICA:   Today's special Security Council
 meeting on South-West Africa could prove to be
 highly contentious.'
 Impetus for this session was provided by the
 International Court of Justice  (ICJ)  in June, when
 it issued an advisory opinion upholding the 1966
 decision of the General Assembly to terminate South
 Africa's mandate over the territory.   The Organiza-
 tion of African Unity  (OAU)  is pressing for UN ac-
 tion in the wake of the ICJ's ruling and has called
 the Council meeting at this particular time in order
 to share the spotlight with--and compel the atten-
 tion of--the high--level representatives of the major
 powers who will be on hand in New York.   The delega-
 tion from the OAU consists of its chairman, Maurita-
 nian President Ou].d Daddah, and several foreign min-
 isters.
 Ould Daddah delivered an acerbic speech against
 the Western powers on Friday, and more of the same
 may be in store today.  A draft report on South-West
 Africa will be submitted to the Council by its ad
 hoc committee on the territory, despite the lack of
 agreement on some sections in the text.   The Africans
 are likely to focus on the unresolved points, which
 include a call for UN sanctions against Pretoria
 should it--as is certain--refuse to withdraw from
 South-West Africa    Another critical issue on which
 no agreement was reached in committee involves in-
 terpretation of the Council's embargo on arms sup-
 plies to South Africa.                               The Africans have not, how-
 ever, given any sign that they will push for South
 Africa's expulsion from UN membership.
 The Council session on South-West Africa, com-
 bined with the planned high-level OAU mission to
 Western Europe next month,  is indicative of the Af-
 ricans' desire to obtain some kind of satisfaction
 on "colonial" subjects, which also involve apartheid
 in South Africa and the other white redoubts of Rho-
 desia and the Portuguese territories.   Among these

 the one likely to engender the biggest squabble in
 the Assembly this fall is the African bid to have
 spokesmen of the liberation movement designated to
 represent the Portuguese territories in the Addis
 Ababa - based UN Economic Commission for Africa.
 All moves to delay the issue have failed so far,  and
 the Africans may well have the votes to secure the
 designations they desire.   If successful, this tac-
 tic could lead to similar efforts on behalf of l'b-
 eration movements

 INDIA-USSR-PAKISTAN: Mrs. Gandhi's brief visit
 to Moscow, scheduled to begin today, is expected to
 be devoted largely to discussions regarding East
 Pakistan.   Indicative of the :Likely subject matter
 was the arrival in Moscow on 23 September of D. P.
 Dhar,  an official of the Indian Ministry of External
 Affairs who has been closely associated with formu-
 lation of India's policy toward Bangla Desh.  Mrs.
 Gandhi, in her talks with Soviet leaders, presumably
 will be seeking further commitments of diplomatic,
 economic, and possibly military support, pointing
 out that domestic pressure on her government to "do
 something" regarding East Pakistan remains high.
 Bengali refugees--.now numbering over nine million,
 according to Indian sources--continue to stream
 across the border?   The Soviets, however, are likely
 to urge caution on the Indians, as they apparently
 have done on more than one occasi(11_.5.1J1= the crisis
 erupted in South Asia last March.
 CAMBODIA:   The attack on US Mission personnel
 in Phnom Penh yesterday is the most serious'incident
 so far in the Communists' terrorist campaign against
 the US presence in the capital.   Two Americans were
 killed and another ten wounded at a recreation cen-
 ter near the embassy by explosives apparently thrown
 by motorcyclists.   Earlier this month there were an
 abortive attack on the US ambassador and several un-
 successful attempts on other US Embassy and military
 personnel in Phnom Penh.   Enemy elements in areas
 just north and northeast of Phnom Penh have recently
 become bolder and they may be responsible for the
 recent attacks in the ca ital.

 JAPAN:   The raid by a handful of radical stu-
 dents into the grounds of Emperor Hirohito's palace
 on 25 September is the latest example of a new stu-
 dent willingness to engage in terrorist acts that
 fly in the face of popular Japanese attitudes.   In
 other recent incidents extremist youth groups have
 inflicted on police forces numerous casualties and,
 at the Narita airport disturbances, three deaths.
 The police are concerned that several of the larger
 youth groups are now forsaking their traditional
 ritualistic protests in favor of extremist activity
 involving lethal weapons.   They are also concerned
 that the use of such tactics during the mass demon-
 strations expected after the Diet convenes in mid-
 October could lead to widespread violence.   Such a
 development could readily compound the Sato govern-
 ment's anticipated difficulties with the Diet over
 the Okinawa treaty and relations with China.
