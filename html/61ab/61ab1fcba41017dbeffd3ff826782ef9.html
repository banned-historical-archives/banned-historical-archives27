 checked. Tha first of t7iese is "an administra-
 tive imbalance between our ability to take
 military risks and our ability to take polit-
 ical risks." The FORUM study charges that
 reforms  in  the  Defense  Department  have
 given military planners a bureaucratic ad-
 vantage over the cluster of civilian agencies
 charged  with  economic  and  political  ele-
 ments of foreign policy. As a result, "blind
 bureaucratic momentum" shifts policies in
 favor of solutions recommended by the De-
 fense Department. This explains why "Amer-
 scan policy can drift towards military solu-
 tions where political ones will suffice; Amer-
 ican youth can die because its elders lack de-
 cisive civilian leadership."
 "It is meaningless for officials to talk of
 America's desire for peace and fora 'polit-
 ical  solution',  so  long  as  administrative
 means  to  implement  these  hapea  are  not
 known to exist " the study says. It charges
 that there has been no public indication of
 contingency plans for a realistic settlement
 in Vietnam.
 CONGRESSIONAL  WEAKNESS
 'Phe Ripon study also shows that Congress
 has been unprepared to check the Executive
 Branch  on  Vietnam.  "Congress  has  had
 neither the staff nor the machinery to assert
 its prerogatives in the making of  Vietnam
 policy. Its right to be  consulted has  been
 compromised into a right to ratify ... Con-
 gress' right to know has been reduced to the
 right to be briefed."
 The Ripon study says that President John-
 son has tended to  exploit Congress' weak-
 nesses  by a style of "secrecy and silence."
 It accuses him of relying on a "contrived
 atmosphere of crisis" and of blitzing Con-
 gress with questions, "the answers to which
 are  predetermined  by  carefully  controlled
 briefing."
 REPUBLICAN RESPONSIBILITY
 Because of the weakness of Congress and
 failure of the President to reform and co-
 ordinate  civilian  policy-making  agencies,
 Ripon charges that Vietnam policy is made
 by a "self-entrenching bureaucratic coalition
 that cannot be reformed from within" It
 calls for partisan action by the Republican
 Party  to  correct  the  "fiasco"  of  American
 policy ffi Vietnam.
 Republicans,  the  Ripon  study  says,  can
 grasp the realities of local politics in South
 Vietnam and need fur checks and balances
 in Washington. It charges that "the best men
 and  the  best  minds  are  not  making  this
 country's foreign policy."
 "In 1982," it co-ncludes, "the Republican
 Party demonstrated its  ability to extricate
 the United States from a war on the Asian
 mainland.  "The  issue  now is whether the
 American people think our present course in
 Vietnam is worth more deception, more re-
 sources, more lives. If they do not, there is
 an alternative:'
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant
 to the order of Friday, the Chair recog-
 nizes the  Senator  from  Pennsylvania
 [Mr, CLAax], for a period not to exceed 1
 hour.
 ~H~ABM DECISiON-A $5 BILLION
 INVESTMENT IN AN INEFFECTIVE
 SYSTEM
 Mr,  CLARK. Mr. President,  today I
 desire to address the Senate on the deci-
 sion of the administration to deploy a
 sa-called thin anti.-ballistic-missile de-
 fense at a cost of $5 billion.
 I submit that from the evidence it is
 clear  that  this  vastly  expensive  new
 weapons system essentially Contributes
 nothing to this country's security. I uxge
 the administration to reconsider its de-
 cision, which I believe to be wrong on
 three  counts-militarily,  economically,
 and diplomatically.
 The best arguments against ABM de-
 ployment has been made by Secretary
 McNamara   himself.   The   Secretary
 pointed out in his San Francisco speech
 that there is no ABM system which can
 be built-no matter how much we spend
 on it-which would not be, and I quote
 t]le Secretary's own words, "ineffect:ive
 against a sophisticated Soviet offen:se."
 Even .if we were to spend $40 billion or
 more on a so-called massive system, the
 resulting increase in our security against
 a Russian attack would be zero, accord-
 ing to the Secretary of Defense. The re-
 sult would be a waste of a great deal. of
 money at a time when the war in Viet-
 nam is costing us $21/z billion a month,
 when the President is asking for new
 taxes to offset a growing budget deficit,
 and our crucial domestic programs are
 being reduced to support the increases in
 the military budget. What would we get
 for our money?Avery expensive flying
 "erector set" which the Russians could
 easily and cheaply overpower by increas-
 ing their offensive missile striking force.
 The argument that the so-called thin
 system is justified by the approaching
 t):lreat of Chinese nuclear-tipped missiles
 simply does not hold up. We have the
 capacity to devastate China many times
 aver if her leaders should be so faolisll as
 to initiate a nuclear exchange with us,
 and the Chinese know that. That fact is
 at the  heart of  the deterrence  policy
 which  has  guided  American  military
 strategy since the beginning of the nu-
 clear age. Our strategy has been to deter
 a first strike against ourselves by mak-
 ing it plain to any would-be aggressor
 that our second strike against him would
 be utterly and horribly devastating. Is
 there anyone who seriously believes that
 the Chinese Government would not be
 effectively deterred by that prospect?
 I discussed this subject informally the
 other day with the President's scient:iflc
 adviser, Dr.  Hornig.  After he said he
 agreed  thoroughly  that  there was no
 point in building an antiballistic missile
 system against a possible Sovet threa,t-
 in other words, he agreed with Secretary
 11ZcNamara-I said to him, "Well, i:f it
 urould not be any good against the Rus-
 sians, why do we need it against the
 Chinese?" "Well," he said, "the only basis
 is that maybe the Chinese are more ir-
 rational  than  the  Russians,  and,  of
 course," he said, "that is not a scientific
 problem; that is a question of politiicai
 judgment."
 I think it is perfectly clear that practi-
 cally everybody except the military-~in-
 d:ustrial  complex,  which  would  profit
 from the building of this system, is of
 the view that to build the system against
 the  Chinese,  realizing  it  is  no  good
 against Russia, just does not make any
 sense at~all. I think there is no one who
 seriously believes that the Chinese Gov-
 ernment could be effectively deterred by
 a.n anti-ballistic-missile system.
 The second flaw fn the argument is
 the assumption that a thin ABM sysi;em
 would be effective against the Chinese
 for any appreciable .period of time. Even
 if it is conceded that a thin defense sys-
 tem would be effective against a Chinese
 offensive missile system which was still
 in its primitive"stage, it is obvious that
 once the- Chinese develop their rocket
 force beyond  the  primitive  stage  our
 ABM system will not be effective. If the
 Chiriese get their rocket assembly lines
 going,  and  develop multiple  warheads
 and penetration aids, they will be able to
 overwhelm our outmoded ABM system
 just as the Russians could overwhelm it
 today.
 How long would that take? Secretary
 McNamara pointed out that the Chinese
 are devoting very substantial resources
 to the development of both nuclear war-
 heads and missile delivery systems. Every
 time our experts have tried to predict the
 next advance in Chinese weapons devel-
 opment they have been wrong-the Chi-
 nese have moved  faster  thaxi  we  ex-
 pected-. No one can say how long the
 period will be between the time the Chi-
 nese deploy their first primitive system
 capable of threatening the United States,
 and  the  time  they  have  developed  a
 larger  and more sophisticated system,
 capable of overwhelming first our thin,
 $5 billion ABM system, and ultimately
 even a massive $40-plus billion system.
 The third fallacy in the logic is the as-
 sumption that even during the so-called
 "safe period" in Chinese nuclear develop-
 ment, we would be genuinely safe from a
 Chinese nuclear attack behind an ABM
 defense. There are many ways of launch-
 ing anuclear attack that an ABM is help-
 less to deter,. A Chinese submarine could
 perhaps deliver a law trajectory rocket
 which would sneak through our radar
 screen, just  as  the  Israeli, Air  Force
 sneaked through the Egyptian radar de-
 fenses. The Chinese could detonate a nu-
 clear bomb underwater near our west
 coast--again from a submarine, ar even
 from a trading vessel-where the prevail-
 ing winds would sweep the cloud of dead-
 ly radioactivity ashore. Or, James Bond-
 ish as it sounds, miniature bombs could
 be hand-carried into our cities in suit-
 cases and detonated. If the Chinese are
 foolish enough to risk the total devasta-
 tion  of  their  country  by  launching  a
 rocket strike against us, what is keep-
 ing them from attacking us in any of
 these ways? The answer is obvious-de-
 terrence, effective deterrence of all forms
 of nuclear assault.
 The inevitable conclusion is that the
 .proposed thin $5 billion system simply
 will not do the job which its proponents
 say it will do. That, of course, is bad
 enough-squandering  $5  billion of the
 taxpayer's' money on a useless system is
 no light matter. But the problem is worse
 than this. For"there is, as Secretary Mc-
 Namara  said,  a  "mad momentum in-
 trinsic to the development of all new nu-
 clear weaponry." That mad momentum,
 generated in part by the decision to go
 ahead with the  deployment of  a thin
 system, is already gathering force, as the
 Secretary  foresaw,  and  as  indeed  I
 warned him in a letter I wrote to him on
 June 15, 1967, in which I said:
 As a practicing politician, I would like to
 comment on this proposition that the United
 Btates should: build and deploy a "light" ABM

 defense. In my own view, I see no way of hold-
 ing back pressure for a full or "heasv" ABA!
 defense once a "light" system  has been ia-
 stalled.
 ^,'here is plentiful evidence  that the
 curtain has already gone up on this new
 tragedy. We are only now in act I, with
 the squandel?irig of $5 bLllion, the equiva-
 lent of  1 million jobs under the emer-
 gency  employment  program  which  Z
 sponsored and which was approved by
 the full Senate Committee on Labor and
 Public Welfare. How long will it be be-
 fore we see $40 or $50 or $60 billion go
 down the drain in an orgy of misguided
 spending?
 The most painful costs, however. can-
 not be counted in dollars. They are the
 diplomatic costs-the resulting increase
 in tensions between the United States
 and the Soviet IInion  which  this new
 escalation of the arms race is bound to
 provoke. As Victor Zarza pointed out not
 long ago in the Washington Post, the
 most likely effect of our decision to be-
 gili  ABM  deployment  will  be  the
 strengthening of the hard-liners in the
 Kremlin  in  their  continuing  see-saw
 battle with the mot?e peace-oriented ele-
 ments in the Soviet leadership.
 This decision will not spur the Rus-
 sians to come to agreement on limiting
 defensive and offensive missiles. It is far
 more  likely to  jeopardize  the  pending
 talks and crush the hopes for an arms
 control agreement which mere generated
 by the Glassboro conferen~e-
 The only gainers from our action will
 be the members of the political militafy-
 industrial complex on both sides-in the
 Soviet Union, and in this country. The
 Russian generals, their allies in-the Com-
 munist Party, and the men who direct
 the  Soviet  defense  industry  will  gain
 status and prestige  at the expense of
 their colleagues. Their counterparts in
 the United States will have something
 more tangible to show-fantastic profits
 for the contractors, and new stars on the
 shoulders and stripes on the sleeves of
 the military men who will be in charge
 of the program.
 The story is in the stock market re-
 ports for anyone who is interested to see.
 Where is the ABM money going to go?
 Raytheon, up 411/a  to 91 ?ia on Monday,
 September 18, the day of the hicNaanara
 speech. Aerojet General, up 4g~ to 331$
 on the same day. Strong rising trends
 have been just as visible in other major
 ABM contractors-Thiokol, Martin Mar-
 ietta and Sperry Rand. The vast new de-
 fense pork lunch-wagon-maybe the big-
 gest ever-has begun to roll, and the in-
 vestol?s on the stock market know it.
 Who are the losers? All of us, everyone,
 and particularly those who will be hard-
 est  hit  by  the  fact  that money  that
 should be going into the effort do rebuild
 our cities and heal the wounds in our
 society-or possibly, if you take a more
 conservative point of view, to provide the
 funds which will make a tax increase un-
 necessary;  or,  indeed,  to  provide  the
 funds which, Ln the long run, might make
 further tax decreases possible-is being
 drained. off to build Armageddon instead.
 Americans who will  be  deprived  of  a
 chance  to get an adequate  education,
 necessary health care, a decent place to
 live,  a  chance for a  job,  for  Lack of
 funds-they will be the biggest losers.
 Thane higher up  the income ladder
 will be losers because of the increased
 taxes which they will have to Fay, or
 through the failure to receive the tax
 decrease to which they might otherwise
 be entitled. But the real, ultimate lasers
 are every man, woman and child an this
 planet whose lives are menaced by the
 threat of nuclear war, and whose only
 hope  for  genuine  security  lies  in  the
 ameliur?ation  of  tensions  between  the
 great nuclear powers and the negotia-
 tion of effective agreements to halt the
 madness of the arms race and turn man-
 kind toward Ltre path to peace.
 Mr. McG{3VERN. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. CLARE. I am happy to yield to my
 friend from South Dakota.
 Mr. IricGOVERN. Mr. President, I have
 very little Lo add to what the Senator
 from Pennsylvania has said, other than
 to tell him how much I appreciate not
 only the courage,. but beyond that, the
 conunnnsense that he demonstrates here
 today: because he has taken on one of
 Lhe most wasteful and, in my judgment,
 most:  dangerous  proposals  that  have
 been :suggested in a tang tithe. I quite
 agree with him when he says that, far
 from adding to our security and to Lhe
 chances for stability between the great
 powers. the introduction of the sa-called
 ABM system really adds another dan-
 f;erous  nea?  dimension  that  threatens
 both our security and the peace of the
 world.
 cane of the tlii4tgs that has puzzled me
 ntnst.  about  this  whole  discussion  as-
 snciaGYi with the ABM Ls the seeming
 paradox  between  the devastating case
 that the Sceretary oP l3efense has built
 against. just such a system over the last
 few .cars, having added to it as recently
 as January 25 of this year in his state-
 ment: before the Senate Appropriations
 Committee  on  defense  appropriations.
 and the rather strange endorsement of
 such a proposal the Secretary made in
 his spr~ch at San Francisco.
 I believe Lf one looks at that speech
 carefully, 90 percent of it is a devasta-
 ting, and, I think, unanswerable argu-
 ment against the ABM system.
 Mr. CLARK. If the Senator will yield
 briefly. I thoroughly agree with tam. My
 heart bleeds for Secretary  McNamara,
 who,  as  I  think  anybody  who it1te11I-
 gently reads his speech must sec, is doing
 what he is told to do, despite the fact that
 his convictions are otherwise.
 The  argument thsG we are building
 this ABM system against an anticipated
 Chinese attack is completely lacking hi
 conviction,  as  far  as  Secretary  Mc-
 Namarft's  feelings  come  through  his
 actual words.
 Mr. McGOVERN.  Would the Senator
 agree that the :senior editor of Newsweek
 ma.~azine, Mr. Edwin Diamond., describes
 well, in the October 2, 1967, issue of that
 magazine,  R?liat  has  happened  i:t  ex-
 plaining this paradoxical situation with
 reference to our Secretary of Defense?
 He also refers to a column by Mr. James
 cotuset,t to have printed in the  RECORD
 the editorial  entitled,  "Tae Grind Il-
 lusion," to which I have referred.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was oidered tc be printed in the ltecoxn,
 as follows:
 TrIE  fiRAVD  ILLt7~ION
 (By Edwin Diamond)
 Secretary Mci`amara's decision to go ahead
 with au anti-ballistic-missile (ABM)  >ystem
 fs  based  on  a  set  of  brilliantly  reasoned,
 highly sophisticated, and strongly pe:?euasive
 arguments.  But the  dectsion is wrong,  and
 the  consequences  of  this  error  will burden
 every American for years to come.
 Instead of  strengthening t11e national se-
 curity,  the  AB11i  decision  may  well  under-
 mine  t;,  for  It  upsets  the  present  3ellcate
 balnncc  of  nucl~7ar terror baste on tae twin

 nuclear-arms race w:Iich ma?~ lead to a re-

 ably mad. But in destroying at one stroke
 both  the  hated  "modern  revisionists"  and
 tho "American imperialists" Mao surely dis-
 played a certain genius in his madness. He
 was doubtless acting according to one oP his
 favorite precepts, from Sun Tzu's Art of War:
 "Malec  a Noise in  the  East,  Attack in the
 West."
 The Chinese, of course have never acknoyvl-
 edged  their rele  in the catastrophe, which
 utterly  destroyed  the  world's  two  greatest
 powers. Given the wichallenged global domi-
 nation  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China
 today, the Chinese role, on. orders of the PM,
 may  only  be  mentioned  in  a  Mast  Secret
 document,  such  as  this  one--Dostroy  an
 Reading.
 This little nightmare is not, of course, a
 prediction  of  things  to  come,  And  yet,  as
 the colloquy between Senator Pell and Gen-
 eral  Wheeler  indicates,  there  is  no  purely
 technical reason why something of the sort
 might not take place. According to the in-
 telligence estimates, by the early 1970's the
 Chinese Communist intercontinental missile
 capability will still be rudimentary, but the
 Chinese by then should have been able to
 stockpile  a  considerable  number  of  multi-
 megaton  thermonuclear  devices.  A  three-
 megaton device should weigh oxi the order of
 one  ton,  and  could  easily  be  carried in  a
 truck.
 We Americans bathos a stubborn illusion
 that everybody else .must do it our  way-
 because we depend on an elaborate. and im-
 mensely costly missile system to deliver nu-
 clear warheads, we assume that every other
 country must do likewise. The above night-
 mare may sea?ve as a reminder that there are
 more ways than one to skin a .cat-or kill a
 country. Finally, it may also be worth noting
 that most  U.S.  intelligence experts  believe
 that the senile genius, Mao Tse-tung, is al-
 ready, to a degree which cannot be precisely
 determined, insane:

 THE NEED TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS
 TO  FIGHT  WATER POLLUTION-
 AMENDMENT
 AMENDMENT NO. 393
 Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am sub-
 mitting  an  amendment  to  the  Public
 Works appropriations bill to appropriate
 the full $450 million which the Congress
 unanimously  authorized  last  year  for
 Federal grants for the construction of
 waste treatment works.
 In passinl~-the Clean Waters Restora-
 tion Act of  1966, the Congress made a
 firm commitment to the American. peo-
 ple to help in the battle against the pol-
 lution of alit Nation's lakes and rivers.
 This is no time to back down from that
 commitment.
 Our budget is strained by the rising
 costs of the war in Vietnam and it is ap-
 parent that there will have to be some
 budget cuts made. However, it does seem
 to me to be false economy to cut back
 on this important program.
 Last year it was estimated that $3.5
 billion was needed over the next 5 years
 for the Federal Government to meet its
 share of the responsibility for the costs
 of construction works. Section 8 of the
 Federal Water Pollution Control Act was
 amended by the Clean Waters Restol'a-
 tian Act of 1966 to authorize appropria-
 tions of $150 million for fisca11967, $450
 million for fiscal 1968, $700 million for
 fiscal- 19~i9, $1 billion for fiscal 1970, and
 $1.2~billion for fiscal 1971,
 Because the Congress authorized $450
 million for fiscal 1968 for the construc-
 tion of sewage treatment works; many
 State and local governments went ahead
 with their planning for pollution abate-
 ment based on that authorization. Many
 municipalities have already passed bond
 issues in order to provide their share of
 the costs.
 Our programs to abate the disastrous
 pollution of our waters are just picking
 up momentum and now is not the time
 for the Federal Government to renege
 on its promises. To withhold funds. now
 will cost us much more in the long run.
 There are numerous examples of the
 need for more Federal money. I will not

 not. seem grudertt for the SLa-e of Wisconsin
