 LEADERSHIP AND INDOCTRINATION OF RURAL CADRES IN CHINA
 [Comment:  This report presents infor:,:ation from the Chinese mono-
 graph Nun      un Chih- ueadJu-ho Ling-tao Cunhun  Shen -ch' an( How
 Rural
 Party Branches L     the Masses in Producth   -c ion-, edited by the
 Propaganda Department, Liaotung Co uittee, Chinese Communist Party,
 and published (probably in Mukden) by the Tung-pei Hsin-hua Shu-tien,
 November 1949.
 Included is a discussion of the role of the ch'u party committee
 in guiding the operations of the rural party branches, an outline of
 some problems faced by rural party cadres in performing their duties;
 and : sketch of the indoctrination programs used by party committees
 and branches to correct the ideological deviations of cadres and to
 increase the cadres' effectiveness as propagandists, model workers,
 and party workers.h
 Ch'u Party Com.ittee Leads the Party Branch
 The ch'u party co:,, ittee is the highest echelon of the rural party apparatus,
 and all party branches in the ch'u are subject to its leadership.  Consequently,
 the quality of the work of the party branches in the countryside depends pri-
 marily on the quality of the leadership of the ch'u party committee.                                                            Therefore,
 if the branches are to perform well, the leadership of the ch'u party committees
 over the branches must be strengthened.
 If the ch'u party committees are to do their work properly in relation to
 the branches, the following factors must be considered:
 Comrades in the ch'u Tarty committee must intensify their study.  They
 must study various party policies. particularly production policies, because
 their primary task will be leading the masses in production.  Only by fully
 grasping the meaning of the various policies can the com.ittee instruct the
 branch members on how to propagandize these policies, and teach them to perform
 their work satisfactorily and in confor:.ity with party policies.
 Moreover, comrades must study the methods of leadership. For instance,
 they should know the responsibilities of each member.  They should know the
 responsibilities of the ch'u secretary, and the organization, propaganda.and
 other committees.  Meetings should be held regularly so that experiences may
 be exchanged, shortcomings corrected, and important matters discussed.  Members
 should know their individual responsibilities.  Responsibilities must be divided
 among the members, each member rust assume his share of work, and the work must
 be coordinated.  This is collective leadership.
 Since most of the ch'u party committees are made up of new and inexperienced
 rural cadres, it is imperative that they study party policies and leadership
 methods to elevate the-:selves and develop their own leadership.  Consequently,
 there must be a system set up for study and work in the co-ziittee.
 All work must be done through the party branches.  The ch'u committee
 should lead the branches, but many ch'u committees have actually done the
 work which should be done by party branches, because the co::mittees did not
 want to take the trouble of discussing these jobs with the branches.  Ch'u
 committees should neither monopolize the work nor leave it entirely for the
 branches to do.  The committees should first take up.what has to be done,
 decide how it is going to be done, and then take it up with the branches.  This
 should be clearly explained to the party branches so that each member will know

 how to carry on indoctrination and propaganda in government organs, peasant
 associations, and other mass organizations.  Through propaganda by the in-
 dividual party members, the masses can be persuaded to take part in fulfilling
 the party branch work programs.  The task of the ch'u committee, therefore,
 is to lead the party branches and train the branch members in assuming their
 individual roles as propagandists and model workers.
 Ch'u party committee members should not just sit at their desks and do
 paper work.  They must visit the branches and observe their weak and strong
 points and help them solve their irmnediate problems.  If they see certain
 strong points in a particular branch, these should be disseminated to other
 branches. If they observe any weakness in a particular brar.ch, they should
 call this to the branch's attention and have it corrected.
 Fiaally, com.ittee members must constantly instruct party members.  The
 ideology of party members should be regularly investigated.  For instance,
 after the liberation of the Northeast and the completion of land reform in
 the old revolutionary bases, some cadres were lax in their struggle against
 the landlords and had elements in connection with production.  Some cadres
 thought they were superior to others and were undemocratic in their working
 style, and although some cadres knew they should lead, they did not know
 how.
 Various methods may be used to educate party members.  When committee
 members visit and investigate the branches, they can hold membership meetings
 to study problems and party courses.  Another method is to have ten party
 members operate a training class for party members for 3-5 days.  Aside from
 discussing problems, the hsien can be asked to send a few persons to partici-
 pate in the classes.
 Provides Guidance
 With the adoption of the principle of voluntary participation in produc-
 tion groups this year, cadres are asking whether the need for leadership and
 guidance still exists.
 To answer this question, it is important to know that the principle of
 "voluntaryism" does not mean that the peasant can do as he pleases.  At the
 same time, it is essential to understand that leadership does not mean
 forceful compulsion.
 Many peasants were forced to join  production groups (i.e., mutual aid
 teams] last year.  As a result of forcing peasants to join these groups,
 production did not meet expectations.  This year, the principle of voluntary
 participation has been adopted.  However, this does not mean that cadres
 will no longer need to direct the masses.
 Some cadres have the wrong conception of leadership.  Leadership does
 not mean the use of force; instead it involves the use of persuasion.  Cadres
 must work with the masses and take time to study and help the masses solve
 their production problems.  If a cadre sits at this job as a foreman and
 merely issues orders without considering whether these orders can or will be
 carried out, the cadre is guilty of bureaucratism.  In such cases, force is
 the only method of getting orders carried out.  But, if force is used, the
 masses thereafter will be afraid of the cadre, will have no contacts with
 him, and will lose confidence in him.

 In recent years, we have been using force, but we have not succeeded in
 increasing production. As we adopt the principle of "voluntaryism" this year,
 cadres should exercise their leadership in the following manner:
 1.  It is imperative for cadres to know that leadership in production is
 not an easy task.  At times, leadership involves troublesome details which
 cannot be avoided, and which must be fearlessly faced and overcome.  Cadres
 must be patient, hold their tempers, and carry out their responsibilities
 steadily and unhurriedly.  Bureaucrat ism must be avoided.
 2.  Cadres must be enlightened about the meaning; of "voluntaryism" and
 know the importance of production.  They must be told that "voluntarysm"
 does not mean "nonproduction"; instead it means greater production.  If the
 masses have any problems, they should se taken up and solved imaediately.
 Merely holding a mass m.eetin  to air problems will not solve them.  If any
 proble:s arise this year, the party branches will take up the problem first;
 then the representatives conference will discuss the matter.  After a decision
 has been made by the representatives conference, cadres and party members of
 the ts'un government coacnittee will divide the responsibility of carrying out
 the decisions through the cells.  In this way, any problems or anxieties of
 the classes can be handled on a collective basis and solved through the leader-
 shin of the cadres in the cells.
 3.  There must be an equitable distribution of manpower and draft
 animals in the various production groups.  Some groups have no draft animals
 but ample manpower and vice versa.  This situation must be corrected through
 the proper allocation of each.
 4.  There should be a leadership core in each production group.  This
 group should consist of party activists and model workers.
 Introducing a New Indoctrination Y an
 A party membership conference recently convened by the party committee
 of Wang-ch'ing-men Ch'u, Hsin-pao Huien, exhibited a new democratic spirit
 and a new method of indoctrination that deserves attention and adoption in
 other localities.
 This educational procedure contains a number of outstanding features.
 In the first place, each part: member takes the initiative of presenting his
 own ideological problems for discussion among the members.  After ideological
 problems are thoroughly discussed by the members, a preliminary summary of
 the discussion is prepared.  The party leaders then discuss the preliminary
 findings of the members and draw up a final summary of the ideological problems.
 These problems can include anything from difficulties of party members at home
 on account of their party work to difficulties they have with their nonparty
 friends in carrying out party programs.
 After the final summary is drafted by the party leaders, a meeting is
 called for the members to engage in "self-introspection" [confession] and
 criticism and  self-criticism.    Through  these meetings,  the  members
 obtain  a  new  ideological  outlook,  and relate their ideology to reality.
 After these meeting are held, a system of rewards is set up to arouse the
 members to action.  Following the use of this new method of indoctrination,
 the ideological problems of the members were basically resolved, and the be-
 havior and work of the members improved.

 Of course, this method as applied in Wang-Ch'ing-men Ch'u was not
 perfect. The meetings for members to bring out their own ideological
 problems could'have been conducted in a more orderly manner.  This new
 indoctrination procedure is being started in many municipal and hsien
 programs and training classes.  It is regretable that many more party
 leaders have not promoted this procedure.  The procedure is still in
 its early stages, and it is hoped that other localities will take similar
 action and report on their experiences.
 Indoctrination of Rural Party Members and Cadres
 This spring [1949], the party committee of Hsin-pao Hsien, Liaotung
 Province, held training classes for rural party members and party cadres.
 During the plowing season, classes were again held on two separate occasions.
 Some preliminary results and valuable experiences were gained from these
 training classes.
 Many rural cadres do not desire to remain cadres.  They feel that the
 masses are not active and that the time they spend working with the masses
 is wasted.  They complain that while others produce and become rich, they
 remain poor.  As a result, many cadres want to give up their positions.
 Although the leadership is concerned about this and is carrying on ideological
 instruction, there are still some cadres who are not active and enthusiastic
 in their work.  These are the problems which had to be considered in preparing
 the educational program for these classes.
 Some of the personal problems of the students were solved either before
 the classes began or during the opening ceremonies of the classes.  The
 students discussed their own problems freely, and their views were evaluated.
 Gradually the political consciousness of the students was awakened.  To
 awaken the political consciousness of the students, to help them obtain a
 revolutionary philosophy of life, to guide their future, and to strengthen
 their confidence in their own work, it was necessary to establish in their
 minds the attitude of service to the masses, a class attitude, a workers'
 attitude, and a materialist and an organizational outlook.
 The teaching methods first called for the sti-Aents to discuss freely
 their practical everyday problems.  Setting aside the trivial problems raised
 by the students, the teacher then selected and guided discussion of the most
 important problems.  These problems were debated until some conclusions are
 reached.
 The contents of the training classes were oriented to the ideological
 level of the students.  Before each lecture began, the teacher reviewed
 problems of the previous day's lecture.  Each new lecture was related to
 some of the problems posed in the previous lecture.  Lectures were inter-
 spersed with discussions.
 The content of the courses was also oriented to the everyday problems
 of the cadres and to their actual experiences.  Textbooks selected were those
 which deal with the class outlook of leading personalities, including Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung's essays on the philosophy of life.
 During the first week, the lectures dealt with two problems:  Did you
 want to take this training? and How to study?  Questions such as, "Is it
 worthwhile to be a cadre?" and "What are some of the hardships of being
 a rural cadre?" were discussed.  Such discussion revealed some of the
 ideological problems of the students and some of the personal hardships of
 the rural cadres.

 Some of the difficulties confronted by cadres are as follows:
 1.  The masses are not active and enthusiastic; cadres are scapegoats;
 meetings are difficult to handle; some people say they are good, some say
 they are bad.  Some of the family dependents of military personnel and war
 heroes do not pay their grain taxes and do not follow leadership.
 2.  Family hardships -- While other families have material goods and
 become model workers, cadres are poor.
 3.  Pressure -- If work is incomplete, superiors criticize the cadres;
 if it is completed, cadres are accused of being undemocratic and of using
 force to get the job done.  In the spring, when land must be surveyed [for
 land ref?rm], the peasants want to cheat the government regarding the size
 of their farms.  There are so many types of people to handle, and if you
 do not please them, they insult you.
 4.  As a cadre in the rural areas, you confront difficulties everywhere.
 If you are too active the people dislike you; if you do not show your
 authority, they say you do not know how to handle affairs.  If you hold
 meetings, some will ridicule you and accuse you of holding meetings for
 ulterior motives.
 5.  The wealthy landlords outwardly are afraid to start any trouble,
 but the poor peasant and hired farmhands are the ones who are difficult to
 manage.  The veterans and their families are difficult to handle; since
 they are well organized and have earned merits through their service, it is
 difficult to tell them anything.
 6.  The disunity among the cadres makes life difficult.  When there is
 internal disunity, everyone seeks credit for work that is well performed
 and blames others for mistakes.
 7.  If a cadre does his work well, he receives no encouragement.  If
 he does his work poorly, he will certainly hear from his superiors.
 8.  A cadre not only has to do his work properly, but he must also work
 "democratically" and in line with "policy."
 The disclosure of these difficulties faced by cadres reveals why so
 many cadres are disheartened and discouraged, and why some of them question
 the value and advantage of being a cadre.  Following the discussion of these
 individual problems of cadres, other aspects of a cadre's life were discussed.
 These were some of the questions asked of the cadres:
 1.  As cadres, what merit did you earn?  What have you done for the
 masses?
 2.  Has anyone praised you for your services?  Why do people say you are
 no good?
 These two sets of questions prompted the cadres to discuss some of their
 achievements.

 Some cadres spoke of their participation in the guerrilla war, and how
 they served as spies, guides, etc.  Others said that, under the leadership
 of the party, they directed the struggle of the masses against the feudal-
 istic elements of the countryside.                                                             Some said they led the masses in increasing
 agricultural production to fulfill Communist production policies and quotas.
 Sore women cadres said they encouraged the youth of the countryside to  ;oin
 the army, and even encouraged their husbands to join.  Others spoke of their
 leadership in organizing winter schools and encouraging the ::.asses to attend
 them.  Some pointed out that through their efforts the land survey was
 completed.  The transfer of land to the peasants, increased grain production,
 and the paying of grain taxes were cited as accomplishments of the cadres.
 Finally, the cadres spoke of their work in enlightening the masses, and how
 they were selected to serve as cadres by the villagers.
 After discussing the various accomplishments of the cadres, the atmosphere
 of the meeting and the attitude of the cadres changed.  They became more
 conscious of the fact that the hardships and difficulties of a cadre are offset
 by their accomplishments, and that although some people will hate them, others
 will like them, and that tears and laughter go together in their work.
 As the atmosphere and attitude of the cadres changed, the discussion turned
 to other problems, namely, who will take over our jobs if we quit?  If the masses
 are not active, what can we do to change them?  Short of using force, what steps
 can be taken to activate the masses and to eliminate their lethargy?
 These were some of the suggestions offered by the cadres:
 1.  Fine the masses for failure to carry out directions.  Cadres should
 also be fined for their failure to perform duties assigned their..  By fining
 the cadres as well as the peasants, the latter will see that the system of
 fines is equitable.
 2.  Point out to the masses the ill effects of not following policies and
 programs.  A simple illustration of this point is the calamity of famine that
 once resulted because the peasants would not follow the production policies of
 the party.
 3.  Teach the masses by being a model worker yourself, and point out the
 accomplishments of other model workers and cadres.
 4.  Instruct the masses through criticism and self-criticism, and report
 the good works of individuals as well as criticizing their shortcomings.
 For individuals who refuse to be enlightened, it is necessary for cadres
 to explain to them the meaning of democracy, democratic centralism, the need
 for the individual to follow the rules of the majority, and that force can be
 applied to individuals who refuse to follow the decision of the majority.
 With these ideological problems settled, the cadres then discussed means
 to remove hindrances to their work.  These hindrances include too many meetings
 and too many detailed and miscellaneous duties to perform in the rural areas.
 The time consumed in handling the affairs of the dependents of veterans 'alone
 keeps the cadres from performing their regular duties.  Finally, the personal
 economic hardships suffered by the cadres and their families hinder their work.

 STAT
 Since these are inevitable hardships that cadres must face, they must
 increase their "study" of party policies, take a more active role in leading
 production, agitate and arouse the masses, and discuss the work program with
 the masses to secure their approval.  Once their approval is secured, the
 cadres must unite and carry out decisions resolutely.  Responsibilities must
 be shared by the cadres; the number of meetings must be cut down.  All these
 steps will help remove the practical obstacles that hinder the cadres' work
 in the rural area.
 However, removing these obstacles will not suffice unless the individual
 cadre eliminates such ideological obstructions as "careerism" and "individual
 glory," and creates within himself a "revolutionary" philosphy of life.  The
 cadre must know what he is living for, see the fallacy of living for material
 things alone, and cast away the philosophy of "eat, drink, and be merry, for
 one knows not what the morrow brings."  The evils of being satisfied with the
 status quo and refusing to make progress must be criticized.  Finally, to
 remove these ideological obstacles, cadres must be indoctrinated with ideas
 of serving the working class and dedicating their lives to the struggle of the
 working class and Communism.
