 The Red Bri ades:
 The Red Brigades, founded in 1969 by a group of young Marxists
 disillusioned with the Italian Communist Party, have evolved into Italy's
 most formidable terrorist organization. Their primary goal is to separate
 Italy from the rest of Europe, ultimately creating a true Marxist state. The
 Brigades have traditionally focused their terrorism on domestic targets and
 issues; the kidnaping of General Dozier was a departure.
 Prior to the Dozier operation, there were only 100 to 150 full-time Brigade
 members, and probably not more than a dozen key leaders. The Brigades
 were geared to conduct a few, well-orchestrated campaigns each year,
 normally in the fall and spring. Operations were designed to appeal to
 certain constituencies, inspire adherents, and gain recruits. At the time of
 the Dozier kidnaping, the Brigades were attracting only a few dozen
 recruits each year. The quality of recruits was progressively deteriorating
 as students and intellectuals were replaced by dropouts and criminals.
 The Red Brigades actively maintain and appear to seek foreign connec-
 tions, but these have been of modest importance. There is no convincing
 evidence that the Brigades respond to orders from abroad. West German
 and Palestinian terrorists have provided weapons, but the Brigades do not
 require extensive or advanced arsenals. Training consists primarily of
 target practice.
 Nor is there hard evidence of any external financial support for the
 Brigades. In the past, finances came largely through bank robberies and
 ransoms and, perhaps, through connections with organized crime and
 narcotics traffic. Italian officials say the Brigades are now hard pressed
 and that members have had to resort to jewelry thefts-a less preferred
 method since the need to fence the goods raises the risk of apprehension.
 While the Red Brigades will probably survive the Dozier episode, they
 could evolve into a different sort of organization. Continued arrests by
 police have taken a toll. Recruiting may replace the losses in terms of
 numbers, but the origins and quality of the recruits will undoubtedly
 change. The entrance of more factory workers and common criminals with
 less ideological commitment and narrower goals-already on the upswing
 prior to the recent crackdown-could ultimately transform the group. It

 might evolve into a militant union gang expressing worker grievances
 through assassinations and sabotage. Alternatively, the Red Brigades could
 gradually lose their political veneer altogether and turn into another Mafia.
 The direction the Brigades take in the immediate future will depend on the
 outcome of internal disputes. A victory by the militarist wing that
 kidnapped Dozier could bring further actions against foreign targets in
 Italy and renewed attempts to strengthen connections with other terrorist
 groups in Europe. The rescue of Dozier and the losses suffered in the
 process, however, could discredit this line of strategy and bring the Red
 Brigades back to the domestic path followed prior to the Dozier kidnap-
 ping. At the moment, the Red Brigades are on the defensive, but Italian of-
 ficials cautiously avoid declaring that they have been destroyed. Officials
 talk instead of a long struggle, and they are probably right.

 This primer is a compilation of baseline information about the Red
 Brigades. To ensure broad distribution, it is being circulated at the lowest
 level of classification consistent with presenting an accurate picture of the
 group's goals, members, and activities. The primary source material for
 this study comes from:
 ? The operational activities of the Red Brigades, which reflect the issues
 that most concern them, the institutions they regard as enemies, the
 people they consider their constituents, and their sensitivity to public
 opinion.
 ? Prolific writings by group members; Red Brigade Strategic Resolutions
 are lengthy (number 18 for instance has 300 pages), offering rich
 analytical insights into the organization and its members.
 Much of the information and analysis in this primer predates the rescue of
 Gen. James Dozier. This event and related Italian police efforts are certain
 to affect the Brigades in ways that are obscure at this juncture. Neverthe-
 less, the primer examines the innards, the external characteristics, and the
 objectives of the organization in which the post-Dozier Red Brigades-in
 whatever mutation-will be rooted.

 The Red Brigades:
 A Primer
 Introduction
 The formation of the Red Brigades in 1969 coincided
 with a time of ferment and violence in Italy. Student
 marches had failed, the barricades had come down,
 and the large Italian Communist Party-which usual-
 ly reaped the harvests of political discontent-had
 turned its back on the "movement," by negotiating
 "historic compromise" with the Christian Democrats
 in a bid to share government power. The leader of the
 neofacist party declared that a civil war had begun.
 Left-wing militants prepared to leave their homes and
 go underground to avoid the massive arrests that
 would come if the fascists returned to power. Some
 dropped out of sight to plan campaigns of terrorism.
 In this setting, Renato Curcio, Margherita Cagol,
 Mario Moretti, and Albert Franceschini joined to
 create a radical terrorist organization to challenge the
 Italian Government. Their organization, the Red Bri-
 gades, has become Ital 's most formidable terrorist
 group
 The kidnaping of General Dozier in 1981 brought the
 Red Brigades international prominence. The abduc-
 tion of the General increased speculation about the
 possibility of a foreign hand directing Red Brigades'
 operations, particularly among Italian politicians,
 whose motives probably were self-serving. No one has
 been able to find even a single piece of convincing
 evidence that the Red Brigades receive orders from
 abroad. The kidnaping of General Dozier was not
 inconsistent with the ideology and strategy of the Red
 Brigades; it was only a departure from their previous
 modus operandi.
 Ideology
 The Red Brigades are true Marxists. Their ideology is
 heavily influenced by the writings of Mao Zedong,
 Lin Biao, Che Guevara, Carlos Marighella, and
 Abraham Guillen. These later writers differ from
 Renato Curcio, the illegitimate son of a maid and her
 employer, grew up revering an uncle who had fought
 as a partisan during the German occupation. Al-
 though the uncle was killed in an ambush by fascist
 gunmen in 1945 when Curcio was not quite four years
 old, he remained an important figure for Curcio.
 From prison, Curcio would later write to his mother
 that he had picked up his uncle's rifle to continue the
 struggle against the fascists. A voracious reader of
 Marx, Lenin, and Mao, Curcio had participated in
 student protests at Trento University.
 Margherita Cagol was the daughter of a middle class
 family. She loved music and Renato Curcio. They
 worked hand in hand in the student struggle. Both
 Catholic, they were married in 1969 and spent their
 honeymoon in Cuba. When her husband was later
 imprisoned, she led a daring raid to rescue him. In
 1975, she died in a gun battle with police.
 Mario Moretti had been a student in Milan. Upon
 graduation, he worked as an electronics technician in
 a factory where he became involved in union affairs
 and leftist politics. He eventually went underground,
 leaving behind his wife and son.
 Albert Franceschini came from a militant Commu-
 nist family. His grandmother had led a peasant
 league in a farm labor struggle in 1922. His grandfa-
 ther had fought the fascists, spent time in jail when
 they ruled, fled to France, and returned to Italy as a
 partisan. Franceschini's father was sent to a labor
 camp under the Germans and ended up in Auschwitz,
 from which he escaped in 1942. Franceschini himself
 joined the Communist Youth Federation, then broke
 with it because it was too conservative.

 Carlos Marighella's Blueprint for Terrorists
 Marighella, in his Mini-Manual of Urban Guerrilla
 Warfare, adapted concepts of rural guerrilla warfare
 described in the writings of Mao and Che and applied
 them to the city. The Mini-Manual exhorts its read-
 ers to wage warfare in the cities and suggests tactics
 and techniques. Marighella, however, does not spell
 out a broad concept of urban guerrilla warfare, nor
 does he explain how terrorist tactics will ultimately
 lead to the seizure of political power.
 Most of Marighella's readers, particularly those
 outside the Third World, miss his point that urban
 guerrilla warfare is a means of diverting government
 forces while rural guerrillas establish themselves in
 the countryside. Those readers include the Red Bri-
 gades, who see armed struggle in the cities as the way
 to revolution. The Red Brigades carry out no actions
 in rural areas, nor do they seek rural support.
 traditional Leninists in that they called for armed
 struggle, and they developed theories of guerrilla
 warfare that would enable militarily inferior groups to
 defeat the armed forces of the state.
 The Brigades believe that social and political change
 are the products of historical forces; developments are
 natural, evolutionary, inevitable, and irreversible. In
 their view, the Brigades themselves represent a natu-
 ral emergence. And they believe that their group will
 eventually triumph because it is correctly aligned with
 political, economic, and social forces that are now
 becoming dominant.
 The Brigades claim no responsibility for creating this
 wave. History determines events, and history is imper-
 sonal. Individuals do not shape events after their own
 design. Significant human action can occur only
 through roles within movements, not through individ-
 ual actions. Individuals require identity and meaning
 only by association with movements, and the move-
 ment is everything. Red Brigade leaders place a high
 premium on central planning, and while commitment
 is valued, suggestions from below are not welcome.
 There is no place for heroes.
 doctrines and false idols of their foes.
 Even though Red Brigade members see themselves
 astride inexorable forces of history, they feel that it is
 necessary to show the state as impotent in order to
 confirm their beliefs and demonstrate the righteous-
 ness of their cause. They delight in exposing what
 they see as the hypocrisy of their opponents. An offer
 by one corporation to make concessions to save the life
 of a kidnaped executive was sarcastically noted as
 evidence that capitalists are not true to their own
 principles:
 ? If profit is the primary objective of corporations,
 why offer concessions out of humanitarian concern?
 ? If humanitarian concerns ,are paramount, why ex-
 ploit workers in the name of profit?
 ? Or do only executives' lives count?
 Commitment to principles allows no compromise.
 There is a religious quality to the Red Brigade
 commitment; they need to demonstrate the superiority
 of their beliefs. Their actions must reveal the false
 Strategy
 The Red Brigades follow a variety of strategies, with
 terror as the essential element. They have a better
 picture of their opponents than most other left-wing
 terrorist groups, and they are more attentive to devel-
 oping a genuine constituency within their own coun-
 try. The Brigades are also patient. They are prepared
 for a struggle lasting many years.
 The Red Brigades, like most terrorist groups, are self-
 conscious about their image. They want to appear
 legal, and they use the language of government to
 describe their actions. Hostages are not "killed," they
 are "executed"-and only after they are "tried" and
 "condemned" in a people's court. The Brigades do not
 claim credit for some crime:; because they do not want
 to appear to be ordinary criminals. Initiation and
 training operations carried out by new recruits are not
 claimed, because the risk of failure and of tainting the
 group's credibility is too high.

 Many contemporary left-wing terrorist groups view
 local struggles as part of a global war of liberation
 from imperialism. The class enemy of the proletariat
 is not the "national bourgeoisie," but the international
 "imperialist bourgeoisie." Thus, a connection is pro-
 vided between an urban guerrilla struggle in Latin
 America, a rural guerrilla struggle in southern Africa,
 the Palestinian struggle in the Middle East, and
 terrorist actions in Western Europe. This connection
 broadens the range of targets and has been used to
 justify terrorist attacks against Western diplomats,
 executives of foreign corporations, and American
 military personnel in Brazil, West Germany, and,
 most recently, Italy. The mainstream of the Red
 Brigades have viewed the international connection as
 solely rhetorical.
 In the Red Brigade view, multinational corporations
 are the operative arm of the imperialist bourgeoisie.
 These outgrowths of capitalist society move freely
 across national borders, while the state provides the
 support system. The Red Brigades are committed to
 overthrowing both the state and the multinational
 corporations.
 The Red Brigades believe that their capitalist enemy
 is entering an irreversible process of deterioration that
 will end with civil war and the inevitable triumph of
 the proletariat. Efforts to restructure the economy can
 only create new crises, particularly in Italy, which the
 Red Brigades see as the weak link among Western
 countries. Thus, Italy must be economically and
 politically separated from the rest of Europe. It must
 not, however, become part of the "socialist-imperial-
 ist" area. The Red Brigades do not see Poland as the
 model for the new society
 Italian Communist Party (PCI) compromises with
 Italy's Christian Democrats are seen by the Brigades
 as revisionist. Because the PCI has defaulted in its
 task of establishing a Communist society, the Red
 Brigades feel they must forge a new Communist Party
 through armed action. This "Fighting Communist
 Party" (Partito Communista Combatante) will repre-
 sent the proletariat and complete the task of over-
 throwing the imperialist bourgeoisie in Italy
 The Red Brigade vision of their final takeover of
 power remains hazy. There is no clear indication of
 whether they see a single battle between the forces of
 "good" and "evil" or a long civil war. Renato Curcio,
 the founder of the Red Brigades, wrote in 1969:
 This is not the revolutionary movement in which
 the takeover is an immediate problem to be consid-
 ered, but rather it is a period of organization of
 political power. It is adventurism to make people
 believe that the takeover ofpower and the attain-
 ment of an egalitarian society is something easy
 and rapidly obtained. We must on the other hand
 continuously underscore that it will be difficult
 and long. It is not the Cuban example but the
 Chinese example that faces us. That is, it is not
 possible to realize the "happy island" with two
 years of struggle. But it is possible across 40 years
 of struggle.
 Organization
 The lowest unit of the Red Brigade organization is the
 cell, which consists of three to five part-time terror-
 ists. Several (usually two) cells comprise a brigade. A
 brigade may have as many as 15 members. Each
 brigade reports to a column which consists of regular
 and part-time terrorists. Each column has responsibil-
 ity for a specific geographic area, and each reflects
 different tendencies. We know of active columns in
 Rome, Milan, Venice, and Naples; there are other
 columns in Turin and Genoa, and there is a column
 inside Italy's prison system referred to as the Prison
 Front. Areas without columns are managed by Re-
 gional Revolutionary Committees, the seeds of future
 columns. In 1980, there were Regional Revolutionary
 Committees in Bologna and Florence.

 The Red Brigades have two support units called
 "fronts":

 research. It consists of three special interest units
 that investigate operational opportunities; the Fac-
 tory Brigades focus on the industrial area; the
 Political Party Brigades provide information on the
 political arena; and the Triple Brigades concentrate
 on police, judicial, and prison affairs.
 ? The Logistics Front supports all of the columns. It
 provides weapons, ammunition, documents, commu-
 nication equipment, and has charge of codes. It also
 disburses salaries and provides medical treatment.
 In addition, the Logistics Front identifies possible
 targets for theft. Some operations (arsenal thefts
 and armed robberies) may be carried out jointly by
 members of the Logistics Front and members of the
 local column.
 Columns and fronts report to the Executive Commit-
 tee.                            two representatives
 from each column belong to the Executive Commit-
 tee. The Executive Committee:
 ? Approves all operational plans submitted by the
 columns.
 ? In large operations, assumes direct operational
 control.
 ? Is in charge of finances; each column submits a
 quarterly budget to the Executive Committee,
 which then directs the Logistics Front to make
 disbursements.
 ? Is in charge of liaison with other terrorist groups in
 Italy and elsewhere.

 At the top of the Red Brigade organization is the
 Strategic Directorate. It meets only a few times a year
 to set policy and strategy, which it communicates in
 its lengthy Strategic Resolutions. Members of the
 Executive Committee, columns, and fronts are all
 theoretically represented. Italian officials estimate
 that the Strategic Directorate has at least 10 mem-
 bers, but actual control of the organization may be in
 the hands of no more than five of the most expe-
 rienced and able managers.
 The role played by the imprisoned members of the
 "historic nucleus," the founders of the Red Brigades,
 is not clear. In the late 1970s, the Red Brigades
 considered that any member who had been captured
 was considered demobilized. Red Brigade members in
 prison reportedly lose their decisionmaking power.
 Most observers, however, believe that the founding
 fathers still play an important leadership role. Several
 are believed to still hold membership in the Strategic
 Directorate, and the members of the historic nucleus
 imprisoned at Asinara (a maximum security prison
 located on a small island off the coast of Sardinia)
 prevailed in the 1979 dispute with leaders of the
 Rome Column. Forty-one Red Brigade members now
 imprisoned at Palmi are known to have voted on
 another factional dispute shortly before the Dozier
 kidnaping.
 The organization evolved by the Red Brigades has
 certain advantages. By allowing two persons to repre-
 sent each unit at the next higher echelon, the organi-
 zation can recover more rapidly from individual ar-
 rests. The hierarchy of cells, brigades, and columns
 permits growth. The structure creates many small
 group leaders and allows a degree of local autonomy.
 It keeps new recruits at the fringe but allows for the
 promotion of the most dedicated. Its top management
 is comprised of men who have direct operational
 responsibilities.
 The organization of the Red Brigades implies a more
 formal hierarchy than may exist. Column leaders,
 front leaders, members of the Executive Committee,
 and members of the Strategic Directorate are. often
 the same people. Although theoretically there are 25
 to 30 management positions, there probably are not
 Decisionmaking begins with discussions within the
 Strategic Directorate regarding the future direction
 of Red Brigade operations. On the basis of these
 discussions, the Directorate issues a major document,
 usually a numbered Strategic Resolution. In these
 Resolutions, the leadership assesses current condi-
 tions in Marxist terms, describes the situation of the
 Red Brigades, and provides the political line for the
 next offensive. Targets are identified, but only in a
 general way. Strategic Resolution No. 17 issued in
 the summer of 1981, for example, identified NATO
 as a future target. These documents are descriptive
 and interpretative; they do not provide specific oper-
 ational guidance or enjoin Red Brigade members to
 act. Translation of Strategic Resolutions into march-
 ing orders requires an additional step, probably at the
 level of the Executive Committee.
 In accordance with the line laid down in the Strategic
 Resolutions, the Front of the Masses identifies possi-
 ble targets. Then the columns select the target and
 plan the actual operation. The operational plan is
 submitted to the Executive Committee for approval.
 If the Executive Committee approves the plan, it
 mobilizes the necessary resources, augmenting the
 column with support from the Logistic Front and, if
 required, from the Executive Committee itself The
 Fronts, under the direction of the Executive Commit-
 tee, are the principal coordinating bodies of the Red
 Brigades.
 The entire Executive Committee may remain in
 permanent session during a major operation. It did so
 during the Moro kidnaping and probably also during
 the Dozier kidnaping. A decision to kill a captive
 almost certainly involves consulting the Executive
 Committee or polling the columns.

 are made by a few dominant individuals.
 Operations
 Red Brigade activity follows a seasonal pattern, with
 peaks in the spring and fall corresponding to the
 group's announced spring and autumn campaigns.
 Each campaign has a theme which is described in a
 Strategic Resolution that precedes the campaign. The
 theme of the spring 1978 campaign was attacking the
 "heart of the state." The Red Brigades kidnaped Aldo
 Moro in March of that year. Strategic Resolution No.
 17 pronounced NATO to be the target of the autumn
 1981 campaign; Dozier was kidnaped in December.
 The Red Brigades operate within a limited tactical
 repertoire. Assassinations, kidnapings, and leg shoot-
 ings account for about three-fourths of their oper-
 ations. Arson, thefts, and a few bombings account for
 the rest. The Red Brigades have not carried out any
 hijackings, nor have they barricaded themselves with
 hostages. They are sensitive to public opinion, and
 they select their targets carefully. During an oper-
 ation, the leader carries the automatic weapon and
 grenades, not simply because of the firepower they
 provide him, but because he is responsible for avoid-
 ing fatalities among bystanders. If an operation seems
 likely to imperil people other than the intended target,
 it is abandoned. On the other hand, when a Brigade
 operation results in multiple fatalities, as when Aldo
 Moro's five bodyguards were killed, it is because the
 terrorists specifically want to use maximum violence.
 Moro could easily have been kidnaped at another time
 when he was not protected.
 Of the 439 actions credited to the Red Brigades
 during the 1970s, about 30 percent were directed
 against people, the rest against other targets. The
 group decided to concentrate its attacks on people in
 1976. During the last five years (1977-81), approxi-
 mately three-fourths of the Red Brigade attacks were
 directed against persons rather than property. While
 this does not include the many bank robberies and
 other thefts for which the Red Brigades may be
 Kidnapings are a major tool of the group. In most of
 their early kidnapings, the Brigades released their
 hostages within a day or two. With the kidnaping of
 Mario Sossi, an Assistant State Attorney, in 1974,
 Red Brigade kidnapings entered a new, more serious
 phase. Their hostage incidents have averaged 55 days
 in duration. In recent kidnapings, hostages have been
 subjected to "trials" and exploited for propaganda
 purposes. Invariably, the hostage is judged guilty and
 condemned. Only then do the Red Brigades announce
 their decision-to release the hostage if concessions
 are made or to kill him.
 In contrast to other terrorist groups, the Red Brigades
 carry out few bombings. Bombings do not suit their
 strategy or philosophy. The group has passed through
 the "armed propaganda" stage, and it now empha-
 sizes such "quality" operations as the kidnapings of
 prominent persons. Bombs are indiscriminate weap-
 ons; they kill bystanders. They are, in the words of the
 group's founder, a "fascist trademark."
 On occasion, however, the Red Brigades have tried to
 use bombs or other less discriminate weapons to kill
 large numbers of carabinieri or police, but without
 much success. In January 1980, members of the Red
 Brigades bombed a carabinieri barracks in Rome, but
 there were no deaths. In May of the same year, the
 terrorists fired a 3.5-inch rocket at a carabinieri
 headquarters in Milan, again without great effect.
 The group also has carried out bombings as diversion-
 ary actions or to support other operations. When the
 Red Brigades have used bombs, the devices have
 generally been small and technically unsophisticated.
 The Red Brigades have employed arson as a mode of
 economic warfare. Between 1975 and 1979, the group
 claimed responsibility for 11 fires at Fiat plants.
 a high percentage of Red
 Brigade attacks were directed against Italy's largest
 private corporations; this includes attacks on persons,

 facilities, and bank robberies carried out for logistical,
 not political, purposes. Of the 184 persons attacked by
 the Red Brigades, law-enforcement personnel-police
 and carabinieri-have been the most frequent targets,
 followed by judges, factory managers, prison officials,
 political figures, blue-collar workers (often low-rank-
 ing union officials), and journalists. The Red Brigades
 have never killed a woman, although they did kidnap
 and humiliate a Christian Democrat Councilwoman.
 The assassinations, kidnapings, leg shootings, and the
 other major terrorist operations for which the Red
 Brigades claim credit represent the tip of the iceberg.
 Italy is also subject to the initiation rites and training
 missions the Red Brigades carry out, the many "mini-
 kidnapings" in which terrorists abduct a factory
 manager, photograph him with a Red Brigade sign
 around his neck, then let him go; the firebombings of
 managers' cars; the office break-ins to gain intelli-
 gence or simply to demonstrate the group's capability
 to strike; the many small acts of sabotage; the beat-
 ings; the telephoned threats; the propaganda oper-
 ations in the factories; the distribution of leaflets; the
 posting of huge banners expressing support for the
 Red Brigades; or the murders of informants in prison
 that are often covered by prison riots instigated by the
 Red Brigades.
 All these actions contribute to a pervasive atmosphere
 of fear. Frightened factory managers distance them-
 selves from corporate decisions. Good workers are
 warned to work more slowly and to think more about
 the safety of their families. Of the hundreds of men on
 a shift, not one sees who puts up a 20-foot Brigade
 banner. Union men are scared; the unions are infil-
 trated. Judges are fearful, and lawyers are reluctant
 to take cases. Informants stop talking. Journalists are
 afraid to write too critically about the Red Brigades.
 The Red Brigades speak of eventual civil war. To
 seriously challenge the state, they must first inspire,
 militarize, and organize their potential followers, and
 they must discipline those followers to the dictates of
 the armed party they want to create. The Red
 Brigades direct each offensive toward that goal. Every
 major operation is calculated to appeal to some
 potential constituency in Italy, to inspire adherents, to
 gain a few recruits, and to purchase political space.
 They kidnap, maim, and kill to build a political
 movement.
 Recruiting and Membership
 The Red Brigades draw their recruits from a deep
 reservoir of disaffected Italians. From the many thou-
 sands of sympathizers-several thousand of whom are
 willing to provide support-the Red Brigades enlist a
 few dozen. The recruiting process is slow and cau-
 tious. It begins with a careful selection of potential
 new members in the universities, the factories, and the
 prisons. The terrorists review the candidate's political
 beliefs, his determination, and his activism. If the
 candidate looks good, the local column authorizes an
 approach.
 The Red Brigades have demonstrated an impressive
 ability to replace their losses. Brigade strength at the
 time of the Dozier kidnaping-100 to 150 full-time
 combatants living underground, plus about 500 part-
 time members who are workers by day and terrorists
 by night-represent a remarkable comeback for the
 group, which suffered serious losses in 1980 when
 police arrested nearly 2, 0,00 terrorists from a variety
 of groups.
 The increased recruitment of factory workers and
 common criminals whose political commitment may
 be weak poses a problem. Because the ideological
 dedication of such people is low, the Red Brigades
 fear that if they are captured they will readily join the
 ranks of the so-called repentants and will provide
 information to the police. Thus, new recruits are not
 brought into the inner circle that provides political
 direction for the group, but are used to perform low-
 level duties
 A new recruit may be asked to commit a crime as a
 test of his bona fides. He thereby becomes a criminal.
 This practice screens infiltrators, since Italian law
 grants no immunity to undercover agents or inform-
 ants working for the government.

 Dissent and Discipline
 Like many other terrorist organizations, the Red
 Brigades suffer from internal divisions and dissent.
 There are continuing tensions between the columns
 and the national leadership. Members often disagree
 on strategy. As noted, divisions also occur along
 generational lines.
 In 1979, when members of the Rome Column at-
 tempted to overthrow the original leaders, the dissi-
 dents wanted the leadership to dissolve itself in a
 broader revolutionary movement. The division was
 essentially an argument between generations. The
 dissenters were second-generation recruits whose
 leaders had served for several years in the Front Line.
 They wanted more freedom of action for the local
 columns, and they rejected big terrorist operations.
 Instead, they wanted many low-level actions related
 to local issues that people could easily understand.
 The dissenting faction also wanted to associate the
 terrorist group with other causes, including the femi-
 nist movement. It rejected the elitism of the older
 generation. It wanted to build a grass-roots organiza-
 tion, encouraging participants to carry out individual
 acts of sabotage. It consisted of populists or "move-
 mentists" typical of the 1970s.
 The historic leadership-the "justicialists"-repre-
 sented the committed revolutionaries of the 1960s;
 they were, and are, the Stalinists of the organization.
 Their political grounding and powers of reasoning are
 superior to those of the dissenting faction. Class
 struggle, not other causes, is for them the central
 theater of combat. They branded the dissenters as
 "economicists," a pejorative term in Marxist-Leninist
 jargon for those who attribute primary importance to
 economic order rather than political issues. A Com-
 munist society, in the historic leadership's view, is
 constructed from the top down, not the bottom up.
 The party leads the proletariat, it does not meld with
 it. Strategic planning, not spontaneity, makes it possi-
 ble to strike at the heart of the state, and strategic
 planning is possible only through central manage-
 ment.

 The historic leadership won the debate, but tension
 remained. The spring offensive of 1981 showed that
 some of the columns were concentrating on practical
 economic issues. The Venice and Milan columns-the
 militarists-kidnaped corporate executives to further
 develop a constituency among factory workers in the
 northern part of Italy. The Naples and Rome columns
 concentrated on political targets. The Red Brigades
 warned of an autumn offensive, but by late fall it had
 carried out no major operations, and observers theo-
 rized that the group was in another period of discus-
 sion and debate.
 While organizational discipline is difficult to main-
 tain, Red Brigades' leaders manage to retain control
 by a variety of means. The opinions of the imprisoned
 historic leadership still carry weight, and their superi-
 or political grounding and intellect make them formi-
 dable opponents in a debate. The organization's care-
 ful recruiting process ensures that only those who
 totally accept Red Brigade principles and demon-
 strate a willingness to obey orders can gain admit-
 tance to inner circles of organization. Careful selec-
 tion for promotion probably further guarantees that
 those who gain leadership positions think alike.
 The Red Brigade leaders are also frontline command-
 ers; this gives them credibility that is important to
 lower echelon leaders and followers. It also means
 that national leaders command men, guns, and other
 resources of their own; they are not without real
 power in an internal dispute. The fronts, particularly
 the Logistics Front, are important levers of internal
 discipline-all columns depend on the Logistics Front
 for money and other kinds of support. And money
 does figure in internal disputes. The Naples Column
 refused to share a $1.2 million ransom it received with
 other columns.
 When other measures to bring the dissidents into line
 fail, the leadership may try to eliminate them by
 informing on them. Italian officials claim that they
 received tips that enabled them to arrest a number of
 dissenters during the debate of 1979. The arrest of a
 dissenter not only eliminates him from the field, but
 brings him into the prison system where the historic
 leaders and the Prison Front exercise more direct
 power. We do not know if dissidents are ever mur-
 dered in prison; repentants who cooperate with police
 are. Members of repentants' families may be threat-
 ened or killed as well.
 Funding
 Salary and support for a full-time Red Brigade
 member probably totaled $1,000 to $1,250 per month
 in 1980. An annual budget for a regular strength of
 100 to 150 would be between $1.2 and $2.2 million,
 plus the cost of supporting several hundred part-time
 terrorists.
 The Red Brigades get funds primarily through bank
 robberies and ransoms collected for kidnap victims. In
 1981 they reportedly robbed' the telephone company
 in Rome of $600,000, and they received a ransom of
 about 1.45 billion lire (about $1.2 million) for Ciro
 Cirillo, the political boss of Naples. Terrorists have
 used links with organized crime for ransom negotia-
 tions and to launder money. The terrorists may also
 obtain funds through their organized crime connec-
 25X1
 tions, and
 the may be                                                                                        25X1

 explosives on an electrical pylon

 Observers have speculated about the possibility of
 external economic support-the USSR is frequently
 mentioned-but there is no solid evidence of outside
 financial support.
 if the Red Brigades had financial patrons, they
 would not be running the risks of bank robberies and
 jewel heists.
 The bank robberies provide most of the Red Brigade
 funding, and Brigadists may be responsible for more
 bank robberies than the Italian police credit them
 with. It is impossible to know how many armed
 robberies they have declined to claim responsibility
 for out of a desire to avoid sullying the Red Brigade
 banner with common criminal activity.
 Sympathy and Support
 Red Brigade operations are calculated to appeal to
 several specific groups of potential supporters:
 ? Marginal or uncertified workers who constitute the
 clandestine labor force.
 ? University students who face poor job prospects.
 ? The street people.
 ? PCI members discontented with the moderate turn
 of the PCI.
 ? Italy's prison population.
 The Red Brigades draw their main support from the
 industrial cities of the north, principally Venice, Pad-
 ua, Milan, Turin, and Genoa. At Porto Marghera, a
 large industrial zone adjacent to Venice and consid-
 ered by many to be the ideological headquarters of
 Italian terrorism, approximately 3,000 workers-
 about 15 percent of the work force-are involved in
 the radical workers' movements that operate outside
 of the unions. They even echo the slogans of the Red
 Brigades in their own leaflets. Approximately 6 per-
 cent of the job applicants at an Alfa Romeo plant in
 the north are rejected on grounds of suspected in-
 volvement with terrorist activity. In another company,
 1 to 2 percent of the workers are considered likely to
 participate in pro-Red Brigade activities. Thus,
 among factory workers, the Red Brigades have a
 sympathetic constituency of 15 percent, of whom up
 to 2 percent might provide some degree of support.
 support the Red Brigades. Autonomia Operaia, a
 radical leftwing movement whose members include
 workers, students, and unemployed young people,
 however, provides an indirect indicator of possible
 Red Brigade support, primarily among urban youth.
 Its membership is estimated to be somewhere between
 4,500 and 10,000.

 According to a poll conducted by the PCI in Turin in       1
 1979, 4 percent of the people were so alienated from    25X1
 Italian society that they were willing to support any
 kind of violent assault on the state. A poll conducted
 by L'Espresso magazine just after the kidnaping of
 General Dozier indicated that nearly 10 percent of the
 respondents thought the Red Brigades fought for a      2 5'0
 better society; 30 percent thought that the terrorists
 pursued just ends, disagreeing only with their tactics.
 Among the 20- to 24-year-olds polled (the age bracket
 of the Red Brigade rank and file), there was even
 more sympathy: 21 percent thought the Red Brigades
 fought for a better society, and 35 percent thought

 consensus with the terrorists' violent line to range
 between 0.5 and 1.5 percent of the electorate (200,000
 to 600,000 individuals).
 The Red Brigades are clearly not without sympathy
 and support in Italy. They have demonstrated this in
 their ability to survive for 12 years, and some observ-
 ers think support for the group had grown, not
 declined, in the year prior to the Dozier kidnaping.
 While the Red Brigades do not have enough support
 to initiate the revolution to which they aspire, they
 have thousands of potential supporters; and these,
 along with the million or so potential sympathizers
 throughout Italy, are well able to sustain the organi-
 zation.

 Foreign Connections
 The Red Brigades maintain contacts with terrorist
 groups in other countries, some of which date back to
 the early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the Brigades had
 hopes of creating a Third International, an alliance of
 terrorist groups in Europe that would exchange arms,
 information, and advice. To further this objective, the
 Red Brigades reportedly participated in a 1977 meet-
 ing in Spain that was attended by delegates from the
 Revolutionary Cells in Germany, Action Directe in
 France, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA),
 the Basque separatists (ETA), and the Breton separat-       25X1
 ists. Although no agreement was reached, ambitions
 for some kind of a coordinated struggle remained.F_~
 In a 1978 Strategic Resolution, the Red Brigade
 leadership noted "the necessity to develop to the
 fullest extent historically possible operational cooper-
 ation, reciprocal support, and solidarity" with other
 elements of "proletarian internationalism." The reso-
 lution specifically mentioned West Germany's Red

 Army Faction (RAF) and France's Armed Nucleus
 for Popular Autonony (Noyau Arme pour 1'Autono-
 mie Populaire, NAPAP). It also mentioned "autono-
 mous movements possessing a socialist nature," in-
 cluding the IRA and the ETA.
 The Red Brigades maintained contact with French
 terrorists and are believed to have participated with
 NAPAP in several bank robberies in France. They
 may also have shared with the IRA and the ETA
 some of the weapons and explosives provided them by
 Palestinians, but this does not appear to have been a
 regular supply channel.
 The Red Brigades have also had contacts with Pales-
 tinian terrorists. Ideological links are not considered
 important in these contacts, however, as the Brigades
 were primarily interested in the Palestinians as a
 source of weapons. The Palestinians have provided
 weapons and explosives to the Red Brigades
 others as having a lower political education.
 Links between the Red Brigades and other terrorist
 groups seem to have been of only modest importance.
 The Third International never came to much, and
 interest dwindled. The Red Brigades are cautious and
 conceited. Red Brigade leaders generally have a
 condescending attitude toward other terrorist groups,
 and on occasion even toward groups within the Red
 Brigades. The Brigades regard themselves as the only

 In the first communique issued by General Dozier's
 kidnapers, the Red Brigades called for cooperation
 with other "European revolutionary forces (ETA,
 RAF, IRA)." There is no firm evidence, however, to
 link the Dozier kidnaping with any foreign terrorists
 or governments. The value of cooperating with foreign
 terrorists may be part of an internal debate within the
 Red Brigades. The "militarist" wing of the Brigades,
 which probably held Dozier, is international in its
 outlook and interested in links with terrorists abroad.
 The "movementist" wing, with which the "milita-
 rists" are apparently at odds, focuses more on social
 problems within Italy. The willingness of the Red
 Brigades to engage in further international operations
 The leader of Dozier's captors claimed links with
 Bulgaria at his trial. We have no other evidence of
 such a Red Brigade connection, or of an active
 Bulgarian role in supporting international terrorism.
 The Red Brigades have received some assistance from
 Czechoslovakia. Ties between Italian Communists
 and Czechoslovakia go back at least to the late 1940s
 when the Italian Communist Party exiled its own

 ic assertions: that Czechoslovakia directs the oper-
 ations of the Red Brigades; that Czechoslovakia or
 the Soviet Union finances the Red Brigades; or that
 Aldo Moro was concealed in the Czechoslovakian
 Embassy while police searched for the kidnapers'
 hideout.
 In December 1980, the President of Italy, while
 vacationing in France, complained to French reporters
 that Italian terrorists were living in France, unmolest-
 ed by French authorities. A common border, the
 existence of elements in France sympathetic to Com-
 munist or fascist causes, and the French Govern-
 ment's adherence to the historic principle of providing
 asylum to foreign dissidents made France an attrac-
 tive refuge for Italian terrorists. French courts have
 not always been cooperative in extraditing those they
 see charged with primarily political offenses. The
 President's remarks angered French officials. To
 soothe French feelings, he later publicly stated that
 the "brain center of the Red Brigades is abroad,"
 pointing his finger at the Soviet Union.
 While there is no question that foreign connections
 are actively maintained, there is no evidence of exter-
 nal financing for the Red Brigades. German and
 Palestinian terrorists have helped out with weapons,
 but the preferred tactics of the Red Brigades do not
 require extensive or advanced arsenals, and most of

 Outlook
 The Red Brigades have been fighting for over 12
 years, insulated only by the network of movements,
 organizations, and armed groups that make up Italy's
 revolutionary left. The rescue of General Dozier, the
 arrests, and the discovery of numerous hideouts which
 have attended the rescue and its aftermath have badly
 wounded the Red Brigades physically and psychologi-
 cally. The terrorist group must for the moment be on
 the defensive; its image of invulnerability has been
 destroyed, its internal disputes intensified. But while
 Italian officials speak of having "turned the corner,"
 they cautiously avoid declaring that the Red Brigades
 have been destroyed. Observers have talked about
 their support drying up, but the fundamental econom-
 ic, social, and political problems that spawned the
 Red Brigades and that have contributed to their
 strength remain unchanged. Italian authorities fore-
 see no imminent victory. Instead, they talk of a
 struggle lasting 10 to 15 years.
 The direction the Red Brigades take in the immediate
 future will depend on the outcome of internal dis-
 putes. A victory by the militarist wing that kidnaped
 Dozier could bring further actions against foreign
 targets in Italy and renewed attempts to strengthen
 connections with other terrorist groups in West Ger-
 many, and possibly elsewhere, and could also inspire
 new groups. However, the rescue of Dozier-the Rea
 Brigades' first major defeat-and the losses suffered
 by the Venice Column in the process, could discredit
 this line of strategy. A victory by the "movementists"
 could bring the Red Brigades back to the domestic

 path followed prior to the Dozier kidnaping. Or the
 Red Brigades could divide, with each faction pursuing
 its own strategic line, perhaps under different names.
 The creation of Front Line provides a precedent.
 Front Line was either created by Red Brigade dissi-
 dents or was a separate organization deliberately
 created by Red Brigade leaders to explore a new
 direction. Thus, if one policy of the Red Brigades
 dissatisfies a certain number of followers, another new
 group could be created to follow a different policy.
 Italian terrorism cannot be viewed in strict organiza-
 tional terms. There are changing themes and shifting
 currents marked by a succession of acronyms.
 The struggle has continued for more than a decade
 without visibly moving beyond successive campaigns
 of terrorism. Some of those who joined the Red
 Brigades because they were disillusioned with society
 in the first place must now be again disillusioned with
 the lack of progress that has been made toward
 transforming society, and with the recent defeats
 suffered by the group. Italian authorities believe
 many terrorists would defect if there were some kind
 of amnesty program that allowed them to come back.
 Italian officials admit that political violence will
 undoubtedly continue to be a problem, but they claim
 that their arrests have eliminated the threat to the
 state. In their view, the Red Brigade leaders presently
 in the field do not possess the political or managerial
 skills to rock the Italian Government with another
 event like the Moro kidnaping, although these state-
 ments were made before the kidnaping of General
 Dozier.
 The authorities are certainly right in one respect: the
 Red Brigades do not constitute an imminent threat to
 the state. They are far from being able to launch a
 civil war, and their constituency is limited. They are,
 however, a continuing irritant on the Italian political
 scene. They create repeated crises for the Italian
 Government and thereby contribute to Italy's political
 instability. Perhaps most dangerous of all, they gener-
 ate pressure for an authoritarian solution.
