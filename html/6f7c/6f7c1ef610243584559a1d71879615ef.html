 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I    I thank the Senator
 might interrupt the Senator from Illi-  also, for yielding time.
 nois, the time now is reserved for the,.:
 Senator from Virginia, (Mr. HARRY F.
 BYRD, JR.) for 1 hour preceding the vote
 on his amendment to S. 245.
 Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent, then, that excerpts
 from Interpretative Rulings 33, 56, and
 70 of the Ethics Committee be printed
 in the RECORD so there will be no doubt
 about the intentions of the Senate and
 the consequences of its action today if we
 approve this resolution. Conflicts of in-
 terest, any appearance of conflicting in-
 terests will remain prohibited.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 INTERPRETATIVE RULING No. 33
 The propriety of outside employment is
 governed by Rule 45. No employee, regardless
 of salary level, may receive compensation
 by virtue of influence improperly exerted.
 Nor may any employee engage in any outside
 business or professional activity or employ-
 ment for compensation which is inconsistent
 or in conflict with the conscientious perform-
 ance of official duties.
 INTERPRETATIVE  RULING' No. 56
 It prohibits Members and employees from
 engaging in any outside business or pro-
 fessional activity or employment for com-
 pensation which is inconsistent or in con-
 flict with performance of official duties.
 INTERPRETATIVE RULING No. 70
 Paragraph 6 of Rule 45 on conflicts of
 interest was intended to severely restrict the
 practice of any profession (for compensa-
 tion) by Senate employees. That paragraph
 states in pertinent part that no Member or
 (full-time) employee compensated at a rate
 in excess of $25,000 per annum shall; a)
 affiliate with a firm or partnership, b) per-
 mit his or her name to be used by such, or
 c)  "practice a profession for compensation
 to any extent during regular office hours of
 the Senate office in which employed."
 Mr. STEVENSON. With the assur-
 ances of the Senators and that under-
 standing, I have no objection to the reso-
 lution which they have offered.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I shall yield 5 minutes of my time
 to the Senator from Alaska.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. was recog-
 nized.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I shall be glad to yield 5 minutes
 of my time to the Senator from Alaska.
 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we
 thank the distinguished Senator from
 Virginia and express our deep apprecia-
 tion to the Senator from Illinois, chair-
 man of the Senate Ethics Committee,
 for his forthright and forceful state-
 ment.
 Mr. STEVENS. I join the Senator from
 New York in thanking the Senator -from
 Illinois for his statement. I point out for
 the RECORD that the rules that are in
 effect concerning conflicts, disclosure,
 and in particular, the association of a
 Senator or employee with firms or pub-
 licly held corporations, remain in effect
 notwithstanding the postponement of
 the date in rule XLIV which will be
 brought about in this resolution.
 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Under
 the previous order, the hour of 11 o'clock
 having arrived, there will be 1 hour of
 debate on the amendment of the Senator
 from Virginia (Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR.)
 to be equally divided between the Sena-
 tor from Ohio and the Senator from
 Virginia.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 clerk will state the bill by title.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 A bill (S. 245) to promote the foreign
 policy of the United States through the
 maintenance of commercial, cultural, and
 other relations with the people on Taiwan on
 .an unofficial basis, and for other purposes.
 ORDER OF PROCEDURE
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, a
 parliamentary inquiry.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator will state it.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I should like to in-
 quire, what disposition was made of the
 matter we have been discussing for the
 last hour?
 Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from
 New York informs his friend from Ari-
 zona that the, matter will be taken up
 following the disposition of the bill be-
 fore the Senate at this moment, which I
 believe is to be at noon today. We shall
 resolve this other matter by 12:30 p.m.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is
 correct. The vote on disposition of the
 Byrd amendment to the bill will occur at
 12 noon. Then the Senate will vote at
 12:30 on Senate Resolution 93.
 Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senate will vote
 by 12:30, I believe.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not later
 than 12:30, the Senator is correct.
 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The Senate resumed consideration of
 the bill, amendment No. 93.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I yield myself 5 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Virginia is recognized.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, what is the pending business?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 pending business of the Senate isamend-
 ment No. 93 to S. 245.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Is not the
 pending matter the amendment offered
 by the Senator from Virginia?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is,
 the Senator is correct.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, the pending amendment states
 this :
 It is the sense of the Senate that approval
 by the Senate of the United States  is
 required to terminate ' any mutual defense
 treaty  between  the  United  States and
 another nation.
 Mr. President, in the heat of debate
 last evening, some of the opponents
 S2297
 attributed to this amendment provisions
 which are not incorporated in any way
 in the amendment. Let me state what the
 amendment does not do.
 First.  The  amendment  does not
 express either approval or disapproval
 of the President's decision to give notice
 under article X of the Mutual Defense
 Treaty between the United States and
 the Republic of China.
 Second. The amendment does not take
 from the President any power he now
 has.
 Third. It does not prevent the Presi-
 dent. from expressing the intent to
 abrogate a treaty.
 Fourth. It does not affect in any way
 the notice the President has given under
 article X, which states:
 Either party may terminate.the treaty one
 year after notice has been given to the other
 party.
 Fifth. It does express the view of the
 Senate that, under the Constitution, the
 President cannot unilaterally  nullify
 a treaty.
 I state again the precise amendment
 on which the Senate will be voting at the
 hour of 12 noon. The amendment reads
 as follows:
 It is the sense of the Senate that approval
 by the  Senate of the United States is
 required to terminate any mutual defense
 treaty between the United States and any
 other nation.
 This, Mr. President, in the view of the
 Senator from Virginia is an extremely
 important matter. It goes far beyond the
 question of Taiwan. The United States
 has  many  very  important  mutual
 defense treaties with many different
 nations.  The Senate  of  the United
 States, by its action today in voting
 down the Byrd amendment, if, indeed,
 the Senate takes that action, would be
 establishing a precedent by saying to the
 Nation and to subsequent Presidents
 that a President, acting alone, can
 terminate a treaty that has become law
 as a result of approval by a two-thirds
 vote of the Senate of the United States.
 Mr. President, in the discussion yester-
 day, the able senior Senator from Loui-
 siana (Mr. LONG) called attention to ar-
 ticle VI of the Constitution. Article VI
 reads thusly:
 This Constitution, and the Laws of the
 United States which shall be made in Pursu-
 ance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which
 shall be made, under the Authority of the
 United States, shall be the supreme Law of
 the Land, and the Judges in every State shall
 be bound thereby, any Thing in the Consti-
 tution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
 notwithstanding.
 Senator LONG then very aptly stated
 this:
 The impression I gather from that article
 is that a treaty signed by the President and
 ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Sen-
 ate is the law, and if you have a later law
 to the contrary, it would supersede that law.
 In case of conflicting laws, whichever law
 is the latest of the two would prevail. That
 is the impression that I have.
 Then, he continues :
 If you want to repeal a law, you have to
 do it with another law. The Executive can
 make agreements, but he is sworn to uphold

 S 2298
 It seems to me that the'distinguished
 Senator from Virginia has raised a very
 nice, interesting, important and far-
 reaching question, and the constitutional
 implications are broad. They are broad.
 It is a question that I think should be
 carefully considered.
 The Foreign Relations Committee has
 indicated that it would hold hearings on
 this matter. I suppose that the distin-
 guished' Senator from Virginia  (Mr.
 HARRY  F.  BYRD,  JR.) would certainly
 avail himself of that opportunity on such
 occasion.
 The constitutional questions are so
 broad, Mr. President, that I would hope
 that the distinguished Senator from Vir-
 ginia, having raised the issue, having ex-
 pressed a strong viewpoint on it, having
 made a case, from his standpoint, that is
 worthy of consideration and attention
 for hearing and study, would consider
 withdrawing the amendment and not
 the law himself, so that he cannot repeal
 a law just by saying "I just don't like the
 law; I am not going to abide by it.
 The Senator from Louisiana continues :
 If one of us tried to do that, we would be
 put in jail. They would say, "You don't have
 the right to decide what law you are going
 to abide by or what law you are not going
 to abide by."
 The Senator from Louisiana continues
 in that same vein, pointing out that a
 treaty, being a law, cannot be set aside
 unilaterally by one branch of the Gov-
 ernment, or cannot be set aside unilater-
 ally by the President of the United
 States, whoever he may be.
 Mr. President, I realize that there are
 many who feel that the President should
 have that prerogative, but under the
 Constitution I think it is very clear that
 he does not have it.
 The purpose of this amendment is not
 to focus on Taiwan, but the purposes of
 this amendment is to focus on the broad-
 er problem of what happens to future
 treaties made by the United States, rati-
 fled by the Senate, with other nations of
 the world.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Will the Senator
 yield for a question?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I yield to
 the Senator from Arizona.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I think it would be
 helpful if the members of the Foreign
 Relations  Committee,  including  the
 chairman, would indicate to those of us
 who support the Senator's amendment
 whether they would approve of the Pres-
 ident abrogating or terminating the
 treaty in which it created the United
 Nations or created NATO.
 I think this is rather important that
 the chairman, or ranking member, or any
 member, say that they want that condi-
 tion to prevail in this country.
 If the Senator would further yield, be-
 cause he just referred to the words of
 Thomas Jefferson which are in our man-
 ual, and we are supposed to live by that
 manual.
 I would like to read what the Supreme
 Court Justice Joseph Story, a very
 ?  scholarly jurist, wrote in his commen-
 taries on the Constitution of the United
 States in connection with treaties:
 This joint possession of the power-
 Speaking of the President-
 affords a greater security for its just exercise,
 than the separate possession of it by either.
 It continues:
 (Iit is too much to expect, that a free
 people would confide to a single magistrate,
 however respectable, the sole authority to
 act conclusively, as well as exclusively, upon
 the subject of treaties ... there is no Ameri-
 can statesman, but must feel, that such a
 prerogative in an American president would
 be inexpedient and dangerous.
 Now, I think that might be right at
 the heart of what the Senator from Vir-
 ginia is talking about and which we do
 not seem to be able to convince the
 members of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee is valid.   ?
 I might further comment that while
 the Constitution is not too precise in
 this field, the words of the Founding
 Fathers are bound with precision in re-
 lation to the power of -the Senate in
 treaties and the power of the President
 in treaties.
 Story adds, in words having equal
 bearing  upon  repealing  or  making
 treaties:
 The check, which acts upon the mind from
 the consideration, that what is done is but
 preliminary, and requires the assent of other
 independent minds to give it a legal con-
 clusiveness, is a restraint which awakens
 caution, and compels to deliberation.
 To me, that is all we are trying to do.
 We want to solve this question, can a
 President of the United States wake up
 in the middle of the night, without talk-
 ing to anybody, and say, "Well, that
 treaty, I don't like that treaty, let's end
 NATO, let's end our association with
 Japan, let's end any of the treaties we
 have," and we have to stand by and put
 up with it.
 We have no power under the argu-
 ment advanced yesterday by members
 of the Foreign Relations Committee, no
 power to act.
 I think it is very necessary that the
 Senator's amendment is put into this
 measure, which I consider to be a good
 piece of legislation, much better than
 we originally had.
 . I think we need the teeth to keep
 consistency with the desires of most
 members of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee that I know to bring back to the
 Congress those powers which left this
 Congress during the last 40 years.
 Here we are playing around with
 something that has never been done in
 the 201-year history of our country un-
 til this President took it on himself to
 do it.
 I just wanted to make those few com-
 ments. I thank the Senator from Vir-
 ginia.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The able
 Senator from Arizona is so right. I
 thank him for his statement.
 Mr. President, I reserve the remainder
 of my time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. RiE-
 GLE). Who yields time?
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I yield
 to the distinguished majority leader.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I thank the distinguished chairman.
 Mr. President, the Constitution reads
 on this particular question, and I am
 reading from paragraph 2 of section 2,
 article II of the Constitution: "He"-the
 President-"shall have Power, by and
 with the Advice and Consent of the Sen-
 ate, to make Treaties"-to make treaties.
 It does not say anything about shall have
 the power to terminate there.
 It would seem to me that the authors
 of the Constitution intended for this to
 be a share in power, meaning by my say-
 ing "this," I mean the terms of the
 treaty.
 If the authors of the Constitution had
 intended that the power to terminate be
 shared, they would have said so. The
 Constitution only talks about making
 treaties, and in that instance includes the
 Senate.
 "He"-the  President-"shall  have
 rower, by and with the Advice and Con-
 sent of the Senate, to make Treaties."
 pressing the Senate to a vote on it at this
 particular time.
 The distinguished Senator from Vir-
 ginia has indicated that the adoption of
 his amendment by the Senate to the
 pending matter would not affect the Mu-
 tual Defense- Treaty with Taiwan, would
 have no impact on that whatsoever. That
 being the case, the distinguished Senator
 from Virginia would lose nothing in
 withdrawing the amendment, inasmuch
 as, in his viewpoint, it would have no im-
 pact on what the President has done to
 terminate in accordance with the provi-
 sions of article X of the Mutual Defense
 ,Treaty-that treaty.
 This is not the proper vehicle for this
 amendment. Mr. GOLDWATER, our distin-
 guished colleague from Arizona, and oth-
 ers-I have not looked over the names,
 -but I do know Of Mr. GOLDWATER and
 others-are pressing this issue in the
 courts; and I think it would be well to let
 the courts make a decision on it. In the
 meantime, the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee                                                                                                 could  conduct  hearings.  Mr.
 HARRY F. BYRD, JR. could send a resolu-
 tion to that committee, and hearings
 could be conducted, evidence could be
 presented, and the Senate then would be
 in a better position, with that kind of
 preparation, to vote on this very broad,
 far-reaching constitutional question.
 If the Senate had intended in a mutual
 defense treaty that the Senate vote on
 its termination, the Senate would have
 written that in as a reservation. The
 Senate approved the ratification of that t
 treaty with its eyes open, with its ears
 open, and knowing full well of the pro-
 visions in article X of the treaty allow-
 ing for termination of the treaty by
 either party.
 Some will say, "Well, who is the
 party?" If the "party," by the constitu-
 tional forebears, had been intended to
 be the Senate, it seems to me they would
 have said so, just as they said that the
 party in making treaties is the Presi-
 dent, by and with the advice and con-
 sent of the Senate. They certainly must
 have foreseen that treaties might be
 terminated, that treaties might even be
 abrogated, that it might be in the inter-
 ests of our own country.to -terminate a
 treaty. They must have foreseen that.
 If they had meant for the Senate to be a

 constrained to believe that they would      approval of the Senate, and I have so
 have had the foresight and the wisdom       said to Mr. Carter in connection with
 to have written that into the Con-
 stitution.
 Mr. President, I simply urge my dis-
 tinguished colleague from Virginia, Mr.
 BYRD, he having raised a very important
 question here, to consider withdrawing
 the amendment at this time and pursu-
 ing it before the Commmittee on For-
 eign Relations. It is a matter that is
 appropriate for thorough consideration
 by that committee.
 No hearings have been held on this
 amendment. There has been no con-
 sideration of it by the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee. Again I say that the
 members of the committee already have
 indicated on the record their willing-
 ness to hold hearings and to give serious
 study to the issue. I think that is the ap-
 propriate manner for dealing with this
 question. I do not believe that the Tai-
 wan Enabling Act is the appropriate
 vehicle. It is not a treaty.
 In the future, if the Senate wants to
 write into any treaty a provision that
 will outline clearly the termination of
 such treaty, or the abrogation of it, that
 it is a question which will have to be de-
 cided jointly between the President and
 the Senate, it can do so. Also, it can say
 in that provision whether or not the
 Senate should terminate by a majority
 vote or by a two-thirds vote, or what-
 ever.
 Without the kind of study that is
 needed, I hope that the Senate would
 not be forced to take action at this
 point, and on this vehicle, on an amend-
 ment that has such far-reaching impli-
 cations. It would be a blanket require-
 ment. In order for all treaties to be ter-
 minated in the future, the approval by
 the Senate would be required. By what
 vote? A two-thirds vote? A'three-fifths
 vote? What?
 It may be in the interests of this
 country-who  knows?-to  terminate
 some other treaties down the road. It
 may be in the security interests of this
 country to terminate some other trea-
 ties down the road. Who knows? We
 may have a Republican President at
 some far distant time in the future, or
 we may have a Democratic President.
 But, whichever, that Presidnet, as the
 Chief Executive of this country, is in the
 best position, I believe-and apparently
 the Founding Fathers thought so-to
 terminate a treaty; and they left it open
 to the Senate to write provisions in any
 treaty. They left it open to the Senate.
 There is nothing in the Constitution
 that prevented the Senate in 1954 from
 writing a provision therein which said
 that either party shall have the power to
 terminate, with the understanding that
 the U.S. Senae, on the part of the United
 States, -shall first approve the termina-
 tion.
 The  constitutional forefathers  left
 that door open for us. They did not leave
 the door open when it came to making
 treaties. They said that the President of
 the United States shall have the power,
 by and with the advice and consent of
 the Senate. The door is closed. The Pres-
 SALT. I said:
 If an agreement is sent up there, -count
 me out. If it is done by way of an Executive
 agreement, count me out-o-u-t.
 I am against it to start with, should
 it be sent in by an agreement. The con-
 stitutional forebears closed the door
 there. It has to be done with the advice
 and consent of the Senate. It would not
 be so with the termination of a treaty.
 They did not say that.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. So I do plead
 with my friend from Virginia, who is a
 very understanding Senator, who is a
 very able Senator, who wants the Senate
 to do the right thing in the interests of
 the United States; and I am sure he be-
 lieves that the right thing can best be
 done if the Senate is well ? informed
 through adequate hearings. If he would
 do that, the Senate then would be in a
 position to proceed with its hearings in
 the Foreign Relations "Committee and
 would not have to cast a vote today,
 when Senators are not prepared. I am
 not prepared. I have my own viewpoint,
 hastily arrived at through reading a
 couple of lines in the Constitution and
 thinking about it overnight. But what.
 other evidence do I have? I need other
 evidence. I need a report on the part of
 the Foreign Relations Committee. I need
 its testimony. I need to read its hearings
 so that I will be guided properly and so
 that I will not vote in the wrong way.
 I intend to vote against the amendment,
 and I intend to vote for a tabling mo-
 tion, if such a motion is offered, but that
 might not be the right thing.
 I urge the Senator to consider with-
 drawing the amendment and letting the
 Foreign Relations Committee conduct
 hearings on the matter, and let us ap-
 proach it from an informed standpoint,
 after adequate testimony has been ad-
 duced and thorough study has been had.
 I cannot read any Senator's mind, but
 there are Senators today who, for politi-
 cal reasons or otherwise-they may be
 running for reelection next year-may
 feel constrained, in the light of events
 and for other reasons, to vote for the
 amendment.
 I think it is not. I hope they would
 not be forced to do that without ade-
 quate preparation and study on a matter
 of such far-reaching constitutional im-
 plications, and I mean they can be far
 reaching with respect to security inter-
 ests of this country in the future.
 For their sake, I hope they will not
 be forced to vote on this issue today. It
 is the wrong vehicle. It is the wrong
 time. It is under the wrong circum-
 stances. It will not affect one way or the
 other this particular subject that is be-
 fore the Senate, basically, the Taiwan
 Enabling Act. And for all of those rea-
 sons, I hope that the distinguished Sena-
 tor from Virginia will consider with-
 drawing the amendment and that he will
 withdraw it.
 I respect him if he does not. I respect
 his right to disagree with me. But I
 S 2299
 know that he will think about it. In con-
 sideration of the need for all Members
 of the Senate to be fully informed on
 this subject before they vote one way or
 the other, I hope that he will withdraw
 the amendment.
 Now I yield to my friend from Arizona,
 Mr. GOLDWATER.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I thank my good
 friend and leader.
 I just wished to read a piece of testi-
 mony that I gave before the Foreign Re-
 lations Committee to show that this is
 not exactly new:
 I wish to remind the Senate that the is-
 sue before us is not novel. It is not new.
 In 1856, the Foreign Relations Committee
 took up the identical question before us to-
 day.
 They examined the question of how a
 treaty should be terminated when the treaty
 itself provides for cancellation after notice
 given by either party.
 The Committee had no difficulty in answer-
 ing the question. In its official report, our
 Senate Committee in 1856 said that "where
 the right to terminate a treaty at discretion
 is reserved in the treaty itself, such discre-
 tion resides in the President and Senate."
 The report went on to say that a treaty
 can also be repealed by joint action of both
 Houses of Congress, but it rejected any idea
 that the President could do it alone.
 Yesterday I put a list of 51 treaties in
 the RECORD that have been abrogated or
 terminated, as some would prefer, since
 the beginning of our Republic. If my
 memory serves me correctly only one
 treaty of mutual defense was included,
 and that was abrogated by the entire
 Congress and later the President ap-
 proved the action.
 So this is not new, and I will say to
 that the Constitution is not exactly clear
 in this whole field.
 I asked a question earlier that no mem-
 ber of the Foreign Relations Committee
 has answered. I wish to know what the
 opinion, for example, of the majority
 leader might be on any President-I do
 not care if he is a Republican, if we live
 that long, or a Democrat if we have to
 put up with that-but would he wish to
 have any President have the power to
 say, "We are going to pull out of. the
 United Nations tomorrow," or "We are
 going to leave NATO tomorrow," or "We
 are going to cancel our Japanese trea-
 ties"?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 will the Senator yield?
 Mr.  GOLDWATER.  The  majority
 leader has the floor.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I had hoped
 the Senator was letting me yield to him
 on his time
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Gladly, but I have
 to get permission from my boss.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The Sena-
 tor from Arizona does not have time.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thought it
 was on the Senator's time.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I assume it is on
 the Senator's time. I will be glad to split
 it with the Senator.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. All right.
 Let me just respond, if I may, to the
 distinguished Senator.

 self one-half additional minute.

 ator from Virginia is recognized for one-

 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I will not
 make a decision at this moment, but I
 will, of course, give full consideration to
 his wishes, although I see very little need
 for it.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, how
 much time remains.to the opponents of
 this amendment?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
 will advise that 11 minutes remain.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I reserve
 5 minutes of that time to reply to the
 distinguished Senator from Virginia.
 First of all, let me say to him that this
 summer the committee will have before
 it a major treaty on treaties, the Vienna
 Convention on the Law of Treaties, at
 which time we shall be conducting thor-
 ough hearings, that could include the
 very question that has been raised by
 the distinguished Senator.
 I should think that 'would be an ap-
 propriate time to consider all of the pos-
 sible ramifications of the very important
 issue he has raised.  .
 I wish to assure the Senator that at
 that time or at some other appropriate
 time the committee will examine this
 question in depth.
 I reiterate the request of. the majority
 leader that the Senator from Virginia
 give serious consideration to withdraw-
 ing the amendment at this time, because
 I feel that it is inappropriate as a part of
 this bill. Furthermore, before we pass
 judgment on a question of such far-
 ranging ramification, we should have the
 benefit of thorough hearings and expert
 testimony.
 For example, Mr. President, the reso-
 lution as it is presently written raises
 questions on its face. Even if we were to
 accept the arguments offered in support
 of the amendment, which I cannot
 accept, the arguments raise a question
 as to why the amendment has been
 framed in such a way as to be limited to
 mutual defense treaties.
 In other words, if the Senator from
 Virginia or the Senator from Arizona
 are correct in their assertion that a
 treaty may not be terminated except
 with the consent of the Congress, then
 why should this sense of the Senate res-
 olution be limited to one kind of treaty,
 namely, mutual defense treaties? Even
 on its face, the amendment is not con- "
 sistent with the argument that has been
 advanced in support of it.

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE
 The  majority  leader has  already
 pointed out that under the Constitution
 the advice and consent of the Senate is
 required only for the purpose of making
 treaties. When it comes to their termi-
 nation, it is true that the Congress can
 take part, and on numerous occasions in
 the past, that indeed has happened.
 If the Congress had wished to initiate
 the action that would terminate the
 Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan,
 then there is nothing to prevent the
 Congress from passing a resolution-a
 joint resolution-calling for the termi-
 nation of that treaty which, if signed by
 the President, would be an act of law.
 And, under the well-known doctrine of
 supersession, the last act of the Congress,
 being last in time, would still supersede
 the mutual defense treaty, and once
 bearing the force of law would operate
 to terminate the treaty.
 So I do not argue with the proposition
 that it is appropriate for Congress when
 it wishes to assert its right to terminate
 treaties simply by passing a resolution
 which, when signed by the President,
 has the force of law and, being the last
 statement on the subject, supersedes any
 previous law. That is how we change
 statutes and treaties.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 HEFLIN). The time of the Senator from
 Idaho has expired.
 Mr. CHURCH. I ask unanimous con-
 sent for 3 extra minutes, Mr. President.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing
 no objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. CHURCH. In the current case we
 happen to have a treaty which includes
 in its own text the manner by which it
 may be terminated. In article X the
 treaty itself provides:
 Either party may terminate it 1 year after
 notice has been given to the other party.
 When this treaty came before the
 Senate in the first instance, when the
 Senate by a two-thirds vote ratified the
 treaty, it also ratified article X which
 contains the method whereby the treaty
 may be terminated. That is every bit as
 much a part of the treaty as any other
 article.
 So the Senate placed its imprimatur
 of approval upon this method for ter-
 minating this particular treaty.
 The President has acted in conformity
 with article X, and I think there is no
 question-at least there is no question
 in my mind-that he has acted in an ap-
 propriate manner, and that by giving this
 notice upon the expiration of the year's
 period, the treaty will be terminated ac-
 cording to its own terms.
 I close, Mr. President, with a statement
 from one of the foremost authorities on
 international law. I quote from the Re-
 statement of the Foreign Relations Law
 of the United States by the American
 Law Institute, from section 163 which
 reads as follows:
 Under the law of the United States, the
 President, or a person acting under his au-
 thority, has, with respect to an international
 agreement to which the United States is a
 party, the authority to take the action neces-
 sary to accomplish under the rules stated in
 section 155 the termination of the agree-
 ment in accordance with the provisions in-
 cluded in it for that purpose.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator's 3 minutes have expired.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Presiding
 Officer.
 I ask unanimous consent that the re-
 maining time be given to the distin-
 guished Senator from New York, the
 ranking member of the Committee on
 Foreign Relations.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I have ex-
 pressed to Senator BYRD yesterday, and I
 express again, my feeling that it is a
 great service to the Senate, and that this
 question will be resolved, and I will join-
 and I think he has known me long
 enough to take my word for that-ac-
 tively and vigorously in resolving it, with
 his leadership.
 I am deeply concerned about the adop-
 tion of this resolution now for this rea-
 son, Senator: The Senator from Arizona,
 exercising his right as an American, has
 started a suit. If the Senate declares even
 in a sense resolution that the action of
 the President, in its opinion, is not law-
 ful, it leaves a very grave legal question
 as to whether we are complying with the
 agreement we are really implementing
 here with the People's-Republic of China,
 because the communique says:
 The United States of American recognizes
 the Government of the People's Republic of
 China as the sole legal government of China.
 Therefore, if we are going to violate
 that then we have violated what we
 started out to do, and this whole effort
 and the whole edifice fall.
 So my point is because of the frame of
 reference in which this amendment is
 cast, and quite without the Senator from
 Virginia or any other author desiring it,
 I agree with that, and I notice the Sen-
 ator has put it in writing, and I do not
 think you can help it when the Senate
 says in its opinion that this is an unlaw-
 ful act, because the President has no such
 power, then you cannot avoid the legal
 consequences which are that the Presi-
 dent has not yet acted until somebody
 else, stronger than we, more authorita-
 tive does so, and that is a tough one be-
 cause I think the Supreme Court is very

 that it is a political question.

 That is why I would add, for whatever
 it is worth, my assurances to those of the
 leadership and those of Senator CHURCH,
 our chairman, to most assiduously and
 faithfully do this job.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. All time of
 the proponents has expired.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I thank the
 Senator from New York. I yield 2 min-
 utes to my colleague from Virginia.
 Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.
 As a cosponsor with the senior Senator
 from Virginia of this amendment, I ad-
 dress to the opposition a question: Since
 the Constitution provides the procedures
 for the creation of a statute or a treaty
 (although it does not in either case
 specifically provide procedures for re-
 peal), and since it does declare both
 statute and treaty, alike, to be the su-
 S 2301
 preme law, why does it not logically fol-
 low that treaties, like statutes, can only
 be repealed by action of the Senate?
 I bring to, your attention article VI of
 the Constitution which says:
 This Constitution, and the Laws of the
 United States which shall be made in Pur-
 suance thereof, and all Treaties made, or
 which shall be made, under the Authority
 of the United States, shall be the supreme
 Law of the Land.
 How can the President, with just a
 stroke of the pen, remove a part of the
 supreme law of the land?
 The distinguished Senator from Ari-
 zona provided for the record historical
 facts with respect to past treaties, the
 ones that have been either abrogated or
 terminated by the President after con-
 sultation with this body.
 I believe that only -four treaties in
 our history have been concluded with-
 out the joint procedure. One where the
 other party (country) went out of ex-
 istence, and the remaining three where
 the treaties became totally outdated and
 did not require action. Thank you Mr.
 President.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The time
 of the Senator has expired.
 The Senator from Virginia.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, article 10 of the treaty with Tai-
 wan states that either party, and that
 means either government-in the United
 States the Government means both the
 legislative branch and the executive
 branch-either government may termi-
 ate the treaty 1 year after notice has
 been given to the other party.
 So it may be terminated during this
 year.
 I emphasize again what I said before,
 and what other Senators have continued
 to insist, that the Constitution says noth-
 ing about how a treaty shall be termi-
 nated. I say the Constitution says noth-
 ing about how a law shall be terminated.
 The Constitution does not say how to
 repeal a statute. It does not say the
 power to terminate a law is shared with
 Congress, but it is obvious that Congress
 must act to terminate a law.
 Frankly, this amendment is so clear
 that I see no reason to hold public hear-
 ings on it, or any other hearings on it,
 I will read it again for the RECORD:
 It is the sense of the Senate that approval
 by the Senate of the United States is re-
 quired to terminate any mutual defense
 treaty between the United States and any
 other nation.
 Senator GOLDWATER has put into the
 RECORD. 51 treaties which have been. ter-
 minated by legislative action.
 As I say, I see no reason for an amend-
 ment as clear as this to be the subject
 of special hearings by the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee. I have no objection to
 it, however.
 I want to give full consideration, of
 course, to the views expressed by the dis-
 tinguished majority leader. I would give
 full consideration to a unanimous-con-
 sent request that if this amendment is
 withdrawn, the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee will consider and will report back
 to the Senate this precise amendment,
 expressing any views it wishes to on it,
 will report back this precise amendment

 for an up-or-down vote on a date cer-
 tain. I prefer to vote today. I think this
 matter is of great importance. I think it
 should be'determined now. But I am will-
 ing to give some consideration if a firm,
 ironclad"agreement can be made to re-
 port this amendment back in 30 days;
 that it become the pending business be-
 fore the Senate, and that an up-or-down
 vote occur on the amendment. Of course,
 the Foreign Relations Committee can
 present any viewpoint it wishes. They
 can say it is a lousy amendment and
 should be voted down. They can make
 any statement they wish. But I would
 seek an up-or-down vote on the amend-
 ment at a time certain.
 If those who are opposing this amend-
 ment today want to enter into such an
 agreement, I will give it consideration.
 But I certainly will not do it merely on
 the basis that the Foreign Relations
 Committee will hold hearings on it and
 may or may not take any action on it.
 This is a vitally important matter. It
 affects the future of all of our treaties.
 It affects the future of the U.S. Senate.
 It affects the future of our Nation, as I
 see it, if we are going to say by a vote
 today, an unprecedented vote, if this
 amendment is voted down, that the
 President of the United States, in the
 sense of this Senate, has the right uni-
 laterally to nullify a treaty.
 Mr. President, how much time do I
 have remaining?
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
 has 31/2 minutes remaining.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I want to say again this amendment
 does not express either approval or dis-
 approval of the President's decision to
 give notice under article 10 of the Mutual
 Defense Treaty  between the United
 States and the Republic of China. The
 amendment does not take from the Pres-
 ident any power he now has. It does not
 prevent the President from expressing
 the intent to abrogate a treaty.
 It does, however, express the view of
 the Senate that under the Constitution
 the President cannot unilaterally nullify
 a treaty. So far as the Senator from Vir-
 ginia is concerned, that is the position
 that I think the Senate of the United
 State should take, that a President can-
 not unilaterally nullify a treaty.
 Mr. CHURCH. Will the Senator yield
 so I might respond?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Yes.
 Mr. CHURCH. I would be happy to as-
 sure the Senator that the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee would hold hearings on
 the subject of the termination of treaties.
 We would look to the best authorities we
 could gather for that purpose. We would
 consider the Senator's proposal, and we
 would report back to the Senate on the
 subject in such form as the committee
 believes appropriate.
 The Senator will always then have the
 opportunity to substitute his amendment
 for any proposal the committee might
 wish to offer.
 I could not commit the committee in
 advance to report back the Senator's
 amendment in exactly the same language
 that the Senator has now presented it.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I thank the
 Senator. I will make the unanimous-con-
 sent request, and the Senate can do as
 it wishes. I ask unanimous consent, Mr.
 President, that if the Senator from Vir-
 ginia and my associates agree to with-
 draw this amendment, that the Foreign
 Relations Committee will hold hearings,
 or do whatever it wishes to do-I do not
 think hearings are necessary-hold hear-
 ings or do whatever it wishes to do, and
 report this precise amendment back to
 the Senate and it, become the pending
 business on May 1, and will continue to
 be the pending business until it is dis-
 posed of either by approval or by tabling.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 reserving the right to object, would the
 Senator not consider this type of a re-
 quest: That the Senator's amendment be
 make that request which, coming from
 the majority leader, I think, says the
 majority leader cannot change it. He can-
 not schedule anything, he is bound by
 the order. The committee cannot change
 it. It is bound by the order to report the
 Senator's amendment back as amended
 if amended. The Senator can continue
 with all his rights as a Senator to offer
 his amendment to that proposal if it is
 reported back. I hope the Senator will
 allow me to interpose that request.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that there be an additional 15 min-
 utes of debate, to be equally divided be-
 tween Mr. Cxvxca and Mr. HARRY F.
 BYRD, JR., in order that this matter might
 be resolved.
 referred to the Committee on Foreign    Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for
 Relations; that the Committee on For-Q' a question?
 eign Relations hold hearings on the Sen-
 ator's amendment, and that the Foreign
 Relations Committee be required to re-
 port back no later than, let us say, 60
 days. We have to give them more time
 than May 1, because under the Budget
 Reform Act we have to have the first
 budget resolution disposed of before
 May 15, so we run into a lot of problems
 that, by law, we are already tied to.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the Senator from Virginia may
 have 2 additional minutes and the Sena-
 tor from Idaho 2 additional minutes.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. Without,ob-
 jection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. No later than
 60 days, or we can make it 90 instead of
 60, that the committee report back that
 amendment, as amended, if amended.
 I do not think we can put a committee
 into a straightjacket in their conducting
 hearings, the Agriculture Committee, the
 Small Business Committee, or whatever
 committee, to say that it will hold hear-
 ings and be required to report back that
 particular resolution, word for word,
 comma for comma, semicolon for semi-
 colon, with no change, and that that
 measure then become the pending busi-
 ness in the Senate.
 I hope the Senator would, with the
 assurance by the Senate, buy an order by
 the Senate itself that the committee re-
 port it back-the chairman and ranking
 member would do that anyway-report
 back no later than 90 days. Then, as ma-
 'jority leader, I am willing to add'the pro-
 vision that it then be the pending busi-
 ness, unless, at that particular point-
 well, the pending business following ac-
 tion on any business that then may be
 pending. We may have an appropriation
 bill up or we may have war powers, we
 may have-who knows what we may
 have up at that point?
 That, it seems to me, is a good arrange-
 ment..It gives the Senator the assurance
 that his resolution has to be the resolu-
 tion that the committee discusses, con-
 ducts hearings on, his amendment is
 going to be reported back as amended if
 amended, his amendment is going to be
 the pending business before the Senate
 at a particular point in this session. That
 gives the Senator assurance that the
 Senate is going to have an opportunity
 to act on this amendment or resolution.
 I hope the Senator will allow me to
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes.
 Mr. FORD. Does this extend, then, the
 12:30 vote, or will it come at 1:30?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. What is the
 unanimous-consent . request?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. That there be
 an additional 15 minutes on this matter;
 not to exceed 15 minutes. We cannot
 guarantee that a quorum can be called
 off in 5 minutes.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there an
 objection?
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Reserving
 the right to object, I am not sure I under-
 stand what the unanimous-consent re-
 quest is.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. This unani-
 mous-consent request is simply that the.
 time be extended for not to exceed 15
 minutes before acting on the Senator's
 amendment. It probably will not take 5
 minutes.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I do not
 object.
 I,vIr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 HEFrna). The clerk will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.- Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I had hoped that the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Virginia would accede to the
 request which I presented, which I felt
 was a very reasonable request, allowing
 the Committee on Foreign Relations to
 conduct hearings on the resolution of-
 fered by the Senator from Virginia,
 which is in-the form of an amendment at
 this point, which would require that the
 committee report back within 90 days,
 no later than 90 days-or, i_ the Senator
 wished to make it 60, that would be
 agreeable, no later than 60 days-the
 Senator's  resolution  as  amended  if
 amended, and that it then be the pending
 business before the Senate following the
 disposition of whatever the pending busi -
 ness was at that particular time.
 Mr. President, that is a very reason-
 able request. It would allow the Foreign
 Relations Committee, which has jurisdic-
 tion over this type of legislation, to con-
 duct hearings, to get eminent witnesses
 to come in, pro and con. Then the Senate

 It is a fair proposal. It is responsible, with no tabling.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The Sen-
 ator from West Virginia indicated a 60-
 day time frame would be satisfactory.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I said 90 days
 earlier, hoping that by doing so we would
 not come in conflict with the expired
 deadlines in connection with programs,
 or with requirements we have to meet
 by law, such as the action on the first
 concurrent budget resolution which has
 to be completed by May 15.
 I would like to at least leave a little
 room for those contingencies.
 Now, this is March, and then we have
 April, that is 60 days. May 15 is a dead-
 line we know we have to meet under the
 law on the first concurrent resolution.
 Could we not say not later than 90
 days? That assures the Senator he is
 going to have a decision one way or
 the other on the matter.
 We are talking about a different 30
 days right now. But I would have to be
 conscious of the. other problems that the
 Senate may be confronted with in con-
 nection with its programing of legisla-
 tion, and legislation that by law we have
 to dispose of by certain deadlines.
 Mr. JAVITS. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes.
 Mr. JAVITS. I just made the sugges-
 tion to Senator CHURCH, he has to agree,
 but I make the suggestion to the Sen-
 ator that the report of the committee
 come within 60 days, and the majority
 leader agree that matter be made the
 pending business within 90 days. That
 gives us the flexibility.
 Mr. CHURCH. That is agreeable to me.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I hope very
 much that the Senator from Virginia
 would accede to that request-
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Does that
 mean it would be made the pending
 business not later than the week of the
 4th of June, for example?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I have not
 had the opportunity to look at the Cal-
 endar, but it would be that the majority
 would be bound by order of the Senate
 to make the resolution reported by the
 committee the pending business no later
 than 90 days from today.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The resolu-
 tion reported by the committee, but the
 resolution reported by the committee, I
 judge from what the majority leader said
 and the chairman of the committee said,
 may not necessarily be this resolution.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. It will be that
 resolution with the Senator's number, his
 name on it, as amended, if amended. It
 may not be amended. But I would think
 that the Senator would not object to
 the committee's taking testimony and
 offering amendments, voting on amend-
 ments to the resolution, in the light of
 evidence adduced.
 When the matter comes up on the
 Senate floor, the Senator from Virginia
 could offer his pending amendment,
 which would be sent to the committee
 as a resolution, as a substitute for what-
 ever the committee reports; or he could
 offer a perfecting amendment to the
 committee's resolution as reported. He
 would maintain all his rights. The two
 managers of the pending bill, who would
 be the managers in that case, have as-

 sured him that he would get an up-and-
 down vote on his amendment.
 This goes a long way, I say to the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Virginia. No-
 body probably has thought of the fact
 that his amendment, when offered, can
 be amended, whether it is a substitute or
 what. The amendment can be amended
 on the floor. They have offered to give
 him a vote up and down on his amend-
 ment as it is written right at this
 moment.
 Mr. JAVITS. His amendment can be
 amended right now.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Of course.
 Mr. JAVITS. Even after we vote on a
 motion to table.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. There is no
 question about it.
 The Senator really is being very fair
 in considering this request. He is being
 protected fully all the way around. He
 Is being assured by the order of the Sen-
 ate that the committee is going to report
 back the subject matter; that the ma-
 jority leader will have to program it; and
 that the Senator will have an opportu-
 nity for an up-and-down vote on his
 amendment as presently 'written, ' if he
 wants to offer it that way to the resolu-
 tion, If the resolution is changed In its
 terminology by the committee.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, re-
 serving the right to object, will the leader
 make a clarification? Did the leader make
 some  reference  to  the  amendment
 after-
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the
 Senator use his microphone? .
 Mr. GOLDWATER. It does not work.
 (Laughter.]
 The leader made some reference to the
 amendment as reported by the commit-
 tee being then referred possibly to "the
 committee on resolution."
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. No, I did
 not.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I got "the com-
 mittee on resolution."
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I was misus-
 ing it. That was an inexactitude in the
 use of terminology.
 I referred to his amendment as being
 reported. It Is an amendment now that
 Senator BYRD has offered. I assume that
 if it goes to the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee, it would have to be a resolution.
 When it is reported from that committee,
 it will be a resolution. Then the Senator
 could offer an amendment to that resolu-
 tion.
 I just sort of got my tongue tied a bit,
 I say to the Senator from Arizona, and
 used the word "resolution" when I may
 have meant the word "amendment." He
 certainly misunderstood me. I did not
 say what he thought I said.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ad-
 ditional time has expired.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the Sena-
 tor from Virginia may have 2 additional
 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, as I understand the proposal, this
 entire matter would come back to the
 Senate, would be scheduled for action
 one way or the other in the Senate, not
 later than the 7th day of June.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. If that is the
 90th day, yes, that would be correct.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Today is
 the 8th day of March. If we follow that
 procedure, it would be Friday, June 8.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I do not know,
 because May has 31 days and April has
 30 days. But it is 90 days. Whether we
 use.the new math or the old, It is 90 days.
 [Laughter.] Provided It Is not a Sunday.
 The Senator can be assured that
 whether this majority leader is still the
 majority leader on that day or not, the
 RECORD will be there, the Senate will be
 standing, and the majority leader at that
 time will be bound and shackled and
 chained-he can come in kicking and
 screaming; if he wants to-but that res-
 olution will have to be made the pend-
 ing business when the 90 days runs their
 course.   -
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, this is a vital matter. I do not
 think it is necessary to hold hearings on
 It. But I always like to cooperate with my
 colleagues. With the assurance that the
 matter will come before the Senate not
 later than 90 days from today and that
 the Senate will have an opportunity to
 debate all aspects of it. I will cooperate
 with the wishes of the majority leader.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 the Senator from Virginia always has
 been cooperative and reasonable, and I
 knew that he would be in this instance.
 He just vindicated my feelings.
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I yield.
 Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as a co-
 sponsor with the senior Senator from
 Virginia, I join him in this measure. I
 compliment the senior Senator from Vir-
 ginia, the majority leader, the chairman
 and the ranking minority leader of the
 Foreign Relations Committee for reach-
 ing this agreement. I believe the ultimate
 resolution of this issue will be one of the
 historic landmarks of the Senate.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, notwith-
 standing anything else, my understand-
 ing is that It will be reported by May 1.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time
 has expired.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I ask unani-
 mous consent for 1 additional minute.
 Mr. HELMS. What is the request?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time
 has expired.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask for
 1 additional second.
 The answer is "Yes."
 Mr. HELMS. That is all I want to know.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. In other
 words, the matter will be handled by
 the Foreign Relations Committee be-
 tween now and May 1, and it will be re-
 ported back to the Senate on May 1.
 Mr. CHURCH. By May 1.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. By May 1.
 And the majority leader will schedule it
 for Senate consideration in a period of
 90 days.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Yes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this
 time, there are two pending unanimous-
 consent requests. The Chair asks that
 Senators indicate on which request they
 would like action at this time.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the
 amendment that is now pending, by the
 distinguished Senator from Virginia (Mr.
 HARRY F. BYRD, JR.), be withdrawn and
 that the amendment in the form of a
 resolution, bearing his name and the
 names of any other Senators he wishes
 to have as cosponsors, be referred to the
 Committee on Foreign Relations; that
 that resolution as amended, if amended,
 be reported back to the Senate no later
 than 60 days from today; that it be made
 the pending question before the Senate
 no later than 90 days from today, and
 that there be an up-and-down vote on
 his amendment at that time, if the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Virginia feels
 constrained to offer it.
 Mr. President, for the phrase "no later
 than 60 days," I substitute "no later
 than May 1."
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Mr. Presi-
 dent, reserving the right to object-and
 I shall not object-the Senator from Vir-
 ginia points out that there are two res-
 olutions at the desk, both of which could
 be referred to the Foreign Relations
 Committee.
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 name of the Senator from Wisconsin
 (Mr. PROXMIRE) be added as a cosponsor.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Is it clear,
 then, as to which resolution will be re-
 ferred to the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Which
 one does the Senator want referred? One
 is a simple resolution and one is a joint
 resolution.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. I would be
 willing to have both of them considered.
 Mr. CHURCH. Very well.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. We will take
 'both, but the committee will report back
 only one.
 Mr. HELMS. The language is the same.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. The lan-
 guage is identical.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? The Chair hears none, and it
 is so ordered.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Chair is informed, with respect to order
 No. 12 under "General Orders," that this
 is on the calendar. Should it also go to
 the committee?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. May I an-
 swer the question?
 I ask unanimous consent that the joint
 resolution that is on the calendar go to
 the committee, because when it comes
 back, it will be put back on the calendar.
 Mr. HARRY F. BYRD, JR. Yes. And
 the simple resolution, which is identical
 to the amendment-
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Also go to the
 committee.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, both will go to the committee.

 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050010-1
 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 tor from Virginia, and I would like briefly
 to explain my reasons for doing so.
 The amendment raises a fulidamental
 issue of constitutioanl principle which
 rises above one's position on the issue of
 normalization of relations with the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China. It is the issue of
 the Senate's role in foreign affairs and,
 more specifically, its role in the formula-
 tion and dissolution of treaties.
 I do not challenge the President's pri-
 mary and constitutionally unambiguous
 authority in the realm of foreign affairs.
 But the Senate must be forceful and con-
 sistent in exercising its own responsibili-
 ties in this area. Certainly this body
 including many of my colleagues here
 who will vote to table this amendment-
 has fought hard over the past decade to
 restore to itself the constitutional pow-
 ers which were eroded by executive usur-
 pation and the failure of legislative as-
 sertiveness. I wish some of the supporters
 of this amendment would have been as
 assertive in exercising this responsibility
 on issues such as Vietnam and Cambodia.
 I wish those who felt as I did then about
 unilateral executive action in Cambo-
 dia would join me now in witnessing for
 the same principle.
 My vote is not to turn back the clock
 and reverse the President's termination
 of the mutual defense treaty with Tai-
 wan. Although I believe he acted in an
 unwise and unfortunate manner by
 ignoring the Senate, I nevertheless rec-
 ognize the President's notification to
 Taiwan that the treaty will be termi-
 nated at the end of 1979 as a fait ac-
 compli. I have no desire to undermine
 the normalization agreement with the
 People's Republic of China.'
 Some of my colleagues have correctly
 noted that the amendment is not pre-
 cise as to the procedure by which the
 Senate would give its approval and that
 it  raises  certain  other  ambiguities.
 Others have suggested that definng the
 Senate's proper role in treaty termina-
 tion is too complex an issue to be settled
 at this time and should be addressed in
 subsequent hearings. I welcome such
 hearings, but I also cannot turn away
 from the principle raised by the Senator
 from Virginia. Consistent with my deeply
 held conviction that the Senate must
 meet its responsibilities in the field of
 foreign affairs, and reflecting my strong
 concern that unilateral executive action
 in terminating treaties is a dangerous
 precedent, I will vote to oppose tabling
 the amendment.O
 POSTPONEMENT OF THE EFFEC-
 TIVE DATE OF RULE XLIV OF THE
 STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is
 my understanding that the resolution
 I offered to amend the rules is to be
 voted on not later than 12:30 this after-
 noon.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Arizona may
 have 1 minute on the resolution.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. DECONCINI. Mr. President, I
 register my firm and unwavering oppo-
 sition to Senate Resolution 93. This
 resolution undoes what the Senate has
 already agreed to., The Senate ethics
 resolution of the 95th Congress, Senate
 Resolution 110, limited the amount of
 outside earnings a Senator or highly paid
 staff member could earn. This provision
 was the subject of extensive debate, and
 agreement was finally reached that the
 amount of outside earnings to be al-
 lowed would be about 15 percent of
 salary.
 The resolution before us today pushes
 back the effective date of this provision
 until January 1, 1983. Under the terms
 of Senate Resolution 110, this limitation
 should have gone into effect on Janu-
 ary 1 of this year.
 I am not unsympathetic to the con-
 cerns and needs of my colleagues. Yet,
 it seems to me that this body exercised
 its collective best judgment in the full
 glare of national publicity when it en-
 acted Senate Resolution 110-a reso-
 lution that was hailed far and wide as
 a major reform in Senate ethics. We
 are now about to eliminate, at least for
 4 years, the central feature of that re-
 form. I cannot in good conscience, Mr.
 President, vote for this measure. And,
 I would urge each and every one of my
 colleagues  to  consider  this  matter
 carefully before casting a vote.
 O Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, I wish
 the RECORD to show that I oppose this
 resolution, Senate Resolution 93.0
 0 Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if a rollcall
 vote would have been taken, I would
 have voted "no" on Senate Resolution
 93.0
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. I move
 the adoption of the resolution.
 Mr. METZENBAUM. Rollcall.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
 the previous order the Senate will now
 proceed to vote on Senate Resolution 93.
 The question is on agreeing to the
 resolution.
 Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded .
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr.  METZENBAUM  addressed  the
 Chair.
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the Senator
 from Ohio have 2 minutes on the reso-
 lution.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I
 rise to indicate my opposition to this
 proposal.
 I think that when there were salary
 adjustments made that this matter was
 taken into account. I think it was part
 and parcel of the entire package .
 I myself have strong reservations and-
 objections to changing the effective date
 S2305
 and wish to be recorded in the negative
 in the event there is not a rollcall vote.
 Mr. DECONCINI. Mr. President, I also
 wish to be recorded in the event there is
 not a rollcall vote in the negative.
 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the
 event there is not a rollcall vote I, also,
 wish to be on record as voting in the
 negative.
 Mr. STEVENS. I move adoption of the
 resolution.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to the resolution.
 (Putting the question.)
 The resolution (S. Res. 93) was agreed
 to, as follows:
 Resolved, That section 313(c) of Senate
 Resolution 110, 95th Congress, is amended by
 striking out "January 1, 1979" and, inserting
 in lieu thereof "January 1, 1983".
 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the res-
 olution was agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. I move to lay that mo-
 tion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 0 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, I was dis-
 mayed to learn that today, Thursday,
 March 8, the Senate passed by voice vote
 a resolution to defer for 4 years the im-
 plementation of Senate rule 44. This rule.
 which limits a Senator's outside earned
 income to 15 percent of salary, was a key
 feature of the Senate Code of Ethics
 which was adopted with much fanfare
 last Congress.
 Suddenly, with no committee consid-
 eration, little floor debate and no rollcall
 vote, the Senate has put Senate rule 44
 in limbo for 4 years. It is a step in the
 wrong direction and one which could lead
 to a total abrogation of the rule when
 those 4 years are up.
 I regret that this important change in
 the Senate rules was made without a
 rollcall vote and if such a vote had been
 conducted I would have voted against
 the change in the rule.0

 CONGRIESSIONAIL RECORD -SENATE           March, 8, 1979
 negotiations, and without adequate con-
 sultation with Congress, President Carter
 announced that the United States would
 establish diplomatic relations with the
 People's Republic of China (PRC) on
 January 1, 1979, with an exchange of
 Ambassadors on March 1, 1979. At the
 same time, the United States gave the
 required 1 year's notice that it would
 terminate its Mutual Defense Treaty
 with the Republic of China (Taiwan) on
 December 31, 1979.
 The main issue growing out of the
 Carter administration's sudden normal-
 ization of relations with the People's
 Republic of China is not really the rec-
 ognition of Peking, but rather the "de-
 recognition" of the Republic of China
 on Taiwan. Our major concern today
 must be with the security of Taiwan and
 of American political, economic, and
 security interests there. America's allies
 and potential enemies throughout Asia
 and the world are watching this debate
 closely. They are looking for indicators
 of America's resolve to protect her in-
 terests and stand by her allies.. The
 Taiwan legislation we pass today must
 send out a clear message that the United
 States will not sell out a friend, now or
 ever, to placate any powerful totalitarian
 regime.
 The administration has proposed that
 unofficial relations with Taiwan be main-
 tained after January 1 by a State De-
 partment  manned,  nongovernmental
 American Institute in Taiwan. This leg-
 islation, S. 245 is an outgrowth of that
 proposal. It speaks to the security of
 Taiwan and attempts to maintain all
 cultural and economic agreements and
 relations now existing between Taiwan
 and the United States. As such, it is far
 better legislation than that put forth
 by the Carter administration, but it must
 be improved. America's security interests
 in Taiwan must be clearly spelled out.
 While Peking was anxious to normalize
 relations with the United States in order
 to counter Soviet influence in Asia, the
 Carter administration extracted no real
 concessions from Peking on the security
 of Taiwan. The United States has agreed
 to Peking's three major demands: Rec-
 ognition of Peking as the legal govern-
 ment of Taiwan; withdrawal of all U.S.
 troops from Taiwan; and termination of
 the United States-ROC Mutual Defense
 Treaty. In addition, the United States
 has agreed to a moratorium on new arms
 sales to Taiwan for 1 year.
 In exchange, the PRC has said that
 it will seek peaceful reunification of Tai-
 wan to the mainland. However, Peking
 has very clearly refused to renounce the
 use of force against Taiwan. Peking says
 it will permit the people of Taiwan to
 keep their own political and economic
 systems and security forces as long as
 they choose. But these verbal pledges ap-
 ply only if Taiwan agrees to recognize
 Peking's sovereignty and does not permit
 foreign military bases. The PRC has
 made no formal commitments on these
 already very conditional promises, and
 the administration itself has done little
 to amplify them.
 For example, the PRC' has pointed to
 Hong Kong and Macao as examples of
 coexistence with different economic sys-
 tems on territory claimed by Peking, but
 those entities have not recognized Pe-
 king's sovereignty. A more. disturbing ex-
 ample of reunification involves the sub-
 jugation of Tibet, a process which many
 would describe as "genocide." We should
 not take the example of Tibet too lightly.
 We have seen recently in Vietnam that
 China is willing to use force to achieve
 its objectives, but the examples of the
 Korean war, the Sino-Indian war, and
 the bloody purges following the Com-
 munist victory on the mainland should
 have already told us that.
 In my view, the Carter administration
 has taken a stronger pro-Peking tilt
 than was necessary to achieve normaliza-
 tion and, in the process, has endangered
 the people of Taiwan. The Carter admin-
 istration rejected alternative ways to
 deal with normalization such as the
 "German model" of recognizing two
 Chinas. It rejected placing our Embassy
 in Peking with an official liaison mission
 in Taipei.
 The Carter administration has even
 refused to give any governmental status
 to Taiwan. It is the Congress which is
 considering granting diplomatic immun-
 ity to Taiwanese officials and, despite
 promises that the United States would
 not interfere with United States-Taiwan
 cultural exchanges, the Carter adminis-
 tration has moved to close down some of
 the Taiwanese consulates.
 The weakness of the Carter adminis-
 tration in negotiating with Peking and
 in failing to show resolve with respect to
 the security of Taiwan cannot be cor-
 rected completely by the Congress. We
 can, however, move to strengthen the
 legislation before us, S. 245.
 For that reason, I have cosponsored
 the amendment proposed by Senator
 PERCY which would make clear that the
 security of Taiwan effects the security
 interests of the United States. I believe
 that the language in the bill as reported
 by the Foreign Relations Committee is
 not sufficiently strong. The words "of
 grave concern" do not carry in them the
 strong sense of commitment which I be-
 lieve should be inherent in this legisla-
 tion. Indeed, I believe that national lead-
 ers around the world will look upon the
 success or failure of Senator PERCY's
 amendment as a measure of American
 will and reliability.
 Today, and in the years ahead, the
 Senate must also insure that the secur-
 ity of Taiwan is not compromised indi-
 rectly. For example, the Congress should
 make clear that it will not condone ad-
 ministration acquiescence in any form
 of discrimination by Peking against firms
 doing business with Taiwan, and it must
 force the administration to take a firm
 stand protecting Taiwan in internation-
 al monetary and financial institutions
 and facilitating trade and investment
 between the United States and Taiwan.
 In short, we must make sure that our
 political, economic, and security-inter-
 ests in Taiwan mature rather than erode.
 Mr. President, I suggest the absence
 of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 BAucus). The clerk will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk proceed-
 ed to call the roll.
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would
 like to state my.basic support for this
 legislation. I believe, that it provides for
 the security of Taiwan and for uninter-
 rupted continuation of warm and friend-
 ly relations with the people of Taiwan.
 I do not believe that a relinquishment
 of concern for the fate of Taiwan should
 result from normalization of relations
 with the People's Republic of China. The
 Senate should clearly state its determi-
 nation that the United States aid in
 maintaining the security of Taiwan and
 in maintaining fruitful trade and warm
 cultural relations with the people of that
 island.
 This determination matches our desire
 to maintain the close and special inti-
 macy which arises from our 30-year rela-
 tionship with Taiwan. As a result of those
 relations, we have at present approxi-
 mately 60 treaties with Taiwan covering
 such matters as. trade, visas, and eco-
 nomic and technical cooperation. Our
 total trade with Taiwan was more than
 $7 billion last year. Our investment in
 Taiwan is almost one-third of all foreign
 investment on the island. This relation-
 ship cannot and should not end.
 If the People's Republic of China
 wishes to maintain good relations with
 the United States, it must let the peace
 of Taiwan stand as the first litmus test
 of our new relationship. Let us hope that
 the Government of the PRC was sincere
 when it declared in its message of Janu-
 ary 1, 1979, that it "will take present
 realities into account" and will "respect
 the status quo on Taiwan ?  ?   ' in set-
 tling the question of reunification."

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 14, lines 9 and 10, strike out "of
 grave concern to" and insert in lieu thereof
 to the security interests of".
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I offer this
 amendment on behalf of myself and
 Senators GOLDWATER, HOLLINGS, TOWER,
 DECONCINI, HUDDLESTON, STEVENS, STONE,
 COHEN,  WEICKER,  PROXMIRE,  COCHRAN,
 MORGAN, and DANFORTH.
 Mr. President, as the chairman of. the
 Foreign Relations Committee knows, the
 Senator from Illinois has long favored
 normalization of our relationships with
 China, because it is in the national
 interest. China should take its rightful
 place in the community of nations.
 I believe the distinguished chairman
 of the committee would remember my
 former professor at the University of
 Chicago years ago, Paul Douglas; against
 whom I ran for the Senate in 1966. He
 will remember him not only as a beloved
 colleague, but also as a wise man for
 whom we had infinite respect. Nonethe-
 less, I did find some of his economic
 theories erroneous and I sharply dis-
 agreed with his judgment on some mat-
 ters in foreign policy.
 I certainly disagreed with him, when I
 ran for the Senate, on the Vietnam war.
 This issue sharply divided us.
 Senator Paul Douglas was one of the
 founders of an organization formed for
 the purpose of keeping mainland China
 out of the United Nations and I opposed
 him on that particular issue. I felt it
 most unrealistic that a government rep-
 resenting, at that time, three-quarters
 of a billion people, since grown, should
 be kept out of the United Nations and
 should not be a full member of the inter-
 national community.
 So, as I have worked in the Senate, I
 have taken a deep interest in the affairs
 of the People's Republic of China. I was
 privileged to lead a delegation of Sen-
 ators and Congressmen to China to study
 firsthand that remarkable country, and
 felt even more deeply at that time that
 the process of normalization should be
 expedited to the greatest possible extent.
 So I am fully supportive of the legis-
 lation before us and have enjoyed work-
 ing with the chairman of the committee
 (Mr. CHURCH) and the ranking minority
 member (Mr. JAVITS) on considering leg-
 islation that would enable us to move
 forward.
 I have felt in the past and still feel
 today that full diplomatic relations are
 not only realistic, but they are also in
 the mutual national interest of both
 China and the United States. Therefore,
 with no intention to jeopardize this proc-
 ess, I call up amendment No. 79 to sec-
 tion 114 of the Taiwan Enabling Act for
 myself and for my distinguished cospon-
 sors. Section 114 of the legislation deals
 with a continuing and strong U.S. inter-
 est in a peaceful solution to the Taiwan
 issue. This is a subject that we have been
 privileged to discuss among ourselves at
 great length, that has been debated by
 the American public, and that has been
 discussed fully among the Members of
 this body and Vice Premier Teng when
 he was here, together with the distin-
 guished ambassadors and members of-the
 Chinese diplomatic mission in Washing-
 ton. As we all know, the executive branch
 really did not want Congress to make
 any statement whatsoever on this issue.
 The Senate Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions felt differently. The committee and
 the Senate, I think, owe a great deal to
 Senator CHURCH and Senator JAVITS for
 persuading the executive branch that the
 American people's concern about the
 future of the people on Taiwan could not
 be ignored. A strong statement on the
 issue was absolutely imperative.
 The fundamental thrust of section 114
 is good and there is a great deal in the
 language that I support and I urge my
 Senate colleagues to support. We state
 in this section that it is U.S. policy to
 make clear that "the U.S. decision to
 establish diplomatic relations with the
 PRC rests on the expectation that any
 resolution of the Taiwan issue will be
 by peaceful means." We also state that
 we will maintain our capacity to resist
 force or corecion that would jeopardize
 the security or social or economic system
 of the people on Taiwan. And we state
 that we will provide defensive arms to
 the people on Taiwan. These are strong
 statements of U.S. expectations and in-
 tent and I wholeheartedly endorse them.
 I do recommend to the Senate, how-
 ever one change which I believe strength-
 ens and clarifies the section. Section
 114 (a) paragraph (3) reads:
 It is the policy of the United States to
 consider any effort to resolve the Taiwan
 issue by other than peaceful means a threat
 to the peace and security of the Western.
 Pacific area and of grave concern to the
 United States.
 My amendment would delete "of grave
 concern to" and would substitute "to the
 security interests of."
 I believe this substitution of language
 is essential, because we have a respon-"
 sibility to make to the PRC a clear state-
 ment of U.S. interests in a peaceful
 settlement of the Taiwan issue. We must
 not lead the Chinese to miscalculate or
 underestimate our interests. A clear
 statement reduces ambiguity and lessens
 the chances for misunderstanding.
 Certainly, we, in taking any action,
 must take into account that succession
 of leadership takes places in our coun-
 try and other countries. Therefore,. we
 should make unmistakably clear in the
 language of this legislation how we feel
 on this matter.
 The President did not obtain from
 the PRC a pledge on the nonuse of force
 against Taiwan. Perhaps this was diplo-
 matically unobtainable, as the admin-
 istration maintains. But the point is
 that China's spokesmen have been very
 clear in what they have said. Chinese
 Premier Deng Xiao'ping told the com-
 mittee during his recent visit to Wash-
 ington that China will fully respect the
 realities on Taiwan. But he also main-
 tained, when pressed on the issue, that
 China will not make a commitment to
 use only peaceful means. In other words,
 the Chinese have retained use of force
 as a definite option. Vice Premier Deng
 was frank with us. He did not worry
 about the consequences for normali-
 zation.
 S 2307
 He believed, as. I believe, that. it is best
 to be frank in exchanging views. When
 we agree, we agree to disagree and do
 so openly and we can each express our-
 selves. I think we have that obligation
 today.
 Now it is our turn to be equally frank.
 We must state that a PRC effort to re-
 solve' the Taiwan issue by other than
 peaceful means would be a threat to the
 security interests of the United States.
 I urged my colleagues on the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee to adopt
 this language, but it was rejected.
 One  argument  made  against  my
 amendment was that it might derail the
 normalization process. I reject. this ar-
 gument. We should not muddy our defi-
 nition of U.S. interest- because we are
 afraid of offending PRC sensitivities.
 Vice-Premier Deng did not mince words
 when he refused to pledge nonuse of
 force against Taiwan because of any
 concern that normalization would not
 proceed. Vice-Premier Deng was not con-
 cerned about offending the United States
 when he said in Tokyo, immediately fol-
 lowing his tour here, that the United
 States had shown a lack of direction on
 the Iranian crisis and had mishandled it.
 The Chinese were not concerned about
 derailing  normalization  when  they
 stated that they must "punish" Vietnam
 and when they soon thereafter invaded
 Vietnam. The Chinese say what they
 mean and we respect them for it. Now
 we must say what we mean and the
 Chinese, in my view, will respect us for
 it.
 I do believe, even though there is
 sometimes a different approach taken in
 the field of diplomacy, we are still deal-
 ing with human beings. The experience
 of. the Senator from Illinois has always
 been that a relationship is more nor-
 mal, natural, and healthy and more long-
 lasting when friends are good enough to
 speak frankly to each other. I do not
 really believe that the Chinese would
 respect us if, knowing we felt deeply
 about something, we did not forthrightly,
 frankly, and honestly express exactly
 how we feel in important documents as
 is the legislation presently before us.
 President Carter has declared that the
 United States could go to war over Tai-
 wan. This is much stronger language
 than I am suggesting and the Chinese
 certainly have not terminated the nor-
 malization process because of it.
 A second argument made in the Sen-
 ate Foreign Relations Committee against
 my amendment was that it would com-
 mit the United States to take military
 action if the PRC used force against Tai-
 wan. This criticism is unfounded. My
 amendment leaves completely open the
 options for a U.S. response. It neither
 pledges use of force nor rules out the,
 possibility of use of force. I would op-
 pose language that would commit us in
 advance to use force in the case of hos-
 tilities directed at the people on Taiwan.
 In fact, it is my view that it is unconsti-
 tutional to direct the President to use
 force under circumstances that may oc-
 cur in the future.
 We would not want to bind this Nation
 to action that goes even further than any
 mutual security treaty we have today.

 the language of Senator PEacY's amend-
 ment could be acceptable, that when one
 takes into account the meaning of the
 words and what the words indicate, the
 perception of those words to the other
 nations in that part of the world, it
 could indicate a great deal more than
 the words on their face indicate.
 So, all told, our committee was of the
 view that this amendment should be- re-
 jected, and this is the position the com-
 mittee takes on the floor.
 Let me note here that our military
 presence in Taiwan over the past two
 decades and our Mutual Defense Treaty
 were orginally predicated on the under-
 standing of that earlier period that our
 interests in Asia faced a monolithic
 Communist threat. We might not have
 been totally wrong then, but certainly
 now it is clear that the situation has
 changed radically in these decades from
 a primarily East-West confrontation to
 confrontations. primarily among Com-
 munist states.
 In reaching the agreement on normal-
 ization with Peking, the administration
 agreed to terminate the Mutual Defense
 Treaty with Taiwan, including the for-
 mal security commitment in article 5 of
 that treaty. The language introduced by
 Senator PEacY could easily be inter-
 preted as reviving. the concept of that

 United States has normalized relations
 with Peking that obviously the adminis-
 tration would at that time consult with
 Congress and decide upon an appropri-
 ate response. But the degree of auto-
 maticity implied by the Percy amend-
 ment is highly undesirable.
 At this point and at this time, however,
 I believe that we have struck the right
 balance in the language of section 114(a)
 as it now stands.
 Let me add one point. What we want to
 achieve on this subject is a clear state-
 ment, demonstrating a virtual consen-
 sus, about the American people's con-
 cerns about our friends on Taiwan. We
 want Peking to get the message from
 Congress just as it already has been given
 the message by the President and Am-
 bassador Woodcock. It is clear to me that
 Senator PERCY's amendment would not
 get strong majority support. What would
 we have gained by language of this sort
 adopted by a narrow majority? The mes-
 sage- that would come through in that
 case would be that a substantial minority
 does not care about a nonpeaceful reso-
 lution. We obviously do not want that.
 And it would be small comfort to Taiwan.
 I urge that we support the estimable
 language that was negotiated in the
 committee. It accurately and strongly
 reflects the American position on this
 subject-in a manner that is called for at
 this point in history:
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The assistant- legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for the
 quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the name of the
 distinguished Senator from California
 (Mr. HAYAKAWA) be added as a cosponsor
 of the pending amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, inas-
 much as I voted against the amendment
 in committee, I think I should explain
 why I have changed my position.
 On first reading, it appeared to me
 that Senator PERCY's amendment was
 unnecessary, because it seemed to me to
 be covered by other aspects of the same
 document. But on second and third read-
 ing, and upon more mature reflection, it
 seems to me that I must support Senator
 PERCY's amendment, and therefore I rise
 to do so.
 Mr. PERCY. I thank my distinguished
 colleague.
 Mr. President, the senior Senator
 from  Tennessee   (Mr.   BAKER),   the
 minority leader, is necessarily absent
 from the Senate today on official busi-
 ness. Senator BAKER has a ithorize'? me,
 however, to make the following state-
 ment on his behalf.
 Senator  BAKER  fully supports  the
 Percy amendment to the Taiwan En-
 abling Act. When the committee voted
 on the security provision, he specifically
 asked that his proxy be withheld so that
 he may preserve his option to support
 amendments to the provision.
 Although he is unable to be here for
 the vote, Senator BAKER hopes to be
 paired in support of the amendment.
 I express deep appreciation to Sena-
 tor BAKER for his counsel and advice and
 his support. Senator BAKER and I have
 met at some considerable length with
 Deputy  Secretary  of  State  Warren
 Christopher, have listened to his rea-
 soning, and both Senator BAKER and I
 have reaffirmed our intention to go for-
 ward, because we feel that this is a
 point of view that I feel is shared over-
 whelmingly by the American people and
 by the Senate of the United States.
 I should like to ask a question of the
 distinguished chairman of the Foreign
 Relations Committee who was present
 at the time of our hearings when Gen-
 eral Jones, the chairman of the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff, appeared before the
 committee. At that time I asked Gen-
 eral Jones to indicate whether or not
 an attack by force on Taiwan by the
 People's Republic of China would be a
 threat to our security interests or just
 a matter of grave concern to us.
 General Jones replied:
 I believe that an attack on Taiwan would
 be not only of grave concern but would
 impact on our security interests. There is
 no question about it.
 Now the Senator from Illinois does
 not wish in any way by offering this
 amendment to imply that I believe the
 PRC would attack and try to take Tai-
 wan by force, because I have'listened
 very carefully to everything that respon-
 sible officials in the Government of the
 People's Republic of China have said
 about their intentions. It seems emi-
 nently clear that they are patient and
 they wish to resolve this matter in an
 amicable and peaceful manner. It is also
 the judgment of the Senator from Illi-
 nois that a nonpeaceful resolution to the
 Taiwan issue is not at all in the inter-
 ests of China.
 It would be so contrary to the thrust
 of their intent to develop their economy
 and establish goods relationships with
 the Western world and Japan. .The Sen-
 ator from Illinois cannot really envision
 the use of force by China today or in the
 foreseeable future.
 I was also very, pleased to find that
 our own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, of
 Staff, felt that as well.
 If I could find in the-
 Mr. CHURCH. May I reply to the
 Senator?
 Mr. PERCY. I will be happy to have
 a reply while I try to find the response
 that. General Jones gave to our ques-
 tions on that particular point, But I
 would be very anxious to have a reac-
 tion from our distinguished chairman
 as to whether he does feel that an at-
 tack on Taiwan would be more than just
 a matter of grave concern. While the
 distinguished Senator was off the floor,
 the Senator from Illinois reviewed a
 series of statements made by members
 of the State Department and various
 administrations describing U.S. feelings
 about particular situations. In each case,
 no action of any kind was taken by the
 United States. If I could say, the se-
 mantics of the situation are such that
 the signal is that a matter of grave con-
 cern does not imply that we take action;
 whereas, without any question, an attack
 upon a NATO ally, for instance, or an
 attack in other parts of the world where
 our vital -interests would be threatened
 would certainly call for action. My
 amendment falls somewhere in between.
 I ask my distinguished colleague if he
 would not agree with the Chairman of
 the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with the co-
 sponsors of this amendment that a force-
 fill attack on Taiwan would be a matter
 of more than grave concern, a phrase
 used frequently in diplomacy without
 action following it.
 Mr. CHURCH. First, let me say that
 the language agreed to by the committee
 constitutes, in my view, a broader basis
 for reassurance to the people of, Taiwan
 than the old arrangement between the
 United States and the Republic of China.
 But as for the Senator's question, I call
 his attention to page 745 of the hearings
 where the Senator puts the following
 question to General Jones:
 Senator PERCY.... Let me put it this way
 for you, then. In your judgment, is it stronger
 to say "a threat to the security interests of
 the United States" rather than saying it is a
 "matter of grave concern" to us?
 General JoNEs. It may be stronger, but
 my problem with "threat to security inter-
 ests" is that there is no qualifying factor
 there, and that our security interests are less
 there than in other areas of the Pacific or of
 the world. So, I would be concerned about
 the  implication  being  far  greater  than
 intended.
 So I think the record should be clear
 that General Jones did not call for the
 Percy amendment. In fact, at no time did
 he express any reservation about the
 language that is now contained in the
 bill.
 Moreover, I believe that a careful read-
 ing of the general's testimony, as it ap-
 pears here in the hearings, would con-
 vey to any Senator the fact that General
 Jones thought there were many other
 places in the Western Pacific that were
 of much greater importance than Taiwan
 to the security interests of 'the United
 States.
 Now, having said that, Mr. President,
 let me go on to emphasize that the pro-
 visions of the bill in connection with our
 continuing concern for the security and
 well-being of the people on Taiwan go
 very far. If I were a citizen of Taiwan, I
 would be better satisfied with this con-
 gressional declaration of American policy
 than with the 'arrangement that pre-
 viously existed.
 I intend to speak to section 114 of the
 bill, but I would not want to do so while
 trespassing on the time of the Senator
 from Illinois, who presently has the floor.
 I, for that reason, confine my response
 at this time to the answer to the ques-
 tion he put to me.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I certainly
 hope that I did not imply that the Chair-
 man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General
 Jones, supports my amendment.
 The Senator from Illinois would never
 put the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff in that position. At no time when I
 questioned him did I attempt to put him
 in the position of supporting a specific

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE          March 8, 1979
 piece of legislation. The administration,
 as the Senator from Illinois understood
 at that time, had not yet addressed it-
 self specifically to this language, but it
 was wellknown that they wanted as
 little change as possible. The current
 situation is somewhat similar to the
 Panama Canal Treaty debate where the
 administration wanted as little change
 as possible, but the Senate of the United
 States found it essential in order to ratify
 that treaty that we have our mark or im-
 print on it. We had to satisfy many of
 the concerns that some of us had and we
 did change that language.
 But it is understandable that the ad-
 ministration, after having negotiated an
 understanding with China, would not
 want to change it any more than was ab-
 solutely essential or necessary.
 The Senator from Illinois knows that
 General Jones would have preferred that
 somehow I would qualify the amendment
 to show that our security interests In
 Taiwan are, for Instance, less than our
 security interests in, let us say, Japan.
 But I do think that this kind of ranking
 does neither ourselves nor our friends
 any benefit whatsoever.
 When Secretary of State Dean Ache-
 son drew the defense perimeter in Asia
 to exclude South Korea we saw a war
 break out there.
 So I would say that for us to Issue such
 a ranking in legislation and say one in-
 terest is relatively more important than
 another would not really serve our
 interests.
 We are simply trying to say that there
 are certain areas of the world where our
 interests are not really affected. There
 are other areas where they are affected
 and we should indicate as accurately as
 possible the degree of concern we might
 have in a particular area to deter actions
 harming our interests.
 We are certainly today stating very
 clearly that our interests in the Middle
 East are far ahead of our interests in
 many other parts of the world. They are
 absolutely vital there. What the Soviet
 Union' might do in some area affecting
 the Middle East would be highly impor-
 tant to us.
 It is highly important that a Marxist
 state such as South Yemen not be per-
 mitted to increase its strength along
 the borders of Saudi Arabia. It is in the
 vital interests of the United States that
 we provide assistance, help, backup, and
 support for the position taken by Saudi
 Arabia now so that North Yemen not be-
 come a vulnerable spot and endanger
 Saudi Arabia whose interests are inex-
 tricably bound up in our own interests.
 Therefore, when we come to Taiwan we
 simply say it would be a matter of much
 more than grave concern. It would be a
 matter involving our own security inter-
 ests because of the close relationships
 we have with South Korea, and the close
 ties that we have in Japan, and the in-
 terest we have in keeping ourselves as a
 Pacific power, and insuring as much free-
 dom in that area as is possible.
 So the Senator from Illinois is once
 again gratified at the degree of support
 this amendment has in the cosponsors
 In the Senate, and that some members
 in the Committee on Foreign Relations,
 who previously had voted against it or
 abstained from voting, have now, after
 reflection, supported it.
 It would be my hope, of course, that
 taking fully into account the agreement
 and understanding reached by the chair-
 man and the distinguished minority
 member of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations, with the administration, that
 they would find it acceptable and would
 not find it contrary to our normalization
 of relationships, and ? working together
 In a new spirit of friendship, accord, and
 partnership with China.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, the
 amendment offered by the able Senator
 from Illinois should be rejected by the
 Senate, as it was rejected by the com-
 mittee. The language of section 114(a)
 as it now stands reflects a careful
 balance. It is balanced between accurate-
 ly reflecting what an armed attack
 against Taiwan would mean, on the one
 hand, and, on the other, avoiding an
 approximation of the language of the
 Mutual  Defense  Treaty-which  was
 terminated as part of the agreement on
 normalization of relations with the Peo-
 ple's Republic.
 Mr. President, let me note here that
 our military presence in Taiwan over the
 past 2 decades, and our Mutual Defense
 Treaty, were originally predicated on
 the belief of that earlier period that our
 interests in Asia faced a monolithic
 Communist threat. We neither perceived
 nor understood the nature of commu-
 nism as well then as we do today. In the
 intervening years, it certainly is clear
 that the situation in Asia has changed
 radically from what was a primarily
 east-west confrontation to a north-south
 confrontation involving the Communist
 governments, themselves.
 If you look at China now, it is not a
 China poised on its coastline ready to
 leap across the Straits of Formosa for
 the purpose of subjugating the island and
 its people. Today's China looks to the
 north, expressing its daily concern over
 the threat posed by the other titan of the
 Communist world, the Soviet Union; and
 it looks to the south, where it has just
 been engaged in active warfare with
 another Communist neighbor, Vietnam.
 Before we begin to tamper with the
 language in this bill, it would be prudent,
 first of all, to consider the nature of the
 present threat to the people of Taiwan.
 The record is clear, made so by the
 many statements of the leaders of the
 People's Republic of China, that the
 Peking government presently entertains
 no intention of attacking Taiwan.
 Furthermore, we have it from no less
 an authority than the Chairman of our
 own Joint Chiefs of Staff, that mainland
 China, even if it were to change its mind,
 presently lacks the military capability
 of successfully invading Taiwan.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, will the
 distinguished Senator yield at that point
 so that I can insert in the RECORD the
 quotations from General Jones that I
 have now found that would strengthen
 and support that argument?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am only too happy to
 get whatever support is offered for any
 argument I make. If the Senator has
 pruned from the testimony of General
 Jones that part which sustains my argu-
 ment, I would be pleased to have that
 material inserted at this point in the
 RECORD.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, the only
 carefully selection would be simply to
 boil it down as much as possible. It does
 fully support the Senator's position,
 and confirms the fact that the distin-
 guished chairman of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee and the Senator from
 Illinois have no disagreement what-
 soever about this particular point.
 I have stated my own personal judg-
 ment that there is no intention on the
 part of China to attack Taiwan. General
 Jones has already affirmed that it is a
 problem not only of capability, but also
 intention, as to whether it would be in
 their best interests.
 I quote from the top of page 741 in the
 hearings record, where General Jones
 says:
 As we look at the People's Republic of
 China, we see increasing problems in their
 military capability. We have projected levels
 of capability and later found they haven't
 achieved that capability. We don't see an
 acceleration in the threat and we don't see
 any great urgency at this moment to make
 decisions on additional equipment (for Tai-
 wan).
 This is certainly reassuring. It should
 be reassuring to the people of Taiwan
 and it should be reassuring to all peace-
 loving people that there has been no
 buildup of capability.
 If the People's Republic of China
 wished to, they could build up that
 capability. They have great human re-
 sources and great physical resources,
 and if they had wanted to, they could
 have developed that capacity. But they
 have not done so.
 Further with respect to their inten-
 tions, General Jones said this. Quoting
 from the middle of page 751, I will read
 the entire quotation, so we can have
 in the RECORD once again what General
 Jones said about an attack on Taiwan.
 He said:
 I believe that an attack on Taiwan would
 be not only of grave concern but would
 impact on our security interests. There is
 no question about it.
 Then he continued, importantly :
 I believe that it is unlikely-not to the
 point of a zero probability, but very, very
 unlikely-to occur. It would also not be in
 the best interests of the People's Republic
 of China. It would increase the risk of in-
 cursions by the Soviet Union from the
 north. It would weaken them in their rela-
 tionships with Japan and the United States.
 So I think it is clearly riot in their best
 Interest-and not in our best interest-
 that they do this.
 It is General Jones' firm conviction,
 shared by so many of us, that it is not
 China's intention; they have not tried
 to develop the capability, and it is high-
 ly unlikely that they would do this, thus
 endangering, I might add, not just their
 relationships with the United States
 and Japan, but also with Western
 Europe.
 It is those relationships on which
 China is now staking Its future develop-
 ment. That is really central to their
 development. Taiwan is not central to
 that development. As they have indi-

 cated, they would have no objection to
 the institutions in Taiwan being carried
 on in the same way they are now, and
 they likened the situation there to that
 in Hong Kong.
 So what my amendment does not
 arise from a concern about the inten-
 tions         of  the  present  leadership  of
 China. I simply want to put into law
 an advance notice and an honest ex-
 pression of opinion as to the degree of
 gravity with which the United States
 would look upon the use of force, un-
 likely as it might be.
 I thank the distinguished Senator for
 yielding.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the able Sena-
 tor from Illinois for his contribution.
 It appears, then, Mr. President, that
 we are agreed, first, that the Peking gov-
 ernment has no present intention to re-
 sort to arms to settle the Taiwan
 question; and second, that even if this
 were not so, the mainland government
 does not possess the military capability,
 today, to successfully attack and conquer
 Taiwan.
 Third, if the policy in Peking were to
 change, and an attempt. were made to
 develop the capability necessary to suc-
 cessfully attack Taiwan General Jones
 has told us that it would take the
 Chinese at least 5 years to develop the
 amphibious forces to carry an invading
 force across the 100 miles of water that
 separate the mainland from the island.
 So at the very least, we would have 5
 years' notice before any attack could
 be launched. There does not seem to be
 any disagreement on that score, either.
 Furthermore, Mr. President, General
 Jones has confirmed that the people on
 Taiwan have a sufficient quantity of de-
 fensive weapons, today to successfully-de-
 fend themselves against any attack. We
 have learned, I think, from the Israeli
 experience that there is no security
 guarantee that can be given by any
 foreign country-not even by the United
 States-that means as much to the suc-
 cessful defense of any land as the will-
 ingness and capability of its own people
 to defend it. Just as this is true with
 Israel, so it is true in the case of Taiwan.
 Now, against these basic premises-
 first, that the mainland government has
 no intention of attacking Taiwan; sec-
 ond, that it lacks amphibious capability
 to invade Taiwan, and it would require
 at least 5 years to build the capaibility;
 and third, that Taiwan has the defensive
 arms to successfully turn back any at-
 tack-let us read the language that the
 committee agreed upon in section 114 of
 the bill. I read the language, Mr. Presi-
 dent, simply to underscore how broad
 the committee's expression of interest is
 in the future of Taiwan, as set forth in
 the language of the bill.
 Section 114(a) reads:
 In order to achieve the objectives of this
 section-
 It is the policy of the United States-
 (1)         to maintain extensive,  close,  and
 friendly relations with the people on Taiwan;
 (2) to make clear that the United States'
 decision to establish diplomatic relations
 with the People's Republic of China rests on
 the expectation that any resolution of the
 Taiwan issue will be by peaceful means;
 (3) to consider any effect to resolve the
 Taiwan issue by other than peaceful means
 a threat to the peace and security of the
 Western Pacific area. and of grave concern
 to the United States; and
 (4) to provide the people on Taiwan with
 arms of a defensive character.
 There, Mr. President, is the statement
 of American policy. It will be an expres-
 sion of Congress. When signed by the
 President, it will be the law of the land.
 What do we say about the action we
 will take to implement this policy, That
 is contained in part (b) of section 114,
 and reads as follows:
 (1) the United States will maintain its
 capacity to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize the
 security, or the social or economic system, of
 the people on Taiwan;
 (2) the United States will assist the people
 on Taiwan to  maintain  a sufficient self-
 defense capability through the provision of.
 arms of a defensive character;
 (3) the President is directed to inform the
 Congress promptly of any threat to the
 security of Taiwan and any danger to the in-
 terests of the United States arising there-
 from; and
 And (4)  the United States will act to
 meet any danger described in paragraph (3)
 of this subsection in accordance with con-
 stitutional processes and procedures estab-
 lished by law.
 I ask you, Mr. President, how could
 we design language better suited to ac-
 commodate the needs of the people. on
 Taiwan as they look to the future?
 (Mr. LEVIN assumed the chair.)
 Mr. CHURCH. Mischief would be. done
 by tampering with this language. The
 substitution of the words contained in
 the Percy amendment would bring us
 back very close to the phraseology that
 was used in the old mutual security pact
 which will be terminated as a result of
 the new relationship we have established
 with mainland China.
 Yesterday, I spoke with the President.
 of the United States. He is prepared to
 accept the committee language because
 it is drafted in such a way that it does
 not infringe upon any commitment he
 made on behalf of the United States. The
 language in the pending bill will not
 jeopardize the normalization of our rela-
 tions with Peking, which the. Senator
 from Illinois concedes he so strongly
 favors.
 But if we adopt the language he would
 substitute, reminiscent as it is of the
 language contained in the old Mutual
 Security Treaty, then we place at hazard
 the new relationship we seek with main-
 land China.
 The President was deeply concerned
 that we not make this mistake. He told
 me, as he has said to others, that he is
 obliged to comply with the understand-
 ing reached with the People's Republic
 of China. If'this bill contains language
 that goes beyond that understanding,
 then he has only one honorable course
 to follow, and that is to veto the bill.
 Why should we put this new relation-
 ship at such risk when it is utterly
 unnecessary?
 Earlier in this debate, Mr. President,
 I said that if I were a citizen of Taiwan,
 I would prefer the statement of policy
 contained in this bill over whatever guar-
 antees were proffered during the period
 of our alliance with Taiwan. I want to
 tell you why I say that, Mr. President.
 We  have  normalized  relations  with
 Peking because we believe it will benefit
 the United States. Normal relations with
 a government that maintains jurisdic-
 tion over one-fourth of the human race-
 normal relations with the great giant
 of Asia-makes sense. It not only opens
 up new opportunities for trade that will
 be beneficial to our farmers and to our
 businesses, but it strengthens the stra-
 tegic hand of the United States in Asia.
 For the past 30 years, we have dealt
 from a position of endemic weakness in
 Asia, which was one of the reasons for
 our involvement in two costly but in-
 decisive Asian wars. With the normali-
 zation of relations with Peking we have
 the opportunity to convert that position
 of endemic weakness into a position of
 strategic strength, because as our rela-
 tions with the Peking Government im-
 prove, the Soviet Union must take into
 account the new American position in
 Asia.
 So we have good reasons to believe,
 Mr. President, that not only the eco-
 nomic but also the strategic and politi-
 cal interests of the Unied States will be
 substantially improved by normalizing
 relations with the Peking government.
 By the same token, the Chinese have
 reason to believe that their interests will
 also be advanced. Why is Peking inter-
 ested in normalizing relations with the
 United States? Why did that Govern-
 ment make concessions to us it had never
 previously made in normalizing its rela-
 tions with other powers?
 The reason is that China has great
 respect for American technology. China
 expects that we can contribute to her
 own efforts to modernize. China also real-
 izes that there may be less danger of an
 attack from Russia as long as she main-
 tains friendly ties with the United States.
 There are many, many different consid-
 erations which led the People's Republic
 of China to decide to normalize relations
 with the United States. And all of the
 expectations and benefits they expect to
 derive from this new relationship depend
 upon continued peace between the main-
 land and Taiwan.
 Not only do we put Peking on notice
 from the very outs-eTthat American pol-
 icy rests upon the expectation of con-
 tinued peace, but we go on to say that
 we will furnish the people on Taiwan
 with sufficient arms for their defense in
 the future. In addition, we will view any
 use of force as a threat to the peace and
 security of the western Pacific area and
 of grave concern to the United States.
 So, Mr. President, on all counts this
 language  is  perfectly  adequate.  Pb is
 broader than the rather narrow obli-
 gation assumed under the old security
 treaty. It is terribly important that the
 Senate uphold this language and not
 tamper with it. If we adopt the amend-
 ment offered by the Senator from Illinois,
 we will jeopardize a relationship that
 rests upon an agreement reached between
 the President of the United States and
 the Government in Peking.
 Furthermore, if we adopt by a split
 vote the elanguage offered by the Senator

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE           March-8, 1 9 7 9 .
 from Illinois, what have we accom-
 plished? What kind of a message do we
 send? It is rather like the chairman of
 the board of trustees sending the hos-
 pitalized president of a corporation a
 get-well card, but by a vote of 6 to 5.
 Is that the kind of message we want
 to send to Peking-that we have nar-
 rowly approved an amendment which
 substitutes "security interests" for "grave
 concern"-and that nearly half of the
 Senate opposed it? I do not think that
 furthers our interest or our purpose or,
 indeed, the objectives sought by the Sen-
 ator from Illinois, himself.
 How much better to accept satisfac-
 tory language that does the job for the
 people of Taiwan, and was unanimously
 adopted by the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee in its final vote. That is the way
 to send the message to Peking that we
 want sent; namely, that it is our ex-
 pectation that there will be no resort
 to force in the future in the settlement
 of the Taiwan issue. For these reasons,
 Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate
 to reject the Percy amendment.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD.. Will the Sen-
 ator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield to
 the able majority leader.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 the Committee on Foreign Relations gave
 extensive study to the question of Tai-
 wan's future security. The bill that was
 originally submitted by the administra-
 tion was amended by the Committee on
 Foreign Relations to include language
 that leaves no doubt about our continu-
 ing concern for the well-being of the
 people of Taiwan. As the distinguished
 able chairman of the Foreign Relations
 Committee has so succinctly pointed out,
 the amendment agreed to in the commit-
 tee makes absolutely clear, as clear as
 the noonday sun in a cloudless sky, to
 the people of the Republic of. China that
 its new relationship with the United
 States' would be jeopardized seriously if
 there were to be force used against Tai-
 wan. As the chairman has pointed out,
 any effort on the part of the People's
 Republic to do this not only would jeop-
 ardize its new relationship with the
 United States, but it would be an ex-
 tremely costly and counterproductive
 venture.
 Now, Mr. President, the United States
 will always act in its own interest. The
 language clearly states that such action
 on the part of the PRC would be of grave
 concern to the United States. The Senate
 does not have to write any new language
 in this by way of an amendment to pro-
 tect the United States in its use of what-
 ever force it may need to bring to bear
 at some future time when its own secu-
 rity interest is at stake. We do not have
 to write that into this. That goes without
 saying. The United States always has
 that option.
 Mr President, I yield to the distin-
 guished Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I feel very
 heavy responsibility. I drafted the orig-
 inal Taiwan provision and fought for it
 in the committee. Then Senator CHURCH
 and I worked out this arrangement. The
 only possible change in it that could be
 made is the one that Senator PERCY
 suggests.
 I believe that General Jones answered
 that completely and the reason that I
 accepted Senator  CHURCH'S  modifica-
 tion-I used exactly the same words that
 are in this amendment originally. The
 reason that I accepted it was that I felt
 that Senator CHURCH was right, one, that
 we should not guarantee automaticity
 of response; and, two, that we should
 grade our national security interests
 based upon the facts of national security.
 He did not put in the first rank, like
 South Korea, the national security of the
 United States as it might be jeopardized
 by the use of force on Taiwan. But the
 provisions of the section as I drew it are
 very, very strong respecting the protec-
 tion to the people on Taiwan. Just in 1
 minute, they include conditioning our
 normalization on the nonuse of force;
 second, that if use of force were tried,
 a threat to the peace and security of the
 western Pacific area would be created.
 That is as much as a threat to the na-
 tional security interests of the United
 States, quite apart from the words,
 "grave concern." Third, that when we are
 implementing this, we are going to retain.
 our capacity to resist any display of
 force, and too, that it . is going to
 apply very carefully spelled out, to the
 Taiwanese.
 But it is very important to me, and
 this is what I got for it: one, we would
 not only resist any resort to force, and
 this is what I got, but other forms of
 coercion which would jeopardize the
 security, or the social, or economic system
 of the people on Taiwan.
 Now, that is the guts of it. That is what
 we are trying to protect. It is not the
 security of the people on Taiwan alone,
 it is their right to continue the system
 of government which has made them the
 second most successful people in the
 whole of Asia.
 Finally, we got another paragraph at
 the end of this section which said, "The
 United States will act to meet any dan-
 ger." That ties into the way we have
 amended paragraph 3, which is the sub-
 ject of what Senator PERCY wants to
 change. "The United States will act to
 meet any danger" described in that para-
 graph now sought to be changed, "in
 accordance with constitutional processes
 and procedures established by law,"
 which is exactly the way we approach
 NATO.
 Taking the whole section together, I
 felt it was stronger, more effective, more
 particularized and even better notice to
 the People's Republic of China than the
 way I had originally drafted it; but when
 I did, it did contain exactly the same ap-
 proach which is now sought to be rein-
 troduced. We have added those things
 which make it, in my judgment, even
 more effective.
 For those reasons, I ,am. compelled to
 oppose the Percy amendment. I thank
 the majority leader for yielding.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. Presi
 dent, I move to lay the amendment on
 the table.
 Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator hold
 that for a few minutes?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I cannot, for
 reasons which I shall be glad to explain.
 I shall withhold it for 1 minute to the
 Senator.
 Mr. HELMS. That will not be long
 enough. What was the agreement made?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. There is no
 agreement.
 Mr. HELMS. Is the Senator going to
 move ahead and move to table when
 other Senators wish to speak?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. There was a
 long time in here that I was asking Sen-
 ators to please, please speak.
 Mr. HELMS. This Senator has been
 sitting here a long time, but if the ma-
 jority leader has made that judgment,
 fine.

 lina for his usual courtesy and under-

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECO
 So the motion to lay on the table
 amendment No. 79 was rejected.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I move to reconsider the vote by which
 the motion was rejected., and I ask for
 the yeas and nays.
 The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a suf-
 ficient second? There is a sufficient
 second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD addressed the
 Chair.
 The VICE, PRESIDENT. The Senator
 from West Virginia.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I yield to the Senator from Idaho.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I hope
 that the Senate will reconsider the vote
 that has just been taken.
 Mr. HART. Mr. President,, may we
 have order in the Senate?
 The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate
 will be in order.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President,, the Pres-
 ident of the United States is- now in the
 Middle East, in an effort to win peace.
 I'think that a vote of this kind, occurring
 while he is in Cairo,, would send a very
 unfortunate message.
 Just before he left, yesterday,, the Pres-
 ident told me of his anxiety about Senate
 approval of this amendment. He said he
 hoped very much that the Senate. would
 not insist upon going beyond the under-
 standing that he had reached with the
 People's Republic of China, on the basis
 of which it became possible for both
 countries to normalize their relations.
 I know of the concern of the People's
 Republic of China about substituting the
 words "security interests of the United
 States" for "grave concern." The Am-
 bassador from Peking has raised this
 matter, asking me many probing ques-
 tions about our motives and purposes in
 connection with the committee's lan-
 guage.
 If it is the objective of the Senate to
 place in jeopardy the normalization of
 our relations. with mainland China, then
 let it be clear to everyone that this is
 what we are doing with the vote just cast.
 I ask the Senate, Why? The substitu-
 tion of these words does not improve by
 one iota the measure of assurance we
 give to the people on Taiwan respecting
 their future.
 This is a mischievous amendment be-
 cause it insists on the use of two words
 borrowed from our Mutual Security
 Treaty with Taiwan. It thus raises the
 whole question of whether we will keep
 faith with our commitment to Peking,
 which forms. the basis for our new rela-
 tionship with Peking,
 We are interfering here with what is
 regarded as an internal matter by the
 Chinese, not alone by Peking but by
 Taipei as well. Their proposition is. that
 there is but one China and Taiwan is
 part of that China. It is a proposition
 subscribed to not only by Peking but
 by Taipei.
 Now when we insert "security interests
 of the United States" we draw the Amer-
 Iran defense perimeter line between Tai-
 wan and the mainland.
 And I ask senators why do it? I ask
 Senators what greater assurance can be
 given to the people on Taiwan than that
 D - SENATE
 which is already contained in the lan-
 guage of the bill?
 Mr. President, before we decide upon
 the Percy amendment we should have a
 clear understanding as to the nature of
 the threat to which it is directed.
 Earlier in the debate, the Senator
 from Illinois and I agreed, based on the
 record that was made in the hearings
 before the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee. We agreed, first, that presently there
 is no intention in Peking to attack Tai-
 wan; second, that Peking lacks the mili-
 tary capability of conducting a success-
 ful attack upon Taiwan; third,, that if
 the policy in Peking were to change it
 would require at least 5 years for them
 to obtain the amphibious fleet necessary
 to launch a. successful attack upon Tai-
 wan; and fourth, that Taiwan today
 possesses the necessary defensive weap-
 ons to turn back any attack that might
 be directed upon them.
 Based upon those premises, what has
 the committee done to give assurances
 to the people of Taiwan as they look to
 the future?
 If Senators will examine section 114(a)
 beginning on line 25 of page 13 of the
 bill, they will see that it is the policy of
 the United States, which as a part of
 this legislation once signed by the Pres-
 ident, becomes the law of the land :
 (1)  to  maintain  extensive,  close,  and
 friendly relations with the people of Taiwan;
 (2) to make clear that the United States'
 decision  to  establish  diplomatic relations
 with the People's Republic of China rests, on
 the expectation that any resolution of the
 Taiwan issue will be by peaceful means;.
 (3) to consider any effort to resolve the
 Taiwan issue by other than peaceful means a
 threat to the peace  and security of the
 Western Pacific area and of grave concern, to
 the United States; and
 (4) to provide the people on Taiwan, with
 arms of a. defensive character.
 Now, Mr. President, these expressions
 of concern for the people on Taiwan are
 broader than any ever contained in the
 old mutual security treaty. Read the
 language of that treaty and you will see
 that it was confined to one thing, an at-
 tack, in which event it promised mutual.
 consultation in accordance with the con-
 stitutional processes of both countries.
 But this declaration promises close,
 extensive and friendly relations with the
 people  on Taiwan.  This declaration
 makes it clear that everything the Chi-
 nese expect to get from their new rela-
 tionship with our country is based upon
 our expectation that there will be con-
 tinuing peace between the mainland and
 the island.
 Do Senators want to send a message to
 Peking? What kind of a message do we
 send to Peking on the basis of this last
 vote? We are telling Peking that, a mar-
 gin of four votes, the Senate of the
 United States has decided that any fu-
 ture attack on Taiwan would be an at-
 tack upon the security interests of the
 United States. That is. like the board of
 trustees sending a get-well message to
 the corporate president saying, that,, "We
 want you to get well by a vote of 5 to 4."
 By four votes, the Senate practically
 split in twain. How can we send a clear
 signal that way? It is not one of unity
 but one of division, not the kind of unan-
 52313
 imous vote we had in the committee
 when we finally adopted the words now
 contained in the bill
 This is a pointless and self-defeating
 amendment to adopt. It does. not advance
 the. interests of the United States. It
 could put our new policy in jeopardy,
 and it does nothing for the people on
 Taiwan that is not equally well accom-
 plished by the language already con-
 tained in the bill.
 (Mr. STEWART assumed the chair.)
 Mr. CHURCH. Oh, it is political, I un-
 derstand that. But I think we should be
 concerned here with the fundamental in-
 terests of our country. For 30 years we
 have been pretending that the Govern-
 ment of China was located in Taipei; for
 30 years we have Unposed upon ourselves
 a position of endemic weakness,, because
 we failed to acknowledge the presence of
 the giant of Asia.
 That old policy engulfed us in two in-
 decisive wars in Asia, for which we paid
 very dearly. But, oh, we love our illu-
 sions, Mr. President, so much so that we
 were the last of the major nations finally
 to acknowledge the truth, that the Gov-
 ernment of China resides in Peking, and
 that it is in our national interest, as
 other countries have found it to be in
 theirs, to have normal dealings with that
 Government.
 Why put all of that in jeopardy be-
 cause of political considerations, parti-
 san considerations? i do know that the
 words we have added could do mischief.
 I do know they could put our new policy
 in jeopardy, and I do know that they do
 not add one iota to the assurances we
 give the people of Taiwan in the language
 of the bill.
 So I plead with the Senate to recon-
 sider this vote, and I do so in the name
 of a rational policy. We have been so long
 in need of one in Asia.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 LEvrx)'. The Senator from Ohio.
 Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.
 Since coming to the Senate I have ex-
 pressed my convictions' and concerns
 about Taiwan's security on many occa-
 sions and, as various officials can testify,
 to two administrations. Thus I do not
 oppose the Senator from Illinois' amend-
 ment because I am any less concerned
 about Taiwan than is he, or less con-
 cerned about the perception of a U.S.
 presence in East Asia, because I share
 fully his concern on these points.
 The reason why I oppose this amend-
 ment is because I feel there is a right
 way and a wrong way to send this mes-
 sage to all parties to this new normali-
 zation process, and to insure security. I
 think we will have chosen the wrong, way
 if we adopt this ameddment.
 This amendment does nothing. to ma-
 terially affect Taiwan's security. It pro-
 vides no weapons. Yet it creates a serious
 risk of the United States being pulled
 into a war not of our choosing. That is
 the important point about this language.
 it creates a serious risk of being pulled
 into a conflict not of our choosing.
 Should an incident like a raid from
 Taiwan or an overflight, whether inad-
 vertent or not, of PRC air space trigger
 a PRC reaction, we do not have Ameri-

 go beyond the language of the so-called
 Percy amendment, I deeply appreciate
 the fact that there is wide support de-
 spite varying gradations of support. Sen-
 ator HELMS' support for this amendment
 is meaningful because it is my under-
 standing that his own amendment goes
 substantially further, and that if the?
 Percy amendment fails, he might well
 carry forward with that amendment and
 press that issue.
 The question also involves how we feel
 about normalization, and we have differ-
 ing views on that. I have made it very
 clear that I strongly favor normaliza-
 ' tion of relationships, providing that
 every possible degree of assurance is
 given to the people of Taiwan, and pro-
 viding also that we state unequivocally
 what our own national interest is. Just
 as we expect China to forthrightly, hon-
 estly, openly, and clearly express their
 national interest, we also have that right,
 that duty, and that obligation.
 I am certain also that the People's
 Republic ? of China, particularly after
 Vice-Premier Teng's visit here and his
 personal discussions with the Members
 of the Senate, know how strongly the
 American people and the Members of the
 Senate feel on this issue. And though
 the executive branch of the Government
 did not want any changes whatsoever,
 Senator CHURCH and Senator JAVITS were
 able to convince the executive branch
 that it was essential and they put to-
 gether language that more clearly ex-
 pressed our point of view.
 As we all recall during the Panama
 debate, many of us indicated there was
 no way we could ratify that treaty with-
 out amending the language to take into
 account certain contingencies. The lead-
 ership of the Senate, Senators BYRD and
 BAKER, the majority and minority leaders,
 helped work out language that made it
 possible for many of us to vote for that
 treaty, though even then many in good
 conscience could not.
 I feel that it is necessary, just as the
 distinguished chairman and the ranking
 minority member of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee felt it necessary, to
 adopt language that more clearly ex-
 presses our views. I think it is necessary
 now for the Senate to modify the lan-
 guage adopted by the committee, and
 the modifications we have suggested are,
 in the judgment of many, very mild
 indeed.
 -- The implication has been made that
 the amendment before us would require
 the United States of America to act, or
 react, in case force was used. In reading
 ,the amendment, there is nothing that re-
 quires the United States to act. The
 amendment leaves open the option of
 action. It leaves it open completely. The
 amendment does not authorize the Presi-
 dent to take any action in the case of
 hostilities. It is very clear that we simply
 are sending a message, a more honest
 and meaningful message than in the lan-
 guage in the legislation before us.
 I cannot perceive how this amend-
 ment undermines anything. That word
 "undermine" has been used occasionally.
 The Senator from Illinois cannot see
 that it will jeopardize anything. It jeop-
 ardizes nothing. We have a responsibility
 to be clear in our statements. We have
 a responsibility to be honest with China.
 We have honest differences of opinion
 which we should express just as honestly
 as the Chinese express their opinions.
 They do not ever hesitate to lay it
 right on the line.
 The Vice Premier laid it right on the
 line to us here and we respected him
 more for speaking forthrightly to us and
 letting us know how he stood on certain
 issues.
 When he went to Tokyo he let us know
 through his conversations over there ex-
 actly how he felt about the way the
 United States had handled the Iranian
 situation.
 He let us know unmistakably what he
 intended to do in Vietnam. And though
 we expressed our grave concern or our
 deep concern, or however it was we
 wrung our hands about that, he said
 right here he intended to punish Viet-
 nam. He moved forthrightly to fulfill
 that pledge, and he did so, and he did it
 in a way that was rather impressive to
 the Vietnamese forces. The Chinese
 forces were very impressive in the way
 they administered that punishment.
 He was honest about what he intended
 to do. Certainly, I think we have that
 same responsibility.
 I respectfully suggest to the Senator
 from Idaho that it is in the U.S. national
 interest to state our security interests
 and not to mislead the Chinese. It would
 be wrong, in my judgment, not to tell the
 truth  and  adequately . express  how
 strongly we feel.
 The distinguished Senator from Ohio
 has said that in his judgment the use of
 the term "gravely concerned" adequately
 expresses how we feel, and adequately
 expresses what we might do.
 I would just like to go back into his-
 tory a little bit and read to the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Ohio what we
 have said as a country in the past.
 In 1956, after the Soviet Union inter-
 vened with force in Hungary, a State
 Department spokesman said: "The ac-
 tions of the Soviet Union are the cause
 of the greatest concern."
 Did that in any way inhibit or even
 impress the Soviet Union? Not one bit.
 They held their ground.
 In 1975, Secretary Kissinger said the
 Soviet introduction of military equip-
 ment into Angola and Cuban participa-
 tion in Angola are considered "a serious
 matter not compatible with the spirit of
 relaxation of tension." That was almost
 reassuring to our adversaries that the
 United States had rejected the possibil-
 ity of action.
 it is a serious matter. We have said that
 before. That may be a signal that we in-
 tend to wring our hands. We look on it
 with grave concern, but we do not really
 intend to do anything because they are
 not our security interests. Should any-
 one doubt that this Nation will consider
 action if its security interests are threat-
 ened? Is there any doubt that we should
 move in Europe at any time theinterests
 of the United States there are en-
 dangered?
 Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield
 for a question on that point?
 Mr. PERCY. I am happy to yield.
 S 2315
 ? Mr. BIDEN. Is the Senator equating
 our national interest in Taiwan as equal
 to that in Western Europe? Is the Sena-
 tor suggesting they are the same?
 Mr. PERCY. The Senator from Illinois
 is suggesting that the interests the
 United States has in a peaceful resolu-
 tion to the Taiwan issue, in a nation with
 which we have had a mutual security
 pact for 30 years, are greater than the
 interests we may have in some other more
 remote part of the world where we have
 not had that kind of close relationship.
 No, the Senator from Illinois, on a
 matter of priorities, would certainly put
 Europe ahead of Taiwan. He would put
 the Mideast ahead of Taiwan. And prob-
 ably Japan and South Korea ahead of
 Taiwan.
 Mr. BIDEN. I would hope the Senator
 would do that.
 Mr. PERCY. But the Senator from
 Illinois would feel that if there was a use
 of force-I have said many times on this
 floor that I do not anticipate at all the
 use of force-if there were a use of force,
 I would personally feel that something
 more than just an expression of grave
 concern and a verbal slap on the wrist
 would be required. This Nation should
 consider acting under those conditions. It
 would only be fair to notify the People's
 Republic of China ahead of time that we
 put a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan
 issue as a high priority.
 The Senator from Illinois put the ques-
 tion to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
 of Staff as to how he would look upon
 this matter. As I quoted earlier, General
 Jones replied, "I believe that an attack
 on Taiwan would be not only of grave
 concern but would impact on our security
 interests. There is no question about it."
 Would my distinguished colleague feel
 that there should be any question about
 it as to whether or not an attack by force
 on Taiwan would be contrary to the secu-
 rity interests of the United States of
 America?
 Mr. BIDEN. Did not General Jones
 also say that the impact of such an
 attack would not be significant to Ameri-
 can security? That its impact would be
 minimal? I do not have the language in
 front of me, but my recollection is that
 General Jones' comments were along
 those lines.
 Is it not also true that the language
 of S. 245 as it now exists does not pre-
 clude us from using force? We retain the
 option to determine how and when we
 would use force. Maybe I can repeat my-
 self to the Senator. He seems to have
 been occupied.
 Does the language of S. 245 as it now
 stands preclude the United States from
 ..using force? Do not we retain the option
 to use force, depending on the situation?
 I assume the Senator would not suggest
 that should the 12 million indigenous
 population of Taiwan rise up against the
 1 billion Chinese who run the mainland
 that we would send the U.S. fleet steam-
 ing in to take over. Or do my friends
 from Illinois and Ohio suggest that un-
 der those conditions we do move in?
 There are all kinds of circumstances
 under which we should have a variety
 of reaction options.

 CONGRIESSI ONAIL RECORD - SIENA'IIE           March 8, 1979
 I was just handed General Jones testi-
 mony. He said:
 It may be stronger but my problem with
 the threat to the security interests is that
 there is no qualifying factor there and that
 our security interests are less there than
 they are in other areas of ,the Pacific or other
 areas of the world. So I would be concerned
 about the implication being far greater than
 that intended.
 I cite that to set the record straight.
 I am infringing on the Senator's time.
 I have a good deal more to say about
 this if the managers of the bill will give
 me the opportunity, or when I am able
 to get the floor in my own right. I think
 the question here is whether or not we
 will face the political realities or con-
 tinue to debate the China question. I
 remind my friend from Illinois that
 when we were in grade school we de-
 bated about "Who lost China." I suggest
 today we never had China to lose it, and
 I suggest now we are about to begin a
 new debate. With these amendments
 such as Senator PERCY's, I suggest that
 the debate over China will begin anew.
 If the Senator succeeds with his amend-
 ment, we will be debating again "Who
 lost China." The Senator's amendment
 suggests that the United States, in effect,
 institute a two-China policy. That would
 be a sham. Those are not the terms we
 agreed to in the normalization proce-
 dure. That is what the issue is about
 today.
 Mr. President, I support S. 245, because
 it enables the United States to establish
 a creative new relationship with the
 people of Taiwan that assures that
 island's continued security and economic
 well-being without compromising our
 diplomatic commitment to Peking.
 How to achieve these twin goals has
 been at the heart of the issue of our
 China policy since 1972. How to be fair,
 how to shortchange neither mainland
 China nor Taiwan, is the problem the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee has
 just confronted, I think successfully. It
 is the crux of what has troubled the
 American people about the recent change
 in the direction of our China policy.
 There is a large body of opinion-both
 in the Nation and in this Chamber-
 that is skeptical about the good inten-
 tions of the Communist Government of
 China. Chinese leaders came to this
 country and denounced the Soviet Union,
 trying to persuade us that "the enemy of
 my enemy is my friend." Days after they
 returned to Peking, Chinese forces in-
 vaded Vietnam.
 Now, I do not approve of a leader of a
 country coming to our shores and de-
 nouncing a leader of a third country.
 Nor do I approve of military invasions.
 And I reserve the right to share my col-
 leagues' skepticism about the motives
 and intentions of the People's Republic
 of China. But I maintain that recogni-
 tion of the Peking government-the gov-
 ernment of nearly 1 billion people-a
 government that has been in power for
 nearly 30 years-in no way implies ap-
 proval of that government's every policy
 or of that government's social or eco-
 nomic system. What we are doing, is sim-
 ply recognizing that the government of
 Peking is the legitimate and legal gov-
 ernment of one-quarter of the world's
 population.
 What derecognition of the Govern-
 ment of Taiwan implies is not abandon-
 ment of an ally and friend. Neither my
 colleagues in the Senate nor the Amer-
 ican people should in any way infer that
 the American Government is no longer
 concerned with the peace and prosperity
 of that island's 15 million inhabitants.
 What the new relationship with the peo-
 ple of Taiwan signifies is that U.S. policy
 has finally come out from under the fig-
 leaf of political pretense. The recognition
 of Peking and the derecognition of Tai-
 pei brings our policy into the clear light
 of present-day reality.
 To put this diplomatic event into the
 proper context,.I think we should look
 back. We could look back to the Shang-
 hai communique of 1972. But for a mo-
 ment I want to look still further back-
 into what is for me history.
 Let us go I back to 1949. After the
 Chinese civil war in which the Commu-
 nists defeated the Nationalist forces of
 Chiang Kai-shek, the losers took refuge
 on the island of Taiwan, then called
 Formosa. This handful of Chinese Na-
 tionalists sheltering themselves on For-
 mosa, still maintained that their govern-
 ment was the legitimate government of
 the Chinese people. And' the United
 States joined them in that fiction.
 Because of the geopolitics of the early
 fifties, the United States, understand-
 ably, did not change this fiction. There
 was the Korean war. There was also the
 overpowering threat to U.S. interests
 posed by the Moscow-Peking alliance.
 During this decade of the fifties, there
 were many Americans who claimed that
 it was the U.S. Policy of the 1940's that
 "lost China" for us. The debate over
 who lost China raged for a decade. I,
 personally, do not believe that China
 was ever ours to lose. In my opinion, the
 real loss of China for the United States
 was the loss of contact with the main-
 land. The real loss of China for America
 was the loss of influence with the Peking
 government.
 Now, I will be the first to admit that
 it is easier to understand that loss today
 than it was 30 years ago. I refer to this
 history only because I believe that, after
 30 years of deliberate fiction, it is time
 to set our relationships with China and
 Taiwan straight. In fact, not fiction.
 We created that fiction of Taiwan. And
 we are willing to take the responsibility
 for it today. We will not abandon her.
 We recognize the fact of her economic
 prosperity and we will do everything we
 can to protect it. We recognize the dan-
 ger to her security and we will do every-
 thing we can to protect it. But we can
 no longer perpetuate the fiction of Tai-
 wan's political pretensions.
 The first step toward a realistic U.S.
 policy on China 'was taken by President
 Nixon in 1972. The Shanghai communi-
 que issued at that time stated that there
 is but one China. The communique never
 stated which was the legitimate one. But
 it recognized the political reality of one
 China.
 The brilliance of the Shanghai com-
 munique was less in its clarity than in
 its precise area of vagueness. Its bril-
 liance lay in what it did not define. It
 contained what lawyers sometimes call
 "creative ambiguity."
 While the credit for the initiative in
 a realistic China policy goes to a Repub-
 lican administration, there is little doubt
 of the courage of President Carter in
 concluding  that process  of  political
 reality.
 It is to the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee, however, that the final task
 was given. Because it is this committee,
 under its new leadership, that was able
 to flesh out, to specify and to amend the
 administration proposal. In a way that
 gives Taiwan a fair shake.
 And it is this same committee that has
 had the foresight to recognize that giv-
 ing Taiwan a fair shake does not mean
 that we create another two-China polit-
 ical faction to replace the old one. The
 committee was able to draft and pass
 legislation that is before us today that
 meets the objectives of U.S. policy. Let
 me say it more plainly-S. 245 serves the
 interests of both the United States and
 Taiwan.
 Mr. President, in the long run, the in-
 terests of both countries are best served
 by good relations between the United
 States and China. And the passage of
 amendments to this bill which would, in
 effect, create a second China would lay
 the basis for another 30 years of fiction,
 of illusion and of instability.  ?
 Therefore, Mr. President, I urge my
 colleagues-not to "lose China" a second
 time.
 Mr. PERCY will the Senator yield for
 a question?
 Mr. BIDEN. Yes. The Senator has the
 floor.
 Mr. PERCY. The Senator from Illinois
 appreciates the questions and the com-
 ments which were made, but I would like
 to point out as I have before that my
 amendment does not require the United
 States in any manner, shape, or form to
 use force. It simply leaves open certain
 options. With this amendment, we are
 retaining the same options the Chinese
 have retained We do not preclude op-
 tions, but we give a clearer signal than
 does "grave concern" that we intend to
 do something other than wring our
 hands.
 I know that the majority leader would
 like to make a motion, but the Senator
 from Illinois has' promised the senior
 Senator from California the right to
 speak at this time. If the motion will`.
 preclude the right of Senators from
 commenting at this time, would the Sen-
 ator withhold his motion?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 my motion would not preclude Senators
 from speaking on the amendment. It
 would riot.
 I 'ask ,unanimous consent that I may
 be permitted to withdraw the motion to
 reconsider.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 The motion to reconsider was with-
 drawn.
 Mr. PERCY. I thank the distinguished
 majority leader.

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 Mr. PERCY. The Senator from Illinois
 has not yielded the floor.
 Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the Sena-
 tor from California and I shall speak
 later. I thought since the motion was
 withdrawn, we could move on to some-
 thing else. I was going to call up an
 amendment. I yield the floor and shall
 wait until after the Senator from Cali-
 fornia has completed.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 if the distinguished Senator from Cali-
 fornia will yield, I say to the Senator
 from Illinois that I thank him for yield-
 ing. Perhaps we could reach an up-or-
 down vote on his amendment quickly
 after the Senator from California has
 yielded the floor.
 Mr. HAYAKAWA. Mr. President, the
 distinguished Senator from Idaho has
 said that the amendment offered by the
 Senator from Illinois undermines the
 commitment to the basis on which our
 relations with the people of Peking have
 been established. Perhaps it is an act of
 temerity on my part, but I should like
 to remind the distinguished Senator from
 Idaho that the President may be com-
 mitted to the basis on which our rela-
 tions with Peking have been established,
 but we in the Senate were not consulted
 as to that basis on which those rela-
 tions  were  established.  As  everyone
 here will recall, those relations were
 established in our absence and with-
 out consultation and on a date in
 which  consultation  was impossible.
 Hence, I cahnot see how we are similarly
 committed.
 This is the reason that many of us
 in this Chamber are adding amendment
 after amendment to the language of the
 Taiwan Enabling Act. This is only one
 of the amendments.
 Mr. President, I have heard a lot of
 talk about how the United States can
 maintain a' dual relationship with the
 two parts of China, and an analogy with
 Japan's success in maintaining such a
 dual relationship. If Japan can maintain
 nongovernmental relations with Taiwan
 at the same time as it maintains full
 diplomatic relations with the mainland,
 why cannot we do the same? That is the
 argument we frequently heard. What
 those who argue this position ignore is
 that Japan felt secure about this dual
 relationship, because the United States
 had a defense treaty with Taiwan. That
 protection to the peace of the Pacific and,
 therefore, that protection which Japan's
 trade with both parts of China enjoyed
 no longer exists at this moment. In short,
 Japan can no longer feel as secure as she
 did and what Japan will do about that
 fact, I do not know.
 I do know that the peace of the Pacific
 and the whole area is no longer as secure
 as it was when we had a defense treaty
 with Taiwan. I do not expect or hope
 ever to restore that defense treaty with
 Taiwan under present conditions. But
 the Senator from California does wel-
 come the wording of the amendment of
 the distinguished Senator from Illinois,
 since it spells out specifically the dangers
 involved in this new relationship that,
 at the same time, treats the two Chinas
 as one and also treats* the two Chinas as
 two. There are so many ambiguities in
 this proposed relationship that the Sen-
 ator from California, for one, fully in-
 tends to vote for the amendment offered
 by his distinguished colleague from Illi-
 nois (Mr. PERCY). In one respect, at least,
 those ambiguities will be reduced if we
 accept Senator PERCY'S excellent sug-
 gestion.,
 I thank the Chair.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I am ready to vote. I ask for the yeas and
 nays on the amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
 sufficient second? There is a sufficient
 second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, there are
 others who wish to speak.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from North Carolina is recognized.
 Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.
 Mr. President, I have listened with
 great interest to the comment by the
 distinguished chairman of the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Relations and others.
 I notice that the distinguished chairman
 began.his argument with the suggestion
 that the President would be embarrassed
 in his Middle Eastern trip if the Senate
 were to take the action of approving the
 amendment of the Senator from Illinois.
 I happened to think of a note that was
 left for me earlier this morning by a
 friend from North Carolina, who stopped
 by. I thought something of this sort
 might come up on the floor, and I had
 a young lady type it out. Let me read it.
 He said:
 One final note. I feel that the administra-
 tion will try to play on the Carter trip to the
 Middle East in its attempt to kill the Percy
 amendment. They will say, "Don't embarrass
 the President with this slap in the face just
 when he is trying to negotiate a delicate
 treaty, et cetera." They will claim that
 such a move shows the parties to the Mid-
 east treaty that the Senate and the Con-
 gress cannot be relied on to uphold the
 President's actions.
 Well, this friend of mine was cer-
 tainly prescient. He must have had a
 crystal ball in his pocket.
 He went on to say, with respect to his
 earlier comment:
 This is nonsense. Why? Because there was
 prior consultation with the Senate prior to
 the President's trip-the briefing of the
 committee, the  Begin visit, et cetera. There
 was none of that with Taiwan.
 Mr. President, that is it in a nutshell.
 The President of the United States has
 sent the Senate a scrambled egg and has
 said, "Now unscramble it." If he had
 conferred with the Congress, or even
 with the Foreign Relations Committee,
 the Senator from North Carolina does
 not believe that we would be in this fix
 this afternoon. Certainly. I take no
 pleasure in resisting the legislation
 pending before us, but I feel in good
 conscience that we must do something
 to strengthen the defense section. As my
 friend from Illinois has indicated, this
 is the minimum insofar as the Senator
 from North Carolina is concerned. I am
 happy to cosponsor his amendment. I
 S 2317
 think, as he has indicated, that we
 should go farther, but I am willing to
 compromise on this.
 In the comments by the distinguished
 chairman of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations earlier, he said, "What will we
 be telling Peking?" What will we be tell-
 ing Peking -by approval of what the dis-
 tinguished chairman called a frivolous
 amendment by the distinguished Senator
 from Illinois?
 I think the more important question is,
 what will we be telling such friends as
 we have left around the world if we do
 not do this? I might raise another ques-
 tion, what was the President telling the
 Congress when he declined to confer with
 Congress when he made the judgment to
 dump Taiwan and embrace Red China?
 There are all sorts of questions that we
 can raise and which we should raise. I,
 for one, do not feel that we should in-
 dulge in obfuscation. We ought to lay it
 all out to be seen.
 The statement was made earlier, and I
 think by the distinguished chairman,
 that General Jones had assured the com-
 mittee that Red China does not have the
 capability to boycott, blockade Taiwan.
 Well, not quite, Mr. President, not
 quite.
 Actually, what General Jones said
 was, and I will read from page 747:
 Now that does not mean that they could
 not develop that capability over a number
 of months, of course.
 Obviously, they can. And in a number
 of months, not years.
 Now, I wish to offend no one, but the
 administration has deliberately refused
 access to a report that I personally know
 is in existence and which was requested
 from a number of administration wit-
 nesses during the course of the commit-
 tee's deliberation of this bill. It is now in
 my possession. It is a secret report, en-
 titled "Consolidated Guidance Study No.
 9, Taiwan's Military Requirements in a
 Post-Normalization Environment." It was
 made available to me today by a con-
 cerned citizen. In this report, high Pen-
 tagon officials are on record as knowing
 that Taiwan could be blockaded.
 I am not going to quote from that
 secret report. I am not that kind of Sen-
 ator. But if the distinguished chairman
 or any other Senator wants to see it, I
 will be glad to show it.'
 But, in any case, Mr. President, it
 seems to me to be rather ominous that
 this Senate should be debating the secu-
 rity of Taiwan this particular week, be-
 cause it was exactly 20 years ago this
 week that the Dalai Lama in Tibet was
 forced to submit to Peking's terms with
 respect to Tibet's future status.
 On March 9, 1959, the Dalai Lama at-
 tended a meeting of the Chinese State
 Council and was forced to accept various
 decrees including the establishment of a
 so-called "Preparatory Committee for
 the Autonomous Region of Tibet."
 This action led to the exodus from
 Tibet of the Dalai Lama afid many of his
 followers. From exile in India the Dalai
 Lama protested in April 1959 that in
 practice "decisions in all important mat-
 ters were made by the Chinese author-
 ities."

 S2318                 CONGRESSIONAL RECQ
 The Dalai Lama did not return to
 Tibet, but has remained in exile. Instead
 the Peking authorities proceeded with
 the communization of Tibet that led to
 another revolt by the people of Tibet.
 And all this was,done under the author-
 ity of the agreement with Tibet signed in
 1951 that allegedly granted them re-
 gional autonomy.
 In a 17-point agreement signed in 1951
 the PRC purportedly granted to Tibet
 regional autonomy. Does that sound
 familiar? It is instructive today to look
 at the language of this signed agreement
 by Peking and then the following his-
 torical record of ruthless suppression of
 the people of Tibet that led to the exo-
 dus of the Dalai Lama and many of his
 followers.
 It is important to note especially arti-
 cles 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this agreement; par-
 ticularly as we now listen to supposedly
 soothing words  of Teng  Hsiao-ping
 about the future status of Taiwan. His
 are only words; Peking had a written
 agreement with Tibet' and it was -Chou
 En-lai,' Teng's spiritual predecessors,
 who played a large role in "negotiating"
 this agreement.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the terms of this agreement be
 printed in the RECORD, 'that the brief
 chapter on the 1959 uprising in the book
 "Revolt in Tibet" be included, and the
 statement from exile of the Dalai Lama.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 APPENDIX I
 Agreement of Measures for the Peaceful
 Liberation of Tibet (17-point.Agreement of
 May 23, 1951) 1
 The Tibetan nationality is one of the na-
 tionalities with a long history within the
 boundaries of China and, like many other
 nationalities, it has done its glorious duty
 'in the course of creation and development of
 the great Motherland. But, over the last 100
 years or more, imperialist forces penetrated
 into China and in consequences also pene-
 trated into the Tibetan region and carried
 out all kind of deceptions and provocations.
 Like previous reactionary Governments, the
 Kuomintang reactionary Government con-
 tinued to carry out a policy of oppression
 and sowing dissension among the nationali-
 ties, causing division and disunity among the
 Tibetan people.  The  local  government of
 Tibet did not oppose the imperialist deception
 and provocation and adopted an unpatriotic
 attitude towards the great Motherland. Under
 such conditions the Tibetan nationality and
 people were plunged into the depths of en-
 slavement and sufferings. In 1949 basic vic-
 tory was achieved on a nation-wide scale in
 the Chinese people's war of liberation; the
 common domestic enemy of all nationali-
 ties-the Kuomintang reactionary Goevrn-
 ment-the aggressive imperialist forces-was
 driven out. On this basis the founding of the
 People's  Republic  of  China  (CPR)  and
 (CPG) was announced.
 In  accordance    with  the   Common  Pro-
 1 The full text of the 'Agreement of the
 Central People's Government (CPG) and the
 local Government of Tibet on measures for
 the peaceful liberation of Tibet', was signed
 in Peking on May 23, 1951. The text herein
 was given by the New China News Agency.
 See also Concerning the Question of Tibet
 (Peking, 1959); pp. 14-10; Documents of In-
 ternational Affairs (London, Royal Institute
 of International Affairs), 1951, pp. 577-579.
 D - S ENATIE
 gramme passed by the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
 the CPG declared that all nationalities with-
 in the boundaries of the CPR are equal and
 that they shall establish unity and mutual
 aid and oppose imperialism and their own
 public enemies, so that the CPR will become
 a big family of fraternity and co-operation,
 .composed of all this nationalities. Within the
 big family of all nationalities of the CPR,
 national regional autonomy shall be exercised
 in where areas national minorities are con-
 centrated and all national minorities shall
 have freedom to develop their spoken and
 written languages and to preserve or reform
 their customs, habits and .religious beliefs,
 and the CPG shall assist all national minori-
 ties to-develop their political, economic, cul-
 tural, and educational construction work.
 Since then, all nationalities within the coun-
 try-with the exception of those in the areas
 of Tibet and Taiwan-have gained libera-
 tion. Under the unified leadership of the CPG
 and the direct leadership of higher levels of
 people's governments, all national minorities
 have fully enjoyed the right of national
 equality and have exercised, or are exercising,
 national regional autonomy.
 In order that the influences of aggressive
 imperialist forces in Tibet might be suc-
 cessfully eliminated, the unification of the
 territory and sovereignty of the CPR ac-
 complished,  and  national  defence  safe-
 guarded;  in order that the Tibetan na-
 tionality and people might be freed and re-
 turn to the big family of the CPR to enjoy
 the same rights of national equality as all
 other nationalities in the country and de-
 velop their political, economic, cultural and
 educational work, the CPG, when it ordered
 the  People's  Liberation  Army  (PLA)  to
 march into Tibet, notified the local govern-
 ment of Tibet to send delegates to the cen-
 tral authorities to conduct talks for the
 conclusion of an agreement on measures for
 the peaceful liberation of Tibet. At the lat-
 ter part of April 1951 the delegates with full
 powers of the local government of Tibet
 arrived in Peking. The CPG appointed rep-
 resentatives with full power to conduct talks
 on a friendly basis with the delegates with
 full powers of the local government of Tibet.
 As a result of the talks both parties agreed
 to establish this agreement and ensure that
 it be carried into effect.
 (1) The Tibetan people shall unite and
 'drive out Imperialist aggressive forces from
 Tibet; the Tibetan people shall return to
 the big family of the Motherland-the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China.
 (2) The local Government of Tibet shall
 actively assist the PLA to enter Tibet and
 consolidate the national defences.
 (3) In accordance with the policy towards
 nationalities laid down in the Common Pro-
 gramme of the CPPCC, the Tibetan people
 have the right of exercising national region-
 al autonomy under the unified leadership
 of the CPO.
 (4) The central authorities will not alter
 the exsiting political system in Tibet. The
 central authorities also will not alter the
 established status functions and powers of
 the Dalai Lama. Officials of various ranks
 shall hold offices as usual.
 (5) The established status; functions and
 powers of the Panchen Ngoerhtehni (Lama)
 shall be maintained.
 (6)  By the established status, functions
 and powers of the Dalai Lama and of the
 Panchen Ngoerhtehni are meant the status,
 functions and powers of the thirteenth Dalai
 Lama and of the ninth Panchen Ngoerhteh
 .ni when they were in friendly and amicable
 relations with each other.
 (7) The policy of freedom of religious be-
 lief laid down in the Common Programme
 of the CPPCC shall be carried out. The reli-
 gious beliefs, customs and habits of the
 Tibetan people shall be respected and lame
 March 8, 1979
 monasteries shall be protected. The cen-
 tral authorities will not effect a change in
 the income of the monasteries.
 (8) Tibetan troops shall be reorganised
 step by step into the PLA and become a
 part of the national defence forces of the
 CPR.
 (9) The spoken and written language and
 school education of the Tibetan nationality
 shall be developed step by step in accord-
 ance with the actual condition in Tibet.
 (10)  Tibetan agriculture, livestock-rais-
 ing, industry and commerce shall be devel-
 oped step by step in accordance with the
 -actual condition in Tibet.
 (11) In matters related to various reforms
 in Tibet, there will be no compulsion on the
 part of the central authorities. The local
 Government of Tibet should carry out re-
 forms of its own accord and, when the peo-
 ple raise demands for reform, they shall be
 settled by means of consultation with the
 leading personnel of Tibet.
 (12) In so far as former pro-imperialist
 and pro-Kuon  intang  officials  resolutely
 sever relations with imperialism and the.
 Kumintang and do not engage in sabotage
 or resistance, they may continue to hold
 office irrespective of their past.
 (13) The PLA entering Tibet shall abide
 by all the above mentioned policies and shall
 also be fair in all buying and selling and
 shall not arbitrarily take a needle or thread
 from the people.
 (14)  The  CPG  shall  have  centralized
 handling of all external affairs of the area
 of Tibet; and there will be peaceful co-exist-
 ence with neighbouring countries and estab-
 lishment and development of fair commer-
 cial and trading relations with them on the
 basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual
 respect for territory and sovereignty.
 (15) In order to ensure the implementa-
 tion of this agreement, the CPG shall set up
 a Military and Administrative Committee
 and a Military Area HQ in Tibet and-apart
 from the personnel sent there by the CPG-
 shall absorb as many local Tibetan personnel
 as possible to take part in the work. Local
 Tibetan personnel taking part in the Mili-
 tary and Administrative Committee may in-
 clude patriotic elements from the local Gov-
 ernment of Tibet, various districts and vari-
 ous  principal  monasteries;  the  name-list
 shall be set forth after consultation between
 the representative designated by the CPG
 and various quarters concerned and shah
 be submitted to the GPO for appointment.
 (16) Funds needed by the Military and Ad-
 ministrative Committee, the Military Area
 HQ and the PLA entering Tibet shall be
 provided by the CPG. The local Government
 of Tibet should assist the PLA in the pur-
 chase and  transport of  food, fodder and
 other daily necessities.
 (17) This agreement shall come into force
 immediately after signatures and seals are
 affixed to it.

 establishing the relations between China
 and. India, concerning Tibet, on a new basis".
 The Agreement laid down five broad prin-
 ciples in addition to the liquidation of the.
 Indian claims:
 According to the Agreement India accept-
 ed the principle that Tibet constituted an
 integral part of China, and argeed to wtih
 draw completely within six months the In-
 dian contingent that had been stationed for
 decades at Yatung and Gyantse. Peking, it
 was stated, would render all assistance and
 facilities in aiding the withdrawal of Indian
 troops.
 India agreed also to hand over all her
 property in Tibet to the. Chinese authorities,
 leaving questions of detail regarding cost and
 manner of payment to be worked out later.
 These properties included all the telegraph,
 public telephone, and postal establishments,
 together with their equipment, and twelve
 rest houses situated in various parts of Tibet.
 The Agreement, containing six articles, re-
 lated only to the two issues of trade and pil-
 grim traffic. China would be permitted to
 open three trade agencies, in New Delhi, Cal-
 cutta and Kalimpong, while India would be
 allowed to establish similar offices at Yatung,
 Gyantse and Gartok. All trade and pilgrim
 traffic should henceforth be. confined to six
 specific routes along the two-thousand-mile
 common frontier.
 The Trade Pact, as it was briefly called, was
 acclaimed in India and China and the five
 principles, outlined in. the preamble, which
 formed. the basis of the pact-mutual respect
 for each other's territorial integrity and sov-
 ereignty,  mutual  non-aggression?  mutual
 non-Interference in each other's internal af-
 fairs, equality and mutual benefit and peace-
 ful co-existence-became. known as "The
 Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence!,,, or
 "Parch Shila" In India, and were later taken
 up at Bandung as the. accepted policy of the
 Afro-Asian bloc.
 India gained practically nothing concrete
 from the pact. it was, rumoured. In Indian
 official circles that Mr. Nehru had hoped to
 obtain a. fixed delineation of the hitherto.
 vague border between Tibet and India, so
 limiting China's, exponsitionist ambitions.
 but if this .were the case it was another dip-
 lomatic defeat for India..
 In a, speech delivered in India's Lok Sabha
 on a debate on the international situation on,
 May 15;. 1954, Acharya T. B. Kripalani,, the
 Leader of the Opposition,, said:
 'Recently we have, entered into a treaty
 with China. This. treaty concerns the whole
 of. India.. It does not concern. a party or a
 Person, it affects us all., We feel that China,
 after It had gone. Communist, committed an
 act of aggression in Tibet. The plea is that
 China had the ancient, right of suzerainty.
 This right was out of date, old and anti-
 quated. It was theoretical;. it was never ex-
 ercised or very rarely exercised and even
 then in theory. It had lapsed by the. flux of
 time.... I consider this as much a colonial
 aggression on the part of China as any co-
 lonial aggression indulged in by Western
 nations. The definition of colonialism is that
 one nation by force. of arms and fraud occu-
 pies, the terirtory of another nation...  .
 Whether certain nations commit' aggression
 against other peaceful nations does not al-
 ways concern us. But in this case we are in-
 timately concerned,, because China has de-
 stroyed what is called' a buffer state. In Inter-
 national politics, when a buffer state is de-
 stroyed by a powerful nation, that nation is
 considered  to have committed  aggression
 against Its neighbours.... It is also well-
 known, that in the new map of China other
 border territories like Nepal, Sikkim, etc.,
 figure. This. gives us an idea of the aggres
 sive, designs of China...... do not say that
 because China conquered Tibet we should
 have gone to war with it. It was possible.
 But we did well in not going to war. But this
 does not mean that we should recognize the
 claims of China. In Tibet. We must know
 that it, is an net of aggression against a for-
 eign nation. It is as abominable as colonial-
 ism of any Western power...
 While Prime. Minister Nehru and Chou
 En-lat were, being  acclaimed throughout
 Asia for their magnanimous and enlightened
 approach to relations between nations; Tibet,
 which had been. the object of discussion and
 agreement, took a radically different view'.
 The growing bitterness against India felt
 by Tibetans of all classs since 1950, which
 they interpreted as cynical self-interest and
 betrayal, flared up Into public demonstra-
 tion inside Tibet.
 Posters were printed and pasted on to walls
 throughout Lhasa and copies were sent to all
 towns and monasteries in Tibet. The text
 was published in the Tibet Mirror, issued in
 Kalimpong on June 1, 1954:
 "To  Leaders,  Officials,  Monks,  Soldiers,
 Traders,. Craftsmen, Agriculturists, Nomads-
 the People of Tibet.
 'This' is to alert you to the great danger
 threatening our common cause, the inde-
 pendence of Tibet, regarding which I feel
 compelled to speak a few words.
 '1. The last edition of the Tibet Mirror
 carried translations of articles from Indian
 papers of a trade pact signed at Peking be-
 tween India and China regarding Tibet.
 There was a? statement that "discusion in
 Peking related' only to procedural matters
 and not to the substance of the  issue."
 Neither was there any mention of which
 particular treaty formed the basis of the
 talks. Further, no fun copy of the agreement
 was made public,
 T. Were the talks based on the Trade Reg-
 ulations of 1893 or. of 1908, both of which
 were mentioned in regard. to, the Peking
 Trade Agreement2? If so, it. is a violation of
 the Simla Convention of 1914 whereby both
 of. time, Trade: Regulations are declared re-
 voked. in Clause T.
 '3. The Peking Trade Pact refers to, Tibet
 as "an integral. part of China", and there. are
 many mentions of the "Tibet region of
 Chins.";, these being terms' unprecedented in
 the history of Tibet and also another viola-
 tion, of the terms of the Simla Convention,
 Clauses 3 and 9. of which first of all recog-
 nized the mutual independence of Tibet in
 asmuch' as the Tibetan Government kept her
 existing rights; which until the time of the
 recent invasion. of Tibet included the man-
 agement of. her external affairs; secondly,
 guaranteed the! non-violation of Tibetan ter-
 ritory,. Great Britain and China agreeing to
 abstain from sending their troops, stationing
 civil-and military officers, or establishing col-
 onies. in Central Tibet.
 4. The Simla. Convention was signed by the
 fully empowered representatives of the three
 Governments of Tibet,. India and China,
 whereas the Peking Pact was concluded be-
 tween India. and. China, the wishes of the
 Government and. people of Tibet being com-
 pletely ignored. This makes it clear that
 China wishes not only to absorb Tibet but to
 destroy our culture, religion and eventually
 our race by intermarriage, as is shown by
 their moves to try to get in, in addition to the
 two hundred and twenty thousand in the
 Liberation Army already in Tibet, a further
 two, million Chinese for the so-called eco-
 nomic development of our country. It is only
 too, obvious how our two neighbours are will-
 ing,' to come to private arrangements in fa-
 vour of aggression so as to serve their own
 Inter-Asian imperialist policies.
 '5. Please read carefully the second Inde-
 pendent Treaty signed at Simla. between Ti-
 bet and the British. Government in India, on
 the same day, and Immediately after, the
 Tripartite Simla Convention, as it recognized
 not the autonomy but the complete Inde-
 pendence-of Tibet;. as follows:
 ' "Tine Government of China refusing to fix
 her official seal thereto and in default of
 S-2319
 which, all rights-, and privileges. claimed by
 the Government of China in and with regard
 to Tibet, are hereby declared revoked."'
 The- protest, circulating in Tibetan inside
 a closed Tibet, evoked no sympathy or re-
 sponse either in India or the outside world.
 What. was extremely significant about its
 widespread circulation inside Tibet was the
 fact that the anti-Chinese demands were now
 so numerous and strongly entrenched that
 such could now be' printed and distributed
 throughout, the country without detection of
 the organizers.
 The chief anti-Chinese organization in-
 volved in the demonstrations and pamphlet-
 eering was a group known as the Mi-mang
 Tsong-du (or People's Party). While national-
 ist and subversive; they limited themselves to
 public demonstrations against  unpopular
 Chinese Communist measures and took no
 part in violent activities, of any form. Notices
 appeared on the, walls of buildings overnight
 denouncing or mocking the Chinese occupa-
 tion, personnel; Chinese notices were torn
 down or besmeared with manure; Chinese
 parades or demonstrations were bombarded
 from densely packed. crowds with dried yak
 dung' and stones; or there were cleverly or-
 ganized 'silences'. When the, Chinese arrested
 some of the more prominent and handed
 them. over for trial to the Tibetan courts they
 were released shortly afterwards on 'insuffi-
 cient, evidence', or some other bland reason.
 At, their, own  demonstrations  they  could
 number four or five. thousand. people, and
 the Chinese. dared don no more than arrest
 some of the more extreme orators and even
 then, as? indicated,, only hand them over to
 the Tibetan courts, with. complaints.
 In. June 1954 the Dalai. Lama received an
 invitation from the Chinese. Government to
 visit Peking and other places in China. The
 invitation evoked an immediate protest in
 Tibet and there were many demonstrations to
 protest against the Dalai Lama leaving, the
 country, the general suspicion being that he
 would not; be permitted to return.
 In. addition to demonstrations the Mi-mang
 Tsang-d'u. in, Lhasa secretly organized a mass
 revolt on the day scheduled for the Dalai
 Lama's departure; when thousands of Tibet-
 ans. were to throw themselves in the Dalai
 Lama"s path so that- he, could not pass
 through them without, having to, walk over
 their bodies. The.? Chinese got word of their
 plans, and several days before the scheduled
 date of departure moved the Dalai Lama to
 a relative's: house and from there on his way
 to China.
 However, the Chinese were unpleasantly
 surprised by the intensity of the feeling
 shown by the Tibetans to their invitation to
 the Dalai Lama and gave strong assurances
 that he would be well, treated In China. On
 the other hand, it did not prevent them
 from engineering at least two attempts on
 the Dalai. Lama's life. on his way to China.
 On one occasion a bridge' mysteriously col-
 lapsed just after the Dalai Lama had crossed
 over;, and the Chinese blamed Kham bandits;
 and on another occasion a landslide almost
 carried the party away.
 The Panchen Lama, had also been invited
 to visit China at the same time. For some
 while the Chinese had been building up the
 Panchen Lama's Influence in Tibet, both to
 undermine the Dalai Lama's prestige and to
 seek to divide the: Tibetans into two camps
 over the centuries-old controversy so that
 they could be. dealt with more easily.
 After Britain, China and Tibet had signed
 the  Tripartite  Treaty  in  1914  and  then
 Panchen Lama, who was very pro-Chinese,
 was forced to flee in 1920 to China where the .
 Kuomingtang Party was emerging as        the
 new government. Right away the Panchen
 Lama. began scheming with the Kuomingtang
 officials to support him with money, arms
 and men, to re-enter Tibet, but the new Kuo-
 mingtang Government was in no position to
 indulge in.such adventures.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE            March 8, 1979
 In 1933 the Thirteenth Dalai Lama died.
 During his reign it had been virtually im-
 possible for a Chinese national, civil or mili-
 tary, to enter Tibet, but as it usually took
 several months or years to discover a rein-
 carnation  of the  Dalai Lama  the ageing
 Panchen Lama prevailed upon the Kuoming-
 tai g Government to assist him in 'liberating'
 Tibet. On this occasion help was given, and
 while the Chinese forces were converging
 on Tibet's eastern borders a Chinese good-
 will mission was sent to Lhasa to persuade
 a leaderless Tibetan Government to accept
 a permanent Chinese delegation in Lhasa on
 grounds of common cultural and religious
 ties. As a direct result of this offensive, in
 1935 a meeting was called in Lhasa and it
 was decided that the Panchen Lama should
 be allowed to re-enter Tibet accompanied
 by his household and a few followers, but
 before he could take advantage of this the
 Panchen Lama died in China.
 When the new reincarnation of the Dalai
 Lama was discovered in 1938 in Amdo Prov-
 ince a new reincarnation of the Panchen
 Lama was found in that same year and in
 the same province. The position of this re-
 incarnation, however, was still unsettled as
 there was a simultaneous discovery of two
 other claimants in Lhasa. According to cus-
 tom the authorities in Lhasa requested the
 Amdo claimant to appear in Lhasa for veri-
 fication of his claims, but the Chinese au-
 thorities, for obvious reasons of their own,
 refused to comply with this request and
 some years later, without consultation with
 Lhasa, officially installed their protege as the
 new Panchen Lama. When the Kuoming-
 tang Government was defeated and fled to
 Formosa the Chinese Communist Govern-
 - ment took over the care and training of the
 Amdo Panchen Lama.
 In 1950, 'at the request of the Panchen
 Lama', the Chinese ordered the People's Lib-
 eration Army into Tibet, and in 1951 the
 Panchen Lama was present for the talks
 conducted by the Chinese Communists with
 the Tibetan goodwill mission on the special
 initiative of the Peking Government. The
 pact  which  recognized China's suzerainty
 over Tibet acknowledged also the Amdo re-
 incarnation as the true Panchen Lama. In
 1952 the newly declared Panchen Lama, es-
 corted by a strong force of Chinese troops,
 entered Lhasa, and from that time the Chi-
 nese had made every effort to build him up
 politically, but the Tibetan Government and
 people, while accepting the installation un-
 der force of circumstances, refused to recog-
 nize him as anything more than a spiritual
 figure. The Chinese tried by every means to
 override the objections of the Tibetan people
 and on every public occasion introduced the
 Panchen Lama as an equal to the Dalai
 Lama.
 After being in China several months the
 Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama were invited
 to attend a meeting of the Chinese State
 Council on March 9, 1955, where they were
 forced to submit to a number of decisions on
 Tibetan affairs. One of these decisions was
 the establishment of a 'Preparatory Com-
 mittee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet'.
 The Committee consisted of fifty-one mem-
 bers, fifteen from the Lhasa administration,
 ten from the 'Panchen Lama's Bureau', ten
 from the Chamdo 'People's Liberation Com-
 mittee,' eleven from monasteries and 'Peo-
 ple's Organizations', and five representing the
 Chinese Government, with the Dalai Lama
 being named a chairman. It was announced
 that the members of the Committee were
 appointed 'with the approval of the Chi-
 nese State Council' and the three regions of
 Tibet were subordinate to it. It was also
 stated that the chief task of the Prepara-
 tory Committee was to prepare for regional
 autonomy in accordance with the provisions
 of the Chinese Constitution, the Agreement
 of 1951 and the concrete circumstances of
 Tibet. The first meeting of this Preparatory
 Committee was*held on April 22, 1956, and
 thereafter there were in the next three years
 twenty-seven meetings out of which the
 Dalai Lama was present at and presided over
 twenty-five. But on his arrival in India the
 Dalai Lama stated at Tezpur on April 15,
 1959, that 'in practice, even his body had
 little power and decisions in all important
 matters were taken by the Chinese author-
 ities'.
 In  China during the visit  of the two
 Lamas the Peking Government went out of
 its way to show preference for the Pan-
 chen Lama on every occasion, presumably to
 impress upon the Dalai Lama how they were
 prepared to treat those who co-operated with
 them. If this were so the rather naive policy
 had exactly the opposite effect, and as the
 Dalai Lama went about the country, saying
 the proper things prepared for him by his
 hosts but noting particularly their attitude
 towards religion, the complete absorption in
 ruthless materialistic policies, the cynical
 playng off of the Panchen Lama against him-
 self to further their own ends, he. came to
 certain very definite, conclusions in his own
 mind. He said nothing to anyone at the time,
 not even to Mr. Nehru, whom he met in Pe-
 king during the Indian Prime Minister's visit
 to China, and who asked him in a private
 conversation if there was anything India
 could do to help Tibet, and it was only later
 that I was able to find out his impressions
 from his family.
 Meanwhile  in  Tibet  the  Tibetans  were
 becoming uneasy at the unduly prolonged
 visit which seemed to confirm their suspi-
 cions that the Chinese were going to hold
 the Dalai Lama in China as a hostage. Dem-
 onstrations were organized in Lhasa by the
 Mimang Tsong-du demanding his early re-
 turn, and even in Kalimpong there was a
 mass protest and public prayers. From Tingri
 in West Tibet, an area noted for its fighters,
 several hundred Tibetans marched to Lhasa
 to add their voices to the general request and
 also threaten armed action if the Dalai Lama
 were not returned immediately.
 If the Chinese had ideas about the Dalai
 Lama they were quickly changed in view of
 this ominous reaction and he was per-
 mitted to return to Tibet.
 Shortly after his arrival in Lhasa evidence
 of his new attitude to Communist China
 began to appear, both directly and indirectly.
 Immediately there was a hardening of official
 opposition to Chinese proposals. The move by
 the Chinese to have Chinese paper currency
 substituted for the silver Tibetan currency
 was flatly rejected, and the offer of economic
 integration with China refused. The Chinese
 then countered with an order that only trad-
 ers with letters of credit issued by the Bank
 of China and negotiable in branches in India
 would be allowed to trade--and found them-
 selves with a monumental leakage of Chinese
 silver coins being smuggled into India. They
 failed to elicit any enthusiasm for their proj-
 ect and the-Preparatory Committee for the
 Autonomous Region of Tibet became increas-
 ingly exasperated by Tibetan excuses at in-
 ability to attend.
 On the 23rd day of the Tibetan fifth month
 (July-August) 1955 the Dalai Lama made a
 public speech in Norbulinka, the summer
 palace. After reviewing the history of Tibet
 and pointing out that when there was a
 balanced  emphasis  on  both  religion  and
 politics the country had prospered, but that
 when politics took prominence over religion
 to the exclusion of the latter there was na-
 tional deterioration, he went on:
 'At present and in the future we shall
 carry out many new changes both in our
 religious and political life, and this is the
 urgent task which faces us. But in what
 way can we make progress? Today our Ti-
 betan  people  are facing  many difficulties
 from every side. We have no strength of our
 own and we have no political experience.
 We have no means to progress in any way.
 It is for this reason that the Chinese Com-
 munists have sent their men here to help
 us in the reconstruction of Tibet. But we
 must recognize very clearly that the Chinese
 Communists have not come here to control
 us, or become our masters, or to oppress us.
 We should adopt a friendly attitude towards
 them.
 'If the Chinese Communists have come to
 Tibet to help us, it is moat important that
 they should respect the Tibetan  people's
 own social system, culture, customs and
 habits, and honour the wishes of the whole
 people of Tibet, and not obstruct or do dam-
 age to the high principles of our nation. If
 the Chinese Communist personnel in -Tibet
 do not understand the conditions, and harm
 or injure our people, you should immediately
 report the facts to the Government. The
 Government will certainly take steps to make
 them correct their ways. If the Chinese
 Communists do not correct their ways our
 Government can immediately ask for their
 expulsion.
 'I hope all our Tibetan people will take
 upon themselves the responsibility for carry-
 ing out the various tasks allotted to them.
 For example, if the members of a family can
 themselves control and carry out the affairs
 of the family that family may be said to be
 a self-managed family or an independent
 one. A country is also in the same position
 as a family. I sincerely hope that the officials
 of the Government and the people will stand
 at their posts, will remain determined in
 their attitudes, carrying out their responsi-
 bilities and using their full strength in per-
 forming their duties.
 'Today I am very pleased with the officials
 of the Government and the people and thank
 them for working extremely hard for the
 welfare of their district, Government and
 country. But there are some officials and
 people who have a very narrow outlook and
 cannot take a broad view of 'things. For
 their own selfish advancement and under the
 attraction of glittering gold they do not care
 for the good of the country and the people,
 they practice oppression and deceit, they
 give trouble to the people and harm the
 Government, and thus are responsible for
 great harm to the country. I would request
 such people to correct their former mistakes
 and, becoming new men, atone for their mis-
 deeds in the interests of the country and
 the people. Besides them there are some few
 people who disregard their national culture
 and history, consider themselves to be pro-
 gressive, and who have changed their ways
 to doing what they like in a very confused
 manner. I regard such ideas as mistakes.
 Progress cannot be attained suddenly in a
 confused manner  and must be attained
 gradually in an ordered way. Again, there
 are Government officials who are envious of
 each other, create conflicts and bitterness,
 and cannot cooperate with each other. Be-
 cause they fritter away their energies they -
 cannot carry out the work of the administra-
 tion effectively. I desire that they give up
 their selfish attitude and take a broad view
 of things, correct each other and become
 united together. Only by doing so can we
 create and develop our strength. For example,
 it is not possible for a single person to lift
 a big stone using his own strength, but if
 the strength of several people is pooled to-
 gether it becomes very easy to lift the same
 stone. This is a very simple example but I
 know that all of you will pay special atten-
 tion to this matter.
 'Tibet consists of Kham, Tsang, U and
 Amdo, and all consist of the Tibetan people.
 Their spirit and way of living have such
 intimate connexions that they cannot be
 separated from each other. I hope that all of
 you will deeply think over this matter, love
 each other, and be united with each other,
 and not become separated from each other.
 'Finally, I hope that the people of the
 whole of Tibet by their unity and co-opera-

 tion will increase our strength and put all
 their energies into the construction of a new
 Tibet based on the unity of political life and
 religion.'
 This outspoken speech was wildly acclaim-
 ed in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet for it
 marked the emergence of the Dalai Lama on
 the political scene in favour of a united
 'Greater Tibet' without Chinese occupation,
 and it immediately encouraged and strength-
 ened the hands of the anti-Chinese groups
 throughout the country.
 Two months later the Mi-mang Tsong-du
 came out publicly with an even stronger
 declaration.
 We Tibetan people make the following
 appeal because we oppose the Chinese Com-
 munists who are destroying all our customs
 and systems, and also.because of the com-
 plete breach of the Seventeen-Point Sino-
 Tibetan Agreements signed by them. . . .
 'But speaking about the present situation
 in Tibet we declare that our religiou is fac-
 ing a very grave crisis which has thrown us
 into the very deep valley of darkness and.
 destruction. The Dalai Lama. has been robbed
 of his political and religious powers.. The
 future of the Tibetan nation is facing as
 grave a danger as a candlelight in a severe
 storm. The root cause of this crisis is. the
 oppressive ways in which the Chinese. Com-
 munists have been forcing, Communist ideas
 upon the Tibetan people, the most deplor-
 able policy of violence practised by the
 Chinese Communists, and the failure of the
 Chinese Communists to implement any of.
 the promises made by them to the Tibetan
 people. In order to save our country from
 this dangerous future we have already, on a
 previous occasion, made a formal protest to
 the  Chinese  Government  and the Dalai
 Lama.
 'Formerly, under the Dalai Lama, there
 were Regents, Kashag and the, various other
 Government organizations which carried out
 the administration of the whole of Tibet.
 But since the occupation of Tibet by the
 Chinese Communists all the former organi-.
 zations of the Government have ceased to
 function and the Chinese Communists have
 established a large number of illegal orga-
 nizations in their place to carry out the
 administration.     . The Chinese Commu-
 nists have not only increased administrative
 organizations but they have also established.
 organizations such as the "Patriotic Youth
 League" and the "Chinese Schools", with the
 sole object of forcibly indoctrinating the
 youth of Tibet. in Communism, and thus, to
 destroy the culture and civilization of the
 nation. Moreover, in opposition to the will
 of the people the Chinese Communists have
 destroyed the social system of Tibet in which
 political and religious life are joined to-
 gether, and have also destroyed the religion
 of the Tibetan people. Therefore we, in the
 name of the people of Tibet, have come
 forward to appeal to the Dalai Lama. We
 request that the Dalai Lama stop the orga-
 nization of the "Patriotic Youth League",
 close the "Chinese Schools" and prevent the
 indoctrination of the Tibetan people in Com-
 munism by the Chinese Communists. We are
 now resolved not to accept the establishment
 of the proposed Regional Autonomous Gov-
 ernment in Tibet as we already have the
 Government of the Dalai Lama. At the same
 time we also request the Chinese Oommu-
 nist Military Representative in Tibet .to
 allow us to go. to Peking to lodge this pro-
 test. If the Chinese Communists disregard
 the people's wishes, and by force, oppression
 and violence suppress the earnest appeal of
 the people, we, in the. name of all the people
 of Tibet, are. fully resolved to shed our blood
 and sacrifice our lives to oppose the Com-
 munists and we shall d'efinitely' not co-
 operate in. any of the activities of the
 Chinese' Communists in Tibet.'
 TnE DALAI LAMA BEARS WITNESS
 (The Dalai. Lama has issued four state-
 ments which. have had worldwide publicity.
 The first went out from Tezpur, shortly after
 his arrival in India;  the second followed
 alomst immediately and was a refutation of
 Peking's charge that the Tezpur statement
 was issued under duress. The third was given
 to the press at, Mussoorie nearly two months
 later, when news that he was getting from
 Tibet had confirmed his earlier appraisal of
 the situation in his homeland. Frequent quo-
 tations from these statements appear in the
 texts that. follows; but the very obvious
 truthfulness of his testimony, his eagerness
 to have international inspection of the situ-
 ation in Tibet and his simple belief that "the
 truth shall make you free", make these the
 most important documents yet submitted to
 the world on the Tibetan Question.)
 TEEM DALAI LAMA'S STATEMENT IN TEZPUR, INDIA,
 ON APRIL 18, 1959
 It has always been accepted that the
 Tibetan people are different from the Han
 people of China. There has always been a
 strong' desire for independence on the part
 of the Tibetan people. Throughout history
 this has-been asserted on numerous occasions.
 Sometimes the Chinese Government has im-
 posed its suzerainty on Tibet and at other
 times Tibet has functioned as an independ-
 ent country. In any event, at all times, even
 when the suzerainty of China was imposed.
 Tibet remained autonomous in control of its
 internal affairs.
 In 1951 under' pressure of the Chinese Gov-
 ernment a 17-article agreement was made
 between China and Tibet. In that agreement
 the suzerainty of China was accepted as
 there was no alternative left to the Tibetans.
 But' even in the agreement it was stated that
 Tibet would enjoy full autonomy. Though
 the control of external events were to be in
 the hands of the Chinese Government it
 was agreed that there would be no interfer-
 ence  by the  Chinese  Government  with
 Tibetan religion and customs and her in-
 ternal  administration.  In  fact,  after the
 occupation of Tibet by Chinese armies the
 Tibetan Government did not enjoy any
 measure  of  autonomy, even  in internal
 matters and the Chinese Government exer-
 cise full powers in Tibetan affairs.
 In 1956 a preparatory committee was set up
 .for Tibet with the Dalai Lama as the Chair-
 man and the Panchen Lama as ' Vice-Chair-
 man and General. Chang Kuo-hua as the
 represetative of the Chinese Government.
 In practice, even this body had little power
 and decision in all important matters were
 taken by the Chinese authorities. The Dalai
 Lama and his government tried their best to
 adhere to the 17-article agreement but inter-
 ference of the Chinese authorities persisted.
 By the end of 1955 a struggle had started in
 Kham Province and this assumed serious pro-
 portions in 1956. In the consequential strug-
 gle, Chinese armed forces destroyed a large
 number of monasteries.
 Many Lamas were killed and a large num-
 ber of monks and officials were taken and
 employed. on the construction of roads in
 China and interference in the exercise of
 religious freedom. increased.
 . The relation of the Tibetans with China
 became openly strained from the early part
 of February 1959. The Dalai Lama had agreed
 a month in advance to attend a cultural
 show in the Chinese headquarters and the
 .date was suddenly fixed for the 10th of
 March. The people of Lhasa became appre-
 hensive that same harm. might be done to
 the Dalai Lama and as result about 10,000
 people gathered around the Dalai Lama's
 summer palace at Norbue Lingka and phys-
 ically prevented the Dalai Lama from at'
 tending the function.
 Thereafter the people themselves decided
 to raise a bodyguard for the protection of
 the Dalai Lame. Lerge crowds of Tibetans
 went about the streets of Lhasa demonstrat-
 ing against Chinese rule in Tibet. Two days
 later thousands'. of Tibetan women held
 demonstrations' protesting, aaginst the Chi-
 nese authorities,. In spite of this demonstra-
 ion from the people: the Dalai Lama and his
 government   endeavoured   to   maintain
 friendly relations with  the Chinese and
 tried to carry out. negotiations with the
 Chinese representatives as to how best to
 bring about peace in Tibet and assuage the
 people's anxiety.
 While these negotiations were being car-
 ried out reinforcements arrived. to strength-
 en the Chinese garrisons in Lhasa and Tibet.
 On the 17th of March, two or three mortar
 shells were fired in the direction of Norbu
 Lingka Palace. Fortunately the shells fell in
 a nearby pond.
 After this, the advisers became alive to the
 danger to the person of the Dalai Lama and
 in those .difficult circumstances it became
 imperative for the Dalai Lama, members of
 his family and his high officials to leave
 Lhasa.
 The Dalai Lama would like to state cate-
 gorically that, he left. Lhasa and. Tibet and
 came to India of his own free will and not
 under duress.   .
 It was, due to. the loyalty and affectionate
 support of his people that, the Dalia Lama
 was able to find his, way through a route
 Which is. quite arduous.. The route which the
 Dalai. Lama, took involved crossing Kyichu
 and Tsang-po rivers and making, his way
 through Loke. area,  Yarlung  valley ? and
 Psonadzong  before  reaching  the  Indian
 frontier at, Kanseymane near to Chuttanmu.
 On March 29, 19596 the. Dalai Lama sent
 emissaries to cross the Indo-Tibetan border
 requesting the government of. India's per-
 mission to enter India and seek asylum
 there. The. Dalai. Lama is extremely grateful
 to the people and government of India for
 their spontaneous and general welcome as
 well as asylum granted top him and his fol-
 lowers.
 India and Tibet have religious, cultural
 and trade links. over a thousand years and
 for the Tibetans. it has, always been a land
 of enlightment having given birth to Lord
 Buddha. The Dalai Lama is deeply touched
 by kind greetings extended to him on his
 safe arrival in India by Prime Minister
 Jawaharlal Nehru and his. colleagues in the
 government. of India. The Dalai Lama has
 already sent a, reply to this message of greet-
 ing.
 Ever since the Dalai. Lama entered at Kan-
 zeymane near Chuttanmu he has experienced
 in full measure the respect and hospitality
 extended to him, by the people of Kameng
 Frontier Division of the Northeast Frontier
 Agency and the Dalai Lama would like to
 ,state how the Government of India's officers
 posted there has spared ho effort in making
 his stay and journey through this extremely
 well-administered part of India as comfort-
 able as possible.
 The Dalai Lama will now be proceeding to
 Mussoorie which he hopes to reach in the
 next few days. The Dalai Lama will give
 thought to his' future plans and if necessary
 give expression to them as soon as he has had
 a chance to rest and reflect on recent events.
 His  country . and  people  have  passed
 through an extremely difficult period and
 all that the' Dalai Lama wishes to say at the
 moment is to express his sincere regret at
 the tragedy which has overtaken Tibet and
 fervently hope that these troubles will be
 over soon without any more bloodshed.

 STATEMENT BY THE DALAI LAMA MADE ON APRIL
 22, 1959
 On April 18, I issued a statement at Tez-
 pur. I did not wish to follow it up with an-
 other statement at this stage. However I have
 seen a New China News Agency report im-
 plying that I was not responsible for this
 earlier statement. I wish to make it clear
 that the earlier statement was issued under
 my authority and indicated my view and I
 stand by it. I am making this brief statement
 to correct the wrong impression created by
 the New China News Agency's report and do
 not propose to state anything more at pres-
 ent.
 TEXT OF THE DALAI LAMA'S STATEMENT OF JUNE
 20, 1959 AT MUSSOORIE, INDIA
 Ever since my arrival in India I have been
 receiving almost every day sad and distress-
 ing news of the suffering and inhuman treat-
 ment of my people. I have heard almost daily
 with a heavy heart of the increasing agony
 and affliction, their harassment and perse-
 cution and of the terrible deportation and
 execution of innocent men. These have made
 me realize forcibly that the time has mani-
 festly arrived when in the interests of my
 people and religion and to save them from
 the danger of near annihilation; I must not
 keep silent any longer but must frankly and
 plainly tell the world the truth about Tibet
 and appeal to the conscience of all peace-
 loving and civilized nations.
 To understand and appreciate the signifi-
 cance and implication of the recent tragic
 happenings in Tibet, it is necessary to refer
 to the main events which have occurred in
 the country since 1950.
 It  is recognized by every independent
 observer that Tibet had virtually been inde-
 pendent  by  enjoying  and  exercising  all
 rights of sovereignty whether internal or
 external. -This has also been implicitly ad-
 mitted by the Communist Government of
 China for the very structure, terms and
 conditions  of  the so-called agreement of
 1951 conclusively show that it was an agree-
 ment between two independent and sover-
 eign States. It follows, therefore, that when
 the Chinese armies violated the territorial
 integrity of Tibet they were committing a
 flagrant act of aggression. The agreement
 which followed the invasion of Tibet was
 also thrust upon its people and Government
 by the threat of arms. It was never accepted
 by them of their own free will. The consent,
 of the Government was secured under duress
 and at the point of the bayonet.
 My representatives were compelled to sign
 the agreement under threat of further mili-
 tary operations against Tibet by the invad-
 ing armies of China leading to utter ravage
 and ruin of the country. Even the Tibetan
 seal which was affixed to the agreement was
 not the seal of my representatives but a seal
 copied and fabricated by the Chinese au-
 thorities in Peking and kept in their posses-
 While I and my Government did not vol-
 untarily  accept  the  agreement  we  were
 obliged to acquiesce in it and decided to
 abide by the terms and conditions in order
 to save my people and country from the
 danger of total destruction. It was, however,
 clear from the very beginning that the
 Chinese had no intentions of carrying out
 the agreement.
 Although they had solemnly undertaken
 to maintain my status and power as the
 Dalai Lama, they did not lose any oppor-
 tunity to undermine my authority and sow
 dissension among my people. In fact, they
 Compelled me, situated as I was, to dismiss
 my Prime Ministers under threat of their
 execution without trial, because they had in
 all honesty and sincerity resisted the un-
 justified usurpations of power by represen-
 tatives of the Chinese Government in Tibet.
 Far from carrying out the agreement they
 began deliberately to pursue a course of pol-
 icy which was diametrically opposed to the
 terms and conditions which they had them-
 selves laid down. Thus commenced a reign
 of terror which finds few parallels in the
 history of Tibet. Forced labour and compul-
 sory exactions, a systematic persecution of
 the people, plunder and confiscation of prop-
 erty belonging to individuals and monas-
 teries and execution of certain leading men
 in Tibet, these are the glorious achievements
 of the Chinese rule in Tibet.
 During all this time, patiently and sin-
 cerely I endeavoured to appease my people
 and to calm down their feelings and at the
 same time tried my best to persuade the
 Chinese authorities in Lhasa to adopt a
 policy of conciliation and friendliness. In
 spite of repeated failures I persisted in this
 policy till the last day when it became im-
 possible for me to render any useful service
 to my people by remaining in Tibet. It is
 in these circumstances that I was obliged
 to leave my country in order to save it from
 further danger and disaster.
 I wish to make it clear that I have made
 these assertions against. the Chinese officials
 in Tibet in the full knowledge of their grav-
 ity because I know them to be true. Perhaps
 the Peking Government is not fully aware of
 the facts of the situation.
 But if it is not prepared to accept these.
 statements let it agree to an investigation on
 the point by an international commission.
 On our part I and my Government will
 readily agree to abide by the verdict of such
 an impartial body.    '
 It.is necessary for me to add that before I
 visited India in 1956 it had become increas-
 ingly clear to me that ? my policy of amity
 and tolerance had totally failed to create any
 impression on the representatives of the
 Chinese Government in Tibet.
 Indeed they had frustrated every measure
 adopted by me to remove the bitter resent-
 ment felt by my people and to bring about
 a peaceful atmosphere in the country for the
 purpose of carrying out the necessary re-
 forms. As I was unable to do anything for
 the benefit of my people I had practically
 made up my mind when I came to India not
 to return to Tibet until there was a manifest
 change  in  the  attitude  of the  Chinese
 authorities. I therefore sought the advice of
 the Prime Minister of India who has always
 shown me unfailing kindness and considera-
 tion. After his talk with the Chinese Prime
 Minister and on the strength of the assur-
 ances given by him on behalf of China, Mr.
 Nehru advised me to change my decision.
 I followed his advice and returned to Tibet
 in the hope that conditions would change
 substantially for the better and I have no
 doubt that my hopes would have been real-
 ized if the Chinese authorities had on their
 part carried out the assurances which the
 Chinese Prime Minister had given to the
 Prime Minister of India.
 It was, however, painfully clear soon after
 my return that the representatives of the
 Chinese GovernmentC had no intention to
 adhere to their promises. The natural and
 inevitable  result  was  that  the  situation
 steadily grew worse until it became impos-
 sible to control the spontaneous upsurge of
 my people against the tyranny. and oppres-
 sion of the Chinese authorities.
 At this point I wish to emphasize that I
 March 8, 1979
 and my Government have never been op-
 posed to the reforms which are necessary
 in the social, economic and political systems.
 prevailing in Tibet.
 We have no desire to disguise the fact that
 ours is an ancient society and that we must
 introduce immediate changes, in the inter-
 ests of the people of Tibet. In fact, during'
 the last nine years several reforms were pro-
 posed by me and my Government but every
 time these measures were strenuously op-
 posed by the Chinese in spite of popular de-
 mand for them, with the result that nothing
 was done for the betterment of the social
 and economic conditions of the people.
 In particular it was my earnest desire that
 the system of land tenure should be radically
 changed without further delay and the large
 landed estates acquired by the State on pay-
 ment                                                                                                              of  compensation  for  distribution
 amongst the tillers of the soil. But the Chi-
 nese authorities deliberately put every ob-
 stacle in the way of carrying out this just
 and reasonable reform. I desire to lay stress
 on the fact that we, as firm believers in
 Buddhism,  welcome change and progress
 consistently with the genius of our people
 and the rich tradition of our country.
 But the people of Tibet will stoutly resist
 any victimization, sacrilege and plunder in
 the name of reforms-a policy which is now
 being enforced by the representatives of the
 Chinese Government in Lhasa.
 I have attempted to present a clear and
 unvarnished picture of the situation in Tibet.
 I have endeavoured to tell the entire civilized
 world the real truth about Tibet, the truth
 which  must  ultimately  prevail,  however
 strong the forces of evil may appear to be
 today. I also wish to declare that we, Budd-
 hists, firmly and steadfastly believe in peace
 and desire to live in peace with all the peo-
 ples and countries of the world. Although
 recent actions and policies of the Chinese au-
 thorities in Tibet have created strong feel-
 ings of bitterness and resentment against
 the Government of China, we Tibetans, lay
 and monk alike,?do not cherish any feelings
 of enmity and hatred against the great Chi-
 nese people.
 We wish to live in peace and ask for peace
 and goodwill from all the countries of the
 world. I and my Government are, therefore
 fully prepared to welcome' a peaceful and
 amicable solution of the present tragic prob-
 lem, provided that such a solution guarantees
 the preservation of the rights and powers
 which Tibet has enjoyed and exercised with-
 out any interference prior to 1950.
 We must also insist on the creation of a
 favourable climate by the immediate adop-
 tion of the essential measures as a condition
 precedent to negotiations for a peaceful set-
 tlement. We ask for peace and for a peace-.
 ful settlement but we must also ask for the
 maintenance of the status and the rights of
 our State and people. .
 To you gentlemen of the Press I and my
 people owe a great debt of gratitude for all
 that you have done to assist. us, in our strug-
 gle for survival and freedom. Your sympathy
 and  support  has  given  us  courage  and
 strengthened our determination. I confi-
 dently hope that you will continue to lend
 that weight of your influence to the cause of
 peace and freedom for which the people of
 Tibet are fighting today.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, some peo-
 ple are saying "Why, Senator, do you
 bring all this up?"
 Well,' if we do not learn from history,
 we are going to remain ignorant. If we
 do not ' know now what we are dealing
 with and if we do not describe. It clearly,
 then we deserve what we will get.
 . But the problem is that our friends
 and allies on Taiwan are going to be
 getting something they do not deserve.

 March 8, 1979           CONGRESSIONAL ' RECORD - SENATE
 I repeat that it is important to note
 especially articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the
 agreement I referred to' a moment ago,
 the so-called the Agreement of Measures
 for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,
 particularly as we now listen to sup-
 posedly soothing words about how we
 have taken care of everything.
 After all, we had that cuddly little
 panda bear Vice President Teng here not
 long ago, and we fawned over him-
 about as. cute and cuddly as a rabid
 panda bear.
 But when are we going to learn what
 we are dealing with, Mr. President, and
 when are we going to start acting like
 Americans?
 I find myself more and more appalled
 as we back up and back up and say,
 "Oh, we must not offend this Communist
 nation, or that one, we must appease and
 we must coexist."
 Mr. PERCY. Will the Senator yield
 for a question?
 Mr. HELMS. Yes.
 Mr. PERCY. The distinguished Sena-
 tor from North Carolina used a phrase,
 "When are we going to start acting like
 Americans."
 That brings to mind, I would tend to
 think, the times we have really defined
 our national interests, we have really
 stood for something, and our standing
 for something made a difference.
 Mr. HELMS. Exactly.
 Mr. PERCY. in human history.
 Mr. HELMS. The Senator is exactly
 right.
 Mr. PERCY. In the history of the
 world as to whether we have a free
 Europe. Our standing for something
 could make a difference as to whether
 there is an Israel or not.
 I think the problem is the U.S. decline
 in the opinion of the world. It is because
 we have not acted as the world has
 learned to respect Americans for acting
 in the past.
 It brings to mind what kind of develop-
 ment we are going to have in the Gulf
 area now. We have a pattern developing
 in the Gulf area.
 South Yemen, moved from being a
 British colony, oriented in and tipped
 heavily toward the Labor Party unions,
 to what is now classified as Marxist.
 North Yemen has had three presidents in o
 the last 2 years, two of them assassinated.
 The feeling is rather strong that the
 South Yemenites had something to do
 with at least one of those assassinations.
 They want to change the North Yemen
 Government. They want to, just like
 North Vietnam, just like North Korea,
 they want to unify it, the Yemenites, and
 bring them all together under one flag,
 as long as it is red.
 Mr. HELMS. That is right.
 Mr. PERCY. They are very clear about
 what they want to do.
 Mr. HELMS. Once again the distin-
 guished Senator is right.
 Mr. PERCY. And if they cannot get
 it by killing the chief executive officers
 of the country, then they start harass-
 ing him in three different places on the
 borders, as they are doing right at this
 very minute.
 Now, the Soviet Union. is not equiv-
 ocating about what they are doing.
 They are supplying equipment, man-
 power, and training.
 The Government of North Yemen has
 a large population, 61/2 million. But of
 that, a million are in Saudi Arabia.
 What would happen if South Yemen
 took over North Yemen? What would
 happen? The men up there would be
 held  hostage  because their  families
 would be down in North Yemen and
 the men are up in Saudi Arabia.
 This would cause concern on the part
 of the Saudi Arabians because they also
 saw Afganistan fall. They see the begin-
 ning of, a pattern, and they are worried
 about what we are going to do. They
 wonder when we are going to start act-
 ing like Americans.
 Are our vital interests concerned in
 the gulf area? You bet they are.
 Mr. HELMS. You bet they are.
 Mr. PERCY. This country can be
 brought to its knees economically over-
 night, and do not think our adversaries
 do not have that in mind.
 Khrushchev  said  quite  honestly,
 "We're going to bury you." He did not
 mean they are going to take the risk of
 fighting us. They have been through a
 war. They lost 20 million people. They
 found a much easier way to do it. It is
 to just create a little chaos. A little
 trouble starts in Iran-throw in the
 chaos,  ferment  the  thing.  Get  the
 Cubans to do it. After all, they are send-
 ing a million dollars a day to them-
 eating all that sugar, smoking all those
 cigars. Why not have the Cubans do,
 something for them?
 So they are waiting around in South
 Yemen to see whether they are needed.
 They are down there training forces in
 South Yemen today. When are we go-
 ing to start acting like Americans?
 All the people in the world are stand-
 ing there waiting to see what the United
 States of America is going to do in the
 Middle East, in the Persian Gulf, in the
 Indian Ocean, and in Europe. The Peo-
 ple's Republic of China has criticized us
 for not fighting, in a sense, for what we
 believe in and for what they conceive to
 be our mutuality of interests, including
 our deep mutual concern about the in-
 tentions and the capabilities of the
 Soviet Union. Therefore, I think they
 will understand if we make it very clear
 how we feel about Taiwan, how we feel
 about these 17 million people, how we
 have had for 30 years, how we feel about
 the representations we have made: that
 we intend to keep up the cultural and
 educational exchanges, that we intend
 to keep up Taiwan's defense capability.
 I wonder whether I can read some-
 thing to my distinguished colleague.
 This is what the President of the United
 States has said. I read now from the
 Presidential document for the week end-
 ing Friday, February 16, 1979, put out
 by the White House, the administration
 of Jimmy Carter, an interview with the
 President. This is what the President
 said about this issue, and I quote
 directly: .
 There's nothing to prohibit a future Pres-
 ident or a future. Congress, if we feel that
 Taiwan is unnecessarily endangered, from
 interposing the. American Pacific Fleet be-
 tween the island and the Mainland. And
 S 2323
 there's certainly nothing to prevent a future
 President or Congress from even going to
 war, if they choose, to protect the people
 of Taiwan, or to protect any other people
 in the country [world] that we look on with
 favor. So, we still have complete flexibility
 to deal with that kind of conjectural possi-
 bility if we choose.
 When the President expressed himself
 forthrightly as to what options were
 available to the people of the United
 States, I did not hear the People's Re-
 public of China say that we had gone so
 far that. we had jeopardized. this rela-
 tionship. Not at all.
 We simply want to change a couple of
 words. The words "grave concern," his-
 tory has demonstrated, send one kind of
 signal-of inaction, wringing our hands,
 and doing nothing. We want to send the
 right kind of signal. It is not put in the
 strong terms that the President used.
 The Senator from Illinois used words
 so moderate that the distinguished Sena-
 tor from North Carolina feels that it is
 the absolute minimum we can do. We
 simply identify a peaceful resolution of
 the Taiwan issue as in our security in-
 terests.
 The Senator from Illinois stated this
 in open testimony at the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee hearings, and the origi-
 nal wording of the distinguished Sena-
 tor from New York was even stronger.
 On reflection, he felt that he should
 back off from that. I have many times
 commended him and Senator CHURCH for
 taking the initiative, the congressional
 initiative, and going much further than
 the   administration   had   originally
 thought acceptable. The administration
 will thank us some day, as they will for
 the congressional position with respect
 to the Panama Canal.
 When the distinguished Senator says,
 "When are we going to start acting like
 Americans?" we had better start today.
 The whole process of leadership is erod-
 ing. John Connally knows that; Texas
 knows it; America knows it.
 We had better start acting like Ameri-
 cans, unequivocally stating what we
 think is in our security interests and
 sending unmistakable signals as to what
 we might consider necessary. All options
 are open as to how we would act. The
 whole range is available.
 The Senator from Illinois is quite will-
 ing to have a degree of ambiguity there,
 because it is in our interest to have it
 vague, as long as the language is strong
 enough to convey that we would consider
 taking action.
 We canot leave Taiwan out of that
 perimeter of security interests. When the
 President of the United States says that
 the option is open to send our fleet right
 in those straits, the Congress should be
 free to make a strong statement as well.
 . If we just say "grave concern," we are
 not sending that signal. We are not re-
 flecting what the President has said
 forthrightly. We are not reflecting at all
 what I consider to be the mood of the
 Congress. of the United States, partic-
 ularly the Senate.
 I thank my distinguished colleague for
 yielding. Is that what the Senator had in
 mind when. he said, "When are we going
 to begin acting like Americans?"

 Mr. BIDEN. 'Mr. President, will the
 Senator from North Carolina yield for 30
 seconds?
 Mr. HELMS. I yield.
 Mr. BIDEN. Isuggest that America will
 start acting like Americans .want it to act
 when we start to act in our self-interest
 and stop engaging in hyperbole which is
 a breast-beating exercise in machismo. I
 suggest that when we start acting in our
 self-interest,  we Will be acting like
 Americans.
 Mr. HELMS.  ,dr. President, I never
 have heard the Senator from Illinois
 speak more eloquently. I commend him.
 I say to the Senator that I went to one
 of the hotels on Tuesday evening to at-
 tend the annual dinner of the Veterans
 of Foreign Wars. Each year, the VFW has
 an oratorical contest, and there is a win-
 ner from each State. The winner this
 year was a young lady from Illinois, and
 she sounded almost like the distinguished
 Senator from Illinois in her presentation.
 The last thing. she said was:
 Remember that the last four letters of
 "American" are t-c-a-n-I can.
 I think this is what the Senator from
 Illinois is talking about.
 But let us speak in a bipartisan spirit.
 I recall John Kennedy in the confronta-
 tion with respect to Soviet missiles in
 Cuba. He stood eyeball to eyeball, and in
 effect he said, "I can and we will"; and
 the Soviets backed off.
 Here we are haggling over the mildest
 sort of change in the language. I say this
 with no disrespect to the distinguished
 Senator from New York, my friend, or to
 the distinguished chairman of the com-
 mittee, Mr. CHURCH. I simply think that
 the language of the Senator from Illinois
 is the absolute minimum we should do in
 connection with our friends and allies in
 Taiwan.
 Reference was made yesterday and
 just a few moments ago to the effect
 that Taiwan' had insisted that there be
 one China and that Taiwan be that one
 China, *hile Peking was insisting the
 same thing on the other side. That
 simply is not so, Mr. President. I read
 into the RECORD yesterday the history
 of Taiwan's position on that: An article
 by a distinguished professor at the Uni-
 versity of Maryland, Hungdah Chiu,
 who reviewed, item by item and year by
 year, the position of the Republic of
 China (Taiwan), showing that Taiwan
 had the position of one China with two
 governments.
 Anyone who wants to reject that in
 order to be consistent has to say "Oh,
 well, you cannot-have two Governments
 of Korea or two Governments of Ger-
 many." I do not think any Senator is
 going to seriously suggest that.
 But at least let us be fair to Taiwan
 in what we say in terms of historical
 fact. I do not think Taiwan has gotten
 a fair shake.
 Mr. President, I issue the invitation
 again to any Senator who wants to see
 a document marked "Secret" by the
 Pentagon, which I have in my hand
 here. I will not divulge it to the media;
 but with any Senator, who doubts the
 accuracy Of what I have said about
 General Jones' testimony with respect
 to the capability of the People's Republic
 of China to blockade Taiwan. I will be
 glad to share this secret document. I
 am not going to say what it says but it
 is marked here and on several other
 places. It is marked to show exactly
 what the Pentagon said before the Presi-
 dent of the United States in secret, and
 I use these words advisedly, sold Taiwan
 down the river.
 That is why the Senator from North
 Carolina feels so strongly about this. We
 get doubletalk.
 We got doubletalk on the Panama
 Canal. Last year I heard one thing in my
 office from certain military officers, and
 then the same officers would appear in
 public before a committee and they
 would couch their language so carefully
 to give the opposite impression. I re-
 member one of our distinguished col-
 leagues became furious with me when I
 suggested that this was happening.
 It has happened again here. Every-
 thing that the Pentagon drafted for its
 own edification with respect to this mat-
 ter shows that concern about the capa-
 bility of Peking, and now we are told,
 "Oh, no, they don't have capability to
 blockade Taiwan."
 (Mr. FORD assumed the chair.)
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield for a question?
 Mr. HELMS. I am delighted to yield
 to my friend.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. It is not that I
 want to dispute the integrity of my good
 friend General Jones, but to point out
 that men in uniform occasionally can be
 inconsistent. Does the Senator remember
 General Jones about 2 years ago stating
 that we really did not need the B-1? And
 now he says that we need another pene-
 trating bomber? That is in a matter of a
 year or a year and a half.
 I also ask the Senator another ques-
 tion I think that has a bearing on this,
 because I believe the Senator from Dela-
 ware made an approach to it. Why
 should we have an interest in Taiwan
 that would require the kind of language
 that the Senator from Illinois has -pro-
 posed and which the Senate has obvi-
 ously agreed to? I do not think that was
 discussed in the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee, although I am not a member of
 that committee as the Senator is. It is
 something that Americans forget that
 our central point of foreign interest in
 this country for about 101 or 102 years
 has been the Pacific, not Europe, not
 South America, not Africa, but the
 periphery of the Pacific. We bought
 Alaska in 1867. We acquired Hawaii a
 year or year and a half later. Why? Be-
 cause those men over 100 years ago had
 the commonsense to realize that Europe
 even then was pretty much through as
 a developing continent or a developing
 nation. I suggest that when any country
 reaches its frontiers, reaches its bound-
 aries it can only recede and go back-
 ward, and that is what Europe had
 started to do tlien.
 So we moved into the Pacific. We rec-
 ognized then that if there were going to
 be a part of this world that-in the lifetime
 of our Republic, an extended one hope-
 fully, would become important it would
 be those countries around the Pacific,
 and that has proven true. The great
 shining spots of the economy of the
 world are not in Europe. They are around
 the Pacific. They are the countries that
 are developing. They are the countries
 that are contributing vast amounts of
 money in helping us and helping them-
 selves.
 And so the question always intrigues
 me when someone says what is so im-
 portant about the Pacific and about
 Taiwan?
 Let us take a look at it: Here we have
 made a deal with the Republic of China,
 even though this same body last Septem-
 ber passed, without any dissenting vote,
 that the President of the United States
 should come to us before we did anything
 about stabbing Taiwan in the back. That
 is the way I put it. I think the Senator
 from North Carolina expressed it in an-
 other way. He did not do it.
 Now we have given a hand up to the
 Red. Chinese. I will never know why a
 man who has devoted his life time, sup-
 posedly, to human rights would want to
 crawl in bed with an organization that
 murdered 50 million people. I think that
 is part of what the Senator is saying
 about being an American.
 Mr. HELMS. That is it exactly. That is
 a minimum of 50 million, I say to the
 Senator.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. All right. I want
 to get back to this subject of the Pacific
 to try to explain why Taiwan is so dog-
 gone important to us, the United States
 of America.
 We built one of the finest airbases on
 Taiwan that has ever been built in this
 world. It will take the weight of any air-
 craft yet built and any aircraft that we
 are going to build in the. foreseeable
 future. Taiwan has two good ports, one
 excellent port on the southern tip, that
 can handle the ships of our fleet and the
 ships also, I might say, of?the Soviet fleet.
 Let us say that we did not have this
 kind of language that the Senator from
 Illinois has put in. Let us say that Tai-
 wan is sort of "we are not going to get
 any help from our old friends in the
 United States. We better take another
 look at the Soviet Union," and they say
 to the Soviets, "We are interested in trade
 with you always but we would like you
 to consider the possible use of our har-
 bors, the possible use of this beautiful
 airbase for protection purposes."
 I happen to have been all through the
 Island of Quemoy. I have been all over
 that area. I have flown over it. I have
 been through it. I have to say I would
 hate to be the commanding general that
 is given the order to take Quemoy. I
 think I would ask for leave and relax-
 ation some place, but that is beside the
 point.
 Once the Soviets move in there, and
 they are liable to do it if we do not
 make this language pretty strong, they
 might go into Camranh Bay and like
 the secret document the Senator has, I
 cannot divulge any more than they
 might go into Camh Ran Bay. If the
 Senator asks me sometime I will tell him
 a little more, but I cannot say it here.
 What is next? Singapore. Where is
 the Pacific? Gone. Every country in the
 Pacific and the perimeter of the Pacific
 depends on the Straits of Malacca.

 Now let us move over there. People
 say why are we all excited about the fall
 of Afghanistan and the revolution, so-
 called, in Iran? I have known the shah
 for many, many years, and I remember
 asking him, "Why do you want to buy
 all 'these helicopters in a country that
 borders on Russia that now has over
 3,000 of them?" He said, "I am not wor-
 ried about Russia. I am worried about
 the day Afghanistan falls," and he says,
 "Mark my word, it is going to fall, and
 when it falls it will fall from Soviet in-
 fluence," and that gives them an open
 ?    door across that vast desert of western
 Pakistan, and I know something about
 it. I used to fly over that in World War
 II, and there is nothing out there, noth-
 ing to stop the Russians from building
 railroads, highways, down to the Indian
 Ocean, which they have been wanting
 to do all of their history.
 Now they are going to do it. They are
 going to circumvent the former Straits
 of Iran. They are going to go through
 Afghanistan which is now theirs for the
 asking. They are going to go across Pak-
 istan whether Pakistan likes it or not,
 and they cannot do much about it. And
 they will establish ports on the Indian
 Ocean.
 The distinguished Senator from Illi-
 nois has described what has been going
 on in the Horn of Africa. We have lost
 that through our stupidity and our weak-
 ness. And he said, "When are we -going
 to act like Americans?" When we get a
 little guts right here?
 Mr. HELMS. Right.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. That is when we
 are going to start.
 Now what happens when the Russians
 own the Indian Ocean, which I happen
 to think is the strategic focal point of
 the whole world today?
 We have not done much about Diego
 Garcia. We sat in here and argued about
 it, a little old atoll about 12 miles long;
 we want to spend enough money to deep-
 en the harbor. We do not have to depend
 on Subic Bay which is 4,000 miles away.
 We cannot have a, place out in the mid-
 dle of the ocean where we can put ships
 and put aircraft.
 But we have not done much about it.
 What we are talking about now is the
 connection of the Indian Ocean with the
 Pacific through the Strait of Malacca.
 When you ask what importance is
 that-and we are getting now to the real
 nub of it-the Strait of Malacca is a very
 narrow strait, it is a very shallow strait.
 A couple of tankers strategically sunk in
 that strait could stop traffic through it.
 This would mean oil would have to' go
 either about 7,500 miles further or we
 would see the stoppage of all oil from
 the Middle East to our friends around
 the Pacific.
 So we say-friends in this organiza-
 tion I have heard them say, "Why are
 we interested in the Pacific? Why do we
 need language like the language of the
 Senator from Illinois? Why do we have
 to put something in this bill that we
 are talking about," which, I have to say,
 is a lot better than we started off with,
 and I intend to vote for it, but I will vote
 for it with a much better conscience if
 we have the language that Senator
 D - S]ENAT]E                    S 2325
 PERCY proposes in it. We have got to give
 this world some indication that we are
 not going to sit over here and back away
 from everything that is done to us.
 When the distinguished Senator from
 Idaho got up I could not think of a better
 argument for the proposal of the Sen-
 ator from Illinois than the fact that he
 said we are making the Red Chinese mad.
 I do not care if we, and I do not give a
 damn if we, make them mad. I would
 like to make them real mad. It is when
 they change their spots that I might
 change mine a little bit.
 I just want to thank the Senator for
 allowing me to ask that long question. I
 think it is what he expected of me; is
 that not right?
 Mr. HELMS. I am delighted, and I ap-
 preciate the Senator's reply, as I always
 do. He is a very courageous man who
 has stood fast on his principles, and he
 knows of my support.
 Mr. President, I am not going to take
 much more time. I just want to say again
 if any Senator has any doubt that the
 administration was working and plan-
 ning-and I quote the Senator's words-
 "to sell out Taiwan," even during the
 closing days of the last session when this
 Senate and this House of Representa-
 tives were voting almost unanimously for
 the Dole amendment. I think there were
 four votes against it over in the House
 and none in the Senate-all anyone
 needs to do is to look at this document
 and they will see that the administra-
 tion was making plans to sell out Taiwan.
 over the reservations and the concerns,
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the
 capability of the People's Republic of
 China, which I prefer to call Communist
 China, to throttle Taiwan.
 The point is, Mr. President, that we
 cannot unscramble an egg, and yet that
 is what we are trying to do here. I know
 it must appear to some that the Senator
 from North Carolina is being a little
 heavyhanded with his friend from New
 York (Mr. JAVITS) and his friend from
 Idaho (Mr. CHURCH). But that is not my
 intent. I know they did the best they
 could with what they had. But the prob-
 lem is you cannot make a silk purse out
 of a sow's ear, and my feeling is we ought
 to acknowledge, as many have on both
 sides of the aisle, that we have been had
 on this proposition. Therefore we ought
 to strengthen the security section, at the
 minimum, to what the Senator from Illi-
 nois proposes and, for this Senator's
 part, I will be willing to let her go, as the
 saying is.
 But if we are going to reject even such
 a modest change as proposed by the Sen-
 ator from Illinois, then I think perhaps
 we ought to debate this thing for a
 pretty good while, and we ought to vote
 and vote and vote on some amendments
 so that we can properly ventilate it.
 This I do not want to do. But if the
 State Department wants to get this over
 with, let them say, "OK, we will live with
 the Percy amendment." I guarantee you
 that the Senator from North Carolina
 will cooperate with anybody in shutting
 this thing down.
 But there has been too much said
 about Taiwan that is not so. There has
 been so much done to Taiwan which
 should never have been done that I, in
 good conscience, as just one Senator,
 cannot keep silent. I love nothing better
 than comity. I have great love and re-
 spect for my colleagues, even those with
 whom I disagree with most strongly.
 But we have come to the place where
 right is right, and as that little girl from
 Illinois said, the laws four letters of
 "American" are "I can." This Senate
 can, and this Senate should, and I hope
 this Senate will.
 I yield to my friend from-
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator from Massachusetts.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
 believe the Senator yielded to me.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
 Senator from North.Carolina yield?
 Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator
 from New Hampshire.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does he
 yield for a question or does he yield the
 floor?
 Mr. HELMS. I will find that out when
 I find it out. The Senator asked me if I
 would yield and I said, yes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yield for
 a question?
 Mr. HELMS. Is the Chair going to
 impose that strict a rule?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Well,
 there have been several Senators stand-
 ing wanting recognition. The Senator
 attempted to yield the floor. If the Sena-
 tor yielded for a question-
 Mr. HELMS. I believe that the RECORD
 will show that I was attempting to yield
 to my friend from New Hampshire. I
 suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded .
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator
 from New Hampshire.
 Mr.  HUMPHREY.  Mr.  President,  I
 want to wholeheartedly associate myself
 with the amendment offered by the Sen-
 ator from Illinois, and the fine remarks
 buttressing those of the Senator from
 Illinois offered by the Senator from
 North Carolina, the Senator from Ari-
 zona, the Senator from California, and
 others.
 I find it incredibly ironic that at a
 time when the United States of America
 has in force a mutual defense treaty with
 the Republic of China, we should be
 quibbling so about the security section of
 the Taiwan enabling bill. To be perfectly
 honest, I would. like to see the security
 section made even stronger than has
 been proposed by the Senator from Illi-
 nois, with all due respect to him, but
 perhaps it is the best we can do. I would
 like to see some honor put back in that
 section.
 In my opinion, all that is being at-
 tempted here is to firm up some wobbly
 gums a little bit; to firm up those wobbly
 gums sufficiently so that in the future
 we cannot so readily speak out of both
 sides of our mouth on this sort of issue.
 I think the fact that we are today quib-

 S 2326                 CONGRESSIONAL
 bling about the security-section of the
 Taiwan enabling bill, on the, one hand,
 while on the otherwe'have in force a
 mutual defense treaty, indicates that
 some fundamental change has taken
 place in the relationship between the
 United States and the Republic of China,
 and of course,, indeed, a fundamental
 change has taken place. Indeed, a funda-
 mental change is embodied in 5..245.
 The very essence of S. 245, Mr..Presi-
 dent, is the tacit acknowledgement.by the
 Senate and by the United Stag of Amer-
 ica of the contention of the People's Re-
 public of China that Taiwan is but a re-
 bellious province of the PRC.
 I reject 'that, and I hope a majority
 of the Members of this body will reject
 that dishonest contention. The People's
 Republic of China has never ruled Tai-
 wan. The 17 million people on Taiwan
 are free, and they want.-to remain free,
 They do not want to' be governed by the
 Communist Government of the People's
 Republic of China.
 Why can we not aid them in that de-
 sire .a little .bit? A couple of weeks ago
 President Carter, in his speech at Georgia
 Tech, made four main points, one. of
 which was this: "We shall stand by our
 friends."
 Well, let us do.it! Let us put into prat=
 tice what we say. We "have suffered a
 terrible loss in respect, in. credibility in
 this world, in the last several weeks and
 the last several years, and we will con-
 tinue to.suffer ' that .loss as long as we
 continue  to  act  in this  perfidious,
 cowardly, stupid manner.
 If we acknowledge to ,the"People's Re-
 public of China that ? indeed they own
 Taiwan, it is only?a matter of timebefore
 they attempt to take what we have told
 them they own, by one means or another.
 I happen to believe that the most likely
 course of action by the Communists will
 be an economic 'boycott of the Republic
 of China, and I am supporting some leg-
 islation in an amendment ? which I un-
 derstand will be introduced before this
 discussion is over that will at least help
 prevent that kind of economic' boycott.
 But at the same ,time, while.1 consider
 that to be the main threat, I do not for
 a minute underestimate the potential for
 direct military. action against Taiwan by
 the People's Republic. Why should they
 hesitate to do that? 'Did they hesitate
 to roll their army into Vietnam? Not for
 a moment did they hesitate,. even at a
 very crucial time in the evolvement of
 the new relationship between the United
 States and ' the People's Republic of
 China. They did not hesitate a' moment;
 and to my way of thinking they would
 not hesitate a moment, if they thought
 they could get away with it, from direct
 aggression against' Taiwan.
 It has been said in this Chamber to-
 day that the People's Republic of China
 does not have the capability, and will not
 have for perhaps 5 years, of engaging in
 a waterborne invasion of Taiwan. Per-
 haps that is so, but I am not in the least
 comforted by that, because 5 years goes
 by very quickly. And at least they do have
 today the capability of blockading Tai-
 wan by submarines, and 'that would be
 very devastating for'Taiwan, and -would,
 in my opinion, call for 'the United States
 lID -'PA"IEMarch 8, 1979
 to interpose its naval forces to, prevent
 that.
 In my opinion, the People's Republic
 of China will show no. hesitation,., if it
 thinks it can get' away with it,, in.engag-
 ing                                                     in  military  aggression  against
 Taiwan.
 In today's New York Times there is an
 article which I should like to read, to
 make it a part of the RECORD, about what
 are perhaps the first, certainly early
 Chinese overtures to this country to' pro-
 vide military weapons to the People's
 Republic of China. Not ;incidentally, I
 have an amendment which I hope to
 offer to S. 245 before the discussion is
 closed which will make it impossible for
 the People's Republic of China to?obtain
 military materiel from 'this country.
 After all, we do not"sellit,to the Soviet
 Union; we do not .sell it to any of the
 members of the Warsaw Pact countries;
 and we should not, if we have any sense
 at all left-and I am not sure we have,
 frankly-sell it to the People's Republic
 of China.
 Some people argue that we ought to
 build up the PRC as a counterpoise to
 the Soviet Union; but let us remember
 that 20 years ago the U,S.S.R..and1the
 PRC were fast friends. Twenty years or
 10 years from now they may be fast
 friends again; and I hope, for the sake
 of the future of this country, we do not
 build up a second Communist' power.
 The New York Times article, under the
 heading "China -Showing Interest in
 Buying U.S. War Planes;" written by
 Fox Butterfield, reads asfollows:
 HONG KONG, March 7.-China?has quietly
 expressed interest in buying American mili-
 tary planes and associated' technology, and
 may make a formal request to Washington
 within a few months, knowledgeable sources
 in the aircraft industry have disclosed.
 Such an overture would run counter to the
 policy of the Carter Administration to re-
 frain from selling arms to 'either the Soviet
 Union or China, in order to 'avoid the -ap-
 pearance of, favoring one over the other. But
 the Administration has said it would not ob-
 ject to allies of the United States making
 such sales to China, and Peking is negotiat-
 ing with Britain to buy the Harrier jet
 fighter.
 That, parenthetically, -Mr. President,
 for those who are not aware of it, and
 I suspect most in this -room are, is a
 vertical takeoff fighter which requires
 only the shortest of runways, one whose
 bases could be changed on very short
 notice-for instance, to move them closer
 to the coastline of the People's Republic
 of China.
 Resuming the quotation:
 According to an aviation industry repre-
 sentative who recently visited China, the
 Chinese have shown a particular interest in
 buying the Lockheed C-130, a versatile four-
 engine military transport, and the Lockheed
 P-3C antisubmarine patrol 'plane. The Chi-
 nese also reportedly expressed interest in ad-
 vanced electronic equipment produced by
 McDonnell Douglas, which makes the new
 F-15 Eagle fighter and the highly effective
 but older F-1 Phantom.
 Last month Fang Yi, China's Deputy Prime
 Minister for science and technology, visited
 the headquarters of Lockheed and McDon-
 nell Douglas, ostensibly-
 Ostensibly, I emphasize-
 to inspect their commercial airliners, the
 Lockheed Tristar and the McDonnell Douglas
 ' DC=9 and DC-10. But he was reported ,to be
 .surprisingly well informed.about the com-
 panies' military planes.
 Representatives of the two manufacturers
 have made several trips to China in recent
 months to discuss 'sales of commercial air-
 liners, and during one visit, a Chinese offi-
 cial asked a Lockheed representative 'how to
 negotiate with the Pentagon for a military
 order. "We told them they could buy the
 L-100, the civilian version of the C-130;" the
 American said, "but they indicated 'they
 would like the C-130 itself."
 He said the Chinese 'were aware of Presi-
 dent Carter's prohibition on arms sales to
 Peking but seemed to hope that the normal-
 ization  of  relations  between  the  United
 States and China might lead to a relaxation
 of the ban.
 Another possible motive behind a Chinese
 request to buy United States warplanes is
 that even if Washington was to turn it down,
 ,the overture could help give Moscow the im-
 pression that there was a growing Chinese-
 American alliance. The recent trip to the
 United States by Deng Xiaoping, China's
 senior Deputy Prime Minister, and his stop
 in Tokyo to brief the Japanese on his visit,
 may also have been designed with this pur-
 pose in mind.
 Whatever Peking's motivation, a direct re-
 quest to buy American military aircraft could
 prove very embarrassing to President Carter,
 particularly after China's invasion of Viet-
 nam.
 Peking'has moved slowly to buy weapons
 abroad  and  has been  extremely cautious
 about committing its scarce foreign exchange
 reserves to military purchases. Analysts here,
 for example, say reports last fall that Peking
 had sought $700 million worth of French
 antitank and antiaircraft missiles were pre-
 mature  and that no  contracts had  been
 signed.
 One reason for delays is that the modern-
 ization of China's antiquated armed 'forces
 has been given the lowest-priority in Peking's
 ambitious economic development program.
 This could change, however, because of
 China's experience in Vietnam, where Chi-
 nese commanders may.have discovered they
 were at a disadvantage because they lacked
 the modern field radios,' fighter planes and
 missiles the Vietnamese had.
 China has had considerable difficulty de-
 veloping its own aircraft industry. Most of
 its 5,000 planes are outdated Russian MIG-
 17's, plus a few MIG-21's. There is also a
 Chinese-built version of the MIG-21 called
 the Shenyang F-9, but Peking has reportedly
 had'trouble keeping the plane in operation
 because of faulty design.
 I commend the Senator from Illinois
 for trying to firm up the security section
 of the Taiwan enabling bill. To my way
 of thinking, there is little to allay our
 fears that the Chinese on the mainland
 will not continue in the future in their
 military. adventurism such as they have
 shown in recent weeks. As the Senator
 from Illinois has said, we wish to arrest
 the decline of the United States, the
 decline in our respect and credibility, the
 decline in our ability to affect events. We
 are going to have to make it clear where
 we stand in this world.
 Mr. President, I wish we could erect
 on that wall right behind you a giant
 map of the world with a light behind
 each country, each nation, and switch off
 one by one the light behind each country
 which has disappeared into the darkness
 of communism since World War II. II
 think if we could do that it would be so
 dramatic that there would be no ques-
 tion about whether or not the Senate
 would agree to the amendment offered
 by the Senator from Illinois.

 some leadership if we really care about

 I invite my colleagues in this body to
 support the Senator from Illinois in his
 attempt to modestly stiffen, modestly

 bill which, in any case, will fall far short
 of the mutual defense treaty which the
 President proposes unilaterally to termi-
 nate at the end of this year, and in
 which I hope he will fail.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts.
 Mr. TSONGAS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
 dent.
 I would like to present perhaps a dif-
 ferent New England view or position.
 The Senator from Illinois said it was
 time that we began to act like Ameri-
 cans. I would like to give my personal
 perspective on that issue.
 In the summer- of 1964 I was coming
 back from my service in the Peace Corps
 to go to law school. I thought I had spent
 those 2 years acting like an American
 who recognizes the world that exists, not
 the world that we' cast in our own
 rhetoric.
 In that same summer, in this same
 Chamber, the U.S. Senate voted the
 Tonkin Gulf resolution. As a result of
 that action, 55,000 Americans, most of
 them my age, are no longer alive.
 In my naivete at that point I could not
 understand how that was possible. I sat
 here and listened to the heady jingoism
 or listened to the dynamics that result
 from power, and I understand why 15
 years ago we moved in that direction.
 If I do anything in this body, Mr.
 President, it will be to try to make this
 body recognize that the world has
 changed. You can do what you want
 with all your rhetoric, but it is the next
 generation that will pay that price.
 There is one basic foreign policy flaw
 in this Senate. That is that this body as
 a whole views the world in East-West
 terms. There are only two parts of the
 world: Those who are for us and those
 who are for them.
 Whether or not that was true in the
 1940's and 1950's is arguable. It is not true
 today. It was not true in the 1960's. There
 is a third world that, frankly, does not
 give a damn on which side of the ideo-
 logical split they end up. Their major
 motivation is nationalism, and they did
 not give up colonialism from the French,
 the British, the Belgians, or whoever, to
 take on the Soviets.
 If you were a resident of those coun-
 tries you would have exactly the same
 attitude.
 But we do not recognize that. We im-
 pose our ideology on the third world. The
 problem with that approach is not only Is
 it based on an unreality, but it just does
 not work.
 There is something so psychologically
 enjoyable to get up and rant and rave
 about this country or that country falling
 to the Soviets. I lived in the third world.
 I have seen the Soviets in the third world.
 They are hopelessly inept. The only way
 we have any viable Soviet success is to-
 tally based on the capacity of this coun-
 try not to know what it is doing.
 It seems to me it is about time we acted
 in what are the best interests of this
 country in not falling into the hands of
 the Soviets.
 How is it possible when we talk about
 acting like Americans that we, as a sup-
 posedly advanced, educated, intelligent
 society, could not have recognized China
 for 30 years?
 It is very easy. It is the same rationale
 that says we do not recognize Angola
 today. We do not learn from the past.
 We continue to, repeat the mistakes.
 How is it that we -as a country that
 talks about human rights, dignity, and
 justice could have a long history of sup-
 porting leaders hot based on their poli-
 cies at home but based on their willing-
 ness to mouth the appropriate Ideologi-
 cal rhetoric?
 I do not know whether we are going
 to learn anything. I do riot know
 whether my service here Is going to ad-
 vance the cause. But I would suggest
 that it Is about time -we deal with the
 world as it sees itself and not try to im-
 pose an American view, not only because
 it is right but because it works. There is
 the next generation whose existence and
 stability is dependent upon the Senate
 coming to that awareness.
 ORDER VITIATING ORDER FOR
 'SESSION TOMORROW
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I hope that the Senate will reach a vote
 shortly, up or down, on the amendment
 by Mr. PERcY. I ask unanimous consent
 that the order for a Senate session on
 tomorrow be vitiated.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The Senate resumed consideration of
 the bill.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I do not
 expect to speak more than a few min-
 utes, I might reassure the majority
 leader.                              -
 I must say, as one Senator, that.I sat
 here with great satisfaction and heard
 our newer Members express their views.
 I say to them: That is what this place,
 gentlemen, is all about. You are here be-
 cause you bring a new quality, a new
 freshness, a new set of ideas to liven us
 all up. I hope you keep it up.
 Now, as to the measure that we are
 debating, Mr. President, I had to pinch
 myself to be sure I was awake. After all,
 none of these gentlemen invented this
 security provision for Taiwan. I did.
 When I invented it, I did not propose to
 do Taiwan in, I proposed to help and
 save Taiwan.
 I am mortified, and I do not think I
 S 2327
 did very well, frankly, that we could not
 get a unanimous vote in this Chamber.
 That is what really counts. Who is going
 to be terribly impressed at 47 to 45? You
 cannot even approve a treaty with tlcat
 vote.
 Let us hear all these strong words
 about - how we Americans are going to
 stand up when we have a draft up here,
 or when we increase the defense budget
 10 percent, or when we impose wage and
 price controls or gas rationing. That is
 what the world is looking at us for. You
 can utter all the brave words you like,
 you can write them in this resolution;
 it means absolutely nothing. It is not
 what we say. That has been our trouble:
 We have said too much; we have not
 done anything.
 Sure, this provision is more modest
 than it should be, but it was made more
 modest in order to get the greatest con-
 sensus behind a unilateral policy which
 said, "Listen, People's Republic of China,
 we are recognizing you, but lay off Tai-
 wan."
 I am satisfied that these words say it,
 "Lay off Taiwan."
 Why do I say that? I am not given to
 asking you to take my word for anything.
 I should like to show very briefly why.
 The things which are not in my formu
 lation which are in :here now seemed to
 me to far preponderate over this concat-
 enation of words on whether we say "a
 threat to the peace and security of the
 Western Pacific area and of.grave con-
 cern to the United States" or whether we
 say the same thing, "a threat to the
 peace and security of the Western Pacific
 area and to the security interests of the
 United States.'?
 I wrote those words originally. But
 when you look at what we gain, when we
 want to say to the People's Republic of
 China, hands off Taiwan, this is what we
 gain:
 We gain, one, an absolute condition
 that we are recognizing the People's Re-
 public based upon the fact that it will not
 seek to resolve the Taiwan issue by force.
 That is the real guts of this thing. Right
 now, for the next years, that is what they
 are more afraid of than they are that we
 will interpose our Navy between Taiwan
 and the mainland. We did that before
 under General Eisenhower, and we did
 not have such a resolution at that time.
 Second: We gain what to me is the
 most important part of this thing. That
 is, the naked force, the naked boycott,
 the naked blockade is not nearly as im-
 portant to me as what will, and these
 Chinese are very clever, what will jeop-
 ardize the security or the social or eco-
 nomic system of the people of Taiwan.
 That is what we are seeking to preserve.
 That is in here now. It was not in here
 before.
 Finally, we put the word, a very im-
 portant word, in the self-defense capa-
 bility, which we would equip. That is
 doing things. The word is "sufficient."
 That is that they have enough to defend
 themselves, whatever. it took. That to
 me also, in security terms, was a very
 important word.
 Finally, and very importantly, if the
 Members will look on page 15, lines 1 to 4,
 we used the very same provisions which
 are in the NATO Treaty.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE          March 8, 1979
 The United States will act to meet any
 danger described in paragraph (3) of this
 subsection in accordance with constitutional
 processes and procedures established by law.
 Now, frankly, as I say, if I knew we
 were going to get into this hassle, with
 such close votes, I really would have been
 appalled before I drafted and dealt with
 this thing. It has happened. We are here.
 We have the result. But the key to what
 we shall do will depend on what we have
 in the Pacific. We agree here in this pro-
 vision to maintain our capacity to re-
 sist any resort to force, with what we
 have in the Pacific and our will to use it.
 We sent a carrier from Subic Bay to the
 Persian Gulf and we stopped it.. Now, I
 believe-I do not know, but I believe we
 have sent a carrier to off the Yemen
 coast and we have not stopped it. That is
 What really counts.
 So I hope, and the message we send
 is to the people of the United States-
 they are the people who have to back
 what will make this really effective,
 whatever form of words we use. Because
 I hoped that we could get the greatest
 amount of consensus upon this provi-
 sion as it was and because of the very
 sharp division which has developed here
 over these words, I felt it my duty to ex-
 plain why I considered the whole provi-
 sion far more important' than these
 words. I hope very much that we do
 sustain the language of the agreement
 that we have arrived at with the other
 side and that that is a substantial vote.
 That is the best way to give notice, espe-
 cially if it has behind it our will to im-
 plement what we are writing.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Vote.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question is on agreeing to the amend-
 ment.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, I should
 like to respond to the ranking minority
 member of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations and ask a question of the
 chairman.
 Senator JAVITS indicated that the reso-
 lution is more modest than it should be.
 I agree with that. I have fully taken into
 account, however, the overall job that
 was done and have persistently and
 steadily expressed appreciation to both
 of my colleagues on the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee for what they did ac-
 complish. It was my feeling, however,
 that, good as that job was, we could make
 it just a little bit better.
 The Senator from Illinois, for better
 than 12 years, has seen the Senator from
 New York take his pencil and carefully
 change a couple of words and get quick
 agreement on it. The Senator from Illi-
 nois felt there should not be much dis-
 pute over this particular point.
 Mr. CHURCH. May I just say to the
 Senator that it is just a question of
 judgment as to how close we have come
 to the brink. I think the committee lan-
 guage brought us right to the brink. if
 you stand right at the brink of the
 Grand Canyon, you get a magnificent
 view. If you take one more step, you are
 in trouble. This is the difference between
 our two positions. We disagree on how
 close we have approached the brink.
 Mr. PERCY. I appreciate that. It is a
 question of judgment. It is the judgment
 of the Senator from Illinois that we can
 just inch forward a little bit and get a
 clearer picture of the whole canyon, not
 fall over the precipice, and not jeopard-
 ize anything.
 I persistently and steadily worked to-
 ward normalization and will continue to
 do so. I have a deep respect for many of
 the accomplishments of China and cer-
 tainly the commonality of interests that
 we share in certain areas of security im-
 portant to the United States.
 The question the Senator from Illinois
 would like to ask the chairman of the
 Foreign Relations Committee-
 . Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield
 on the point he just made?
 Mr. PERCY. Yes, of course.
 Mr; SARBANES. I think the differ-
 ence with respect to the judgment call to
 which the Senator from Illinois and the
 Senator from Illinois referred earlier, is
 that if the Senator from Illinois is wrong,
 it is not within our power to control the
 situation. If his language goes too far,
 normalization will have been lost. On the
 other hand, the language in the commit-
 tee bill and the assurances that the
 United States Is making thereunder and
 the action we will take are within our
 control. We can act on the basis. of the
 committee's  language  without  the
 amendment by the Senator from Illinois,
 in order to meet our commitments with
 respect to the people on Taiwan. That is
 a critical difference. There is no gamble,
 from our perspective, with the commit-
 tee's language, because how we act pur-
 suant to. it is within our control and we
 do not need the Senator's proposed
 amendment to act differently.
 With the Senator's amendment, there
 is a gamble, because the reaction to it as
 it may affect normalization is not within
 our control.
 That is the essential difference in the
 judgment call being made here on the
 floor of the Senate with respect to the
 Senator's amendment.
 Mr. PERCY. This amendment was of-
 fered and fully discussed publicly in com-
 mittee.
 After the amendment was defeated, I
 discussed it with two members of the
 Chinese  diplomatic  mission  to  see
 whether there was any adverse reaction.
 I said that we were trying to express in
 the language of this amendment exactly
 what we had been saying to the Vice
 Premier when he visited the Senate and
 was in the United States.
 There has been ample time for the
 Chinese mission, now the members of the
 Chinese Embassy, to contact Members
 of the Senate to express their concern
 about this and say why they feel we
 should not be expressing this point of
 view and whether or not it would jeop-
 ardize normalization of relations.
 The Senator from Illinois to this date
 has not had any direct indication, nor
 has any spokesman for the administra-
 tion been able to express anything other
 than their own concerns about what
 might possibly be a reaction.
 But, as I have said, the People's Re-
 public of China has not hesitated to ex-
 press itself forthrightly and honestly and
 they have taken their chances on jeop-
 ardizing our relationship and it was their
 judgment that plain speaking would not
 harm our relations.
 So far, everything they have done,
 whether it is an invasion of Vietnam or
 whether it was a criticism of the policy
 of the U.S. Government, with respect to
 Iran, has had some degree of risk, but
 they were honest and forthright and laid
 it on the line.
 I think most of us had respect for them
 doing that. I would just hope they would
 be fair enough to respect us for being
 frank. In the Senator from Illinois' re-
 lationship with them I have found them
 eminently fair.
 We have simply agreed to disagree on
 some issues, and in interpretation of cer-
 tain events transpiring.
 All the amendment does is simply state .
 what has already been stated by many
 Members of Congress and much more
 strongly by the President of the United
 States in his interviews with the press.
 It is  certainly  more forcefully  and
 strongly stated by language that has
 been developed by others in the Senate of
 the United States.
 The language offered in this amend-
 ment is, as one Member of the Senate
 said, the mildest language, in his judg-
 ment, we could adopt to honestly express
 our views.
 The Senator from Illinois understands
 there was one other Senator, my distin-
 guished colleague from Iowa, who might
 wish to speak at this time. If so, I am
 happy to yield to the distinguished Sena-
 tor whatever time he feels desirable, tak-
 ing into account that there is a desire
 now to get the vote underway.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the
 Senator from Illinois yielding the floor?
 Mr. PERCY. I am happy to.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Iowa is recognized in his own
 right.
 Mr. JEPSEN. I thank the Chair.
 Mr. President, I have heard the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Idaho say today,
 "What kind of a message are we send-
 ing?"
 I have heard the distinguished Sena-
 tor from Maryland say, "We are taking a
 chance by changing two words."
 I have one question, We are taking a
 chance with what and with whom? What
 kind of a chance are we taking when
 Secretary Blumenthal was in Peking tell-
 ing the whole world China was an aggres-
 sor shortly after our recognition?
 I think that is of somewhat greater
 magnitude-we  talk  about taking  a
 chance-something more than what we.
 are talking about here with strengthen-
 ing a couple of words.
 I do not think we should say the Sen-
 ate of the United States is fouling things
 up. The administration seems to have an
 exclusive right on that.
 A friend of mine went out to the Theo-
 dore Roosevelt Memorial Island the other
 day to enjoy some winter solitude. It is
 one of his favorite places in Washington.
 It is the island in the middle of the
 Potomac across from the Kennedy Cen-
 ter. Dedicated as a wildlife refuge, it
 features a huge, concrete plaza domi-
 nated by an enormous statue of Teddy,

 by giant tablets bearing inscriptions of
 Roosevelt quotations.
 Anyway, when he ' was out there, he
 was sitting there ' alone, and suddenly a
 high-pitched and . rasping voice said,
 "Young man, you there."
 He looked up. It was the statue that
 was talking. The statue of Teddy Roose-
 velt.
 Teddy said:
 Don't be alarmed, I'm perfectly harmless,
 I assure you. I simply get lonely from time
 to time and need someone to talk to. I get
 particularly hungry for news of the outside
 world. Tell me, what's going on out there?
 I've been out of touch for months.
 My friend said:
 Well, let's see, last week President Carter
 went to Mexico on a state visit and was in-
 sulted by the President of Mexico, our em-
 bassy was captured by leftist rebels and the
 staff had to be rescued by supporters of a
 right wing religious nut, and our ambassador
 to Afghanistan was kidnapped and murdered.
 Teddy Roosevelt said:
 Thunderstionl Where did the President
 send the fleet first? It would be a difficult
 choice. I suppose I'd start with Mexico. An
 affront to the President is an attack on the
 American flag. Is that what he did? Did he
 send the fleet steaming into Vera Cruz, or did
 he just send a punitive expedition over the
 border?
 My friend said:
 Neither. He answered the insult by telling
 an assembled luncheon gathering about a
 case of diarrhea he  once had while in
 Mexico.
 Teddy said:
 At at luncheon, you say? Well, not the
 kind of revenge I'd have taken but it's
 something,  anyway.  I'll  wager  he  took
 stronger action against the cheeky beggars
 who took over our embassy in Iran. Send in
 a company of marines to occupy the country,
 did he? Hang the offenders in a public square
 as an example to others?
 No, he sent a sharp note to the Soviet
 Union, saying that if it didn't stop stirring
 up the natives against us, we were going to
 get mad.
 Teddy said:
 Am I missing something? Is the Marine
 Corps ill? What did he do about our mur-
 dered ambassador, send a telegram of apology
 to the heathen who did it?
 He said:
 No. He expressed dismay and surprise that
 the kidnapping was handled so badly by
 Afghanistani authorities.
 Well, he said:
 I know I always advocated talking softly,
 but I don't understand what is going on
 with this situation.
 My friend said:                '
 Well, he's in a difficult position. We need
 oil from . most of these countries and if
 we're not nice.to them they won't sell it to
 us, we'll have to give up our lifestyle of snow-
 mobiles and campers and two cars to a family
 and one person to a car.
 He said:
 That is certainly a sad commentary on
 what's happened to the country. If that had
 been the attitude when I:was President, we
 wouldn't own the Panama Canal today.
 My friend said:
 Mr. Roosevelt, sir, can you sit down? I've
 got something to tell you.
 I say to the Members of the Senate
 that there is a message today that is
 bouncing off the mountain tops, that is
 echoing from the valleys and ringing
 from the hearts of all freedom loving
 people throughout the world. They are
 saying, "America, where are you?"
 Recently, leaders of the European na-
 tions . met in Guadalupe. According to
 this administration and press reports,
 everything seemed rosy. But then the
 leader of France went back and disasso-
 ciated himself from American policies-
 the policy of now you see it, now you
 do not.
 In an interview last Friday, I was told
 by representatives of the German Bun-
 destag that they were worried that "the
 United States is going to leave us high
 and dry and directly facing the hordes
 of Russian military might all by our-
 selves"; that this was causing the Ger-
 man Government to begin to think about
 making book with Russia. But the simple
 fact of life is that America no longer
 has the conviction and the will to stand
 up to those of the left in the world, to
 those who, through acts of terror and
 intimidation, are bent on destroying the
 ability. and the will of freedom-loving
 nations to stand firm against the world-
 wide conflict being practiced by those
 who would like to see America on her
 knees.
 I think this amendment we are talking
 about today is really a drop in the bucket,
 but at least it is something. It is a ray
 of hope. It is a glimmer. It is a response
 to the call that many countries and free-
 dom-loving people around the world are
 expressing, and that is, "America, where
 are you?"
 I hope that this distinguished body-
 which I understand will vote on this mat-
 ter in a few moments-in its wisdom will
 vote "aye" on this amendment. It will
 be the first indication in some months
 that there are people in this country,
 100 Members in the Senate, who do rep-
 resent collectively all the people of the
 United States of America, who are hun-
 gering for leadership, who are desirous
 that we do take a stand and tell the
 world: "Yes, we accept the responsibility
 of being the leaders of freedom around
 the world. We accept the responsibility
 of being the Nation that must keep the
 peace."
 I assure Senators that if we do not
 assume that and accept and continue in
 that role, there will not be peace and
 there will not be freedom, and some day,
 perhaps, there will not be an America.
 So I am going to vote for this.
 I thank the Senator from Illinois for
 yielding time.
 .Mr. JACKSON. Vote.
 Mr. PERCY addressed the Chair.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 will the distinguished Senator from Illi-
 nois yield?
 Mr. PERCY. I yield.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Will the Sen-
 ator let the Senate come to a vote on his
 amendment?  Several  Senators  have
 plane reservations and need to leave. If
 we could vote now, it would be my plan,
 after Senator, HOLLINGS  Calls  Up an
 amendment which he says will be ac-
 S 2329
 cepted, to go over until Monday-if the
 Senator will let its vote now.
 Mr. PERCY. The Senator feels that a
 vote could come in 5 minutes. I have one
 question to ask the chairman.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that a vote
 occur, up or down, on the amendment
 within 5 minutes.
 Mr. PERCY. Better say 10 minutes.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Not later than
 10 minutes.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 BUMPERS). Is there objection? The Chair
 hears none, and it is so ordered.
 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, the ques-
 tion I wanted to ask the distinguished
 chairman relates really to a comment
 that he made earlier. I have made a no-
 tation about the comment-that you can
 understand the politics of this.
 I hope there is no implication in that
 that politics is involved. The Senator
 from Illinois, first of all, deeply believes
 that, whenever possible, there should be
 a bipartisan foreign policy and will ad-
 here in every conceivable way to trying
 .to leave partisanship out of policy. It is
 confusing enough without partisanship.
 Second, I have just checked to see
 whether we have received much mail on
 this. We have not received as much as
 we got in an hour on the Panama Canal.
 I cannot recall when anybody has spoken
 to me about it, except Taiwanese living
 in Illinois who are concerned about their
 rights on the island of Taiwan. As a ma-
 jority, they do not have the rights they
 feel they should have, and they hope
 someone will speak up for that. We have
 expressed in the hearings our feelings
 on that issue.
 Was there some implication the Sena-
 tor from Illinois did not get as to what
 Mr. CHURCH. The Senator knows
 that I am aware of his role in the com-
 mittee, and I have never known him
 not to place the national Interest first.
 I am sure he does so in this case.
 As I mentioned earlier, this is a judg-
 ment call. The Senator from Illinois
 would not knowingly or purposefully
 offer this amendment in the expectation
 that its approval would lead to a dissolu-
 tion of the ties that now have been
 established between Washington  and
 Peking.
 Mr. PERCY. I thank my distinguished
 colleague. I value his friendship and his
 judgment.
 If there were any political aspect to
 this, I must be blind, because I cannot
 see it. It does not seem to be an issue of
 great public interest, and it certainly
 was not during my visit to Illinois.
 It is a matter of deep personal convic-
 tion that 'we 'should express ourselves,
 so that we gain respect by saying ex-
 actly what we mean and saying it as
 forthrightly and honestly and openly
 as other nations have. That is, the con-
 cern I have.
 In all the relationships that the Sen-
 ator from Illinois has been able to estab-
 lish through the years in business or in
 public life, the central core always has
 been the mutuality of interest. Can both
 sides gain by this relationship?
 The term "brinkmanship" has been
 used: Are we on the brink of possibly go-

 unanimous consent that the names of
 the following Senators be added as co-
 sponsors of my amendment: The Sena-
 tor from Kansas (Mr. DOLE), the Sena-
 tor from Arizona (Mr. DECONCINI), the
 Senator from Indiana (Mr. BAYH), the
 Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. BOREN),
 the Senator from Illinois (Mr. PERCY),
 and the Senator from Alabama (Mr.
 STEWART).
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is
 the amendment establishing an oversight
 commission with respect to Taiwan.
 Let me first, before we get into the
 debate, commend the Committee on For-
 eign Relations, and particularly Sena-
 tors CHURCH and JAVITS, for the excellent
 job that they have done so far in taking
 a rather casual, inadequate administra-
 tion bill and substantially improving it
 by recognizing the agencies and instru-
 mentalities on Taiwan, by providing that
 when dealing with the institute, it would
 be dealt with as an instrumentality of
 the government, by providing for privi-
 leges and immunities, and by spelling
 out that other than peaceful means em-
 ployed against Taiwan would be of great
 concern to the United States. On the
 latter, by a tie vote here on two occa-
 sions, we have expressed really the
 United States sense that a threat to our
 security would be involved.
 Mr. President, with those improve-
 ments, the bill has been substantially
 improved. Though I do not minimize in
 any way the hard work doi.e by the For-
 eign Relations Committee with the poor
 bill submitted to them, frankly, what we
 really are engaged in is one of the most
 fraudulent shams that you could pos-
 sibly conceive. We could not find any-
 where else a precedent for calling the
 government an institute and the insti-
 tute a.government.
 We wondered about the covert activi-
 ties of the CIA. They might not have
 worked well in Iran, but they are work-
 ing extremely well right now partici-
 pating in designing this covert operation.
 So we are saying the Government is go-
 ing to work with the government in Tai-
 wan, and it is not the Government, but it
 is the people, and it isn't the public, but
 it is our tax money-and around and
 d
 ill a circle it goes. I cannot get

 am trying to be realistic in trying to
 work out of this situation the best we
 can.
 We heard earlier-and I guess this is
 the best way to get to the point with
 respect to the need for a commission-
 in the statement of my distinguished
 colleague from North Carolina, of a
 secret report of how Taiwan could be
 successfully blockaded by the People's
 Republic of China. That has not con-
 cerned me as much as the economic
 squeeze and strangulation of the people
 by embargo or economic means-and
 that is far, far easier, Mr. President, than
 any kind of military action to blockade.
 I am not minimizing in any sense the
 concern that Senators might have over a
 military blockade, but that is not really
 my primary concern. I had expressed
 this concern for several weeks when I
 was first briefed on the subject 'of Tai-
 wan by the State Department, and then
 later an article appeared, written by a
 distinguished former ambassador and
 foreign service officer of the U.S. Gov-
 ernment, Ambassador William J. Porter,
 and published in the Christian Science
 Monitor of January 10, 1978: I ask unan-
 imous consent to have this piece printed
 in its entirety in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Christian Science Monitor,
 Jan. 10, 19791
 WHAT CARTER GET.- UNrrED STATES INTO
 (By William J. Porter)
 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Administrative Notice to Shippers-Certifi-
 cates of Control and Clearance
 (To ease congestion in the ports of the
 People's Republic of China (PRC), and to
 facilitate the importation and exportation of
 merchandise, all shippers are hereby notified
 that shipments to and from the PRC, includ-
 ing the province of Taiwan, must be ac-
 companied by a Certificate of Control and
 Clearance (CCC) stating the nature of the
 cargo and its port of destination.
 (These certificates may be obtained from
 the consular section of any Embassy of the
 PRC or at any Chinese port on the mainland.)
 The thrust of this imaginary "Notice"
 should be clear. It is intended. to bring into
 view sovereign authority which the Peking
 government may choose to assert, and which
 the United States is no longer in a position
 to dispute once the Carter administration
 recognized Peking's hegemony over Taiwan.
 The White House has informed the public
 that all details of the arrangement with the
 PRC have been revealed-with no mention of
 safeguards against the possibility of such reg-
 ulatory measures. There are, of course, sev-
 eral additional areas in which Peking may
 choose to exercise its sovereign authority
 without fear of anything but remonstrance
 from the Americans. The example cited above
 begs a specific question. Would the United
 Sates accept such PRC regulations if ap-
 plied to vessels carrying defensive weapons
 to "the province of Taiwan" during and after
 the period in which the U.S.-Taiwan mutual
 defense treaty remains valid?
 Apparently such serious possibilities were
 not properly considered or negotiated before
 the recognition of the PRC, which indicates
 the hasty nature of the President's decision.
 We are, of course, assured by those who ap-
 prove the manner in which the event was
 manipulated that it would not be in the in-
 terest of the PRC to take such action. But
 such optimism is not convincing because it
 presumes to judge in advance solutions which
 a very self-centered communist power may
 find expedient. The public and Congress are
 certainly due an explanation as to why Mr.
 Carter, Mr. Brzezinski and Mr. Vance did not
 make an effort to obtain necessary assur-
 ances concerning actual and possible prob-
 lems relating to the matter. Let us note here
 that Mr. Teng and his friends avoided that
 error: They protected their pwn interests and
 preserved all their options very well.
 Another embarrassing example of unsea-
 soned  diplomacy in this  matter was the
 eagerness with which Mr. Carter used to his
 own advantage an alleged statement of ap-
 proval of the recognition by Mr. Brezhnev.
 The Washington Post, which may be think-
 ing of establishing a Peking edition, head-
 lined Mr. B's "very positive" message on the
 subject, as related in glowing terms by the
 President. Moscow, however, corrected the
 White House version very quickly in a state-
 ment to the effect that the account did not
 represent Mr. Brezhnev's message correctly.
 The PRC recognition fits into a rather dis-
 orderly ensemble, other elements of which
 are the Camp David debacle, the oil price
 rise which need not have happened, and the
 looming Rhodesian disaster In all of which
 current U.S. diplomatic techniques figured
 prominently. Two years in office would seem
 sufficient to impress our leaders with the ob-
 vious fact that In these complicated matters
 the desire for publicity should not be allowed
 to overwhelm the need for thoroughness.
 The best we can. hope for now is that,
 when he next visits the Far East, Mr. Vance
 will be able to tidy up the unhappy position
 in which the U.S. finds itself. The statement
 from Peking on Dec. 24 is not encouraging,
 however, stressing as it does the view that the
 PRC alone, and no on'e else, including the
 U.S. is qualified to handle the problem of
 Taiwan. It made even clearer, if that was
 necessary, the PRC's belief that it is in no
 way obligated to accommodate the United
 States or Taiwan and that Mr. Carter's ex-
 pectations are therefore illusory.
 Mr. HOLLINGS. Some of our commer-
 cial colleagues in Japan, asked whether
 or not the Japanese would adhere to
 that kind of activity taken by the Peo-
 ple's Republic, answered "Yes."
 What is that activity? The activity,
 my friends, is not a military blockade,
 but rather the very simple device of
 issuing a public notice in the Journal of
 Commerce that, due to the congested
 conditions in the port facilities of the
 People's Republic of China, vessels enter-
 ing the sovereign water of the PRC
 would have to obtain an anchorage li-
 cense to do business.
 So any captain of a ship, not wanting
 to be turned back after his long trip,
 would apply for the license, and the rest
 is very obvious: If you do not like the
 way they do business, there will be no
 license. If you think they need a lesson,
 there isn't much the captain can do
 except accept or go back. I am not criti-
 cizing the People's Republic at this point,
 or addressing their action in Vietnam,
 but we do know that we are now dealing
 with a people that are willing to give
 lessons; and if they wanted to give a
 lesson to any particular commercial en-
 tity that was not doing business the way
 they thought business should be con-
 ducted, there would be no license: there
 would be a general economic squeeze,
 and I venture to say that in a matter of
 months or at most a, few years, that $7.2
 billion of business done by the United
 States of America with Taiwan, export
 and import, would all of a sudden be
 dried up, and then you would have the
 strangulation of Taiwan.  We heard
 earlier from one of our colleagues that
 we tried to impress our way in Vietnam,
 and I agree with him; but we learned a
 lesson there that the American way was
 not always accepted.
 But there are areas where the Ameri-
 can way is fully accepted, and in Tai-
 wan it is accepted: The commercial,
 free enterprise, competitive, capitalistic
 system.
 That' is exactly why we have misgiv-
 ings when we see our State Department
 use that nice State Department lan-
 guage of art, "grave concern." Because
 the State Department leaves a lot to be
 desired by way of mind and by way of
 commonsense.
 They really barreled on Taiwan and
 took a friend, one of the best friends we
 have ever had, and treated them, I
 should say, as persona non grata. The
 State Department came up and gave
 certain "advice" on how Taiwan should
 sell their U.S. property to the Saudis.
 That advice was not taken. Incidentally,
 I will join in the Twin Oaks bill later on.
 That wall be a different amendment.
 That advice to sell was not taken by
 our friends on Taiwan, those who had
 accepted our way and whom we helped
 prosper economically, and who we helped
 build militarily in every sense. They did
 everything we asked them to do and we
 with them. They then allowed that the
 property of the Taiwanese in Washing-
 ton would immediately be the property
 of the People's Republic of China.
 Of course, we know historically the
 People's Republic of China in this cen-
 tury had neither control nor jurisdiction
 of these properties., We were hearing a
 little earlier about the little cuddly bear,
 Teng Hsiao-ping. Well, I do not know
 that the gentleman has ever had the
 chance to visit Taiwan, though we here
 in the United States have had that op-
 portunity. I do not know anyone in the
 PRC government, including Mr. Teng,
 who has ever been to Taiwan. They do
 not have control there and have not had
 jurisdiction. To come out now and say
 these properties will go to the PRC is
 just an un-American way to do business.
 The way they admonish their ambas-
 sador to not even attend a news con-
 ference is another thing. I can go down
 a list or a bill of particulars. But nothing
 presents it more dramatically than the "
 scurrilous piece of legislation sent over
 here which shows the total disregard
 from what was being said publicly. They
 ? were saying publicly they want con-
 tinued cultural, educational, and com-
 hnercial relationships in the full.
 As was stated here a little while ago,
 on February 16 the President even talked
 about the security, and how a later
 President could go to war to protect that
 security. We know that the President in-
 sistedon sending arms. I know not what
 the purpose of the arms was to be, except
 to protect the people of Taiwan. And I
 know of no threat at this particular
 moment that the United States is con-
 cerned about other than the military
 threat of the People's Republic of China
 at and against Taiwan.

 So we were concerned about the se-
 curity, our President was concerned
 about the security, but that has been a
 no-no word all afternoon. And we see a
 total disregard of the security pact which
 we have at this very minute. We have
 given notification of termination by the
 end of this year, in accordance with the
 treaty, but we do have a solemn treaty
 with the Taiwanese, a security pact.
 When the Senator from Maryland and
 everyone else gets upset when we begin
 to regard that, when we begin to? ac-
 knowledge that, when we begin to show a
 little nationalism here on the floor of the
 Senate, I do not intend to be lectured
 by those who claim to see the real world,
 about the nationalism in the other
 countries.
 I do not know where the nationalism
 of the people of South Vietnam ever was.
 We gave 56,000 lives trying to develop it.
 There is a lot to be said about na-
 tionalism. We learned that people do not
 like foreigners. We learned that in the
 People's Republic of China, in Iran, and
 in France, when they kicked NATO out.
 We learned that the world around. We
 have had many lessons about the con-
 sideration they have for foreigners.
 But when we try to talk and clarify
 "grave concern" or what it means, then
 we get blamed for inexact language, and
 we should go with nebulous nonsense,
 with a frightened stance, and without
 speaking clearly.
 I want to add one more comment with
 respect to Vietnam. I respect my col-
 league from Massachusetts and his dedi-
 ' cation to the Peace Corps and his com-
 ments with respect to Vietnam. Others
 have also commented on that.
 I remeber that commitment. We will
 obviously not have time to argue it at
 this time. The Senator from Delaware
 and others were asking about commit-
 ments, whether or not the commitment
 to Taiwan was as good as the commit-
 ment to Western Europe. My answer is
 yes.
 The commitment with Vietnam, and
 I participated in the debate on the floor,
 was one of the finer commitments that
 went along with the Peace Corps.
 I happened to be in on the innovation
 of that institution. There we were do-
 ing away with the image of the ugly
 American, to go to the undeveloped and
 those countries which wanted help from
 an advanced nation and say, "Yes, we
 will help you in medicine with doctors;
 in langauge we will help you with teach-
 ers, in mathematics, we will help you
 with instructors, and if you want to
 build bridges, we will send Peace Corps
 members there."
 And, yes, we were not only committed
 to our white Caucasian heritage, to
 Western European culture, but we were
 just as committed irrespective of race in
 the Far East.
 The commitment in Vietnam was the
 commitment of the white man for the
 yellow man, the commitment of the
 richest nation for the poorest nation, the
 commitment of the developed for the un-
 developed, the commitment of the priv-
 ileged for the underprivileged.
 People forget that, too, as if it was not
 carried through. But -it had the highest
 sense of commitment from President
 Kennedy, President Eisenhower, Presi-
 dent Johnson, and many others. A lot
 of us would be glad to debate that par-
 ticular commitment some time.
 But, yes, to the people of Taiwan I feel
 we should have a commitment.
 What makes it a tremendous frustra-
 tion to us all is the government itself. I
 make no commitment to Quemoy and
 Matsu. This is why we all have a con-
 sternation, frustration, and confusion in
 trying to actually treat a country that is
 not a country or will not act like a
 country.
 I cannot get anyone on Taiwan to come
 forward and ask for self-determination.
 I have discussed this with the Secretary
 of State and all the people who have
 come to brief me, asking why do they not
 have a plebiscite under the United Na-
 tions to see whether they want to join
 the mainland, whether they want to be-
 come an independent entity, or whether
 they want to go back to the Japanese.
 Again, back in Vietnam we gave 56,000
 for the right of self-determination. That
 is the kind of commitment I would do for
 those people as a people, with their own
 way of life, with a confused heritage.
 Taiwan was settled by the Dutch and
 the Portuguese. The name "Formosa"
 means "beautiful island" in the Portu-
 guese language. It was a refuge for the
 Ching Dynasty and then it was taken
 over by the Manchus, and then con-
 quered in the Sino-Japanese War in
 1895. Then they had the Japanese heri-
 tage up until the end of World War II
 when our Western culture was developed
 there.
 I cannot make up the minds, and I
 have no intention of making up the
 minds, of the people of Taiwan. They can
 expect certain measured judgments to be
 made since there is no language which
 will trigger us. We do believe in their
 security but we do not believe in their
 claim to mainland China. That was a
 charade and that, too, was a sham. I
 think the sooner they developed and have
 a free election the better the Senator
 from South Carolina is going to feel. in
 the meanwhile, while we do not consider
 it a country, and we are not proud of
 abandoning friends, but the friends will
 not organize a country, then what do we
 do? We try to maintain relationships as
 if they were a country and as if they were
 still our friends, or in the President's
 expression,  continue cultural,  educa-
 tional, and commercial relations.
 In looking at that $7.2 billion worth of
 business that we have, our ninth largest
 trading partner, I can tell you quite can-
 didly that these relations cannot happen
 under this institute.
 That would be like delivering lettuce
 by way of a rabbit. That institute is not
 going to represent the United States of
 America. It will represent the very, very
 fuzzy and impolite and discourteous con-
 duct of our own State Department.
 I say that advisedly, knowing how the
 State Department came to the Foreign
 Relations Committee and how they came
 to  our  appropriations  State-Justice--
 Commerce subcommittee with the bum's
 rush. There is no better way to describe
 it: they tried to treat their own repre-
 S 2333
 sentatives just the same way they treated
 the Taiwanese.
 So we are told-take the President's
 bill and if you make one amendment, we
 are going to veto it.
 They came to me and said, either take
 the transfer of funds and give them im-
 mediately or, come the 1st of March,
 there will be riots and there will be
 bloodshed down in Taipei, and you will
 be responsible for it.
 When you are dealing with that kind
 of mind and incapacity, and stupidity,
 then what you ought to do is try to give
 them counsel and care. I will never for-
 get when I first came here, I was told
 that Washington was the first insane
 asylum run by the inmates. Not neces-
 sarily, but if you were looking for one
 institution, you could go find it in the
 personage of the State Department and
 the way they conduct some of our af-
 fairs from time to time.
 I have the highest regard individually
 for the distinguished Secretary of State
 and many of the officers. I have been a
 supporter of their endeavors to get bet-
 ter management principles and so on.
 There is a lot to be admired, do not mis-
 understand. But they have certain ones
 from time to time who just go way off the
 deep end. This is one of those cases.
 With that institute, they do not have
 any idea of doing exactly what the Con-
 gress intends.  The people of Taiwan
 know that. The commercial interests in
 the United States know that. And to a
 man, they have said, "If you can get
 some kind of oversight commission simi-
 lar to what we had with the Helsinki
 agreements, then it would stabilize Tai-
 wan materially, safeguard the commer-
 cial enterprise, and assist the whole rela-
 tionship between Taiwan and the United
 States of America."
 I have just come back from the NATO
 conference, and I have followed the Hel-
 sinki Agreement. We traveled and I
 learned its tremendous value in Czecho-
 slovakia, where my distinguished senior
 colleague on the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee, the present manager of the bill
 (Mr. PELL) served, in Prague. The dis-
 sonant movement of 1977 made certain
 contacts with us and that is their only
 hope-not the agreement itself, but the
 Oversight  Commission,  the  Helsinki
 Commission, composed of Members from
 Congress and from the executive branch.
 They can get to and speak to and cor-
 respond with and try to help the cause
 of freedom in East Europe.
 I think if we have a commission, the
 administration does not want to have
 any executive branch members; I well
 understand that. They do not want to
 have an institute. They do not want to
 have any relations. In fact, I am not
 nonplussed at that at all. Their idea of
 an institute was to end the relationship.
 You would never hear any more than a
 one=line report of something from time
 to time, but that would phase out
 Taiwan and then they would move on to
 greater things. Then we would have a
 black eye in the Far East about keeping
 our word and being true to our repre-
 sentations and true to freedom. We
 would have lost our credibility because,
 assuredly, Mr. President, this is exactly

 what happened in the way the President
 conducted the business on the Taiwan
 score.
 We had asked, we had signed into law
 last year. our desire for consultation. We
 did not get consultation.             ,
 Everyone had heard of the great ob-
 jection that we had from our strongest
 ally in the Far East, Japan, how they
 were totally disregarded in the Shanghai
 communique and the visitation of Mr.
 Kissinger and President Nixon, and as-
 suredly we all knew that we should not
 disregard them in that fashion again.
 But again we awakened them in the
 middle of the night and told them that
 the Taiwan security pact was gone. They
 have always had a war party in Japan.
 Now they will have greater persuation,
 greater weight for their arguments. They
 can say, "You know, we have a security
 pact with the Government of the United
 States, but you can see how a President
 can do what he wants to. He can call you
 up in the middle of the night and say,
 'That is the end of that.' We had better
 start moving."
 This President, who has great con-
 cerns about nuclear proliferation and
 what have you, sure lost the battle on
 that one, because I can tell you now that
 if you live in Japan, you had better
 worry and wonder, under this adminis-
 tration, when it comes to a security pact.
 Then Israel. That is where the gentle-
 man will be on Saturday. If he gives.
 them a promise of a security pact, I
 hope the Knesset, I hope the Prime
 Minister, do not break out laughing
 about the security pact, because they
 have every right to say, "Mr. President,
 that is what you gave to Taiwan and
 without any consultation, for reasons of
 greater interest that you had at the
 moment, you changed a 30-year policy
 with a call 'in the middle of the night.
 We love your security pact, but we would
 rather have greater assurances than
 that."
 That hurts my feelings, to have our
 country conduct its business in this
 fashion. I think it not only hurts our
 feelings here in the United States; I
 think it hurts the feelings of all of our
 friends. It raises serious doubts.
 We have spent billions upon billions
 of dollars to try to establish confidence
 and friendship, through all the economic
 instrumentalities-foreign military sales,
 Peace Corps endeavor, and everything
 else-to say "You can count on the moral
 force of the freedom-loving nation, the
 United States of America, and we shall
 always stand for that." Then we turn
 and, bam, bam, it's over.
 We did not do as Canada did. Canada
 said they took note of the PRC's claim
 to sovereignty over Taiwan. They did
 not recognize, and they got relations
 with the People's Republic. Our friends,
 the British, acknowledged, but they did
 not recognize, and they got relations.
 But rather than just acknowledge, we
 allowed that Chinese transcript to be
 written with the word "recognize" and
 they can continue to say "recognize."
 I am back to my little economic notice
 in the Journal of Commerce. Yes, with
 that recognizing of the People's Republic
 as sovereign, we cannot interfere with
 sovereignty. That is what the whole
 argument  was  with  respect  to the
 Panama Canal Treaties. So we do not
 interrupt sovereignty and we have no
 standing.
 Then they come around and say, "Why
 can't we handle the property in court?"
 We have no standing in our own court
 of public opinion, much less the legal
 courts. I am trying to get standing in the
 court of world opinion, not any technical
 titles and that kind of thing. I am trying
 to build America, and I am not ashamed
 of it, when I talk as I do on the floor
 of the U.S. Senate.
 I feel very strongly about this com-
 mercial approach to the problem that
 we have, because, with all the language
 and nuances, whether it is "grave con-
 cern" or "security" or whether it is this
 or that, it depends on the implementa-
 tion of this particular piece of legisla-
 tion. I welcome the assiduous concern
 and attention that we have had for the
 bill itself by the House Foreign Affairs
 Committee and our Senate Foreign Re-
 lations Committee. If we can formalize
 that concern in the form of an oversight
 commission, then we can bring immedi-
 ate stability to the dark clouds and
 trouble on the horizon of where we go
 from here with Taiwan. .
 No. 1, Taiwan will not be forgotten. No.
 2, there will be contact. No. 3, there will
 be oversight. And number four, we at the
 appropriations level are going to follow
 with good intent the intent of the full
 Congress, House and Senate, on this par-
 ticular score.
 I appreciate the adjustments that the
 managers of the bill have made in order
 to accept this amendment. As I under-
 stand, the amendment will be accepted.
 I agreed then that we would not require
 a rollcall.
 I have agreed to amend that original
 version to provide for a three-year dura-
 tion of the commission. I am a believer
 in sunset legislation. The commission
 does not have to go on, but I would think
 within 3 years we would approve it. I do
 not mind being put on trial with this par-
 ticular idea. I would have hoped that the
 validity, the efficacy, the need and the
 power of an oversight commission would
 have proved itself to all men of good will
 and good intent with respect to our in-
 volvement in Taiwan and that it would
 be renewed, perhaps, at that time.
 I cannot foresee whether I will be there
 to renew it or not. I will watch that gov-
 ernment over there to see whether they
 have the right of self-determination.
 I guess I am recognizing the People's
 Republic. I am a realist. I have no bone
 to pick with them. If they can pick up
 Taiwan by bamboozling the President of
 the United States, because they know
 how to use their power, and we have lost
 the ability to use ours, that will be a sad
 ending.
 But this little bit of oversight power we
 have in a national people's body, the
 Congress of the United States-where
 we can see that we do act like Ameri-
 cans, as the distinguished Senator from
 North Carolina pointed out so appro-
 priately earlier this afternoon-can help
 us keep watch, keep vigilant, keep in-
 volved, and hopefully bring a measure of
 March 8, 1979
 hope and pride where otherwise we
 would have none.
 Mr. President, I am glad to yield the
 floor at this time.
 Mr. HELMS. Did the Senator yield to
 me or did he yield the floor?
 Mr. HOLLINGS. I yielded the floor.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have
 heard the distinguished Senator from
 South Carolina speak on many occasions
 and I always enjoy him and admire his
 eloquence. But I think he has risen to
 new heights today.
 I commend him not only on what he
 said, but on the amendment that he has
 proposed and which, as he knows, I am
 cosponsoring with him.
 Mr. President, I rise to join the dis-
 tinguished Senator from South Carolina
 in his concern for monitoring our policy
 ? in. China. I strongly support his idea of
 a Commission on Security and Economic
 Cooperation in Asia. Indeed, the Sena-
 tor from North Carolina proposed a sim-
 ilarly-named commission based on the
 Helsinki commission model on January
 29. The version of the Senator from
 South Carolina is a broader proposal
 and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.
 The idea of Helsinki-type monitoring
 is particularly relevant to this bill, be-
 cause Congress must become aware of
 the meaning of "peaceful unification" of
 Taiwan into the mainland. I recently re-
 quested the Far Eastern Law Division of
 the Library of Congress, under the com-
 petent direction of Dr. T. T. "Shaw"
 Hsia to prepare a report on recent devel-
 opments related to human rights in the
 People's Republic of China. This was ac-
 complished in a most scholarly and bal-
 anced manner, and has been printed as
 a committee document by the Commit-
 tee on Foreign Relations. I believe that
 a copy is on every Senators desk, and I
 commend it highly. It will make a fine
 starting point for the proposed commis-
 sion.
 I also want to refer again to the excel-
 lent study on human rights in the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China prepared by the
 Institute on American Relations which
 I placed in the RECORD during the debate
 on the Woodcock nomination. It is an
 excellent and deeply moving report.
 Mr. President, the recognition of the
 Government of mainland China by Pres-
 ident Carter has raised a great amount
 of anxiety over the future of the island
 province of Taiwan, and the Government
 of the Republic of China which is located
 there in Taipei. Despite assurances by
 President Carter that the mainland gov-
 ernment is pledged not to use force
 against the Government of Taipei, recent
 statements  by  Chinese  Vice-Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping that he would not rule
 out the use of force as' the ultimate
 sanction to induce negotiations have un-
 veiled the ultimate goal.
 The question is whether there are any
 circumstances whatsoever under which
 U.S. policy would like to see the peaceful
 unification of Taiwan with any Commu-
 nist government on the mainland. The
 issue raises larger questions about our
 belief in the nature of freedom and our
 willingness to see any group of peoples
 in the world lost their right of self-
 determination. It is scarcely conceiv-

 doubtless will include diplomatic, eco-
 and psychological efforts to iso-

 ,
 late Taiwan, to restrict its freedom of
 action in international activities, and to
 destroy its economy. Taiwan cannot be
 said to have a choice if its freedom is
 strangled "peacefully" in a silken noose.
 Similarly, Taiwan's choice cannot be
 said to be free if it is threatened mili-
 tarily by a buildup of the kind of forces
 and armaments directed at military in-
 vasion, particularly if these forces are
 concentrated in regions adjacent to the
 Taiwan Straits. In part, Taiwan's ability
 to respond will depend upon the United
 States; but a great deal will depend
 upon the actions of the Peking govern-
 ment.
 There are those who say, hopefully,
 that Peking will never invade because it
 would disrupt relations with Japan and
 the United States. But no one can predict
 under what future circumstances Peking
 might decide to act.
 The fact remains that the Peking Gov-
 ernment has the worst-let me repeat
 for the purpose of emphasis-the worst
 human rights. record in history, one that
 surpasses even the graphic descriptions
 of witnesses to the Cambodian tragedy.
 A study prepared for the Senate in 1971
 estimated that as many as 64 million
 Chinese died during the Communist pro-
 grams of liquidation and purge.
 Even today, Chinese Communist offi-
 cials estimate that between 5 and 10 per-
 cent of the Chinese people suffer "the
 dictatorship of the proletariat" in forced
 labor camps. With a population of 900
 million, 5 to 10 percent in forced labor
 camps is a number equivalent to one-
 quarter to one-half of the population of
 the United States. So that, Mr. President,
 is what we confront.
 Those who are not in the forced labor
 camps live continually in the fear that
 they, too, might fall under surveillance

 VP AMENDMENT NO. 6
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I send
 to the desk an unprinted, amendment.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.     The
 amendment will be stated.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 The Senator from Idaho (Mr. MCCLUEE)
 proposes an unprlnted amendment num-
 bered 34.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further reading
 of the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 15, line 4, insert a new section as
 follows:
 "Nothing in this Act, nor the facts of the
 President's action in extending diplomatic
 recognition to the People's Republic of China,
 the absence of diplomatic relations between
 the people on Taiwan and the United States
 or the lack of recognition by the United
 States, and attendant circumstances thereto,
 shall be construed in any administrative or
 judicial proceeding as a basis for any United
 States Government agency, commission or
 department to make a finding of fact or
 determination of law under the Atomic En-
 ergy Act of 1964, as amended, and the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Act of 1978. to deny an ex-
 port license application or to revoke an exist-
 ing export license for nuclear exports to the
 people on Taiwan.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, this
 amendment deals with the provisions of
 S. 245 and the current status of Tai-
 wan and their relationship to con-
 tinued, uninterrupted cooperation with
 Taiwan in the peaceful uses of atomic
 energy under the Atomic Energy Act and
 the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of
 1978. I have reviewed the actions of the
 Foreign Relations Committee and the
 reported bill, as they may bear on such
 continued,  uninterrupted cooperation,
 and I am convinced that further clari-
 fication and perfection of the bill to in-
 sure that cooperation is appropriate
 and, in fact, may be absolutely neces-
 sary. I am anxious to work closely with
 you and the committee to that end.
 Nuclear power development on Tai-
 wan under the 1972 Agreement for Co-
 operation with the United States has
 been aggressively pursued. Taiwan has
 an advanced nuclear power research
 program and it is becoming increasingly
 dependent on nuclear power for elec-
 tric generation. Six nuclear power re-
 actors are in various stages of design,
 construction, and operation, and they
 will provide over 10,000 Mwe power by
 mid-1985. Four additional reactors are
 scheduled to begin operation later in the
 1980's, and nuclear power by 1990 will
 provide about 50 percent of Taiwan's
 electrical capacity. Also, pending before
 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at
 this time are seven license applications
 for two reactors (pending for almost
 a year), critically required fuel and
 other materials. Obviously, then, con-
 tinued, uninterrupted U.S. cooperation
 is an essential element of Taiwan's eco-
 nomic future, as well as our good-faith
 relationship with the Taiwan people.
 Also, as you know, the United States has
 played a key role in the development of
 this nuclear power capacity within the
 context of a renewed commitment to
 peaceful uses only of nuclear power, and
 strict adherence to nonproliferation re-
 quirements, in the context of our mutual
 nonproliferation objectives. Continued,
 uninterrupted cooperation, therefore, is
 absolutely essential for both Taiwan and
 the United States.
 I reviewed and analyzed in detail the
 reported bill, S. 245, after it was reported,
 and I was convinced that,'in the absence
 of further amendment and additional
 legislative history, the U.S. cooperation
 with Taiwan in peaceful uses of atomic
 energy could be interrupted and seri-
 ously jeopardized. I based that conclu-
 sion, not on the failure of the committee
 to address responsibly the general legal
 situation, but rather on the intricacies
 and complexities of our domestic licens-
 ing law in the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
 mission under the Nuclear Nonprolifera-
 tion Act of 1978. I also based that con-
 clusion on the January 30, 1979 Memo-
 randum to the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
 mission's General Counsel on the sub-
 ject of "Legal Issues Arising from the
 United States' New China Policy" and
 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
 General Counsel's letter of February 15,
 1979 to House Foreign Affairs Commit-
 tee Chairman Zablocki on the same sub-
 ject. In fact, I want to commend the
 Foreign Relations Committee for con-
 certed efforts to deal constructively and
 responsibly with the virtual Ghordian
 knot of legal technicalities resulting
 from the administration's actions in
 recognizing the People's Republic of
 China as the sole legal authority for
 mainland China and Taiwan, and de-
 recognizing the Republic of China.
 The possibility of difficulties under the
 adopted bill flow from the very specific
 findings of fact and law that must be
 made by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
 mission under the Nuclear Nonprolifera-
 tion Act. As  as demonstrated graphi-
 cally in the Tarapur, India, export case
 last year, and may be repeated again on
 the next export license for Tarapur now
 pending in the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
 mission, those required findings of fact
 and law can and have been rejected on
 both narrow legal technicalities and vir-
 tually unbounded speculation. My strong
 opinions on the Tarapur case and the
 outright rejection of the clear congres-
 sional intent for continued exports to
 India under phase I safeguards was doc-
 umented in my testimony before the For-
 eign Relations Committee on May 24,
 1978 in the hearing on that case. For in-
 stance, I am convinced that the recogni-
 tion of the People's Republic of China as
 the sole legal authority for Taiwan, as
 well as the mainland, and the arguable
 U.S. position that the People's Republic
 of China eventually and ultimately will
 be constituted as de facto, as well as de
 jure governmental authority on Taiwan,
 could and probably would be argued as
 the basis for rejection of the required
 findings for the pending reactor and fuel
 licenses. Also, the legal arrangements
 under the bill for the American Institute
 on Taiwan and its nongovernmental,
 corporate counterpart in Taiwan prob-
 ably would be argued as not satisfying
 the exact requirements for the specific
 findings of fact and law. Additionally,
 there are a series of sensitive matters re-
 lated to our formal cooperation with
 Taiwan dealing with exports and non-
 proliferation that must be covered fully
 under the reported bill, but which also
 could be jeopardized in the Nuclear Reg-
 ulatory Commission in the absence of
 further clarification and perfection of
 the bill. I have taken the liberty of shar-
 ing these views with several senior ad-
 ministration  officials in the nuclear
 power area, and they share my conclu-
 sions and very serious concern about
 continued,  uninterrupted  cooperation
 with Taiwan.
 It obviously would be extremely unfor-
 tunate if Congress enacted a statute
 which generally purports to preserve all
 of our ongoing commercial, cultural and
 other relationships with Taiwan, but was
 immediately followed by an effective
 legal embargo on nuclear exports. We al-
 ready have experienced that same un-
 fortunate result with India after passage
 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act last
 year, and we also had an extended legal
 embargo  of  our European  allies  in
 EURATOM, under the act. Recognizing
 the critical and immediate importance of
 this matter, and its extreme sensitivity,
 I am convinced that we must act to in-
 sure that the enacted bill directly pre-
 serves, as a matter of clearly predictable
 law, our nuclear cooperation with Tai-
 wan. As I mentioned, I have concluded
 that an amendment will be appropriate
 and probably necessary to achieve that
 goal.
 Mr. President, once I concluded that
 action was appropriate on this issue, I
 approached last week the chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee, my col-
 league from Idaho, with my conclusions
 and recommendations. We have pro-
 ceeded over the last week to work closely
 and cooperatively together on this issue,
 with the State Department and our re-
 spective staffs to develop a mutually-
 agreeable approach to resolving the is-
 sue. The pending amendment is the prod-
 uct of our cooperative efforts. I thank
 him, his committee staff, and the State
 Department for their assistance and co-
 operation in fashioning the required clar-
 ification and perfection of the bill on this
 issue.
 Let me turn now to the details of the
 amendment. The effect of the amendment
 will be to state expressly in the statute
 that this act is intended to and shall be
 construed in any administrative or judic-
 ial proceeding as providing the full legal
 basis, in terms of the continuing legal
 relationships betweeen the United States
 and the people on Taiwan, to satisfy all
 statutory requirements and criteria for
 nuclear exports under the Atomic Energy
 Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Act of 1978, and there-
 by insure the continued legal basis for
 full,  uninterrupted  coperation  in  the
 peaceful uses of atomic energy between
 the United States and the people on Tai-

 Cooperation, as amended, and any other
 applicable agreements, notwithstanding:

 Republic of China, the President's action
 in withdrawing diplomatic recognition
 from the Republic of China, and atten-
 dant circumstances; nor; second, the op-
 eration of any specific provisions of this
 Act, such as those dealing with the Amer-
 ican Institute on Taiwan or its counter-
 part instrumentality representing the
 people on Taiwan. That effect is achieved
 by stating affirmatively that the facts of
 the People's Republic of China recog-
 nition and the derecognition of the Re-
 public of China, and attendant facts shall
 be legally irrelevant in any proceeding
 dealing with nuclear exports and other
 forms of coperation under the Atomic
 Energy Act and the Nuclear Nonprolifer-
 ation Act, and also.that the procedures
 under S. 245 for continued cooperation
 with Taiwan through the American In-
 stitute on Taiwan and its counterpart
 instrumentality shall satisfy the proce-
 dural requirements of those acts.
 The  Amendment  also  states  that
 nothing in S. 245 on the facts of the
 status changes for the People's Republic
 of China or the Republic of China can
 be used as a legal basis to deny an ex-
 port  license  application,  revoke               an
 existing license, or disapprove other au-
 thorized forms of cooperation. These
 parallel affirmative and negative formu-
 lations in the Amendment will leave no
 room for the types of interpretation sug-
 gested in the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
 mission's General Counsel's Memoran-
 dum of January 30, 1979 or his letter of
 February 15, 1979. Also, this formulation
 should foreclose as a matter of law the
 type of creative misinterpretation which
 formed the basis for the opinion of Com-
 missioners Bradford and Galinsky in the
 Tarapur case last year.
 Several additional matters are rele-
 vant at this point. This Amendment and
 the related provisions of the bill will in-
 sure full, continued cooperation with
 Taiwan. That cooperation legally can in-
 clude government-to-government trans-
 fers under section 54, 64, and 111 of the
 Atomic Energy Act (section 301 of the
 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act) , tech-
 nology transfers under section 57B (sec-
 tion 302 of the Nuclear Nonproliferation
 Act), subsequent arrangements under
 section 131 (section 303 of the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Act), export licensing
 under sections 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, and
 109 (sections 304 through 309 of the
 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act), and other
 authorized forms of cooperation under
 the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act
 and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act.
 All of these specific forms of coopera-
 tion shall continue through and by the
 American Institute on Taiwan and the
 counterpart instrumentality on Taiwan.
 The legally-satisfactory, specific pro-
 cedures for that cooperation, pursaunt
 to this amendment and the other provis-
 ions of this bill, will be in the following
 form:
 SUMMARY  or  NUCLEAR  EXPORT  PROCEDURES
 APPLICABLE   TO  THE  PEOPLE  ON  TAIWAN
 UNDER S. 245
 Section 101 (a) provides that whenever
 any law, regulation, or .order the U.S. refers
 or relates to a foreign "nation", or uses
 another such similar term, such term shall
 include, and such law, regulation or order
 shall apply with respect to, the People on
 Taiwan. In this regard the Foreign Relations
 Committee report on the Act (Report No.
 96-7, 96th Congress, 1st session) indicates
 that Section 101 (a) continues the eligibility
 of  the  people  on  Taiwan  under  the
 Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
 The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as most
 recently amended by the Nuclear Non-Pro-
 liferation Act of 1978 (NNPA), contains num-
 erous provisions relating to nuclear cooper-
 ation with foreign "nations". For example,
 Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act, as
 amended, requires an agreement for cooper-
 ation with a "nation" before certain speci-
 fled cooperation may be undertaken. Section
 127 establishes criteria that must be met by
 nations for nuclear export. Such provisions,
 under Section 101 (a) of the Taiwan En-
 abling Act (TEA), would be applicable to the
 people on Taiwan.
 Section 104 of the proposed TEA confirms
 that  all  treaties  and  other  international
 agreements entered into between the U.S.
 and the government recognized as the Re-
 public of China prior to January 1, 1979, and
 in force until December 31, 1978, shall con-
 tinue in force unless and until terminated
 in accordance with law. In accordance with
 this provision, the agreement for coopera-
 tion with Taiwan and any other applicable
 international agreements in the nuclear field
 continue in force. Under Section 123 of the
 Atomic Energy Act, as amended, agreements
 for cooperation are prerequisite for certain
 nuclear cooperation. Section 405(a) of the
 NNPA of 1978 confirms the authority to con-
 tinue coperation under agreements entered
 into prior to enactment of that Act. Section
 104 of S. 245 makes clear this applies in the
 case of Taiwan.
 Section 105 of the proposed TEA provides
 for the continuance of programs, transac-
 tions and other relations with respect to the
 people on Taiwan in accordance with appli-
 cable laws in the U.S. The Foreign Relations
 Committee report makes clear that this will
 assure continuation of authority for nuclear
 exports. Thus, this provision reconfirms that
 nuclear programs, transaction and relations
 with Taiwan may continue in accordance
 with law.
 Section 106 (a) of the proposed TEA pro-
 vides that programs, transactions, and other
 relations shall, in the manner and to the
 extent directed by the President be carried
 out or through the American Institute in
 Taiwan (AIT). In conection with this pro-
 vision, it is anticipated that the President
 will direct that nuclear programs, transac-
 tions and other relations be carried out by or
 through the AIT.
 Section 108 of the TEA empowers the AIT,
 in the manner and to the extent directed by
 the President, to enter into perform, enforce,
 or have in force agreements or arrangements
 relative to the people on Taiwan. In con-
 nection with this provision, it is anticipated
 that the President will direct that agreements
 or arrangements in the nuclear field be en-
 tered into, performed, enforced or considered
 to be in force by all through the AIT. Thus,
 pursuant to this section (and to Section 405
 (a) of the NNPA, mentioned above), the cur-
 rent  nuclear  cooperation  agreement  with
 Taiwan remains in force and valid authority
 for exports thereunder. Further, Section 404
 (a) of the NNPA requires the President to
 seek to renegotiate such agreements. Section
 108 of S. 245 makes clear that the AIT may
 conduct such renegotiation. Further the AIT
 will be able to perform, on behalf of the U.S.
 or any Department or Agency or enforce
 agreements or other arrangements relative
 t., the people on Taiwan.
 Section 109 of the proposed TEA provides
 that any performance, communication, as-
 surance, undertaking or other action on be-
 half of the people on Taiwan shall be ren-
 dered, in the manner and to the extent di-
 rected by the President, through an Instru-
 mentality established by the people on Tai-
 wan. In connection with this Section, it is
 noted that Taiwan has announced the estab-
 lishment of the Coordination Council for
 North American Affairs (CCNAA) to act as
 this instrumentality. It is anticipated that
 the President will direct that performance,
 communication,  assurances,  undertakings
 and other actions in the nuclear area be
 rendered or. provided to or received or ac-
 cepted from the CCNAA. Proposed Section
 109 authorizes this to be done on behalf of
 the U.S. or any department or agency. Thus,
 assurance that a proposed export is subject
 to the U.S.-Taiwan Agreement for Coopera-
 tion may be provided by and received from
 the CCNAA. Further, any clarification or as-
 surance required during the process of ex-
 port license applications would be obtained
 from the CCNAA.
 Section 401(c) of, the proposed TEA indi-
 cates that agreements and transactions made
 by or through the Institute shall be subject
 to the same congressional notification, re-
 view and approval requirements and proce-
 dure as if such agreements are made by or
 through the Department or Agency of the
 U.S. on behalf of which the Institute is act-
 ing. The Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee report indicates that this provision in-
 sures that procedures parallel to currently
 applicable procedures for agreements for co-
 operation under Section 123 of the Atomic
 Energy Act will apply.
 Within this framework, the same proce-
 dures established by the NNPA, the Nuclear
 Regulatory Commission's regulations con-
 tained in 10 CFR Part 110, and the Executive
 branch procedures published at 43 Federal
 Register 25326-30 will apply. These proce-
 dures are described in Chapter IX of the First
 Annual Report of the President to the Con-
 gress pursuant to Section 601 of the NNPA.
 The procedural variance in the application
 of the procedures is that we envisage that the
 CCNAA will act, in all respects, on behalf of
 the people on Taiwan in the export process.
 To the extent that the USG must deal with,
 seek asurances from, or receive assurances
 from the CCNAA, the USG will act through
 the AIT.
 Thus,  the export licensing process for
 source or special nuclear material or produc-
 tion                                                                                                                dr     utilization facilities  would be  as
 follows:
 The process is initiated when the U.S. com-
 pany that is either the shipper of the source
 or special nuclear material or the exporter of
 the production or utilization facility submits
 an application for an export license to the
 NRC. The Commission then requests the Ex-
 ecutive branch analysis and judgment pro-
 vided for in Section 126 of the Atomic Energy
 Act, as amended.
 In preparing this judgment, the Executive
 branch would seek, in accordance with Sec-
 tion i (e) of Part B of the Executive Branch
 Procedures,  confirmation  that  the  export
 would be subject to the terms and conditions
 of the U.S.-Taiwan Agreement for Cooper-
 ation, that the consignee is authorized to
 receive the export, and that adequate phys-
 ical security measures will be maintained.
 Since it is the task of the Department of
 Energy to obtain this confirmation, the De-
 partment of Energy would submit the re-
 quest to the AIT which would transmit it to
 the CCNAA. The confirmation of the CCNAA
 on behalf of the people of Taiwan would be
 transmitted  back to the Department of
 Energy by the AIT and would in all respects
 satisfy the requirements of law.
 The Executive branch judgment and anal-
 ysis would deal with the criteria specified by
 law and would, in addition, transmit to the
 NRC this confirmation.
 When the NRC  receives the Executive
 branch judgment and analysis, the export
 license application would, in all respects, be
 treated as any other similar application. If
 during the course of either NRC or Executive

 to make the required findings and determi-
 nations under the Atomic Energy Act of
 1954, as amended, in order to permit con-
 tinued nuclear exports to Taiwan, and de-
 zecognition will not constitute a basis for
 not making those findings and determina-
 ISons. At the same time, nothing in this
 bill will prevent the Commission from taking
 into account subsequent changes in circum-
 stances in its application of the statutory
 criteria.
 Also, the House report on page ?8 states
 that-
 In other words, derecognition is to be
 legally irrelevant in deciding issues Involv-
 ing Taiwan under United States law. In
 particular, this section preserves the rights
 and obligations of Taiwan under United
 States law.
 Is it correct to say that the intent of
 the Foreign Relations Committee and
 the provisions of S. 245 are consistent
 with that expressed House Committee
 position.
 Mr. CHURCH. Yes; the committee
 intends that the provisions of S. 245 will
 lead to the same result in that regard,
 as the expressed House committee posi-
 tion. In effect, the operation of this bill
 is intended to satisfy fully the proced-
 ural requirements of the Atomic Energy
 Act and the Nuclear Nonproliferation
 Act, and further, the facts of the Presi-
 dent's action in recognizing the People's
 Republic of China, the absence of diplo-
 matic relations between the people on
 Taiwan and the United States or the
 lack of recognition by the United States,
 and the attendant circumstances there-
 to will be legally irrelevant in any admin-
 istrative or judicial proceeding dealing
 with nuclear export license applications
 or other authorized forms of cooperation
 in the peaceful uses of atomic energy
 with the people on Taiwan. So, this bill
 and our intent are consistent with the
 House companion bill and the House
 committee position in this regard.
 Mr. McCLURE. With regard to the
 specific, step-by-step procedures for riu-
 clear exports and other authorized forms
 of cooperation in atomic energy, would

 A
 t
 p          on
 a i
 c
 of 1978 (NNPA),
 contains numerous provisions relating
 to nuclear cooperation with foreign "na-
 tions." For example, section 123 of the
 Atomic Energy Act, as amended, re-
 quires an agreement for cooperation
 with a "nation" before certain specified
 cooperation may be undertaken. Section
 127 establishes criteria that must be met
 by nations for nuclear export. Such pro-
 visions, under section 101 (a) of the Tai-
 wan Enabling Act (TEA), would be ap-
 plicable to the people on Taiwan.
 Section 104 of the proposed TEA con-
 firms that all treaties and other inter-
 national agreements entered into be-
 tween the United States and the gov-
 ernment recognized as the Republic of
 China prior to January 1, 1979, and in
 force until December 31, 1978, shall con-
 tinue in force unless and until termi-
 nated in accordance with law. In ac-
 cordance with this provision, the agree-
 ment for cooperation with Taiwan and
 any other applicable international agree-
 ments in the nuclear field continue in
 perform, on behalf of the United States
 or any department or agency or enforce
 .agreements or other arrangements rela-
 tive to the people on Taiwan.
 Section 109 of the proposed TEA pro-
 vides that any performance, communica-
 tion assurance, undertaking or other
 action on behalf of the people on Taiwan
 ,shall. be rendered, in the manner and to
 the extent directed by the President,
 through an instrumentality established
 by the people on Taiwan. In connection
 with this section, it is noted that Taiwan
 has announced the establishment of the
 Coordination Council for North Ameri-
 can Affairs (CCNAA) to act as this in-
 strumentality. It is anticipated that the
 President will direct that performance,
 -communication, assurances, undertak-
 ings, and other actions in the nuclear
 area be rendered or provided to or re-
 ceived or accepted from the CCNAA.
 Proposed section 109 authorizes this to be
 done on behalf of the United States or

 sional notification, review and approval
 requirements and procedure as if such
 agreements are made by or through the
 department or agency of the" United
 States on behalf of which the Institute
 is acting. The Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee report indicates that this
 provision insures that procedures paral-
 lel to currently applicable procedures for
 agreements for cooperation under sec-
 tion 123 of the Atomic Energy Act will
 apply.
 Within this framework, the same pro-
 cedures established by the NNPA, the
 Nuclear Regulatory Commission's regu-
 lations contained in 10 CFR part 110,
 and the executive branch procedures
 published at 43 Federal Register 25326-
 30 will apply. These procedures are de-
 scribed in chapter IX of the First Annual
 Report of the President to the Congress
 pursuant to section 601 of the NNPA.
 The procedural variance in the appli-
 cation of the procedures is that we en-
 visage that the CCNAA will act, in all
 respects, on behalf of the people on Tai-
 wan in the export process. To the extent
 that the USG must deal with, seek as-
 surances from, or receive assurances
 from the CCNAA, the USG will act
 through the ATT.
 Thus, the export licensing process for
 source or special nuclear material or
 production or utilization facilities would
 be as follows:
 The process is initiated when the U.S.
 company that is either the shipper of
 the source or special nuclear material
 or the exporter of the production or utili-
 zation facility submits an application for
 an export license to the NRC. The Com-
 mission then requests the executive
 branch analysis and judgment provided
 for in section 126 of the Atomic Energy
 Act, as amended.
 In preparing this judgment, the ex-
 ecutive branch would seek, in accord-
 ance with section 1(c) of part B of the
 executive  branch  procedures,  confir-
 mation that the export would be subject
 to the terms and conditions of the
 United States-Taiwan Agreement for
 Cooperation, that the consignee I; au-
 thorized to receive the export, and that
 adequate physical security measures will
 be maintained. Since it is the task of the
 Department of Energy to obtain this
 confirmation, the Department of Energy
 would submit the request to the AIT
 which would transmit it to the CCNAA.
 The confirmation of the CCNAA on be-
 half of the people on Taiwan would be
 transmitted back to the Department of
 Energy by the AlT and would in all re-
 spects satisfy the requirements of law.
 The executive branch judgment and
 analysis would deal with the criteria
 specified by law and would, in addition,
 transmit to the NRC this confirmation.
 When the NRC receives the executive
 branch judgment and analysis, the ex-
 port license application would, in all re-
 spects, be treated as any other similar
 application. If during the course of either
 NRC or executive branch consideration
 of an export license application concern-
 ing Taiwan there arose a need to seek
 further assurrances or obtain further in-
 formation, the request would be trans-
 mitted by the Department of State
 through the AIT to the CCNAA, which
 would provide the necessary assurances
 or information.
 At this point in the RECORD, I ask
 unanimous consent to include a letter
 from the Department of State confirming
 the administration's intent to proceed in
 the manner I have outlined. Again, these
 procedures are intended, as a matter of
 law, to satisfy all of the Atomic Energy
 Act and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act
 procedural requirements for continued
 cooperation.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 Washington, D.C., March 8, 1979.
 Hon. FRANK CHURCH,
 Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee,
 U. S. Senate.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN:
 This letter is in response to your request
 for a description of how the Administration
 expects the proposed Taiwan Enabling Act,
 S. 245, to be implemented with respect to the
 processing of nuclear exports. The Depart-
 ment has prepared the enclosed summary
 document to clarify this matter.
 I believe this explanation shows that, un-
 der the pending bill, the absence of diplo-
 matic relations will be irrelevant to contin-
 ued nuclear exports to Taiwan. Apart from
 the involvement of the American Institute in
 Taiwan and the Coordination Council for
 North American Affairs in the procedures,
 nuclear exports will proceed on the same
 basis as prior to U.S. normalization of rela-
 tions with the People's Republic of China.
 I hope the enclosed explanation will be
 helpful to the Senate in its consideration of
 the proposed legislation.
 Sincerely,
 DOUGLAS J. BENENT,
 Assistant Secretary for
 Congressional Relations.
 SUMMARY  OF                               NUCLEAR EXPORT  PROCEDURES
 APPLICABLE    TO                         THE PEOPLE      ON  TAIWAN
 UNDER S. 245
 Under the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
 as, most recently amended by the Nuclear
 Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA), an
 "agreement for cooperation" is a prerequisite
 for the export of nuclear reactors and fuel.
 Such agreements are concluded in accord-
 ance with a procedure established by section
 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. Actual exports
 of reactors and fuel pursuant to such agree-
 ments are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory
 Commission, after it has received the judg-
 ment of the Executive branch on whether the
 license should be issued. This licensing is
 done in accordance with substantive export
 licensing criteria established by law and un-
 der procedures established by law, regula-
 tions, and Executive branch department and
 agency procedures.
 The United States entered into a nuclear
 cooperation agreement with the Republic of
 China in 1955. This agreement, as amended,
 was superseded by an agreement that entered
 into force in 1972 and'was amended in 1974.
 Exports of nuclear reactors and fuel have
 been licensed under these agreements.
 With respect to the authority for con-
 tinued nuclear exports to Taiwan, section
 101(a) of the proposed Taiwan Enabling Act
 S. 245, provides that whenever any law, regu-
 lation, or order the U.S. refers or relates to a
 foreign "nation", or uses another such Sim-
 ilar term, such term shall include, and such
 law, regulation or order shall apply with re-
 spect to, the people on Taiwan. In this re-
 gard, the Foreign Relations Committee re-
 port (Report No. 96-7, 96th Congress, 1st
 session) indicates that section 101(a) con-
 tinues the eligibility of the people on Taiwan
 under the Atomic Energy Act.
 Section 104 of S. 245 confirms that all
 treaties and other international agreements
 entered into between the U.S. and the gov-
 ernment  recognized  as  the  Republic  of
 China prior to January 1, 1979, and in force
 until December 31, 1978, shall continue in
 force unless and until terminated in accord-
 ance with law.
 Section 105 of S. 245 provides for the con-
 tinuance of programs, transactions and other
 relations with respect to the people on Tai-
 wan in accordance with applicable laws in
 the U.S. The Foreign Relations Committee
 report makes clear that this will assure con-
 tinuation of authority for nuclear exports.
 Section 106(a)  of S. 245 provides that
 U.S. Government programs, transactions and
 other relations with respect to the people on
 Taiwan shall, in the manner and to the ex-
 tent directed by the President be carried out
 by or through the American Institute in
 Taiwan (AIT).
 Section 108 of S. 245 empowers the Al'r, in
 the manner and to the extent directed by
 the President, to enter into, perform, ,enforce.
 or have in force agreements or arrangements
 relative to the people on Taiwan.
 Section 109 of S. 245 provides that any per-
 formance, communication, assurance, under-
 taking or other action on behalf of the peo-
 ple on Taiwan shall be rendered, in the man-
 ner and to the extent directed by the Presi-
 dent,  through  an instrumentality  estab-
 lished by the people on Taiwan.
 The Presidential directives under sections
 106, 108 and 109, since provided for by stat-
 ute, will have the force of law and be bind-
 ing on all persons and government agencies.
 Section 401  (c)  of S. 245 indicates that
 agreements and transactions made by or
 through the Institute shall be subject to the
 same congressional notification, review and
 approval requirements and procedure as if
 such agreements are made by or through
 the Department or Agency of the U.S. on
 behalf of which the Institute is acting.
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 report indicates that this provision insures
 that procedures parallel to currently appli-
 cable procedures for agreements for cooper-
 ation under section 123 of the Atomic Energy
 Act will apply.
 The Atomic Energy Act contains numer-
 ous provisions relating to nuclear coopera-
 tion with foreign "nations". For example,
 section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act re-
 quires an agreement for cooperation with a
 "nation" before certain specified cooperation
 may be undertaken. Section 127 establishes
 criteria that must be met by nations for nu-
 clear export. Such provisions, under section
 101 (a) of S. 245, wolud be applicable to the
 people on Taiwan.
 In accordance with section 104 of S. 245,
 and with the stated concurrence of the au-
 thorities on Taiwan, the agreement for coop-
 eration with Taiwan and any other applicable
 international agreements in the nuclear field
 continue in force. Section 405 (a) of the
 NNPA confirms the authority to continue
 cooperation under agreement entered into
 prior to enactment of that Act. Section 104
 of S. 245 makes clear this applies in the case
 of Taiwan.
 Section 105 of S. 245 reconfirms that nu-
 clear programs, transaction and relations
 with Taiwan may continue in accordance
 with law.
 Under section 106(a) of S. 245, it is an-
 ticipated that the President will direct that
 these nuclear  programs,  transactions  and
 other relations be carried out by or through
 the AIT. Transactions by private U.S.. firms
 in nuclear matters would, of course, con-
 tinue on a direct basic without AIT in-
 volvement.
 It is further anticipated. that the Presi-
 dent will, in connection with section 108 of
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050010-1

 S 2342                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 S. 245, direct that agreements or arrange-
 ments in the nuclear field be entered into,
 performed, enforced or considered to be in
 force by or through the AIT. Thus, pursuant
 to this section (and to section 405 (a) of
 the NNPA, mentioned above), the current
 nuclear cooperation agreement with Taiwan
 remains in force and valid authority for'ex-
 ports thereunder. Further, section 404 (a)
 of the NNPA requires the President to seek
 to renegotiate such agreements. Section 108
 of S. 245 makes clear that the AIT may
 enter into such an agreement. Further the
 AIT will be able to perform, on behalf of the
 U.S. or any department or agency or enforce
 agreements or other arrangements relative
 to the people on Taiwan.
 Taiwan has announced the establishment
 of  the  Coordination  Council  for  North
 American Affairs (CCNAA) to act as its in-
 strumentality for unofficial dealings on be-
 half of the people on Taiwan. It is antici-
 pated that the President will, in connection
 with section 109 of S. 245, direct that per-
 formance, communication, assurances, un-
 dertakings and other actions in the nuclear
 area be rendered or provided to or received
 or accepted from the CCNAA. Proposed sec-
 tion 109 authorizes this to be done on be-
 half of the U.S. or any department or
 agency. Thus, assurance that a proposed ex-
 port is subject to the U.S.-Taiwan Agree-
 ment for Cooperation may be provided by
 and received from the CCNAA. Further, any
 clarification or assurance required during
 the process of export license applications
 would be obtained from the CCNAA.
 Within this framework, the same proce-
 dure is established by the NNPA, the Nuclear
 Regulatory Commission's regulations con-
 tained in 10 CFR Part 110, and the Executive
 Branch Procedures published at 43 Federal
 Register 25326-30 will apply. These proce-
 dures are described in Chapter IX of the
 First Annual Report of the 'resident to
 the Congress pursuant to section 601 of the
 NNPA.
 The significant variance in the applica-
 tion of the regulations and procedures is
 that we envisage that the CCNAA will act,
 in all respects, on behalf of the people on
 Taiwan in the export process. To the extent
 that the United States Government must
 deal with, seek assurances from, or receive
 assurances from the CCNAA, the United
 States Government will act through the AIT.
 Thus, the export licensing process for
 source or special nuclear material or pro-
 duction or utilization facilities would be as
 follows.
 The process is initiated when a company
 that is either arranging or the transport of
 the source or special nuclear material or is
 the supplier of the production or utilization
 facility submits an application for'-an ex-
 port license to the NRC. The Commission
 then requests the Executive branch. analysis
 and judgment provided for in section 126 of
 the Atomic Energy Act.
 in preparing this judgment, the Executive
 branch would seek, in accordance with sec-
 tion 1 (c) of Part B of the Executive Branch
 Procedures, confirmation . that the export
 would be subject to the terms and conditions
 of the U.S.-Taiwan Agreement for Cooper-
 ation, that the consignee is authorized to re-
 ceive the export, and that adequate physical
 security measures will be maintained. Since
 it ,is the task of the Department of Eenrgy to
 obtain this confirmation, the Department of
 Energy would submit the request to the AIT
 which would transmit it to the CCNAA. The
 confirmation of the CCNAA on behalf of the
 people on Taiwan would be transmitted back
 to the Department of Energy by the AIT and
 would in all respects satisfy the requirements
 of law.
 The Executive branch judgment and anal-
 ysis would deal with the criteria specified by
 law and would, in addition, transmit to the
 NEC this confirmation.
 When the NRC receives the Executive
 branch judgment and analysis, the export
 license application would, in all respects, be
 treated as any other similar application. If
 during the course of either NRC or Executive
 branch consideration of an export license
 application concerning Taiwan there arose a
 need to seek further assurances or obtain
 further information, the request would be
 transmitted by the Department of State
 through the AIT to the CNAA, which would
 provide the necesary assurances or informa-
 tion.
 Mr. McCLURE. A memorandum of
 January 30, 1979, to the Commissioners
 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
 from the Commission's General Counsel,
 Subject: Legal Issues Arising from the
 United States' New China Policy, raises
 a series of questions about continued
 nuclear exports to Taiwan resulting
 from the January 1, 1979, change in sta-
 tus, including the issue of the legal defi-
 nition of "nation" in the Atomic Energy
 Act, the status of the 1972 Agreement for
 Cooperation, the status of assurances
 and commitments, the legal import of the
 People's Republic of China recognition,
 and other issues. Would you agree that
 S. 245 addresses and disposes of all of
 those legal issues, so that cooperation in
 the peaceful uses of atomic energy, in-
 cluding nuclear exports, can continue,
 without any legal impediments, as be-
 fore?
 Mr. CHURCH. Yes. S. 245 addresses
 and dispenses directly of those issues in
 the January 30 memorandum to insure
 that there is full legal authority to con-
 tinue that cooperation, including nu-
 clear exports, and it is our specific in-
 tent that the authority shall be- used so
 that continued cooperation will result.
 Mr. McCLURE. A letter of February 15,
 1979, to Chairman ZABLOCKI of the House
 Foreign Affairs Committee from the Nu-
 clear Regulatory Commission's General
 Counsel responded to -a series of ques-
 tions from the chairman on the issue of
 continued cooperation, including nuclear
 exports. The letter raised some additional
 issues regarding the legal import of the
 status of the people on Taiwan for nu-
 clear export statutory criteria, the legal
 authority of the American Institute on
 Taiwan and its counterpart instrumen-
 tality, under the Atomic Energy Act and
 the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, to pro-
 cedurally continue cooperation, includ-
 ing nuclear exports, the authority of the
 President to establish the specific pro-
 cedures, and other issues. Does S. 245
 address and dispose of all the legal issues
 raised in the February 15, 1979, letter,
 so that cooperation can. continue without
 any legal impediments, as before?
 W. CHURCH. Yes. S. 245 addresses
 and disposes directly of all those issues
 in the February 15 letter to insure that
 there is full legal authority to continue
 that cooperation, including nuclear ex-
 ports, and it is our specific intent that
 the authority shall be used so that con-
 tinued cooperation will result.
 Mr. McCLURE. Would you -agree, then,
 that the pending amendment will clarify
 fully, as a matter of law -in the statute,
 the clear intent of the Congress that all
 of the aforementioned legal and pro-
 cedural questions are resolved in the bill
 and that this bill shall authorize and as-
 sure continued cooperation, including
 nuclear exports?
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree completely with
 your statement of the effect of the
 amendment and the intent of the Con-
 gress in enacting it in this bill.
 Mr. McCLURE. It is my intent by of-
 fering this amendment that the scope of
 the amendment not only apply to export
 licenses and applications, but also tech-
 nology transfers, subsequent arrange-
 ments and any other authorized form of
 cooperation with the people on Taiwan
 in . the peaceful uses of atomic energy
 pursuant to both the Atomic Energy Act
 of '1954, as amended, and the Nuclear
 Nonproliferation Act of 1978. Is that also
 your intent in agreeing to accept this
 amendment?
 Mr. CHURCH. Yes; the intent Is not
 to limit the scope of the amendment in
 a legal sense to only export licenses and
 applications.
 Mr. President, I find this amendment
 acceptable, and I believe .that it clarifies
 the matter of real importance to the
 United States in the field of implement-
 ing our nuclear policy.
 I commend the Senator for offering
 the amendment.
 Mr. President, I move the adoption of
 the amendment.
 Mr.  JAVITS.  Mr.  President,  the
 amendment is acceptable to me, and I
 am grateful for the explanation about
 the detail of 'what the Senator from
 Idaho intends.
 I thank my colleague.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator
 from New York.
 Mr. McCLURE..I thank the Senator
 from New York.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, with the
 support of the ranking minority mem-
 ber, I again move the adoption of the
 amendment. -
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to the amendment
 of the Senator from Idaho.
 The amendment was agreed to.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the

 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT AND THE U.S.-ROC
 MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY
 ? Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, today
 we are considering the Taiwan Enabling
 Act, S. 245. I support that legislation as
 an essential part of the process of nor-
 malization and the establishment of full
 diplomatic relations with the People's
 Republic of China while at the same time
 maintaining our strong commercial, cul-
 tural, and other relations with the people
 on Taiwan on an unofficial, but no less
 substantive, basis.
 One of the essential acts in the process
 of normalization of relations with the
 People's Republic of China was the ter-
 mination of the mutual defense treaty
 between the Republic of China on Tai-
 wan and the United States.
 The President, on behalf of the United
 States, has given notice of the termina-
 tion of that treaty effective December 31,
 1979. I .personally believe that this ac-
 tion of the President was c6rrect and

 within his authorized and constitutional
 powers because article X of the treaty
 expressly authorizes such termination.
 However, the constitutional question
 of the power of a President to so termi-
 nate the mutual defense treaty is the
 subject of a considerable difference of
 opinion, including that of t*o of the
 most distinguished colleagues in this
 Senate Chamber. Senator KENNEDY, the
 distinguished  senior  Senator  from
 Massachusetts, is of the firm view that
 President Carter was right in recognizing
 the People's Republic of China and in
 giving notice to terminate the mutual
 defense treaty with Taiwan.
 The distinguished senior Senator from
 Arizona, Senator GOLDWATER, is of the
 equally firm view that the President does
 not have the power unilaterally to ter-
 minate the mutual defense treaty with
 the Republic of China, whatever the
 merits of recognizing the People's Re-
 public of China as the sole legal govern-
 ment of China. Senator GOLDWATER is of
 the view that the President needs either
 two-thirds approval of the U.S. Senate or
 congressional concurrence. This consti-
 tutional issue has now been presented by
 Senator GOLDWATER and some of his col-
 leagues both in the House and Senate
 to our judicial system for resolution.
 Both Senator KENNEDY and Senator
 GOLDWATER have presented their views in
 the current issue of the American Bar
 Association Journal.  Senator KENNEDY
 has written an article supporting his
 view under the title "Normal Relations
 with China: Good Law, Good Policy."
 And Senator GOLDWATER has presented
 his views immediately following Senator
 KENNEDY'S views in an article entitled
 "Treaty Termination Is A Shared Power."
 Mr. President, I welcome these two
 articles and their scholarly and succinct
 presentation of the constitutional ques-
 tions and public policies involved. I per-
 sonally believe that Senator KENNEDY'S
 position is the stronger position from the
 standpoint, of constitutional law and his-
 tory and is the preferable position from
 the standpoint of the conduct of foreign
 policy. However, I think it important that
 each of us consider both sides of this
 important question.
 Mr. President, I ash that the text of
 the article by the Honorable EDWARD M.
 KENNEDY and the article by the Honor-
 able BARRY M. GOLDWATER in the Febru-
 ary 1979, issue of the American Bar
 As- sociation Journal be printed in the
 RECORD.
 The articles are as follows :
 NORMAL RELATIONS WITH CHINA: GOOD LAW,
 GOOD POLICY
 (By EDWARD M. KENNEDY)
 For almost three decades, until the end of
 1978, American foreign policy was plagued
 by an anomaly. Alone among the major na-
 tions of the world, the United States had
 failed to recognize officially a basic fact of
 international life-that the People's Republic
 of China effectively governs China's terri-
 tory and one billion people. But last Decem-
 ber 15 President Carter courageously decided
 to establish diplomatic relations with the
 People's Republic as of January 1. 1979, and
 to exchange ambassadors on March 1. He
 thereby successfully concluded the normal-
 ization process begun by President Nixon and
 Chairman Mao ip the 1972 Shanghai com-
 munique.
 At the same time the president notified Pe-
 king's rival, the Republic of China on'Tai-
 wan, that the United States would terminate
 diplomatic relations with it. The two com-
 peting governments have long held that only
 one of them can be recognized as the gov-
 ernment of China and that Taiwan is a part
 of China. The president also announced that
 the United States would give notice on Janu-
 ary 1-as it did-of its intention to termi-
 nate one year hence the 1954 Mutual Defense
 Treaty with the government of Taiwan under
 Article 10 of the treaty.
 The United States formerly declared, how-
 ever, its continued interest in the peaceful
 resolution of the Taiwan issue and the con-
 tinuation of commercial, cultural, and other
 nongovernmental relationships with the peo-
 ple of Taiwan. The Carter administration
 also provided for Taiwan's future ability to
 defend itself by making clear that its au-
 thorities could continue to purchase selected
 defensive weapons in the United States.
 I welcome and support this decision. It was
 right in its recognition of the reality of
 China. It was responsible in its provision for
 the continuing well-being of the people of
 Taiwan. It was a well-timed stroke of grand
 strategy, giving the United States maximum
 benefit in our triangular relationship with
 China and the Soviet Union, consolidating
 the unprecedented process of accommoda-
 tion among China, Japan, and the United
 States, and ushering in a new era of co-
 operation and friendship between the world's
 most powerful and the world's most pop-
 ulous nations.
 In thus establishing a normal and endur-
 ing relationship with China, the president
 enhanced the prospects for peace and pros-
 perity of Taiwan. By changing the form of
 our relations with the island, the president
 enhanced  their  substance  and durability.
 While Peking continues to maintain that
 Taiwan "is entirely China's internal affair,"
 it has not contradicted the statement that
 the United States "continues to have an in-
 terest in the peaceful resolution of the Tai-
 wan issue and expects that the Taiwan is-
 sue will be settled peacefully by the Chinese
 themselves." In addition, although Premier
 Hua Kuo-feng registered China's objection
 to continuing American arms sales to Tai-
 wah, he said that, despite these differing
 views, "nevertheless the joint communique
 was reached."
 Chinese leaders have often stated their
 preference for a peaceful resolution of the
 Taiwan issue, and one can understand why.
 Peking is preoccupied with the Soviet mili-
 tary threat, and it lacks the military means
 successfully to invade Taiwan.  It is clearly
 interested in improving its relations with
 the West, especially the United States and
 Japan, in order to promote both parallel ac-
 tion to balance Soviet power and cooperative
 arrangements to modernize its agriculture,
 industry, technology, and defense. Nothing
 would more surely jeopardize this vital stra-
 tegic endeavor than the use of force against
 Taiwan.
 Of course, circumstances may'change over
 time, and it is noteworthy that the United
 States managed to normalize relations with-
 out undermining the legal basis for Amer-
 ican action in behalf of Taiwan in the un-
 likely event that should become necessary.
 The recent joint communique did nothing
 to clarify the United States' view of the legal
 status of the island, which the Shanghai
 communique left artfully obscure. In the
 new communique the United States simply
 "acknowledges the Chinese position that .. .
 Taiwan is part of China."
 This creative ambiguity in our legal posi-
 tion leaves open what actions we might take
 to assure the peaceful future of Taiwan, just
 as that question was left open under the now
 terminating 1954 defense treaty, which pro-
 vides only the vague assurance that, in the
 event of attack, the United States will "meet
 the common danger in accordance with its
 constitutional processes."
 I believe that the combination of improved
 Sino-American sties, continuing nongovern-
 mental relations with Taiwan (including ac-
 cess to defensive arms), and Washington's
 statement of interest' in a peaceful settle-
 ment of the island's future will give Taiwan
 increased security and prosperity. To help
 realize this prospect, I intend to join in
 sponsoring  legislation  that  will  facilitate
 nongovernmental contact with  the        island
 and will sustain its well-being.
 CAN THE EXECUTIVE TERMINATE THE TREATY ON
 ITS OWN,?
 Despite these measures to safeguard the
 island, some critics have denounced President
 Carter's normalization decision as a "stab
 in the back" of Taiwan. Sen. Barry Gold-
 water and others are now challenging, in the
 courts as well as in Congress, the presiden-
 tial notice terminating the defense treaty.
 They incorrectly argue that the executive
 lacks authority to terminate the treaty, ac-
 cording to its own terms, without the ap-
 proval of two thirds of the  Senate or  a
 majority of each house of Congress.
 I strongly oppose  this challenge, which
 threatens to sidetrack one of the most im-
 portant foreign policy initiatives of recent
 history  into  domestic constitutional con-
 troversy. I am confident that this effort will
 fail, for law, practice, and policy clearly sup-
 port the president's notice of termination
 in these circumstances. It is in no one's.in-
 terest to throw our future relations with
 Taiwan into legal limbo, instead of assuring
 the continuity of our relations with  the
 people of that island.
 The president might have avoided the con-
 stitutional question by simply exercising his
 unchallenged prerogative to recognize the
 People's Republic as the government of China
 and to establish diplomatic relations with it.
 As demonstrated by the experience of other
 nations that have switched recognition from
 Taipei to Peking, this would halve led to the
 lapse of the 1954 defense treaty and of the
 other bilateral agreements between Washing-
 ton and Taipei, which Peking has always re-
 garded as invalid, with the Congress then
 providing for continuing nongovernmental
 relations  with  Taiwan.  By reiterating  its
 previous declarations that the defense treaty
 was a nullity, Peking could have left no
 doubt that the treaty no longer had legal
 effect, as a consequence of the position of
 China's    new   government  rather      than
 through a termination decision by Washing-
 ton.
 The president chose, however, to end the
 defense treaty according to its one-year ter-,
 minatiomprovision and to state that other
 agreements with the Republic of China on
 Taiwan endure until replaced by new ar-
 rangements  with  the  authorities  on  the
 island. Whatever the merits of the latter
 claim under international law and practice,
 the president plainly has the independent
 authority to terminate a treaty according
 to its notice provision. .
 Although the Constitution requires the
 president to obtain the advice and consent
 of the Senate prior to concluding a treaty, it
 sets forth no such requirement for terminat-
 ing a treaty. In approving the 1954 defense
 treaty with the Republic of China, the Senate
 might have required the president to ob-
 tain the approval of the Senate or Congress
 prior to termination, but it chose not to do
 so. The treaty simply provides for termina-
 tion with one year's notice. In the light of
 20th century practice, this plainly confers
 on the president the power to terminate the
 treaty at his discretion. In his December 15,

 1978, momorandum to Secretary of State
 Vance, the State Department legal adviser,
 Herbert J. Hansel, stated categorically that
 "the president has the authority to decide
 under the Constitution whether the United
 States shall give the notice of termination
 provided for in Article X of the U.S.-R.O.C.
 Mutual  Defense  Treaty and to give  that
 notice  without  congressional  or Senate
 action."
 Presidents have given notice of treaty ter-
 mination independent of the Senate or Con-
 gress on 14 separate occasions in our nation's
 history, and ten of these instances have oc-
 curred in the last 50 years:
 1815 (Madison). Agreement on annulment
 of 1782 Treaty of Amity and Commerce with
 the Netherlands.
 1899 (McKinley). Notice of termination of
 certain articles of 1850 Convention of Friend-
 ship,  Commerce,  and  Extradition  with
 Switzerland.
 1920 (Wilson). Agreement on termination
 of 1891 Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and
 Navigation with Belgium concerning the
 Congo.
 1927 (Coolidge). Notice of termination of
 1925 treaty with Mexico on prevention of
 smuggling.
 1933  (Roosevelt). Notice of withdrawal
 from 1921 multilateral Convention for the
 Abolition of Imports and Export Prohibi-
 tions and Restrictions.
 1933 (Roosevelt). Declaration of termina-
 tion   (withdrawn  subsequently)   of  1931
 Treaty of Extradition with Greece.
 1936 (Roosevelt). Protocol of termination
 (withdrawn subsequent) of 1871 Treaty of
 Commerce and Navigation with Italy.
 1939 (Roosevelt). Notice of denunciation
 of 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation
 with Japan.
 1944 (Roosevelt). Notice of termination of
 1929 protocol to Inter-American Convention
 for Trademark and Commercial Protection.
 1948 (Truman). Notice of withdrawal from
 1937 multilateral Convention for the Reg-
 ulation of Whaling.
 1954 (Eisenhower). Notice of withdrawal
 from  1923  Convention  on  Uniformity of
 Nomenclature for the Classification of Mer-
 chandise.
 1962 (Kennedy). Notice of termination of
 1902 Convention on Commercial Relations
 with Cuba.
 1965  (Johnson). Notice of denunciation
 (subsequently withdrawn)  of 1929 Warsaw
 Convention  concerning  international 'air
 travel.
 1975 (Ford). Notice of termination of par-
 ticipation in the International Labor Orga-
 nization.
 Especially in the 19th century, presidents
 occasionally terminated treaties at the di-
 rection of or with the prior or subsequent
 consent of the Senate or the Congress. But
 this fact in no way negates the' president's
 power to act independently. In modern prac-
 tice this presidential exercise of independent
 authority outnumbers the total of all other
 methods utilized.
 Since 1920 only President Hoover and Nixon
 have not terminated treaties pursuant to a
 notice provision. All other modern presi-
 dents, from Wilson through  Carter,  have
 exerted their valid constitutional authority
 by terminating treaties without formal ad-
 vice and consent. Their actions have been
 accepted by the Congress and unchallenged
 in the courts.
 No  American  judicial  decisions  directly
 address the question of the president's right,
 pursuant to a notice provision, to terminate
 a treaty without formal congressional ap-
 proval. Some court cases assume independ-
 ent presidential                        power  to terminate.    In
 Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U.S. 447 (1913), for
 example, the Supreme Court pointed out
 that it is for the president to determine
 whether a treaty violation has occurred and,
 if so, whether termination is warranted.
 And in Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U.S. 270
 (1902), the Supreme Court held that on the
 question of whether an American treaty with
 Prussia survived the formation of the Ger-
 man Empire, the actions of -the executive
 branch and the German government were of
 controlling importance.
 Often the issue of treaty termination is
 related intimately to the question of recogni-
 tion of a foreign sovereign and establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations, as indeed it is
 in the case of China, and both questions
 have been regarded as requiring political
 judgments that are within the president's
 authority.
 An overwhelming number of contemporary
 scholars of international and constitutional
 law who have considered this question agree
 that the president has the clear prerogative
 to give notice of termination, pursuant to a
 notice provision in a treaty, without the ap-
 proval of the Senate or the Congress.' The
 American Law Institute takes the same posi-
 tion in Sections 155 and 163 of the Restate-
 ment of the Law (Second), Foreign Relations
 of the United States.
 PRESIDENT  CAN'T ENTANGLE ALONE, BUT HE
 CAN DISENTANGLE
 Sound historical and policy reasons sustain
 this conclusion. The framers of the Consti-
 tution feared "entangling alliances" and re-
 quired the president to obtain the advice and
 consent of two thirds of the Senate prior to
 concluding a treaty. The framers manifested
 no similar concern with the president's exer-
 cise of discretion to disentangle the nation
 from alliances, and the Constitution thus
 imposed no requirement of Senate participa-
 tion in treaty termination.
 In the absence of specific constitutional,
 treaty, or statutory language restraining the
 president, it has been understood that he is
 responsible for determining how to deal with
 treaties once concluded. For example, in re-
 ferring to the 1793 Neutrality Proclamation
 by President Washington and its relation to
 American treaties  with  France,  Alexander
 Hamilton wrote that "treaties can only be
 made by the President and Senate jointly;
 but their activity may be continued or sus-
 pended by the president alone." Hamilton,
 incidentally, made this statement with spe-
 cific reference to a situation almost identical
 to that involved in normalization with China.
 He wrote, as quoted in Letters of Paciflcus
 and Helvidius on the Proclamation of Neu-
 trality of 1793:
 "The right of the executive to receive am-
 bassadors and other public ministers, may
 serve to illustrate the relative duties of the
 executive and legislative departments. This
 right includes that of judging, in the case of
 a revolution of government in a foreign coun-
 try, whether, the new rulers are competent
 organs of the national will, and ought to be
 recognized, or not; which, where a treaty an-
 tecedently exists between the United States
 and such nation, involves the power of con-
 tinuing or suspending its operation. . . .

 the operation of national treaties, as a con-
 sequence of the power to receive public minis-
 ters, is an important instance of the right of
 the executive to decide upon the obligations
 of the country with regard to foreign na-
 tions."
 Despite the fact that the president's inde-
 pendent power to terminate treaties is well-
 established, supported decisively by modern
 practice, and accepted by the Congress and
 most scholars, Senator Goldwater now seeks
 to challenge it. Because the president, espe-
 cially in the nineteenth century, occasionally
 terminated a treaty with prior or subsequent
 Senate or congressional participation, he ar-
 gues that the president must always obtain
 legislative approval, except that, as he wroth
 in China and the Abrogation of Treaties,
 "history indicates the president may, if Con-
 gress raised no objection, determine whether
 or not a treaty (1) has been superseded by
 a later law or treaty inconsistent with ol:
 clearly intended to revise an earlier one, (2)
 has already been abrogated because of its
 violation by the other party, or (3) cannot be
 carried out because conditions essential to
 its continued effectiveness no longer exist
 and the change is not the result of our own
 action." He would dismiss the many instances
 of independent presidential treaty termina-
 tion as "exceptions" to the supposed general
 rule requiring legislative approval.
 Senator Goldwater's analysis is seriously
 flawed. When carefully examined, the in-
 stances of independent presidential termi-
 nation do not fall into the three categories
 of "exceptions" that he suggests. Rather,
 they demonstrate that the president has been
 free to terminate treaties in a variety of sit-
 uations whose common denominator is that
 in each case it was no longer wise for the
 United States to adhere to the treaty in ques-
 tion. Contrary to Senator Goldwater's asser-
 tion, most instances of independent presi-
 dential termination have occurred in cir-
 cumstances in which there was no incon-
 sistent law or treaty superseding the treaty
 in question, there was no violation by the
 other party, and there was no impossibility
 of performing treaty obligations.
 ? For  example,  Senator  Goldwater  claims
 that President Coolidge independently ter-
 minated our 1925 treaty with Mexico on the
 prevention of smuggling because it was "im-
 possible to implement the convention." Yet
 there is no factual basis for this contention.
 The  record  reveals  that  the  secretary  of
 state thought it inadvisable to retain the
 treaty so long as Mexico failed to conclude
 an   arrangement  safeguarding        American
 commerce against discrimination. (U.S. Ar-
 chives, 74 D 481, Box 16678.)
 Similarly, Senator Goldwater seeks to por-
 tray President Roosevelt's 1939 termination
 of the 1911 commercial treaty with Japan as
 being compelled by our obligations under
 the 1922 Nine-Power Agreement. But nothing-
 In the later agreement required the United
 States to terminate the purely commercial
 treaty.
 The only evidence offered to support Sena-
 tor Goldwater's view is a statement by Sena-'
 for  Schwellenback that  actually  shows
 that he did not believe it necessary to ter-
 minate  the  1911  treaty,                                                                                                                       (84  Cong. Rec.
 10785.) The treaty was terminated, as the
 notice stated, because it "contains provi-
 sions which need  new  consideration .
 with a view to better safeguarding and
 promoting American interests as new de-
 velopments may require."
 In fact, not only is Senator Goldwater's
 interpretation flawed by its misconstruction
 of the precedents, but it also is flawed
 logically as well. What is the source of the
 president's power to make "exceptions" un-
 less it derives from his authority to termi-
 nate a treaty without legislative approval?
 Why cannot the president make other "ex-

 it, it is inconceivable that the framers as-
 signed to one person power to denounce a
 commercial treaty that would be highly ben-
 eficial to the interests of a particular geo-
 graphic region or a peace treaty that had
 formally concluded a war and whose faithful
 adherence  would  presumably  advert  the
 chance of resumption of hostilities, however
 slight that chance may be. As the language
 of the Constitution does -not distinguish
 commercial and peace treaties from other
 treaties, such as a security pact, it is obvious
 that all treaties share the same protective
 armor.
 JOINT PARTICIPATION NEEDED FOR ANY
 "GENUINELY CRITICAL DECISION"
 In his landmark work on the subject in
 5 Seton Hall Law Review 527 (1974), Prof.
 Arthur Bestor persuasively shows that the
 doctrine of separation of powers is "pre-
 scribed as explicitly for the conduct of for-
 eign relations as for the handling of do-
 mestic matters" and explains: "The purpose
 and effect of any such arrangement is to re-
 quire the joint participation-the co-op-
 eration  and  concurrence-of  the  several
 branches in the making and carrying out of
 any genuinely critical decision."
 Justice Joseph Stork one of the foremost
 scholars to sit on the Supreme Court, con-
 firms his statement. In his Commentaries on
 the Constitution, Story writes, in connec-
 tion with the decision of the framers to
 allot the treaty authority jointly in the
 president and the Senate, "his joint pos-
 session of the power affords a greater security
 for its just exercise, than the separate pos-
 session of it by either" and that it "is too
 much to expect, that a free people would
 confide to a single magistrate, however re-
 spectable, the sole authority to act conclu-
 sively, as well as exclusively upon treaties."
 Story adds, in words having equal rele-
 vance to making or unmaking a treaty: "The
 check, which acts upon the mind from the
 consideration, that what is done is but pre-
 liminary, and? requires the assent or other in-
 dependent minds. to give it a legal conclu-
 siveness, is a restraint which awakens cau-
 tion, and compels to deliberation."
 This is what the framers had in mind in
 establishing a system of checks and balances.
 They sought to protect the security of the
 people by making the president and the Sen-
 ate checks on each other in the exercise of
 the full treaty power. By providing for the
 added deliberation and attention to the sub-
 ject that woud be required by vesting the
 full treaty power jointly with the president
 and at least one branch of the legislature,
 the security of the people would be far bet-
 ter protected than it would be if the power
 were conferred on a single officer. The se-
 curity that follows caution and added delib-
 eration woud be lost if no check had been
 put on the unmaking of a treaty.
 Why the framers woud want to offer the
 people security in the making of treaties, but
 not in their termination, is unexplained by
 those who argue this difference exists. I be-
 lieve there  is no difference and that the
 checks and balances called for in the separa-
 tion of powers is equally as applicable to the
 critical decision of casting aside our for-
 mal treaties with other nations as it is in
 making those treaties originally.
 The  early  authorities,  including  some
 among the Founding Fathers, saw the repeal
 of a treaty in,the same light as they saw
 the repeal of a statute. It would have been
 strange to hear anyone argue that the presi-
 dent, by his sole authority, could terminate
 whatever  treaty  he  wished, whenever   be
 wished. James Madison, for one, believed that
 "the same authority, precisely," would be
 exercised  in  annulling  as  in  making  a
 treaty."  Thomas  Jefferson,  when  he  was
 Washington,s first secretary of state, wrote
 a report in which he reasoned that the same
 authority who possessed the power of making
 treaties consequently had the power of de-
 claring them dissolved. And, when he was
 vice president, Jefferson compiled the first
 manual of rules of the Senate, in which he
 wrote: "Treaties being declared equally with
 the laws of the United States, to be the
 supreme law of the land, it is understood
 that an act of the legislature alone can de-
 clare them infringed and rescinded."
 Further evidence that the frames linked
 the repeal of treaties to the repeal of stat-
 utes appears in John Jay's brief analogy In
 The Federalist, Number 64: "They who make
 laws may, without doubt, amend or repeal
 them, and it will not be disputed the they
 who  make  treaties  may  alter  or  cancel
 them ..."
 Justice Iredell, who served on the first
 Supreme Court, shared the views of Madison
 and Jefferson as to the legislative role in
 terminating treaties. In an opinion accom-
 panying Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199 (1796),
 he twice stated his belief that Congress alone
 has "authority under our government" of
 declaring a treaty terminated, even in cir-
 cumstances where the other country has
 first violated it.
 Another authority who believed the legis-
 lature must act before a treaty is terminated
 is James Buchanan. In writing about the
 anticipated  cancellation  of  a  commercial
 treaty with Denmark considered damaging to
 our exports, then Secretary of State Bu-
 chanan wrote that "an act must first pass
 Congress to enable the president to give the
 required notice..   ." His official concession
 of the joint possession of power is especially
 noteworthy since that treaty contained  a
 provision similar to the one in the R.O.C. de-
 fense treaty so heavily relied on by President
 Carter.
 Each treaty authorizes termination after
 notice being given to the other party. How-
 ever, Secretary Buchanan obviously believed
 the sovereign authority who could make the
 decision to give notice was not the president
 alone, but the president, together with the
 authority of a law enacted by Congress.
 When the United States finally cancelled
 the treaty with Denmark, it was accom-
 plished by a Senate resolution of March 3,
 1855,  passed  unanimously,  which  advised
 and    consented  to  authorizing President
 Pierce to give notice of its termination. The
 president had requested the authority, there-
 by giving some indication of his belief that
 the decision-making authority was jointly
 possessed by him and the legislature, or at
 least one branch of it, and was not vested in
 him alone.
 The incident led to an authoritative report
 by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 in  1856. In response to public discussion
 over Whether the Senate had acted properly
 in authorizing presidential action without
 the concurrence of the House of Represent-
 atives, the committee concluded that the
 Senate and president jointly possessed com-
 petence to terminate a treaty "without the
 aid or intervention of legislation" by the
 other house. Speaking precisely to the same
 issue presented by Article X of the R.O.C.
 defense treaty, the committee decided that
 "where the right to terminate a treaty at
 discretion is reserved in the treaty itself,
 such  discretion resides  in  President  and
 Senate."
 The  committee  explained:  "The       whole
 power to bind the government by treaty is
 vested in  the  president and Senate,    two
 thirds of the senators present concurring.
 The treaty in question was created by the
 will of the treaty making power, and it con-
 tained a reservation by which that will
 should be revoked or its exercise cease on a
 stipulated notice. It is thus the will of the
 treaty-making power which is the subject of
 revocation, and it follows, that, the revoca-
 tion is incident to the will." Thus, the com-
 mittee clearly took a position at odds with
 the novel theory asserted by President Car-
 ter today.
 LODGE  THOUGHT  CONGRESS  COULD  DISAPPROVE
 TAFT'S  NOTICE
 Henry Cabot Lodge, when, he was chairman
 of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 in 1911, also believed the power of treaty ter-
 mination was jointly posssessed by the presi-
 dent and legislature. In response to a ques-
 tion in the Senate whether notice, given
 Russia by President Taft to terminate a com-
 mercial treaty because of Soviet violations,
 would be legal in the absence of congres-
 sional ratification, he replied, "Of course,
 Congress can disapprove his action; and then,
 I take it, the notice fails.... " Senator Lodge
 added his opinion that the power to ter-
 minate that treaty by notice, as authorized
 in an  article  thereof,; was  vested  in the
 Senate and president together "because in
 making such a treaty the Senate and thee
 president represent  the  high  contacting
 party."
 Lodge was then acting as floor manager of
 legislation that did ratify the president's
 action, and his statements clearly express his
 interpretation  of  the  term "contracting
 party," used in a treaty provision, as mean-
 ing the Senate and president jointly.
 In 1917 Prof. Edward Corwin, recognized
 as one of the leading authorities on the Con-
 stitution in this or any other century and
 generally a 'defender of broad presidential
 power, wrote: "[Al11 in all, it appears that
 legislative precedent, which moreover is gen-
 erally supported by the attitude of the execu-
 tive, sanctions the proposition that the power
 of terminating the international compacts to
 which the United States is party belongs, as a
 prerogative of sovereignty, to Congress alone."
 Another official admission of the necessity
 for legislative concurrence in the decision to
 provide notice in circumstances in which a
 treaty itself authorizes the giving of notice
 comes from an attorney general's opinion. In
 1941  Francis  Biddle, then acting attorney
 general, was asked to advise President Roose-
 velt whether, in view of the dislocation of
 ocean-borne commerce because of war, the
 International Loan Line Convention, which
 governed ocean tanker tonnage loads, had
 ceased to be binding. Biddle concluded the
 convention was inoperative because of the
 "well-established principle of international
 law, rebus sic stantibus, that a treaty ceases
 to be binding when the  basic conditions
 upon which it was founded have essentially
 changed."
 But he sharply qualified his opinion. While
 the president could decide whether the treaty
 was inoperative or suspended under this prin-
 ciple of international  law, the president
 alone could not terminate the treaty if he
 acted under a treaty provision allowing with-
 drawal by giving due notice. Biddle wrote:
 "It is not proposed that the United States
 denounce the convention under Article 25
 (47  Stat.  225),  nor that it be  otherwise`
 abrogated. Consequently, action by the Sen-
 ate or by the Congress is not required."
 Article 25 of that convention provided that
 it may be denounced by any "contracting,
 government"    by  notification  to the other
 parties and that the withdrawal should take
 effect 12 months after the date of notifica-
 tion is received. The article is similar to Ar-
 ticle X of the R.O.C. defense treaty, which
 likewise allows denunciation by the United
 States after one year's notice. Thus, it is clear
 that Biddle believed legislative concurrence
 was needed in order to authorize presidential
 action pursuant to the terms of a treaty in
 circumstances identical to those asserted by
 President Carter as grounds for unilateral
 action. President Carter's decision to notify
 the Republic of China on his sole authority
 is directly in conflict with a 20th century
 opinion of the country's highest law enforce-
 ment officer.

 the Senate when the treaty was ratified, it
 was that the term "party" meant the presi-
 dent and Senate jointly.
 But. the State Department would not only
 attribute a meaning to the R.O.C. defense
 treaty of which It never informed the Sen-
 ate. It would put the same,meaning on doz-
 ens of other major treaties that contain sim-
 ilar provisions. For example, the North At-
 lantic Treaty Alliance and our security pacts
 with South Korea, Japan, and the Philip-
 pines include articles allowing either "party"
 to withdraw after one year's notice. The Nu-
 clear Test Ban Treaty, the Statute of the
 International Atomic Energy Agency, the
 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Biolog-
 ical  Weapons  Convention,  the  Universal
 Copyright Convention, and the Outer Space
 Treaty, among others, each provide by their
 own terms for termination after one year's
 or less notice to the other parties. The con-
 sequences of accepting the State Depart-
 ment's interpretation of these provisions is
 far reaching indeed.
 No matter that the Senate was not clearly
 informed of what the language meant when
 It gave its advice and consent to ratifying
 these agreements. No matter that the execu-
 tive may have had a different understanding
 than the Senate and kept silent about it.
 When it suddenly suits the needs of ex-
 pediency for its policy of the moment, the
 State Department unveils a doctrine it has
 .hidden from public discussion. After having
 exploited the use of executive agreements to
 the point where the president can make vir-
 tually any treaty he wants by calling it a
 mere executive agreement, now the State
 Department is ready to usurp the power of
 unmaking treaties as well.
 Events in the year ahead may well deter-
 mine whether the executive succeeds or fails
 in this historic power grab.p
