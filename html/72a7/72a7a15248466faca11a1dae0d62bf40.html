SAIGON, July 13 (AP)?A-
merican-backed Meo tribes-
men were reported today- to 
have extended government 
control over all of the rain-
swept Plain of Jars in north-
ern Laos. . 
? The Laotian Defense Minis-
try in Vientiane said Moo spe-
cial forces met no significant 
'resistance in a week-old opera-
tion to take the area from the 
North Vietnamese and Pathet 
Lao forces. 
. U.S. B-52 and smaller tacii-
cal bombers struck inside 
Laos, hitting at the Ho Chi. 
Minh supply trail in the pan-
handle and also along Route 7 
leading from North Vietnam 
to the eastern edge of the 
plain. 
? Every year, the Meo forcPs, 
trained, equipped and paid by i 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency, have moved on to the 
plain during the summertime 
rainy season only to be pushed 
back by the North Vietnamese 
and Pathet Lao during the dry 
season, which starts in the 
fall. 
For the most part, the plain 
has been Communist-held ter-
ritory since 1964. 
[An official report issued 
today said that North Viet-
namses soldiers massacred 51 
civilians, mostly woman and 
Children, and wiped out much 
of an undefended village 
'north-of the Plain of Jars, UPI' 
reported from Saigon. 
. [The slaughter was discov-
ered last Saturday by the 
troops of Gen. yang Pao, mili-
tary sources said. Charred and 
mutilated bodies of the villag-
ers were strewn around the 
refugee village of Phou lila, 
where 70 homes were found 
gutted by fire, the sources 
said.] . 
Across South Vietnam, a 
near-total combat lull ex-
tended through a ninth day 
iand even U.S. air strikes were 
heavily curtailed by tropical 
storins.

'valosE orqum WAR NOW? 
From a third to a half of the returning S.PAsia 
invasion veterans have .used or are addicted to 
drugs. Traffic in opium is common among the gov-
ernment officials who are our puppets, according 
to John Ingersoll, director of the Bureau of Nar-
cotics before the 'House Select Committee on 
Crime on June 1st. "He said the heroin traffic is 
costing the U.S. $3.5 billion a year," according to 
1. F. Stone (June 14/71), and. that 173 .pounds of 
opium were found a few weeks ago on a plane of 
Air America, the CIA's airline operating illegally 
in Laos. 
Weapons supplied Chiang Kai Shek with our tax 
money were exchanged for opium which was sold 
to American soldiers in Vietnam with aid of a 
top general in Laos, according to Rep. Paul C. 
Rogers of Florida. Now, Senator Frank Church of 
Idaho reports that the State Dept. is opposing Con-
gressional bills that would cut off aid to countries 
that are sources of dope. Such laws would hurt 
diplomatic relations, according to Washington. 
If Nixon is riot in the dope business, you figure 
it out. The morals of this administration are 
straight from the gutter. And now Kissinger, 
Laird, and Rogers are out pimping in the provin-
.ces of the empire. Nixinger policy will make us 
a leper among nations. How stupid can the Repub-
licans get, LBJ included? ? .

-.Admission that special mnmando 
battalions, led by Americans, are eon-
ducting operations in northern Laos 
-adds new elements of deception and il-
legality to the conduct of the war in 
Indochina. 
The operation is aimed at regaining 
.control of the Plain of Jars and de-
stroying:, enemy food supplies and 
Somc eight ba Lialions; of Thai, 
Lao and Me() troops are involved. Lao-
tian sources say Americans arc lead-
ing the commando teams. American 
aircraft are also involved, 
This operatin is in direct viola-' 
tion of the State Department's 
pledge last Feb. 8 that no U. S. 
ground forces (ir advisers ?would 
cross into Laos. 
The operation also violates provi-
sions of the Defense Department ap-
propriations-. bill which prohibited fi-
nancing by the U. S. of military opera-
tions in support of the Cambodian or 
'Laotian governments except for ac-
tions to "promote the safe and orderly 
disengagement of U. S. troops front 
Southeast Asia or aid in the release of 
U.S. prisoners of war." 
? The secret Nvar in northern. Laos 
also violates the Geneva neutrality pact 
?,',962 endorsed by the United States. 
At a time when the U. S. in moving 
toward withdrawal o f U. S. troops 
from Vietnam and negotiations at the 
Paris peace talks appear to be closer 
to a cease-fire than ever before, .the 
operations in Laos are not only un7

By Mr. CASE: 
S. 2251. A bill to provide that the Presi-
dent notify Congress of his intention to 
exercise certain special authorities under 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
NOTICE TO CONGRESS OF FOREIGN MILITARY OR 
ECONOMIC ASS/STANCE TRANSFERS 
Mr. CASE. Mr. President, I am today 
introducing legislation which would re-
quire the President to give Congress ad-
vance notice of money transfers within 
the foreign military and economic assist-
ance programs. - 
..' I have long been concerned by the so-
called "flexibility" written into the For-
eign Assistance Act. The President now 
has authority to shift large amounts of 
money programed for one country to 
another country, with the proviso that 
he notify Congress within 30 days. 
Thus, the law as presently written al-
lows the administration to make a sig-
nificant commitment to a foreign coun-
try witho 
or the public in the debate. 
Under this authority, the administra-
tion shifted nearly $100 million to the 
Cambodia Government during 1970. The 
largest portion of this transfer was made 
before the 1910 elections, but Congress 
was not notified until the end of No-
vember. 
I firmly believe that such a large com-
mitment of U.S. Government funds to 
Cambodia should have been widely dis-
cussed in advance, for it involved a sig-
nificant step toward our becoming en-
tangled in that country. 
Then in December 19'10, the adminis-
tration came to Congress for a large sup-
plemental foreign aid appropriation, and 
we were asked to vote money for those 
other aid programs from which money 
had been borrowed in order to send the 
nearly $100 million to Cambodia. 
Frankly, I was disturbed by the whole 
process, and, that is why in December 
I introduced with Senator SYMINGTON an 
amendment requiring the President to 
give the Congress advance notice of aid 
increases in Cambodia. Happily, the 
Case-Symington amendment was ac-
cepted by the Congress and then signed 
into law by the President. 
But in the case of Cambodia, almost 
all the horses had escaped by the time we 
got around to closing the barn door. 
So in the future, I am proposing that 
the President give the Congress 30 days 
advance?or 10 days in case of an emer-
gency?before he shifts scheduled levels 
of foreign military or economic assistance 
funds to any country. 
If decisions are to be made that affect 
our country's foreign policy, let them be 
made with full congressional and public 
knowledge prior to the event?not 30 
days after the fact. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of my bill be printed 
in the RECORD. ? 
There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the REcORD, as 
follows: 
S. 2251 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That section 
652 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
added by section 8 of the Special Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1971, is amended to read as 
follows: 
"Sec. 652. Limitation Upon Exercise.. of 
Special Authorities.?The President shall not 
exercise any special authority granted to him 
under section 506(a), 610(a), or 614(5) of 
this Act unless the President, at least thirty 
_ days (or 10 days if he certifies, in addition, 
that the national interest requires it) prior 
to the date he intends to exercise any such 
authority, notifies the Speaker of the House 
of _ Representatives and the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate in writing 
of each such intended exercise, the section of 
this Act under which such authority is to 
be exercised, and the justification for, and the 
extent of, the exercise of such authority.". 
Sec. 2. The last sentence of section 506(a) 
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is 
repealed.

The commission's criticism of the 235 pro-
gram was a followup salvo to a barrage aimed 
at the program last year and earlier this year 
by the House Banking and Currency Com-
mittee. The committee charged that the poor

clean up the 235 program, and at one time

homes with FHA mortgage subsidies until

Later, Romney announced a series of new 
rules were being put into effect to safe-
guard the poor against real estate specu-
lators trying to get rid of deteriorated houses 
at prices- higher than they were worth. 
Under the 235 program, the FHA not only 
Insures long-term mortgages for poor fami-

LAOS: SECRET SHAME 
Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, any-
one who believes in the Christian Ethie 
can only read with sadness. and shame an 
article entitled "Laos" written by II. D. S. 
Greenway, and published in the July 
Atlantic Monthly. 
I would hope that every Senator 
would read the article. I ask unanimous 
? consent that it be printed in the PvEconD. 
? There being no objection, the article 
was 'ordered to be printed in the IlEcOaD, 
' 
as follows: 
of them are children. One night, the Patlict 
Lao and the North Vietnamese had come to 
his village. The soldiers in a nearby govern-
ment outpost had detected no enemies 'in 
the area: "So we went to be happy," the 
village chief said. 
"But at four o'clock in the morning we 
were attacked. Before we knew it, they were 
in the village shooting and the houses were 
burning." Squatting down on his haunches, 
the village chief described with his hands 
in the dirt how the enemy had come and the 
attack on the outpost?the short, sharp 
explosions, the flames, the rifle fire, the 
measured hammering of the fifty-calibers, 
and then silence. Death had come in the ? 
classic Indochina way: a small, isolated out-
post overrun in the night. It was a scene that 
has been played a -thousand times in the last 
twenty-five years of war. 
The villagers escaped into the surround-
ing woods, and for two days they marched 
over seine of the most impenetrable and in-
hospitable country on earth. "We were so 
sorry to leave everything behind," the chief 
said, "and the march was very difficult. We 
walked two days, and the people cried and 
cried over the mountains. Two people died; 
one was an old person and the other was a 
child." There was talk that the men might be 
conscripted into Vang Pao's army, but the 
chief did not know for sure, and he dld not 
know what would happen to his people. "I 
am afraid," he said. 
"FOS WHAT 7" 
At site 272 the Air America planes con-
tinue taking off and landing in a roar of 
red dust, bringing rice, pigs, end ducks to 
the refugees. But one senses the end of a 
decade of American policy in Laos. Ten 
years ago, when the Americans first began 
to train and equip the Meo tribesmen, yang 
Pao's guerrillas operated all over Northeast-
ern Laos?far behind enemy lines to the 
borders of North Vietnam itself. Fewer than 
two dozen American servicemen have been 
killed in these mountains. Asians fight Asians. 
But ten years Of costly, vainglorious offen-
sives and unremitting pressure from North 
Vietnamese counteroffensives have pushed 
the Mee) beyond their endurance. yang Pao's 
lasses in the last three years have been. so 
heavy that the Armee Clandestine is no 
longer an exclusively Meo force. Almost half 
their numbers are now made up of other 
highland peoples. And in the last three or 
four years, the Meo have been organized to 
fight in battalion-sized units of over five 
hundred men instead of small guerrilla units. 
As a result, the slaughter has been mag-
nified. yang Pao's army can no longer hold 
Long Chong alone, and by early April it 
was reliably reported by Lao and American 
sources that no fewer than five thousand 
Thai troops had been flown in to bolster 
the Long Cheng front. (The Thai govern-
ment still denies the presence of Thai troops 
in Laos, but their presence is common knowl-
edge in Vietiane.) 
For ten years the Meo people have been 
running and dying, and today there are few 
mountain ranges left into which to escape. 
American officials estimate that fully 15 per-
cent of the 250,000 to 300,000 people in the 
military region that makes up Northeast 
Laos have died within the last three years. 
LAOS 
(By H. D. S. Greenway) 
The spingtime in Laos is very dry. Save 
for the brief Mango rains, the heat is un-
relieved, and shriveled green leaves lie like 
dead frogs in the dusty roads. The sun is 
dull red in the smoke and haze, for in the 
springtime the hill people slash and burn 
the brush off the hillsides. The pilots say 
that the haze stretches all across the north-
ern marches of Southeast Asia from North 
Vietnam across to Burma. The Air America 
helicopters must pick their way carefully 
among the fantastic limestone outcroppings 
that rise like castles from the wooded hills 
tumbling out of China. One realizes that the 
misty mountains of the classical Chinese 
landscape paintings were not the product of 
artistic imaginations, but faithful reproduc-
tions of nature. 
Here in these hills, fifty miles northeast 
of Vientiane, there is an airstrip known to 
the pilots as site 272. It is the center for 
? American refugee relief in Northern Laos 
and the fall-back point for Long Chong, 
the secret CIA base twenty-five miles to the 
? north. Long Cheng is the headquarters for 
the Meo General yang Pao's "Armee Clande-
- stine," supported by the CIA. All this past 
winter and spring the base has been under 
siege by the North Vietnamese. The hill 
peoples, the highland Lao and the Meo de-
pendents of Vang Pao's .army, have been 
fleeing south by the thousands, pouring into 
the hills and :valleys near site 272. They 
make temporary bamboo shelters, and Air 
? America drops rice to them, for they have 
? no food. There is the despair of uncertainty. 
? No one can tell them what their future will 
be, Like Laos itself, they have long since 
lost control of their own destiny. 
In one such makeshift settlement the 
? Village chief greets visitors with a -gold-
toothed smile. There are over nine hundred 
people in his immediate area?four hundred 
has ,become a Lawre ce f airalna figure to 
the Moo, is hithself a casualty. Recovering 
now from a serious heart attack, burdened 
by overwork and worry during the last few 
years of disasters, Buell said: "All of this 
is difficult for its who have worked with 
these ? people since the beginning. Some of 
my boys are beginning to wonder, what was 
it all for?" 
? Some Americans are beginning to wonder 
why, if there is to be an accommodation 
now, we didn't encourage one ten years ago. 
Perhaps the arming and supplying of guer-
rillas so close to the North Vietnamese bor-
der provoked greater North Vietnamese re-
taliation in an area that has nothing to do 
with the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the war 
In Vietnam. Although it is true that the Meo 
had asked for arms in the first place, some 
Americans argue that they were urged to 
fight on for U.S. interests beyond their ca-
pacity and beyond anything that could be 
considered in their owls interest. 
"You know, over two thirds of the 170,000 
people we are supporting in the Northeast 
are refugees," said one American with many 
years' experience. "Few have been perma-
nently located, and they are milling about 
in limbo. Anthropologists call the Mee) a 
seminomadic people, but before the war they 
would move only when they ran out of land. 
Normally, they might move only ten kilom-
eters or so, and they might take a year to 
make the move. Put to be uprooted as they 
are now is a great trauma for them. 
"In these large refugee moves over the 
last four or five years we have found that 
about 10 or 15 percent die during the move 
or just afterwards," the American said. One 
always knew that the long marches were kill- - 
era. When whole populations were on the 
move, walking for days on end through the 
mountains, one knew that the old, the weak, 
and the very young died. But, said the Amer-
ican, experience showed that about the same 
number of people died anyway even if they 
had been carried out by plane or helicopter. 
"We have American doctors waiting for them 
with mosquito nets, malaria pills, penicillin, 
the works. But they die anyway. It is the 
move itself?the adjusting to a new area, 
different food and water. Of course, part of 
the problem is that, like all Southeast 
Asians, a lot of these people are sick and 
weak to begin with. But a lot of it is psycho-
somatic--bad phi [spirits]. Just the ;trauma 
of moving kills them. They think they are go-
ing to-die, and they do." 
Edgar Buell expressed the phenomenon a 
little differently. "Just moving causes a kind 
of sickness," he said. "I wouldn't go so far 
as to say they die of a broken heart or any-
think like that, but, yes?you can just about 
say that for a lot-of people, moving means 
dying." 
"TJI. LW THE SKY" . 
The official Laotian and American 7an-
bassy position .is that the Long Cheng air-
strip must be held at all coats, but there is a 
general realization that the game is almost 
played out as far as the Meo are concerned. 
Officials speak of an eventual accommoda-
tion with the Communists, and say that the 
Armee Clandestine is all but finished 'as 
an eflective fighting force. 
Many of the Americans who have worked 
with the Moo have become -profoundly dis-
illusioned. The senior USAID official in the 
Northeast, Edgar Buell, the former Indiana 
farmer known as "Pop," who in -ten years 
In the summer of 1969, in what- may prove 
to have been yang Pao's last successful of-
fensive, the Armee Clandestine, with Ameri-
can logistical and air support, captured the 
Plain of Jars from the overextended North 
Vietnamese. But some people thought that 
the brilliantly executed offensive was a fool-
ish escalation of the conflict. By February 
of 1970, Vang Pao had been pushed back off 
the plain, with heavy losses. 
The raid produced one of the biggest refu-
gee movements Of the Laotian war. Fifteen 
thousand inhabitants from the Plain of Jars 
were resttled in camps near Vientiane. The 
last airplaneload left on the tenth of Febru-
ary, 1970. A silver C-130 with the American 
markings painted over landed in a rooster 
tall of dust on a: makeshift strip on the 
western edge of the Plain of Jars. The last 
terrified refugees- -it was their firsts plane 
ride--.were herded aboard against the hurri-
can blast of the prop wash; nothing was left 
behind except their dogs, forming in packs 
and snarling, among the refuse of their en-
s 
carnprnent.

_ DO VES 
(Mr. DENNIS asked and was given

marks, and include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. DENNIS. Mr. Speaker, we may be 
hopeful that the allegedly new pro-
posals by the Vietcong actually contain 
something new, but we must remember: 
.? First, that this is a demand for the 
? setting of a withdrawal date, "without 
posing any condition"?a thing this 
House has rejected and which a current 
poll of my own district, rejects by ap-
proximately 80 percent; and 
Second, that these proposals include 
Provision for some sort of coalition ,gov-
eniment, pending elections?a thing al-
ways basically unacceptable to the United 
States. 
The allegedly new Vietcong proposals 
seem to be directed at American doves?
particularly in the other body--at least 
as much as they may indicate any intent 
of serious negotiation. 
I commend to the attention of my col-
leagues a recent column by William S. 
White, which points up this situation, 
and which I insert in the 1ZEcorut at this 
point: 
NEW PEACE OFFER IS FOR SENATE DOVES 
(By William S. White) 
WAsmxcroisr.?The North Vietnamese have 
made another offer of peace in the Viet 
Nam war that Is ostensibly directed to the 
United States government, but is in reality 
addressed to the doves in the Senate. 
The Nixon administration does not dare to 
brand this fresh Communist thrust for what 
it is?a Communist demand for an uncondi-
tional surrender and a total abandonment 
of the commitment of five American Presi-
dents to South Viet Nam. 
IIERE ARE TWO REASONS 
There are two reasons for this state of 
affairs. 
One is that the administration is bruised 
from all too many encounters with its peace 
critics here at home and knows that to spurn 
this new Communist rubbish outright would 
be to open itself to their old litany that 
Washington is simply inflexible. 
The other is that the President and his as-
sociates?not to mention John F. Kennedy, 
Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman and Dwight 
Eisenhower as his predecessors?are under 
siege by the Pentagon Papers pilfered by 
Daniel Ellsberg to the point where all of 
them have been or will be mada to appear 
either foolish or against peace. 
Moreover, there may be even a third reason 
why the State Department Is acting as tho 
there really might be some ounce of conces-
sion in these latest Communist proposals. 
This government has been conducting some 
highly sensitive contacts with certain third 
party, and far from pro-American, nations?
meanwhile hoping that the identities of 
these parties are not going to conic out, thus 
requiring them to run for cover?and is con-
cerned to walk in the softest way possible on 
every aspect of this whole business. 
The Senate doves, meanwhile, are of course 
delighted with North Viet Name suggestions. 
For, like the doves, North Viet Nam is de-
manding that the United States fix a precise 
date for the withdrawal of all American 
forces from South Viet Nam. Given this and 
an American abandonment of the anti-Com-
munist government in Saigon, Hanoi would, 
so It says, open its cages and release the 
American prisoners of war. 
Precisely this.form of approach?let Wash-
ington promise a one-sided troop withdrawal 
and then Hanoi surely would release our 
men?already has been tried in the Senate

? THE WAR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
The SPEAKER. Under a previous 
? order of the House the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McCLosicsy) is recog-
nized for I hour. 
Mr. McCLOSKEY asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
. Mr. MeCLOSKEY. Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago I had the opportunity to read 
a copy of a speech made on June 26, in 
the city of Burlingame in my district, by 
my colleague from California, the gen-
tleman from Santa Clara County, Mr. 
GUBSER. The gentleman was kind enough 
to title his speech, "Neo-McCarthyism 
and the New Left," thereafter arguing 
that the McCarthyism of the early 1950's 
had become "McCloskeyism," and con-
cluding: "Neo-McCarthyism, now Mc-
Closkeyism, has served the cause of the 
New Left." The thrust of the gentleman's 
remarks was specific: in speeches about 
Southeast Asia I had been guilty of libel-
ing the image of the United States with 
"half truths and distortion," in particu-
lar with respect to the allegation that 
the United States has been guilty of 
first, "indiscriminate bombing of civil-
ians in Laos," and second, "war crimes 
like those for which the Nuremberg trials 
decreed the penalty of death." 
Both my allegations and my col-
league's comments constitute serious 
charges, and I have taken this special 
order today, inviting the gentleman from 
Santa Clara County to share in a dis-
cussion of the issues involved so that the 
record of debate may be as complete as 
possible on a matter of grave national 
concern?U.S, policies and actions in the 
destruction of rural villages in Laos and 
Vietnam. 
I think it regrettable when legislators, 
each sincere in their beliefs, extend their' 
disagreement to attacks on the personal 
integrity of those with whom they. dis-
agree. The issues on which reasonable 
minds differ today are too important to - 
the Nation to be clouded by attacks on 
the motives and veracity of those who 
espouse opposing views-. We confuse the 
merits of the issues when we lapse into 
personal attacks on one another. 
I believe this is why we have long had 
-rule XIV in the House, requiring that a 
Member, in speaking to the House: 
"Shall confine himself to the question 
under debate, avoiding, personality." 
In earlier days, accusations of un-
truthfulness resulted in canings, fisti-
cuffs, and duels. These hardly add to the 
legislative process, but sharp debate quite 
often can. In precise cross-examination 
and heated debate, I believe our demo-
cratic processes achieve the highest 
chance of ascertaining truth, the most 
elusive goal of all our deliberations. Un-
til his recent personal attacks, I had con-
sidered my colleague a friend; I hope we 
can resume that friendship. He is an able 
Member of Congress despite our disagree-
ment. I feel the Nation is particularly in-
debted to him for his leadership last year

\---7 ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
LAOS?FURTHER U.S. MILITARY OP-
ERATIONS IN THIS SECRET WAR 
? Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, sev-
eral recent news articles report a new, 
? hitherto secret, military operation being 
- conducted in Laos by irregular units un-
der the command of Gen. yang Pao, 
commander of Military Region No. 2. 
The first of these was a .story by Tammy 
Arbuckle, published in the Washington 
Star of July 7, and reprinted in the New 
York Times Of July 8; also an article by 
D.E. Ronk, published in the Washington 
Post of July 8. As these reporters make 
t clear, considerable American support has 
been involved. 
An article, by Marilyn Berger, pub-
lished-in the Washington Post of July 9, 
reports the statements of 'U.S. and Lao 
Officials on the operation, statements in-
dicating a certain amount of confusion 
as to the respective responsibilities of the 
Lao and U.S. Governments for the new 
offensive. 
Apparently this operation by Lao and 
. Thai irregulars, whose costs are paid by 
? U.S. funds appropriated by Congress, has 
been under way since late June; but we 
In the Congress, who have appropriated 
the funds; have had to learn about it in 
the press. In fact, had there been no 
press reports, we might never have 
learned about it. Indeed, as Mr. Arbuckle 
reported in another article, published in 
the Washington Star, American officials 
In Laos did not acknowledge the true 
scope of the operation until July 9. Mr. 
? Arbuckle notes in his article of July 7: 
?It Is ahnost unbelievable that after Sen-
ate censure and publication Of the Pentagon 
documents, a U.S. mission in Laos should 
? once again resort to secrecy, particularly 
concerning a United States-run operation 
Close to North Vietnam and China. 
Surely we will all agree with that 
' statement. 
_ - 
The press stories report that these 
irregular units are being led by Ameri-
can military men in the employ of the 
Central Intelligence Agency and that top 
Lao military officers insist that the op-
eration is being coordinated by the 
CIA. A State Department spokesman 
has said that American are not actually 
leading any of the forces in this opera-
tion. But he has admitted that we are 
providing logistic and air support and 
I am sure he would not deny that these 
Irregular units are directed by U.S. Gov-
ernment officials. 
Both Mr. Arbuckle and Mr. Ronk re-
port that American Embassy officials in 
Vientia.nne put the responsibility for the 
operation on Gen. yang Pao, saying that 
he "is very much his own man." Mr. 
Ronk adds that American sources say: 
No matter what anyone says, he does 
pretty much what he wants. 
Knowing what I do know now about 
our activities in Laos, this statement is 
ridiculous on its face. We recruit and 
train these irregular forces. We provide 
'them with all their equipment and am-
munition. We transport them to battle 
in American planes, as the press stories 
make clear. It is further reported that 
American engineers were involved in 
clearing mines from landing strips on the 
Plain and that U.S. Air Force crane heli-
copters were used to move heavy equip-
ment into forward areas. 
Furthermore, it is inconceivable that 
offensive actions of the magnitude de-
scribed could have been undertaken 
without directtair support by U.S. fighter 
bombers based in Thailand. It is, there-
fore disingenuous if not actually deceitful 
to shift the blame on Gen. yang Pao so 
as to absolve ourselves of any responsi-
bility for this military engagement. 
Actually, if we were able to accept as 
accurate the state ment that Gen. yang 
Pao "does pretty much what he wants," 
we should be even, more disturbed; 
because if this statement were true, it 
would mean that, despite the enormous 
U.S. involvement and participation in 
this Laotian war, we cannot control ac-
tions on the part of local Lao military 
commanders which risk causing a new 
escalation of the lighting, the costs of 
which fighting is borne by the United 
States. 
One might well ask also about what 
additional risk arises from the involve-
ment of Thai troops in an operation of 
this type and character. Given the fact 
that the United States is committed by 
treaty to the defense of Thailand, should 
not the Congress seek assurance that 
the use of U.S.-financed Thai troops 
In Laos will not provoke a North 
Vietnamese response that would result 
In that Thailand commitment being in-
voked? 
The risks inherent in this new offen-
sive, particularly the possibility that it 
may undercut the tentative progress 
which has been made toward talks, be-
tween.Priine Minister Souvanna and the 
Pathet Lao looking toward a reestablish-
ment of the 1962 Accords, raise once 
more the question: Just what are the 
objectives of U.S. policy in Laos? 
Do we intend to continue to prosecute 
the war in northern Laos as an adjunct, 
to the war in Vietnam, or do we support 
with sincerity efforts toward a Laotian 
political settlement? 
One explanation could be that there 
,iis disagreement within the executive 
branch on our objectives in Laos. Would 
it not be interesting to know, for exam-
ple, whether the principal farce behind 
this new offensive was the Department 
of State, or the influence of military 
planners who view Indochina as one vast 
American theater of operations. 
We of Congress have a right to ques-
tion the wisdom of this latest Laotian 
operation, and to deplore the secrecy 
which surrounds it. We also have the 
right to resent the high-handedness of 
the executive branch in not consulting 
Congress before undertaking a major 
military operation with funds Congress 
appropriated; an operation which may 
seriously affect not only our interests 
in Laos, but also in all of Indochina as 
well as in Thailand. 
I would earnestly hope that the Sen-
ate would bear this case in mind when 
considering the amendment I have pro-
posed to the Defense authorization bill 
that would limit the funds which can be 
obligated or expended in Laos, exclusive 
of air operations over the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail area in southern Laos, to $200 
million. 
It is only through some control of the 
funds it appropriates that the Congress 
can have any real knowledge of, or ex-
ercise any restraint on, this dangerous 
situation, 
Also, I invite the attention of Sen-
ators to a brief news item, following 
the summary of the Washington Star 
report from Laos, in the July 8 issue of 
the New York Times entitled "Cam-
bodian Plan Said To End." This report 
quotes "United States sources" as saying 
that the United States has abandoned 
its secret program of training regular 
Cambodian troops in Laos, but is con-
tinuing to train Cambodian guerrillas. 
This is a program which has hereto-
fore been kept classified by the execu-
tive branch. Let us hope that its con-
firmation by U.S. seurces will end that 
ban, and that knowledge of that portion 
of the report on Laos by two members of 
the staff of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee which related to this subject will 
no longer be withheld from the American 
people. 
While on the subject Of declassification, 
the subcommittee staff was told by the 
State Department this morning, specifi-
cally by Mr. Joseph Wolf, that the mem-
orandum to the Secretary of State on 
the declassification of certain portions of 
the June 7 closed session of the Senate on 
Laos has not yet been acted on but is 
still being considered. I remind Senators 
that, as I have reported to them on both 
June 30 and July '7, by Friday, June 25, 
the specific points had been defined on 
which there was disagreement between 
representatives of the Foreign Relations 
Committee and representatives of the 
executive branch on the need for. con- - 
tinned security classification. Over 2

ongress Tui 
Congress, in its continuing Vietnam-inspired 
effort to break the Executive's near moreepoly ot 
Vlentral Intelligence Agency. This is understand-
owers in foreign affairs, is now tackling the 
able, and was to be expected, too. The agency's 
powers are great?or so one suspects; no one 
representing the public is really in a position to 
know. Yet because it operates under virtually 
absolute secrecy, it does not receive even that 
Incomplete measure of public scrutiny which the 
Defense and State Departments undergo. 
The proposals in Congress affecting the CIA 
fall into two categories. Those in the first category 
start from the premise that the CIA is essentially 
an operations agency and an ominous one, which 
Is beyond public control and which must somehow 
be restrained?for the good of American foreign 
policy and for the health of the American demo-
cratic system alike. 
v/ So Senator Case has introduced legislation to 
prevent CIA from financing a second country's 
military operations in a third country (e.g., Thais 
In .Laos) and to impose on the agency the same 
Limitations on disposing of "surplus" military 
materiel as are already imposed on Defense. The 
thrust of these provisions is to stop the Executive 
from doing secretly what the Congress has for-
bidden it to do openly. Unquestionably they would 
restrict Executive flexibility, since the government 
would have to justify before a body not beholden 
to it the particular actions it wishes to take. The 
'advantage to the Executive would be that the 
Congress would then have to share responsibility 
for the actions undertaken. Since these actions 
Involve making war and ensuring the security of 
Americans, if not preserving their very lives, we 
cannot see how a serious legislature can evade 
attempts to bring them under proper control. 
Senator McGovern's proposal that all CIA ex-
penditures and appropriations should appear in 
the budget as a single line item is another matter. 
ile -argues that taxpayers could then decide 
whether they wanted to spend more or less on? 
Intelligence than, say, education. We wonder, 
though, whether a serious judgment on national 
priorities, or on CIA's value and its needs, can be 
based on knowing just its budget total. In that 
figure, critics might have- a blunt instrument for 
polemics but citizens Would not have the fine 
Instrument required for analysis. 
In the House, ? Congressman Badillo recently 
offered an amendment to confine the CIA to 
gathering and analyzing intelligence. This is the 
traditional rallying cry, of those who feel, either 
that the United States has no business running 
secret operations or that operational duties warp 
intelligence production. The amendment, unen-
forceable anyway under existing conditions, lost 
172 to 46, but floor debate on it did bring out a 
principal reason why concerned legislators despair 
of the status quo: Earlier this year Hoyse Armed ..v7 
Services chairman Hebert simply abolished the 
10-man CIA oversight subcommittee and arrogated 
complete responsibility to himself. Congressman 
Badillo -is now seeking a way to reconstitute the 
subcommittee. This is a useful sequence to keep 
in mind when the agency's defenders claim, as 
they regularly do, that CIA already is adequately 
overseen by the Congress. 
Between these proposals and Senator Cooper's, 
however, lies a critical difference. Far from re-
garding CIA as an ominous operational agency 
whose work must be checked, he regards it as an 
essential and expert intelligence agency whose 
"conclusions, facts and analyses" ought to -be dis-
tributed "fully and currently" to the germane 
committees of Congress as well as to the Executive 
Branch. He would amend the National Security 
Act to that end. His proposal is, in our view, the 
most interesting and far-reaching of the lot. 
To Mr. Cooper, knowledge is not only power but 
responsibility. A former ambassador, he accepts?
perhaps a bit too readily?that a large part of 
national security policy is formulated on the basis 
of information classified as secret. If the Congress 
is to fulfill its responsibilities in the conduct of 
foreign affairs, he says, then it must have available 
the same information on which the Executive acts 
?and not as a matter of discretion or chance but 
of right. Otherwise Congress will find itself again 
and again put off by an Executive saying, as was 
said, for instance, in the ABM fight, "if you only 
knew what we knew ..." Otherwise Congress will 
forever be running to catch up with Executive 
trains that have already left the station. 
The Cooper proposal obviously raises sharp 
questions of Executive privilege and of Executive ? 
prerogative in foreign policymaking ? to leave 
aside the issue of keeping classified information 
secure. But they are questions which a responsible 
Congress cannot ignore. We trust the Cooper 
proposal willbecome a vehicle for debating them 
in depth?and in public, too.

New U.S. offensive in Laos 
VIENTIANE ? The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has launched ? 
a new offensive against Lao patriotic forces in northern Laos and is im-
posing a "news blackout" on the whole operation, the Washington Eve-
ning Star and Washington Post reported on Thursday and Friday. The 
U.S. newspapers' reports on the massive new attacks were confirmed in 
radio broadcasts from Sam Neua, headquarters of the Lao Patriotic 
Front. 
The CIA's offensive began about a week ago and is focused on the 
strategic Plain of Jars area in northern Laos. The Washington Post re-
ported that large forces of Meo tribesmen ? part of the "Secret Army" 
led by Gen. yang Pao ? are taking part in the operation. Command is 
vested in four of Vang Pao's junior officers since he is still recovering 
from wounds and injuries suffered last year. However, actual direction 
of the military operations is in the hands of CIA advisers. 
It is known also that about 3,500 regular Thai Army troops are tak-
ing part in the offensive. The U.S. has admitted it has escalated its air 
war on Laos in the last few days:

"What we are doing in Laos is total-
ly inconsistent with our kind of socie-
ty." This is What a U.S. diplomat in Vi-
entiane, Laos, recently told a cone-
'spondent. 
The official, who did not want to be 
quoted by name, added: "We are 
fighting a war by covert means and 
an open society cannot tolerate that." 
If this is correct, the administration 
has much to answer for to the Ameri-
can public. The disclosures made so 
far raise more questions than they an-
swer. 
For example: Officially the public 
has been told that the United States is 
contributing $52 million a year to the 
Laotians in (,.olionlie aell Unofficially, 
it has been relaienhat $100 million 
has been approved for military assist-
ance. 
Tuesday, following a rare closed ses-
sion of the United States Senate to dis-
cuss our activity in Laos, different 
senators put total expenditures at 
$200 million, $250 million, and one 
wont as high as $350 million. 
Sen. Stuart Symington, D-Mo., a for-
STATINTL 
mer secretary of the air force, said he 
told his Senate colleagues that "what 
was actually going on in Laos was 
quite different in some details than we 
have been told." 
One reported activity in Laos is the 
financing of 4800 Thailand troops in 
Laos by the U.S.. Central Intelligence' 
A.gency. Another iT'riiitincial support 
for Royal Laotian troops and irregu-
lars. 
The Republican leader in the Senate, 
Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, claimed 
that nothing new had been. disclosed 
.in the secret session of the Senate; 
that the Thai troops are not mercenar-
ies; and ? the activity is justified be-
cause, "If Laos were to fall it would 
greatly decrease the already slim 
chances of successful negotiations 
with the Communists who would then 
have completely outflanked the rest of 
Indochina." 
He could be right on all counts, but 
whY should the facts be kept from the 
American people? The Communists 
are certainly aware of much of what 
we are doing in Laos. The American 
public should know at least as much. 
The secrecy on the part of the ad-
ministration raises the fear that the 
United States may be enlarging opera-
tions in Laos when a majority of 
Americans favor a withdrawal from 
Indochina; that in winding down the 
war in Vietnam, the administration is 
at the same time increasing our in-
volvement in other Indochina nations 
which would be contrary to laws 
passed by Congress. Specifically a law 
forbidding the use of U.S. funds' to 
support foreign forces fighting for the 
governments of Cambodia and Laos. 
Sen. Symington has urged the ad-
ministration to approve release of the 
transcript of the secret session as well 
as a report on financing of Thai troops 
in Laos. If our society is open and, as 
administration supporter Scott said, 
nothing new was disclose d, there

If the Uniktd States, isn't careful; it can let itself get 
dragged into Laos th:? same v,'ay it got dragged into Vietnam. 
So it's undcn;larlable that the Senate wants to set a ceil-
ing $200 million bas been proposod? on. U.S, spending in 
Laos. 
And it's hard to ;.r.vallow the Pentagon's story that such a' 
ceiling won't work bncause nobody knows exactly how Trnich. 
American Money is hThig spent there. 
Granted that precise figures are hard to come by toca.use 
much of the money going into Laos is being funneled through 
the Central Intelligence Agency -- and C1,s,.4:44iniding is prop-. 
erly kept ;secret as a security matter. But the CIA ought to 
know how much of its funds is going into Laos, 'and lumping 
that amount in with overall spending in Laos could- be no 
breach of security. . 
Granted that keeping track of U.S.- spending in Laos. 
Could involve complicated accounjng procedures that may '? 
not be inexpcnsive. Bat the Pentagon ought toknow for its 
own purposes how much the support of Laos is costing in 
,American dollars as well as possibly in American lives. 
Granted, too, that as more U.S. troops are brought home 
from Southeast Asia, more U.S. funds will have to be sent , 
there to help replace thern. But this can't be an open-ended ar-
rangement, since America's treasure is not inexhaustible. 
There's room for quarreling with the specific level of the 
proposed ceiling, t.lready the U.S. is said to be spencliig some - 
.$1.74 million a year more than the proposed limit of S200 mil- ? 
lion. 
. But tho Pentagon can't be handed a. blank check on Laos. 
If the Defense Department really doesn't know hew much it is 
,spending in LI-Jos or any other individual country in Southeast 
Asia, that's- sufficient reason for setting a ceiling t6 find oute

yesterday read into the record 
a Pentagon statement in oppo-
sition to his amendment to 
limit spending in .Laos. That 
statement said such a limit 
"would substantially impair 
our on-going operation in 
Laos, operations which have 
0 
yenaroe ? 
been undertaken at the re-
quest of the government of 
Laos to assist it in resisting 
military takcOver by North 
Vietnam." 
While Symington sought in 
his amendment to put a ceil-
ing of $200 million on obliga-
tions or expenditures for mili-
tary and economic aid, Secre-
tary of State William P. Rog-
ers has said that the United 
,, 
States is spending 'in the 
e neighborhood of $330 million, ' 
exclusive of the :cost of U.S. 
bombing operations, in Laos. 
The. . pentagon statement 
said the Symington amend-
.ment "would intrude into mat-
ters properly-- Within the con-
stitutional authority of the 
?President; as commander-in-

the Congress has .under the 
ConstitUtion to -raise and sup-

Branch- ? which, . according to 
the statement, maintains rec-
ords for military assistance

Symington called this a "dis-

the. Ekecutive Branch be cer-
tain
that-expenditures do not 
exceed ? obligations in each 
country?" Symington asked. 
? _Instead of being argu-

"THE WILD BLUE YONDER 
OVER LAOS" 
HON. MICHAEL J. HARRINGTON 
? OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July S. 1971 
Mr. HARRINGTON. Mr. -Speaker I 
have just read an article detailing some 
of the activities of the American Gov-
ernment in and over Laos. This latest 
piece of writing comes from Fred Branf-
man and appears in the July 1971, issue 
of Washington monthly magazine. Mr. 
I3ranfman was in Laos from March of 
1967 to February 1971, first with Inter-
' national Voluntary Services, and then 
RS a writer, researching the bombing of 
Laos on his own. He interviewed thou-
sands of refugees who lived under the 
bombs, plus many American officials and 
pilots. My interest in reading about the 
effects of our bombing on the people and 
land of Laos is tempered with a deep sad-
ness. I am saddened by the fact that I 
aril forced to read in the press of this 
Nation information my Government 
claims is too sensitive for the American 
public to be exposed to. Just as it is a 
tragedy for this esteemed body to be 
forced to rely on the newspapers of the 
tTnted States to break the truth to us 
about our present and past activities in 
Vietnam, so it is equally troubling that 
Members of Congress are forced to rely 
on brave and tenacious members of the 
press, such as Mr. Branfman, for our in-
formation on what our country is ac-
tually up to in Laos. 
As long as the House of Representa-
,tives votes, as it did on Wednesday, 
against being fully informed by the prop-. 
er official sources as to what our actual 
activities over Laos are, we will hz-ir1e to 
continue to depend on persons such as 
Mr. Branfman for the truth about our 
Nation's continuing war upon that al-
4060400640611166 
ready shattered little conntry of Laos. I 
ask unanimous consent that Mr. Branf-
ma.n's article be printed in the RECORD. 
'The Washington Monthly, July 2, 1971] 
THE WILD BLUE YONDER OVER Laos 
(By Fred Branfman) 
War is no longer the despeiate annihilat-
ing struggle that it was.. . . It is a warfare of 
limited aims. This is not to say that . . . the 
conduct of war . . . has become less blood-
thirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary. 
. 
But in a physical sense war involves very 
small numbers of people, mostly highly 
trained specialists. The fighting . . takes 
place on the vague frontiers whose where-
abouts the average man can only guess at ... 
George Orwell, 1984 
Conventional land warfare, George Orwell 
predicted, would inevitably give way to auto-
mated war as military technology developed. 
The war in Indochina today appears to be 
undergoing such a transformation. 
Perhaps unaware of this, AmeriCans who 
watch the war have not yet learned to look 
up in the air. While most people believe that 
bringing the troops home is synonymous with 
getting out of Vietnam, ground troops are 
becoming irrelevant to the war effort. The 
real war has taken off. The skies are being 
filled with American planes as the land is 
emptied of its foot soldiers. 
The Nixon Administration has accom-
plished massive aerial escalation, perhaps 
more devastating than President Johnson's 
troop buildups of 1965, with minimum public 
notice or concern because the country still 
thinks it is fighting with the Green Machine?
the ground army?of the 1060s. But the 
war of the 1970s is that of the Blue Ma-
chine?U.S. air power?several thousand feet 
above the grunts, climbing away from any 
American agony. With the inexorable de-
velopment of American air technology, Indo-
china is already becoming Orwell's battlefield. 
Since Nixon took office, and as ground 
troops have been withdrawn, more than 2.7 
million tons of bombs, by Pentagon estimate, 
have been dropped on Indochina. This is 
more American ordnance than was absorbed 
by both the European ancl Pacific theaters 
during World War II, plus the Korean war. 
We are dropping six million pounds of bombs 
a day, 4,000 pounds every minute. 
The people underwent another war: the 
air war. They learned another form of civil-
ization: the holes. We dug day and night, the 
planes bombed day and. night. Our village 
was filled- with bomb craters, the land made 
barren. I grieved very much to see my village 
in ruins, my animals vanished, my crops 
destroyed. . . . Each day, news came about 
such and such a village being bombed, more 
and more deaths and wounded . . .---from 
essay by teenage refugee, Laos 
The bombing of Laos has doubled, erasing 
whatever restrictions on striking civilian 
targets that formerly existed, Hundreds, per-
haps thousands, of villages have been de-
stroyed. Tens of thousands of peasants have 
been killed and wounded, hundreds of thou-
sands have been driven underground. The 
Plain of Jars, formerly a thriving society 
of some 50,000 people, has been leveled and 
emptied of its inhabitants. 
The Laos pattern has been repeated in 
Cambodia. Numerous towns and villages 
:lave already been decimated. As The Wash-
ington Post reported on January 21, 1971, 
"the United States is now waging a full-dress 
air war across Cambodia [that] now rivals 
In scope, although not in intensity, the air 
war in Laos." 
The bombing of North Vietnam has also 
resumed. By June 1, air raids had 6ccurre.d 
on 43 days since the first of the year, an 
average of twice a week. As Randy Floyd, a 
Marine pilot who bombed North Vietnam 37 
times, puts it, "Anywhere in North Vietnam 
is basic-ally a free drop zone . . . if you 
U-
y 8, 1971 
'didn't find any particu ar targets you wantedI 
to hit, the ri normally you'd just drop your STATINTL 
bombs wherever you. wanted to." One may 
or may not accept Hanoi Radio claims that 
civilian targets are constantly struck. But all 
infoemed American sources say that "pro-
tective reaction" strikes are going far be-
yond enemy missile sites. 
During these escalations, there has been 
a significant decrease or U.S. air activity 
within South Vietnam, both because of the 
slowdown in ground activity there and be-
cause some 500 aircraft have been trans-
ferred to the Vietnamese Air Force. Monthly 
American air sorties have been about 70 per 
cent lower this year in South Vietnam than 
they were in 1968. 
It is assumed, however, that should fight-
ing flare up again, American squadrons will 
be returned from their present resting loca-
tions in Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Tai-
wan, or the United States?squadrons that 
can be made operational in three clays, ac-
cording to a Seventh Air Force information 
?Meer. Most Air Force personnel I inter-
viewed tended to minimize the importance 
of the reductions in Vietnam itself. 
In any event, more than 350,000 tons of 
bombs-200.000 pounds every hour?will be 
dropped before the end of the year. Clearly, 
as they say out in Cam Ranh Bay, "The name 
of the game is air." 
There wasn't a night when we thought 
we'd live until morning . . . never a morning 
see thought we'd- survive until right. Did 
our children cry? Oh, yes, and we did also. 
I just stayeri in my cave. I didn't see the sun-
light for two years. What did I think about? 
Oh, I used to repeat, "please don't let the 
planes come, please don't let the planes 
come, please don't let the planes come 
?Refugee from the Plain of Jars 
Many Americans believe that the pattern 
of the war fought on the ground in Viet-
nam will spread to the other countries. 
Actually, the opposite seems to be true. The 
air war in Laos has beets going on for several 
years, a concurrent experiment with the land 
war in Vietnam. Neither experiment has 
been successful in stopping guerrilla forces, 
but at least the air war has a possibility for 
surviving the domestic politics while at the 
same time delaying communist takeovers 
in Indochina. It is perhaps the only solution 
for an Administration that wants to keep 
from losing wars abroad and eh:atoms at 
home. 
The air war also involves a change in the 
tactics of battle. If a guerrilla is a fish 
among the sea of the people, the objective 
of the land, war is to remove the fish. The 
air war, however, drains the sea. It has para-
lysed the civilian populations. Vietnam is 
net the future of Laos, but Laos may be the 
future of the war all over Indochina. The 
Era of the Blue Machine has arrived. 
This is my daughter. Khamphong. She's 
three years old. I was fishing in a stream 
with all seven of my children on February 
23, 1969. Suddenly jets came and dropped 
anti-personnel bombs all around. Six of my 
seven children were hit. See, you can still 
feel many pellets in Khamphong's legs and 
beck. There was no soldiers nearby?refugee 
from Plain of Jars. 
For the last two-and-a-half years, bomb-
ing has been the heart of U.S. policy; His-
torians may conic to date this era from 
January 20, 1909. In it, war is waged pri-
marily through the aerial bombardment of 
populated areas. Heavy bombing of civilian 
targets has, of course, occurred during other 
wars, and in the Vietnam war before 1060. 
But in each of these cases, the bombing 
pacers have also deployed large numbers of 
pound troops, with the bombing seen as a 
support effort. 
What the Era of the Blue Machine means 
Is no better illustrated than in portions of 
Laos controlled by the Pathet Lao. Pathet

?? Washington. Euriou of The Stin 
? WaShington, July 7?The 
House rejected. today a resolu-
tion asking the administration 
for information about its mili-
tary operations in Laos, while in 
the Senate two bills were intro-
duced to provide Congress with 
.CIA information and greater 
budgetary control over the agen-
cy. 
The rejected House resolution 
, was offered by Representative 
Paul N. McCloskey, Jr. (R.,. 
Calif.), , It would have directed 
. the secretary of state, "to the 
extent not incompatible with the 
public interest," to turn over to 
the House documents containing 
policy instructions given to the 
U.S. ambassador in Laos. 
? The period covered by the res-
olution was from January 1, 
? 1964, to June 21, 1971. Specific 
information the resolution 
sought pertained to: 
' 1: Covert CIA operations in 
' Laos. . 
2. Thai and other foreign 
armed forces . operations in 
Laos. 
3. U.S. bombing in the coun-
try, other than along the Viet-
nam-related Ho Chi Minh trail. 
4. U.S. armed forces opera. 
tions in Laos. 
? 5? U.S. Agency for InternatiOn-
, al Development operations in 
Laos connected with CIA or mil-
itary operations. 
....e_The' House voted to table, or 
lay aside permanently, the reso-
lution by a 261 to 113 vote. The 
House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee opposed the resolution on the 
grounds that the information 
? sought Was of a "highly sensi-
tive nature," that its disclosure 
"would not be compatible with 
the public interest-'and that the 
administration already has pri-
vately briefed appropriate com-
mittees on the subject. 
Cooper Proposal 
I ? In the Senate, John Sherman 
tz? Cooper (R., Ky.) introduced a 
bill to require the CIA to give to 
certain congressional commit-
tees all information, including 
intelligence analyses, that the 
agency gives to the executive 
branch. Approved For R 
ectei On 1 AaOS 
- t 
The' committees would be the 
House and Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committees, the House For-
eign Affairs Committee and the 
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. 
These committees, in turn, 
would be required to make 
available the CIA information 
that they receive to any mem-
ber of Congress who asks for it, 
in accordance with rules and 
procedures each committee may 
establish. 
? Senator Cooper's proposal is 
drafted as an amendment to the 
1947 National Security Act. Mr. 
Cooper noted that the law does 
not prohibit the CIA from giving, 
intelligence information to Con-
gress,but it does not require the 
agency to do so. 
At present, the CIA reports ? 
regularly to a small group of 
senators and representatives 
within the appropriations and 
armed services commitee of 
, both houses. But other members 
of Congress are not given acceaf, 
. . 
o sinformation.  
In introducing his bill, Senator 
Cooper noted that Congress is 
asked to support the adminis-
tration's foreign and national 
curity decisions by providing , 
money for the deployment of 
weapons, stationing American 
troops abroad and sending them 
into combat, and by approving 
binding commitments to foreign 
countries. 
Such congressional approval, 
he said, "should be given upon 
the best information available to 
both the executive and legisla-
tive branches." ? 
Right To Secrecy 
Senator Cooper said his bill 
would not touch upon the consti-
tutional question of the govern-
ment's right to secrecy, which 
was raised recently by the publi-
cation of the "top-secret" Penta-
gon papers. But he. said he be-
lieved that his bill, if enacted, 
would "result in much declassi-
fication of information for the 
Congress and the public as a 
whole." - ? 
Senator George S. McGovern 
'(D., S.D.) introduced a bill to 
propriations for the CIA to air' 
pear as a single line in the exec-
utive .budget. The measure 
would require the CIA to dis-
close only its total annual budg-
et. 
? At present, CIA expenditures 
are hidden in the budgets of 
other agencies, and only a few 
members of Congress?mem-
bers of small subcommittees: 
? within the appropriation com-
mittees - of both houses?know 
how mueh the CIA is spending.1 
McGovern"s Complaint 
believe that CIA funding is I 
now so substantial," Senator 
McGovern said, "that such a 
single-line item for the agency 
in the budget would not commu-
nicate usable information, to po-
tentia!adversaries." 
Because Congress does not 
know how much it is actually 
appropriating for the CIA, he 1. 
said, it cannot set priorities and I 
balance expenditures' intelli-
gence operations with other do-' 
mestic and defense needs. 
Senator Clifford Case (R. 
N.J.) said he will introduce to-
morrow three other bills, all de-
siged to restrict CIA activities 
abroad. The bills, which Mr. 
Case outlined last month, would 
place congressional controls 
over CIA military operations 
abroad, including the hiring of 
foreign mercenaries and the use 
of U.S. surplus weapons. 
In the House, several other 
resolutions requesting more in-
formation were rejected by 
voice vote after the roll-call on 
the first McCloskey resolution. 
Other resolutions, also offered 
by . Mr. McCloskey, asked for 
documents related to U.S. bomb-
ing operations in northern Laos, 
together with aerial photographs 
of 196 Laotian villages that Mr. 
McCloskey says have been dam-
aged or destroyed by the 
bombing, and documents per-
taininu to ,the U.S.-supported 
pacification, program in South 
Vietnam. 
But the main fight was over 
the first McCloskey resolution, 
which its supporters said would 
turn over to the House only in-

Senator Clifford P. Case,. Re-
publican of New Jersey, said 
he would offer measures that 
would prohibit such C.I.A. activ-
? ites as the funding of Thai 
troops to fight in Laos. 
Senator Cooper emphasized 
In a Senate speech that his 
proposal was not aimed at any 
C.I.A. operations, sources or

Senator Cooper, an aide said, 
had been considering the legis-
lation for three years but dis-
closures in the Pentagon papers 
on United States involvement 
in Vietnam had now provided 
an impetus. 
The aide referred specifical-
ly to C.I.A. analyses during the

in halting infiltration or break-
ing the will of Hanoi. - 
Senator Cooper's proposal

Symington, Democrat of Mis-

'If the proper committees

A secret operation involvin

United States and Laotian of-

Some military sources sug-

the Meo base of Bouam Long, 
north of the plain. 
Informants said two Thai

...By RICHARD DUDIVIAN 
Chief Washington Correspondent 
of the Post-Dispatch 
WASHINGTON, July 8? Sen-
ator John Sherman Cooper 
(Rep), Kentucky, has obtained 
strong bipartisan backing for a 
proposal to require the Central 
Intelligence Agency to report to 
?Congress as well as to the Ex-
ecutive Branch. 
Cooper, a moderate opponent 
of the Vietnam War and of the 
antiballistic missile system, in-
troduced his proposal yesterday 
, as an amendment to the Nation-
-al Security Act of 1917, which 
created the Department of De-
f en s e, the National Security 
Council and the CIA. 
Senators Stuart Symington 
(D e m.), Missouri, J. William 
Fulbright (D e m.), Arkansas, 
and Jacob K. Javits (Rep.), 
New York; announced their . 
... 
support for the measure On the. 
Scea te floor. Fulbright spoke Or 
-holding hearings on the propos-
al. 
- Symington, chairman of a for- ? 
eign relations subcommittee on 
overseas commitments, told of 
difficulties he had had in oh-
taming full information about 
se cr et U.S. military prepara-
tions and operations abroad, in-
cluding the clandestine warfare 
being conducted in Laos. 
Symington noted that he was 
a member of the Foreign Rela-
tions, Armed Services and Joint 
Atomic Energy committees. He 
said that his best information 
had been obtained from the last 
of these, attributing that fact to 
a requirement in the Atomic 
Energy Act that the Atomic En-
ergy _ Commission keen Con-
gress "Tully and currenry" in-
formed. 
Cooper used that phrase in 
his proposed amendment on the 
IA. An aid said that Cooper' 
had found CIA information gen-
/ 
erally reliable on such matters 
as Soviet military preparedness 
and the Indochina War but had 
rioted that. it was rendered only 
in response to specific ques-, 
Cons. , 
, 
Under his amendment, the 
CIA would have to take the ini-
tiative in sending Congress its 
analyses of problems of foreign 
policy and national security. 
The aid said that Cooper had 
been considering such a mea-
sure, for several years. He said 
the publication of the Pentagon 
papers had demonstrated once 
more the value of CIA reports 
a n d probably had broadened 
? support in Congress for a re-
quirement to make them availa-
ble. 
In a Senate speech, Cooper 
proposed that the CIA be re-
quired to make r egul a. r and 
special reports to the House 
A r in e d Services and Foreign 
Affairs committees and to the 
Senate Armed Services and 
Foreign Relations committees. 
Additional special reports could 
be requested by the commit-
tees. 
Any member of Congress orl 
designated member of -his staff' 
would have access to the infor-
mation. All such persons would 
.be subject to security require-
ments such as those in the Ex-
ecutive Branch. 
Cooper said that the best in-
formation should be available 
to the Executive and Legisla-
tive branches as a basis for na-
tional decisions involving "vast 
amounts of money, the deploy-
ment of weapons whose purpose 
is to deter war yet can destroy 
all life on earth, the stationing 
of American troops in other 
countries and their use in com-
bat, and binding commitments 
to foreign nations." 
Two other Senators offered 
proposals relating to the CIA. 
George S. McGovern (Dem.), 
South Dakota, suggested that 
expenditures and appropriations 
for the intelligence agency ap-
pear as a sin,:le line item in the 
budget. Agency funds now are 
concealed in other items in the 
budget. 
Three bills were introduced 
by Senator CI if f ord P. Case 
(Rep.), New Jersey, to limit 
covert use 'of funds and mili-
tary equipment_ by the .c)-?\ for 
fielding foreign troops in Loos 
o r elsewhere -without specific 
approval by Congress. 
Case said they were designed 
:',`to place sonic outside control 
!'oit what has been the free-
wheeling operation of the Exec-
utive Branch in carrying on for-
eign policy and even waging 
foreign wars." 
Meanwhile, .the House reject-
ed a proposal that the Adminis-
tration be required to tell it; 
' John Sherman 
Co a pr 
what the military and CIA were 
doing in Laos. 
Dy a vote of 261 to 118, mem-

resentative Paul N. McCloskey 
(Rep.), California, that would 
have ordered the Secretary of 
State to furnish the House. with 
the policy guidelines given to 
the U.S. ambassador in Laos.' 
.The ambassador has responsi-
bility for overseeing the clan-
destine 'military operations in 
Laos aimed at assisting the roy-
al Laotian government in its 
struggle with the Pathet Lao.. 
Will B. Macomber Jr., 
deputy under secretary of state, 
clashed yesterday with Mc-
Closkey over whether the De-
partment of State was directing 
U.S. bombing attacks in Laos. 
Macomber denied the allega-
tion and suggested that if Mc-
Closkey wanted to pursue the 
issue he ought to invite an East 
Asia expert from the State De-
partment to testify.

questions from Rep. Paul N.

about U.S. bombing in Laos. 
? . ? Macomber told a House free-
doth of information hearing yes-
terday he knows little of what 
ioes on in Laos. 
He said he was invited to tes-
tify- about the State Depart-
ment's system of classifying 
clocuments and any further ef-
fort to try and get him to talk 
about Laos would further strain 
relations between State and Con-
tress. ? .

ifIg at what he feels is a calcu-
lated administration effort to 
hide a clandestine war in Laos 
from Congress and the public. 
He said each bombing strike in 
that country is personally con-

"that would have directed the

? 7-Year War Claimed 
McCloskey told the House that 
the United States has been at 
-war in Laos for seven years and 
more bombs have been dropped 
in that one country than were 
rained on Nazi Germany. 
But Rep. Peter H. B. Frelin-
ghuysen, R-N.J., argued that the 
resolution was an unwise at-
tempt to obtain highly sensitive 
'information. 
Although Macomber, in his 
testimony before the subcom-
mittee headed by Rep. William 
Moorhead, D-Pa., declined to 
talk about Laos, he agreed that 
many State Department docu-
ments are over-classified. 
Half of the approximately 
400,000 documents accumulated 
at State each year, he said, are 
marked Top Secret, Secret of 
Confidential. 
- About 6,000 State Department 
officers have authority to classi-
fy documents, Macomber said, 
and some misuse that power to 
simply limit distribution of the 
papers involved. 
He suggested there should be 
some kind of automatic system 
for declassifying documents aft-
cr. A period of time, perhaps 10 
years. 
A shorter declassification peri-
od?some have suggested two 
years?would be unrealistic, Ma-
comber said, and just lead to 
new and bigger bureaucratic 
problems. 
? -In the Senate, meanwhile, Sen. 
John Sherman Cooper, R-Ky., 
introduced legislation reauiring 
the Central Intellgence Agency ! 
to provide Congress- regularly 
with detailed intelligence infor-i

this kind of evaluation and anal-

A SALUTE TO WADE LUCAS 
(Mr. HENDERSON asked and was 
? given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HENDERSON. Mr. Speaker, 
scarcely a day goes by without our na-
tional news media publicizing a conflict 
between Indians and civil authorities 
over the title to Federal property, alleged 
violations of legal or moral commitments 
or other .basic differences of opinion. 
It is refreshing to know that on Satur-
day of this week, Mr. Wade Lucas, a con-
stituent of mine will be visiting Niagara 
Falls, N.Y., as a guest of the Tuscarora 
Indians. While there, he will be made an 
honorary chief and, with the authority of 
Gov. Robert Scott of North Carolina, will 
sign a formal peace treaty with the Tus-
carora Indian Nation. 
I might add that Wade Lucas, unlike 
so many "Honorary Chiefs" we see at 
campaign time, is not a politician run-
ning for office and seeking to court, favor 
with Indian voters. Instead, Wade is a 
retired newspaperman with no aim or 
purpose in mind other than to cement 
a personal and official friendship with 
these Indians which dates back to Me-
morial Day ; ore than 8 years ago when 
he visited the.Tonawanda Reservation in 
an official capacity as public information 
officer for the State of North Carolina 
under the adrrnnistration of Gov. Terry 
Sanford. 
The Tuscarora Indians of the Tona-
wanda. Reservation are a lot like many 
other Americans of all races and creeds 
throughout our Nation. They respond 
warmly to a genuine show of friendship 
and interest. Wade Lucas' longtime per-
sonal friendship with them is the kind 
of "people to people" relationship which 
will solve our international differences 
if they are ever to be solved. 
INTRODUCTION OF .LEGISLATION 
INCREASING FEDERAL SHARE OF 
EMPLOYEES' HEALTH BENEFITS 
PRO GRAM 
(Mr. WALDIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute, to revise and extend his remarks 
and include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. WALDIE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to introduce a bill calling 
for increasing the Government's share of 
the Federal employees' health benefits 
program. 
Under the present cost-sharing system, 
the Federal Government pays 40 percent 
of the basic Cost of the health insurance 
of Federal employees. 
. This 40-percent figure was reached 
only last year. The House of Representa-
tives had passed legislation calling for 
increasing the Government share to 50 
percent, but after considerable pressure 
from the administration, including the 
threat of a Presidential veto, House-
Senate conferees agreed to a reduced 
figure. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that the attitude 
of the administration may have changed 
in the course of the past year. On Febru-
ary 18 of this year, President Nixon called 
for private employers to provide 65 per-
cent of the cost of basic health insur-
ance coverage for employees as of July 1; 
1973, and '75 percent of the total cost 
3 years later. 
The President based this appeal on 
the need to spread health insurance cov-
erage to more of the Nation's citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the 
President on this matter. 
Further, I believe it to be fully con-
sistent and proper for the Federal Gov-
ernment to lead the way for the private 
motor in meeting the President's goal of 
'75 percent of the costs; for employees' 
medical insurance. 
I hope that the Retirement, Insurance, 
and Health Benefits Subcommittee, 
which I chair, will hold hearings on this 
important legislation in the very near 
future, and I am hopeful of administra-
tion support for this proposal, which in-
corporates the President's own sugges-
tions.

RESPECTING U.S'. OPERATIONS IN 
?LAOS 
Mr. MORGAN. Mr. Speaker, I call up 
House Resolution 492 and ask for its 
immediate consideration. ? 
The Clerk read the resolution as fol-
lows: - 
? H. RES. 492 
Resolved, That the Secretary of State, to 
the extent not incompatible with the public 
interest, is directed to furnish to the House 
of Representatives, not later than fifteen 
days following the adoption of this resolu-
tion, any documents containing policy in-
structions or guidelines given to the United 
States Ambassador in Laos for the purpose 
of his administration of those operations con-
trolled or directed by the country team In 
Laos, between January 1, 1964, and June 21, 
1971, particularly with regard to?
(1) covert Central Intelligence Agency op-
erations in Laos; 
(2) Thal and other foreign armed forces 
operations in Laos;

would perform the function of governing the 
local agencies, as the Farm Credit system now 
operates. 
? Another agency, the Rural Development: 
Investment Equalization Administration, 
would handle the subsidy end of this pro-
P ? 
osal It would be handled separately to avoid 
?' problems of getting loan and grant money 
Mixed into the same financial pot. 
? It has been alleged by those who claim that 
industry will not move to rural America that 
- it costs more money to operate away from the 
population centers, and as a result, the 
chance for a major dispersal of .industry is 
doomed to failure. 
. The sponsors of the Consolidated Farm and 
Rural Development Act do not necessarily 
? agree with.this conclusion, but a number of 
States have proved that investment incen-
tives do draw industries. 
? Rather than provide under-the-table or 
backdoor subsidies, this legislation would 
? make open subsidies available, but only un-
der stringent and controlled circumstances, 
and this would be done on a national basis 
rather than the state-by-state effort now go-
ing on. 
It must be stressed that these would not be 
relief payments to fieca'lly healthy industries, 
' but they would be incentives to American 
--industry to disperse. 
There would be two kinds of subsidies: 
: 1. Interest supplements: If a firm cannot 
? pay his interest out of local earnings without 
? dipping into its capital, the company can be 
given an interest supplement by the Rural 
Development Investment Equalization Ad-
ministration. Th?i payment could not bring 
-the firm's interest level lower than one-per-
- cent. 
. 2. Rural Development Capita! Augmenta-
tion Payments: If a community wanted to 
- build a sewer system, a calculation would be 
made of how much such a system would cost, 
and then it would be determined how much 
the people in the community could reason-
ably be expected to pay for it. The difference 
between these two figures would be the Rural 
Development Capital Augmentation payment. 
The same formula could be used for develop-
ment of new industry, but again it must be 
stressed that this procedure would be under 
- strict controls so that this money would not 
? be used for fly-by-night or doomed-to-fail 
businesses. 
THE REORGANIZATION 
Under this bill farm and non-farm credit 
- would come under a new Assistant Secretary 
Of Agriculture. Under him, in two separate 
agencies, would- be the Farm Development 
Administration, which now handles all farm 
credits (under the title Farmers Home Ad-
ministration) and tho Rural Enterprise and 
Community Development Administration, 
?, Which would handle all non-farm rural 
credit. 
The 
? The new assistant secretary would be as-
signed to no other duties than to oversee 
?? all rural credit. At present, the assistant 
-. ? secretary handling this task, must also super-
vise a wide range of other activities. 
?- The 19 members of the Rural Development 
Credit Board would have five members ap-
pointed by the President of the United 
-States; five nominated by the-President Pro 
tempore of the Senate; and five nominated 
after consideration of the recommendations 
of the Speaker of the House. 
? The Secretary of Agriculture would appoint 
the same, person who is his representative 
to the Farm Credit Board: The governor 
of the Farm Credit Administration would be 
another member of the board. The Execu-
. tive Director of the Rural Development 
Credit Agency, and the Rural Development 
Investment Equalization Administration 
would sit on the board as ex-officio members.

Executive in the formulation of -foreign 
policy and national security policy and 
the authority to commit our Armed 
Forces to war. We have experienced, un-
fortunately, confrontation between the 
two branChes of our Government. It is 
my belief that if both branches, execu-
tive and legislative, have access to the 
same intelligence necessary for such 
fateful decisions, the working relation-
ship between the Executive and the 
Congress would be, on the whole, more 
harmonious and more conducive to the 
national interest. It would ? assure a 
common understanding of. the, purposes 
and merits of policies. It is of the great-
est importance to the support and trust 
of the people. It is of the greatest im-
portance to the maintenance of our sys-
tem of government, with its separate 
branches, held so tenuously together by 
trust -and. reason. 
It is reasonable, I submit, to contend 
that the Congress, which must make its 
decisions upon foreign and security pol-
icy, which is called upon to commit the 
resources of the Nation, material and hu-
man, should have all the information 
and intelligence available to discharge 
properly and morally its responsibilities 
to our Government and the people. 
I send to the table a bill amending the 
National Security Act of 1947, which, I 
hope, would make it possible for the leg-

responsibilities.

branch. At the present time, the intel-
ligence information and analyses devel-
oped by the CIA and other intelligence 
agencies of the Government are avail-
able only to the executive es a matter 
of law. This bill would not, in any way, 
affect the activities of the CIA, its sources 
or methods, nor would it diminish in any 
respect the authority of already existing 
committees and oversight groups, which 
supervise the intelligence collection ac?
tivities of the Government. My bill is 
concerned only with the end result?the 
facts and analyses of facts. It would, of 
course, in no way inhibit the use by the 
Congress of analyses and information 
from sources outside the Government. It 
is obvious that with the addition of intel-
ligence facts and their analyses, the Con-
gress would be in a much better position 
to make judgments from a much more 
informed and broader perspective than 
is now possible. 
The National Security Act of 1947 
marked a major reorganization of the 
executive branch: This reorganization 
made it possible for the executive branch 
to assume more effectively the responsi-
bilitieS of the United States in world af-
fairs and the maintenance of our own 
national security. The National Security

' "71: 
- By TA?,IMY AriBUCKLE 
?? Special to The Star 
VIENTIANE L. The United 
States has launched a new se-
cret operation against the Plain 
of Jars, a Communist - held area 
In. northern Laos, well - in-
formed sources say. "Comman-
do raiders, some led by Ameri-
can military men in CIA employ 
have penetrated as far as Lima 
?22, an air strip in the east cen-
tral plain. 
U.S. aircraft are landing on 
the . plain. An Air America C123 
transport was stranded with its 
American crew on the plain for 
a night, according to \veil - in-
formed sources. U.S. officials, 
however, refuse to discuss the 
operation making it difficult to 
assess the operation's exact 
magnitude or objectives. 
One American source claimed 
'Moo Gen. - Vang Pao was 
"strengthening and improving 
his defensive position." Sources 
.said Vang Pao took Ban Na, 
key hill overlooking the plain 
last Tuesday. Unfortunately this 
claim of strengthening defenses 
. does not jell with the U.S. pres-
ence on the plain or the exces-
sive secrecy cloaking the opera-
lion on the part of U.S. and Lao 
officials. 
Fraiight With Danger 
To clear North Vietnamese 
from the hills South of the plain 
and establish positions on hill-
tops overlooking the plain would 
be excellent, as it would give 
. yang Pao's forces a breather 
until the next dry season. 
However, to go onto the plain 
Is fraught with both military and 
political danger. 
In 1.969, a joint U.S. and Lao 
, operation, About Face took the 
plain from the Communists 
briefly, but resulted in massive 
:Hanoi- retaliation Which drove 
CIA-led Meos back farther than 
. ester before and almost resuted 
In .the secret base of Long Chen 
:falling. A new offensive could 
Ornean that final end to feelers

has frequently made clear it will 
riot tolerate a U.S. or govern-
jars and has stifficidit force to 
push the corrupt, ill-managed 
Lao forces off plain again when-
ever it wants. . 
Some military sources have 
suggested that the Plain of Jars 
push is to relieve the pressure 
on the Tao base of liouam Long, 
north of the plain.. - ? 
. When correspondents tried to 
find what the operation was 
about, Gen. Thongph Knoksy, 
t h e government spokesman, 
dodged into the corridors of 
Lao-headquarters. U.S. officials 
adamantly refuse to speak un-
less Thong Pun h speaks first. 
It is almost unbelievable-that 
after Senate censure and publi-
cation of the Pentagon docu-
ments' a U.S. mission in Laos 
should once again resort to se-
crecy particularly concerning a - 
U.S. run operation close to North 
Vietnalu and China. 
The operation previously re-
stilled in tough Communist retal-
iation and caused considerable 
government and civilian loss in 
1939. There can be no doubt the 
operation is considerable in size. , 
The Pathet Lao radio which, al..' 
though it is Communist., has 
been most truthful to date On 
Lao operations, says three.regi-
ments of Vang Pao's forces are 
tnvolved. Vientiane military 
sources say two Thai-battalions 
and six Lao'1\leo battalions are 
involved. U.S. air power is again 
extremely active over the plain, 
where Some 5,000 civilians are 
still living. American embassy 
officials are trying to blame 
Vang Pao for the operation. 
"yang Pao is very much his own 
man, _three American officials 
said separately. 
As all three used the same 
words, one can only assume 
somebody told them to say this. 
Yana' Pees' formes are advised, 
paid: armed, clothed and some-
times led by CIA employes and 
it is impossible for the general 
to ?.do anything big without 
Af-,;Zrican approval. Some mid-
dle-level Americans are already 
having second thoughts. 
They fear that if Yang Pao 
finds no early Hanoi? opposition 
he may continue to advance, 
bringing the U.S. into a new 
znent presence on the plain of northern Laos debacle.- ?5

WEEKLY - 497 
Much has been said lately 
about the effort of Congress to 
reassert and redefine its author-
ity in the liold of foreign policy. 
1 am much interested in this, 
not as an exercise in congres-
sional self-aggrand.me.nt., but 
as a Means of forcing our gov-
ernment to conduct foreign 
policy in the open sc.) that the 
PI-1ft may know what is going 
on and have, the controlling, 
voice in important. decisions. 
Our recent history in South-
east Asia shows that wars ap-
proved by simply a handful of 
presidential advisors may well 
be not only unconstitutional but 
relatively unsuccessfulz too. .? 
'Like most AnlerieTanS, I have 
been shocked by the. .cynical 
Manipnlation of our political 
proceues revealed in The New

I voted for the llatteld-
McGovern proposal to set a def-

from Vietnam. 
The. term "secret \Val." has 
now come iota our national 
vocabulary. We started off in 
Vietnam operating in secret and 
we are currently fighting a war 
in -Laos in the same. way. We 
are spending annually about

? WASHINGTON, D.C., June 29----rte1). Joln E. Moss (D-Calif:) watned the Nixon 
Administration today that government officials could be cited for ``contempt of Con-
ress" for refusing to furnish information on U.S. foreign policy decisions vital to the 
Interests of the American people. 
In a sbarp. exchange with an of-
ficial of the .Justice Department, 
? Moss, during hearings before the 
.Sub-ComMittee on Government 
Operations took the confrontation 
between Congress and the execu-
-tivel?ranch One step further. 
Evidence that the U.S. has en-
gaged in 20 years of cold war by 
a systematic policy of presiden-
tial deceit is spurring both Sena-
tors and Representatives toward a 
Congressional crackdown on the 
. executive branch. . 
The immediate issue is Execu-
tive Branch secrecy but the 
larger issue is the untold cost of 
the cold war policy itself?hun-
dreds of thousands of dead. and 
wounded GI's in two undeclared 
wars and one trillion dollars in 
taxpayer funds since World War 
II. ? 
- 
? Plans shrouded in secrecy 
The hearings before the Sub-
committee, sparked by the 47-vol-
ume Pentagon study on how the 
U.S. gOt into the Indochina war, 
Is revealing to. the people that the 
government systematioally con?
cealed its policy aims. ? 
? Rep. Moss told Assistant Attor-
ndy General William H. Rehn-
quist, that the use of "executive 
privilege" has shrouded from the 
people the foreign policy plans of 
five consecutive administrations. - 
He said that "executive privil-
ege," first claimed by President 
Nixon in Exectith,T Order 1001, 
is subject to be overrided by   
Con-
gress. 
. 
Executive privilege,. he declar-
ed, "is e not a constitutional au-
thority. . . Congress is not with-
Out pciwer to punish for contempt 
of Congress an official Who refuses 
tci furnish information to Repre-
sentatives of the people." 
Rehnquist admitted that "con-
gress could supersede Executive 
Order ROI by passing 1gislation 
stipulating rules for classification 
.and declassification of secret in-
formation. But, he added the Pre-
sident would have to. decide whe-
ther or not the act was constitu-
tional. .? 
Moss bridled at this suggestion 
demanding, '.'The President? .Not 
the ,.courts? Are you saying that 
the President could suspend the
. _ 
Rehnquist flushed and correct-
..ed himself. The President, he saki, 
could seek a ..ruling from the 
courts on the constitutionality of 
the measure. 
. - 
Meanwhile, Sen. Clifford Case' 
(R-NJ)) accused the Nixon Ad-
ministration of "overt manipula-
tion or suppression" of a scientific 
report that could lead to quick rati-
fication of a ban on underground 
nuclear tests. 
? Case said scientists have invent-
ed an instrument that can detect 
explosions as low as 4.0 on the 
Richter Seale, making unnecese 
sary "on-site inspections" which 
have been a stumbling block in 
negotiations. 
New findings suppressed

pressed because they "conflict 
With entrenched interests or cause

denying any funds for CIA secret 
wars: said his purpose is 'to

TESTIMONY BEFORE ?THE SUB-
COMMITTEE ON ASIAN AND PA-
CIFIC AFFAIRS 
HON. DONALD W. RIEGLE, JR. 
OF IvIICIIIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 1, 1971 
Mr. RIEGLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
our colleague from California (Mr. Mc-
CLosKEY) testified before the Subcom-
mittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs of the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs. His 
testimony related to the need. for Con-
gress to be fully informed, and described 
a series of incidents where the execu-
tive branch over the years, had withheld 
Information from the Congress or delib-
erately deceived the Congress. While 
reasonable minds may differ as to the 
"course this Nation should now pursue 
with respect to terminating our involve-
ment in Vietnam, I believe all of us can 
?agree on the need for Congress to de-
mand that it be fully informed on all as-
pects of the situation in Southeast Asia. 
For this reason, I am inserting in_ the 
RECORD ME. McCloskey's testimony in 
full: 
STATEMENT Or. PAUL N.. INTcCr.osKar, JR., BE-
FORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE' ON ASIAN AND 
PACIFIC AFFAIRS, HOUSE-COMMITTEE'ON FOR-
EIGN Arrants, JUNE 29, 1971 
Mr, Chairman and Members of the Subcom-
mittee: I had hoped originally to testify be-
fore you today with respect to the Viet Nam 
Disengagement Act of 1971, urging, the bone-
rmar July 
fits of an end to our Involvement n anti over 
Indochina by-December 31, 1971, Conditional 
solely upon the. safe return of our prisoners 
of war. Arguments favoring this view already 
have been made by a number of our col-
- leagues, however, and accordingly, I would 
like to limit my testimony today to an issue 
which is equally important, the obligation of 
the House to be fully informed by the Execu-
tive Branch on the great issues of foreign af-
fairs, and particularly the Intervention by 
the United States in the affairs of foreign 
nations, either by covert CIA-operated action 
as In Laos or military Intervention as in Viet 
Nam. 
There . is ? reasonable disagreement in the 
House over what our course of action in 
Southeast Asia should be There should be no 
disagreement, however, on our need to know, 
and our right to know, all of the facts which 
may bear on our ultimate decision. 
? It is true that Congress Is not suited to 
negotiation and clay-to-day decision making 
in intelligence and military operations. We 
do hold,- however, the sole constitutional 
power, and. I might add, constitutional re-
sponsibility, for providing for the common 
defense, declaring war, funding the standing 
army, but for a period not to exceed two 
years; we in the House of Representatives 
who face our constituents every two years, 
not four or S1E, must initiate the revenue 
measures necessary to support the nation's 
expenditures for -war ancl foreign operations 
'of every, kind. 
; All of these provisions were clearly intend-
ed by the framers of the Constitution to give 
Congress the controlling decisions in matters 
of war and peace. We make the laws; the 
President as Commander-in-Chief only ex-
ecutes those laws. 
If Congress is to make wise decisions, how-
ever, we must be fully informed. We cannot 
authorize a war without complete informa-
tion; we should not permit a war to continue 
without complete information. 
The recent excerpts from the Pentagon 
documents published in the New York Ti712CS 
and other newspapers bring home to us most 
forcefully that we have not met our consti-
tutional obligations to keep fully informed. 
Who amongst the Members of the House were 
aware,?for example, that country team mem-
bers in Viet Nam aicled and encouraged the 
overthrow of Premier Diem in 1933? 
Who amongst our Members knew the true 
facts of U.S. military and covert activity in 
and over Laos, and in the coastal waters of 
North Viet Nam prior to the Tonkin Gulf 
Incidents of early August, 1964? Or that dur-
ing October, 1964, prior to the re-election of 
President Johnson over Senator Goldwater, 
that 
'Two of the teams (of U.S./South Vietnam-
ese agents operating' mettle North Viet 
Nam) carried out successful actions during 
October. One demolished a bridge,, the other 
ambushed a North Vietnamese patrol." 
(This quote was taken from -a State De-
partment memo, dated November 7, 1964. 
for Assistant Secretary of State Bundy, and 
Is noted at page 115107 of the Congressional 
Record of June 14, 1971). 
If these facts had been known to the Con-
gress, would it have affected subsequent votes 
on appropriations for Viet Nam, or the ap-
proval of escalation of the war implicit in the 
House appropriations process? 
What' would have been the House's reac-
tion, for example, had we been fully in-
formed in March, 1965, before U.S. troops 
were sent to Viet Nam, that our true goals 
In Viet Nam were those described by Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense McNaughton in a 
memo to Secretary McNamara in March, 
1965: 
"70%?To avoid a humiliating, U.S. defeat 
(to our reputation as a guarantor). 
"20%--To keep SVN (and then adjacent) 
territory from Chinese hands.

I . 
. ? ? ? ? - ? - 
As indicated .our 493 and 533 Diem normal. Diem government.is in quite. 
regime confronted by two separate but serious danger. Therefore, in my opinion 
? related dangers. Danger from demon- prompt and even drastic action is called : 
?strations or coup attempt in Saigon for. I am well aware that Diem has in 
could *occur earlier; likely to be pre- past demonstrated astute judgment and ? 
dominantly non-Communistic in origin has survived other serious crises. Pas-. 
but Communists can be expected to sibly his judgment will prove superior 
e endeavor infiltrate and exploit any such to ours this time, but I believe never-
attempt. Even more serious danger is theless we have 110 alternative but to ? 
? gradual Viet Cong extension of control 
over countryside which, if current Com-
munist progress continues, would mean 
loss free Viet-nam ? to Communists. 
? ; These two dangers are related because 
'Communist successes in rural areas 
embolden them to extend their activities 
_ 
to Saigon and because non-Communist 
temptation to engage in demonstrations 
or coup is partly motivated by sincere 
desire prevent Communist take-over in 
Viet?nam. ? 
? Essentially [word illegible] sets of 
measures required to meet these two 
' dangers. For Saigon danger essentially 
political and psychological measures re-
quired. For countryside danger security 
measures as well as political, psycho 
logic:31,11nd 'economic measures needed. 
? However both sets measures should be 
carried out simultaneously and to some 
extent individual steps will be aimed at 
both dangers. 
?. Security recommendations have been ; 
made in our 539 and other messages, 
Including formation internal security 
council, centralized intelligence, etc. 
This message therefore deals with our 
poJiticlil and economic recommenda-
tions. I realize some Measures I am

most [word illegible] for an ambassador

give him our best judgment of what we 
believe is required to preserve his gov-

my frank talks earlier this year and will 
probably resent even more suggestions 
outlined below, he has apparently acted 
on some of our earlier suggestions and 
might act on at least some of the 
following: ? 
' 
1. I would -propose have frank and 
friendly talk with Diem and explain our 
serious concern about present situation 
and his political position: I would toll 
him that, while matters I am ? raising 
deal primarily with internal affairs, I 
would like to talk to him frankly and 
try to be as helpful as I can be giving 
him the considered judgment of myself 
and some of his friends in Washington-
cnn appropriate measures to assist him

best not indicate talking under instruc-
tions.) I would particularly stress de-

Dear- Sir: 
THE C.I.A. IN ASIA (II): No intelligence operation in Asia is as well-
heeled as that. of the U.S. .Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). 
The annual working budget of the C.I.A. runs over US$600 million. 
Thatust? a starter. 
The agena spends far more than that in Asia alone if you count the cost 
of some of the "borrowed" from othtr r. S. Government agencies. For 
instance: 
--U.S. Air Force planes are used to monitor foreign nuclear tests and ? 
collect air samples. The agency,. ,while having its own cryptographers, draws 
on the Army's .corps of 100,000 code specialists and eavesdroppers to tap 
Asian communications. 
---C.I.A. specialists often operate off U.S. Navy ships in the Pacific, 
usually involved in electronic surveillance. 
. ---The agency also is privy to information from the Defense Intelligence 
Agency (D.I.A.) which has a substantial operation of its own in Asia. 
The D.I.A. spends from its own budget more than US$1 billion a year 
flying reconnaisance planes and keeping satellites aloft. 
Those satellites anew C.I.A. analysts to know more---from photographs. 
.taken 130 miles up---about China's topography than do the Chinese themselves: 
---The U.S. State Department's intelligence section also feeds a considerable 
amount of cofidential data it collects through its embassies, consulates 
and travellqg diplomats to the Th..I.S includes information gathered 
by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) the Justice Department 
and the U.S. Treasury (Secret Service) often attached to diplomatic missions 
abroad. 
The C.I:A. also works closely with the' intelligence services and police 
forces of the countries considered AMericar7-71lies in Asia, exchanging 
information with them. 
Where des all the C.I.A. money go? 
It funnels out in myriad direction's: To pay for the agency's overt 
intelligence gathering actiVities, to-finance "dirty tricks" and other 
clandestine capers, to prop up ousted or failing politicians and to pay for 
"disinformation" and other psychological, warfare ploys. 
Despite the C.I.A.'s oft-deserved sinister image, a good deal of its 
funds are expended on open intelligence gathering operations. 
These go for ?subscriptions to newspapers, periodicals and other publications 
and salariesfOr those who must scan them for intelligence tidbits. 
It is estimated that more than. 507. of the C.J..A.'s world-wide intelligence 
.input comes from such overt sources. ?(An estimated 357. comes from electronic 
.spying and less than 157. from JAMES BOND-type,-cloak-and-dagger operations.) 
An exception is Asia. 
A greater amount of. the C.I.A. funds expended in Asia go into covert 
activities..,

C.I.A. "bagmen" ride regular circuits in Asia making monthly payoffs 
to informers, subsidizing "friendly" politicians or now-outsted political 
leaders who onte served U.S, interests, or dropping off funds to under-Write 
businesses-used as Covers for agents.. 
In Indo-China, some of thee "bagmen" move around with hardly any 
attempt to hide what they are up to. In places like Djakarta or Hong Kong 
.or Tokyo, more sophistication is attached to the game. 
C.I.A. funding 'activities in' Asia cover a wide and varied scope. 
Despite a pledge by President Nixon to remove the C.I.A. from such 
'activities, it is still engaged in supportim, foundationst institutes and  
other ostensible research oranilations and stud grouos. 
-----Quite a few Asian students are enjoying educational opportunities as 
a result of C.I.A.-supplied "scholarships", sometimes without the students' 
knowing where the money originates. 
It's no secret that more than a few of those young American Ph.D. 
candidates doing sociological studies in the jungles of the southern Philippines 
or the highlands of Malaysia are full-time agents. 
Another activity falls under the category of "disinformation" or 
counter-intelligence and ranges from the spreading of rumors to the under-
writing of publications in local languages, both aimed at swaying opinion 
in a certain direction. 
That grey-haired Thai scholar ensconced in a small but comfortable . 
Bangkok house writing a book on the historical reasons why Thais should stand 
firmly against Communism might well have more than a publisher bank-roiling 
his effort. 
Gathering'documents o1.tical and otherwise, also accounts' for some of 
the C.I.A.'s large expenditures in Asia. 
More than a few Canton-Macao ferry crew members pocketed healthy- sums / 
during the Cultural Revolution by selling Red Guard and other documents to cl 
C.I.A. agents. 
And then there are, the covert and quasi-covert, Military or para-military 
operations financed by the C.I.A., including the 25,000-man force in Laos-" 
once known as the "opium army"---commanded by Meo tribesman Gen. VANG PAO and 
advised by 1511-175 C.I.A.. men, and the continuing C.I.A. supply of arms and 
ammunition to Tibetan rebels who .make Periodiej'raids on Chinese Communist 
troops in Tibet. 
As is the usual practice, funds come bV circuitous routes. 
Nearly half of all American aid earmarked for war refugees in Laos is 
in fact C.I.A. funds beinb sorplied to CV.e Vanb Pao forces. 
And then 'there's that shadowy airline known as Air America, which someone 
once described as the worldr-s-mmOst shot at airline" and which is partically 
funded by C.I.A. money. 
' With millions of dollars to work with, the C.I.A.'s hand is felt in taa 
and many ways.

Whether the Pentagon papers 
contain anything that might jeopardize 
national security remains a topic of 
international debate. 
But there can be little debate over 
the impropriety of a story printed 
Sunday by the Philadelphia Bulletin 
and the Seattle Times. 
The newspapers reported that the 
Central Intelligence..Agency is sending 
Laotian hill tribesmen on spying 
missions from Laps into Communist 
China. 
Their purpose ? is to obtain in-
formation as to troop movements and 
political developments. 
. Publication of a story informing an 
avowed enemy of this country of such 
activity, it seems to us, is a reckless 
from of irresponsible journalism. 
It could jeopardize the acquisition 
of intelligence information necessary 
to competent planning. It could 
jeopardize the lives of intelligence 
agents. . 
If the-two newspapers regard this 
as some colossal "scoop", it wasn't big 
enough to justify the potential cost.

post to slowly improving rela-

'They believe this threat is

Abrams said his sources claim 
such intelligence missions have 
long been known to Chinese au-

have been captured in recent 
years. 
"Consequently, American offi-

WASHINGTON ? President 
Nixon is making a tragic mistake 
In his assessment that the use. of 
'drugs by U.S. servicemen in 
Vietnam is "by no means a majoi. 
part of the American narcotics 
problem", as he said in his drug 
abuse control message to 
Congress. 
. The 'accelerated movement of-
, the bored or seared "grants" into 
? the legion of thoae who smoke or 
? snort herion strikes at the heart ' 
- of the narcotics cancer of the 
future, if not of the present.

; CHAIRMAN Vance Hartite, D-
l Ind., of ? the &nate Veterans 
Affairs Committee, estimates 
7 there are more than 375,000 men 
? ? ? ? 
re tuff from Vietnam now 
looking for jobs. Almost none of 
them ?and those who arejoining 
them weekly are likely to latch 
on to any payroll check that 
would support an addict's habit. 
The addiet will turn naturally to 
crime. 
Nobody really knows how 
many uniformed young Ameri-
cans in Southeast Asia are 
mortgaging their future lives by 
using dangerous drugs. Only Fe-
cently and belatedly has offi- , 
cialdom become grudgingly 
alarmed at the Spread of this 
menace. 
Rep. Seymour Mb e ro ,R-N.Y., 
who bought heroin easily on the 
streets of Saigon to demonstrate , 
its availability, estimates there 
are 00,000 users of the drug in 
uniform. This works out close to 
one quarter of the U.S. troops ? 
in the war zone. 
Reps. Morgan F. Murphy, D-
n., and Robert H. Steele, R-
Conn., who made their own in-
vestigation in Vietnam, think 
30,000 to 40,000 have a serious 
heroin habit.  
- I 
NIXON'S new program is 
aimed primarily at reducing the 
number of GI addicts who will 
come home untreated and at 
providing folowup treabnent for - 
them. Urine tests will be given all 
returning veterans. Detected 
addicts will be put, through a 
seven-day course of 
detoxification in Vietnam, 
followed ? by three weeks .of ? 
treatment at home. 
, ? 
This is all very well as far as it 
goes. But, it does nothing for the 
thousands of addicts who still 
.have time to serve in Vietnam. 
Steele's suggeslion that all U.S. 
servicemen be tested at least 
once a month ought . to be ? 
'followed. 
Nixon.has promised to attack 
the narcotics supply on an inter-
national plane. He is having some 
success in Turkey, where the 
government is struggling to 
..cohtrol the growing of opium 
poppies. Smuggled opium from 
Turkey is said to be the source of 
three-fourths of the heroin en-
tering this country. 
THIS progress in Europe, 
however, has not been matched 
in Asia. . There, the friendly 
countries of Burma, Laos and 
Thailand produce about 700 tons 
of opium annually, about half of 
the world's illicit output. 
Production of the raw drug and 
its refining is carried on in the 
"Golden Triangle" border area 
that feeds heroin into South 
Vietnam. There it is Sold on the 
streets ? often by children -- to 
American servicemen. The 
Nixon administration has put the 
screws on Saigon's President 
Nguyen Van Thieu to crack down, 
on the traffic. But this fails to get 
at The supply..

Discussions with the govern-
ments of Burma, Laos and. 
Thailand are not going to get very 
far. Unfortunately, these 
governments have very little" 
clout in the Mekong River

border area, where irregular

and transport heroin.

!,_. T, 
?THE continuing storm over.publication of . 
-secret Pentagon papers contains lessons for 
all of us in the news business and for the 
country and the government as well. 
The newspapers are learning from this, 
episode and from the national loss of memo-
ry that has occurred since 1964 that their 
.Impact on public opinion in the United States 
Is tragically limited. The substance and in 
- some cases the precise details of virtually 
everything The Washington Post and The. 
.New York Times have printed from the Pen-
tagon papers is ancient history. It was near-
ly all published while it was happening. And 
it was largely a futile enterprise; neither the 
public nor the-congressional politicians were 
listening. 
? The government is learning something, 
too. It is learning that policy is poorly com-
municated and public opinion is poorly 
shaped by proxy. All through the early' 
- 1960s, government officials were anonymous-
ly "leaking" their fears and "options" for 
Vietnam through the press as a substitute 
? for public candor and direct communication 
with the people. This produced considerable 
support for the government's zig-zag policies 
by most of the major newspapers, including. 
The Post and The Times. But newspaper 
editorials are not necessarily the voice of 
the people, and newspapers, as is now evi-
dent, are inadequate instruments for public 
education, 
. What tile public and politicians could 
learn from this experience is that if they 
sit there asleep in the back row while their 
? destinies ere being debated, they are In a 
poor position when the slumber ends to cry 
foul and search for ? scapegoats. ? 
6-4-9 ? 
THE FACTS of this particular case are 
. that The Post and The Times and other 
large IlOWS organizations published: thou-
sands of stories, editorials and essays in 
- 1901 describing the deteriorating military and 
political situation in Vietnam?just as it 
was described in the official memoranda. 
and cables in the Pentagon papers. The vari-
ous options' and contigency plans being put 
before- the President at that time were re-
ported-. repeatedly and accurately?as they 
are now reported hi the official papers, 
. The growing combat role of American 
forces was laid out in impressive detail on 
front. pages all over the country?the first 
use's of napalm against suspected enemy 
..villages, the commitment of U.S. helicopters 
- 'and crewmen to the battlefields, the recon-
naissance, bombing and strafing missions of 
? US. aircraft in South Vietnam end Laos, 
the 'U.S. role in the training and transport 
pf. South Vietnamese raiding parties into 
North Vietnam, the participation of U.S. 
'advisers and Special Forces teams in major 
battles, the use of U.S. troops in perimeter 
: defense at military bases. The circumstances 
of the TonkinAWO?fd-iti 43bl-414164Se-11)0 
prior raids by ,e?outa ldjetnarnese forces 
_against North Vietnamese territory,, were_ 
By Richard iirwoocI 
? 
reported accurately at the time. The pos-
sibi1itie:,1 of U.S. air raids on North Vietnam 
were reported and discussed in the press 
repeatedly far in advance of the event. U.S. 
casualty lists and the new funerals at'Ar-
lington National Cemetery received increas-
ing prominence in the news as the war 
revved up in 1964. 
"Today," one of our correspondents wrote 
? in February, 1964, "there are 15,500 military 
personnel in South Vietnam; some 275 Amer-
icans have died, about 100 of them in com-
bat, but there has been no outcry what-
soever at home for pulling out our, troops. 
"rhis attitude, one hopes, is an expression 
of maturing American opinion, of a willing-
ness to face pp to wars that are neither 
'won' nor 'lost'; to accept the fact that the 
,Korean War was the first of what probably 
will be a host of 'mean, frustrating and-
uerve-wracking wars,' the term Secretary 
of State Dean Rusk applied last April to ? 
the Is,trug,gle in South Vietnam." 
c?-f-E3 
FOLLOWING the Gulf of Tonkin 
inci-
dents Time Times editoralize.d: "United 
States determination to assure the inde-
pendence of South Vietnarin if ever doubt-
ed before, cannot be doubted now by the 
Communists to the north or their .allies." 
A few days later The Times said: 'rho 
Americans went into Vietnam in 1954 to 
fill the vacuum left by the French and to 
contain the advance of communism in that 
part of Southeast Asia. The motives are 
exemplary and every American ? can be 
proud of them, but the crucial questions 
are: Can it be. done? . . Is this war neces-
sary?" 
These readings of "mature" and "united" 
American opinion toward the war were 
probably wrong. What the evidence from 
that time suggests is that despite, the pre-
occupation of the newspapers and of the ? 
government with Vietnam, the public was 
both ill-informed and not greatly interested. 
The Gallup Poll in May, 1964, reported that 
63 per cent of the American people had no 
opinion about the war or how it was going 
or what the United States should do. .The 
reason for that, Gallup explained, was that 
this 63 per cent were paying no attention to 
developments in Southeast Asia; neither the 
newspapers nor the government had gotten 
their attention. Six months later, when the 
war fever in Washington and in the press 
was rising, the Council on Foreign Relations 
reported the results of another poll, One 
in four adult Americans, the council found, 
was not even aware that, a war was going on

"There is -always a team

Staging area for the oper-.

According to sources close

thrown into a 12 by 12 by 12

ments. They were eventual-
ly executed. 
Like most CIA operations 
in Laos, the one out of Nam 
Lieu is directed from a 
headquarters at Udorn Air 
Base in northeastern Thai-
land. There are sever al 
Americans at Nam Lieu, 
however, including CIA and 
military intelligence person-
nel. Source close to the CIA 
report the number has in-
creased recently from 4 to 
more than 10. 
In addition to activities in-
side China, the Nam Lieu 
Americans also help direct 
a joint operation of "SGU" 
(Special Guerilla Units) and. 
the Thai army at Xieng 
Lem south of Houtei Sat on 
the Lao-Thai border. They 
also run intelligence gather-
- Ing missions, on a road 
being built by the Chinese

agreement reached with the 
now defunct coalition gov-

same .vicinity. ' 
UNTIL MID-SEPTEM-
BER of last year, the Nam 
Lieu, operation was headed 
by a tough-and-tumble vet-
er an guerrilla organizer ' 
named Anthony. (Tony) Poe. 
-Poe is a legendary figure in 
Laos known best for his dis-
like of journalists, disregard 
for orders and radio codes, 
capacity for Lao whisky and

guerrilla operations. 
Poe was removed almost 
.immediately after an article 
last - September by Dispatch 
News Service International 
on the Nam Lieu operations, ? 
ostensibly because the arti-! 
de "blew his cover." Ac-
cording to sources close to 
the CIA, however, this rea-:. 
son was an 'excuse used by 
the Am eric a nEmbassy 
here to get rid of Poe; 
whose dashing style has 
been a source of long-term 
,friction with members of the 
American Mission in Laos, 
including A in bassador 
McMurtrie Godley. 
As for the missions into 
China, howeve r, sources 
close to the CIA and West-

'report that to their know-
ledge they continue. 
Since leaving Nam Lieu 
? Poe bas spent most of his 
.time at Udorn Air Base, al-
though one source reports 
Poe continues to do "odd 
jobs" on the Thai-Cambodi-
an ? border. Those who know 
him say he is unhappy away 
from Nam Lieu. 
POE - IS AN ex-Marine 
noncommissioned officer, 
wounded at Iwo Jima, who 
remained in Asia after 
,World War II. In the 1950s 
he helped organize CIA-
,rained Tibetan insurgents,

He is said to prefer working 
with hill tribes to working 
with Americans and looks

e Ing to allow Congress to exercise in-
creased control over certain Central 
Intelligence Agenpy?CIA?and Defense 
Department programs. 
My purpose is to place some outside 
control on what has been the freewheel-
ing operation of the executive branch in 
carrying on foreign policy and even wag-
ing foreign wars. 
? To be perfectly honest, our system has 
gotten out of whack, and it is time to 
restore a better balance. 
The Constitution does not give the 
President authority to declare a secret 
war, and I do not accept that there are 
any precedents in our history 'which

Moreover, our recent history in South- issued by several Presidents. I simp y

may well be not only unconstitutional, making role abroad. Certainly this was 
but relatively unsuccessful; too. not the intent of Congress when itSTATINTL 
originally voted to establish CIA. 
. So I come to my three proposals to 
limit the Executive's authority to wage 
asSecret war. These are not all-inclusive, 
but they are an attempt -to get at the 
questions of the circumvention of con-
gressional intent and the hiring of mer-
cenaries. The specific proposals are: 
First, a bill to extend the limitations 
which now apply to. the use by the De-
fense Department of its funds overseas to 
all U.S. Government agencies, including 
CIA. This would prevent the circumven-
tion of congressional intent in the fund-
ing of activities such as the Thai troops 
in Laos through CIA rather than through 
more open Government agencies. It - 
would also eliminate the possiblity that 
the Cooper-Church prohibitions against 
the use of American troops or advisers 
in Cambodia could -he skirted by using 
CIA personnel. 
Second, a bill to prohibit the funding 
by any U.S. Government agency of mili-
tary operations by any country outside its 
borders without specific congressional 
authorization. This would eliminate the 
confusing trail of Thais in Laos. Cam-
bodians in Laos, and even Thais in Cam- ? 
bodia. It would not affect the present 
programs for U.S. payments to Koreans, 
Thais, and Filipinos in Vietnam, since 
Congress has specifically voted money 
for these troops. My bill would, how-
ever, require the administration to in-
form the Congress., on a confidential 
basis, if necessary, of the details of any ? 
argreements with foreign governments to. 
finance their military operations abroad. 
I would hope this would prevent our Gov-
' ernment ? from offering lavish induce-
ments to foreign governments in return 
for the use of -their troops. As you may 
remember, it was revealed last year 
that the U.S. Government in sonic cases 
had been secretly- paying Koreans and

Like most Americans, I was shocked 
by the cynical manipulation of our po-
litical processes revealed in the New York 
Times' account of the McNamara study 
on the origins of the Vietnam war. I 
believe that our country should not go to 
War as part of- a carefully plotted sce-
nario which involves secret attacks on 
the other side?some apparently with 
the aim of provoking retaliation against 
us and our allies. This approach has no 
place in our open society. ? 
I do not want to get into an extended 
postmortem on Vietnam,- however. Our 
primary task Should not be to engage in 
recriminations or assign blame, but to 
bring the war to an end. That is why, 
last year and earlier this week, I voted 
for the Ilatfield-McGovern proposal to 
set a definite date for U.S.. withdrawal 
from Vietnam. 
The Vietnam- war, at least during the 
last several years, has been waged essen-
tially in the open. The same cannot be 
said for the war in neighboring Laos. A 
top American diplomat was quoted re--
cently by the Washington Star saying: 
What we are doing here in Laos is totally 
inconsistent with our kind of society. We are 
fighting a war by covert means and an open 
society cannot tolerate that. 
I agree with this diplomat's appraisal 
and consequently I have done everything 
I can to bring the facts on the war in 
Laos before the American public. 
For example, I stated several weeks 
ago that there apparently was an agree-
ment between the U.S. and Thai Gov, 
ernments for the financing and support 
through CIA of thousands of Thai troops 
in Laos. Only when the administration 
became aware of my speech did the Sen-
ate receive any kind of explanation of 
what was going on. And the explanation 
was incomplete and partially inaccurate 
despite its secret classification which

ing "paramilitary" opertions or 
hiring foreign mercenaries to 
fight in Vietnam, Cambodia, 
Laos and Thailand.. 
. Washington, June 19?Senator 
Clifford P. Case (R., N.J.) an-
nounced today that he. intends to 
'Introduce legislation to prevent 
the CIA from secretly engaging 
in military operations. - 
The legislation will be drafted I 
as amendments to the foreign 
aid authorization bill, which is 
expected to reach the Senate I 
floor next month. The series of 
amendments would: 
1. Extend congressional re-
strictions on the use of Defense , 
Department funds overseas to 
all government agencies, includ- ' 
ing the CIA. 
Specific Authorization 
2. Prohibit any U.S. govern-
ment agency from financing 
military operations abroad with-
out specific congreSsional au-
thorization. 
3. Extend the existing limita-
tions on the. use by the Defense 
Department of surplus arms to 
all government agencies. 
-Mr. Case said he did not be-
lieve his proposal would com-
pletely cut off the executive 
branch's ability to wage secret 
wars, but said he was approach-
ing the matter "piecemeal" be-
cause he did not believe Con-
gress was ready to pass more 
comprehensive legislation. 
- The reluctance of Congress to 
assert its full authority was de-
monstrated, he said, by ?the 'de-
feat in both houses earlier this 
week of legislation to impose a 
deadline for total withdrawal of. 
forces from Indochina. 
? Representative F. Edward He-
bert (11, La.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Commit-
tee, 
opposed the amendment, 
saying its enactment would be 
"very dangerous to the security 
of our country." 
Mr. Hebert, as chairman of 
the Armed Services Committee, 
is one of a handful of congress-
men who have access to infor-
mation pertaining to the CIA. 
While all CIA operations are 
officially secret, there have 
been numerous newspaper re-
ports as well as statements by 
congressmen and senators on 
the agency's operations in South-
east Asia. 
The most publicized activity 
of the CIA has been its opera-
tions in Laos, where the agency 
reportedly has equipped and 
trained a secret army of Meo 
tribesme nand now is supporting 
Thai mercenaries. to fight there. 
Without disclosing. his sources, 
Mr. Case also suggested that the 
, CIA is financing Cambodian 
troops in Laos as well as Thai 
troops in Cambodia. ? 
STATINTL 
tion should be assigned a war-
making role abroad. Certainly. 
this was not the intent or Con-
gress when it originally voted to 
establish the CIA. 
The rationale behind secret 
military and paramilitary oper-
ations is that the United States 
should have some means of mili-
tarily protecting its interests 
abroad, short of engaging in 
open warfare. 
Mr. Case said that while he 
agreed that secret operations 
might in certain instances ba. 
useful he felt they were incom-
patible with "an open system of 
government."

WASHINGTON ? Sen. Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.) charg-
ed yesterday that .the Nixon administration is conducting 
.4 CIA-funded "secret war in Laos," the extent and cost 
of which is unknown to Congress and the American public 
- 
7. The Senator made the charge while announcing plans to 
Introduce three bills to "limit the executive's authority to 
wage a secret war" overseas without congressional 
e. approval. 
One bill would extend .to Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) activities similar, requirements of congressional 
approval that now exist for Defense Department spending 
:overseas. 
TheSecond bill, a broader version of the first, would ' 
:prohibit funding by an U.S. government agency of. the 
military operations of a foreign nation- without. congres-
sional approval. 
- A third proposed bill would extend to all government ? 
.agencies present limitations on the use of surplus mill-. 
tary material by. the Defense Department. 
:% Case made the announcements in a brief. speech before' 
a meeting of the New Jersey Press Association at Spring 
lake. 
? As. A Preventative 
He said he hopes his bills will "prevent our government 
From offering lavish inducements to foreign, governments 
tfor the use of their troops" as mercenaries. 
;In a? speech on the Senate floor May 20, Case said that 
the CIA is currently paying for the military operations of 
silaout 4,000-6,000 troops from Thailand operating in Laos. 
In the same speech, which focused national attention on 
:U.S. policy .of funding Asian mercenaries, Case said CIA 
'operations in Laos are a "Widening of American involve- ? 
Inent in Southeast Asia" and are a violation of the . 
.Cooper-Church Ameridment. 
oThe briefing, Case said Saturday, s as ncomp 
and partially inaccurate, despite its secret classification 
which prevented it from, being made known to the., 
public." 
He continued, 'Even -today the government tries to 
maintain a thick veil of secrecy over some of its 
programs in Laos." ? 
The senator told the New Jersey Press audience he was 
."shocked, by the cynical manipulation of our. political 
processes revealed in fhe New York Times account of the _ 
McNamara study of the origins of the Vietnam War." 
He said he believes the United States "should not go to 
war as part of a carefully plotted scenario which involves 
secret attacks on the other side ? some apparently with 
the aim of provoking retaliations _against us and our 
allies. 
The "secret attacks" to which Case referred were the 
August, :1.964, raids on North Vietnamese islands, revealed 
by the Pentagon study to have been executed by South ? 
Vietnam on the orders of U.S. officials in Saigon, 
Tonkin Story 
The raids provoked North Vietnamese attacks on a U.S. 
ship in the gulf of Tonkin, which were used by. the., 
-.Johnson administration as a rationale for requesting. the 
carte blanche powers that Congress extended in the Gulf 
of Tonkin resolution. ? 
The truthfulness of the government account of the Gulf - 
of Tonkin incident has long been disputed, with many 
- authorities charging that the second of two alleged North 
Vietnamese attacks never occured, but was later fabri-
cated. 
-Case and 97 Senate colleagues, including all the major. 
opponents of the war policy in subsequent years, voted 
for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The .only two negative 
votes were cast by Sen. .Wayne Morse (D-Oregon) and. 
Sen. Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska), who were later defeat-
ed in reelection bids. 
? ' 
:The. Cooper-Church legislation prohibits .U.S. payment.

tolerate such territorial incursions as

In Laos, American officials' mejor 
security concern about the Chinese 
stems from a Peking road-building pro: 
pet in the north. An estimated 14,000 
Chinese personnel, including several 
thousand soldiers standing guard and 
manning ar4i-aircraft batteries, are con-
structing a route leading toward the 
Thai border. 
Thai authorities repeatedly have ex-
pressed deep concern about the road's

The Peking project originally was re-

Ironically, while Amer-jean officials 
fret about Chinese intentions in Laos, 
Peking's new diplomacy has prompted a 
positive reaction from the leader of this 
nation's neutralist government. In a

\..--.AMENDMF.NT OrFERED BY MR. 
M BATALLO - 
.. - r. BADILLO. Mr. Chairman, I offer 
an amendment. 
?-? . The Clerk read as follows: 
Amendment offered by Mr. BADILLO: Page 
. ? .. 7, line 4, before the quotation marks alsert 
the following new sentence: "Nothing in 
clause (A) or (B) of the first sentence of 
? this paragraph or in the immediately pre-
ceding sentence shall be construed to au-
thorize the use of any of such funds by the 
Central Intelligence Agency (or by any 
._ agency or person operating on behalf of 
' the Central Intelligence Agency) to engage, 
- in any manner or to any extent, in the or-
ganization, supervision, or conduct of any 
?. military or paramilitary operation of any 
? kind in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, or Thai-
-? land (Including any operation of the kind 
' commonly called 'guerilla warfare' opera-
, ? ? tion) which?will be executed by forces com-
posed in whole or in part of (i) mercenaries, 
. (ii) regular or irregular personnel of any 
- ,-? armed force of any foreign nation. or area, 
.. or (ill) personnel other than those listed in 
clause (I) or (Ii) who are under arms and 
_ -are indigenous to any foreign country or 
i rea." 
' 
Mr. BADILLO. Mr. Chairman, this is a 
? very specific amendment limiting the 
- ? . activities of the Central Intelligence 
Agency to the gathering of intelligence, 
and specifically prohibiting the Central 
Intelligence Agency from conducting 
guerrilla operations in Southeast Asia. 
. The necessity for the -amendment arises 
- because the enabling act which created 
- the Central Intelligence Agency pro-
vides that the CIA may perform "such 
other functions and ,duties related to in-
telligence and affecting national security 
as the National Security Council may 
from time to time direct." 
There has been clear evidence from 
news accounts over the years, which I 
am sure all of you have read, that the 
Central Intelligence Agency is conduct-
ing guerrilla operations in Laos and 
Cambodia. This last week, as you know, 
the Senate had a secret session involv-
ing our activities in Laos and Senator 
- _SYMINGTON in the CONGRESSIONAL Rae-
Cal) indicated as follows: 
In the case of Laos one is unable to cite 
a figure for the total cost of this war to the 
United States. First, because what the United 
' States is doing, and the cost of what we 
are doing, continues to be cloaked with of-
? ficial - secrecy by the executive branch. 
- Second, one cannot cite a figure for the 
total cost to us of the war in Laos because, 
it must -be said in all frankness, neither 
: you, nor I, nor any Other Member of Con-
gress is in position to know what those 
costs actually are. ? 
Yesterday, my colleague the gentle-
man from California (Mr. WALDIE), 
questioned the chairman of the commit-
tee as to whether this bill specifically 
-.included funds for the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, and the chairman an-
e ? swered that it does. The chairman also 
refused to say what the amounts were. 
. and said that only he and the ranking 
. -minority member of the committee knew. 
? The gentleman from California Mr. 
WALDIE) also asked the charmain as fol-
lows: 
What is the purpose of the CIA activity 
in Laos? 
The chairman answered as follows: 
. Mr. HEBERT. The activity of the CIA in 
East and everywhere is the gathering of In-
telligence for the protection and security of 
the United States. 
- If that is the understanding Of the 
activities of the CIA by the chairman, 
then he should be in aupport, of this 
amendment, because all I am saying is 
that that should be precisely the activity 
of the Central Intelligence Agency, to 
gather information, and not to engage 
In guerrilla activities. But because we 
do not know exactly what funds are 
available either in this body or in the 
Senate, and we do not know exactly to 
what purpose they are being put, this 
amendment is prepared so that we can 
be sure that the activities are limited. 
I seek only to insure that the activities 
of the Central Intelligence Agency be 
limited to those specified in the law, 
and that is to the gathering of intelli-
gence. Certainly after the recent disclos-
ures it becomes all the more important 
that we insure that the agencies of the 
executive department comply with the 
mandates of the Congres.s.. ? 
Even before the New York Times pub-
lished parts of the Pentagon study of. our 
involvement in the Vietnam war, it had 
become apparent that the CIA had liter-
ally been running the entire military op-
eration in Laos, including the hiring, 
training, and leading of a mercenary 
army of Thais and Meo tribesmen and 
the tactical control of an air war which 
has made the Laotian people refugees in 
their own land. ?. , . 
As early as 196,1, the CIA recruited 
Thai pilots to fly planes with markings 
of the Royal Laotian Government 
against Communist forces hi Laos and 
there is evidence these Thai pilots are 
still flying missions in Laos, under CIA 
control and supervision. Reliable esti-
mates given recently to the Senate indi-
cate that the CIA currently is -paying 
about 5,000 Thais to fight in Laos. 
Enactment of this amendment is neC-
cessary if Congress is to regain some 
measure of meaningful control and over 
sight in the field of foreign affairs. Re-
gardless of how individual Members 
might feel about the recent articles in 
the New York Times, it is clear that the 
nature and extent of our involvement in 
Southeast Asia has repeatedly been hid-
den from and misrepresented to the 
American people and their elected Re-
presentatives. I strongly suspect that the 
pattern of subterfuge and outright mis-
representation continues. This amend-
ment represents a step toward squaring 
with the American people. I urge its 
adoption. 
- Mr. LEGGETT, Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield for a question? 
Mr. BADILLO. I yield to the gentleman 
from Calif ornia. 
Mr. LEGGETT. Would the amendment 
preclude the CIA from supporting such 
things as have been reported in national 
magazines, such as the pay for person-
nel in the Saigon Police Force, which 
police force is being used, of course, for 
campaign purposes to support the Thieu 
government in Southeast Asia? 
Mr. BADILLO. Yes it would, because 
it would seek to limit the Central Intel-
ligence Agency to the gathering of Intel-
61/AIINIL 
by the Congress. Specifically it exclude:3.MM, 
the support of activities commonly called 
guerrilla warfare, support of Merce-
naries; support of regular or irregular 
personnel of any armed forces of any 
foreign nation or area within Southeast 
Asia. 
Mr. CO-NYE,RS. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield? - 
Mr. BADILLO. I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. CONYERS. I want to commend the 
precision with which the gentleman has 
formulated this amendment.. I believe it 
is an exceedingly, important one. I ap-
plaud his courage and support him. 
Mr. BADILLO. I thank the gentleman 
very much. 
(Mr. BADILLO asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The gentleman's amendment seeks to 
place a restriction upon the use of any 
funds authorized in this proposed act for 
military or paramilitary operations in 
Southeast Asia organized or supervised 
by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
ThraeCentral Intelligence Agency was 
established by the National Security Act. 
It functions under the National Security 
Council under the President of the Unit-
ed States. It initiates no activities of 
its own without direction from the Presi-
dent and/or the National Security Coun-
cil. 
I do not propose to debate on the floor 
of the I-louse the activities or functions 
of the Central Intelligence Agency. I 
will state categorically that the intelli-
gence activities conducted by our Gov-
ernment are essential to the security of 
this Nation. 
The amendment offered by the gentle-
man from New York, as I read it, seeks 
to prohibit the Central Intelligence 
Agency from organizing, supervising, or 
conducting any so-called military or 
paramilitary operation of any kind in 
Southeast Asia which would be executed 
by mercenaries, regular or irregular per-
sonnel of any armed force of any foreign 
nation or area, or any other personnel of 
a foreign nation. I will not go into the 
ramifications of such a restriction should. 
it-be enacted. I will merely tell the House 
-that in my opinion, as well meaning as 
this amendment may be, it is very dan-
gerous to the security of our country. 
Secrecy is one of the prices we must pay 
for survival. Today, there seems to be a 
penchant for exposing Government 
secrets which wittingly or unwittingly 
give aid and comfort to the enemy. 
The amendment offered by the gentle-
man from -New York would seriously 
restrict our intelligence activities in 
Southeast- Asia and would certainly most 
seriously affect, and perhaps even pre- - 
vent, the further withdrawal of U.S. 
troops from Vietnam. 
I am not going to expand upon my 
statement any further. 
I urge the House to overwhelmingly 
defeat this a,mendment. 
Mr. WALDIE. Mr. Chairman, I move to 
strike the requisite number of words. .

In the end, millions of Americans go with-
out adequate medical care. They cannot af-
ford it. The' are afraid it will break them. 
Or they cannot find a doctor. Sonic of them 
die. Others are left destitute_ And most 
of them fall victim to needless pain and need-
less suffering. They are your parents or 
mine?your children or mine?our friends 
and our fellow citizens. 
The disaster we call medical services makes 
most Americans forgotten Americans. It be-
trays each of them and all of us. Our system 
of medical care is in fact a system of medi-
cal neglect. It is in the deepest sense un-
American. 
? Despite our power and our strength, de-
spite our trillion dollar G.N.P., we have let 
young people die before their time and old 
people die when there was some precious 
time left. How will history judge us, a coun-
try which was first in the wealth of its re-
sources, but far from first in the health of 
its people? And more importantly, how will 
we judge ourselves in those quiet, inner mo-
ments, when we remember that what finally 
counts is not how much we have, but what 
we are? 
It is time for us to do more until we have 
done enough to sustain and enhance the 
health of our nation. 
Countless medical students and some doc-
tors have already answered the call to a new 
kind of service, In the early 1990s, student 
health organizations from Los Angeles to 
Boston pioneered concepts for comprehen-
sive health care. In the summer of 1967, stu-
dents like you joined together in New York 
City to found the student health project of 
the South Bronx. Their historic initiative 
was a sign of a new generation's determina-
tion to make medicine work for people. 
'But the young and the concerned in the 
the medical profession cannot do the whole 
job alone. Your voice-s have been heard?and 
sometimes even heeded. But your own efforts 
will take too long. And the results will be 
too uncertain. The only certainty is that en-
trenched and established forces will oppose 
you every step of the way. We cannot wait 
or gamble on the outcome. Human life and 
human health hang in the balance. 
Four decades after organized medicine al-
most adopted a report favoring uniform fi-
nancing for medical services?four decades 
and a hundred million illnesses too late?
we must enact a medical bill of rights for 
all Americans. The Constitution commits our 
country to .protect political freedom. Now, 
by legislation, the Congress must commit 
America to protect the physical health which 
alone makes possible the exercise of liberty. 
The first medical right of all Americans is 
care within their means. Admission to a hos-
pital or a doctor's office should depend on 
the state of an individual's health, not the 
size of his wallet. And we cannot depend on 
reform on half-way measures and half-
hearted compromise. A right to medical care 
.which left the burden of cost on the poor 
and the near poor would mock its own pur-
pose. The only sure security is federally 
funded universal health insurance. That Is 
our best hope for the future?and a pri-
ority' goal in 1971. 
We must take the dollar sign out of medi-
cal care. We must destroy the financial bar-
rier between deprived 'people and essential 
medical services. We must end the terrible 
choice so many Americans face between los-
ing their health and losing their savings. 
The second medical right of all Americans 
Is care within their reach. Even if we guar-
anteed the payment of health costs, millions 
of our citizens could not find sufficient medi-
cal services. The system is not only inequit-
able?it is also undermanned and inefficient. 
It is on the verge of collapse. The Nation must 
now respond with Federal financial incen-
tives that will Insure real reform. 
? 
There are not enough doctors. I3u.t Federal 
Incentives can persuade medical schools to 
follow Einstein's lead and expand their en-
rollment. New schools can be created and 
sustained by Federal loans and grants. And 
Federal funds must also be provided to help 
medical students who should have something 
better than money to worry about. A pro-
gram of scholarship aid must include all who 
are in need?and it must encourage minority 
students who intend to return to the old 
neighborhoods. - 
Yet the number of doctors is not the 
whole answer. If we produce 50,000 additional 
physicians and plug them Into the current 
structure, our efforts for reform will certainly 
'fail. Some of the health manpower legislation 
now before the Congress would do just that--
and the result would be too many more doc-
tors serving too few people at too high a cost. 
Here, too, Congress must set up financial 
incentives that can move medicine in a new 
direction. We must encourage a shift from a 
system dependent on the individual doctor 
to a system built around the concept of the 
health team, composed of primary care phy-
sicians and other medical professionals. 
Teams would allow us to allocate medical re-
sources with maximum efficiency and to 
maximum effect. They would employ para-
professionals to relieve nurses and doctors 
from routine, time-consuming tasks. They 
would gather together diverse skills?from 
internists to pediatricians?and patients 
would deal with the team, not just a single 
physician. Einstein has experimented with 
the health team concept. The Federal Gov-
ernment must make Einstein's experiment 
national policy. 
And health teams must be sufficient in dis-
tribution as well as in number. Federal. 
bonuses must make it worthwhile to prac-
tice in the inner city and in rural America. 
Medical care cannot reach people unless peo-
ple can reach doctors. And people must have 
more than geographic reach. A health team 
should also be subject to the reach of loca 
influence. 
Location incentives for health service 
must be designed to create responsive, per-
sonal structures'. It was never right?and 
it is no longer possible?to satisfy Americans 
with distant, impersonal medical care. The 
system must respect everyone's identity?: 
and sacriffice no one's dignity. And we must 
always remember that it is easier for a 
patient to reach a health team that he - 
knows?than a shining new medical center 
walled off from surrounding rural poverty or 
a nearby urban ghetto. 
The third medical right of all Americans 
is care with,in their needs. The present 
health insurance system is heavily biased 
toward high-cost hospital treatment and 
against preventive health care. That is in-
credibly expensive--amid incredibly insensi-
tive to the real needs of people. It has filled 
hospitals with patients who should not be 
there and would be better off elsewhere. A 
new national health program must reverse 
the old priorities. It must guarantee a ranee 
of medical services, comprehensive in scope, 
preventive in emphasis, and restricted_ only 
by the scope of scientific knowledge. 
America's concern_ over the quality of 
health care has reached a high water mark 
in 1971. You are graduating from medical 
school at a time when the whole medical 
profession may be profoundly altered. You 
should welcome change?and work for 
change. Only in the context of a medical bill 
of rights for every American, can each of you 
truly and in the most literal sense profess 
your profession--which is nothing more and 
nothing less than the protection of human 
life. 
And that requires not just a medical bill 
of rights, but a social bill Of rights. The real 
cure for lead poisoning is not hospital care, 
but decent housing. The most effective treat-
ment for malnutrition is adequate food. 
And the besf guarantee of good health is a 
physically and emotionally health environ-
ment. 
As health professionals, you must commit - 
yourselves to total health care. And total ' 
care Includes virtually everything that de-STATINTI 
termines whether we are sick or well. You 
cannot confine -yourselves to the technical 
skills you have learned here. You must also 
practice the fundamental human concern of 
a school like Einstein. 
You must speak out for a fair arid sensible - 
medical care system. 
You must stand up for social progress and 
for people--whether they are your patients 
or migrant workers two thousand miles away. 
You can cure individuals--and you must 
help America build a compassionate society. 
It will take time. There will be setbacks 
ad frustrations and defeats. But men and 
women who come from Einstein have good 
reason to believe that we can finally fashion 
a country that is great enough to be good. --
You have seen in your own lives what a dif-
ference one school can make. Now all of you 
have a chance to make a real difference in - 
the lives of others. 
The practice you choose and the practices 
you follow may not change our country over-
night. But you can remind' us by example of 
Aristotle's ancient truth: "Health of mind 
and body is so fundamental to the good life 
that if we believe men have any personal 
rights at all as 'human beings, they have an 
absolute moral right to the measure of good 
health that society is able to give them." 
That is our challenge and our chance. Two 
thousand years after Aristotle wrote, we must 
secure a medical bill of rights for our own 
people. We can wait no longer--in health care 
or in society. In our individual lives and in 
our national life, whatever we can do, and 
whatever we dream we can do, we must begin 
now. 
THE CIA FIGHTS ILLEGAL DRUG 
TRAFFIC 
Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, earlier 
this year I had the pleasure of addressing 
an ROTC group who was in the audience, 
questioned me in regard to certain 'alle-
gations made in Ramparts magazine that 
the Central Intelligence Agency encour-
aged the opium traffickers of Indochina. 
I doubt that such allegations have been 
given credence by many Americans, but 
apparently Mr. Ginsberg either believed 
them to be true, or chose to pretend that 
he believed them. But because I do not 
take such serious charges against our 
Government lightly, and believe that 
none of us should allow unjust criticism 
of our Government to stand - 
lenged, I recently asked the Bureau of ? 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to set 
the record straight on these accusations. - 
Bureau Director John Ingersoll replied' 
this week, -and his remarks are timely in 
view of the major initiatives President 
Nixon is expected to announce today to 
help deal with the illegal -drug problem. 
Mr. President, Mr. Ingersoll has re-
ported to me that the CIA is his Bureau's 
strongest ally in identifying foreign 
sources and routes of illegal trade in 
narcotics. I ask unanimous consent that 
his letter of June 15 be printed, in the 
RECOltD, followed by a report on recent 
trends in the illicit narcotics market in 
Southeast Asia, and my telegram of 
May 11 which was printed in the final 
spring semester edition of the University 
of "Wyoming student newspaper, the 
Branding Iron. . _

Central Intelligence Agency in tins bill? 
Mr. HEBERT. No, sir, it is not. The

of not discussing the matter further. 
Mr. WALDIE. So whatever those sums 
are and, to whatever purpose they will 
be put, that is' only known to the chair-.

Mr. IIfilBERT. It is known to the chair-

of the committee. This is a policy which 
_ has prevailed throughout the years in all

Mr. WALDIE. *S.'es. Mr. Chairman, I

other member of the committee knows 
that information: . . - 
. Mr. 1-T11113EilT. That is correct.. 
Mr. WALDIE. May I ask this question? 
In title IV there is a prohibition against 
using any of the moneys appropriated in 
this bill for the payment of free world . 
' forces serving in Laos. Are there any 
funds being appropriated by this bill for 
the payment of any forces in Laos? 
_ Mr. IIft',ERT. No, there is not any 
? provision for the payment of those forces. 
The only moneys that are involved in 
this bill are those providing for the in-
telligence -agencies of this country. 
, May I make a further correction, I do 
not want to mislead anybody by saying 
that the chairman and the ranking 
Minority member know about these 
funds and only them, because the entire 
committee is briefed by the CIA on its 
functions. So I do not want to have that 
misconception carried away that the 
Members of the committee do not know 
of the activities of the CIA and of the 
other intelligence agencies, this we do 
know. This year, for the first time in the 
history of the committee, at the chair-
? man's request, the CIA was invited to 
7 appear before the entire committee. Its 
- . director, Mr. Helms, appeared and sub-
jected himself to all kinds of questions

the director, Mr. Helms. ? 
Mr. WALDIE. May I ask the chairman

one final question? . 
What is the purpose of the CIA activity 
111Laos? .

? Mr. Ilki:IERT. The activity of the CIA

Apprillill.2000/05/15 : C 
STAT I NT L ?CONG111SSIONAL 
sion of the McGovern-Hatfield amend-
ment. Since I fear there may have 1..;e2-11 
a considerable amount of high-paessure, 
oversimplific.ation of this .problem, 
I believe the following editorial in the 
Washington Post is illuminating: 
coNssass VOMS ON THE WAR 
The McGovern-Hattleld and Nedzi-Whalen 
amendments, v.-hich are to be voted on today 
in the Senate and House respectively, would 
not "end the war" or automatically retrieve 
the American POW's or guarantee the safe 
exit of American forces or, least of all, as-
sure a Vietnamese reconciliation. Any such 
claim promises more than either amendment 
can deliver and invites further frustration 
and disillusionment. Not only does fulfil-
ment of claims like these lie to a great extent 
In other than American hands. But the Amer-
ican system of Government gives the Presi-
dent broad authority to conduct a war. It is 
Idle to pee tent while the fighting goes on that 
Congress can remove that authority; in fact, 
McGovern-Hatfield explicitly concedes the 
point. 
So it is misleading the public to talk of 
these proposed congressional ? restraints' in 
terms of a "date certain" for our withdrawal, 
however comforting and convenient that 
piece of shorthand may be to supporters of 
both measures; Vietnam has given us enough 
deceptive shorthand, and also enough easy?
and offensive?sales pitches-- 
- 
My colleagues, as you-are well aware, I 
voted in favor of fixing December 31, 
1971, as the date for withdrawal of all 
U.S. troops from Southeast Asia. I have 
voted three times this year to end the 
draft on June 30, 1971, in the belief that 
if wars in Southeast Asia can be fought 
with volunteers, they Will prove they have 
the popular support of the American peo-
ple. If they cannot, and I would assume 
this one cannot be fought with volun-
teers since 80 percent of combat troops 
are draftees, then the President could 
come to Congress and ask us for troops 
a-nd prove his justification for the request. 
Then we could restore to Congress a 
meaningful voice in foreign-policy. 
? However, since a majority of this Con-
gress sees fit to draft our young men and 
ship them halfway around the world to 
fight 10,000 miles from home, I find it 
diflicult to vote against funds to provide 
them with supplies, equipment, arms and 
ammunition they need to defend them-
selves and our country's position, even 
though we might not have selected their 
mission in Southeast Asia. As one who 
served in the combat infantry in Werld 
War II, would consider it irresponsible 
to send a draftee into a combat zone 
Without providing him with all the sup-
port those fortunate enough to stay at 
home can provide. 
' Therefore Mr. Chairman, I must op-
pose the Nedai-Whalen amendment. - 
Mr. NEDZI. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield? 
, Mr. IITINGATE. I yield to the gentle-

Mr. NEDZI. Did the Washington Post 
editorial recommend voting for or

'The. amendments as written are by and

and a wise President would welcome them 
as reinforcement of his own policy and his 
own concern for the Nation. 
Mr. HUNGATE. I appreciate the gen-

?Of the request, Si 20 million is said to be ea, ??-. ed for 
funding CIA operations in Northern Laos, including the use of

? ?A major issue in the secret debate centered upon whether the 
;use of Thai forces Was in contravention of the 1970 Fulbright 
amendment to the 1971 Defense Appropriations Act, signed into 
Jaw by President Nixon Jan. 11 this year. The amendment barred 
? use of Defense Department funds to support what the Pentagon 
calls "free world forces" in actions "designed to provide military'. 
support and assistance to the government of Cambodia or Laos."

Cambodia.". That was also Fulbright's view. State Department ' 
sources later said, according to Rich, "that the Thais being used 
aren't recruited on a government-to-government basis, but were 
individuals recruited from the borderside Thai population." 
The Post report obviously left out many details of. the Senate

In April of this year, Prince. Souphanouvong, head of the Lao 
Patriotic Front (Pathet Lao), charged that the number of Thai 
troops was being augmented by the U.S. Shortly after this, 
George W. Ashworth reported in the April 17 Christian Science.. 
Monitor: "Nixon administration officials have hammered out an 
agreement with the government of Thailand for sharply increased. 
use of Thai forces in Laos." 
Thai troops were previously used in the ill-fated U.S.-backed 
attempt to hold the Plain of Jars, which ended in an important 
Pathet Lao victory in February 1970. Presumably the losses then 
were .an element leading to the more formalized agreement for

gone down, more likely it is up. Confirming this, a Senate source 
has noted that the cost of the mercenaries was high. Symington 
on June 7 referred to both regular and irregular Thai troops:being.

involves freedom for the CIA to recruit directly in Thailand.'" 
Taking all evidence into account, Thai troops in Laos may now 
number 10,000 or higher.

tims by July 1972, with five units already 
In operation capable of treating 200 ad-
dicts each. Yet those dishonorably dis-

treatment. 
? Therefore, I am introdcing today .a bill 
which would authorize the Administrator 
.or Veterans' Affairs to provide care and 
-treatment for ceraain former Members of 
. the Armed Forces addicted to narcotic 
s? drugs. The "certain" members are those 
- who Viere discharged dishonorably, be-
cause of drug addiction. 
I believe it Is importantfor the Armed 
- Forces to assert national leadership in 
Identifying drug abusers, and once recog-
nized, insure that treatment and re-
habilitation are available to all who have 
served their country. This is no less im-
portant for those addicts now serving on 
active- duty who are now receiving treat-
. merit as it is for those who were treated 
punitively in being released dishonorably 
from the Army. Military leadership in 
handling the drug problem would be a 
distinct contribution toward the abate-
' meat of this national tragedy. 
The bill which I am introducing today 
provides the possibility of treatment for 
. thousands who have been sent home with 
an addiction which is all too often sup-
ported by regular 'criminal activity. It 
Is madness to allow the military to return 
' addicts to civilian life and not provide

tacked by the Communists," Pepper said, 
"and we have the right not only to ask but 
to demand that the French take emergency 
action to help us." 
Ingersoll, who recently returned from dis-
cussions with Southeast Asia leaders on the 
heroin problem, said he doubted that any 
policy-making officials of the countries?
Thailand, Laos and South Vietnam?are in-
volved in the illicit drug traffic. 
Burma, Thailand and Laos account for 
about CO percent of the world's opium pro-
duction, he said. 
But he told newsmen after the hearing 
that many lower-lever officials, including 
members of the South Vietnamese Legisla-
ture, deal in opium. He said some legislators 
have friends in President Nguyen Van Thieu's 
cabinet. 
Ingersoll told, the committee that heroin 
refineries were under control of insurgents in 
Burma and Thailand but that those in Laos 
are protected by elements of the royal 
Laotian armed forces. 
RAMPARTS DISCLOSURES 
He said that while management and own-
ership of the Laotian refineries appear to be 
primarily in the hands of ethanic Chinese 
citizens of that nation, l'some reports sug-
gest" that a senior Laotian air force officer 
may have an ownership Interest in some of 
the plants. 
When Rep. Jerome R. Waldie (D-Calif.) 
noted that Ramparts magazine had identi-
fied the official as Gen. Ouane Rathiqoune, 
Ingersoll replied that "general speculation" 
conceded, this. - 
Ingersoll denied, one contention of the 
Ramparts article. It maintained that rem-
nants of Chiang Hai-shek's Kuomintang 
army left in the area are involved in heroin 
production and are in the employ of the CIA 
for operations on the China mainland. 
But Ingersoll conceded that Air America 
planes had been used in the past for smug-
gling heroin?just as regular commercial 
airliners have been used to smuggle It into 
the United States. 
He told newsmen later that 80 .kilograms 
were seized on an Air America plane at the 
huge Tan -Son Hut Air Base outside Saigon 
only three or four weeks ago. - 
During the hearing, Waidie also asked 
Ingersoll about a Ramparts report that the 
secret CIA base of Long Chong, used to sup-
port the U.S.-paid Moo tribesmen, was a dis-
tribution point for heroin to be shipped into 
South Vietnam. 
Ingersoll said he had not heard of that. 
However, he later said he had discussed the 
general illicit drug problem with CIA Direc-
tor Diehard Helms. He said Helms denied the 
CIA was involved in any way, and that he 
believed him. 
"The Mao tribesmen are something else," 
Ingersoll said, "but I don't blame the CIA

Ingersoll said the Saigon government had 
taken several steps to crack down on the

and the appointment of a special task force

A SYMBOLIC FLAG CEREMONY 
HON. FRANK HORTON 
OF NEVI YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
? Tuesday, June 15, 1971. 
Mr. HOR,TON. Mr. Speaker, during 
these times, when, on one hand, the pa-
triotism of seine of our Nation's finest 
leaders is questioned; and when, on the 
other, it is often scorned to be patriotic, 
we must stop to..  consider what, the flag 
and patriotism actually mean. 
Sunday, in Rochester, N.Y., in my con-
gressional district, I attended a flag cere-
mony at the Rochester Polish People's 
Home. It was the first flag raising at the 
home. I would like to share the ceremony 
with my colleagues for it vividly made the 
significance of the flag clear to all who 
attended. 
Mr. Ray GaAs, pre.sident of the home, 
introduced the guests, who represented 
local, county, .State, and Federal legis-
lative bodies, as well as the Polish-Amer-
ican and American Legion Posts. 
Officials included Rochester Mayor 
Stephen May, State Assemblyman Ray-
mond Lill, City Councilman Urban Kress, 
Monroe County Legislators Nicholas San-
taro and Sam Poppick. ? 
County Judge Arthur Curran also at-
tended. Judge Curran was especially 
aware of the value of the flag. He re-
cently received the flag from the coffin 
of his son, a marine, who was killed in 
Japan. 
Also present were James O'Grady, com-
mander of the Michalski Post; Joseph 
Zabuchek, commander of the Pulaski 
Post; Joseph DeMeis, commander of the 
Monroe County American Legion Post; 
and Edmund R. Przysinda, president of

? WASHINGTON ? Secret. studies of U. S: involvement in 
Vietnam have confirmed -- in spades -- the worst suspicions 
anYbody in this town ever voiced about government lying. 
T h e so-called Pentagon papers 
show that the Johnson administration 
? literally talked peace and planned war 
in 1964 ? the year of decision. 
They show that officials led the 
-public deliberately and ?carefully into 
war ? without leliing what they were 
doing, 
They show that U. S. involvement 
in . the war was?planned ? orchestrated 
by U. S. officials over a long period 
of time. 
All this is laid out In meticulous 
detail in ti-e 7,000-page. analysis, ex-
cerpts of which have been made public 
the the New York Times. 
L.r.......  
Barry Coldwater 
?": 'NIOST SKO(..TINC is' the careful documentation of be-
'.hind-the-scenes ? war planning in 1961 while Lyndon Baines 
Johnson was campaigning for re-election as a "peace" candi-
date against Barry Goldwater. 
The studies say that a..!!,E,,eneral consensus" was reached 
at the White Bouse as early as Sept. 7, 1934, that air attack's 
probably would have to be launched against North Vietnam. 
s Yet long after the Sept. 7 meeting ? LBJ was Specifi-
cally disCouraging the notion that the U. S. had any Tian to 
.enlarge the war. ? 
In a campaign speech on Sept. 28 in Manchester, N. II., 
he said: "As far as I am concerned, I want to be very 
-
cautious and careful, and use it (bombing) only as a last 
resort ? when I start dropping bombs around that are likely 
to involve American boys in a war in Asia with seven 
hundred million Chinese. 
"So just for the moment, I have not thought that we were 
ready for American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys." 
THE "SECEET WAR" had been going on for months 
with no '.nnouncement at all to the public. ? 
, A major phase of the "secret ?.var" had begun on Feb. 1, 
1964. The studies describe it as "an elaborate program of 
eovert military operation against the state of North Viet-. 
nam." 
The operation included: 
ATTACKS by 25 to 40 U. S. fighter-bombers in Laos, most 
-
flown by CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) pilots. 
U-2 SPY-PLANE flights over North Vietnam. 
KIDNAPPINGS of North Vietnamese citizens. 
PARACHUTE' DROPS by sabotage and psychological 
warfare teams. 
COMMANDO ,RAIDS to blow up bridges. 
BOMBARDMENT of North Vietnamese coastal installa-
tions from the sea. ? ? 
The Pentagon papers ? prepared three years ago by a 
team of 30 to 40 government officials and vivate histc:lans ? 
say that the war, actually was slowed down so LIU could run 
as a "peace candidate." Officials were agreed on the need of 
military operations', against North Vietnam but held back 
on open action because of the election campaign. 
VIE U. S. ELECTION was considered a "tactical" prob-
lem which prevented the start of bombing in the North.. 
The studies say action was delayed because LBJ "was in
. 
the midst of an election campaign in which he was presenting 
himself as the candidate of reason and.restraint." . 
"Trigger-happy" Barry Goldwater at the time was pub-
licly advocating full-scale bombing of North Vietnam. 
THE STUDIES convey an impression: say the Times, 
"that the war was . . . considered less important for what it 
meant to the South Vietnamese than for what it meant to the 
position of the U. S. in the Nvorld." 
One secret Memo said that 70 pct. of the U. S. objective 
in Vietnam was "to avoid a humiliating U. S. defeat," 20 pct. 
to keep South Vietnam out of .Chinese hands, and 10 pct. to 
bring a better life to the South Vietnamese. 
? The U. S. has consistently taken the public position that it 
wants a negotiated peace in Southeast Asia ? a position still 
taken by the Nixon administration. 
The studies indicate that behind the scenes, officials did 
not want negotiations with the Communists in 1904 and often 
pursued policies deliberately designed to discourage negotia-
tions. ? 
What's the real truth now? ?

Comr.nitillei-it of -Troops by 
Personal latter from Walt W. Rostow,.cltoirinan of the State Department's. 
Polley Planning Council, to Secretary McNamara, Nov. 16, 1964, "Military Dis-
positions and Politica( Signals." 
a, Following on our conversation of last 
night I am concerned that too much 
thought is being given to the actual 
damage we do in the North, not enough 
thought .to the signal .we wish to send. 
The signal consists of three parts: 
aai a) damage to the North is now to be 
inflicted because they are violating the 
1954 and 1962 accords; ? 
b) we are ready and able to go much 
further than our initial act of damage; 
C) we are ready and able to meet any 
level of escalation they might Mount in 
response, if they are so -minded. 
Four points follow. 
? 1.-I am convinced that we should not 
?? go forward into .the next stage without 
a US ground force commitment of some 
;kind: 
a. The withdrawal of those ground 
forces could be a critically important 
apart of our diplomatic bargaining posi-
tion. Ground forces can sit during a con-
ference more easily than we can main-
tain a series of mounting air and naval 
:pressures. 
. . 
b. We must make clear that counter 
? escalation' by. the Communists will run 
directly into US strength on the ground; 
, and, therefore the possibility of radically 
.1y extending their position on the ground 
at the cost of air and naval damage 
?alone, is ruled out. 
c. There is a marginal possibility that 
in attacking the airfield they were think?
'. 
lug two moves ahead; namely, they 
might be planning a pre-emptive ground 
force response to an expected US retali-
ation for the Bien Hoa attack. 
The first critical' military action 
against North Vietnam should be de-
signed merely to install the principle 
? - that they will, from the present forward, without raising seriously the fear in 
.be vulnerable, to rciA06.14,?6416tacfr61. tkei0k#Migitikyl.V. t400101,_. tit46

1954 and 1962 Accords. In bther words, Delta, in 'China, or seek any other ob- their favor in South Vietnam, they might 
we would signal a shift from the prin- jective than the re-installation of the 
sponse. This means that the initial use 
of force in the north should be as lim-
ited and as unsang,minary as possible. It 
'is the installation of the principle that 
we are initially interested in, not tit 
for tat., 
3. But 6ur force dispositions to ac-
company an initial retaliatory move 
against the north should send three 
further signals lucidly: 
a, that we arc putting in place -a' 
capacity subsequently to step up direct 
and naval pressure on the north, if that 
should be required; ? 
' a b. that we are prepared to face down 
'any forni of escalation North Vietnam 
.might mount on the gromid; and 
. . . 
-C. that we are putting forces into 
place to exact retaliation directly against 
Communist China, if Peiping should join 
in an escalatory response from Hanoi. 
The latter could take the, form of in-
creased aircraft on Formosa plus, per-
haps, a carrier force sitting- off China 
?distinguished from the force in the 
South China Sea. 
4. The launching of this track, almost 
certainly, will require the President to 
explain to our own people and to the 
world our intentions and objectives. This 
will also be perhaps the most persuasive 
form of communication with Ho and 
Mao. In addition, I am inclined to think 
the most direct .communication we can 
mount (perhaps via Vientiane and War-
saw) is desirable, as opposed to the use 
of cut-outs. They should feel they now 
confront an MU who has made up his 
mind. Contrary to an anxiety expressed 
at an earlier stage,. I believe it quite 
possible to communicate the limits as 
well as the seriousness of our intentions

I agree almost .completely with SNIE 
10-3-64 of October 9. Here are the criti-

"While they will seek to exploit and 
encourage the deteriorating situation in 
Saigon, they probably will avoid actions 
that would .in their view unduly in-
crease the chances of a major US re-
sponse against North Vietnam (DRV) or 
Communist China. We are almost cer-
tain that both Hanoi and Peiping are 
anxious not to become involved in the 
kind of war in which the great weight 
of superior US weaponry could be 
brought against them. Even if Hanoi and 
Peiping estimated that the US would not 
use nuclear weapons against them, they 
could not be sure of this..... 
"In the face of new US pressures 
against the DRV,, further actions by 
Hanoi and Peiping would be based to a 
;considerable extent on their estimate of 
US intentions, i.e., whether the US was 
actually determined to increase its pres-
sures as necessary. Their estimates on. 
this point are probably uncertain, but 
we believe that fear of provoking severe 
'measures by. the US would lead them to 
temper their responses with a good deal 
of caution. ..., / - 
"If despite Communist efforts, the. US 
attacks continued, I fanors leaders would

Laos might be useful safety valve for 
these generalized- pressures while at 
same time providing some deterrent to 
escalation of hostilities on that part of 
,the "front." We would insist that con,.

that it could in fact be s6 limited, if 
necessary by b ur withdrawing from the

key initial question is of course whether 
Souvanna himself is prepared to drop

Hanoi Spreads Out . 
Despite its proximity to the main 
theater of operations in Indochina, the 
13olovens Plateau in southern Laos long 
remained one of the war zone's most 
tranquil oases. For years, a spirit of ao-
commodation between the highlanders 
and the local Communists kept the lush, 
coffee-rich region comparatively peace-
ful. And even the presence of a few 
bands of U.S.-sponsored guerrillas did 
not drag the plateau into the larger con-
flict. Last month, however, in a series of 
well-coordinated attacks, Communist bat-
talions suddenly swept into the area, 
forcing Laotian units into a hasty retreat 
and taking full command of the plateau. 
And by last week, the North Vietnamese 
were busily carving out storage areas in 
the plateau's deep, dark gullies and 
building new roads that seemed destined 
to become part of the growing Ho Chi 
Mini' Trail network. 
'The effort to expand their north-south 
supply system seemed to be at the root 
of the North Vietnamese thrust. Since 
the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville 
(now Kompong Som) was closed to Com-
munist ships early last year, Hanoi has 
had to rely almost exclusively on trails 
through the Laotian panhandle to supply 
its forces in South Vietnam and Cambo-
dia. And four months ago, the U.S.-sup-
ported South Vietnamese invasion of 
southern Laos placed an added strain on 
Hanoi's narrow logistical pipeline. For 
, although the operation by no means 
succeeded in wiping out the durable 
Ho Chi Minh Trail, it did momentarily 
disrupt the eastern portion of the intri-
cate n etwork? an d sparked apprehension 
in Hanoi that the South Vietnamese 
might come back again and again. 
Rout: Confronted by that fear?and 
the fast-approaching monsoon season?
the North Vietnamese had little alterna-
tive but to expand the trail westward. 
Using firepower and manpower that have 
long been more than a match for even 
the best units of the woefully weak Royal 
Laotian Army, the Communists routed 
some thirteen Laotian battalions that 
/were guarding the approaches to the 
13olovens Plateau. Even the CIA-trained 
Jungle Tiger mercenaries were no match 
for the advancing Communists. In less 
than a day of heavy fighting, the North 
Vietnamese captured the key city of 
Pak Song. They also gained firm control 
over Routes 23 and 16, leading from the 
eastern trails to the Mekong River, and 
over other open roads to the south. 
For the time being at least, few ob-
servers expected the North Viet'namese 
to push any farther. In order to take the 
strategic Mekong River towns of Pakse 
and Savannakhet, the Communists would 
have to fight through stiff Laotian fortifi-
cations?and might risk a tough .reaction 
from the neighboring Thais. And with 
the plateau and the provincial capitals of 
Attopeu and Saravane (both seized last 
year) under North Vietnamese com-
mand, IIanoi seemed to have achieved 
its primary goal: securing reliable supply 
lines to its forces in the south. 
Hot Water: Yet despite the Commu-
nists' apparently limited objectives, the 
latest North Vietnamese thrust has 
caused unusual reverberations in the 
sleepy Laotian capital of Vientiane. Even 
the politically sure-footed Laotian Prime 
Minister, Prince Souvanna Phouma, has 
found himself in hot water. In the wake 
of the fighting, a powerful group of right-

Oversight of CIA Ik Vilal 
MERICANS are fully aware 
1-1- their government, like 
every other nation, has an in-
telligence gathering apparatus 
and while the whole business 
of spying is inherently evil, it 
: is necessary. 
The primary U.S. spy group 
is called the Central Intelli-
gence Agency and it operates 
pretty much in the dark as it 
eeks to provide its own unique 
- 'kind of shield against any 
threat to this nation's security. 
f' Because of the very nature of 
' ? the spy business, the CIA 
-writes its own rules and laws 
and they very well may be in 
conflict with established stat-
utes and mores. 
. - 
EVEN THOUGH the CIA 
-nocessarily must operate in its 
own shadowy sphere, it re-
quires financing. That comes 
from the American taxpayer, 
yet these funds are entirely 
secret, being seeded here and 
-there in various departments of 
the federal budget. 
Congress does attempt to 
'maintain some contact with the 
CIA's doings through a little-
known Senate watchdog sub-
committee established in 1955. 
But thiS panel has met only 
three times in the last two 
years and not once So far in 
? 
1971. 
A RECENT closed door ses-
sion of the entire Senate delved 
into the doings of. the CIA in 
Indochina. It was then re-
waled the CIA, using Amen-, 
can tax money, had been fi-
nancing 4,800 mercenaries 
from Thailand to cross their , 
border and fight Laotian and 
North Vietnam C o in munist 
troops in Laos. 
Sen. Clifford Case of New 
Jersey is incensed by the rev-
elation, contending this activ-
ity is not only a violation of a 
1970 congressional ban against 
such incursions but is an ex-
ample of the CIA "setting ma-
jor policy." 
? THE INCURSION aspect of 
the Thai-Laos operation is 
nothing new on the CIA 
agenda. Witness history's re-
cording of such places as the 
Bay of.Pigs and an earliei. bit 
of action in Guatemala. 
But if the CIA is "setting 
major policy" by its Indochina 
program, then ,Americans are 
faced with a touchy problem. 
It well could be a case Of one 
government agency creating a ' 
new "front" in one part of 
Indochina while the President 
is making a concerted effort to 
extract the American presence 
from another, Vietnam. . 
AN OVERSIGHT of the CIA: 
is necessary. Its secrecy must' 
be protected.. But it cannot be 
permitted to "set policy" while' 
carrying out its intelligence-' 
gathering duties. Policy must 
be established by duly elected 
and appointed officials operat-
ing clearly in the open.

BY MILES BENSON 
Q1971, Newhouse News Service 
Washington?When the Sen-
ate barred its doors, Monday 
and sat down to hear details 
of how the United States was 
financing mercen'ary 'Thai 
.troops fighting in Laos, it was 
..the first most senators had 
.? heard about the operation. 
? But a privileged handful ap-
parently had known all about 
t.it for more than a year. They 
just never had told their col-
leagues. 
This incenses Sen. Clifford 
i P. Case, R-N.J., who 'feels his 
T. colleagues k e op too many 
"major policy" secrets from 
t each other?and from the pub-
lic. 
? Watchdog Panel 
The "insiders" were mem-
hers of a little-lmown subcom-
mittee set up in 1955 to act as 
a watchdog over activities of 
the Central Intelligence Agen-
? ty. The conisinittee has net 
I only three times in the last 
two years. It is the CIA that 
has been financing 4800 Thai 
mercenaries?the State De-
partment calls them "volun-
teers"?in violation of a 1970 
congressional ban, critics con-
tend. 
tThe secrecy surrounding the 
[-operation was defended by 
j Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-
t Wash., who argues that if all 
; the other senators knew of it, 
tit would not have been a se-
i?cret.. 
I But Case insists such a ma-
jor policy move should be 
public business. 
Burying Information . 
Case 'challenges the useful-
--ness of the CIA commiittee, 
saying that it "serves as a 
means for burying informa-
tion rather than bringing it 
out into the open." 
? 
And it'd .no-t just the CIA 
committee, Case contends, 
that is guilty of such "institu-
tionalized secrecy." Another 
. special panel operating the 
same way, he charges, is the 
Joint Committee on Atomic 
. Energy. 
" "Sen. Stuart Symington, D-
Mo., for instance, never knew 
anything about the location of 
' missiles around the world un-
til he got on that committee, 
and he was startled by the in-
formation he got," Case de-
clared. 
The AEC committee is giv-
en access to classified infor-
mation on the location and 
power of nuclear warheads 
the United States keeps at the 
: ready around the world. . 
? - 
"The point is that informa-
tion on major policy ought to 
be public information," Case 
said. "And the public's- partic-
ipation in these matters, 
through their representatives 
in Congress, is the real goal 
i? we are seeking." 
Prior to the closed Senate 
session on Laos, Case doubted. 
1 that even the CIA oversight 
! commitee had been informed 
of the mercenary operations. 
Case's criticism of the CIA 
:?and AEC committees is count-
ered by Jackson, who served 
on both panels: Ile says they; 
-work so well that he wants 
another one set up to oversee: 
the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, a Proposal he has been 
quietly pushing: 
"These committees were set 
, up on the theory that certain 
; Sensitive things should be on a 
'need-to-know' basis," he said.. 
. "If you let everybody know, . 
ther is no longer a secret." 
- 
.1, 
Asked if the CIA committee 
had been informed of the CIA 
support for Thai mercenaries 
in Laos, Jackson replied:, 
"Yes, we were told. They : 
have kept us currently ,in; 
formed," 
The CIA oversight subconi= 
mittee, chaired by Sen. Johti 
Stennis, D-Miss., who also 
heads the p a r eu t Sonat 
Armed Service Committee, 
has yet to meet this year. It , 
last met March 20, 1970. It 
also sat Jan. 30, 1970. In 1960 
j it met only once, on Feb. 21f, 
At each of the three ineetings 
? the only witness was ? CIA. 
Director Richard Helms.' The 
committee met twice in 1958-
? and five times in 1067. ? 
Besides Stennis and Jack"-
son, other members of the 
committee are Symington, Pe 
terII. Dominick, R-Colo., and 
Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ayer'
