 In April 1961, a few days after
 'the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs in-

 American Society of Newspaper

 Given the Cuba intelligence, by

 was pressed to tell: "Just what
 are the sources of the CIA's infor-

 Hanoi and Th
 Cuban specter
 By C. L. Sulzberger
 PARIS----Historians may eventually
 decide the most slgniflcent aspect of
 the Indochina war was that it never
 produced a superpower confrontation
 resembling, the nuclear showdown over
 Cuba just ten years ago.
 It may be arguable that what oc-
 curred in the Caribbean at the end
 of October, 1962, had a profound if
 indirect influence on what was to
 happen in Vietnam during the sub-
 sequent decade.
 Looking back on events that led
 Chairman Khrushchev to the Cuban
 gamble, it is now possible to discern
 his growing overconfidence. After hav-
 ing met Mr. Kennedy in Vienna, lie-
 t:old me the American President im-
 pressed him as being unable to face
 up to the Berlin crisis then festering.
 "Kennedy is too young," he said
 (Sept. 8, 1961). "Ile lacks the author-
 ity and prestige to settle the issue
 correctly. He is afraid to take up that
 position and that is why he has in-
 troduced mobilization measures." Mr.
 Khrushchev gave two clues to his pos-
 sible behavior although I was not
 shrewd enough to realize this.
 He said: "If Cuba were subjected
 to attack, it would have every riflit
 to expect assistance from other peaee-
 loving countries. ... We would cer-
 tainly not ignore a request for assist-
 ance." Ile also indicated exaggerated
 faith in Russia's nuclear arsenal, say-
 ing it was being armed with "several"
 100-megaton warheads of such de-
 structive power as "to make would-be
 aggressors think twice."
 Khrushchev  probably didn't then
 contemplate the possibility that thir-
 teen months later he would have dis-
 patched missiles and nuclear warheads
 secretly  to  Cuba,  S.D.E.C.L.,  the
 French intelligence service, reported
 some clues early in 0?1ober and the
 C.I.A. established overwhelming con-
 firmation through aerial surv-eyance.
 The result is history. Mr. Kennedy
 reacted with calm toughness and sent
 Dean Acheson abroad to alert our
 allies. France's President de Gaulle
 told Acheson it was unnecessary to
 show him photographs of, the Soviet
 missiles "because obviously a great
 Government like yours would not risk
 war for nothing." lie assured Wash-
 irigton of French support.
 Some lesser allies suggested dis-
 mantling U.S. missile bases in Turkey
 to save Mr. Khrushchev's face. Sevy
 oral suspected what Moscow really
 sought was Western abandonment of
 FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 On Nov. 9, 1962, Mr. Kennedy told
 me he was "astonished" at the speed
 with which the Russians managed to
 pull their missiles out of Cuba but
 added that - he couldn't understand
 why Khrushchev had gone there in
 the first place. If he had thought
 America wasn't going. to fight in the
 heart of an area of its own vital
 interest (the President speculated), he
 surely must have assumed we weren't
 going to fight in Berlin. Therefore, he
 asked: "Why didn't lie go straight for
 Berlin?"
 On Nov. 20 the President said in an-
 other conversation that he had learned
 much from the terrible episode. At the
 start "you don't k>,iow whom to believe
 and whom to disbelieve. But I can do
 the job much better now."         ,
 The crisis produced several repercus-
 sions. Mr. Khrushchev sent a message
 to British Prime Minister Macmillan
 saying the West should not try to push
 Russia around on J3lcrlin or make the
 mistake of thinking the. Cuba show-
 down proved Moscow was "soft."
 NATO endorsed President Kennedy's
 desire to increase the Alliance's con-
 ventional strength because Cuba had
 demonstrated that the use of such
 strength in a crisis area could force an
 advesary to be the first to explode
 nuclear weapons and thereby risk
 mas -destruction.
 The Russians vastly accelerated their
 naval building program and began to
 move persistently into the Mediter-
 ranean. This process coincided with
 dismantling of the U.S. missile sites
 in Turkey.
 Washington' promised to take no
 physical action against Cuba's regime
 and this in turn strengthened the hand
 of Latin-American revolutionary move-
 ments for some time to come. De
 Gaulle decided he would never again
 allow France to be drawn into crises
 outside the European area and loosened
 French NATO ties.
 This historical effect of the Cuban
 confrontation on Vietnam was indirect.
 President Kennedy certainly didn't re-
 duce American intervention; he souped
 it up. But the lesson of 1962 wasn't
 lost. Despite U.S. attacks on Hanoi,
 even while Kosygin was there, or
 bombings right up to China, and de-
 sliite the U.S. blockade of Haiphong,
 Moscow and Peking reacted with cal-
 culated calm..
