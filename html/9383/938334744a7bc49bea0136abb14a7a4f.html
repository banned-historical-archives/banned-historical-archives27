 The compromise settlement between the USSR and Czechoslovakia,
 announced in Moscow on 27 August, was at best a Pyrrhic victory for the
 Soviet leaders, and contains the seeds of its own destruction.
 It was gained at the expense of igniting Czechoslovak nationalism and
 uniting the Czechoslovak nation. In Moscow, the collective leadership has
 been put under severe strain.
 The erratic course of Soviet policy on Czechoslovakia has caused
 serious problems for the East German regime both at home and abroad.
 While Ulbricht may have been pleased by Moscow's lightning cannot fail to
 be disappointed by the subsequent halfway measures.
 The early endorsement of the Czechoslovak reforms by Hungary's party
 leader Janos Kadar and his sudden about-face has put him in an awkward
 position. The display of Soviet military force has strengthened Polish party
 boss Gomulka's hand against Polish nationalist elements. The general mood
 in both countries appears to be one of dismay and confusion which may
 escalate when students return to their classes in September.
 The US Embassy in Sofia reports wide but muted Bulgarian disapproval
 of the invasion and of Bulgaria's participation. The Rumanians and Yugo-
 slavs sharply condemned the invasion and are now uttering pious hopes that
 reason will prevail following the settlement in Moscow. The Bucharest
 regime developed a bad case of jitters over fears-now apparently sub-
 siding-that it might be invaded next.
 In Western Europe, the public and official reaction was one of dismay
 and alarm. The sense of disillusionment about the possibilities the appeal of
 NATO and European regional institutions has unquestionably been strength-
 ened.

 INVASION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA LEAVES UNCERTAIN AFTERMATH
 Czechoslovak courage and cool-
 ness in the face of overwhelming
 Soviet force left the question of
 victor and vanquished in doubt even
 in Czechoslovakia where the Soviets
 seemed determined to settle in for
 a relatively lengthy "presence."
 There is no doubt that the pace of
 Czechoslovak liberalization has
 been slowed and that the Soviet
 troops will assure greater compli-
 ance with the Soviet interpretation
 of the Moscow agreement than the
 USSR was able to achieve after the
 earlier Cierna and Bratislava agree-
 ments.
 As one Czechoslovak official
 put it, however,  the last ten days
 have raised Czechoslovak national
 unity to new heights, stirred mas-
 sive anti-Soviet sentiments, and
 thoroughly convinced the people of
 the need for free media--all grounds
 for new conflict between Moscow
 and Prague.
 Whatever the outcome, for Mos-
 cow the losses of prestige around
 the world and the significant state-
 ments of opposition from hereto-
 fore "loyal" Communist parties are
 palpable.   Seldom has the propaganda
 line issuing from Moscow provided
 a thinner cover for its actions,
 and many Soviet officials abroad
 have expressed dismay.   Over time,
 Moscow can probably count on na-
 tional interest reducing the harsh
 feelings now being expressed, and
 some of the Communist parties that
 broke with Moscow probably will also
 edge back into the fold.   With the
 West, and especially with the US,
 the chance of working out mutually
 advantageous agreements has been
 set back.
 Page  3
 Presumably, Moscow took all of
 these things into account when it
 made the decision to invade, but
 decided that the need to halt Czech-
 oslovak liberalization was overrid-
 ing.                                                                       As it turned out, however,
 Moscow took the expected losses with-
 out real assurance that it had
 achieved its main goal.
 The settlement announced in Mos-
 cow on 27 August was at best a Pyrrnic
 victory for the Soviet leaders.   In
 contrast to its well-planned and
 smoothly executed military take-over
 on 20 and 21 August, the USSR does not
 seem to have had any well conceived,
 soundly based political alterna-
 tives.   If the Soviets expected a
 puppet government to form from con-
 servatives and hard liners in the
 regime, they were sadly misled.   In-
 stead, the existing government,
 though missing some members, con-
 tinued to act effectively.   The party
 also did not falter and--with its
 leader, Dubcek, under arrest--con-
 vened its extraordinary 14th Party
 Congress--originally set for 9 Sep-
 tember--on 22 August.
 The Congress elected an acting
 first secretary, a new reformist-
 minded central committee, and a new
 party presidium, with Dubcek, Premier
 Cernik, and President Svoboda named
 as members.  Several other Czechs
 who had been strongly criticized by
 Moscow were also elected, but none
 of those members of the former
 presidium who were considered So-
 viet collaborators.

 the Czechoslovaks in their opposi-
 tion to the occupation, as well as

 the high discipline of the populace
 and the Czechoslovak military forces,
 apparently gave the USSR second
 thoughts about the severe risks of
 provoking active resistance if it
 imposed a narrowly based occupa-
 tion regime.  This behavior on the
 part of the country also provided
 the Czech leadership with some of
 its strength in negotiating with
 the Soviet leaders.
 Out of the stalemate that had
 developed--a total Russian occupa-
 tion and an unbending population
 and government--emerged the plan
 for President Svoboda on 23 Au-
 gust to lead a delegation to Mos-
 cow to negotiate a settlement.   He
 was accompanied by two conserva-
 tive party members and three re-
 formers, all Dubcek appointees.
 In a speech before his departure,
 Svoboda-said he was going to Mos-
 cow at his own request.   He was
 received by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and
 Podgorny, and accorded the full
 honors befitting a chief of state.
 The talks in Moscow, instead
 of lasting only a day as originally
 announced, covered four hectic days
 ending on the night of 26 August.
 The original delegation from Prague
 was joined on 24 August by Dubcek
 and Premier Cernik, and later by
 nearly all of the Czechoslovak
 party presidium.   On the last day
 of the talks, the leaders of Mos-
 cow's allies--Gomulka, Ulbricht,
 Kadar, and Zhivkov--gave their
 stamp of approval to the modus
 vivendi worked out between the
 Czechoslovak and Soviet leaders.
 On 27 August, Moscow released
 a communique' providing the sub-
 stance of the agreement with the
 Czechs.   It was signed by 13 So-
 viet leaders, including 9 out of the
 11 members of the politburo,  and
 by 19 Czechoslovak leaders, also
 including 9 of 11 presidium mem-
 bers.  President Svoboda and Party
 First Secretary Dubcek subsequently
 gave grave, emotion-laden speeches
 appealing to their people to under-
 stand the circumstances of the
 agreement and to maintain order,
 unity, and discipline.
 The key points in the agree-
 ment, as set forth in the communi-
 que, are:   the Soviet troops that
 "temporarily" entered Czechoslo-
 vakia will not interfere in Czech-
 oslovak affairs and will be with-
 drawn "as the situation normalizes
 all Czechoslovak media would serve
 the party and the cause of friend-
 ship among Communist nations, i.e.,
 censorship; both sides agreed to
 strengthen the solidarity of the
 socialist community, fulfill bi-
 lateral and multilateral agreements,
 and "administer a resolute rebuff"
 to those who would encroach on the
 existing borders in Europe; and,
 the Czechoslovaks agreed to demand
 the removal of the Czechoslovak
 question from the UN agenda.
 The Czechoslovak people have
 somehow found it within themselves
 to live with, at least for the
 moment, the terms of the communi-
 que--a very bitter pill--and at
 the same time to retain their sense
 of pride and of having played an
 historical role in the restoration
 of Czechoslovakia's honor.   The
 realization of their still precar-
 ious position will probably prevent
 any serious active popular resist-
 ance.   At this point, it is evi-
 dent to the populace that they
 would have much to lose and nothing
 to gain by such action.

 Since 28 August,  the govern-
 ment has seemed intent on restor-
 ing the country to an even keel.
 A special commission has been es-
 tablished to determine the steps
 necessary to implement the Moscow
 "agreement."   At the same time,  the
 newly elected party central com-
 mittee met, possibly to discuss                         the
 validity of the extraordinary 14
 Party Congress.   Dubcek had implied
 in his speech on 27 August that the
 results of this congress might not
 be acceptable.   There were signs,
 however, that Dubcek would face
 stiff resistance within the party
 if he tried to overturn the congress'
 actions.
 The National Assembly resolved
 unanimously that the Warsaw Pact
 occupation was illegal and insisted
 that a "concrete date" be fixed for
 the troops' withdrawal.   It also
 demanded that information media and
 government organs be allowed to
 function freely.   The Slovak party,
 for its part, on 28 August elected
 a liberal as its new first secre-
 tary, replacing a conservative.
 A new presidium was also elected
 with nine newcomers, giving it a
 decisively reformist character.
 Moscow's handling of the po-
 litical side of the invasion and
 its aftermath gave many signs of
 misjudgement and vacillation in
 the leadership.   Although the col-
 lective leadership as a whole has
 the responsibility for the deci-
 sions taken in the crisis, there
 have been persistent reports of
 divisions within this group.   The
 Czech issue will, in any case, put
 severe strain on Brezhnev's  "cen-

 The Soviet action has disillusioned
 the Western Europeans and has rein-
 forced the appeal of NATO and Euro-
 pean regional institutions.
 Recent events have also con-
 firmed Western European Communists
 in their nationalistic approach.
 The effect on the Communist parties
 and Communist-led labor unions is
 likely to be the more lasting.
 Western European governments are
 discussing, at least for the pres-
 ent, slowdowns of bilateral programs
 with the USSR, but are keeping their
 doors open for steps toward resump-
 tion of detente.
 In Western Europe,  the Soviet
 invasion was greeted with expres-
 sions ranging from consternation in
 such capitals as London and Brus-
 sels to the  low-key statements of
 neutrals--Austria, Switzerland,
 Sweden,  and Finland.   The Finns,
 particularly sensitive to their
 strategically exposed location, are
 expressing concern over a possible
 deterioration in their relations
 with the Russians.   The UK, Italy,
 and West Germany are all stressing
 the importance of NATO, and it ap-
 pears that the Alliance's future may
 be strongly influenced by the fact
 of the rapid Soviet occupation of
 Czechoslovakia.
 NATO's present theory of warn-
 ing, which presupposes a period of
 critical consultation and military
 build-up by prospective attackers,
 is being re-evaluated.  Moreover,
 the recent trend of force reduc-
 tions and redeployment within the
 Alliance is likely to be halted by
 a collective pledge to freeze cur-
 rent levels pending a review of
 European security.   Italy and oth-
 ers may reiterate calls for an-
 other 20-year extension of the NATO
 treaty.   Italy and West Germany
 have also stressed the need for
 greater European political unity.
 At the same time, however, Italy,
 West Germany, and Switzerland are
 using the Czechoslovak situation as
 an excuse to postpone signature of
 the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 French President de Gaulle has
 denounced the invasion as an exer-
 cise of the "doctrine of power blocs,
 a consequence of the Yalta accords."
 Paris' initial reaction to the Mos-
 cow talks is that the Czechoslovaks
 came out surprisingly well.
 The Western European public
 has expressed outrage over the de-
 velopments in Czechoslovakia, both
 in the press and through public
 demonstrations.   Except for the Com-
 munist parties in Luxembourg and
 West Berlin, and the illegal Commu-
 nist parties of Spain, Portugal,
 and West Germany, orthodox Commu-
 nists in Western Europe have casti-
 gated Moscow.   The Italian  and
 French parties have been foremost
 in this Communist rebellion, ac-
 companied by the labor confedera-
 tions each dominates.   The Commu-
 nist-controlled World Federation
 of Trade Unions has not yet taken
 a public position.

 CZECHOSLOVAK CRISIS INFLAMES DIVISIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE
 The invasion of Czechoslo-
 vakia by the USSR and its allies
 has inflamed the already serious
 differences between Eastern Eu-
 rope's orthodox Communist regimes
 and the independent-minded Yu-
 goslavs and Rumanians.   The cri-
 sis also has revived latent na-
 tionalistic emotions in the Bal-
 kans.   Relations among these
 states will henceforth be vexed
 and uncertain.
 Belgrade and Bucharest, by
 insisting that nothing can jus-
 tify the armed intervention in
 Czechoslovakia, have provoked
 unprecedented rebukes from their
 more doctrinaire neighbors.   For
 the first time, Rumanian party
 leader Ceausescu has been at-
 tacked by name in highly unflat-
 tering terms by the Hungarian and
 Soviet press.  Although Yugoslav
 President Tito has not been so
 arraigned, both the Yugoslav and
 Rumanian "leaderships" have come
 under heavy fire from Soviet,
 Hungarian,  and Bulgarian media
 for their "unseemly behavior" in
 joining the "imperialist chorus"
 demanding an end to the occupa-
 tion of Czechoslovakia.
 Soviet bloc representation
 at various Rumanian National
 Day diplomatic receptions on
 23 August was deliberately mini-
 mal,                        a symptom of the multiply-
 ing divisions in Eastern Europe.
 In contrast to previous years,
 no press commentary on the Ru-
 manian anniversary appeared in
 the Polish press.
 Bulgaria has further added
 to the fragmentation of Communist
 unity, despite the tense atmos-
 phere of the Czechoslovak crisis,
 by choosing to escalate its long-
 standing dispute with Yugoslavia
 over Macedonia.   Ordinarily, Sofia
 is content to state its historical
 claims to Macedonia in scholarly
 journals.   The day after the inva-
 sion of Czechoslovakia, however,
 :Bulgaria's leading party organ
 directed a major assault at the
 Macedonian party leadership.
 Tito and Ceausescu appear
 concerned, but undaunted.   They
 presumably agreed during their
 :meeting on 24 August to avoid pro-
 voking their adversaries, and
 probably are preparing for addi-
 tional ideological, economic, and
 diplomatic pressures from Moscow
 and its allies once the Czecho-
 slovak situation stabilizes.
 Tito told the US ambassador
 in Belgrade that Yugoslav-Soviet
 relations from now on would be de-
 void of trust and confidence.   This
 fear of treachery and military
 intervention will henceforth per-
 meate bilateral relations between 25X1
 the states of Eastern Europe.

 The Communist offensive in South Vietnam continues to focus on
 secondary targets mostly in outlying areas, but indications are mounting that
 a major effort against Saigon may be imminent. Although enemy casualties
 have been running high, most of them have been sustained by Viet Cong
 local elements. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main force units for the
 most part have still not been committed.
 Vietnamese Communist propagandists, meanwhile, are beginning to
 emphasize the long-term nature of the campaign, suggesting that the enemy
 intends to keep up the fighting for a fairly lengthy period. A recent
 Liberation Radio broadcast characterized each of the staggered attacks thus
 far made as an "individual general offensive" that contributed to the "high
 tide of our general offensive."
 Local military commanders in China are taking full advantage of their
 new license to crack down on the Red Guards. These former targets of Red
 Guard abuse, now free to retaliate for the first time, are using all the
 instruments at their disposal in what seems to be a rapidly escalating
 campaign to destroy the Red Guards as a present or potential political force.
 In Laos, government troops are moving eastward from recently cap-
 tured Muong Phalane, but they will probably be careful not to push their
 luck too far as they move closer to the strongly defended infiltration
 corridor. Elsewhere in the country, military activity is generally at a low
 level, even by rainy season standards.

 VIETNAM
 The opening round of the
 Communists' latest military cam-
 paign was highlighted this week
 by widespread mortar and rocket
 attacks and ground assaults
 against allied positions through-
 out much of South Vietnam.
 In the northern provinces,
 enemy forces maintained heavy
 pressure on the main routes of
 approach to Da Nang, Hoi An, Tam
 Ky, and Quang Ngai city.   Vigor-
 ous allied spoiling operations,
 however, inflicted enemy losses
 in excess of 1,200 killed and
 may have at least temporarily
 pre-empted major ground attacks
 against these capital cities.
 With the exception of sporadic
 heavy skirmishes in western Quang
 Tri Province, allied bases along
 the Demilitarized Zone as well
 as the provincial capitals of
 Quang Tri city and Hue remained
 relatively free of major enemy
 activity.
 An attack by a North Vietnam-
 ese regular force of regimental
 size against the allied Special
 Forces camp and district head-
 quarters compound at Duc Lap in
 Quang Duc Province generally over-
 shadowed all other enemy activity
 in the II Corps area during the
 week.   The three-day action at
 Duc Lap appears to have been a
 diversionary scheme designed to
 draw sizable allied reinforce-
 ments to the scene from nearby
 Ban Me Thuot in order to allow
 the North Vietnamese 1st Division
 to mount a major attack on the
 Darlac provincial capital.
 Page 11
 Duc Lap, however, was rein-
 forced from allied assets else-
 where in II Corps and this, cou-
 pled with intensive B-52 and tac-
 tical air bombardment, ultimately
 forced the enemy to disengage
 after sustaining losses of at
 least 300 killed.   Allied casual-
 ties included 79 killed and 196
 wounded.
 Although the enemy continued
 to maintain pressure against the
 allied bases of Tay Ninh, Dau
 Tieng, Loc Ninh, and Song Be in
 the outer provinces of III Corps,
 Saigon and its environs remained
 generally untouched.   Late in the
 week, however, enemy action did
 intensify in Hau Nghia and Long
 An provinces on Saigon's western
 and southern flanks, and the capi-
 tal itself was subjected to a
 light rocket attack.
 Viet Cong forces in the
 delta generally confined their
 activities this week to small-
 scale ground probes and wide-
 spread mortar shellings, al-
 though one heavy engagement in-
 volving three main force battal-
 ions was reported near the dis-
 trict capital of Cai Lay in Dinh
 Tuong Province.

 The enemy's current offen-
 sive thus far has been marked
 by the application of economy-
 of-force tactics against allied
 targets of secondary importance
 in generally outlying areas.   With
 few exceptions--Duc Lap, Da Nang,
 Tam Ky--the attacks have been
 largely hit-and-run affairs spear-
 headed in most cases by enemy lo-
 cal force and sapper units.            These
 tactics, in addition to holding
 down casualties to enemy main
 force units, which for the most
 part remain uncommitted, appear
 largely diversionary in character--
 designed mainly to weaken the de-
 fense of major objectives by forc-
 ing allied deployments to areas
 under siege.
 The staggered geographical
 nature of the attacks, starting
 in III Corps on 18 August and
 shifting to the delta and thence
 to the northern provinces and the
 highlands area, suggests that the
 Communists intend to sustain their
 current campaign over a prolonged
 period as well as to confuse and
 complicate the allied response.
 Communist Commentary
 on the War
 Hanoi is putting increased
 stress in its propaganda on al-
 leged domestic unrest in the US
 over the administration's refusal
 to stop the bombing of North Viet-
 nam.   Their action probably re-
 flects a growing Vietnamese Com-
 munist hope that the US will even-
 tually concede the issue without
 holding out for reciprocal con-
 cessions.  At the same time, the
 Communists appear to believe that
 the fighting in the South will
 continue along inconclusive lines
 for some time.
 Recently captured documents
 indicate, however, that plans are
 in train for a series of further
 offensive thrusts, which they
 hope will result in higher US
 casualties and a concomitant rise
 in "dovish" sentiment in the US.
 The documents suggest that the
 enemy, although reaffirming the
 "general offensive and general
 uprising" strategy, has concluded
 that a decisive break in the war
 cannot be expected to result from
 the offensives conducted so far
 this year.   The Communists prob-
 ably expect nonetheless, that ac-
 tions now in process and others
 planned for the future will demon-
 strate that the conflict remains
 an indecisive stalemate from which
 the allies can, at best, expect
 only a compromise settlement.
 Political Developments
 Plans for an early shuffle
 of the cabinet have apparently
 been shelved for the time being
 as Prime Minister Huong continues
 to test how far he can go in -shap-
 ing the government to his own lik-
 ing.

 Although the
 prime minister has thus demon-
 strated considerable skill in
 handling his cabinet, there are
 indications that he was actively
 pushing the transfer of Khiem
 and that he was obliged to yield
 to Thieu's cautious views in this
 area.   Khiem is already a con-
 troversial figure and giving him
 a strong hand over the military,
 as Huong apparently desired,
 would almost certainly have aroused
 greater antagonism than Thieu
 is prepared to face at this time.

 LAO GOVERNMENT FORCES CONTINUE TO MAKE LIMITED GAINS
 Laotian troops are continu-
 ing to make some progress in re-
 gaining territory lost to the
 Communists during the past dry
 season, although government
 forces are still on the defensive
 throughout most of the country.
 In the south, the Communists have
 been pushed out of the Muong
 Phalane area after some of the
 sharpest fighting in over four
 months.   Close air support was
 responsible for heavy enemy
 casualties and government ground
 forces captured large quantities
 of weapons, ammunition, and  other
 equipment.
 The recapture of Muong
 Phalane, which the enemy took last
 February,  is the first major
 government victory in more than
 a year and should help repair
 morale which sagged during the dry
 season  setbacks.   Government
 troops now intend to move east-
 ward along Route 9 from Muong
 Phalane, but they will probably
 exercise care not to push their
 luck too far as they move close
 to the strongly defended infil-
 tration corridor.
 In the north, government
 forces are attempting to close
 out a two-month old operation
 aimed at securing the rice-rich
 Muong Son valley.  The government
 plans to establish an air navi-
 gational facility at Muong Son
 to replace the one lost at Phou
 Pha Thi last March.   Recent gov-
 ernment air strikes have inflicted
 a heavy toll of enemy casualties
 and should enable the government
 to maintain a foothold in the
 area at least through the remain-
 der of the rainy season.
 Aside from these  actions,
 however, fighting this rainy
 season has been at a relatively
 low level.   For  the  most part,
 government forces are still on
 a defensive footing and the Com-
 munists have not demonstrated any
 inclination to follow up their
 considerable gains of the dry
 season.  The continuing presence
 of a substantial number of North
 Vietnamese troops is a clear sign
 that they intend to defend most
 of the territory they now hold.
 Moreover, they are in  a  posi-
 tion to launch new attacks at a
 time and place of their  own
 choosing.
 it is likely that the Communists
 will wait until the next dry season
 begins in October before initiating
 any widespread offensive.   Prior
 to this, however, probing attacks

 RED GUARDS UNDER HEAVY ATTACK IN CHINA
 The drive against the Red
 Guards, which started in July as
 a limited effort to stop the fight-
 ing and violence, has developed
 into a full-scale campaign to de-
 stroy their organizations as a
 present or potential political
 force.  The assault is being con-
 ducted vigorously and even savagely
 in some areas.   Peking has made un-
 usual efforts to link the cam-
 paign with Mao himself even though
 it is directed mainly at those
 radical factions that  were  in-
 cited by Mao Tse-tung and his
 radical advisers to denounce lo-
 cal military officers suspected
 of disloyalty a year ago.
 These former targets of Red
 Guard abuse, now free to retali-
 ate for the first time, are do-
 ing this with all the instruments
 at their disposal.   Provincial
 propaganda media, denouncing as
 "counterrevolutionaries" the stu-
 dent Red Guards who just a short
 time ago had Mao's favor and pro-
 tection, demand that no mercy be
 shown them.
 the army has in-
 cited mobs to lynch some individ-
 uals, others have been summarily
 executed, and large numbers have
 been paraded in public and whipped
 with bicycle chains.
 A number of Red Guard lead-
 ers who held high positions in the
 Kwangtung Revolutionary Committee
 are reported to have been arrested.
 The intention seems to be to elimi-
 nate the radical leadership and
 terrorize the rank and file.   It
 is not clear how long the campaign
 will last.   A broadcast from
 Shanghai, reporting on plans to
 send vigilante groups of "workers"
 to clean out the city's 26 full-
 time universities, gives the im-
 pression that a protracted ordeal
 is planned.
 As a result of the campaign,
 considerable disorder and tension:
 persist in China, but of a different
 sort than before.  Police brutality
 has replaced factional fighting
 and, because attention is focused:
 on political enemies, ordinary
 crime is on the increase.
 Old-line military and party
 figures continue to consolidate
 their strength in provincial gov-
 ernments.  The three "revolution-
 ary committees" formed during August
 are all run by local military offi-
 cers and former party secretaries.
 This leaves only Tibet and Sinkiang
 without new committees, but an-
 nouncements are expected soon for
 these remote border areas.   Last
 year, several leaders in Peking
 stated that one purpose of forming
 provincial -committees was to lay the
 groundwork for a new party congress.
 Little has been heard of this plan
 in recent months, however, possibly
 because the top men in Peking cannot
 agree on who is to occupy key podi-
 tions in a reorganized leadership.
 The present standing committee
 of six men and Madame Mao includes
 several Cultural Revolution Group
 members who, like the Red Guard
 movement they have been directing,
 no longer seem to serve a useful
 purpose.  These figures, particu-
 larly Mao's hatchet man, Kang Sheng,
 and Chen-Po-ta, head of the group,
 are probably bitterly disliked by
 the military and old party offi-
 cials who now dominate most local
 governments outside the capital.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Border exchanges and terrorist incidents between the Arab states and
 Israel have continued at a high rate.
 The first Egyptian incursion in months across the Suez Canal has
 infuriated the Israelis, who are threatening severe retaliatory measures. Israel
 may hold back from major reprisals until the Israeli airliner, which was
 hijacked last month and is still in Algiers, is released.
 Splits between left- and right-wing republicans erupted in fighting in the
 capital of Yemen last week. The royalists began to shell the city in order to
 take advantage of the conflict, and the casualty rate was apparently high.
 Prime Minister Amri successfully restored order, but further disturbances are
 likely.
 In Turkey, student groups protesting Soviet intervention in Czechoslo-
 vakia twice forced the early closing of the Soviet pavilion at the Izmir trade
 fair. Soviet officials are reported to have threatened to close their display
 completely if the demonstrations were not stopped. The prevailing volatile
 mood in Turkey probably will not have dissipated by the time personnel
 from the US Sixth Fleet visit Izmir from 29' August to 9 September.
 The growing locust threat in the Middle East and Africa has prompted a
 new call for collective efforts by East African control officials. Observers
 from the Sudan and the Arabian peninsula, where fertile breeding grounds
 are located, will be invited to a meeting in Asmara, Ethiopia, to consider new
 steps to combat the plague.
 In the Nigerian civil war, federal troops are pressing on into the densely
 populated Ibo heartland. The Biafrans are :reported to have evacuated Aba,
 an important administrative center, thus adding to their already serious
 refugee problem. Biafran troops are, however, stubbornly resisting the fed-

 INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER GANDHI UNDER INCREASING ATTACK
 India's Prime Minister Gandhi
 has come under increasing attack
 in recent days both from the op-
 position political parties and
 from within her own Congress Party.
 The issue precipitating the latest
 attack on her leadership was the
 Indian Government's handling of
 the Czechoslovak issue.
 Mrs. Gandhi's statement on
 21 August,  in which she expressed
 "concern" at news of Soviet inter-
 vention in Czechoslovakia, was de-
 nounced as too mild the following
 day in Parliament.  A proposed
 resolution offered by a member
 of the Congress Party, which char-
 acterized the Warsaw Pact action
 as a "clear violation of the UN
 Charter," was defeated by the
 Congress majority but had the
 support of all non-Communist op-
 position parties and four members
 of the Congress Party, including
 Minister of Petroleum, Chemicals,
 and Social Welfare Asoka Mehta.
 Mehta, who once  was  a close
 economic adviser to Mrs. Gandhi
 but has become increasingly es-
 tranged from the prime minister
 in recent months, subsequently
 resigned from the cabinet.
 When word reached New Delhi
 that India had abstained on the
 UN Security Council resolution
 condemning Soviet intervention
 in Czechoslovakia, violent criti-
 cism of the government erupted in
 both houses of Parliament and led
 to a protest walkout
 by all non-
 Communist  opposition
 parties.
 Mrs. Gandhi's assurance that the
 government
 supported
 every word
 of the UN
 resolution
 except "con-
 demn"--she
 preferred
 "deplore"--
 did little
 to mollify
 the law-
 makers.
 Party President
 Nijalingappa recently joined the
 ranks of those opposed to Mrs.
 Gandhi, according to press re-
 ports.  Deputy Prime Minister
 Desai and Home Minister Chavan,
 both considered major contenders
 for the prime ministership, have
 become increasingly disenchanted
 with Mrs. Gandhi's performance.
 operating in the prime min-
 ister's favor are the slowly im-
 proving economy, the natural
 reluctance of party leaders to
 engage in a struggle that could
 further damage Congress Party
 unity, and the probability that
 no agreement has yet been reached
 on a successor. Additionally, Mrs.
 Gandhi is not lacking in the art
 of political infighting and has

 PAKISTAN ATTRACTING COMMUNIST INTEREST
 A flurry of activity involv-
 ing the exchange of economic and
 military delegations is taking
 place between Pakistan and sev-
 eral Communist countries, sharpen-
 ing the contest between the USSR
 and Communist China for influence
 there.
 In July, a Pakistani delega-
 tion received a Soviet commit-
 ment to provide military equip-
 ment.   Details  of  the  So-
 viet  agreement  are not known,
 but Moscow, in deference to India,
 had heretofore provided  only
 vehicles and helicopters under
 commercial contracts.  China, the
 first Communist country to deliver
 combat equipment  to  Pakistan,
 remains a major source of jet
 fighters, bombers, tanks, and
 ground forces equipment.
 Much of the current economic
 activity with the USSR is a fol-
 low up to Premier Kosygin's visit
 last April.  At that time, some
 impetus was given to the Soviet
 economic program which, with the
 exception of a seven-year-old,
 $30-million oil exploration pact,
 stems primarily    from  about $150
 million in credits extended dur-
 ing the past four years.                     The USSR
 is expected to announce soon the
 completion of feasibility studies
 for a steel mill in West Pakistan
 and a nuclear power reactor in
 East Pakistan.
 In late July, moreover, the
 Pakistani minister of agriculture
 visited Moscow to complete arrange-
 ments for Soviet assistance in
 developing the fishing industry.
 As part of this project the USSR
 offered to conduct a survey of
 expanded facilities at a port in
 West Pakistan.   The USSR now has
 announced the imminent arrival

 INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS
 The second phase of the in-

 mutual hope for some movement

 realize, however, that the nego-
 tiators have considerable ground
 to cover before any reasonable

 A gradual dissipation of the

 serious crisis last November will
 add to the already substantial
 burden of the negotiators.   Con-
 tributing  to  this                    slowdown

 parties the issue has produced considerable confusion, indecision, and even
 factionalism. Extreme leftist and pro-Chinese parties have condemned the
 action. The Mexican Communist Party, which heretofore has always fol-

 troops and begin negotiations based on the principles of equality, respect,
 and noninterference in the internal affairs of states and parties.

 CUBA LINES UP WITH MOSCOW ON CZECH CRISIS
 Fidel Castro's grudging en-
 dorsement of the Soviet inter-
 vention in Czechoslovakia, in a
 speech on 23 August, was an em-
 barrassing compromise of his
 pretensions of independence from
 Moscow.   It will probably tarnish
 his image abroad and heighten
 disenchantment with his policies
 in Cuba.
 Prior to this, Cuba had
 adhered officially to a neutral
 position on Czech-Soviet rela-
 tions while tolerating some ex-
 pressions of anti-Soviet senti-
 IOn the 22nd, Cuban
 authorities permitted more than
 200 Czechs--including Prague's
 ambassador in Havana--to hold
 an anti-Soviet rally and to dis-
 tribute a declaration demanding
 the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
 For two days following the
 invasion, however, no official
 statement was issued.   Then on
 the 23rd, Castro was forced by
 circumstance to act against his
 own instincts and convictions.
 In an uncharacteristically
 disordered speech, he simultan-
 eously attempted to condone the
 intervention and to maintain the
 same level of criticism he has
 directed against Moscow since 1966.
 He said that the invasion was
 a "flagrant violation" of Czech
 sovereignty with "absolutely no
 legality," but that it was justi-
 fied.                                                       He criticized the Warsaw
 Pact countries for supporting
 "rightist" leaders in Latin Amer-
 ica, and asked them if they would
 also send troops to protect Cuba,
 Vietnam,  or North Korea.   In
 addition, a major portion of
 Castro's speech was devoted to
 criticism of the US.   He ex-
 plicitly rebutted rumors that
 Cuba would consent to a rapproche-
 ment with the US.
 Castro's awkward position
 was partly a result of his am-
 bivalent feelings toward "lib-
 eral-nationalist" Communist
 regimes.  Although he deplored
 the "archrevisionist" reforms
 in Czechoslovakia, he probably
 also admired the willingness of
 the Czechs to confront Moscow.
 In the final analysis, however,
 he apparently realized that he

 could not be silent.   He may
 have been concerned that there
 had been a shift toward a hard
 line within the Soviet leader-
 ship.   In any case, because of
 his continued dependence on So-
 viet economic and military aid,
 he was compelled to support Mos-
 cow.
 In only one instance in the
 past--when the Soviets in 1962
 withdrew their strategic weapons
 from Cuba--has Castro's ultimate
 role as a pliant Soviet client
 been so blatantly demonstrated.
 Because of the self-conscious
 excuses he put forth in his
 speech, he probably feels humil-
 iated, and may seek some means
 of restoring his cherished image
 of independence.
 POPE FAILS TO RESOLVE DIVISIONS IN LATIN AMERICAN CHURCH
 Pope Paul VI received a
 tumultuous public reception dur-
 ing his three-day visit to Co-
 lombia last week, but his pro-
 nouncements on the role of the
 Catholic Church in social change
 will probably widen the schism
 between the increasing number
 of progressive clerics in Latin
 America and the unyielding ultra-
 conservatives.   Many of the bish-
 ops, who are in Bogota to attend
 the Second Conference of Latin
 American Bishops, were hoping
 for a papal pronouncement for
 an active role for the church
 in pushing for immediate changes
 in the social structure--for an
 immediate social revolution--
 with a few even endorsing the
 idea that violence might be nec-
 essary in some instances.
 Obviously, the Pope had
 never intended to support the
 position of the militant, noisy
 minority of "left trend" priests
 and laymen who see revolution
 as the only means to solve Latin
 America's problems.   The large
 group of progressive priests, on
 the other hand, genuinely hoped
 that the Pope would attempt to
 direct the church to a left-of-
 ceenter approach to Latin Amer-
 ica's social problems.

 revolution as a means to achieve
 social improvements.
 Speaking to workers and peas-
 ants on 19 August, the Pope
 denounced the violence advocated
 by radical priests.   He assured
 the poor of his concern for their
 miserable conditions and, as part
 of a five-point program for so-
 cial reform, stated that the gov-
 ernments and upper class Latin
 Americans should strive for more
 social awareness and sharing of
 the wealth.
 The five points, which are
 in effect a partial restatement
 of his encyclical "On the Devel-
 opment of Peoples" of March 1968,
 are:  to proclaim the Christian
 dignity of the poor;  to continue
 to denounce economic inequality;
 to support fraternal assistance
 from developed countries to under-
 developed countries; to have the
 church serve as an example of
 generosity and service; and,
 finally, to reject violence and
 In his address to the bish-
 ops' conference, however, the
 Pope appeared to reverse his
 position as he defended conserv-
 ative theology including his
 recent birth control encyclical.
 Moreover, his emphasis on non-
 violence and a gradual approach
 would seem to contradict his
 earlier emphasis on the "imme-
 diate need" for social reform.
 The result of the Pope's
 visit, therefore, appears to be
 a significant victory for the
 church conservatives and a loss
 for progressives.  Although the
 progressives, according to press
 statements they have made, will
 probably accept the Pope's pre-
 cepts, they now believe that
 the Pope's use of the terms
 "order and gradual change' are
 giving conservative churchmen
 a ready-made excuse for blocking
 change and maintaining the status
 quo.   They believe further that
 the Pope is unwittingly aggra-
 vating the estrangement of "left-
 trend" radical priests and may
 drive more progressives into the
 radical camp.   This, in turn,
 could weaken the church's in-

 INCOMING ECUADOREAN ADMINISTRATION FACES MANY PROBLEMS
 When Jose Maria Velasco
 Ibarra assumes the presidency
 on 1 September, he will be
 greeted by essentially the same
 problems that kept him from serv-
 ing out three of his four earlier
 terms.
 Velasco's talent for obtain-
 ing political power has been
 matched by his inability to ex-
 ercise it wisely.  Although over
 the years he has commanded the
 respect and the support of many
 able men, he has tended to ig-
 nore their advice in favor of
 unscrupulous, self-interested
 counselors.  A similar situation
 appears to be shaping up for his
 new administration.  Many moder-
 ate and capable men are support-
 ing him, but so are opportunists
 such as ex-president Carlos
 Julio Arosemena and Castroite
 Manuel Araujo.
 In shaping his economic
 policy, Velasco will be hampered
 by a budget situation that is
 deteriorating rapidly.   Prov-
 inces whose funds have been cut
 this year are threatening strikes
 and civil disorder.  Velasco is
 faced with the problems of re-
 ducing current expenditures,
 meeting the needs of the prov-
 inces, and planning for future
 budgets.
 The election of center-left
 vice presidential candidate Jorge
 Zavala, who ran on a ticket op-
 posed to Velasco, could also
 cause problems.   Zavala has
 claimed publicly that his job
 entails undefined but unlimited
 powers, which he will exercise
 as he sees fit.  Although it is
 doubtful that Zavala will have
 official powers beyond those
 mentioned in the new constitu-
 tion, there are a number of ways
 he could harass Velasco.   He
 could make public statements
 criticizing the President and
 his policies and expose cases
 of alleged Velasquista graft or
 corruption.   Finally, he could
 emulate Velasco's last vice
 president, who succeeded in over-
 throwing Velasco and having him-
 self installed as president.
 During three of his four
 previous administrations, Ve-
 lasco's inability to maintain good
 relations with the armed forces
 played a major role in his fall
 from power.  Although many mili-
 tary men have no desire to inter-
 vene in politics after the diffi-
 culties their governing junta
 encountered from 1963 to 1966,
 their willingness to tolerate
 the activities of leftist or
 irresponsible officials who
 threaten the nation's welfare
 is not unlimited.   The military
 may already be concerned by a
 statement attributed to Velasco's
 probable defense minister that
 some senior officers will be
 retired involuntarily.   This
 statement conflicts with assur-
 ances by other Velasquista
 leaders that Velasco is not plan-
 ing an extensive purge of senior
