 Although YOSBIDA can be expected to oormly with occupation wishes in
 fiscal matters, it appears that the Jai anese Goverment will attempt to
 increase Executive Branch authority at the expense of the SOAP-favored

 The Republic of Korea will continue to press for increased i15
 military aid, possibly with offensive action in mind (p. 4).
 Although Acting President LI has been able to bring further major
 Nationalist fibres into his camp, there has been no real improvement in
 the prospects for peace in China (p. 5),  bieamvhile, the Communiste. have
 shown increased interest in the future of Taiwan, while Nationalist elements
 there continue to work at erosa-purposes and Taiwanese disgruntlement
 increases (p. 6).
 French and Viettoamese observers in Indochina express cautious optimism
 regarding Sao Pai's prospects for success in the face of severe problems (p. 7).
 Continued degeneration of goner   ntal authority in Burma increases

 Legation in Sian is reportedly active in arranjing the purchase of tin

 products smuggled in from Java. Sumatra and western Rorneoo  Falsified
 shipping documents and export permits can be supplied by bribed port

 small amount of lead to tin concentrate, for example, the shipment may be
 listed as lead-tin solder?  The shipping pattern for Siamese material
 probably follows that reportedly used for oladestine shipments of rubber

 Such deference to occupation wishes, horrevcr, may not be farthea n ng
 in connection viith two political pro$oots close to T(X HIUA's heart.  The
 first of these is the establ3s nt of a Ccrzcittee for the Invoetigatioa
 of tan-Japoneso Activities patterned after the simflsr i15 -Congressional
 Committee.  IOSIIIDA plans to organize his caaxdttee under 'the Cabinet,
 houevmr, in a nova to avoid its use as a sounding board by the Ccumsunists,
 whose 35 seats would be sufficient to assure them a voice in the opera-
 tions of any Diet Caxiittee.  The second project is the dissolution of
 the Diet Committee for the Investigation of Illegal Property Transactions,
 which uncovered the black market and bribery scandals that contributed to
 the collapse of preceding administrations,  TOCHIDA comp2alne that the
 committee's operations have increased Communist Party influence and
 proposes that the Attorney General's office assume all responsibilities.
 Neither of these propositions is favored by SOAP which has endeavored to
 strengthen the Legislative Branch of the Government rather than the
 Executive.
 Re]dadm gg   F?  ' rUg Aoetuoned. A single yen exchange rate probably    "C8
 will not be established by 1 April., in accord with the US economic
 recovery directive of December,* 1948s, which envisioned ostablishment of a
 single exchange rate within three nonths0  SOAP now indicates that the
 exabange rate in to be established within three months after fulfillment
 of most of the objectives of the directive rather than three months after
 the date of its issuance.
 The problem of the establishment of a single yen exchange rate is
 particularly acute at the present time because it is expected to be
 raised at the April General Agroement on Tariffs and Trade Conference
 (GATT) where most-favored-nation treatment for Japan gill be considered.
 Opposition, especially from parts of the British Conmonrerlth, is expected
 to center on alleged subsidies being given Japanese products thorough
 continuation of the multiple exchange rate system.  IIot,ever, this specific
 objection may be overcome through assurance that the single rate will. be
 established in 1949.

 it would still constitute a severe strain on Korea's deficit econo r.
 President Rhos believes., hovevor, that a strong military forco is
 essential to deter invasion from Worth Korea and will continue to exert
 all possible pressure an the US for additional military equipment,
 From the hang range point of view, hoer, the thinking of Rhoc and
 some of his advisors probably goes beyond consideration of the purely
 defensive values of the military establishment.  Rhee has become convinced
 that a majority of the troops serving in the northern Korean Peoples'
 Arty are actually sympathetic to the South and that they would revolt if
 southern Korean forces moved north to *libcratea the area from Soviet
 puppet control,  If Rhee is suec?osf' l in develoLAng an efficient ArV
 of 100,000, in addition to a sr al  Navy and Air Force, he might take
 aggrei~aive action that would precipitate a full-scale vor between

 Ssechuan arrived in Banking to discuss peace preparations. USUH Yueh,

 Nanking discussions uy IHANG Chun  CdIANG a
 Commander who reportedly is cooperating withpLIATd~ j~  n~aootheeration
 important South China leaders, CHANG ft-kwei and YU &n-moue have also
 arrived in Nanking,  LIs ability to line up the support of Nationalist
 regiore.l leaders has undoubtedly been enhanced by the considerable
 influence which the new Premier &) Ying-chin exercises in the Whampoa
 military clique.
 While LI Tsung..jen apparently has thus increased his bargaining
 Power, there has been no real progress toward peace.,  It is possible
 that CHIANG Kai-shek has instructed his supporters to give nominal support
 to LI'e peace policy while preparing for continued and united resis-
 tance in the likely event of a break-dawn of peace negotiations, There
 are indications that CIU.&NG is sti ll stronger than LI,  For instance
 CHANG Chun, addressing Legislative and Control Yuan and Kuomintang
 Central Executive Cormraittee members i.n Canton last Week. said that the
 Government was continuing war preparations in order toaohieve peace,,
 and he and other Nanking officials have condeaed a Peiping-pattern
 Peace as tantamount to surrender.
 The Chinese Communists are on record as favoring a regional Peiping-
 pattern pease, and may be expected to treat LI Tsung-jen?s Government as
 a local regime and not as a National Government, unless they a re convinced
 that LI is the bona fide leader of all non.Conmuunist China,;  Last week
 the Communist Radio blasted Ho Ying,-chin's appointment as the work of
 CH.IANG.Kai.ahek, describing it as evidence that CHU G retains control
 over the LI Government and is using it  to counteract the true peace"

 of the CCP.  The Communists are undoubtedly making military preparations
 for crossing the Yangtze and their forces north of that river  have been
 reportedly reinforced by Communist Manchurian armies,  If and when the
 Communists feel that there is nothing to be gained by further negotiations,
 they will cross the Yangtze and resume the military offensive.
 Taiwan - center of intrigue..  Increasing Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP) interest in Taiwan and the prospect that control over the island
 may become a major issue in peace negotiations have been indicated
 in at least five COP broadcasts sinca 1 March,;  In these broadcasts
 the Communists have bitterly flayed US "imperialistic designs" on Taiwan
 and have promised the early liberation of the ialand.~  The USSR has
 ,..ong been interested in the island fortress? particularly in US
 activities thereon, and has in the past year greatly increased its
 intelligence activities in Taiwan.
 The Nationalist Governor. CAAEN Cheng, a trusted confidant of CHIANG
 Kai-ehek,; did not have', until a recent Cabinet ruling, control of the
 Nationalist troops (approximately 20',OOO) in training on thu island,
 These troops have been under the command of pro-American General SUN
 LU-jen, who concurrently holds the post of vice-Commander in Chief of
 the Nationalist Army,  SUN has informed US officials that he is conducting
 a "back stage ware' against CM14 Cheng and is no way aligned with him.
 In addition Acting President LI Tsung-jen informed a US official that
 hena:s considering the appointment of SUN as Governor of Taiwan.  The
 removal of GkiEN and the appointment of SUN would constitute a very
 strong bid for continued US support of the Nationalist Government in
 Taiwan and would consideraoly strengthen Li's bargaining position with
 the Communists by ensurin6 the Acting President's "de jure" control of
 the island,
 On the other hand, the Taiwanese do not want either. the Chinese
 Nationalists or the Communists but they may be forced to turn to the
 Communists as their- only means of ousting the hated Nationalist rule,
 It appears likely that the Communists may seize the opportunity offered
 by the present schizaphren1e condition and set the stage for occupation
 of Taiwan by means of extensive CGP infiltration of the Nationalist
 Navy and Air Force now stationed on the island, widespread acts of
 sabotage  and possible arming of some of the native Taiwanese,  when
 the Communists occup~r Shanghai and the Yangtze valley cities they will
 gain control of a large mount of commercial shipping.  If COP sabotage
 and infiltration of the Nationalist Navy and Air Force is successful
 to the extent of causing defections and/or disruption of defensive
 operations it will then be a comparatively simple task to move to
 Taiwan by means of these ships and occupy the islands  Such strategy
 appears most advantageous to both the Communists and the USSR and would
 most'certainly effectively block the establishment of any anti-.Gom=
 monist Ch-nese or Taiwanese Government on Taiwan.  (See ORE 39-49,

 Communists denounce Atlantic Pact,  The Chinese Communist Party
 CCP) responded as anticipated to the am ounoement of the provisions of
 the Atlantic Pact, denouncing the pact as another "plot of the war
 provcateurs" led by "the American imperialist government."  The Com-
 mu gists used the occasion to endorse, for the first time, the Sinn'
 Soviet Treaty of August 1945, and to reaffirm the unity of the CCP
 with the USSR.
 The lengthy CCP broadcast also condemns the US for refusing to
 recognize the sincerity of Stalin's "peace" overtures, and for rejecting
 the proposals of the Soviet Union regarding disarmament,; atomic weapons,
 r'ad control of atomic energy,  The broadcast attributesthis recalcitrance,

 ,wEver,.,.within the entire imperialist-camp,," compelling "the inter-.
 na4ional reactionaries;,..to find a way out of this crisis through war,."
 Th3 broadcast finds hope,however, in "the organized strength to win
 peace; the nucleus of this strength lies in the Soviet Union," rein-
 forced by Soviet satellites, Communist parties, pro--Soviet and com-
 munist front groups everywhere?
 The broadcast notes approvingly the statements of the leaders of
 14 other Communist parties, "responding to the call of Thorez and
 Togliatti," and states that "we, the Chinese people, will surely, with-
 out question ...support this call."  China is especially impelled to do
 so, the broadcast alleges, as China has suffered directly from armed
 invasion and from foreign support of the Kuomintang in the civil con-
 flict.,   In short, "the Chinese people..,..cannot but regard,.,the American
 imperialist elements as their mortal foe,... and the leaders of the world
 anti-imperialist front--the great socialist state, the Soviet Union-
 as their comrades in arms from first to last,,"
 The above remarks were not ascribed? as have been important state-
 ments of policy in the past, to MAO Tse-tung, or to any other Party
 leader, or even to the Central Corrmittee, but merely to a Communist
 news agency "editorial," a vehicle which the CCP has sometimes employed
 for positions which were subsequently reversed.  There is little chances
 however,, that this particular position will be reversed in the foreseeable
 future; until the USSR's aggression in China becomes manifest to the
 CCP, or even thereafter (as in Yugoslavia),, the CCP can be expected to
 continue to support the Soviet position on international affairs.:

 resistance elements will cooperate with Baa Dai under certain conditions
 (i.e.. a face-saving arrangement to avoid surrender of arms to the French),
 and an apparent confidence in Bao Dail s ability to pacify the country.
 On the other hand, these observers acknowledge the deep mutual suspicion
 which may prevent a practical solution as long as the French remain in
 Indochina,
 '?'hila the actions of the non-Conanunist resistance element in Indochina
 are hard to predict, it is improbable that ranid shifts to support of
 'Pao Dai will occur,  Only if it becomes apparent that a reasonably Lade-
 pendent regime may succeed will there be any significant realignment which
 would add strength to a'government headed by Bao Dai.  Further, it is quite
 doubtful that a Vietnamese army under Pao Dai would be successful where
 the French have found a program of military suppression infeasible,.
 Although the Bao Dai agreement grants wider concessions to the ea-
 emneror than were offered to iio Chi "3nh, the partly successful Viet "I nh
 effort to drive France from Indochina will enc,-~tarage the non-C ammunists to
 continue their present opposition to the French?  Also, a campaign has
 already been launched by die-hard French colonial officials and residents
 to undermine the new experiment at the working level.
 PTTT.TA
 !Fa or governmental shakeu  possible,  The present Burmese Government
 may undergo a major revision or even collapse in the near future as the
 multi-faction civil war continues to weaken its already tenuous authority,,
 Karen forces in central Burma have captured several important towns, con-
 siderable amounts of money and supplies and have liberated large numbers
 of Karen military personnel from Government internment.  Furthermore,
 Kaohin and Chin Government troops are showing little enthusiasm for fight-
 ing Karens and are reported to be deserting or remaining neutral                        If the
 Karen forces move southward as expected, they will be augmented by in-
 creasing numbers of irregulars and will probably overrun the weak Govern-
 ment forces defending the approaches to Rangoon.  Under these favorable
 circumstances, the Karens have ignored a recent Government offer of
 amnesty, which was largely without substance, and are probably more deter-
 mined than ever to press their demands for an autonomous or independent
 state
 To avert military defeat at the hands bf the Karens, the Government
 is apparently seeking an accommodation with the insurgent Peoples' Volun-
 teer Organization (PVO).  Although there has been no official confirmation,
 it has been reliably reported that Prime '4inister Thakin Nil has agreed to
 give the PTO three seats in the cabinet and accept 13 PVO den.-Inds.  Among

 tion of F'V? authority over the areas it controls,?and the inclusion of
 all Wfs now bearing arms against the Government into the regular Army.
 A Government-M) settlement is not likely to alter the existing military
 situation materially in the near future, or establish a more stable and
 popular regime.  Such a coalition would inherit the unsolved problems
 of its predecessor, and probably be confronted by many now ones.  The
 redistribution of political and military patronage could be a particular-
 ly thorny issue.                      Furthermore, there are those in the Government who
 would vigorously oppose cooperating with the PVO, while on the other
 `land many Me, possibly with the support of Supreme Commander Ne M n.,
 desire to form a purely PVC-appointed cabinets  Therefore, although a
 superficial agreement may endure temporarily, personal feuds, factional-
 ism and confusion will continue.
 Dutch delay weakens Republican control over   errillas,  The few
 Republican leaders now at liberty in Indonesia are concerned over the
 absence of a centralized, leadership over Republican adherents.  They
 feel that while the Dutch hold the moderate leaders as -political prison-
 ers, more radical military leaders will assume effective authority..
 This development is a strong probability in view of the fact that mili-
 tary units operating in pockets : n isolated areas will be forced to rely
 more and more on their own initVitivec' Aside from the growing independence
 of regular TNI (Republican Arny) units, Tan Malakka (often characterized
 as a Trotskyite) is supported by militaristic groups of the extreme left
 wing and will undoubtedly make a bid for leadership.  Tan 'falakka's forces
 may find a possible source of added strength in remnants of the former
 Communist Party (PKI) army which took refuge in the hills of Central and
 Fast Java when its coup against the Republic failed last September.  Dutch
 forces have recently-YiLunched a drive against certain pro-Tan Malakka
 groups located in Central Java, but initial airdrops failed to make con-
 tact with these guerrilla forces.
 Regular Republican and independent guerrilla resistance to the Dutch
 has accelerated to such an extent,in recent months that even a centralized
 government at Jogjakarta would encounter difficulties in enforcing a cease-
 fire order.  !'Yell-informed Republican officials have estimated that if
 President Soakarno were to be restored immediately to authority at Jog-
 jakarta (this is a crucial point in Dutch-Indonesian relation, his commands
 to military units would be only 60 per cent effective.  It is believed that
 the longer he remains in detention, the less effective would be his in-
 fluence when restored to power, a'fact which the Dutch may well be exploiting
 in their present delaying tactics,.

 SECTION III.  AE ESTIMATE
 "Point Four" in Southeast Asia
 President Truman's inaugural address contained the declaration that
 "we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our
 scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement
 and growth of'undeveloped areas."  In explanation of this fourth point in
 the President's foreign policy statement, Truman said that while US
 material resources were limited, US technical knowledge was not and was
 therefore exportable without restrictions  The President stated that the
 export of technical proficiency was not intended to be a US monopoly but
 should include other nations and international organizations as partners.
 Private enterprise in both the US and other nations, in the President's
 opinion, should be encouraged to invest capital in undeveloped countries
 under guarantees both to the investor and to the indigenous peoples.
 Since technological aid is being given to many nations by a number of
 US departments and agencies, by special UN commissions and by TCA, while
 private dapital is active in colonial areas as well, the originality of
 "Point Four" lies less in the granting of a new sort of assistance to
 undeveloped foreign countries than in a new concept of implementation.  It
 is planned that "Point Four" aid will be better coordinated both on a
 national and international level; that the various categories of exported
 skills  will be expanded; that the quantity of help will be considerably
 augmented; that the number of participating countries will be increased
 and finally that the program will be sustained on a long-range basis.
 Designed as a measure to raise living standards of the depressed
 millions in undeveloped areas, "Point Four" will nerve to promote US
 security interests and blunt the spearheads of Soviet propaganda by so
 doing.  Further, American technical, mechanical and organizational talents.
 exhibited abroad, should increase US prestige and influence.  In all,
 "Point Four" may well develop into a major instrument for the advancement
 of US foreign policy,
 On 3 March 1949, the State Department requested specific overseas
 missions to report on local reactions to "Point Four", including comments
 on local interest manifested, cooperation that might be expected and such
 recommendations as could be offered immediately as to kinds of activities
 needed and channels or agencies best suited for conducting them.  Replies
 from all State Department addressees in Southeast Asia have now been
 received and are analyzed, below. country by country0

 Unsettled political, military and economic conditions here make
 prediction of the degree of cooperation to be expected difficult and even
 raise the question of with whom negotiation's may be conducted.  A Bao Dai
 government will unquestionably desire and request all possible US or other
 friendly foreign aid.  The French will in all likelihood only agree if the
 program is conducted solely under their auspices and integrated with their,
 own unrealistic "ten year" plan.  A Viet Minh-controlled government would
 probably oppose US assistance as a "threat to sovereignty,
 In view of this,, M. Consul General, Saigon, recommends that the 'inder4
 taking  be temporarily restricted to the following;
 (1)
 Instruction in improved methods of agriculture and animal
 husbandry through k:CAFF.
 (2)  Organisation of a health program through WHO0
 (3)  Immediate financing by the'US of a program sponsoring admission
 of substantial numbers of Vietnamese to US universities for the
 study of engineering; and other professions, as well as financing
 of groups for technical "on the job" training in the US a
 (4)  Possible loans or grants for the purchase of urgently needed
 machinery and equipment to restore'normal Production and, in this
 connection, utilization of a small number of US specialists for
 installation of equipment.
 (5)
 Possible encouragement of private American capital to participate
 in mixed companies to develop untapped mineral and industrial
 resources,
 Although for many years the most politically stable area in Southeast
 Asia, Siam is not superior to her neighbors in economic development and
 may even lag behind some of them  Historically, Siam has evinced a serious
 interest in developing her resources but the government has been handicapped
 by a lack of qualified technical personnel to direct or execute plans,
 Siam, therefore, would welcome "Point Four".
 US embassy,, Bangkok,, suggested the following courses of actions
 (1)
 Comprehensive economic survey,,to determine definitely Siam's
 mineral, agricultural, industrial, and financial assets to
 preceed selection and assignment of advisers.

 Siam's economy being largely based on rice export, aid in
 rehabilitating railways, highways, waterways and; harbors should
 be given high priority,
 (3)   Organization of an effective public health program and training
 in the prevention and cure of human and animal diseases
 (4)   Encouragement of private financing for hydroelectric pro cots?
 both to improve irrigation and to provide power for railways and
 industry,
 (5)
 Dstablishment of a US training program for some 20 Siamese
 annually in the fields of medicine, public health, engineering?
 agriculture, transportation, mining, geology, land conservation,
 forestry and general eoonomiosa  In each of these fields, one
 American should come to teach and train pupils in Siam as well.
 Exchange of students and professors in non-technical fields is
 also desirable,,
 The UK is presently implementing its own economic and social
 rehabilitation program in Malays.,,  The effort is being handicanped, however,
 by widespread banditry under Communist direction.  This handicap, as well
 as a limited reserve of funds. makes it probable that British authorities
 would be well disposed toward "Point Four" technical aid and financial
 investment patterned to fit their undertakings,
 USS Consul General,, Singapore, suggests that such assistance could beet
 be implemented as follows:
 (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 Expansion of food production through increased. acreage,, improved
 irrigation and mechanized cultivation of rice as well as develop-
 ment of offshore and river fisheries.
 Institution of mass elementary education, including adult classes,,
 Broad revision of Malayans present economy, including introduction
 of more household industries, development and introduction of
 disease-resistant rubber plants, more diversification of crops,,
 more effective utilization of labor, surveying of geological
 and forest resources prior to development of mining. sawing and
 milling operations and the expansion of electric power for
 processing exports and local goods,            %
 (4)   Institution of a health program both to teach methods of combat-
 ing the many virulent local diseases and to increase local
 production of medicines,

 Current conditions of near anarchy in Burma (see po 8) will probably
 prohibit any early application of "Point Four" there.  The Burmese, more-
 over, are almost pathologically suspicious of any form of foreign aid at
 present, believing all such acts to be attempts at "imperialist" control.
 Eventually? however, Burma will need considerable technical advice and
 foreign capital.
 US Charg6, Rangoon, reports that a program of assistance to Burma
 :night include :
 (1)  Possible development of light industry and assistance in
 production of minerals, oil, and hardwoods.
 (2)  Establishment of resident advisory rroups for improvement of
 agriculture and health.
 (3)  Increased fellowships to Burmese graduate students in the US.
 INDONESIA
 Netherlands officials have implied that, in general, the Dutch them.
 selves possess all the skills necessary to direct the rehabilitation of,
 Indonesia and therefore do not need outside advice.,  Republican represent-
 atives, on the other hand, have exhibited much enthusiasm for "Point
 Four".  US Consul General, Batavia, reports that opportunities for develop-
 ment are unlimited in the fields of conservation, forestation, transporta-
 tion, communications, electrification, apprioulture, public health, govern-
 ment administration and education.  Recent and current warfare in Indonesia,
 in his opinion, will intensify Indonesia's needs?
 In accordance with the April 1946 Philippine Rehabilitation Act,
 reconstruction aid is now being given by the US in a wide variety of fields.
 Since this program is scheduled to end on June 30,q 1950, the Philippines
 may be expected to welcome "Point Four" in the future.
 US Charge, Manila, has outlined a very extensive program which is
 briefly summarized as follows:
 (1)  Assignment of a large group of scientific and professional
 specialists to advise in the maintenance and development of
 almost all technical facilities in the Islands.
