 Ithe population of Pyongyang-si (YD 3822; N39-01, E125-45)
 was approximately 700,000.                NK authorities did not allow the influ~.OX`l -HUM
 of rural population to Pyongyang-si, except for those officials and workers and
 dependents who were transferred to posts in the city,  The reason that NK regime
 banned the rural population entry to the city was to check over-inhabitation for
 housing shortage, keep off political dissidents and to avoid unplanned concentra-
 tion of population into urban area.                       When, however, more manpower was needed for
 construction project in the city, laborer teams were recruited from rural areas
 and shipped to the city.  The houses in uptown were one story residences, most
 of them were temporarily built after the Armistice.  Supply of water and
 electricity was made round the clo'9k.   Bus was the only transportation facility
 for Pyongyang residents.  There were nine regular bus lines operating in
 Pyongyang - the Loop Line, Yongje-gyo Line,Sa-dong Line, Changjin-ni Line,
 lest P'y'ongyang Railroad Station Line, Kambuk-tong Line, Hisan-long Line,
 Taet'aryong Line, and P'yongch'on-ni Line.  The starting and terminal stations
 of these lines are listed in the last part of this report, under the Items from
 No. 204 to 218.  Buses were operated from 0500 hours to 0100 hours the next day;
 a bus starting from each station in every three or four minutes from 0500 to 2300
 hours and in every thirty minutes from 2300 to 0100 hours.   The bus fare was 10
 chon for a ride and 60 chon per month, for a commuter usi
