 that party branches consider            propaganda among the masses is
 bility only of certain cadres.  The branches havenotrmaded the reaponai-
 the
 regular work of all party members or given it systematic guidanceafrom
 all levels of party committees. One of the basic duties of a party
 member is to conduct propaganda work among the masses at any time and
 place, to indoctrinate them tirelessly with the revolutionary spirit, to
 combat all reactionary ideas and aims, and to awaken and uplift the
 people.  If propaganda toward the masses lacks both regularity and organ-
 ization, then this duty is not being effectively performed.
 Such a lack permits the circulation of incorrect thinking by
 counterrevolutionaries, obstructs the strengthening of ties between the
 party and the masses, hinders the party's struggle to prevent officialism
 and commandism, and causes some party members, when working among the
 masses, to become infatuated with the method of simple executive com-
 mands instead of with that of persuading and explaining.  Tn dealing
 with the masses, the party must abolish such conditions and improve its
 propaganda work.  It must systematically organize a regular propaganda
 network, i.e., set up propagandists in each branch and reporters at
 each level of leadership with a definite system of reporting.
 The duty of _ propagandist is to explain, under party guidance, to
 those around :im current domestic and foreign events, party and govern-
 ment policies, the people's duty, and model experiences in productive
 labor and other work; to refute all reactionary rumors and mistaken
 ideas; to encourage the study of model experience and the fulfillment of
 duty; and to report conditions to party leaders in order to help them
 plan the proper method and content of propaganda.
 Each party branch should select from its own members, from the
 Youth Corps, and from branch affiliates, model laborers willing to
 undertake propaganda under party guidance; it should also select other
 active revolutionary elements to be propagandists.   They should have the
 necessary political awareness, set an example in production. keep in
 close touch with the masses, and have the necessary energy for propa-
 ganda work.  A propagandist's methods includE calking, passiria on news,
 reading papers, listening to and passing on radio reports, writing and
 drawing propaganda materials, editing wall newspapers, etc.  Each
 propagandist may select one or more methods in accord with needs and his
 own abilities.  Each propagandist should be examined and appointed by
 the party branch committee and approved by the next higher party organ.
 Party and Youth Corps branch secretaries, branch committeemen, and
 members who are ordinarily in touch with the masses (such as labor-union
 cadres, cooperative cadres, ch'u and hsiang cadres, teachers, educational
 officials, and wall newspaper editors) should all be propagandists.
 Party committees should regularly discuss propaganda work, regard
 propagandists as an important link between them and the masses, and
 give them guidance, help, and education.

 Party branch committees should hold regular plenary conferences
 their propagandists accordi
 of
 ng to directives from superiors and local
 conditions, discuss the scope and method of the branch's propaganda work
 examine the conditions and experiences of propaganda work, receive re-
 ports about the masses, and give practical directions for propaganda
 work.  To mobilize all revolutionary groups for concerted effort, these
 conferences should decide on a suitable division of labor among the
 party, Youth Corps, labor-unionsbir'pecahsapnrtsoplunions, cooperatives  and may
 other groups.      times of the   an
 vary according to The wo trkneeds and branch,activities,sbutconferences
 conference' should be held at least once a month  and at most or    a week. .
 City and hsien party committees should hold a conference of branch
 secretaries each month, or a convention or assembly of propagandists.
 The party committee secretary for city or hsien should report on con-
 ditions and tasks, and preside over a review of the past month's work
 and a discussion of the coming month's work.  If travel conditions are
 poor, the hsien committee may call ch'u conferences.  The ch'{ committee
 should undertake to represent the city or hsien committee in ordinary
 guidance of branch propaganda work, and, according to conditions in
 each branch, define the usual scope, aim, and method of each branch's
 activities.  In the villages, the ch'd committee should set up the
 system of propagandists' transmittal stations, wnere the committee will
 assemble the propagandists of several branches or their representatives,
 decide the content and method of propaganda, and distribute and explain
 propaganda material.
 The provincial, city, local,' and hsien committees should supply
 propagandists with directives and materials.  Each party I.-per and
 magazinenshouldasublishodiscussionsuof propaganda
 on       work.  Party schools
 rses for  propaganda work ,and, where
 possible, institute short-term classes
 propagandists.
 For the                   and fully
 the at a pecificmtime,, it isdnottenough to dependrsole y one r policies
 worK.  Systematic reports must be made directly andlregularypby all aga
 party officials to the masses concerning current events, policies, and
 work tasks and experiences.   With this in mind, each provincial, city,
 local, hsien, and ch'dparty =ommittee should appoint reporters to make
 political reports to the masses.   Reporters are propagandists of a high
 type, and should be the guides of the propagandists.
 Reporters are secretaries and committeemen of provincial) city,
 local, hsien, and ch'ii party committees, and party members who hold
 corresponding positions in the people's governments, and other party
 members appointed by party committees.  Each reporter must make at
 least one political report every 2 months to an assembly or convention
 of city and country people (primarily workers and peasants).  The sub-
 ject of these reports must be approved by the secretary of the party
 committee to which the reporter belongs, and the result of the report
 should be communicated to the secretaries of the party committees.  The
 party committees are responsible for examining the work of their re-
 porters and for ensuring the regularity, correctness, and improvement
 of their work.  Provincial and local party committees should publish
 selected reports of satisfactory reporters.

 The purpose of organizing groups of propagandists and reporters is
 to enable the party's propaganda work among the masses to develop useful
 basic cadres, there is no intention to limit party propaganda work to
 propagandists and reporters.  The leader of each party organ and each
 propagandist and reporter must enlist active persons for propaganda
 work.    In new are,e, where few party members have been recruited and
 few branches established (except where activists have been recruited and
 trained as propagandists), a non party propaganda network should be
 organized.  In all widespread propaganda movements, the party should
 work harmoniously with democratic parties and popular bodies; it should
 organize all government, People's Liberation Army, cultural, educational,
 and art workers to do propaganda work in order to create a large propa-
 ganda array for all objectives.
 A propagandist and reporter system should be quickly organized
 throughout the party.  Although difficulties are unavoidable, they
 must be solved.   In the past year, much experience has been gained in
 trying to establish propagandists in many cities, industries, and mines,
 and in a few villages in the Northeast, North China, and Central-South
 China.  However, to set up an efficient, large-scale propagandist and
 reporter system, it is still necessary that the party exert serious
 efforts.  Each province and city party committee, as local conditions
 permit, should draft practical measures for implementing this decision
 in the next 6 months   These measures should be referred to the central
 offices of the committees for approval.  At specified intervals, the
 central office should inspect their executive in order to get prompt
 results.
 B.  Success of Chung-thou  Hsiang Branch of Youth Corps in Propaganda Work
 (The following account of the help given to the party by the Chung-
 chou Hsiang branch of the Youth Corps in setting up a propaganda network
 was written by Wang Yiin-ts'ung.)
 Since Chung-chou Hsiang, Wan-nien Hsien, Kiangsi Province, began asing
 propagandists, they have stimulated and organized all types of worx.  The
 result has been rapid progress in all work in the hsiang.
 Chung-thou has four villages and 416 homes with over 1,900 persons;
 it does not yet have a party organ.  The propagandists' work is handled
 through the Youth Corps under direct guidance from a higher-le:al party
 committee.  Of the 24 propagandists in the entire hsiang, 11 are Youth
 Corps members.   The propagandists are divided into four sections to
 correspond with the four villages.  They control 4 broadcasting stations,
 4 wall newspapers, 7 newspaper reading groups, and a village dramatics
 team.
 Before April 1951, Chung-thou had no propagandists, the masses'
 awareness was low, and there was general mental lassitude.  The cadres
 wanted to go home to produce; the militia was disbanded.   In regard to
 production, the people worried about floods and drought, and were un-
 willing to farm carefully.  They relied on Heaven for food and were
 superstitious.  The propagandists immediately began to combat these
 backward ideas and conditions.

 education with the complex work of landreform.~They uarous d e the masses
 r
 to complain.  They unmasked the reactionary sect called "13 Guardians"
 in their evil plots for new peasant associations.  Also, they linked
 the past reactionary Chiang regime with the plots of US imperialism for
 arming Japan, recounting the cruelties of the Japanese in Wan-nien Helen,
 and thus aroused hatred against imperialism and reactionaries.  The prop-
 agandists said:  "You have started upwards, you have taken up arms; rout
 the US wolf, and protect your country and homes."  Then 19 hsiang youths
 left to join the array.  After being educated in patriotism, the entire
 hsiang understood the simple doctrine of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and
 80 percent of them were capable of propagandizing others.  On the Labor
 Festival  (1 May),  ever 1,200 persons paraded, carrying hoes, rakes,
 sickles, and other farm tools.  Patriotism among the masses was higher
 then ever.
 With regard to production, the propagandists taught the masses to
 overcome natural calamities.  A drought in June caused the masses to
 say that the grain was still so small, and to ask how long they could
 endure the drought.  The propagandists, analyzing the         'd
 suggested practical                                           pinpte   ofirking,
 preparations to combat the drought instead of re-
 liance on luck.  They said success in production aided the Resist-
 America, Aid-Korea movement, and that, if all  ..re willing to try, nature
 could be overcome.       The hsiang government then gathered the people to-
 gether, set up a united leadership under an antidrought committee, col-
 lected 73 pumps, and assembled 119 volunteers.  A gong was used for a
 signal, and time was counted by water dripping from a bamboo pipe (there
 were no clocks or watches).  Water was brought up by shifts:  The shifts
 were changed but the machines were kept working.  Near the pumping teams
 were blackboards, for posting prompt praise or reproof; and during rest
 periods the propagandists encouraged everyone by reading stories of how
 other places overcame drought. The drought in Chung-thou was overcome,
 and about 1,555 mou [about 259 acres] of grain land was saved.
 Immediately after this there was a flood, and the propagandists
 appealed by radio to the people not to relax the preparations made a-
 gainst the drought, to rise and rescue the dikes, and to remain united.
 They effectively combated the selfish backward idea of looking only
 after one's own land and not repairing the dikes.  The flood was over-
 come as a result of the hsiang government's guidance and the propagandists'
 pressure.  In Chung-thou, 5,000 mou(ebout 833 acres) was saved and lake
 lands that had been hard to cultivate for many years had an abundant har-
 vest.
 After the central Resist-America, Aid-Korea society issued three
 great apReals, Chung-chou propagandists unmasked rumors put out by the
 reactionaries, and said:   "Farmers need tools for their fields; the
 [Chinese People's] Volunteers need weapons for fighting; we must aid them
 by making contributions to provide airplanes and cannon."  Among slogans
 used were:   "Early contributions, early felling of US devils," and "For-
 ward gifts early, US devils beaten that much sooner."  The masses were
 thus enlightened, and the movement for sending gifts spread rapidly.
 Within 2 days theasiang had given 15 million yuan.

 STATI
 Furthermore, as a result of exhortation by propagandists, some per-
 sons in Chung-chou have signed patriotic agreements, etarted plowing for
 veterans' families, eliminated superstition, and acquired culture.
 The reasons that the propagandists have been able to be so useful
 are as follows:
 1.  Under party committee guidance, the Youth Corps has strengthened
 its leadership in propaganda work.  The Youth Corps branch has regularly
 studied propaganda wo_:.  It maintains a close connection with peasant
 unions and the hsiang people's government, and controls the system of
 conferences and studies for propagandists.
 2.  Propagandists study the ideas of the masses.  They collect ex-
 periences and actual cases from among the masses, and use these to teach
 the masses.  They have the peasants recall the bitter past and contrast
 it with present-day life.  They arouse the peasants' class hatred and
 class consciousness, and point out the path of future struggle.   Facts
 prove that "recall" and "contrast" are effective methods of teaching
 peasants.  The peasants' awareness is raised, work is promoted, and the
 propagandists' confidence is strengthened.
 3.  Propaganda work has become regular.   Since Chung-chou has had
 propagandists, propaganda work has been regularized because the Youth
 Corps branch has led and supported each type of propaganda activity.
 Propagandists have been notably useful in all lines.
 In Chung-chou the cadres call propagandists "the pioneers."
 Chung-chou's propaganda work has become a model for the whole hsien.
 The moral is that, where the party has not established a branch, a
 Youth Corps branch directly guided by the chit committee can help the
 party set up and lead the work of a propaganda network.
 [Comment:  This section contains short summaries of three
 of ten brief exhortation;, called "lessons," taken from the
 monograph Ch'ing-nien-t'uan Chi-pen Chih?  hih Chiao-ts'ai

 The party founded the Youth Corps as a means of preparing the next
 generation as an auxiliary and reserve.
 The corps can perform this function by studying the works of Marx and
 Mao and by entering the struggle marked out by party and goverment to de-
 fend and build up the fatherland.
 Neither learning nor doing can be emphasized because there is no
 actual separation; there is both learning by doing and doint while learn-
 ing.                                                        To link theory with practice in all kinds of work, the corps uses
 the basic method of persuasive education.  When a project is to be done,
 the corps indoctrinates members and nonmembers with the Marxist viewpoint
 and method; it then allows them to take part in the project, combining
 study with performance.  In this way, they have a chance to learn politi-
 cally while serving both party and government.
 and 2 During the first year of the Korean War, some 3,440 corps members
 a67  nonmembers served as railway transport workers.  Members from
 schools and factories entered military cadre schools.  In some troop
 units, over 90 percent of those winning merit were corps members.
 Young men, both corps members and nonmembers, helped party and
 government a great deal in land reform and plant reorganization. 'The
 Youth Corps played a large part also in suppressing counterrevolution-
 aries, and corruption and dishonesty of all kinds.

 The corps also recruits members for the Pioneer organization.   In
 August 1951, the membership of the latter was estimated at 3 million.
 Pioneers may graduate into the corps just as corps members may become
 full-fledged party members.

 1.  Progressive thinking -- Applicants must have political awareness
 and must be willing to serve the laboring class and to struggle for China's
 new democracy and socialism.  They must recognize the supremacy of the
 Communist Party and serve its interest in building a new China ann in
 freeing the workers of the world.

 1. Meaning of Youth Corps Education
 Education is of special importance to the Youth Corps.             The
 corps is a school for teaching Marxism-Leninism and the writings of Mao
 Tse-tung to the masses of youth.  The study of Marxism-Leninism involves
 not only learning from books but learning from the masses by taking part
 in all activities of society.  Corps members who are production workers
 in the villages and factories are at the same time learning.         Peasants
 who visit a tractor exhibit or a factory or who take a trip on a train
 are practicing a type of education.  According to Chairman Mao, the con-
 tent of education is, broadly speaking, knowledge of the struggle to
 produce and knowledge of the class struggle.  Today, both these types of
 knowledge must be acquired.
 Generally, the thoughts of young people are relatively simple.
 Their view of life has not yet been fully defined.  Consequently, they
 must be given new knowledge of science, of the revolutionary struggle, of
 progressive Marxism-Leninism, and of the writings of Mao Tse-tung, so
 that they can form a correct world view.  Some persons say that a youth
 will naturally become a Marxist-Leninist.  Such a view is incorrect.
 Lenin criticized such "self-development," as he called it; youth must be
 taught Marxism-Leninism in a planned., systematic way.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/12 : CIA-RDP80-00809A000700240026-5
 Because China was so long under imperialism and feudalism, the
 country's youths have been culturally backward and largely illiterate.
 This made it difficult to learn Marxism-Leninism, for cultural knowl-
 edge is a tool for learning this revolutionary theory.  Consequently,
 professional propagandists must be permanently and carefully assigned.
 The professional propaganuist a? initially set up in the USSR no longer
 exists because conditions have changed.  The USSR Communist Youth Corps
 has been in existence for 32 years; its members are already well-
 indoctrinated in political ideology and have a cultural level better
 than the average.  In the USSR, propagandists with a knowledge of pro-
 ductior can generally be installed in factories, schools, and villages.
 At present throughout China, the Youth Corps has 2,260,000
 members and is rapidly growing strong.  Through education the corps will
 develop its many functions, will achieve progress, and will enrich the
 lives of its members.  Therefore, to strengthen corps education is a
 matter of first significance.
 2.   Carrying out of Youth Corps Education
 To carry out corps education, the first step is to strengthen
 the propaganda bureaus by establishing new ones and improving the old
 bureaus at all levels, and by rapidly supplying them with propaganda
 cadres.           In a village, for instance, one out of the corps' three ch'u
 cadres must undertake propaganda duty.  At the psien or local level,
 there must he one or two propaganda cadres, and at the provincial or
 regional level the propaganda bureau must be complete and strong.  Prop-
 aganda cadres must conform to a definite cultural and political standard.
 Secondly, corps committees above the provincial or city level
 should assign professional propagandists, obtaining them from corps
 schools or other departments.  These propagandists can then promote
 systematic education.
 Thirdly, city, hsien, and ch'u committees should obtain part-
 time propagandists, such as politicaI teachers, primary teachers, and
 persons with sufficient cultural and political background, and qualified
 party members; these should be trained in propaganda work.
 Fourthly, corps committees at higher levels must systematically
 prepare materials and textbooks.
 Finally, the corps central committee should draft a national
 plan for corps education, with unified materials, plans, and systems.
 This will avoid repetition and confusion, and will ensure system and
 progress to corps education throughout the nation.
 3?                      Methods of Propaganda Work
 a.  Understand conditions and objectives.  This is essential
 for a successful propagandist.  Start with the status and desires of the
 masses in factories, villages, and schools; i.e., "measure your meals by
 the dishes you have, cut out the clothing by measuring the body," as Mao
 Tse-tung said in his essay against formalism.  Don't talk about problems
 you cannot solve, or about matters that you have not cleared up.

 Your principles familiar history, stories of leaders, actual
 deeds of corps members, and classic illustrations, explaining repeatedly
 so that corps members will easily understand and be deeply impressed.
 c. Become familiar with the vernacular, and use a minimum of
 technical terms.  If you want to learn common speech, do not be pomrous.
 The masses will not tell you directly that they do not approve or under-
 stand, but instead will nod or drift.
 titudTo sue up: Being a propagandist implies ability to grasp the mul-
 to learn humbly fromothem; to absorb and revise fttheirathouwith their talk,
 ghts,, feelings,
 and demands, and the immediate circumstances.  You must use the method
 of "principle combined with reality."
 Another duty of a propagandist, is to report conditions to all corps
 committees; to become a bridge connecting the masses with actual con-
 ditions in the corps.  The propagandist must not merely teach well; he
 must also penetrate the people, understand their conditions, and report
 these to higher corps committees.  Propagandists should familiarize them-
 selves with both masses and corps, becoming well-informed.  This does
 not mean to become "wayside gossips" or "highway reporters."  A propa-
 e"ndist must be a good analyst and judge of conditions.  He must get in
 touch with those at the center of things and make his own analysis.

 1.  Procedure and Results
 In April of this year 11952?1, instruction about the corps was
 put into the hands of study guides by the corps committee.   Ten lessons
 were given by the end of August, two on suppressing counterrevolution-
 aries and one on current events.  The other seven dealt with corps spirit
 and activities.  The lessons were attended by corps members and by about
 50 young workers.
 Many corps members were ignorant about corps work. They dis-
 covered there was much to learn about duties, besides being progressive
 and studying.  They learned to speak out and to have more initiative.
 As the lessons became standardized and regularized, they were
 appreciated more, since they supplied a need felt by both learner and
 corps group.  When lessons were missed, there was a sense of something
 lacking.

 2.  Attitude of Corps Committee Toward Study Guides Changed
 At first the committee was careless and indifferent; appointment
 of study guides was left to one man.  The guides were neglected for over
 6 months.  They felt inadequate to the great demands on them, and the
 committee had little faith in them.   Thus they were frustrated in their
 efforts at the mill.
 However, the study guides progressed in learning, especially
 through a lesson on corps organization and discipline.  The corps members
 were imp'-ssed, showed more respect for the study guides, had new faith
 in them, and began to help them more.
 The corps committee then used propagandists to help study guides
 with the subject and presentation of each lesson.  This was followed by
 constructive criticism.  Study guides also would sit in on corps confer-
 ences to get ideas and reactions.  They tried hard to improve their
 methods, using their spare time for further research.
 3.  Character and Functions of the Corps Lesson Committee
 a.  Nece city of a corps lesson committee -- As long as corps
 education was unplanned, it was handled by one propagandist.  As demands
 grew and the work became systematized, content had to be improved.  The
 corps branch turned this and similar matters over to a lesson committee
 for more efficient handling.  The branch concentrated its strength on
 periodic review and summation, so as to have better leadership and free-
 dom from routine.
 b.  Lesson committee composition -- The lesson committee is made
 up of seven persons, whose chairman is the branch deputy secretary, with
 a branch propagandist as executive deputy chairman.  Study guides and
 other persons concerned may be members.  Cadres may be employed to free
 others for more important work.
 c.  Practical duties include (1) drafting plans for lessons,
 (2) discussing and adapting procedural suggestion.:; by study guides,
 (3) discussing reactions from corps members, (4) fulfilling requirements
 of attendance, statistics, mimeographing, etc.  All these have been
 fairly well done except the second, which is the most important.  Various
 other matters also fall under the purview of the committee.
 d.  Leadership of the lesson committee -- The committee helps
 propagandists and study guides do their work, and is itself under the
 guidance of the corps branch, whose work it  does in this field.  This
 guidance is exercised through decisions on reports received from the
 lesson committee, and through the propagandists acting as agents for the
 branch in relation to the practical work of the lesson committee.
 (Editor's Note:  This experience in founding a Youth Corps lesson
 committee can guide similar efforts in government departments, factories,
 schools, and certain types of villages.)

 Part II  Section 4:  Co  s Education Throu h Individual Stu    b  L1
 Kung- t' iea
 The Peking University Corps Committee, in the 40 days following
 4 May this year [1952?], experimented with educating corps members
 through individual study.  Taking part were 1,100 persons, including 200
 nonmembers. This experience throws ligt' on an efficient method.
 Certain Conditions Required
 In the Resist-US, Aid-Korea movement, Peking University corps
 members had their awareness quickened.  They were ready to learn and had
 many questions.  With some help, these students could understand theory
 and cultural. writings.  Thus the conditions of successful achievement
 were present.
 Methods to Overcome Difficulties
 At the end of March, the proposal for individual study was well-
 received.  However, some cadres had misgivings about lack of experience,
 guidance, leisure, books, etc.  The corps committer decided to go ahead,
 relying on guidance frcm the more experienced leaders.  Books could be
 borrowed and circulated, and time would somehow be found.
 The greatest problem was how to relate individual study to the
 central task.  All agreed that a central task would always be present
 and that to wait for a time of inactivity and peace before beginning
 study was unrealistic.  Some sections in the medical department had
 organized study of the novel    Son; but this did not hinder taking part
 in rather activities, but resulted rather in increased patriotism.  Oth-
 err,, on entering a military cadre school, were greatly impressed by the
 f'.gure of the hero, Ao-li-ko [see below].  If a book has educational
 significance, reading it with political awareness heightened, will fit
 in well with any central task.
 Individual study stimulates interest in actual deeds, and
 difficulties are overcome by common effort.
 Selection of Books
 A poor choice of books will produce poor results.  The corp com-
 mittee selected five, one of which is to be chosen by the student.  The
 five are as follows:
 a.  Corps Principles and Constitution.  Tests showed that many
 persona were ignorant about the nature and function of the corps.  All
 but 5 percent of the membership did not know how to apply the conditions
 for new members.  Corps members should know what the corps is and what
 it demands of its members.
 b.  On Practice, by Mao Tse-tung; prepared for cadres and ad-
 vanced students.                                                        It demands learning correct ideology and activity, and
 is valuable for the Peking University group.

 ignorance as to who led the fi ht  -                 ''ueen zo combat
 g   against Japan and as to the need of
 opposing the rearmament of Japan.
 d.  Violent Wind and Rain [The Storm], a novel.  Some corps
 membeis and student, particularly those from landowners' homes, still
 have a false view of land reform, and some think it can be done peace-
 fully.                                                            This book was chosen to show the complexity of the class struggle
 and the reactionary character of the landlord class.
 e.  My Son.  This gives the recollections of a Soviet mother,
 K'o-hsieh-fa-ya, about her son, Ao-li-ko, a hero who belonged to the
 youth home guards.  This vivid book contains good material for teaching
 patriotism and hatred of enemies.
 Individual study must be spontaneous, directed at self-
 improvement through knowledge of the struggle, conducted with awareness,
 and aimed at developing the ability to think independently.   It should
 not be a pastime.   Self-reliance is the key.  The Peking University
 committee tried to organize individual study, but within 2 days the
 program had failed because many refused to take the initiative.  Only
 by renewed effort was such study started again and the problems attacked.
 As to procedure, there must be planning and freedom. A reading
 list is prepared, from which the student picks one book according to his
 needs and interests.  A time limit is set for reading the book.  The
 student sets his own pace but not carelessly.  Thus spontaneous action
 and economy of effort are preserved.
 The crucial question for the leaders is that of conformity in
 thinking.  Difficult problems of ideology must be settled through con-
 ferences or reports.                                                                   Thus, worthwhile conclusions can be reached.
 Results and Persisting Problems
 In 40 days, most of the 1,100 students carried out individual
 study; at the end, they took tests or evaluated themselves.  All had
 gained; ideology was improved and study habits formed.  The method had
 proved itself; cadres were trained and activist., were discovered.
 In choosing books, the beginners liked the stories and profited
 by them.  Later they were introduced to doctrinal works.  However, Mao's
 On Practice proved too difficult; simpler texts should be used.
 This experiment in individual study spread throughout the university.
 However, the ideological leadership was inadequate.  Readers of Mao's
 On Practice, hearing Comrade Ai Ssu-ch'i expound its doctrines, felt its
 scope was too wide, and found it hard to relate to reality.   The co,r:,
 committee held a conference on the matter, but the experiences brought
 forward were so narrow and personal that many persons  could not link
 themselves fully with China's revolution.  Theory overbalancea practical
 work.

 When I began as a study guide, I was afraid to stand on a plat-
 form, let alone try to teach.  Th' corps branch cared little about corps
 studies. Cadres refused to come to class, clu_ming they already under-
 stood; corps members came or not as they pleased; and the lessons were
 crude.
 This experiment is now being studied by the univeristy corps com-
 mittee with a view to further extension among corps members.

 Hua Yu-chl
 1.  From Lack of Faith to Confidence
 The first lesson was on opposition to the arming of japan by the
 US.      I was ill-prepared, and the lesson produced no response.  The stu-
 dents looked on me as a mere machine, relaying what I found in books.
 They were bored, and I was discouraged.
 Then I thought of my task as part of a large, worthy project.
 Despite difficulties, I could learn and get help from others.
 revived and I began to improve,                                     courage
 guided by reactions from the masses.
 I have since lectured frequently, with good results.  I am not
 afraid and have confidence in my work.  The secret lies in continual
 self-improvement and avoiding pride.
 2.           Experiences With Corps Lessons
 a.  Preparation -- A teacher must know his subject well.  Even
 the simplest subjects must be mastered. Such thorough preparation is of
 the utmost importance.
 Methods of preparation are as follows:  (1) Catch the spirit
 of the lesson; (2) decide on what elements to emphasize; (3) understand
 what the common man thinks he has gained since the liberation; (4) grasp
 the chief questions in the mind of the audience so that you may have a
 target; and (5) in cove of doubt or question, discuss the matter with
 party or corps leaders.
 Use illustrations.  For instance, to explain that the
 Chinese Communist Party is the political party of the Chinese working
 class, contrast the hard conditions of the worker before the liberation
 with his present status now.  Formerly a man hated being recognized as a
 mill worker and would try to disguise himself; now he is master in his
 own house and works hard.  Workers now have night schools, can learn to
 read, and can understand national affairs.  The Communist Party has
 brought these benfits.
 b.   Use Subdivisions under a main heading -- For example, in
 explaining that the Chinese Communist Party is the founder of the Youth
 Corps, there should be three topics:   (1) The Chinese Communist Party is
