 rapidly in the next two years than at anytime in the past. The Communist
 Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its military arm, the New People's
 Army (NPA), have seized the initiative in the countryside and are
 preparing to bring their revolution to Manila. The insurgents have not,
 however, been seriously contested militarily or politically by the govern-
 ment. This absence of sustained counterinsurgent pressure has allowed the
 Communists a free hand in many areas of the country and has left their po-
 tential vulnerabilities unexploited.
 Party leaders are pursuing a dual military and political strategy aimed at
 achieving a stalemate on the battlefield while forming a broad political
 alliance with the anti-Marcos opposition. The party is in a strong position
 to gain politically from the malaise now prevalent throughout Philippine
 society and the government's unwillingness to undertake political and
 economic reforms. Party leaders hope to seize power by joining with the
 moderate opposition in a post-Marcos coalition government they intend.to
 dominate. To this end, they plan to participate in the 1986 nationwide
 elections and support candidates whom they can co-opt.
 The Communists have assembled an extensive and sophisticated clandes-
 tine political/military organization over the last 16 years that is waging
 protracted guerrilla war along 56 to 60 fronts nationwide, effectively
 controlling villages inhabited by at least 5 million people, and contesting

 has become a credible military force that is rapidly gaining
 experience and confidence and is capable of fielding guerrilla battalions
 in many parts of the country. NPA attacks against the government are
 characterized by effective command and control, secure communications,
 good intelligence, sound guerrilla tactics, and effective adaptation 'to the
 Philippine environment.
 The Communists are sensitive to the misgivings of many Filipinos about
 uniting with Marxist revolutionaries. Consequently, their propaganda-a
 clever mixture of Marxism, Catholic liberation theology, and traditional
 Philippine values-is careful to emphasize the nationalist aspects of their
 struggle. They frequently cite Nicaragua as an example of a revolution in
 which Marxist-Leninists combined with a moderate opposition to success-
 fully overthrow a dictator. Popular support for the Marcos government is
 at an alltime low, and party propagandists are exploiting this to their
 advantage.
 Despite its formidable organization and successful performance, the
 CPP/NPA has weaknesses. A charismatic leader capable of galvanizing
 popular support for the revolution has yet to appear, its anti-American
 rhetoric rings hollow with many Filipinos, and the party's emphasis on
 nationalism over Communism has drawn to its banner many individuals
 lacking in ideological commitment. However, the most serious CPP/NPA
 liability is the absence of a reliable logistic pipeline to provide arms,
 ammunition, and other war materiel to the guerrillas. Although a small
 number of weapons are now being smuggled into the Philippines by the
 NPA, we believe the guerrillas lack the equipment to sustain an offensive
 of even a week's duration and the combined-arms capability required to
 attack well-defended military targets. The Communists have so far
 eschewed foreign support, and the isolated character of the Philippines
 severely complicates establishing a reliable logistic network or foreign
 Although
 extensive cooperation between the Communists and the Muslim Moro
 National Liberation Front (MNLF) could help ease this problem, we
 believe there is little prospect for more than token cooperation between
 them.

 Scope Note           This assessment is intended to serve as a model for analyzing the
 organization and capabilities of a politically organized insurgency. In this
 case, we examine a well-developed insurgent organization, the Communist
 Party of the Philippines; its military arm, the New People's Army; and
 united front activities that attempt to mask the radical nature of the
 movement and broaden its appeal. The paper does not systematically

 Communist Insurgency in the
 Philippines: Organization
 and Capabilities
 Since its founding in 1968, the Communist Party of
 the Philippines (CPP) and its military element, the
 New People's Army (NPA), have consistently demon-
 strated slow but steady growth. During the past two
 years, they have taken advantage of increasing popu-
 lar discontent with the Marcos government to swell
 their ranks. The NPA now aggressively attacks the
 government's Armed Forces, increasing both the
 number and sophistication of tactical operations,
 while the party maneuvers to seize political power in a
 post-Marcos government. This paper reviews the par-
 ty's political and military strategy and examines
 current insurgent organization, capabilities, and per-
 formance.
 Yenan; they believed to do so was only to invite
 government offensives that the CPP/NPA could not
 hope to repel. Instead, guerrilla fronts were initiated
 throughout the Philippines-especially on the larger
 islands that would provide easy escape and conceal-
 ment
 In 1981 party leaders decided that with the lifting of
 martial law the time was ripe to reactivate the urban
 underground that had been decimated by government
 security forces. Urban guerrilla units, dormant since
 1972, were reactivated in Mindanao to assassinate
 government supporters and demonstrate the perva-
 siveness of the CPP/NPA. Urban united front activi-
 ties, whose purpose is to broaden the base of support
 25X1
 25X1
 for the revolution, have since mushroomed in an      25X1
 attempt to win over the Philippine middle class,
 largely alienated from the government following the
 Aquino assassination.
 The CPP/NPA has most closely followed the political
 and guerrilla strategy of protracted revolutionary
 warfare developed by Mao Zedong and articulated by
 party founder Jose Maria Sison in documents still
 used in teaching all party members. As in Mao's
 revolution, the Communist insurgency in the Philip-
 pines emphasizes the importance of building a base of
 support in the countryside among the peasant popula-
 tion. It also has an urban component, however, that is
 increasing in size and importance. All NPA military
 activity is controlled by the Communist Party's politi-
 cal leadership, which has generally stressed organiza-
 tion and recruitment over direct military action. The
 Communists' military strategy is complemented by a
 political program in which party members and front
 groups work to undermine the Marcos government
 and legitimize their own organization.
 Commu-
 nist leaders have also demonstrated an ability to adapt
 Maoist strategy to the geography and politics of the
 Philippines. Following setbacks in 1972 in the Caga-
 yan Valley, the leadership decided. not to establish
 permanently liberated zones in imitation of Mao in
 Another of the Communists' strategies is to achieve
 political power by presenting themselves as national-
 ists and joining with the moderate opposition in a
 post-Marcos coalition government. This is now evi-
 dent from Embassy reporting and the public state-
 ments of party-controlled front organizations that

 now actively promote this concept. Tobroaden its
 popular appeal, the party frequently-cites Nicaragua
 as an example of a revolution in which both Marxist-
 Leninists and a moderate opposition successfully
 united to overthrow a dictator. The Sandinista regime
 is portrayed as a state where the Christian plea for
 social justice has been realized. In our judgment, this
 analogy particularly appeals to many Filipino Catho-
 lics who oppose the Marcos regime but have misgiv-
 ings about uniting with Communist revolutionaries.
 The newly formed organization, Bayan (the Nation),
 is the Communists' latest attempt to portray party
 willingness to join forces with moderates in a
 coalition.
 The party's consolidation plan is another aspect of
 CPP strategy, which though not well publicized is
 taught to all cadres. According to Sison's writings,
 once the Communists come to power they plan a
 subsequent "socialist revolution" to consolidate Com-
 munism in Philippine society. Although united front
 tactics and coalition government proposals are expedi-
 ent now in forging a broad alliance, once the People's
 Democratic Republic of the Philippines has been
 established the party alone will be responsible for
 transforming the society into a "proletarian dictator-
 ship." Presumably, at this time the "blood debt to the
 people" owed by the landlord class will be avenged. F
 Party strategists maintain that theirs is an "unfin-
 ished revolution." The Communists insist that the
 Philippine people were never really liberated-not in
 February 1945 or July 1946 nor, for that matter, in
 1898. They were simply transferred from Spanish, to
 American, to Japanese, and then, following the grant-
 ing of nominal independence, to neocolonial domina-
 tion. The United States is now .identified as the
 principal enemy of the Philippine people, and Presi-
 dent Marcos is depicted as a puppet carrying out the
 mandates of Washington. We believe the anti-Ameri-
 can rhetoric may ring hollow with many. Filipinos, but
 the appeal to nationalism "and independence from
 foreign dictates does not.
 We believe the Communists recognize that they lack
 the capability to defeat the government militarily and
 would settle for a stalemate on the battlefield.  ~
 It is in the political sphere that we believe the
 Communists, now see their most advantageous pros-
 pects. Our analysis `of.Embassy reporting leads us to
 believe that, to exploit the vulnerabilities of the
 Marcos regime, the CPP is skillfully maneuvering for
 a role in any, government that might be formed should
 the President die in office and is actively promoting
 the concept of a coalition government in which it
 would legally participate. In a switch from its previous
 position advocating a boycott of elections, the 25X1
 CPP/NPA also intends to actively participate in the
 1986 nationwide local elections.
 The Insurgent Organization and Capabilities
 25X1
 25X1
 To implement their strategy, the Philippine Commu-
 nists have assembled an effective, clandestine politi-
 cal-military organization that wages protracted guer-
 rilla war along 56 to 60 fronts nationwide, effectively
 controls villages-inhabited by at least 5 million people,
 and contests control of villages inhabited by another
 5.5 million. For the purpose of this paper, we use the
 term Communist-controlled village to mean areas
 where:
 ? A Communist "shadow government" has been
 established.
 ? Communist peasant, women, and youth associations   25X1
 are functioning.
 ? Most of the population is sympathetic and gives
 material support to the insurgents.
 ? At least 50 percent of the population can be mobi-
 lized for protest actions.
 ? NPA militia units may be present

 The CPPH                            His a tight-
 ly knit organization led by professionals who are well
 trained and highly disciplined. The National Demo-

 the Marcos government.
 The Communists' organizational model-with its par-
 allel party, united front, and military echelons-is
 very similar to other Communist insurgent organiza-
 tions we have seen during the last 50 years. Neither
 the party organization itself, the distinctive organiza-
 tional practices it follows, the subsidiary organizations

 The Party
 As with all Communist parties, the CPP/NPA is
 under the firm control of a small number of highly
 dedicated leaders, or cadres, who make all important
 decisions regarding ideology, strategy, and manage-
 ment of the party. These cadres form the Central
 Committee. the Executive Committee, and the Polit-

 committee and higher level NPA commands, and
 united front activities are directed by a similar inter-
 locking command structure. Such a system of com-
 mand and control provides local flexibility in imple-
 menting orders from above.
 The CPP is organized along both territorial and
 functional lines and, since 1984, by rural and urban
 responsibilities as well. Six Regional Commissions,
 each headed by a Central Committee member, were
 created in the 1980s to cope with the geographic
 spread of the party and to ensure that all subordinate
 committees operate in accordance with the party line
 set by the Central Committee. Five functional com-
 missions oversee party activities in the areas of propa-
 ganda, military affairs, united front activities, and
 "mass movement" organizations.
 Since its founding, the CPP has stressed organization-
 al efforts and recruitment in rural areas rather than
 military activities.

 KM after a careful assessment and become eligible
 for party membership at age 18.
 The United Front
 In our view, united front organizing has heretofore
 been the weak link in this Communist insurgency.
 The party's efforts to form a broad alliance of Filipi-
 nos opposed to the Marcos government have suffered
 setbacks repeatedly. In addition to an ideological bias
 favoring rural organization and a reluctance of many
 Filipinos to join a Communist movement, the long
 period of martial law (1972-8 1) made all overt opposi-
 tion activities very difficult. Since 1979, government
 security forces have captured or killed many key
 cadres connected with these efforts: Sixto Carlos,
 Horacio Morales, Isagani Serrano, Edgar Jopson, and
 Mila Aguilar Roque.

 Sons and daughters live to set them free.

 accomplished by clandestine cells of three to five

 guide the 12-point program contained in the NDF
 manifesto of 1 January 1973. In urban areas, the

 The New People's Army
 The NPA is a military organization characterized by
 effective leadership and operational security, sound
 command and control, and strict discipline. The NPA
 is made up of both full-time regulars and part-time
 irregulars. We estimate that there are now probably
 about 15,000 to 16,500 regulars organized in infantry
 battalions and urban guerrilla units. Local guerrilla
 units and village militia make up the irregulars,
 estimate at between 15,000 and
 Regular Units-Regular Mobile Forces. The Regular
 Mobile Forces are 'the best trained, equipped, and
 organized guerrillas. These uniformed forces are re-

 bushes. NPA regulars operate at three levels-dis-
 trict, guerrilla front, and regional-under the
 direction of the respective party committees.
 Main Regional Guerrilla Units (MRGUs) and Sec-
 ondary Regional Guerrilla Units (SRGUs) are each
 equivalent to a regular company of the Armed Forces
 of the Philippines and normally confine operations to
 the 56 to 60 guerrilla fronts now active throughout the
 country. According to Embassy reporting, the MRGU
 is a mobile force that can link up anytime with an
 SRGU, forming a combined force to conduct guerrilla
 operations in the latter's area. Within the past.two
 years, the NPA has frequently combined such forces
 to successfully attack poorly defended government
 targets. MRGUs in Mindanao can now field 200 to
 300 men (and in Northeast Mindanao, an additional
 squad armed with four M60 machineguns), but units
 of this size are still in their formative stages in most
 regions. Operations involving 100 to 200 guerrillas are
 the norm throughout the rest of the country.

 Key Insurgent Strengths
 The CPP/NPA organizational infrastructure is now
 firmly in place and growing. Moreover, its perfor-
 mance over the past several years has been impressive.
 Embassy reporting of CPP/NPA activities and our
 analysis                              reveal
 strengths in a number of key areas that combine to
 make these insurgents a formidable opponent:
 ? Coherent ideology. The party has a coherent, well-
 articulated ideology that emphasizes nationalism
 and anti-imperialism. First articulated by Jose Ma-
 ria Sison, the CPP through its publications and
 courses presents a program that combines Marxism-
 Leninism and Catholic liberation theology, all in the
 guise of traditional Philippine nationalism.
 ? Effective political leadership. Through the Politbu-
 ro, the Executive Committee, and the Central Com-
 mittee, the CPP provides strong direction to subor-
 dinate cadres nationwide. Effectiveness can be
 judged by the absence of factionalism and-with
 one exception-high-level defections, and the mini-
 mal effects on operations caused by the capture of
 senior cadres.
 ? Patience. Aware of the Huk's premature switch to
 conventional warfare, party literature repeatedly
 stresses the protracted nature of this revolution to
 prepare followers for an indeterminate period of
 guerrilla warfare. We believe the party is quick to
 learn from mistakes and has been content to work
 slowly but steadily at establishing a popular base of
 support in the countryside:
 ? Strong command and control. The CPP/NPA fol-
 lows the standard Marxist-Leninist policy of "Dem-
 ocratic Centralism." This policy provides consider-
 able autonomy to local leadership as long as they
 adhere to Central Committee directives. Senior
 cadres are frequently reassigned,
 is strict and very effective.

 Is This Really a Communist Revolution?
 ? Sound guerrilla tactics. The NPA effectively uses
 classic guerrilla tactics and demonstrates a good
 military combat capability. Over the last several
 years, the NPA has cautiously escalated the number
 of operations to provide combat experience for
 guerrillas with minimal risks.
 ? Effective use of environment. The CPP/NPA has
 focused guerrilla activity in areas where the terrain
 provides cover and escape. As early as 1974, Sison
 saw the insular nature of the Philippines as a
 potential asset for the insurgents. He realized that
 the growth of guerrilla fronts on all the larger
 islands would stretch thin the capabilities of the
 Armed Forces while making it almost impossible to
 defeat the CPP/NPA in any one campaign.
 ? Popular support. Both the party and the NPA have
 demonstrated an ability to recruit and to mobilize
 the population in support of their cause. While
 coercion is sometimes used,
 any people voluntarily cooperate with
 the insurgents at considerable risk of government
 retribution.
 ? Fffective propaganda. The CPP has infiltrated
 man o  osition or anizations
 to secure
 avorable coverage or its cause an  iscredit the
 Marcos government and the Armed Forces. This
 covert propaganda campaign has been effective both
 in the Philippines and abroad.
 ? Momentum. The CPP/NPA has gradually built a
 momentum-a combination of its own initiative and
 government inaction-that could take years to re-
 verse.
 Analysts are divided over the degree of commitment
 to Communism of NPA guerrillas, party sympathiz-
 ers, the rural population living in areas now con-
 trolled by the CPP/NPA, and the population at large.
 Some analysts believe that many, if not most, of these
 people may be cooperating with the insurgents be-
 cause of human rights abuses by the military, griev-
 ances against the Marcos government, or the lack of
 improvement in rural standards of living. The issue is
 central to US concerns because, like the Sandinistas
 in Nicaragua, the commitment to Marxist-Leninist-
 Mao Zedong ideology will largely determine whether
 the Philippines would become a Communist state
 should the revolution succeed. It also affects the
 effort required to dissi ate support for revolution and
 defeat the insurgency.
 hardcore
 CPP/NPA members are ideologically committed'
 Communists who are determined to bring a Marxist
 government to power-even if they have to impose it
 from the top. Moreover, in areas controlled by the
 party, there are indications that some people cooper-
 ate voluntarily, not just out of fear. Although we
 cannot gauge the attitudes of most rural dwellers, we
 believe that the longer an area is under Communist
 control-and we estimate that at least 5 million
 people now live in CPP/NPA-controlled areas-the
 stronger the popular commitment to the party and the
 revolution is likely to become. However, the party is
 sensitive to the lack of strong commitments to any
 ideology on the part of most Filipinos and the
 peasants' almost exclusive concerns with local issues.
 Thus, the party stresses anti-Marcos themes, nation-
 alism, land reform, and abuses by the military while
 downplaying Communist rhetoric (appendix CJ

 Despite their extensive organization and the strengths
 their performance has shown, the CPP/NPA has a

 Secret
 Beyond the absence of a reliable logistic pipeline to
 support a guerrilla war, other CPP/NPA weaknesses
 include:
 ? No foreign sanctuary. The Philippines is geographi-
 cally isolated-a situation almost unique in the
 world-and neither Malaysia nor Indonesia, the
 nearest countries, will permit Communist insurgent
 bases on their soil. The CPP has so far used the
 island's environment to their advantage by forcing
 the government to confront them on several fronts
 and by establishing bases in remote mountainous
 terrain found throughout the Philippines. However,
 should the government's counterinsurgent effort in-
 tensify, the Communists-like the Huks of 30 years
 ago-could find their lack of sanctuary a serious
 liability.
 ? Penchant for paperwork. The Communists keep
 detailed records and files that are regularly discov-
 ered when cadres are captured at their homes or
 safehouses. When compromised, such information
 provides government security forces with a better
 understanding of the insurgent organization, mem-
 bership, and plans.
 ? No charismatic leader. The CPP/NPA has no one
 of the stature of Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, or
 Fidel Castro. The Central Committee and senior
 cadres in prison are virtually unknown to the public.
 Were a popular non-Communist leader-with the
 charisma of Magsaysay-to emerge in the post-
 Marcos era, he might attract considerable popular
 support away from the Communists.

 ? Anti-American rhetoric. Party propaganda portrays
 the United States as an imperialist nation and the
 sole prop supporting the Marcos government. But
 we believe America and Americans are favorably
 regarded by most Filipinos, and this propaganda
 rings hollow.
 ? Non-Communist elements in the NPA. In the at-
 tempt to stress nationalism over Communism, the
 party appears to have accepted under its banner
 many individuals who have a grudge against the
 government but lack ideological commitment to
 Communism. In Kalinga Apayao, several hundred
 guerrillas belonging to an ethnic minority recently
 defected from the NPA but continue to war against
 the government. Similarly, in Palawan the
 CPP/NPA has not been able to establish a front
 because of the activities of a renegade NPA band,
 according to Embassy reports.
 ? No combined-arms capability. The NPA has dem-
 onstrated an ability to use small-unit guerrilla tac-
 tics effectively but to date has not used combined
 arms-the coordination of different types of mili-
 tary units-in its operations. Should the Commu-
 nists decide to attack well-defended military instal-
 lations, they will find it necessary to use direct and
 indirect fire from machine guns and mortars to
 support their assault force.
 NPA Military Performance
 Analysis of CPP/NPA-initiated actions from 1973
 through January 1985 reveals that the level of insur-
 gent activity has increased steadily over the last
 decade with a significant upsurge in 1984-80 per-
 cent of the more than 5,000 violent incidents were
 initiated by the NPA in 1984. Last year there were 12
 times more violent incidents than 10 years earlier and
 107 percent more than in 1983. Much of this sudden
 increase last year occurred during two months-in
 January, when there was a national plebiscite, and in
 May, when parliamentary elections were held.

 NPA units nationwide now regularly attack military
 targets, and, in our judgment, the guerrillas have
 gradually gained the combat experience and confi-
 dence necessary to sustain the revolution's momen-
 tum. In 1984 NPA raids and ambushes involving 100
 to 200 guerrillas became more common in most
 regions of the Philippines, especially in Mindanao and
 weakly defended targets in such numbers, the NPA is
 virtually assured a tactical and propaganda victory.
 Most guerrilla-initiated military activity is focused on
 assassinations and assaults upon individuals to acquire

 There are few immediate rewards the Communists
 can offer poor, indifferent farmers to gain their active
 support. In China and Vietnam, the Communists
 enacted land reform in areas they controlled during
 the revolution. This is occurring in the Philippines,
 but details rarely surface. In 1982, however, a party
 propagandist claimed that the CPP land reform
 program had already directly benefited 44,000 people
 in the Cagayan Valley of Northeastern Luzon. Al-
 though such claims cannot be accepted at face val-

 In assessing insurgent capabilities and prospects over
 the next two years, four variables will be critical: the
 performance of the Philippine Armed Forces and
 government, popular support, the role of the Catholic
 Church, and foreign arms supplies:
 ? The guerrillas' prospects are largely dependent on
 whether the Philippine Government and the Armed
 Forces can initiate meaningful political, economic,
 and military reforms to regain the initiative and
 reverse a rapidly deteriorating situation.
 ? Popular support will be critical because it directly
 affects CPP/NPA ability to recruit and retain
 combatants, maintain momentum, and convince
 skeptical middle-class urban dwellers that the fu-
 ture of the country lies with them.
 ? The increasing alienation of Catholic priests and
 nuns from the government and their support for
 radical change is providing increased credibility and
 legitimacy to the Communist Party's appeal.

 Party efforts to join ranks with the MNLF insurgents
 have not, and probably will not, succeed. The MNLF
 is beset with defections, financial problems, and fac-
 tionalism along ethnolinguistic lines. Nur Misuari,
 leader of the largest and most radical group, the
 Tausug Muslims,
 We believe the Communist insurgency has the poten-
 tial to grow more rapidly during the next two years
 than at any time in the past. The Communist Party is
 now in a strong position to benefit from the malaise
 prevalent throughout Philippine society: popular sup-
 port for the Marcos government is at an alltime low;
 the record of the last few years leads us to conclude
 that the prospects for meaningful political reforms
 under this regime are slight; the military's response to
 urban terror by the NPA is to step up extralegal
 killings, which further damages its reputation; and the
 economic crisis is expected to erode standards of
 living further in the next two years. Given the Armed
 Forces' lack of logistics, their poor leadership, and the
 politicized nature of the officer corps, it is unlikely
 that the military's performance will improve enough
 to stem increased NPA activity. The elections planned
 for 1986 and 1.987 are likely to be the most conten-
 tious and violent in Philippine history-probably driv-
 ing more people into the ranks of the Communist
 Party.
 The NPA probably will grow in numbers, gradually
 escalate military actions, and improve its military
 tactics to include assaults against well-defended tar-
 gets and night operations. If present trends continue
 unchecked, government forces may soon be forced to
 .cede de facto control of the rural highlands to the
 Communists in many regions of the country. But the
 Communists cannot hope to defeat the Armed Forces
 in the near future and will be unable to sustain an
 offensive of even a few weeks' duration without
 substantially more arms and ammunition than they
 now possess.
 If party leaders have been able to arrange for weapons
 purchases abroad, as now seems likely, they must also
 arrange for numerous clandestine arms deliveries to
 various islands in the archipelago. We believe it will
 be difficult, but not impossible, to sustain such a
 logistic pipeline over time; as the deliveries increase,
 interdiction could become easier.
 commands itt e

 Communist propaganda aimed at the Muslim com-
 munity has not been able to overcome longstanding
 Christian-Muslim hatreds. Although Misuari may
 help arrange arms purchases for the NPA, we believe
 there will be little cooperation between the two insur-
 gent groups in the next two years. Moreover, as the
 NPA increases activity in MNLF areas of operations
 in Mindanao and presents a threat to established
 MNLF extortion activities, there will be even more
 friction and enmity between the rival insurgent
 Support for the party by Catholic clergy and nuns is
 growing, largely because of human rights abuses by
 the Constabulary, police, and Civilian Home Defense
 Forces. If alienated, nuns and priests would provide a
 highly dedicated and professional work force for party
 and united front activities. Father Balweg, a rebel
 priest and NPA commander, is now a popular folk
 hero. Analogies between the Philippines and Nicara-
 gua-where the revolution succeeded in toppling the
 Somoza dictatorship with the assistance of religious
 radicals-are becoming more common in the Philip-
 pines. We believe government attempts to isolate
 religious radicals and regain the support of priests and
 nuns will be futile without military reforms to curtail
 abuses of the population.

 Threat to US Military Facilities
 We do not consider the principal threat to US bases in
 the Philippines to be military. Rather, party propa-
 ganda opposing American use of the Clark and Subic
 bases aims to make continued US use of the bases
 politically untenable for any future government. Party
 propaganda decries "US imperialism" and cites the
 presence of US military facilities on Philippine soil as
 the most visible manifestation of America's imperial-
 ist intentions and an affront to Philippine sovereignty.
 Repeated use of this propaganda theme over the last
 decade has helped polarize most opposition politicians.
 Today, those who do not oppose the bases are accused
 of being unpatriotic and "tools of the CIA." To avoid
 such charges, any successor government may have to
 demand either renegotiation of the bases agreement
 on terms more favorable to the Philippines or the
 abrogation of the agreement.
 A direct military attack on one of the bases is
 possible-and threats of military or terrorist action
 have been received-but the NPA is much more
 likely to selectively target US personnel or attempt to
 place bombs in US installations. Direct assaults
 against the bases by guerrilla units in the near future
 would be counterproductive and costly. The NPA
 leadership is aware of their limited firepower, lack of
 fire support, and the difficulty of secretly massing

 Chronology of Key Events
 Three Franciscan priests-Fathers Burgos, Gomez, and Tamora-executed by the
 Spanish colonial government for inciting the Cavite Mutiny. Catholics in the CPP
 refer to the historical precedent of these "martyrs" in justifying the involvement of
 religious in the Communist revolution.
 1880-1890s              "Propaganda Movement" initiated by a small group of intelligentsia to introduce
 ideas of European liberalism, including national self-determination into the
 Philippines. This movement set the stage for the revolution of 1896 and a
 precedent for a "second propaganda movement" to revise Communist ideology
 (that is, Sison's attempt to introduce Maoist principles into the PKP) in the 1960s.
 Insurgency against the Spanish colonial government begins following the execution
 of the novelist, physician, and political thinker Jose Rizal by the Spanish. The
 insurgency is started by Andres Bonifacio-regarded as a "proletarian hero" by
 the Communists-who had organized workers in the slums of Manila.
 1899-1902               Following the surrender of the Spanish in the Spanish-American War, the United
 States wages massive counterinsurgency effort against the guerrilla forces of
 Emilio Aguinaldo. 150,000 US soldiers fought the guerrillas; more than 4,000
 were killed. The Communists today portray themselves as the standard bearers of
 the 1896 "unfinished" revolution.
 7 November 1930         Communist Party of the Philippines (PKP) established by Crisanto Evangelista.
 Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon-Hukbalahap (Anti-Japanese People's Army),
 the armed wing of the PKP, wages guerrilla war against the Japanese in Central
 Luzon.
 PKP wages armed insurgency in Central Luzon against the Philippine Govern-
 ment. The guerrilla organization crumbles with the surrender of leader Luis Taruc
 in May 1954.
 30 November 1964         Kabataang Makabayan (Nationalist Youth) (KM) founded by Jose Maria Sison
 and other young PKP radicals to lead the movement to revitalize the PKP known
 now as the "Second Propaganda Movement." By 1966 the KM claimed 10,000
 members throughout the Philippines.
 11 September 1967        League of Filipino Students, a front organization for the KM, founded ostensibly
 to protest rising school tuition fees.

 "Nine independent unions and a number of small workers' groups" unite to form
 the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (Alliance of Filipino Workers) (BMP), a
 CPP-infiltrated labor organization. A Catholic "workers' mass" is held to mark
 the occasion.
 Marcos government reestablishes diplomatic relations with the People's Republic

 October 1975               The CPP-infiltrated labor group, BMP, leads a workers' strike at La Tondena
 Corp. distillery to test a government proclamation forbidding strikes in essential
 industries. Workers seize the factory, 400 are arrested, and three days later the
 government allows management to grant the workers' demands. Before the year
 ended, workers in 26 major firms went on strike. The BMP had reportedly grown
 to 130 unions with some 80,000 members.
