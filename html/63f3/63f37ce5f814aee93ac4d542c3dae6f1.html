 On both occasions the TASS men reacted to suggestions that at the
 USSR's talk about peace was only propaganda by replying that might appear before the UN General Assembly in Paris to pve the
 f  ov?et proposals for peace and disarmament,
 Comment,  Reports of earlier conversations with Zhukov indicated
 that he was probing for well-informed opinion regarding US policies of
 particular interest to the Soviet Government, such as US rearmament and
 the significance of the MacArthur affair for American policy in the Far
 East.
 Zhukov has recurrently made references to Stalin-Truman meetings
 or some form of bilateral talks that could occur at the time of multi-
 lateral conferences.  However, during this period the Soviet Government
 has disregarded opportunities to explore confidential approaches made
 by the United States.

 Stalin has consistently declined to meet Western representatives
 outside the USSR or Eastern Europe, the most recent example being his
 refusal in February 1949 to meet President Truman in Washington.
 3.           Moscow press asserts Kirk?s statements contradicted by reality:
 On 20 October,, Literary Gazette published a lengthy article aimed at
 "disproving" Ambassador Kirk's recent statement to Vyshinsky regarding
 the absence of US aggressive aims against the USSR and others.  The
 article included reproduction of a map published in the 30 July issue
 of &wsweek, entitled "European Defenses; Missing Links in Mediter-
 ranean,," and it quoted a Newsweek statement that "US naval and air
 forces operating from land and air bases in Greece and Turkey
 could inflict powerful blows on the solar plexus of Russia."  The
 American "strategists", according to the Literary Gazette, considered
 "such 'Atlantic? governments as Greece and Turkey" as important links
 in their "system of military bases encircling the whole world."  The
 article asserted that this disproved "the alleged regional character
 of the Atlantic Pact."  (R Moscow 6a5, 22 Oct 51)
 Comments  Embassy officials suggest that the comment regarding
 the "regional" nature of the Atlantic Pact may be an advance indica-
 tion of the Soviet line at the UN General Assembly on this subject.
 Output of this type for domestic audiences furthers the Soviet "hate-
 America" campaign and is offered as "proof" that only the Kremlin
 strives for world peace.  Lest the peoples of the Orbit become lethargic
 as a result of daily Soviet assurances that their "peace campaign"
 will win world peace, Moscow periodically reminds them that they must
 be prepared to fight for peace.

 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.  Preparations for Moscow Economic Conference
 under strong leadership.- An AP dispatch from Moscow reported on
 24 October 1951 that Denmark had granted visas to a Soviet-delega-
 tion which is soon leaving for Copenhagen to discuss plans, with
 various international groups, for the Moscow International Economic
 Conference, now scheduled for December.  The delegation is headed by
 Vasili Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Soviet Central Trade Unions Council
 and a Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions.  Commun-
 ist leaders have hinted that important announcements on foreign trade
 and economic relations would emerge from the Moscow Conference.

 consented to attend the International Economic Conference in Moscow:
 Charles Schneider of Schneider-Creusot, the largest steel and munitions
 works in France; Rene Fould, President of Chantiers et Ateliers de
 -Saint Nazaire, shipbuilding and repair yards; Albert Metral, President of
 Ateliers, GSP, a machine tool com an ; Edouard Rastoin, President of the
 Marseilles Chamber of Commerce.
 Comments  French industrialists of this calibre have shown no
 previous sympathy for Communist aims, although Metral is known to have
 attended a meeting in Paris on 9 July called by the World Peace Council
 for the purpose of designating a French delegation to the Economic
 Conference.  Though invited,, it is not known whether they will actually
 attend this conference the true purpose of which must be clear to them.
 Western governments have considered the desirability of sending indi-,
 viduals who would make a public defense of Western policies,., but ap-
 parently no action along these lines has been taken.
 6.   ALBANIA.  Spy trial implicates Western powers.,  The trial of Albanian
 spies and diversionists, which began October 10 in Tirana, involves
 the alleged activities of the "American espionage service" accused of
 carrying out the hostile aims of Yugoslavia., Italy, Greece., and Great
 Britain.  The prosecutor claimes that some of the accused were agents
 who had been trained in Munich and parachuted into Albania by US
 planes flown by American or "satellite pilots" under the instructions
 of the Committee for Free Albania and Anglo-American intelligence in
 Italy.
 More than forty agents allegedly were parachuted into Albania in
 this manner, equipped with weapons, radio sets, identity cards., maps
 and gold coins..  They were supposed to engage in military and in-
 dustrial sabotage, contact exiled war criminals and other agents,
 murder members of the Albanian Government and Communist Party, and
 collect military information for transmittal by radio.  (U FBID ticker,
 16 Oct 51)
 Comments  Previous Albanian trials, while aimed against the Western
 powers, have failed to be as specific regarding details surrounding the
 accusations.

 -Premier Chervenkov and Vice Premier Poptomov have fallen into dis-
 favor are continuing; (4) a purge is quietly underway within the
 Bulgarian Army, and several ranking officers will be removed; (5) a
 new Minister of Interior will soon take office,
 25X1
 Comment? Titko Chernokolev was replaced as Minister of Agriculture
 on 23 June.  Nothing has since been heard concerning him, and it is
 possible that he may be under arrest.  Since early June persistent
 rumors have reported the arrest of General Trunski and the impending
 purge of Chervenkov, while some reports have also implicated Poptomov.
 Although the rumors concerning General Trunski may be correct,
 it would appear that the wide-spread reports concerning Chervenkov and
 Poptomov have no basis in facto  There is no reliable evidence to sup-
 port rumors concerning an impending purge in the Bulgarian Army or the
 replacement of Georgi Tsankov as Minister of Interior.
 8,     HUNGARY.  Third quarter plan results reveal shortcomings  The implemen-
 tation of the Five Year Plan for the third quarter of 1951 was reported
 by Hungarian officials to have been successful for the most part but
 with some significant failures.  Specifically heavy industry, and the
 building materials, construction, coal mining, food, rubber and timber
 industries failed to meet their quotas.  (R FBID, 23 Oct 51)
 ommenta  These industries also failed to meet their quotas for
 the second quarter of this year.  The workers continue to be blamed
 for the production failures.  According to Sandor Czottner Minister of
 Mines and Power, there is need for "a new Socialist work discipline, a
 new Socialist relationship between the miners and the managing officials,
 responsible individual leadership, and the adaptation of Soviet methods
 both in work and management."
 9,    YUGOSLAVIA.  Politburo member may be droppeda  A Yugoslav Politburo
 member, Frank Leskovsek, may soon be removed from his post according to
 25X1                     he US Embassy in Belgrade. Two close collaborators of
 eskovse .   ave been arrested, one for criticizing Yugoslavia?s eco-
 nomic policies and the other on charges of Cominformism.  These arrests
 suggest that Leskovsek?s recent removal from his governmental post was
 partly inspired by security considerations.  The Embassy believes that
 he and his collaborators are guilty of violating discipline by re-
 fusing to accept party decisions.  (C Belgrade 529, 22 Oct 51)

 within the Politburo over the government's policies on internal reforms
 and aid from the West.  The removal of Leskovsek from the Politburo
 would mark the first break in the top party leadership since the Tito-
 Cominform rift.                      A veteran party member and Politburo member since July
 194, Leskovsek is a labor leader and closely identified with the Yugo-
 slav industrialization program.  There is no evidence, however, that
 Leskovsek's removal would seriously disrupt the unity of the party.
 10.         Neutralism discussed gd; Zagreb Peace Congress:  The leftwing British
 delegate to the Zagreb Peace Congress Zilliacus, who was expelled from
 the British Labor Party for his extremist views, has drafted a resolu-
 tion which he hopes the Conference will adopt, stating in effect that
 national Communism, as exemplified by Yugoslavia, provides a basis on
 which to build peace in a world torn between warlike factions.
 Although this thesis will probably be stoutly contested by Ameri-
 cans and others at the Conference, Ambassador Allen states that
 "Zilliacus is being most active and may attract considerable support."
 The Yugoslav delegate in the keynote address apparently rejected
 neutralism and asserted that localized wars were no longer possible.
 He implied that a policy of neutrality was a snare and a delusion.
 Nevertheless, he deplored the tendency of the great powers to oppose
 the right of equality of the small nations. (C Belgrade 539, 23 Oct 51;
 U NY Times, 23 Oct 51)
 11.         Orbit diplomatic representation in Belgrade totals eighteen$  Ac-
 cording to an official publication of the Yugoslav Foreign Office, the
 USSR and its Satellites have a total of 18 diplomatic representatives
 in Belgrade.  The USSR has 8 representatives, Bulgaria 5, Rumania 3,
 Czechoslovakia 1, Poland 1, Hungary and Albania none.  Except for the
 US, Great Britain and France, none of the Western countries represented
 in Belgrade has more than 8 diplomatic representatives and the majority
 have less than 5 each.  The US has 31, Great Britain 20 and France 10.
 (R Belgrade Despatch 259, 13 Sep 51)
 Commenter  Total Orbit representation in Belgrade has decreased by
 4 since November 1950.  Orbit representation has gradually been reduced
 as part of the Cominform drive against Yugoslavia, but in no case have
 diplomatic relations been broken.  Hungary and Albania withdrew their
 representatives in 1949, but diplomatic relations were not formally
 severed.  Hungary will probably reassign a Charge to Belgrade soon.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.    INDONESIA. Government allegedly considering limiting movement of foreign
 t d las  wee   ha   he gov~-
 dip~_ _o_~~~m~~~at~~s s A fairly -reliable newspaper. repor e
 erninens considering the reciprocal limitation of the freedom of move-
 ment of foreign diplomats in Indonesia.  The paper gave "cabinet circles"
 as the source of the story.  Subsequent investigation by-the US Embassy
 indicated that the matter had not been discussed by the cabinet, but that
 the Indonesian Charge in Communist China, currently in Djakarta for a
 conference, had complained strongly to persons in government circles about
 restrictions imposed upon his movements in Peiping.  (C Djakarta 609,
 20 Oct 51)
 Comments  The Indonesian Government strongly resents the restrictions
 imposed upon its Charge?s activities in Peiping, but has indicated no in-
 tention either to protest those restrictions or to apply similar limita-
 tions upon the movements of Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel in
 Indonesia.
 20                Government coaxes Celebes villagers to  ay taxess  A broad-
 cast of the Indonesian Informs ion Ministry beamed                    o the  elebes stated
 in part, ",..lawless bands (in the Celebes) have gone beyond the limits.
 They have reportedly circulated pamphlets, exhorting the people to re-
 fuse to pay taxes to the government... Dear listeners, we realize that in
 our efforts to rehabilitate the country there must be a State conscious-
 ness and a desire to have a government.  This means...the duty to pay
 taxes to the government so that the rehabilitation of the country can be
 STAT       (completed)."  (R FBID            23 Oct 51)
 Comments The Muzakkar guerrillas, currently in rebellion against
 the cen tral government, may be trying to collect Celebes tax money for
 their own use.  However, with or without the exhortation of lawless
 bands, villagers throughout East Indonesia have resisted the payment.of
 taxes.   Their resentment of the Djakarta government continues to be one
 of the chief problems confronting the Ministry of Information.
 3.    INDOCHINA.  Shift in French Vietnamese relationship is indicated:  In an
 interview with Minister Hea h, Bao Dai s reseed  he importance,  or in-
 telligent Vietnamese patriots of cooperating with the French.  He was
 mildly critical of Premier Tran Van Huu and Dai Viet Party leader Nguyen
 Huu Tri, while praising General De Lattre to the point of calling him
 the "Joan of Are" of Vietnamo  Bao Dai stated that he looked for 'moral re-
 armament" as thw long-run means of defeating the Viet Minh.    He` :had'. hoped,
 but in vain,, that.thi,s,moral awakening would be accomplished through the^

 his hopes in the Catholics.      Meanwhile, other important events on the
 Vietnamese political scene were the emergence of Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen
 Van Hinh, son of Security Minister Nguyen Van Tam, as leading contender
 for the post of Chief of Staff of the Vietnam Army and the Vietnam Gov-
 ernmentvs interdiction of a provincial election which had been scheduled
 by a local administrator and military chief.  (S Saigon 892, 22 Oct 519
 C Saigon 895, 22 Oct 518 C Saigon 896, 22 Oct 51)
 Comments  Recent statements by General De Lattre indicate a rapproche-
 ment  a wean himself and Bao Dai at the expense of Huu, reversing the pat-
 tern which obtained several months ago.  De Lattre's visit to the Vatican
 on his recent return trip to Vietnam and the Joan of Arc comparison strength-
 en the suggestion that the French and Vietnamese authorities will make a
 stronger bid for the support of Vietnam's 1.5 million native Catholics.
 (Bao Dai has not in the past made the most of the fact that his wife is a
 Catholic.)  The appointment of Hinh as Chief of Staff will serve to check
 any decline of French influence over the Vietnam Government and its army,
 since Hinh is, like his father, a naturalized French citizen and is, more-
 over, a lieutenant colonel in the French Air Force.  This appointment cer-
 tainly does not reflect the will of the Vietnamese people.  The Vietnam
 Government's awareness of its unpopularity is indicated by its cancella-
 tion of election plans in one of the most secure areas of Vietnam,
 CHINA.  Mao Tse-tung claims "great success" for Peiping and "greatly in-
 rS aced'  o,e  s rents  Chinese Communist leader Mao Te-tong  sal
 Coc o ergo d the National Committee of the Chinese People's Politic
 Consultative Conference--a supposedly representative body which is a
 rubber stamp for the Peiping regime--that the regime's three-point domes-
 tic program for 1951 had achieved "great success," and that Soviet strength
 had "greatly increased."
 'Mao claimed that the Chinese people had "united unprecedentedly" be-
 hind the regime in its Korean venture, that land-reform would be completed
 "by 1952," and that "counter-revolutionary remnants" would soon be com-
 pletely eliminated.  Mao reaffirmed that the Chinese commitment in Korea
 "must continue" until the "US" agrees to a "peaceful settlement," and
 specified support for Chinese forces in Korea as the current "principal
 duty" of the Chinese people.
 He derided the West for failing to perceive that the era of "imper-
 ialist humiliation" of China has ended, and that the existence of.the
 Soviet bloc, particularly the Sino-Soviet alliance, ensures the "doom"
 of "imperialist domination" of the world as a whole.  Mao asserted that
 the strength of China's "most trustworthy and loyal ally," the USSR,
 has "greatly increased."  (R FBID flimsy, 23 Oct 51)

 Comment..  This speech is Mao's first major policy statement since
 June 175M-The 1950 address, prior to the outbreak of the Korean con-
 flict9 dealt primarily with China's long-range prospects..

 voluntary, that the behavior
 reform program unpopular, and that liquidation of alleged "counter-revolu-
 tionaries" will be a continuing feature of the regimes
 Mao's reaffirmation of Peiping's commitment in Korea follows the line
 of all other recent Communist comment on Korea, and does
 not alteration in Peiping's previous terms for a settlement or indicate Peiping's
 future course of actions

 9o KOREA.  Chinese Communist unit in eastmcentral.sector may be relievedn
 On  l October a Chinese Communist prisoner from the  O.rd Di visionD  8th
 Army was taken in the Kumsong area.  The prisoner reported that he had
 heard earlier in October that the Chinese Communist 20th Army (long in
 the Wonsan area) would replace elements of hi,s division and the entire
 67th Army.
 The Far East Command comments that the 67th Army has "established
 a poor combat record" and has suffered staggering losses as evidenced by
 the recent commitment of a division of the 68th Army to "bolster the sag-
 ging defense of the 67th."  (S CINCFE Telecon 5292, 24 Oct 51)
 Comments  While it is possible that the 20th, Army may relieve the
 badly battered 67th., its southward displacement has not yet been accepted
 by FECOM.

 detailed     it o  urea., shootings,, and neglect" of Comm in.ist prisoners.
 STAT     (R FBID             22 Oct 51)
 Comments  Propaganda of this nature serves a dual purpose in that
 it provides additional "charges" of UN-atrocities and serves to counter
 UN propaganda of the good treatment received by Communist prisoners.
 Recently taken prisoners have reported an intensified propaganda campaign
 among the front line units to discourage desertions.

 2.              Communists inspire strikes in German ports and plan Dutch
 Hoek strike'      Communist-instigated wildcat strikes have broken out
 in the key North German ports of Bremen and Hamburg.  In Bremen,
 city and union officials agree that 80 percent of the dockworkers are
 out only because they fear Communist strong-arm tactics.  Although
 the strikes are still confined to these two ports, they are rumored
 to be part of a long-range Communist program supported by a large
 fund from. East Germany.
 Meanwhile, other reports indicate that the Dutch Communist-
 controlled dockers' union is planning to stage a 24-hour strike in
 Amsterdam and Rotterdam..  The walk-out is to be based on demands for
 a ten percent wage increase and a Christmas bonus; its success will
 allegedly determine the advisability of attempting a general strike.

 Comment:  During the past several months there have been
 uncon ird reports of a possible wave of strikes throughout Western
 Europe this fall.
 Communist strength in the German dock areas traditionally has
 been great.  Communist influence in the Dutch dock areas has.declined
 since the failure of the 1950 appeal not to unload MDAP shipments.
 A 24-hour strike now would serve to test present Communist strength
 in the area.  No date for the Dutch strike. has been given,
 , Soviet attitude still unclear on seized Berlin district:
 Soviet authorities in Berlin on -72 October ordered the East German
 People's Police to withdraw from Steinstuecken, the small district
 in theUS sector of Berlin seized by People's Police units four
 days earlier.  Although the acting chief of,the new Soviet Control
 Commission in Berlin.explained to the US Commandant that the
 community would revert to its former status, he requested further
 documentation of the US claim to the sector.
 During the conversations, the Soviet representatives gave the
 impression that they wished to extricate themselves from the whole
 affair by shifting the blame to the East Germans,  In a later press
 statement, however, they stressed that the future status of the area
 would be studied by Soviet and US specialists.  (5 Berlin 611, 617,
 STAT      22 and 23 Oct 51; R FBIS          AFP, 24 Oct 51)
 Comment:  At the time the East Germans withdrew from
 Steinstuecken, the Allies were considering retaliatory action in the
 form of denying the Russians access to the important radio building
 which they now occupy in the British sector.  Despite indications that
 the USSR was backing down completely, an unconfirmed press dispatch
 now reports that a group of Soviet soldiers and People's Police
 returned to the area on 214 October.
 FRANCE.  German defense contribution may be delayed b  French stand:
 -.ice delegation To Allied discussions in London on a German financial
 contribution to Western defense warns that the French position on this
 subject threatens to "move back the entire timetable" for the conclusion
 of contractual relations with the Germans, the establishment of the
 European Defense Forces, and the raising of German units.  The US
 delegation recommends that some interim solution be worked'out, which
 it considers "entirely possible" despite French opposition.

 France is insisting that a common defense budget be applied by
 the European Defense organization from its inception and hence seems
 to contemplate a "much fuller working out and implementation" of
 financial arrangements than was envisaged by the US.
 Although the French question the need to have an agreed Allied
 position on a German financial contribution before the November NATO
 Council meeting in Rome, they will attempt to prepare estimates within
 ten days of the total European Defense Forces budget and an appropriate
 German contribution.  (S  London, 1995-1996, 23 Oct 51)
 Comment:  France had previously approved postponement by the
 Defense Conference of consideration of a budget, pending at least the
 initial results of the current NATO study of its members' potential
 defense contributions.
 The French estimate tentatively that the Federal Republic might
 contribute a total of 2,5 to 3 billion dollars to Western defense in
 order to match the efforts of the other European nations.  This would
 more than match the contribution of some nations, such as France, to
 the European Defense Forces, but would take into account the additional
 burden borne by France in Indochina and in maintaining a navy,
 AUSTRIA.  Russians still hold 781 Austrian citizens arrested since 195:
 The Austrian Federal Chancellor has informed the    Legation in Vienna
 that 781 Austrians who have been arrested by Soviet authorities during
 the, past six years have not yet been released.  The list of arrestees,
 which the Chancellor requested not be made public at the present time,,
 includes 120 persons whom the Soviets have acknowledged were apprehended
 and sentenced, and 661 persons whose arrest by the Soviet authorities is
 reasonably established but has not been acknowledged.  In those instances
 in which a reason for the Soviet detention has been ascertained, the
 alleged crimes include auto accidents, brawls with Soviet soldiers, Nazi
 activities, and distant family relationships to Hitler.  (S Vienna Desp.
 81, 17 Sep 51)
 Comment:  The report does not cover the unknown number of non-
 Austrians, primarily refugees, who have been arrested, detained, kidnapped,
 or otherwise apprehended by the Soviet authorities in Vienna.  No other
 action by the Soviet occupation forces has contributed more to their
 unpopularity than their frequent disregard of accepted procedures of
 arrest, prosecution, and fair trail.  The Austrian Government has
 repeatedly sought remedial action only to receive evasive replies.  Aside
 from the continuation of such kidnapping episodes,the Soviet authorities

 6,   BELGIUM.  Compromise averts general strike.  The Conseil Paritaire
 Genera e, a tripartite group of labor, government and industry leaders,
 has reached a settlement on the demands of the Socialist Trade Union
 Federation, thus averting the generalstrike scheduled for this week.
 The settlement, which is generous to labor, provides for a slight
 increase in the hourly wage, an extension of rent control, a decrease
 in the price of margarine and vegetables, and other benefits.  The
 federation has also gained .significant victory, by "embarrassing" the
 Catholic Trade Union Federation into parallel action, and by using
 the Belgian Government to serve demands on employers.  The US
 Embassy in Brussels reports that employers are "bitter" at the
 government for making them foot the bill for the wage increases.  The
 government, which during the negotiations "showed fear of affronting
 labor," may be led to strengthen the Cabinet by some changes.  (R
 Brussels 560, 21 Oct 51)
 Comment: A Socialist party leader has stated that the one party
 Belgian Government will be greatly strengthened by achieving a
 successful compromise on labor's demands.  Other reports also indicate
 that the Belgian Government will now make some Cabinet changes which
 will be favorable to labor.
 7.    ITALY.  National elections may be held in 1952 instead of 1953:
 Recently, a Christian Democratic Cabinet Minister confidentially
 told US representatives in Rome that he thought the next national
 elections in Italy would be held in the fall of 1952 rather than
 the spring of 1953.  He said there would be a "more favorable public
 psychological atmosphere after the long summer months than after the
 bitter winter."  Furthermore, he believed the government was anxious
 to hold the elections before expiration of the five-year law
 prohibiting important former Fascist officials from running for
 public office.  (C Rome 1825, 23 Oct 51)
 Comment:  This supports earlier rumors that the Italian
 Government would move ahead the time scheduled for the elections,
 which, according to the Constitution, are to be held every five
 years.  The last Italian national elections took place in April
 198, but local elections held in the spring of 1951 showed a decline

 Comment:  This last remark of the Foreign Minister apparently
 referso     e current negotiations with the US regarding operating
 rights at Norwegian air and naval facilities and points to increased
 difficulties in concluding an agreement.  Although the Norwegian
 Government has insisted throughout the negotiations that it will not
 make arrangements contrary to its policy on bases, officials un-
 doubtedly entertain reservations that various provisions could be
 interpreted as breaching that policy.  Since the timely arrival of the
 Soviet note will tend to aggravate these doubts, it may cause the
 government to proceed more cautiously in committing itself to further
 implementations of the North Atlantic Treaty, thus at least partially
 achieving the Soviet purpose,
