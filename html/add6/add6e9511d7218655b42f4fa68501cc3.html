 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Peking, the Army, and the Provincial Authorities
 Summary
 The origins of the Cultural Revolution in China
 are obscure, and the kind of information available
 concerning the disorderly course it has followed
 permits a variety of interpretations. It seems likely
 that the trouble which has kept China in turmoil for
 more than a year and which brought the country to
 the verge of anarchy in January 1967 had its roots
 in differences over policy in the fall of 1965. Mao's
 plans for rekindling revolutionary enthusiasm among
 the people and "steeling" the next generation to
 ensure that China would not backslide into revision-
 ism were probably an important issue--probably the
 major question taken up at a top-level meeting in
 Peking during September and October 1965.
 Conflicts generated by this basic issue prob-
 ably became entwined with a struggle inside the
 party leadership during the winter of 1965-66. There
 is some reason to believe that Mao became seriously
 ill after he dropped out of sight in November, and
 this would almost certainly have triggered prepara-
 tory maneuvering to claim his mantle among the
 Note:   This memorandum was produced solely by CIA.
 It was prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence
 and coordinated with the Office of Research and
 Reports and with the Research Staff of the Deputy
 Director for Intelligence.   Discussions were also
 held with analysts of the Office of National Esti-
 mates.

 finely balanced forces at the top of the hierarchy
 in Peking.  When Mao returned to take up an active
 role again in early spring this led to the destruc-
 tion of several major party leaders who had opposed
 Mao and whose ambitions and conniving had been
 exposed.   The purge--the first to affect politburo
 figures in seven years--deepened Mao's suspicions
 of all the rest and thus helped set the stage for
 the 11th central committee plenum in early August
 1966.   The evidence indicates that this plenum was
 the scene of a showdown between Mao and the old-line
 party apparatus responsive to Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hsiao-ping.  Mao, supported by Lin Piao and Premier
 Chou En-lai, won a victory in Peking.   It was not
 conclusive, however, because the new team of top
 leaders--a basically unstable group--faced growing
 resistance from powerful leaders in the provinces.
 Most of these men had been clients of Liu and Teng
 and could read the writing on the wall.
 A drive to bring some of these provincial party
 leaders down began at once, but was not pressed
 strongly until December.   By then the opposition
 included virtually every first secretary in the
 regional party bureaus and provinces and about half
 the commanders of the 13 military regions.   They
 were aligned with a number of key party and military
 figures still able to function in Peking and thus
 made a potentially formidable group.   They struggled
 desperately to retain their positions and succeeded
 in this until the military establishment entered
 the conflict on the side of Peking during the last
 week in January.
 The basis on which leaders at the center gained
 positive support from the armed forces is not clear.
 It seems likely that a number of high-ranking mili-
 tary officers opposed Mao and Lin Piao on this issue
 in December--former Marshal Ho Lung and 19 other
 major military figures were later charged with having
 plotted a "coup" and were purged shortly after the
 turn of the year.
 There is reason to believe that up to mid-
 January a number of key field. commanders were still
 uncommitted, some because they were confused by the

 situation in Peking and others because they had
 reservations about the course of the Cultural Revo-
 lution.   The military swung solidly into line in
 late January and early February, however, at a time
 when the Cultural Revolution was being moderated.
 A firm causal connection cannot be established on
 the basis of the evidence available, but the se-
 quence of events suggests that the views of military
 leaders were probably a factor--perhaps a major
 one--in Peking's decision to put a damper on "rebel"
 activity.
 It seems likely that the military establishment
 is an essentially conservative political organism,
 and as such would opt for stability and unity. There
 is no way of knowing whether a significant number
 of commanders would have defied Peking if the Cul-
 tural Revolution had not been moderated toward the
 end of January.   Doubts on this score almost cer-
 tainly existed at the center, however, and would
 have provided powerful support for arguments in favor
 of a change in tactics.
 When it appeared that the restoration of order
 had been given priority by Peking and moves were
 made to reassure the military concerning the conduct
 of the Cultural Revolution within the armed forces,
 the army moved into action decisively.  This is a
 reflection of the extent to which China has become
 a modern state, with an army motivated by national-
 istic patriotism,
 Despite indications that some military leaders
 were uncertain about whom to support in Peking, and
 that a few may for a time have backed efforts by
 regional political authorities to maintain their
 positions,  there has been no evidence of wavering
 loyalty to the state within the officer corps at
 large or among the rank and file, or of any wide-
 spread disposition to support a movement toward
 secession.
 Once the military took an active role, resist-
 ance in the provinces collapsed and there were
 indications in February that the brakes had been
 applied to the Cultural Revolution.   In early March,

 however, there was a resurgence of "rebel" revolu-
 tionary attacks on government and party officials.
 These apparently were ordered by Mao to reverse the
 trend toward phasing out the more violent and dis-
 orderly aspects of the Cultural Revolution.  A new
 campaign launched against Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hsiao-ping at the end of March apparently was in-
 tended to prepare for their formal removal.
 The outcome of these latest developments cannot
 be predicted, beyond a general forecast of continued
 confusion with new "twists and turns" in the months
 ahead as the current leaders work to construct new
 administrative machinery from the wreckage of the
 old party and government apparatus.  The course of
 the struggle during the December-January crisis,
 and the final victory of the center over power con-
 stellations on the periphery suggest, however, that
 over the longer run the prospect is for a unified
 China governed on strongly nationalistic principles.

 Peking  Presses  Regional  and Provincial Party
 Members
 1.  Attacks on powerful figures in the regional and
 provincial party apparatus began soon after the central
 committee plenum in August 1966 and the subsequent crea-
 tion of the Red Guards as a mass action political weapon
 responsive to forces supporting Mao and Lin Piao.   Red
 Guard activist teams fanned out all over China during
 September and October to spread the Cultural Revolution
 and "bombard the headquarters" of local authorities in
 a disorderly campaign of riotous demonstrations and mob
 violence.
 25X1
 2.                                                 regional party     25X1
 bureaus and more than a dozen provincia  party commit-
 tees were brought under varying degrees of pressure.
 The political and governmental apparatus outside the
 capital resisted with a variety of devices, pretending
 in some instances to welcome :Red Guard teams and offer-
 ing sham cooperation but in fact attempting to block
 their efforts.   Local "guards" were often organized
 and pitted against the interlopers from Peking.   Secu-
 rity forces were used by local authorites to channel Red
 Guard violence and where necessary to suppress hoodlum
 gangs attacking local leadership organs.
 3.   The pressure was stepped up by Peking during
 November.   Red Guard organization was improved and the
 assault by them on the provincial apparatus was more
 carefully focused.   Up to the beginning of December,
 however, the only major provincial leaders dismissed were
 the first secretary of the Hopei provincial committee--
 who had been in trouble prior to August--and the second
 secretaries in Shensi and Heilungkiang provinces.   In
 Peking, Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping continued to
 show up with Mao at Red Guard rallies, although they were
 by then shorn of significant political power.
 4.   In December the attack from the center went
 into high gear.   Former party leaders such as Peng Chen,
 already brought down, were "dragged out" by Red Guards
 and physically abused.  A full-scale campaign, backed
 by Madame Mao and other leaders, was launched against
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.   The charges brought
 against Liu and Teng were tantamount to treason, and
 it appeared that preparations were being made for formal
 proceedings against them.   The new attacks,  in fact,
 25X1
 Approved For Release 2004/07/08 : CIA-RDP79T00826A001900010015-9

 amounted to a threatened declaration of war against
 power holders on the periphery.   The option of a settle-
 ment between Peking and regional satraps was still open,
 though by no means an inviting one since the terms of-
 fered by the center were close to unconditional surrender.
 The Opposition
 7.   The men threatened by this drive to finish off
 resistance in the provinces belonged to cohesive local
 groups loosely connected with each other and sharing
 a common interest in political survival.   Most offi-
 cials under attack owed their positions to Liu Shao-
 chi and party general secretary Teng Hsiao-ping, who
 had been demoted at the 11th party plenum in August.   For
 years Liu and Teng had been building the party apparatus,
 both in Peking and the provinces, and their fall from
 grace jeopardized the positions of large numbers of key
 officials.
 8.   Apart from this, the generally united front
 presented by regional and provincial officials against
 efforts to bring them down was a reflection of loyal-
 ties developed among men working together in outlying

 areas.   Day-to-day operation of governmental and party
 machinery in regional organizations led, almost in-
 evitably,  to the growth of self-serving "establish-
 ments" made up of officials accustomed to dealing with
 one another and taken up with local problems.
 9.   It seems likely, moreover,  that over the years
 many of these men have become progressively alienated
 from authorities at the center who have been the source
 of relentless pressure to achieve results and who re-
 peatedly made local officials the scapegoats for
 blunders committed in Peking.   The considerable de-
 gree of popular support commanded by these men stems
 mainly from the regional diversity and provincialism
 based on geographic,  economic, ethnic,  linguistic, and
 cultural differences which still exist.
 The Provinces Fight Back
 10.   Local authorities outside the capital responded
 to Peking's offensive with a counterblow using political
 weapons denounced by central authorities under the
 blanket term "economism."  This was an appeal to paro-
 chial self-interest designed to produce paralyzing
 confusion and at the same time to enlist support from
 the people by offering them improvement in their lot.
 Peking had in fact issued instructions which authorized
 some of the actions taken by provincial authorities.
 Later, however,  the center charged that local authori-
 ties were "bribing" the workers with wage increases and
 a share-out of public property,  encouraging them to
 strike and go to the capital in order to present griev-
 ances.   Other devices used by local authorities included
 deception tactics--setting up false "rebel" groups and
 staging sham "take-overs"--and a kind of political
 judo which involved overcompliance with orders from
 the center such as the demand that workers be placed
 in charge.   Management technicians followed this in-
 struction by leaving their jobs and thus crippling
 operations in key installations or shutting them down
 entirely.
 11.   All this added up to a kind of passive
 resistance which produced disorder verging on chaos
 in many parts of China.   Peking's propaganda asserted
 that a "revisionist" conspiracy to seize power lay at

 the bottom of these troubles.   There is, however, no evi-
 dence that opposition forces were ever anything more than
 a loose coalition, or that leaders at the regional or
 provincial level were playing for anything more than a
 stalemate which would enable them to retain their posi-
 tions.  Most of the provincial. and regional power hold-
 ers were able to hold out until after the middle of
 January, a situation which would not have existed if
 the armed forces had been committed on the side of
 central authority.   It seems equally clear that, if the
 Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) had been firmly backing
 provincial and regional authorities, unarmed bands of
 troublemakers from other parts of China would never
 have been able to humiliate local officials and dis-
 rupt the operation of the party and government appara-
 tus.
 The Armed Forces on the Sidelines
 12.   Peking's directive publicized on 23 January
 ordering the PLA actively to support Maoist revolution-
 aries implies that the army had until then been under
 instructions to stand clear of the struggle.   Peking's
 failure to use the armed forces against resistance in
 the provinces during the August-December period might
 have resulted from a decision. by Mao and Lin Piao that
 the situation was not serious enough to warrant such
 drastic action, or that it was not yet time to bring
 the Cultural Revolution to a victorious conclusion.
 During the early part of the period this explanation
 is a plausible hypothesis but. after the middle of De-
 cember it is unconvincing.  The situation outside the
 capital became steadily worse toward the end of the
 month, and by the turn of the year it had become the
 most serious internal security crisis faced by the
 regime since it took power in 19.49.   It is hard to be-
 lieve that Mao and Lin would have permitted the massive
 disorder to drag on in East China as it did from late
 December to the middle of January--in particular the
 cutting of the important Shanzghai-Peking rail line--if
 they had been certain of the PLA.

 15.  Attacks on important military figures by the
 Maoists which began in early January suggest that the
 armed forces were not used because some key military
 leaders had opposed plans to achieve final victory for
 Mao's radical program by using military means to over-
 throw political leaders in outlying areas with whom
 they had connections.   They may have confronted Mao
 with demands that he should relieve the crisis by
 moderating the course of the revolution and coming
 to terms with his opponents.   The timing of events is
 obscure, but if such a showdown took place it seems
 most likely to have occurred shortly before the end
 of the year.
 The "Plot" of Ho Lung
 16.   Heavy criticism of military leaders began in
 earnest when Liu Chih-chien came under fire on 8 Janu-
 ary.                        A deputy director of the PLA General Political
 Department since 1958, Liu had headed the army's Cul-
 tural Revolution Group charged with purging the armed
 forces during late 1966.   The group was reorganized
 on 11 January and Madame Mao was named as its "ad-
 viser."

 17.   An editorial in the Liberation Army Journal
 on 12 January declared that the new body would open
 "ferocious fire" on the "handful" in power within the
 armed forces who had taken the "capitalist road."
 The Army journal reaffirmed the assertion made in People's
 Daily  and Red Flag on 11 January that the Cultural Revolu-
 tion had been  pushed" to a new stage by recent events and
 reminded readers that the army is the "mainstay of the pro-
 letarian dictatorship"--i.e., the chief instrument of
 domestic control.  According to poster reports, Lin Piao
 made a speech before the Cultural Revolution Group a few
 days earlier in which he declared that the country was
 in a "state of civil war."
 18.   The.scope and nature of the opposition in the
 military leadership is suggested by charges surfaced sev-
 eral days after the reorganization of the army purge
 machinery.     Posters put up on 15 January charged that
 important party and military leaders had been involved
 in a coup plot hatched by Ho Lung in February 1966.   Ho,
 a marshal until ranks were abolished in  1965 and a mem-
 ber of the military affairs committee of the central
 committee, was said to have headed a group which in-
 cluded "many" military leaders from the general staff,
 the air force, navy, and the Peking and Chengtu Military
 regions;  19 were eventually identified by name.
 19.   The charge that plotting of some kind had been go-
 ing on among the military is credible, and involvement of
 officers in the Chengtu Military Region--the stronghold
 of Southwest Bureau chief Li Ching-chuan--and the key
 Peking Military Region makes sense.   It seems unlikely,
 however, that the details of the accusation, particularly
 the date adduced,  are accurate.   The charges should prob-
 ably best be viewed as symbolic ones, revealing opposition
 but masking its true nature.   It would thus appear that
 the crimes were not actually plotting a "palace coup," and
 that the indictment may have been backdated--perhaps in
 order to conceal the fact that Maoist forces were cur-
 rently facing strong opposition within the military lead-
 ership over the issue of using the armed forces as Mao's
 iron fist to win quick political victory in the provinces.
 20.   The fall of Tao Chu, denounced in poster at-
 tacks shortly after his last appearance on 29 December,
 is another reflection of the depth of the struggle that
 was under way in December.   Until around the middle

 Tao would thus have had an interest in blocking a drive
 to eliminate power centers outside Peking.  His sudden
 and unexpected denunciation at the end of December may
 indicate that he joined the military and party oppo-
 sition in desperation when the issue came to a head.
 The Army Reacts to the Purge
 21.   It was clear that bringing down Ho Lung and
 his fellow conspirators did not mark the end of the
 matter so far as the military establishment was con-
 cerned.   Even the newly reorganized armed forces' purge
 machinery was not regarded as reliable by its creators.
 Within a few days after the reorganization, two
 members--both editors of Liberation Arm  Journal--had
 been removed.   Instead of stimulating new enthusiasm
 for the "revolution," the move to strengthen the mili-
 tary purge apparatus, together with attacks on major
 military figures, may actually have operated to heighten
 fears regarding their future position among senior troop
 commanders--generals of armies and high-ranking staff
 officers in the military regions--and inclined them to
 hang back.
 22.   Many of these men had former ties of one sort
 or another with military leaders who had come under
 attack, and even those with no connections which then
 appeared to be potentially dangerous must have been
 fearful of what a further enlargement of the "revolution"
 might bring in the way of ex post facto charges later
 on. Up to mid-January local political leaders had been
 successfully resisting in virtually every province, and
 commanders in almost every military region must have

 foreseen the possibility that they might be held respon-
 sible for this following a Maoist triumph even if they
 had been acting all along on the basis of orders from
 their superiors.
 23.   Apprehensions of this sort could be expected
 to reinforce the fundamental lack of sympathy for the
 Cultural Revolution which was probably widespread among
 officers of field grade or higher.  We have no firm
 evidence on which to base an assessment of the state of
 mind ...within the officer corps of the PLA, but mili-
 tary establishments tend to be conservative and it
 seems reasonable to suppose that by this time the pro-
 fessional soldiers who formed its backbone had seen
 more than enough revolutionary disorder and would be
 receptive to proposals which would bring it to a halt.
 The PLA Faces a Choice
 24.   The problem probably came to a head for the
 military around the third week in January.  A directive
 was issued on 23 January ordering the army to take an
 active role in backing pro-Mao forces.   The earlier
 practice of "standing on the sidelines" in the struggle
 was condemned and all orders to this effect were counter-
 manded.  A major editorial printed in People's Daily
 the day before puts this directive into perspective. It
 admitted that Mao had recently suffered a "serious set-
 back" and spoke gloomily of the possibility of increas-
 ing violence and "zigzags and ups and downs" before
 victory could be achieved.   The tone was violent, almost
 hysterical, and the prescription given for Maoist success
 was to "seize power! power!! and more power!!!"  The
 editorial asserted flatly that "he who is without power
 is nothing.   Of all the important things, the possession
 of power is the most important!"
 25.   Assertions that troops were being used in
 force to subdue Mao's opponents in the provinces ap-
 peared in Peking broadcasts immediately following
 issuance of the new directive.   Claims of successful
 take-overs by Maoists, however,  indicated that in fact
 widespread resistance was continuing and that the armed
 forces did not move as one man to follow the new in-
 structions.   In some areas the response was prompt,
 but in others resistance and confusion persisted for

 weeks, suggesting that the military--who held the key
 to the situation--were dragging their feet.
 26.   Liu Lan-tao, party boss in the Northwest
 Region where resistance had been very strong, was re-
 ported to have been "dragged out" by Red Guards in Sian
 about 23 January along with 17 of his chief lieutenants.
 A photograph of this event was posted in Peking on 8
 February.   Li Ching-chuan,  first secretary of the
 Southwest Bureau--another hotbed of resistance--was
 paraded in disgrace through the streets of Chengtu
 about the same time.
 27.   Trouble continued to be reported in many
 parts of China during early February, however, espe-
 cially in Tibet and Szechwan where Red Guards com-
 plained--as they had been doing for months--that they
 were being suppressed by military units.
 28.   These differences cannot be satisfactorily
 explained on the ground that the armed forces lacked the
 strength to impose the will of the center on provincial
 leaders immediately, or that the military did not have
 clear instructions.   It appears, therefore, that the
 spotty performance of the military reflected unwilling-
 ness on the part of key commanders in some areas to carry
 out orders.   Under normal circumstances the response to
 such a situation would be immediate removal and court
 martial of the insubordinate commanders--sending in
 troops from other areas to accomplish this if necessary.
 29.   Peking appears instead to have changed the
 orders, moderating the Cultural Revolution so that it
 would be acceptable to the armed forces--providing as-
 surances which would win the active support of the
 military.   Specific arrangements may have been made
 with a number of individual commanders-'in Tibet,  Inner
 Mongolia, and Sinkiang--similar to the bargains struck
 with the warlords in the 1930s?--but the over-all appeal
 for army backing looked more like an effort to reach
 political consensus.

 Peking on 25 January emphas.i.zed,the point that in assist-
 ing the "rebel revolutionaries" the army should rely on
 political persuasion rather than force.
 33.   A new directive to the armed forces issued on
 27 January provided justification for a slowdown in the
 pace of the Cultural Revolution.  According to posters
 observed in Peking, Mao on that day had ordered all mil-
 itary regions to be alert against the "forces of imperial-
 ism and revisionism," specifically mentioning Sinkiang
 and the military regions.on China's Pacific coast.  Mao
 was quoted as saying that in view of the current mili-
 tary situation the "timetable for the Cultural Revolution
 may be set back somewhat."   The directive was issued
 under the name of Yeh Chien-yang for the Military Affairs

 Committee--the body of which Lin Piao had been "in charge"
 since 1960.
 34.   Another directive was issued by the Military
 Affairs Committee on 28 January concerning the conduct
 of the Cultural Revolution within the armed forces.   Or-
 ders were reportedly issued that,ssldiers, "especially
 commanders," were not to be arrested or physically
 harmed, although they might be "ridiculed."  Attacks
 against individuals were to be permitted but it was
 forbidden to "criticize the command" itself.    The
 implied guarantee of immunity to most senior officers
 may reflect a successful attempt to reassure PLA lead-
 ers, which brought the weight of the armed forces behind
 the authorities in Peking.
 The Army Gets in Line
 35.  With the armed forces no longer on the side-
 lines, provincial resistance began to collapse
 during the last week in January.   On 27 January a radio-
 broadcast from the capital of Anhwei Province announced
 the dismissal of provincial first secretary Li Pao-hua
 and four other local party and government figures.   Li
 was also third secretary of the headless East China
 Bureau and was probably a client of Tao Chu.
 36.  A new type of government organization began
 to appear in the provinces based on a three-way alliance
 between military, party, and "revolutionary" elements.
 The first of these alliances appeared in Heilungkiang
 around 1 February, a second in Fukien on 11 February,
 and a third was announced in Kweichow on 14 February.
 Propaganda broadcasts concerning all of these new or-
 ganizations stressed the key role of the armed forces
 in setting them up.  A representative of the PLA was
 the featured speaker in the inaugural rally in Heilung-
 kiang.   In Fukien, Han Hsien-chu, the ranking profes-
 sional military figure in the Foochow Military Region,
 and Wei Chin-shui, who is governor and a party secretary,
 were the principal speakers.  Military men and "revolu-
 tionary leading cadres"--the term Peking began to use
 to describe acceptable party leaders in the provinces--
 took the leading roles, with "revolutionary elements"
 taking a subordinate position.

 37.   Orders were apparently issued about this time
 aimed at curbing military participation in Cultural
 Revolution agitation.  Authoritative posters seen on
 8 February reported a directive by Lin Piao that sol-
 diers who had been engaged in "exchanging revolutionary
 experiences" were all to return to their posts by 20
 February.   Lin declared that all "liaison offices" co-
 ordinating local revolutionary rebel activity would
 soon be abolished.

 escribed efforts to restore order in Inner
 Mongolia.   The Military Affairs Committee and the State
 Council reportedly issued a joint directive on 6 Feb-
 ruary ordering party, army, and "rebel" units in the
 region to stop fighting.   The poster stated that a
 plane had been dispatched to the capital city of
 Inner Mongolia to bring representatives of the three          25X1
 groups to Peking to settle the conflict.

 40.   The behavior of military units and the role
 they played appear to have differed in some particulars
 from place to place.   The over-all pattern, however,
 indicates that the armed forces displayed great in-
 ternal cohesion and took a conservative position--in
 opposition alike to the "rebel" revolutionaries and
 troublemaking local authorities.   The PLA appears
 generally to have held back until the movement to slow
 down and to moderate the Cultural Revolution began to
 gain strength.
 An Olive Branch to the Party Establishment
 41.   Moves to bring the armed forces into the
 struggle were accompanied by a parallel shift in Pe-
 king's approach to the party apparatus, signaled by
 a Red Flag editorial broadcast on 30 January which
 referred to experienced cadres as the "treasure of
 the party" and warned against indiscriminate attacks
 on them.   This was not a new line in that bad ele-
 ments in the party had from the outset been called
 a "handful," but the emphasis was markedly different
 from that in pronouncements during December and early
 January.
 42.  The shift was also reflected in a wall news-
 paper observed some time later which reported that
 Chou En-lai had met with representatives of 23 "revo-
 lutionary" factions on 1 February and had urged a
 return to the policy of correcting erring party offi-
 cials in a way which would not destroy their future
 usefulness.   Chou reportedly warned that mistreatment
 of party cadres, particularly those at the basic level,
 might alienate "revolutionary forces" from the people.
 A broadcast from Lhasa on 9 February quoted the Red
 Flag editorial publicized by Peking on 31 January
 urging true "revolutionaries" to trust and use party
 leaders, even those who had committed errors, so long
 as they were not "antiparty."   Those who indiscrimi-
 nately labeled party leaders as "persons in authority
 who are taking the capitalist road" were denounced.
 43.  A broadcast from the provincial capital of In-
 ner Mongolia on 10 February denounced ultraleftists,
 who it said were "enthusiastic about internal war and
 advocate aimless fighting."  A similar line was taken
 by ,a broadcast from Heilungkiang four days later

 which criticized a "very small handful" of such people
 in the "revolutionary ranks" who refused to cooperate
 with the old-line party leaders retained in the new
 revolutionary committee which had been formed for the
 province on 31 January.   The broadcast stated flatly
 that these dissidents were "counterrevolutionaries."
 25X1
 45.   Provincial broadcasts soon began to reflect
 this new approach to the party machine at the local
 level.   On 15 February the radio in Tsingtao, a port
 city in Shantung Province seized by Maoist "rebels"
 on 29 January, lashed out at those who had charged that
 "all leading cadres are guilty of suppressing the
 revolution."  The same day the Harbin station in
 Heilungkiang demanded that leading cadres "must be
 given an opportunity to repent" and enumerated
 broad categories of cadres who were redeemable.
 New Impetus to "Tripartite Alliances"
 46. Editorials in People's Daily on 17 February
 and in Liberation Army Journal on the 18th underscored
 earlier announcements praising the policy of forming
 a "tripartite alliance" among old-line party officials,
 the army, and "revolutionary" organizations and
 claimed that this had already been achieved in four
 provinces and two municipalities.   This concept ap-
 parently supplanted the notion of establishing new
 revolutionary "communes" as governing bodies.   Until
 early February an organization supposedly based on
 the Paris Commune of 1871 was being touted as a model,
 and the formation of "communes" was announced with
 great fanfare in a number of cities.   On 19 February,
 however, the party central committee ordered that
 no city or province would use the name "commune" in
 its title and that those which had established them

 25X1

 Approved For Releaso
 should promptly establish new "revolutionary com-
 mittees."
 47.   About the same time, according to posters,
 several leaders in Peking questioned whether the Paris
 Commune provided a useful guide for China.   Some
 months earlier the commune had been extolled in
 speeches and articles and its applicability to the
 situation in China had been stressed.   The anarchic
 nature of the organization apparently worried some
 leaders in Peking, however, and Minister of Public
 Security Hsieh Fu-chih was reported by posters to have
 said that establishing communes might lead to a weak-
 ening of central control.
 48.   The directive regarding "communes" on 19
 February was one of a number issued about the same time
 designed to put an end to confusion.  Many of these
 reinforced earlier orders but. in stronger terms.   They
 instructed "revolutionary" forces to disband organi-
 zations not approved by the central committee, to stop
 attacking party officials, and to include important
 party officials in take-over organizations.   Their
 tone and substance was reflected in a speech report-
 edly given by Chou En-lai to Red Guards. on 17 February.
 49.  According to poster accounts, Chou denounced
 "rebels" for seizing government ministries without
 central committee approval.   He specifically mentioned
 the Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the
 Ministry of Public Security as organizations in which
 seizure of power ""cannot be recognized."  Chou angrily
 criticized "rebel" attempts to arrest the minister
 of commerce after he had been invited by Chou to
 "rest" and declared.that this action was like issuing
 a warrant "against the party central committee."
 50.   Chou again deplored "revolutionary" excesses
 committed against veteran government and party offi-
 cials.   Parading them around in dunce caps could not
 be condoned, he said, and went on to declare that
 such "uncivilized" treatment was not necessary "even
 against Peng Chen."  Chou criticized three powerful
 and militant Red Guard organizations by name, citing
 the "low quality" of the posters they had put up all
 over China.   He said that the central committee did

 not necessarily agree with these posters.   This re-
 mark, together with Chou's criticism of irresponsible
 accusations and his statement: that the list of party
 officials to be attacked should be "boiled down,"
 implied that Peking had decided to start dismantling
 extremist organizations.
 25X1
 The Role of Chou En-lai
 52.   There is insufficient evidence to reach a
 confident conclusion with regard to Chou En-lai's motiva-
 tion and role during the period of revolutionary retreat.
 He was clearly in the thick of things, however, and the
 fact that the shift toward a more moderate course in Feb-
 ruary reflects the relatively conservative position Chou
 has taken since last August suggests that he had gained
 the initiative at the center.
 53.   Chou has been notable as a defender of in-
 dividuals under attack by "rebel" Red Guards, and has
 repeatedly supported officials who were part of his
 power base within the government structure.   He has
 also backed a number of military leaders who appeared
 to be in trouble.   Chou has gone along with the main
 line of the Cultural Revolution but his statements
 have been more moderate than those of Lin Piao, Chiang
 Ching,  Chen Po-ta, and other Maoist spokesmen.   He
 has repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining
 production and has come out against "excesses," under-
 scoring the necessity of "treating the illness to
 save the patient."
 54.   It seems likely that the flow of events
 placed Chou in a key position, in part at least by de-
 fault, and that he argued successfully for the reten-
 tion of surviving authorities in the second or third

 echelon of the provincial and regional hierarchies.   These
 men were doubtless regarded by the Maoists as dangerously
 tainted with revisionism but their skills and experience
 made them indispensable in halting the trend toward an-
 archy and in dealing with practical problems such as get-
 ting the vital spring planting done.
 55.  Mao and Lin Piao had from the outset been pub-
 licly committed to a violent course aimed at achieving
 radical changes of the most sweeping kind and their com-
 mitment had led to an accretion of power in the hands of
 the most radical elements in the Chinese body politic.   This,
 would have made it very difficult to get agreement on a
 shift toward moderation.   Chou's counsel may have been
 endorsed by a number of important military leaders and
 his efforts at persuasion were probably strengthened in
 any case by doubts which almost certainly existed at the
 center concerning the loyalty of the armed forces in all
 circumstances.   Mao appears to have been forced to accept
 the need for a move toward moderation in tactics but clearly
 regarded it as a temporary expedient.
 The Trend Toward Moderation Continues
 56.   The Cultural Revolution continued to lose
 velocity during late February and early March amid in-
 dications that order was being restored.   Essential
 services provided by the government, seriously dis-
 rupted from December on, were again available in most
 places by February.   The Red Guard apparatus was being
 gradually modified and in some cases dismantled.
 57.   On 22 February Chou En-lai addressed a mass
 meeting of university Red Guards in Peking and repeat-
 edly cited Mao as the authority for what clearly was
 an effort to weld the disparate revolutionary  rou s
 together into a more manageable organization.

 58.   On 6 March Peking radio put its stamp of
 approval on the dissolution of city-wide "revolution-
 ary" organizations in the Shantung city of Tsingtao.
 The governing revolutionary committee in Tsingtao had
 directed on 2 March that the headquarters of rebel
 organizations be disbanded and the "tripartite alli-
 ances" of rebels, army elements, and party cadres be
 formed within work units.   In its announcement, Peking
 acknowledged that disorder had resulted when workers
 within a unit belonged to different--and often antago-
 nistic--revolutionary organizations.
 59.   Efforts to get the economy rolling again,
 especially in the vital agricultural sector, began to
 be evident.
 A Red Flag article broad-
 cast by Peking on 27 February laid out what amounted
 to a blueprint for the role of the military in restoring
 order.   The article identified "anarchism" as the chief
 danger--an implicit criticism of Maoist revolutionaries--
 and underscored the importance of production.   People's
 Daily,  in an editorial broadcast on 1 March, again

 made the case for unity and opposed extremism and
 anarchy.
 25X1
 The "Rebels" Strike Back
 61.   Efforts to let the steam out of Mao's Cultural
 Revolution and to move China back toward something like
 normalcy were not unopposed.
 Ion 25 February a wa   newspaper reported
 that nine secondary-level officials had been displayed
 and denounced at a rally of 1.00,000 Red Guards, workers,
 and troops at the Workers' Stadium in Peking.   This
 was the first such public humiliation of officials
 since mid-February when Chou En-lai had declared that
 Mao deplored "uncivilized" treatment of his enemies.
 On 9 March posters and wall newspapers appeared all
 over Peking denouncing Tan Chen-lin, the agricultural
 specialist on the politburo.
 63.   Tan was the first senior party official to
 come under fire since the Cultural Revolution began to
 subside at the end of January.   Posters attacking him
 were signed by revolutionary groups in numerous gov-
 ernment ministries, suggesting that the campaign against
 him had high-level approval.   Tan was accused of having
 "deceived" Chou En-lai and of having attempted to
 moderate the Cultural Revolution in the countryside.
 64.   The depth and seriousness of the renewed con-
 flict at the center over the question of moderating
 the Cultural Revolution was indicated by a major Red
 Flag editorial broadcast on 10 March.   The editorial
 complained that militant revolutionaries were not being
 given a large enough role in the new revolutionary
 governing bodies being set up throughout China.   Some
 of these bodies, it warned, have "compromised with
 class enemies" by allowing too many party officials,
 including "some who have not repented," to help run
 the new organizations.   Red _~Fllaag predicted that this
 would lead to "new seesaw battles," an implicit threat

 that attacks on what was left of the party apparatus out-
 side the capital would be resumed.
 65.  Attacks on Tan Chen--lin continued on 11
 March with a rally held to denounce him at the Ministry
 of State Farms.  A poster was observed on 11 March
 stating that past statements by high officials de-
 fending Tan had been withdrawn.   He had come under
 sporadic poster attack in previous months but had been
 defended by both Chou En-lai and Madame Mao in January.
 On 14 March Tan was denounced again by 100,000 parading
 Red Guards, workers, and troops.   In these attacks he
 was linked with fallen party :Leaders Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping, and the disciplined character of the
 demonstration indicated that it had official sanction.
 66.   Two more vice premiers joined Tan Chen-lin as
 targets for criticism on 15 and 16 March.   On these days
 posters went up attacking Finance Minister Li Hsien-nien
 and Li Fu-chun, who is in charge of state planning. Like
 Tan, both men are politburo members, and Li Fu-chun is
 also on the standing committee.   Neither of these men
 was attacked as violently as Tan, and posters defending
 them as "good students of Mao" appeared along with
 those criticizing them.
 67.   The development was clearly regarded in a
 serious light, however, and may have been an oblique
 attack on Chou En-lai himself since all three men were
 his close associates and worked under his direction.
 Many defensive sounding posters asserting that Chou
 "follows the revolutionary line laid down by Chairman
 Mao" were displayed in Peking on 16 March--the same
 day that an editorial appeared in the Shanghai Wen
 Hui Pao--a newspaper in the vanguard of the Cultural
 Revolution last year--castigating those who had said
 the Red Guards were "overdoing it" and stating flatly
 that anyone who criticized the guards for their rela-
 tively few mistakes was opposing the Cultural Revolu-
 tion.   Chou may have been the indirect target of this
 editorial in that he has on several occasions taken
 the Red Guards sharply to task for their excesses.
 68.   Efforts to work out an accommodation with
 leaders in the strategic border regions such as
 Sinkiang came under fire in posters put up in Peking
 on 18 March by powerful Red Guard groups. These posters,

 the posters, Nieh declared that it was the most impor-

 began in January.   The main question, she said, was
 who is to hold power.
 70.   Another ultramilitant Red Guard leader, Kuai
 Ta-fu, was quoted by a poster as describing the situa-
 tion as the "lull before the decisive battle."  Major
 Red Guard newspapers circulated in Peking claimed that
 a "reactionary adverse current" was running from the
 top to the bottom of the regime--almost certainly a
 reference to the trend toward damping down the Cultural

 73.   Developments in late March and early April
 suggest that, during coming weeks and perhaps for the

 inces, to construct new administrative machinery on
 the wreckage of the shattered government and party

 76.   On both 19 and 22 March Chou En-lai was
 the main speaker at congresses of mass organizations.
 A major theme stressed on these occasions was the need
 for early formation of a revolutionary committee to
 govern the city of Peking.  What may be the model for
 new provincial government machinery--a provincial
 revolutionary committee--had emerged about a week
 earlier in Shansi Province and was publicized by Peking
 on 23 March.   This organization has taken over and
 consolidated tasks previously carried out by the bu-
 reaucracy and party apparatus, and includes seven
 former provincial and municipal-level officials in
 leadership positions.   The senior army political
 commissar appeared to be the real power.   He chaired
 the Shansi congress and was elected ranking vice
 chairman of the committee.
 "Rebel" Counterpressure
 77.   Indications that the February trend toward
 comparative  moderation was still continuing were
 accompanied by evidence that militant "rebel" elements
 had been instructed to get the revolution back into high
 gear and rolling ahead once again.  A new attack was
 launched against the discredited Liu Shao-chi, once
 number two in the party and still nominally chief of
 state, and against Teng Hsiao-ping--still technically
 head of the party secretariat but clearly without
 real power since the August 1966 plenum.
 78.   Both these men had been under vicious attack
 in posters, Red Guard newspapers, and rallies since
 December.   On 30 March they began to come under even
 heavier fire from the propaganda vehicles of the central
 committee, Red Flag, and People's Daily.   The official
 news agency, NCNA, carried voluminous accounts of
 rallies and demonstrations at which thousands of well-
 disciplined marchers shouted "down with Liu and Teng."
 79.   The new assault on Liu and Teng has thus far
 been carried on mainly in the capital and has, for
 the most part, involved only major figures in the hier-
 archy.   If the attacks are in preparation for formal
 public action to strip these men of official position
 and drum them out of the party, as seems likely, they
 could be the prelude to political interment for a host
 of lesser figures still holding positions in the party

 apparatus--which was staffed and managed by Liu and Teng
 for more than a decade.
 80.  A larger and more immediate purpose of the cam-
 paign against the "Liu-Teng gang" is probably to rekindle
 enthusiasm for the Cultural Revolution, get it in motion
 throughout the country once more, and thus to bolster
 the position of the extremist militants.  Militant Red
 Guard groups, under pressure and apparently in decline
 during the February retreat from revolution, have become
 active once more and their leaders--people like Nieh
 Yuan-tzu and Kuai Ta-fu--are again asserting themselves.
 Unheard from for many weeks prior to mid-March, they have
 since been passing judgment on men in high places, declar-
 ing which ones should be "watched carefully," which can
 hope to be excused if they repent and reform, and which
 are outside the pale of redemption.
 81.   Continuing parallel attacks on officials asso-
 ciated with Chou En-lai and on high-ranking military lead-
 ers may indicate that these men, successful proponents of
 moderation in February, are resisting a return to the vio-
 lent and disorderly course taken by the Cultural Revolution
 up to the end of January.   The continuing emphasis on Mao's
 injunction to "pursue the tottering foe" suggests that cau-
 tious elements in Peking are arguing that the Revolution
 has already achieved its major purpose and should now be
 conducted more deliberately and at a lower pitch.
 Prospects
 82.   The immediate outcome of the latest developments
 in Peking is impossible to predict, beyond a general fore-
 cast of continued confusion with new "twists and turns"
 in the months ahead.   Communist China now appears to be
 ruled by a very small and disunited group of leaders op-
 erating under a triumvirate in which Mao probably plays
 the dominant role--when he chooses and is physically able.
 It seems likely that both the shadowy Lin Piao and Chou
 En-lai, in subordinate but powerful and probably
 antagonistic positions, make independent self-serving de-
 cisions when circumstances permit.
 83.   The immediate objective of those at the top
 in Peking at present is probably to construct new adminis-
 trative machinery from the wreckage of the shattered
 25X1

 party and government apparatus.   This is proceeding fit-
 fully and at a snail's pace, which suggests that conflict-
 ing factions are striving for future dominance by plac-
 ing their own adherents in key positions within the new
 political structure.
 84.   Such a situation is basically unstable and
 might result in a violent struggle at the center which
 could conceivably lead to civil war.   The course of events
 during January and early February when resistance in the
 provinces was subdued and differences were compromised
 under the aegis of the armed forces, however, makes this
 seem unlikely.
 85.   During that period of turmoil the military es-
 tablishment as a whole opted for stability and national
 unity.   Despite indications that some high-ranking lead-
 ers sided with provincial and regional authorities
 against Peking, there was no evidence of wavering basic
 loyalty in the officer corps at large or among the rank
 and file, or of any disposition to support a movement
 toward secession.   The PLA has remained a united and
 functional organization throughout the course of the Cul-
 tural Revolution.                             When the armed forces intervened it
 was in general on the side of order and central author-
 ity, and on balance it seems probable that they would
 do so again in reacting to a split at the center.   This
 is a reflection of the extent to which China has become
 a modern nation-state.
 The Seeds of Patriotism
 86.   The process started with the Western incur-
 sion into China about a hundred years ago.   It was
 carried forward by the reformers of the late 19th
 century, given new impetus and direction by the nation-
 alist revolutionaries who sought to fill the political
 vacuum left by the collapse of the empire in 1911.
 Japan served as a catalyst, first in demonstrating that
 an Asian nation could stand as an equal with the powers
 of the West, and later as the focus of national enmity
 during the Japanese attempt to conquer China.

 the Communists established a new state in 1949 with a
 political structure fundamentally different from any
 which had previously existed in China.   Under it the
 people once despairingly described by Sun Yat-sen as
 a "heap of loose sand" have finally become united and
 given a sense of national purpose after decades of
 bloody and turbulent struggle.   In doing this Mao and
 his comrades were reaping a harvest sown by their
 predecessors.
 "New China"
 88.   The Communists imposed a government which
 for the first time in Chinese history reached all the
 people and directly affected their lives.   Rule under
 the empire had always been autocratic and Peking was
 the ultimate center of authority but the force of
 government was applied locally by a county magistrate--
 the only official an average Chinese ever saw--working
 through clan and family channels.   The general lines
 of policy were established by the imperial court,
 transmitted downward through a mandarinate of approxi-
 mately 10,000 scholar officials, and interpreted by
 provincial authorities who exercised a great deal of
 autonomy.   The functioning of the system for most of
 the people, most of the time, was quite accurately
 described by the folk saying, "The sun is in the
 heavens and the emperor is far away."
 89.   Under the new Communist rule the bureaucracy
 reached the village level and operated from detailed
 directives passed down through a disciplined and
 pervasive chain of command which at the same time
 kept Peking informed of events at the lowest level.
 Communications were developed to a point which made it
 theoretically possible for a village cadre to talk
 on the telephone with Mao himself.   Closed-circuit
 loudspeaker systems were installed in both rural
 and urban areas to pass propaganda from the center
 directly to the people.
 90.   The regime launched a vigorous and effective
 attack on illiteracy, using simplified characters and
 other devices, and made progress toward establishing
 a national language.   These tools were used to in-
 doctrinate the population with Marxist ideology and
 at the same time to foster the growth of Western-style
 nationalism.
 25X1

 Approved For Rele
 91.   National feeling and popular identification
 with the regime were further enhanced by the economic
 and social achievements of the new regime.   The over-all
 improvement of the economic situation was in large part
 the result of reconstruction and restoration of public
 order but the results achieved provided a practical
 demonstration of the value of national unity.  China
 was not transformed into a land of milk and honey,
 but at least there was no mass starvation.   The early
 social reforms instituted by the regime were harsh
 but they destroyed genuine evils--oppression by land-
 lords and money lenders, the remnants of traditional
 family system--and were welcomed by the population
 as a whole.   The social services provided by the
 new regime--schools, clinics, courts, public welfare
 services--while not impressive by Western standards,
 were better and more abundant than anything known
 previously in China.
 92.   Finally, the Communists created a modern
 national army, based on the principle of universal
 conscription, to replace the essentially regional
 armed forces with which they had won the revolution.
 Such an army is a powerful unifying force, particularly
 when it has a major stake in preserving the state
 mechanism.
 93.   Chiang Kai-shek made progress in all of these
 areas and had it not been for the Japanese attack
 might have been able to create a unified state.   It
 is likely that the Communist leaders regard their own
 success in doing so as the greatest single achievement
 of their regime.  A conviction that political unity is
 vitally important--a belief probably now shared by
 a majority of the Chinese people--is the root of the
 basic consensus that seems likely to hold China to-
 gether.

 First Secretary Li Hsueh-feng was portrayed in
 February and March posters as a "category three"
 official, i.e., one who has committed serious er-
 rors but is being given a chance to serve in a
 lesser role.   It is doubtful if he retains sig-
 nificant authority.   Li was under heavy and sus-
 tained attack by Red Guards, through posters and
 demonstrations,  in October and November  (in his
 concurrent role of first secretary of the Peking
 city party committee).   He apparently was replaced
 in his Peking job in that period by his deputy,
 Wu Te.
 Little was heard of Li after November until 31 Jan-
 uary when Chou En-lai was quoted in a poster as
 saying that Li was on probation and had been sent
 to Tientsin to clear up a troublesome situation.
 The position of weakness from which Li is operating
 was clearly indicated by a contrite statement he
 made at a Tientsin rally on 18 March.   Li said if
 he was "able to engage in useful work in Tientsin
 and correct his past mistakes" he would owe it all
 to the invincible thought of Mao.   By late March,
 however, Li was in deep trouble again.

 Yang posed an "extremely grave" problem.   On
 the same day Chou En-lai accused Yang of "plot-

 dismissed.   His political commissar, Liao Han-

 Peking City
 Wu Te, who replaced Li Hsueh-feng in Octo-
 ber or November, was described in posters
 in late February as a "comparatively good"
 cadre.  Wu had been criticized from time
 to time and was briefly "arrested" by Red
 Guards in mid-January.   On 20 January,
 however, Madame Mao sternly ordered the
 Guards to release Wu and let him go back
 to work.   On 2 March a Peking broadcast
 identified Wu as a leading member of the
 "Peking municipality."
 The broadcast avoided naming the governing
 body Wu leads, but posters said he still
 headed the party committee, by then a
 nearly powerless body.  Posters in late
 January stated that a Paris-style commune

 PLA had assumed control over the Tientsin

 Shansi
 The party committee and government were
 abolished on :L2 January and replaced with
 a "revolutionary committee."  The former
 first secretary Wei Heng apparently was
 not retained in a leading position.   He
 and four other party leaders were criti-
 cized at a rally in Taiyuan on 5 February.
 All except Wei were then publicly paraded.
 The chairman of the new "revolutionary
 committee" is former vice governor Liu
 Ko-ping.  The party is said to be playing
 a unique role in Shansi, although only one
 of the 11 former secretaries has yet
 emerged in good standing.  The Shansi
 "revolutionary committee," unlike those
 set up elsewhere, is being run jointly by
 a "CCP Shansi core group" and the revolu-
 tionary rebels.  The deputy head of the
 core group is Chang Jih-ching, political
 commissar of the Shansi military district.
 Other members named so far include Liu
 Ko-ping, Jen Chen, a former provincial
 secretary and concurrently first secretary
 of Taiyuan city, and Liu Kuan-i, an ap-
 parently minor official whose former post
 is unknown.   Liu Kuan-i is general secre-
 tary of the core group.
 Chou En-lai and Cultural Revolution offi-
 cial Wang Li have singled out Liu Ko-ping
 as one of the few "good cadres" in China.
 Liu's chief merit, according to Wang Li,
 is that he was once "oppressed" by Liu
 Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.   Liu Ko-ping
 was the first secretary of Ninghsia until
 1960 when he was dismissed for "rightist
 tendencies" and given the unimportant post
 of vice governor in Shansi.
 Peking's claim that Mao's enemies in Shansi
 had struggled desperately before their de-

 Both first secretary Huang Huo-ching and

 ors" in Liaoning, and posters were noted
 on 21 January calling for the removal
 of Huang Ho-tung.   Neither official media
 nor authoritative Red Guard newspapers
 have replayed these possibly isolated
 attacks.
 Other party officials who have been at-
 tacked are the Shenyang first secretary,
 Yang Chun-pu, for "opposition activities"
 in early January, and eight Luta (Dairen)
 party officials who were paraded at a
 rally in Luta on 22 January.   No revolu-

 Sinkiang
 First secretary Wang En-mao appears to
 have reached an uneasy compromise with
 Peking in February after many months of
 sustained Red Guard attacks on him.
 That anti-Wang campaign culminated in
 serious disorders in'December and Janu-
 ary involving the large Production-Con-
 struction Army in Sinkiang.   Sinkiang has
 been quiet since late January, however,
 when Wang reportedly was working out an
 agreement in Peking with Chou En-lai.
 Several times during March and April the
 Sinkiang provincial radio station re-
 ported that Wang attended rallies in
 Urumchi, still holding all his old po-
 sitions.   These broadcasts, confirming
 earlier poster accounts of a Wang-Chou
 agreement, said that the Sinkiang situ-
 ation had been stabilized on the basis of
 a 12-point directive prepared by Chou
 and endorsed by Mao and Lin.   Red Guard
 newspapers had reported that such a di-
 rective had been issued on 11 February.
 Wang's position still seems insecure, how-
 ever.   Peking media have not reported
 that Wang is still in place or repeated
 Urumchi radio's accounts of Wang's ac-
 tivities.   Sporadic Red Guard attacks on
 Wang continued in Peking after Wang re-
 surfaced in Urumchi, and on 16 April
 detailed poster attacks on Liu Shao-chi
 accused Wang En-mao and other Northwest
 leaders of plotting with Liu last spring,
 when Liu visited Sinkiang en route to
 Pakistan.   The resurgence of a radical
 atmosphere in Peking since mid-March
 suggests that the status of all compromises
 reached during the February period of mod-
 eration, such as the one with Wang, is
 now being questioned by militant elements
 in the leadership.

 on the party committees of the Northwest
 Bureau, Shensi, and Sian city.   In mid-
 January, according to Sian radio broad-

 three party committees.   Shensi has not
 been recognized as a true take-over by
 Peking, and appears to have been little
 affected by the recent phase of modera-
 tion.  The dominance of the revolution-
 aries suggests that Shensi may represent
 a "problem" area with which Peking in-
 tends to deal after the Cultural Revo-

 First secretary Wang Feng, who last showed
 up in public on 1 October 1966, appears to
 have been sacrificed to pro-Mao forces in
 November or December.
 on 7 February a wall poster
 identified his replacement as Hu Chi-
 tsung, formerly a secretary in the Kansu
 party committee, and then stated that Hu
 was "Tao Chu's timebomb in the Northwest."
 The same poster charged that the Kansu
 party committee, in collusion with the
 Military District Commander and Lanchow
 Military Region officials, had suppressed
 revolutionaries near Lanchow in late Janu-

 the Kansu Military District had "conspired"
 with the party committee in order to re-
 press the rebels.  The sons of the Lanchow
 Military Region commander, Chang Ta-chih,
 and Political Commissar Hsien Heng-han
 were accused of leading counterrevolutionary
 organizations in Lanchow and Kansu.   Cur-
 rently,  the military appears to be in
 charge of the province.   No prominent mil-

 mentioned in broadcasts in 1967.

 The heavy casualties apparently suffered by the

 to the fact that Teng Hsiao-ping probably ran
 the bureau until his political downfall in Au-

 The identity of the commander is uncertain.
 Yeh Fei, who is concurrently political com-

 committee, was last identified as commander
 in 1962.   The ranking military professional
 in the province, Han Hsien-chu, was named
 deputy chief of staff in 1965, and may have
 replaced Yeh Fei.  Nevertheless, Han, who
 was the leading speaker at a "victory" rally
 staged by revolutionaries in Foochow on 11
 February, was identified only as a "responsible
 member of PLA units on the Fukien front."
 The status of Yeh Fei is unclear.  He was
 under attack by local Red Guards from August
 to December but authoritative Red Guard news-
 papers in Peking have not mentioned him.   Pe-
 king has praised the leading role of the
 PLA in the "triple alliance" in Fukien, indi-

 In January there were numerous reports
 of clashes in the port city of Tsingtao,
 but elsewhere in Shantung there has
 been little evidence of violence.
 After sustained attacks on First Secre-
 tary Li Pao-hua dating back to late Au-
 gust, Hofei radio announced the dismissal
 of Li and four other ranking leaders on
 26 January.   Li has been included in
 semiofficial lists of both Liu-Teng
 followers and the Tao Chu group.
 On 26 January, the provincial broad-
 casting station announced the rebel
 take-over of provincial party and gov-
 ernment organs.  Peking has never of-
 ficially recognized this take-over.   It
 is possible that the regime cannot agree
 on who is to lead this province..
 Recent and frequent appearances of high-

 that the PLA is running Anhwei.   However,
 two secretaries of the former provincial

 Posters in early January reported Nan-

 accounts of incidents stated 54 persons
 were killed, 900 wounded, and as many

 CENTRAL SOUTH BUREAU
 Tao Chu had developed a strong following in this
 region which he headed before he was brought into
 the inner circle of leaders around Mao and Lin in
 August 1966.   Consequently, when Tao fell from
 favor at the end of December, his replacement in
 the regional bureau and the first secretaries in
 four of the region's five provinces were implicated
 with him.   (Honan apparently had no first secretary
 at the time.)   All have appeared in semiofficial
 blacklists of Tao's followers distributed in Peking
 in January and February.
 Wang Jen-chung, the new first secretary of the
 Central South, was denounced by Madame Mao and
 other leaders at the end of December.  On 4 January
 she told a contingent of 'Red Guards from Canton to
 go home and arrest Wang, but whether they succeeded
 is unknown,  since nothing has been heard of his
 whereabouts since then.
 Although a major political struggle appears to have
 taken place in the Central South since December,
 relatively little disorder has been reported.
 Possibly key military commanders sided with Mao and
 Lin from the beginning to block attempts by polit-
 ical leaders to resist.   Some clashes were reported
 in Kwangtung, Honan,  and Hunan, but transportation
 services operated throughout the region with few
 disruptions.

 First Secretary Liu Chien-hsun, who has
 been in Peking since August, was identified

 Peking municipal committee.  Liu's replace-

 Honan was quiet last year. In late Feb-
 ruary and early March posters carried
 reports of clashes between the PLA and the
 rebels.  However, the trouble seems merely
 to have involved attempts by local military
 authorities, apparently on orders from
 Peking, to put, down unruly Red Guard groups.
 Although these groups complained bitterly
 in posters of their suppression by Chang
 Shu-chih,  commander of the Hunan Military
 District, he appeared early in March, and
 the military has been running the province
 since then.
 First Secretary Wang Jen-chung is concur-

 Bureau.   As noted above, he fell with his
 former boss Tao Chu at the end of December.

 SOUTHWEST BUREAU
 First Secretary Li Ching-chuan, who has been under
 bitter and heavy attack since the start of the

 brought down.   Li was criticized in a speech by

 activities" in Peking; Chou En-lai on 18 January
 stated that Li's "gang bosses" in the "control
 units" of the western district of Peking had been
 arrested; and a poster seen in Peking on 14 March
 charged Li with manipulating the Chungking municipal
 committee to cause the recent death of a revolu-
 tionary writer.   In addition, numerous posters and
 Red Guard newspapers since late December have
 linked Li with the Ho Lung conspirators and the
 Liu-Teng gang.  Poster photographs seen ii Peking
 on 10 February showed Li and other officials of the
 Southwest Bureau being paraded by Red Guards in
 Chengtu, Szechwan, probably in mid-January.
 Other bureau officials who have come under attack

 First Secretary Chang Kuo-hua,  also com-
 mander of the Tibet Military Region,
 presently appears to enjoy the support of
 Peking.   He has not made a public appear-

 in Lhasa on 1 October; however, Chang was
 alleged to have been in Lhasa on 3 April.

 First Secretary Liao Chih-kao has been
 bitterly attacked, and may have been
 paraded in mid-January with Li Ching-chuan
 and other officials.  Li Ta-chang, a party
 secretary,  and. vice governor Chang Hu-chen
 were also paraded at this time.   To date,
 no senior party cadres are known to be
 active.   Military officials  (from the
 Chengtu Military Region)  are running
 provincial affairs.  Wei Chieh, a deputy
 commander, and. Chu Yu-ting,  a deputy chief
 of staff,  and two other Chengtu Military
 Region officials, are the only officials
 noted active in the province since early
 January.

 First Secretary Chia Chi-yun, who was
 attacked by Red Guards last October, may
 have been purged; he certainly no longer
 holds a leading position in the province.
 The Kweichow party committee was abolished
 on 25 January,  and the "Kweichow Provincial
 Revolutionary Committee" which replaced it
 is headed by a. military man and a minor
 government functionary.   It is a military-
 run province.                                                   The only senior party man
 publicly participating in the new committee
 is Li Li,  a former provincial party secre-
 tary and governor.  Other members are the
 commander of the Kweichow Military District,
 the political commissar and a number of
 lesser military figures.  Li Tsia-han, one
 of the deputy political aommi'ssars,.is chair-
 man;, the deputy chairman is Chang Ming,
 who used to be deputy chief of the province's
 supply bureau.                                          25X1

 the military appears to have
 ept  a Eight lid on the province.   Although
 cited by Peking as an example of a revolu-
 tionary take-?over,  the preponderance of
 military officials in leading roles
 blatantly conflicts with the three-way
 model recommended by Peking, in which
 revolutionaries, party cadres, and the
 military all play important roles.
 First Secretary Yen Hung-yen died on 8 Jan-
 uary, probably at the hands of the Red
 Guards.   Chou. En-lai whitewashed the
 incident,  and. asserted that Yen had com-
 mitted suicide.   On 2 February a poster
 announced that the provincial and municipal
 (Kunming)  party committees had been seized
 on 26 January; however, Peking has yet to
 recognize a revolutionary take-over in
 this province, and no senior party offi-
 cials have been praised as "revolutionary
 cadres" either by Kunming Radio or by
 Peking.   A 27 March Kunming radiobroadcast
 stated that revolutionaries from the Kwei-
 chow Provincial Revolutionary Committee,
 acting as "advisers," and "leadership
 comrades" from the Kunming Military Region
 and the Yunnan Military District were as-
 sisting the Yunnan revolutionaries on the
 "problems" of forming three-way alliances
 and organizing revolutionary organizations.
 As in Kweichow and Szechwan, military
 officials are running provincial affairs.
 Li Ming,  a deputy commander of the Yunnan
 Military District, Li Hsi-fu,  a deputy
 political commissar,  and other lesser
 military officials are the only politically
 active persons identified since January.
