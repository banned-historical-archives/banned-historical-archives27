 WORLD COMMUNISM TODAY
 Before undertaking to consider the present position of the
 Communist Movement we may usefully recall its origins and develop-
 ment.  It is now 110 years since Karl Marx published the Communist
 Manifesto, certainly one of the most portentous documents in world
 history.  Since that time the development of the movement may be regarded
 as falling into three stages:  (1) the period before the Russian Revolution
 of 1917; (2) from 1917 until 1945; and (3) from 1945 to the present.
 During the second half of the 19th century, Marxist thought found
 considerable acceptance among working class and intellectual circles in
 Western Europe.  In an age of expanding capitalist enterprise and the
 growth of industrial proletariats, Marxts analysis of historical trends
 and economic phenomena seemed tothese peap to be valid, and it was
 adopted by many social reformers, politicians, economists, and trade
 unionists.  A number of the socialist parties which developed in the last
 decades of the century drew their doctrine from Marx and his collaborator
 and interpreter, Engels.
 Marxian socialism conceived itself to be an international movement.
 It held that the class interests of the workers were stronger than national
 ties to capitalistic societies, which were by definition conspiracies of
 exploitation.  To further the cause and to express their _SA  mon class

 interests, the socialist parties founded an international organization
 in 1884.  This was called the Second International since a previous
 one had. dissolved after the overthrow of the Paris Commune in 1871.
 The Second International ended amid the thunder of the First Woxld War.
 To the disapppintment of the doctrinaire Marxists, few members of the
 European working classes failed to respond to patriotic appeals in 1914.
 The second phase of Communist development begins with the
 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.  We are all familiar with the story of
 how a comparatively small party of revolutionary socialists, led by Lenin,
 seized power in the disorganized and war-weary country of the Czars
 and after three years of bloody civil strife established its rule.  One
 effect of the Russian revolution and the triumph of the Bolsheviks was
 to split the socialist parties throughout the world.  A majority of social-
 ists and their trade union allies rejected the brutal dictatorial methods
 of the Bolsheviks and determined to seek their objectives through demo-
 cratic processes.  Minority groups, however, advocated revolutionary
 methods and, calling themselves Communist parties, endorsed the
 Bolshevik model in Russia.  With the Russian Communist Party they
 formed the Third International, the Comintern.  Its headquarters were
 established in Moscow, The Bolsheviks considered this international
 organization of great importance, because, in keeping with Marxist
 doctrine, the permanence of the Soviet regime in Russia depended on

 Communist revolutions in some of the more advanced industrial
 countries.  Without such developments, a Communist Russia would
 succumb to capitalist encirclement and counter-revolution.  Communist
 revolutions were promoted in Hungary and Germany, but they were
 eventually suppressed.  Likewise, civil disorders instigated in Italy
 were quelled.  By the end of 1921 it was clear that the Communist
 revolution was not going to sweep west across Europe.
 The Comintern fell increasingly under Russian domination.
 Moscow became the source of doctrinal and financial support for the
 generally weak Communist parties outside of Russia and the haven for
 leaders exiled from their native lands.  Soviet control of International
 Communism was tightened after Stalin triumphed over his Kremlin rivals
 and embarked on the policy of "building socialism" in one country.  The
 protection of the Communist base became the first priority for all parties,
 and the Comintern developed into an agency of Soviet policy, a world-wide
 apparatus for subversion and espionage.
 Stalin dissolved the Comintern in 1943.  It was a handicap in his
 relations with the Western powers, upon whom Soviet Russia was heavily
 dependent at the time.  Moreover, Stalin perhaps foresaw that the
 Comintern would be an encumbrance to Soviet maneuver in the post-war
 world.

 This world since 1945 has, indeed, been a vastly different
 theater of action for International Communism.   Besides preserving
 the USSR as the base of the world movement and giving that country
 the prestige of a victorious power, the war resulted in several gains
 for Communism.  In the first place, it gave .the Soviet Union control of
 Eastern Europe where, under the protection of the Red Army, Commu-
 nist regimes were placed in power.  Secondly, it ended the political
 isolation or active repression of many of the Communist parties.  In
 most Western countries they achieved a temporary respectability, and
 in Italy and France they emerged as well organized mass parties.  In
 the third place, the war weakened the Nationalist government of China
 to the extent that it succumbed on the mainland to the Communist armies
 of Mao Tse-tung.
 These gains did not satisfy the Kremlin, and the post-war period
 has been characterized by continual aggressive action which has kept
 the non:-Communist world on the defensive.  The Communists have
 pursued their objectives by a variety of methods.  They have instigated
 and supported armed insurrection in such places as Greece and Malaya.
 In Korea, they launched a satellite state on what they hoped would be a
 quick military conquest.  Economic measures have varied from the
 strangulation tactics tried on Berlin to the attractive offers of trade

 and aid held out to any takers.  Meantime, a vigorous psychological
 warfare campaign has been waged.  In keeping with the zigzag char-
 acter of Communist tactics it has. changed back and forth from dire
 threats to calls for peace and cooperation.
 Two other aspects of the post-war period need to be noted.
 One is the rapid and substantial growth of the  Soviet Union as an
 industrial power.  Great advances have been registered in nearly all
 basic industries, and it is probable that the goals of the new Seven-
 Year Plan, which. is soon to. be presented at a party congress, will be
 substantially achieved.  The Soviet consumer has not received a large
 share of this economic development, but his lot has slowly improved.
 The second point to observe is the consolidation of Communist rule in
 China.  There we have been witnessing the transformation of an ancient
 society of more than. 600 million people into a regimented order which
 will certainly be an increasing factor in. the power configurations of the
 world.
 To summarize this brief survey of the development of the Com-
 munist movement, we see relatively small party elites in control of a
 vast area stretching across Eurasia from the Elbe and Danube to the
 Pacific. These regimes consider themselves to be in a perpetual state
 of conflict with the rest of the world.  They conduct this struggle, first,

 through the agencies. and with the resources of the states they rule,
 and secondly, through the world-wide apparatus of International
 Communism.
 Let us turn now, to a consideration of the present status of the
 Communist Movement.  We may start by surveying its composition,
 then its direction and coordination, and finally its strengths and weak-
 nesses for accomplishing the objective of converting the world to
 Communism.
 Beyond the borders of the.. Bloc, the Movement consists of two
 principal elements:  the Communist parties and an almost myriad number
 of organizations which we collectively term Communist fronts.  There
 are approximately eighty Communist parties in, the Free World. They
 exist in all countries except a few, such as Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia,
 where no organized political groups have developed.  In addition, there
 are parties in a number of British and French colonial territories.
 Almost half these parties are illegal organizations, being outlawed either
 by law or administrative decree.
 The Communist parties in the Free World vary greatly in size
 and influence.  Accurate membership figures for even the legal parties
 are difficult to obtain, but the Italian party with probably about 1, 500, 000
 members is regarded as the largest.  Other large parties and their

 estimated size are the Indonesian, 1, 000, 000; the French, 300, 000;
 the Indian, 200, 000; the Japanese, 80, 000; the Argentine, 80, 000; and
 the Brazilian, 50, 000.  Most of the other parties are small, some
 having only a few hundred members.
 Some of these parties have achieved a voting strength far exceed-
 ing their membership figures.  The Italian party since the war has
 regularly polled more than 20 percent of the total votes cast in national
 elections.  Until 1956, the PCI had an alliance with the Socialist Party
 of Italy which gave the two parties control of between 35 and 40 percent
 of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies.  Separately or in combination they
 have controlled a. considerable proportion of the local governments in
 Italy.  The Communist Party of France has attracted about one-quarter
 of the electorate since 1945.  In the last general election of the Fourth
 Republic it received 5.5 million votes and won 149 seats in the National
 Assembly.  The 80 percent affirmative vote for the DeGaulle constitution,
 which the PCF opposed, represented the first crackii i this voting Bloc,
 and it will be interesting to see if the coming general election confirms
 this decline in the Party's electoral strength.  It seems probable that it
 will, both because of popular enthusiasm for the new regime and because
 the revised voting system, abandoning proportional representation, is less
 favorable to the Communists.  In a number of other European countries,
 Communist voters have far outnumbered party members, although the

 Approved For Release 1999/09/08 : CIA-RDP80-01446R000100030004-0
 totals of both are small in comparison to the whole electorate and.
 the size of the major parties.  In the Netherlands, for example, the
 Communist party received 275, 000 votes in the last national election
 in 1956, but the estimated membership of the Party is only 15, 000.
 In Norway, a Communist party with an estimated membership of 6, 000
 polled ten times that number of votes in the general election of 1957.
 The Cireek Communists, outlawed since 1947 but controlling a party
 called the United Democratic Left, won 22 percent of the vote in a
 national election earlier this year, although they are believed to number
 only about 20, 000 entolled members.  In India,  11 million. votes were
 cast in 1957 for Communist candidates at a time when the Party had an
 estimated membership of 125, 000.
 Explanations for the voting strength of Communist parties must
 be soughti-m the. political and social conditions of each country.  Studies
 of the political situation in France and Italy have revealed that relatively
 few of the voters who cast ballots for Communist candidates believe in
 the doctrine of Communism or consider the Soviet Union an earthly paradise.
 The great majority are protesting against economic and social conditions,
 as well as relieving many real and fancied grievances, and the Communist
 party appeals to them as the most effective agent to voice their complaints.
 Not burdened with the responsibilities of office, the Communists. make liberal
 promises to all dissatisfied elements of the population.

 It is this last aspect of Communist tactics that probably
 accounts for the movement's growth in South and Southeast Asia.
 Over the past decade, the parties in most Western countries have
 been relatively stable, more often showing declines in membership
 and voting appeal than increases.  In countries such as India and Indo-
 nesia, however, a rapid growth has occurred.  There we have densely
 populated countries with low living standards which are attempting to
 carry out ambitious development programs.  Progress in the face of
 shortages of capital and skilled manpower is slow, and the inevitable
 difficulties and mistakes of inexperienced leaders are open to exploita-
 tion among people who expected independence to bring a rapid change
 in social and economic conditions.  The Communist Party of India is
 estimated to have doubled its membership in the past two years.  While
 still much smaller than the Congress Party, it forms the official opposi-
 tion in the national parliament, and it controls one of the fourteen state
 governments, Kerala.  The Indonesian party has recovered so quickly
 from the defeat it suffered a decade ago in an armed insurrection that it
 has threatened to become the country?s leading political organization.
 Faced with this prospect, the government, acting under the prompting
 of the A.rmy, has postponed the national elections scheduled for next year.
 It is the hope of the non-Communist leaders of the government that the
 other parties will utilize this postponement to compose some of their

 To date Communism has gained only minor strength in Africa,
 but the situation is. not one about which the Free World can feel compla-
 cent.  In South Africa a bitter racial struggle is developing which appears
 almost made-to-order for Communist exploitation.  To the north, several
 former colonial territories are embarking on the road of self-government,
 and their leaders face formidable problems in creating stable political
 systems and viable economies.  Among the small educated classes in
 these countries there are high expectations of rapid material progress.
 They may be seduced by the promises of Communism if advancement in
 cooperation with the countries of Western Europe and the Americas fails
 to satisfy their hopes.  Except for a small organization in. Tunisia, there
 are no legal Communist parties in Africa.  The Kremlin, however, will
 almost certainly extend its organizational efforts to Africa as the Commu-
 nist Bloc countries establish diplomatic relations with the governments of
 that continent and as trade and economic aid are promoted.
 Whether large or small, the Communist parties throughout the
 world are organized on the model of the CPSU.  Local cells of individual
 members form the base of a pyramid capped by a central committee and
 an inner politburo.  The larger parties have professional administrative
 staffs organized under a secretary of the central committee, and besides
 managing the party's affairs, these staffs publish newspapers and journals
 and often engage in a variety of business activities.

 The leadership of the party is in many cases composed of
 individuals of ability and vigor.  They have been trained in a rigorous
 school.  Advancement in an. organization notorious for feuds, and
 conspiracies requires a ruthlessness and. cunning not usually demanded
 of other political leaders.  In addition, the stamina to survive official
 repression is often needed by the Communist leader.  He has the benefit
 of an indoctrination that has elevated revolutionary activity to a science..
 It is taught in party schools at home and in the Bloc countries, and, it
 produces, along with the practical experience of party life, the tough,
 unprincipled but dedicated leader we see in a Thorez, a Togliatti, iw
 mow, or a Bagdash.  Wielding the strict disciplinary powers char-
 acteristic of all Communist parties, these leaders are faithful agents
 of the cause.
 Besides operating as a political party where they are legally
 permitted to do so, the Communists are constantly seeking to extend
 their control and influence into all sectors of national life.  Their pub-
 lishing activities have already been referred to.  In some countries these
 are very prolific.  Daily newspapers, weekly and monthly journals, and
 books carry the partyts message.  The trade unions are always an
 important target.   In France and Italy the Communists control the largest
 confederations of unions, and in Indonesia and India they have captured
 major elements of the labor movement.  In many other countries of the

 high positions.  Key sector s of the national economy - mining,
 transportation, communications - are frequent targets of Communist
 effort in the labor field.  Professional associations, schools and
 universities, government departments, cultural organizations, and
 organs of news and entertainment are all objects of Communist penetra-
 tion.  Wherever the Communist gains admission, his first loyalty is to
 the party, and he endeavors to exert his influence in accordance with
 party directions.
 In countries where the party is outlawed, it attempts to operate
 as actively as the security services permit.  The effectiveness of
 repression varies considerably from country to country.  In some
 countries the police are alert and the laws against Communist activity
 are sternly enforced.  In other places, several Middle Eastern countries
 for example, law enforcement is erratic, and the party operates with
 only occasional harassment.  A few years ago it was revealed in Iran
 that. a Communist cell was operating in a prison and maintaining regular
 communications with outside members of the party.  The moral is that
 governments seeking to repress Communist parties must realize tlat
 they are combatting a. most skillful and wily foe and that laws are dead-
 letters unless intelligently and consistently enforced.
 This leads us to a consideration of the second major element
 of the Communist Movement, namely, the numerous organizations which

 are promoted to enlist non-Communists in support of Communist
 objectives.  There are a great many of these so-called fronts which
 operate on a world-wide scale, and they are supported by literally
 hundreds of local and national organizations.  The methods of operation
 are ones which the Communists have skillfully developed.  Some cause
 of wide appeal is seized upon and prominent citizens are invited to help
 found an organization.  The Communists usually remain inconspicuous,
 but they work diligently behind the scenes to bend the organization to
 serve the purposes of the Movement.   They utilize all the tactics at which
 they are z.dept of capturing key offices, managing meetings, and proposing
 innocent-sounding but "loaded" resolutions.
 Currently, one of the most active of the global fronts is the
 World Peace Council.  A review of its activities for 1958 illustrates the
 organizing effort devoted to a major front and the way the Communists
 exploit a laudable purpose.  The WPC began the year by declaring March
 Est the "Day for Banning Nuclear Weapons. " Later that month it held a
 bureau meeting in New Delhi which was attended by delegates from
 twenty-nine countries. The delegates were received by Mr. Nehru,
 although later the Indian government had to deny a press report that he
 had addressed them in an official session.  The WPC joined with the
 Afro-Asian Solidarity Council , the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth, and the World Federation of Trade Unions in proclaiming March 30th
 as "Day of Solidarity with Algeria. " Through the International Institute

 for Peace, the name under which its Vienna headquarters operates,
 the WPC opened an International Club in Brussels to entertain visitors
 to the World Fair.  In May it was the sponsor of the Argentine. Congress
 for International Cooperation, General Disarmament and National
 Sovereignty.  At the end of the month the WPC held a meeting in Vienna
 to publicize the forthcoming Stockholm conference.  This, the World
 Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation, was the
 highlight of the year's activity.  The attendance of 1265 delegates was
 smaller than expected, probably because the campaign to raise money
 for travel expenses did not produce as much as had been hoped for.
 Nevertheless, some well-known citizens - authors, scientists, professors,
 and politicians - of Free World.Gountries were enlisted as sponsors or
 delegates.  Perhaps the tone of the speeches and resolutions is best
 conveyed in a report of Kuo Mo-jo, leader of the Chinese Communist
 delegation, in Peking on August 6th.  He said:
 In the past ten years the Peace Movement has been reluctant
 to show the US Government in its true colors; out of concern
 for our friends in the West, it has hesitated to post clearly
 the question of opposing imperialist aggression and colonial-
 ism . . . the Peace Movement has almost wandered on to the
 path of unprincipled pacifism.  At this Stockholm conference,
 however, the US imperialist aggression was denounced in
 outspoken language and the anti-colonialist movement given
 firm support.  We should record this as the greatest achieve-
 ment of the conference.
 Other activities of the WPC have included helping to organize
 the Fourth Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bornbs in Tokyo, the

 of Afro-Asian Writers at Tashkent.  Most of the resolutions of these
 meetings echo the current propaganda line from Moscow.
 Two other fronts operating on a global scale are the World
 Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students.
 They conduct activities as numerous as the World Peace Council.  They
 were the sponsors of the Moscow Youth Festival in 1957 which attracted
 approximately 35, 000 foreign visitors.  Another Festival, to meet in
 Vienna next year, is being planned.  The WFDY claims a membership
 of more than 85 million through 200 affiliated organizations in 97 countries.
 The principal Communist labor front is the World Federation of,
 Trade Unions.  Its identification with the political line of the Kremlin is
 well illustrated by the summarized statement of the main tasks for trade
 unions given by its secretary, Louis Saillant, at an executive committee
 meeting in Budapest last spring.  These tasks were:
 (1)  Unite the workers in each country and help them to
 with all sections who are actively working for peace.
 (2)  Join with the national Peace Committees in preparing
 for the World Conference for Disarmament and Interna-
 tional Cooperation, and send broad and representative
 delegations.
 (3)
 Be at the head of the mass struggle and every decisive
 action to obtain:  (a)  a summit meeting; (b) prohibition
 of rocket bases and atomic bomb flights;  (c) the ending
 of thermonuclear testing, and ban on the manufacture
 and use of mass destruction weapons; (d)  zones cleared
 of such weapons, as proposed by the Rapacki Plan;
 (e)  development of trade and cultural relations between
 all countries.

 (4)  Increase exchanges of fraternal delegations of
 trade unions and workers.
 These points were faithfully repeated in resolutions adopted at
 conferences of international uniiis affiliated with the WFTU.  The themes
 of "peace" and "banning atomic bombs" were prominent.
 Among Communist fronts, the friendship societies comprise
 a whole galaxy.  Societies for promoting friendly relations with the
 Soviet Union exist in many countries, and they are supplemented by
 Chinese and Satellite groups.  They concentrate on the promotion of
 economic and cultural connections between a country and the Bloc and
 avoid the more obvious kinds of Communist propaganda activities.  Thus
 they attract a certain number of well-meaning people who feel that they
 are contributing to peace and international understanding.
 A listing of Communist fronts: would be tediously long.  Besides
 the national affiliates of the global fronts, such as the World Federation
 of Trade Unions and the Women's International Democratic Federation,
 there are usually scores of local societies.  Some of them have only a
 temporary existence, perhaps organized to protest a governmental action,
 a court decision, or the military move of a Western government.  Their
 purpose is to enlist the aiupport of unwitting non-Communists, collect
 money, and spread propaganda without revealing the party label.  They
 also serve to identify Communist sympathizers who can sometimes be

 induced to engage in other useful activity, not excluding espionage.
 All this vast effort must be recognized as an important element of
 International Communism.  The Communist governments and the parties
 outside the Bloc devote tremendous amounts of organizing effort to these
 front activities, and we should not under-rate their usefulness to the
 M.orement.
 How is this tremendous network of Communist parties and fronts
 directed and the activities of all components coordinated?  That there is
 central direction and coordination is clear from the unanimity and
 consistency with which Communists around the world take the same
 positions on international issues, praise and condemn the same things,
 and repeat the same slogans.
 Some of this direction and coordination is easily achieved.  Indoc-
 trination in Marxism-Leninism provides basic guidelines for Communists
 everywhere.  For current tactics, Radio Moscow, Pravda, and other
 authoritative sources provide rapid guidance.  If a comrade misses them,
 he will soon hear the echoes from Prague, Budapest, or Peking.  For
 questions of a deeper, ideological nature there is the new monthly journal
 published in Prague.  Called Problems of Socialism and directed by a
 former editor of the Soviet ideological journal Kommunist,  it indicates
 what is currently orthodox and what is "revisionist" in doctrinal matters.
 It is printed in some fifteen languages.

 Coordinating the activities of the global front organizations
 presents the Kremlin with no great problems.  The headquarters and
 the essential offices in each case are occupied by experienced Com-
 munists who have good communications with an appropriate department
 of the CPSU in Moscow.
 For the longer range and more complex aspects of Communist
 planning there exists the close liaison between the parties.  In this
 the Soviet, the Chinese Communist, and the European Satellite diplomatic
 missions play a part.  Their regular liaison with the national parties
 outside the Bloc is supplemented by numerous bilateral and multilateral
 meetings of party leaders.  More than sixty party delegations gathered
 in Moscow last November for the celebration of the Fortieth Anniversary
 of the Bolshevik Revolution, and for several days there were business
 meetings as well as social events.  Scarcely a week passes without some
 Communist leader traveling to Moscow.  Fraternal delegations are
 exchanged for party congresses and national celebrations.  All these
 occasions provide opportunities for serious discussions of party problems
 and the securing of the Kremlin's counsel.  Moscow's advice is very
 persuasive.  For any leader who questions it, the whole apparatus can
 be mobilized to insure a rapid purging. Tito is the dnly Communist who
 has successfully withstood the wrath of the Kremlin.

 One of the basic facts of our world is the existence of
 this powerful, expansive movement which, despite talk of peaceful
 coexistence, is in conflict with all nations and institutions that it
 does not dominate.  No country, no people can stand aside and declare
 that the struggle is of no concern to it or them.  The Communists will
 not accept a really neutral attitude.  Given this situation, what can we
 say of the present state of the battle?
 In general, we would have to admit, I believe, that the outcome
 is still in the balance.  Two years ago, in 1956, the Communist world
 experienced a considerable crisis.     Khrushchevts secret speech confessing
 to the mistakes and crimes of Stalin shook all the Communist parties and
 front organizations.  It was followed by troubles in Poland and the bloody
 revolt in Hungary.   For a few months Communism stood revealed as the
 tyranny it is.  Some optimists in the West began to talk of its early
 collapse.  They reckoned, however, without an understanding of the
 strong recuperative powers which the Movement possesses.
 Faced with revolts in the Satellites, rumblings of discontent
 in the USSR and China, and defections in. the parties outside the Bloc,
 the leaders of Communism set about stabilizing the Movement.  By
 vigorous measures they have largely succeeded in reestablishing
 discipline and control.  Casualties there were, but the wounds are
 proving to be far from mortal.

 Contributing to this stabilization process have been the
 impressive economic and scientific achievements of the Soviet Union
 and the growth in power of Communist China.  They have diverted
 attention from the despotic features of life under Communism and
 given the impression that progress can be achieved. more rapidly by
 Communist mbthods.
 The picture which the Communist Bloc presents of its real and
 anticipated achievements is especially attractive in many areas of Asia
 and: Africa.  Here people are seeking the same goals - industrialization,
 education, and rising living standards.  The methods advocated by the
 Western world seem pedestrian and tainted by connections with a
 colonial past.  The Communists are making a strong bid in the great
 belt: across Africa and southern. Asia.  By political action and military
 aid they are posing as the friend and protector of newly independent states.
 Loans and trade. agreements are readily arranged.  The front organiza-
 tions work assiduously to cultivate these people and convince them of
 an identity of interest between themselves and the Communist world.
 In all these efforts the Communists are registering successes.  The
 Communist parties of India and Indonesia have been growing.   While the
 Arab states are hostile to local Communists, they regard the Bloc
 countries as benevolent powers.  Communism as the protagonist of
 nationalism and material progress has made a strong impression among

 the young states, of Asia and Africa.
 One weakness to which the Communists admit - or at least
 they devote much time and effort to combatting it - is revisionism.
 This is a term of no precise content.  In general, it means any tendency
 to question an article of faith in Marxism-Leninism.  A revisionist may
 be one who questions the priority of heavy industry in a communist state,
 the party's monopoly of political power, socialist realism as. the highest
 form of artistic expression, or the relevance of all Soviet experience
 in building socialism.  Communist Yugoslavia is being denounced daily
 as the source and inspiration of present-day revisionism.  Since some
 aspects of Yugoslav communism are practiced within the Bloc - peasant
 proprietorship in Poland, for example. - one concludes that a refusal to be
 an undeviating disciple of the Kremlin, euphemistically known as proletarian
 internationalism, constitutes the essence of Titots sin.
 While schisms are damaging to an ideological movement that
 pretends to be based on immutable principles, non-Communists should
 not exaggerate the problems these deviations create for the Bloc, both
 internally and in its expansion abroad.  They provide opportunities for
 campaigns of indoctrination and stir the party cadres to greater militancy.
 Orthodoxy, supported by all the instruments of power and propaganda,
 may be strengthened in the end.

 There are some entries on the other side of the ledger which
 are credits for the non-Communist world.  One is that since the
 Communist victory in China, no country has chosen to join the Bloc.
 Communist control of northern Viet-nam has received de facto recognition,
 but otherwise the boundary of the Free World has not been, breached.
 Attempts at armed insurrection have all been defeated - in Greece, in
 Indonesia, in the Philippines, in Malaya, and in Burma.
 Another credit item for the Free World is the decline of Com-
 munist strength in Western Europe.  The parties in Italy and France,
 are still large, but their ability to paralyze the machinery of the state
 has been reduced.  It seems probable that the next parliamentary
 elections in France will see the Communist bloc of 150 deputies cut
 to a third of that number.  Elsewhere in Western Europe the parties
 have little more than a nuisance value.
 Additionally on the credit side we can place the fact of a better
 appreciation of the Communist danger.  This awareness varies from
 area to area, and even from country to country.  In Western Europe
 it has turned a considerable degree of tolerance into strong aversion.
 The Berlin blockade, Czechoslovakia, Korea, Khrushchev's revelations
 about Stalin, and Hungary have had a cumulative impact.  Even in the
 Afro-Asian. area which the Communists are wooing so ardently, voices
 of caution are being heard.  This awareness can also be documented in

 this hemisphere.  In the recent elections in Brazil, Communist
 endorsement was a handicap rather than an aid to any candidate.
 The credit side of the ledger does not add up to enough to
 give us any cause for complacency.  In International Communism
 we face a most formidable foe.  It now operates from a vast territorial
 base, controls almost a billion people, and wields great resources
 of power and influence.  Its apparatus throughout the Free World works
 constantly to undermine, divide, and confuse its enemies.  Part-time,
 half-hearted resistance will not be enough, for the kind of civilization
 we cherish is definitely at stake.
