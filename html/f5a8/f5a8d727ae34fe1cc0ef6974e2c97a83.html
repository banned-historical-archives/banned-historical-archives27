 Composition of the New Politburo
 The new Politburo, elected on 19 August, is a veteran
 group dominated by aged party bureaucrats and profes-
 sional military men.   As a group it favors moderate,
 pragmatic solutions to China's problems.  The leftist
 ideologues of the 9th and 10th Politburos have been
 purged; this Politburo does not appear to have an ideo-
 logue.  Although the new Poliburo is more united than
 either the 9th or 10th, there is tension between those
 members who supported Teng Hsiao-ping's rehabilitation
 and those who opposed it, and potential tension between
 civilians and military men.
 The accompanying chart gives the approximate age,
 top posts, and backgrounds of each member of the 11th
 Politburo.  New members are indicated by an asterisk.

 Premier; Chairman         to top after Chou En-1a1 died and Politburo
 Military Commission;      too divided to agree on anyone else. Has no
 Minister of Public        real power base, but is attempting to
 Security                  build one. Reportedly uneasy about Teng's
 rehabilitation. Hua is an excellent admin-
 istrator. Probably will surrender Premier
 and Public Security posts at 5th National
 People's Congress (NPC) this fall.

 Teng was heir apparent to Chou, but
 Hua reaped the benefits after Teng's fall.

 with, but excellent administrator.
 Very popular with masses and veteran
 party, government, and military cadres.
 Some Politburo members opposed Teng's re-
 habilitation fearing he would eventually
 monopolize all power. May be named Premier
 at 5th NPC.
 Economic expert. Former close associate
 of late Chou En-lai. Supported Teng
 when Teng ousted in 1976.
 Long time Mao bodyguard. Big gainer

 ORPA
 Eleventh Party Congress:   Loose Ends
 Unlike its two predecessors, the 11th Party Congress
 was not a stop along the way to further domestic political
 turmoil, but seemed genuinely to mark a new stage in
 China's development.   The congress was pervaded with a
 sense of general agreement on overall economic goals and
 a desire to put a more orderly and predictable face on
 political behavior.   Nevertheless, Hua Kuo-feng's effort
 to explain events of the recent past--especially his own
 elevation and Mao's relationship with the "gang of four"--
 left some questions unanswered and even raised new ones.
 The personnel decisions of the congress, moreover, probably
 caused some consternation among middle-aged and young
 officials who found the door to upward mobility slammed
 firmly in their faces.
 In an apparent effort to disassociate Mao from Teng
 Hsiao-ping's former political difficulties, Hua Kuo-feng
 addressed himself to each quotation from Mao that the
 leftists had used last year against Teng.   He attempted
 to put these statements in a larger political perspective
 that left the clear impression that the statements were
 not directed at Teng.  This served the dual purpose of
 trying to restore Mao's good name to Teng's supporters--
 a move vital to Hua who owes his position to Mao's good
 judgment in choosing him--and of clearing away, for the
 public record at least, any lingering suspicions that the
 case against Teng was legitimate.
 The problem--one that is likely to dog Hua for the
 duration of Teng's political life--is to explain the
 apparent contradiction between Mao's selection of Teng
 in 1975 to head the day-to-day work of the party and his
 selection of Hua for the same job the following year.   If
 Mao in fact was at odds with the "gang of four" and dis-
 agreed with their efforts to unseat Teng, why did he
 choose Hua as first vice chairman of the party in 1976
 rather than Teng?  Hua cannot explain this and made no
 effort to.   Instead, he slid over the events of early
 1976, indicating Mao's choice of someone to take over

 the work of the party in January 1976 without actually
 naming himself.  The January date remains troublesome
 because Hua was not named first vice chairman of the
 party until April.   In January, leaving Teng out of the
 equation, Hua was outranked in the party by such officials
 as Yeh Chien-ying, Li Hsien-nien, and Chi Teng-kuei, all
 of whom seemed at least as likely as Hua to assume that
 role.   Nevertheless, even Yeh Chien-ying in his speech
 to the congress claimed that Mao picked Hua in January,
 an interesting point for Yeh to make since he had already
 left Peking by that time in a rage over Teng's failure
 to be named premier.
 The current leaders may have glanced knowingly at
 one another when Hua announced that the Cultural Revolu-
 tion was over after 11 years, but this will raise prob-
 lems for future generations.  The 11-year period includes
 two purges of Teng Hsiao-ping and two rehabilitations of
 him; it encompasses the rise of Lin Piao and his fall and
 the rise of the gang and their fall.   It was not, as the
 Chinese seek to portray it, a straight line leading pro-
 gressively toward current policies, but a circle that
 has left China essentially back where it was before the
 Cultural Revolution started.  The current leadership, of
 Mao's generation and having lived through the Cultural
 Revolution, needs to maintain a fiction about that period
 so as not to discredit Mao or ignore the past entirely.
 Future generations that did not live through that period
 and will not have experienced Mao's leadership may not
 feel the same need to put a gloss on the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and, in any case, will have difficulty reconciling
 the earlier stages of the Cultural Revolution with the
 later stages that overturned it.  Consequently, it seems
 almost inevitable that a more realistic assessment of the
 Cultural Revolution and Mao's role in it will emerge in
 the future.  That reassessment in turn will reflect poorly
 on the pronouncements of the 11th Party Congress and on
 Hua Kuo-feng himself, who perpetrated the fictionalized
 version of the Cultural Revolution in the first place.
 Another reason for future generations to look back
 on this congress with some dismay is its treatment of
 young and middle-aged officials.  After years of dominat-
 ing the leadership, much of the old guard has at last died
 off, a process that in theory should have created some
 head-room for the younger officials who have been waiting

 so long in the wings.   Instead, what is left of the old
 guard got the empty seats on the Politburo and were named
 to the party central committee.  The only allowance the
 congress made for grooming the next crop of leaders was
 a rather brief statement by Hua Kuo-feng on the need for
 younger officials to learn from the veterans and for the
 veterans to help younger officials to correct their mis-
 takes.   Implicit in this statement was the view that
 veterans do not make mistakes, but that younger officials
 inevitably do.
 This position, as distasteful as it may be for younger
 officials, is probably a wise tactical move by Hua.  As
 a middle-aged official himself and one without a strong
 independent base of support, Hua needs to keep the veteran
 .officials in his camp and seems to have gone out of his
 way to pay homage to them.

 Hua and Teng:   Getting By With a Little Help From Their
 Friend
 The 11th Party Congress, which dwelt at length on
 the need for greater party unity, discussed not only the
 factionalism that split the party from 1966 to 1976, but
 also tried to assuage fears that Party Chairman Hua
 Kuo-feng and Vice Chairman Teng Hsiao-ping, the dominant
 figures on the new Politburo, have become rivals.
 The Congress and the meetings preceding it took every
 opportunity to portray Hua and Teng as partners and to
 dispel any notion that they may be at odds.   In his widely
 circulated speech to the third Plenum of the 10th Party
 Congress in July, Teng praised Hua at length and promised
 to serve as his "good assistant."   Teng also said that
 he, the late Premier Chou En-lai, and Party Vice Chairman
 Yeh Chien--ying first tapped Hua for the succession in
 1975--as if to imply that Hua's rise to the top was
 accomplished with Teng's blessing and not at his expense.
 In his speech to the 11th Party Congress, Hua cast Teng
 and himself as allies in the fight against the leftists.
 Completing the picture of unity,  Teng made the official
 announcement at the congress that Hua had been elected
 chairman of the party--a nice touch because, but for an
 odd series of events, Teng himself might have been elected
 chairman.   Hua's speech went to great lengths to repudiate
 leftist claims that veteran officials like Teng were
 "capitalist roaders."  Although Hua undoubtedly was re-
 ferring to the many veterans who have been newly elected
 to the Central Committee and Politburo, his constant re-
 futation of the capitalist roader charge in particular
 seemed aimed at clearing Teng, since only a year ago he
 was called the biggest unrepentant capitalist roader in
 the party.
 The Teng and Hua accounts of their earlier relation-
 ship are creatively rewritten versions of the actual situa-
 tion.   Hua reached the top only because Teng fell, and
 it is doubtful that Teng ever seriously promoted Hua's
 career.

 Articles appeared in the Peking press
 that seemed to oppose Teng's return, while others suggested
 Hua was being pressured by Teng's supporters.
 Hua and Teng see eye to eye on most issues, but ap-
 parently differ on how to proceed against the remaining
 supporters of the purged leftists.   Teng,
 apparently favors a much tougher approach
 than Hua.   In his speech to the Third Plenum, Teng called
 for vigorous prosecution of the campaign, and intimated
 that the basic reason for his fall in 1976 was that he
 was too soft on his leftist opponents.   In his speech to
 the congress, Hua called for a quick end to the campaign,
 set strict limits on permissible targets, and counseled
 leniency.   Hua's position was endorsed by the new Central
 Committee.
 Teng's conception of his proper role in the leader-
 ship is more likely to cause friction between the two
 men than policy differences. Teng clearly sees himself
 as playing a very large role, and Hua may feel threatened.
 Teng has already dee 1  involved himself in the economy
 and foreign polic
 and it seems unlikely that a man of Teng's
 assertive nature and long experience would readil  accept
 a role secondary to the younger Hua.
 Yeh Chien-ying, who is 79 and frail, seems to be the
 key to holding the potential rivalries on the Politburo
 in check.   The 11th Party Congress was made possible
 largely through Yeh's efforts.   Yeh, who has been one of
 Teng's most ardent backers, reportedly put together a
 compromise that allowed Teng to return and assured the
 anti-Teng people that they would not suffer at the congress
 for their earlier opposition.   Yeh, who has consistently
 lent his prestige to Hua of late, appears to be seeing
 to it that all parties abide by the agreement.   As long
 as Yeh is around to rein in Teng and bolster Hua's prestige,
 the chance of a serifl?G falling out between the two men
 is greatly reduced.

 The Eleventh Party Congress and Provincial Leadership
 The recent 11th Party Congress apparently marks
 the beginning of the reconstruction of the provincial
 party organizations and the end of the purges and major
 reshuffling at that level which have characterized the
 period since the ouster of the "gang of four" last
 October.   The election of all 29 provincial party first
 secretaries to full membership in the Central Committee
 reinforces the status of the 13 newly appointed lead-
 ers and confirms the political health of the 16 holdovers.
 The ouster of "gang" supporters from the provin-
 cial committees over the last 10 months has left many
 provincial party units understaffed, but the integrity
 of this remaining core group is attested to by the high
 percentage of remaining officials chosen for Central
 Committee membership.   Provincial broadcasts and, most
 recently, Chairman Hua's opening address at the Party
 Congress have made it clear that much investigation,
 education, and rebuilding remain to be done at the
 local levels.   The composition of the new Central Com-
 mittee indicates that the slate has been wiped clean
 and the leaders have been selected to begin this work
 of recreating a stable, correct, and responsive party
 organization in the provinces.
 The election of all 29 first secretaries to full
 membership in the new Central Committee suggests both
 the organizational importance of that group to party
 affairs and, on a personal level, the resolution of a
 number of outstanding cases.   Individuals such as Tseng
 Shao-shan from Liaoning and Wu Te from Peking, whose
 involvement in the anti - Teng Hsiao-ping campaign in
 1976 had left their political fortunes in doubt, ap-
 parently have made satisfactory amends.   The same seems
 to be true of their corresponding Military Region Com-
 manders, Li Te-sheng and Chen Hsi-lien.   It appears
 that for now the central authorities value a consoli-
 dated leadership in the provinces over a potentially
 troublesome, if somewhat more thorough, continuation
 of the housecleaning of provincial leaders.

 From another angle, the importance of the provincial
 leaders can be seen in the inclusion of five first sec-
 retaries, as well as Shanghai's second and third sec-
 retaries, on the Politburo.   It should be noted, how-
 ever, that a number of these men serve primarily in
 Peking.   In the case of Shanghai,  Su Chen-hua and Ni
 Chih-fu appear to have left the day-to-day management
 of the city to Peng Chung, also a Politburo member.
 Sinkiang's Saifudin has appeared only sporadically in
 his home province since the central work conference in
 March.   This, coupled with the recent appointment of
 new second and third secretaries in Sinkiang, suggests
 that Saifudin may leave many of his secretarial duties
 to others in order to free himself for other work in
 Peking.
 The representation of provincial party committees
 in the Central Committee makes it clear that Peking has
 paid a great deal of attention not only to the first
 secretaries, but to the provincial party organization
 as a whole.  More than 43 percent of the full Central
 Committee members and 25 percent of the alternates hold
 a position on a provincial party committee, for a total
 membership of over 36 percent.  More important, however,
 is the fact that of the total number of persons of
 deputy secretary rank or higher known to be active in
 provincial party committees, more than 57 percent are
 members of the new Central Committee.   That is to say,
 every second person of secretary rank in the provinces
 belongs to the Central Committee.   The net effect is
 the existence of a newly endorsed core group of polit-
 ical leaders at the helm in the various provinces as
 restaffing at the lower levels begins.
 The Party Congress paid a great deal of attention
 to the problems of maintaining a stable and responsive
 provincial apparatus.   The interference of the "gang
 of four" in the provinces, most importantly in operat-
 ing outside the party's chain of command, may still
 concern the central leadership.  Hua's call for further
 education and work style rectification of cadres in the
 provinces is only the most recent example of central
 concern.   A number of provinces have already announced
 plans for widespread investigations and rectification
 during the last half of this year.   This same concern
 is also expressed in new provisions of the party con-
 stitution which call for the establishment of

 investigative units within each party organization.
 These units may function in a way similar to the con-
 trol commissions set up in the party following the Kao-
 Jao affair in the mid-1950s, thus providing Peking with
 a theoretically independent check on the lower levels.
 In summary, Peking has cleaned house in the pro-
 vincial leadership, given its seal of approval to a
 nucleus of trusted officials, set up further controls
 on the functioning of lower level party organizations,
 and called for a thorough reeducation and change in
 work style throughout the country.

 The Military and the Eleventh Party Congress
 A preliminary accounting of the number of military
 men elected to Chinese Communist Party leadership bodies
 suggests that the percentage of career military men on
 the Politburo has risen to about 39 percent (10 of 26
 members), while the military proportion of the Central
 Committee has dropped from 32 percent at the 10th Congress
 to. about 29 percent at the 11th.
 While such figures are useful in terms of assessing
 the overall position of the PLA vis-a-vis the party, there
 are certain qualifications which must be taken into
 account.   The most troublesome is the problem of dual
 responsibilities.   Nearly all the provincial first party
 secretaries  (mostly civilians)  have concurrent military
 responsibilities as first political commissars of the
 relevant military regions or districts.   These are not
 simply honorary positions, particularly given the in-
 creasing emphasis within the PLA itself on decision-mak-
 ing by the entire party committee, not just the commander.
 Thus, these individuals hold very important positions
 within the military chain of command.   For example, An
 Ping-sheng,  first secretary of Yunnan Province, is ordi-
 narily considered a civilian, even though he holds the
 positions of first political commissar, Kunming Military
 Region  (MR), first political commissar, Yunnan Military
 District  (MD),  and most importantly, first secretary of
 the MR party committee.   He is clearly one of the key
 military officials in the area.
 The reverse, that is when an individual who has
 primarily held military responsibilities is given a civil-
 ian position, is also important.   Yu Tai-chung, for ex-
 ample, is the commander of the Inner Mongolian Military
 District.   He is also first secretary of the Inner Mon-
 golian Autonomous Region party committee and makes the
 vast majority of his public appearances in that capacity.
 Yet he is usually considered a military representative
 on the new Central Committee.

 There is a certain artificiality in making fine
 distinctions about the new Central Committee on the basis
 of military affiliations.   If all those who hold military
 positions of any kind are included in the military cate-
 gory the proportion of the PLA on the Politburo becomes
 69 percent and 45 percent for full members of the Central
 Committee.
 A more useful categorization would be to separate
 those individuals holding concurrent military and civilian
 responsibilities from those holding purely military posts.
 As a result of the 11th Party Congress, these "double-
 dippers" constitute roughly 45 percent of the Politburo
 and 17 percent of the Central Committee.   Those who have
 only military titles, on the other hand, represent 23
 percent of the Politburo and 21 percent of the Central
 Committee.
 Perhaps a more important characteristic of the PLA
 representation on the party's ruling body is the increased
 equation between Central Committee membership and command
 influence.  Whereas the 10th Central Committee contained
 a number of model soldiers or politically active (leftist)
 cadres at the military district level, the 11th Central
 Committee military contingent constitutes the most senior
 level of the PLA high command.
 For example, there are now 11 members of the General
 Staff Department who hold positions on the new Central
 Committee, as opposed to only six on the previous commit-
 tee.                       There were a total of 38 members of the central
 military hierarchy elected to the new committee, a gain
 of 11.  (Thirteen members of the 10th Central Committee
 who held central military positions were dropped and 24
 new central military officeholders were added.)
 At the MR level, the total number of Central Commit-
 tee members remained roughly the same, 51 on the 11th
 Central Committee and 49 on the 10th.   All 11 MR commanders
 (including Yang Yung, who has not yet formally received
 a new appointment)  are full members, as are 25 of 27 of
 the known MR political commissars.
 Military district representation on the new Central
 Committee, however, was cut back somewhat.   Only six MD
 or major municipal garrison commanders made the new
 committee, while all of the MD and garrison first polit-
 ical commissars, most of whom are civilian provincial

 first secretaries, were elected full members.  Those PLA
 officers who hold secretary positions in the provinces
 were largely slighted, compared to their civilian counter-
 parts, in gaining Central Committee membership.   Thus,
 the slight loss in total PLA representation on the 11th
 Central Committee was largely absorbed at the MD level
 and below.

 The Eleventh Part y Congress and Educational, Cultural,
 and Scientific Policy
 There were no surprises in the statements made about
 science and technology, education, and culture at the
 11th Party Congress.  As expected, the Congress reaffirmed
 recent policies designed to upgrade science and technology,
 improve the quality of education, and relax some of the
 constraints on cultural life.
 The most visible sign of the party's commitment to
 these policies was the appointment of Fang I, vice pres-
 ident and acting head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 to the Politburo.   Fang, who was appointed to his post
 at the Academy of Sciences in January, has many years
 of experience in managing economic, scientific, and tech-
 nological programs.   Since taking charge of the Academy,
 he appears to have spearheaded efforts to reorganize the
 Academy, to upgrade its research programs, and to permit
 more freedom of debate in the sciences.   His presence on
 the Politburo is certain to strengthen his hand, and in-
 deed documents from the Congress made repeated calls for
 more open discussion of scientific issues.
 In his political report to the Congress, Party Chair-
 man Hua Kuo-feng committed himself--and the party--to the
 new policies.   He called for efforts to upgrade basic
 research, to draw up long-range research plans, and to
 reward scientists who make significant contributions.
 He noted that a national conference on science and tech-
 nology would be held "at an appropriate time," presumably
 in early 1978, to expedite these efforts.
 In his comments on education, Hua noted that students
 should be not only politically reliable, but also pro-
 fessionally competent.   To this end, educational facili-
 ties should be expanded at all levels and the quality of
 the education they offer upgraded.   He called for more
 diversity in cultural life and more freedom of thought--
 "letting a hundred flowers bloom"--in literature and the
 arts, but he stressed that it was still imperative for
 the party to retain strict control and maintain discipline.

 Hua condemned the gang of four for attacking intel-
 lectuals as "the stinking ninth category."   Although he
 conceded that many intellectuals lacked complete commit-
 ment to Maoist ideology, he pointed out that China needed
 their talents and ability.   Rather than attacking them,
 he said, the party should put their knowledge to use while
 trying to reeducate them.
 Hua implied that there might be a review of one of
 the most unpopular policies related to intellectuals--
 the policy of sending large numbers of middle school
 graduates to the countryside to work.   He asserted that
 this policy was necessary and should continue, but added
 that problems caused by the practice must be dealt with
 effectively.
 Although Hua reaffirmed the general tone of recent
 policies, he failed to spell out how they would be im-
 plemented.   Perhaps this is because of some resistance
 to the new ideas.   Particularly vulnerable to criticism
 are plans to modify the policy of sending young people
 to work in the countryside by allowing a few to go directly
 to universities without first doing an obligatory stint
 of labor.   Recent reports suggests that there is some
 debate about certain other educational reforms as well.
 A number of schools, for example, have been unable to
 agree on the proper way to reintroduce exams--whether to
 have traditional written examinations or group discussion
 examinations and pzactical tests of knowledge.   While
 some of this uncertainty may be a result of the tradi-
 tional reluctance of educators to respond to policy shifts
 for fear that they are not permanent, there is some evi-
 dence that leftist influence in the universities has not
 been totally eradicated.

 Reforming the Chinese Academy of Sciences
 One of the focal points of China's efforts to upgrade
 its science and technology has been the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences, the country's leading center for scientific re-
 search.  Since the Cultural Revolution, the work of the
 Academy has been hamstrung by leftist policies in science
 and education.   In order to revitalize the Academy, the
 Chinese. Government appointed a new acting head, Fang I,
 in January 1977 and apparently gave him a mandate to over-
 haul the Academy and step up its research programs.
 Fang I's efforts
 have begun to bear fruit.   Research programs have been re-
 stored, and in a number of the Academy's institutes, theo-
 retical research programs, neglected since the Cultural
 Revolution, have been introduced.   Under a new policy,
 five days of the week must be spent exclusively on scien-
 tific research, something unthinkable in the heyday of
 leftist influence, when political meetings or practical
 work were considered of great importance.   In addition,
 a number of scientists dismissed during the Cultural
 Revolution have been reinstated to their jobs.  Libraries
 have been reopened, new journals and publications have
 been issued, and academic seminars have been held regu-
 larly.
 The Academy is also trying to meet its need for
 young, well-trained scientists.  To this end, it has
 emphasized the importance of upgrading the China Scien-
 tific and Technical University, once the main center for
 training physicists and engineers.  The university was
 once located in Peking, where its students could work
 at the Academy of Sciences, but was moved to Anhwei Prov-
 ince during the Cultural Revolution.  There it became a
 provincial technical university.

 stress academic performance as well as political reli-
 ability.   In addition, it declared that the university
 should become primarily a center for scientific re-
 search and that its main job should be the training of
 research scientists.
 Many of these reforms are badly needed.   Since the
 Cultural Revolution, the Academy of Sciences and the
 China Scientific and Technical University have been
 fraught with problems.   Research programs have been dis-
 rupted and, in some cases, halted.   Some of the Academy's
 institutes were disbanded, and others were moved to the.
 provinces or subordinated to other agencies.  Many of its
 scientists were dismissed or sent to work in factories or
 communes.   In one of the research offices of the Peking
 Astronomical Observatory, for instance, 33 out o_f 38
 scientists and technicians were forced to leave their jobs.
 New scientists recruited by the academy were often poorly
 trained and incapable of doing sophisticated research.
 The recent reforms, although helpful, solve only a
 few of the problems facing Chinese science and technology
 and often skirt the most basic difficulties.  Unless, for
 instance, the China Scientific and Technical University
 is returned to Peking where its students will have access
 to the facilities and resources of the Academy of Sciences,
 many of the reforms there are likely to be short-lived.
 The dilemma facing the Academy of Sciences and China's
 science and technology in general is that a large number
 of intractable problems have to be solved before the sit-
 uation can be substantially improved.  Not only do re-
 search programs have to be restored, but incompetent
 people hired since the Cultural Revolution need to be
 weeded out, competent scientists need to be trained,
 communications between scientists throughout the country
 need to be improved, and blurred lines of authority in the
 scientific establishment need to be clarified.  Because of
 the neglect that education and science and technology have
 suffered over the past decade, solution of these problems
 is likely to require a number of years.

 Party Constitution:   Promoting Discipline and Stability
 The constitution adopted by the 11th Chinese Party
 Congress contains specific measures that seem calculated
 to promote discipline and stability in the party.   Most
 of the measures restore procedures that were part of the
 constitution adopted during the eighth Party Congress,
 the last one before the Cultural Revolution.   That con-
 stitution did not prevent the excesses of the Cultural
 Revolution, and the factionalism that followed, largely
 because the constitution was ignored. The reintroduction
 of some of the  provisions of the earlier constitution
 indicates that the current leadership is committed to re-
 storing some aspects of pre - Cultural Revolution politi-
 cal norms.   The principal changes in the constitution
 involve procedures by which new party members are re-
 cruited and some adjustments to party organization.
 Membership
 The new constitution reintroduces:
 -- A one-year probationary period for candi-
 date party members, during which they can-
 not vote or hold party office.
 -- An interview with candidate members by a
 representative of a party committee an
 echelon above the one that recruited
 him.
 -- A requirement that high-level party offi-
 cials review and approve disciplinary ac-
 tions taken against party members.
 The reintroduction of the probationary period and
 the interview seems intended to prevent the easy packing
 of the party with members of a particular political per-
 suasion, a tactic the purged leftists are accused of
 having used in 1976.   The leftists recruited many who
 normally might not have survived a screening by higher
 authorities.

 While the new constitution makes admission to the
 party more difficult, it also makes it more difficult to
 discipline party members.   The requirement to obtain the
 approval of higher authorities to discipline party members
 appears to be inconsistent with efforts to tighten party
 discipline.   It should, in fact, improve party stability
 by preventing wholesale traumatic leadership changes at
 local levels that have followed political shifts in Peking
 in the past.   The disciplinary provision may have some
 bearing on the forthcoming rectification campaign, which
 Peking hopes to keep tightly controlled in order to pre-
 vent major disruptions in production and social order.
 In particular, the measure may reassure cadre who fear
 indiscriminate retaliation because of unavoidable past
 association with leftists.
 Organization
 The chief organizational measure introduced by the
 new constitution to improve party discipline at all levels
 is the creation of inspection commissions.   The commis-
 sions will be responsible for "strengthening party mem-
 bers' education or discipline, checking on discipline,
 and struggling against all breaches of discipline."  The
 new commissions may be similar to the control commissions
 that existed prior to the Cultural Revolution.  At that
 time, the control commissions had the authority to re-
 ceive and investigate complaints against party cadre, a
 function which the new inspection commissions may also
 assume.
 The new constitution also calls for the formation
 of "leading party groups" within state and mass organi-
 zations.  Although the function of the groups is not de-
 fined in the constitution, they may serve as party com-
 mittees in organizations where such committees do not
 currently exist.   The groups may be roughly analogous
 to the commissar system in the military, which is intended
 to temper the independent authority of military commanders
 by giving the party another direct line of control over
 military units.
 Formation of the "leading party groups" may also
 presage the re-creation of Central Committee departments
 with functional responsibilities for some government and
 mass organization affairs.   Central Committee departments

 for agriculture and forestry, industry and communication,
 and finance and trade were disbanded during the Cultura
 Revolution and have never been formally reestablished.
 The Other side of the Coin:  Combating Commandism
 and Bureaucra ism
 While the speeches at the Congress and the revisions
 in the constitution clearly emphasize discipline, the
 constitution nevertheless reaffirms Maoist concerns over
 bureaucratic 'work  styles, dictatorial leadership prac-
 tices, and abuse of power at the lower levels.   The con-
 stitution, like all those before it, affirms the principle
 of collective leadership in which all members of party
 committees participate in decisions.   It also retains
 the right of party members to criticize and bypass su-
 periors, although it requires that cadre obey orders even
 though they may disagree with party committee decisions.
 The inspection commissions and "leading party groups"
 attached to government organs, while serving as checks
 from above, should provide disaffected party members with
 additional outlets for their points of view.
 Neither the constitution nor the rhetoric of the
 party congress will change the Chinese or their politics.
 The stresses of modernization are likely to rekindle the
 kind of tension that helped fuel the Cultural Revolution
 11 years ago.   The way in which that tension is controlled
 or relieved will-depend largely on the character of the
 leadership in Peking.   The new constitution seems to pro-
 vide channels through which grievances can be expressed,
 and the new leadership is likely to adhere to the provi-
 sions of the constitution.

 Sino-Soviet Trade:   No Big Deals
 25X1
 25X1
 Overall, the value of Sino-Soviet trade increased
 about 50 percent from 1975 to 1976.   With Chinese im-
 ports totaling $238 million against exports of $178 mil-
 lion, the balance shifted sharply to Moscow'
 higher prices were largely responsible for the in-
 crease.   The real value of trade, that is, the volume
 of goods exchanged measured in constant 1970 US dollars,
 increased only an estimated 15 percent over 1975--a re-
 covery from the 30-percent decline in 1975, but still
 below the levels of 1972-74  (see figure 1).   Average
 prices for selected commodities ran about 90 percent

 higher in 1976 than in 1974, both for Chinese imports
 and exports.  The entire increase in trade volume last
 year, therefore, was probably due to increased Soviet
 deliveries.   The volume of Chinese exports may have de-
 clined because the Tangshan earthquake tied up transpor-
 tation in northeast China in the last half of the year.
