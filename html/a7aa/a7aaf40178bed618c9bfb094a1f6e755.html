 Middle East: Around the Canal                                                1-3
 With much ceremony, Egypt reopened the
 Suez Canal on June 5, after eight years of idle-
 ness, two wars fought on its banks, and an
 intensive year-long effort to clear it of accumu-
 lated war debris. The long-awaited opening,
 intended by President Sadat as a signal of his
 desire for peace, was somewhat overshadowed,
 however, by Israel's sudden announcement that
 it was reducing its forces near the canal. The
 two events came as Sadat concluded a meeting
 in Salzburg with President Ford and as Prime
 Minister Rabin prepared for a similar summit in
 Washington next week.
 Under the terms of the Israeli move,
 announced by Rabin on June 2 and completed
 two days later:
 ? Israel reduced by half the number of
 tanks located within 30 kilometers of the
 Suez Canal.
 ? The Israelis will maintain no artillery
 within 32 kilometers of the canal and will
 position no missiles-except anti-tank mis-
 siles-within 40 kilometers of the UN buffer
 zone.
 ? Israeli troop strength in the limited
 armaments area will be kept below half that
 permitted by the Egyptian-Israeli disengage-
 ment accord.
 The move was primarily a political gesture
 intended to show that Israel was willing to co-
 operate in moves toward a Middle East settle-
 ment. Militarily the steps are of little signifi-
 cance, given the limited force that Israel had
 been maintaining in the area.
 Despite  the political  and  propaganda
 benefits to be gained, Rabin was apparently
 reluctant to agree to the urgings of Defense
 Minister Peres and Foreign Minister Allon that
 the government announce a thinning-out of its
 military forces in the Sinai as a reciprocal ges-
 ture for the canal's reopening. Rabin reportedly
 argued that it was not up to Tel Aviv to come
 up  with  new  proposals  or  gestures.

 Subsequently, he was reported to have urged
 that the announcement be withheld at least
 until the results of the Ford-Sadat meeting were
 in hand, and preferably until after his own meet-
 ing with President Ford.
 His two ministers took the position that
 Israel must make some early gesture to balance
 the propaganda windfall Cairo would reap by
 reopening the canal. They reportedly also main-
 tained that such an announcement could create
 a more congenial climate for Israel in Washing-
 ton and Cairo, where important policy decisions
 may be made over the next several weeks. Since
 the Israeli announcement, Rabin reportedly has
 concluded that it has, in fact, already created a
 "more comfortable" atmosphere for his talks
 with President Ford.
 Egypt's reaction to the Israeli move has
 been highly favorable. President Sadat, while
 Israeli limited-
 armaments area
 still in Salzburg, hailed the action as a step in
 the right direction that indicates Israel "has
 started to reciprocate" in moves toward peace.
 In the first public Egyptian acknowledgement
 that Israel might be permitted to use the canal
 in some way, Sadat said passage of Israeli
 cargoes on ships of other nations will be no
 problem "if the conduct of Israel is like it is
 today." The Egyptians will not permit transit by
 Israeli flag vessels, however, until the conclusion
 of a final peace settlement.
 Although the Israeli move does nothing
 substantive to advance negotiations, it does
 improve the atmosphere for talks and encour-
 ages Sadat to continue his moderate course for a
 time. His meeting with President Ford also
 seems to have raised Sadat's hopes that the US
 will continue its diplomatic efforts. Sadat told
 one American television interviewer that "Presi-
 dent Ford has proved to me that he is with us in
 this peace" and that the peace process-will begin
 to pick up momentum. Some of Sadat's other
 public comments have been more reserved, and
 the usually voluble Cairo media have refrained
 from editorializing on the results of the meeting.
 But Sadat seems at least to be content to wait a
 while longer for the definitive US policy state-
 ment he has been seeking.

 Laos: Redefining US Relations 4'"?
 Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and his
 Pathet Lao deputy, Phoumi Vongvichit, met
 with visiting Assistant Secretary of State Habib
 early this week to discuss the future course of
 Lao-US relations. They broke no new ground.
 Both Lao leaders reaffirmed in positive terms
 the  communist-dominated coalition govern-
 ment's desire to maintain "good" relations with
 the US. They also made a strong pitch for con-
 tinued US assistance, but with the standard
 Pathet Lao caveat that such aid must be uncon-
 ditional  and  given  directly  to  the  Lao
 government.
 In their conversations with Habib, neither
 Souvanna nor Phoumi was willing to come to
 grips with the sharp differences between the US
 position and Lao expectations regarding future
 aid. Despite the reassurances of good will by
 both Lao leaders, this question clearly will re-
 main a fundamental and perhaps insurmount-
 able obstacle  in working out a new modus
 vivendi between Vientiane and Washington.
 Hanoi appears to share this view. A North
 Vietnamese commentary on June 3 stated that
 Habib's Asian trip "cannot reverse the course of
 events in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos."
 In his discussion with Habib, Phoumi es-
 sentially reiterated a line he had taken earlier
 with the US charge and acting USAID director.
 He said that Laos was about to embark on a
 long-range economic development program, and
 that US assistance would be welcome-particu-
 larly during a two-year "healing the wounds of
 war" phase. Phoumi previously talked about
 American aid in terms of war reparations.
 Phoumi obviously prefers Vientiane as a
 negotiating venue because of the proven ability
 of the Pathet Lao to marshal large numbers of
 students and other activists to demonstrate at a
 moment's notice in support of the government's
 bargaining position.
 In any case, before bilateral talks on a new
 assistance agreement can begin, the current
 round of negotiations on the dissolution of AID
 and the turnover of all of its equipment and
 facilities to the Lao government must be con-
 cluded. Both US and Lao officials have agreed
 to June 30 as the cut-off date for these negotia-
 tions, but the talks-which began earlier this
 week-already appear hopelessly bogged down.
 Meanwhile, Souvanna's lack of touch with
 reality and his acquiescence to Pathet Lao view-
 points were evident in his discussion with Habib.
 He repeatedly emphasized that, in his view,
 "nothing had changed" in the Lao-American
 relationship. He blamed "excited young people"
 for the recent "spontaneous" anti-American
 demonstrations in Vientiane, and argued that
 AID-not the US-was the prime target.
 Souvanna also maintained that there had
 been no real change in Laos, merely an "evolu-
 tion of attitudes." He said that in light of the
 "new situation," he had "ordered" the two sides
 to collaborate, "ordered" Phoumi and acting
 Pathet Lao Defense Minister  Khammouane
 Boupha to purge the Royal Lao Army of "unde-
 sirables" and integrate the communist and non-
 communist armies, and "asked" Phoumi to staff
 the coalition administration with civilian offi-
 cials from Sam Neua.
 Phoumi said he would personally supervise
 negotiations on a new assistance agreement,
 which, he hoped, would get under way as soon
 as possible. He also indicated that he did not
 "think" there would be any more "disorders"
 directed against Americans in Vientiane, where-
 for "convenience"-negotiations should be held.
 Souvanna, however, indicated that either Vien-
 tiane or Washington would be acceptable as a
 site for talks.
 The Pathet Lao, according to Souvanna,
 have no intention of taking over Laos-at least
 not for another "five or six years." The Lao
 communists, he insisted, are "reasonable na-
 tionalists"-not dictators-who respected the
 monarchy and who had never formed a separate
 government durin  their long years of isolation
 in Sam Neua.

 Senior Chinese officials are stressing that
 despite the outcome in Indochina, the US is still
 the most important strategic counterweight to
 Soviet power in Asia and Europe. Both Vice
 Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and Foreign Minister
 Chiao Kuan-hua have recently observed that the
 US was overextended in Indochina; it can now
 concentrate on more fundamental commitments
 in Europe and Japan.
 During his trip to France last month, Teng
 stressed the importance of the US-European
 partnership in countering Moscow's strategic
 aims in Europe.
 The Chinese press gave unusually positive
 treatment to the NATO summit and President
 Ford's European trip. Peking's media stressed
 statements that underline the US commitment
 to NATO, the determination of the alliance to
 remain militarily strong and politically cohesive,
 and US assurances that detente with Moscow
 would not detract from US interests elsewhere.
 Prior to the President's trip, the Chinese press
 had focused on recent statements by US leaders
 warning Moscow not to test US resolve in the
 immediate post-Indochina period.
 Although they have concentrated  par-
 ticularly on the US role in Europe, the Chinese
 have also made it clear that they do not expect,
 or desire, Washington's withdrawal from Asia in
 the wake of the Indochina debacle. The French
 received the impression from Teng that China
 was concerned that any further US drawback in
 the region would result in a Soviet advance to
 fill the vacuum. In particular, the French noted
 that Teng passed up opportunities to denounce
 the US military presence in Thailand-and the
 Philippines as well.
 The Chinese seem genuinely concerned
 about the possibility that Moscow will in fact be
 in a position to exploit the post-Vietnam situa-
 tion in Asia; it is this concern that motivates
 Chinese desires that the military balance in the
 region not change rapidly or decisively. Peking's
 anxieties on this score have been fueled recently
 by the continuing deadlock in Sino-Japanese
 negotiations over a peace treaty, a deadlock
 which resulted in part from Soviet pressure on
 Tokyo-and by what the Chinese believe to be
 Moscow's overly close friendship with Hanoi.
 In attempting to secure their northeastern
 flank against putative Soviet machinations, the
 Chinese, in the wake of Kim II-song's visit to
 Peking, have been strongly insisting on the with-
 drawal of US forces from Korea, but they have
 been careful not to set a deadline for it. After
 repeating to the French the standard Chinese
 formulation  on this  issue, Teng Hsiao-ping
 remarked that he expects no change in the
 Korean situation-a tacit acknowledgement that
 China does not foresee early US disengagement
 from the peninsula. Peking has made it clear
 that it does not desire a blowup in the Korean
 situation, and it probably continues to believe
 that US forces provide an element of stability
 there.
 In some respects the Chinese have been
 quite forthright in setting forth their position.
 Within days of the fall of Saigon, Chiao Kuan-
 hua implied to a group of British journalists that
 Peking hopes Washington will play a more active
 role in East Asia as a counter to the Soviets.
 Moreover, a Japan Socialist Party delega-
 tion recently in Peking was "astonished" by
 China's openly benign attitude toward the US.
 The Chinese  reportedly waved aside the
 Japanese party's proposal that the final com-
 munique include a call for reunification of
 Taiwan with the mainland and attacks on the
 US-Japan Mutual Security Treaty and US policy

 in Indochina. The communique did include an
 attack on the issue of US forces in Korea, but
 the embassy in Tokyo reports that the Japanese
 believe the US was mentioned only as a conces-
 sion-apparently in order to get the Socialists to
 agree to anti-Soviet language regarding foreign
 hegemony in Asia.
 The Mayaguez affair provided another clue
 regarding Chinese attitudes with respect to the
 US position in Asia. As in the case of Korea,
 Peking has an obvious interest in keeping rela-
 tions with Phnom Penh warm. Nevertheless, the
 Chinese reaction to the US rescue of the ship
 and crew, despite an unusual reference to the
 US as a "paper tiger," was low-keyed, relatively
 restrained, and almost entirely ex post facto,
 indicating that Peking wished to isolate the
 affair. This suggests that China wants to
 minimize most areas of friction with Washing-
 ton, even  in situations where the use of
 American power tends to conflict with other
 Chinese  interests.

 North Korea
 COURTING THE NONALIGNED
 President Kim .11-song's current tour of
 African and East European capitals is the most
 ambitious diplomatic swing ever made by the
 North Korean leader.
 Kim's trip has had a distinct nonaligned,
 Third World orientation. Since May 22, he has
 been warmly welcomed in Romania, Algeria,
 Mauritania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.  In his
 speeches and  press interviews,  Kim strongly
 emphasized    nonaligned themes-the  inde-
 pendence, sovereignty, and common interests of
 the smaller countries-and he roundly attacked
 the US and UN presence in South Korea.
 On several occasions, Kim repeated the line
 that a war provoked by the US and South Korea
 would result in reunification of Korea under
 communism. He took pains, however, to project
 a moderate image for North Korea, insisting that
 Pyongyang's policy calls for peaceful reunifi-
 cation and that he is prepared to move in
 gradual steps toward that end.
 Kim's immediate objective is to strengthen
 political support for North Korea's participation
 in the nonaligned conference of foreign minis-
 ters in  Lima this summer and for a pro-
 Pyongyang resolution at the UN General Assem-
 bly this fall. In both forums North Korea in-
 tends to press for the removal of US forces and
 the UN command from South Korea.
 In Romania, Kim and Ceausescu signed a
 "treaty of friendship and collaboration" be-
 tween the communist parties of the two coun-
 tries. Both leaders pursue an independent for-
 eign policy and have developed a close personal
 rapport. Algeria and Mauritania provided Kim
 with a good platform for appealing for UN votes
 from Middle Eastern and African states. The
 stop in Yugoslavia is intended to enhance North
 Korea's standing in nonaligned circles. In Bul-
 garia, Moscow's closest ally in Eastern Europe,
 nonaligned themes were muted, but Kim and
 Zhivkov found common ground in "socialist in-
 ternationalism."
 A Soviet Foreign Ministry official told a
 US diplomat on May 27 that Kim will not be
 coming to Moscow "at this time." He said noth-
 ing about a future visit, but a Soviet official in 25X1
 Western Europe has said that planning is under
 way for a visit by the North Korean leader late
 Australia

 The resignation this week of Defense Minis-
 ter Barnard complicates the Labor government's
 already difficult parliamentary position. Bar-
 nard, who had been rankling since he was eased
 out as deputy prime minister a year ago, will
 take an ambassadorial post.
 Barnard's parliamentary seat will be con-
 tested in a by-election on June 28 under cir-
 cumstances unfavorable for Labor. Although his
 constituency is traditionally a Labor district, the
 state party organization is in some disarray, and
 the probable candidate of the opposition Lib-
 erals is a vigorous campaigner who will be a
 formidable threat.
 Loss of Barnard's parliamentary seat would
 reduce Labor's working majority in the House
 of Representatives to only two seats. This, on
 top of the opposition-controlled Senate's block-
 age of 25 pieces of legislation so far this year,
 might force Labor to consider calling national
 elections. This new situation may also encourage
 the opposition, now recovered from the strains
 of a change in leadership nearly three months
 ago, to greater aggressiveness.
 With  public opinion polls showing that
 Labor now trails the Liberal-Country opposition
 by 13 percentage points, the Labor government
 will face a difficult choice between national
 elections under unpromising prospects or con-
 tinued frustration of its legislative program. If it
 is willing to tolerate continued obstruction by
 the Senate, Labor can hold on until November.
 At that time, however, annual consideration of
 government appropriations takes place, and with

 block the government's operating funds, Labor

 PORTUGAL: POLITICAL TENSIONS    2 4,Z 2
 Socialist leaders have agreed to end their
 boycott of cabinet meetings and to resume par-
 ticipation in the four-party coalition govern-
 ment, provided that the dispute with Commu-
 nist printers over the Socialist party newspaper
 is resolved by June 7. The solution is a tempo-
 rary one at best, even if the military meets the
 Socialists' deadline.
 The Socialists managed to back down
 gracefully from their challenge to the Armed
 Forces Movement's political authority after mili-
 tary leaders promised to convince the Commu-
 nist printers to accept the reopening of the
 Socialist  newspaper Republica.  Information
 Minister Jesuino has said the government will
 reopen the newspaper at any time the Socialist
 management requests, but editor Raul Rego has
 hesitated, fearing renewed opposition from the
 printers.
 Press reports indicate that the Socialists are
 pressing the Movement to resolve the problem
 by setting June 7 as the deadline for the reopen-
 ing of the paper. The US embassy believes the
 government is embarrassed by unfavorable re-
 action abroad and is anxious to bring the dis-
 pute to an early end.
 The Movement managed to assuage the So-
 cialists without taking concrete action on their
 other demands-curtailment of Communist in-
 fluence in the trade unions, mass media, and
 local governments. The Movement did state its
 recognition of "disproportions" in the political
 structure and promised to correct them.
 Military leaders also vowed to safeguard
 the activities of the constituent assembly, which
 opened on June 2. The Movement's assurance
 dispelled last-minute fears that the assembly,
 Information Minister Jesuino (1) and Prime Minister Goncalves

 which  is dominated by moderate political
 parties, would not be allowed to meet.
 The Socialists hope to use the assembly as
 a public forum for expounding moderate ideas.
 They should have little trouble dominating it
 since they hold 116 of the 249 seats and their
 candidate has been elected assembly president.
 In contrast, the Communists and their sister
 organization, the Portuguese Democratic Move-
 ment, together hold only 35 seats.
 A substantial portion of the constitution
 that the assembly will draft has already been
 dictated by the Movement and accepted by the
 major parties. The military has made certain it
 will remain the dominant political power for at
 least the next three years. The Socialists, how-
 ever, believe there are several important deci-
 sions left for the assembly and plan to concen-
 trate on the areas of human rights, justice, and
 municipal governments. The assembly will de-
 cide the date of elections for a legislative assem-
 bly and also for new municipal councils.
 There is speculation that moderates might
 attempt to reserve part of the assembly sessions
 for free debate on national problems. If the
 moderates attempt to exceed the strict mandate
 the Movement has given them, the papered-over
 differences between the military and the parties
 will resurface, possibly forcing the Movement to
 renew its threat to do away with the parties.

 ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS ENACTED
 Parliament last week enacted party leader
 Gierek's plans for a massive restructuring of the
 territorial and administrative bureaucracy. Im-
 plementation began on June 1.
 The principal feature of the reorganization
 is the division of 17 provinces into 49 smaller
 units. Prime Minister Jaroszewicz justified these
 changes by saying that the old system had be-
 come outmoded and bogged down in red tape.
 He added that Warsaw wants to bring the gov-
 ernment close to the people and to tailor ad-
 ministration  to  recent  social and economic
 changes.
 The official explanations failed to mention
 that the reforms will also enable Gierek to break
 up some of the powerful provincial fiefdoms
 and to bring the local government and party
 bureaucracies under greater central control than
 at any time since the Communists came to
 power.
 the reforms will affect
 250,000  people, including 110,000 party
 workers. Of the latter, 50,000 are slated for
 retirement. Six provincial party first secretaries
 have already been removed-three of whom re-
 ceived important jobs in Warsaw-and new prov-
 ince governors have been announced. There are
 rumors in Warsaw that the powerful party first
 secretary in Katowice, Zdzislaw Grudzien, will
 move up to the party Secretariat and Politburo.
 Although no organized opposition to the
 reforms has emerged, there is considerable dis-
 satisfaction among officials who stand to lose
 their posts or find their powers reduced. One
 bureaucrat recently told a US diplomat that the
 best officials in the old administrations will re-
 sist being relocated, and that less qualified peo-
 ple will come into many of the new local posi-
 tions. He also said that local facilities were
 inadequate for the new governmental units, and
 that it might take two years before "some
 semblance of order" could be restored.
 Gierek's hopes of creating a more efficient
 bureaucracy will be complicated if reports of
 Deputy Premier Miecz slaw Ja ielski's illness
 prove accurate.                           he
 suffered a serious heart attack in early May, and
 a  Polish journalist says he has  less than a
 50-percent chance for full recovery. Jagielski is
 the Politburo member responsible for national
 economic planning, the ranking deputy premier,
 and chairman of the State Planning Commission.
 His loss would deprive Gierek of one of Poland's
 most experienced and able economic planners
 and managers.

 GREECE-TURKEY: LEADERS MEET
 Prime ministers of Greece and Turkey
 Karamanlis and Demirel
 33; 3S
 The Greek and Turkish prime ministers
 met at the NATO summit in Brussels last week-
 end for their first talks since the Cyprus crisis
 last summer. Nothing concrete was decided
 upon during the three-hour meeting, but the
 atmospherics were favorable, producing some
 improvement in the troubled relations between
 the two countries. Each side publicly declared
 itself pleased with the outcome.
 During the foreign ministers' meetings in
 Rome last week, the Turks appeared to back
 away from referring the Aegean dispute to the
 World Court, but the prime ministers have now
 agreed to this step. In the final communique,
 both sides pledged to resolve their differences
 peacefully through negotiations and to support
 the  Cypriot intercommunal  negotiations in
 Vienna, which resumed on June 5. Some mem-
 bers of the Greek delegation, who had come to
 the Brussels summit genuinely concerned that
 the Turks had war on their minds, were particu-
 larly relieved at the outcome.
 The Turks have been emphasizing that
 Prime Minister Demirel is in too weak a position
 to make concessions because of the fragile
 nature of the coalition he heads. They have been
 insisting that Athens make the first move by
 stating specifically that it will accept a bizonal
 solution in exchange for return of a certain
 percentage of Greek Cypriot territory held by
 the Turks. The Greeks have been unwilling to
 commit themselves until they have a better idea
 of Turkish views on the final shape of a settle-
 ment.
 Other problems between Greece and Tur-
 key are just as complicated as the Cyprus issue
 and, initially at least, will be dealt with sepa-
 rately. Experts from the two countries will meet
 to discuss their differences over control of air-
 space in the Aegean. They will also examine a
 Turkish proposal for joint exploitation of the
 resources of the Aegean and a compromise text
 on the Aegean dispute to be forwarded to the
 World Court. The experts will probably make
 some progress on the airspace dispute, but the

 West European leaders who attended last
 week's NATO summit meeting have generally
 been satisfied. Most were gratified with Presi-
 dent Ford's assurance that the US will continue
 to fulfill all its commitments to NATO. Press
 reaction to the summit has been mixed, but
 many European papers complained that the
 heads of government only discussed problems
 and did not arrive at solutions.
 Positive public comments have been made
 by several leaders. Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Thorn commented that President Ford has
 calmed European fears that US reverses in In-
 dochina would lead to a disengagement from
 Western Europe. Turkish Prime Minister Demirel
 made similar remarks. West German Foreign
 Minister Genscher said the summit was an
 impressive confirmation of the resoluteness of
 the NATO allies. Danish Prime Minister Jor-
 gensen played down the summit as "un-
 dramatic," but said he was satisfied with it
 Portuguese Prime Minister Goncalves used
 the summit and several press conferences to
 stress that Portugal will remain in the alliance
 and is determined to meet its obligations. Re-
 acting to expressions of concern about the
 leftist tendencies of the rulers in Lisbon, Gon-
 calves asked the allies for more "comprehension
 and less apprehension" about Portugal. He also
 stressed several times that Lisbon will not be a
 "Trojan horse" within the alliance. Goncalves,
 treated to a hero's welcome on his return from
 Brussels, said that the Portuguese delegation had
 scored an important victory in a "veritable in-
 formation     e"
 Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis and Turk-
 ish Prime Minister Demirel also commented
 positively on the summit and on the private
 meeting they held to discuss bilateral problems.
 Both men described the latter meeting as useful
 and indicated that their dialogue will continue.
 Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, ac-
 cording to an official in the Department of
 External Affairs, was very pleased with the
 summit and with the results of his private meet-
 ing with  the President. Trudeau, initially
 skeptical to the idea of holding the summit,
 even proposed that such meetings be held more
 frequently.
 French officials have not commented in
 much detail. They probably would prefer not to
 arouse new debate in France over whether Paris
 is moving closer to or divorcing itself further
 from the Alliance. Foreign Minister Sauvag-
 nargues has tried to reassure the public that
 President Ford's comment regarding the need
 for no partial mem ers i s in NATO was not
 directed at France.

 ITALY: REGIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN
 After two full weeks of campaigning for
 the regional and local elections to be held on
 June 15, debate remains focused on the implica-
 tions of the vote for the national political situa-
 tion. All parties view the elections as a crucial
 test, since they will be the first definitive meas-
 ure of popular sentiment since the 1972 parlia-
 mentary race; more than 95 percent of the elec-
 torate will go to the polls to choos- new offi-
 cials in 15 of the 20 regions, 86 of the 94
 provinces, and 6,345 of the 8,000-odd munici-
 palities.
 The Christian Democrats, who have domi-
 nated postwar politics with an average 38-40
 percent of the vote, are struggling to avoid a
 repeat of the sharp losses they suffered to the
 left last year in Sardinia and scattered local
 contests. The Christian Democrats' prospects
 appear to have improved lately, but the party is
 still in danger of dropping to 35 percent or less
 for the first time in the postwar period.
 The campaign is dominated by discussions
 of how power should be distributed in the next
 national government, what the future role of the
 Communist opposition should be, and who is
 best qualified to stop the dramatic increase in
 crime and political violence.
 With the exception of the law and order
 issue, these are essentially the same questions
 that divided the center-left governing parties last
 October and November during Italy's longest
 postwar government crisis. The imminence of
 the elections was the main reason  political
 leaders were reluctant to come to terms then.
 Instead, they set up the Moro government, a
 Christian  Democratic - Republican coalition
 dependent on Socialist and Social Democratic
 parliamentary support, as an interim solution
 that would at least keep the four parties work-
 ing together.
 With so much at stake, the campaign has
 turned into a free-for-all. The center-left parties
 for the most part are running against each other,
 despite the fact that cooperation among them
 remains the only workable alternative to Com-
 munist participation  in the government. Re-
 storing such cooperation after the elections will
 be made more difficult by the harsh exchange
 now taking place between the two key parties-
 the Christian Democrats and the Socialists.
 The Socialists, who generally get around 10
 percent of the vote, have been running on the
 theme that the only way the voters can guaran-
 tee social and economic progress is to give more
 support to them and less to the Christian Demo-
 crats. That, the Socialists argue, would allow
 them to force new policies on the Christian
 Democrats, who have set the terms for every
 Communist leader Berlinguer

 coalition in which the two parties have partici-
 pated since the Socialists joined the government
 in 1963.
 Christian Democratic leader Fanfani coun-
 terattacked this week by criticizing the Social-
 ists for running on joint tickets with the Com-
 munists in several hundred small towns. Fanfani
 pointed to this as evidence that the Socialists are
 trying to prepare the way for Communist entry
 into the national government. For the first time
 he explicitly urged the voters not to support the
 Socialists; Fanfani previously had told his audi-
 ences to vote for at least one of the Christian
 Democrats' potential allies if they could not
 support the Christian Democrats themselves.
 The Socialists, in fact, are walking a tight-
 rope on the Communist issue. Local conditions
 make it difficult for them to avoid allying with
 the Communists in certain areas, but the Social-
 ist campaign stresses that the time is not ripe for
 a deal with the Communists at the national
 level. The Socialists' advertising, for example,
 advises the electorate that a vote for their party
 is a  "vote without compromises"-a thinly
 veiled jab at Communist chief Berlinguer's de-
 sign for an "historic compromise" that would
 eventually bring his party into the government.
 Fanfani,  meanwhile, is highlighting his
 party's leading role in pushing tougher law and
 order measures through parliament last month.
 The Socialists and Communists are trying to
 make the same issue work for them by charging
 that it is the Christian Democrats who are re-
 sponsible for the deteriorating situation, since
 they have controlled the Interior Ministry's law-
 enforcement apparatus for most of the past 30
 years.
 Berlinguer's campaign is built around the
 theme he has stressed since launching the "his-
 toric compromise" proposal in late 1973: that
 Italy's problems cannot be solved until his
 party, the country's second largest, is granted
 more influence. Berlinguer is emphasizing in par-
 ticular the Communists' reputation for efficient
 administration in the three north-central regions
 where they hold the balance of power.
 It is obvious, however, that Berlinguer feels
 vulnerable on foreign policy issues: Fanfani con-
 tinues to cite the Portuguese situation to bolster
 his   arguments against concessions to  Italy's
 Communists. Berlinguer took advantage of an
 interview this week to re-emphasize his claim
 that the Italian Communists are "inspired by a
 different  vision"  than their  counterparts in
 CSCE: SOVIET CONCESSIONS 5- 2, 7 3
 After weeks in which seemingly inevitable
 Soviet concessions were repeatedly deferred, the
 European security conference is moving closer
 to resolution. On May 28, the Soviets offered to
 modify their position on certain humanitarian
 issues, part of the subject matter of so-called
 "Basket III" that had kept the conference stale-
 mated.
 The Soviets moved closer to accepting
 Western texts facilitating international travel
 and restricting the expulsion of journalists en-
 gaged in legitimate professional activity. They
 also agreed to drop a statement on national
 responsibility for international radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts.
 The Soviet moves came in response to a
 Western "global initiative" intended to reduce
 the number of disputed issues to manageable
 proportions and to identify the significant ones.
 The initial Soviet reaction to the Western pro-
 posal had been chilly, but the Soviets suddenly
 changed their tactics when it became clear that
 more stonewalling would probably kill the
 chances for an early windup of the conference.
 The Soviet shift was probably timed to
 influence the NATO summit meeting at Brus-
 sels. NATO members, while anxious to conclude
 the conference, have been put off by the
 Soviet's rigidity on Basket III and are reluctant
 to face public opinion with so little to show for
 their efforts.

 Moscow's concessions have kept alive the
 possibility that the third and final stage of the
 conference can be held this summer. The Soviets
 have not pressed for-and have no chance of
 getting-the June 30 date proposed by General
 Secretary Brezhnev earlier this year, but they
 appear anxious to wrap up the conference be-
 fore the August vacation season in Europe. The
 Finns are prepared to play host to the final stage
 on four weeks' notice.
 Despite the progress last week, significant
 obstacles to a rapid conclusion remain. There
 are still many differences-some minor, some
 substantial-on humanitarian issues. In addition,
 compromises must still be reached on military-
 related "confidence-building measures," such as
 how much advance notice must be given prior to
 military maneuvers, what size of maneuvers
 require advance notification, and what geo-
 graphic area is covered by these provisions.
 If the Soviets follow past practice, they
 will hold out until the last minute on the re-
 maining issues and then make only minimal con-
 cessions. In fact, there is already evidence that
 the Soviet representatives have gone back to
 their tough bargaining tactics. The differences
 could be resolved in time to organize a summit
 session in July, but if this were to happen, the
 scenario would be straight out of "Perils of
 Pauline."

 WESTERN EUROPE: AIRCRA~~ROUBLE
 The West German - British - Italian project
 to develop a European Multirole Combat Air-
 craft (MRCA) is still encountering serious dif-
 ficulties. Although the British claim that widely
 publicized engine problems are being solved, the
 West Germans apparently are deeply concerned
 at the continuing delays.
 Page
 The engine problem may also have influ-
 enced the decision not to show the new fighter-
 bomber at the Paris air show this week. The
 official  explanation  is that  the  appearance
 would take too much time away from prototype
 testing, already several months behind schedule.
 After the first two prototype aircraft flew
 in 1974, all three nations agreed to continue
 development work for 18 months and to make a
 final decision in early 1976 whether to go into
 full production. Because of rising costs, how-
 ever, all three nations have since considered
 either cutting back their purchases or opting out
 of the program.
 w i e,   a   un es ag  as appropriated money       25X1
 for the project, but only if the plane will not
 cost more than $9 million each. Most estimates
 indicate this ceiling will be exceeded, but the
 potential setback to Germany's aircraft industry
 and the amount of money already invested may
 weigh heavily against a decision to abandon the
 project. As for the Italians, Rome has generally
 followed the lead of the other two partners and
 probably will continue to do so.
 Although the project is still shaky, it ap-
 pears to have a better than even chance to
 succeed. If it fails, the UK and Italy, both eco-
 nomically hard pressed, may decide not to buy
 any new aircraft-a move that would seriously
 weaken NATO tactical air capabilities by the
 1980s. The West Germans probably would pur-
 chase some other, less expensive aircraft tailored
 for  s ecific  missions  such as the US    25X1
 F-16.

 SYRIA-IRAQ: WATER DISPUTE ABATES
 Damascus' announcement early this week
 that it would release more Euphrates River
 water to Iraq as a gesture of good will should
 help ease the tension that has developed over
 the past three months between the two coun-
 tries' rival Baath regimes. It will not, however,
 end either Iraqi political intrigue in Syria or
 President Asad's antipathy for the men who rule
 in Baghdad.
 A Syrian government spokesman, portray-
 ing the gesture as a product of the mediation of
 Saudi Oil  Minister Yamani,  indicated that
 Damascus now hopes a permanent agreement on
 sharing the water can be reached. Until the
 announcement, Damascus press and radio had
 kept up a daily propaganda barrage against the
 "fascist Iraqi right." Last week the Asad govern-
 ment closed Iraq's consulate in the commercial
 center of Aleppo, and Baghdad claimed that the
 Syrians had placed a ban on the movement of
 Iraqi goods through the Mediterranean port of
 Latakia.
 More Syrian military units were pulled
 away from the Golan front last week and moved
 toward the Tabaqah Dam on the Euphrates,
 allegedly to discourage Iraqi military adventures.
 By last weekend, two armored divisions, half of
 Syria's SA-6 missile defense system, and some
 MIG-21s and 23s had been reoriented from the
 south-near Damascus-toward the northeastern
 part of the country.
 Iraq will be relieved if the Syrians do re-
 lease significant quantities of water; the cutback
 had threatened the livelihood of thousands of
 Iraqi farmers. Baghdad had reacted with re-
 straint to Syrian harassment and propaganda
 charges, apparently believing that Asad would
 drop his campaign against Iraq once it had
 served his purposes.
 It is not clear why Syria decided to open
 the sluices at the dam. Asad may have con-
 cluded he had amply demonstrated that Syria
 can exert severe economic pressure on Baghdad
 any time the Iraqis try to meddle in Syrian
 internal affairs.

 SPAIN: SAHARAN INITIATIVE  Cl'
 Madrid's announcement on May 23 that it
 is prepared to speed up the transfer of sover-
 eignty over Spanish Sahara if the process of
 self-determination in the territory is delayed
 introduces flexibility into its policy. Only three
 weeks  earlier,  Foreign  Minister Cortina had
 stated publicly that the only solution to the
 problem of Spanish Sahara was a UN-supervised
 referendum to let the people there determine
 their political future. The new approach, with
 its reference to Madrid's wish to take into ac-
 count the legitimate aspirations of "interested
 countries" in the Sahara, appears to signal a
 willingness to negotiate. Preliminary contacts
 may already be under way.
 The government statement aroused the
 concern of Morocco and Mauritania by noting
 the possibility of a unilateral Spanish with-
 drawal if the situation in the territory deteri-
 orates. The announcement was expressed in
 terms which make it unlikely, however, that
 Madrid contemplates immediate withdrawal. In
 a letter to the UN Secretary General, the For-
 eign Ministry stated that:
 ? Spain wishes to end its presence with-
 out creating a vacuum;

 ? All parties to the process should be
 invited to work for a smooth transition
 under the auspices of a UN-sponsored con-
 ference, but if this fails Madrid will set a
 deadline for withdrawal;
 ? Spain requests the UN to dispatch
 observers to follow developments in the
 Sahara; and
 ? Madrid reserves the right to report to
 the Security Council if peace is threatened.
 Several developments probably contributed
 to Madrid's abrupt shift away from insistence on
 a referendum, which it was convinced would
 result in a vote for an "independent" state that
 Spain could continue to control. Recently there
 has been growing concern in Madrid about its
 ability to handle the situation. A militant anti-
 Spanish  organization has emerged  as the
 dominant  political force in the territory,
 insurgent attacks on Spanish forces have oc-
 curred recently, and the  civil population and
 even the Saharan armed forces and police have
 shown a lack of sympathy for Spain.
 the military, mindful of the
 Portuguese experience, wishes to avoid  a
 colonial war at a time when the country faces
 domestic problems such as Basque terrorism and
 the uncertainties of the coming post-Franco era.
 These developments apparently enabled Prime
 Minister Arias and officials in charge of the
 Sahara to prevail over the foreign minister. Arias
 reportedly favors a negotiated settlement that
 would  take  into account Moroccan  King
 Hassan's determination to annex the Sahara.
 Moroccan and Algerian Positions
 Morocco last week expressed surprise at
 the Spanish  statement, accused  Madrid of
 creating a "climate of confusion," and con-
 cluded with a veiled warninq that Rabat would
 use force if necessary to uphold its claim to
 Spanish  Sahara. The  Moroccans have also
 charged that Spain is trying to bypass considera-
 tion of the dispute by the International Court of
 Justice and to undercut the mission of a UN
 investigating team now in Mauritania on the
 final leg of its visit to the area.
 The Moroccans fear Spain may grant the
 territory independence before a political settle-
 ment acceptable to Rabat can be negotiated,
 and they suspect collusion between Madrid and
 Algiers to block Moroccan annexation of the
 territory. Algeria's open support of a pro-
 independence party in the Sahara has further
 antagonized Moroccan officials. As a result,
 King Hassan has intensified diplomatic efforts in
 Madrid and Algiers to head off rapid moves
 toward independence lest he is forced to take a
 stand that might lead to a confrontation with
 Algeria.
 Mauritania welcomed Madrid's willingness
 to hasten the decolonization process, provided it
 is carried out in close consultation with the
 interested parties. In a recent interview, Presi-
 dent Moktar Ould Daddah chided Spain for
 threatening to hand over sovereignty of the
 region to an entity unilaterally chosen by
 Madrid. Ould Daddah asserted that Spain has a
 moral obligation to maintain political stability
 in the territory and should remain until the ICJ
 has rendered a decision.
 Mauritania seeks a partitioning of Spanish
 Sahara and claims to have reached agreement
 with Morocco. It accepts Algeria as an interested
 party but places it in a special category because
 Algiers has made no territorial claims. Although
 lacking the military and  political  clout of
 neighboring states, Mauritania can be expected
 to step up its diplomatic campaign in pursuit of

 FTAI: PRESSURES FOR CHANGE
 The somnolence that has long enveloped
 the French Territory of Afars and Issas-one of
 the last colonial remnants in Africa-has been
 disturbed in recent weeks by internal and ex-
 ternal developments.
 Many members of the Afar tribe, which
 composes about half the total population and
 dominates the local scene, are demanding im-
 provements in economic conditions and the in-
 clusion of younger, better educated Afars in
 politics and administration. Much of their crit-
 icism is directed at the French-installed regime
 headed by Afar leader Ali Aref, who is president
 of the territorial council. Popuiar pressure for
 the removal of Aref and his conservative, tradi-
 tional Afar advisers is mounting.
 The regime's opponents do not yet form a
 united front, and most are probably undecided
 about long-range goals. Some would be satisfied
 with  increased economic benefits within a
 French administration, while others want in-
 dependence. The leaders of the predominantly
 Afar African Peoples Independence League re-
 cently visited Paris to press for independence.
 The league will seek recognition by the UN
 Decolonization Committee, and the leader of
 the league is seeking Arab support.
 French officials note that they may even
 have to reckon with All Aref, once considered
 their pawn. The French are worried that, in an
 attempt to steal his opponents' thunder, Aref
 may make a sudden call for independence in the
 local assembly, where he controls the vote.
 Last week, bloody clashes between Afar
 and Issa tribesmen erupted. Sixteen persons
 were killed and some 250 injured, including 12
 French gendarmes, in several days of rioting.
 Some opponents of French rule probably tried
 to keep the riots going as a means of gaining
 publicity and embarrassing France.
 The French are also feeling heat from
 Somalia, which claims the territory on the basis
 of ethnic ties to the Issas. In recent months,
 President Siad has increased his polemics against
 the French presence and has received a sympa-
 thetic hearing in Arab and African circles. In
 April, the Arab League Council passed a resolu-
 tion urging independence for the territory and
 formed a ministerial committee to make con-
 tacts with France. The Organization of African
 Unity has voiced support for the territory's lib-
 eration, and African leaders are expected to
 reiterate their call for independence at the OAU
 summit in July.
 Ethiopia has played down its claims, recog-
 nizing that French withdrawal might make the
 territory a battleground between Addis Ababa
 and Mogadiscio. The Ethiopians are satisfied at
 present with the arrangement allowing them to
 use the port of Djibouti, the terminus of Ethio-
 pia's only railroad.
 The beginning on June 1 of what may be a
 full-scale revolt by Afar tribesmen in Ethiopia
 against the ruling military council in Addis
 Ababa poses a new threat to stability in the
 French territory. Sultan Ali Mirah, leader of all
 the Afars and All Aref's tribal overlord, has left
 his capital in Ethiopia and taken refuge tempo-
 rarily in the territory. The French almost cer-
 tainly will not allow him to use the territory as a
 sanctuary or as a base for dissident activity
 against the Ethiopian government, but France
 could face problems with its Afar if it tries to
 prevent them from aiding their tribal brothers in
 Ethiopia.

 ANGOLA: CONFLICT SPREADING   ! 10
 Forces of the Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola clashed during the week
 with troops of the National  Front for the
 Liberation of Angola. The clashes occurred in a
 number of towns north and east of Luanda,
 where both groups have been rapidly building
 up their military forces, and in the exclave of
 Cabinda. It was the third round of major fight-
 ing in two months between the two principal
 nationalist groups in Angola's transitional gov-
 ernment and the first outside Luanda, the
 capital.
 The clashes in Angola proper apparently
 resulted from a coordinated offensive by the
 Popular Movement aimed at driving the National
 Front out of areas where the Movement's ethnic
 support predominates and at disrupting the
 Front's supply routes from northern Angola
 into Luanda. The Front is setting up a major
 base in northwestern Angola in an area where it
 has strong tribal support. The base is to replace
 the extensive training and support facilities long
 maintained by the Front in neighboring Zaire.
 The fighting in Cabinda was apparently
 restricted to the capital of the exclave, which is
 administered  as a province of Angola. The
 operations of Gulf Oil, which produced 150,000
 barrels a day from Cabinda last year, were
 apparently not affected. The company has
 evacuated dependents and support personnel.
 At present, the Front continues to rely
 heavily on Zairian President Mobutu; he has
 long supported the Front but recently has had
 Page
 to cut back because of his government's pressing
 financial difficulties. China also provides im-
 portant assistance, but not enough to meet the
 Front's goal of training and equipping a force of
 at least 10,000 troops. The Front reportedly is
 trying to improve its military capabilities by
 recruiting former Portuguese army officers in
 Angola who have been purged by the Armed
 Forces Movement because of "political unrelia-
 bility."
 The Popular Movement, which last winter
 appeared militarily weaker than the Front, ap-
 pears to have scored significant gains in the
 latest fighting, as it did in the clashes that oc-
 curred in Luanda in late April. It is now well
 supplied with arms by the Soviet Union, its
 principal foreign patron. In Luanda, large num-
 bers of well-armed civilians can be mobilized to
 support the Movement's regular forces; in the
 countryside, its troops seem better armed and
 more experienced than those of the National
 Front. The Front has not been intimidated by
 its recent setbacks, however; it is trying to even
 the score in areas where it has strong tribal
 support.
 In the political arena, both groups have
 been courting the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola, the smallest of the
 three liberation groups in the transitional gov-
 ernment. Union president Jonas Savimbi has
 refused to be drawn into the conflict, seeking
 instead to convene a meeting with the leaders of
 the two groups to discuss their political differ-
 ences. So far he has not succeeded.
 Clearly, neither Holden Roberto nor Pop-
 ular Movement leader Agostinho Neto is willing
 to share political power. Any compromise they
 might agree to in the near future is likely to be
 only for the purpose of buying time in prepara-
 tion for a final showdown. The 24,000 Portu-
 guese troops-most of whom are stationed in
 and around Luanda-are spread thin in the coun-  25X1
 tryside and may not be able or willing to inter-
 vene between the two grouDs in the event the
 fighting continues to spread.

 LEBANON: STILL NO GOVERNMENT  qq
 Lebanon's cabinet crisis shows no sign of
 ending soon. Prime Minister - designate Rashid
 Karami claims to have made some progress to-
 ward assembling a cabinet acceptable to the
 country's many political and religious blocs, but
 he has been unable to convince leftists to drop
 their demand that the right-wing Phalangists be
 excluded from any new government.
 Kamal Jumblatt, head of the Progressive
 Socialist Party, is promoting what he calls a
 compromise under which representatives of his
 party and of the Phalanges Party would stay out
 of the government. The new cabinet, he main-
 tains, should be composed of civilians who are
 not members of parliament and of retired mili-
 tary officers. Phalangist leader Pierre Jumayyil
 has rejected this suggestion. He is supported by
 former president Camille Shamun, who has de-
 clared that his National Liberal Party will not
 join any government from which the Phalangists
 have been excluded.
 Under  ordinary circumstances,  Karami
 would be tempted to endorse Jumblatt's pro-
 posal, since it would create a weak cabinet that
 Karami could easily dominate. As a result of the
 continuing civil unrest, however, he almost cer-
 tainly will continue to seek a solution that can
 win the active backing of Jumayyil and Shamun;
 Looking for snipers
 .4Lf .t
 it was their withdrawal of support that forced
 former primer minister Rashid Sulh to resign
 last month. Karami's strategy at present is to
 delay forming a government in the hope that, in
 time, tempers will cool and both sides will be
 willing to compromise.
 Karami is working closely with the care-
 taker military cabinet to create buffer zones in
 Beirut between those areas controlled by the
 Phalangists and those controlled by the radical
 fedayeen. Sporadic shooting continued in the
 city this week, despite somewhat more aggres-
 sive patrolling by joint Lebanese-Palestinian
 security units. Approximately 130 persons have
 been killed since the latest round of fighting
 began on May 20.
 Economic activity in Lebanon has fallen
 off significantly as a result of the fighting this
 year; the gross national product for 1975 will
 probably be about 2 percent less than antici-
 pated. The economy has not suffered irreparable
 damage, however, and will rebound strongly, as
 it did after the extended closure of the Leba-
 nese-Syrian border in 1973.

 PANAMA: GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN    7 v - Li  j
 The Torrijos government has placed tough
 restrictions on the media in an effort to stifle
 domestic criticism during what it considers a
 crucial period in the canal treaty negotiations
 with the US. The crackdown is evidence of the
 government's concern over the impact of recent
 criticism  by business organizations, student
 groups, and the media, and its fear that any sign
 of disunity at home may be exploited by domes-
 tic and foreign opponents of a new canal treaty.
 It also reflects the administration's growing
 tendency to adopt a "for us or against us"
 attitude.
 The new restrictions were imposed on
 radio and television stations, which previously
 have been under less direct control than the
 press. The stations were instructed not to com-
 ment, without prior consultation with the
 authorities, on "sensitive" subjects, including
 the treaty negotiations, student affairs, public
 services, or the restrictions themselves. The fol-
 lowing day, a "clarification" indicated that the
 restrictions were intended only to caution the
 stations rather than to order them to comply,
 but the message remained the same.
 For  several  years, the Torrijos govern-
 ment's prohibition of political activity has en-
 abled it to act with little fear of criticism by
 organized groups. During the past month, how-
 ever, members of the business community who
 have always been opposed to Torrijos have ag-
 gressively attacked the government's economic
 policies.
 Criticism by ultranationalist students is
 even more worrisome for the administration,
 which has always considered Panama's youth
 among  its  staunchest allies. Antigovernment
 students represent only a small minority of the
 student population, but they have made effec-
 tive use of demonstrations and radiobroadcasts
 to attack the government for the nation's educa-
 tional shortcomings and for its handling of the
 treaty negotiations.
 The government, not wanting to use open
 repression against the radicals, apparently has
 decided to rely on pro-Torrijos students to si-
 lence the criticism. Recently, a group of high
 school students briefly took over an offending
 radio station, charging that it was a mouthpiece
 of "reactionary" businessmen and the CIA. The
 government's next step may be to turn its stu-
 dent allies loose on the radical youth groups.
 Also, government spokesmen will probably step
 up the campaign against the opposition, portray- 25X1
 ing the government's critics as servants of for-
 eign interests who want to sabotage the negotia-

 REGIONALISM RISES IN LATIN AMERICA
 Latin  leaders who are encouraging new
 forms of area cooperation are taking pains to
 sustain the momentum of the regionalist spirit
 as well as to keep pressure on the developed
 world.
 Ten countries now appear ready to put
 their money behind a shipping fleet venture that
 has been under discussion for only a few
 months. Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Pan-
 ama, Jamaica, Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela
 have already signed the pact to establish the
 Multinational Caribbean  Fleet.  Guyana and
 Trinidad and Tobago are also expected to be
 charter members. Each will contribute equally
 to an initial $30 million fund, and new members
 will be assessed a like amount. This system of
 equal shares, rather than some proportional as-
 sessment based on relative wealth, may have
 won over Trinidad, which had been leery of
 domination by the big countries. The other Cen-
 tral American and Caribbean governments are
 yet to be convinced that the venture can be a
 success.
 The act creating the shipping enterprise
 empowers it to commission and operate all
 types of merchant ships, to construct or acquire
 shipyards and related facilities, and to buy or
 charter ships and appropriate material. The first
 move evidently will be to rent five freighters,
 which the consortium would like to see begin
 operating by the end of the year. If this is

 successful, the group will consider moving into
 passenger lines and oil transport.
 Venezuela and Mexico appear ready to
 move forward also on their other all-Latin and
 Caribbean scheme, the Latin American Eco-
 nomic System. This system so far has little defi-
 nition beyond its outline as a vehiicletoencour-
 age                  regional cooperation on a variety of eco-
 nomic and development questions, but like the
 proposed multinational fleet, it seems likely to
 take some shape fairly rapidly, at least as a
 paper organization.
 On the pressure side, there are signs that
 some governments may be contriving a joint
 declaration condemning illegal activities of mul-
 tinational corporations. Several Latin govern-
 ments  have  recently  been  embarrassed                   by
 bribery scandals involving official payoffs by
 large US-based firms. Peru has reportedly asked
 for an OAS Permanent Council discussion on
 this subject and may already have the backing of
 Bolivia, Ecuador,  Venezuela, and  Honduras.
 Earlier this  year,  Venezuela  and  Ecuador
 secured Latin support for similar OAS denuncia-

 ARGENTINA: NEW ECONOMY MINISTER
 By engineering the replacement of highly
 respected economy minister Gomez Morales,
 presidential adviser Lopez Rega has given an-
 other indication of his power-but the move has
 dimmed the country's economic prospects.
 Early this week Celestino Rodrigo, for-
 merly an official in the Social Welfare Ministry,
 supplanted Gomez Morales in the top economic
 post. Rodrigo's transfer extends the influence of
 Lopez Rega, who is minister of social welfare, as
 well as presidential adviser. Lopez Rega has fa-
 vored accommodating the demands of organized
 labor through wage increases and extensive wel-
 fare spending. Gomez Morales lost out because
 he advocated restraint and austerity in the face
 of mounting inflation.
 The replacement of Gomez Morales by a
 lackluster successor is certain to hamper Argen-
 tina's  efforts  to  secure  financial  assistance
 abroad. Although Rodrigo has made a bland call
 for decreased spending and increased productiv-
 ity, it is clear that he has no particular economic
 program of his own. His primary function will
 be to carry out Lopez Rega's instructions.
 The  latest  move  not  only  emphasizes
 Lopez Rega's growing power-he also arranged
 recent changes in the army's command struc-
 ture-but points up the government's desire to
 maintain its populist image as the administration
 assumes an increasingly authoritarian posture.
 For similar reasons, Lopez Rega this week re-
 sponded for the first time to growing popular
 revulsion over the activities of a right-wing coun-
 terterrorist group by announcing that the organ-
 ization would be investigated. The announce-
 ment may be no more than a calculated gesture,
 however, since the group is widely thought to
 have at least tacit approval of the government.
 There is considerable speculation in Buenos
 Aires that more cabinet changes are imminent.
 Indeed, the success Lopez Rega has had to date
 may encourage him to press the extension of his
 influence to the maximum permitted by the
 nation's  final  political  arbiter-the  military.
 Thus far the officers do not appear disposed to
 rein in the ambitious minister, despite wiriP-
