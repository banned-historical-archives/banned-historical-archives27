 Italy's Christian Democratic Party is about
 to begin an internal debate that could determine
 whether the party can maintain its position as
 Italy's dominant political force.
 The Christian Democratic national council
 meeting tomorrow will discuss how to halt the
 erosion of the party's strength that was revealed
 by the outcome of the regional, provincial, and
 municipal elections last month.  The Com-
 munists came close to outpolling the Christian
 Democrats for the first time. Sentiment in the
 120-member council has been building against
 party leader Fanfani, and a move to revise his
 conservative political line is likely. Fanfani says
 he will not give up his job unless he is voted out
 by the council. There are signs that more than a
 majority of the council members are inclined to
 do just that.
 Prime Minister Moro is one key Christian
 Democrat who has yet to break publicly with
 Fanfani. Moro is still the party's most pres-
 tigious left-of-center leader, and his alliance with
 Fanfani h'lped  protect  the latter  from the
 attacks of the left wing as the Christian Demo-
 crats suffered successive defeats during the last
 two years. Moro will probably soon withdraw
 his support and that would ensure Fanfini's
 departure.
 The Socialist Party, meanwhile, is follow-
 ing a line at the regional and local levels that
 differs only in phrasing from Communist chief
 B erlinguer's  "historic  compromise"  concept.
 B-:rlinguer has argued since late 1973 that the
 solution  to   the  country's  problems lies in
 cooperation    among the "popular and demo-
 cratic" forces, mainly Communists, Socialists,
 and Christian Democrats. The Socialists are now
 calling for "open governments" at tl.e regional
 and local levels, in which all parties except the
 neo-fascists are invited to participate.
 The invitation, however, seems mainly to
 be a way of justifying the Socialists' apparent
 preference for alliances with the Communists at
 the local level. The moderate gains made by the
 Socialists in the elections gage them the option
 of  linking up with  the Communists or the
 I!ti~,~1''r
 Christian Democrats in many areas. In one such
 area, the northeastern region of Liguria, the
 Socialists chose last week to join a Communist-
 led government rather than a center-left coali-
 tion with the Christian Democrats.
 The Socialists' preference for a government
 with the Communists in the larger and more
 industrialized region of Piedmont, however, is
 more  likely  to  provoke  trouble  than  the

 Ligurian arrangement. Unlike Liguria, the two
 parties do not quite have a majority in
 Piedmont. The Socialists are inclined to set up a
 minority government with the Communists in
 Piedmont, despite the fact that a center-left
 coalition with the Christian Democrats would
 have a comfortable majority. Two members of
 the  Moro cabinet, whose home base is
 Piedmont, are threatening to bring down the
 government by resigning if the Socialists
 abandon the center-left formula in that region.
 In their post-elaction policies, the Com-
 munists are sticking to the moderate line they
 emphasized in the campaign. Communist labor
 leaders, for example, were mainly responsible
 for the decision last week by Italy's top labor
 federation to seek maximum employment rather
 than excessive wage demands in major contract
 negotiations this fall. The federation's strategy
 should encourage calmer and less protracted
 bargaining in the fall,  unless some of the
 militant constituent unions refuse to go along.
 Deputy Prime Minister La Malfa, a frequent
 critic of labor's policies, praised the Communist-
 sponsored proposals as eminently sensible.
 CSCE: NEARING AGREEMENT
 Participants at the European security con-
 ference agreed on Monday to accept July 30 as
 the opening date for a three-day summit in
 Helsinki, provided that differences on all out-
 standing issues are resolved by July 18. Nego-
 tiators have been working furiously in Geneva
 throughout the week to reach agreement on
 more than a dozen issues, including military-
 related  confidence-building measures.  Final
 acceptance of the July 30 date is expected this
 weekend.
 On July 14, NATO members and the
 Warsaw Pact states bowed to Malta's demand
 that the final conference document include a
 call for the eventual reduction of armed forces
 in the Mediterranean region. Prime Minister
 Mintoff of Malta, after dropping an earlier
 demand for a phased withdrawal of thu US and
 Soviet fleets from the Mediterranean, forced
 acceptance of a Mediterranean declaration by
 refusing-for four days-to agree or. a summit
 date.
 Agreement was also reached during the
 week on several major issues, including follow-
 on procedures for the confereni::a, principles
 governing relations among states, ?ind a clause
 protecting Allied rights in Germans' and Berlin.
 Little progress was made, however, in meeting
 Turkey's demands for a clause exempting it
 from certain aspects of militeeYy-related con-
 fidence-building measures.
 Agreement had not been reached by mid-
 week on more than a dozen other less weighty
 issues,  including the order of speakers  at
 Helsinki, trade reciprocity, and a clause extend-
 ing the benefits of CSCE throughout Europe-
 especially to Berlin. The EC it also insisting that
 Italian Premier Moro be allowod to sign the final
 act twice-acting on behalf of the EC as well as
 Italy.
 The Turkish demands are the only major
 stumbling block to a final agreement. Influenced
 by strong demarches from several NATO states,
 Ankara is now showing more flexibility and has
 muted its ca,! for Turkish Cypriot representa-
 tion at Helsinki. On confidence-building meas-
 ures, Ankara appears willing to give advance
 notification of manuevers within a 250-kilo-
 meter zone along its borders if the conferees will
 make concessions on separate notification of
 amphibious and airborne troop movements. This
 compromise would include language stating that
 notification need not be given n areas adjacent
 to borders with non-participating states-thus
 exempting manuevers in eastern and southern
 Turkey.
 In Helsinki, meanwhile, preparations for
 the summit are proceeding at a hectic pace. The
 Finns are expecting 900 delegates, accompanied
 by thousands of support personne;, to attend
 the 35, nation summit and have begun elaborate

 PORTUGAL: POLITICAL CRISIS MOUNTS
 A crisis atmosphere continued in Lisbon
 this week as the Revolutionary Council was con-
 fronted with the need to form a new cabinet
 and with a rising storm of protest over its efforts
 to bypass the political parties. The resolution of
 these questions may be largely determined by
 the outcome of a power struggle now reportedly
 taking place among its leading members.
 The cabinet ci isis was precipitated when
 the Socialist Party pulled out of the coalition
 government last week because of the seizure of
 the newspaper R spublica. The Socialists were
 followed by the center-left Popular Democratic
 Party on July 16 when the Armed Forces Move-
 ment failed to meet the party's demands for a
 free press, a pledge not to dissolve thc popularly
 elected constituent assembly, and a promise of
 prompt municipal and trade unior elections.
 The Popular Democrats also demanded an end
 to the present divisions within the Movement
 leadership and the urgent adoption of measures
 to deal with the rapidly deteriorating economic
 situation.
 The withdrawal of the Popular Democrats
 has effectively dissolved the coalition and paves
 the way for the formation of a new government.
 Prime Minister Goncalves has been charged with
 naming a new cabinet, and a Movement spokes-
 man has said it will not be composed exclusively
 of military officers. There is speculation that
 non-party civilian technical experts will join the
 military in the new body.
 Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Council is
 being subjected to increasing pressure from all
 sides. At a large demonstration in Aviero last
 weekend, Catholics demanded the return of the
 church radio, which is occupied by pro-com-
 munist workers. In Rio Maior, just north of
 Lisbon, local offices of the Communist, and a
 fellow-traveling party, were sacked and burned
 by local farmers. On July 16, a pro-communist
 demonstration-one of several held this week-
 was joined by soldiers from a leftist military
 unit.
 Page
 The firm stand taken by the non-com-
 munist parties against the proposed formation
 of popular councils hes been reinforced by
 sizable demonstrations by the Socialist Party,
 which is openly moving toward direct opposi-
 tion to the Armed Forces Movement. The
 Socialists have publicly denounced  security
 chief Otelo de Carvalho over his role in the
 Republica affair and are demanding Goncalves'
 resignation. Party leader Mario Soares has also
 denounced the popular councils concept as a
 tactic by the military to establish a communist
 dictatorship and has threatened a "symbolic
 paralysis" of the country if the voice of the
 parties is not heeded.
 There are increasing signs that these and
 other vital  issues-notably the threatening
 economic collapse, the resumption of fighting in
 Angola, and the growing impatience of the
 Portuguese people and even members of the
 Movement itself-may at last bring to a head the
 disagreements and divisions among principal
 members of the Revolutionary Council.P
 25X1
 In its public statements the Movement has
 already begun to temporize on its plans to
 bypass the parties. It has suggested that the
 proposals on the popular councils do not con-
 stitute an immutable law and, in any case, are to
 be established  over a long  period.  If the
 moderates' move to oust Goncalves should fail,
 however, another lurch to the left appears
 likely. Already apprehensive., militant Socialists
 have requested arms and other assistance from
 the US to offset the strength of the Communist
 militia and other armed radical groups. Should
 the  Revolutionary Council  not succeed  in
 re-establishing its authority soon, it is possible
 the situation could deteriorate into armed con-
 flict. F_                     I     25X1

 USSR-US: CRITICISM OF SCHLESINGER
 The Soviet media have reacted sharply to
 Defense Secretary Schlesinger's recent remarks
 on   US  nuclear employment policy, con-
 centrating on the political rather than the mili-
 tary significance of his statements.
 The most definitive response appeared in
 Pravda on July 12  under the authoritative
 "Observer" by-line. The article condemned the
 Secretary's  comments as  "bellicose state-
 ments...in sharp contradiction" to US-Soviet
 security negotiations and to detente in general.
 It said he was reverting to the "bankrupt"
 strategies of the Cold War and flouting the
 intent of the bilateral agreement on prevention
 of nuclear war by raising the possibility that
 nuclear weapons would be used in any crisis
 situation. These points recall  similar Soviet
 criticism of the Secretary since early 1974 for
 his comments on US targeting doctrine.
 Soviet commentators have attempted to
 explain the recent statements in terms of an
 internal debate in  he US over foreign policy
 following the withdh?awal from Southeast Asia.
 The Pravda article accused the Secretary of
 being a spokesman for those hewing to the
 "militarist dogmas of the past." It and other
 Soviet commentaries have said that his remarks
 were part of a Pentagon effort to win approval
 for the US military budget.
 The media have drawn liberally from US
 critics of Schlesinger's comments in an effort to
 show that they are counter to the mainstream of
 US opinion. Nevertheless, the Soviets betrayed
 some concern over the implications of his state-
 ments foi~ administration policy. Noting that the
 Secretary is a prominent member of the US
 government, one commentator asked why this
 moment was chosen for a discussion which
 "certainly doesn't facilitate the course Wash-
 ington professes to follow."
 correspondent mildly observed that the best
 reply to opponents of detente is "concrete
 deeds" to improve international understanding.
 Moscow's support for a successful CSCE summit
 and its campaign to play up the prospect of
 moving from political to military detente sug-
 gest a continuing desire to pursue better rela-
 tions with the US.                        25X1
 USSR-FRANCE: CHILL IN RELATIONS
 The most recent manifestation of a "chill"
 in French-Soviet relations is the vitriolic attack
 by the Soviet news agency, Tass, on French
 Minister of the Interior Poniatowski earlier this
 month.  Poniatowski was condemned  for
 asserting that the  "Ponomarev document"
 recently published in a French newspaper was
 not a fraud, as claimed by the French Com-
 munist Party, but a Soviet guideline tor seizure
 of power by communist parties.
 Moscow  could  hardly  have ignored
 Poniatowski's remarks, in view of strong Soviet
 protestations that the document was a forgery
 trumped up by the Portuguese Socialists to
 discredit the Soviets and the Portuguese Com-
 munists. The French nevertheless assume that
 the Soviet attack on Giscard's closest political
 associate was also a thinly veiled i nal to the
 French president on other isc.!as

 The
 Soviets fear that an agreement on Pluton could
 enhance the prospects for an   independent
 European defense, which  Moscow strongly
 opposes. Moscow may have viewed its blast at
 Poniatowski as an opportunity to weigh in with
 Giscard prior to the French - West German
 summit meeting at the end of this mcnth.
 Paris and Bonn continue to deny that there
 are plans for stationing  Plutons in West
 Germany,  although  the French  and West
 German military planners are probably making
 contingency plans to use the Pluton in the event
 of hostilities.
 Giscard has already shown he is aware of
 Soviet concerns in this area. Last May, he
 sympathized  with  Soviet  fears  of an
 independent European defense arrangement and
 suggested the problem not be addressed until
 more political unification has been achieved. His
 statement was widely criticized in France as a
 concession to the Soviets.
 French-Soviet relations have suffered
 other, more minor irritants in the  ast two
 months.                                the
 irritants include Giscard's termination of V-E
 Day celebrations in  France and his visit to
 Poland in mid-June. The Soviets were dlso
 annoyed by the several strong attacks on the
 USSR made by Chinese Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-Ping during his visit to Paris in mid-May.
 1'rarda took French Prime Minister Chirac to
 task for expressing satisfaction with the visit.

 EASTERN EUROPE: FLOODS AND HARVEST
 Early tl'?is month, heavy rains and flooding
 hit Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia at the start
 of the harvest season, causing major losses of
 grains and other crops. By contrast, the grain
 crop in East Germany is in trouble because of
 severe drought.
 Eastern Europe had been headed for an
 excellent harvest. In mid-June, grain output,
 including that of Yugoslavia, was forecast at
 about 95 million tons, almost 6 percent greater
 than in 1974. Based on early weather damage
 reports, grain losses of roughly 9 million tons
 are now likely. Losses may run higher if the
 riskig Danube causes more flooding in Romania.
 Flood waters have receded in Czechoslo-
 vakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. So far, the
 number of fatalities is unknown; Romania
 reported  that 60 persons died. Although
 thousands of persons were evacuated in rural
 areas, major urban centers reportedly sustained
 little damage, and the floods caused only minor
 disruption to industry.
 Romania Hardest Hit
 According to the minister of agriculture
 total grain !oss is expected to reach about 1.5
 million tons--equal to more than 10 percent of
 last year's harvest. In addition, significant losses
 of sugar beets, potatoes, vegetables, fruit, and
 livestock have occurred.
 Romania has appealed for emergency US
 disaster relief. At least 200,000 tons of feed
 grain is needed, much of which Bucharest hopes
 to receive as an outright grant. Requests for
 construction and industrial raw materials also
 were made, although the need for them is less
 acute. In the longer term, Bucharest wants low-
 interest credits to finance necessary imports and
 to expand exports. As in 1970, Bucharest may
 be exaggerating its claims of destruction in
 hopes of getting as much assistance as possible.
 Page
 Requests also have been made to world
 food agencies. Bucharest, in fact, appears to be
 looking mainly to the West-and not to its East
 European allies-to supply the bulk of materials
 needed for recovery.
 I n addition to the US. Romania  has
 approached West Germany, France, the UK,
 Italy and Belgium for debt rescheduling, credits,
 and assistance in easing EC import quotas, as
 well  as outright grants.  Romania's CEMA
 partners are unlikely to provide aid. Five years
 ago, Peking was the most generous benefacior
 and   Moscow  provided only belated  token
 assistance.
 Other Countries Less Damaged
 Other than  in  Romania, damage from
 storms and localized flooding was probably the
 most severe in Yugoslavia. In Vojvodina and
 Slavonia-Yugoslavia's bread  basket, flanking
 th-, Danube and Drava rivers-emergency har-
 vesting has been delayed by rain and strong
 winds. Early estimates project wheat 'osses at 1
 million tons, about one fifth of the expected
 crop. Losses of other crops may also be high.
 The level of the Danube has fallen in
 Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Although flooding
 caused some crop losses in Czechoslovakia, most
 damage to grains will come from lodging. In
 Hungary, the harvest had just begun when the
 rains came. About one quarter of a million acres
 were reported flooded by July 8, mainly along
 the Danube and Tisza rivers. Over one halt of
 the flooded land was sown to corn.
 In stark contrast to flooding elsewhere, a
 two-month-old drought endangers the grain crop
 in East Germany. The northern and central
 countries have suffered the most with only trace
 amounts of rain falling in some areas. Weather
 data for the first 10 days of July indicate that
 the major grain producing area in the south is
 also drying up. Emergency harvestin has started
 in 6 of 15 counties.

 ANGOLA: ANOTHER ROUND
 After almost a week of intense fighting in
 Luanda, the Popular Movement for the Libera-
 tion of Angola forced the rival National Front
 for the Liberation of Angola to withdraw from
 the city. The latest round o' clashes may also
 have destroyed the territory's fragile six-month-
 old transitional government-a development that
 could seriously disrupt Lisbon's decolonization
 program for Angola.
 With the fighting in the capital going
 against the Front, its senior representative in the
 transitional  government, Johnny Eduardo
 Pinnock, and a number of other Front officials
 fled to the organization's headquarters in Zaire.
 In a subsequent press conference in Kinshasa,
 Pinnock announced that he was resigning from
 his position. He also claimed that the Popular
 Movement is now controlled by "extremists"
 who have pushed aside the group's long-time
 leader, Agostinho Neto.
 Pinnock's resignation, which carried an
 assertion that the National Front is mobilizing
 for full-scale war, was probably design ad in large
 part to prod the Portuguese into imposing a
 tru..e through force of arms. Such a truce may
 be the Front's only chance to pull itself
 together. With the exception of a few small
 garrisons scattered around the environs of
 Luanda, the Front is now isolated in its tribal
 base in northwestern Angola, separated from the
 capital by territory controlled by the Popular
 Movement. It is probably low on arms and sup-
 piies and in no position to wage sustained war at
 the present time.
 The military rulers in Lisbon, who have
 considerable prestige invested in their effort to
 lead Angola to independence next November,
 will probably try to convince the National Front
 to return to the government. The Front is
 unlikely to return unless the Portuguese can
 guarantee peace in the territory, at least until
 national elections can be held. It is probably too
 late for that, however. Although some 24,000
 Portuguese troops remain in the territory, there
 is a real danger they would refuse to intervene
 between the two hostile liberation groups.
 Agostinho Neto
 Moreover, troops in Portugal might well refuse
 to go to Angola at this juncture.
 Portuguese Foreign Minister Antunes, who
 made a quick visit to Luanda during the height
 of the fighting, was unable to arrange a cease-
 fire. He subsequently informed UN Secretary
 General Waldheim that Lisbon may have to take
 "emergency measures" in the territory. Antunes
 hinted last Sunday night prior to his departure
 for Luanda that Lisbon might have to appeal to
 the UN in order to protect the decolonization
 process.
 Whatever the Portuguese and the National
 Front may have in mind, the Popular Movement
 appears determined to score a military victory
 against its competitors, including the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
 the smallest of the three liberation groups. The
 National Union has refused to take sides in the
 fighting between its larger rivals but on several
 occasions has been attacked by the Popular
 Movement.                             25X1

 Independence Declared
 One of the final rounds in the breakup of
 France's once extensive o"mrseas empire is being
 played out on the Co,noro archipelago in the
 Mozambique channel. The legislature of the
 Comoro  Islands declared the islands inde-
 pendent on July 6. The status of one island-
 Mayotte-is still in doubt, however; its inhabi-
 tants want to remain part of France.
 The islands are a major source of the base
 essence used by the French perfume industry
 and have had a large measure of internal self-
 governmeni since  1961.  Independence was
 abruptly declared by the Comorian government
 to counter the effect of a bill passed in late June
 by the French National Assembly. The bill pro-
 vided for the independence of the archipelago
 later this year, but allowed each of the islands to
 vote separately on a proposed independence
 constitution. This would have permitted the
 Mahorais-the inhabitants of Mayotte-to end
 their association with the other islands and
 make Mayotte a French department.
 In a referendum last December, over 60
 percent of the Mahorais opted to retain links
 with France, while the people on the other three
 islands voted overwhelmingly in favor of inde-
 pendence. There is heavy French and Christian
 influence in the Mahorais' culture, in contrast to
 the Muslim culture that is predominant on the
 other islands. Mayotte political  leaders de-
 nounced the independence declaration as illegal,
 and are demanding that France maintain its
 authority on the island. Ahmed Abdallah, the
 new chief of state, has vowed to keep Mayotte a
 part of the Comoros.
 Paris Seeks Middle Ground
 Paris is willing to accept the Comoros' in-
 dependence, but it is keeping its options open
 regarding Mayotte. The government issued a
 communique this week saying it would "take
 into account" the wishes of the Mahorais, but it
 did not explicitly support Mayotte separatism.
 France has agreed to withdraw. its troops and
 civil servants from all the islands except May-
 otte. Pars is trying to locate a middle ground
 between Moroni-the Comorian capital-and
 Mayotte, but it will not be easy.
 France is concerned that retaining Mayotte
 will subject Paris to charges of attempting to
 perpetuate a colonial arrangement, in order to
 ensure France a military presence in the Indian
 Ocean. France is already under increasing criti-
 cism from V can and Arab countries because
 of its continuing hold on the French Territory
 of Afars and Issas.
 Relations between the Comorian govern-
 ment and France will be strained if Paris finally
 agrees to retain Mayotte. The Comorians might
 refrain from an open break because of their
 reliance on French aid. A cooling of relations,
 however, would probably encourage the Ce-
 morians to  seek  assistance from Muslim
 countries.
 Libya has shown an interest in the islands;
 several delegations have visited the Cc'rloros,
 and Abdallah visited Tripoli in March. Saudi
 Arabia may provide some aid to prevent the
 islands from falling under radical Arab influ-
 ence. Iran may also be willing to help.

 ARGENTINA: CRISIS CONTINUING
 President Peron has been seriously weak-
 ened by political and economic setbacks during
 the past two weeks, and there are no indications
 that anyone within the government is capable of
 halting her deteriorating position.
 Lopez Rega has been ousted from his offi-
 cial posts and has moved out of the presidential
 residence, but it is widely believed that hr, is still
 advising Mrs. Peron. Military, labor, and Peronist
 political leaders will continue to urge the Presi-
 dent to end his influence.
 The crisis is likely to be protracted. Lopez
 Rega's opponents stid would prefer that Mrs.
 Peron remain in the presidercy, and they seem
 content for the time being to wait for her to
 make the next move. They now appear prepared
 to accept her resignation, or even force her
 ouster, however, if she insists on retaining him-
 even in an unofficial capacity.l
 The prospects for an orderly transfer of
 power, in the event that Mrs. Peron does step
 aside, improved considerably this week with the
 election of a moderate Peronist, Italo Luder, to
 fill the Senate's provisional presidency. Luder,
 who is first in the line of succession, is a re-
 spected constitutional lawyer and academician
 and is well regarded in most political circles.
 The government has not been able to form-
 ulate proposals for dealing with the worsening
 economic situation that are politically accept-
 able to labor. Ministe.- of Economy Rodrigo, a
 protege of Lopez Rega, is continuing to push
 President Peron swears in Carlos Villone as Social Welfare Minister, replacing Lopez Rega.

 most of the economic austerity program he out-
 lined on June 30. He is totally discredited, how-
 ever, and may soon be forced to resign. Strikes
 and work stoppages are occurring daily in vari-
 ous cities as concern grows that even the recent,
 massive wage hikes soon will be eaten up by
 soaring inflation. Moreover, leftists within the
 labor movement are seeking to exploit the cur-
 rent tension and widen the gulf between
 workers and their top leaders. Some unions are
 jealous because their wage increases did not
 match those of other unions.
 Though there is no evidence of active plot-
 ting against the government, the likelihood of
 Mrs. Peron remaining in office until the election
 in 1977 has diminished considerably. By cling-
 ing to the hated Lopez Rega, the President has
 alienated labor and Peronist political leaders A a
 time when economic problems have reached
 crisis proportions. The economy alone wound
 have severely taxed the skills of a strong, char;s-
 matic leader. Since Mrs. Peron is neither, the
 added problems caused by her association with
 Lopez Rega may be more than she can handle.
 PERU: NONALIGNED CONFERENCE
 Latin America will provide the dais for the
 next rhetorical attack on imperialism by the
 nonaligned conference. As the region has shifted
 away from the US toward the Third world, it
 has produced a rotating leadership among the
 more aggressive proponents of an international
 reformation. Venezuela, Mexico, and Peru en-
 gage in an active but friendly competition for
 the global spotlight as spokesmen for the area.
 The first two will share stardom as launchers of
 a new regional organization, a Latin American
 Economic System, probably at the beginning of
 August. Then Peru will take its turn, as host for
 the foreign ministers conference of the non-
 aligned on August 25-29.
 The Lima site for the meeting underlines
 the growing case with which the Latins play the
 Third World role. Only a few years ago, the
 Latins saw little common ground with the gen-
 erally less developed Asian and African regions
 and shied away from communist regimes. In
 1970, Cuba was the sole full-fledged member of
 the non,;ligned conference. By 1973, seven Latin
 and Caribbean nations attended the summit at
 Algiers as full members; eight went as observers;
 one was "present." Now the Latins are often
 instigators of Third World issues in the UN and
 other world forums, especially on economic
 matters.
 Venezuela and Mexico have been particu-
 larly agile at maintaining are ambidextrous for-
 eign policy that allows for a productive and
 cordial relationship with the US and at the same
 time strengthens their place with the lesser de-
 veloped. Peru had begun to bend somewhat
 away from its more clearly adversary role vis-a-
 vis the US, but the interest of moderates in the
 Peruvian  leadership  in  easing tensions with
 Washington will not put a brake on Lima's in-
 dulgence in Third Worldism.
 The minority of Latir states that hew un-
 abashedly to a pro-US position continues to
 shrink. Even the Somoza government in Nicara-
 gua has begun to examine ways to exhibit dif-
 ferences with Washington in order to avoid isola-
 tion from the mainstream of Latin America.
 The Lima conference, coming immediately
 prior to the opening of the 7th Special Session
 of the United Nations, will be the major point
 of coordination for the Third World positions at
 New York  Many contentious issues will be
 topical, and sources of friction and division
 amr,og the nonaligned continue to be many.
 Cuba, for example, has already attacked the oil
 producers as a budding new privileged minority.
 The pressure for unity nevertheless remains
 powerful, and will probably be further strength-
 ened as the group begins to react to recent
 warnings from Washington about its role in the

 talks because the US government had breached

 open to release those facts that would increase
 pubiic support of his canal stand.

 annoyance at the lack of recent progress i i the
 t.ilks,  the  indications of opposition  to  the

 and tho pessimistic articles in the US press about
 the future of the talks. In statements to the

 the signing of the r:oaso-fire arrangemonts in
 South  Violnain to rebuild the economy o'
 North Viotnarn. Over,rlI growth (luring 1973 and
 1974 was unspectacular, and clearly less than

 South  Vietnam  is  complicating  plans  for
 development of the Nor ', over the next few
 years.
 of investment and muddled policies. Rice yields
 ,ire still among the lowest in Asia, attributable
 to insufficient irrigation, water-control facilities,
 farm niachinery, and high quality fertilizers.
 LZice output  sta(]natod  in  1973  as adverse
 weather (lantaged the autumn harvest, but last
 year output was up 10 percent touter favorable
 growing conditions.
 After lire cease-fire, I-lanoi rapidly restored
 the  bomb-clamagecl  transportation, electric
 power, and small modern industrial sectors, its
 priority objectives. Transport activity increased
 its roads iind bridges were repaired. Reconstruc-
 tion of the Thac 13a hydroelectric power plant,
 the Uonq 13i and Thai Nguyen thernial power
 plants and construction of it new thermal plant
 at Ninth Binh restored nearly all of the electric
 power capacity that existed before the bomb-
 ings; 75 percent had been knocked out in 1972.
 The reconstruction effort as it whole, however,
 was makeshift and shoddy.
 There were some gains in production in
 1974, but attempts to restore output to pro-war
 levels  in  iron  and  steel,  cement,  chemical
 fertilizers, arid coal were only partially success-
 ful. Extensive damage surveys and shortages of
 electric power,   fuel, and  raw  materials and
 technical skills combined to delay the start of
 reconstruction.
 Output  from  light  industry and handi-
 crifts--wiich except for textiles emerged from
 the bombing relatively free of direct damage--
 erew                   moderately    with  the  improvement  in
 transportation facilities, raw material supplies,
 and  electric  power availability. Repairs to
 damaged textile plants, including those at Nam
 Dinh and Haiphong, and construction of new
 ones probably restored most of the country's
 textile production capacity.
 Agriculture still dominates the economy,
 accounting for 35-40 percent of national output
 and employing 70 pc--cent of the civilian labor
 force, but this sector has lagged because of lack
 I lanoi has leaned heavily on its communist
 allies for commodity and capital assistance. Aid
 jumped f;-om $425 million in 1972 to about
 $600 million in 1973 and then to $1.2 billion in
 1974.
 Last  December,  Hanoi  adopted  an
 ambitious 20-percent  target  for economic
 growth in 1975, but this now appears unattain-
 able even though substantial industrial growth
 can be expected as restoration and expansion of
 large plants are complete(]. I-li;noi simply (lid not
 anticipate the military take-over of the South in
 April, which has forced the North to  focus
 attention on improving security, administering
 the government, and reviving the economy in
 the South.
 Growth prospects beyond the next year or
 so are likely to get worse before they get better,
 despite  a  large  labor  force  and relatively
 abundant  natural  resources.  North  Vietnam
