 A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SEVENTH ALL-CHINA
 CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions was
 held in Peking, the capital of the People's Republic of China,
 from May 2 to 11 under the auspices of the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 This Congress was the first national congress of trade
 unions held by the Chinese working class after the victory
 of the people's democratic revolution and the founding of the
 People's Republic of China.  It marked the beginning of a
 new era for the Chinese working-class movement, an era of
 struggle for the industrialization of the country.
 Comrade Liu Shao-chi, an outstanding leader of the
 Chinese working-class movement, addressing the Congress
 on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
 of China, clearly pointed out:
 Our Motherland is now entering upon a new historic
 epoch and has entrusted us with a new historic task,
 the task of carrying out the industrialization of our
 country and the gradual transition to socialism.
 After  thorough  discussion  the  Congress  unanimously
 adopted the resolutions concerning reports on the trade
 union work in China, on the amendments to the constitution
 and on the financial work of the trade unions. The Constitu-
 tion of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic of China
 was also passed.  It concretely defines the fundamental
 tasks and the political and organizational programme of the
 working-class movement and of the trade union work in the
 period of national planned construction.  The Congress
 elected the new leading body of the All-China Federation of

 Trade Unions-the Seventh Executive Committee composed
 of 99 members (with one seat reserved for the workers'
 delegate from Taiwan) and 42 alternate members, and an
 Auditing Committee composed of 17 members.  The Con-
 gress demonstrated the unprecedented unity of the Chinese
 working class.
 Delegates to the Congress numbered 831, with 813
 actually attending.  They came from 29 provinces, 12 large
 cities and one autonomous region, representing 10,200,000
 trade union members.  Moreover, representatives from the
 railway workers of the Chinese People's Volunteers also took
 part.  Thirty-eight trade union delegates and model workers
 from various regions and industries spoke one after another
 at the Congress. They reported on the great achievements
 of the workers in different places and industries in restoring
 the national economy and in construction undertakings,
 indicating the determination of the Chinese working class to
 fulfil and over-fulfil the state construction plans and to defend
 peace.  They all realized that the well-steeled Communist
 Party of China, headed by the great Mao Tse-tung, which
 led the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to
 victory in the revolution as well as in economic rehabilitation,
 is the banner of victory of both the working class and the
 entire people, their organizer and their source of inspiration
 in the cause of national industrialization.  Today our great
 Motherland has entered upon the era of construction, and
 the Chinese Communist Party will lead us to fresh victories
 -the victories in industrialization and gradual transition to
 socialism.
 Under the guidance and care of the Central Committee
 of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung, and with the support of the Central People's
 Government and the whole Chinese people, the Congress
 achieved important successes, which will be of profound

 significance to the working-class movement and trade union
 work in the new era.
 The Congress fully demonstrated the internationalist
 solidarity between the Chinese working class and the work-
 ing class of other countries.  Messages of greetings were
 received from the trade union organizations all over the
 world.  Attending the Congress was the delegation, headed
 by Louis Saillant, from the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, the leading body of the world trade union movement,
 an organization which struggles for the unity and solidarity
 of the working class of the world and strives unceasingly for
 and contributes greatly to the defence of world peace.  In
 addition, there were the representative of the Asian and
 Australasian Liaison Bureau of the WFTU, the trade union
 delegation, headed by I. V. Goroshkin, from the Union of
 Soviet Socialist Republics, the closest and greatest ally of the
 Chinese people, trade union delegates from the People's
 Democracies and the German Democratic Republic, and dele-
 gations from trade union organizations of many Asian,
 Australasian, African and European countries.  There were
 altogether 105 trade union delegates from 20 foreign countries.
 Louis Saillant and Goroshkin and trade union delegates of 19
 other countries addressed the Congress. These addresses and
 the messages of greetings expressed the support of the world
 working class for the Chinese working class and the Chinese
 people in their great peaceful construction.  They stimulated
 still further the enthusiasm and confidence of the Chinese
 working class and the Chinese people in building up their
 country and defending world peace. Through this Congress,
 the Chinese working class further understood that it should
 make greater efforts towards the unity and solidarity of the
 international working-class movement and towards a lasting
 world peace.

 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions, in
 response to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions
 for the convocation of the Third World Congress of Trade
 Unions, unanimously endorsed the decision of the WFTU
 and elected a delegation of 30 persons.  This once more
 manifested the close unity steadily growing between the
 Chinese working class and the working class of other coun-
 tries all over the world.
 The Chinese working class and the Chinese people
 enthusiastically supported the Congress and showed it deep
 concern.  In this new era of national construction, with the
 assistance rendered by the great Soviet Union in the spirit
 of lofty friendship, we will struggle to carry out the directives
 of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
 and Comrade Mao Tse-tung and accomplish the tasks of the
 trade unions of China-the industrialization of the country
 and gradual transition to socialism.

 SPEECH  BY LIU SHAO-CHI ON BEHALF OF THE
 CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST
 PARTY OF CHINA
 Comrades and Guests:
 On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist
 Party of China I extend warm greetings and felicitations
 to the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions.
 Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
 and Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese working class has
 carried out protracted and heroic struggles, and, in the
 revolutionary struggles, established the closest alliance with
 the broad masses of the peasants through the Chinese Com-
 munist Party, thus obtaining  immense help  from the
 peasantry.  At the same time, it has established a revolution-
 ary united front with other democratic classes in the country.
 It has thus formed a mighty revolutionary force, which
 defeated foreign imperialism and the counter-revolutionaries
 within the country, and achieved victory in the great
 revolution of the people.  After the victory of the revolution,
 it consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, supported
 the victorious struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid
 Korea, and completed the rehabilitation of the national
 economy.  All these are great historic successes.  In these
 great struggles, the broad masses of the Chinese working
 class have shown boundless courage and industry, contributed
 wisdom and fulfilled the duty that history bestowed upon
 them.  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of
 China would like to express its sincere gratitude to the
 Chinese working class.

 Comrades!  Our Motherland is now entering upon a new
 historic epoch and has entrusted us with a new historic task,
 the task of carrying out the industrialization of our country
 and the gradual transition to socialism.  Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung has said:                                        "Without industry, it would not be possible
 to have solid national defence, welfare for the people and a
 strong and prosperous country."
 The first and foremost need for the development of our
 country under present conditions is the rapid development of
 our industry and especially the building and development of
 our heavy industry.  The level of our present industrial out-
 put must be raised from year to year both in quantity and
 quality.  Many factories will be renovated and expanded.
 At the same time we will build many new factories and new
 branches of industrial production.  Other economic and cul-
 tural enterprises must also be developed rapidly in conformity
 with the development of industry.
 Step by step we must turn our country into an industrial
 country with a high technical level. This great enterprise has
 already begun; work on several hundred construction projects
 is already, or will soon be, started, and they will be carried
 on in the future on an ever expanding scale.  The fulfilment
 of this historic task will make our country and our people
 immensely rich and prosperous.      But such a task depends
 especially on the Chinese working class, who must make their
 efforts in a better organized way and on a higher level of
 political consciousness.
 For the purpose of carrying out this new historic task, we
 must exert the greatest efforts toward developing to the full
 the activity and creativeness of the broad masses of the work-
 ing class, in the struggle for fulfilling and over-fulfilling the
 economic plan of the country, and in the struggle for raising
 labour productivity, improving the quality of products, prac-
 tising strict economy and reducing cost of production.

 In order to do this, it is necessary to organize effectively
 labour emulation drives of the workers in a practical way, to
 bring to the fore and seriously study all new and advanced
 experiences  and  rationalization  proposals.  We  should
 especially learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet
 Union, spread these advanced experiences and apply them in
 a practical way.  We must incessantly raise the technical and
 cultural levels of the workers.  We must intensify the training
 of the ever-growing number of new workers, and help the old
 workers treat the new workers in a proper and helpful
 manner.
 For this purpose we must strengthen communist educa-
 tion among the workers and raise their political conscious-
 ness, so that they may realize the identity of the interests
 of all the people, of the state and of their own.  At the same
 time we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism
 to overcome the defects and correct the mistakes existing in
 the various enterprises, oppose bureaucracy, oppose all kinds
 of breach of labour discipline and greatly strengthen labour
 discipline.
 For this purpose too we must constantly pay close atten-
 tion to the living conditions of the masses of the workers.
 On the basis of increased production, the material and cul-
 tural life and working conditions of the workers shall be
 improved step by step wherever necessary and possible.  To
 raise the material and cultural well-being of the working
 class and all the labouring people, and to prevent our coun-
 try from being invaded by imperialism constitutes the
 ultimate aims of the industrial development and all other
 efforts of our country.
 I believe that in the deliberations of this Congress you
 will and should thoroughly discuss these problems.  If these
 problems are solved correctly, we will further improve our

 The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
 is convinced that the trade union work in China has made
 positive achievements. However, there are still many defects
 and mistakes.  We hope that you will seriously develop criti-
 cism and self-criticism in order to make known the good
 points, overcome the defects and correct the mistakes, in
 order that the work of the trade unions, under the leadership
 of the Communist Party, will be further improved and that
 our trade unions will actually become, as Lenin said, the
 "builder of new life," the "educator of tens of millions."
 Comrades!  Aside from shouldering the above-mentioned
 responsibilities in the domestic field, the Chinese working
 class has to take upon itself grave responsibilities in the in-
 ternational field.  That is, the Chinese working class must
 struggle for the unity of the working class of the whole
 world and, under the leadership of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions, must strive for the unity of the international
 working-class movement and work together with the working
 class of all the countries and the progressive mankind as
 a whole for the defence of world peace and security.
 The Chinese working class which has already achieved
 victory must whole-heartedly render every possible assistance
 to the working class and labouring people in capitalist as
 well as colonial and semi-colonial countries.  This is a
 glorious duty which we must not shirk.  The Chinese trade
 unions must in the future strengthen their work in this respect
 so that it can be better carried out.
 Comrades, the responsibilities in both domestic and in-
 ternational fields of the working class as the leading class
 in our country are enormous.  In order to gradually carry
 out national industrialization and the transition to a socialist
 society and in order to best shoulder our international re-
 sponsibilities, we must consolidate the unity in the ranks
 of the working class, further consolidate the alliance of the

 workers and peasants and the intellectuals and strengthen
 the people's democratic front based on the alliance of the
 workers and peasants.  Our comrades must take note that
 the whole country is paying close attention to every piece of
 work done by the working class, and the labouring people and
 progressive mankind throughout the world are following our
 work with the same interest.  The success or failure of our
 work will have far-reaching effects.  Therefore, our trade
 unions must educate all the workers to remember what Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung has taught us-not to be satisfied with
 our past achievements, never to show arrogance, and to
 maintain every minute of the day a modest attitude of learn-
 ing, to abandon all bad habits and prejudices and make every
 effort to improve ourselves-so that the working class can
 do all its work in an ever better manner.  Only in this way
 shall we not disappoint the hope of all the Chinese people
 and the labouring people of the whole world.
 We are confident that under the brilliant leadership of
 the Communist Party of China and of Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung, with the common efforts of the Chinese working class
 and the entire population, and with the mighty help of the
 Soviet Union, the People's Democracies and the working
 people of the whole world, we shall be able to overcome all
 difficulties and succeed in making China a happy, socialist,
 industrialized and strong nation.
 March forward under the banner of the great teachings
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin!
 March forward under the leadership of our leader, Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung!
 Long live the unity of the whole Chinese working class!
 Long live the unity of the working class throughout the
 world!

 SPEECH  BY  CHEN  SHU-TUNG  ON  BEHALF  OF
 THE  CHINESE PEOPLE'S POLITICAL
 CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE
 Delegates and Comrades:
 On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese
 People's Political Consultative Conference, I warmly greet
 the opening of the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade
 Unions.
 Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the
 Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class,
 displaying unmatched courage and firm will, has always
 stood in the forefront, whether in the struggle for the libera-
 tion of the Chinese people, in the construction of the country,
 or in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.  The
 workers have shown inexhaustible wisdom and strength, and
 have constantly overcome difficulties.  Many heroes and
 model workers, both men and women, have emerged from
 the working class.  Victories have been won.  These victories
 have brought about profound and basic changes in all aspects
 of Chinese society.
 In the three years since the liberation of the whole
 country, the Chinese people have become united as never
 before; state economy, disrupted by protracted fighting, has
 been completely restored; people's democratic dictatorship
 has been firmly established; the ranks of the working class
 have grown on an unprecedented scale, its status as the
 leading class has been strengthened.  All this has created
 advantageous conditions for our country's large-scale, long-
 term and planned construction.

 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions is
 being held at a time when our great Motherland and our
 great people are confronted in 1953 with three great tasks:
 (1) to continue to strengthen the Movement to Resist U.S.
 Aggression and Aid Korea; (2) to start the Five-Year Plan
 of national construction; and (3) to convene the All-China
 People's Congress and local people's congresses of all levels.
 The convening of the Seventh All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions, therefore, is of vital significance.  I believe,
 that just like the congresses of the past, it will play an im-
 portant role in mobilizing the working class of the whole
 country to respond to the state's call for the fulfilment of
 these three great tasks.
 We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Seventh
 All-China Congress of Trade Unions, the working class of
 the whole country will become still more united under the
 banner of the great Mao Tse-tung, and that it will make every
 effort to develop labour emulation drives, observe labour
 discipline, study advanced Soviet experiences, advanced
 methods of work, develop potential productive forces, increase
 labour productivity, improve the quality of production, econo-
 mize raw materials, reduce production costs, and struggle
 for the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of national construc-
 tion plans.
 Moreover, the workers will take an active part in the
 elections of the people's congresses of all levels by voting
 for those whom they think most competent and most qualified
 to serve in central government institutions and local gov-
 ernment bodies, so as to strengthen the Chinese people's
 democratic dictatorship and national economic construction.
 Everyone knows that the cause of national economic
 construction is inseparable from the defence of world peace.
 Hence, the working class of the whole country should unite
 all the more closely with all the toiling people to continue to

 strengthen the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and
 Aid Korea, consolidate national defence, ensure state security
 and peaceful construction, and further strengthen the demo-
 cratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and defend
 peace in the Far East and the whole world.
 Comrades!  The three tasks before us are as momentous
 as they are glorious.  But we are fully confident that we shall
 successfully accomplish these great and urgent tasks.  Past
 experience has proved that under the leadership of Chairman
 Mao Tse-tung and the Communist Party of China the Chinese
 people have the strength at their command to achieve great
 and brilliant successes.
 Finally, I wish this Congress every success.

 SPEECH  BY  LIN  PO-CHU  ON  BEHALF  OF THE
 CENTRAL  PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT
 Delegates and Comrades:
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions was
 inaugurated in Peking today. On behalf of the Central
 People's Government, I extend warm greetings to the Con-
 gress.
 Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
 and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung, the Chinese working class, together with the
 Chinese people, has finally achieved victory in the great rev-
 olution and has founded the People's Republic of China
 after more than thirty years of heroic struggle.  This is the
 greatest victory the Chinese working class and the labour-
 ing people of China have ever won in their history.  It is
 precisely because the state system of this country is that of
 a people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class
 and based on the alliance of the workers and peasants that
 the status of the working class and the labouring people has
 undergone distinct, basic changes.
 Ever since its establishment, the Central People's Gov-
 ernment of the People's Republic of China, in order to
 safeguard the fruits of the people's victory and to consolidate
 the people's democratic dictatorship, has relied on the working
 class and the people of the whole country to carry out the
 great Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea,
 the land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries,
 San Fan and Wu Fan movements, and the democratic reform
 in the enterprises throughout the country.  Through more
 than three years of ceaseless struggle, the working class has

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 scored brilliant victories on many fronts.  Our country has
 achieved unprecedented unity; the feudal system has been
 shattered to its very foundation; the financial and economic
 conditions of our country have taken a fundamental turn
 for the better; the country's industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction has not only reached but has in certain cases sur-
 passed the highest levels in the pre-liberation days.
 Having become masters of the country, and realizing
 their responsibility, China's workers have, during these great
 movements, fully developed their creativeness and initiative,
 and have played a truly leading role among the people of the
 whole country.  In the labour emulation drives and in the
 dissemination of advanced experiences, many model workers
 and inspiring deeds have come to the fore.  These move-
 ments have in turn raised and tempered the political con-
 sciousness of the Chinese working class which, fully confident
 of victory, is advancing to fulfil the glorious task of planned
 construction of the country.  This has fully proved that the
 social and state system of people's democracy, based on the
 leadership of the working class and the alliance of the workers
 and peasants, is immeasurably superior to the capitalist
 system.
 From the very first day, the Central People's Govern-
 ment, headed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung, has paid special
 attention to the status and role of the working class in the
 state power of our country, and to the great significance of
 strengthening the trade union work as a means of achieving
 the industrialization of the country and its advancement
 towards socialism.
 The Trade Union Law promulgated by the Central Peo-
 ple's Government in June 1950, the Labour Insurance Reg-
 ulations promulgated by the Government Administration
 Council of the Central People's Government in February 1951,
 and other labour-protecting policies  are  all  important

 measures to develop the active role of the working class in
 the construction of the country.
 In January 1953, the Central People's Government
 adopted a decision to hold general elections and to convene
 thereafter the All-China People's Congress and local people's
 congresses of all levels, and to draw up the Constitution.
 This will further demonstrate the superiority of the social and
 state system of people's democracy.  We are fully convinced
 that the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the
 Communist Party of China, will further develop its own
 strength, unite more closely with the peasants, and on the
 basis of the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance,
 rally all the nationalities and people of all strata of the whole
 country to fulfil this historically significant task in the polit-
 ical life of our country.
 Comrades!  This year marks the beginning of the First
 Five-Year Plan of national construction.  Facing this great
 and glorious task, we are fully confident that, under the
 leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great
 leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Tse-tung, the
 Chinese working class will, by its own labour and wisdom,
 participate with ever greater enthusiasm in national con-
 struction.  The trade unions of China will strengthen their
 activities and further unite and guide the working class
 throughout the country to study Soviet advanced experiences,
 unfold patriotic labour emulation drives, supervise the
 thorough implementation of government policies, laws and
 decrees in state and private enterprises, ensure the fulfil-
 ment and over-fulfilment of the state economic plan, march
 towards the industrialization of the country and socialism,
 and, uniting with the world working class, strive for a last-
 ing world peace and people's democracy.
 Long live the Chinese working class!

 SPEECH BY LOUIS SAILLANT ON BEHALF OF THE
 WORLD FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS
 Dear Comrades:
 On behalf of the 80 million workers united in the ranks
 of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I fraternally and
 warmly salute the delegates to the Seventh All-China Con-
 gress of Trade Unions and all the workers of your great
 and wonderful country.
 I warmly wish the greatest success to the Congress which
 is an important event in the national life of China, as well
 as an important event in the life of our international working-
 class movement.
 From this rostrum I should like to extend my sincere
 thanks to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its
 valuable assistance to and constant support of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions and its Trade Departments.
 By actively participating in the international working-
 class movement, in showing numerous proofs of its inter-
 national solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 is holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism in
 the countries of Asia and Australasia, a banner behind
 which the workers in the capitalist and colonial countries in
 the struggle against their exploiters stand shoulder to shoulder
 with their brothers and sisters of the Soviet Union, the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China, and all the People's Democracies,
 thus forming the world front of struggle of the workers on
 the glorious road to socialism.  The workers throughout the
 world follow with great sympathy the success of the Chinese
 people in the building up of a new state which protects the
 people who from now on are masters of their own destiny.

 Your first successes in your creative work, dear Chinese
 comrades, have without any doubt put you on the road to
 even greater successes.
 You have taken this road under the guidance of your
 respected and beloved leader, Chairman of your glorious
 Communist Party, Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
 We view with great joy the progressive transformation
 of China.  The Chinese workers have the right to be proud
 of the achievements to which they are devoting all their
 efforts and all the passion of a people that loves its country.
 In their work of creating a new and happy life in your
 country, which without any doubt is laying the foundations
 of socialism, the Chinese people are drawing inspiration
 from the great historic lessons and the victorious experiences
 of the Soviet people-the first people in the history of mankind
 to have shown that capitalism was neither universal nor
 eternal, and who with the October Revolution of 1917, showed
 that the era of socialism had begun, opening new perspectives
 before all mankind.
 Comrades, while you men and women workers of New
 China are winning day after day new successes on the road
 to a better life, the situation of the workers in the capitalist,
 semi-colonial and colonial countries is very different.
 In point of fact, misery is increasing in these countries,
 wreaking havoc among families.  Unemployment is rapidly
 expanding.  Wherever social welfare exists, it is subjected
 to attacks. Social legislation is under constant attack.  Re-
 pression is striking the working class, its militants and its
 organizations. Where the monopoly capitalists are accumulat-
 ing maximum gigantic profits the living conditions of millions
 of working men and women are becoming more and more
 unbearable.
 This is why the number of struggles for wage demands
 has increased considerably recently.  The workers, with ever-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 increasing unity of action, are switching more and more on
 to the offensive in these struggles.
 The recent strikes in Japan, the many strikes in India
 and other countries of South-East Asia, and the general in-
 crease of struggles against unemployment, dismissals and
 the lowering of real wages, are proofs of positive develop-
 ments of this mass action.
 Every case confirms the direct link that exists between
 the workers' struggles for their demands and the action of
 the people for national independence and the defence of peace.
 How is one to characterize the conditions under which
 the struggles of the workers and the activity of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions are developing in the capitalist,
 colonial and semi-colonial countries?  We can answer this
 question as follows:
 1.  The unceasing struggles of the labouring masses for
 better living conditions, for peace and national independence
 are resulting in the open violation by the ruling classes of
 the capitalist countries of their own bourgeois laws.  These
 bourgeois laws no longer sufficiently protect the ruling classes
 against the legitimate demands of the working masses.    The
 ruling classes are resorting more and more to brutal, anti-
 democratic and anti-working class repression.  They are
 changing their regimes into police regimes which will
 absolutely protect their class privileges.
 Political and social discrimination of a fascist character
 is one of the bases of the new laws which the ruling class
 is attempting to establish and extend.
 2.  Contradictions of interests between the capitalist
 countries are arising and growing more open than in pre-
 vious years.  Other conflicts are rapidly maturing which are
 the direct consequence of the intolerable policy of the Ameri-
 can imperialists in trying to achieve world hegemony.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 In face of these contradictions of interests between
 capitalists eager for maximum profits, the working class with
 its vanguard organizations and its trade unions is developing
 its struggles on the basis of proletarian internationalism.
 In each country, the working class is furthering the cause of
 unity among workers, peasants, intellectuals and the pro-
 gressive sections of the bourgeoisie.  Thus the  ardent
 struggle of the peoples for their democratic rights and vital
 needs is linked with their no less ardent struggle for national
 independence.
 3.  The conflicts between the peoples of the colonial and
 semi-colonial countries and the governments of the colonial
 powers are growing, and becoming more intense.  Within
 the last few years they have extended to new sections of the
 world.  The whole colonial system is shaken to all its tradi-
 tional and vital foundations.  The colonial and feudal systems
 are seeing the rise of millions of human beings in open
 struggle against colonial oppression.
 In these struggles, the estimations we made here in
 Peking in December 1949 at the Trade Union Conference of
 the Asian and Australasian Countries concerning the role and
 tasks of the trade unions have proved to be correct.
 In the colonial and semi-colonial countries the trade
 unions are a real force of a genuinely national character from
 the moment when they take an active part in the people's re-
 sistance against colonialism and when they become impor-
 tant basis for the development of mass action.
 This makes the colonialists want to subject the trade
 unions completely to their own policies.  But they are meet-
 ing with increasing difficulties.
 We certainly foresee the time when the trade unions in
 the colonial and semi-colonial countries will surge forward
 and develop fully.  This will be the moment when the peo-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 ple, through a tremendous effort of patriotism, will have
 shaken off the hold of imperialism and colonial slavery.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to support this great, historic struggle of the
 peoples for their national independence and national libera-
 tion wherever it is necessary.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to have stimulated the great currents of in-
 ternational solidarity on behalf of the complete liberation of
 the colonial peoples.
 It is the honour and pride of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions to have stood since June 25, 1950, side by side
 with the Korean people, who rose united and solid as a rock
 against the aggression of the United States imperialists.
 In the last three years the World Federation of Trade
 Unions has continuously affirmed its active solidarity with
 the wonderful people of Korea.  From this rostrum you will
 permit its representative to express his gratitude and pay
 homage both to the fighting Korean people and to the heroic
 Chinese Volunteers.
 The move for peace from the governments of the People's
 Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of
 Korea, shows the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the
 whole Korean question and was welcomed last month by all
 the peoples of Asia and by those of the other continents.
 Today, the facts once more prove that there is no in-
 ternational conflict that cannot be settled by discussion and
 negotiation.  We are now living in a period of major im-
 portance for the destiny of our generation and future genera-
 tions.                                The World Federation of Trade Unions, at the 22nd
 meeting of its Executive Bureau which took place a week ago
 in Vienna, Austria, called on the workers of all lands to
 redouble their efforts and to use every means of pressure in
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 their power to obtain an immediate ceasefire in Korea and a
 peaceful settlement of the Korean question.
 Expressing the will of these masses, the World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions considers that the recent debate at the
 United Nations on the Korean question now makes it neces-
 sary for that organization to adopt truly effective measures
 for the establishment of peace in Korea.
 If the United Nations does not take such measures it
 will lose for ever all its prestige in the eyes of the people of
 the world.  The United Nations, which to our regret has
 covered the imperialist operation against the Korean people
 with its flag, can become an instrument of peace in the service
 of the peoples.  For this the obligations for which it was
 created in 1945 must first of all be honoured.
 The United Nations organization must thereafter, and
 without further delay, put an end to its own weakness by
 giving the Central People's Government of the People's Re-
 public of China the seat in the United Nations to which the
 great Chinese people is entitled.
 By taking the cause of peace in their hands and defend-
 ing it to the end, the peoples can, by their joint efforts, make
 1953 a noteworthy stage in the strengthening of friendly co-
 operation between them, the establishment of peaceful rela-
 tions between all nations whatever their social system, and
 the starting point for the immediate building of peace.
 The trade unions have a special role to play in the cause
 of peaceful coexistence.  They can be in their respective
 countries, in the capitalist, semi-colonial and colonial coun-
 tries, the driving force for an economic policy based on great
 commercial interchange as opposed to the present discrimina-
 tion fomented and desired by the imperialists.
 This particular activity of the trade unions will buttress
 in a concrete and solid manner their participation in the
 struggle for national independence and national liberation.

 Comrades!
 One of the reasons why we attach great importance to
 the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions is that it
 takes place five months before the convocation of the Third
 World Trade Union Congress which will be held in Vienna
 beginning on October 10 next.  Organized by our Federa-
 tion, the Third World Trade Union Congress will be effec-
 tively the congress of all the workers of the whole world.
 This Congress will be a congress of unity in which or-
 ganizations not affiliated to the WFTU but desirous of defend-
 ing the workers' interests and peace, may participate.
 On April 22, the Executive Bureau of the World Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions appealed to the workers of the world
 to prepare for the Third World Trade Union Congress.  What
 language does the World Federation of Trade Unions use to
 all the workers of the world, to all the trade unions, whether
 they be members of the Federation or not?
 It is the language of comradeship, of fraternity and of
 solidarity.
 The World Federation of Trade Unions said to them:
 Dear Comrades and Friends,
 We live in different countries.  We represent all the
 races, all the nationalities, and all the political and
 religious convictions on earth.      We speak different
 languages but we have common interests for we are class
 brothers.  We are united in the conviction that the living
 conditions of the workers are deteriorating in the capi-
 talist and colonial countries and that we must struggle
 for an improvement.
 We are united in the conviction that, wherever it
 exists, social legislation should be improved, and that
 it should be instituted wherever there is none.
 We are united in the conviction that an end must
 be put to super-exploitation, and that discrimination

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 against race, colour, sex or age must be abolished.  We
 are united in the conviction that public health should
 be improved, and education should be extended.  We are
 united in the conviction that no one has the right to
 forbid the legitimate activities of the trade unions, nor
 rob man of his rights and his basic and sacred democratic
 liberties.
 Finally, we are united in the conviction that peace
 can be safeguarded and that war is not inevitable.
 We have, then, a broad basis for unity.  If we want
 to win our struggles we must make this unity of common
 aims and interests into a unity of action.  Wherever the
 workers are united success is assured.
 The World Federation of Trade Unions has always
 considered the struggle for international unity of action
 among the workers as its greatest duty.     It has always
 promoted the unity and action of workers.
 By preparing for it at all places of work, make the
 Third World Trade Union Congress a great congress of
 unity of all the workers of all countries.
 Undoubtedly no other organization is in the position so
 to speak to the workers of the world.  The splitters in the
 ranks of trade union movement are the advocates of im-
 perialist policies who support the colonial and semi-colonial
 systems because they personally are closely linked with the
 interests and actions of the imperialist governments.  It is
 not they who can speak this way to the workers of all coun-
 tries.
 The World Federation of Trade Unions is conscious of
 its responsibilities before the workers of the whole world.
 We do not feel responsible only before the 80 million mem-
 bers of the Federation or the workers affiliated to the World
 Federation of Trade Unions.

 More and more we say, whether the union to which they
 are affiliated is a member of the World Federation of Trade
 Unions or not, every time workers take action in a capitalist,
 semi-colonial or colonial country, the needs of their struggle,
 its causes, and the creation of the conditions for its success
 invariably lead these workers to take the banner of the World
 Federation of Trade Unions as their banner, and the essential
 parts of the Programme of the World Federation of Trade
 Unions as their programme, and to use the means of action
 which are recommended by the Federation.
 This means that the World Federation of Trade Unions
 is responsible for its actions before the workers belonging
 to trade unions which are not affiliated to it.
 We gladly accept such responsibilities, because they
 testify to the increasing development of united action among
 the workers in every country, as well as to the development
 of international united action.
 Once more we affirm that the question of united action
 is the foundation of all success in trade union activities and
 in the activity of working men and women.
 To achieve united action everywhere, such is the essential
 and decisive task which confronts the trade union movement
 today.
 Our stand in favour of united action and of united trade
 union movement in all countries is a fundamental stand for
 the World Federation of Trade Unions.
 The friends and partisans of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions must act from this fundamental stand and
 always respect it.  In this way, they will constantly give
 rise to new moves for unity; in this way, they will create the
 conditions for a broad rallying of the masses.
 The task of the trade unions and their leaders is never
 to allow themselves to become detached from the masses of

 workers, and to raise their class consciousness through
 everyday struggles and experiences.
 The task of the trade unions and their leaders is to know
 themselves how to learn from the masses and with the masses.
 We will forward the work of unity among the workers
 in the preparations for the Third World Trade Union Con-
 gress by developing new efforts in favour of unity and by
 exposing before the workers the anti-working class and anti-
 democratic policies of the diehard enemies of unity.
 Long live the unity of the workers of the whole world and
 their international solidarity!
 Long live the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade
 Unions!
 Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, the
 active fighter for peace among all peoples, for national
 independence, for democratic liberties and the welfare of the
 workers of the world!
 Long live the Central People's Government of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China and the leader of the Chinese people,
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung!

 SPEECH BY 1. V. GOROSHKIN ON BEHALF OF THE
 SOVIET  TRADE  UNION  DELEGATION
 Dear Comrades:
 We are entrusted by the All-Union Central Council of
 Trade Unions, U.S.S.R., to convey to you, the delegates of
 the Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions, and
 through you to the great Chinese people, our hearty and
 fraternal greetings.
 Your Congress is convened at a time of immense victories
 attained by the Chinese people in the creation of their new
 life.
 The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has
 removed the imperialist and feudal yoke, and directed the
 life of the Chinese people along a new path, along the path
 of creating a free and happy life.
 The working people of your country during a short
 period have gained remarkable achievements in the field of
 restoration and development of industry, transport and
 agriculture.  By the end of 1952 industrial and agricultural
 production has already reached the pre-war level and in many
 fields of production surpassed this level.  On the basis of
 achievements in economic construction the material and
 cultural standard of the people is being steadily raised.
 Successful restoration of the economy has created the
 foundation for transition towards planned development of
 the national economy on the basis of industrialization, and
 has allowed you from 1953 to proceed your work on a wide
 scale, which ensures the further development of industry,
 transport, agriculture, the growth of culture and education,
 and the raising of the material well-being of the population.

 The working people of the Soviet Union watch your
 work with attention and sympathy, and they rejoice over
 your achievements in the construction of the mighty people's
 democratic state, the achievements gained under the leader-
 ship of the heroic Communist Party and their much tried
 leader Comrade Mao Tse-tung.
 All freedom-loving peoples are inspired by your suc-
 cesses.  They see in the creation and strengthening of the
 People's Republic of China the victory of the camp of peace,
 democracy and socialism.
 The Soviet people, rallying closely around the Communist
 Party and the Soviet Government, are working with the
 greatest enthusiasm for the fulfilment of the Fifth Five-Year
 Plan.  They are filled with the lofty aspiration to use all
 their strength, experience and knowledge to struggle for the
 complete triumph of the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.
 In this creative work of the Soviet people, the trade
 unions play a great and honourable role. Socialist emulation,
 embracing the entire people of our enterprises, and guided
 by the trade unions, becomes more and more mighty.
 Men and women workers are successfully carrying out
 emulation for the fulfilment of the plans ahead of schedule,
 for high quality production, for the economizing in the use
 of raw materials, and for surpassing the plan of socialist
 accumulation.
 In fulfilling their socialist obligations the workers of
 our country receive comradely. help from our trade unions.
 The network of the Stakhanovite schools, schools of the
 working youth, various courses and circles, night and cor-
 respondence courses of the technical secondary schools and
 colleges is widespread throughout the Soviet enterprises

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 All these give fullest possibilities to the workers and
 employees to take secondary and higher education without
 ceasing work, and to heighten their industrial qualifications.
 The results of socialist emulation are expressed in the
 outstanding development of the national economy.
 The results of work during the first two years of the
 Fifth Five-Year Plan clearly show that our people are
 successfully carrying out the directions of the 19th Party
 Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and the wise and
 brilliant instructions of our leader and teacher Comrade
 Stalin concerning the path of transition from socialism to
 communism.
 In 1952 our industry over-fulfilled the plan, the gross
 output was by 11 % more than that of 1951.  Those industries
 which produce the means of production are developing
 especially rapidly.  In 1952 the general output exceeded the
 pre-war level by approximately 170%.
 During the previous year the Soviet machine-building
 industry produced machines and equipment amounting to
 nearly 300% of those of the pre-war year of 1940.
 The industries producing consumer goods are steadily
 growing.  Socialist  agriculture  has  attained  important
 achievements.   The gross harvest of grain in 1952 amounted
 to eight milliard poods.
 The growth of public production in the Soviet Union,
 is not an end in itself but a means to achieve maximumi
 satisfaction of the steadily growing material and cultural
 needs of the whole society.
 The Communist Party and the Soviet Government un-
 ceasingly care for the betterment of the material well-being
 of the workers, collective farmers, intelligentzia and all
 Soviet people.
 The significant achievements, reached by our people in,
 the development of industrial and agricultural production,

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 have afforded the possibility of carrying out from the first
 of April of this year the sixth reduction of state retail prices,
 of food and industrial goods since 1947.
 The new reduction of retail prices will promote the
 further substantial raising of the living standards of all
 strata of the population of our country, raise the real wages
 of the workers and employees and increase the income of
 the farmers.
 The steady rising of the living standards of the Soviet
 people is convincing proof of the superiority of the socialist
 order over that of capitalism.  The latter dooms the working
 people to misery, unemployment and hardships which are
 linked with militarization of the national economy and the
 preparation for a new war.
 In our country large-scale work in building houses and
 other buildings for cultural and daily needs is being carried
 out.  With these aims the Fifth Five-Year Plan provides for
 expenditure of tens of milliards of rubles.  The Soviet people
 have tens of millions of square metres of new and well-
 arranged buildings, hundreds of new clubs, schools, hospitals,
 sanatoria and rest homes.
 A powerful factor in raising the material well-being
 of the workers and employees in our country is the state
 social insurance.  The management of the entire system of
 social insurance is in the hands of the trade unions.
 In 1953 the State allotted more than 22.5 milliard rubles
 for social insurance measures.  Expenditure for old-age
 pensions and continuous employment pensions for those who
 continue working, for benefits in case of temporary disable-
 ment due to sickness or accident, and for maternity benefits,
 will amount to more than 19.5 milliard rubles.
 In  1953,  about  three  million workers  and  office
 employees will rest or take cures at the expense of social
 insurance funds at the trade union health resorts. During

 the summer months more than five million Soviet children
 will enjoy holidays in the pioneers' summer camps and
 cottages.  The working people of the Soviet Union receive
 free medical aid in the medical establishments.
 The steady raising of the material and cultural standards
 of the working people of the Soviet Union speaks convincingly
 of the peaceful direction in the development of the Soviet
 economy.
 The working people of the Soviet Union, being engaged
 in peaceful and creative work, are interested in lasting peace.
 The Soviet Government, expressing the will of the whole
 of our people, does its utmost to prevent the unleashing of
 a new war, to prevent the prolonged bloodshed of millions
 of people, and to secure peaceful creation of happy life.
 The peoples of the world have won a very great victory
 in establishing for the first time in world history the mighty
 camp of peace, democracy and socialism.  This camp of
 peace-loving states includes now 800 million people.
 Our sacred obligation is to secure and strengthen the
 camp of peace, democracy and socialism, to reinforce the
 unity of the peoples in the struggle for peace, and to increase
 and rally the ranks of the fighters for peace.
 The alliance and friendship between the great peoples
 of the Chinese People's Republic and the Soviet Union are
 of outstanding significance in the struggle for world peace.
 J. V. Stalin, the standard-bearer of peace, taught us that
 "the great friendship between the Soviet Union and the
 Chinese People's Republic is the reliable guarantee against
 a threat of a new aggression and a powerful bulwark of
 peace in the Far East and all over the world."

 OPENING ADDRESS BY LIU NING-I (May 2, 1953)
 Delegates, Guests and Comrades:
 We now declare the opening of the Seventh All-China
 Congress of Trade Unions.
 This Congress is the first All-China Congress of Trade
 Unions of the Chinese working class convened after the
 victory of the people's democratic revolution in China and
 the founding of the People's Republic of China.  It is of
 immense significance in the historical development of the
 Chinese working-class movement.                      %
 Besides the trade union delegates from every part of .
 the country who are attending this Congress, representatives
 of the Central People's Government and various other
 quarters are present to guide our work.  There are also
 delegates from the railway workers in the Chinese People's
 Volunteers.
 We are especially happy and honoured to have with us
 the trade union delegates of many other countries.  We have
 among us the delegation, headed by Comrade Louis Saillant,
 from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the leading body
 of the world trade union movement-an organization which
 struggles for the unity and solidarity of the working class
 of the world and has striven unceasingly for and contributed
 greatly to the defence of world peace.  We have among us
 the trade union delegation from the Union of the Soviet
 Socialist Republics, the closest and greatest ally of the
 Chinese people, trade union delegates from the People's
 Democracies and the German Democratic Republic, and
 delegations from the various trade union organizations of
 many Asian and Australasian countries and France.  Hence

 our Congress not only demonstrates the triumphant unity
 of the Chinese working class, but also shows the great
 friendship and unity between the Chinese working class and
 the working class of the world. We whole-heartedly welcome
 the presence and guidance of the guests from home and
 abroad.  We warmly hail the successful opening of this
 united and impressive Congress!
 The Sixth All-China Labour Congress was held in Harbin
 in August 1948.  The great historic task of mobilizing the
 working class and rallying the people throughout the country
 to support the revolutionary war for the liberation of China,
 as set forth by that Congress, has been successfully accom-
 plished.
 '   Since the founding of the People's Republic of China,
 the great Chinese people and the Chinese working class under
 the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, with the fraternal and selfless help of our
 great ally, the Soviet Government and people, and with the
 trust, sympathy and support of the People's Democracies and
 the working class and people of the world, have done much
 in the sphere of gigantic economic restoration and achieved
 brilliant successes.  At the same time there were launched
 throughout the country the great Movement to Resist U.S.
 Aggression and Aid Korea, the agrarian reform movement,
 the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the San
 Fan movement (the movement against corruption, waste
 and bureaucracy in government establishments and social
 organizations), the Wu Fan movement (the movement against
 the bribery of government employees, tax evasion, theft of
 state property, cheating on government contracts and stealing
 economic  information  for  private  speculation  by  the
 law-breaking elements of the bourgeoisie) and democratic
 reforms in the enterprises. All these movements have
 effectively safeguarded and consolidated the most precious

 fruit of victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese
 people-the people's democratic dictatorship.
 We have, under difficult post-war conditions, not only
 restored production but also succeeded through a series of
 great efforts, in increasing labour productivity, raising the
 rate of utilization of equipment, promoting the extensive
 activities of inventors and innovators, studying advanced
 experiences, raising the quantity and quality of output, and
 reducing production costs, with the result that our industries
 and transport enterprises have rapidly reached and surpassed
 the highest pre-liberation levels.  We have created the
 necessary conditions for the planned economic construction
 of the country.  A new and great historical epoch of the
 Chinese people, the epoch of planned national economic con-
 struction, is now before us.  We hail the convocation of
 this Congress.   We welcome with boundless enthusiasm and
 confidence the beginning of the period of national economic
 construction, the new and great historic task of the Chinese
 working class.
 At this Congress, we shall sum up our experiences in
 trade union work since the Sixth All-China Labour Congress
 and especially during the period of national economic
 restoration after the founding of the People's Republic of
 China.  Moreover, on this basis and in accordance with the
 directive of the Communist Party of China, we shall map
 out the policy and define the tasks of the Chinese trade
 unions in the period of planned economic construction.
 This Congress will amend the Constitution of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions and will re-elect the
 national leading body of the trade unions of China, with
 the aim of strengthening the leadership of the trade unions
 throughout the whole country, to develop further the working-
 class movement, and to ensure the fulfilment and over-
 fulfilment of the tasks of national economic construction.

 Comrades!  The Chinese working-class movement, under
 the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung, after thirty years of bitter struggles,
 together with the entire Chinese people, and with the support
 of the great Soviet Union, the working class and all the
 progressive forces of the world, has finally achieved great
 victory in the people's revolution.
 The victory of the Chinese working class and the entire
 people is the victory in China of the teachings of Marx,
 Engels,  Lenin  and  Stalin.  Without  Marxism-Leninism,
 without the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung, there would have been no victory for the working class
 and the entire people of China.
 The great, glorious and consistently correct Communist
 Party of China is the guarantee of our victory.  The great
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the standard-bearer of victory of
 the Chinese working class and the entire people. This is a
 profound and at the same time simple truth, which has been
 well understood by the Chinese working class and the Chinese
 people from their own experience in their protracted struggles.
 If we are to consolidate the victory that we have already
 gained, and continue to march from victory to victory, we
 must then rally even more closely around the Communist.
 Party of China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung, and redoublf
 our efforts to study the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin
 and Stalin and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union
 in order to construct our country.
 The interests of the Chinese working class and people
 are completely identical with those of the working class and
 people of the world.
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as a member
 of the World Federation of Trade Unions and under its
 leadership, has played an active part in striving for the unity
 and solidarity of the international working-class movement,

 and in defence of peace in the Far East and all over the
 world.
 The Chinese workers, led by the Communist Party of
 China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung, are not only great patriots,
 but at the same time great internationalists.  In the struggle
 to continually consolidate their already gained victory and
 to strive for greater successes, the Chinese working class
 will further display to the full the spirit of patriotism
 combined with internationalism; unite with all the Chinese
 people to engage intensively in production and in the con-
 struction of our great Motherland.  At the same time it will
 strive with redoubled efforts for unity with the world working
 class, play a more active part in the world working-class
 movement, and struggle in defence of peace in the Far East
 and all over the world.
 The Chinese working class firmly believes that under
 the leadership of its own political party-the Communist
 Party of China-and its great leader Comrade Mao Tse-tung,
 with the close, lasting and solid alliance of our peasant
 brothers, with the unity of the people of all sections throughout
 the country, with the lasting and unbreakable friendship and
 co-operation with our great ally-the Soviet Union-and the
 People's Democracies, and with the friendship and unity
 between the Chinese people and all peace-loving peoples of
 the world who are fighting for a just cause, we shall be ever
 victorious.
 Long live the great Chinese people!
 Long live the great People's Republic of China!
 Long live the great Chinese working class!
 Long live the party of the Chinese working class, the
 great Communist Party of China!
 Long live the great leader of the Chinese working class
 and the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Tse-tung!

 REPORT ON THE TRADE UNION WORK IN CHINA
 Lai Jo-yu
 Delegates and Guests:
 Many events of great historic significance have taken
 place in our country since the Sixth All-China Labour
 Congress of August 1948.
 For over thirty years the Chinese working class, together
 with the Chinese people as a whole, have waged heroic
 struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party of
 China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the great leader of the
 Chinese  people,  and  succeeded  in  overthrowing  the
 reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic
 capitalism; liberating the mainland of China; and establishing
 the People's Republic of China, which is a people's democratic
 dictatorship, headed by the working class and based on the
 alliance of the workers and peasants.
 As Comrade Mao Tse-tung stated in his opening address
 at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political
 Consultative Conference:  "Our nation from now on will
 enter the great family of peace and freedom-loving nations
 of the world.  It will work bravely and industriously to
 create its own civilization and happiness and will, at the
 same time, promote world peace and freedom.  Our nation
 will never again be an insulted nation.  We have stood up."
 The victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a heavy blow
 to world imperialism, greatly inspired the labouring people
 of the world, particularly the labouring people in the colonial
 and dependent countries, and added a mighty force to the
 camp of peace, democracy and socialism.  This victory

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 changed the relative strength of the two camps in the present
 world situation.
 When the American imperialists launched their war of
 aggression against Korea and threatened the sacred borders
 of our great Motherland, the Chinese working class together
 with the entire Chinese people immediately responded to the
 call of Comrade Mao Tse-tung and enthusiastically joined
 the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, so as
 to safeguard peace in the Far East and the whole world.
 We stood for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.
 We supported the statements of Premier Chou En-lai, Prime
 Minister Kim I1 Sung and Foreign Minister Molotov, calling
 for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and will
 continue our persistent and determined struggle for its
 peaceful settlement and for the safeguarding of peace in the
 Far East and the whole world.
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of China,
 the Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people
 led by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao
 Tse-tung, have eliminated the remnant forces of the Kuo-
 mintang reactionaries and have carried out a series of social
 reforms.
 With the completion of the agrarian reform, the economic
 basis of feudalism has been thoroughly smashed, and the
 productive forces in our vast country-side have been set free.
 The completion of democratic reform in state-owned factories,
 mines and other enterprises, has destroyed the old system
 of management originally employed by the reactionary rulers
 for oppressing and exploiting the workers and established
 instead a system of democratic management.  The workers
 have become the real masters of the enterprises, and their
 activity and initiative have developed.  The successes gained
 in the San Fan and Wu Fan movements have smashed the
 ruthless attack waged by the law-breaking elements of the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 bourgeoisie against the working class and state organs, and
 have consolidated the leading position of state economy over
 private enterprises, and protected the legitimate rights of the
 workers in private enterprises.  Because of the development
 of the campaign to increase production and practise economy,
 the struggle of the working class to raise labour productivity
 and the quantity and quality of products, and to reduce
 production costs has surged to a new high.
 It is precisely because of these efforts that, within the
 short period of three years since the founding of the People's
 Republic of China, our country has completed its economic
 restoration, in spite of the fact that the struggle to resist U.S.
 aggression and aid Korea is being carried on.  Production
 in a majority of our industries has surpassed the highest
 levels of past years, prices throughout the country have been
 stabilized, and the financial situation has undergone a change
 for the better.  The material and cultural well-being of the
 working class and the people as a whole has steadily im-
 proved and the people's democratic dictatorship is daily being
 consolidated, thus creating the conditions for the nation's
 large-scale planned construction.
 Starting from this year, our great Motherland has
 embarked on the First Five-Year Plan of national construc-
 tion.
 The Chinese working class must unite more closely, con-
 solidate the alliance of the workers and peasants and rally
 the people of all strata to meet the new and historic task
 under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
 1.  The Main Developments in Trade Union Work in the
 Past Four Years
 Comrades, allow me to recall the main developments in
 trade union work in the past four years before I touch upon

 the fundamental tasks of our trade union work during the
 period of national construction.
 At the time of the Sixth All-China Labour Congress, the
 People's Liberation Army was winning victory after victory
 in its liberation march across the entire country.  The tidal
 wave of the people's revolution was sweeping throughout
 the land and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang clique
 backed by American imperialism was then on the verge of
 total collapse.
 At that time, the cardinal task of the Chinese working
 class was, first of all, to close its own ranks and then, by
 courageous struggle and in the spirit of self-sacrifice, to unite
 with the people of all strata to overthrow the reactionary
 rule of American imperialism and its lackey, the Kuomintang
 clique, and to establish the Chinese People's Republic.
 The message of greetings from the Central Committee
 of the Communist Party of China to the Sixth All-China
 Labour Congress pointed out:
 The task of the workers and office employees in the
 liberated areas is to restore and develop industry, to con-
 solidate the liberated areas and to give support to the
 front in accordance with the noted economic policy of
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, namely, "to develop production
 and bring about a prosperous economy through the poli-
 cies of taking into account both public and private in-
 terests, of benefiting both labour and capital."  The task
 of the workers and other employees in Kuomintang-ruled
 areas is to unite themselves as well as the entire people
 to fight against U.S. imperialism and bureaucratic capi-
 talism, to act in co-ordination, whenever necessary and
 possible, with the victorious offensive of the People's
 Liberation Army, and to assist the democratic govern-
 ment in the orderly taking-over of the liberated cities.
 In order to accomplish these ends, it is necessary to

 strengthen rapidly trade union work, to unite and educate
 the workers and other employees, so as to turn them
 into the leading force of the People's Democratic Re-
 public.
 After the Sixth All-China Labour Congress, a mighty
 battle was waged by the Chinese working class in accordance
 with the line laid down by the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China and the resolutions adopted by the
 Congress. In spite of extremely difficult conditions, the
 workers in the liberated areas gave their support to the War
 of Liberation by working selflessly to increase production.  In
 the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially in such cities as
 Shanghai, Kunming, Chungking and so on, the workers suc-
 ceeded in uniting the people of all strata, consolidated and
 extended the united front, and waged a fight against aggres-
 sion, persecution and hunger.  In the liberation of the various
 cities the workers gave battle heroically to protect factories,
 thus safeguarding the people's property.
 In the liberated cities, the trade unions helped the Peo-
 ple's Government to take over the enterprises owned by
 bureaucratic capital and then to carry out the necessary check-
 ing and accounting.  They helped to transform the property
 of bureaucratic capitalism into the property of the people and
 to change such enterprises into enterprises of a socialist
 nature.  Production was thus rapidly restored.  At the same
 time political education was carried out among the workers
 which strengthened their understanding of their position as
 masters of the country and gradually established among them
 a new attitude towards labour.
 The workers in private enterprises, in accordance with
 the policy "of developing production and benefiting both
 labour and capital," formed a united front with the national
 bourgeoisie, overcame difficulties, and succeeded in restor-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 ing production beneficial to the national welfare and people's
 livelihood.
 In order to meet the demands of the rapid development
 of the revolutionary situation, the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions convened a National Conference on Trade
 Union Work in July, 1949, at which the question of organiz-
 ing the workers on a nation-wide scale was discussed.  In
 November of the same year, the Chinese Association of
 Labour, which was affiliated to the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions as member organization, voluntarily pro-
 claimed its dissolution.  This further strengthened the unity
 of China's trade union organizations.
 In June, 1950, the Trade Union Law of the People's
 Republic of China was promulgated by the Central People's
 Government which granted extensive rights to and placed
 heavy responsibilities upon trade union organizations.
 Besides, the Communist Party of China sent many of its
 best members to participate in trade union work thereby
 greatly strengthening the activity of the trade unions.  Con-
 sequently, the working-class movement developed rapidly on
 a national scale. Today, the Chinese trade unions have
 become a mighty force entirely under the leadership of the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
 After we had taken over the factories and mines from
 the enemy, the basic demands of the workers and the urgent
 need of the state were first and foremost the restoration and
 development of production.  However, in these factories and
 mines bad elements and a vicious system which still remained
 were seriously hampering the growth and development of
 the labour enthusiasm of the masses.  This called for a
 movement of democratic reform to be carried out in the course
 of the restoration of production, so as to eliminate the bad
 elements and the vicious system that were oppressing the
 workers.  This movement which began in 1951 and developed

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 throughout the country was in the main completed on a
 national scale after the San Fan and Wu Fan movements.
 The democratic reform in the state-owned enterprises in
 Northeast China was completed earlier than in other areas as
 Northeast China had been liberated earlier.  Consequently,
 in 1951, a mass movement to increase production and practise
 economy, to develop productive potentialities, to popularize
 advanced experiences and to implement the system of business
 accounting, was launched throughout Northeast China, and
 greatly raised labour productivity.
 In other parts of the country, inspired by the Movement
 to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which was then
 everywhere on the upsurge, campaigns for patriotic pledges
 and labour emulation drives were developed extensively in
 co-ordination with the democratic reform, as a support for
 the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea.
 In October 1951, at the Third Session of the National
 Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference, Chairman Mao Tse-tung pointed out:
 On the industrial and agricultural fronts, the grow-
 ing patriotic movement to increase production has created
 a new atmosphere in our country, an atmosphere worthy
 of celebration.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung also issued a stirring call to
 the Chinese people to "increase production and practise
 economy in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers."
 Hence, the patriotic movement to increase production and
 practise economy spread swiftly and widely throughout the
 country.  Many model workers emerged from this movement
 and much advanced experience was gained.  Within the past
 three years, over 489,000 rationalization proposals put
 forward by the workers have been adopted, thus raising labour
 productivity and creating and saving a great deal of money
 for the state. Apart from the patriotic movement to increase

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 production and practise economy, a series of measures were
 taken to perfect production management.  At present, this
 work is still being carried on.
 The basic aim of these measures for production manage-
 ment in the state-owned enterprises is to introduce planned
 management, to fix individual responsibility in production and
 to implement the system of business accounting.
 This work must be co-ordinated with the labour emula-
 tion drives-the movement to increase production and prac-
 tise economy, which is being carried on throughout the
 country.
 In the last few years, our work has in the main followed
 the path mapped out by the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China and the resolutions of the Sixth All-
 China Labour Congress.  It should be pointed out, however,
 that the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions for a short period had committed mistakes of econo-
 mist and syndicalist tendencies.  These mistakes show them-
 selves in the following aspects.  In trade union work in
 state-owned enterprises, emphasis was laid on the so-called
 contradictions between public and private interests, rather
 than on the identity between workers' individual interests and
 the collective and long-term interests of the working class as
 a whole, while workers' welfare was placed as contradictory
 to the development of production.  In trade union work in
 private enterprises, one-sided emphasis was laid on labour-
 capital consultation while neglecting the class contradiction
 between workers and capitalists.   On the question of rela-
 tions between the trade unions and the Party, there was a
 tendency in the trade unions of departing from the leadership
 of the Party.  Further, in dealing with various concrete prob-
 lems, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions adopted
 subjective working methods which were out of touch with
 reality and the masses.  These deviations did not cause

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 serious damage, because they were quickly discovered and
 thoroughly corrected by the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  At the
 same time, trade unions in various localities, under the correct
 leadership of the local Communist Party organizations, did
 not accept much of the incorrect advice from the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions.  Therefore, we may be justified
 in saying that trade union work has played an important role
 during the process of the restoration of the national economy
 and has completed the tasks of the trade unions during this
 historical period.
 11. Basic Tasks of Our Trade Union Work in the Con-
 struction Period
 Comrades, our country has now entered a period of con-
 struction.
 As stated above, China is a people's democracy led by
 the working class and based on the alliance of the workers
 and peasants.  This very character of our state specifies that
 all the undertakings of our country, in their final analysis,
 are for raising and protecting the material and cultural well-
 being of the working class and the entire labouring people.
 The workers have been working as masters of the state in
 post-liberation China and have contributed to the restoration
 and development of the national economy, with the result that
 the material and cultural life of the working class and the
 entire labouring people has been markedly improved.  Fol-
 lowing further advances of our national economy, the welfare
 of the working class and the entire labouring people will
 assuredly be further promoted.  The developments in the
 short space of time after the liberation have amply proved
 that in a state led by the working class the individual interests
 of the workers and the interests of the state are identical.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 The immediate and sectional interests of the working
 class must be subordinated to the long-term and over-all in-
 terests of the state, that is, the interests of a state led by
 the working class.  Only by following this principle will the
 working-class movement have a correct direction and will
 the working class be assured of a bright future.  Conversely,
 if the long-term and over-all interests of the working class
 were sacrificed to its immediate and sectional interests, and
 economist mistakes were committed, then the trade unions
 would inevitably become narrow, scattered craft organiza-
 tions, and the working class would be unable to reach the
 glorious future of communism.
 Only when the masses of the workers really understand
 that their immediate and sectional interests must be sub-
 ordinated to long-term and over-all interests, and strive
 militantly for the glorious future, will the genuine advance-
 ment of their consciousness be manifested.  In order unceas-
 ingly to raise the level of the consciousness of the workers,
 the trade union cadres must, on the one hand, constantly pay
 attention to the well-being of the workers, and show them
 with living examples that the progress of history points to a
 bright future.  On the other hand, they must untiringly
 educate and influence the workers in the spirit of communism,
 and integrate this with the personal experience of the masses
 in order to raise the ideological level of the workers, to in-
 tegrate the individual interests of the workers with those of
 the state, and to integrate the working-class movement with
 the communist movement.
 Only the trade union organizations and the working-class
 movement led by the Communist Party can achieve these
 ends.
 The trade union organizations, therefore, must maintain
 close connections with the masses and rally the workers
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 around the Communist Party, serving as transmission belts
 between the Party and the masses.
 The trade unions should first of all unite with the broad
 masses of the workers in production, that is to say, they must,
 under the leadership of the Communist Party, rally millions
 of workers consciously and actively to take part in national
 construction.
 The working class, which has become the leading class
 of the state, not only shoulders the glorious task of fulfilling
 the industrial plan of the country, but also shoulders the
 heavy and important responsibility of helping to bring about
 the modernization of agricultural production.  The trade
 unions must educate and organize the workers to strive for
 the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the industrial plan of the
 country, and actively help the development of agricultural
 production, so as to consolidate the alliance of the workers and
 peasants. Only in this way will our socialist future be ensured.
 In the period of national construction, the most impor-
 tant and fundamental tasks of our trade unions are, under the
 leadership of the Communist Party of China, to maintain
 connections with and educate the workers, to raise con-
 tinuously their levels of consciousness and organization, to
 consolidate the alliance of the workers and peasants, to unite
 with the people of all strata and actively to fulfil the national
 plan of construction; then, on the basis of increased produc-
 tion, to improve step by step the material and cultural life
 of the working class and the entire labouring people, and to
 strive for the systematic realization of industrialization and
 the advancement towards socialism.
 111.  To  Organize  Mass  Labour  and  Develop  Labour
 Emulation
 As has been said before, the trade unions under the peo-
 ple's democratic dictatorship are no longer the organizations
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 of the oppressed and governed class, but the mass organiza-
 tions of the leading class which now holds political power.
 The most important task of the trade unions is to unite
 and lead all workers, technical personnel and other employees
 so that they may consciously and actively develop production.
 For it is only through the development of production and the
 strengthening of our economic power that we can change
 the economic backwardness of our nation and gradually
 realize industrialization and advance towards a socialist
 society.  It is only through the development of production
 that we can continually improve the material and cultural life
 of the working class and the entire people.
 The fundamental method of the trade unions in develop-
 ing production is to lead the masses step by step to take part
 in labour emulation, and, through the emulation drives, to
 develop to the highest degree the activity and creative initia-
 tive of the workers, technical personnel, and other employees;
 to improve labour organization, production processes, equip-
 ment and methods of operating machinery, and thus to raise
 labour productivity.
 Labour emulation is an effective way of mobilizing the
 broad masses to achieve the targets of the state plan; it is
 the socialist and communist method of construction based on
 the highly developed consciousness of millions of people.
 As Comrade Stalin put it:
 The most remarkable feature of emulation is the
 radical revolution it brings with it in men's views of
 labour, for it transforms labour from a degrading and
 painful burden, as it was regarded before, into a matter
 of honour, a matter of glory, of valour and heroism.
 Among us workers, labour emulation has undergone
 several stages in its development in our country.  In the
 earlier period after the liberation, although the enthusiasm of
 the workers was very high, the various reforms in the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 enterprises had not yet been carried out; consequently the
 main feature of the emulation drives at that time was the
 increase of labour intensity.  Shock tactics were widespread
 and frequently insufficient attention was paid to the quality
 of production and to labour protection.  Such a phenomenon
 was generally unavoidable at that time.  Viewed as a whole,
 labour emulation in those early days did, however, greatly
 stimulate production, although such emulation could not
 continue for long.
 After the carrying out of democratic reform in the enter-
 prises and the laying down of preliminary plans and norms
 of production, the emulation movement became a regular
 form of labour.
 The main features of normal labour emulation are to
 emphasize the integration of labour and technique, the
 popularization of advanced experiences, the development of
 productive potentialities, the raising of labour productivity,
 the raising of output and quality, and to emphasize the im-
 portance of labour protection and technical safety.
 The general process of development of labour emulation
 is from shock work to regular methods of work, from a low
 to a high level.  It is the process of continuously raising
 the ideological consciousness and technical level of the
 masses, and is also the process of raising the backward
 elements in production to the level of the advanced.
 At present many defects still exist in labour emulation.
 The main defects are as follows:
 Firstly, in some factories and mines there is a tendency
 to be satisfied with the fulfilment of production plans "in
 general" or "in the main," to be satisfied with the fulfilment
 of the total amount of output, while neglecting to fulfil all
 targets of the plans, neglecting quality, and neglecting
 safety.  Such emulation cannot be expected to fulfil the state
 production plans and can even cause serious wastage of
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 state property.  Further, ups and downs in production and
 failure to fulfil production plans in a balanced way are also
 shortcomings most common in the emulation drives.
 Secondly, in some factories and mines emulation drives
 are confined to issuing calls of a general character without
 seriously mobilizing the masses to discuss production plans,
 and to study and map out conditions of emulation.  As a
 result, while emulation drives in these enterprises may be
 very showy in form, they are not very effective in developing
 production.
 As to the labour emulation drive in these factories and
 mines, there is no examination of work, or summing up of
 experiences from the leadership.  In extending advanced
 experiences,  insufficient consideration  is  paid  to  their
 integration with the concrete situation of the enterprises,
 but, instead, a mechanical  and formalist  approach        in
 popularizing advanced experiences is adopted.  There are
 even cases where there is failure to give leadership, and the
 campaign is allowed to drift along by itself. Consequently
 the enthusiasm of the masses is dampened.
 Thirdly, trade unions in some enterprises do not organize
 the workers to put forward rationalization proposals around
 the key problems in production and the technical and
 organizational measures of the managements, but blindly
 call on the workers, technical personnel and other employees
 for proposals. . Consequently, there may be a lot of proposals,
 but the main problems in production are not solved, and the
 initiative and. creativeness of the masses not effectively
 developed.
 Fourthly, in many factories and mines no serious effort
 has been made to organize the technical and management
 personnel to join the emulation drives, with the result that
 technical leadership from the management departments lags
 far behind the enthusiasm of the masses.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Fifthly, while organizing emulation, many factories and
 mines fail to seriously carry out penetrating and thorough
 political work.  Arbitrary methods are frequently applied
 to deal with workers who are comparatively backward, while
 there are even shameful cases of submitting falsified reports
 to the leadership, in an attempt to win honour by deceit.
 The weakness in political work which furnished a hotbed of
 bourgeois ideology to some workers and staff members has
 hampered the normal development of emulation.
 What then is the correct way of organizing emulation?
 In the light of practical experiences of the last few
 years, attention should be paid to the following points in
 organizing labour emulation:
 1.  We must begin by mobilizing the workers, technical
 personnel and other employees to take part in discussions
 of state production plans.  Our discussions must centre
 around the realization of these plans.  We must increase
 the rate of utilization of equipment, economize on the use
 of raw materials, and develop the productive potentialities
 of the enterprises through improving labour organization,
 production processes and instruments of production.  We
 must map out our advanced production, technical and
 financial plans on the basis of practical possibilities for
 increased output, improved quality and reduced production
 costs.  We must map out, in accordance with the over-all
 plan, the concrete conditions-conditions of emulation-for
 each workshop, each team and each individual to ensure their
 fulfilment and to strive for their over-fulfilment.  Without
 production plan there can be no real content in any emulation
 drive, which would definitely remain in form only.
 After the plans have been mapped out we should
 encourage the masses to put forward rationalization proposals
 and solutions related to the key problems of production
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 around the various technical measures adopted by the man-
 agements with the aim of ensuring fulfilment of the plans.
 During the discussions we must enable the broad masses
 of workers to understand fully the great significance of the
 state production plan for our national development and the
 well-being of the people, to understand concretely what is
 required of their enterprises by the economic development
 of our country, and enable everyone to realize the importance
 of drawing up advanced production and financial plans and
 advanced production norms, and of improving the manage-
 ment of their enterprises.
 This is in fact drawing the broad masses into studying
 and participating in the management of the enterprises,
 which is also a most practical lesson in communism.  Only
 then will the actions of the masses for the fulfilment of the
 production plan become their conscious actions.
 Conscious labour discipline is founded on such a basis.
 This kind of conscious labour discipline and communist
 attitude towards labour is the surest guarantee of the
 fulfilment of the state plan.
 2.  One of the important conditions for the correct
 leadership of labour emulation lies in the timely discovery
 and practical support of all that is new and advanced, the
 study, summing  up  and  popularization  of  advanced
 experiences, especially those of the Soviet Union, the raising
 of technical levels and occupational capacities of the workers,
 technical personnel and other employees, and the thorough
 implementation and constant improvement of technological
 process.
 In extending advanced experiences, encouragement and
 support  should  be  given to  innovations  of  advanced
 production workers and model workers; we should help them
 to overcome all kinds of difficulties and resistance in order
 to educate the backward workers with their example and
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 thus to raise, step by step, the level of the backward workers
 to that of the advanced.
 "In the struggle between the new and the old, between
 the advanced and the backward, the important thing is not
 only to perceive the forces that are recreating the new social
 system, but also constantly to rear these forces, to see
 that they are developed to the utmost, tirelessly to organize
 and improve them in order to ensure our further forward
 movement." (Malenkov)
 3.  The holding of meetings to discuss problems in
 production is the best form of mass organization for the
 development of emulation drives, the popularization of
 advanced experiences and the improvement of management
 of the enterprises.  At present, in the course of introducing
 reforms in production management, many enterprises are
 holding various kinds of production meetings to bring out
 the views of the masses and thus to solve all types of problems
 in production.
 It is necessary to set up the system of holding such
 meetings of a mass character regularly and turn them into
 mighty weapons for organizing the masses for production.
 Such production meetings have played, and are still playing,
 an important role in the Soviet trade union movement. They
 are the best way to develop the enthusiasm and creativeness
 of the masses of workers.
 We should learn from Soviet experiences to establish
 the system of holding regular production meetings, taking
 into consideration the experiences already gathered in various
 factories and mines.
 After  the  systems  for  planned  management  and
 production norms have been initially completed in factories
 and mines, production meetings for teams and workshops,
 joint production meetings between different teams and work-
 shops, production meetings concerned with specialized trades,
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 and representative production meetings of whole factories,
 should be organized in a planned way.
 All these meetings should discuss production plans,
 assist the managements of enterprises to overcome all sorts
 of difficulties and develop criticism and self-criticism in order
 to wipe out defects in production management.
 4.  The signing of collective agreements has a significant
 bearing on the clarifying of emulation targets and assurance
 of the 'fulfilment of the state plan, on the systematic
 improvement of the material and cultural life of the workers,
 and also on the raising of labour enthusiasm.  By means
 of collective agreements, individual and state interests in
 state-owned enterprises can be closely and concretely linked
 up.  Therefore collective agreements should be signed in
 good time in the various enterprises.
 Collective agreements should include production plans
 and set out the obligations of the managements and trade
 unions towards each other during the course of production
 and in the completion of production plans.  Contents of
 the agreements should be extensively discussed by the masses
 in connection with the production plans, so that they may
 become the programme of conscious action on the part of
 the masses.
 After the preliminary completion of a new system of
 management and the authorization of definite production
 plans and production norms, collective agreements may be
 concluded.  Their contents may vary in accordance with the
 different concrete conditions of the various factories and
 mines, from simple outlines to minute details, from being
 incomplete to complete, and should be constantly sub-
 stantiated and improved.  At the same time joint agreements
 may be concluded between  individual  workshops,  and
 between the major production departments and auxiliary
 production departments in order to keep a. balance in

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 production and to ensure the realization of the collective
 agreements.
 IV.  Gradually to Raise and Improve the Material and
 Cultural Life of the. Workers, Technical Personnel and
 Other Employees on the Basis of Developing Production
 Under the care of the great leader of the Chinese
 people, Comrade Mao Tse-tung, and the Central People's
 Government, outstanding improvements have been made in
 the material and cultural life of the broad masses of the
 workers following the  restoration  and, development  of
 production.
 In state-owned enterprises, the unreasonable   wage
 system left over from Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalism
 has been basically removed.  In a majority of enterprises,
 a reasonable system of grading wages has been put into
 effect and wage standards raised year after year.  The wages
 of workers and other employees in state-owned enterprises
 in 1952 were 60% to 120% higher than the 1949 levels.  In
 private enterprises, wage levels and the wage system have
 also been improved.
 At the same time the improvements in the living
 conditions of the workers are seen not only in higher wage
 levels.  The stabilization of commodity prices and the
 initiation of various social welfare activities and other
 undertakings to promote the well-being of the workers are
 all important factors in improving the lives of the workers.
 These factors are increasing day by day.
 In Northeast China, which was liberated earlier than
 other parts of China, labour insurance was introduced in
 1949.  In 1951, the Central People's Government promulgated
 the Labour Insurance Regulations which have been carried
 out throughout the country in all public and private enter-
 prises employing 100 or more workers.  In many enter-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 prises with less than 100 workers, labour insurance contracts
 have been concluded.  Labour insurance in our country is
 entirely financed by the managements or owners of enter-
 prises.  The amount expended by the state in 1952 alone
 for labour insurance was more than 1,600,000 million yuan
 (approximately #23,000,000).
 The state is also continuously improving working con-
 ditions of the workers in factories and mines.  Various
 safety and sanitation measures for workers have been
 adopted.  In 1952, in Northeast China alone, the state ap-
 propriated 1,283,000 million yuan (approximately #18,600,-
 000) for the improvement of working conditions of the
 workers.  Regulations and systems relating to safety and
 sanitation have been established in the main and are being
 gradually put into effect.  It is particularly noteworthy that
 many general inspections and inspections at specific points
 on the safety and sanitation conditions have been carried
 out in various regions and cities.  These inspections have
 given practical education in industrial safety to the cadres
 and the masses and have inspired the mass movement for
 industrial safety.  In this way great improvements in the
 conditions of safety and sanitation have been brought about
 in the state-owned factories and mines, resulting in a yearly
 decline in the rate of injury, disease and mortality among
 the workers.  In private enterprises, as a result of the
 leadership of the People's Government and the supervision of
 the trade union organizations, notable progress has also
 been made in safety and sanitation conditions.
 There are now more than 3,000 workers' sanatoria, rest
 homes, creches, overnight rest homes, homes for the aged,
 and other collective welfare undertakings, established either
 by direct state investment or out of the appropriations from
 the directors' funds and labour insurance funds.

 People's governments and trade union organizations at
 all levels are using every means to improve the housing
 conditions of the workers, and in many cities living quarters
 for workers have been built.  In 1952 alone, the state ap-
 propriated 2,860,000 million yuan (about #41,600,000) to
 build living quarters for one million workers.
 The continuous improvement of the material and cultural
 well-being of the working class has greatly heightened its
 enthusiasm for production and has strongly developed the
 movement for labour emulation.
 The trade union organizations must consistently pay
 attention to making all possible improvements in the material
 and cultural well-being of the workers.  As pointed out by
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, it is necessary to improve step by
 step the workers' livelihood on the basis of increased pro-
 duction.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung also taught us:
 At the same time as we increase production and
 practise economy, attention must be paid to safety,
 health, and the indispensable amenities of the workers
 and other employees.  It is completely wrong to take
 note only of the first aspect while forgetting or even
 slightly neglecting the second aspect.
 Experience proves that it is only when the masses of
 the workers have been first mobilized for the fulfilment of
 the state production plan, for accumulation of capital in
 enterprises, and for increasing the wealth of the state to
 extend re-production, is it possible to improve their material
 and cultural well-being.  Divorced from production, any
 talk of welfare is empty and erroneous, for no one can possibly
 enjoy what has not yet been produced.
 Our country must first invest a huge amount of capital
 in capital construction and industrialization which aims at
 extending production.  Although the material and cultural
 well-being of the workers is raised year by year, there will
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 inevitably be problems which cannot be completely solved
 for the time being.  We must clearly explain to the workers
 what problems relating to their daily living can be solved
 and to what extent, what problems cannot be solved and
 to what extent, and what can and will be completely solved
 in the future when production is highly developed.
 Some trade union officials fail to really understand
 these facts, or fail to adopt a serious and responsible attitude
 in dealing with these problems, with the result that there
 are now two erroneous deviations:
 Firstly, an economist tendency.
 In the matter of welfare and living conditions of the
 workers account is not taken of the actual possibilities and
 needs.  In dealing with wage problems, an equalitarian
 outlook is adopted in contravention of the principle of "to
 each according to his work."  In carrying out labour
 insurance, some trade union workers are over-ambitious, and
 show blind adventurism out of proportion to the practical
 requirements of the masses.  Sometimes they make un-
 reasonable stipulations in relation to the disbursement of
 labour insurance funds.  Notwithstanding that a large labour
 insurance fund has been accumulated, they still place
 excessive demands on the management of enterprises, thus.
 not only increasing the expenditure of the state but also
 alienating the trade union organizations from the masses.
 In the field of cultural and educational work, the policy of
 serving production has not been clearly understood.
 The prolonged and persistent existence of this erroneous
 economist tendency is primarily due to an apolitical tendency
 in trade union work.  The political and ideological leadership
 of many trade union organizations is weak, failing to carry
 out consistent and practical communist education among
 the workers.  Once there is a deviation from communist

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 ideology, the working-class movement will inevitably move
 towards economism.
 Secondly, a bureaucratic method of work which cares
 little about the hardships in the lives of the workers.
 At places where trade union organizations are led by
 bureaucratic elements, a number of reasonable and urgent
 demands of the workers, many of which can be satisfied or
 even can easily be solved, are not solved or not solved in
 time. On the question of living quarters for workers, there
 has been a lot of empty talk about socialist standards instead
 of trying to meet the actual existing situation by adopting
 simpler and cheaper methods to provide more houses for
 the workers.  On the other hand, some of the so-called cheap
 houses are completely shoddy jobs, which are a waste of
 state property and cannot solve any practical problem.  On
 the question of medical service, some enterprises hoard
 medical funds and fail to provide obtainable medical equip-
 ment and the trade unions fail to exercise necessary
 supervision.  On the question of wages, some trade unions
 do not seriously study those unjust wage systems which can
 and should be readjusted, and do not make suggestions and
 help the managements of enterprises to deal with them.  On
 the question of workers' cultural life, they ignore the rising
 demands of the workers for culture and recreation, and do
 not develop the cultural and recreational activities of the
 masses in accordance with actual possibilities.
 This kind of bureaucratic method of work which shows
 indifference to the hardships of the workers is utterly wrong
 and must be resolutely opposed.  It should not be allowed
 to continue under the pretext of combating economist
 tendency.
 In improving the material and cultural well-being of
 the workers, the following points should be observed:

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 1.  It is necessary to carry out in production the line
 of industrial safety and improvement of working conditions
 and to pay attention to solving specific problems with regard
 to women workers and apprentices.
 2.  In setting up collective welfare establishments,
 consideration should be given to actual needs and possi-
 bilities.                                         Blind adventurism, over-ambitiousness and im-
 practical approaches should be avoided.
 3.  Trade union organizations must study the wage
 policy of the Party and the Government, give assistance to
 the management or owners of enterprises to improve further
 the wage system,  gradually and reasonably formulate
 technical standards and fix definite production norms, carry
 out the wage principle of "to each according to his work,"
 and help the managements of the enterprises in a planned
 way to introduce the piece-rate wage system, and the bonus
 system for workers receiving time wages.
 V.  To  Carry Out Systematic  Political, Technical  and
 General Education Among Workers
 In the past few years the trade unions have consistently
 educated the broad masses of the workers in the spirit of
 patriotism and internationalism. Particularly during the
 last year, many trade union organizations have, in a
 comparatively  systematic  way, carried  out  communist
 education among the workers and have repeatedly explained
 the identity of individual and state interests, thus establishing
 among them a correct attitude towards labour and a
 strengthened labour discipline based on their consciousness
 and understanding of being masters of the state.
 With the development of production, the requirements
 of workers for general and technical education are also
 growing.  Much work has been done by trade unions in
 organizing workers to take part in general educational and
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 technical studies.  They have assisted the managements of
 the enterprises in establishing 16,277 spare-time schools, at
 which 3,087,000 workers have studied and 535,000 illiterate
 workers have learnt to read and write.  They have also
 assisted the managements in establishing various spare-time
 classes for technical studies and technical research societies.
 All these are for the purpose of promoting technical education
 among  the  workers.  Workers  studying   in  spare-time
 technical classes number 477,000 while the number of
 workers studying full-time in technical schools amounts to
 56,000. Numerous books, newspapers and periodicals are
 published for the benefit of the workers.  The Workers'
 Publishing Press alone, operated by the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions, published 339 different kinds of books and
 periodicals amounting to over 35,574,000 copies during the
 period From September 1949 to March 1953.
 With the support of the People's Government, the trade
 union organizations in various localities have established
 clubs and cultural palaces for the education and cultural
 and sport activities of the workers.  Various spare-time
 cultural activities of a mass character are developed to
 enrich and improve their cultural life.
 However, propaganda and education in the trade unions
 as such are still fairly weak, and have not met with the
 workers' cultural and technical requirements.  Systematic
 political and ideological education and consistent education
 on current affairs and policies in particular leave much to
 be desired.  There are also tendencies of over-ambitiousness
 and blind adventurism in carrying out general education
 among the workers.  Some trade union workers like to set
 up large-scale cultural palaces, while neglecting small clubs
 and "Red Corners" which can be easily established.  In
 some places, the campaign to- wipe out illiteracy has not

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 proceeded steadily, but is carried out in an impetuous way.
 Consequently, the results are not consolidated.
 So, henceforth we must carry out the following tasks:
 Firstly, we must intensify communist education and
 current affairs and policy studies among the workers and
 continuously raise the level of consciousness of the working
 class.  The composition of the working class is complicated,
 and bourgeois ideology is continuously infiltrating into our
 midst.  Along with the development of industry, large
 numbers of small producers and elements from other classes
 will constantly flow into the ranks of the working class, and
 it is only natural that the small producers' traditional
 indiscipline, narrowness, selfishness and guild inclinations
 will have strong influence upon the working class.  There-
 fore, it is necessary to carry out unceasingly among the
 working class education in Marxism-Leninism and the
 teaching  of  Comrade  Mao  Tse-tung * on  the     Chinese
 revolution, and to raise continuously their class conscious-
 ness in order to consolidate the leading position of the
 working class and ensure the fulfilment of the production
 plans of the state.
 Secondly, we must follow the directions of Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung to mobilize the workers, technical personnel
 and other employees to learn from the Soviet Union.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung has instructed us:
 We are going to carry out our great national
 construction.  The work facing us is hard and we do
 not have enough experience.  So we must seriously
 study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
 Whether inside or outside the Communist Party, old or
 new cadres,    technicians,  intellectuals,  workers  or
 peasants, we must all learn whole-heartedly from the
 Soviet Union.  We must learn not only the theories of
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin but also the advanced

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 scientific techniques of the Soviet Union.  There must
 be a great nation-wide upsurge of learning from the
 Soviet Union to build our country.
 Thirdly, we must carry out technical and general
 education, eliminate illiteracy in a planned and systematic
 way, and raise the cultural level of the workers so as to
 enable them to master more advanced and complicated
 technique. It is also necessary to raise the skill of the
 workers, to carry on education in technical theory among
 skilled workers, and methodically to develop technical and
 administrative personnel from the workers.
 Fourthly, trade union organizations should make full
 use of clubs and cultural palaces as places for mass education,
 develop sport activities and link the political, technical and
 cultural education of the workers with their demands for
 proper entertainment and rest.
 V1.  Thoroughly to Carry Out the Policy of Developing
 Production and of Benefiting Both Labour and Capital;
 Successfully to Carry Out Trade Union Work in
 Private Enterprises
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung in his work On New Democracy
 has pointed out:
 The state economy in a new-democratic republic
 under the leadership of the proletariat is of a socialist
 nature.  It is the leading force of the entire national
 economy.  But this people's republic does not confiscate
 private capitalist properties nor does it forbid the
 development of capitalist production which does not
 exercise dominant influence over the people's livelihood.
 This is due to the fact that China's economy is still
 very backward.
 In view of this situation, the policy of "developing
 production and bringing about a prosperous economy through
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 the policies of taking into account both public and private
 interests and of benefiting both labour and capital" was
 formulated.
 In the early period following the liberation, the working
 class, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China,
 correctly carried out the policy of forming a united front
 with the national bourgeoisie and assisted the latter in over-
 coming difficulties, thereby contributing to the restoration
 and development of production.
 Later, however, a few law-breaking elements of the
 bourgeoisie did a lot of evils which violated state laws and
 decrees and were extremely harmful to the national welfare
 and the people's livelihood.
 In 1952, the Chinese working class, together with the
 entire people, led by the Central People's Government, con-
 ducted the Wu Fan movement against bribery, tax evasion,
 theft of state property, cheating on government contracts and
 stealing economic information for private speculation. They
 defeated the frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie, consolidated
 the financial and economic discipline of the state and the
 leading position of the working class, thereby keeping the
 private enterprises within the bounds stipulated by the Com-
 mon Programme.
 In co-ordination with, and after the Wu Fan movement,
 democratic reforms and certain reforms in business manage-
 ment were carried out in many private factories, mines and
 enterprises, resulting in a new situation in industry.
 In some enterprises, however, business remains slack due
 to bad management; a handful of law-breaking capitalists
 have even transferred their capital, locked out workers, stop-
 ped food-supplies, detained payment of wages, and adopted
 a hostile attitude towards the workers.  At the same time,
 in certain other enterprises, the workers have only a one-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 sided  understanding of  welfare.  Consequently,  labour-
 capital relations in some districts and trades are not normal.
 The trade union organizations in private enterprises
 must also regard as their central task the successful develop-
 ment of production.  Development of production represents
 the highest interest of the working class because the latter
 has become the leading class of the state.  Trade union
 organizations should improve business management and
 successfully develop production, by means of labour-capital
 consultative conferences and the signing of labour-capital
 contracts; then, on this basis, solve as far as possible and
 necessary all questions relating to the welfare of the workers.
 We must carry out mass supervision over, and necessary
 struggles against, the various illegal activities of the capital-
 ists, such as violation of state laws and policy, oppression
 of workers and disruption of unity among the workers.  The
 trade unions in private enterprises should carry out constant
 education among the workers, constantly maintain the
 political vigilance of the working class and retain the purity
 of the leading organs of the trade unions.  At the same time,
 the trade unions and the workers must have a correct grasp
 of state laws and policy and must observe correct policies
 and methods of work.
 Vill.  To Strengthen the Building of Trade Unions
 At present, the trade union organizations in our country
 are completely unified, headed by the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions.  The Federation consists of 23 industrial
 unions (of which ten have national committees, eight have
 working committees and five have preparatory committees),
 180,000 basic organizations, with a total membership of
 10,200,000.
 Throughout the country, the workers have been in the
 main organized, while their family members are also
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 beginning to become organized.  There are now 223,000
 model workers and advanced production workers in our
 country.
 In the last few years, schools for trade union cadres
 alone have trained 111,000 cadres. The trade unions have
 recommended 107,000 members as cadres to the Communist
 Party and the People's Government. About 124,000 workers
 have been promoted to technical and administrative positions,
 including 7,800 factory directors and deputy directors.
 The trade union organizations in our country have
 become powerful transmission belts between the Communist
 Party and the broad masses of the workers.  They are a
 strong social pillar of the People's Democratic Dictatorship.
 Naturally, taking our trade union work as a whole,
 many problems still exist in regard to ideological and
 organizational developments.  It is necessary to carry out
 systematic and penetrating ideological work to overcome
 the influences of various non-proletarian ideologies, so that
 the working class whose ranks are growing rapidly and
 trade union workers can unite as one and devote their
 efforts to the great cause of industrializing our country.  It
 is necessary to study further the concrete tasks of trade
 unions in the period of national construction.
 At present the organizational structure cannot meet the
 demands of the construction period, and must be streng-
 thened.  In a number of basic organizations, no regular
 order of work has been established, and democratic life is
 not very sound; many committees and groups exist only
 on paper; criticism and self-criticism are not developed;
 absence from work without due reasons and violations of
 labour discipline have not been opposed or met with
 punishment; no serious work has been carried out among
 technical personnel and office employees.  All this must be
 seriously dealt with.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 On the question of establishing industrial unions, there
 has been a tendency towards blind ambitiousness.  Too
 many industrial unions were set up hurriedly.  And when
 this mistake was criticized, some cadres tended to neglect the
 importance of industrial unions.  We have not seriously
 studied, summed up and learnt from the experiences of trade
 union work at the capital construction sites and newly
 established  enterprises,  and the work of training and
 educating new workers, which is of extreme importance in
 the construction period and in which we are inexperienced;
 not enough attention has been paid to educating activists
 on a large scale and in a planned way.  The ideologicai
 level and competence of trade union workers must be raised.
 In order to shoulder our great and difficult historical tasks,
 the trade unions must strengthen their ideological and
 organizational developments, and continuously raise the
 level of consciousness and organization of the workers.
 How shall we strengthen the work of building up trade
 unions?
 According to the experiences gained in the last few
 years and the actual needs at present, we must observe the
 following points in building up trade unions during the
 period of national construction:
 Firstly, we should keep close contact with the masses
 and bring about a sound democratic life under proper leader-
 ship.  Close contact with the masses is the most important
 and fundamental condition for the successful completion of
 trade union work.  Any tendency to deviate from the masses
 is extremely dangerous.  Trade union organizations must
 fully develop democracy, criticism and self-criticism, and
 carry out self-education; only in this way will they closely
 link themselves with the broad masses of the workers,
 develop their creative initiative and strengthen their organ-
 izationand'discipline on the basis of their consciousness.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Trade union workers must clearly understand these
 points and also, in practice, go deep among the masses,
 listen to their opinions, understand their way of thinking,
 their moods and their demands, and satisfy their demands in
 accordance with practical needs and possibilities. As to those
 suggestions and demands raised by the workers which cannot
 be solved for the time being or which are incorrect, it is
 necessary to convince and educate the masses with patience,
 and no arbitrary or ruthless method should be adopted to
 deny these suggestions or demands.  At the same timek it
 is necessary to establish definite democratic systems and to
 establish a sound system of group meetings in the trade
 unions, to give regular reports on the work and the financial
 condition of the trade unions in order to place the entire
 trade union work under the close supervision of the masses
 and to overcome bureaucracy and commandism.
 Secondly, we must strengthen our work at the capital
 construction sites, in the newly established factories and
 mines and among new workers.
 Where capital  construction  is  in progress, special
 attention  should  be  paid  to intensifying the political
 education of the workers, to ensuring precision in surveying
 and designing, to improving labour organization and work-
 ing methods so as to achieve speed, quality and economy.
 We must assist the management in preparing the
 establishment of new factories and mines and in the training
 of technical workers, to ensure the opening and production
 of new factories and mines according to schedule.  We must
 intensify ideological education during the course of the
 experimental production of new products to ensure their
 standard of quality.
 We must carry out education in technical safety and
 labour discipline among the new workers and constantly
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 help them to solve their difficulties in questions of technique
 and daily life.
 Thirdly, we must put the work in the basic trade union
 organizations on a sound basis.  Trade union cadres must
 clearly understand the direction to squarely "face production,
 face the basic organizations, face the masses," study economic
 and production knowledge, go down to the workshops and
 production teams, find out the crucial problems in production,
 thoroughly carry out the policy of reward and commendation,
 educate activists, mobilize all the workers, eliminate con-
 servative ideologies and consolidate labour discipline, in
 order to ensure the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of produc-
 tion plans, and at the same time, show close concern over
 the material and cultural life of the workers.
 In strengthening the work of the basic organizations, it
 is necessary to devote attention to work among the technical
 personnel and office employees, particularly to work among
 the technicians.
 Since the liberation, as a result of the work of the Com-
 munist Party of China and various mass movements, great
 changes have taken place among technical personnel.  Large
 numbers of workers have been promoted technicians and a
 large proportion of the technical personnel now consists of
 young technicians who have accepted the new ideology. The
 majority of the old-type technical personnel, having learnt
 practical lessons through the various political movements
 and social reforms, have also undergone important changes
 in their ideology.  We should go one step further to co-
 operate whole-heartedly, sincerely and patiently with the
 .technical personnel in order to bring about closer co-
 ordination of technique and labour, enabling the technical
 personnel to make greater contributions to the cause of
 national construction.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 In order to bring success to the above-mentioned work
 in the basic organizations, it is necessary, under the leader-
 ship of the Communist Party of China and, in close co-
 operation with the managements and the Youth League, to
 strengthen organization and planning in this work in order
 to establish a normal order of work and to map out reason-
 able schedules for spare-time activities.  Above all, it is
 necessary for everyone to study seriously and popularize
 the experience of the Wu San Factory.
 Fourthly, we must strengthen the industrial unions in a
 planned and systematic way.  Only through this can we
 improve our co-ordination with the management in thorough-
 ly studying problems in production, summing up experiences,
 organizing mass production work, and, in accordance with
 the special features of the industry, concretely solve the
 question of labour protection and the welfare of the workers.
 Of course, in strengthening the industrial unions today,
 it is still necessary to proceed step by step, taking into
 consideration specific points of emphasis in national con-
 struction, the development and practical needs of the various
 industries.
 At the same time, acting on the above-mentioned prin-
 ciples, trade unions in different localities should also take
 into consideration the conditions of the various industries in
 the locality in deciding upon points of emphasis.
 The strengthening of industrial unions does not mean a
 denial of the role of the local trade unions.  As the industrial
 unions cannot be all established and consolidated within a
 short period, especially as dispersed handicraft industries
 exist and will continue to exist on a large scale for a long
 time, and because it is impossible to establish industrial
 unions for these handicraft trades, the local trade unions will
 continue to play an important role and should not be
 weakened.  The strengthening of industrial  unions will

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 strengthen the leadership of the local trade unions in pro-
 duction and over the scattered basic organizations in factories
 and mines, and over the handicraft undertakings.
 Trade unions in small cities and towns should pay full
 attention to the characteristics of the handicraft workers in
 various trades and regions.  We must not apply mechani-
 cally the forms of organization, working methods and targets
 used among industrial workers to the handicraft workers.
 We must not confuse the relations between labour and capital
 with the handicraft employment relations (the relations of a
 mutual-aid character between workers and the independent
 producers who employ workers because of necessity in pro-
 duction) and the relations between the craftsman and his
 apprentices.
 Fifthly, we must develop and train a large number of
 trade union activists.  At present, the leading organs of the
 trade union organizations at all levels still lack the necessary
 number of cadres who have close contact with the masses
 and who are equipped with knowledge of production.  This
 hinders the deeper development of trade union work.
 As further progress is made in our national construc-
 tion, this situation will become even more serious.                             There-
 fore all trade union organizations should bring to the fore-
 front the question of education and training, in a planned
 way, of activists and cadres.  They should also intensify the
 education of cadres at work, and raise their ideological level
 and occupational capacities.  Thus the trade union or-
 ganizations will be improved and strengthened.
 VIII.  To Fight for Unity and Solidarity of the International
 Working Class and for a Lasting World Peace
 The victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese
 people, and their great achievements in economic restoration
 are inseparable from the assistance of the working class and

 other labouring people of the world, particularly the selfless
 assistance of the Soviet working class, the Soviet people and
 the Soviet Government. Assistance from the working class
 of various countries, particularly from the Soviet Union, will
 continue to be an important condition for success in our
 construction.
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is a loyal
 member of the World Federation of Trade Unions.  It
 earnestly carries out the resolutions of the WFTU, regards the
 struggle to develop and consolidate the unity and solidarity
 of the international working class as its great and important
 international task.
 In November 1949, the World Federation of Trade
 Unions convened the Asian and Australasian Trade Union
 Conference in Peking.  The Conference summed up the ex-
 periences of the struggles of the working class in Asian and
 Australasian countries, and pointed out that the task for the
 working class under the then existing conditions was to
 strive for national liberation and the liberation of the work-
 ing class itself.  The Conference clearly defined the correct
 relations between the international working-class movement
 and the. working-class movement in colonial and dependent
 countries.  It has promoted the development of the working-
 class movement in Asia and Australasia and the unity and
 solidarity in the movement.
 In October of this year, the World Federation of Trade
 Unions will convene the 3rd World Congress of Trade
 Unions.     We warmly welcome this move.  We are confident
 that it will make gigantic contributions in  promoting
 solidarity and united action among the working class the
 world over.
 The Chinese working class has boundless sympathy with
 its class brothers in the capitalist, colonial and dependent
 countries who are subjected to a life of misery and persecu-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 tion.  We are under obligation to support their heroic strug-
 gles for national independence and people's democracy.
 The Chinese trade unions have maintained fraternal
 contact with the working class of 50 countries, including the
 Soviet Union, the People's Democracies as well as capitalist,
 colonial and dependent countries.  During these last four
 years, we have sent many delegations to take part in various
 international trade union activities sponsored by the World
 Federation of Trade Unions.  At the same time, we have
 also invited delegates from 28 countries, including the Soviet
 Union, the People's Democracies as well as capitalist,
 colonial and dependent countries to visit China and have
 exchanged experiences in all fields, thus furthering mutual
 understanding and friendship.
 The friendly relations between the working class of
 China and the working class of other countries have streng-
 thened the international solidarity of the working class in the
 Far East and throughout the world.  The fact that our Con-
 gress is honoured with the presence of so many trade union
 delegates from other countries shows the growing solidarity
 and friendship, between the working class of China and other
 countries.
 On behalf of the Chinese trade unions and the Chinese
 workers, I warmly salute our foreign friends attending the
 Congress.  We firmly believe that their presence will further
 promote the solidarity of the working class in the Far East
 and the world.
 The Chinese working class regards the safeguarding of
 peace in the Far East and in the world as its own sacred
 duty.
 With their practical action, the Chinese workers sup-
 ported and continue to support the struggle waged by the
 Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army
 against aggression.  Among the various mines, factories

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 and other enterprises of the whole country, the Chinese trade
 union organizations have extensively unfolded a signature
 movement against the remilitarization of West Germany and
 Japan and for safeguarding world peace.  They will con-
 tinue to wage a determined struggle to safeguard peace in
 the Far East and in the whole world.
 The great, unbreakable friendship between the Chinese
 and the Soviet peoples is a powerful support to the unity of
 the working class of the whole world.  This unity is indis-
 pensable to the struggle for lasting peace and universal
 security.
 As Comrade Stalin taught us:
 The great friendship between the Soviet Union and
 the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee
 -Yainst the threat of new aggression, and a strong bas-
 tion for peace in the Far East and in the world.
 And as Comrade Mao Tse-tung taught us:
 The reason that the great friendship between the
 peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable
 is because it is based on the great principles of inter-
 nationalism of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  The
 friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet
 Union and the peoples of the various People's Democ-
 racies as well as that between all people who love peace,
 democracy and justice in every country of the world is
 also built upon this great principle of internationalism
 and is therefore also unbreakable.
 Clearly, the forces born of such friendship are un-
 limited, inexhaustible and truly invincible.
 The international mission of the Chinese trade unions
 is to strive persistently for the strengthening of unity and
 solidarity of the working-class movement in the Far East
 and the world, and for lasting peace.  We shall strive to
 overcome the difficulties and defects existing in our work

 so as to be able to contribute even more towards the world
 working-class movement.
 Comrades!  Our country has already entered a new
 epoch of economic construction.  The working class of the
 entire country will dedicate itself to the tidal wave of na-
 tional construction and create with its heroic labour a more
 prosperous future.
 We have the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung, our brilliant and great leader, and the Communist
 Party of China, long tried and tested in struggle.  We have
 the selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union.
 We have the support of all the People's Democracies and the
 working class of the world.  We have friends all over the
 world.  We have fully confidence in the fulfilment of our
 great task in striving for the nation's industrialization and
 for the future of socialism.
 Long live the Chinese working class!
 Long live the great People's Republic of China!
 Long live the great, glorious and correct Communist
 Party of China!
 Long live Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the great leader of
 the Chinese people!
 Long live the victory of the great teachings of Marx,

 REPORT ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION
 OF THE TRADE UNIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S
 REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Delegates and Comrades:
 Our country has, from the period of economic restoration,
 rapidly entered the period of large-scale planned economic
 construction.  The level of consciousness and organization
 of the Chinese workers have also been unprecedentedly raised
 following the victory of the Chinese people's revolution.
 The historic task of the Chinese working-class movement set
 forth by the Sixth All-China Labour Congress has been suc-
 cessfully fulfilled.  The Constitution of the All-China Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions adopted by the Sixth Labour Congress
 is no longer in conformity with the changed and developed
 situation today; it should be modified and supplemented in
 accordance with the new situation and the newly gained
 experiences of the working class.  The Constitution adopted
 by the Sixth Labour Congress was entitled "The Constitution
 of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions."  In view of
 the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the fact
 that the trade union organizations throughout China are now
 completely unified, it is first of all necessary to change the
 title "The Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions" into the "Constitution of the Trade Unions of the
 People's Republic of China."
 Explanations on some essential points concerning the
 amendment to the Constitution are given in the following:

 1.  Concerning the Nature, Tasks and Role of the Trade
 Unions Under the People's Democratic Dictatorship
 The nature, tasks and role of the trade unions under the
 people's democratic dictatorship were laid down in principle
 in the resolutions of the Sixth All-China Labour Congress in
 the form of provisions on the policy and tasks of the trade
 union movement in the liberated areas.  These provisions
 were correct. However, being limited by the historical condi-
 tions of that time, the Constitution of the All-China Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions adopted by the Sixth Labour Congress
 was unable to define comprehensively the nature, tasks and
 role of the trade unions.  Therefore, in amending the Con-
 stitution this time, it is necessary to set forth more clearly
 provisions concerning these fundamental issues.
 The trade unions of China are the mass organizations
 of the Chinese working class.  They must firmly preserve
 their nature as class organizations of the working class.
 They must draw a clear demarcation line between the work-
 ing class and the exploiting class and distinguish the work-
 ing class from the independent producers (independent pro-
 ducers are also labourers, but being owners of small business
 and not wage earners, they are different from the working
 class), and unswervingly preserve the class character and
 purity of the trade union organizations.
 It was after the founding of the Chinese Communist
 Party and under its direct leadership that the modern work-
 ing-class movement of China has since developed.  This is
 one of the characteristics of the Chinese working-class move-
 ment as well as one of its fine traditions.  The brilliant great
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese Communist Party
 are the banner of victory of the Chinese working class and
 the entire people.  Without the Chinese Communist Party,
 there would have been no modern revolutionary working-
 class movement in China, and without the leadership of the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Party, there would have been no victory for the Chinese'
 people.  The trade unions of China, led by the Party, have
 rallied the broad masses of the workers around the Party
 and the great Chairman Mao Tse-tung.
 The Chinese trade unions are the mass organizations of
 the working class formed on a voluntary basis, along the
 industrial lines and on the principles of democratic central-
 ism, without distinction of nationality, sex or religious beliefs.
 All join the trade unions of their own volition.  Only when
 the trade unions are formed on such a voluntary basis can
 the mass character of the trade union organizations be
 ensured, the trade unions be genuinely made the organiza-
 tions of the masses of the workers, the Constitution of the
 Trade Unions be consciously observed by the workers, the dis-
 cipline of the trade unions be maintained, and the potential
 role of the trade unions in national construction be developed.
 Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, prior to
 the nation-wide victory of the revolution of the Chinese work-
 ing class and the entire Chinese people, the tasks of the trade
 unions were to organize and educate the workers under the
 leadership of the Communist Party, and to struggle for the
 overthrow of the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism
 and bureaucratic capitalism.  At that time, the working class
 was oppressed, exploited, ruled and pauperized.  To main-
 tain a bare living, the workers had to toil for the reactionary
 rulers and exploiters and suffer from appalling working con-
 ditions and brutal exploitation.  At that time it was neces-
 sary for the trade unions to lead the workers to wage both
 legal and illegal economic struggles under every possible.and
 favourable condition, and to link these struggles closely with
 the political struggle.  At that time all economic struggles
 waged by the trade unions had political significance.
 Now, the situation is entirely different.  The working
 class of China is the leading class of the state.  Under the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 people's democratic dictatorship, the policy, tasks and role
 of the trade unions have undergone a fundamental change
 following the great historic change.  It would be entirely
 wrong to continue at present the policy, tasks and method of
 work of the trade unions adopted under Kuomintang rule
 without taking this change into account.  In essence this
 error would mean a confusion of the state power of the
 people's democratic dictatorship with that of the reactionary
 Kuomintang, a confusion of the relationship between the
 working class and state-owned enterprises which are already
 of a socialist nature and with that between the working class
 and the capitalist enterprises under the Kuomintang regime.
 This confusion would inevitably lead to conflict between the
 working class and the state power led by itself as well as con-
 flict between the working class and the socialist enterprises
 possessed by itself, and lead to economism and syndicalism.
 After the nation-wide victory of the revolution of
 the Chinese  working  class  and  the  Chinese  people,
 the basic task of the trade unions is to protect the fruits
 of victory of the people and to consolidate the state power of
 people's democracy.  The development of production and the
 struggle for industrialization are the central issues in the
 consolidation of the people's democracy. These are to the
 best interest of the working class and the entire Chinese
 people, and serve as a fundamental guarantee for our coun-
 try to advance gradually from New Democracy to a socialist
 society.
 Therefore, the trade unions under the people's democratic
 dictatorship must consider the improvement of production as
 their central task, and on this basis, gradually improve the
 material and cultural life of the workers.
 The working class is the master of the state-owned enter-
 prises which are of a socialist nature. The workers have the
 sacred responsibility for improving production and ensuring

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 the fulfilment or over-fulfilment of the state production plans.
 In the enterprises jointly operated by state and private capital
 and in those specially detailed for doing processing work for
 the state, the workers also have the great responsibility to
 improve production, and at the same time to supervise the
 implementation of contracts, to fight against illegal acts of
 the capitalists, such as doing shoddy work, using inferior
 material, and evading taxes.  In the privately-owned enter-
 prises of a capitalist nature, although class antagonism still
 exists and the workers still suffer a certain degree of exploita-
 tion, yet under present conditions, the existence of those
 private enterprises which are beneficial and not detrimental
 to the national welfare and people's livelihood is still neces-
 sary.  Therefore, the trade unions in the private enterprises
 should carry out the policy of "developing production, bene-
 fiting both labour and capital."  They should unite with the
 capitalists under the leadership of the state economy to im-
 prove production and supervise the implementation of the
 policies, laws and decrees of the state and struggle against
 all illegal acts of the capitalists.
 The trade unions of China should educate the broad
 masses of the workers in the spirit of patriotism and com-
 munism and constantly educate them to understand the
 identity of state and individual interests, and of long-term and
 immediate interests and strive for the raising of their political,
 cultural and technical levels.  They must fully develop the
 spirit of internationalism, actively participate in the inter-
 national working-class movement, strive for the unity and
 solidarity of this movement and for the defence of a lasting
 peace in the Far East and throughout the world.
 11.  Concerning Trade Unoin Membership
 Article 3 of the Constitution adopted by the Sixth Labour
 Congress stipulated:

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions shall be
 basically composed of affiliated organizations.  Any
 trade union organization within the boundaries of China,
 whether industrial, trade or local, may affiliate to the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions upon acceptance of
 this Constitution....
 Such a stipulation was correct because at that time,
 in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, there were still in existence
 various kinds of trade unions, and it was impossible to adopt
 the organizational form of today.  For the purpose of unit-
 ing the working class of the country, we could only build up
 the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the basis of
 affiliated organizations.  But today the conditions have
 changed.  Following the victory of the people's revolution
 and the unification of the country, the trade unions of China
 are no longer a confederation of workers' organizations in
 certain regions, but a unified mass organization of the work-
 ing class of the whole country.  Hence the former stipula-
 tion " . . . basically composed of affiliated organizations"
 should be amended.
 The Draft Constitution stipulates that "Membership ...
 shall be open to all manual and non-manual workers whose
 wages constitute their sole or main means of living, and who
 accept the Constitution of the Trade Unions."
 Explanations on this article are as follows:
 1.       All those who have deprived of their political rights
 by the People's Government are not allowed to join the trade
 unions.  The reason is that since they have been deprived
 of the rights to speech, assembly, association and other polit-
 ical rights, naturally they have no right to join the trade
 unions.  Some of them in the past exploited and oppressed
 the labouring people, some were counter-revolutionaries who
 betrayed their country, and some are serving sentences for
 having violated the law of the state.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 2.  The Draft Constitution stipulates that "membership
 shall be open to all manual and non-manual workers whose
 wages constitute their sole or main means of living and who
 accept the Constitution of the Trade Unions."
 That is to say, all workers, regardless of nationality, sex
 or religious beliefs, who conform to the conditions set out in
 Article I of the Draft Constitution, can be admitted as mem-
 bers to the trade unions.
 That is to say, those manual labourers whose sole or
 main means of living are not wages but other sources of
 income (such as peasants and small handicraftsmen) and
 those non-manual labourers (such as some categories of
 professional workers) should not be admitted to the trade
 unions.  In certain areas in the past, two incorrect tendencies
 in relation to workers' membership were found.
 The first was the tendency of "close-door-ism," which
 means that conditions for membership were inaccessibly high,
 with many unnecessary limitations, and many workers were
 thus kept out of the trade unions.  For instance, the ideologi-
 cally backward workers were not permitted to join the trade
 unions and admittance was limited to those who were diligent
 in study and had work ability and some education. There are
 even cases in which workers applying for membership were
 asked to write an autobiography, to take an oath, to go
 through admission rites, to present a letter of certification
 from the local peasant association, an endorsement from the
 county general trade union, and so on.
 All these measures were completely wrong.  They reveal
 that some of our trade union functionaries did not understand
 that one of the fundamental roles of the trade union is to
 educate the workers and the way to educate and raise the
 level of class consciousness of the workers who are not con-
 scious is by organizing them into the trade unions.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 The other tendency was formalism which means that
 some trade union functionaries laid too much emphasis on
 expansion of the trade union membership.  As a result, many
 non-working class elements, such as small handicraftsmen
 and professional workers, were admitted to the trade union.
 Both these measures were wrong.
 111. Concerning the Rights and Duties of the Members
 The Draft Constitution stipulates that the trade union
 members shall have the following rights:
 (a)  The right to elect and to be elected;
 (b)  The right to make proposals and suggestions to the
 trade unions for the improvement of trade union
 work;
 (c)  The right to criticize at trade union meetings or in
 trade union press any trade union functionaries;
 (d)  The priority in the enjoyment of the various collec-
 tive cultural and welfare establishments conducted
 by the trade unions.
 We consider that the rights of the members provided by
 the Draft Constitution are extremely necessary.
 Why should the rights of trade union members be de-
 fined?
 Firstly, because only by clearly defining and protecting
 the rights of trade union members, can the democratic life
 and democratic system of the trade unions be ensured.  The
 trade union organizations at all levels, from the Executive
 Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions down
 to the basic committees, should be democratically elected at
 the congresses or general meetings of the trade union or-
 ganizations at all levels.  Delegates to these congresses
 should be democratically elected by the membership from the
 bottom up.  If the right of the trade union members to elect
 and to be elected were not stipulated, it would be impossible
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 for the trade unions to be formed on the principles of demo-
 cratic centralism, to become the organizations of the broad
 masses of the workers themselves.
 Secondly, only when the rights of members are clearly
 stipulated and protected, can trade union work be genuinely
 based on the masses, be constantly improved and streng-
 thened by the active participation and support of the broad
 masses of workers.  Since the trade unions are the mass
 organizations of the working class, trade union work means
 work among the masses.  Without the right of the members
 to express opinions and make suggestions to the trade union
 organizations for the improvement of trade union work, it
 would be impossible to develop the enthusiasm of members
 to take part in trade union activities, to absorb the opinions
 and suggestions of the masses, and it would be impossible to
 carry out trade union work properly under the supervision of
 the masses.
 Thirdly, only when the rights of the trade union members
 are clearly defined and protected, can criticism and self-
 criticism, especially criticism from below, be surely developed
 within the trade unions, and the correct leadership of the
 trade unions be guaranteed.  Anyone who refuses criticism
 will be violating the principle of democratic life in the trade
 unions.  We must constantly struggle against any act which
 tends to suppress criticism and undermine the trade union's
 democratic life.
 Fourthly, only by clearly defining and protecting the
 right of the members to democratic life and the democratic
 system, as well as the right to enjoy the benefits of the collec-
 tive cultural and welfare establishments conducted by the
 trade unions, will there be a distinction between the trade
 union members and non-trade union members, will members
 feel the honour and duty of being trade union members, thus
 enabling them to be enthusiastically concerned with trade

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 union activities.  This also serves as an education and en-
 couragement to non-trade union members who should join but
 have not yet joined the trade union.
 The trade union organizations of all levels, therefore,
 should respect and must not violate the rights of every trade
 union member.      All acts violating the rights of the trade
 union members constitute an infringement upon the trade
 union Constitution.  The trade union organizations of all
 levels should constantly carry on education on the rights of
 trade union members in order to enable the members to
 recognize their rights and understand the importance of
 exercising them.
 The Draft Constitution defines that the trade union mem-
 bers have the following duties:
 (a)  To observe laws and decrees of the state and
 labour discipline;
 (b)  To take good care of public property;
 (c)  Assiduously to engage themselves in political,
 technical and cultural studies so as to raise their
 class consciousness and working ability;
 (d)  To observe the Constitution of the Trade Unions and
 decisions and pay membership dues punctually.
 These provisions on the duties of the members as defined
 in the Draft Constitution are not only highly important but
 also necessary.
 Why are the duties of members thus defined?
 Firstly, the Chinese working class has already become
 the leading class of the people's democratic state power.
 Therefore, every worker or employee should understand that
 since the state power is his own, he should protect and con-
 solidate it and consciously observe the policies, laws and
 decrees of the people's government and labour discipline, and
 struggle against those who violate government laws and
 decrees and labour discipline.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Secondly, every worker or employee should take good
 care of public property since it belongs to the working class
 and the people of the entire nation and since it is the material
 basis on which our country may gradually advance towards
 industrialization and socialism, as well as the material basis
 for the improvement of the material and cultural life of all
 the labouring people.  Therefore, public property is sacred
 and inviolable, and every member should protect it and re-
 solutely struggle against all acts of corruption, waste and
 destruction of and apathy over public property.
 Thirdly, if we are to carry out successfully the task of
 national construction, all trade union members must be as-
 siduously engaged in political, technical and cultural studies,
 so as to raise their class consciousness and working ability.
 Otherwise, it would be very difficult for them to shoulder the
 task of national construction.  Therefore, every member
 should study diligently and, in particular, learn from the
 Soviet Union.
 Fourthly, in order to realize successfully the indus-
 tualization of the nation, and to advance steadily towards
 socialism, strong and militant trade union organizations are
 needed.  Therefore, the strengthening of the trade union
 organizations is the common task of all members.  The im-
 portant condition for strengthening the trade unions is for
 all members to observe the Constitution of the Trade Unions
 and decisions and to pay membership dues punctually.
 In short, as long as all members fulfil their duties con-
 scientiously the fighting capacity of the trade union organiza-
 tions will be further raised.  Hence, the trade union organiza-
 tions at all levels should constantly educate their members
 in the duties set forth in the Draft Constitution.  Then
 undoubtedly, the class consciousness of the members will be
 raised, their sense of responsibility as masters will be streng-
 thened, and the fighting capacity of the trade union organiza-

 tions will certainly be intensified, thereby effectively enhanc-
 ing the development of production.
 IV. Concerning the Organizational Principles and Structure
 of the Trade Unions
 1.  The trade unions are built on the basis of democratic
 centralism.
 The Draft Constitution stipulates that the trade unions
 are built on the basis of democratic centralism.  The basic
 system is as follows:
 (a)  The leading bodies of the trade unions of all levels
 are to be elected democratically from the bottom up
 by the membership and should submit reports on
 their work at regular intervals to the membership;
 (b)  The trade unions of all levels shall carry on their
 work in accordance with the Constitution and
 decisions of the Trade Unions;
 (c)  The trade unions shall make decisions only by a
 majority vote of the members present at the meet-
 ing;
 (d)  The lower trade union organizations shall obey the
 higher trade union organizations.
 Some of our trade union organizations have long ceased
 to call membership meetings or congresses and to make
 reports on their work and their expenditure to them.  They
 neither hold timely re-elections nor carry out criticism and
 self-criticism, especially criticism from below.  As a result,
 these trade union organizations have become alienated from
 the masses, thereby hampering supervision from below.
 These conditions have given impetus to the growth of bureau-
 cratism, commandism and violation of regulations in the
 trade union organizations.  Since the San Fan and Wu Fan
 movements, many trade unions have carried out reform and
 reorganization, but normal democratic life and regular

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 criticism and self-criticism are still lacking.  Recently, we
 have received many letters from the workers which exposed
 the shortcomings in trade union functionaries.   These short-
 comings are inseparable from bureaucratism on the part of
 the leadership.  Thus trade union organizations of all levels
 must get rid of bureaucratism and red-tape routine.
 As Chairman Mao Tse-tung taught us:
 In all sorts of work, we cannot accomplish any of
 the tasks if we only propose them but do not attend to
 methods for carrying them out, if we do not oppose
 bureaucratic methods of work and adopt instead prac-
 tical and specific methods of work, and if we do not dis-
 card the authoritarian method of work and adopt instead
 the method of patient persuasion.
 As stipulated in the Draft Constitution, trade union
 organizations of all levels must make regular reports on
 their work and their expenditure to the membership, establish
 a democratic system of normal union life, constantly carry
 out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from
 below, and place the trade unions under the supervision of
 the workers.  Only in this way can the trade unions win the
 support of the broad working masses, keep close contact with
 the workers and fully develop their activeness to fulfil or over-
 fulfil the production tasks of the state.  Only in this way can
 we strengthen the organization and discipline of the workers
 on the basis of their consciousness.
 2.  The trade unions are formed along the industrial
 lines.
 The formation of trade unions along the industrial lines
 is of great importance in ensuring the implementation of
 state production plans, in solving the problems of workers in
 connection with production, wages, labour protection, labour
 insurance, and so on.  To form trade unions along the indus-
 trial lines means:

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 (a)  All trade union members in the same enterprise,
 institution or other units, instead of being or-
 ganized into separate trade unions in accordance
 with their occupations, shall be organized into the
 same basic organization of the same industrial
 union.  If unions are organized according to oc-
 cupation, it will be detrimental not only to the
 development of production but also to the inner
 unity of the working class.
 (b) Trade union members of the same industrial
 branch of national economy should be organized
 on a national scale into a national industrial union,
 with the aim of ensuring the fulfilment or over-ful-
 filment of state production plans in accordance
 with the special features of the various industries
 and the needs of national construction.  On this
 basis, concentrated education should be carried out
 among the workers and problems regarding their
 working conditions and welfare should be solved.
 In carrying out large-scale planned economic con-
 struction, it is necessary to strengthen the work of
 the industrial unions in a planned way and on a
 selective basis.
 (c) Local trade unions throughout the country, under
 possible conditions, should also be formed along
 the industrial lines.  Local trade union councils
 at all levels constitute the joint leading organs of
 the local trade unions and industrial trade unions
 in the given localities.  The local trade unions
 played an important role in building up the trade
 union organizations.   They are playing, and will
 play for a considerable period, an important role
 in the organization and strengthening of the indus-
 trial unions as well as in the development of na-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 tion-wide trade union work.  In strengthening the
 work of the industrial unions on a selective basis,
 the role played by the local trade unions should not
 be neglected.
 3.  The Draft Constitution stipulates:  "The Executive
 Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions shall
 elect at its plenary session a Presidium and a Secretariat."
 In the past, the Standing Committee of the All-China Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions attended to the routine work.  Now the
 Presidium and the Secretariat are set up in order to concen-
 trate on strengthening the work of the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions and its leadership over the industrial unions.
 The Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions is the supreme leading body of the trade unions all
 over the country when the Executive Committee is not in ses-
 sion.                                      It carries out the decisions of the National Congress
 and of the Executive Committee and leads all trade union
 work in the country.
 The Secretariat of the Federation, under the leadership
 of the Presidium, takes care of the routine work of the trade
 unions throughout the country.
 The Draft Constitution also stipulates that some indus-
 trial unions may elect their own presidium to direct their
 daily work, while other industrial unions carry on their daily
 work still under the direction of their respective standing
 committee.  The reason is that some industries are more
 concentrated; their trade union organizations more sound;
 therefore the organizational form of a presidium is more
 appropriate; whereas other industrial unions are not sound
 enough and their daily activities will be conducted by their
 standing committees.
 4.  The Draft Constitution stipulates that trade unions
 of all levels may set up auditing commissions.  The financial
 reports of trade unions of all levels shall become valid only

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 when signed by the chairman of the auditing commission, in
 order that democracy may be fully practised, and trade union
 members may supervise the proper use of the trade union
 funds.
 5.  The Draft Constitution stipulates that the title of the
 local general trade unions will be changed into local trade
 union councils.  The reason is that in the past, all local trade
 union organizations were called general trade unions, result-
 ing in the existence of too many general trade unions.  In
 fact, the local general trade unions constituted the joint lead-
 ing organs of different local trade unions and industrial
 unions; therefore, they should be renamed trade union coun-
 cils.                            From now on, provincial trade union councils should
 strengthen their leadership not only over the industrial
 unions, but also over the county and town trade unions.
 Besides strengthening their-work in the few industries,
 county and town trade unions should strengthen their work
 among the handicraft workers.
 V.  The Question of Basic Trade Union Organizations
 1.  The basic trade union organizations are the founda-
 tion of the trade unions.
 The basic trade union organizations are the foundation
 of the trade unions because they have direct contact and are
 directly linked with the masses and all trade union work
 should be carried out through them.  Soundness of the or-
 ganization of the basic trade unions is a decisive factor in the
 success of the entire trade union work, therefore we must con-
 centrate our efforts on constantly improving the work of the
 basic trade unions.
 .The Draft Constitution stipulates that basic trade union
 organizations are formed by the trade union members of the
 same enterprise or establishment.  Set up along the indus-
 trial lines, they are of vital significance in strengthening the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 unity between the workers and other employees, in guarantee-
 ing a rise of labour productivity and in improving the ma-
 terial, cultural and living conditions of the workers and other
 employees.
 But due to the complexity of China's economy, its uneven
 development, and that small privately-owned enterprises still
 comprise a considerable part of the national economy, it is
 necessary to state clearly where the basic trade unions are
 to be formed.  In the combined major enterprises such as the
 factories and mines of Anshan and Fushun, basic trade union
 organizations may be formed at construction sites or pits. In
 the building industry, basic trade union organizations may,
 on the whole, be established at factories producing building
 materials and  at construction  sites.  However,  because
 building workers are always on the move, it is necessary to
 maintain trade unions at the company level.   In factories
 such as big textile mills, tram companies and so on, basic
 trade union committees may be formed at a branch level, but
 only with the approval of the higher trade union organiza-
 tions.  Machine parts processing factories and small fac-
 tories of over 25 persons may set up basic trade union com-
 mittees; in the case of less than 25 persons, a group organizer
 may be elected, and in the case of less than three persons,
 they may join the nearest trade union organization of the
 related industry or trade or set up a joint group.
 2.  Concerning the establishment of workshop com-
 mittees.
 In large factories with large workshops, workshop com-
 mittees should be established, regardless of shift or type of
 work.  This is beneficial to production and will help educate
 the workers and solve their daily problems.  In small fac-
 tories and small workshops, there is no need to organize
 workshop committees, but trade union groups may be
 organized instead, because too many levels of organization

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 in such small units will prevent trade union work from
 penetrating deeply into the masses, and workshop commit-
 tees will have no work to do.
 3.  With regard to the establishment of trade union
 groups, the Draft Constitution stipulates that they are to be
 organized according to production shifts or work units, and
 not according to the number, sex or individual wishes of the
 workers.  As the trade union group is the unit in which the
 daily activities of the workers are being carried out, the suc-
 cessful functioning of the trade union group has significant
 bearings on the work of the basic trade union.  This kind of
 trade union group organized according to production shifts,
 or work units will facilitate production, the conducting of
 education among the workers and the solution of their daily
 problems.
 4.  With regard to the establishment of working sub-
 committees in the basic trade union committees and work-
 shop committees, the Draft Constitution stipulates that they
 may be organized by the basic trade union committees and
 workshop  (or department)  committees, depending upon
 their practical needs.  This stipulation is entirely necessary
 because  working sub-committees  should  be  established
 according to the practical needs and conditions in the work-
 shops and factories.                                     For instance, in comparatively large
 factories and workshops or factories and workshops with
 achievements in trade union activities, working sub-commit-
 tees such as production sub-committee, wage sub-committee
 (which may also deal with rationalization proposals), sub-
 committees on cultural and educational affairs, on labour
 insurance, on labour protection, on mutual help, and on the
 material welfare of the workers may be generally established.
 In small factories or workshops, there is no need to set up
 such sub-committees since the committee members can divide
 the daily work among themselves.

 V1.  The Question of Organization of Trade Union Councils
 of Handicraft Workers
 The Draft Constitution stipulates "Regulations govern-
 ing the organization of trade union councils for handicraft
 workers will be formulated separately."  This stipulation is
 made because the handicrafts are different from modern in-
 dustry and vary in different localities.                                       Therefore it is not
 advisable to organize the handicraft workers with the or-
 ganizational form and method of work as applied among the
 industrial workers.  It is necessary to stipulate separately
 the methods of organizing handicraft workers. I propose that
 the Congress authorize the next Executive Committee to study
 and deal with this problem.
 My report concerning the amended Constitution is now
 drawing towards the end.  In short, the important tasks in
 building our trade unions at present are: to strengthen the
 trade union organizations of all levels, to strengthen the
 industrial unions, to strengthen the work of the basic trade
 union organizations and to develop trade union democracy
 and improve its system of work.  Only when these tasks have
 been successfully accomplished shall we succeed in streng-
 thening and raising the fighting capacity of the working
 class and successfully accomplishing the glorious task of ful-
 filling our Five-Year Plan.

 MARXISM-THE BANNER OF LIBERATION OF THE
 CHINESE WORKING CLASS
 Yang Hsien-chen
 Karl Marx, founder of scientific socialism, the most out-
 standing and gifted thinker of mankind, and great leader and
 teacher of the working class of the whole world, was born on
 May 5, 1818. Today is the 135th anniversary of his birth-
 day.                                 Marx has made incomparably great contributions to
 mankind.  Together with Engels, he created scientific social-
 ism or Marxism-the revolutionary theory of the proletariat.
 Marxism is the only correct revolutionary theory.  As
 Lenin said, "The main thing in the doctrine of Marx is that
 it brings out the historic role of the proletariat as the builder
 of a socialist society."
 This theory has for over a hundred years educated and
 armed the proletariat and all oppressed and exploited masses
 of the whole world.  Under the guidance of Marxism the
 workers and all the exploited and oppressed masses have
 united to fight for the overthrow of the capitalist system of
 slavery and all other systems of exploitation and oppression
 of man by man, and to realize the brilliant future of socialism
 and communism.
 Before Marx there were certain people who entertained
 socialist ideas and dreamed of an ideal society where there
 would be no exploitation of man by man.  But socialism
 prior to Marx was utopian socialism.
 At the beginning of the 19th century there were in
 Europe some utopian socialists who severely criticized and
 denounced capitalism and tried to wipe out this hateful dark
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 society so that mankind could live a happier life.  But they
 did not understand the laws of historical development of
 mankind, nor the laws of development of capitalist society.
 Thus they did not know what forces to rely upon and what
 methods to apply for the elimination of capitalism and the
 realization of socialism.  The utopian socialists thought that
 by relying on certain subjective lofty desires of man, they
 would be able to wipe out capitalism and create a new
 society.  They thought that it was only necessary to per-
 suade the rich and influential, arouse their conscience so that
 they would admit the injustice of exploitation and therefore
 be willing to abolish it, thus establishing a socialist society.
 Obviously such dreams of realizing a socialist society with-
 out struggle, without the proletarian revolution and dictator-
 ship of the proletariat, can never become reality.
 Before Marx, utopian socialism was not integrated with
 the working-class movement.  Although it partly reflected
 the demands of the proletariat and afforded most valuable
 materials for enlightening the workers, this school of social-
 ism was still an immature theory.  As pointed out by Marx
 and Engels, that theory reflected the immature capitalist
 production and the immature class relations of the time.  It
 was to a certain extent influenced by the bourgeoisie and
 therefore could not be the weapon for liberation of the work-
 ing class.  Thus the working-class movement prior to Marx
 could only grope in the dark.  At that time the workers did
 not yet understand why they were subjected to the miserable
 life of being exploited and oppressed.  They did not under-
 stand the important role of the working class in history.
 Marx and Engels thoroughly criticized utopian social-
 ism.                                    They criticized all earlier schools of philosophy and
 social science, summarized the finest achievements of man-
 kind in the natural and social sciences of the first half of the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 19th century and created dialectical and historical material-
 ism.
 Marx and Engels for the first time in world history dis-
 covered the laws of the historical development of mankind,
 discovered the laws of class struggle in the entire history of
 class society and discovered the laws of the inevitable doom
 of the capitalist society, and the inevitable coming of com-
 munism.  The Marxist theory afforded the working class
 and all the oppressed and exploited masses a scientific basis
 in their revolutionary struggle for liberation.
 Marx and Engels scientifically proved that socialism
 was neither born out of utopian thinking, nor was it the pro-
 duct of good wishes.  It was the inevitable result of the
 development of the internal contradictions within modern
 capitalist society.
 The growth of the modern working class with the
 development of large-scale capitalist industry was the great
 social force for eliminating capitalism and creating a new
 socialist society.
 Marx and Engels discovered the historical mission to
 be shouldered by the working class.  They pointed out that
 only the working class can lead all working people to attack
 capitalism, to eliminate forever the system of exploitation of
 man by man, and thus enables mankind to lead the most
 happy and prosperous life.
 Marx and Engels pointed out that the proletariat must
 rely on its own force to fulfil the historical mission of eliminat-
 ing capitalism and creating a new society. They also pointed
 out that once the workers become conscious of their role in
 history and organize themselves, they will be invincible.  In
 order to achieve this aim, the working class must have its
 own political party-the political party of the revolutionary
 proletariat.  This party must educate the workers in Marxist

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 ideas, lead the workers and unite with all the oppressed
 people to wage revolutionary struggle.
 Marx and Engels taught us that the revolutionary move-
 ment of the proletariat differs in principle from all revolu-
 tionary movements in the past.  It is neither a movement of
 a handful of people nor in the interests of a handful of peo-
 ple.                                     It is the movement of the overwhelming majority of
 people and is in their interests.  Marx and Engels pointed
 out to the proletariat of all countries that they must rally
 around themselves all exploited working masses in the pro-
 cess of revolutionary struggle.
 Because the historical task of the proletariat is to wipe
 out all systems of exploitation of man by man, and finally
 eliminate classes, it can most thoroughly represent the
 interests of all working masses.  To win its own liberation
 the proletariat must at the same time liberate all other
 oppressed people.  Hence it is wrong to think that it is
 possible to realize socialism without the leadership of the
 working class, while, on the other hand, it is also wrong to
 think that only the working class is needed and it is unneces-
 sary to unite with all the oppressed labourers, particularly
 the broad sections of peasantry, to achieve this aim.
 Marx and Engels taught us that, in order to eliminate
 classes and build a socialist society, the working class must
 lead the peasants and other working masses to establish the
 dictatorship of the proletariat.  Marx and  Engels also
 ingeniously pointed out that to realize communist society it
 is necessary to pass through two stages.  Socialist society
 is the first stage of communism.  Through socialism man-
 kind will realize communism, the most beautiful and happiest
 epoch in human history.
 These discoveries of Marx and Engels are their immortal
 contributions to the cause of human progress.

 The birth of Marxist science gave the sharpest revolu-
 tionary weapon to the working class.  The integration of
 Marxism with the working-class movement has brought
 about its entry into the period of wholly conscious, organized,
 purposeful struggle.
 The Manifesto of the Communist Party published by
 Marx and Engels in 1848 gave the first complete and system-
 atic exposition to the theory of scientific socialism which
 they had founded.  The publication of the Manifesto of the
 Communist Party announced the birth of scientific socialism.
 As Comrade Stalin said, "Marx and Engels opened a new
 era with their Manifesto of the Communist Party."
 In their later works, Marx and Engels further developed
 and substantiated the viewpoints which they had expounded
 in the Manifesto of the Communist Party.  Marx's Capital
 is of particular significance in this regard. In this great
 masterpiece, Marx made a penetrating and thorough scientif-
 ic analysis of the laws of development of capitalism. He
 thoroughly exposed the substance of capitalist exploitation,
 and brilliantly demonstrated the inevitable doom of the
 capitalist system and its inevitable substitution by the
 socialist system.
 During his life, Marx not only engaged in tremendous
 scientific research and founded scientific socialism, but also
 directly led the world working-class movement and carried
 out important organizational activities among the workers.
 He was a staunch and indomitable revolutionary.  He is
 the greatest leader and teacher of world working-class
 movement.  He and Engels joined the Communist League in
 1847, and the Manifesto of the Communist Party was written
 for this organization.  Marx actively took part in the Ger-
 man Revolution of 1848.  For this, he was sent to court
 trials by the counter-revolutionaries and later deported.  In
 1864, in London, Marx founded the First International-the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 International Working Men's Association.  Under the leader-
 ship of Marx, the First International welded together the
 working-class movement of various European countries, and
 advanced the world working-class movement one great step
 further.
 The life of Marx was a life of struggle.  He dedicated
 everything to the working class, to the great cause of com-
 munism. Although frequently living in extreme poverty and
 in exile throughout his life, Marx persisted in his theoretical
 research and practical work.  He constantly gave warm
 concern to the fate of the oppressed people throughout the
 world.  During his life, not a single social event which was
 of progressive significance escaped his attention, no matter
 in what part of the world it might have taken place. While
 evaluating the historical changes within every nation, Marx
 started from the interests of the liberation of the world's
 working class.  He gave brilliant instructions on principle
 to the proletariat, on tactics in struggle in different historical
 conditions.  The close integration between scientific theories
 and revolutionary practice is exactly a characteristic of
 Marxism.
 Marx         never  compromised  in  struggle  against  all
 enemies.     He not only resolutely opposed all rulers in
 Europe at that time, but also waged uncompromising strug-
 gles against all opportunist theories and schools in the work-
 ing-class movement.  Both in theory and in practice, Marx
 smashed all opportunist theories and schools such as Prou-
 dhonism in France, syndicalism in England, Lassalleanism
 in Germany, Mazziniism in Italy, Pakuninism in Russia.  In
 this way he demonstrated to the working class of the world
 that only Marxism can lead the working class and all
 oppressed people to liberation.
 Marx died on March 14, 1883.  In the entire period of
 70 years since the death of this great, immortal revolution-

 ary, every development in human history affords new proof
 of the correctness of the science of Marxism.  Marxist
 ideology is already universal.  The truth of scientific social-
 ism founded by Marx and Engels has been proved by facts
 and communist ideology has now become a living reality.
 The great Lenin and Stalin, successors to the cause of
 Marx and Engels, creatively developed and enriched Marxism
 in accordance with new historical conditions and new experi-
 ences in revolutionary struggles.
 Lenin pointed out that imperialism is the highest stage
 in the development of capitalism, that is decaying and mori-
 bund capitalism and that it is the eve of proletariat revolu-
 tion.                              On the basis of the historical conditions in which
 capitalism had already entered imperialism, Lenin laid down
 theories and tactics of the proletariat revolution.  Therefore,
 as accurately defined by Stalin, "Leninism is the Marxism
 of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution."
 By applying Marxism, Lenin discovered the law of un-
 even development of capitalism, and arrived at the con-
 clusion that socialism can first be victorious in a few coun-
 tries or even in one country.
 Lenin and Stalin concretely applied and developed
 Marxism and led the great October Socialist Revolution to
 victory.  They first overthrew capitalism in a territory
 occupying one-sixth of the globe, created the socialist state
 and for the first time in the history of mankind the Soviet
 Union eradicated all systems of exploitation of man by man.
 This is a great victory of Marxism-Leninism.
 Lenin and Stalin pointed out that during the period of

 Lenin and Stalin further advanced the theory of Marx-
 ism on socialism.  Stalin further summed up the experience
 of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and concretely
 developed the theory of building communist society.
 After the death of Lenin, Stalin further and comprehen-
 sively advanced Marxism-Leninism to a new stage of de-
 velopment.  Stalin gave a comprehensive and complete
 definition to Marxism:
 Marxism is the science of the laws governing the
 development of nature and society, the science of the
 revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the
 science of the victory of socialism in all countries,
 the science of building a communist society.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung in his "The Greatest Friend-
 ship" stated:
 Comrade Stalin, in a comprehensive and classical
 manner, developed Marxist-Leninist theory; he opened
 up a new stage in the development of Marxism.  Com-
 rade Stalin creatively developed Lenin's theory of the
 uneven development of capitalism and the theory of the
 possibility of the victory of socialism in one country,
 taken singly;  Comrade Stalin made a creative con-
 tribution to the theory of the general crisis of the
 capitalist system and to the theory of the construction
 of communism in the U.S.S.R.; he discovered and sub-
 stantiated the basic economic law of modern capitalism
 and the basic economic law of socialism; he contributed
 to the theory of revolution in the colonies and semi-
 colonies.  Comrade Stalin also creatively developed the
 Leninist theory of the building of the Party. All this
 further rallied the workers of the whole world and all
 oppressed classes and peoples in consequence of which
 the struggle of the working class and all oppressed
 peoples for their liberation and happiness, and the suc-

 cesses achieved in this struggle, assumed unprecedented
 proportions.
 Led by the genius of the great Stalin, the Soviet Union,
 through several five-year plans, succeeded in building a
 strong, powerful and industrialized socialist state with collec-
 tive agriculture, and is now striding towards communism.
 It is not only a happy land of freedom and liberty to the
 Soviet working class, collective farmers, and intelligentzia,
 but also the saviour of all oppressed peoples in the world in
 their struggle for liberation.  It is a mighty bulwark of peace
 for the whole world.  The Soviet people, reared and led by
 Lenin and Stalin, made selfless and noble sacrifices in the
 Great Patriotic War which had a decisive effect in the destiny
 of mankind, defeated the fascist imperialist powers of Ger-
 many, Italy and Japan.  They not only defended the Soviet
 Socialist Motherland but also assisted the peoples of the
 countries in Eastern Europe to obtain liberation from the
 slavery of fascism and build up their own people's democra-
 cies.  This is still another great victory of Marxism-Leninism
 of world historic significance after the victory of the October
 Socialist Revolution.
 Four years after the victorious conclusion of the Second
 World War, victory was also achieved in the revolution of
 the great Chinese people.  This is a great victory of Marx-
 ism-Leninism in colonial and semi-colonial countries.  Since
 then, in the vast area spreading from Europe to Asia there
 are already 800 million people who have been set free from
 capitalist exploitation and oppression and have built the in-
 vincible camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet
 Union.  Stalin is the immortal standard-bearer of this camp
 of mighty and invincible force.  Therefore as Comrade
 Malenkov said:
 Comrade Stalin, that great thinker of our era, crea-
 tively developed the teachings of Marxism-Leninism in

 the new conditions of history.  His name rightly ranks
 with those of the greatest men in human history-Marx,
 Engels, and Lenin.
 The banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is the
 banner of victory of the working class and all progressive
 mankind throughout the world.
 Marx had the warmest sympathy and concern for the
 national liberation struggles of the Chinese people in history.
 As early as a hundred years back, Marx wrote many articles
 on the Opium War and the Taiping Revolution.  In his writ-
 ings he bitterly condemned the criminal acts of the aggressors
 and the unjust war they launched against the Chinese people.
 Together with Engels, he predicted that from the struggles
 of the Chinese people one would see "the dawn of a new era
 in the whole of Asia."  Today, this prediction has already
 come about.  Without the guidance of Marxist ideology, it
 would be impossible to imagine the victory of the Chinese
 revolution.  In his work On People's Democratic Dictator-
 ship, Comrade Mao Tse-tung stated:  "We are indebted to
 Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin for giving us our weapon.
 This weapon is not a machine-gun, but Marxism-Leninism."
 He further stated: "The Chinese people found Marxism-
 Leninism, a universal truth which is applicable anywhere.
 The face of China then began to change."
 The Chinese people found the truth of Marxism-Leninism
 through a process of groping and searching.
 In the early years of the twentieth century, and before
 the bourgeois revolution in 1911, the name of Marx was men-
 tioned in the publications of China and Marxist theory was
 introduced in bits and pieces.  But at that time the Chinese
 working class had not yet become an independeit political
 force, and the revolution at that time was led by the bour-
 geois and petty-bourgeois elements.  The bourgeois and

 petty-bourgeois revolutionaries only mentioned Marx in pass-
 ing, they could not understand the theory of Marx at all.
 At that time the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolu-
 tionaries attempted to reform their country on the model of
 the western capitalist countries; they ended in failure.
 Doubts and distrust of the bourgeois ideology among the
 Chinese people arose and increased; the First World War
 proved that capitalist system could only bring disaster to
 the people of the world.  The victory of the October Socialist
 Revolution which broke out during the First World War
 brought new hopes to the Chinese people.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung said:
 The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us
 Marxism-Leninism.     The October Revolution helped the
 advanced people of China and of the whole world to
 adopt a proletarian world outlook as an instrument for
 looking into a nation's future or for reconsidering one's
 own problems.
 During the First World War, following the great de-
 velopment of national capital in China, there was a great
 development of the Chinese working class.  Working-class
 movement began to develop and Marxist ideology helped
 the advanced people of China to see that the dependable force
 in the reform of our country was no other but this developing
 force of the working class.
 Thus, under the immense influence of the October
 Socialist Revolution, the Chinese started to really understand
 Marxism.  Moreover, as soon as Marxism came to China,
 it was combined with the working-class movement through
 the progressives among the intelligentzia of the time and
 became a powerful material force.
 On the basis of the combination of Marxism-Leninism
 and the Chinese working-class movement, the Chinese Com-
 munist Party was founded-this Party has after over thirty

 years of trials in history proved to be the only revolutionary
 political party that can lead the Chinese people to liberation.
 And we are confident that it will continue to lead the Chinese
 people to socialism and the final aim of communism.
 The appearance of the modern working class in China
 and the development of the working-class movement were the
 class basis for the birth of the Communist Party of China.
 But with this condition alone and without the dissemination
 of Marxism-Leninism in China there could not have been the
 birth of the Chinese Communist Party.  For had the working
 class relied only on their. own force, it would have led them
 to the ideas of syndicalism, and there would not have been
 an awakening to communism.  On the ideological basis of
 syndicalism there would not have been the birth of the Com-
 munist Party.  Only by permeating the scientific theories of
 Marxism within the Chinese working class was it possible
 to change the Chinese working class from a class in itself
 to a class for itself, and organize a real militant revolutionary
 political party-the Communist Party of China.
 The history of the Communist Party of China and of the
 Chinese revolution led by the Party, is the history of the
 application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China.
 It is also the history of the struggle of Marxist-Leninists in
 China against various erroneous ideologies.  This history
 centred around the Chinese Bolsheviks headed by Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung.  In guiding the Chinese revolution, Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung has combined the universal truth of Marxism-
 Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's theory and tactics on the Chinese
 revolution based on Marxism have applied and developed
 the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin in accord-
 ance with the concrete conditions in, China.
 Marxist's theory on class struggle and the idea of the
 hegemony of the proletariat are clearly manifested in the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 works of Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  Basing himself on this
 theory, Comrade Mao Tse-tung routed the erroneous ideas
 and actions of opportunism of all kinds.  The opportunists
 opposed and distorted Marxism on this very basic point.
 The thesis of the Right-wing opportunists, actually, was the
 denial or reconciliation of class struggle, the giving up or
 weakening of the hegemony of the proletariat.  The "Left"
 wing opportunists also did not understand how to conduct
 class struggle, nor did they understand how hegemony of
 the proletariat can be won over.  Therefore, they caused the
 revolutionary struggles of the proletariat to end in failure.
 If we followed the direction of the opportunists, we would
 have lost hegemony of the proletariat.
 Having mastered Marxism, Comrade Mao Tse-tung
 applied the Marxist theory to the practice of the Chinese
 revolution and routed the erroneous views of both types of
 opportunism.  He persistently opposed the non-Marxist
 thesis of denying class struggle, and at the same time, ably
 analysed the concrete historical situation, and starting from
 the practical conditions of the relative strength of all classes,
 formulated the tactics of revolutionary struggles in opposing
 blind adventurism.
 The Marxist theory of the hegemony of the proletariat
 which was further developed by Lenin and Stalin, found its
 expression in the first stage of China's revolution in Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung's definition of the character of the Chinese
 revolution.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung clearly pointed out that
 the Chinese revolution is led by the working class and based
 on the alliance- of workers and peasants; it is a revolution of
 the broad masses of people against imperialism, feudalism,
 and  bureaucratic  capitalism.  Under  all  circumstances,
 whether before or after the victory of the revolution, Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung has always insisted on the idea of the
 hegemony of the proletariat, thereby defending Marxism on

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 this basic point.  After the victory of China's revolution,
 ideologies and actions of all kinds attempting to weaken the
 hegemony of the proletariat were criticized and corrected.
 When analysing the causes of failure of the revolutions
 in Germany, France and other countries in 1848-1849, Marx
 paid special attention to the role of the peasants in revolu-
 tionary struggles.  This thought of Marx was later developed
 by Lenin and Stalin into the thought of alliance between
 workers and peasants under the leadership of the proletariat.
 This is the key problem of the achievement of revolutionary
 victory by the proletariat.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung, basing himself on the theory
 of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on peasant question, has
 fully appraised the force and role of the peasantry in the
 Chinese revolution.  China at present is still a country in
 which small farming economy is in a predominant position
 quantitatively.  Therefore the peasant  question has  its
 special significance.  The basic divergence of view between
 Chinese Marxists and opportunists is sharply expressed in
 the peasant question.  During the First Chinese Revolution-
 ary Civil War, the Right opportunists as represented by
 Chen Tu-hsiu, paid attention only to the co-operation with
 the Kuomintang, and forgot about the peasantry.  On the
 other hand, the "Left" opportunists as represented by Chang
 Kuo-tao, paid attention only to the working-class movement,
 and also forgot about the peasantry.  Both of these two
 groups of opportunists did not know where to find allies.
 Only Comrade Mao Tse-tung who thoroughly understood the
 teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin correctly solved
 this problem.  As early as 1926, he pointed out that the
 broadest and most reliable ally of the proletariat was the
 peasantry.  Later on, in his work, On People's Democratic
 Dictatorship, Comrade Mao Tse-tung again emphatically
 pointed out:

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 The foundation of the people's democratic dicta-
 torship is the alliance of the working class, peasantry
 and urban petty-bourgeoisie.  It is mainly the alliance
 of the workers and peasants. . . . In over-throwing im-
 perialism and the reactionary clique of the Kuomintang,
 these two classes are the major force.  The transition
 from New Democracy to socialism also depends pri-
 marily upon the alliance of these two classes.
 Therefore the Chinese workers who have acted under
 the direction of Marxism, should not, even for one minute,
 detach from their own peasant brothers, nor overlook the
 alliance with the peasant class.  They should know well how
 to maintain and develop this alliance, to educate and reform
 the peasantry through this alliance, so as to march with them
 towards socialism.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung's theories on the united front,
 on revolutionary wars, on the construction of New Democ-
 racy, etc., all are conclusions drawn from the practical ex-
 periences of the Chinese revolutionary struggles, through the
 application of the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint and Marxist
 method.  Lenin said:  "The Marxian doctrine is omnipotent
 because it is true."  The victory won by the Chinese revolu-
 tion under the direction of the thought of Mao Tse-tung also
 shows that the Marxian doctrine is true, and also omnipotent.
 As in the past and present, the working class and other
 labouring people of China should rely, in the future, on
 Marxism as their guide; they should unite with the working
 class and the working people of all nations and march on
 victoriously under the glorious fighting banner of Marx,
 Engels, Lenin and Stalin.
 Comrades, when commemorating the anniversary of the
 birth of Marx, the great founder of scientific socialism, we
 should carry out ideological education on Marxism more
 widely and more thoroughly among our workers.  Since the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 founding of our Party, we have carried out much work and
 achieved great results in the field of popularizing Marxism
 and in the carrying out of ideological education in Marxism
 among our working class and other labouring people.
 Since 1949, when the Chinese revolution achieved nation-
 wide victory, we have also persistently strengthened polit-
 ical and ideological education among the working class.
 During these four years, besides the education in current
 events and policies which has been carried out from time
 to tirpe, alongside of the development of the work of the
 whole nation, ideological education in Marxism, such as the
 education in materialist world outlook, education in the laws
 of social development, education in class struggles and
 education regarding the future of socialism and communism
 has been carried out more or less systematically.  Such
 education has generally achieved the expected results. This
 was manifested in the great raising of the level of class con-
 sciousness of the workers and the continuous appearance of
 inventions and creations among the workers.  Besides, in
 different enterprises education has been carried out among
 the workers on the development of production.  It is pointed
 out that only by the- development of production can the
 strength of the working class be increased.    As instructed
 by Lenin and Stalin, the establishment of every new factory
 is equal to the establishment of a new fortress. It is pointed
 out that only by the development of production can the liv-
 ing standards of the working class and other working peo-
 ple be gradually raised.  The working masses are taught
 to understand the identity of the immediate and long-term
 interests, the,identity of the interests of the individual and of
 the state, and the superiority of socialist enterprises.  As a
 result the political level of the masses of workers has been
 raised.

 Evidently the more widely and thoroughly Marxist
 education is carried out, the more rapidly will the conscious-
 ness of the working class be raised; and the more rapidly
 the consciousness of the working class is raised, the more
 will the road of our country to industrialization be secured.
 This is an inevitable law.
 But it must be pointed out that not all our comrades
 can thoroughly understand this law.  That is to say, not all
 of our comrades thoroughly understand the great significance
 of carrying out Marxist education among the working class.
 Judging from a nation-wide scale, the carrying out of educa-
 tion in Marxism among the working class is not yet balanced
 and penetrating.  This is shown in the fact that in many
 regions the tendencies of syndicalism and economism still
 exist.  Both these tendencies have a common feature, that
 is, both of them neglect the carrying out of the ideological
 education in Marxism among the workers, or dare not prop-
 agate communism among the masses of workers.  Both
 these tendencies of syndicalism and economism are anti-
 Marxist tendencies.  Marx and Engels had endeavoured for
 their whole life to arm the working-class movement with the
 theory of scientific socialism so that the movement would
 be detached from the control of bourgeois ideology of syndi-
 calism or economism.
 Lenin and Stalin have insisted on the thesis that the
 movement of working class must be integrated with Marxist
 ideology-the ideology of scientific socialism.  They have
 critically pointed out that all attempts to detach the work-
 ing-class movement from Marxist ideology are, in practice,
 leading the working class to accept the influence of bourgeois
 ideology.
 Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the
 Communist Party of China, following the directions of Marx,
 Engels, Lenin and Stalin, has persistently armed our work-

 ing class with the ever victorious Marxism and struggled
 against all tendencies which neglect the carrying out of
 political and ideological education among the working class.
 The great Chinese working class has shouldered and
 will shoulder the greatest historical tasks.  We are armed
 with the Marxist ideology and under the leadership of the
 Communist Party; we are sure that our historical tasks will
 be accomplished.
 With the joint efforts and the close unity of the world's
 working class headed by the working class of the Soviet
 Union, the sacred cause of Marxism will be victorious
 throughout the world!

 CLOSING ADDRESS BY LIU CHANG-SHENG
 Delegates, Guests and Comrades:
 The Seventh All-China Congress of Trade Unions is
 now drawing to a victorious conclusion.
 The Congress, held from May 2 to 11, has heard reports
 on trade union work in China, on the amendments to the
 Constitution of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic
 of China, on the financial work of the trade unions of China
 and on conditions in industry.  After discussions at group
 meetings and at plenary sessions, the Congress has adopted
 resolutions of historical significance concerning the above-
 mentioned reports.  In these reports and resolutions, the
 Congress has summed up the experience in the trade union
 work in China during the past four years and has defined the
 policy and task of the trade unions of China during the period
 of national planned economic construction.  A new leading
 organ of all the trade unions of China-the Seventh Execu-
 tive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions-
 has been elected at this Congress, which is a sign of the
 unprecedented unity of the Chinese working class.  We
 believe that the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions, under the leadership of
 the Communist Party of China, will uphold and develop the
 glorious traditions of China's trade unions, keep in close
 contact with and whole-heartedly serve the masses of work-
 ers throughout the country, and correctly and thoroughly
 carry out the resolutions of the Congress.  We believe that
 it will mobilize and organize the workers of the whole coun-
 try for the successful accomplishment of the new historical
 task of ensuring the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the

 state economic construction plan, of fighting for the indus-
 trialization of our country and its gradual transition to
 socialism.  This is a great achievement of our Congress.
 This great achievement is inseparable from the intimate
 concern and guidance of the great Communist Party of
 China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  The trade unions of
 China will assuredly further rally the broad masses of the
 workers of the entire country around the Communist Party
 of China and Comrade Mao Tse-tung, and march from vic-
 tory to victory under the banner of the great Mao Tse-tung.
 Our Congress has had the warm concern and support
 of the Central People's Government and the people of the
 country.  We are profoundly conscious of the fact that only
 in a people's democracy led by the working class can the
 working class receive such great esteem from the state, and
 enjoy such a glorious and important position.  At the same
 time, we are even more profoundly aware of our great re-
 sponsibilities in the construction of our country.  The trade
 union organizations at different levels must hereafter further
 strengthen education in patriotism among the workers of the
 country.  The trade unions must educate the workers to
 observe state policies, laws and decrees and supervise their
 implementation.  The trade unions must in this way fulfil
 their responsibilities in the period of national construction,
 and play their role as the solid social pillar of the people's
 democratic state power.
 Our Congress has been honoured by the speeches of the
 representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the
 peasants at the closing session and by messages of greet-
 ings from people of various circles of the country.  These
 greetings represent the expectations and encouragement of
 the people of the country towards the Chinese working class.
 They manifest the firm unity between the workers, peasants
 and people of various circles of the country.  These greet-

 ings have greatly inspired us and tremendously increased
 our courage and confidence in fulfilling the task of national
 construction.  The workers of China will forever maintain
 and consolidate this,, close alliance with the broad masses of
 peasants, and unite more closely with the people of the coun-
 try in order to consolidate the People's Democratic Dicta-
 torship.  This will be an invincible force in ensuring the
 fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the tasks in the period of
 national construction, and in consolidating and developing
 the victory achieved by the Chinese people.
 We feel especially elated because of the presence and
 greetings of the delegation of the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, of the delegations of the Soviet Trade Unions and
 the trade unions of the People's Democracies, as well as the
 presence and greetings of the delegations of trade unions
 from many other countries.  All these greetings manifest
 the good wishes and support of the world working class for
 the great peaceful construction undertaken by the Chinese
 working class and the Chinese people.  They manifest the
 fervent desire of the world working class for peace and their
 firm unity in the struggle for peace.  These greetings and
 support from the world working class have further enhanced
 the confidence of the Chinese working class in the construc-
 tion of their Motherland and in the defence of world peace.
 The workers of China will develop to a high degree the spirit
 of internationalism and patriotism.  They will strive unceas-
 ingly to strengthen the internal unity of the camp of peace,
 democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, streng-
 then the close unity of the peoples of the Soviet Union and
 China and the unity of the world working class and all peace-
 loving people; the Chinese workers will strive to defend the
 unity of the international working-class movement and last-
 ing peace in the Far East and in the world.

 resolutions of this Congress into practical action of thousands
 upon thousands of workers in the different fields of work.  We

 CONSTITUTION OF THE TRADE UNIONS OF THE
 PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Adopted by the Seventh All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions, May 10, 1953
 The Chinese working class, under the leadership of the
 Communist Party of China and its great leader Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung, has waged a protracted struggle in which it
 established the closest alliance with the peasants, formed a
 united front with all patriotic and democratic forces to fight
 against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism,
 and consequently defeated the foreign imperialists and the
 internal counter-revolutionaries, thereby achieving great vic-
 tory in the people's democratic revolution.
 It was after the birth of the Chinese Communist Party-
 a party of the Chinese working class itself-and under its
 direct leadership that the working-class movement of pres-
 ent-day China progressed along the road to victory.
 The trade unions of China led by the Communist Party
 have rallied the broad masses of the workers around the Party
 and have thus become transmission belts between the Party
 and the masses.  After the establishment of the people's
 democratic dictatorship, the trade unions under the leadership
 of the Party have become a school of administration, a school
 of management and a school of communism for the workers.
 The trade unions of China are mass organizations of all
 manual and non-manual workers living entirely or mainly

 on their wages, formed on a voluntary basis without distinc-
 tion of nationality, sex or religious beliefs.
 The People's Republic of China is a republic led by the
 working class.  Hence, the interests of the state and the com-
 mon interests of the entire people constitute the fundamental
 interests of the working class.  The trade unions, on behalf
 of the workers, should therefore take an active part in the
 enactment of laws and decrees of the state concerning pro-
 duction, labour as well as the material and cultural life of the
 workers, firmly support and carry out all the policies, laws
 and decrees of the People's Government, and serve as firm
 social pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship.
 The most important tasks of the trade unions of China
 during the period of national construction are to strengthen
 the unity of the working class, to consolidate the alliance of
 workers and peasants, to educate the workers to observe con-
 sciously the laws and decrees of the state and labour dis-
 cipline, to strive for the development of production, for the con-
 stant increase of labour productivity, for the fulfilment and
 over-fulfilment of the production plans of the state, for speedy
 industrialization of the country and for steady advancement
 towards socialism.  The trade unions should constantly show
 concern for the improvement of the living and working con-
 ditions of the workers and, on the basis of developing pro-
 duction, gradually but actively improve the material and
 cultural life of the workers.
 In the state-owned enterprises, the workers are the mas-
 ters of the enterprises, and it should be the sacred duty of
 the trade unions to mobilize and organize the workers to
 ensure the fulfilment and over-fulfilment of the state produc-
 tion plans.
 In enterprises jointly owned by state and private capital
 and in the enterprises which regularly do processing work
 for the state, it is the paramount duty of the trade unions to

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350002-2
 raise production and to supervise the implementation of con-
 tracts.
 In privately-owned enterprises, although the workers are
 still subjected to exploitation, their political rights and legit-
 imate economic interests are afforded effective protection by
 law of the state and by the trade union organizations.  There-
 fore it is also the duty of the trade unions in the privately-
 owned enterprises to organize and educate the workers to
 raise production and see to it that the capitalists are observ-
 ing the government laws and decrees, thus enabling these
 enterprises to play an active part in the national welfare and
 people's livelihood under the leadership of the state-owned
 sector of national economy.  This conforms with the funda-
 mental interests of the working class.
 The trade unions of China are organized along the in-
 dustrial lines, based on democratic centralism.  They must
 take collective leadership, persuasion and education as main
 methods of their work.  They must show concern over the
 interests of the masses, crystallize their views and promote
 criticism and self-criticism.  They must consistently pay at-
 tention to the fight against bureaucracy and commandism
 which separate them from the masses, and at the same time,
 constantly improve the organization and discipline of the
 workers.
 The trade unions of China must constantly educate the
 workers in internationalism and actively take part in the in-
 ternational working-class movement.  They must strive for
 the unity and solidarity of the movement and for the defence
 of lasting peace in the Far East and throughout the world.
