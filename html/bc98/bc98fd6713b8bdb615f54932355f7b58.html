 The purpose of this report is to analyze and assess present and
 proposed agricultural developments in Communist China under the First
 and Second Five Year Plans (1953-57 and 1958-62).  Special emphasis
 is given to investment and to measures for increasing agricultural
 production.
 The analysis of agricultural production in this report is limited
 to grains and cotton.  It is believed that the results obtained from
 an analysis of investment and of measures to increase production repre-
 sent maximum possibilities, and any degree of error inherent in this
 analysis would tend, therefore, to overestimate production.

 AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS
 IN COMMUNIST CHINA*
 1953-62
 The government of Communist China has sought to meet the growing
 needs of an expanding economy through a program for the socialization
 of agriculture.  To implement this program, the Communists have sought
 to eliminate the small independent farmers and to achieve complete
 control over agricultural producers and their products.  The rapid
 organization of agricultural producer cooperatives in 1956 raised the
 percentage of organized farmer households to 96 percent by the end
 of the year, and the program for socialization is almost complete.
 State investment in agriculture under the First Five Year Plan
 (1953-57), however, has been insufficient to achieve the goals for
 agricultural production.  Such investment has comprised only 7.6 per-
 cent of the total investment planned for the period.  This amount
 has not been sufficient to supply the necessary quantities of inputs,
 especially of chemical fertilizers.  In an attempt to resolve this
 problem, the government has transferred the bulk of the burden of in-
 vestment in agriculture to the cooperatives.  Since 1955, cooperative
 farm labor has been utilized intensively on local projects for irriga-
 tion, water conservation, and land reclamation.  The increase in agri-
 cultural production resulting from these local projects accounted for
 more than 60 percent of the increase in the production of grains**
 during 1953-57.  An examination of state and cooperative investments,
 however, indicates that increases in the production of grains during
 1953-57 will enable the Chinese at most to raise the total production
 of grains in 1957 to 185.6 million metric tons,*** or 96 percent of
 the goal of 192.8 million tons announced in the First Five Year Plan.
 *  The estimates and conclusions in this report represent the best
 judgment of ORR as of 1 August 1957.
 **  In Communist China, grains include all cereals, pulses, soybeans,
 and potatoes on a grain-equivalent basis.
 ***  Tonnages are given in metric tons throughout this report.

 CIA-R DP79RO1141A000900050002-4
 The goal of 1.6 million tons for the production of ginned cotton*
 probably will be achieved.
 The limits to which cooperative labor using local investment can
 carry out effectively the proposed project for irrigation, water con-
 servation, and land reclamation should be nearly reached by the end
 of 1962.  Thereafter, such undertakings will require greater amounts
 of capital than can be furnished locally.
 Any significant increases in agricultural production in Communist
 China will depend primarily upon the supply of chemical nitrogenous
 fertilizers.  Requirements for chemical fertilizers have been esti-
 mated at approximately 20 million tons a year, or about 10 times the
 amount consumed in 1956.  Attempts are being made to alleviate this
 deficit by increasing the supply of organic fertilizers.
 It has been stated that increased supplies of chemical fertilizers
 and other inputs required for agricultural production will be provided
 under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) through an increase over the
 amount invested under the First Five Year Plan.  Allowing for the maxi-
 mum utilization of all available inputs under the Second Five Year Plan,
 the production of grains in 1962 probably will not exceed 217.8 million
 tons, or 87 percent of the goal of 250 million tons.  The goal of pro-
 ducing 2.4 million tons of cotton may be achieved.
 Increases in the production of grains through the end of 1962
 probably will be sufficient to maintain the supply per capita of food
 at present levels of consumption.  After 1962, however, unless the
 production of grains can be increased at a rate which equals or exceeds
 the increase in population, Communist China may be forced to become a
 net importer of food.
 The "high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture" which
 was decreed by the Party leadership in Communist China in the latter
 half of 1955 has changed profoundly the structural organization of
 Cotton is reported on a ginned basis throughout this report.

 the agricultural economy and the trend of agricultural development.
 Under the accelerated program for socialization, the government has
 extended state controls in order to expand agricultural production and
 to bolster industrial investment. J
 The failure to achieve agricultural goals in 1953 and 1954 and a
 general pessimistic attitude toward the pace of socialization had led
 to a series of decisions by Mao Tse-tung and the Central Committee of
 the Chinese Communist Party.  The floods of 1954 resulted in a reduc-
 tion of agricultural production, which in turn reduced the production
 of light industry and the hoped-for increases in revenue in 1955. 3
 The projected rates of investment in heavy industry in 1955 required
 substantially increased investment by the agricultural sector of the
 economy.  It was clear that these requirements could be obtained only
 by extending state control over agriculture through the program for
 socialization and through substantially increased agricultural pro-
 duction by means of increased investment.  Mao Tse-tung, in his re-
 port of 31 July 1955, after the relatively limited goals of the First
 Five Year Plan (1953-57) had been accepted by the National Peoples
 Congress, strongly criticized the conservative elements of the Party
 for their lagging efforts on behalf of the program for socialization
 of agriculture and'Ioutlined a new program calling for acceleration
 of socialization. J
 Partly as a result of the enthusiasm stimulated by the drive for
 socialization, a broad agricultural program was announced early in
 1956. J  This program, known as the Twelve Year Draft National Pro-
 gram for Agriculture, outlines several courses of action which are to
 be pursued simultaneously in an ambitious us attempt to increase the pro-
 duction of grains and cotton by 1967. J  The Second Five Year Plan
 (1958-62), although following the operational pattern of the 12-year
 program, is less unrealistic in its specific goals for production.
 As a result of the accelerated program for socialization, 1956
 became a key year for the transition of agriculture from private to
 state control.  The bumper harvest of 1955 largely eliminated the
 difficulties encountered in 1954 by the Party cadres in fulfilling
 plans for the allocation of grains and industrial crops and in or-
 ganizing the farmers into cooperatives.  By the end of 1956, approxi-
 mately 96 percent of the farm households in Commun'i/st China were or-
 ganized into agricultural producer cooperatives. Jl  By means of rapid

 socialization the,surplus of labor on cooperative farms is being uti-
 lized in projects to consolidate small fa;m plots into large fields;
 to construct dikes and ditches for flood control and irrigation; to
 engage in land reclamation; and to consolidate the collection, handling,
 and storing of organic fertilizers.  In addition, socialization is to
 provide the means for the better planning of crop planting and rota-
 tion, the allocation of resources for investment, and the control of
 production through state channels. J
 In presenting his proposals on agriculture for the Second Five
 Year Plan at the Eighth Party Congress in September 1956, Chou En-lai
 reaffirmed the statement by Mao on the indispensability of agri-
 cultural development for the development of heavy industry and of
 the entire national economy. 2/  Increases in agricultural production
 under the Second Five Year Plan were to be achieved through increased
 yields per unit of land. LO/  Although no detailed information as to
 the composition of agricultural investment during this period was
 given, it was estimated that agricultural investment would increase
 from 2.47 billion yuan* under the First Five Year Plan to 7 billion
 '
 yuan under the Second Five Year Plan, an increase of 283 percent. J
 In addition, investment in capital construction for the chemical
 fertilizer industry is to be increased under the Second Five Year
 Plan. 12
 II.  Goals for Production.
 A.  First Five Year Plan (1953-57).
 The over-all goals for agricultural production in Communist
 China during the last 3 years of the First Five Year Plan were out-
 lined in great detail in an important speech by Li Fu-ch'un, Chair-
 man of the State Planning Commission, at a session of the National
 Peoples Congress in July 1955. IV  Li stated that by 1957 the pro-
 duction of grains was to increase to 192.8 million tons, and the pro-
 duction of cotton to 1.6 million tons. 14   The reported and planned
 production of grains and cotton in China in 1952-57 and that planned
 for 1962 are shown in Table 1.**
 *  An acceptable rate of exchange, based on commercial rates of ex-
 change with the pound sterling, is 2.46 yuan to US $1.
 ** Table 1 follows on p. 5.

 Among the specific measures listed by Li for increasing pro-
 duction were the reclamation of arable wasteland; the construction
 of projects for irrigation and water conservation; the increased
 planting of such high-yield crops as rice, corn, and potatoes; the
 increased supply of manure and chemical fertilizers; the introduc-
 tion of improved animal-drawn farm implements; and the elimination
 of insects and pests.
 As a result of the enthusiasm generated by Mao Tse-tung's
 speech of July 1955, goals for agricultural production were reported
 by the New China News Agency (NCNA) on 23 December 1955.  The NCNA
 stated that the First Five Year Plan was to be completed in advance and
 the goals set in July 1955 for production in 1957 were to be reached
 in 1956. 17   The new goal for the production of grains was stated
 as 199.4 million tons, an increase of 6.6 million tons above the
 original goal for 1957. 18   The goal for the production of cotton

 On the basis of data given in September 1956 on the production of
 grains and cotton under the Second Five Year Plan, it appears that
 Chinese Communist officials returned to the goal of the original
 First Five Year Plan as the basis for the new Plan. 21   The revised
 goals were canceled, probably because of the losses in crops result-
 ing from floods and storms in 1956.
 Goals for agricultural production under the Second Five Year
 Plan were reported first on 15 September 1956 and confirmed later by
 various pronouncements made at the Eighth Party Congress.  The produc-
 tion of grains is scheduled to total 250 million tons in 1962, and the
 production of cotton is set at 2.4 million tons. 22
 Under the Second Five Year Plan, emphasis is to be placed on
 the use of cooperative farm labor on small-scale projects for irriga-
 tion and flood control, the improvement of agricultural practices,
 the greater use of natural fertilizers, a small increase in the use
 of chemical fertilizers, an increase in large-scale cultivation by
 the consolidation of small plots into large fields, the increased
 use of improved tools and machinery, and the increased use of better
 seeds and pesticides.  The principal results of the new program are
 to'be realized from the intensive efforts of the cooperatives. L3/
 It is generally admitted by the planners that many rivers which are
 likely to cause havoc cannot be harnessed, that reclamation work on
 a larger scale cannot be undertaken, and that conditions are not
 present for the mechanization of agriculture. L4/
 The programs for investment in agriculture in Communist China
 are carried out by the state and by the farmers.  Investment by the
 state during 1953-62 is being carried out through the First and
 Second Five Year Plans, and investment by the farmers is effected
 through the savings of agricultural producer cooperatives and through
 agricultural loans by the government to the cooperatives and to in-
 dividual farmers.
 The First Five Year Plan called for the investment by the state
 of 2.47 billion yuan for agriculture, water conservation, and for-
 estry.* 25/  This figure is 5.8 percent of total investments scheduled
 Excluding investment in the lumber industry.

 under the First Five Year Plan; the share of industry was scheduled
 to be 58.2 percent.  The Second Five Year Plan is believed to call
 for the investment of approximately 7 billion yuan for agriculture,
 water conservation, and forestry.* 26   This amount is 8.2.percent
 of total investments proposed under the Second Five Year Plan, whereas
 the scheduled share of industry is 60 percent.
 Most of the investments by the state in basic construction for
 agriculture are used for water conservation. /  Relatively small
 sums are spent by the state for land reclamation, the organization,
 of state farms, the mechanization of agricultural operations, and
 the improvement of agricultural techniques through the establishment
 of agro-technique stations and similar organizations.
 In addition to the funds earmarked for investment in agriculture
 under the First and Second Five Year Plans, the state is making limited
 expenditures for building chemical fertilizer plants and agricultural
 equipment plants. 28   The capacity of the proposed chemical fertilizer
 plants, however, will fall short of filling the needs of Communist
 China through 1963.
 Water conservation will receive more emphasis than any other ele-
 ment of the program for basic construction for agriculture in China
 through 1962.  The contribution of the state to this program consists
 for the most part in building very large water control projects which
 will serve for flood control, erosion control, the development of
 hydroelectric power, and the extension of navigation. 29   The'in-
 crease in the area of farmland under irrigation is a minor part of
 this program for water conservation, and only a small part of the
 investment will result directly in increased agricultural production.
 Most of the efforts toward water conservation by the state will have
 long-range effects, diminishing the threat of floods and making water
 available in areas hitherto lacking in water.
 *  The proposed plan called for an investment of about 8.5 billion
 yuan, which presumably includes investment in the lumber industry.  If
 the lumber industry is to have at least the same share of total in-
 vestment under the Second Five Year Plan as under the First Five Year
 Plan, the planned investment in the lumber industry should be about
 1.5 billion Yuan.  This sum should be subtracted from the total of
 8.5 billion yuan in order to compare agricultural investment under
 the First and Second Five Year Plans.

 As for increasing the area of farmland under irrigation, the
 farmers themselves, through the intensive efforts of the coopera-
 tives, will bear most of the burden.  Under the First Five Year Plan,
 about 75 percent of the increase in the area under irrigation has
 been achieved through cooperative labor. 30   The activity of the
 farmers in small-scale projects probably will continue through 1962. Ili
 IV.  Measures to Increase Production.
 A.  Irrigation and Flood Control.
 1.  First Five Year Plan (1953-57).
 The Ministry of Water Conservancy stated that the First
 Five Year Plan originally called for an increase of 2.8 million hec-
 tares* of irrigated fields.  This goal has been raised to 4.8 million
 hectares. 321  Although the expansion of the area under irrigation
 through 195  was reported to be only 1.9 million hectares, 13J it
 appears reasonable that the revised goal for 1957 will be achieved.
 The increases in the area under irrigation in Communist China in
 1952-57 and that planned for 1962 are shown in Table 2.

 Of the planned increase in the area under irrigation by
 the end of 1957, 3.5 million hectares will be devoted to rice, 300,000
 hectares to other grains, and 1 million hectares to cotton. 38
 Detailed information as to the increase in the area under
 irrigation scheduled under the Second Five Year Plan has not been
 reported.     On the basis of the expected increase in investment, how-
 ever, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in the area under
 irrigation will be about 9.6 million hectares, or twice the increase
 achieved under the First Five Year Plan.*
 Projects for water conservation and irrigation have been
 begun on the Yellow and Huai Rivers.  The Yellow River project is
 expected to bring 2.4 million hectares under irrigation by 1967,
 although the final figure is expected to be about 7.7 million hec-
 tares. 39                     It is possible that some increase in irrigation result-
 ing from this project may be available by 1962.
 Considerable progress is being made in local projects
 through the construction of dams and through the digging of wells
 and channels for irrigation.  It is stated that the cooperative,
 movement will assist the projects by providing capital and labor,
 especially because each man must put in 250 work-days and each woman
 120 work-days per year. ILO/  It is expected that about one-third of
 the man-days provided will be available for such work as irrigation,
 land reclamation, and afforestation.  There has been a marked ac-
 celeration of this type of work since the beginning of the drive for
 socialization.
 Of the newly irrigated land planned for 1962, it is esti-
 mated that 7 million hectares will be cultivated to rice, 300,000
 hectares to other grains, and 2.3 million hectares to cotton.
 Irrigation is one of the most effective means of increasing
 agricultural production in Communist China.  Larger increases in yields
 per hectare can be obtained through the use of chemical fertilizers,
 but the cost is much higher, especially when the costs of chemical

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/05/22
 CIA-R DP79RO1141A000900050002-4
 fertilizers are compared with the cost of local projects for irriga-
 tion,* to which very little, if any, state investment is allocated.
 These local projects have accounted for the bulk of the increases in
 irrigation to date, but the extent to which such projects can con-
 tinue to increase production is limited.  In the long run the cost
 of irrigation will be increased by the requirements for construction,
 and the comparative cost in relation to the use of fertilizer prob-
 ably will be reversed.
 The crops most benefited by irrigation are rice and cotton.
 In 1957 these two crops will utilize 94 percent of the increase in the
 area under irrigation and by 1962 about 97 percent.  The remainder of
 the increase will be devoted to other grains.
 The increases in the production of grains resulting from
 the increased area under irrigation probably will total 5.3 million
 ,tons under the First Five Year Plan and 10.3 million tons under the
 Second Five Year Plan.  Of these totals, it is estimated that rice
 will account for 5 million tons under the First Five Year Plan and
 10 million tons under the Second Five Year Plan.  Increases in the
 production of cotton resulting from the increased area under irriga-
 tion are expected to be about 127,.000 tons under the First Five Year
 Plan and 291,000 tons under the Second Five Year Plan.
 The principal deficiency of the soil in Communist China is
 nitrogen.  The increased use of commercial nitrogenous fertilizer's
 probably would be the greatest single factor in improving the yield
 per hectare.  Because of the lack of livestock farming, there is in-
 sufficient natural fertilizer.  Although every scrap of human and
 animal feces is conserved, the traditional use of the material has
 been inefficient.
 The Minister of Agriculture has placed the requirements for
 chemical nitrogenous fertilizers at 20 million tons, 41  a figure
 closely comparable with non-Communist estimates.  Present usage in
 China is only about 10 percent of this amount.  If such a supply
 of chemical fertilizers were available, it is estimated that the
 total cost would be about US $1.1 billion to US $1.4 billion per year. 42
 *  Local projects for irrigation are those involving mainly farm labor
 using simple hand tools to construct wells and ditches for irrigation.

 The most important nitrogenous fertilizer used in Communist
 China is ammonium sulfate, which experiments have proved to be the
 most beneficial to the soil.  Ammonium sulfate probably will account
 for about 98 percent of the supply of nitrogenous fertilizers in China
 during 1953-62.
 The lack of chemical fertilizers in Communist China is
 reflected in the First Five Year Plan.  In 1957 the production of
 chemical nitrogenous fertilizers is expected to reach only about
 548,000 tons. /  Although no plan for imports was announced, it
 is estimated that approximately 1.85 million tons will be imported.
 The total supply of chemical fertilizers in 1957 would therefore be
 about 2.4 million tons, an increase of about 2 million tons over 1952.
 The supply of chemical fertilizers in Communist China in 1952-57,
 that planned for 1962, and the estimated probable supply in 1962
 are shown in Table 3.*
 The goals for the production of phosphate fertilizers in
 1957 were not given, but is is estimated that about 400,000 tons prob-
 ably will be made available by 1957, an increase of more than 390,000
 tons over 1952.
 In 1955, state investment in the chemical industry was
 scheduled to increase over the previous year, and two-thirds of the
 amount invested in the industry was allocated for chemical ferti-
 lizers. L4/  Three new plants were to be built and two others were
 to be reconstructed by 1957.
 The goal for the production of chemical fertilizers in
 1962, 3.0 million to 3.2 million tons, is more than five times the goal
 for production in 1957. 45   Details of the program for the produc-
 tion of chemical fertilizers under the Second Five Year Plan are not
 available, but the program appears to be controlled by a limited
 budget rather than by the requirements of vigorous agricultural
 development.  The First Five Year Plan called for the construction
 of plants to produce nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers, and there
 is no indication that any additional construction of plants to produce

 nitrogenous fertilizers is planned.  Current construction of such plants
 is devoted primarily to the expansion of existing facilities or the
 building of byproduct facilities at steel plants, both of which are
 considerably less expensive than new construction.  Any additional new
 construction of plants to produce nitrogenous fertilizers under the
 Second Five Year Plan would have to be started soon because the Chinese
 Communists say that it requires 5 or 6 years to construct such a plant.

 In most cases the phosphate fertilizers planned for 1962
 apparently are to be produced by the simple method of grinding phos-
 phate rock into granular form, although this type of fertilizer con-
 tains much less nutrient value than other chemical fertilizers.  The
 construction of facilities for producing phosphate fertilizer of this
 type requires relatively less capital investment than is necessary
 for the more complex process of producing nitrogenous fertilizers.
 It is estimated that of the approximately 3 million tons of chemical
 fertilizers which will be produced annually by 1962, 1.8 million tons
 will consist of phosphate fertilizers and 1.2 million tons of nitro-
 genous fertilizers.
 Although the supply of chemical fertilizers in Communist
 China has been increased, only a small portion of the total area un-
 der cultivation will be fertilized soon.  Distribution will continue
 to be on a priority basis, with major emphasis given to rice, cotton,
 high-yielding grain crops such as corn, and technical crops such as
 tobacco.  By far the greatest quantity will go to rice.  Numerous
 experiments conducted in China have shown that the increased yield
 per hectare from the use of. nitrogenous fertilizers is extremely good,
 particularly in the alluvial areas on which most of the paddy rice is
 cultivated.
 The increase in the supply of chemical fertilizers under
 the First Five Year Plan will make possible an estimated increase in
 the production of grains of about 4.6 million tons, of which rice
 will account for 4.4 million tons.  The production of cotton will in-
 crease about 75,000 tons during the 5-year period.
 The probable increase in the supply of chemical fertilizers
 under the Second Five Year Plan will make possible an increase in the
 production of grains of about 5.7 million tons, including 4 million tons
 of rice, and an increase in the production of cotton of about 176,000
 tons.
 The principal fertilizers used in Communist China today are
 organic fertilizers, especially night soil and manure.  River and
 pond mud, oilseed cake, and vegetable wastes are also used extensively.
 For centuries, Chinese farmers have depended upon these fertilizers to

 CIA-R DP79RO1141A000900050002-4
 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/05/22
 CIA-R DP79RO1141A000900050002-4
 maintain the fertility of the soil because the steady depletion of
 soil nutrients through the ages has necessitated the intensive use
 of all types of organic fertilizers.  As a result of the use of
 organic fertilizers, the farmers of China have been able to maintain
 relatively high yields compared with those of other countries in
 Asia.  Because of the poor diet of both animals and people in China,
 the quality of night soil and manure is not good and is particu-
 larly lacking in nitrogen.  As a result of this poor quality, a larger
 quantity of organic fertilizers is required to maintain or to raise
 the yield per hectare than is the case with chemical fertilizers.
 Although organic fertilizers are used extensively throughout
 Communist China and painstaking efforts are made to collect every
 scrap of waste, there is considerable loss because of improper
 handling and storage.  The government has been acutely aware of this
 problem, and much emphasis has been placed ed on improving the methods
 of collection, handling, and storage. 53  Because chemical ferti-
 lizers will not be available in sufficient quantity to meet agri-
 cultural needs of China within the next 10 to 15 years, it will be
 necessary to increase the supply of organic fertilizers in order to
 achieve the goals for agricultural production.  Under both the First
 and Second Five Year Plans the local governments and agricultural
 producer cooperatives are given the responsibility of supplying the
 bulk of the needed organic fertilizers through the increased breeding
 of livestock and the planting of green manure crops. 54/
 By the end of the First Five Year Plan the increase in the
 supply of organic fertilizers will make possible an increase in the
 production of grains of 6 million tons, of which 2.6 million tons
 probably will consist of rice.  Under the Second Five Year Plan the
 estimated increase in the supply of organic fertilizers will make
 possible an increase in the production of grains of 9.3 million tons,
 including 1 million tons of rice.
 Estimates of the uncultivated arable land in Communist China
 vary widely, perhaps understandably, because only about 11 percent of
 the total land area is cultivated.  The government claims that there`~~
 are 100 million hectares of arable land available for cultivation. L5
 This is almost certainly an overstatement because most surveys made
 in China before the Communists assumed control indicated that there
 were only about 30 to 50 million hectares which might be reclaimed,

 CIA-R DP79RO1141A000900050002-4
 including 20 million hectares of land suitable for double cropping.
 According to a survey made in 1940 by the Manchukuo government,
 Manchuria has a total of 16.4 million hectares of uncultivated arable
 land.  The fertility of this land is low, however, and development
 would depend upon improvements in the soil.  It is claimed that
 Sinkiang, the other major area under consideration, has 17.5 million
 hectares of wasteland available for reclamation. 56   The key factor
 to the successful cultivation of this land would be irrigation.
 Smaller areas of reclaimable wasteland are said to exist in many of
 the traditional agricultural areas of China, prithsrily in Fukien,
 Kansu, Kiangsi, Kiangsu, Kwangtung, and Tsinghai. 2/
 1.  First Five Year Plan (1953-57).
 The minimum goal established by the First Five Year Plan
 for the expansion of the area under cultivation was about 2.6 million
 hectares. 58   Most of the reclamation was scheduled to be done by
 state farms established in areas containing large tracts of wasteland.
 The means planned for achieving this expansion were the employment of
 machinery and the resettlement of population from heavily populated
 areas.  The increases in the area under cultivation in Communist China
 in 1952-57 and that planned for 1962 are shown in Table 4.*
 The increase of 2.6 million hectares in the area under
 cultivation planned for 1957 would represent an increase of less than
 2.5 percent more than the area under cultivation in 1952.  The Land
 Utilization Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture announced in November
 1955 that 1.6 million hectares of wasteland had been reclaimed during
 1953-55, principally in Heilungkiang.  The same report stated that
 "due to the growth of cooperative farming," the goal for land reclama-
 tion by 1957 had been raised from 2.6 million hectares to 5 million
 hectares. _59/
 On the basis of the progress made through 1956, it appears
 that the area reclaimed by the end of 1957 will be approximately 4.5
 million hectares, or 500,000 hectares short of the revised goal of 5
 million hectares set by the Five Year Plan.  The failure to achieve
 the revised.goal will be due primarily to a shortage in farm machinery
 and other capital equipment necessary for large-scale land reclamation.
 It has been estimated that the cost of reclaiming land runs about
 600 to 750 yuan per hectare. 60   The investment of 2.47 billion yuan

 Year Plan probably will not permit the expenditures necessary for
 large-scale reclamation projects at this time.  Progress to date has
 been due primarily to the intensive efforts of cooperative members on
 easily accessible land.
 Grains will account for approximately 3.8 million hectares

 The Second Five Year Plan calls for an increase in arable
 land of 5.6 million hectares, a gain of 5 percent over 1957. L6/  No
 detailed information has been released regarding the amount of capital
 investment which will be made available for this purpose.
 It is estimated that 3.9 million hectares of this increase
 in arable land will be sown to grains and 1.7 million hectares to
 cotton.
 Since most of the new land being reclaimed is too far
 north for double cropping and is of questionable fertility, the yield
 of grain probably will be no more than 1 ton per hectare.  Such a
 yield would result in a maximum increase in the production of grains
 of about 3.8 million tons under the First Five Year Plan and 3.9 mil-
 lion tons under the Second Five Year Plan.  Increases in the produc-
 tion of cotton due to increased area under cultivation is estimated
 at 128,000 tons under the First Five Year Plan and 298,000 tons un-
 der the Second Five Year Plan.
 E.  Mechanization.
 1.  First Five Year Plan (1953-57).
 According to the First Five Year Plan, there are to be
 290 machine tractor stations with 8,400 tractors*aand 141 mechanized
 state farms with 5,146 tractors, a total of 13,546 tractors, by the
 end of 1957. 67/  The number of tractors in Communist China, by type
 of organization, in 1952-57 and the estimated number in 1962 are
 shown in Table 5.**
 Through the end of 1956, all tractors came from the Soviet
 Bloc, with imports amounting to between 3,000 and 4,000 a year.  Im-
 ports are expected to increase to at least 5,000 in 1957 and to a
 higher figure later. L8/
 Plans to produce heavier and more complicated equipment
 such as tractors, reapers, and combines in Communist China are still

 in an early stage, and the production of these types probably will
 remain insignificant for the next few years.
 Under the First Five Year Plan, mechanization has played
 a very minor role in agricultural production.  By the end of 1956,
 only 1.3 million hectares, or 1.2 percent of the farmland, in Communist
 China were cultivated by tractors. 79
 2.  Second Five Year Plan (1958-62).
 As of the end of 1956, the Chinese Communist leaders had
 made no commitments as to the goals for mechanization under the Second

 Five Year Plan.  Under the Twelve Year Draft National Program for Agri-
 culture, the Minister of Agriculture aimed at mechanizing 47 percent
 of the total farmland by 1967.  The total demand for tractors was
 placed at 1.2 million to 1.5 million, with replacements at the rate
 of 120,000 to 130,000 a year. LO/
 Such a demand would require a park of 170,000 tractors
 in 1962 and 450,000 in 1967, entailing the addition of about 60,000
 tractors per year. 81   It appears, however, that the Chinese Com-
 munists intend to limit the production of tractors to factories now
 being built.  This policy would cause the production to become stable
 by 1960 at about 22,500 tractors a year.  The result would be a more
 gradual buildup in the number of tractors from about 11,000 in 1956
 to about 75,000 in 1960 and to possibly 125,000 by 1962. 82
 A tractor park of this size might allow as much as 13
 percent of the present area under cultivation to be mechanized by
 1962.  Since new land will be brought under cultivation in the mean-
 time, the percentage of the area to be mechanized will be reduced
 proportionately.  It is doubtful whether more than 10 percent of the
 area under cultivation will be mechanized by 1962.
 A tractor park of 125,000 units would be insufficient to
 carry out the larger projects for land-development upon which the
 Draft National Program for Agriculture had depended for significant
 increases in production.  Such projects are unlikely to be undertaken
 until after the conclusion of the Second or possibly the Third Five
 Year Plan (1963-67).  This is apparently in line with the statement
 by Chou En-Lai to the Eighth Party Congress, in which he placed little
 emphasis on mechanization as a means of increasing agricultural pro-
 duction under the Second Five Year Plan.
 Because of the methods of intensive cultivation employed
 by the Chinese farmer, it is highly unlikely that mechanization will
 improve the yields of crops, although the productivity of labor may
 be raised.   Until the surplus manpower in the rural areas of Communist
 China can be absorbed by industry and other occupations, however,
 savings in labor will not be significant.  In any event, the cultiva-
 tion of rice does not lend itself readily to mechanization.  In grow-
 ing wheat, coarse grains, and vegetables, machinery can be utilized
 more effectively.  Manchuria, Northwest China, and the North China
 plain are suited to a high degree of mechanization.

 F.  Modern Farm Implements.
 The provision of better hand-drawn and horse-drawn implements
 probably is more important to the Chinese Communists than is mechaniza-
 tion.                Because of the clumsy and crude farm tools used, the working
 efficiency of Chinese human and animal labor is low.  The primitive plow
 used by the farmer and his ancestors for decades does slow work and does
 not plow deeply or break the earth properly.  A supply of modern hand
 tools and animal-drawn or mechanical implements is essential.  The
 government is aware of this problem and is striving to increase the
 production of modern agricultural implements. Requirements for 1956
 and 1957 placed a heavy strain on the comparatively underdeveloped
 agricultural equipment industry of Communist China, and it will be
 some years before the type of equipment needed can be produced in any-
 thing approaching adequate quantities.
 The plan for this industry in 1956, as originally announced,
 called for the production of about 3.5 million animal-drawn and man-
 powered implements of 10 standard types, together with a large num-
 ber of hand tools of 60 improved designs. L3/  Before the end of 1955,
 however, the decision to accelerate the tempo of agricultural develop-
 ment necessitated a considerable upward revision of these goals.  The
 industry was called upon to produce 5 million plows in 1956, mainly
 of the double-furrow type, as well as 1 million lighter plows; 70,000
 harrows; 110,000 sowing, threshing, and other similar machines; and
 860,000 water-raising wheels. 84   In June 1956, plans for the pro-
 duction of plows were revised downward, however, to 2.5 million units,
 reportedly because of shortages in the supply of steel. L5J
 The Chinese Communist press has devoted much editorial space
 to reports of production of the "two-wheeled, double-bladed plow" and
 the "two-wheeled, single-bladed plow."  Most of the new plows delivered
 in 1955 arrived in the latter part of the year and were not available
 in appreciable numbers at plowing time.  The most recent claims indi-
 cate that production in 1955 amounted to less than 800,000 plows, of
 which fewer than 438,000 were reported to have reached the prospective
 users. 86
 Although state-operated factories throughout Communist China
 are producing two-wheeled plows* and the use of these plows is en-
 couraged by the government, adequate draft power has not been avail-
 able in many instances.  The two-wheeled plow has the advantages of

 plowing deeply, breaking up the earth properly, and working at a good
 rate.  On the other hand, stronger draft power is necessary.  The
 strength and numbers of present breeds of livestock have not been
 suitable.  Two to three work animals are necessary to pull this type
 of plow.  Unless the vitality of the work animals is improved and un-
 less their numbers are increased, the rapid utilization of modern im-
 plements cannot be expected.  In an attempt to improve this situation,
 the government is striving to increase the number of draft animals,
 but the program has proceeded very slowly.  The number of draft animals
 in 1955 was only 2.8 percent greater than in 1954, and the number in
 1956 was only 0.2 percent greater than in 1955.
 The two-wheeled plow not only has inadequate draft power but
 is complicated to assemble and cannot be used on hilly or irrigated
 fields.  Moreover, most farmers do not know how to use the plow.
 Finally, spare parts are not generally available. 88
 It is claimed that deep plowing can increase yields by 10
 percent.  Until modern implements are made generally available,
 however, along with sufficient draft power, only a slight increase
 in yields can be expected by 1962.
 Communist China has suffered continually from agricultural
 losses caused by pests and plant diseases which have resulted in
 famines every year in many areas.  It has been estimated that the
 annual loss caused by pests and plant diseases averages about 20
 percent of the grain crops and about 30 percent of the cotton crop.
 The only definite long-range program announced by the Chinese
 Communists for the control of plant pests and diseases was described
 in the Twelve Year Draft National Program for Agriculture.  This Plan
 called for the elimination of pests and plant diseases by 1967, start-
 ing with a drive to exterminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes.
 In 1956 the state planned to set up 118 stations to report and
 forecast the incidence of pests and plant diseases as well as 4,000 to
 5,000 Pest and Disease Intelligence Points and 1,200 Basic Level Pest
 and Disease Extermination Centers. ?/  Soviet technical advice has been
 sought, and the USSR has helped with the spraying of insecticides from
 aircraft.

 The success of any program for controlling pests and plant
 diseases depends largely upon the supply of insecticides and fungi-
 cides.                  More than 500,000 tons of insecticides were supplied in
 1956, but this amount averages only about 1 ton per 200 hectares.
 There is plenty of raw material for the production of fungicides,
 but it is questionable whether the government is prepared to or-
 ganize industrial capacity on a sufficiently large scale.
 It is impossible to achieve the goal of eradicating all the
 pests and plant diseases in Communist China in 12 years.  The loss
 of grains might be reduced, however, by 5 to 10 percent over this
 period, and the loss of cotton by about 25 to 50 percent.
 The Chinese Communists are taking a keen interest in the
 breeding of plants and are planning to distribute selected seeds
 throughout the country.  It was claimed that 12.5 million hectares,
 one-eighth of the area devoted to grains, would be sown to selected
 seeds in 1956~an~d that 2 million hectares would be sown to selected
 cotton seed. ZJ0
 Any increase in production resulting from improved varieties
 of seeds will not be significant.  The effects of new varieties
 generally result in qualitative improvements.  To the extent that
 new varieties increase the resistance of plants to disease and there-
 by reduce losses, increases in production can be achieved.  No improve-
 ments, either quantative or qualitative, can be achieved, however, un-
 til such new varieties are distributed to the farmers throughout Com-
 munist China in sufficient quantities to replace the old varieties.
 Estimated increases in the production of grains and cotton result-
 ing from measures to increase production in Communist China in 1953-62
 are shown in Table 6.*  Barring natural calamities and assuming aver-
 age weather conditions, the special measures taken to improve agri-
 cultural production in Communist China probably will serve to in-
 crease the production of grain by 21.7 million tons under the First
 Five Year Plan and by 32.2 million tons under the Second Five Year
 Plan.  Such increases would raise the production of grains to

 185.6 million tons in 1957, or 96 percent of the goal of the First
 Five Year Plan, and 217.8 million tons by 1962, or 87 percent of the
 goal of the Second Five Year Plan.
 The measures to increase agricultural production discussed above
 would also make possible an increase in the production of cotton of
 330,000 tons under the First Five Year Plan and 765,000 tons under
 the Second Five Year Plan.  Such increases would result in the ful-
 fillment of the goals for the production of cotton of 1.6 million
 tons in 1957 and 2.4 million tons in 1962.  A comparison of reported
 and planned production of grains and cotton with probable production
 of grains and cotton in Communist China in 1952-57 and 1962 is shown
 in Table 7.*
 Regardless of official enthusiasm regarding the program for
 socialization and the measures to increase agricultural production,
 it appears doubtful whether the Chinese Communists can achieve their
 planned goals for the production of grains.  Increases in the pro-
 duction of grains will fall short of the goals of the First Five Year
 Plan and still further short of the goals of the Second Five Year
 Plan.  On the other hand, the goals for the production of cotton prob-
 ably will be attained.

 The success achieved thus far in increasing agricultural production
 in Communist China has resulted primarily from the adoption of the
 easiest measures, such as local projects, without investing adequate
 capital in materials, such as chemical fertilizers, which will be
 essential later.  The lack of sufficient chemical fertilizers is the
 primary reason for the probable failure to achieve the goals of the
 Second Five Year Plan for the production of grains.
 Mao Tze-tung emphasized that the basic premise of the Chinese
 Communists in undertaking the collectivization of agriculture and
 in intensifying efforts to increase agricultural production through
 the cooperatives was to expand both the proportions and the absolute
 amounts of grains and technical crops passing through state trading
 channels in order to support the program for industrialization.  It
 is clear that the progress made toward socialization in 1956 is an
 important step in achieving increased control over agriculture.
 The new emphasis on rapidly extending socialization in order to
 enforce the adoption of measures for increasing production, as well

 as for maximizing agricultural procurement, may result in substantial
 progress toward the realization of Chinese Communist goals.  It will
 require a number of years, however, to gauge effectively the success
 of the program for socialization, and in evaluating the results it
 will be difficult to separate the effects of socialization upon agri-
 cultural production from such natural factors as weather.  In any
 event, the achievement of significant increases in agricultural pro-
 duction will depend primarily upon the extent to which the government
 is willing to invest in the program, particularly on the extent of
 the investment in chemical nitrogenous fertilizers.
 The increases in the production of grain through the end of the
 Second Five Year Plan should be sufficient to maintain the supply of
 food per capita at present levels of consumption.  After 1962, how-
 ever, unless production can be increased at a rate which equals or
 exceeds the rate of growth in population, which is now 1.5 to 2 per-
 cent per year, Communist China may be forced to become a net importer
 of food.
