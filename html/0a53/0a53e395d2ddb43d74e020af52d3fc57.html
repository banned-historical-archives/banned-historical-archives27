 Inter-Korean Proposals
 and Dialogue:
 An Analytical Chronology
 North and South Korea will be no closer to their respective goals for a re-
 unified nation as they mark the 40th anniversary of their division this year.
 The gap between the two societies and political systems continues to widen,
 making most outside observers view "peaceful reunification" as unrealistic.
 Emotional and political. attachment to the idea; however, remains strong on
 both sides of the Demilitarized Zone. The two Koreas held unsuccessful
 talks during 1972-73 and 1980; last year, they embarked on their third
 round of direct public discussions. It is a halting dialogue so far and
 progress is elusive
 Motivations in Pyongyang
 Kim 11-song's determination to reunite the peninsula under his leadership
 has been the prime objective of North Korean foreign and domestic policy.
 The record attests to P'yongyang's considerable efforts, ranging from the
 outright attack on the South in 1950 and attempts on the life of two South
 Korean presidents to a fitful dialogue with the South during the 1970sF_
 A number of considerations appear to be behind P'yongyang's current    25X1
 interest in negotiations. North Korea has been trying over the past year to
 engage the United States in direct contacts through a tripartite formula
 involving South Korea. The North Koreans want to negotiate an end to the
 US troop presence in South Korea-long viewed as the key deterrent to a
 North Korean attack on the South. The North takes the view that on
 military matters the United States exercises ultimate authority in the
 South, hence the need for direct discussions with Washington:
 nonmilitary issues.
 ? North Korea reads into Washington's position the prospect for tripartite
 discussions in the future if the inter-Korean dialogue gets under way on
 In our view, other considerations play a role in P'yongyang's thinking as
 well, including developments that appear to be working against the North's
 interests:
 ? Seoul's economic success and close ties to the United States give it most
 of the economic and political cards, and P'yongyang may feel compelled
 to renew discussions in an effort to.regain some initiative.

 ? P'yongyang may also feel it is losing ground in the region, particularly as
 China improves its ties with Japan and the West. Greater flexibility in
 the Sino-Soviet relationship is another new element in North Korea's
 operating environment.
 As Kim 11-song, 73, moves ahead with his 12-year campaign to groom his
 son, Kim Chong-il, to replace him, internal developments appear to be
 playing a role as well.
 the elder Kim may feel obliged
 to implement potentially controversial foreign policy changes before pass-
 ing the baton. On the economic side, North Korea ended its 1978-84
 Seven-Year Plan considerably short of its goals. This can'only aggravate
 P'yongyang's concern over the growing economic gap with the South.
 ... And in Seoul
 South Korea has been far more willing to meet North Korean initiatives
 head-on since President Chun took office in 1980. Once North Korea
 indicated its interest in discussions during the delivery of flood relief in
 September last year, Seoul almost immediately produced three proposals of
 its own. President Chun appears to have a good grasp of the emotional at-
 tachment to the idea of a reunified Korea and of the political advantages
 that accrue to him when he leans forward on the issue:
 Seoul's positive approach toward opening up a dialogue with the North
 helps strengthen Seoul's standing among allies and friends, especially in
 Washington and Tokyo.
 ? South Korea undoubtedly has its eye on other considerations, including
 international gatherings such as the 1986 Asian Games and 1988
 Summer Olympics, which it wishes to stage with broad participation. To
 the extent that Seoul appears forthcoming toward P'yongyang, it dimin-
 ishes potential Communist obstacles to attending those events in Seoul.
 Even so, Seoul fears that the risks in fostering dialogue may be greater
 than the potential gains:
 ? It is particularly concerned that a North Korea that is seen as less
 threatening will parlay talks with the South into direct contacts with the
 United States.

 ? Seoul both fears a lessening of the US security commitment and opposes
 any warming of US-North Korean relations without something in return
 from P'yongyang's Communist allies in Moscow and Beijing.
 ? Recently he has proposed a more modest beginning in which Japan and
 China initiate overt and reciprocal trade links with the two Koreas.
 Cross =Recognition Proposals
 South Korean concern that efforts to reduce tensions not benefit North
 Korea disproportionately, in our view, underlies Chun's interest in cross-
 recognition-a plan calling, for Chinese and Soviet recognition of Seoul in
 exchange for US and Japanese recognition of P'yongyang. Chun seems to
 realize that full diplomatic recognition of the two Koreas by the major
 powers is an unrealistic objective at this stage and is advocating a two-
 tiered process beginning with Japan and China, bringing in the United
 States and the Soviet Union later:
 In focusing first on China and Japan, Chun is seeking to capitalize on
 China's unofficial contacts with South Korea and at the same time to slow
 Japanese moves toward North Korea:
 ? China's growing contacts with South Korea are especially evident in
 nonpolitical areas. In 1984, trade between Seoul and Beijing-most of it
 still indirect-rose to an estimated $675 million. The two sides have dealt
 on an official level to handle hijacking incidents over the past two years,
 and South Korean athletes and officials now regularly attend internation-
 al gatherings in China.
 ? Opposition parties and business interests in Japan have increased unoffi-
 cial contacts with North Korea over the past six months, and there are
 signs of behind-the-scenes efforts that could lead to an exchange of
 private trade offices between the two countries.
 Outlook
 Both sides held preliminary discussions in November 1984 on potential
 economic and humanitarian exchanges. The defection of a Soviet diplomat-
 ic trainee to the South at Panmunjom in late November prompted the
 North to postpone the next set of discussions scheduled for December. In
 January, P'yongyang again postponed contacts using the pretext of the

 annual US-South Korean military exercise Team Spirit. With the winding
 down of Team Spirit in early April, P'yongyang indicated its willingness to
 resume the dialogue:
 ? Official economic talks,.which could lead to some low-level trade, are set
 for 17 May in Panmunjom.
 ? Semiofficial Red Cross talks, due to convene on 28 May in Seoul, and
 thereafter to alternate between the two capitals, will focus on issues
 regarding divided families.
 The months since the current round of talks began have brought changes in
 South Korean domestic politics that could affect the way Seoul and
 P'yongyang negotiate. With the emergence of a confrontational opposition
 in South Korea, domestic politics have entered a new period of tension and
 uncertainty. The leadership in Seoul probably will develop a more defen-
 sive mentality and heighten its suspicion about P'yongyang's intentions.
 For its, part, the North will be carefully reading developments in the South
 for any openings it might exploit:
 ? North Korea's proposal early this month for interparliamentary contacts,
 which would embrace South Korean opposition politicians, is an early
 indicator of this approach.
 ? Seoul may yet respond favorably, if only to be seen as flexible, but it will
 view such talks as having no utility and chiefly increasing the likelihood
 of polarizing domestic debate over its approach to the inter-Korean
 dialogue.

 1945-66: Emergence   National division, abortive efforts to reunify the peninsula under UN
 and Consolidation of formulas, and finally Kim I1-song's bid to reunify Korea by force during
 Separate Governments  '1950-53 give way to a period during which the two Korean states
 consolidate themselves politically and economically. South Korea, empha-
 sizing "economic construction first, reunification later," lacks as fully
 articulated a reunification policy as North Korea. P'yongyang floats
 proposals for a confederation of the two Koreas and pursues a strategy of
 strengthening North Korea's political, economic, and military might while
 attempting to build an underground Marxist-Leninist political organiza-
 tion in the South.

 Dialogue             among the major powers might lead to some form of political arrangement
 imposed from the outside. The two sides float initiatives leading to
 humanitarian contacts through the Red Cross societies, while secret
 political talks in both capitals culminate in the joint communique of 4 July
 1972. Deep distrust and differing goals cause the dialogue to peter out
 after several more sessions in the fall of 1972. Lower-level contacts,
 however, continue within the Red Cross channel until 1978 and the South-
 North Coordinating Committee channel until 1975.
 Beyond merely seeking to head off an outside settlement, both sides see the
 dialogue as a means to pursue their own ends:
 ? For P'yongyang, the talks allow it to showcase its reunification policy,
 both to the South Korean people and the world at large. The contacts also
 hold out the prospect that reduced tensions might induce the United
 States to withdraw its troops from the South. Meanwhile, P'yongyang
 keeps its options open by engaging in a secret military buildup and
 digging infiltration tunnels.
 ? Seoul, by contrast, approaches the dialogue seeking to limit damage to its
 position-externally by not ceding the reunification field to North Korea
 and internally by preventing domestic opponents from exploiting the
 issue. Park Chung Hee ultimately uses the dialogue to consolidate and
 then extend his power at home under the Yushin Constitution.

 1984-Present:      A North Korean bid for tripartite talks with Washington and Seoul
 Tripartite         emerges through the Chinese virtually at the same time as the Rangoon in-
 Talks and a                               cident. Over the next year, North Korea presents an image of flexibility on
 Fitful Dialogue    the question as it presses for a favorable response and seeks to repair
 damage to its international image. The goal, to engage the United States
 directly and remove US troops from the South, remains constant.
 North-South dialogue resumes when P'yongyang proposes discussions to
 field a joint team to the Los Angeles Olympics. The short leadtime and
 South Korean distrust of North Korean motivations work against progress
 during the three meetings held. North Korea announces it will join the
 Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics as Kim 11-song is on a
 trip to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, presaging greater attention
 by P'yongyang to its relations with Moscow. A few months later, a North
 Korean offer of flood relief and Seoul's acceptance of that offer set the
 stage for a new round of economic and Red Cross contacts. P'yongyang
 carefully paces the two sets of talks with an eye on the larger goal of tripar-
 tite talks. Seoul's attention, meanwhile, is increasingly distracted by
 domestic political problems and tensions in its relations with Washington
 that could make it less willing to take political risks in its dealings with the
 North.
