 WESTERN EUROPE: Nuclear Power
 //A  number of West European governments are facing
 increased political and legal barriers to the development of
 Approved Fo
 Approved Fo
 nuclear power. Prolonged ZegaZ battles, protest demonstrations,
 and renewed calls for nuclear moratoriums are gaining momentum.
 Most governments, however, are determined to press ahead with
 their nuclear power programs. Because of Long Lead times,  de-
 cisions on nuclear power made in the next year or two will af-
 fect the growth of nuclear energy in the mid-.1980s.11
 //Large protest demonstrations have taken place
 recently in       rance and West Germany. Reporting from West Ger-
 many suggests growing public disenchantment about the value of
 further nuclear development. Legal battles over construction
 sites, safety, and environmental considerations are coming on
 top of other lawsuits dealing with radioactive waste disposal,
 reprocessing,  licensing, and regulation. One lawsuit is con-
 testing the entire legal foundation of the West German nuclear
 energy authority.//
 //Environmental and ecological groups in France
 are following similar tactics and are planning to enter anti-
 nuclear candidates in the national election next March.//
 //In Sweden, the political battle over nuclear
 power    a   arose during the election campaign last year is
 continuing.  Swedish Prime Minister Falldin remains strongly
 opposed to the use of nuclear power but has been forced to
 compromise with its proponents by promising further studies of
 nuclear waste disposal. In Belgium and Switzerland, public dis-
 cussion is under way on the merits of a nuclear moratorium. As
 yet, however, these discussions have not developed the broad
 public support that is becoming apparent in West Germany and,
 to a lesser degree,  in France.//
 1         '7      //The growing public debate about the efficiency
 and desirability of nuclear power has already caused a slow-
 down in nuclear power programs. These delays, coupled with
 lower forecasts of total electricity demand and the rapidly
 increasing costs of nuclear power plants, have substantially
 reduced expectations of nuclear energy availability in 1985.
 Projected nuclear electric generating capacity in non-Communist
 countries is now expected to grow from about 73,000 megawatts
 in 1977 to about 252,000 megawatts in 1985--less than one-half
 the amount projected in 1970.//
 //Nuclear power in countries that are members of
 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will
 provide the equivalent of about 6.2 million barrels per day of

 oil in 1985, or about 6 percent of their total energy consump-
 tion. With energy demand continuing to grow,, the nuclear share
 of total energy consumption will decline by the late 1980s un-
 less nuclear power plant construction accelerates in the near
 future. F77             I
 INDIA:  Ghandi's Position Stronger
 The Indian Government's recent actions  against for-
 mer Prime Minister Gandhi appear likely to result,  at least
 temporarily,  in strengthening her position.
 I    I Gandhi was arrested on Monday on charges that in-
 cluded taking a bribe for granting an oil drilling contract
 to a French firm. The government may have expected the initial
 hearing to be pro forma, but Gandhi refused bail and the mag-
 istrate released her unconditionally on the grounds that the
 government had presented no evidence to support its charges.
 Home Minister Charan Singh--who probably pushed hardest for
 action against Gandhi--later admitted to the, press that there
 was no proof against her in the bribery case:.
 Gandhi has accused the government of conducting a
 vendetta. All factions of the opposition Congress Party have
 announced their support for her, and the incident may well al-
 low her to dominate a special session of the party's ruling
 body to be held next week.
 Although some ruling party officials believe the
 government erred in bringing the charges, the government now
 seems to have little choice but to pursue the case and is ap-
 pealing her release to a higher court. The incident has clearly
 hurt the credibility of the government, but it still appears
 unlikely that its control of parliament will be affected.
 Charan Singh has probably been hurt most by the case
 ,
 but he is far too strong to be removed from office easily. His
 rivals among the party leaders are unlikely -to risk splitting
 the party by attacking him openly.                                             25X1
 ITALY: Local Elections Postponed
 The decision this week by Italian political  leaders
 to postpone the November local elections until next spring will
 Approved F
 Approved For Re
 enhance the stability of Prime Minister Andreotti 's Christian
 Democratic minority government.  The approaching electoral cam-
 paign had presented the most immediate threat to cooperative
 relations between Andreotti's party and the Communists, whose
 parliamentary abstention is crucial to the government's sur-
 vival.
 I             Although the elections involve only about 10 percent
 of the electorate, they would have provided the most signifi-
 cant test of voter sentiment since the 1976 parliamentary elec-
 tion,  in which the Communists scored unprecedented gains. The
 elections will now be held concurrently with another round of
 local contests in May or June. The decision to hold the two
 sets of elections simultaneously is being cast as an effort to
 make the electoral process more efficient.
 Although that consideration did play a role in the
 decision, party leaders were more influenced by the political
 advantages of a postponement.
 I          I The Communist leadership, on the other hand,  feared
 a  an   losses would slow the party's momentum and make it
 even more difficult to keep the rank and file united behind
 Communist chief Berlinguer's policy of cooperation with Andre-
 otti. For their part, the Socialists and some of the smaller
 parties wanted more time to rebuild their campaign organiza-
 tions,  fearing that any voting now would show a further gravi-
 tation of the electorate toward the two large parties.
 Since the decision reflects the will of the major
 party leaderships, parliamentary approval of the delay seems
 assured. There is resistance to the decision, however, within
 the Christian Democrats' parliamentary delegation and within
 some of the smaller parties. Christian Democrats, who dislike
 the idea, argue that their party needs a tough campaign at this
 time to counter what they regard as a steady drift toward closer
 relations with the Communists.
 Many critics also emphasize their concern for democ-  25X1
 racy in Italy and stress that the parties are setting a danger-
 ous precedent by postponing an election because they are nervous
 about the possible results.

 NAMIBIA:  Rare SWAPO Meeting
 I          The administrator-general for Namibia appointed by
 South Africa has announced that the South-West Africa People's
 Organization will be allowed to hold a meeting in OvamboZand
 on Sunday, its first meeting there in five years.
 I          I SWAPO's political power is based on the Ovambo tribe,
 w is  males up over half of Namibia's population. Participation
 in the meeting presumably will be limited to the so-called in-
 ternal wing of SWAPO, which is permitted to operate inside
 Namibia. The relationship of the internal wing to SWAPO Presi-
 dent Sam Nujoma and to the guerrilla forces has never been
 very clear, although SWAPO political cadre inside Namibia cer-
 tainly intend to be part of any SWAPO-dominated government that
 comes to power.
 The short notice given for the Sunday meeting probably
 is intended to make it difficult for SWAPO guerrillas to partici-
 pate. The size and character of the meeting may provide some in-
 dication of the current state of    APO's appeal in Ovamboland.
 USSR: Constitution and Kuznetsov
 The USSR's new constitution will be approved at the
 JZna      meeting of the Supreme Soviet this morning.  This will
 open the way for the formal election of someone to fill the
 post created by the new charter--First Deputy Chairman of the
 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,  in effect,  vice president of
 the USSR.     The position appears to be essentially ceremonial,
 and the choice will probably go to VasiZy Kuznetsov,  now First
 Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
 I            IThe Supreme Soviet discussions thus far have revealed
 no details of the amendments to the constitution. The speeches
 at the session have been noteworthy only for the praise lavished
 on party leader and President Brezhnev and for their defensive-
 ness about Western criticism of the constitution.
 The promotion of Kuznetsov to candidate membership on
 e  o i        uro last Monday gave the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 two spokesmen on that body--overrepresentation in comparison
 with other Soviet institutions. Kuznetsov's departure from the
 ministry to become vice president would redress this imbalance.
 Approvedi For Release 2007/03/13 : CIA-RDP79T0g975A030300010098-7
 Approved For 9
 The case for his appointment has also been bolstered
 in the past few days by the apparent unanimity in the Soviet
 rumor mill that he will get the post. For example,  journalist
 Victor Louis told a Western newsman shortly after the Central
 Committee plenum on Monday that Kuznetsov had been selected
 for the post that day. A Soviet diplomat in Belgrade told the
 US Embassy there that the 76-year-old Kuznetsov would get the
 vice presidency, characterizing the job as semiretirement.
 So long as the position is occupied by someone like
 Kuznetsov, who has no political power base, the identity of
 the incumbent will have no bearing on the question of succes-
 sion to Brezhnev as party leader. Kuznetsov may, in fact, have
 been chosen with a view to sidestepping this issue.
 CANADA:  Status of the Tories
 //Joe Clark,  the Leader of Canada's opposition
 Progressive Conservative Party,  is making a strong showing in
 his bid to challenge Prime Minister Trudeau and the governing
 Liberal Party.  Tory provincial premiers have given a solid en-
 dorsement to Clark's  Leadership well before the annual party
 conference in November,  and Clark himself has taken steps to
 strengthen his handling of the party's policy and fiscal af-
 fairs. Polls indicate that the Liberals still have a sizable
 Lead over the Conservatives, but this advantage seems unlikely
 to Last in the face of increasing voter dissatisfaction with
 the sluggish economy and high unemployment.  The Tories believe
 these issues will carry the day for them in the election Trudeau
 is expected to call next spring.
 //Clark's recent meeting with the four Conservative
 provincia  premiers underscores the progress he has made in
 pulling the party together. The meeting, to coordinate national
 party strategy, resulted in a joint "communique" on issues such
 as the economy and national unity. This declaration is to serve
 as a major policy statement for the party's conference in Novem-
 ber.                   Even more important from Clark's standpoint, the meeting
 showed the Tory rank and file that Clark has the full support
 of senior party leaders.//
 //Clark realizes that he has a tough task ahead of
 him in overcoming the Liberals' sizable lead in the polls--a
 lead that is partly caused by his reputation as an ineffectual
 Approved For R
 Approved For
 party leader.  He admits that he has depended too much on the
 advice of his staff--and particularly of dissident Tory members
 of Parliament--when he should have been listening to the Tory
 caucus and provincial premiers. Clark also intends to make
 fewer but better  speeches and to lay out more definitive posi-
 tions on the issues.//
 //Failure to go on record with comprehensive, well-
 timed policy proposals probably has hurt Clark's image more than
 anything else. Following the victory last November of Rene
 Levesque's separatists in Quebec, for example, the Tories did
 not come forth with well-considered policy options. To make up
 for this neglect, Clark has hired as his principal policy ad-
 viser an ex-Liberal, J. D. Edmonds, who worked for former Prime
 Minister Lester Pearson in the 1960s. The recruitment of Edmonds,
 who has extensive experience in business and government, is con-
 sidered a major coup and should strengthen Clark's credibility
 with the business and academic communities.//
 //Clark's top economic adviser is a Tory member of
 Parliament from Toronto, James Gilles. Gilles is a vocal advo-
 cate of Canadian reliance on the development and sale of natural
 resources, a position increasingly seen by Canadians as a way
 to revitalize the country's sluggish economy. He also believes
 the government should spur consumer demand by reducing sales
 taxes and personal income taxes for low- and middle-income
 groups.//
 //Clark has moved several influential Albertans into
 key positions on his newly established "Canada Fund Board," which
 will handle the party's campaign finances. The Conservatives
 need a financial boost, and the inclusion of the Albertans should
 ensure substantial help from that oil-producing province. Their
 presence on the Board should also demonstrate Clark's respect
 for the political influence of the western. provinces and offset
 Trudeau's recent elevation of ex-Tory Albertan Jack Horner to
 cabinet rank.//
 //Clark's best hope of breaking the Liberals' hold
 on Parliament is to continue his efforts at the grass-roots
 level, where he has worked hard during the; past two years. A
 Liberal insider recently described the large following his party
 enjoyed in the public opinion polls during the summer as "very
 fragile." Scattered reports over the past few months suggest
 that the Liberals have done very little to assure that this back-
 ing will be turned into votes.//

 //The British are concerned that the Soviets do

 Africa;  they believe the USSR relies too heavily on ideology
 and pays too little attention to national or tribal factors.//
 //On bilateral matters, Owen will want to talk
 about the trade imbalance between the two countries. Trade in
 1976 ran at almost a 3 to 1 ratio in favor of the USSR; the
 ratio for the first eight months of 1977 is not much better
 from the British standpoint.//
 //Owen will probably press the USSR to use more
 of the $1.6 billion credit extended in 1975 to finance British
 exports to the USSR. The Soviets are likely to respond that the
 British are making progress difficult by trying to raise the
 interest rates on the line of credit. They may press the UK
 for concessions similar to those reportedly agreed to recently
 by the Italians.

 //The Australian Ministry of Health is planning
 a multimillion dollar Laboratory facility in which high-risk
 molecular biology experiments can be conducted safely. The
 facility is much Larger and more elaborate than would be needed
 for current or anticipated Australian research activities. It
 probably is intended to induce foreign scientists to conduct
 recombinant DNA experiments in Australia.//
 //The facility will be built on an island off
 Sou   Australia and reportedly will contain 20 to 30 large
 laboratories, all equipped with the most advanced versions of
 safety devices and systems, such as negative pressure barriers,
 glove boxes, incinerators, space-suit type clothing, and special
 transfer modules for moving samples from one laboratory to
 another. As such, it will become the world's largest and prob-
 ably most advanced facility designed to meet all of the strict-
 est physical containment criteria that have been developed to
 prevent catastrophic recombinant DNA research accidents.//
 //Almost all of the recombinant DNA experiments
 initiated by Australian researchers thus far are relatively
 hazard-free and will not require elaborate containment facili-
 ties. A considerable amount of space should remain available
 at the facility and foreign scientists probably could be in-
 duced to conduct research there. This would increase Australia's
 scientific prestige worldwide, enable it to exploit profitably
 the commercial aspects of recombinant DNA research,  and probably
 would benefit other molecular biological research as well.//
 //Australian laboratories interested in recombinant
 DNA studies have been asked to report details of their proposed
 research to a standing committee on genetic engineering, which

 has published a non-binding set of research guidelines. Enforce-
 ment, however, is based mostly on peer pressure. Since many
 other Western nations and the USSR are planning to adopt legally
 binding research regulations, scientists may find greater free-
 dom to conduct experiments in Australia than elsewhere and, more
 important, may escape the time-consuming administrative workload
 that probably will arise in countries with enforceable regula-
 tions and oversight organizations.

 I            IChina marked the first anniversary of the purge of
 the   gang of four" by publishing a joint editorial yesterday
 in the nation's three major papers calling for greater efforts
 against remaining sympathizers of the gang. The editorial re-
 peats earlier calls for moderation in dealing with former gang
 supporters. Peking has maintained tight control over the cam-
 paign from the start in order to avoid the violence sparked by
 earlier campaigns.
 The year-long campaign to ferret out the sympathizers
 has bogged down in some provinces. Leftist sentiment apparently
 was strong among junior officials, and some who still hold key
 posts have hindered investigations. Others apparently have at-
 tempted to conceal their past association with the gang.
 The campaign against the left may be entering its
 final stage. Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng told the 11th Party
 Congress in August that the work should be completed by late
 this year or early next.

 Interparty talks on forming a new coalition govern-
 ment in the Netherlands came to a halt on Thursday in a dispute
 over how many cabinet posts each party would get. This is the
 third time since the election last May that caretaker Prime
 Minister den Uyl has declared the talks deadlocked and has
 withdrawn. A mediator has managed to resolve the differences
 each of the previous times.
