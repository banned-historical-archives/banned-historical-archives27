 and Honan were battling the cotton weevil.  Instead of remembering their sufferings
 of last yeas, many people were not exerting themselves in destroying insects, but
 looked upon them as "a creation of nature that would continue to be reproduced
 even if some were killed."
 Peasants were instructed to "use their native ingenluty" to devise ways of

 Tiehling Hsien, Liaosi, had sent 30 cadres to investigate and reorganize 95 "sub-
 standard" farmers cooperatives.  Many members triad failed to pay in their shares,
 and those who had paid could not get their money back.  Chinchow said (May 21)
 that the Liaosi General Cooperative had sent four teams to propagandize and offer
 teohnical assistance on the use of insecticides; as some farmers had been unwill-
 ing to spend money for insecticides, while others had made improper applications.
 Tsinan reported (May 24) that the Party Committee of Chitung Hsien, Shantung, had

 glaring defects; which had "seriously impaired', farms in Chinhua and Cl "hou Special
 Districts.  A directive called upon the cadres to exchange experiences and check on
 each othe-, to make closer supervision of farm operations, and to eliminate
 bourgeois  tendencies among the  ?orkers?  Cadres in Kairua :isien were charged with
 complacency following initial successes.   Yangchow stated (May 22) that cadres in
 TungLai Hsien, Kiangsu, had been charged with failure to implement fully the spring
 farm production program, with, paying no heed to farmers' problems, and with showing
 an ignorance of farming operations.  Peking reported in numeral code (May 23) that
 a check in Hsuancheng F'^ien, Anhwei, where cadres became complacent following cons-
 truction of large reservoirs. showed some reservoirs located where they could not

 organize and arm themselves to protect the wheat crop, as lawless landlords and
 counterrevolutionarier, were sabotaging the harvests.  Nanchang stated  (May 20)
 that cadres in Tungku Fs en, Kiang-el, had been ordered to indoctrinate the pea-
 sants in "rational production and :rational welfare," because their irrational
 actions led to results, such as th,. loss of oxen, which greatly hindered production.
 Li Yun-nung of Ssutso Hsaangregularly hired out his ox for as much as he could
 get, because he had bourgeoise leanings, and when he rented it to peasant woman
 Tai Chi-chiu she worked  t so hard that it died
 Nanchang said (hiay 21) that in Chirthuang Hsiang, Yuchiang Hsien, Kiangsi, where
 106 families were starving because of last year?s drought and this years heavy
 snows, peasants with surplus food dared not make loans for fear of accusation, un-
 til after  ^'  1 rinationlon the Government policy of free landing, when 36 families
 lent 91.4 piculs of grain.  Nanchang added (May 23) that in Hsinchi Hsiang, Wantsan
 Hsien, Kiangsi, indoctrination was necessary because peasants hesitated to increase
 production through fear of increased taxes.  III Hsinkan Hsien 90 mutual-aid teams
 were organized ir. Chu 6, but no one knew theirlpurpose, while in Chu 3 one-third
 of the 100 teams served no purpose, and some ev&n included landlords.
 Chungking reported (May  0) `*.Li cadres in Hur ya Hsien, Szechwan, had been charged
 with bureaucracy and indifference to the plightlof poor farmers, as an inspection
 in April showed 60 percent of the peasants shc.t of fertilizer, oxen,  or grain,
 though others had surpluses in all these necessities.  Chungking added (May 22)
 that in Yunnan rural cadres issued only 54 percent of the farm loans, withholding
 irrigation loans becausel they thought the farmers did not need them, and delaying
 processing loans because they were too busy holding meetings.  Peking reported in
 numeral code (May 23) that the Administrative Bureau of Cooperative Enterprises of
 the Southwest held sessions in April and May to discuss the backwardness of farm
 cooperatives, as an araalwith 74 million people had only 1,200 cooperatives with 3
 million members.  The deficiency was credited to "lack of knowledge" of rural econo-
 mic development, underestimation of rural needs,, and "conservative thought."
