 Briefly Noted
 The Two Faces of Soviet Policy toward West Germany
 March brought a spate of new Soviet attacks on the
 "revanchist and militaristic policies" of the German Federal
 Republic, beginning with a 4,000-word March 7 Tass statement
 tied to Bonn's 1963 year-end progress report.  Although this
 blast contained no new charges, it surprised the Germans
 (some of whom termed it "Stalinist") with the harsh language
 in which it rehashed the old accusations:   i.e.;  "The pre-
 sent tension in Europe ... stems from the revenge-seeking
 and militaristic policy of the same circles whic  for over
 three-quarters of a century have brought-Europe five wars,...
 who now want to prepare a sixth.,         In the German Federal
 Republic the reins of power f e 1 into the hands of the same
 forces that in their time had nurtured Hitler-and are tr
 to continue the criminal policy of the     e ch.
 (The Soviet Government punctuated its new hard lan-
 guage by expelling on March 10 German Embassy counsellor
 Naupert, apparently in reprisal for Bonn's January expulsion
 of equal-ranked Soviet diplomat Morosov who had grabbed the
 passport of a Soviet defector shown him by the Bonn Foreign
 Ministry and refused to surrender it.)
 Such tactics have not been used since Erhard took over
 from Adenauer, and observers saw the new attack as signifying
 that the USSR had little hope of enticing the new Bonn regime
 to veer to policies more favorable to Moscow:   indeed, some
 saw it as specifically linked to Bonn's rejection of additional
 long-term credits for Moscow and certain embargoes.
 At the same time -- as broadcast by !rankfurt Radio
 on the 10th and reported from Moscow by Reuters on the 19th
 -- Krupp became the first Western industrial organization to
 be gran ed permanent representation in Moscow; its Hans-
 Juergen Meyer received a one-year residence visa, although
 all other Western industrial representatives are limited to
 three-month visas!
 The German press was not slow to recognize the duplicity
 in this preferred treatment of "the successors of the Krupp
 'cannon kingst" (as the Neue Rhein-Ruhr Zeitung termed them
 in its editorial on the        -- as contrasts  with Moscow's
 simultaneous "principled" attack on Germany's democratically
 elected Government and its unidentified "revanchist and
 militaristic" ruling circles.
 The apparoat warm Moscow affinity for the giant firm
 of Krupp -- a name which almost symbolized the German heavy
 armaments industry during the first half of this century --
 has been noted ever since Krupp General Manager Beitz made
 his first visit to Moscow in 1950.  Although we do not in

 any way suggest that the present Krupp management is malevolent
 (:-rrupp has ceased armaments production), we lose no opportunity
 -- and the present is a good one -- to expose the duplicity of
 the reheated Soviet propaganda attacks depicting  es    rmany
 in thehands of"thie same circles which for over three-q.Ud.rters
 of a century have Brought   rope five wars," "nurtured Hitler,"
 etc.   (as quoted above), while at the same time they are, for
 self-serving ends, cuddling up with the current day management
 of the best known industrial concern associated with Germany's
 former militaristic circles.
 Soviet Trade Cloaks Subversion
 London news stories of 26 March reported the expulsion
 of Vladimir Solomatin, a member of the permanent Soviet Trade
 Mission in the UI.  He used business contacts to obtain speci-
 fications for secret defense equipment.  One newspaper, the
 Daily Express, intimated that a British businessman had aided
 the au  orities in collecting evidence in the case.
 In discussing Soviet foreign trade activities, as pro-
 posed in recent Guidances, we should where possible and
 appropriate point out that trade activities serve as cover
 for espionage and strong-arm activities.  Aside from Solomatin,
 cases in point include Valerian pripoltsev, Soviet Trade
 Mission employee in Cologne, Germany, arrested in August 1961
 and expelled in July 1962; Vladislav Sergeyevich Andreyev,
 Commercial Counsellor at the Soviet Embassy in Wellington,
 New Zealand, declared persona non grata in July 1962; and
 uergey Vasilyevich Shi  yev, Commercial Attache at the Soviet
 Embassy at The Hague, declared persona non grata after he
 attempted to use force in preventing a defection.  Persons
 dealing with Soviet trade officials may find themselves the
 objects of blackmail and attempted recruitment for Soviet
 intelligence services.  Those who nevertheless do deal with
 Soviet officials, and who discover that the Soviets are out
 for something besides trade, should inform their security
 service.
 BusinessmG&a should also be told that, aside from spying
 against governments, Soviet trade officials often seek to obtain
 trade secrets.  Thus in 1963, the Soviets held out promises to
 purchase $250,000,000 worth of oil refining equipment, on the
 condition, however, that they be permitted to "see for them-
 selves" that they were getting the most up-to-date equipment
 -- i.e., that they be given access to all the secrets of the
 British oil industry.  This was more than any individual firm
 could agree to give them, even if it wanted to.  The Soviet
 practice of buying single prototypes of advanced machines, and
 then copying them without any regard for patent rights, is
 well known.

 Czechoslovakia's Lagging Economy
 Many characteristics of Soviet society are those of a new
 economy emerging from bao! wardness.             Friends of tho USSR try
 to present it as a -nodes. for less developed countries to follow;
 critics point out V1jAt t e high Soviet growth rates of the past
 were only possible hacau,e the economy was a young one.  The
 question arises:  what will Communism be able to do with an
 advanced economy?
 A living example of Communism in an advanced society is
 Czechoslovakia, an economy which in 1948 was quite comparable
 with the countries of Western Europe.  East Germany was also
 once part of an advanced economy, but because of extraordinary
 war damage, separation from the rest of Germany, and drastic
 stripping of the economy by the Soviets, the GDR economy has
 suffered unusual handicaps.   In Czecholsovakia, however,
 Communism has had a fair chance to show what it can do with
 an advanced society.  As an unclassified attachment to this
 guidance shows, Communism has genera =y maw a mess of things.
 The western prediction that Communist growth rates will
 d e c 1 i n e  when Communist economies are more mature--a pre-
 diction which recent Soviet developments have tended to
 confirm--is fully borne out by the Czech experience.
 The Czech case may be presented to the people of developed
 countries to show them that Communism has nothing to offer them
 except stagnation and decline.   In less-developed nations,
 Czechos ovasia may be  e   up as demonstrating the results of
 Communism; the people of developing Communist countries can
 loo',   forward to arriving, after years of deprivation, only
 at the position now achieved by the Czechs.                         25XIC10b

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE TO COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #25                                                  14-27 March 1964
 Commentary
 Principal Developments:
 1.  The Chinese drove on relentlessly with their all-
 fronts onslaught a~'~inst IM-rushchev and his followers. -M-
 spite pressure from "neutral" CPs as well as from the Soviet
 camp to withhold polemics, the Chinese NCNA news agency and
 press ostentatiously publicized polemical texts by their
 supporters daily since the departure o     e Rumanian delega-
 tion from Pe  ng, going back several months -- even into
 1963 -- to pick up some of them (see Chrono, March 13 and
 continuing). This campaign was capped (after the end of our
 period, see Addendum to Chrono, March 31) with the publication
 of their own new major attack -- the eighth in their series
 tied  o   e 14 July  ..    open letterculminating in an
 open and direct call to all   mmun sts, inside the CPSU as
 well as in other parties, to "repudiate and liquidate
 Khrushchev's revisionism."  most significant is the clue to
 their tactical plans i n their "solemn declaration" that "it
 is necessary to amend the formulation of the question ("peace-
 ful transition" an    a "parliamentary road" to socialism) in
 the declaration and the statement (documents of the 1957 and
 1960  oscow conferences)    roug  joint consultation of Commu-
 nist and workers parties to conform to the revolutionary prin-
 ciples of Marxism-Leninism."
 2.  Prior to this new blast, the Peking press triumph-
 antly announced the formation of another pro-Chinese "national
 c", this time in Australia, headed by their  avork e,   E.F.Hillt
 Wo had been expo  a  from the old CPA last year for his pro-
 Chicom activities.  Turbulent developments in India during the
 past couple of weeks indicate that the pro-Chinese faction may
 set up a new party there also in the near future.
 3.  The Chinese also thrust their fight against the
 Soviets aggressively and destructively inhree major inter-
 national front activities.  Most spectacular was the bitter
 public battle before 71-national delegations at the 6th Session
 of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) in
 Algiers (Chrond., March 22-2U), precipitated  y     nese chief
 legate's attacks on Soviet policy.  A similar struggle was
 reportedly carried on behind closed doors at an executive
 session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (W ETU) in
 Sofia (Chrono, March IU-21).  And after the end of the period,
 the Chinese started advance attacks on the forthcoming Budapest
 8th Congress of the International Association of Democratic
 Lawyers (IADL) with a press release denouncing the undemocratic

 efforts of "certain responsible members" to monopolize the
 preparations to push "the erroneous foreign policy of a certain
 country**  and blaming them in advance "for the grave consequences
 that may ensue at the Ctti Congress" (Addendum, March 29).  In
 secret comment on the A"PBO events, the U.S. Embassy in Algiers
 says that the Sino-Soviet altercation was even worse in the
 closed sessions than in public, and that the Chinese refused
 to invite the Soviets, Mongolians and Indians to their reception
 for all delegates.  The Chinese seemed to be backed publicly by
 at least one-third of the delegates, including the Asians
 (except for Mongolians and Indians) and a number of Africans,
 especially English-speaking, and Embassy concludes that the
 Chinese "may well increase their position within AAPSO."  The
 Arabs, however, seemed to favor neither, and some (particularly
 Egyptians) talked about trying to get both the Chinese and the
 25X1C1 riots thrown out of AAPSO.

 Hungary's liberation from Nazi occupation.  No
 other major Communist leader is known to be coming.
 He and Radar may or may not take advantage of the
 occasion to issue a statement on problems of the ICM.
 d.  No hard information has become available
 re plans for Hhrushchev's 70th birthday celebration,
 April 17, or for the annual May Day rally.

 planned more for political-psychological impact than
 for military motives:   coming so soon after Mikoyan
 demonstrative attendance at the Grotewohl birthday
 (3g of last Commentary), it suggests a Soviet feel-
 ing of need to provide a public reminder of their
 relationship with SED during these times.
 f.  The French CP called anew for a world
 conference without delay (Chronol, March     , nouncing      Chinese attitudes at the same time.
 Pravda also reports that Canadian CP General Secre-
 tary                         is and Dutch CP Secretary Kukster expressed
 new support for a world conference in the near future.

 The Chinese could hardly have done more to back Khrushchev
 and his followers into a corner -- where they must launch an
 effective counter-attack or face gradual destruction -- than
 by their conduct--during this period,    a  er firm evidence
 indicates that as late as the end of February (and perhaps
 until the middle of March) Khrushchev -- under heavy pressure
 from the "anti-split" elements -- was still willing to go
 through the motions of further bilateral talks with the
 Chinese, despite the polemical pummeling he has taken from them,
 if they would refrain from future polemics.  But they ruth-
 S-sl-y--a-n-d-o-ss-fee-nn-faa-tT ous y procee e  to publish daily polemics,
 capped by the 31 March diatribe which not only adds further
 personal insults to juirushER-OV--but calls openly -for his
 qu  a  on.
 The new Chinese blast also implies Chinese thinking on
 future strategy and tactics:   i.e., "through joint consul a ion
 o  Communist an  wor ers parties" (the parties and dissident
 groups attuned to the Chinese line) to work toward the formu-
 lation of a new document to succeed the 1957 and 1960 decTara-
 on and s a emen  which will clearly wipe out "Khrushchev's
 revisionist" influence in favor of the     nese concept o
 "revolutionary Marxism-Leninism " and wE1-cF-They believe will
 gradually win the adherence an  support of "the international
 Communist movement" as a whole.
 How will Khrushchev and his supporters react?  We suggest
 that he may s       ry  o procras  na a -- but time seems to be
 running out on him!

 condemning modern revisionism, pus an editorial from Tien Phong
 (Vanguard), organ of N. Vietnamese Labor Youth Union, calling
 on youth to combat modern revisionism.
 March 18-21 -- An executive session of the World Federation of
 Trade Unions (WFTU) in Sofia saw another bitter battle between
 the Soviet and Chinese forces, according to reports leaking out.
 The Yugoslav Tanyug correspondent in Sofia reports (on the 27th)
 that the Chinese delegate, assisted by the Indonesian, N. Korean,
 N. Vietnamese and Ja anese, "availed himself of every opportunity
 to provoke a sharp polemic and to carry the positions of the
 Chinese Party and State leadership to the international trade
 union scene."  "The Chinese and Indonesian representatives
 wanted first of all to have Vice President Mendis of Ceylon de-
 clared a private person in Sofia because the Ceylonese trade
 unions have split."  The Chinese declared that the WFTU and
 its Secy Genl Louis Saillant were supporting the foreign policy
 of a big state -- "clearly an allusion to the Soviet Union."
 "In Sofia the Chinese pretended to have a monopoly on absolute
 truth, infallibility, and the right to lecture everyone.   More-
 over, this is not the first time it has been possible to perceive
 that the Chinese want to create an international trade union
 center -- evidently outside the WFTU" -- lased on Chinese ideas.
 March 18 and continuing -- A brief Hungarian announcement on the
 18th stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that day ex-
 pelled Vasil Tasellari, commercial attache of the Albanian
 Embassy,   who, abusing his right to diplomatic immunity, in
 violation of the law, interfered in the internal affairs of the
 Hungarian People's Republic."  An even briefer announcement, on
 the same day but apparently not connected, stated:   "The Minister
 of the Interior has placed Sandor Nagy ... under preliminary
 arrest for suspected incitement."
 On the 20th, the Albanian Foreign Ministry denounced the
 expulsion -- "another hostile action in continuation of anti-
 Albanian activities carried out by the Hungarian leadership
 in past years with the intention of aggravating relations...."
 It went on to demand the withdrawal within 48 hours of an
 attache, Lajos Evy, at the Hungarian Embassy in Tirana.
 On the 21st, several correspondents in Fudapest reported tha
 "informed Hungarian sources" linked the Albanian ouster with
 the arrest of Nagy, a 1951 Stalin    ize winner, one of the hard-
 core Stalinists who never accepted Kadar's moderate approach.
 Nagy was said to have circulated material calling for the over-
 throw of the Kadar regime (NYTimes' Underwood said it urged
 the assasination of Kadar) which had been printed in Albania

 through Tasellari's complicity.
 A Reuters dispatch dated the 29th reported that "further
 details on the recent arrest of Sandor Nagy ... revealed that
 he was to head a 'new Communist Party' in Hungary in support
 of the Chinese....  A ccording to unconfirmed reports, several
 hundred supporters of Nagy ... were either arrested or investi-
 gated by the Hungarian police in the last ten days."  Reuters
 adds that the group around Nagy "closely collaborated with the
 Albanian Party which ... provided funds and even a printing press,
 the sources said."
 March 20 -- _La Voix du Peuple, organ of Grippa's Belgian pro-
 Chinese dissidents, carries a long report describing the first
 (March) issue of Nuova Unita, subtitled, in translation, "For
 the Victory of Marxism-Leninism," a Chinese-line monthly publish-
 ed in Italy.   The report contains long excerpts from its platform
 and reprints a map showing the centers of "true Marxist-Leninistd'
 in Italy.
 March 22 --  The London Sunday Times carries a Peking dispatch
 by Jacques Marcuse reporting that "foreign experts" there te-
 lieve that "a formal political break with Russia by China is
 now a very definite probability," and that "the occasion would
 be the international 'Marxist-Leninist' conference which would
 convene here at the CCP's invitation and would 'unmask' and
 condemn modern revisionism and Nikita Khrushchev."  He writes
 that the Rumanians were told of China's intentions during their
 talks early this month.   Khrushchev's forthcoming visit to Hun-
 gary is announced officially by Budapest.
 March 22-28 --  The 6th session of the Council of the Afro-Asian
 Peoples' Solidarity Organization AAPSO), held in Algiers and
 chaired by Algerian Mohammed Yazid became the scene of a bitter
 Chinese-Soviet battle.   It started with the March 23 speech of
 Mrs. Kuo Chien, leader of the Chinese delegation, who violently
 attacked Soviet policies.   She was quoted as saying, when de-
 nouncing the   rushchev proposal for peaceful resolution of
 border and territorial disputes as "the most absurd and reaction-
 ary reasoning:
 "Now if some people should ask the Afro-Asian
 people to capitulate unconditionally to the
 aggression of the imperialists and old and new
 colonialists under the deceitful slogan that
 no use of force is allowed to settle territorial
 disputes, the Chinese people will reply categori-
 cally 'No, a thousand times no,' and will tell these
 people:   'Your expansionism and national egoism
 have long made it difficult to draw a line between

 and now.'  As birds of a feather flock together,
 it is not at all strange that you should stand
 on the side of the imperialists and colonialists.
 But you will never succeed in deceiving us people
 of Africa and Asia."
 Soviet chief delegate Bibodjan Gafurov on the 25th, casti-
 gated the Chien speech, saying that other "delegations had asked
 him not to reply to the Chinese "calumnies."  The Chinese and
 some Africans interrupted with protests and demand for right
 of reply.    The Chinese again demanded the right to reply after
 the open sessions ended, but Yazid was reported as banning
 further Sino-Soviet clashes, declaring that:  "Algiers, the
 capital of   geria an  the-Afro-Asian capital, must not become
 the capital of Afro-Asian disunity."  Algerian President Ben
 Bella, at his reception in honor of the delegates on the 'h,
 re arked:  "We want our debates to be, first and foremost, Afro-
 Asian.  We will remain vigilant so that these de ates will say
 In tthe Afro-Asian sphere."
 The pro-Soviet Algerian newspaper Alger Republican on the
 24th criticized the Chinese conduct under the heading:   "The
 Only Discordant Note."  On the 25th, Czech central organ Rude
 Pravo condemned the "reckless" Chinese conduct, saying that the
 Chien speech "met the gloomiest expectations," marked by "anti-
 Soviet h steria."  "The Chinese delegate ridiculed the endeavor
 to build up developing countries economically and described any
 hope of averting war as.nonsensical and even fraudulent."  Czech
 commentator Hochman also points out that "the delegates did not
 fail to notice that in her list of imperialist forces the Chi-
 nese delegate completely   orgot  France."
 Despite obvious public revulsion to their feuding, how-
 ever, Gafurov held a press conference to air his views more
 fully on the 27th, and  uo Chen retaliated with her own press
 conference on the 28th to reply to the Soviet s an ers and
 distortions!
 March 24 --  The East Germans announce that a Soviet military
 delegation led by  a ense Minister Marshal Malinovsky will pay
 "an official friendship visit" to the GDR at the invitation of

 ADDENDUM TO CHRONOLOGY
 March 29 -- The Peking press announces the formation of "the
 onist Party of Australia -- Marxist-Leninist" with E.F. Hill
 as  Chairman.
 In Buda est, the Chinese delegation to the 8th Congress of
 the Internat onal Association of Democratic Lawyers      L  which
 is due to.open there on the  lst, issues a statement to the press
 which says:
 "It is to be regretted that certain responsitle
 members of the IADL have taken an extremely undemocratic
 attitude, attempting to monopolize everything regarding
 the agenda of the 8th Congress, the reports, and the
 way the Congress is to be conducted, for the purpose of
 pushing through the erroneous line of foreign policy of
 a certain country....
 "The Chinese delegation solemnly declares:  certain
 responsitle members of the I  L, who are pursuing an
 erroneous political line, and who, while paying lip
 service to unity, are actually engaged in division,
 should tear full responsibility for the grave consequences
 that may ensue at the 8th  ongress."
 March 29-30 -- Pravda on the 29th reports that Canadian CP
 General Secretary orris, speaking to the 18th Congress of the

 NCNA summary on which to base the following trief comments, and
 will summarize the article more fully in the next issue-7
 The article starts by declaring that "the betrayal of
 Marxism and of the proletariat by the revisionists has always
 manifested itself most sharply in their opposition to violent
 revolution and to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in
 their advocacy of peaceful transition from capitalism to social-
 ism.                   This is likewise the case with Khrushchev's revisionism.
 On this question Khrushchev is a disciple of rrowder and Tito
 as well as of Bernstein and Kautsky."

 The Chinese state that they had expressed themselves
 against Khrushchev's views on "peaceful transition" and "the
 parliamentary road" from the time he put them forward at the
 1956 20th CPSU Congress, and that they made concessions to allow
 Soviet formulations to be incorporated into the 1     and 1960
 Moscow documents.   However, "the CPSU leadership has taken ad-
 vantage of these weaknesses and errors... and used them as an
 excuse for peddling Khrushchev's revisionism."  The Chinese then
 "solemnly declare" that "it is necessary to amend the formulation
 of the question in the declaration and the statement through
 joint consultation of Communist and Workers parties to conform
 to the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism."
 Further taunting K., the Chinese say that "it is Khrushchev
 himself who has succeeded to the mantle of Trotskyism and who
 stands with the   otskyites of today."  And further, "K. is the
 greatest capitulationist in history."
 After citing the Communist leaders of Iraq, Algeria, France,
 and "the Dange clique" in India as bad examples and Comrade Fide].
 in Cuta as a shining case, they call for action -- against
 Khrushchev:
 "Now is the time -- now it is high time -- to
 repudiate and liquidate Khrushchev's revisionism!
 Here, we would give the leading comrades of the CPSU
 a piece of advice:    since so many opportunists and
 revisionists have teen thrown onto the ruttish heap of
 history, why must you obdurately follow in their wake?
 Here, too, we express the hope that those leading comrades
 of other fraternal parties will think this over:  what
 have they gained b  following the revisionist line of the
 leaders of the CCU? ... We believe that all those who
 are proletarian revolutionaries will eventually choose
 the revolutionary line and reject the anti-revolutionary
 line, will eventually choose M-L and reject revisionism.
 We entertain very great hopes in this regard."

 25X1C10b767.      Recognizing Communist China?
 DISCUSSION AND ACTION:
 1.  "Recognition will reform the Chicoms."  This is
 an up-to-date version of yesterdays theme, no longer so widely
 repeated, that we should recognize Communist China and treat
 her with kid gloves in order to woo her away from Soviet Russia
 and make Mao Tse-tung a second Tito.  It is said that recogniz-
 ing the Chicoms and bringing them into the United Nations will
 make them more moderate, cooperative, responsible and peace-
 loving.  The advocates of this view contend that this approach
 worked in the case of the Soviet Union and therefore will work
 ep y   a  most countries recognized
 with Communist China.  We reply-
 the Soviet Union in the Twenties (the U.S., one of the last,
 in 1933) and that most of Stalin's crimes -- the blood purges,
 the pact with Hitler, annexation of vast territories adjoining
 Russia, etc. -- were committed well         a f t e r  that time, not
 at all influenced by diplomatic ties with the civilized world.
 Even today, the Soviet rulers still want to "bury" us and
 whatever improvement in their international behavior may have
 occurred, is due to free-world strength and pressure and to
 the gradual internal development of the Soviet Union away from
 its one-time revolutionary aggressiveness.
 Mao Tse-tung himself recently
 predicted to a group of French parliamentarians that Khrushchev
 would be overthrown and that the Russian comrades would return
 to the true Marx-Lenin path of violent revolution.  We point
 out that, given Communist China's point of view, granting
 recognition to her will be seen by the Chicoms as appeasement
 and can only confirm her leaders' erroneous and dangerous pre-
 conceptions regarding the effectiveness of hostile policies to-
 ward the rest of the world and the "inevitability" of Communist
 25Xv~?~bory (the "wave of the future").

 768 EE,WE.  Nuclear-Free Zone for Scandinavia?        What's Behind the
 25X1 C10b    Kekkonen Plan?
 BACKGROUND: Since the fall of 1957, Soviet leaders, and
 other leaders friendly to the USSR as well, have periodically
 proposed "peace zones" or atom-free zones for various parts of
 the world.  For example, the Soviets suggested atom free zones
 in the Baltic (September 1957 and June 1959), the Balkans
 (January 1958 and May 1959) and Far East (March 1950 and Janu-
 ary 1959), while the most famous proposal of all, the Rapacki
 Plan, was first submitted by Poland in October 1957.  The
 Soviets and their friends have suggested almost every area of
 the globe as a candidate for such a zone; the only significant
 exceptions are Western Europe, the United States, and the USSR
 itself.  The Mediterranean, Antarctica, Africa, the Middle
 East and Latin America are all areas which have been nominated
 for this status.
 In the case of Antarctica, the Soviet, UK, and US govern-
 ments signed a treaty on I December 1959, banning tests and
 providing for a non-militarized status enforced by observers.
 The US is also sympathetic to nuclear-free zone proposals for
 Latin America and Africa, providing that they are effective
 (i.e., verified) and agreed to by all concerned.  But proposals
 for atom-free zones elsewhere, and particularly in Europe,
 represent a disguised attack on Western political and strategic
 positions.
 As in the case of their general disarmament proposals, it
 is difficult to say whether the Soviets have the slightest
 belief that their nuclear-free zone schemes might be accepted
 by Western governments.  Whether these schemes are adopted or not,
 they can be used against the West.  Even if acceptance is im-
 possible, the Soviets can use the slogan of the "atom-free zone"
 to suggest that they are the peace-loving camp, and to put the
 West in the apparent position of rejecting proposals promoting
 peace.  Many prominent Westerners, including George Kennan,
 the late Hugh Gaitskell, Jules Moch, and Paul-Henri Spam;,
 have suggested plans of their own for demilitarizing Central
 Europe, and the general concept of such a demilitarization
 evidently has a wide appeal.  Unsophisticated people have been
 easily misled by the Rapacki version of this concept, which
 would virtually eliminate NATO bases in Europe (which are
 largely -in west Germany) while only pushing Soviet nuclear forces
 back to Brest-Litovsk--assum nngg that such a Soviet withdrawal
 ac ua  y too  p ace, a ma  er by no means assured by  - e  apacki
 proposal, which      not provide for inspection or verification.
 When such unsophisticated people see their governments reject
 the Rapacki or similar plans, they do not recognize these
 reasons--sometimes because no one has taken the pains to point
 the reasons out--and they think their governments are negligent
 in furthering peace, if not outright "warmongers" and "militarist`

 On 28 December 1963, Polish Premier Gomulka announced in
 a speech that a new plan was being prepared, which instead of
 barring nuclear weapons would freeze them at their present
 strength.   "Naturally," Gomulka said, "a proper system of con-
 trol should be agreed upon."                          The proposal appeared to recognize
 that NATO could not abandon its Central European positions, and
 that verification of the freeze would be necessary.  Actually,
 however, the Gomulka proposal resembles the first stage of the
 old Rapacki plan, and seems to have the same basic faults:
 Soviet missiles in the USSR would not be controlled while NATO
 missiles would be; also, the plans for control would not (so far
 as we can tell at present) be effective.  But there has not yet
 been much public discussion of this plan and little is known of
 it as yet.
 Much more in the spotlight is the Iiekkonen Plan for an
 atom-free zone in Scandinavia.  At present, the plan for barring
 atom weapons is known byy-     onents name because he was induced
 to propose it in May 1963.    Despite Finnish denials of outside
 influence, the plan was originally Soviet, and apparently the
 Soviets decided to get IXekkonen to revive it, giving it less
 Moscovite overtones.  The Communist parties in Norway, Sweden,
 and Denmark are making all the publicity they can for the plan,
 and they are supported by some left Socialists and pacifists.
 In mid-March, a conference on "Norden -- an !`.tom Pree Zone"
 met in Stockholm.  This campaign is tied in with the I hrushchev
 visit next June; the Soviets have tried to prepare the way for
 him with visits by cosmonauts and by Foreign Minister Gromyko,
 as well as by entertaining the Danish Prime Minister in Moscow.
 It would not be surprising if Inrushchev should use his visit
 to make propaganda speeches in favor of the Iekkonen Plan.
 When the Soviets made their proposal of a Scandinavian
 atom-free zone in 1959, the Scandinavian governments and public
 media replied that the proposal was one-sided, and that the
 Soviets should also remove weapons from parts of their own ter-
 ritory.  Khrushchev at that time refused to consider this, stat-
 ing in a speech on 17 July 1959:
 "The proposal for an atom-free and rocket-free zone
 in part of Soviet territory has no practical meaning
 whatever under present conditions.   If we take into
 account the long r~:nge and power of modern rocket
 and nuclear arms,   O0 or 300 kilometers is of no
 real importance.   Thus, the creation of a rocket-
 free and atom-free zone on a portion of Soviet ter-
 ritory would not be a guarantee for the Scandinavian
 countries."
 This frank statement must have made some people wonder just why
 the Scandinavians should ban weapons from their countries, un-
 less their policy was simply to be "Do anything Khrushchev asks."
 The Yekkonen Plan has met with some of the same reaction
 as its Soviet predecessor.  On 20 January 1964, Norwegian Premier

 Einar Gerhardsen told a press conference that it did not seem
 reasonable to discuss a free zone unless it embraced parts of
 the USSR.  At a meeting of the Nordic Council in Stockholm in
 the week ending 21 February (this is a semi-official conference
 devoted to trade matters, not to be confused with Norden), two
 speakers (Aksel Larsen of Denmark and Aarne Saarine    -Finland)
 unexpectedly raised the issue of a nuclear-free zone.  The
 Swedish Premier, Dr. Tage Erlander, replied that Sweden was
 only interested in nuclear free zones if they were on a larger
 scale and were part of a general disarmament program; Swedish
 proposals, such as the Unden plan for a "non-nublear club," were
 intended to involve services by the great powers in return for
 commitments by the smaller countries.  However, the Swedish Coz.-
 munist paper Ny Dag argued on 6 March 1964 that the Swedish
 government shoulc"T_Ue flexible about the return it expected, and
 make new proposals, while on 3 February the Norwegian CP news-
 paper Friheten hinted that the Soviets might consider proposals
 for including some Soviet territory in the zone, and also sug-
 gested that the zone might include Iceland, Greenland, and
 northern parts of North America,  Friheten stated:
 "Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen at his last press
 conference raised the idea of extending the area to
 include parts of Soviet territory also.  This would
 seem to present a problem in thus involving one of
 the big nuclear powers for whom it is essentially a
 different matter; but it would no doubt be possible
 to get the Soviet Union to submit its views if con-
 tacted.
 We think it might be useful to discuss in ad-
 dition the question of whether the four Nordic coun-
 tries might also examine possibilities for further
 expanding the area:   southwards, eastwards, and
 westwards as well.  Besides sectors of the northern
 areas of the Soviet Union, Iceland and Greo Sand,
 as well as northern regions of American territory,
 could be brought up under such a discussion."
 Thus thn Communist are behaving quite flexibly in their campaign
 and sta:.tlin  new proposals, for example from IU rrn,'zchev, may
 yet appa,:a:r. If the Soviets could evoke it, moot...] ist action
 by the f"ee S,:m nd-11aavian countries would not nnly  5eflect those
 countri    fr:a.;A We;  ern ties, but would also Evoke .ympathy and
 imitation in other areas.
 The barring of nuclear weapons in this area is probably
 in itself of little interest to the Soviets.  There are not now
 any nuclear weapons in Scandinavia, and current NATO policy
 favors phasing out land-based nuclear rockets in favor of
 Polaris systems, rather than increasing the numbers and disper-
 sion of land-based rockets in Europe.  There is no sign that the
 US government has any desire to place nuclear weapons in Norway
 or Denmark, the two Scandinavian members of NATO.  Thus there
 is something a little unreal about this whole campaign, whose

 purported aim is to make the present situation a permanent one.
 The Communist make a virtue of this apparent triviality, and
 suggest that there is nothing to be lost except the tempers of
 the warmongers.  Yet this atom-free zone campaign has great
 strategic and political significance.
 The persistence with which the Soviets push their plan for
 an atom-free Scandinavia, inducing Kekkonen to lend his name to
 the project, mobilizing local communist parties, and organizing
 front groups and meetings, shows that they are out to do some-
 thing more than formalize an existing absence of nuclear weapons.
 '';e will not know precisely what Soviet objectives are until that
 unlikely time when all the Soviet leaders publish exhaustive
 memoirs and when they open the archives of the Kremlin.  Yet
 certain Soviet intentions can be estimated from the known facts
 of the situation.   It appears that the leaders of the USSR may
 have the following aims in mind:
 1.  The Soviets may seek to keep the Swedes from acquiring
 an indepen en  nuclear capability.  Like  he Z:r ss, the
 Swedes have traditionally acted  o safeguard their neu-
 trality by keeping their armed forces sufficiently strong
 and up-to-date to discourage any aggressor.   In recent
 years, public discussion has taken place in Sweden on the
 question of acquiring an independent nuclear force.  Swedes
 naturally hesitate to undertake the high costs of a nuclear
 weapons program, and they are in the fortunate position of
 being, in effect, defended by NATO without having to be-
 long to NATO.  Yet if Sweden should embark on a nuclear
 armament program, it could probably have a primitive nuclear
 capability by the and of the decade.
 2.  The Soviets may wish to keep Polaris submarines out of
 the Baltic.  The proposal to ma %e the Baltic a       of
 peace" goes back to 1955.  Baltic disarmament IF r;ometimes
 linked with Scandinavian disarmament, the chief "ifference
 being the involvement of the two Germanies.  West Germany
 would probably refuse to join in barring nuclear submarines
 from the Baltic, both for defense reasons and because it
 would not join in any agreement with East Germany.  Of
 course, even a refusal on these grounds would provide propa-
 ganda material for the Communists.
 3.  The Soviets probably wish to weaken NATO militarily by
 denying it auxiliary naval and early warning posts in  or-
 way and Denmark.   If the zone could be extended further,
 for example to Central Europe or (as Friheten suggested)to
 Iceland and Greenland, the effect on ITATU would be more
 serious still.
 4.  The Soviets almost certainly wish to weaken NATO's
 political unity; this has been shown for years past  y
 their a  ac:s on the "Bonn Revanchists," by the Rapacki-

 most energetically, including the Scandinavian free zone,
 have been those in some way affecting NATO,  The Scandinavian
 free zone would in practice involve the withdrawal of Norway
 and Denmark from NATO; Soviet propaganda would hail this as
 the first step toward the downfall of the Western alliance
 and as a recognition by these countries of the aggressive
 and militarist nature of that alliance.  To the extent that
 the atom--free zone campaign succeeds, it will encourage
 neutralism everywhere.
 5.  ID,rushchev may see Scandinavia as a fertile field for
 winning a prestige success, especially in competition with
 t e     nese.    nce the Cuban crisis, the only move the
 Soviets have made which has hurt the Chinese and helpbd.
 their own case within the movement has been to accept Anglo-
 American proposals for a limited test ban treaty, arranging
 to have that treaty signed in Moscow.  Khrushchev's 31
 December 1963 message to chiefs of governments, proposing
 a peaceful settlement of all disputes except those the
 Soviets wish to aggravate, was a transparent attempt to
 further his own claim to be chief Peacemonger.   If an atom-
 free zone agreement could somehow be sold as a Kekkonen
 Plan, Soviet propaganda could later tie it up with Khru-
 shchev's Scandinavian visit and rename it the Khrushchev
 Plan.
 6.  Conceivably, Khrushchev may believe that  in Scandinavia,
 he can prove his a      y to exploit "peaceful coexistence"
 propaganda to-gain solid political influence*     nand I
 already dangerously su sec  to economic an  political pres-
 sure from Moscow; no Finnish government can be formed if it
 contains what the Soviets consider "anti-Soviet" elements.
 Fear of Soviet displeasure has excluded the Finnish Social
 Democrats from office for years, and as recently as last
 February, Pravda indicated that despite the resignation
 last year of      old Social Democratic Chairman, Tanner,
 the Soviets' "Worst enemy" in Finland, the SDP was still
 beyond the pale.  What independence the Finns retain is due
 to the armed neutrality of Sweden, and the NATO ties of
 Denmark and Norway.  Once they were all disarmed and severed
 from NATO, the Scandinavian countries would be exposed to
 peaceful penetration and domination; at best, they might
 enjoy the present status of Finland; at worst, that of
 Czechoslovakia.   If Khrushchev could show his ability to
 make "peaceful coexistence" pay off in practical terms, he
 would be less exposed to Chicom criticism within the
 Communist movement.   (Even if Moscow gains nothing else,
 Finnish advocacy of a Soviet plan tends to isolate Finland
 from the rest of Scandinavia.)
 Fortunately, the Scandinavian leaders have a rich fund of
 political experience, and they are not so naive as to be misled
 by mere slogans; as Erlander's remarks show, they expect to get
 something in return if they grant something.  Unfortunately,
 however, some individuals in the Scandinavian countries are sus-
 ceptible to any program which calls itself peaceful.

 269 EE,WE  NATO's Multilateral Force Proposal
 BACKGROUND:  During the winter of 1963-1964, a, working group,
 with representatives from Belgium, West Germany, Greece, Holland,
 Italy, Turkey, the UIK, and the US, met in Paris to discuss pro-
 posals for a multilateral nuclear force.   It is possible that
 sometime this spring this working group may issue a report to the
 govornments represented, and if this should happen, public and
 parliamentary discussion of the MLF concept will probably become
 more active.  Although France has already refused to join in any
 MI2, and has taken no part in the working group's discussions,
 French newspapers and other media will doubtless also join in any
 widespread debate on the merits of such a force.
 Purpose and Proposal.  The plan for a multilateral force
 orb ina es in the  esi :^e of the US government to          tie co-
 hes.. of NATO, to keep NATO weapons systems up-to--Cates                     to  iv'-
 hibit the proliferation of national nuclear forces, and to offer
 NATO governments (particularly the West German government) a
 satisfactory means of participation in NATO nuclear planning and
 operations within the framework of NATO itself.  Specifically,
 the plan undo: :d?nsjderatU.on calls for a force of appro.cdmately
 2..1 nac2cha .a.ti,; r - sh:_s..-v;,  armed with sore 230 Poiar s, A-3 ra-      es.
 This  for(;:: v  u~d  be  a in 'd,  controlled  and   f.~?~:] :dpi by thos ? IAA 'O
 countries decic : ng to p:, ,ticip?te, under                 made up of
 representatives from tk   e countries.          NATO co4 '2ntries not joining
 at the outset would still be allowed to join later on.
 No member country would contribute more than 40% of the cost
 of the force, and each ship would be manned by personnel from at
 least three countries, with no country providing more than 40%
 of any crew  Crews would be under 200 men each, and the total
 force, including the operating agency, would number less than
 10,000 men. During the first five years, the average annual
 costs for participating European countries would be between 3/4
 of one percent and four percent of their average annual defense
 outlays; for a European country assuming a tenth of the total
 cost, the average annual cost in the first five years would be
 $ 3 iillion, dropping to an average of $16 million in later years.
 (Costs would be 50 to 75 percent of the cost of building a sub-
 marine force with the same number of missiles, and virtually all
 the participants can share in building the ships; further, the
 building of this force would take less than three-fourths of the
 time required to build a comparable submarine force.)  Any use
 of the missiles would necessarily be coordinated with US strategic
 forces, which are much larger and which have current intelligence
 any plans essential for effective operation; for the foreseeable
 future, the US would be a member of the force.  US representa-
 tives have stated, however, that the MLF might possibly become a
 purely European force at some future time if Europe achieves the
 necessary degree of unity, with the British and French merging th ?

 nuclear armament pro ;rams into a common European program.  For
 the present proposal, US participation will be subject to the
 approval of the US Congress.
 Advantages.  US representatives have never suggested that
 this plan was sacred, or above criticism, but so far it appears
 to be the best solution proposed for the problems involved; the
 Eisenhower, Iennedy, and Johnson administrations have all sup-
 ported it.  NATO cannot work smoothly if there are two classes
 of members:  a nuclear club and a remainder who provide infantry.
 An increase in the number of national nuclear forces means an
 increase in the danger that some future 17.itler (or Stalin) might
 touch off a nuclear holocaust.  And under present conditions,
 European forces can only constitute credible deterrents to Soviet
 aggression if they are coordinated with the principal military
 forces in the West, those of the US.
 The MIX is designed to solve these problems.   Its advantages
 include:
 1.   It gives Germany and Italy equality with-
 out arous ng any jus     a   ears.  Germany
 and  to y cannot be expected  to-accept an
 inferior status, and refusal to permit West
 Germany to share in a nuclear force would
 encourage the tendency of Franz Josef Strauss
 and others to demand national nuclear
 forces -- which in turn would cause alarms
 in the West and perhaps provoke Soviet po-
 litical or military action.
 2.   It keeps nuclear armament in the ITATO frame-
 work.  DeGaulle is disposed to beep +renc
 To-es as independent as possible.  Ee
 Would like to enlist German support for the
 force de frappe, in effect splitting NATO.
 3.   It averts nuclear proliferation with its
 attendant evils.  Every new nuclear power
 makes disarmament agreements more difficult
 and increases the danger of nuclear war.
 Only the wealthiest nations can bear the ex-
 pense of national nuclear weapons without im-
 posing hardships on their peoples.
 4.   It fills a real future defense need.  The
 Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SAC UE)
 desires a counter to Soviet medium range
 ,missiles in Europe.

 The proposed MLF will have as much delivery
 power as the whole UK nuclear force and
 much more power than the force de frappe.
 5.  It will not be dangerous or provocative.
 The      w      e located at sea, and a  no
 fixed point.    It will not attract attack
 to populated areas.  It will be a second-
 strike force, that is a force capable of
 surviving an enemy first strike, and there-
 fore not a force which must be used first
 if it is to be used at all.
 6.   It will provide a new US commitment to the
 de ense of   rope.  DeGaulle and o  ers
 sometimes suggest that, at some future
 time, in a European crisis, the US might
 not use its weapons, in the hope that
 the Soviets would confine their attack to
 Europe.  Actually, the Soviets would
 hardly dare to leave US strategic forces
 untouched while attacking NATO forces
 (including US forces) in Europe.  At all
 events the MLF places warheads under
 joint control, prevents their withdrawal
 from Europe by the US, and more firmly
 involves the US in a nuclear association
 with European countries.
 Another advantage, of less apparent interest to Europeans,
 should also be mentioned:  the establishment of an MILT' would
 spread the burden of NATO defense more widely, taking more
 of the weight off the shoulders of Uncle Sam.  Actually, it
 would serve the long term interests of Europe itself if US
 balance-of-payment difficulties were eased.
 Attitudes toward MLF.  Government leaders in Germany,
 Italy, _    ey, and  reece favor the MLF.  France, as noted,
 has already declined to participate.  The UIK has not ruled
 out participation, but both the Conservatives and Labour have
 strong doubts about the concept.  The Tories are more nation-
 alistic and wedded to tradition (including the Ro:al Navy),
 and they are committed to maintaining a UK national force.
 Labour opposes all non-US nuclear forces (includiv  UKa and,
 -especially. West German), suggests an emphasis on conventional
 forces (which by itself would be welcomed by the US), and one
 of its sosesmen (Patrick Gordon Walker) has argued that
 European nations should share in planning and controlling US
 strategic nuclear forces by a directorate or consultative com-
 mittee.  This last has not appealed to other Europeans, and the
 US Congress would hardly sanction such a proposal.  Other NATO
 countries, particularly Holland and Belgium, will tend to
 follow the lead of the UK.

 Various arguments are advanced against the MLF.   Informa-
 tion already given above serves to dispose of some of these
 arguments:   e.g., that the force is strategically insignificant
 and was only proposed for political reasons; that the MLF would
 be prohibitively expensive; or that the US might take its
 missiles and go home.  The Soviets and some West Europeans
 argue that sooner or later this MLF will help to give the West
 Germans nuclear weapons, nuclear know-how, and nuclear inde-
 pendence, thus promoting rather than blocking the proliferation
 of nuclear weapons, and indeed giving them to the "Bonn mil-
 itarists."  Those impressed by such criticism should realize
 that, within the MLF, the division of crews and the use of
 Permissive Action Link controls will prevent national use of
 the weapons without outside (inter-allied) agreement, while in
 the long run technical knowledge is no significant barrier to
 a West German nuclear capability; aside from enlistment in
 something like MLF, the only long-term way to keep West Germany
 from independent nuclear armament is to carry out general
 disarmament, verified by inspection.   It is foolish to think
 that Germany can be kept permanently in an inferior status.
 O,thhrs critics, like Lord Beaverbrockts Daily Express, try to
 make fun of the concept of a multi-nation force, considering
 the idea preposterously unworkable.  They ignore the fact that,
 for centuries, merchant ships have been manned by sailors from
 many nations.
 Most criticisms of the MLF stem from ingrained habits of
 thought an   a  owe  national traditions, rather than from
 rational analysis.     ese habits an traditions are not to be
 pooh-poohed; we share them regarding our own country.  Men are
 taught that their country is always right, that everything which
 tends to build up their country is good, and that they should
 be prepared to die for their country.  Most people want their
 country to be a "Great Power"--especially if it has been one in
 the past--and today the possession of nuclear weapons is the
 main criterion of Great Power status.  77.1 fl7 pO sle in all wr as
 tend to distrust foreigners, considering them less than fully
 human; at present many individuals make a career of spreading
 distrust against West Germany and against the United States.
 Organizations with long names and initials, with committees and
 staffs, whose members speak in foreign languages or foreign
 accents, do not ovol:e enthusi Lsm. ,  There is nothing thrilling
 about them.  Some of these organizations might be more popular
 if they went in more for bands, medals, flags, and ceremonies;
 if they enlisted more colorful personalities as leaders; if the
 prose they published was more hard-hitting and less bureaucratic;
 or if they could uncover some honorable historical antecedents.
 Precedents for international forces.
 Actually, there is nothing very revolutionary about the
 concept of an international force.  Aside from mixed merchant
 crews, already mentioned, military organizations from the Roman
 Legions to the French Foreign Legion have enlisted aliens in
 their ranks.  Multilateral forces have a precedent in the Peking

 Relief Expedition of 1933 and in the various UN forces.  National
 leaders are highly tempted to rationalize a national approach
 which makes themselves look supreme; yet no major modern wars
 have been fought without alliances, and peacetime plans for mili-
 tary cooperation involve a surrender of absolute sovereignty and
 a commitment to support allies, as all the major European powers
 discovered in 1914.  Under today's conditions, peacetime alliance
 structures must necessarily be strong, if they are to have any
 value at all.  In event of war, there will no longer be time to
 negotiate and set up organizations.  Staffs, early warning radar
 systems, the exchange of intelligence, coimaon equipment patterns,
 and common supply systems must all be worked out in peacetime,
 The truth is that neither the US nor Europe can deter the
 Sovie s a one; each needs the other.  Sovereign, independent
 action is an illusion when it comes to nuclear warfare.  Simi-
 larly, the traditional military virtues of ardor in the attic`:
 or steadiness under fire have little relevance to nuclear war.
 There is still plenty of room for national pride and accomplish-
 ment, just as there is plenty of room for individual courage and
 initiative, in non-nuclear warfare as in peaceful activities.
 But nuclear warfare cannot be used to serve national policies

 770 AF  Bow The Communists Subvert The African Press
 BACKGROUND:  hacking the Communist parties which in other
 areas are Its principal carriers for propaganda, persuasion and
 subversion, international communism must rely on individuals
 and front organizations to do their work in Africa.  The bur-
 geoning African press, newly independent, laclaing trained per-
 sonnel and equipment, ambitious for a political role and reflec-
 tive of the furious nationalism of its leaders is a logical and
 vulnerable target for Communist penetration.  By playing on the
 anti-colonialist, socialist or neutralist sentiments of many
 Africans and displaying a strong instinct for putting their money
 where it will pay off, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia have
 made inroads into Africa.  Ghanaian and Algerian media, both dis-
 tributed beyond their own borders, are vociferously anti European,
 anti-capitalist supporters of the Soviet Communist line.  (The
 Chinese effort does not yet equal the Soviet but is reportedly
 a priority effort and will unquestionably increase with expanded
 diplomatic and INCITA facilities in the area.)  As other East Afri-
 can countries become independent, the familiar pattern of ex-
 ternal Communist influence and Communist-serving local extremism
 will undoubtedly be repeated.

 gflWE.   Latin America's Role in the Alliance for Progress
 BACKGROUND:   March 13 marked the third anniversary of the
 A.llianc     for ogress.  On that date in 1961, President Kennedy
 invited the Latin American ambassadors to the White House and
 called upon their governments and people to join with the United
 States in a... "vast effort unparalleled in magnitude and
 nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs of the American
 people for homes, work and land, health and schools."  The
 Charter of the Alliance, signed the following August at Punta
 del Este, Uruguay, was equally optimistic in its intent:   ",Ye,
 the American Republics, hereby proclaim our decision to unite
 in a common effort to bring our people accelerated progress
 and broader social justice within the framework of personal
 dignity and political liberty."
 The Alliance, intended to bring about a "decade of progress"
 has., th'3 Pol'oC'ing pals (among ?o" ars) : a per capita economic growth
 rate of not less than 2.5%; "a more equitable distribution of
 national income"; "programs of comprehensive agrarian reform";
 elimination of adult illiteracy; opportunity for six years of
 primary schooling for all children; increase of life expectancy
 by five years at birth; reduction of housing shortages; main-
 tenance of stable price levels and stable currencies; joint
 programs designed to prevent fluctuations in the prices of the
 Hemisphere's basic products.
 Even granting that some of these goals were optimistic,
 the results to date are disappointing to all concerned.  The
 economic growth rate is the most objective indicator of progress:
 far from growing at an annual rate of 2.5q%, the gross national
 product of Latin America has barely been able to keep ahead of
 the birth rate.  The attached table illustrates the slowness of
 the economic growth and the present tendency toward leveling off,
 or actually declining.   It reflects that the per capita income
 has been increasing at approximately 1.1% per year, with an
 actual decrease of a fraction of 1% in 1962.   Although figures
 are not yet avc.'lable for 1963, there are indications that the
 overall economy of Latin America may have suffered a greater
 decline than in 1962.
 This situation, coupled with the "revolution of rising
 expectations," and the feeling that the Alliance for Progress
 would work some sort of miracle, has created among practically
 all Latin Americans a sense of deep disappointment and frustrated
 hope.    As a result of Communist propaganda and misguided national-
 ism, a great many, if not most, Latin Americans are now blaming
 the United States; few blame themselves.

 It is generally agreed among U.S, economists that the
 most important immediate cause of the economic stagnation of
 Latin America is the flight of capital:  native capitalists
 seek the security of U.S. and European banks and corporations;
 foreign investors find better investment conditions elsewhere.
 It has been estimated that between 5 and 25 billion dollars in
 Latin American money is invested abroad, certainly enough to
 Semen   'he investment program of the Alliance for Progress
 without any outside help.
 But although we isolate the flight of capital as the most
 important single cause of economic depression in Latin America,
 we must recognize that it, in turn, has its roots in prior
 causes, which are largely political:  government instability,
 threat

 Far too much emphasis has been placed on direct govern-
 ment-to-government aid and not enough on the enormous contribu-
 tion which private investment is capable of making.  President
 Kennedy undoubtedly had this in mind during his last major
 foreign policy speech when he said in Miami, November 18, 1963:
 Private enterprise also has an important role
 in the Alliance for Progress.  There is not enough
 available public capital, either in the United
 States or Latin America, to carry development for-
 ward at the pace demanded...   If encouraged,
 private investment, responsive to the needs, the
 laws and the interests of the nation, can cooperate
 with public activity to provide the vital margin
 of success; as it did in the development of all
 the nations of the West, including my own.
 Therefore, the Alliance for Progress is not so much the
 central problem it would appear to be on this its third anni-
 versary.  It has merely served to focus attention upon a con-
 tinuing, more fundamental condition:  an economic problem that
 25  "'Mres a political solution.

 CZ CHOSLOVAXIA FALTERS :   1956-1963
 1.     Introduction
 Czechoslovakia is no longer a model Satellite.  Rates of
 industrial growth, formerly close to the highest among the
 world's developed countries, have fallen, and an increase of
 merely 1 percent in industrial production was planned for 1963.
 The rapid buildup of investment begun in 1956 has given way to
 a contraction.  plans for a further substantial expansion of
 Czechoslovakia's already large foreign aid program to countries
 of both the Bloc and the Free World are in jeopardy, and the
 government may even have asked for Soviet help.  The population,
 which had seemed to accommodate itself increasingly to the sys-
 tem, has been expressing more openly its dissatisfaction with
 living conditions.  And the Communist regime, which had given
 an appearance of unity, confidence, and unusual stability for
 a Satellite country, recently has shown signs of strain, inde-
 cesion, and division.
 In spite of the recent economic difficulties the Czecho-
 slovak Communist regime remains firmly in power, and its economic;
 policies and orientation have not basically changed.  The dif-
 ficulties, however, have made the regime much more cautious in
 its economic policies, weakened the position of ?resident
 Antonin Novotny, impaired the image of Czechoslovakia as an in-
 dustrialized nation achieving rapid economic progress under Com-
 munism, and weakened Czechoslovakia's stature in the Soviet Bloc
 in comparison with countries such as ?oland and Hungary, which
 recently have been more successful in their economic policies.
 The rate of industrial growth, which averaged 9 percent per
 year during 1356-63, declined to 6 percent in 1932, and an in-
 crease of only 1 percent in industrial production was planned for
 1363.  Capital investments expanded rapidly and steadily between
 1355 and 1930, increased only 7 percent in 1961, fell by 5 per-
 cent in 1332, ar_d w ere planned to decline again in 1953.  Gross
 agricultural production, which had shown a slow upward trend
 since 1954, leveled off in 1961 and declined in 1962, reaching
 the lowest level in C years.  On a net basis -- after deduction
 of the value of current inputs -- production in 1962 was esti-
 mated to be below any year since 1940-49.
 The growing economic difficulties have been reflected in
 foreign trade.  The Czechoslovak export surplus, which amounted
 to between $103 million and $233 million in 1931.  The surplus
 with the 17est 6ocliuod each year between 1956 and 1960, al-
 though Czechoslovakia was accumulating new credit commitments,
 and was replaced by a deficit in 1961.   In 1362 a much larger
 surplus again was achieved, and the balance with the West was
 improved substantially 1)but at the expense of domestic invest-
 ment and consumption.
 But those statistics do not tell the whole story of the
 economic deterioration in Czechoslovalsia.  Although total in-
 dustrial production in 1361-62 was not too far behind the goal

 set in the Third Five Year Ulan (1951-65) -- an average annual
 growth of 9.3 percent 2)--the lags were large in branches (such
 as steel and heavy machine building) on which the regime counted
 most heavily for sustaining the rate of economic growth in the
 latter part of the Third Five Year Plan.  These cumulating dif-
 ficulties consequently led the regime to abandon the Third Five
 Year Plan in mid-1932 and to try to evolve a more successful
 economic policy.
 Although investments had long been the principal basis for
 industrial expansion in Czechoslovakia, the use of reserves --
 of labor, productive capacity, and organization of work --- also
 had played a role.  By the late 1953's these reserves were near-
 ing exhaustion, but their exhaustion was neither sudden nor
 entirely unexpected.  For some years the regime had realized
 that new ways of increasing economic efficiency would have to
 be found if the rate of growth was not to decline eventually.
 For some years also the hopes of the regime for an acceleration
 of technological change and a marked improvement in the quality
 and assortment of production had been disappointed, but it had
 been possible to postpone the day of reckoning.  By 1952, how-
 ever, a further postponement was no longer possible.
 The Third Five Year Plan, which was first drafted in 1953
 and was in many respects a 7-year plan or perhaps even a 3-
 year plan, based economic growth mainly on a massive investment
 program, especially in basic industries, and on the introduction
 of new technology at an accelerated rate not only in new plants
 but also through the reconstruction of old plants.  The indus-
 trial plan relied only to a small extent on increased employ-
 meat, and only in the machine building industry was-it expected
 to uncover substantial reserves of unused productive capacity.
 Special emphasis was given to steel and machine building be-
 cause of the key importance of these industries in the Czecho-
 slova?k economy.   (Czechoslovakia is one of the world's largest
 producers and consumers of steel on a per capita basis, and its
 machinery industry not only supports the bulk of domestic in-
 vestments but also supplies 45 percent of exports.)  A partial
 decentralization of economic management was undertaken during
 1953-33 with a view to stimulating technological change and
 making production more responsive to demand.
 In spite of a recognition by the Communist regime that new
 approaches to the economy were needed, however, the predominant
 policy was still to increase the volume of production as fast
 as possible by any means available.   It was planned that past
 rates of growth in industrial production would be maintained ap-
 proximately, and the economic system continued to be geared to
 achieving good quantitative, but not qualitative, results.
 Bonuses for managers and workers continued to be based mainly
 on fulfillment of the production plan, and relatively small
 weight was given to quality, assortment, and technology.  Sven
 more basically, no serious attack was made on a characteristic
 problem of all economies of the Soviet Bloc -- the lack of ade-
 quate criteria for making rational choices on the details on

 economic activity.  Novotny himself, when discussing economic
 problems at a mid-November 1961 meeting of his ?arty's Central
 Committee, admitted this basic weakness in the following words
 3):
 We do not yet know how to open the way to science
 and technology in our organizational and planning prac-
 tice, how to support materially and morally enterprises
 and institutes that achieve real successes in the im-
 plementation of new technology and in scientific work,
 how to give more advantages to plants fighting for the
 new as compared with all those which hold fast to bacl.-
 ward technology and technique.  Cie have not yet been
 able to really guide the development of technology and
 decide on the direction of its development.
 Czechoslovakia appeared to be a model Satellite during the
 late 1953's, as the rate of industrial growth remained high, the
 growth of investment accelerated, the foreign aid program ex-
 panded, and even personal consumption increased.  Under the sur-
 face, however, economic problems were multiplying. The apparent
 successes were achieved through favorable weather for agriculture
 in 1933, by using up some of the few remaining "reserves," and by
 postponing expenditures wherever possible.  Because of increas-
 ing demands for nonagricultural labor and the effects of col-
 lectivization, the flight of labor from agriculture increased
 cconsiderably, averaging about 103,003 persons a year during 1957-
 "he postponement of investment expenditures in transporta-
 tion further increased the strain on existing facilities.  The
 rate of retirement of fixed assets was not increased as planned
 but actually declined in 1059-G0 because of growing pressure on
 productive capacity.  By these means the regime was able to cover
 up the failure of its pro,-ram to accelerate technological change.
 Investments were not completed on schedule, and growing amounts
 of resources consequently were tied up in unfinished projects.
 Uany new plants were out into operation during this period or
 soon afterwards -- for example, rolling mills with a capacity
 o-  3.4 million metric tons of steel were installed in the late
 1353ts 4)--but the new facilities often had serious technical
 wea':nesses that could not be remedied quickly.   In many instances,
 plans for obtaining or applying sophisticated technology were not
 men,.  And the quality of products continued to be poor and their
 assortment ill-suited to the requirements of domestic and foreign
 users.
 By the end of 1033 it should have been clear to the regime
 that the rate of economic growth had to decline.  The introduc-
 tion of new technology was far behind schedule.  Moreover, the
 continued postponement of retirements and the continued large-
 scale transfers of labor from agriculture were bound before long
 to have a negative impact on the economy.   Instead of recogniz-
 ing this fact, the regime actually raised the original goals for
 production and investments for 1965.  The planned rate of in-
 dustrial growth of 9.3 percent per year for 1931-65 was the same

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 as that achieved in the previous 5 years.*  By pursuing an un-
 realistic plan for nearly 2 years, by trying to get by with ex-
 pedient solutions to developing problems, and by allowing ideo-
 logy to dominate agricultural policy, the regime made the coun-
 try's economic difficulties worse than they might have otherwise.
 III.  Economic Policies and Developments in 1961-62
 The regime contributed to Czechoslovakia's economic dif-
 ficulties mainly by overestimating the country's economic capa-
 bilities.                     Too much was expected of economic reforms carried out
 in 1958-60** as well as of various forms of exhortation and
 persuasion, and it was assumed too readily that the performance
 of agriculture would improve.  No provision was made for con-
 tingencies.  Another mistake was to make economic plans reflect
 the expected gains in efficiency; the new sources of efficiency
 that were sought couldzbt be developed by putting strong pres-
 sure on the producer to raise the volume of current output.   In-
 deed, such pressure was almost bound to impede progress in tech-
 nology, quality, and assortment, just as it had in the past.
 By pursuing unrealistic plans the regime probably took away any
 chance that the decentralization of 1958-63 would stimulate eco-
 nomic efficiency.   Indeed, under conditions of high pressure to
 increase output, the decentralization led mainly to a weakening
 of economic priorities and a consequent misallocation of re-
 sources.
 From the beginning of the Third Five Year Man, Czecho-
 slovakia had difficulty in meeting output goals.  The plan for
 total industrial production was nearly fulfilled in 1961, but
 there were large lags in production of steel and heavy machinery
 and some lag also in investments, as is shown in the Table.
 These lags were especially serious because the phasing of the
 Third Five Year ?lan required a faster buildup of investments
 in the first part than in the latter part of the plan period.
 The immediate cause of the lags in production of steel (a growth
 of 14 percent was planned for rolled steel in 1961, but only 4
 percent was achieved) was that planned improvements in tech-
 nology, especially the use of oxygen in existing plants, were
 not made.   In turn, the shortfalls in steel affected machine
 building, where technological development also was lagging.
 Severe strain also was manifested in transportation during 1961,
 when the railroads found that they could no longer satisfy the
 increasing demands placed on them.  Early in 1961, rail t:rano-
 port became an economic bottlemenck in Czechoslovakia for the
 first time since the Communist takeover and was itself disrupted
 further as a result of the very uneven fulfillment of the in-
 dustrial production plan.  The lack of reserves in transportation

 year in 1956-63, but this claim is believed to be inflated

 was revealed most clearly during the military mobilization
 measures of the fall of 1961 and again during the unusually
 severe winter of 1962-62.  Another source of concern was the
 growing number of uncompleted investment projects, reflecting
 the inability of the construction industry to handle the grow-
 ing volume of investments efficiently and the inadequate control
 exercised over new  rrr:,,
 Gross agri.cultu_?ai production did not change in 1961, and
 net production declined.  Consequently, consumption of food
 stagnated while, for the first time in several years, there was
 only a very small increase in consumption of industrial goods.
 The economic strain was reflected in foreign trade as improts
 of machinery and industrial materials exceeded plan, and there
 was a large shortfall in exports of machinery and equipment.
 Imports from the West rose rapidly, partly because of a very
 large increase in imports of steel, coal, and wheat to compen-
 sate for part of the shortfall in domestic output.  Exports of
 machinery were held down by the lag in output of heavy machine
 building, by the inadequate assortment of products, and by the
 sharp decline of trade with Communist China.  These unfavorable
 trends caused a large decline in the export surplus with the
 Soviet Bloc and a shift from an export surplus to an import sur-
 plus with the West -- a situation that could not last, because
 of Czechoslovakia's large and growing foreign aid commitments
 and deficit on service transactions.
 The regime persisted in regarding economic problems that
 were developing in 1961 as temporary and hoped to be able to
 pursue the Third Five Year Plan.  An increase of 14 percent in
 production of steel was planned for 1962 (compared with an aver-
 age annual growth of about 9 percent for 1961-65) --- enough to
 make up for the shortfall of 1961. A similarly high plan was
 established for heavy machine building.  Some of the original
 goals for investments in 1962 had to be lowered, notably in the
 chemical and metallurgical industries, and the completion of
 some facilities expected to be in operation in that year was
 postponed.7)  Simultaneously the foreign trade balance, especial-
 ly with the 'West, was to be greatly improved, and machinery ex-
 ports were to be increased by 27 percent.C)
 The economic situation grew steadily worse during 1962.
 production of steel increased faster than in 1961, but, once
 again, much more slowly than planned, for essentially the same
 reasons as in the previous year.  Output of heavy machine build-
 ing increased at about half the planned rate, partly because of
 the lag in output of steel.  Lags in the installation and in-
 efficient operation of new power-generating capacity and a drought
 that cut the capacity of hydroelectric power-plants caused pro-
 duction of electric power to fall far short of plan and led to
 a serious shortage of power. Continued shortages of freight cars,
 as well as uneven fulfillment of production plans, caused disrup-
 tion in the distribution of industrial materials, as reflected
 in production stoppages for lack of materials in some places and

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 unnecessarily large inventories in other places.  Total indus-
 trial production rose only 6.2 percent compared with a planned
 9.3 percent, as the growth of both employment and labor pro-
 ductivity declined.  The construction industry also was unable
 to fulfill its tasks.
 Agricultural production declined sharply to the lowest
 level in 7 years, partly because of unfavorable weather but
 partly also because of the ill effects of collectivization and
 subsequent policies of the regime on farmers' incentives.   In-
 stead of trying to stimulate interest in raising production and
 improving techniques, the regime in 1931-62 concentrated on
 gaining control over an increasing share of output by reducing
 payments in kind to collective farmers and placing further re-
 strictions on the remnants of the farm market.
 The foreign trade balance improved substantially as a re-
 sult of an increase of 7.2 percent in exports compared with only
 2.3 percent in imports,9) and the shortage of hard currency was
 eased.  The sharp increase in the export surplus, however, cut
 into cloriestic investment and consumption and also may have been
 partly responsible for the tight supply of industrial materials.
 Capital investment fell v percent below the level of 1931, not
 only because output of machinery and construction lagged but also
 because equipment originally designed for domestic use was ex-
 ported.lO)Similarly the stagnation of personal consumption in
 1932 was due both to the decline in food production and to re-
 strictions on imports of foods and increased exports of namu-
 factured consumer goods.
 The dissatisfaction of the population grew considerably in
 1932, not only because of the stagnation in consumption but also
 because of a severe imbalance on the consumer market. 11) The
 imbalance took mainly the form of a shortage of meat and other
 quality foods, which resulted in extended queuing before food
 stores.  Having become accustomed to a steady, if slow, increase
 in consumption and to a reasonably smooth distribution of goods,
 the population grew increasingly resentful of the shortages,
 and  there were even some riots in the first half of 1962.
 IV.   Policies and Plans for 1963-70
 By mid-1962 the cumulative deterioration of the economy
 had convinced the regime that the Third Five Year Plan could
 not be fulfilled.  Accordingly the plan was abandoned, and the
 Czechoslovel; regime had to find a new approach to economic
 policy. The new approach was evolved during the second half
 of 1962, with criticism, apparent indecision, and some disagree-
 raent within the ?arty, and was incorporated into an interim plan
 for 13163 and a Seven Year Plan for 1964-70.
 1.  Publication of the "Perspectives"
 The first official disclosure that the regime was prepar-
 ing to abandon the Third Five Year Plan and the first intimations
 7
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 of a change in aims and methods were contained in a lengthy
 document of the Central Committee of the Communist Party pub-
 lished in mid-August 1962. 12) This document, entitled "Per-
 spectives for the yButure Development of Our Socialist Society"
 (hereafter referred to as the "Perspectives") was prepared for
 nationwide discussion in preparation for the Twelfth Party Con-
 gress, which eventually was held in December 1962.
 The "Perspectives" set forth the new approach in the fol-
 lowing statement:   "The Central Committee has ... come to the
 conclusion that it will be desirable in the next few years to
 distribute our forces and means better, and to set targets so
 as to secure the porportionate development of the economy, and
 to create necessary reserves by exceeding these targets.   In
 this way it will be possible to reduce the excessive strain in
 fulfilling the plan, to avoid defects in the supply of materials,
 and to insure smooth running of the economy and normal, even worm
 in enterprises."  Clearly the "high-pressure" planning of the
 past was to be avoided because of the disruption and imbalances
 to which it had led.  Economic plans would be more realistic and
 less influenced by political pressure and also would allow for
 contingencies.  However, the extent of the necessary retrench-
 ment was not indicated, and the "Perspectives" at the same time
 strongly reemphasized the basic priorities of the Third Five
 Year Plan -- the rapid development of steel and heavy machine
 building -- priorities that had not been observed during 1961-
 02.  Consumption would have to be held down, as the "Perspectives"
 clearly indicated, and central controls over the economy would
 have to be tightened.  The "Perspectives" also made explicit
 some far-reaching proposals for further institutional reforms in
 agriculture that had been discussed in speeches and the press for
 2 or 3 years.  These proposals not only involved amalgamation of
 collectives and payment of fixed wages to collective farmers but
 even entailed the elimination of the private plots of collective
 farmers -- potentially a highly disruptive measure.
 2.  Subsequent Discussion
 It is clear that Novotny and the "Perspectives" were under
 attac1: for several months and that in working out the new ap-
 proach to economic matters several lines of policy that had been
 tentatively set forth in the "Perspectives" were modified by the
 time the final Party Directives were adopted at the 't'welfth
 Party Congress early in December.  Basically the evolution of
 economic policy during the period between the "Perspectives" and
 the Directives was in the direction of even greater caution in
 economic planning, of increased emphasis on agriculture, of a
 somewhat less negative approach to consumer desires, and of some
 toning down of the plans for potentially disruptive changes in
 agriculture.   In no case was there a basic change in approach
 from that taken in the '"Perspectives," but the final policy may
 well reflect a compromise between more divergent views.
 3.  The Party Congress
 The basic reason for the increasing restraint in economic
 policy was the continued deterioration of the economic situation
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : QIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000200070002-2
 during the second half of 1962, especially the decline in agri-
 cultural production that may not have been fully anticipated at
 the time the "P?erspectives" was written.
 It seers clear that as a result, some early assumptions
 for the plan for 1963 were revised sharply downward in November
 or December 1962.  When the first definite goals of the plan
 for 1963 were released, 13) after the Party Congress in December,
 the percentage increase for industrial production had been re-
 duced to a mere 1 percent -- an unprecedentedly low figure in
 the entire Soviet Bloc.  The original target had been set proba-
 bly at more than 5 percent.  And, as was indicated earlier, in-
 creased caution and emphasis on agriculture and exports were re-
 flected in the discussions and directives of the Party Congress.
 The whole spirit of the Twelfth Party Congress lacked the
 optimism usually displayed at such gatherings and suggested that
 the Party leadership was seriously concerned about how to get
 its economic house in order.   Instead of focusing on the past
 achievements of socialism and the prospects for a brilliant
 future, almost every speaker devoted most of his time to criti-
 cizing present shortcomings.                   The leadership placed some of the
 blame for the country's economic difficulties on "external in-
 fluences of both a political and economic character"   (by im-
 plication, mainly the Berlin crisis, which had led to higher de-
 fense expenditures than had been planned). 14) Another scape-
 goat was the enterprise manager who had "misunderstood" the in-
 creased responsibility given to him in the decentralization of
 1950-60 and acted contrary to the national interest. 15) The
 leadership itself had to accept some blame for having planned
 the economy without "adequate technical preparation" or allowance
 for contingencies.  In fact, Novotny'sstatement that "subjec-
 tivism in planning is the greatest evil," 16) made at a Party
 meeting in March 1963, can be read only as an implicit admission
 of his own responsibility for the economic deterioration.
 4.  Characteristics of the New Policy
 The 11-point program approved by the Twelfth Party Congress
 formed the basic part of the published ?arty Directives. 17)
 This program, which followed the general approach of the "Per-
 spectives," had the following characteristics:
 a.  3conomic plans were to be carefully worked out and to
 be conservative enough to allow ample room for contingencies.
 Eigh-pressure planning, such as had been practiced by the Novotny
 regime since its inception, would be dropped.   In support of the
 new plans, more attention than before was to be given to new
 technology, better quality and assortment of products, and
 closer intra-Bloc economic cooperation.  Export commitments were
 to be met even at the cost of domestic investment.
 b.  Agriculture was to receive increased attention by the
 Party.  Czechoslovakia had to solve its own agricultural problem.
 and could not expect to fill an ever-growing agricultural deficit
 from Soviet Bloc sources.

 C.  The consumer could not expect a significant improvement
 in his living conditions until the economic situation, and es-
 pecially the agricultural situation, had considerably improved.
 d.  The state and Party would have to exercise much tighter
 control than before over economic activity to insure that es-
 tablished priorities were observed and that economic develop-
 ment would follow the lines established in the plans.  Enter-
 prises would lose thereby most of the increased authority that
 they had acquired during the 1353-63 reforms, at least until
 such time as an effective system of incentives could be worlhed
 out.
 5.  Specific Features of the New Plans
 The evidence of a shift to more conservative planning lay
 in a great slowing down of the growth of fixed investment during
 "the next 2 or 3 years" 13); in the considerably reduced rates
 of growth planned for key industrial branches like steel, elec-
 tric power, and machine building during 1904-73; and in the very
 small growth planned for 1933 in industrial production as a whole.
 The reduction in rates of growth planned for some leading
 industrial products and branches is illustrated in the following
 tabulation (in planned annual average percentage increases) 19):
 1361-35       1933-70
 Steel                             9.4             6
 Electric power                13             G to 7
 Pllachine building            12             1 to 10
 Judging from the above goals and past relationships, total in-
 dustrial production probably will be planned to grow by about 6
 to 7 percent per year, whereas the abandoned plan counted on an
 annual rate of 9.3 percent.  The planned rate of growth that is
 anticipated probably can be achieved, as it is well below the
 average rate of 9.2 percent a year estimated for 1956-G3 and
 about the same as the average rate estimated for 1331-62.
 The plan for 1913 called for an increase of only 1 percent
 in industrial production, an apparent decline in growth of labor
 productivity in industry, and a cut of 6 percent in capital in-
 vestments.  Never before had any Soviet Bloc country actually
 planned so little an increase as 1 percent in industrial pro-
 duction.  The over-all industrial goal for 1353 appears to be
 well below the goal that was envisaged by the regime when wor%
 on the plan began in mid-1962.  Lard reality had caught up with
 the Czech super-planners, with the Czech people paying the price
 in food shortages and postponed consurmer goods.

 SIN RESERVAS TRABAJADORES MEXICANOS APOYAN
 LA ALIANZA PARA EL PROGRESO
 La Confederation de Trabajadores de Mexico (C.T.M.) ha dado su apoyo "sin reservas" a la Alianza
 Para e: Progreso.
 Pero todavia mas importante es que la C.T.M. ha claborado planes concretos de action para aprove-

 ~Por que la C.T.M?, con todo su prestigio, fuerza e historic militante decidio que la mejor manera de
 alcanzar 1 -?justicia_social para sus trabajadores es por medio de la Alianza para el Progreso? ,Que descubrio
 la C.T.M. on Jos metodos y metas de la Alianza, que la indujo a ofrecerle su apoyo "sin reservas"?
 La C.T.M. declaro:

 In 1950, the population of all of Latin America was
 estimated at 150,000,000, and was increasing at 2.5% per
 year.  By 1962, it was 211,800,000, and was growing at 2.8%
 per year.   If this rate of growth remains unchanged, the
 population will double within a generation and be about
 500,000,000 by the end of the century.

 aggressive xenophobia. Instead of
 launching  progressive  programs,
 Washington had to spend a good
 deal of time  apologetically ex-
 plaining that it was not trying to
 re-colonize the Hemisphere.
 Another important reason for
 the Alliance's failure is a basic
 contradiction  in  its  conception.
 Ostensibly, the program is a de-
 liberate attempt to reach the masses
 over the heads of their govern-
 ments-the                                             oligarchs,              the  land-
 holders, and the politicos. It was
 to be aid with a new twist, or
 "social" rather than capital invest-
 ment. Benefits were to accrue di-
 rectly to the downtrodden in a
 manner that would prevent their
 being stolen by the rich for ac-
 cumulation in numbered Swiss bank
 accounts.
 To qualify for aid under the Al-
 liance a country was supposed to
 agree to legislate steeper progres-
 sive income taxes; intensify land
 reform, which generally means ex-
 propriating the property of the large
 holders; pass anti-capital flight laws,
 and adopt other measures aimed
 at straightening out the selfish
 ruling classes. But in poor coun-
 tries reforms to soak the rich can
 often result in the redistribution
 of poverty, and not in the creation
 of new wealth. At the same time,
 there is general agreement that the
 Alliance for Progress has thus far
 been a failure. It must be said in
 all fairness, however, that the fail-
 ure was not predictable and the
 experiment was a reasonable and
 statesmanlike risk.
 When the Alliance was first be-
 gun, the United States expected to
 be dealing with rational partners
 eager for a joint approach to
 .solving economic and social prob-
 lems. But before long the reason-
 able and moderate Arturo Frondizi
 was deposed in Argentina, leaving
 the country at the mercy of rival
 military cliques that threatened civil
 war on the issue of the extent to
 which-not whether-the Peron-
 istas should be suppressed. And
 in Brazil another man who had
 been relied upon, Janio Quadros,
 suddenly resigned the Presidency
 and gave way to Joao Goulart, a
 man of consummate political- skills
 yet devoid of even an elementary
 sense of public administration. Al-
 most from the very start, therefore,
 instead of meeting a desire for
 cooperation the United States faced

 scholar now living in Latin America.
 such reforms tend to discourage
 those who have created wealth in
 the past from continuing to do so.
 The thinking behind these pre-
 requisites for Alliance aid seems
 to have been twofold. First, the
 people would be shown that the
 Communists are lying when they
 say that the United States is the
 natural ally of the exploiting plu-
 tocracy. Second, social-minded, pro-
 gressive, forward-looking democrats
 and Socialists would be brought to
 power and eliminate the Commu-
 nists from the Latin  American
 scene.
 The authors of the Alliance ap-
 parently reached the facile con-
 clusion that an undemocratic oli-
 garchy  selfishly  clinging  to  its
 priviliges was responsibly for the
 Hemisphere's problems. Had they
 given this more thought, they might
 have taken into account that the
 governments of Brazil, Argentina,
 Uruguay,  Chile,  Venezuela  and
 Colombia had been elected by ir-
 reproachable democratic processes.
 Moreover, the politicians elected
 would compact with the Devil to
 insure re-election; they would de-
 pose the Bishop of Rome, let
 alone redistribute land,  if they
 thought  it electorally profitable.
 Why, then, haven't they?
 One reason is that their admin-

 After the U.S. Ambassador made
 some public statements obviously
 designed to snatch the carpet from
 under the Generals' feet, they forced
 his withdrawal.
 Ambassadors, after all, are not
 supposed to govern the countries to
 which they are accredited. When
 they try, it usually leads to trouble
 or embarrassment. Recently, the
 American Embassy in Rio was ac-
 cused of using wheat counterpart
 funds to finance the election of
 anti-Communist deputies  to  the
 Brazilian Congress. In reply, the
 Embassy published a breakdown of
 the application of its wheat funds.
 One of the items listed was nearly

 rates  on indirect  taxes  merely-

 doubtful policy, for it transfers in-

 or from a more efficient sector of
 the economy to the least efficient:
 the government. Most Latin Ameri-
 can social security laws, incidental-
 ly, also fall under the heading of
 illusory legislation. The laws are
 passed; the deductions are made
 from the workers' payroll; and
 when it is time for him to receive
 the benefits, either his money has
 been eroded to nothing by infla-
 tion, or the benefit is simply not
 available.
 4. Primary   export   product
 prices. One of the certain signs
 of underdevelopment is excessive
 dependence on the exportation of
 one or a few non-manufactured
 products. On this score, the Com-
 munists have pressed the argument
 that foreign aid from capitalists is
 nothing more than a loan to the
 recipient  country  of what was
 stolen from it by paying low prices
 for its exports. Their statisticians
 take as their base the high prices
 from the Korean War period, then
 go on, to show that if these high
 prices had been maintained Latin
 America would have double the
 foreign exchange income it has to-
 day and would not need aid. When
 correct figures are used the argu-
 ment is shown to be largely non-

 should, be done about its element
 of truth.

 Kennedy Administration cooperated
 in this matter by going to' the
 absurd length of threatening physi-
 cal searches of airline passengers
 from Brazil to see if they carried
 correspondence  containing  flight`
 funds.
 Another area in which imposed
 legislation can backfire is land re-
 form. As noted earlier, such re-
 forms tend first of all to decrease
 production. Some Latin American
 governments may wish to under-
 take such a step on their own
 initiative, and in several instances
 it has worked out well. But if they
 are cajoled into doing so by the
 United States and the reform proves

 the Embassy was lying or had gone
 into the used paper business.
 It is simply impolitic to coerce
 countries into passing legislation
 favored by our own Agency for In-
 ternational Development. Yet doing
 so is one of the basic procedures
 of the Alliance. If the United States
 government feels that it must with-

 While few people seem to be
 aware of it, there is no land short-

 lack of land the reason for rural
 poverty. True, land may be in-

 makes sense only when access to
 the land is barred by unproductive
 hereditary land ownership. Where
 this is not the case, more often

 hardly any countries are sufficiently
 important as producers to control
 prices through reducing production.
 Meanwhile, they must continue to
 import goods at prices dictated by
 semi-monopolistic and oligopolistic
 manufacturers.
 The  United  States,  therefore,
 should encourage and participate in
 more world marketing agreements
 .on commodities. Whenever prices
 have skyrocketed, Washington has
 tried to make such agreements. But
 the right time to make them is
 when prices are low and the other
 contracting parties are likely to
 agree to reasonable conditions.
 5. Don't mix foreign policy with
 commercial interests. The com-
 mercial interests of U.S. firms do
 not necessarily coincide with the
 foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 government, and sometimes they
 obviously clash. American business-
 ;lien abroad, however, have a tend-
 ency to think that representatives
 of the U.S. government are on the
 scene only to protect them; that,
 in fact, their protection is the gov-
 ernment's primary function. Surely,
 there can be no objection to in-
 terference on the businessman's be-
 half when this does not conflict
 with more important political ob-
 jectives; but when it does, private
 commercial questions rightly be-
 come secondary. A good many
 American businessmen still refuse
 to recognize this.
 United States public utility firms
 all over Latin America are victims
 of a very difficult situation, having
 obligated  themselves  to  furnish
 services at fixed prices computed
 in currencies which have lost their
 value. Consequently, they are un-
 able to give good service, let alone
 expand to serve growing economies.
 As their equipment becomes obso-
 lete, their services deteriorate and
 they become  an embarrassment
 even to the most well-meaning
 local government. They made bad
 commercial deals.
 The utility firms then turn to
 ment for assistance, hoping to get
 the most out of properties that are
 rapidly becoming worthless. There
 are situations where they may be
 helped, and others where it would
 be best to tell them. to pull their
 own chestnuts out of the fire. Where
 the latter obtains, they must be
 threatened  with  serious  conse-
 quences if they use their financial
 strength to force political inter-
 ference that may undermine the
 stability of the governments in the
 countries where they operate.
 6. Public Law 480: counterpart
 funds.  Ambassadors  should  be
 given use of a larger part of these
 funds and should be allowed to
 use them at their own discretion.
 An ambassador's hands should not
 be tied because at some place, at
 some time, some fool might. mis-
 appropriate funds or spend them in
 a manner inimical to U.S. interests.
 As it is, these counterpart funds
 are already lost to the U.S. econ-
 omy and lie about in depreciating
 currencies, steadily eroding away
 to nothing in central banks. The
 American taxpayer would be better
 served if ambassadors had them
 available for discretionary disburse-
 ments that are in our interest.
 that minimum restrictions be placed
 on these counterpart funds by the
 recipients of agricultural products.
 The availability of free funds can
 give ambassadors a greater ability
 to encourage policy decisions con-
 genial to the United States.
 7. Lend less and give more.
 Much of the lending done under
 foreign aid today is illusory; it is
 illusory  because  the  loans  are
 eternally renewed. Many recipient
 countries would be better served
 by outright grants, and the donor
 would be no worse off.
 8. Cut down propaganda activi-
 ties. American consulates and em-
 bassies are beginning to look ri-
 diculous in their propaganda. If
 it were only a question of money
 this would not matter, since the
 sums involved are not huge. The
 trouble is that those who are the
 targets of propaganda are more
 likely to become skeptical of the
 truth than convinced of it. The
 basic truths about the U.S. econ-
 omy, political systems and way of
 life are adequately covered by the
 wire services, magazines, and other
 unofficial communications media that
 do not provoke negative reactions.
 The best propaganda is supplied
 by the U.S. press when it explores
 the defects of our own society, for
 then the positive aspects of Ameri-
 can life seem all the more credible.
 In countries where a free and ade-
 quate press exists, official U.S.
 propaganda programs could be can-
 celed at no loss, and in many cases
 at a profit.
 THIS LIST of suggestions is hardly
 exhaustive. But it should help to
 make clear that if the Alliance is
 to be made effective, it must be-
 come more liberal in the classical
 sense. Though liberalism is old-
 fashioned, a continent that in many
 ways is still stranded in the 19th
 century can best assimilate the
 remedies appropriate to that period.
 In time, these very remedies will
 propel Latin America into the 20th
 Congress or to the Stateepat -1?ri~ip~lly$/27 n`~-FDP78-ii~st 1 A~~$070002-2
