 The recent attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports demonstrate that the Abu
 Nidal Group remains one of the most active-and ruthless-international terrorist
 organizations. We know of at least 23 incidents staged by the group in 1985; the
 toll was 34 dead and 327 wounded. Thirty-four of the casualties were US citizens
 (excluding those Americans wounded when Egyptian authorities stormed the
 hijacked Egyptair plane in Malta). Given this record of violence, another Abu
 Nidal attack appears to be virtually inevitable. The questions are: Where? When?
 We judge that West European countries currently holding Abu Nidal Group
 members are at particular risk of attack (see foldout table). The Abu Nidal Group
 has been known to stage retaliatory attacks against those countries that have
 imprisoned its members. In fact, the Abu Nidal political spokesman announced on
 8 January 1986 that, "some of our people are imprisoned in Europe. We are going
 to liberate them before long; that we can guarantee." At present, eight countries
 are holding a total of 22 Abu Nidal members.
 The group has already attacked British targets in attempts to force the release of
 its members. Under the name Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims
 (ROSM), it has conducted eight bombings and assassinations against British
 targets since March 1984. London has not been intimidated, however, and the
 group members remain in custody.
 Abu Nidal has also threatened retaliatory attacks against other West European
 person
 In addition to these pressure tactics, the Abu Nidal Group has also attempted to
 strike deals with several West European governments.

 Outlook
 We expect that Abu Nidal will stage further attacks in Western Europe; it not
 only has a motive to do so, but also it can apparently operate there with ease. We
 consider the following countries most likely targets or venues for attacks:
 ? The United Kingdom continues to hold five of the group's members.
 ? Italy and Greece will continue to be favorite staging areas, despite stepped-up
 security in those countries.
 ? Austria will be targeted as long as the government refuses to accede to Abu
 Nidal's demands for clemency for jailed members there.
 Less likely though still possible as targets for Abu Nidal are:
 ? Portugal and France, where group members are due to be released shortly.
 ? Spain, which has a substantial Abu Nidal presence, was not the site of any

 Possible CCC Attack To Free Leaders?
 Four key members of the Communist Combatant Cells (CCC)-including Pierre
 Carette, its alleged leader-were arrested on 16 December. Police speculate that
 the CCC nevertheless remains capable of staging a major attack-perhaps a
 kidnaping designed to pressure the government to release its imprisoned comrades.
 The most likely target would be a Belgian political official, although US or NATO
 denied that any armed forces personnel were among the victims.
 Conflict Over RFF Massacre
 The former leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces' (FARC) dissident group,
 the Ricardo Franco Front (RFF), Javier Delgado, reportedly has taken "credit" for
 the murder of more than 100 persons. The bodies were found in several mass
 graves in Cauca Department in December. The victims had been strangled or
 knifed; many, including children and pregnant women, had been tortured and
 mutilated. The massacre was described as an attempt to purge presumed
 infiltrators from the security forces, although Colombia's Defense Minister has
 The impact of the massacre on the 450-member Ricardo Franco Front could be
 devastating. The 19th of April Movement (M-19) has been closely linked to the
 RFF since last September, when the RFF joined a national guerrilla alliance led
 by the M-19. That link may now have been broken. The M-19 has condemned
 Delgado for ordering the killings and has called for the RFF's expulsion from the
 national guerrilla coordination group. The RFF reportedly has relieved Delgado of
 command and plans to try him for "arbitrary detentions, torture, and homicide."
 The group's rejection by the umbrella group is likely to weaken it still further.

 Police found one revolver on his body, and another revolver and a grenade in his
 briefcase, which bore the legend "Etco-Medi-Cuba," the name of a Cuban import-

 The civilian toll from recent bombings in Durban and landmine incidents along
 South Africa's border with Zimbabwe and Botswana suggest that the African
 National Congress (ANC) is less reluctant to hit nonmilitary targets in South
 Africa. Recent statements by ANC Acting President Oliver Tambo appear to
 confirm this. Tambo stated recently that the Durban bombing in December was
 not officially sanctioned by the ANC, suggesting that ANC local units may have
 acted unilaterally.

 Libya's Increasing Ties
 to Radical Palestinians
 The 27 December attacks on the El Al ticket counters
 in the Rome and Vienna airports have focused
 attention on the degree of Libyan involvement in these
 acts of terrorism. Even more significantly, they may
 be one more signal of increasing ties between Libya
 and radical Palestinian terrorist organizations like the
 Abu Nidal Group.
 Mu'ammar Qadhafi began supporting more radical
 Palestinians in the mid-1970s after deciding that
 Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
 Organization were becoming too moderate. Since
 then, Libya sporadically has provided funding, arms,
 training, and safehaven to most of the radical factions
 of the Palestinian movement, notably the Abu Nidal
 Group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
 Palestine (PFLP), the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-
 GC), the Fatah dissidents, Saiqa, the Popular
 Struggle Front (PSF), and the Palestine Liberation
 Front (PLF). Evidence acquired over the last year
 suggests Libya is again increasing aid to these groups
 and now provides logistic support to terrorist
 the PFLP appear to be searching for alternative or
 supplementary backing to that provided by Syria,
 their longtime patron. They may feel that Damascus
 has become heavyhanded in its support and tries to
 exert undue control over them, or that Syria now
 views the Palestinian cause as less important than its
 own goals in Lebanon. They may also hope to gain use      25X1
 of Libyan diplomatic facilities to help stage their
 attacks.
 Financial Support
 Libya is more willing-or perhaps able-than Syria
 to provide funds to radical Palestinian groups.
 operations.
 Qadhafi probably would see great profit in linking his
 regime more directly to these militants and their
 activities. They share common enemies-Israel and
 its supporters and moderate Arab and Palestinian
 leaders-as well as a ruthless approach to pursuing
 their struggle. These groups are rich in manpower and
 have extensive operational networks in Western
 Europe. Their successful attacks on two continents
 have garnered tremendous international attention. By
 joining forces with them operationally, Qadhafi could
 probably trade increased financial and logistic support
 for a role in their target selection, and use of their
 personnel and West European support apparatus for

 for more active cooperation with Libya and, in at least
 one case, have in fact proposed joint planning for
 terrorist operations. Groups such as Abu Nidal and

 countries as possible bases for their operations. At
 least two of these radical groups give signs of moving
 their operations to Libya, which also may make
 corollary benefits apart from safehaven-such as
 passports and similar documentation-available to
 them. Abu Nidal reportedly is living in Tripoli and
 has moved part of his organization there, although he
 still maintains offices in Syria. George Habbash,
 leader of the PFLP, reportedly also has moved to
 Libya, leaving only three members of his Political
 Bureau in Damascus.
 Military Aid and Training
 Libya has given military training to Palestinian
 groups off and on for more than 15 years. Current
 training of Palestinians now occurs both inside and
 outside Libya. It is also well established that Libya
 provides weapons to several Palestinian groups.
 Intelligence and Terrorist Cooperation
 Most alarming is the increasing Libyan-Palestinian
 cooperation in intelligence gathering and terrorist
 operations. The Palestinian groups that now appear to
 have such operational ties to Qadhafi are Abu Nidal,
 the PFLP-GC, and the Fatah dissidents.
 all of these parties favor
 cooperation in terrorist activity, and there is some
 evidence indicating that such cooperation is emerging.
 several instances of joint
 planning for terrorism, initiated by both Libya and
 the Palestinians:
 ? An unspecified joint operation in Tunisia reportedly
 was being planned in early December by Libyans
 and members of Abu Nidal

 kill Libyan dissidents at a training camp in
 Lebanon. We do not know, however, if any attacks

 ? Early in 1985, a high-ranking member of the Abu

 demand the release of those prisoners in exchange
 for Britons they claimed to have recently kidnaped.
 Abu Nidal commonly threatens to attack countries
 holding its members unless their colleagues are
 There is also a body of more circumstantial evidence
 indicating Libyan involvement in specific terrorist
 events conducted by radical Palestinians. For
 example, Libya clandestinely disseminated copies of
 the communique issued in the name of the hijackers of
 Egyptair Flight 648 in November 1985. Although
 Libya may not have been involved in the actual
 hijacking, at a minimum Tripoli tried to exploit the
 incident. In addition, Libya provided passports

 Outlook
 Right now, Tripoli and the Palestinians are probably
 assessing each other's capabilities and intentions
 carefully, with an eye to determining whether even
 closer ties are warranted. Nonetheless, greater
 cooperation may have some limits. Each of the
 Palestinian groups, particularly Abu Nidal, has its
 own agenda and values its autonomy. Consequently,
 we expect none of these groups would be willing to
 become totally dependent on Libyan support.
 Moreover, in many respects, Syria is a natural ally
 and should continue to play a key role. Nevertheless,
 to the extent that links between Libya and the
 Palestinian radicals increase-a process that now
 appears to be under way-the range and effectiveness
 of each partner's terrorist operations will also
 increase.

 Spain: The Threat From
 Middle Eastern Terrorists
 Since 1984 Middle Eastern terrorist activity in Spain
 has been growing. While the indigenous terrorist
 threat posed by the Basque Fatherland and Liberty
 organization (ETA) will remain a challenge for
 Spanish security officials in the near term, we expect
 that violence emanating from the Middle East will
 pose an increasing threat to US interests there.
 Middle Eastern - Origin
 Terrorist Incidents in
 Western Europe, 1981-85
 Changing Pattern
 Most Middle Eastern terrorist activity in Western
 Europe has been directed against other Middle
 Eastern targets, and Spain was no exception. Not only
 is the tempo of this violence increasing but also its
 targets now include some non-Middle Easterners as
 well:
 ? In February 1985, a Jewish-owned travel agency
 was bombed, injuring five persons. Spanish
 authorities believe the perpetrators were Arabs.'
 ? The bombing of the El Descanso Restaurant near
 Torrejon Air Force Base in April was probably
 committed by a radical Palestinian group. The
 attack left 18 Spaniards dead and 15 Americans
 among the 82 persons injured.
 ? On 1 July, a grenade attack damaged the offices of
 British Airways and TWA in Madrid. A radical
 Shia group, the "Organization of the Oppressed,"
 claimed responsibility for the attack.
 ? Almost simultaneously, a second grenade attack
 occurred at the Madrid offices of Alia, the
 Jordanian national airline. The Revolutionary
 Organization of Socialist Muslims (ROSM) and
 Black September-both believed to be covernames
 for the Abu Nidal Group-claimed credit for this
 attack.
 ' In this incident, as well as a number of others, the culprits remain
 unknown. The choice of targets, however, is strikingly different
 than that characterizing the Basque terrorist groups that have
 plagued Spain for decades.F__1

 ? On 16 October, suspected Middle Eastern terrorists
 launched an arson attack against the Iranian
 Embassy compound, seriously damaging the
 building.
 ? In December, Spanish officials ordered the
 expulsion of three Libyans, including two diplomats,
 suspected of plotting an assassination attack in
 Madrid on Dr. Muhammad Magaryaf, the head of
 a major Libyan opposition group who was scheduled
 to visit Spain.
 Why Spain?
 The growing spillover of violence from the Middle
 East into Spain is part of a general trend affecting
 Western Europe as a whole. Middle Eastern terrorists
 operating in Europe have ready access to an existing
 and extensive support network, can secure greater
 publicity, and, in some cases, can better conceal their
 links to a state sponsor or parent organization. Apart
 from this, however, Spain now provides some special
 advantages as well as incentives:
 ? Historically, Spain has strong cultural ties to the
 Middle East together with a sizable number-an
 estimated 40,000 to 70,000-of resident Arabs and
 Iranians. New faces from the Middle East blend
 easily into this milieu and have little trouble making
 contact with countrymen who share their religious
 and political orientations
 ? The US presence in Spain is large and high profile.
 the El Descanso
 Restaurant was selected as a target primarily
 because large numbers of US military personnel
 frequented it.
 ? Spain's announcement on 17 January that it is
 officially recognizing Israel will make Spanish
 officials and facilities appropriate targets for Arab
 wrath.
 ? Spain currently holds several Arab terrorists in
 prison. Supporters could carry out attacks in an
 effort to secure their comrades' release. The
 bombing of the British Airways and TWA offices in
 July, for example, occurred only a week after two
 Shias were sentenced by a Spanish court to 23 years
 in prison.
 circumstantial
 support to a variety of
 foreign terrorist groups in Spain is not a recent
 phenomenon, and Spanish authorities have been
 maintaining close surveillance of the Libyan People's
 Bureau after finding evidence that Tripoli has been
 financing and assisting the ETA.
 Libya has designated its
 People's Bureau in Madrid as a focal point for
 terrorist planning in Spain and throughout Western
 expelled Libyans all had connections to the Abu Nidal
 Group. The Libyan Office of Special Services, also
 known as the Office of Revolutionary Affairs,
 reportedly also maintains clandestine contacts with
 various foreign groups, including Palestinian terrorist
 groups.

 Recent developments suggest that Iranian-sponsored
 terrorists are also becoming more active in Spain.
 radical
 Shias, in part as a reaction to the tightened security at
 Western facilities in the Middle East, are trying to
 develop an independent operating capability in
 Western Europe. Notably, in 1984, Iranian-sponsored
 terrorists staged at least 10 actual or planned attacks
 in Western Europe, and four of these either occurred
 in Spain or had a Spanish connection:
 ? On 18 May, two Iranian-trained operatives
 traveling to Madrid were arrested at a Rome airport
 while carrying explosives.
 ? On 23 July, four Iranians were arrested in Madrid
 for allegedly plotting to hijack a Saudi airliner.
 ? On 31 July, a Kuwaiti businessman was shot and
 wounded in Spain; an anonymous caller claimed
 Islamic Jihad was responsible.
 ? On 14 September, a Saudi tourist was killed in
 Spain, and an anonymous caller claimed Islamic
 Jihad was responsible.
 Though no Iranian-sponsored attacks occurred in
 Spain in 1985, the Iranian Government continued
 efforts to develop operational capabilities there. In
 October 1985, Tehran opened an unofficial office in
 Barcelona similar to one that Spanish police closed in
 July 1984 after arresting the staff for planning to
 hijack a Saudi airliner and for illegal possession of
 arms and explosives. The new office, like its
 Palestinian groups also pose a strong potential threat
 in Spain.               in late 1984 that Fatah and

 Nidal Group, which rejects any political solution to
 the Arab-Israeli dispute, has accelerated its attacks
 throughout Western Europe without sustaining any
 serious damage to its operational capabilities. The
 group has threatened further attacks against West
 European and US interests, and the imprisonment of
 Abu Nidal members in Spain makes that country a
 likely venue for operations intended to secure their
 release.
 Links to Indigenous Terrorists
 The ETA's primary goal remains Basque
 independence, and its military wing, ETA-M, has
 characteristically targeted Spanish police and military
 personnel-not US personnel or facilities. The group
 has long claimed to be in contact with the principal
 terrorist groups in the world;
 Apart from intermittent financial support, since the
 mid- 1970s,
 TA members have been trained at
 Algeria's National Police Academy, allegedly with
 funds provided by Libya. Some ETA militants
 reportedly have fought with the Western Saharan

 paramilitary training in South Yemen. In 1984, five
 others reportedly received training in Libya. The ETA
 has also received offers of help from the PFLP, but we
 do not know whether concrete aid was forthcoming.
 Despite the government's successes against Basque
 terrorism over the last two years, the ETA could
 decide to enhance its capabilities by forging stronger
 ties to Middle Eastern groups. It remains a
 sophisticated terrorist organization, and closer
 cooperation with groups hostile to US interests would
 appreciably increase the threat to Americans in             25X1

 Outlook
 For Spain, the El Descanso bombing may have
 signaled the end of what had long been considered a
 special Spanish immunity to Middle Eastern
 terrorism. If
 a radical Palestinian terrorist group
 was responsible, the attack could be a harbinger of
 heightened risk to US interests in Spain. The evidence
 is not clear, however, and some observers still suspect
 the indigenous First of October Antifascist Resistance
 Group (GRAPO), long known for its anti-
 Americanism.
 Spain's formal recognition of Israel causes Spanish
 officials to fear that their embassies and diplomats in

 Colombia: Nicaraguan Links
 to Terrorists' Weapons
 Our analysis of weapons used by members of the 19th
 of April Movement (M- 19) during their November
 siege of the Colombian Palace of Justice indicates
 that nearly half of the recovered arms were fully
 automatic military assault rifles-some of which can
 be linked to Nicaragua. Other recovered weapons
 included improvised explosive devices, commercial US
 civilian firearms, and grenades and other ordnance
 captured or stolen from military or police units. F_
 We do not know if Managua supplied the assault
 rifles directly to the M-19, but their discovery
 represents the first confirmed evidence that
 Nicaraguan arms are reaching insurgents in
 Colombia. The presence of military weapons from
 Nicaragua may presage increased M-19 access to a
 variety of ordnance that would enhance the group's
 ability to conduct a broad range of terrorist
 operations.
 On 7 November 1985 Colombian military and police
 units stormed the Palace of Justice in Bogota, which
 had been taken over the previous day by armed
 members of the M-19. Colombian forces killed more
 than 40 insurgents and captured large quantities of
 weapons, ammunition, and other ordnance as they
 retook the Palace in fierce floor-by-floor fighting.
 Although many of the captured weapons were badly
 burned, we were able to examine and identify most of
 the recovered firearms. Some of these weapons were
 commercial firearms of a type previously identified as
 being in the M-19 arsenal. Nearly half of the
 recovered weapons, however, were more powerful
 military assault rifles-some of which could be traced
 to Nicaragua.
 Military Weapons
 M-19 insurgents used a mixture of military and
 civilian weapons during their takeover of the Palace of
 Justice. Out of the 31 captured M- 19 firearms that we
 were able to examine, nearly two-thirds were of
 military origin:
 ? Six US 5.56-mm Colt M-16 assault rifles.
 ? Five Belgian 7.62-mm FAL assault rifles.
 ? Three Israeli 7.62-mm Galil assault rifles.
 Captured assault rifles included US M-16s,
 Belgian FALs, and Israeli Galils (top to bottom).
 ? One West German 7.62-mm G3 assault rifle.
 ? One US .30-caliber Underwood M-1 carbine.
 ? One US .45-caliber M-3 submachinegun.
 ? One Israeli 9-mm Uzi submachinegun.
 ? One "Madson" 9-mm submachinegun of unknown
 (possibly Brazilian) manufacture.
 Of the weapons listed above, we had insufficient
 information to determine where the terrorists
 acquired five types of weapons that are or have been
 used by a variety of Latin and Central American
 police and military forces and could easily have been
 obtained locally by the M-19.
 We were able to make some judgments about the past
 history of the 14 remaining assault rifles-of US,
 Belgian, and Israeli origin. We can definitively link at
 least two of each type of weapon to Nicaragua:           25X1
 ? Traces run on the serial numbers of two of the US
 M-16s indicate that the weapons were sold to the
 government of former Nicaraguan President
 Anastasio Somoza in 1976.

 ? Two of the Belgian FAL assault rifles bear
 Venezuelan national crests and have serial numbers
 corresponding to FALs provided to the Sandinistas
 ? Two of the Israeli Galils bear the partially effaced
 letters "EEBI" along the left side of their receivers.
 This was the property mark stamped onto all
 weapons acquired by the former Nicaraguan
 National Guard Basic Infantry School-Escuela de
 Entrenamiento Basico de Infanteria.
 Other recovered items of military ordnance may also
 be linked to Nicaragua, but we cannot make a
 definitive determination either because of the
 condition of the weapons or because of the
 unavailability of records:
 ? Of the four remaining M-16 assault rifles, one
 appears identical to those traceable to Nicaragua.
 Its serial number has been effaced, however, and
 running traces is impossible. The three remaining
 M-16s all bear US property stamps, indicating that
 they were issued to US military units rather than
 sold to foreign governments. Traces run on their
 serial numbers indicate that one was sent to
 Vietnam in 1968 and the others were sent to
 overseas shipping areas in 1968 and 1972.
 According to the Weapons Registry at Rock Island
 Arsenal, they probably also were shipped to US
 forces in Vietnam. Large quantities of similar

 tional crest and serial number. Weapon was
 provided to the Sandinistas in 1979 by previous
 Vietnam-war-vintage US M-16 assault rifles have
 been captured since the early 1980s in the
 possession of Nicaraguan-backed guerrillas.
 ? Of the three remaining Belgian FALs, two were
 sanitized by having their national crests milled off.
 Similar sanitized FALs-with drilled out, rather
 than milled, crests-have been recovered from
 Nicaraguan-backed rebels in El Salvador. In both
 cases, the obliterated areas correspond in size and
 location to the Cuban national crest, which the
 manufacturer, Fabrique Nationale of Belgium,
 stamped onto FALs produced under Cuban
 contract. Moreover, both of the sanitized FALs
 recovered at the Palace bear hidden date production
 codes that indicate they were made in 1958 and
 1959; that is, at the same time that Fabrique
 Nationale was fulfilling the Cuban contract.
 ? About 100 rounds of 7.62-mm by 51-mm Bloc-
 origin ammunition were discovered. Headstamp
 markings indicate that this ammunition was
 manufactured in 1967 in Factory Number 10 in
 Kazanluk, Bulgaria. Similar Bulgarian
 ammunition-also made in Factory 10 during the
 1960s-was discovered in rebel possession in El
 Salvador in 1984.

 ? Although most of the explosive ordnance appeared
 to have been either homemade or stolen from the
 military, two detonators for Chinese PG-2 high-
 explosive, rocket-propelled grenades were recovered
 in the Palace. Although no RPG-2 launchers or
 PG-2 grenades were found, this is the first time any
 RPG-2-related equipment has been discovered in
 the M-19's possession. As with the Vietnam-war-era
 US M-16s and the Bulgarian ammunition, however,
 large quantities of Chinese RPG-2s have been
 captured from leftist guerrillas in Central America.
 Commercial Firearms
 The remaining third of the captured weapons consists
 almost entirely of civilian firearms, which-with one
 exception  were either manufactured in or imported
 into the United States. These include:
 ? Three US .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolvers.
 ? One US .38-caliber Colt revolver.
 ? One US .45-caliber MAC 10 submachinegun.
 ? One US 16-gauge Winchester shotgun.
 ? One US .30-caliber Universal M-1 carbine.
 ? Two Israeli 9-mm Uzi semiautomatic carbines
 made specifically for export to the United States.
 ? One Spanish 7.65-mm Star pistol.
 ? Two US 5.56-mm Colt AR-15 semiautomatic
 carbines.
 In addition to these arms, other confiscated
 commercial items of US origin included 9 Willson AR
 700 gas masks and 2 Daco Safety Products, Inc.,
 "Chemlite" flashlights that shoot tear gas.
 The presence of large quantities of commercially
 available US firearms and equipment among the
 weapons found at the Palace confirms our previous
 assessment that such small arms are readily available
 to a variety of terrorist insurgent and criminal groups
 in Colombia. An analysis completed earlier this year
 of other weapons recently captured by Colombian
 authorities from drug traffickers, the M-19, and the
 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
 indicated that most of the weapons recovered from
 each group were relatively new, commercially
 available firearms that were either manufactured or
 purchased in the United States.' Typically, these arms     25X1
 are large-caliber, large-magazine-capacity,
 paramilitary-style weapons such as semiautomatic
 Uzi and M-1 carbines and semi- and fully automatic
 MAC 10 submachineguns. Although some evidence
 suggests that US weapons reach Colombia via
 Mexico, we believe that most of the captured US
 firearms were purchased in Florida-probably by
 drug traffickers. Traces run on their serial numbers
 indicated that almost all had been sold by Miami
 gunshops-often to persons of Latin or Central
 American origin. Similar US commercial
 paramilitary weapons have recently begun turning up
 in Jamaica and other Caribbean nations in association
 with the illicit drug trade.F__~                  25X1

 Other Ordnance
 In addition to small arms, Colombian forces recovered
 a wide variety of other ordnance from the Palace of
 Justice. As with past M-19 caches, most of the
 recovered materiel consisted of commercial
 explosives, homemade bomb components, and
 military items probably captured or stolen locally.
 This ordnance included:
 ? Six 1-kilogram packages of commercial explosives.
 ? Ten improvised claymore mines.
 ? 75 commercial blasting caps.
 ? Six homemade electronic timers with antitamper
 devices.
 ? Five small sticks of US and Costa Rican industrial
 explosives.
 ? Two US M-72 light antitank weapon (LAW) launch
 tubes (probably captured from Colombian forces).
 ? Two rifle grenades (one of which was captured from
 Colombian forces).
 ? One unidentified handgrenade (with Spanish
 instructions).
 ? Two unidentified smoke or thermite grenades (with
 no markings).
 ? 3,598 rounds of military 5.56-mm ammunition (of
 Brazilian, Mexican, and-predominantly-US
 manufacture).
 ? 200 rounds of Colombian 7.62-mm by 51-mm
 ammunition.
 ? 99 rounds of Bulgarian 7.62-mm by 51-mm
 ammunition.
 ? 100 rounds of Colombian 9-mm by 19-mm
 ammunition.
 ? 67 rounds of commercial US .45-caliber
 Implications
 Because of the limited number of weapons found in
 the Palace of Justice, any conclusions based on this
 one incident about how the M-19 acquires its weapons
 must be provisional. Specifically, we do not know the
 exact route the M-19 followed to get these firearms.
 Nor do we know whether they acquired them directly
 from Managua or bought them second or third hand
 from gray market dealers in arms transit areas such
 as Panama, where M-19 members regularly purchase
 weapons.
 At a minimum, the surviving weapons help confirm
 earlier indications that the M-19 and other
 Colombian insurgent groups are able to obtain a wide
 variety of commercial US firearms in quantity. The
 apparent availability of such weapons makes it easier
 for groups like the M-19 to resupply their arsenals
 through gray market channels should the availability
 of military weapons be significantly reduced.
 Perhaps more significantly, the recovered weapons
 also provide the first confirmed evidence that small
 arms from Nicaragua are reaching the M-19.
 Although we can definitively link only a small share
 of the captured firearms to Nicaragua, these weapons
 are among the most lethal firearms recovered from
 the Palace. In contrast to the captured US
 commercial weapons, most of which fire handgun
 cartridges, the Nicaraguan arms-as well as the other
 assault rifles that may also be linked to Nicaragua
 are all fully automatic military weapons and shoot
 ammunition.

 more powerful rifle ammunition. Although we do not
 know if Managua supplied these weapons directly to
 the M-19, the fact that at least two of each of three
 different types of assault rifles can be linked to
 Nicaragua suggests that, as a group, these arms did
 not pass through many intermediaries before reaching
 the M-19. If several intermediaries had been involved,
 we would have expected less homogeneity regarding
 the types and origins of the weapons.
 If Managua has begun channeling arms to the M-19,
 we would expect to see the gradual introduction of
 different-but not necessarily more powerful-
 ordnance into the group's arsenals in the near future.
 Specifically, this would probably include quantities of
 older, surplus Bloc equipment like Kalashnikov
 assault rifles, Czechoslovak submachineguns, and
 RPG-2 antitank weapons-all of which Managua has
 provided to leftist rebels in El Salvador and
 Honduras.' Possession of these weapons would not,
 however, result in a qualitative increase in the M-19's
 capabilities, since the group already has access to
 limited quantities of similar Western assault rifles,
 US M-79 grenade launchers, and M-72 LAWs. Large
 infusions of such weapons would, however, greatly
 enhance the group's ability to conduct operations
 similar to the Palace siege and to rearm itself should
 such operations prove equally costly in terms of lost
 materiel.

 In contrast, direct or indirect provision by the
 Sandinistas of military explosives and other ordnance
 to the M-19 could lead to a qualitative increase in the
 group's operational capabilities in the area. If the
 M-19 is receiving arms from Nicaragua, we would
 expect to see Soviet-style handgrenades, explosives,
 and mines turning up in future arms caches instead of
 the large percentage of improvised explosive devices
 that was found in the Palace. Bloc military ordnance
 would be far more destructive than the improvised
 devices, which contain less powerful commercial
 explosives.

 Chronology of Terrorism-1985 and 1986
 Below are described noteworthy foreign and international events involving
 terrorists, or the use of terrorist tactics, which have occurred or come to light
 since our last issue. In some cases, the perpetrators and their motivations may not
 be known. Events and developments that have already been described elsewhere in
 this publication are not included.

 persons were reportedly killed, and the raiders were said to have captured four
 members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
 during the three-hour battle.
 5 December               Israel: Small bomb explodes in Hazikron Garden in Haifa near entrance to
 Interior Ministry. There were no casualties, and no group claimed responsibility.
 8 December               Lebanon: Israeli troops capture members of Democratic Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine in southern security zone. The terrorists reportedly were carrying
 weapons, explosives, and large amounts of food.
 Israel: Two members of Jewish terrorist group pardoned. The men had been
 convicted of planning to blow up the dome of the Rock Mosque, a Muslim shrine
 in East Jerusalem, in 1984.
 9 December               Israel: Two Israeli kidnap victims killed in DFLP shootout with IDF troops in
 northern Israel. A firefight reportedly broke out when terrorists of the Democratic
