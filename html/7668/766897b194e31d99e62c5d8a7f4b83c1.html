 Senator Proxmire.   Now let's get into the Chinese,  if you'd
 like to present your presentation there.
 Mr. Gates.   All right, sir.
 Much of what has happened economically in China over the
 past year-and-a-half reflects the successes and failures of
 Beijing's massive experiment with economic reform.   The
 .experiment, which has been underway since 1978,  has touched
 virtually every sector of the economy.   Under what China calls
 its "contract responsibility system," farmers now have effective
 control, but not ownership, of most of the acreage in China.
 Peasants determine, to a large degree, what and how much they
 produce.
 Enterprises that formerly remitted all but a small share of
 their profits to the state now retain a much larger share.
 Moreover, for the first time in over 20 years,  individual
 entrepreneurs have been allowed to set up small businesses, such
 as restaurants, barber shops,  and clothing stands,  and actually
 to employ small numbers of workers.
 Economic performance in 1983-1984, particularly in
 agriculture, looks quite impressive, statistically.  Agricultural
 output jumped sharply as a result of both the contract
 responsibility system and the better-than-ever weather
 conditions.   Grain output reached a record 387 million tons in
 1983,  and may top 405 million tons this year.   Cotton production
 jumped 25 percent last year, to a record 4-1/2 million tons.  And
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 another rise, perhaps as much as 10 or 15 percent, may be in the
 offing this year.
 The energy sector provided Chinese policymakers with what
 was perhaps their most pleasant economic surprise of 1983-1984,
 as primary energy output rose at about a 6-percent clip, the
 fastest pace in five years.
 Oil production rose to 106 million tons in 1983, enabling
 China to export 15 million tons of crude,  and output should hit a
 new record of 114 million tons by the end of this year.
 Coal output topped 700 million tons last year, and probably
 will reach 760 million this year.
 China's international financial picture also improved
 steadily over the past 18 months.   International reserves now
 stand at more than $20 billion, the tenth largest worldwide, and
 China will run a fourth consecutive large trade surplus in
 1984.   Beijing has borrowed very little over the past two years,
 and much of what it acquired came in the form of government-
 subsidized loans or money from international financial
 institutions at low interest rates.   As a result,  less than 6
 percent of export earnings are required to service China's
 foreign debt.
 The military has been asked to sacrifice somewhat for the
 time being in order to help revive China's economy.   Chinese
 budget statistics show defense outlays as a share of government
 spending falling moderately, from 17-1/2 percent in 1979, during
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 the border war with Vietnam, to 15.3 percent in 1982,  and 13.7
 percent last year.
 Although data for 1984 are still  unavailable, we believe the
 military expenditure figure remained at 13-14 percent of
 government spending.
 The PRC figures probably understate total defense spending,
 but we believe they accurately reflect the recent trends.   The
 military has so far accepted the need for sacrifice, with the
 .understanding that as the economy improves the armed forces will
 be appropriately rewarded.
 The statistics on industrial performance also appear quite
 respectable.   Industrial production rose at an annual rate of
 about 11 percent over the past 18 months.
 Senator Proxmire.   Can I interrupt to ask:   You have just
 read that military expenditures may have slipped below 15 percent
 of government spending by now.
 Mr. Gates.   Yes, sir.
 Senator Proxmire.   Can you give us a percentage of GNP?
 Mr.             We haven't done the same kind of costing things STAT
 that our colleagues covering the Soviet Union have done.   But we
 do have a GNP figure worked out in dollars, and I could sit down
 and crank a rough estimate out for you.   The hesitations that the
 Soviet analysts have in doing this kind of thing are even more
 amplified in our group.

 THE DEFENSE BURDEN
 Beijing claims that it spent 17.7 billion yuan (about $9
 billion) on defense in 1983.   We calculate that China's GNP for
 that year was about $275 billion which yields a defense burden of
 only about 3.3 percent.   CIA's military experts believe that the
 Chinese figure for military spending may understate actual
 expenditure levels by as much as 50 percent.   Assuming this to be
 the case, the actual  defense burden is probably closer to 7
 percent of China's GNP.

 Mr. Gates.   An equally impressive performance has been
 achieved in their production of such consumer items as
 refrigerators, washing machines, fans, and TVs.   Beijing has
 experienced some inflation, but at manageable levels of 5 to 8
 percent.
 In short, we estimate that China's real GNP grew about 8
 percent last year,  and even sharper growth of 9 to 11 percent can
 be expected this year.
 Despite the impressive statistics, Chinese leaders have
 become increasingly dissatisfied with the industrial sector.
 When reforms were first introduced in 1978,  it was not industrial
 growth that the government was interested in.   In fact, Beijing
 said it would willingly sacrifice short-run growth if, through
 reform,  it could make its enterprises more efficient.
 In this area, China has failed.   Its domestic enterprises
 continue to be among the world's most inefficient, using, by some
 estimates, up to 3-1/2 times more energy to produce a unit of
 output than the average less-developed country firm.
 At the same time, energy shortages presently idle 20 percent
 of China's industrial capacity.   Raw material consumption is also
 high, and has shown almost no sign of coming down.
 The state calls for reductions in per-unit consumption of
 raw materials, have been answered instead by increases.   Then,
 too, the quality of China's output remains very low.   And labor

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 and capital productivity have failed to improve under initial
 reform efforts.
 Finally, when China released its grip on the industrial
 decisionmaking process,  it also gave up some of the control  it
 once had over macroeconomic activity.   In the wake of that move,
 China has been forced to accept five consecutive budget deficits
 totalling more than 55 billion yuan, about $25 billion.
 Runaway local  investment drained both capital  and raw
 materials away from high priority infrastructure projects,   and
 mounting price pressures showed up in budding black markets,
 speculative activity,  and rising free market prices.   For a
 while, the problems associated with the early reforms threatened
 to overshadow the agricultural  gains.   In the 1981 to 1983
 period, China's Communist Party strenuously debated the question
 of reform.   The argument revolved around whether to move rapidly
 ahead with new reform measures or to cut back on market-
 orientated practices in favor of tighter controls and more
 reliance on comprehensive state plans.
 Earlier this year,  however, Party advocates of reform moved
 into a predominant position.     As a result, the drive to
 restructure the economy has accelerated.
 At the same time, the emphasis has shifted away from
 agriculture, where the results have been good, to industry, where
 little real progress has been made.   By late June, Chinese
 economists publicly were calling for experiments with such
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 market-oriented practices as.forcing state banks to compete
 against each other, allowing enterprises to issue stock and
 bonds,  and were even advocating reform of the price system.   Such
 proposals would have been labeled heretical five years ago.
 In early October, the state council issued provisional
 regulations on improving the planning system -- a detailed
 document calling for,  among other things,  a major overhaul of
 China's complex planning bureaucracy.   The meeting of the Third
 Plenary Session of the 12 Central Committee on the 20th of
 October firmly committed the Party to economic reform.
 The Plenum approved a document on the reform of economic
 structure that reiterated all the elements of earlier reform
 efforts, and went further than any previous document on important
 questions such as price reform.   In essence, the Party committed
 itself to a comprehensive restructuring of its economic
 apparatus, that,  if fully implemented, will permit free market
 regulation in China to a much greater degree than elsewhere in
 the socialist world, with the possible exception of Hungary.
 Why is the Party now prepared to make such a massive assault
 on its urban economic problems?
 First, the waste and inefficiency that characterized the
 industrial sector has reached intolerable proportions.   Heavy
 industrial sector warehouses now store more than $10 billion in
 unusable machinery, while Chinese factories continue to produce
 mostly 1950 and 1960 vintage equipment.   Chinese mills continue

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 to produce large quantities of low quality steel but most
 industries complain of major shortages.
 Then,, too, the weakness of the urban economy began impacting
 on the agricultural sector.   A huge surplus of grain is presently
 accumulating in the countryside because the urban commercial
 system is incapable of transporting it to points of need.   At the
 same time, consumer goods are not reaching the countryside in
 quantities sufficient to meet rural demands.
 Beijing also chose to move now because it believes it is
 well positioned economically to survive the problems that will
 inevitably arise from the planned overhaul.   Agriculture, foreign
 trade,  and energy are all performing well  above expectations.
 Finally,  and perhaps most importantly, the reform wing of
 the Party is eager to push ahead while the 80-year-old Deng
 Xiaoping is still  active and at the peak of his power.
 Because this accelerated drive at industrial reform is in
 its infancy,  assessing its chance for success is difficult.   We
 can say,    however, that implementation will be very tough.   Major
 economic problems will begin surfacing immediately as price
 adjustments work their way through the system.
 Bureaucratic infighting is bound to increase as power is
 redistributed.   Some Party and state officials can be expected to
 resist the entire program, since they would tend to lose power if
 the reforms succeed.
 Price reform is unquestionably both the most essential  and
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 the most troublesome element of the reforms.   The Chinese economy
 is shortage-driven,  and even rumors of price adjustment can spark
 panic-buying and bank runs.   Many Chinese citizens remember the
 dislocations caused by hyperinflation in the late 1940s.   They
 react rapidly and sometimes irrationally to announcements of
 upward price adjustments.
 Beijing has also had a difficult task in determining what to
 do with the nearly 20 percent of state-run enterprises that are
 now losing money.   Factory close-downs on such a large scale
 would mean unacceptable unemployment problems and industrial
 readjustments.   But to permit continued operation encourages
 inefficiency.
 Financial problems also will continue to plague Beijing.
 While China has many of the fiscal  and monetary tools it needs to
 control the macroeconomy,  it has little practical experience in
 their use.   Given the difficulties that even industrial economies
 have in using these tools effectively, Beijing will probably be
 very tempted at the first sign of major problems to resort to
 what it knows best -- direct control.
 Finally, political opposition will continue to threaten the
 reform program, and it is the most difficult factor to measure.
 The mounting economic problems will provide ammunition to
 Party and state bureaucracies that are already resisting
 change.   Nevertheless, we are cautiously optimistic that Beijing
 gradually will  get a good percentage of the reforms into the
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 pipeline,  and that the new program will  achieve a measure of
 success.
 We are struck, for example, by the straightforward,
 nonideological  approach contained in the Plenum document.
 Chinese leaders are keenly aware of both the economic and
 political obstacles they face.   By allowing five years to get the
 program into place, Beijing is calculating realistically the
 tremendous problems it will face in implementation.
 Beijing's willingness to launch a frontal  assault on
 irrational prices also bodes well for success.   Western and
 Chinese economists alike have long viewed the irrational price
 system as a major stumbling block to urban reform, but until this
 year, Party bureaucrats viewed the potential danger of price
 reform as too high to warrant any major experiment.
 It appears now,  however, that these planners realize that
 piecemeal reforms in the absence of rational prices may be worse
 than no reforms at all.   In addition, by letting individuals set
 up service-related businesses and handle commerical functions,
 Beijing has unleashed forces that could markedly increase the
 speed at which economic transactions take place.   A more smoothly
 functioning economy is a likely outgrowth of such policies.
 On the whole, then, we believe that the industrial reform
 program China has devised is workable and will  accelerate
 economic gains, albeit at a slower pace than occurred following
 the early agricultural reforms.   Some inflation is to be
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 expected, though we do not believe Beijing will experience wildly
 spiraling prices.   For this to occur, the government would have
 to be willing to sustain increases in consumer demand by printing
 money, something this fiscally conservative government is
 unwilling to do.   In fact, we are more concerned that Beijing's
 fear of inflation will cause it to overreact to initial price
 changes by cutting back price reforms.   Such a move could stall
 the entire reform program.
 If China is successful  at getting its reform program into
 place, there are several  important implications for the United
 States.   In our judgment,  implementation of the reforms would
 both broaden and deepen China's ties with the United States and
 the West.
 The emphasis on technological  innovation at the plant level,
 foreign capital  acquisition and increased joint ventures will
 expand investment and trade opportunities for US and Western
 business.
 At the same time,  however, the reforms will  aggravate some
 current problems in US-Chinese relations.     It can be expected
 that Chinese enterprises will continue to push for greater access
 to Western markets,  and pressure on Washington to lower trade
 barriers probably will    increase.
 Similarly, Beijing will probably press harder on technology
 transfer in response both to its needs for economic and military
 modernization and the demands of its own enterprises.   It is also

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 likely that China will reduce its grain imports from the West,  as
 its agricultural production continues to improve.
 Beijing's success with economic reform could also prove to
 be a tempting example for other countries struggling with central
 planning.   Beijing reportedly is already encouraging the North
 Koreans to learn from Chinese reforms and relax their tight
 control over the economy.   As China's program proceeds, other
 countries,  including some LDCs and even a few of the East
 European nations that China patterned its earlier forms after,
 may consider making wider use of market-oriented programs.
 Having said this,  I must conclude, still, on a cautious
 note.   Several factors could derail China's reform program
 completely.   For example, the death of China's 80-year-old leader
 would remove from the scene the most powerful  advocate of
 reform.   Deng's most likely successors are also deeply committed
 to reform, but in his absence, they probably would not be able to
 push the program to the extent he has done.
 Other problems, such as a sharp upsurge in speculation and
 economic crime or several years of bad weather could, over the
 longer term also tip the political scales against reform and lead
 to retreat.
 Senator Proxmire.   I appreciate that.
 Both these presentations have been extremely good.   And as
 Richard Kaufman just mentioned to me, this is the kind of
 corrective for the feeling that there's a lot of Chinese euphoria

 going on, that they're going to be the Adam Smith free enterprise
 economy any day now.   I think the note of caution is very
 welcome.
 In your discussion of improvements and recent successes in
 Chinese agriculture, you say that improved weather and price
 increases have played an important role together with market-
 oriented rural reforms.
 First, weren't the price increases part of the reforms,  and
 secondly, can you assign weights to the roles of reform and
 weather in recent improved performance?
 There is some question about exactly what you
 include under the label of reform.   The people in our shop who
 have examined the agricultural sector most carefully choose to
 distinguish somewhat between price adjustments, which China has
 tried periodically over the past 30 years, and the recent
 structural  changes such as introduction of the contract
 responsibility system.   The latter changes we are calling
 "economic reform."
 Our experts believe that even if the commune system had been
 left in place, and the economic structure had remained basically
 as it was,  increased prices would have elicited an output
 response.   Nevertheless, the freedom that the Chinese have given
 the farmer to make production decisions and to carry out those
 decisions has undoubtedly strenghtened the output response.
 As to how to weight each of these factors in terms of their

 impact on production, there is a great difference of opinion
 between experts both within our office and outside.
 Weatherwise, the Chinese say that 1983 was in many ways the
 worst year they have had in some time.   But,  in terms of grain
 and cotton, they had the best harvest they've ever had.   So
 there's some indication that weather, while it has played a role
 in this,  is not playing as important a role as perhaps some
 people would think.
 Senator Proxmire.   It sounds like it might be playing a
 preverse role.
 In what sense?
 Senator Proxmire.   In other words,  if they had these
 bounteous crops of wheat and cotton, and they had it in spite of
 bad weather,  it sounds as if their reforms are more responsible
 than they would be,  if the weather had been the same.
 I'm not sure that's the case.   If the weather
 had been better, they might have gotten additional gains beyond
 what they achieved.   What I think we can say is that the
 agricultural reforms are proving capable of generating production
 gains even under adverse climatic conditions.
 We can start to say, sure, the weather's always been a
 factor, but the price adjustments, and the introduction of the
 contract responsibility system,  are perhaps the major elements in
 this whole expansion we've seen in ag production.
 Price reforms cannot be discounted.   My feeling is, the

 price reforms have probably been at least as important as the
 contract responsibility system.   The Chinese continue to rejigger
 prices,  and they've seen just tremendous shifts in resources out
 of certain products and into other agricultural. products,  in very
 short order, with changes in prices.
 Senator Proxmire.  One of the most interesting contrasts
 between our country and the Soviet Union,  and I presume, China,
 too, although it would be interesting to get your figures on
 this,  is the enormous proportion of the Russian population that
 is in agriculture compared to this country.
 Now the figures that I had a few years ago were that this
 country,  less that 3 percent of our people were in agriculture,
 that is, were on farms producing, working on farms as their
 principal occupation, whereas,  in Russia,  it's closer to 30
 percent, or was.
 On China,  I don't have any figures at all.
 Could you bring me up-to-date on Russia and also tell me
 what the proportion of the people in China who are involved in
 food production is, that is, who are on farms?
 Perhaps 20 to 25 percent,  I believe, of the
 labor force is now working in agriculture.   It was 30 percent
 back in 1960.
 Senator Proxmire.   So they not only had a better crop year,
 but there's more productive work?
 This is in the Soviet Union.

 Senator Proxmire.   That's right.   We were told by the CIA a
 few years ago that it was 30 percent.     I remember I was so
 startled by the figure,   it remained with me.
 I believe that figure for 30 percent refers back
 to 1965 and the 1970s.    They've made considerable progress in
 reducing the labor force in agriculture through the late '70s,
 they've made less progress since then.
 Senator Proxmire.   So it's about 20 to 25 percent now?
 Of the labor force working in agricultrue.

 this is the highest estimate--of this rural  labor force is
 surplus labor, you could pull them off the farms without hurting
 production.
 Senator Proxmire.   What you're telling me is that you have
 about 80 percent of the people in rural areas, and they've mostly
 engaged in agricultrue.
 Mr              At one time of the year or another.
 Senator Proxmire.   But about 70 percent of that 80 percent,
 or 56 percent of the population, to get a precise calculation,  is
 surplus?

 That's the high figure,  and as I say,  it's a
 very rough figure, but I think it gives you an order of magnitude
 as to the size of the problem and to the potential  if you could
 put those people into productive employment.   The Chinese
 themselves say that by the year 2000 they hope to have this
 figure down to about 30 percent.   Their goal  is to have 30
 percent or less of the labor force engaged in agricultural
 production.
 Senator Proxmire.   A big share of them are going to be
 unemployed.
 That won't take place.   They're basically
 unemployed now, but they continue to receive a salary and are not
 unemployed in the Western sense of the word.   China will not
 permit a large amount of Westen style unemployment.
 Senator Proxmire. Think how many people that is. That's
 between 500 million amd 600 million people.
 Actually the figure is not that large because
 much of the rural population is too young or too old to be
 employed.   Nevertheless there is a tremendous amount of surplus
 labor.   All Beijing has to do is give many of these rural people
 the sign,  ie allow them to go into the city and set up barber
 shops, clothing stands etcetera,  and you immediately get an
 influx.   They're already facing problems this way.   Their system
 is not geared to having people move freely from point A to point
 B.   As a matter of fact,  it's geared to preventing people from

 moving from rural  areas to urban areas.   The government is trying
 to make changes right now that will  allow part of this labor
 force, not to move to Shanghai and Beijing, but to move to small
 towns that they hope will form in the middle of these green
 belts.
 Senator Proxmire.   You mentioned the large and rising budget
 deficits starting in 1977, which forced cutbacks in investment
 and transportation.
 What had been the trends in other areas of capital
 investment and what are the causes of those budget deficits
 That should be '79.   I beg your pardon.
 '79 was their largest deficit.   In '79 and '80      STAT
 they had sizable decifits.   The
 initial reaction to the deficits
 was to cut back government spending.   At the same time they
 counseled their industrial  sector to also cut back investment.
 They achieved the cutbacks in government spending, which came
 mainly out of major infrastructure projects.   But in the private
 sector, what we would have to call the noncontrolled sector,
 there were big increases in investments.
 Basically, there are several reasons for the deficits.
 Probably the most important is that when China adjusted prices,
 they raised procurement prices, meaning the state paid the farmer
 more, but continued to sell the grain to cities for exactly the
 same price that they did before.   Of course this led to a
 tremendous subsidy.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Another factor was the readjustment in policy which shifted
 resources away from heavy industry to light industry.   Heavy
 industry generated a large part of China's tax base,  and when
 production began to slow down,  and even decline, tax revenues
 fell.   They had their expenditures going up at the same time
 their tax revenues were tapering off.
 Senator Proxmire.   You indicated in your longer statement
 that Chinese do not reveal much about their defense spending.
 Is it roughly as difficult to know what they spend,  as it is
 to know what the Soviets spend? If so, doesn't that mean we know
 less about the Chinese military,  in view of the fact that we
 place far less emphasis on gathering and assessing information
 about China's defense?
 Mr. Gates.   I think that based on              earlier
 comments, we do have even greater uncertainties in the realm of
 Chinese defense spending than we do for the Soviet Union.   By the
 same token, again,  I would go back to comments I made earlier.
 Even so, we have a pretty good fix on the actual military ca-
 pabilities of the Chinese,  in terms of the forces that they have,
 the equipment that they have, their military research and
 development, the programs, the new weapons systems that they're
 developing, whether they're submarines or missiles, and so on.
 Senator Proxmire.   How about their strategic capability?
 Mr. Gates.   I would say that our capability there is
 probably the best of all.
 STAT

 Senator Proxmire.   What's that?
 Mr. Gates.   I would say that our ability to accurately
 assess their strategic capabilities is probably the best of any
 aspect of their military.
 Would you like to add anything?
 I think that's accurate.
 As Mr. Gates said, we basically have a good feel for the
 direction, for the kind of sacrifice that the military has so far
 been willing to accept in the name of economic modernization.
 Senator Proxmire.   How does the Chinese strategic capability
 compare with the United States and the Soviet Union?   Factor of
 10?   Factor of 20?  And with France and the United Kingdom?
 I would say we should field that question and
 bring it back.       Our military experts aren't here.   My own feeling
 is that they're just not even in the same ballpark as the U.S. or
 the USSR, especially if you're talking about strategic weapons.
 Senator Proxmire.   I realize that.   I realize they're not in
 the same ballpark as the United States    and the Soviet Union, but
 I just wondered what the discrepancy is.   Is it on the order of,
 as I say,  10? 20?
 Mr. Gates.   You're looking at a country where their
 strategic missiles can be counted in a few 10s.
 Senator Proxmire.   Compared with a few thousands?
 Their ships, we could add, are basically
 coastal ships.   They are not a blue water navy.

 Senator Proxmire.   And their submarine fleet?   Do they have
 nuclear weapons on their submarines?  How about their air
 force? Does that have a nuclear capability?
 Again, we should really bring the military           STAT
 people in to talk to you more closely on that.
 Senator Proxmire.   You're going to give some of that for the
 record?
 Mr. Gates.   We'll respond.
 Senator Proxmire.   Let me just pursue that question I asked
 a little bit earlier, just one more time.   Maybe you can't give
 it to me directly, but it would be very helpful  if you could make
 an approximation.
 In a discussion of the Chinese defense sector, you indicated
 that the burden of defense has been reduced somewhat.   I realize
 that you have no precise estimates of the proportion of GNP that
 goes for defense, but can you say whether it is closer to the US
 figure of 7 percent, or the Russian figure of 13 to 14 percent?
 My gut feel  is that it would be much closer to     STAT
 the U.S. figure, and when I respond,  I will be more accurate.
 Let me say this:   there's been a lot of fat in the Chinese
 military budget that's been cut out without really deleting too
 much of their military capability, as small as  it is.
 For example, they had a tremendous capital construction
 corps.   That was part of their military budget.   When they cut
 that military budget, that corps of people was freed up and sent

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 back to private practice.   China's military capability, however,
 was probably not severely hurt.
 So our military people tell me that while the Chinese
 military has definitely sacrificed, we should not overstate the
 degree to which  is has impacted on military capabilities.
 The military continues to get a lot of technology.   They
 have gotten into the business themselves of exporting military
 weapons, and this has been generating foreign exchange for
 them.
 Senator Proxmire .   The last page of your longer statement,
 you have a table showing selected economic indicators in China.
 You have the growth of the GNP and the gross value of industrial
 output, and so forth.
 Can you tell me what their GNP is?
 Well, we do rough estimations of GNP on an
 annual basis, and have it in the neighborhood of $300 billion.
 Senator Proxmire.   It used to be about the same size as
 Italy's.   Can you give me any countries that are about the same
 GNP as China?
 Not right offhand.   Again,  I can put that in
 for you.

 country,  in GNP.
 I notice you have a 7.0, 5.2, 3.0, 7.4, 9.0, 10.  Those are
 very, very healthy growth figures.
 Again,  I don't think that's necessarily a good
 sign.   The Chinese are not necessarily pleased at that.   As we
 said in the paper.
 Senator Proxmire.   Why?
 Their feeling is that what they really need is
 an improvement in efficiency.   They continue to produce a lot of
 junk, basically,  and the state continues to have a procure that
 stuff at high cost.   Their warehouses are full and yet their

 factories are crying for better machinery, equipment, and steel.
 So what China wanted was growth rates more in the
 neighborhood of four -- well, their plans have been for anywhere
 between 4 and 6 percent growth. That's what they were asking for.
 Senator Proxmire.   Well, that's a good helpful modification.
 Your discussion of the problems of inefficiency and waste in
 the industrial sector suggests recent reports of Chinese economic
 success may be somewhat exaggerated.   Do you agree that a big
 question mark remains as to whether China will overcome its
 economic problems and be able to maintain the pace of economic
 reform?
 That certainly is a key question.   The press is
 overplaying how well the Chinese have done.  The Chinese
 themselves have been very, very pragmatic, for probably the first
 time.
 Senator Proxmire.   Are you talking about our press?
 Our press, the Western press.
 The Chinese themselves have been very, very pragmatic in
 saying:  "We have done well  in agriculture, but in the industrial
 sector, our performance has been bad." They recognize the
 weaknessess.   Party members, for the first time are being told to
 prepare for.problems that will  inevitabley arise when reforms go
 into place.   And to attack new problems not by labeling people as
 capitalists or something else but by trying new reform.
 Senator Proxmire.   I think that's pretty hard to avoid.   We

 have an understandable, and,  I think,  a proper, bias in favor of
 free enterprise.   I am sure all of you would agree with that.
 So when they move toward a little freedom, we say,  "See how
 well they're doing?" and we would like to feed on that as
 evidence of how superior our system is.
 It is superior. But, I think we tend to overstate it.
 We should probably also say that in terms of
 the free enterprise, we feel that probably about 2 percent of the
 Chinese labor force, urban labor force, right now is engaged in
 these kind of what you could really call free-enterprise--type of
 activities:   small shops, etcetera.   So, the sector of the
 economy that is uncontrolled is still quite small.
 Senator Proxmire.   You explained that very well.   You point
 out that the improvements have been by giving incentives to
 cooperative entities which are not free, competitive
 operations.   And then a price modification, rather than the fact
 that you have as you say,   a lot of people getting into barber
 shops and that kind of thing, which is fine, but it can't account
 for the improvement.
 An example of the problems that remain in the background,
 some panic buying, you report, occurred last month in the -- and
 the fact that you conclude that panic buying would be
 inflationary in the short run.
 Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of these problems,
 whether panic buying has stopped,  and inflation?.And I would also

 like to discuss the problem of unemployment.
 The feeling we have is that there were pockets       STAT
 of panic buying and bank runs but the Chinese were quick to stamp
 these out.   They simply refused to let people pull their money
 out of banks, they also came out strongly with proclamations that
 no one would be allowed to change prices for a while, and when
 changes were made they would be gradually with incomes being
 adjusted at the same time.
 So I think so far the scale of this sort of thing has been
 very, very small.   We highlight it because the potential for
 major problems is there,  and every time the Chinese talk about
 price reform they raise the spector of bank runs and panic
 buying.
 The Chinese are so sensitive to this that they react quickly
 whenever problems occur.   We are more concerned that they will
 overreact to this sort of thing than we are that they will  let
 price problems get out of hand.
 Senator Proxmire.   You warned us about the effect of Deng's
 death.   You also indicated that his successors shared his view of
 the reforms, or his most immediate successors.   But they wouldn't
 have the same force and power that he has.
 Can you give us a little more specific assessment of the
 prospects for the reform movement to prevail  in the event of
 Deng's death or removal from office in the near future?
 You know,  it's speculation, but I will  give you      STAT

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 my best feel for what could happen.
 The two people next to Deng in power are Zhao Ziyang and Hu
 Yaobang.   Both of them are very openly pro-reform.   Even the
 people in the top echelons of the Party who are not strong
 advocates of reform -- and we do have indications that some
 important leaders are not fully on board -- are not Maoists.
 They are not going to argue for a retreat all the way to the
 left.   There are people who would argue that free enterprise
 should not be allowed to operate to the degree that reformers are
 now advocating.   These opponents argue for a pull back.   They
 contend that free enterprise should operate only at the very
 fringes, and a tight central plan should regulate the bulk of the
 economy.
 So, whereas during the 1960's and early 1970's we had
 extremes--Maoists who argued for strict Chinese Marxism opposed
 to a few others like Deng who were at the other extreme--now the
 band has narrowed significantly.
 Even the people who advocate a retreat from reform are
 really talking about a retreat to a milder kind of reform.
 Although this group does not wield much power right now,  if the
 reforms begin to bog down,  I think these leaders would resurface,
 and there's definitely the capability among those people to slow
 the reform process.
 Having said that, the ag reforms have been widely accepted
 by about 80 percent of the population, and it will be very, very
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
 hard to turn those people around.
 So my best guess would be that any new leadership would not
 be able to undermine the program to a major degree; that,  in
 fact, even when we do get succession, we will continue to have
 reform.
 Again, that's just my guess.
 Senator Proxmire.   Mr. Gates, would you briefly discuss the
 recent developments in Chinese-Soviet relations and the prospects
 for closer ties between them?
 Mr. Gates.   There were some developments about a year-and-a-
 half or two years ago that suggested that the two parties, for
 reasons of their own, probably related to the relationship of
 each to the United States, was interested in moving closer to one
 another to establish a closer bilateral relationship.
 .There were a number. of very small steps that were taken, and
 we anticipated, or at least raised the prospect, that might
 involve some longer term, significant improvement in relations.
 Frankly, this just hasn't happened.   There has been a slight
 warming in state-to-state relations.   There have been some
 contacts between the two parties, some negotiations.   Trade
 between the two is increasing rapidly, but from a very small
 base.
 They are still planning on having a Soviet Deputy Prime
 Minister, or Premier, if you will, visit China, a visit that was
 cancelled earlier.
 But on the whole,  it appears that the Soviets.are totally

 unprepared to meeting the Chinese preconditions for a
 significantly improved relationship: getting out of Afghanistan,
 ending their support to the Vietnamese,  and getting the
 Vietnamese out of Kampuchea,  getting out of Mongolia, and so
 on.   There's just no sign that the Soviets are prepared to
 undertake any of those things, and absent that, any improvement
 in relations, even'on a state-to-state basis, will be,  in our
 view, quite limited.

 In the interests of getting information to the public as
 soon as possible, I would like you to sanitize the written papers
 you gave us, so they can be released,  hopefully in the next two
 weeks or so.
 The entire transcript will eventually be printed in
 sanitized form, after we have heard from the Defense Intelligence
 Agency.
 Again,  I want to thank you and your staff for the fine work
 you're doing, and your appearance today.   Thank you very much.
 (Whereupon, at 12:25 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.)
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/11/20: CIA-RDP87MOl 152R000400520010-5
