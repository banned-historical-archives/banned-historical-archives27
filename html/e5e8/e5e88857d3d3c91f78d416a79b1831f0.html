 VIETNAM
 South Vietnam's Buddhists for the moment are steering
 clear of the potentially explosive issue of Premier
 Ky's continuation in office, although they are implying
 that some change in the regime should occur after the
 September elections.  Despite recent indications of
 Viet Cong attempts to penetrate the "struggle" move-
 ment, the Buddhists seem to be retaining control.  This
 week's military activity was highlighted by an allied
 search-and-destroy operation in northeastern Binh Dinh
 and continuation of Operation BIRMINGHAM northwest of
 Saigon.  As infiltration from the North continues at a
 very high rate, North Vietnamese Army strength in the
 South seems to be approaching 40,000.

 Premier Ky's remarks to
 newsmen last weekend,on his con-
 tinuing in office after a con-
 stituent assembly is elected in
 September caused a flurry of pub-
 lic excitement,  but have pro-
 voked no significant Buddhist
 reaction thus far.   Ky's state-
 ments brought into the open two
 major points at issue with the
 Buddhists:   the authority of a
 constitutional assembly--now lim-
 ited by decree to drafting a con-
 stitution--and the nature of the
 provisional government pending
 implementation of the constitu-
 tion.   So far,  the Buddhists
 have been content to avoid a
 showdown on these issues.
 Buddhist leaders are gen-
 erally continuing their efforts
 to exert a calming influence in
 I Corps, where small-scale in-
 cidents of violence between var-
 ious political factions are oc-
 curring.   However,  they are also
 attempting to maintain and,  if
 possible, to increase their in-
 fluence among local officials.
 Two prominent Buddhist Institute
 officials made public speaking
 tours through I and II Corps in  25X1
 recent days. They also met with
 military and civilian officials
 along the way.
 In Saigon,  the council
 formed to draft an election law
 opened with a barrage of crit-
 icism over government failure to
 spell out clearly the respon-
 sibility of the council.   A
 subsequent government decree,
 although avoiding the question
 of whether the council's draft
 Law would be binding on the Ky
 regime,  apparently satisfied
 the council.   It is scheduled
 to complete a draft of election
 regulations by the end of the
 month, which would allow the
 government a 100-day period in
 which to prepare for the voting

 Nwo,          k)-b GR   1 '      inw,
 unrest since March indicates
 that the Viet Cong unquestion-
 ably have been attempting to
 penetrate and exploit the "strug-
 gle" movement.   It is difficult,
 however,  to fix the degree of
 Communist influence in the move-
 ment.
 there are strong indications of
 high-level Viet Cong penetration
 of the "struggle" leadership in
 Da Nang,  including the presence
 of two probable Communists on
 the movement's executive commit-
 tee.   There is also evidence of
 Viet Cong penetration of the
 "struggle" group in Nha Trang,
 and of Communist involvement in
 some of the Saigon demonstra-
 tions last month.   Despite Viet
 Cong influence,  the Buddhists
 still appear to have control of
 the struggle movement.
 The Military Situation
 In South Vietnam
 Military activity this week
 was highlighted by an allied
 search-and-destroy operation in
 northeastern Binh Dinh Province,
 a major enemy stronghold which
 has been the scene of previous
 large-scale operations.   The
 heaviest fighting occurred dur-
 ing a 12-hour period on 6 May,
 when US First Cavalry Division
 and South Vietnamese troops en-
 gaged a battalion of the North
 Vietnamese 22nd Regiment.  Scat-
 tered clashes thereafter also
 contributed to enemy losses,
 which by the end of the week
 had risen to 349 killed and 59
 captured.
 Operation BIRMINGHAM,  a ma-
 jor sweep operation in the Viet
 Cong War Zone "C" stronghold
 northwest of Saigon,  also con-
 tinued this week.   Adverse
 weather,  however,  forced the
 cancellation of a planned as-
 sault against the top enemy com- 25X1
 mand headquarters in South Viet-
 nam.located within the war zone.
 Elsewhere,  the intensity
 of military action decreased
 markedly.   The number of Viet
 Cong attacks dropped off dras-
 tically,  and none was large in
 scale.   South Vietnamese casual-
 ties during the same period were
 the lowest since the Tet holi-
 day week of 1964, and some 200
 less than those sustained by
 the US.    The US Embassy attrib-
 utes some of the slack to the
 unsettled political conditions.
 US military officials in
 Saigon have estimated that the
 major thrust of Communist mili-
 tary activity during the com-
 ing monsoon season will again
 center in the central highlands
 area of II Corps,  where there
 is some evidence of a newly in-
 filtrated North Vietnamese di-
 vision.   The Viet Cong may also
 attempt to exploit the polit-
 ical instability in I Corps,
 conduct sporadic attacks in III
 Corps to maintain pressure on
 ;Saigon,  and consolidate their
 base areas and transportation
 routes in IV Corps.

 as well as continuing reports
 from prisoners and returnees,  in-
 dicate that infiltration from
 North to South Vietnam is con-
 tinuing at a very high rate.   To-
 tal confirmed North Vietnamese
 strength in the South is up to
 some 26,000,  with 5,500 more
 carried -in probable or possible
 categories.   In addition, a num-
 ber of other units of the North
 Vietnamese Army  (PAVN)--possi-
 bly including the major elements
 of the 304th and 308th Divi-
 sions--have been reported by
 prisoners and in captured docu-
 ments as present in the South.
 If these reported units are con-

 South could rise to well over
 40,000 troops.

 NOW         34!; UHI~l ,
 The increasing intensity of
 the fighting in South Vietnam is
 putting a severe strain on Prince
 Sihanouk's principal short-term
 policy objective--to keep the
 Vietnam war from spreading to
 Cambodia.
 To do this,  Sihanouk has
 been playing up Cambodia's inter-
 national posture as a "neutral"
 through the years.    At the same
 time,  acting on the assumption
 that the Communists would win in
 South Vietnam,  he has moved to-
 ward a political accommodation
 with Hanoi and the Viet Cong. His
 continuing problem has been to
 improve relations with the Com-
 munists without provoking retal-
 iation from South Vietnamese and
 US forces.
 Sihanouk has been able to
 play this difficult game prin-
 cipally because Communist use of
 Cambodian territory has been
 relatively limited.    Now,  how-
 ever,  for a variety of reasons,
 many of which are related to the
 expanded US military effort in
 South Vietnam,  the Communists
 are making greater use of Cam-
 bodia.     In addition,  a recently
 captured Viet Cong document re-
 veals that the Communists are
 preparing to establish more ex-
 tensive rest and recovery areas
 in Cambodia territory during the
 coming months.    The Vietnamese
 Communists for the first time
 are buying substantial amounts
 of rice and other foodstuffs in
 Cambodia.   Much of this is being
 moved from northern Cambodia
 into Laos via a new road--the
 so-called "Sihanouk road"--built
 by the Communists apparently for
 that. purpose.
 Sihanouk is aware of the
 Communists'  increasing demands
 on Cambodia,  but probably not
 of the magnitude or details of
 their use of Cambodian territory.
 He has referred to this issue in
 several speeches over the past
 several months,   usually in the
 context of the problems it poses
 for Cambodia.    His ability to
 do anything about it, without a
 major realignment of Cambodia's
 foreign policy,  is severely lim-
 ited,  however.
 It seems clear that at
 :Least for the immediate future,
 Sihanouk will continue to maneu-
 ver for diplomatic leverage to
 avert what he regards as a real
 threat of US and South Vietnam-
 ese retaliation.    He has there-
 fore made a concerted effort to
 win sympathy in the free world
 by improving relations with Aus-
 tralia and Great Britain.    He
 has also demonstrated a contin-
 uing interest in expanding the
 capability of the International
 Control Commission  (ICC)  to in-
 vestigate charges of Vietnamese
 Communist presence in Cambodia
 in an effort to reassert Cambo-
 dia's good faith and neutrality.

 At  the same  time, Sihanouk
 is  again  trying to get Hanoi and
 the Viet Cong to state their re-
 spect for Cambodia's neutrality
 and to recognize    Cambodia's ver-
 sion of its borders with South
 Vietnam.   lie views such assur-
 ances as a hedge against a fu-

 Vietnam and possibly as estab-

 Circumstances surrounding          lished an abject confession of
 the resurfacing of Chinese Commu-   I error the next day.
 nist party chairman Mao Tse-tung
 do not dispel all the questions
 concerning his health.   They also
 leave unanswered questions as to
 how much leadership he has exer-
 cised since he dropped completely
 out of sight six months ago,
 probably because of a serious
 illness.
 So far he has been produced
 only for the visiting Albanians,
 who can be trusted not to reveal
 anything; about the meeting.   No
 announcement has been made on
 when or where it took place,   or
 any other details.   Peking clearly
 felt it essential that Mao show
 up for the Albanians,  but will
 have to do more to counter foreign
 speculation that Mao is no longer
 a significant factor in the situa-
 tion.
 Mao's reappearance occurred
 shortly after a party journal as-
 serted that the party is engaged
 in a "life and death struggle"
 with antiparty elements working
 "in tune" with revisionists and
 "in coordination" with right op-
 portunist elements within the
 party.   This statement was fol-
 lowed by a highly unusual attack
 by one party paper against
 another.   On 8 May,  the Libera-
 tion Army Daily,  officia7 -organ
 of  the army 's political depart-
 ment,  charged that Peking Daily,
 official organ of the city party

 up for a guilty group of anti-
 party people.                            Peking Daily pub-
 The current attacks grew
 out of Peking's long-standing war
 on intellectuals.   The only "anti-
 party elements" named so far have
 been writers and minor party of-
 ficials,  but the intensity of the
 attacks suggests that more impor-
 tant political figures may ulti-
 mately be implicated.   Whether or
 not this occurs,  it appears that
 groups in the party have been
 chafing against current policy
 lines.
 The party appears to be

 inveighed against professional
 military men who question Mao's
 doctrine of the importance of
 "men over weapons" and the need
 for party domination.   In April
 1966 Pekin- began publicly air-
 ing charges which could only ap-
 ply to Peng Te-huai,  who was
 quietly dismissed as defense min-
 ister in 1959.   Peng was not men-
 tioned by name but  the allusions
 to him were  unmistakable.   It has
 long been known from captured
 military documents that Peng,
 symbol of professional military
 men who question the extent of
 party control,  was dismissed on
 charges of "right opportunist,
 antiparty" activities.   The be-
 lated airing of these charges,
 and other references  to the 199
 meeting which dealt with Peng,
 suggest a new drive against  mili-
 tary men who share Pang's ideas.
 Also in April  the regime re-
 newed demands for greater politi-
 cal commitment  from scientists
 technicians.
 and
 The sharpening of  ideologi-
 cal attacks simultaneously
 against  intellectuals,   party
 cadres,   military men,  and tech-
 nicians strongly suggests  that
 an intraparty struggle may be
 developing.   It  is still far
 from clear who is implicated,
 or what role Mao himself may be
 playing in the struggle.
 INDONESIA SEEKING RETURN TO NONALIGNMENT
 Indonesia continues  its ef-
 forts to recast foreign policy.
 Its basic  rationale       in doing so
 is  largely economic--the need to
 reschedule payments on its  large
 foreign debt and to acquire new
 assistance from any source.   In
 the process,  however,  it  is tak-
 ing steps  to normalize relations
 with the West and Western-or-
 iented countries so it can re-
 sume a genuine nonalignment.
 In a wide-ranging policy
 speech to parliament on 5 May,
 Foreign Minister Adam Malik tried
 to accommodate his new approaches
 to Sukarno's residual  influence
 and to other elements of domestic
 political opinion.   Malik stated
 that  Indonesia would pursue
 friendly relations,  especially
 in the economic field,  with West-
 ern Europe and the United States;
 that it sought  to "enlighten"
 Eastern Europeans on the nature
 of political events in Indonesia;
 that it hoped for "changes in
 the UN" so that  Indonesia might
 consider participation.

 Indonesia hopes to
 be back in the UN for the next
 General Assembly in September.
 Malik said he will go ahead
 with recognition of Singapore,
 first resuming trade and then
 establishing diplomatic relations.
 He said confrontation with Ma-
 laysia is based on opposition to
 British bases and the desire to
 see true self-determination for
 Sabah and Sarawak--the two Malay-
 sian states located in Borneo and
 bordering Indonesia.   He blamed
 Communist China for the deteri-

 in Indonesia.   He supported the
 Vietnamese people's struggle to
 oppose US military intervention
 in Vietnam.

 will seek to reschedule debt pay-
 ments,refinance short-term and
 commercial obligations, and ob-

 the repayment of some $1 billion
 of Indonesia's total debt of al-

 RUMANIA SEEKS TO MAINTAIN MANEUVERABILITY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 Rumania's recent flurry of     I   high-level Rumanian party-state
 high-level bilateral diplomatic
 contacts strongly suggests that
 it is seeking to maintain its
 freedom of maneuver with respect
 to both the Communist and non-
 Communist worlds.   The regime
 apparently fears that its abil-
 ity to pursue its self-serving
 nationalist policy is in some
 jeopardy.
 Rumania's uncommitted posi-
 tion between Peking and Moscow
 is dramatized by the presence
 this week in Bucharest of Leonid
 Brezhnev and the expected ar-
 rival of Chou En-lai early next
 week.   Chou,  who will also visit
 Albania,  is expected to do what
 he can to keep the Rumanians
 firm in their independent course
 in Eastern Europe and to bend
 them toward Peking's position in
 the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 His trip probably accounts
 for Brezhnev's unannounced ar-
 rival in Bucharest on 10 May
 for a three-day private visit.
 The Soviet party leader, who is
 accompanied by a specialist on
 relations with ruling Asian Com-
 munist parties, will probably
 remind the Rumanians that their
 room for maneuver between Moscow
 and Peking is narrowing--in
 view of Peking's extremism and
 relative isolation.
 Brezhnev also will undoubt-
 edly raise questions about the
 visit to Hanoi and Peking by a
 delegation.   The Hanoi trip ap-
 pears to be another effort by
 the Rumanians to play a larger
 role in international affairs.
 the
 length of the visit,  from 5 to
 11 May,  and the subsequent stop-
 over in Peking appear at least
 in part designed to give the im-
 pression that Rumania is engaged
 in substantive discussions con-
 cerning the war in Vietnam.
 If the Rumanians are once
 again seeking to ameliorate the
 Sino-Soviet conflict as they did
 in March 1964,  it seems unlikely
 that much will be achieved.   An
 exceptionally harsh attack on
 Moscow by Chinese Communist
 Party General Secretary Teng
 Hsiao-ping on 6 May makes it
 clear that the Chinese are still
 rock-hard in their quarrel with
 the Soviets.   Teng declared that
 the Chinese would under no
 circumstances take united action
 with the "leading revisionist
 group"--which         he called "far
 flabbier" and weaker than
 Khrushchev.

 During the recent visit of
 French Foreign Minister Couve de
 Murville to Bucharest,  the Rumani-
 ans frequently reiterated their
 desire for expanded relations with
 both East and West.   In terms of
 Rumania's relations with the Soviet
 bloc,  Couve's visit assumes some
 importance because of Bucharest's
 apparent interest in French poli-
 cies toward NATO.   The Rumanians
 reportedly are interested in find-
 ing some way to reduce their ties
 with the Warsaw Pact.   Although no
 precipitate action toward the Pact
 by the Rumanians is expected at
 the upcoming July meeting of the
 Pact's Political Consultative
 Committee in Bucharest,  the regime
 has evidenced dissatisfaction for
 several years with the Pact's
 impingement on Rumania's sover-
 eignty.
 This is reflected in the
 highly nationalistic speech on 7 May,
 opening the week-long celebrations
 of the 45th anniversary of the Ru-
 manian Communist Party,  by party
 chief Ceausescu in which he again
 called for dissolution of all mili-
 tary blocs, characterizing them as
 anachronistic.   Ceausescu also re-
 newed criticisms of the Soviet par-
 ty for interference in Rumanian
 party affairs,  in this case through
 such organizations as the Comin-
 tern and the Cominform.   He posed
 a new rationale for Rumania's brand
 of Communism when he stated that
 national and international Commu-
 nism do not exist,  because every25X1
 nation building socialism is ful-
 filling a national and interna-
 tional task.
 The USSR has turned down a US
 suggestion for bilateral exchanges
 of observers at military exercises.
 The US military attache in Moscow
 was informed on 27 April  that Marshal
 Grechko,  who had informally broached
 such an exchange last fall,  "does
 not consider it desirable or possi-
 ble" to discuss the question at this
 time because of the "worsening situ-
 ation in Vietnam."
 to reach formal agreement with the
 Soviet Union on questions of some-
 what secondary importance.   Despite
 this unwillingness to conclude such
 agreements,  which could be exploited
 by the Chinese as evidence of US-
 Soviet "collusion," Moscow is anx-
 ious to maintain movement in those
 =relatively unpublicized areas which
 traditionally carry an aura of coop-
 eration and harmony with the US.
 The Soviets,  however,  tempered
 their rejection by pointing out that
 they "do not plan" any big exercise
 at this time,  and that if they hold
 an exercise later this year,  they
 may invite a US observer,     providing
 the "political situation" warrants.
 Moscow's action is apparently
 intended to demonstrate that the
 Vietnam question will continue to
 have an adverse affect on US efforts
 For example,  Soviet represen-
 tatives recently renewed the cul-
 tural exchange agreement with the
 'US in record time.   In addition,
 prior to his return to duty to
 Washington,  Ambassador Dobrynin
 stressed to Ambassador Kohler the
 need for formal conclusion of con-
 sular and civil air agreements with
 the US.

 Improvement of discipline
 within the Soviet armed forces
 apparently has become a matter
 of considerable concern to the
 high command in recent months.
 0 SOVIET MILITARY LEADERS ON DISCIPLINE
 (Combat readiness is directly dependent upon the
 state of military discipline. Discipline has always
 played a deciding role in the life of troops in winning
 victory over the enemy.- Communist of the Armed
 Forces, August I%5)
 Ina future war. ..victory wiII go to the side
 which has the higher moral steadfastness, dis-
 cipline, and organization.... The appearance
 of new weapons... raises even higher the role
 of man as the most important factor determin-
 ing the course and outcome of a war.../'-and
 this7is being realized sometimes quite srowly
 arJ not thoroughly enough. - Soviet Patriot,
 19 September 1965
 How distressing it is when mold has penetrated
 into the healthy officers' circle; when we watch
 cases of drunkenness, amoral behavior of indi-
 viduals in daily life.... Unfortunately, up to
 now showiness, sensation-mongering, and bally-
 hoo have not disappeared from the troops and
 fleets.... Red tape and bureaucratic methods
 of leadership ore causing great harm. - Red
 Star , 24 September 1965
 *Assistant Defense Minister Marshal Rotmistrov:
 Being respectful to one's superiors and seniors
 is a requirement for all without exception I I
 stress this because one still meets people who
 forget this extremely important element in our
 disciplinary practice and arbitrarily arrogate
 to themselves some sort of "special" rights
 which allegedly spring from positions they
 hold. - Red Star, 25 November 1965
 I am of the opinion that commanders possess
 enough authority to discharge fully their com-
 mand duties and that there is no need for on
 expansion of their disciplinary rights. It is
 only necessary to use them skillfully and wisely
 ...but the situation in this field is still for from
 satisfactory with us. - Red Star, 27 April 1966
 This  is suggested by a series
 of unusual articles on the subject
 in the military press by Soviet
 military leaders calling for
 "ironlike" discipline.   In addi-
 tion,  the Supreme Soviet Presidium
 has promulgated two decrees dur-
 ing  the past year apparently as
 part of the campaign to improve
 discipline.   One establishes peo-
 ples courts in military construc-
 tion units,  and the other author-
 izes deputy defense ministers to re-
 assign officers  to lower positions
 in addition to reducing their
 rank.   This strengthening of au-
 thority suggests that local com-
 manders have frequently been re-
 luctant  to resolve disciplinary
 problems.   Marshal A. Grechko re-
 cently described this aspect of
 the situation as "still  far from
 satisfactory with us."
 The official slogans for the
 most recent October Revolution
 and May Day celebrations called
 For   the "strengthening of mili-
 tary discipline"--an injunction
 without precedent in the military
 slogans of the last decade.   Other
 press evidence suggests that this
 plea was intended for consumption
 by virtually all types of military
 units,  components,  and schools.
 The commandant of the Frunze Mili-
 tary Academy told the US Army at-
 tachd in Moscow in January that
 in spite of the improved selec-
 tion of students for the prestig-
 ious officer's school,  disciplin-
 ary reasons accounted for the
 bulk of the 25-percent "washout"
 rate per class.

 iyE(;RE,L,
 The reasons for the appar-
 ent low state of discipline are
 not entirely clear.   They may,
 however,  include the prevalent
 belief generated by Khrushchev
 that mass destruction weapons
 have reduced the role of offi-
 cers and men--whose morale con-
 sequently has also been reduced.
 Poor discipline may also be a
 natural consequence of the fact
 that the armed forces increas-
 ingly are composed of personnel
 who have never had combat expe-
 rience and who derive little
 motivation from cold war propa-
 ganda.
 The Soviet Union has con-
 cluded a $320-million deal with
 the Fiat Company of Italy for
 an automobile plant which even-
 tually will produce 2,000 cars
 per day.   This is a further dem-
 onstration of a major shift in
 Soviet economic policy favoring
 the consumer,  although the USSR
 plans to export part of its in-
 creased auto production.
 The arrangement with Fiat
 also provides for assistance in
 modernizing the entire Soviet
 automotive industry.   In addi-
 tion,  Fiat will give advice on
 how to organize service and spare
 parts depots which will be re-
 quired as the number of automo-
 biles in the USSR grows.
 The Fiat agreement  is de-
 signed to aid the USSR in rais-
 ing auto production from about
 200,000 per year toward the 1970
 goal of 700,000 to 800,000 cars.
 Part of the work will be subcon-
 tracted to other firms,  includ-
 ing American companies.   The
 USSR,  in addition to its deal
 with Fiat,  already has approached
 a US company for a rolling mill
 large enough to meet steel re-
 quirements that will expand to
 meet the needs of increased auto
 production.   A French firm re-
 cently agreed to deliver stamp-
 ing equipment sufficient to tri-
 ple the capacity of one Soviet
 automobile plant.   Talks have
 been held with both British and      25X1
 French automobile producers,  and
 a team from Renault will visit
 Moscow later this month.

 After nationwide discussion
 of party theses published last
 December,  a long-delayed plenum
 of  the Bulgarian Communist Party
 central committee has endorsed
 the basic principles of a new
 system of economic planning and
 management.   The new program is
 very similar  to other East
 European reforms.  especially
 that of Czechoslovakia.
 The system is designed  to
 free enterprises  from detailed
 central planning and control and
 to encourage them to try  to make
 profits.   Premier Zhivkov,  in
 his closing plenum speech.   just-
 ified the reform as necessary to
 achieve better coordination be-
 tween  the interests of society
 and those of enterprises and
 workers,  the  fuller application
 of  the principle of financial
 independence of enterprises,
 and an increase in material  in-
 centives for workers.
 The new system,  he claimed,
 will give enterprises operational
 independence,  and give individual
 workers a role in management.
 Projected workers'  production
 committees will allegedly have an
 important role in determining
 production,  quality,  profitabil-
 ity,  income distribution, working
 conditions, and selection of man-
 agers.     The committees'  functions
 are vaguely defined,   but  they
 will clearly not wield as much
 power as the Yugoslav workers'
 councils.
 Above the individual enter-
 prise  level in the economic man-
 agement structure will be eco-
 nomic  "trusts," or amalgamations
 of enterprises within an industry
 --a step intended to provide uni-
 formity in running the economy
 and  directing  scientific  and
 technical research.     Zhivkov
 promised that the economic trusts
 will base their decisions more
 and more on economic criteria
 and not on purely administrative
 considerations as has been the
 case heretofore.
 The  top echelon of economic
 control will continue to be the
 state'   organs and ministries,
 which Zhivkov asserted are essen-
 tial to "planned,  proportional
 development of socialist econ-
 omy."   The planning process is
 to be strengthened (although
 simplified}in order to assure
 that producers'  requirements
 become more of a determinant in
 government decision making.
 This  participation  of  producers
 is a major element of the new
 system.
 As to  the over-all goals
 of increasing workers'  incen-
 tives,                                                                       Zhivkov said that the
 individual's pay is to be based
 both on his productivity and on

 the total value of his enter-
 prise's production.   Salaries
 and wages are eventually to
 come entirely from the enter-
 prise's own earnings.   A guar-
 anteed minimum wage is part of
 the nation's labor code, how-
 ever,  and it is likely to re-
 main so until all unprofitable
 enterprises are either made sol-
 vent or phased out.
 Bulgaria's new system of
 pricing--much like Czechoslo-
 vakia's program--will have three
 categories of prices--fixed,  var-
 iable within a range,  and free.
 Zhivkov's speech,without specify-
 ing when the system would go into
 operation,  promised only that
 "flexible prices" would not mean
 an increase in retail prices.
 The new system will not be
 fully operational until at  least
 the beginning of 1967.   Zhivkov

 The Warsaw regime may be
 temporarily easing its drive
 against Poland's powerful Roman
 Catholic hierarchy in an effort
 to reduce domestic tensions.
 It is clearly resolved,  however,
 to maintain control over all
 aspects of the church-state
 struggle,  especially adverse
 popular reaction.
 Manifest popular support for
 the church,  and the hierarchy's
 continued strong loyalty to its
 primate, Cardinal Wyszynski in
 the face of regime attempts to
 discredit him probably account
 in part for the regime's seem-
 ing spirit of accommodation.
 Moreover,  there is recent evi-
 dence of party concern that its
 antichurch drive may be back-
 firing in terms of popular re-
 sponse.
 The rival church-state
 millennium celebrations have
 thus far been marred only by one
 small antiregime demonstration
 in Krakow.   The state,  neverthe-
 less,  clearly has come off sec-
 ond best in terms of popular ac-

 3 May, moreover,  the episcopate
 renewed its public support for
 Wyszynski.
 Party boss Gomulka, who
 earlier had charged the church
 with attempting to undermine Po-
 land's alliance with the USSR,
 apparently backed out of a sched-
 uled state millennium appearance
 on 3 May.   Other regime leaders
 at state rallies either ignored
 the church-state struggle or,
 for the first time since the
 confrontation began last Decem-
 ber, cautiously called for
 mutual accommodation for the
 sake of national unity.   This
 theme was also touched upon in
 a rare press interview by the
 head of the regime's Religious
 Affairs Office.   He stressed
 the necessity for coexistence and
 unity between Polish Catholics
 and party members, adding that
 while  the regime hopes the country
 will be free of religion in time,
 "it is important not  to go too
 quickly."
 Regime leaders continue,
 nevertheless,  to make clear that
 they seek no compromise on the
 basic foreign policy issues in-
 volved in the church-state con-
 frontation.   Speaking in Wroclaw
 on 8 May,  Foreign Minister Ra-
 packi again deplored the Polish
 episcopate's presumption when
 it addressed a conciliatory
 letter to the German Roman Cath-
 olic hierarchy last November
 "over the head of the state."

 SPAIN AND THE UK TO OPEN G'{BRALTAR NEGOTIATIONS
 Spanish officials have in-

 on the long-standing problem of

 other arrangements,  including
 Spain's contribution to European
 defense.   Foreign Minister Cas-

 discuss the sovereignty of Gi-
 braltar. This pressure was ,%.epped
 up in October 1964 by the impo-
 sition of border controls,  fol-
 lowed by other moves, including
 an appeal to the United Nations
 Special Committee on Colonialism,
 and notes to NATO countries for-
 bidding overflights of Spain by
 military planes going to Gibral-
 tar.   The UK long refused to
 hold talks while the Spanish
 border restrictions continued,
 and indicated that in no case
 would it discuss sovereignty.
 In April,  however,  London agreed
 to hold unconditional talks in
 conformity with the UN General
 Assembly resolution of  last De-
 cember which recommended bilat-
 eral discussions.
 In an attempt to increase
 pressure on London,  the Spanish
 Embassy in Washington officially
 informed the United States last
 week that unless a satisfactory
 solution to the Gibraltar issue
 is reached,  Spain will review its
 commitments to cooperate in de-
 fensive arrangements with coun-
 tries with which Spain does not
 have bilateral defense agree-
 ments--such as the UK,  Benelux,
 Germany,  and Italy.   The Spanish
 spokesman pointed out the neces-
 sity of Spanish overflight per-
 mission to the usefulness of the
 military base at Gibraltar and
 the German base being built in
 Portugal.   He also indicated
 that when the renewal of the
 US defense agreement comes up
 in 1968,  Spain would take into
 consideration the role played
 by Washington in aiding inte-
 gration of Spain into Europe,
 including both the defense of
 Europe and Spanish entry into
 the Common Market.
 British planners probably
 have little hope that Spain will
 settle for anything less on Gi-
 braltar than a transfer of sov-
 ereignty, which the Labor govern-
 ment almost certainly will not
 grant Franco.   They felt,  how-
 ever,  it was necessary to agree
 to talks in order to avoid
 giving the appearance of defy-
 '_Lng the UN resolution.   They
 nay also hope that as long as
 negotiations can be prolonged,
 Spain will be reluctant to im-
 pose further restrictive meas-
 ures  against  Gibraltar.   It is
 uncertain how flexible Spain is
 willing to be, but it appears
 willing to carry out its threats
 against third countries if some
 accommodation is not reached,

 Finland's non-Communist
 parties have been unable to reach
 agreement since the March elec-
 tions on the makeup of a new
 government.   The chairman of the
 Social Democratic Party (SDP),
 Rafael Paasio, who is in charge
 of the talks by virtue of his
 party's newly won legislative
 plurality (see chart),  has can-
 vassed a number of possibilities,
 all without success.   The nego-
 tiators are now grappling with
 the question of Communist par-
 ticipation.
 The Communists,  excluded
 from the government since 1948,
 initially urged formation of a
 "socialist" government which
 would include the SDP and the
 Communist-front SKDL,  but since
 it was immediately apparent that
 the SDP would not accept such a
 solution they have instead lob-
 bied for a coalition including
 President Kekkonen's Center Party
 as   well.      Moscow favors this
 because of the "respectability"
 the Center would lend to an
 otherwise leftist-oriented gov-
 ernment.   Finnish political
 leaders maintain also that this
 would be a politically wise step

 since it would associate the Com-
 munists with the unpopular aus-
 terity and retrenchment measures
 which the new government will
 be compelled to take.
 Neither the SDP nor the
 Center wants to be the first to
 indicate willingness to accept
 the Communists as coalition part-
 ners, so it may require forceful
 intervention by Kekkonen or more
 direct pressure by Moscow to bring
 the two parties to a decision.
 Soviet Premier Kosygin's sched-
 uled visit to Helsinki in mid-
 June gives the problem a certain
 urgency.   In the end, Paasio may
 be compelled to form a minority
 Social Democratic government
 fortified with nonpolitical'
 civil servants in several key posts.
 France's reply to the Ger-
 man note on the stationing of
 French troops in Germany will be
 a brief and cold rejection of
 the proposed German terms.

 The US Embassy in Paris com-
 ments that the proposed French
 note does not appear to be a tac-
 tical maneuver for negotiating
 purposes but looks more like an
 attempt by the French to make the
 Germans take the responsibility
 for the departure of French troops.
 There have been several recent
 signs that the French are plan-
 ning to remove their forces from
 Germany.
 The North Atlantic Council
 representatives of France's 14
 NATO partners are studying the
 problems involved in the French-
 NATO confrontation and are attempt-
 ing to have recommendations ready
 for submission to next month's
 ministerial-level meeting of the
 North Atlantic Council in Brus-
 sels.   The French have agreed to
 permit the ministers of the Four-
 teen to meet first on 6 June, with
 the regular meeting including the
 French to begin the following day.
 Reports should be ready for the
 Fourteen on the military implica-
 tions of the crisis,  the proposed
 reorganization of NATO,  and the
 relocation of NATO units which
 must move from France.
 Some dissension among the
 Fourteen has arisen over the relo-
 cation of the North Atlantic Coun-
 cil, which De Gaulle has said may
 remain in Paris,   The Italians,
 Canadians,  and Danes who have been
 generally advocating a softer po-
 sition toward De Gaulle,  are urg-
 ing strongly that it be left in
 Paris.   They probably will be sup-
 ported in this by the Greeks and
 Portuguese.   Most of the other
 members favor its removal,  but are
 split over whether it should be
 co-located on the continent with
 the Supreme Headquarters of the
 Allied Powers in Europe  (SHAPE)  or
 moved separately to London,
 Dissident Muslim tribesmen
 continue to harass the moderate
 regime of Chad's Christian Presi-
 dent,Francois Tombalbaye.   Govern-
 ment security forces--bolstered
 by French officers and equipment
 --have been able to contain the
 dissidence so far,  but the strug-
 gle places a strain on impoverished
 Chad's resources.   Should economic
 conditions in the disturbed areas
 deteriorate further,  the govern-
 ment could be seriously challenged.
 Since last October,  tribes-
 men in the predominantly Muslim
 northeast have been openly defy-
 ing the government's authority to
 impose taxes and appoint local
 administrators.   Many of these
 tribesmen regard the largely
 Christian,  Negroid-dominated
 government as alien and look
 more to the neighboring Muslim
 Sudan for guidance.   They have
 been receptive to propaganda
 spread by exiled Chadian Muslim
 elements in the Sudan who seek
 to gain support within Chad--
 presumably with the goal of set-
 ting up an independent "Islamic
 Republic."
 Since March the Sudan-based
 rebel bands have shown signs of

 improved organization,  and some
 have been equipped with light
 arms from undisclosed sources.
 The rebels are apparently re-
 cruited from among Chadian
 seasonal workers in the Sudan
 and enter Chad in groups
 Their
 leaders have not been identified,
 but it is likely that at least
 some have been trained in either
 the UAR or in the Sudan itself.
 Recently signed agreements be-
 tween Chad and the Sudan have
 not led to the hoped-for reduc-
 tion in rebel activity.
 In response to the Muslim
 threat from the northeast,  Pres-
 ident Tombalbaye has tightened
 his hold on the government and
 is successfully fostering the
 idea that he is the only "na-
 tional" figure who can unify the
 country.   On 20 April he reshuf-
 fled his cabinet,  establishing
 a more equitable balance between
 Muslims and non-Muslim members.
 Tombalbaye continues to
 rely heavily on France to con-
 trol the dissidence.   French of-
 ficers have been placed in ef-
 fective command of both the army
 and gendarmerie and recently
 took part in army maneuvers in
 the area near Abeche.
 Expected food shortages
 this summer--especially in the
 troubled areas--may aggravate
 difficulties for the government.
 Millet,  the staple item in the
 Chadian diet,  is already in short
 supply,  and it is expected that
 the US will be asked for emer-
 gency food relief.

 Egyptian-backed nationalist
 activities in the Persian Gulf are
 on the rise,  and a dispute between
 the British and a local sheik
 threatens to aggravate tensions
 in the area.
 A recent assassination at-
 tempt on the Sultan of Muscat and
 Oman may have been Egyptian in-
 spired.   Radio Cairo and Radio
 Baghdad described the
 attack in considerable
 detail several days be-
 fore it actually hap-
 pened,  and such "news
 stories" of rebel inci-
 dents have been broad-
 cast in advance in the
 past. The broadcasts
 may serve as a means of
 transmitting instruc-
 tions to rebel groups
 in Dhufar Province,  the
 Sultan's temporary res-
 idence.
 Last month the
 British-officered Tru-
 cial Oman Scouts were
 called in to deal with
 a local leader attempt-
 ing to establish his
 independence from the
 sheikdom  of  Sharjah.,
 The fact that the reb-
 el's   followers were
 equipped with modern
 weapons raises the pos-
 sibility of a tie-up
 with liberation move-
 ments known to exist in
 the British-protected
 Trucial States, which
 includes  Sharjah. These
 dissident elements are
 still too weak to
 threaten the British
 position, but they ap-
 pear to be linked with the Egyp-
 tian-oriented Arab Nationalist
 Movement participating in the cur-
 rent anti-British terrorist cam-
 paigns in Aden and Bahrain.   Dis-
 turbances in the Persian Gulf
 area can be expected to intensify
 as the British transfer their
 joint headquarters from Aden to
 Bahrain and expand their military
 facilities in Sharjah.

 TRUCE WITH NAGA REBELS ENDANGERED IN EASTERN INDIA
 The tenuous cease-fire ob-
 served since late 1964 by se-
 curity forces and rebelling Naga
 tribesmen in eastern India ap-
 pears to be in danger of break-
 ing down.   A recent series of
 railroad bombings--widely at-
 tributed to the Nagas--claimed
 more than 100 lives last month
 and brought angry demands in
 the Indian Parliament for firm
 steps to crush the insurgency.
 The government still favors
 a negotiated settlement.   How-
 ever,                   in talks with Prime Minis-
 ter Gandhi in February and April
 the rebels still refused to con-
 sider anything less than com-
 plete independence for Nagaland.
 A third round of talks tenta-
 tively scheduled for May or June
 will probably be equally fruit-
 less.   Each unproductive  meeting
 has been followed by increased
 pressure both within the ruling
 Congress Party and among the
 non-Communist opposition for
 more forceful government meas-
 ures.
 Prospects for a peaceful
 solution are further clouded by
 indications that the rebels are
 themselves divided over tactics.
 The timing of the railroad ex-
 plosions to coincide with or
 immediately follow negotiations
 in New Delhi suggests that the
 more militant Nagas are trying
 to frustrate the peace efforts
 of their ostensible leaders.
 Even the problem of main-
 taining informal lines of com-
 munication between New Delhi
 and the rebels may prove more
 complex in the aftermath of the
 railway blasts.   The private

 arranged the 1964 cease-fire
 dissolved on 3 May when its
 last remaining member, Assam
 State Chief Minister Chalia,
 announced his resignation. Ob-
 server groups set up to super-
 vise the truce could also col-
 lapse as strains between the
 government and the rebels in-
 tensify.
 Full-scale resumption of
 the 11-year-old revolt would
 probably result in prolonged
 and bitter fighting.   Naga
 strength has been estimated at
 4,000 to 7,000 guerrillas. They
 are reasonably well organized
 An Indian
 Army campaign to put down the
 rebellion decisively could re-
 quire a significantly larger
 force than the 40,000 troops
 committed in the past.   Further-
 more,  the harshly repressive
 measures advocated by some In-
 dian leaders could alienate the
 overwhelming majority of the

 whom have heretofore remained

 A split in Venezuela's Demo-
 cratic Republican Union (URD) has
 deprived the coalition government
 of its majority in Congress -and
 will complicate the legislative
 process.   The US Embassy believes,
 however,  that even with the de-
 crease in the votes the URD can
 contribute in support of its coa-
 lition partner,  the Democratic
 Action  (AD) party,  the administra-
 tion will be able to push  through
 the legislation it considers im-
 portant, at least in the immediate
 future.   Maneuvering for the 1968
 elections--which the split in
 the URD reflects--underlies most
 political activity already and
 will grow more intense as the
 date for elections approaches.
 With a public announcement
 of their action on 3 May,  Alirio
 Ugarte Pelayo,  seven other URD
 deputies,  and three senators
 resigned from the URD after
 Ugarte was suspended from the
 party and charges brought against
 him before a disciplinary tri-
 bunal.   Ugarte,  who was number
 two man in the URD and is a pos-
 sible candidate for the presi-
 dency of Venezuela in 1968, has
 built up a strong following in
 the party and has been working
 toward gaining complete control.
 Differences between Ugarte and
 Jovito Villalba,  leader of the
 URD,  have in the past been
 papered over,  but apparently
 Ugarte has grown so strong that
 Villalba could no longer either
 contain or ignore the threat.
 Ugarte's future course is
 not clear.   He may start a
 party of his own,  form a coali-
 tion with one or more of the op-
 position parties,                                                                         or take his
 bloc into one of the eight other
 parties.   The major parties are
 committed to maintaining politi-
 cal stability,  but how well the
 commitment will stand the
 stresses of partisan politics
 for the next year and a half re-

 The government of President
 Castello Branco is making slow
 progress toward its goal of in-
 stilling a two-party system in
 Brazil.   Since March there have
 been only two legally recognized
 parties--the progovernment Na-
 tional Renewal Alliance  (ARENA)
 and the opposition Brazilian
 Democratic Movement  (MDB).   Nei-
 ther can be considered a cohesive,
 clearly oriented political entity.
 ARENA and the MDB were
 formed following the abolition
 of all previous parties by decree
 in October 1965.   The organic law
 governing new parties contained
 rigid requirements that precluded
 creation of more than two or three.
 Under the law an organization had
 to have at least 120 representa-
 tives in the National Chamber of
 Deputies  (total chamber member-
 ship 409)  in order to qualify for
 recognition by the March deadline.
 According to the most recent count,
 ARENA holds 254 seats in the cham-
 ber and the MDB controls 142.   A
 third party could theoretically
 come into existence before reor-
 ganization of the party system be-
 comes final in 1967 if a suffi-
 cient number of congressmen
 switched allegiance.
 Castello Branco's basic
 motive in restricting the number
 of parties was to eliminate the
 confusion that prevailed under
 the former 13 parties and enable
 the parties to provide more effec-
 tive representation.   He also con-
 sidered the drastic change neces-
 sary in order to develop a base
 of support for the administration
 in congress.   The regime has
 achieved the formation of a
 majority bloc in congress under
 the ARENA label, virtually as-
 suring election of a president
 acceptable to the government when
 congress chooses Castello Branco's
 successor on 3 October.
 ARENA has been formed around
 the former conservative-oriented
 National Democratic Union and
 moderates of the former Social
 Democratic Party.   The MDB has a
 preponderance of former Laborites.
 :[n many respects both parties are
 :Loose, artificial.. groupings whose
 members often tend to divide
 according to their previous affil-
 :Lations.   The difficulties caused
 by the widely disparate views and
 the lack of party discipline in
 each are especially evident at
 the state and local levels, where
 attempts to organize ARENA and
 the MDB have often caused con-
 siderable turmoil.   Many local
 :Leaders have hesitated to join
 either party.
 The law allows for the cre-
 ation of factions or "sub-parties"
 within each party for election
 purposes,  a reflection of the un-
 certainty whether ARENA and the
 MDB will remain intact after the
 presidential and congressional
 elections scheduled for later
 this year.   Whether or not the
 parties survive in their present
 form, Castello Branco has at
 least focused national attention
 on the desirability of creating  25X1
 a political system that is more
 conducive to political stability
 than the old one.

 Juan Bosch and Joaquin Bala-
 guer,                  the two leading contenders
 in the Dominican Republic's 1
 June election,  spent last week
 stating their positions on out-
 standing campaign issues and de-
 veloping their economic proposals.
 The stepped-up tempo of politi-
 cal activity of the previous
 week continued but charges of
 fraud and violence have been
 somewhat toned down.
 Balaguer is continuing to
 stress the central issue of his
 campaign--that under his regime
 people will be able to prosper
 "in the shadow of order."   Bosch
 has tried to undercut this appeal
 by linking Balaguer to the bru-
 tality of the Trujillo era and
 alleging that his opponent would
 enter into military conspiracies
 against a Bosch administration.
 Bosch,  however,  has not endorsed
 Balaguer's pledge to accept the
 election results and cooperate
 with the winner's government.
 Both candidates have spelled
 out relatively moderate economic
 programs.   Bosch,  talking in
 simple terms,  has called for
 strong government action to spur
 investment in basic economic
 projects,  pledged to retain the
 government's large share in in-
 dustry and promised to avoid
 taking private lands for his
 agrarian reform program.   Balaguer
 has called for increased produc-
 tion through promotion of private
 enterprise.   At times his state-
 ments have had demagogic overtones
 as,  for instance,  his promise to
 legalize squatters'  claims to
 plots of land.
 Bosch appears confident of
 victory and seems to be attempt-
 ing to resolve problems that will
 confront his administration.   Ile
 appears to be seriously consider-
 ing not requesting the immediate
 departure of the Inter-American
 Peace Force in order to use its
 continued presence to prevent a
 coup and enable him to make
 changes and reforms in the mili-
 tary.
 Bosch's opponents may have
 finally reached an agreement to
 form a coalition behind Balaguer.
 One of the principal negotiators
 of a stop-Bosch movement said
 that minor presidential candidate
 Rafael Bonnelly has come to terms
 with Balaguer.   Presumably Bon-
 nelly will withdraw in favor of
 Balaguer.
 Firm information on election
 trends and on the relative
 strengths of the parties is not
 available.   Although some observ-
 ers feel the race is close,  al-
 most all credit Bosch with an
 edge in some degree.   The US
 consul in the interior city of
 Santiago,  for example, recently
 reported that Bosch's Dominican
 Revolutionary Party is more
 active and militant and may be
 making inroads into Balaguer's
 strength,  particularly among
 the  peasants.

 Guatemala's Communist Party
 (PGT) has resumed terrorist ac-
 tivity in retaliation for the
 capture and suspected killing of
 Communist leaders by government
 forces in early March.
 On 4 May PGT's action arm,
 the FAR,  kidnaped the president
 of the supreme court and the gov-
 ernment secretary of information
 and mortally wounded the secre-
 tary's son and chauffeur.   The
 government declared a 30-day
 state of siege on 10 May.
 PGT Secretary General Ber-
 nardo Alvarado Monzon and FAR
 leader Luis Turcios Lima have
 contacted various public media
 and prominent citizens seeking a
 mediator to obtain the release of
 political prisoners.   The govern-
 ment has persistently denied tak-
 ing the Communists in question--
 including central committee mem-
 ber Victor Manuel Gutierrez.
 This recriminatory terrorism
 may have been timed to embarrass
 the new government which is to be
 created under the constitution
 that went  into effect on 5 May.
 So far,  however,  the polit-
 ical repercussions of the terror-
 ism have been felt mainly by lame
 duck Provisional President En-
 rique Peralta.    The supreme
 court has asked the executive
 branch to inform police that
 full constitutional guarantees
 are now in effect and has de-
 manded that all persons now im-
 prisoned be placed at the dispo-
 sition of the courts without de-
 lay.    The national lawyers'  as-
 sociation has accused the govern-
 ment of constant violation of hu-
 man rights and has alleged that
 official arbitrariness has  led
 to the climate of insecurity pre-
 vailing in Guatemala.
 In contrast to the general
 panic that attended the wave of
 kidnapings at the end of 1965,
 life has continued normally in
 the capital since the 4 May kid-
 napings.     In spite of the in-
 creased security alert,   addi-
 tional attempts at violence and
 terrorism can be expected.
