 CYPRUS
 MOSCOW IMPLICITLY CRITICAL OF TURKEY, PESSIMISTIC OVER FUTURE
 Moscow has shown signs of a sli3htly more critical stance toward
 Turkey on the Cyprus q>estion combined with pessimism aver the
 political future of the island republic.                Although President Podgornyy
 in his 8 September speech in Sofia continued the practice of refraining
 from direct criticism of Ankara, some comment has implicitly conv3yed
 Moscow's irritation.   Both Turkey's military pressure on the Greek
 Cypriots to accept a settlement on Ankara's terms and its rejection
 of the Soviet proposal to solve the problem within the UN
 framework have received more pointed attention.  But comment has stopped
 short of criticizing Turkey by name.
 The strongest indication of Moscow's frustration over the Turkish
 position appeared in PRAVDA on 1 September i.i Oleg Orestov's
 international review.  Although in the past PRAVDA has softpedaled
 Turkish rejection of the Soviet proposal,  this time it underlined
 the unreasonableness of Ankara by noting that "despite the complete
 bankruptcy" of the Geneva talks, both "Turkey and the United States
 have advocated their resumption."  Citing Greek Foreign Minister
 Mavros' refusal to negotiate under pressure, PRAVDA identified this
 pressure as "the pronouncements of certain figures on Cyprus itself
 and outside Cyprus  .  .  . statements to the effect that foreign
 troops will not be withdrawn from Cyprus and also the demand for the
 withdrawal of UN troops"--thinly veiled references to remarks by
 Turkish Cypriot and Turkish leaders.   PRAVDA went on to label the
 statements "irresponsible" and sounding "like threats," which are
 worsening "an already grim situation."
 This note of pessimism  was reemphasized in Moscow radio broadcasts to
 East European listeners.  Yuriy Shalygin in a Polish-language commentary
 on the 5th saw not "even the slightest indication of hope" for a peaceful
 settlement of the crisis, and Vladimir Silantsev in a Romanian-language
 commentary on the 7th foresaw "the danger of the liquidation of this
 state and its partition . .  .  ."
 Podgornyy was not so gloomy in his remarks on the 8th, although he
 did say that the situation "continues to be complex and tense" and
 blamed the "present crisis" on "the continued intervention in the internal
 affairs of Cyprus by certain NATO circles."  In his speech, delivered
 at Bulgaria's 30th liberation anniversary ceremonies and carried live by
 Sofia radio, Podgornyy again put forth the Soviet proposal, omitting,

 however, any reference to the proposal's provision for "appropriate
 effective guarantees" by the permanent member-states of the
 Security Council.
 Moscow typicai.ly has not publicized its most recent diplomatic
 activity, and Athens and Ankara apparently have not confirmed
 Western news reports that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minicater Ilichev
 was visiting Turkey and due to visit Greece.   But Nicosia radio on
 the 10th announced that Ilichev was expected to arrive in Nicosia
 "within the new few da,r-" to exchange views on the Cyprus problem
 between the government   of (,yprus and the Soviet Union.

 ?                MIDDLE EAST
 PODGORNYY FAVORABLY CITES PX.ESTINIANS` RIGHT TO "STATEHOOD"
 President Podgornyy, in his 8 September speech in Sofia, put the
 Soviet Union on r'2cord as endorsing the Palestirian Arabs'
 "sovereign right to establish their orm statehood [gosudarstvennost]
 in one form or another."   In the past, Moscow has been reluctant
 to discuss the idea of a new Palestinian state and has generally
 stressed the need to insure undefined "legitimate national rights"
 of the Palestinians as an indispensable part of an overall Middle
 East peace settlement.*  Podgornyy's reference to some form of
 Palestinian "statehood," not further spelled out, would allow for
 considerable flexibility in interpretation.
 Podgornvy's reference may be related to the Soviet position at
 the upcoming session of the 28th TJN General Assembly, scheduled
 to begin on 17 September.   His speech occurred only days after
 the A_ab League Council had agreed to place the Palestine issue
 on the UNGA agenda as a separate item.   In noting the Arab League
 Council decision on 2  September, the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY
 stated that it had been made in response to a request by the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), adding that the PLO
 rejected UN Security Council Resolution 242 and saw the
 Palestinian issue as "one of existence, not border lines."  On
 3 September the Cairo newspaper AL-AKHBAR, according to the
 IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, reported that the Soviet Union not only welcomed
 the Arab League Colincil decision but also intended itse1   to adopt
 and defend the Palestine question during the UN session.    The
 source of AL-AKHBAR's information was not provided, however, and
 reaction from Moscow media has been limited; TASS on 2 September
 promptly reported the fact of the council decision, and it was
 noted in a TASS roundup on the 4th of the council session.  A
 Moscow Arabic-language commentary on the 3d, observing that the
 council decided to convene an Arab summit conference in Rabat on
 26 October, added that "another important decision" provided for
 raising the Palestine problem at the UN General Assembly.   Calling
 the Palestinian issue the "core" of the Middle East crisis, the
 broadcast said it was "necessary to tackle it" during the next
 UNGA session.

 Fodgornyy's favo.:ablo reference to the Palestinians' right to
 some form of statehood '!roaches at an authoritative level a
 subject that has long 'Lean sensitive for Soviet media.   In the
 past, Soviet references to the concept of a Palestinian state
 have been exceedingly rare.   For several years after the June
 1967 war, when such references occurred they were virtually
 always critical of the concept as an Israeli-sponsored scheme to
 establish a buffer state on the occupied West Bank territories,
 ostensibly governed by Arabs but in reality a "puppet" subject
 to Israeli control.*  The only known favorable Soviet reference
 to a new Palestinian state at that time occurred on 14 August
 1969 in a Yiddish-language broadcast to Israel over the
 "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress, which asserted that "an
 Arab state in Palestine would be a real step toward a political
 solution on the Middle East problem."  Although Soviet comment
 in more recent years has occasionally referred to the Palestinians'
 right to "self-determination," Moscow has been very reluctant to
 express a view on the desirability or possible forms of a new
 Palestinian state.
 Moscow's reluctance has probably been due in large part to disunity
 among the Palestinians themselves on this issue and to a desire not
 to become committed to  a policy position too soon on such a
 contentious question.   A possible indication of Moscow's current
 thinking on the form of a Palestinian state was provided in a
 30 July 1974 IZVESTIYA article by the editor-in-chief, Lev
 Tolkunov.   Tracing the "severe fate" suffered by the Palestinians
 for almost three decades, Tolkunov seemed optimistic that "realistic
 trends" were now prevailing in the Palestinian resistance movement
 with regard to the future of the occupied Palestinian lands.   By
 way of explanation, Tolkunov stated that many Palestinian leaders
 "believe that if Israel liberates the West Bank of the Jordan River
 and the Gaza strip, a Palestinian state [g osudarstvo] may be formed
 on this territory."  Urging the PLO groups  to unite behind a common
 political program, Tolkunov warned that "some people in the Near
 East" plan to seize control of*a new Palestinian state, "if it emerges
 in the Gaza strip and on the Wect Bank of the Jordan," and also plan
 to implement "so-called Palestinian autonomy within the framework of
 the Kingdom of Jordan."  Tolkunov also warned that some circles seek
 to eliminate the PLO as a political force and "to place at the head
 of the future state, when it is Treated," a bourgeoisie aligned with
 "Arab reaction and imperialism."
 *  See the TRENDS SUPPLEMENT of 15 October  1970,. pages 1-2, for a
 discussion of Soviet treatment of the idea of a Palestinian state
 during this pericd.

 U.S, -SOVIET  RELATIONS
 MOSCOW SILENT ON MAJOR ISSUES, PUSHES ROUTINE THEMES
 After the flurry of attention prompted by the change in the U.S.
 presidency, Soviet media have fallen uncharacteristically silent
 on U.S. developments, apparently reflecting Moscow's concern
 lest premature comment adversely affect the deve'_opment of
 relations with the new Administration.
 Brezhnev failed to even mention the United States--although he
 did mention detente--in his major speech at Novorossiysk on
 7 September.   Even such major developments as the prospective
 breakthrough on most-favored-nation status was barely mentioned
 by the Soviet media, although the Soviet reluctance to acknowledge
 the reciprocal concession on increased Jewish emigration is
 understandable.   In the meantime, Moscow has fallen. back on stock
 propaganda themes to keep alive the notion that U.S.-Soviet
 relations are continuing on track and that the prospects for
 detente remain bright.
 Although the Moscow domestic radio carried a brief report on
 17 August that a meeting between President Ford and Senators Jackson,
 Ribicoff, and Javits had reportedly opened the way for Senate
 approval of most-favored-nation status for the Soviet Union, this
 was apparently the only Soviet reference to what was subsequently
 described in the U.S. press as a deal involving an exchange of MFN
 status for a Soviet commi::ment to permit increased Jewish
 emigration.   In the meantime, the Soviet media have carried a
 spate of items reporting interviews with Western businessmen who
 were said to have expressed highly optimistic assessments of the
 prospects for U.S.-Soviet trade.
 Space cooperation and the prospects for disarmament were other
 themes played up by Soviet media over the past week.  PRAVDA
 reported an interview with the head of the Soviet cosmonaut
 delegation on its departure from Moscow for Houston.  The arrival
 of the cosmonauts in the United States, and the visit of NASA head
 Fletcher to Soviet Academy of Sciences President Keldysh were other
 items which attracted attention,   Although--except for a Trofimenko
 article in the latest issue of USA that is not yet available in
 translation--the Soviet media have remained silent on SALT, arms
 control themes have continued to be promoted.   A Berezhkov commentary
 on 9 September, for example, praised Secretary Kissinger's Miami
 speech, describing as particularly "interesting" his assertion that
 the accumulation of strategic weapons would not raise the level of
 security but rather the level of risk.

 GERMANY
 EAST BERLIN WELCOMES ESTABLISHMENT OF U.S.-GDR RELATIONS
 Soviet as well as East German comment has hailed the 4 September
 establishment of U.S.-GDR diplomatic relations as the final step
 in the international recogni':ion of the postwar status quo of two
 German states.   East German observers have in effect gloated over
 the fact that Washington, as an. East Berlin radio commentator
 said on the 9th, finally had "t:) adapt itself to reality in Europe,
 that is, to the existence of the two German states."  While
 comment has triumphantly underlined the success of the GDR's
 entire postwar policy of striving for international recognition as
 an  independent, sovereign state and nation--including the long
 battle against such West German policies as Willy Brandt's thesis
 of "two German states within one German nation"--treatment of the
 Washington signing ceremonies was low-keyed and moderate, reflecting
 East German satisfaction.
 GDR comment has highlighted the remarks by the head of the GDR
 delegation at the 4 September signing ceremony, Ambassador Herbert
 Suess, who noted that the signing was a "good beginning" for the
 future development of GDR-U.S. relations.   Both the official
 remarks and comment made clear that East Berlin hopes to expand
 its economic and trade relations with the United States as soon
 as possible, with comment expressing some concern over "discrimi-
 natory" trade provisions such as the "refusal to grant the GDR the
 most-favored-nation clause, as well as marketing restrictions, the
 still existing embargo list, and other things."  A radio commentator
 on the 9th noted that GDR leader Honecker in an AP interview in
 early June had listed these restrictions in commenting on future
 U.S.-GDR relations.
 NEGOTIATIONS ON CLAIMS,      East Berlin media have, not surprisingly,
 ISRAELI QUESTION             ignored the details of the agreement with
 Washington to hold negotiations in the near
 future "on the settlement of cla;.ms and other financial questions
 which are pending between them"--language from the joint communique
 issued it. Washington to cover future talks on claims by American citizens
 against the GDR Government and claims for possible compensation by
 Jewish and other victims who suffered under Nazism.   East Berlin
 reported that thesa negotiations would be held and NEUES DEUTSCHI.AND
 frontpaged the text of the communique, but without any elaboration.

 11 SEPTEMBER 1974
 The view that the GDR is one of the two successor states of Hitlers
 Third Reich--the basis for the U.S. position on claims against the
 GDR for victims of Nazism--has, with only one knoim exception, never
 been acknowledged by official East German spokesmu.n,  The exception
 came in the speech by GDR Foreign Minister Winzer at the 3.July 1973
 foreign ministers' meeting in Helsinki at the conclusion of the first
 stage of the Conference on Security and Cooperrtion Europe.   In
 discussing the postwar period and the issue of recognition of the
 postwar European borders, Winzer stated unequivocally--and his speech
 was published textually in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND--that "being a successor
 state of the former German Reich" the GDR must see that the European
 borders must never again be violated from "German territory."
 In an obvious effort to stem Arab speculation about reparations to
 Israel and to head off demands for compensation, a statement issued
 by the GDR Embassy in Cairo, reported by TASS and Arab media on the
 10th, refuted a Cairo AL-AHRAM report that the GDR had agreed to
 commence talks on payment of compensation to Jewish victims of
 Nazi Germany.   An IRAQI NEWS AGENCY report said the embassy statement
 declared that the GDR "categorically refused" to compensate Israel
 or any other Jewish or Zionist organization for the ",o-called Nazi
 atrocities" because "the GDR is not the successor of the Third Reich--
 Hitler's regime."  According to the TASS report, the embassy statement
 concluded that all questions related to payment of compensation were
 settled in the Potsdam Agreement of 2 August 1945, and that the U.S.-

 USSR REPEATS STAND ON BERLIN IN AGREEMENT ANNIVERSARY COMMENT
 Marking the third anniversary of the 3 September 1971 signing of the
 Qaudripartite Agreement on Berlin, Moscow commentators have reiterated
 the conventional Soviet interpretation as concerning only "West"
 Berlin rather than governing Big Four relations in the entire city.
 At the same time, Moscow has used the occasion to seemingly wind up
 the recent controversy over the establishment of the FRG Federal
 Environmental Agency in West Berlin and the resultant transit diffi-
 culties, while warning that the USSR and the GDR would respond
 similarly in the future to any "illegal" acts by Bonn considered
 contrary to the Quadripartite Agrement.   Since the Big Three and
 Moscow exchanged formal demarcheF on the FEA question early in
 August,  Moscow has gradually diminished its attention to the issue,
 perhaps to set the stage for the upcoming 15-16 September Cromvko visit
 to Bonn to prepare for a possible visit-to the Soviet Union by
 Chancellor Schmidt this fall.

 Highlighting Moscow comment on thhs.:-aiauivetsary, articles in PRAVDA
 and IZVESTIYA on the 3d and 4th, respectively, maintained the standard
 Soviet position on the agreement..   Thus PRAVDA's West Berlin correspon-
 dent Yuriy Voronov in his article on the 3ti cited the passage stating
 that "the western sectors of Berlin are not an integral part of the
 FRG and would continue not to be administered by it."  Voronov charged
 that "opponents of the four-power agreement," particularly leaders
 of the CDU/CSU opposition, have propounded  the view that "West Berlin
 is FRG land and are persistently fighting for the expansion of the
 'Federal presence"' in West Berlin.   Repeating criticism expressed in
 IZVESTIYA last July, Voronov agreed with "thooe observers who note
 the inconsistent and contradictory position  . . . adopted by some
 politicians from the coalition of FRG ruling parties."
 Voronov rejected the view that establishment: of the FEA fell within
 the limitations outlined in the Quadripartite Agreement to the effect
 that it does not deny West Berlin's ties with the FRG.   Everybody knows,
 Voronov said, that "there are ties and then there are ties."  He
 added:   "With regard to West Berlin, they are permissible only so
 long as they do not contradict the pivotal provision of the agreement
 to the effect that the city doer; not belong  to the FRG."  ;iidiculing
 the idea that the USSR and the GDR would have "to make concessions in
 West Berlin" in order to continue the further relaxation of tensions,
 Voronov warned that Moscow was prepared to take similar action in
 the future in defending what it sees as its   interests in the Quadri-
 partite Agreement:
 Any unlawful or unilateral actions contradicting the spirit
 and letter of the Quadripartite Agreement are bound to have
 and will have consequences.
 The 4 September IZVESTIYA article by T. Sergeyev, whil  making many of
 the same points as Voronov, omitted any threatening reference to
 "consequences," observing only that "a desire to evade the provisions"
 of the four-power agreement "or to interpret them unilaterally can lead
 only to an unnecessary aggravation of relations in the center of the
 continent."

 PRC-U, S,  RELATI ONS
 PEKING SAYS U.S. FACES "PROFOUND" ECONOMIC CRISIS
 Peking propaganda recently has given stepped-up attention to U.S.
 economic problems--a departure from its general silence on the
 Ford Administration policies in other areas.   This was capped by
 an atypical, albeit brief remark by Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien
 on 5 September that "the superpower known as the 'dollar
 empire' is now facing a profound crisis of acute inflation
 coupled with a decline in production."  Li's remark came in a
 speech at a banquet welcoming visiting Nigerian head of government
 General Gowon.
 Since former President Nixon's February 1972 Peking visit, Chinese
 leaders have been reluctant to comment specifically on U.S. economic
 and other internal problems, and they have not gone beyond the
 generalized formula used by Chou En-lai at the 10th CCP Congress
 in August 1973--that the United States, as well as the USSR, is
 "beset with troubles internally and externally" and is finding the
 going "tougher and tougher."  Peking media have lung provided
 routine, low-key reportage on U.S. problems, and they have given
 unusually full coverage to gloomy Ford Administration assessments
 and new policy moves designed to cope with the negative performance
 of  the economy.   Reporting on the President's 12 August address to
 Congress, NCNA had highlighted his remark that inflation represented
 his Administration's first priority, while a recent NCNA report on
 the 5 September White House economic conference quoted the Presidert_'s
 statement that "there is no quick fix for what ails our economy."
 NCNA went on to note gloomy remarks by others at the conference that
 there was little likelihood of an economic upturn next year an'.
 reported Senator Mansfield's 4 September remarks to the preps that
 he felt the United States was now in a recession and that current
 economic indicators were similar to those of the 1930s,
 Peking's portrayal of U.S.  economic problems has thus far not been
 accompanied by a change in Chinese treatment of U.S. foreign policy
 in general or of Sino-U.S.  relations in particular.   Li Hsien-nien's
 speech on the 9th duly underlined the basic Chinese belief that
 irreconciliable U.S. rivalry with the USSR r-imains the salient
 feature of the current international. scene, while NCNA's report on
 President Ford's 12 August address carefully noted his determination
 to maintain a strong U.S. military posture and to stand by Washington's
 commitments abroad.  Peking demonstrated its continued interest in
 improved Sino-U.S. relations by replaying in full the President's
 12 August promise to continue the new U.S, relationship with China,
 by giving its usual correct treatment to the latest U.S. Congressional
 delegation to visit China,  and by sustaining Chinese discretion on
 Watergate, avoiding mention of President Ford's pardon for former

 PRC-INDIA
 PRC FOREIGN MINISTRY VOICES SUPPORT FOR SIKKIM RESISTANCE
 Peking has capped its heavy outpouring of criticism over India's
 "annexation" of Sikkim with a strongly worded 11 September PRC
 Foreign Ministry statement that for the first time offers explicit
 Chinese support for Sikkimese resistance to Indian rule.  The
 statement represents the most authoritative Chinese denunciation
 of New Delhi since the Indian-Pakistani war of 1971.
 Similar to Peking's earlier attack in a 3 September PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article,* the foreign ministry statement denounced the
 Gandhi government by name and linked its incorporation of Sikkim
 with past Indian dismemberment of Pakistan and alleged Indian
 designs to use the recent successful atomic test to "do whatever
 it pleased with its neighbors."  The statement also echoed past
 Peking criticism in pointing to Moscow's supportive role for New
 Delhi's "colonialist" moves; it claimed that the USSR's role as
 the sole defender of Indian action shows that Moscow is "the boss
 behind the scenes as well as the abettor of Indian expansion."
 The statement added the voice of the Chinese "government" to the
 previous denunciation of India by the Chinese "people" in the
 3 September Commentator article.
 Though the Commentator article had avoided reference to possible
 Sikkimese resistance and had predicted only vaguely that India
 would be "sternly punished by history," the present statement hailed
 recent resistaac,--t by the Sikkim ruler and people and predicted that
 India's act "is bound to arouse the Sikkimese people and the people
 of the whole world, including the Indian people, to even stronger
 resistance."   It affirmed that China "absolutely does not recognize
 India's illegal annexation" and pledged that Peking "firmly supports"
 the "just struggle for national independence and sovereignty and
 against Indian expansionism."
 Peking in the past week had led tip to the foreign ministry statement
 with the greatest outpouring of critical Chinese comment on a South
 Asian issue in more than two years.  An 8 September PEOPLE'S DAILY
 article by Yuan Ku-ping had hinted at possible Chinese support for
 Sikkim resistance in noting that Sikkimese efforts to rebuff Indian

 COMMUNIST  RELATIONS
 ZHIVKOV SCORES CHINESE. PODGORNYY RESTRAINED AT SOFIA MEETING
 Mutual avowals of Soviet-Bulgarian solidarity and differ.-'ng public
 stances on the issues of China and a new world communist conference
 marked the speeches by Zhivkov and Podgornyy at the 8 September
 celebration in Sofia of Bulgaria's 30th liberation anniversary.
 Zhivkov roundly assailed the Peking leaders and called for both a
 European and a world conference of communist parties.   Podgornyy
 preserved the low profile that the Soviet Union has assumed on
 these issues during the current round of East European anniversary
 celebrnr.ions by avoiding direct statements on either. The Soviet
 Union's discretion on these issues in East European forums stands
 in contrast to the intensified anti-Peking campaign which the
 Soviet media have mounted in connection with the 25th anniversary
 of the PRC.
 Both speakers had refrained from polemics at the 1969 Bulgarian
 anniversary, which came in the wake of the Czechoslovak events
 and the June 1969 Moscow party conference.   In 1964, Brezhnev, who
 headed the Soviet delegation, joined Zhivkov in attacking the
 Chinese.   This year the Soviet Union has been represented by top
 leaders at each of the East European anniversary celebrations:
 Brezhnev attended Poland's in July, and Kosygin Romania's in
 August.
 ZHIVKOV      Zhivkov's blistering anti-Peking attack seemed calculated
 SPEECH       in part, at least, - draw unfavorable attention to the
 relative restraint recently shown by other East European
 leaders on this score:
 Our position is clear:  We do not hide our conviction
 that the adventurous, revisionist and nationalist course
 of the clique of Mao Tse-Tung threatens the socialist
 conquests of the Chinese people.   We resolutely reject
 and condemn the anti-Soviet and anticommunist slanders
 of Peking, its ferocious struggle against the unity
 and cohesion of the world socialist community, the
 international communist movement, the national liberation
 movements, and its reactionary pro-imperialist positions
 and actions on the world stage.

 11 SEPTEMBER 1974
 Zhivkov's attack came in the context of a review of Bulgaria.'s
 relations with other socialist countries, in whic:. ten coun-
 tries--including Romania--were listed as having ties of "strong
 militant friendship" with Sofia.  He then singled out Yugoslavia,
 Albania, and China for special comment.   With regard to Albania,
 he merely noted that Bulgaria would like to improve relations.
 With Ligard to Yugoslavia, he observed that "our country makes
 constant efforts to improve relations," and that "we have achieved
 new successes in this field."   (Belgrade, however, sent only a
 Yugoslav Preside:.cy member, Doronjski, to the Sofia festivities
 after sending a more prestigious figure, Vice President Stambolic,
 to the T3ucharest anniversary observance.)  Zhivkov buttressed his
 portrayal of improving Sofia-Belgrade relations by recalling
 elsewhere in his speech that after liberation in 1944 the Bulgarian
 People's Army had fought "shoulder to shoulder" both with the
 Soviet Army and the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army.
 In regard to Romania, the Bulgarian leader's indication of normal
 Sofia-Bucharest ties was qualified by a remark elsewhere in his
 speech that could be construed as critical of Ceausescu's course:
 "There are still people in this world who call themselves revolu-
 tionaries but who are so afraid for their independence vis-a-vis
 the Soviet Union" that they show a willingness to renounce the
 true revolutionary path.   The Bulgarians, he added, "gratefully
 use" the Soviet experience and example.
 Zhivkov followed up his attack on the Chinese with a vow to help
 strengthen "the united front of the communists of the world,"
 declaring that "th.e conditions for convoking a European and later
 a world conference of the communist and workers parties are ripe."
 He added that his party was prepared to participate in and contribute
 to the success of these conferences.  The directness of Zhivkov's
 appeal contrasted with the low-keyed endorsements of international
 party "conferences" registered by Gierek and Brezhnev in Warsaw in July.
 Brezhnev at that time directly endorsed only a European CP meeting.
 PODGORNYY     Following Zhivkov, Pcdgornyy delivered a largely
 SPEECH        routine speech replete with praise for Bulgaria's
 post-liberation achievements and its contribution
 to the socialist camp.   He praised Zhivkov's leadership as well as
 Brezhnev's.  Underscoring the Bulgarians' exemplary socialist
 credentials, the Soviet president declared that the new generation
 of Bulgarian people in the past 30 years has been "educated in the
 spirit of boundless fidelity to the ideals of Marxism-Leninism"
 and are "genuine patriots-internationalists."  In a veiled a"lusion

 to the Chinese, he went on to stress that "we know the Bulgarian
 Communist Party as an integral part of the world communist and
 workers movement, as a party which wages a merciless struggle
 against the enemies of the working class, against those who are
 trying to split its ranks."  In underscoring the solidarity of
 the Soviet and 'Bulgarian parties, Podgornyy singled out Zhivkov
 in a fairly standard tribute as "the well'-known figua,e of the
 international communist and workers movement and faithful Friend
 of the Soviet Union."  The tribute was comparable to Zhivkov's
 preceding praise of ?odgornyy as "the great son of the Soviet
 Union and one of the most important officials of the! CPSU and
 the international communist movement."   Zhivkov had followed up
 this tribute with more fulsome praise for Brezhnev as, among
 other things, a tireless fighter for world peace.
 Podgornyy recalled Brezhnev's remarks at the Polish liberation
 anniversary on "how much has been done in recent years" to lessen
 the cold war atmosphere in favor of cooperation on the basis of
 peaceful coexistence, citing the relaxation of tensions in Europe
 as largely responsible for the governmental changes in Portugal
 and Greece.   Referring to the opponents of detente in this context,
 Podgornyy registered a further vo1.led criticism of Peking on the
 score of its stand on PoLtugal's African territories, citing
 "those politicians who mask themselves under revolutionary
 phraseology and speak as supporters of peace and defenders of
 the interests of the people, but in fact cause harm to the
 liberation movements, trying to brake the genuine and positive
 shifts in the international arena."

 INDOCHINA
 HANOI CONDEMNS THAI LEGISLATION ON U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE
 Hanoi's continuing concern over the presence of U.S. military
 forces in Thailand has been reflected in its criticism of legislation,
 sponsored by former foreign minister and now assemblyman Thanat
 Khoman, that would give the Thai National Legislative Assembly
 greater control in regulating foreign troops stationed in Thailand.
 A DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 7 September claimed
 that the bill would "legalize" the presence of the troops, rather
 than restrict their activities, and a Hanoi radio commentary on
 the 6th assailed Thanat Khoman by name and identified him as Prime
 Minister Sanya's foreign affairs adviser.   Hanoi's sharp reaction
 is consistent with the critical attitude it has shown toward the
 Bangkok government since mid-May when it abandoned the circumspec-
 tion it had initially adopted following the installation of the
 Sanya government in October 1973.*  Thus far, there has been no
 criticism of the bill on foreign military forces from the Thai
 Communist Party'!3 c.landest_.ne station, Voice of the People of
 Thailand, or by Peking and Moscow.
 Ignoring Thanat Khoman's position that his bill will provide
 greater Thai control over U.S. forces, the DRV spokesman's state-
 ment denounced the proposal as "just another move to legalize the
 presence of the U.S. armed forces in Thailand" and "the conversion
 of that country into a military base of U.S. imperialism for use
 against the peoples of Southeast Asia."  It accused unnamed "Thai
 authorities" of "selling" Thailand's independence and sovereignty
 to the United States "at a cheap price," adding that they are also
 acting against the national rights of the Indochinese countries and
 are blatantly violating the 1962 Geneva agreement on Lios.
 The statement voiced the DRV Government's stern condemnt.iou of
 Thailand's "continuing collusion" in supporting U.S. designs of
 aggression and intervention in Indochina and supported the Thai
 people's struggle for complete U.S. withdrawal.   It reiterated the
 DRV stance that an end to Thai Government involvement in U.S. moves
 against Indochina remains "a basic condition" for the establishment
 of friendly Thai-Vietnamese relations.

 PEKING LAYS NEW STRESS ON UNITY, NARROWS ANTI-LIN CAMPAIGN
 While Peking continues to pay pro forma attentio.a to the campaign
 to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius, a new and recent insistence
 on unity seems to signal an effective pause in the campaign until
 China's leadership quandry arising from Chou Ea-lai's illness is
 resolved.  The new insistence on unity was most graphically
 demonstrated by Peking's 7 September television coverage of the
 4 September meeting between Mao and Togo President Eyadema, in
 which Eyadema was escorted by Teng Hsiao-ping.  Mao shook hands
 not only with the Togo delegation but also with Teng, a move that
 seems designed to underline that past opponents can be united.
 Teng.  the former CCP Secretary Ge..neral, was purged with Liu Shao-chi
 in 1966.  Monitoring of Chinese television coverage of such meetings
 since 1971 has not produced any earlier instance in which Mao was
 observed shaking hands with another PRC leader.
 The need for unity was also stressed by a September RED FLAG
 article which called for the nation to close its ranks politicc_lly
 and to set aside certain "controversial issues" in the campaign
 to criticize Lin and Confucius.   In unusua__ly frank terms, the
 article stressed the need for greater unity under party control
 to help guard against class enemies who try to "instigate the
 masses to fight one another."  In dealing with "certain matters"
 on which "no agreement can be reached in a short time," cadres
 are to keep the "public interest" in mind and seek common areas of
 agreement while "reserving minor differences."  Attempting to
 achieve greater unity by narrowing the scone of attack, the article
 warned that it is necessary to "prevent jurse:.ves from becoming
 endlessly entangled in certain problems" which might serve to turn
 the masses away from criticism of Lin and Confucius.
 Peking has continued to deal with protocol meetings and greetings
 formerly handled by Chou through temporary expedients.  Two of
 Chou's vice premiers--Teng Hsiao-ping and Li Hsien-nien--continue
 to stand in for the ailing premier and share hosting duties for
 visiting delegations, and during August Vice Chairman Wang Hung-wen
 filled in for Chou in his party.-government role during airport
 departure and return ceremonies for Li Hsien-nien's delegation to
 Romania.  Wang is the only party vice chairman to have made a public
 appearance since the Arm; Jay reception on 31 July, and even he has
 since dropped from sight, not making his customary appearance during
 recent Mao meetings with visiting African leaders.  Wang's absence

 PYONGYANG SOFTENS LINE ON JAPAI'?.:SE FOLLOWING SEOUL-TOKYO PFF7
 Pyongyang media have moderated their usual harsh treatment of the
 Japanese in the wake of friction between Seoul and Tokyo over the
 investigation of the 15 August assa.sination attempt on ROK President
 Pak Chong-hui--friction exacerbated by Pak's demand that Japan taka
 action against Chongnyon, the pro-DPRK overseas Korean organization
 in Japan.  While initially the DPRK press had treated events follow-
 ing the assassination incident as a sign of Japan-ROK collaboration
 to suppress Chongnyon, a 4 September DPRK Foreign Ministry statement
 signaled a new approach, dropping the charge of collusion and
 blaming Pak "personally" for requesting that the Japanese government
 oppress Chongnyon.   The statement expressed the DPRK's belief that
 the Japanese would not comply, since the request was "unreasonable
 and beyond the bounds of common sense."   A 5 September NODONG
 SINMUN signed commentary went beyond the ministry statement,
 charging that South Korea had "insolently demanded" that the
 Japanese restrict Chongnyon an,' that it was "natural" for Japan
 to refuse such a demand.  The commentary went on in a highly unusual
 display of praise to credit Japan with "past instances of protecting
 progressive-minded men of Asia after the Meiji restoration."
 A diminution of anti-Japan rhetoric was clearly evident in the
 9 September DPRK National Day speech by Pak Song-chol.   In contrast
 to past such speeches and other recent major anniversary addresses,
 Pak Song-chol did not accuse Japan either of obstructing Korean
 reunification or of being a U.S. lacKey,  and he referred only in
 passing to Japan's alleged plans to "reinvade" South Korea.  At
 the same time, he reflected Pyongyang's newest interpretation of
 ROK-Japanese relations in noting that the South Koreans are
 "entreating" the "Japanese government" to oppress Chongnyon.
 In line with this more positive treatment of Japan, Pyongyang has
 given unusually high level treatment to a visiting delegation of
 the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) headed by its chairman.   Kim Il-song
 attended a 6 September banquet for the JSP delegation, an honor he
 had previously reserved this year for heads of state or of ruling
 parties.   He also held a private meeting with the delegation.
 BACKGROUND      The current brouhaha between Seoul and Tokyo is
 Pyongyang's second experience in a year, following
 the Kim Tae-chung kidnaping, of serious tension erupting between
 two governments it usually depicts as reactionary conspirators.

 In the Kim case, North Korean media initially presented Tokyo as
 an active partner in the incident, but eventually noted the split
 caused between the two countries over the kidnaping and stopped
 describing Japan as an active participant.
 Pyongyang's original interpretation of events after the 15 August
 shooting in which Mrs. Pak was killed suggested that Seoul was using
 the incident to work "hand in g,ove" with the "Japanese reactionaries"
 against Chongnyon.   Prime Minister Tanaka's 19 August trip to Seoul
 for Mrs. Pak's funeral prompted a harsh 22 August NODONG SINMUN
 commentary which contained some of the strongest language against
 Tanaka DPRK media have ever used, reminiscent of their barrages at
 former Prime Minister Sato.*  The commentary accused Tanaka of
 promising cooperation with KOK schemes to link Chongnyon and North
 Korea with the assassination attempt in order to advance Japan's
 "reinvasion" of South Korea.  Less severe and more typical media
 comment accused Japan of plotting with the ROK, but noted that
 Japanese investigating authorities differed with South Korean claims
 about the assassination plot.
 *  Since 1972, when Sato resigned, the North Koreans have maintained
 a hard line toward Japanese activity in. South Korea but reduced the
 level of abusive hostility towards the Japanese government, and have
 indicated publicly on several occassions that they hoped Tanaka would
 not follow Sato's police toward the DPRK.

 N0TE.
 MOSCOW ON DRV ANNIVERSARY:  Moscow marked the 2 September. 29th anni-
 versary of the DRV's founding with the traditional message of gre-tings
 from Soviet party and state officials to their DRV counterparts, rallies
 to celebrate Soviet-Vietnamese friendship, and a DRV ambassador's
 reception which prompted the usual level of Soviet representation--
 Politburo member Polyanskiy and Secretariat member Dolgikh.  Reelecting
 Moscow's less sanguine view of the Vietnam situation since last year's
 anniversary, the leaders' message, unlike the 1973 greeting, directly
 acknowledged problems in implementing the Paris peace agreement
 and did not dwell upon the advantages for peaceful development
 accruing to Hanoi from the peace accord.   Consistent with Moscow's
 public statements at the time, last year's message had endorsed
 efforts to implement the Paris agreement in the interests of
 consolidating international peace and security but had not acknow-
 ledged Hanoi's complaints about violations of the accord. This
 year the message directly accused the Saigon government of
 attempting to "prevent" implementation of the peace agreement and to
 frustrate a political settlement," and it promised "all-sided assis-
 tance and effective support" for the Vietnamese "Just struggle."  The
 message made no allusion to U.S. involvement in Vietnam, although
 the Soviet leaders' greeting to the PRG on its 5 June founding anniver-
 sary had criticized "foreign forces" patronizing Saigon.  More recently
 Podgornyy charged, in an 8 September speech in Sofia, that Saigon had

 These statistics are based on the voicecast commentary output of the Moscow and
 Peking domestic and international radio services. The term "Commentary" is used
 to denote the lengthy item-radio talk, speech, press article or editorial, govern-
 ment or party statement, or diplomatic note. Items of extensive reportage are
 counted as commentaries.
 Figures in parentheses Indicate volume of comment during the preceding week.
 Topics and events given major attention in terms of volume are not always
 discussed in the body of the Trends. Some may have been covered in prior issues;
 in other cases the propaganda content may be routine or of minor significance.
 *  This figure excludes brief reports on Mao Tse-tung's meeting with
 Evadema.
