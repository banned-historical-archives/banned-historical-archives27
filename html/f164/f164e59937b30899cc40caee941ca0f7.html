 Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses Revolution Anniversary Rally
 LD312229 Tripoli Voice of Greater Arab Homeland
 in Arabic 2033 GMT 31 Aug 86
 [Speech by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, at mass
 rally held in Al-Khadra' Square in Tripoli marking the 17th
 anniversary of the 1 September Revolution on 31 August 1969
 - live]
 [Text] Brothers, in 1969 the revolutionaries moved forward. They
 challenged in those hours five U.S. bases on Libyan territory and
 a British military base. They challenged the firmly established
 royal system which the United States was protecting with its five
 bases. We who are saying today to hell with America said the
 same thing at the same time 17 years ago, in 1969, while we were
 confronting five U.S. bases with the revolutionary will [words
 indistinct] over our land, the land of our forefathers with dignity,
 with power, and with loftiness and until today we say, o brother,
 to hell with America, to hell with colonialism, to hell with
 imperialism, to hell with Zionism, to hell with agents of colonial-
 ism, the agents of imperialism, the agents of Zionism. Brothers
 we challenge them by our right to live. We challenge them by our
 right to live freely in the land of our fathers and forefathers. This
 land has been irrigated by the blood of our fathers and forefathers
 for the sake of freedom. This land is covered with the remains of
 our noble fathers and forefathers. This land, o brothers, every
 inch of it will be defended till death, and every drop of its sea and
 its gulf will be defended till death.
 At these glorious hours and in this great and eternal day, the day
 of liberation and victory, the day of dignity and glory, the day of
 challenge and pride, on this day we salute the martyrs of The
 Gulf of Sidra who were martyred on the line of death, 32 degrees
 and 30 minutes, and whose blood has colored the waters of the
 Gulf of Sidra. We ask that God's blessing be upon our martyrs,
 and we say to America: Our martyrs are in heaven and the dead
 U.S. servicemen are in hell; as Muhammad said to the infidel at
 the battle of Uhud; brothers, at such hours we moved with
 maximum courage; we, the free unionist officers and our brave
 soldiers, we moved at such hours on the eternal night of Monday,
 similar to this night. We were full of courage and full of faith in
 our right to freedom and life, and full of faith in victory. Victory
 was our destiny despite America.
 Today 0 brothers, on Monday in the year 1986 America chal-
 lenges us from across the oceans and seas. However, we say to
 it:  Reagan has to read history, at least recent history. However,
 Reagan does not read history. He reads cheap hollywood scenar-
 ios and that is the problem of the world today - namely, a second
 rate actor becomes the president of the biggest power. This is the
 crisis of democracy, and the crisis of morality and the crisis of
 civilization. We tell him to read history so that he can remember
 these hours when he opens the age of the night of Monday, 1969,
 and compares it with tonight, Monday night, 1986, and sees that
 we who are addressing him now, confronting and challenging
 him, we are the ones who with our people took action to destroy
 the monarchy which was protected by the United States with five
 military bases and protected by Britain with its biggest base in
 Tobruq. The United States used to have in Tripoli the biggest
 base outside its territory, the Wells Wheelus base [words indis-
 tinct]. The United States used to think that with five military
 bases it could terrorize Libya's revolutionaries and prevent them
 from thinking about revolution and destroying the monarchic
 agent regime, colonialism, the enemy of the masses, and the
 enemy of the nation. The United States used to think that with
 five military bases it was capable of terrorizing, capable of
 terrorizing the officers of the Libyan Army at that time and the
 sons of Libya to carry out revolution [as heard]. It is with the
 same erroneous information that the United States is basing its
 policy and stands, and involving itself on slippery slopes which
 are a threat to it and to world peace. We tell Reagan now: The
 same erroneous information which existed on Monday night,
 1969, exists on Monday night 1986. It believes that its power,
 might, and planes are capable of preventing Libyan youth from
 challenging it and destroying the regime which was dependent
 on America and which handed Libyan territory to it on a silver
 platter, as they say. America used to reassure the monarchic
 agent regime and reassure all its agents that there was absolutely
 no possibility of a change taking place in Libya and no one in
 Libya dared ever think about revolution. The evidence to this,
 according to them, was that this was not possible in view of the
 existence of five super-power bases which had undertaken to
 protect this monarchic regime. No one could think of destroying
 this regime or venture to confront five U.S. bases, in addition to
 the British base.
 However, these miscalculation made America get out of al-
 Millahah base and of other bases, humiliated, [word indistinct]
 and exhausted in the face of the revolutionaries. The same
 miscalculations and erroneous information, and the same illu-
 sions and the same arrogance rule the confrontation between us
 and America now. America believes that with its fleets and forces
 it can prevent us from moving forward with all our faith and force
 from liberating Palestine from the river to the sea. We swear
 before the world, brothers, that this is our cause, the cause of our
 lives, our destiny and history; the cause of our sons and our sons'
 sons - liberation of Palestine, inch by inch even if we wash it
 with blood and even if we cross on bridges made up of our bodies
 [chanting]. We announce to America that the issue of the unity
 of our Arab nation is an issue that concerns us and we will achieve
 this unity through peace or war, and America and others have
 nothing to do with the issue of removing borders between the
 ocean and the gulf. This is an Arab issue, an internal issue that
 concerns Arabs, and no one has the right to interfere in the Arab
 nation's internal affairs if it wants to change its map.
 We also say that when George Washington, whose history has
 been defiled by Reagan, liberated America from the hated
 British colonialism, and when Abraham Lincoln, whose history
 has also been defiled by Reagan, united the southern United
 States by force; we say no one had the right, foremost among
 them Britain at that time, to interfere in the issue of uniting
 America or liberating it from British colonialism. But this insig-
 nificant person does not read history. He does not know that
 George Washington, the first U.S. President, waged a war, used
 violence and terrorism, covert and overt action, against British
 colonialism until he liberated and saved the United States. I
 believe that Reagan has read a scenario of a Hollywood [word
 indistinct] and is ignorant of history. He does not know that

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP05-01559R000400410055-0
 Abraham Lincoln decided to unite America, unite north and
 south by war. He does not know that Mao Zedong united the
 great China by force. He does not know that Garibaldi united
 Italy's republics and provinces by force.
 He does not read history. He reads the scripts of trivial plays
 which all deal with the smuggling of a handful of dollars outside
 America. This is his education. But he will pay the price of this
 education. If America continues to obey Reagan the American
 people will pay the price of such stupidity and ignorance and of
 this disregard of convincing facts.
 Brothers, when we staged the revolution on a night such as this
 17 years ago, we did not decide to invade America, nor did we
 decide to invade Europe. We found them to be inside our home-
 land and inside our territory - on our land and inside our towns.
 We expelled them and triumphed over them. Italy, after 60 years
 of settlement and colonialism, was expelled in 1970. Twenty
 thousand Italians used to occupy the city of Tripoli when we
 staged the revolution. All the farms from AI-Zawiyah to Tarhuna
 to Misratah - all the agricultural land was Italian settlements.
 All Libyans know this. Who denies that these farms were occu-
 pied by the Italians? Twenty thousand Italians were occupying
 the city of Tripoli and used to speak Italian inside the city of
 Tripoli. All these building used to be occupied by Italians. All
 these schools used to be under the supervision of the Italians.
 They monopolized everything. The majority of Libyan.deputies
 at that time used to defend the Italian community because the
 deputies succeeded in the elections with the money of the Italians.
 After 60 years the Italians used to believe that they colonised the
 [words indistinct]. But finally the people - the rightful owners
 of the land and right - triumphed, and the Italians left this port
 which is in front of us - they departed in columns 60 years later;
 they left everything behind, except their suitcases containing
 their personal effects; they left behind their houses, farms, shops;
 they left behind everything. Everything was restored to the
 Libyan people [applause and chanting].
 What does this mean? It means that colonialism, no matter how
 long it may go on for, will end and the rightful owner of the land
 will tirumph. Even Spain regards the Arabs who colonized Spain
 for 800 years as colonialists who left after such a long period.
 The Israeli presence in Palestine is nothing but colonialism which
 was a phenomenon of World War II. It is a foreign colonialism
 and will be treated as such; it will be treated on the basis that it
 is a foreign colonialism and that it is our right to struggle with
 arms in order to liberate Palestine foot by foot. If Reagan does
 not like this then let him launch his intercontinental missiles and
 his missiles which reach the heavens. To hell with him and his
 missiles.
 The same issue that existed in 1969 exists on Monday 1986 -
 we are still in the same position, resisting colonialism and foreign
 domination, and struggling for the sake of liberty and for the sake
 of our right and the right of all nations so that they can live proud
 and free in their own homelands. Nothing has changed as fas as
 we are concerned. In 1911. our families fought the Italians and
 offered caravans of martyrs for the sake of the freedom of their
 land and so that they could live in their homeland free. Colonial-
 ism came to us after independence - America, Britain and the
 Italian colonialism came. We did not enjoy independence and
 freedom after World War II. We gave assistance to Britain
 during World War II. We fought on the side of the British forces.
 Britain, thanks to our assistance, was able to defeat Italy in
 Libya. But Britain colonized us by replacing Italy. Libyan terri-
 tory became open to the British until a night such as this in 1969.
 Colonialism was replaced by colonialism. Britain should have
 appreciated our attitude during World War II. It should have
 respected the Libyans because they allied themselves with it
 against the Italian fascist colonialism at that time. It should have,
 left Libya to its own people.
 Had Britain any ethics, principles, and civilization it would have
 done so. But instead of thanking us and leaving our land to us
 because we fought on its side and enabled it to defeat Italy on
 Libyan territory, it colonized us and installed Idris al-Sanusi as
 a king over us, against our will, because he was Britain's lackey
 for a long time past. It enabled the dirty Al-Sanusi family to have
 control over the proud Libyan people - the boot of one Libyan
 equals all the sons of the reactionary dirty Al-Sanusi family
 [chanting]; a lackey without origin and lacking a homeland,
 lacking religion. Britain gave that family control over our people.
 It transformed Libya into a kingdom while we never knew kings
 before; we never had a monarchical history. Suddenly we became
 a kingdom, British-style, because Britain is a kingdom. Britain
 until today is in alliance with America against this people. What
 was the crime which the Libyan people committed? What have
 the Libyan people done against Britain for the latter to reward
 us in this way? Is it because we were in alliance with Britain
 during World War II and enabled it to defeat Italy? This was
 the situation in 1969. We did not have relations with America
 then. When Idris al-Sanusi became king all the dogs - the
 ministers and deputies - signed a treaty with America and
 brought American forces to Libya. Five bases - there were five
 bases in Libya - the Wheelus base was the biggest U.S. training
 base outside U.S. territory. There was the [name indistinct] base
 with all its huge depots, containing ammunition and nuclear
 bombs; there was the Tajura base for world-wide telecommuni-
 cations; it was able to reach all American fleets and America
 itself. There was the (Al-Wafyah) base for the training of the
 American Air Force. There was the Sidra base for directing
 American warships and fleets in the Mediterranean. This is in
 addition to the fact that Libyan territory and airspace were open
 for American and Britain.
 This was the situation which we found and which made us stage
 the revolution. The oil was in the hands of America. Agriculture
 was in Italy's hands. The town of Barqah was totally in Britain's
 hands. They installed a king over us; they installed a dirty family
 over us. The Al-Sanusi family even gave their daughters the titles
 of princesses and demanded that we should pay allegiance and
 be loyal to them. Utmost disregard for this great people! When
 we fought at the martyrs square we gave martyrs; we did so in
 the battles of Al-Hani, Al-Shatt, Al-Hmahruqah, Al-
 Gardhabiyah, Al-Margaf, Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, Al-Kufra,
 (Tu'adiyah) and Lisan al-Jifarah and Jabal Nafusah, but did the
 dirty family fight with us on our side? We deserved to be the
 kings - we, the people [chanting]. We the people deserved to be
 the rulers over our land which we later liberated with our blood
 [chanting].

 V. 2 Sep 86
 This was the situation that existed in Libya on a day such as this
 in 1969. We liberated our land by expelling America, Britain,
 and Italy and by handing the oil to the Libyan people and by
 giving the land to its owners. We have not changed. We did not
 become colonialists. We did not become terrorists. We are
 against colonialism. We are against terrorism. We did not
 become fanatics because we are against fanaticism and because
 we are builders of civilization; we were the ones who taught
 Europe and the whole world all the sciences on which the modern
 era is based. Nothing has changed; our attitude is the same as it
 was. We are still fighting for the sake of our freedom and in order
 to protect our land. This is a legitimate right of every nation. The
 same situation that existed on a night such as this in 1969 is the
 situation that America and Britain want to impose on Libya on
 Monday night in 1986.
 They want to colonize us. They want to bring the bases back to
 Libya. They want us to be dominated again. They want to install
 their dogs and lackeys over us. How about the sacrifices which
 our ancestors made? This trivial and ignorant Reagan does not
 know that our ancestors gave caravans of martyrs at this square
 - the martyrs square in the Al-Shatt, Al-Hani, Al-
 Gardhabiyah, Al-Margaf, and the Al-Jabal al-Akhdar battles;
 they gave martyrs at Al-Butnan, Al-Wahat, and Al-Ghizlan; he
 does not know that our ancestors gave caravans of martyrs for
 the sake of the liberty of Libya. He believes that he, by his
 aircraft, coming like a burglar in the darkness of night, dropping
 one bomb here and one bomb there, can make the Libyan people
 surrender. How can we surrender? Even if we die we will not
 surrender.
 The Italians killed 700,000 Libyans but the Libyan people did
 not die; the Arab nation did not die. Reagan is accustomed to the
 annihilation of the red Indian nation. They took blankets full of
 smallpox microbes and distributed them among the red Indians.
 What an ugly crime! Imagine! This is how they behave. They
 distributed those blankets among the red Indians. Millions of red
 Indians died. But Reagan cannot distribute among the Libyans
 blankets full of smallpox microbes; This is because we have put
 an end to smallpox; we have no smallpox here; even if he breeds
 smallpox microbes he cannot distribute blankets among the
 Libyan people. There is no way by which he can annihilate the
 Libyan people. He believes that his aircraft can annihilate the
 Libyan people. There is no nation in the world that can be
 annihilated by aircraft or by warships. Our number used to be
 less than it is now. We used to be I million or less when Italy
 came to invade us with all its warships. It shelled these towns.
 These red-colored buildings were shelled by their warships.
 Where is Italy today? Where are its warships? Where is Musso-
 lini? Where is Grazianni? Where is Italian colonialism? Where
 is Italian fascism? They are all in the dustbin of history. The
 dustbin of history is full of the trivial examples such as Reagan,
 and Thatcher. The peoples will always stay. Immortality is for
 the people. This people cannot be annihilated.
 I will tell you about our fight against America. First, the United
 States ? wants to colonize [tasta'mir] the Arab homeland, and
 wants to regain the southern shores of the Mediterranean so that
 it possesses the Mediterranean, both north and south - and this
 is not directed against Libya, but against the Soviet Union. Its
 post-World War II policy is to besiege the Soviet Union. Just as
 it tries to encircle it from the Mediterranean - from Libya and
 from the.shor'es of the Mediterranean - the United States seeks
 to encircle the Soviet Union on a large-scale from other oceans
 and seas and from other positions. The United States wants to be
 in control from Turkey to Tangiers - as the other shore of the
 Mediterranean is under the control of NATO, which is led by the
 United States. As for the remaining southern shore: occupied
 Palestine is open to U.S. military power; in Turkey, there are U.S.
 military bases; Egypt is completely' a U.S. colony, it is not an
 independent state at'all:'Do not blame at all Husni Mubarak,
 Abu Ghazalah, or any others: They are miserable people who
 hate the United States and hate the Israelis and want to be rid
 of them at any moment, but they are merely employees of the
 U.S. department in Egypt. They have no power whatsoever. They
 cannot even say to the doorman, close the door behind you. They
 are miserable and defeated people.
 Egypt has been colonized since 1973. Defeat was imposed on it,
 and it signed,the Camp David accords. It was subdued and
 capitulated to all the enemies' conditions. Egypt needs to be
 liberated. The Arab nation must work for the liberation of Egypt,
 for Egypt is occupied just as Palestine is occupied. Do not speak
 any longer of the liberation of Palestine, but speak of the liber-
 ation of both Egypt and Palestine. Zionism has occupied Egypt.
 If it were in the hands of Husni Mubarak, or Abu Ghazalah, or
 suchlike, the Americans and the Israelis would be leaving Egypt
 tomorrow. However, the matter is not in the hands of these
 miserable people. They are officers and I know them: They
 were with me here. We used to give them weapons and. we used
 to fight with them, and they used to fight the Americans and fight
 the Israelis and totally hated them. Husni Mubarak fought the
 Israelis several times.'The Israelis killed his relatives, his col-
 leagues, [members of] his clan, (?his people), and his soldiers. He
 cannot love them after the war that took place between them and
 after all the blood that was spilled. He hates them, it is in his
 blood. However, Egypt is'defeated. We must work for the liber-
 ation of Egypt, and for regaining Egypt.
 After Turkey, the United States wants Palestine, Egypt, and the
 other Arab countries, with the exception of Algeria, Syria, and
 Libya   these countries are beyond the control of the United
 States.America is determined to regain the Libyan coast, which
 is 2,000 km long and then will try to defeat Syria and regain the
 Syrian coast so that America's military control will stretch from
 Turkey to the Strait of Gibraltar. Why? Because of Libya? No,
 because of the Soviet Union. Indeed, if America triumphed over
 Libya and triumphed over Syria and Algeria, the Soviet Union's
 situation will be in danger; the Warsaw Pact in danger. The
 Mediterranean will become an American lake. This is one of the
 reasons for a joint struggle between us and the Soviet Union,
 because the fall Libya will lead to the siege of the Soviet Union,
 and defending Libya will lead to the defeat of the Soviet Union's
 enemy, which is America. This is the common denominator,
 common enemy, and common historical objective and struggle
 between us and the Soviet Union.
 America's objective is colonialism; the stories of Berlin, Rome
 and Vienna and (?I do not know where else a bomb exploded); it
 gave money to Sudan, gave money to Yemen, and gave money to
 Morocco. This is laughable and it is a mockery. This can not be
 used as a pretext to strike against a sleeping people with bombs

 NORTH AFRICA                               Q I
 [Text] Tunis, 30 Aug (APS) - Libya has asked the Ara states
 to carry out some action to stop U.S. threats to the Libyv;yf people,
 and has warned that the continuation of such a situatio will have
 serious repercussions for regional and internationp peace and
 security.
 The above was stated in an official memorandum distributed by
 the Arab League Secretariat to member states. The memoran-
 dum includes the text of a message from~'Kamil Hasan Mansur,
 secretary of the Libyan General People's Committee for Foreign
 Liaison, which Arab League Secrary General Chedli Klibi
 received yesterday.
 In his message, which he asked to be distributed to all member
 states, Mansur says that ?the United States is carrying out
 terrorist provocations against Libya. He refers to the statements
 of official White Houle and U.S. State Department spokesmen
 which call for the use of all means to commit aggression against
 Libya and whichlinstigate European countries and other coun-
 tries to be hostile to Libya and to boycott it.
 The secretar% of the Libyan General People's Committee for
 Foreign Lia son says that Libya views such developments as an
 attempt to 4eate baseless pretexts and to prepare world public
 opinion for  new aggression against the Libyan people.

 Arabs Reported Refused 4iitry Into Morocco

 [Text] Another con dquence of Rabat's rapprochement with
 Israel is that Arab ationals are being expelled or turned back.
 For the past few d ys, Arab tourists traveling via Algeria have
 found themselves turned back from Morocco: 288 cases of
 refusal of access h ve been registered to date.
 Yesterday 120 tra  ers were turned back, including 50 Alge-
 rians; 68 Tunisians; o  Egyptian; and one Libyan. Today eight
 Algerians, 27 Tunisians; nd one Iraqi were turned back. The
 only nationals to be spared are the Saudis and Jordanians.
 These measures raise a problem of the nonobservance of
 agreements linking Morocco with its neighbors. This is notably
 the case with turning back Algerian nationals resident in
 Morocco, whose position is governed by the agreement signed
 with that country in 1983. It may be recalled that this agreement
 guarantees free movement between the country of origin and the
 country of welcome for the nationals of both countries.
 Correction to Al-Qadhdhafi Anniversary Address
 The following correction pertains to page Q 4 of the item head-
 lined "Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses Revolution Anniversary Rally,"
 published in the 2 September Middle East & Africa Daily
 Report:
 Page Q 4 should begin: and [word indistinct]. It wants to
 colonize Libyan territory and colonize the Mediterranean in an
 attempt to [word indistinct] the Soviet Union. This is clear and
 done with. Firstly, the fedayeen who attacked Rome and Vienna;
 they attacked Israelis and not Americans. What is the meaning
 of America taking revenge for attacks against Israelis?
 This means that America is the protector of Israelis and is
 defending them with its military might. This has been firmly
 established. This means that the Soviet Union has the right to
 use its military power to defend its Arab friends. That is it, as
 long as the Americans use their military power to defend their
 Israelis friends and their allies; therefore, the Soviet Union has

 the right, according to this practice [matbaq] to use military
 power to defend its Arab allies and friends.
 America took revenge for an action carried out by unknown
 fedayeen against Israeli targets. This conflict between Palestin-
 ians and Israelis will not end until the liberation of Palestine.
 What is America's business carrying out a military action in
 revenge for the Rome and Vienna operations; although the two
 operations were against Israeli targets. This means that Israelis
 are American and Americans are Israelis. Any Arab country that
 recognizes America and has dealings with America is also consid-
 ered to have recognized Israel and to have dealings with Israelis;
 and any Arab ruler who befriends America and cooperates with
 America, must be considered by the Arab masses from the ocean
 to the gulf to be cooperating with Israelis and to be friends of
 Israelis and treat them in this way. [as heard]. The Arab masses
 from, the ocean to the gulf must realize that their true enemy who
 harms them is the United States, and any Arab ruler who puts
 his hand in America's hand is an agent, traitor, and depraved,
 and must be destroyed. Today I am inciting officers in Arab
 armies, soldiers in Arab armies, the youth of the Arab nation and
 the masses of the Arab nation, and telling them that the threat
 to the Arab nation is all coming from America and America
 wants to occupy the Arab nation. The struggle is at its strongest
 now and the confrontation is real between the American nation
 and the Arab nation.
 The Arab nation must confront the U.S. nation, and the Arab
 nation must triumph and be determined to triumph in this battle.
 All Arab military men, Arab youth, Arab students and the
 masses of the Arab nation must, while they are listening to my
 voice on this immortal night, enter the battle against traitor
 rulers; friends of America; friends of America and agents of
 America; enemies of Palestine and enemies of the future of the
 Arab nation. There is no friendship between us and America.
 America does not have friendship in its dictionary; or slaves or
 enemies. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi does not want to be America's
 agent, and, therefore, he is America's enemy and must simply be
 destroyed. Another Arab ruler accepts being an agent of the
 United States and is therefore not an enemy. Either agent or
 enemy. [chanting]
 We have heard, as the world did, of the Rome and Vienna
 operations and we challenged the United States at the UN
 Security Council to produce evidence that a Libyan carried out
 this operation. The U.S. President was unable to produce any
 evidence. As long as Reagan is making war because of operations
 aimed at Israelis by Palestinian fedayeen, he is not a U.S.
 President and deserves the title of the rabid dog of Israel. Reagan
 is a rabid dog of Israel, he is vulgar and more vulgar than a dog
 and does not deserve to be the President of the United States. To
 hell with him and to hell with his [word indistinct] and with his
 power. However much power he has, he will not be able to wipe
 out the Arab nation and will never be able to make us lower our
 voice [words indistinct]. [chanting]
 We are still asking the American people to bring Reagan to trial
 because he is a murderer and a war criminal. We are also asking
 the British people to bring Thatcher to trial because she is a
 murderess and a war criminal. Otherwise, vengeance between us
 and those murderers will not end. We forwarded a memorandum
 to all countries of the world in which we defied the United States
 to produce evidence that Libya is a terrorist state, and the United
 States, whom we challenge tonight, was unable to produce any
 evidence to prove that Libya is a terrorist state.
 In order to get the United States out of this embarrassment
 before the world, yesterday it fabricated that there was a Libyan
 plan for terrorist operations. In fact we were bewildered by this
 news and Europe was astonished, the whole world was aston-
 ished. We contacted the Europeans and told them to let their U.S.
 ally produce evidence proving that we are planning terrorist
 operations. They said that this is a strange matter; we cannot see
 any justification for any military action against Libya. Libya is
 a country with which we are friends and we have common
 interests across the Mediterranean. It is a popular democratic
 state; a state that is making great efforts [words indistinct] in
 order to wipe out backwardness; a state that has attained the
 highest degree of moral and humanitarian advancement; a state
 in which exists a unique humanitarian and jamahiri experience.
 Libya is a country that supports just causes and has no expan-
 sionist ambitions. It has not crossed the seas to colonize anyone
 and has not crossed the ocean to colonize America.
 Consequently, the Europeans said that they were surprised at this
 strange, peculiar, indigestible, unacceptable and unjustifiable
 U.S. stand against this small people. We told them to tell this to
 the world. Some of them said that Reagan has gone mad and we
 are afraid of him; that we should remain quiet about him until
 he goes. Europeans, European officials admitted that Reagan is
 mad and the world must be patient for 24 months until his (?term)
 ends. In the end, they were forced to announce - like the Italian
 prime minister announced yesterday - that we Italians have
 nothing against Libya and do not recognize that Libya is a
 terrorist state. Libya is opposed to terrorism and we have nothing
 against Libyan international policy. We find no justification for
 the U.S. military rampage in the Mediterranean. The interests
 of Europeans are threatened, the interests of Arabs are
 threatened, peace in the Mediterranean is threatened and, con-
 sequently, the Soviet Union is threatened because of this man's
 madness.
 I would like to tell you that the reason is that there is a desire in
 the world to revive military colonialism. There is currently a wave
 of military colonialism sweeping the world. Therefore, we should
 get ready and arm ourselves so that all nations can defend their
 freedom against this new wave. Hence, my call from here for the
 formation of an international front embracing all nations that
 oppose imperialism. In fact, we have begun to set up this inter-

 aggression against the Libyan people - talk about preparing
 submarines, programming cruise missiles, dispatching strategic
 aircraft to Europe, mobilizing and deploying the fleet and air-
 craft carriers off Libyan shores.
 Naturally, we do not care about such action. If it is intended to
 intimidate us, there is no force on the face of the earth that can
 intimidate us. If it is a real threat, and it most likely is, it will not
 intimidate us either, because we are determined to die.
 Their raids might kill 1,000, 2,000 or even 10,000 of us. But they
 will revive a nation. More, the Arab nation will be revived
 morally. The region will rise and its people and the Arab nation
 will become more indignant with the United States. We might
 lose economically and militarily, but we will gain politically and
 morally. The Arab nation and all the small peoples of the world
 will win.
 Naturally, the U.S. aggression does not need any pretext. But the
 U.S. Administration wants to trick, lie to and deceive public
 opinion. The U.S. Administration, and this is what is important,
 is planning serious terrorist acts against Americans and against
 American targets. [as heard]

 (?adopting his own) political and ideological stands. That means
 [words indistinct] (?an end to) world peace and peaceful coexis-
 tence.
 This means that the U.S. Administration is leading the 10th
 crusade against Islam the awakening of which is being witnessed
 now in the Jamahiriyah and in Iran. [Words indistinct] for
 Christians and Muslims alike [words indistinct] following the
 challenges laid down in the first memorandum which we wrote
 challenging that if the United States does not respond to these
 proposals aimed at avoiding catastrophe, we in Libya cannot live
 indefinitely under the permanent threat of organized state ter-
 rorism [words indistinct]. In this case, the world and the U.S.
 Administration will shoulder their responsibilities. In this
 respect, we would [words indistinct) that Reagan is the Hitler of
 the 20th century [as heard] who wants to destroy the world and
 sacrifice international peace. [words indistinct] we will not allow
 that battle to take place near the Libyan borders, and after that
 we [words indistinct] in the Mediterranean, nor in the region, nor
 in the whole world. Full responsibility will be shouldered by the
 U.S. Administration, by all the world, by the U.S. allies who work
 alongside the U.S. Administration, who are not trying to bring it
 back to its senses [words indistinct].
 We, as Libyan people, reject the accusations of terrorism in part
 and in whole. The Libyan people are the first victims of organized
 state terrorism by the U.S. Administration and by Reagan
 personally. We declare and challenge the U.S. Administration to
 produce the information it possesses on the persons and prepara-
 tions, either to Libya or to the world. We are prepared to
 cooperate in aborting such actions before they take place and in
 arresting the persons concerned and putting them on trial.
 We have already challenged the U.S. Administration in an
 official memorandum with regard to the allegations that
 prompted the first aggression. However, the U.S. Administration
 disregarded the memorandum. We are still committed to the
 memorandum. At the same time we make a proposal and chal-
 lenge the U.S. Administration to produce information and the
 names of individuals and and the targets and preparations with
 regard to the actions it claims and of which we have no knowledge
 so that it can be prevented and aborted and those individuals can
 be arrested and put on trial.. If the U.S. Administration possesses
 such information let it give it to us and we will work together to
 abort such terrorist attacks before they take place. We will
 apprehend these persons and put them on trial. We will put such
 persons on trial in an official court and the trial can be attended
 by foreign correspondents, or they can be tried by an interna-
 tional court. If the U.S. regime is saying that these terrorist
 actions are now in the stage of preparation and the and the
 aggression is because of such operations, then the aggression can
 be avoided and the operations can be avoided by supplying the
 information on the alleged plot and then we can solve the
 problem.
 However, if there is a decision to commit aggression he who wants
 to commit aggression does not need a pretext. In-such a case the
 situation will be clear: Libya is being punished for its political
 and ideological stands, and there is no peaceful coexistence of
 ideologies or respect for the sovereignty of peoples or for detente,
 peace, and security or for everyone living in his own borders
 In fact, despite the fact that the aggression was made in line with
 a U.S. decision and using U.S. forces, in reality the aggression
 emanated from Europe, because the 6th Fleet and the aircraft
 carriers and submarines [as heard] were sent from U.S. bases on
 European territory, strategic aircraft were flown from Europe.
 The fleet, its provisions, its fuel, its ammunition, its plans [word
 indistinct] came from European soil. This means that Europe is
 a partner in this aggression because the ability of the United
 States to launch an aggression from U.S. soil is very limited.
 Therefore, it should be clear to the European governments and
 peoples that they are a party to the aggression which was waged
 in the past and to that being prepared now, whether it is in
 accordance with their will or against it. They are a party to it and
 shoulder responsibility for it. And this must be clear to the
 European peoples, especially to the European peoples on the other
 side of the Mediterranean. All democratic forces and peace-
 loving forces and movements in Europe and in the United States,
 all journalists, writers, and intellectuals must bear responsibility
 for preventing a catastrophe and detering the U.S. Administra-
 tion which is motivated by madness for power. This is what I had
 to say. Are there any questions?
 [Unidentified reporter] How do explain the silence of the brother
 leader? He has moved around and visited all the regions but he
 did not address us and did not address the Libyan people.

 aggression he met all the Libyan people [words indistinct].
 [Unidentified rpeorter] Will he be giving a speech at the Monday
 celebrations?

 national front, in which all nations of Africa, Central and South
 America, Asia, the socialist camp as well as the forces of peace
 in Europe will participate - even the forces of peace in the
 United States. This front is in the process of being born now, the
 front that resulted in the creation of the international cen-
 ter:  Libya. The international conferences held on Libyan terri-
 tory have branches in all continents of the world. This front has
 been born.
 Reagan tried to set up a front against this front of the peoples.
 He gathered the industrialized states in Tokyo and announced
 that he wanted to set up a front consisting of the governments of
 the industrialized states to oppose the front made by Al-
 Qadhdhafi; just like that. See how stupid he is. The conference
 in Tokyo failed and the Japanese people attacked the participants
 and evicted Reagan and Thatcher. They told them: You are
 murderers; leave our country. The Japanese people still remem-
 ber the atomic bombs that the United States dropped on Japan.
 Thus, the Japanese people cannot accept the United States. The
 entire Japanese people are now supporting the Libyan people and
 the Palestinian people and the Arab cause. After firing rockets
 on him and expelling this despicable man from Japan, the
 governments he had gathered for the purpose of forming a front
 against our front hastened to declare that they were against all
 the decisions that the United States imposed on the seven indus-
 trialized states.
 Japan disavowed the Tokyo Declaration. Japan officially
 informed us that it disavows the Tokyo Declaration and that it
 does not consider Libya to be a terrorist state at all, bearing in
 mind that huge interests lie between Japan and the Libyan people
 that Japan will not compromise. France, Italy, Spain, and Ger-
 many, all of these states contacted us and told us: We have
 nothing against the Libyan people or the foreign policy of Libya.
 There exists, however, an American madness against the Libyan
 people. What is the reason for this? I will tell you.
 First there is a desire to colonize the world, particularly the Arab
 homeland, once again. The United States specifically wants to
 colonize the Arab homeland and to give it to the Israelis. That is
 to say, the United States wants to kick out the Arab nation and
 replace it by a Jewish nation - this is quite clear. Secondly, in
 non-political terms we can say that Reagan is suffereing from
 madness - I mean he suffers with his mentality [preceding word
 in English]. He suffers madness of the mind. That is to say that
 he suffers madness as an organic disease, or psychology [preced-
 ing word in English] disease. The foreign journalists who are
 present understand these words. As a matter of fact, I doubt
 whether Reagan is a person possessing all of his faculties.
 This is because he does things that make the entire world feel
 astonished, especially the use of aircraft carriers. This is some-
 thing that the world abandoned at the end of World War II and
 that the world has decided not to resort to again. Very simply, all
 those who followed the movements of his fleet on orders from the
 U.S. Administration were astounded. Even the American people,
 if they follow the movement of their own carriers and fleets, will
 be astounded, and will say that a madman is giving these orders.
 For example, one of the aircraft carriers was in Spain. Orders
 went out to it in the middle of the night to proceed full steam
 ahead to Greece. Officers, crew, and those involved with the
 aircraft carrier went on board in the middle of the night and then
 reached Crete - reached Greece. They stayed there. Why? The
 following. morning the matter appeared as if Reagan had not
 given the order and that he did not know of the movement of the
 carrier. The crew did not, know why the carrier should stay in
 Greece. After that an order was sent out to that carrier, which
 was in Greece, to suddenly return to Italy at maximum speed.
 The carrier set sail together with all the Naval units accompany-
 ing it, using fuel, while the crew on board were dissatisfied. I am
 astounded to see U.S. generals carrying out such mad orders. The
 officers of the U.S. 6th Fleet and those who are stationed at bases
 can hear me.now and they know that my words are true. They
 themselves say such words. They are obeying the orders of a
 madman.
 Reagan gathered three carriers and ordered them to pass through
 the Suez Canal, only to order them again to pass through the
 Strait of Gibraltar, and then told them to assemble in the Gulf
 of Sidra. They assembled. Then an order went out asking them
 to urgently disperse - one to steam toward Turkey, the second
 to sail to Gibraltar, and the third to head toward Egypt, and the
 other to occupied Palestine; he wanted them to disperse. They
 arrived at their destinations, only to receive another U.S. order
 to assemble once again near Italy. The carriers assembled near
 Italy. They received orders from Reagan telling them to disperse.
 I told you either Reagan is mad - that is to say he is actually a
 madman suffering from a mental disease - or is suffering from
 cancer, hardened arteries, or old age and is incapable of leading
 his own country or issuing orders due to the effect of these
 diseases. In both cases, he suffers from a disease - psychological
 or physical. I am speaking from a position of responsibility -
 and Europe and the United States can hear me and I am
 responsible for these words: I do not at all rule out the possibil-
 ity of Reagan being mad. He is a man whose behavior we loathe
 when we are now in the era of civilization and human rights and
 even animal rights - there are societies that now work to protect
 the rights of animals - and when the world has reached such a
 degree of civilization and has become humanitarian and peace
 orientated, and when the world has become like one single state,
 each part needing the others.
 While the world has advanced so much we also see the missiles,
 the mining of Nicaraguan harbors, the invasion of Grenada, the
 establishment of camps on Lebanese territory and on Chadian
 territory, striking at towns with missiles and bombing them with
 strategic bombers, the invasion of space and chemical warfare.
 Reagan opposed the destruction of chemical weapons and
 ordered that they should continue to be manufactured. Strange
 things are coming from this man. He is using a language the
 world has abandoned. He is using means that the world dis-
 approves of and has abandoned.
 Europe was burned by the fires of world Wars I and II and paid
 a price in terms of 30 million people killed during World War II.
 Europe does not want to pay the price of another 30 million
 people. In fact, if there is a war the price it will pay will be its
 very own existence. Any new war means intercontinental mis-
 siles, nuclear bombs - the destruction of mankind. The world
 has abandoned these, while Reagan has restored them. We - all
 nations: the nations of Europe, Asia, Africa, America including
 the American people themselves - disapprove and reject the

 w
 language of fleets, blockades, mines, war. We - all nations and
 all mankind - are in favor of peace, the destruction, of nuclear
 weapons, and the destruction of chemical weapons. The Soviet
 Union has a gigantic mighty force that equals the force of the
 United States. Gorbachev has intercontinental missiles; he has
 nuclear submarines. He has hundreds of warships. He has half
 the globe. He can lay mines, he can threaten, and he can launch
 intercontinental missiles. He can use the stars. [as heard]
 But look at him; Gorbachev, on every occasion, presents propos-
 als for safeguarding world peace: the destruction of nuclear
 weapons; halting nuclear tests; freeing the Mediterranean from
 the fleets of both the Soviet Union and the United States; the
 gradual withdrawal [as heard] from Afghanistan so that the
 Afghan sides can reach a solution; call for the withdrawal of all
 military bases throughout the world; calls for detente and
 peaceful coexistence; and calls for a meeting between leaders.
 Gorbachev continually submits such proposals.
 Gorbachev has mighty weapons similar to those of the United
 States. However, the difference lies in the two minds - between
 the two men. [as heard] One of them is mad, while the other has
 a sound mind: One of them is irresponsibile and the other is
 not: One of them is worthy of his post as leader of a superpower,
 while the other is not, and should remain as a second-class actor
 in Hollywood. Recently, Reagan, talking to friends at the White
 House told them: Gorbachev is weak and I am strong, and this
 is my opportunity to impose my control over the world and
 encircle the Soviet Union. He continued:  if I succeed in
 bringing down the revolution in Libya, Syria and Algeria and set
 foot on the north and south shores of the Mediterranean then this
 will be an historic opportunity to block the Soviet Union return-
 ing to a situation whereby it can defend itself: it will remain at
 our mercy. He told them that the entire globe is a vital sphere for
 the United States.
 Imagine, peaceful initiatives from the Soviet Union are met with
 such words from this imperialist! He says Gorbachev is weak.
 How? Gorbachev has the same weapons as the United States; in
 fact, he has more dangerous weapons. Therefore peaceful solu-
 tions are futile as far as the imperialists are concerned. One
 should not give them any peaceful intentions. They should only
 be resisted.
 The United States is hated throughout the world. Peoples every-
 where fight the United States. Any operation which takes place,
 the United States says that Libya is behind it. This means that
 it is no use saying anything, but to let him daily provide bombers
 and missiles to attack Libya, because every day mankind is
 dealing blows to American presence everywhere. So, an Ameri-
 can intelligence officer was killed in the Yemen: he was killed by
 a Yemeni, and not by a Libyan. An American intelligence officer
 was killed in Sudan: He was killed by a Sudanese. American
 soldiers - Marines - were killed in Tunisia: They were killed
 by Tunisians. In Morocco, in Tangier, some Americans were
 killed by Moroccans. U.S. sailors were killed in Naples by Italian
 youths. There were operations in Chile, in Indonesia, in Belgium:
 We do not know who carried them out.
 Imagine, yesterday the U.S. State Department [Al-Qadhdhafi
 corrects himself] the U.S. Pentagon comes out with the funny,
 Q 6                          NORTH AFRICA
 blatant, yet painful lie, circulated in the press, that Libya is
 planning to hijack a bus [hafilah] - I do not know in which part
 of the world - a bus carrying U.S. soldiers. Libya is planning to
 hijack them to use as hostages in order to barter them for the
 release of Palestinian prisoners of war who are in the United
 States and not in the hands of the Israelis. Alright, where is the
 Libyan who planned this hijacking of a bus?
 When the Americans said the day before yesterday that they
 discovered [pauses - changes thought] he started anew to move
 his carriers, and the world began to live on its nerves once again.
 They claimed that they discovered that Libya is planning terror-
 ist operations. We challenge him - and we are making a
 responsible political statement here - we challenge him to come
 before the Security Council, or before the Soviet Union, or before
 the Arab League, or before the NATO, the EEC, or the Socialist
 International, or the International Court of Justice, and reveal
 the evidence he has proving that there is a terrorist operation
 planned by Libya. We want to know who has planned these
 operations. Is there a secret, or is Reagan mad? [passage indis-
 tinct] Is there a hostile party which tells Reagan that this is a
 Libyan plan, and he believes it?
 The fact is we see that the Americans are naive and they believe
 false reports, because the information they had following the air
 raid said that Al-Qadhdhafi had lost his authority. What is this
 authority that Al-Qadhdhafi has? Authority is in the hands of
 the Libyan people. They have no information at all about Libya.
 They said that a military collective leadership has been set up in
 Libya. What military leadership? We have had a military lead-
 ership (?since) the revolution - the Revolution Command Coun-
 cil. We dissolved ourselves and the Jamahiriyah was established.
 Authority is not confined to Mu'ammar alone. Libya is a Jama-
 hiriyah and authority rests with the basic people's congresses and
 the people's committees. If we broadcast a law over the radio then
 it will not be effective in Libya because the authority that can
 enact laws in Libya is the people's congresses; it is the party which
 can enact laws. We cannot announce approval of the budget;
 saying that this department will get so and so, and this depart-
 ment will get so and so. This is not permitted. This can only come
 from the people's congresses. A budget not approved by the
 people's congresses will not be recognized by the Central Bank.
 The treasury will not recognize it. They say that Mu'ammar
 al-Qadhdhafi has enacted a law and has signed it, announced it
 over the radio. It will not be accepted by officials. Courts will not
 apply such a law if it is not enacted by the people's congresses;
 Laws are not enacted by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi; they are
 enacted by the people's congresses.
 The Americans have no information about the Jamahiri system
 or about the politial system in Libya. Imagine! They said that a
 collective military leadership has been set up in Libya. Imagine!
 As if Al-Qadhdhafi alone has the authority in his hands. What
 is this authority Al-Qadhdhafi has? Look at their information!
 They also claimed that there was a power struggle in Libya. Why
 did we introduce the Jamahiri theory which replaced the govern-
 ment theory? We did it so that it could solve any problem of a
 power struggle. Let Reagan read the first chapter of the Green
 Book on solving of the problem of democracy - by the establish-
 ment of the people's authority, a power struggle will be ended.
 The establishment of people's authority means that authority

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP05-01559R000400410055-0
 rests with the people, and this ends a power struggle. If authority
 rests with all the people, then that is it, the power struggle will
 come an end. The Libyan people have reached the authority by
 way of the congresses and the committees. Therefore we have put
 an end to power-struggle forever.
 Reagan said no, there is a power struggle in Libya. [passage
 indistinct] He says to them - Casey, the chief of his intelligence
 - tells his friends that at dawn every day - Reagan suffers from
 cancer and he does not sleep - Reagan asks him: Is Al-
 Qadhdhafi still in power? Has anything happened to him? Every
 day he asks Casey this question.
 Once there was a pro-Algerian demonstration, about which we
 spoke yesterday. I went to a police station and I met with a police
 officer who was accused of collaborating with France against
 Algeria. [words indistinct] he was frightened of this accusation.
 I sat with him in a room, and the telephone of the station [words
 indistinct] had a loud ringing tone. It was the town police station,
 and as such the telephone never stopped ringing. Whenever it
 rang, he would say to me: This call is about me. [words indis-
 tinct) Poor man; he thought like that because his mental condition
 was disturbed. Reagan is experiencing the same condition felt by
 that police officer. Every day at dawn, Reagan phones his
 [pauses] and this man, when the phone rings, always that it is
 Reagan on the phone. This man asks Reagan: Yes, what can I do
 for you? Reagan asks: Is Al-Qadhdhafi still in power? The man
 replies: Yes. Then Reagan asks:  How? I have been told that
 there is a power struggle, and that Al-Qadhdhafi is finished and
 no longer rules? [Al-Qadhdhafi laughs] Reagan then says: Al-
 right, soon we will finish him. How can you finish him? What a
 stupid thing to say? Reagan tells him: Give me a report about
 [words indsitinct]. Give me a report about the Libyan forces and
 their effectiveness. He answers: After the revolution about
 30,000 citizens took up arms and completed their training.
 Reagan at this point thumps his chair and says: You told me
 that the officers of the Libyan Army number 2,000 or 3,000, and
 that if one of them conspires he can [words indistinct]. How come
 you tell me that 30,000 have graduated? This is not true. The
 reports I have say that Libya has only 1,000 or 2,000 officers.
 The man replies: Every year, in every batch, 3,000 officers
 graduate.
 He replies:  3,000 youth who have been brought up during the
 era of the revolution. Who can control them? Reagan replies:
 How about those liars who told me that they could make the army
 move? How can they move 3,000 officers? How about the Libyan
 Army? The man answers: About I million men. Reagan then
 asks:  How? How can it be I million? Even America does not
 have an army I million strong. The man says: This is because
 the entire Libyan people are under arms - this is the theory of
 an armed people. Reagan then thumps the table and asks about
 the Libyan budget. He asks: Have you not told me that Libya
 has become bankrupt? The man replies: [passage indistinct] by
 moving the carriers, he threatens [words indistinct]. This is what
 Casey tells his friends. He tells them: I have become mad; the
 reason is this man Reagan, who every day, at dawn, asks
 me:  Has Al-Qadhdhafi any enemies? I tell him:  Al-
 Qadhdhafi has the Soviet Union. He has no unemployment such
 as we have in America, with 4,000 families living in the streets
 of Washington, on the sidewalks, homeless. How many
 Americans commit suicide every minute? The drugs in America!
 The unemployment - millions [passage indistinct] Families in
 thousands sleeping on the ground and homeless. Have you noth-
 ing else apart from Al-Qadhdhafi? It is as if Reagan was born to
 fight Al-Qadhdhafi! Brothers, as far as we are concerned there
 has been no change. Throughout history we have defended our
 land and freedom, struggled to liberate Palestine, our land, and
 to unite our arab nation. The ball is in their court. As far as
 America is concerned [passage omitted] first it is a state which
 wants to use its weapons - it has 5,000 atomic bombs; it has
 intercontinental missiles; it has an unlimited number of aircraft
 and bases, all ready to use against the Warsaw Pact, against the
 Soviet Union, which possesses half the globe. If he wants to use
 his intercontinental missiles, cruise [words indistinct] Libya has
 no antimissile missiles. Only the Soviet Union manufactures such
 a weapon system. They do not think. American citizens say [word
 indistinct] the taxes, I do not think about them. In other words,
 death and taxes are facts of life which the American citizen does
 not think about. The American citizen says: We no longer think
 about intercontinental missiles. It is like death and taxes as far
 as Americans are concerned. We do not think about them at all.
 If Reagan wants to use missiles, let him do so. If he is mad and
 wants to use missiles, then he will use them. He can use them.
 But will they put an end to a nation? By God they will not. Will
 they finish the Arab nation? By God they will not. Will they
 enable Reagan to get rid of the cancer? By God they will not.
 Will they allow him to live more than 24 months from the
 physical and political points of view? He may live more than 24
 months, but we would die as martyrs in defense of our land, the
 freedom of our country, seeking pride for our land and our people,
 and glory for our history; seeking to use our capabilities for our
 own benefit; seeking to see our people living in freedom. Anyone
 who dies for this cause is a saint!
 Had I died on the day of the raid on my house, I would have been
 the historic, holy sacrifice of all human history. By God, it would
 have been better; had I died I would have been a saint and holy
 martyr of humanity, in that one had been attacked by the greatest
 country in the world - an attack on his house and on his children
 - and it killed him. And suppose Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi was
 killed - would that mean the end of the Libyan people, the end.
 of the Arab nation and the surrender of their Palestinian cause
 and the issue of Arab unity? Jamal `Abd al-Nasir has died;
 Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi still exists. Guevara died, but Castro
 is there. They have killed Allende, yet the revolution is going on
 in Chile. The struggle of the peoples for freedom cannot end by
 the killing of a leader or a person by dropping bombs. Bombs have
 never eliminated people. You know. Do not think about what
 would happen if America were to use its weapons; it had already
 has.
 By God, if we had possessed aircraft carriers and ballistic missiles
 we would reciprocate. But we do not possess these and the only
 thing I would like to tell you concerning America is that -
 abroad we ignore it. If it comes to Libyan land, America should
 be certain that we will fight it and we will not surrender even to
 the very end. It will never win, nor can it consider Libya as
 another Grenada. This coast, which is 2,000 km on the Mediter-
 ranean Sea, is difficult for America to occupy. Even if it landed
 on a part of this coast, we will stamp on it and obliterate it. We

 will destroy any landing on the coast. Even if it succeeded in
 occupying the coast, we will turn the whole of Libya into hell.
 And after all, its aircraft carriers cannot enter the desert nor
 [words indistinct] neither its destroyers or frigates can cross the
 Green Mountain [Al-Jabal al-Akhdar][words indistinct] We will
 later force it to evict the aircraft carrier [words indistinct] if they
 are the masters of the sea, we are the masters of the land.
 America can not score victory over Libya on Libyan land. If it
 comes after us on our land, we must fight it and let it taste the
 bitterness, and misery, men and women fighting street to street
 and from house to house and from trench to trench ; and then an
 honorable and glorious battle will start, a holy battle. It will be
 the battle that we must martyr ourselves in. If we were not to be
 martyred over our land in defense of our freedom, then we would
 deserve to die. This is the sort of death that we accept in defense
 of our freedom over our land. We will turn the Libyan land into
 live coals; this is our duty. We are prepared to fight in every city
 and in every valley.
 [Slogans chanted:  War, war, we have made the decision to die;
 we will never forget it] For this reason, I tell you that we must
 direct ourselves to construction and edification, the edification of
 the Jamahiriyah, of Arab unity, the liberation of the occupied
 Arab land, continuing to support the cause of freedom every-
 where in the world.
 Listen, the United States is now conducting a psychological
 campaign against you. America has failed militarily. It has
 boycotted us economically to [word indistinct] a people which
 does not need. We do not even need Europe. There is no means
 that the United States has not tried to use against us, and failed.
 Now the United States is launching a psychological war against
 the Libyan people. This is what you must pay attention to:  it
 conducts radio broadcasts against you; it is using newspapers and
 publications against you. It is using all Egypt against you. Egypt
 is now a camp for terrorists, Americans and the U.S. intelligence
 fifth column, against Libya.
 God is most powerful. Husni Mubarak has in fact told us:     I
 cannot do anything; the United States has done something in
 Egypt. There is nothing I can do. The United States is using a
 fifth column against you. But as far as we are concerned, if we
 are sure there will be harm coming from Egypt then we will strike
 at the den from where harm is launched against our safety and
 our territory; whether from Egypt or from Mars. Everyone
 assumes one's responsibility. [slogans chanted: September,
 September] Playing with fire and fooling around will backfire. In
 the event of any threat against us from a neighboring state, we
 would move with a military force to destroy the source of such a
 threat. We launch this warning to America's agents. From all
 our borders we are capable of destroying the source of any threat,
 all the more so since their mistress, the United States, has
 enacted the law: The strong can strike at the weak. We too are
 strong in comparison with the other [word indistinct] around us.
 If the United States invades us because we are weak compared
 to it then we are strong in comparison with others who are
 considered as weak. And the United States cannot protest. If it
 protests then it too must retreat and stay within its own borders.
 As long as it gets out of its borders and strikes at others then we,
 according to the new U.S. standards, we would go outside our
 borders and strike at others.
 I warn all America's agents at our borders: By God, if we smell
 any danger from them, to our revolution, to our safety, even
 empty propaganda, by God we will strike with an iron fist,
 relentlessly. By God, we are afraid neither of America nor of
 America's grandfather! Besides, the (?weak) agents know us.
 They know that their peoples are with us, and their rev-
 olutionaries are with us. We'have secret revolutionary commit-
 tees inside their territories, from their own youths, their peoples
 who recognize us as leaders and not them. [slogans chanted:
 May a storm take away reaction; The revolution is led by the
 colonel, it gets stronger everyday; Al-Fatih is a terrible force]
 There is yet another challenge, a provocative challenge, a dirty
 challenge, God preserve you. The United States believes that the
 Libyans may sell their homeland because of their stomachs. They
 were told - the reports they have - they were told:  It suffices
 to boycott them militarily and not buy oil from them; then the
 Libyans will run out of money and destroy their revolution, their
 glory, and all their assets.
 Look at the humiliation! This is an humiliation directed at every
 Libyan man and woman, to every honorable Libyan family. They
 believe that with semolina, with biscuits, with butter and cheese,
 with watermelon, with all these dirty things we would abandon
 the revolution, glory, pride, and dignity which we have made
 thanks to the revolution. [slogans chanted:  With challenge..]
 [Al-Qadhdhafi interrupts] Not with chanting, not with chanting;
 you young men, not with chanting.
 [Words indistinct] In it a provocation, an insolent provcation. You
 will probably notice it. You will hear it tonight, tomorrow, and
 the day after, from Baghdad radio and the U.S. radios. You will
 hear that the United States relies on using economic matters
 against Libya and not on war. Since there [words indistinct] of
 war, then this is great: [as heard] A big power contemplates
 waging war against us. Since [words indistinct] war, then there
 would be another way. It is the way of economic blockade.
 However, how are they to achieve this? They say that the Libyans
 will no longer be able to eat cheese, butter, cookies and [words
 indistinct]. He (Reagan) treats the Libyan people like animals, if
 there is no longer [words indistinct]. The Libyan people are a
 great and honorable people. They have lived without petroleum
 for thousands of years.
 I have proposed to the oil-producing countries that we should stop
 pumping oil completely. They [as heard] said: You may be
 confident of the people who possess the oil, namely, the Libyan
 people. They know that when the situation becomes serious, they
 can live without oil and without all these luxuries. [crowd chants:
 we need tanks and arms, not luxuries].
 They told them: When the Libyans run out of money and their
 salaries are affected, and they are unable to get the things they
 are used to [sentence incomplete as heard] The plot was originally
 to transform us into a consumer market:  Commodities were
 brought from Japan, from Britain, the United States, from
 Honolulu and Mars [as heard] and offered in the market. We got

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/01/30: CIA-RDP05-01559R000400410055-0
 used to this. We said to them: Well, you have succeeded in
 making the Libyans accustomed to these things - and not the
 Libyans alone. For this is a plot against all the developing
 countries: They turn the developing countries into a consumer
 market and get them used to having clothes, food, and other
 things they were unaccustomed to earlier, so that they continue
 to need them.
 They said:  In earlier years, we succeeded in flooding the Lib-
 yans with luxury goods that they have not known before. They
 said: once these things become scarce, the Libyans will forget
 all about the revolution and glory, all about Palestine, Arab
 unity, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, his colleagues, and the free
 officers, and so on. They will begin to ask for money and will turn
 to the United States and begin cooperating with it.
 Imagine that. What an insult. This little man, tries to turn the
 Libyan people into an agent serving the United States. They
 could have mobilized a group like the Muslim Brotherhood, who
 are nothing but a CIA cell and who have been entrusted by the
 CIA with the task of corrupting the Islamic religion everywhere
 in the Islamic world. The Muslim Brotherhood is led by a U.S.
 intelligence officer, and it is no more than a cell or instrument of
 the U.S. CIA. This is a fact beyond any doubt: The Muslim
 Brotherhood is a cell, that is one of the tools of the U.S. intel-
 ligence.
 They could enlist the Muslim Brotherhood members; they could
 enlist a sick man, a cheap man, an ignoble person, an agent. They
 might succeed in this. But to bet on the entire Libyan people, and
 say the Libyan people could be turned into agents of America,
 and so abandon the Palestine cause, Arab unity, and Al-
 Qahdhafi, for whom the Libyan people are at present chanting
 and whom the Libyan people hold high - how to make them
 abandon Al-Qadhdhafi, the revolution, their principles and their
 independence, squander their freedom and glory and become
 agents - that is, to turn the Libyan people into agents serving
 U.S. policy? How?
 When the Libyans run out of money, they will not be able to
 remain without money. Then we will tell them: destroy your
 glory and your revolution, so that we may give you money. They
 say: Let them destroy their glory and their revolution, and then
 we will not give them money or anything else. What is required
 is for the Libyan people to destroy with their own hands the things
 they have built. What a disgusting challenge. This belittles the
 Libyan people. By God, this is a challenge and a provocation to
 the honor and dignity of every Libyan man or woman and every
 Libyan [word indistinct]
 I have been telling you this for many long years. You started
 talking about these things. Maybe a doctor, a person graduating
 in home economics, of a company employee has discussed these
 things. You started talking about them. We told
 you: economize here, economize there. [passage as heard]
 By God, I have seen them in Sri Lanka during the nonaligned
 conference: the people in their thousands used to wait and rush
 up to eat what the delegates left behind. They lived on the scraps
 from the conference: if they would rind a piece of watermelon,
 they would wolf it down. If they would rind a piece of bread
 thrown their way, they would eat it. If they would rind a piece of
 orange thrown away by a member of the delegations, they would
 wolf it down.
 I have told you that there are people who live on these things
 which you waste and throw away. I told you that you must give
 up the oil you use for cooking, which brings you nothing but heart
 disease and which you import drop after drop of. I told you that
 these confectionaries harm you and spoil the habits of your
 children. Your country has dates. Europe produces confectionar-
 ies instead of dates, because it has no dates. But you did not heed
 my words; you said: These people have confectionaries, and we
 must import them. I told you: All right, bring one kind in. You
 replied: No, we will bring in 20 kinds.
 Europe needs confectionaries because it has a cold climate and
 has no palm trees. If Europe had palm trees, the European would
 not have produced confectionaries and the world would not know
 about them.
 It is a shame for a country that has dates to import confectionar-
 ies and sell them in its shops.
 I have been talking about confectionaries, but the issue really
 concerns freedom, dignity, and our existence. Ultimately, we
 have paid the price for these in bombers flying over our heads.
 They said to ud: either yield, or we will annihilate you. Now
 they say they will resort to economic measures. They are chal-
 lenging us.
 However, we will not kneel to them. We did not kneel when we
 used to eat [word indsitinct]. Our fathers and forefathers used to
 eat [words indistinct] They stopped bringing rice from Italy. As
 for those who extended their hands [to Italy], we curse them at
 every battle. Every day, whenever we recall any battle, we curse
 them. Our generations curse them and so do the angels in heaven.
 We all curse that group of Libyans who on their own sold out
 their homeland. By God, each one of them blamed the others.
 They asked one; Do you know Mr So-and-so? He replied: No,
 not at all. Sons disowned their parents. [Words indistinct] entered
 the battle. his [not further identifiable] grandfather was righting
 in the battle. His uncle was righting and was martyred in the
 battle. He feels proud. He says:  Yes, my grandfather and my
 uncle have taken part in the battle. He says:  I wish all those
 who fought the battle were my family.
 However, those who extended their hands, starting with the
 Italians, asking them for rice, flour, and [words indistinct], are
 now being burning up in by the fires of hell. We curse them now.
 [words indistinct]
 One engages in a battle in [words indistinct] with the Italians, but
 the battle [passage indistinct]. Now we are facing a challenge to
 our dignity. The world says that the Libyan people [words
 indistinct] are selling out their revolution and glory. We have
 achieved this glory, thanks to the revolution, before the whole
 world. We have become the masters of the world. We have
 become international leaders. Peoples in Latin America look
 toward Libya. They felt sorry for Libya after the aggression
 against the house of Al-Qadhdhafi. Tripoli and Banghazi. I
 swear they were unhappy all over the world after the raid on libya

 [words indistinct]. Everyone started to say that I have become
 [words indistinct] because they witnessed the realization of their
 dream in Libya, the Jamahiriyah, the center of the international
 antimperialism platform, the revolutionary leadership. [passage
 indistinct] Why, because the despicable ones and the agents will
 not be glorified by history [words indistinct]. We have financial
 and economic capabilities, and assets to last for ever. Do not ever

 Anyone who weakens during their confrontation should be
 crushed immediately be it [words indistinct].
 Authority belongs to the masses; security belongs to the masses;
 and [word indistinct] to the masses. The masses are requested to
 crush anyone who weakens during this confrontation [words
 indistinct] every basic people's congress, its revolutionary forces,
 are responsible within the framework of the basic people's con-
 gress.
 [Prolonged chants: "Dawn of Freedom," "Jamahiriyah, power
 of the people," "Arab unity," "Against facism, against reacti-
 onaries," "1 September Revolution"] When they say, when they
 say [more chants] when they speak about a power struggle in
 Libya, it is insulting to the people's congresses. You have, in fact,
 led the United States into making the mistake of not believing
 that power is held by the People's Congresses. You are now
 required - regardless of my presence - to emphasize to the
 United States that power is not held by Al-Qadhdhafi, but that
 power is held by the Libyan people, who exercise such power
 through the people's congresses and the people's committees.
 Consequently, every people's congress is responsible for the
 defense of its area. Every people's congress is responsible for
 crushing any agent. Every people's congress is divided into
 districts, and the masses of every district are responsible for
 themselves, with regard to morale and to the destruction of the
 enemy agents, whom the enemy tries to infiltrate into the country
 - the spies of the United States, the spies of the reactionaries.
 As for anyone who is negligent in this confrontation, the people's
 congresses are responsible for crushing him without mercy and
 without referring to anyone. The masses of the district, and the
 masses of the basic people's congress [are responsible]. We will
 arm 1 million Libyan citizens in the towns that lie on the
 Mediterranean, and from next month the price of a gun for every
 Libyan citizen will be paid. We are waiting for them, and also
 the fish of the Mediterranean are waiting for them. [indistinct
 chants] [chants of "Jamahiriyah, Jamahiriyah"]
 As for Libya's international position, it is a great Jamahiriyah.
 It deserves to be great because it has resisted aggression by great
 states, and resisted aggression which was directed against great
 states. It is great because it resisted aggression by great states,
 and this treacherous aggression by great states may be directed
 against other great states, such as the Soviet Union or China, or
 any state of the world. Libya resisted this aggression and
 destroyed the air force which was used during this aggression,
 driving it back, defeated, dumping its bombs at sea. The Medi-
 terranean is still washing ashore the bodies of American pilots
 and the wreckage of their aircraft of various types. Therefore this
 Jamahiriyah has become truly great.
 Why is it named great? Because it checked aggression by great
 states - they call Britain Great Britain, and the United States
 is a superpower [last word in English] - the two jointly carried
 out an attack on the Libyan Jamahiriyah. Therefore the Jama-
 hiriyah is great because it checked aggression by great states.
 This aggression may be directed against Moscow, the great
 Soviet Union. Libya destroyed this aggression before it could
 reach Moscow. It struggled in defense of great states [words
 indistinct]. No one in the world can deny the Socialist Peoples
 Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah its greatness because in actual fact it
 checked this aggression by great states, and in doing so defended
 other great states. Therefore we deserve this title, we are worthy
 of this title despite the world.
 As for Europe - which America calls on to join its aggressive
 policy - we would like to tell it to appreciate its interests in
 Libya. No doubt Europe fully appreciates its own interests. We
 say to America that it should understand the volume of European
 interests in Libya - interests which America wants to destroy.
 America wants to destroy the interests of the European states. It
 does not care. America has no interests in Libya and wants to
 destroy Europe's interests in Libya. Look at the volume of trade
 exchange between Europe and Libya, trade exchange which
 America wants to deprive Europe. This year this volume of trade
 will reach 3 billion Libyan dinars - this is the volume of trade
 between Libya and the EEC member-states. The EEC member-
 states tells America that the volume of trade between them and
 Libya totals 3 billion Libyan dinars, that is to say $9 billion. How
 can Europe sacrifice $9 billion, which is the volume of trade
 between them and one single state - which is Libya - in return
 for an American dream? [words indistinct) The contracts
 between Libya and the EEC member-states are with companies
 and concern projects valued at 4 billion Libyan dinars - that is
 the value of the contracts between Libya and the EEC member
 states. That is to say they are worth $12 billion. He is ignorant
 [words indistinct]. There are major interests between Libya and
 Europe. There are interests between Europe and the Arab coun-
 tries.
 If Europe sides with America these interests will be destroyed,
 because we have the Arab masses on our side; everywhere we
 have Arab revolutionary committees on our side. They are capa-
 ble of destroying the interests of everyone who is hostile to the
 Great Jamahiriyah and the Arab nation. We are the embodiment
 of the glory of the Arab nation. We are the Arab nation's hope.
 All the free men of the Arab nation defend us. Those who killed
 Americans in the Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco are not
 Libyans - they are unknown Arab revolutionaries who defend
 Libya. Those who killed American soldiers in Lebanon by det-
 onating car bombs are not Libyans. There are many people
 standing in line ready to carry out martyrdom operations in this
 manner. If one of us dies, 300 Americans will die in return.

 I told you, he is mentally disturbed, [word indistinct] he is pushed

 There are figures for those who claim that Libya is interested
 only in terrorism, is spending money on terrorism. They are.
 deceiving you when they broadcast that Libya and Al-Qadhdhafi
 are squandering your money on terrorism. Let them give the
 accounts, bills. The maximum amount of money is given to the
 Palestinian resistance. It is shameful, as the Palestinian resis-

 Show us anyone who has proof of an account showing that Libya
 is spending money on terrorism [words indistinct]. The full bud-
 get is decided by the Libyan people, who understand the nature
 of the Jamahiri regime.
 The great changes which took place after the revolution - need
 I remind you of them every year, the list is long - every Libyan
 can answer the rabid campaign which is trying to harm our region
 and our achievements, which we realize every year and we
 witness during Al-Fatih Day. So far, 15,000 farms have been
 reclaimed. Before the revolution 15,000 farmers were without
 farms [words indistinct]. 15,000 farms were uncultivated but they
 have now become lands of paradise [words indistinct]. More than
 10,000 houses have been built for farmers, which means that
 10,000 farmers' families once lived in mud huts. You can appre-
 ciate the greatness of the deed of housing 10,000 families. Can
 Reagan do a similar thing for his farmers? We challenge him.
 Thousands of his people sleep on sidewalks in the capital. He is
 (?angry) at how a country can turn its oil into a factor such as
 this; it means his country is advanced, but he does not want
 progress for his nation, but regression. In America money should
 be with the rulers, who manage banks and hotels, and it should
 be spent on cars, gambling and night clubs; there should be a
 bourgeois, aristocratic, rich and exploitative class. This is the
 case in the other oil countries.
 However, Libya turns its oil into wealth for the people, into
 factories, farms, roads, education and health. This to Reagan is
 something grave and he does not want it. He wants our nation to
 remain backward. More than 6,000 km of roads were paved for
 the farmers, [words indistinct], as well as roads connecting farms.
 [passage indistinct] Now we have turned the oil which was owned
 by a handful of exploiters and American companies - America,
 by the way, is angry because its companies were denied this oil
 - into ammonia, urea, and methanol, which are all oil deriva-
 tives, and which we now export. Reagan is angry at this and wants
 to destroy it. He said that Ra's Al-Unuf must be destroyed. He
 was raving mad. No matter how long a war may go on between
 two states they should not hit economic targets; except Iran and
 Iran who, whenever they err in this respect they try to hit back.
 After 6 years of war they are still striking at factories. It is wrong
 to strike at factories. He, from the very first day, without being
 at war, and without any reason said he wanted to strike at Ra's
 Al-Unuf.'Why? How? [Words indistinct] uses the veto as far as
 the future of nations is concerned. He wants us to receive his
 permission so that we can manage a factory. [Words indistinct].
 The production of bicycles, buses and trucks is done by us;
 whether the number is sufficient or not does not matter. But an
 industrial fortress has been established in Libya. Libya now
 exports methanol, produced from the crude oil which we used to
 export. Libya produces urea, fuel oil and [word indistinct] -
 Libya never did this in the past. [Words indistinct] used to take
 oil, and they used to refine it, producing these by-products and
 then sell them to (?themselves) in order to benefit from them,
 while we used to sell them cheap crude oil. Now we process our
 own oil and extract from it these by-products and sell them. Libya
 now has a cement production capacity - it is the biggest cement
 exporter in the Middle East. If the cement produced by Libyan
 plants is exported it will make Libya the biggest cement exporter
 in the Middle East; that is to say that the capacity of the cement
 factories in Libya makes Libya the biggest exporter of cement in
 the Middle East. [as heard] He is angry, naturally. How can he
 think about these things?
 What a difference between Libya in 1969 and 1986! The
 structure has changed. We have established 15,000 farms,
 10,000 houses for the masses, and we have built 6,000 kms of
 roads for the use of farmers. We have established oil industries,
 yet in the past our crude oil was exported to be processed into
 ammonium, methanol, urea, [word indistinct] and fuel oil to be
 re-exported to countries of the world. Libya has become the
 biggest exporter of cement in the region, while in the past its sand
 used to be trampled underfoot. Who in the past would have said
 that Libya was capable of having such factories? We have built
 them. The Libyan citizen's share of electricity in the past used
 to 300 kilowatts per annum, and now it has become 2,000 kw per
 annum. Imagine! Each one of us used to consume 300 KW of
 elecrticty per annum, and now it is 2,000 kw per annum. What
 an astounding transformation! Reagan said:  You spend your
 money on terrorism. Is this terrorism - cement, electricity,
 trucks, and so forth? [Al-Qadhdhafi laughs]
 He said: You are spending your money on terrorism. Terror-
 ism? These [word indistinct] This electricity, these vehicles,
 farms, roads, houses - to this day, 277,000 [words indistinct]

 We have built a chain of ports whose capacity is 9.5 million tons.
 This means that Libyan ports are the biggest ones with such a
 capacity in this region. There used to be not even one. a chain of

 only the king of Morocco who has violated this agreement, and
 only he who should be put on trial, because this decision of the
 Moroccan king ignores, disregards, and scorns the great Moroc-
 can Arab people; because there was a day when the Moroccan
 people had to stand in lines to cast their votes on the union
 referendum. At that time the Moroccan people approved the
 union. Therefore, those who established the union on the Moroc-
 can side were the masses of the Moroccan people, and those
 capable of cancelling the union are the masses of the Moroccan
 people, and they will not do so.
 Why does the king of Morocco disregard his people? Why did he
 ask them to stand in line, on I 'September in a' referendum on the
 union? The people create the union; then the king of Morocco
 announces over the radio the abolition of the union. Are they
 people or sheep? Why on the one hand do you consider them to
 be the people and ask for their opinion in a referendum, while on
 the other hand you dissolve the union without asking for the
 people's opinion? This has not happened only in Egypt and in
 Morocco. [as heard] Egypt is still a member of the Federation of
 Arab Republics. Its ruler all of a. sudden declared that it is no
 longer a member. We asked the Egyptian people for their opinion
 in a referendum, and they approved the federation. We did not
 'put this to the Egyptian People's Assembly but to the Egyptian
 people, so that there would be no delegation' standing in for the
 Egyptian people in this respect. [sentence indistinct]
 The Moroccan people have. been deeply humiliated before the
 world. The Moroccan people were asked their opinion on the
 union, and they approved it. Then the king of Morocco abrogated
 this union. This means that he has, nullified the will of the
 Moroccan people. In this matter there'is a struggle between the
 tool of government and the governed. [words indistinct]
 This is the era of -the masses. (?There is) no substitute for the
 people. [Word indistinct] the religion.. Where is the democracy?
 He [King Hassan] wrote to me in his message that the union was
 between the Jamahiriyah regime in Libya and the democratic,
 constitutional, monarchist regime in Morocco. Where is the
 democracy? Of course, we are speaking with all respect.
 First of all, he is a man who is older than I. Also, we have eaten
 bread and salt together, as the saying goes. The fact is that I had
 respected the king of Morocco for he - of all the Arab kings and
 rulers - had embarked on a bold step: We announce that nothing
 abusive should be said'or written about this man in the radio or
 press. He may have been helpless. He may have been forced
 under extenuating circumstances to (?abrogate the treaty). The
 union, however, still exists. The action entails 'disregard for the
 Moroccan people, contempt for the Moroccan people, an insult
 to the Moroccan people. It is also an insult to the Libyan people.
 How is it that you hold areferendum and then dissolve the union?
 You could have said-that Al-Qadhdhafi and Hassan have the
 right to dissolve the union.and that is it. Either of them can wake
 up in the morning and, according to his mood, dissolve the union.
 But as you have said, it isithe two peoples who have forged the
 union. It is only he who forges something that has the right to
 decide to annul it. The decision to establish a union was not made
 by King Hassan so' that he can revoke it. Therefore, King
 Hassan's decision is null and void, constitutionally and democrat-
 ically.
 NORTH AIFRRCA
 We demand a reasonable trial of the king of Morocco for this
 action, and we hold on to the union between the two fraternal
 peoples.,We view it as a historic gain. The United States and
 Israel were the first to welcome the decision by King Hassan
 because it served the interests of these two enemies. It was a
 setback for the Arab nation. The rulers of the Arab nation thus
 are daily providing this nation with a setback. Events will develop
 until the Arab nation is rid of its rulers, until the people's
 congresses, the people's committees, and the Jamahiri regime is
 established throughout the world, and until a unified Arab
 Jamahiriyah is established. But, if the fate of the Arab nation
 should remain in the hands of the rulers, the rulers will continue
 to treat the masses as though they are a herd of sheep. Al-Sadat
 used to whip on the Egyptian people, and Husni Mubarak
 inherited the whip from him. The Americans and the' Israelis,
 however, came and took the whip, and Husni Mubarak and the
 Egyptian ' people ? all became a herd and the ' whip - [Al-
 Qadhdhafi corrects himself] not a herd of sheep, but cows - and
 the whip came into the hands of the cowboy, who is American.
 That is what we can say at this glorious, and at the same time
 sad, moment about the action undertaken by King Hassan II. He
 wants to meet with the enemy, and we cannot but condemn such
 an action. Of course, it is a traitorous action. You meet with Peres
 who is slaughtering our'children in Lebanon and in Palestine, and
 who is destroying our cities and children and violating our dignity
 in Tunisia with his aircraft, and in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and
 in Iraq. Blood is being shed; his hands are soiled with blood and
 you shake hands with him? In the past, when the poor Arab

 Then he said: We will send you another person from the

 1978 the revolution of workers and hired hands - who were some

 indistinct] in order to take their monies, and with these monies
 administer a general budget. No; on the contrary. There should
 be no taxes, nor dues; prices should not rise. This is prosperity.
 The wheels are still turning in the direction of taking from the
 citizen in the interest of the general budget. It should be the
 opposite. One should take from the general budget in favor of the
 citizen. The citizen, if he wishes, will afterwards deduct from his
 budget - the general budget - if the latter needs anything. [as
 heard] If we want to purchase I million rifles, each one of us
 should pay 200 dinars, either in installments spread over a year
 or in a lump sum, as from next month, and purchase the rifles.
 Why should you cheat him? Why should we increase prices?
 Why should we tell the citizen that this was necessiated by taxes,
 dues, customs, and take money from by theft - the sum involved,
 200 dinars. Not at all. You should be free to (?take) 200 dinars
 and give him a rifle. Workers should not await solutions from the
 general people's committees.
 On this occasion, the 17th anniversary of the revolution, workers,
 from tomorrow, should implement the idea:  Workers are part-
 ners and not employees. Workers should take their share from
 production, and should give up everything else in return for
 production and management. If the workers are rich, then this is
 great. This is the radical change we believe in. The aim is to
 enable poor workers and the needy to become rich. But when they
 become rich they should not abandon work. If we have 400,000
 Libyans who will become rich and no longer work, then it will be
 right to leave them out of work [words indistinct]. Why are we
 frightened to proceed along this path? This is the path of
 transformation. Others claim that our workers will become rich.
 You - contractors, merchants, middlemen, those who do not
 produce, those who are lazy, and those who are drunk - allow
 yourselves to become rich, open clubs, and take money from the
 people by falsehood - do you deserve to become rich, or do the
 workers, who sweat and toil to build all these roads, houses and
 units, deserve to become rich? As far as I am concerned I would
 like to say that in the end, the United States is a goat - if you
 pardon the expression - it is stubborn. I can leave Libya, and
 the whole world can hear me say this. [chant from the crowd]
 Please postpone your chantings. I can leave Libya - please let
 finish what I want to say. [chants] Alright; alright. [chants] I can
 leave Libya and I can form an international army consisting of
 tens of thousands of fighters from Central and South America,
 Africa, and even Americans from the United States of America,
 Europe, and Asia; [chants] Alright. I can form an international
 army which has tens of thousands of fighters - Arabs and
 non-Arabs. After that I can shoulder my responsibility as a
 fighter and then announce the operations for which we claim
 responsibility and which we carry out. After that Reagan will
 know the state of his empire! I can - alright [interrupted by
 chants: We are with you in soul and in blood, the last drop of
 our blood]

 V. 2 Sep 86                                     Q 15
 Reagan is now accusing us of carrying out operations which we
 have not announced. He is putting the blame for such operations
 on a state, and wants this state to pay the price of operations
 unknown to us. We challenge him to bring to us the persons who
 have carried out or who are now planning these operations. Let
 him clarify his intentions - either he is mad or he wants to
 colonize the Arab homeland, and destroy the resistance [inter-
 rupted by chants] Alright. He now accuses us of operations about
 which we know nothing. He says that the Libyans are planning,
 the Libyans are carrying out terrorist operations in order to seek
 revenge. He is accusing us of carrying out such actions, while the
 fact remains that he is the one practicing official terrorism, and
 it is Libya which is the victim of international terrorism. It is the
 victim of official terrorism. No people can live constantly under
 the threat of aircraft carriers and the threat of another state every
 morning and every evening. He is imposing a state of fear on a
 small nation. This is the form of terrorism he wants to impose on
 the people of this earth. He has sufficient force with which he
 wants to intimidate others.
 I want to say to him that if you continue your tyranny, insolence,
 madness, and foolishness against the international community
 and world peace, then I Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, want to state
 that I can form an international army consisting of fighters
 against imperialism and against the United States of America
 personally - please stop chanting and let me finish what I want
 to say - I can form an army outside Libya and I can take with
 me thousands of fighters from among the Libyans. This army
 will spread out to all corners of the globe and destroy the
 American presence everywhere. Then we will announce every
 operation.
 I am not a coward like him, coming from beyond the sea and
 striking at a peaceful people with long-range missiles. The stick
 of the coward is long! We will announce every operation that my
 army carries out. We will even say: Tomorrow, we will do such
 and such, and destroy him. When we destroy something, we will
 claim responsibility by saying that the international army which
 I form has carried out that operation. I say to the world that if I
 make such a decision and begin to gather such an army which
 consists of tens of thousands of people, then within a few years
 the world will rid itself of the evil of the American neo-Nazi
 empire which the entire world now hates and which threatens
 world peace.
 The Soviet Union may not be able to destroy his empire, but it
 will be destroyed by an army to be formed by Mu'ammar
 al-Qadhdhafi from among the world's freedom-fighters. We will
 fight everywhere where no aircraft carriers or intercontinental
 missiles can reach us. This coward Reagan can stike at a town
 with his aircraft carriers. He can strike at peaceful people with
 his long-range missiles. But I warn him that this army which I
 will eventually form cannot be harmed by his missiles - they
 cannot strike at this secret army. Personnel of this army will be
 able to infiltrate anywhere in the world. The United States will
 be in real danger if I decide to form this army some day. I draw
 the attention of the freedom-righters in Central and South
 America, Africa, Asia, Europe and in the United States of
 America itself to get ready; when the time comes and I am
 compelled to make this serious decision, I will not hesitate to
 gather an army of tens of thousands of fighters, and then I will
 leave Libya so that Libya will not be subjected to Reagan's
 vengeance. We will then have to face revenge from Mu'ammar
 Al-Qadhdhafi and from those fighters whom I shall deploy in
 every spot of the world, and we will undermine the pillars of the
 U.S. empire = the big Satan - which is theatening the whole
 of mankind. It threatens peace; it threatens life. It is a neo-
 Nazism. I can destroy it with this army within a few years.
 [chants]
 This coward - because he knows that Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi
 resists U.S. imperialism - wants to take vengeance on Libya.
 At any given moment, I can embarrass him in front of the whole
 world. I leave Libya and fight him [words indistinct] the world.
 I leave Libya so that Libya can be spared. When we make such
 a decision we will not be afraid. We were not afraid on a night
 such as this when we surrounded the bases and toppled the regime
 on which he used to depend. We, when we declare our innocence
 of operations which he accuses us of carrying out, do not do so
 because we are afraid. If we were afraid we would not have
 threatened him with this decision.
 But, we are not responsible for something we have not decided
 ourselves. We destroyed his aircraft. We are shouldering our
 responsibility for that. We were not frightened. We did not say
 that his aircraft fell by an act of God. We downed the U.S.
 aircraft. We downed them during the first confrontation when
 they crossed the 32 degree latitude. We downed them during the
 raid that took place on 14 April, when they raided our towns.
 Twice we downed a group of his aircraft. Theres is still a (?sign)
 along our coastline. We pulled out the bodies of his airmen and
 showed them to the world on the [television] screen. We are not
 afraid, but we would like to declare that these operations about
 which he is talking, we do not know anything about; we are
 astonished at such operations. If he is a man, then let him show
 these operations to the world. These so-called secret plans and
 so-called persons who are said to be carrying them out, and the
 so-called targets - let him provide evidence, otherwise, he is a
 liar and a madman gambling dangerously with world peace.
 [chantings]
 At this moment, brothers, we challenge this enemy and declare
 our disdain for him and declare that in the end victory will be for
 us and the United States will suffer defeat because the last thing
 I want to say is that before the entire world I declare that I have
 decided to form an international army and that I will be respon-
 sible for commanding this army; that I will leave Libya and that
 this army will be deployed everywhere. I know that this army will
 defeat this evil empire; others empires that went on practicing
 their tyranny against mankind were destroyed by popular resis-
 tance: Napoleon, when he became a tyrant and filled the Danube
 with soldiers corpses and invaded the world, was defeated in
 Spain by the popular resistance in the Spanish mountains. Pop-
 ular resistance can make tyranny pay. Hulagu's [grandson of
 Genghis Khan] invasions were finished and destroyed. Napo-
 leon's invasions were destroyed. Hitler's empire was destroyed
 when he was resisted by:the peoples. The partisans movement in
 Eastern Europe - was the one that defeated Hitler, Reagan, no
 one: The resistance by the partisans was the one that destroyed
 Hitler's arrogant empire, which disregarded everything in the
 world, and turned the world into a vital sphere for Germany. The

 W                               W
 new Hitler is now turning the entire world into a vital sphere for
 the United States.
 This new Hitler - Reagan - does not read history, as I have
 told you. He did not read how Napoleon was destroyed. Popular
 resistance in Spain was what destroyed Napoleon. He did not
 read how Hitler was destroyed - by the resistance of communist
 partisans in Eastern Europe. He does not read history. He thinks
 that an empire which possesses weapons can last. Where is the
 Ottoman Empire? Where is the empire of Alexander the Great?
 Where is the empire of Genghis Khan? Where is Napoleon's
 empire? Where is Hitler's empire? They were all destroyed by
 the resistance of the peoples.
 I am still at the stage of leading the revolution on Libyan and
 Arab territory. I check America's military campaigns over our
 territory and will resist it bravely and we will stand our ground.
 We will make them suffer affliction. We will feed them to the
 fish in the Mediterranean if they reach our territory. I would like
 to say that Libya has the military capability and the human
 capability - it has armed people, and as from next month we
 will begin collecting the money for I million rifles in order to arm
 I million people. They will be deployed along the Mediterranean
 coast and we will announce the establishment of armed Libyan
 towns so that this coastline will become a burning fire.
 I wish to say that Libya has economic capabilities that cannot be
 harmed by the American economic blockade. To hell with his
 blockade. To hell with his fleets. We are fighting here for the
 sake of our nation's honor, and its right to live and remain. But
 brothers, if we want to defeat America on its own soil and remove
 its bases from all continents of the world I will be compelled to
 form this international army. When I put out a call to the
 freedom-fighters and the fighters against imperialism, thousands
 and thousands of people from all parts of the globe will respond
 to this call. Reagan and his empire will then see what fate awaits
 them. On this day - when we salute and celebrate the 17th
 anniversary of the historic revolution, which has changed the
 course of events in the world and which has constituted a new
 struggle phenomenon - we proudly salute, brothers, the officers
 and soldiers who staged the revolution and who carried out my
 order - the order of death - at an hour such as this, and who
 were not intimidated by the bases of America andd Britain, we
 salute the great people of Libya who took over the banner of the
 revolution and began to escalate it until the people's authority
 was established. These people, who have wealth, authority and
 arms in their hands and who are resisting, are not isolated. I say
 to you while you are fighting, with or without Mu'ammar al-
 Qadhdhafi and his colleagues, that you have friends with you;
 you have the Soviet Union, the great friend, with you; you have
 with you the entire socialist bloc; [applause and chants] you have
 with you the masses everywhere; you have with you wll peace-
 loving and freedom-loving peoples.
 If America is a superpower, we have a friend who is also a
 superpower: the Soviet Union, with all its capabilities, stood by
 the Libyan people. It is inevitable that you should know this. He
 Soviet Union shouldered its responsibility as a superpower
 against the rumpus of this mighty American power which has
 become a threaLto world peace and a threat to the existence of
 Q 16                         NORTH AFRICA
 the Soviet Union itself. The Soviet Union realizes now that its
 peace initiatives are being disregarded by imperialism and has
 realized that the imperialists should be confronted with force. I
 would like to tell you that capitalism, which has produced the
 American camp, cannot continue to exist because it is based on
 exploitation, and cannot resist against war; it cannot resist
 against a people's war; it cannot stand its ground for long. It is
 built on usury and exploitation, and usury and exploitation
 constitute a cowardly program that cannot last long in war and
 cannot finance a war as long the war is a lost war. If there is a
 profit to be obtained from war, then they will kindle a war.
 If capitalism benefits from war, then it declares war, but if the
 war is like that in Vietnam - popular resistance - it [words
 indistinct]. U.S. capitalism was what led to the defeat of the U.S.
 war machine in Vietnam. It did not pursue the war, because it
 had encountered resistance that smashed its combat elements.
 Capitalism is thus not prepared to build another war instrument
 that would be smashed without profit. it seeks profit, a market
 (?for its goods).
 In the final analysis the United States is a paper tiger. America
 will not last long, because its system is capitalist and has no
 relationship with progress. Socialism will triumph in the end.
 Socialism will triumph, because it is the force of progress, the one
 that will never lose its ties with history. as for capitalism, it is a
 reactionary force, hostile to freedom and to life itself. it is going
 to end; do not afraid of it. it is doomed to disappear.
 Look at the world map of yesterday, and then look at today's map.
 The soil is burning under the feet of the imperialists. look at the
 revolution on the U.S. borders. Reagan has told you: Al-
 Qadhdhafi is going to build another Libya in front of my house,
 meaning Nicaragua. Look where the revolution has reached!
 Cuba is only 90 miles away from the United States; it is free and
 challenging, having set up a communist system just to annoy
 America on its borders. He [Reagan] cannot remove it. Even the
 people of Grenada will triumph. We will ally ourselves with the
 people of Grenada until the new [word indistinct] returns to
 power. Revolution is flaring up in Salvador, Chile, Guatemala,
 and Honduras. These are on the borders of the United States. [as
 heard] he cannot defeat these peoples. They will triumph.
 Look at how the revolution is flaring up inside the U.S. borders.
 The blacks inside America: we are with them until the nation
 of blacks is formed. The indians inside America: we are with
 them until the nation of red Indians triumphs. America has time
 bombs inside it which will explode and destroy it. As for the
 socialist camp, it is a sound, healthy camp, free of these con-
 tradictions. the progressive societies are free of these diseases. As
 for the capitalist society, it is like the body of Reagan himself,
 ridden with deadly terminal diseases; it will come to an end.
 To conclude, as we speak we commemorate the anniversary of
 the historic revolution; we have proved our right to live with pride;
 we declare our triumph over imperialism and our determination
 to inflict final defeat upon it;
 We reaffirm our alliance with the Soviet Union, with the socialist
 community, and with all peoples struggling for their freedom; we

 reaffirm our alliance with the Palestinian combatants and the
 placing of all our capabilities at their disposal.
 At the same time, we express sadness and sorrow over the
 disgraceful act, contrary to the hopes of the Arab nation, perpe-
 trated by King Hassan II.
 Yesterday, during President Hafiz al-Asad's visit, there was an
 agreement to set up a union which you agreed to at your con-
 gresses, and which the Syrian people decided on between Libya
 and Syria in any form, any form. We two agree on the establish-
 ment of a union between both countries.
 On the other hand, we signed with Algeria a unity charter as
 provided by Algeria's national' charter, adopted by the Algerian
 people, and about which the Algerian people held a referendum
 - a union desired by the Algerian. people according to the
 Algerian charter, which will be submitted afterward to the
 Libyan and Algerian peoples.
 Only the strong survive. The struggle continues. Forward; victory
 is ours. [crowd shouts slogans hailing the Jamahiriyah and the

 Al-Qadhdhafi Reminisces About Revolution's Beginnings
 LD311043 Tripoli JANA in Arabic
 0700 GMT 31 Aug 86
 [Text] Tripoli, 21 Aug (JANA) - Within the Libyan Arab
 people's celebrations of the 17th anniversary of the Great al-
 Fatih Revolution, the brother leader of the revolution spoke over
 the radio and television [time and date not specified] about his
 reminiscences of when he was a student at the Sabha secondary
 school, where he started establishing secret revolutionary cells.
 In his reminiscences broadcast, which contained pictures, the
 leader referred to the situation that prevailed at that time in
 Sabha and the extent of oppression and injustice that was prac-
 ticed by the henchmen and symbols of the defunct regime against
 the sons of the people, who suffered from poverty, hunger and
 disease and who were deprived of the simplest fundamentals of
 life. The leader of the revolution also referred to his instigation,
 organization and leadership of the unity-motivated student and
 popular demonstrations that were staged to protest the conspir-
 acy of secession of Syria from the United Arab Republic. He also
 spoke about his collection of donations for the Algerian rev-
 olution and his effective participation in it.
 He pointed out that the demonstrations he led on such pan-Arab
 occasions were not appreciated by the defunct regime, which
 caused him to experience the oppression and injustices of the
 henchmen of the defunct regime. The province decided to expel
 him from his school and deprive him from attending any others
 in the province.
 With the aid of photographs, the brother leader then reminisced
 about his secondary school, a boarding school in the town of
 Misratah, and what he experienced there. He referred to his
 study at the military academy in the town of Al-Bayan al-Awwal,
 Banghazi, how he prepared the organization of the Free Unionist
 Q 17                         NORTH AFRICA
 Officers Movement and how he strove to make officers NCO's
 and soldiers who were reliable and who believed in the principles
 and aims of the movement join the movement. He recalled that
 no matter what difficulties and critical situations threatened the
 discovery of the movement, he endured.
 In his broadcast the brother leader talked about the officers who
 joined the revolution after March 1969 and tried to steal it. He
 pointed out that those officers did not suffer and struggle for the
 revolution as the free unionist officers struggled. They did not
 recognize the high aims and noble purposes for which we started
 the revolution, and they forgot our historic dream. He stressed
 that their attempt to steal the revolution was unethical. They did
 not face the forces of the defunct era, its police forces or the U.S.
 and British colonialist bases that were on Libyan Arab soil.
 In his broadcast, the leader pointed out that he feels for those
 who suffer, not only in Libya, but for the whole human race,
 because his suffering for the revolution made him feel for those
 who suffer in the world. The leader pointed out a number of
 economic and social problems from which the peoples suffer
 under the current ruling regimes and false democracies, and the
 grave results to their living, housing, and family relations. He
 stressed that this tyranny, oppression and exploitation should be
 ended, and the injustice should be lifted. The struggle should
 continue to achieve final freedom from all forms of injustice and
 tyranny.
 In his reminiscences, the brother leader talked about the crises
 faced by revolutions all over the world. He pointed out that the
 masses, for which the revolutionaries struggle, are normally the
 prey of and are exposed to colonialist propaganda campaigns,
 which may, even without their knowledge, cause them to take the
 side of their enemies. The leader gave the example that, in the
 revolutions the masses put their enemies in control of their
 destiny because they did not know what is good for them, the
 revolutions ended and collapsed. He stressed that the masses are
 able, at the time of troubles, to work miracles and do the
 impossible, working and sacrificing even at time of air raids.
 In his broadcast, the brother leader mentioned the failed barba-
 rous U.S.-NATO aggression against the Great Jamahiriyah last
 April, which was directed against him. He stressed that the U.S.
 Administration directed its failed barbarous aggression against
 him because he did not steal the popular mass revolution but lived
 it and felt for the sufferings of the masses. U.S. imperialism was
 not happy when it saw the Libyan Arab people having its people's
 authority, fully controlling its destiny, holding the authority,
 wealth and weapons and preaching the final freedom from all
 forms of slavery and exploitation to the peoples of the earth.
 In his reminiscences on this great historic occasion of the 17th
 anniversary of the Great Al-Fatih Revolution, the leader pointed
 out that it is a pleasure for the masses to learn about the struggle
 and sufferings of the makers of the revolution, the free unionist
 officers, through photographs.
 Concluding his broadcast, the leader of victory and defiance
 saluted the free unionist officers and congratulated the heroic
 Libyan Arab people, who are challenging the strongest imperial-
 ist force on earth and achieving victory over it. He also saluted

 in Arabic 1130 GMT 30 Aug 86
 [Text] Amid great revolutionary cohesion between the rev-
 olutionary forces and their leader and amid resounding and
 defiant revolutionary chants at a revolutionary festivity to mark
 the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the Great 1 September
 Revolution, the brother leader of the revolution yesterday opened
 the 9th session of the revolutionary committees.
 Major 'Abd al-Salam Ahmad Jallud, the brothers Abu Musa
 [Sa'id Musa Muragha] and Ahmad Jibril, some leaders of the
 Palestinian revolution, and correspondents of the foreign press,
 radio, and news agencies were present.
 Our correspondent at the ninth session of the revolutionary
 committees reports the following:
 [Begin recording by unidentified radio correspondent] Brothers
 in Arabism, peace and God's blessings be upon you. Amid the
 glorious festivities and with great pride and defiance the rev-
 olutionary forces that have converged from various parts of the
 Great Jamahiriyah to Tripoli began their ninth session on 29
 August.
 The brother leader of the revolution and founder of the rev-
 olutionary committees movement attended the opening of the
 session. The revolutionary force resolved that the slogan of the
 session will be: "For the sake of a genuine practice of the
 revolution, the revolutionary committees emphasize the chal-
 lenge and the building of the new Jamahiri society."
 The revolutionary force joined in with its leader, the leader of
 victory and defiance, and by its reverberating chants confirmed
 its commitment to the Green Thought, the thought of the Third
 World Theory and to its propagation at home and abroad, and
 emphasized their constant readiness to carry out the order of
 death in defense of the Great 1 September Revolution. The
 revolutionary force also expressed its determination to confront
 and engage challenges at home and abroad and to carry out the
 revolutionary tasks - the domestic, international, and pan-Arab
 tasks - so that the Arab nation will arise, achieve its unity, and
 defeat its enemy.
 Within the framework of his guiding and instigatory role, the
 brother leader and founder of the revolutionary committees
 movement addressed the conferees and spoke about several rev-
 olutionary issues. He stressed the role of the revolutionary com-
 mittees in consolidating the people's power and building human
 civilization. He referred to the Jamahiriyah's influential role in
 instigating the peoples of the world to liberate themselves from
 all the instruments of tyranny, oppression, and injustice, in view
 of the fact that the peoples of the world have set their hopes on
 the Jamahiriyah.
 The leader said that the session is being held amid circumstances
 created by the enemy in an attempt to influence our morale, and
 asserted that such an attempt will not dissuade the revolutionary
 force from carrying on with the implementation of its tasks.
 The leader also explained a number of domestic tasks which the
 revolutionary committees must carry out to confront the chal-
 lenges of U.S. imperialism. Until we meet in another dispatch, I
 greet you. Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you. [end

 Committees Issue Statement
 LD011453 Tripoli JANA in Arabic
 0815 GMT 1 Sep 86
 [Text] Tripoli, 1 Sep (JANA) - The 9th session of the rev-
 olutionary committees issued the following statement at the end
 of its meetings yesterday:
 At a time when the barbaric U.S. onslaught against the 1
 September Revolution is intensifying because the 1 September
 Revolution is the hope of the Arab masses and the haven of the
 free men of the world; because it is waging a popular revolution,
 the revolution of the future; because it is the only road to unity
 and liberation; because it heralds an end to the theory of arbi-
 trariness and the destruction of the societies of exploitation, and
 advocates the building of a united Arab Jamahiriyah from the
 Atlantic Ocean to the gulf;
 And at a time when U.S. imperialism is launching a terrorist
 military and media campaign against the Jamahiriyah and is
 imposing a political and economic blockade on it in order to divert
 it from its historic role of leading the Arab nation and instigating
 the peoples of the world against U.S. hegemony and the reaction-
 ary and fascist regimes of the Arab homeland and the world;
 And a time when the cause of freedom in the Jamahiriyah is
 being strengthened and the power of the people is being consoli-
 dated, socialism is being achieved, and a series of magnificent
 achievements are being crowned with the great man-made river;
 And a time when the heroic operations of the fighting rev-
 olutionary forces against the Zionist enemy are escalating, the
 world revolutionary movement is growing, and the anger of
 people against imperialist arrogance is rising and the Jama-
 hiriyah is turning into an international springboard for combat-
 ting imperialisms and reaction, and the fighters of the world are
 rallying around their internationalist leader Mu'ammar al-
 Qadhdhafi, leader of the challenge and victory; at this time, the
 9th session of the Revolutionary Committees Movement was held
 from 29-31 August under the slogan of "for the sake of a genuine
 practice of the revolution" to emphasize the challenge and the
 building of a new Jamahiri society. The 9th session has adopted
 a number of secret resolutions on the domestic, national [gawmi],
 and international levels - resolutions that seek to escalate the
 struggle, consolidate freedom, and bring the day of victory of the
 peoples closer. the 9th session of the revolutionary committees
 declares the following:
 First, the Revolutionary Committees Movement addresses a
 strong threat to the U.S. Administration that unless that terrorist
