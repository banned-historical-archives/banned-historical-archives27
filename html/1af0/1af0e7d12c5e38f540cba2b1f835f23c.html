 Z'he recent recall of Mar-
 shal Nlatvey Zakharov to serve
 again as chief of the Soviet
 General Staff and presumably as
 a first deputy defense minister
 has the earmarks of an interim
 assignment.
 His selection to
 rep ace   a late Marshal Biryu-
 zov suggests a continuing re-
 luctance by political leaders
 to entrust key military posts
 to younger officers who lack
 wartime experience at the army
 or army group level.
 Zakharov was chief of staff
 of the 64th Army at Stalingrad
 and subsequently was Malinov-
 sky's staff chief in central
 Europe and the Far East.  He
 was first named general staff
 chief and first deputy defense
 minister in 196Q, after he had
 served a three-year tour as com-
 mander of the Soviet forces in
 Germany.  He lost these. two pasts
 to Biryuzov in March 1963, amid
 speculation that he had become
 a scapegoat for the Cuban mis-
 sile crisis or the Penkovsky
 espionage case, or that he had
 been involved in a dispute over
 military allocations. The real
 reasons for his removal have
 never become clear, but his age
 and health may have been fac-
 tors.
 Zakharov is said to be
 a tough and brilliant soldier,
 popular with the army.  Although
 he allegedly favors traditional
 weaponry and methods, his pub-
 lic statements have consistently
 echoed the party line on troop
 cuts, nuclear surprise, rocket
 forces, and party control of the
 military establishment.        25X1
 OPERATIONS ON THE USSR'S NORTHERN SEA ROUTE IN 1964
 Despite severe climatic

 the USSR's Northern Sea Route
 were at a record level.  An ex-
 timated 2.25 million metric tons
 of cargo were carried during
 the four-month season.   This
 was an increase of 13 percent

 was approximately 3 percent above

 TYie conservative opposi-
 tion is made up primarily of
 middle--level party function-
 aries vvhose power is likely to
 be  undE~rmined  by  further  decen-
 tralizaition.  Their claims that
 decentralization has led and
 will  lead  to diffusion  of  ef-
 fort, wasted resources, and eco-
 nomic imbalances will probably
 be ovex?ruled, but they can later
 frustrate the policies adopted
 by fai]Ling to implement party
 directives.
 Tkre confrontation of these
 groups is complicated by the in-
 creasirrgly open rivalry of Yugo-
 slavia"s nationalities, a prob-
 lem wii;h which the congress will
 also have to deal.  The parties
 of the more developed republics,
 Slovenia and Croatia, favor
 greatex? decentralization as a
 means of retaining more funds
 for local development.  The par-
 ties oi' the less developed re-
 public.> generally wish to en-
 sure that further decentraliza-
 tion will not lessen the amount
 of federal funds committed for
 their cevelopment.  In an effort
 to quiet this rivalry, the au-
 thors of the seven-year plan
 (1964-~0), which will be adopted
 at the congress, have emphasized
 raisin;  the  living  standard  of
 all republics.
 Iri keeping with the endorse-
 ment oi' decentralization, the,
 new party statutes to be pre-
 sented at the congress are de-
 signed to restrict direct party
 interference in everyday gov-
 ernment and economic affairs and
 to introduce a measure of democ-
 racy into the operations of
 lower level party organizations.
 The statutes call for replace-
 ment of one fourth of the cen-
 tral committee members at each
 congress and periodic changes
 in the membership of executive
 committees--principles adopted
 by the government in 1963.
 This year's congress will
 probably see the first substan-
 tial personnel changes in lead-
 ing party bodies since 1952. Im-
 plementation of the new sta-
 tutes, which are designed to
 promote efficiency and broader
 based decision making, would
 also open the way for the new
 generation of party members to
 move up in party ranks.
 The conservatives will
 probably be the main losers,
 in that the party's moderate
 leadership can manipulate the
 changes to get rid of ineffec-
 tive officials--particularly
 World War II partisans who
 have failed to adapt to the
 needs of Yugoslavia's now more
 complex society.  The top lead-
 ership--Tito, Rankovic, Kar,d~elL
 --undoubtedly will remain./

 Peiping .may be launching a
 new campaign of political and eco-
 nomic pressure against the Japa-
 nese Government,  On 27 November,
 Chinese officials in Tokyo suddenly
 postponed signing contracts cover-
 ing a substantial portion of next
 year's Sino-Japanese trade.  They
 said Peiping had ordered them to
 delay final formalities on trans-
 actions involving purchase of fer-
 tilizer worth $80 million and
 about X520 million in contracts for
 Japanese steel and Chinese iron
 are.
 Peiping's latest move is prob-
 ably intended to add weight to pub-
 lic attacks on the Sato government
 which began on 21 November with a
 formal Foreign Ministry statement
 protesting the decison to bar the
 high-level Chinese party group,
 headed by politburo member Peng
 Chen, from Japan.  The statement
 was followed by vitriolic commen-
 tary in People's Daily attacking
 the Japanese prime minister by
 name and openly hinting at the
 possibility of retaliation for his
 "unreasonable" actions.  Chou En-
 la,i also criticized Tokyo's "un-
 friendly attitude" at an Albanian
 Embassy reception on 28 November.
 Peiping probably calculates
 that the threat of a break in
 trade relations will generate do-
 mestic pressure in Japan for
 changes in policy.  An attempt to
 influence the Japanese by cutting
 off commercial relations in 1958
 was z~ot successful, however, and
 the Chinese have thus far been
 careful to avoid steps which would
 foreclose the possibility of fur-   25X1
 ther political bargaining.
 The Chinese will probably seek to
 probe Tokyo's intentions more
 deeply--and to bring new pressure
 to bear--when influential Japanese
 Diet member Chuji Kuno visits
 China on 8 December.
 Sato will probably meet the
 Chinese moves initially by main-
 taining a firm-line on Japan's
 declared policy of separating
 politics from economics in deal-
 ing with the mainland.  It seems
 likely that he will insist that
 all contacts with the Chinese
 be handled throu h channels he
 can control.

 ECONOMIC PRIORITIES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Recent developments in
 China's modern weapons industry
 contrast sharply with continued
 stagnation in the general econ-
 omy,
 Tlhe detonation of a nuclear
 device, the testing of missiles
 at Shu;~ngchengtzu, the produc-
 tion o:f a ballistic missile sub-
 marine at Dairen, and renewed
 construction of conventional
 patrol submarines at Shanghai
 have emphasized the high prior-
 ity accorded modern weapons.
 The hiatus in production
 of military aircraft and sub-
 mariner over the past few years
 resultE~d from technical problems
 related to the withdrawal of So-
 viet specialists in 1960 as well
 as the general chaos caused by
 the aborted "leap forward."  Re-
 sumption of production reflects
 not only the substantial earlier

 Plans  for  the Iagg'ing agricul-

 that rural areas should not

 Third Five-Year Plan (1963-67),
 there is still no evidence that
 Peiping has been able to draft

 A major buildup of Commu-
 nist   Cliina.'s  civilian  People "s
 Militi;~,, virtually dormant for
 four  ycaa.rs,  has  been under  wa.y
 for five months.  In its exter-
 nal propa.ga.nda, Peiping ha.s en-
 couraged the impression that the
 chief purpose of the buildup is
 to defend Chin a, from "imperia.l-
 ist inva.ders."  Domestic propa-
 ga.nda., however, makes clear that
 a. more important aim is to create
 a. tool for curbing dissidence.
 For example, overseas broad-

 movement  of  1950.
 The present buildup takes
 place against a. history of ten
 years :in which the militia grew
 rapidly, then almost tata.lly
 colla.p:~ed.  In the heady atmos-
 phere of the "Leap forwa.rd,"
 militia ranks swelled suddenly
 to a. claimed 230 million, with
 predictably chaotic results.
 The authorities soon lost all
 firm knowledge of the actual
 number of men or units, their
 political reliability, what
 weapons they possessed, even
 what they were capable of doing.

 Despite the regime's seem-
 ing surge of confidence in the
 loyalty  of the new militiamen,
 its worries over their political
 reliability are far from over-

 further purification of militia.
 ranks and for distribution of
 weapons to only the most reliable
 pea.sa.nts a.nd workers.  There
 are a.lrea.dy indications that sup-
 plies of ammunition for local
 militia forces a.re being tightly
 controlled.  In the continuing
 absence of broad popular sup-
 port for regime policies, it is
 questionable whether a trust-
 worthy militia, force can be
 organized on a. large scale.
 Recently ava.ila.ble infor-
 mat ion                            1
 has provided a. cleaxer picture
 of the magnitude of the Commu-
 nist a.ppa.ra.tus used to infil-
 trate men a.nd materiel into
 South Vietnam.  This informa-
 tion  a.:Lso  inGlicates  that  the
 number of men infiltrated may
 be much higher than previously
 believed.
 Since  1959 when  the  f first
 unit o:f 400 men was assigned by
 Hanoi ~to set up an infiltration
 route, North Vietnam ha.s created
 a. soph:istica.ted a.nd highly se-
 cure system which handles the
 flow o:f men and materiel from
 the north, through Laos, a.nd in-
 to the Viet Cong organization.
 The  70th Tra.nsporta.tion  Group,
 directly subordinate to Hanoi,
 controls that portion of the
 system from North Vietnam to   25X1
 the South Vietnam - Laos border
 near the junction of Thua. Thien
 a.nd Qua.ng Nam provinces.  Some
 2,000 men, many of them porters,
 a.re used in this part of the
 operation.  Viet Cong authori-
 ties take control of the infil-
 trating groups a.nd materiel once
 they reach the South Vietnamese
 border.
 Although only portions of
 the total infiltration system
 have been reliably indentified,
 established routes extend as far
 south as Ta.y Ninh Province.

 part o:f the system.  If, as seems
 likely?the system extends to
 the tip of South Vietnam, as
 many as 10,000 may be involved.
 The extent of this operation
 and the number of men involved
 help explain Viet Cong ability
 to  acquire  large  quantities  of
 bloc-ma.nufa.ctured weapons a.nd
 ammunition ovex the last two
 years.
 Most of the people employed
 in the infiltration system a.re
 coolies assigned to the tra.ns-
 porta,t:ion  of  goods.   The  tra.ns-
 porta,tion stations a.re generally
 only a half -da.y's march apart,
 while the way stations for per-
 sonnel  a.re  a. whole  day  apart.
 There  ~a.re  400-600 men  for  every
 ten tr~a.nsportation stations, and
 each relay station ha.s three to
 seven guides.  To maximize se-
 curity the  guides  are  kept  ignor-
 ant of the exact location of the
 a.djace;nt  wa.y  stations,  meeting in-
 coming groups  about halfway be-
 tween ~sta.tions.
 many wa.y
 sta.tio:ns  are  protected  by up to
 a platoon of guards a.nd
 armed units of
 company size have been assigned
 by the 70th Group to protect
 the infiltration corridor from
 attack either from Laos or South
 Vietnam.  There can be little
 doubt that the present infiltra.-
 tion  system  is  ca.pa.ble  of  ma.in-
 ta.ining, and even increasing,
 the flow of men and arms to the
 Viet Cong.
 a minimum of 19,000 Viet
 Cong infiltrators entered South
 Vietnam between January 1959
 and August 1964.
 the
 total number is probably closer
 to 34,000.
 A unique aspect of the 1964
 infiltration is that the over-
 whelming majority of those re-
 ported coming into South Viet-
 nam.have been native northerners,
 drafted specifically for service
 in the south.  The typical infil-
 trator of earlier years had been
 drawn from a. pool of southerners
 regrouped in North Vietnam fol-
 lowing the 1954 Geneva. Agree-
 ments.  The present extensive
 use of native northern draftees
 suggests that few of the remain-
 ing members of the pool are
 physically fit for the rigors
 of guerrilla. wa.r.  It also dem-
 onstrates Hanoi's increased
 willingness to risk exposure
 of its active involvement in
 the war in order to improve
 Viet  Cong  ca.pa,bilities.

 BUDDHIST.i THREATEN NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST SOUTH VIETNAM REGIME
 Soui;h Vietnamese Premier Huong
 has remained firm in the face of
 pressure;, from student and Buddhist
 groups to resign or to reshuffle
 his government.  Although he appears
 for the present to have restored
 order in Saigon under martial law,
 the deci.;ion of central Vietnam
 Buddhist leader Tri Quang to oppose
 Huong openly poses  the threat  of  a
 concerted Buddhist campaign to top-
 ple the new regime,
 Quang, who was in the fore-
 front of Buddhist efforts against
 the Diem regime, ha,d hitherto stayed
 aloof fram the effort exerted by
 the hierarchy in Saigon to have the
 High National Council replace
 Huong~s government.  Quang now ha.s
 told US officials, however, that
 he will arder agitation a.ga.inst
 Huong if the entire government does
 not resign in the near future.
 Quang accused the government of
 being anti-Buddhist and repressive
 in using security forces against
 student demonstrators.
 Huong so far is still re-
 ceiving firm support from most
 of the key military and police
 afficials, although the position
 of Commander in Chief General
 Khanh is somewhat ambiguous.
 Khanh absented himself from Saigon
 during last week's demonstrations
 and ha.s avoided a,ny clear state-
 ment of support for Huong.  Dis-
 satisfaction among younger gen-
 erals over Khanh 's reinstatement
 in the army high command of most
 of the leaders of the former
 Minh junta. appears to be sharpen-
 ing a.s  a,  result  of  suspicions
 that Khanh may be maneuvering to

 NEW ANTI-COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN INDONESIA
 A new non-Communist Indone-
 sian political movement calling it-
 self   "Suka.rnoism" surfaced while
 President Sukarno was abroad this
 fall and is continuing its activi-
 ty.  Various political figures, in
 either the knowledge or the belief
 that Sukarno wants to see how the
 new group develops a,nd behaves,
 for the time being consider it
 safe or expedient to ally them-
 selves with it.
 The group, whose immediate
 objective is to block the further
 rise of the Indonesian Communist
 Party (PKI), is led by Minister
 of Trade Adam Malik,  Chaerul
 Sa.leh, third deputy prime min-
 ister a.nd minister of develop=
 went, also appears to be deeply
 involved.  Malik, a former a.m-
 ba.ssador to the Soviet Union,

 Murba (Proletarian) Party, usually
 described as the "national Commu-
 nist" party of Indonesia.  With
 Indonesia moving to the left under
 Sukarno, Malik and Saleh have come
 to represent a "moderate" position,
 and their activities, which seem
 oblique to Westerners, are arousing
 the hopeful interest of individuals
 who stand further to the right.
 The "Sukarnoists" base their
 attack on the PKI largely on
 "Pantjasila"--Sukarno's "Five Prin-
 ciples"  to~ which all officially
 recognized. Indonesian political
 parties are obliged to subscribe.
 The new group's ultimate argument--
 which is usually implied rather
 than directly stated--is  that the
 PKI does not sincerely accept Pant-
 jasila but; is pursuing its own ob-
 jectives and insidiously challeng-
 ing Sukarr.~o himself and his asso-
 ciates.
 The Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the
 only large legal Muslim party in
 Indonesia, earlier had withdrawn
 from the Sukarnoist movement but
 apparently now considers it safe
 to join again.  According to Malik,
 an NU official received Sukarno's
 personal consent to "endorse non-
 communist ideas" during a speaking
 tour of East and Central Java.
 Leaders  of:  the right  wing of  the
 National Party have also aligned
 themselve:~ with Sukarnoism.  Malik
 claims that he has the support of
 the lower levels of these political
 parties and of the government bu,-
 reaucracy.  The movement also has
 the backing of a majority of the
 newspapers in Djakarta as well as
 of  -some  papers in Narth Sumatra
 and East ,Java.
 The army until recently had
 carefully avoided supporting the
 movement publicly..  At a recent
 labor conference, however, Army
 Commander General Jani and the
 West Java territorial commander
 made strong statements in behalf
 of Pantjasila, and thereby ap-
 peared to align themselves with
 the Sukarnoists.  Navy Chief of
 Staff Admiral Martadinata and
 Minister of Defense General Na-
 sution have openly encouraged
 Sukarnoism.
 The future of the movement
 nevertheless rests with Sukarno
 himself.  Although the president
 is opposed to divisive political
 tendencies, he is at the same
 time even willing to find effec-
 tive pro.-Sukarno elements that
 can be used in his political bal-
 ancing game.  If he now is con-
 cerned that the PKI is pushing
 too hard, he might be willing to
 overlook for a time the fact that
 there are elements within Sukarno-
 ist ranks whom he distrusts and
 whom he has even considered cast-
 ing into political limbo.
 Another factor in Sukarno's
 mind could be a hope that he can
 use the Sukarnoists in diplomatic
 maneuvering on the Malaysia issue.
 He may even believe they would be
 useful in getting economic assist-
 ance from the West.  Sukarnoist
 spokesmen are urging the US Em-
 bassy in Djakarta to encourage
 UK-Indonesian or Indonesian_Ma-
 laysian talks.  They state that
 unless the Malaysia issue is
 settled peacefully, their movement
 will be smothered in the continu-
 ing anti-Malaysia clamor and that
 efforts to remedy Indonesia's de-
 teriorating economy will fail. Al-
 though the Sukarnoists are not
 necessarily being directed by Su-
 karno to approach the Americans,
 their needs and strategy for the
 moment seem to coincide with his.

 eral Staff chief Sunay warning.
 against further JP criticism of
 the army, has probably not ended,
 but may have passed its most
 critical stage.
 The army's major immediate
 object i?ve may  have  been  to ensure
 the election by the JP of a party
 leader whom the military could
 accept.  In its national conven-

 party did just that, choosing as
 its president-general Suleyman

 candidates and the only one

 is agaiin moving toward the United
 Nations.  The present mandate
 for the UN force stationed on
 the island expires on 26 December,
 and the Security Council is ex-

 three-month period.  However,
 another Cyprus debate is to oc-
 curin this session of the General
 Assembly.  The precise timing is
 uncertain, but it is not likely
 to take place before February.
 Both sides,  meanwhile, are seek-

 came from behind to win by al-
 most a two to one margin. If
 the JP should win next year's
 elections, as now appears likely,
 its president-general would be-
 come Turkey's prime minister.
 Although the army apparently
 has gained its immediate goal
 with regard to the JP, it still
 distrusts the party, which is
 generally regarded as the suc-
 cessor to the defunct Democratic
 Party whose regime the military
 overthrew in 1960. The high com-

 decision favoring the Communist-
 backed plan for a three-man
 council of "independents" might
 have incited strong pressures
 from the traditional parties
 for a reshuffle of the cabinet
 and thereby threatened the Com-

 for further difficulties.
 T:he security situation in
 Sta.nleyville improved during
 the week, according to Tshombd's

 Colonel  Van der  ~Va.lle.   Although

 Elsewhere, Tshombd's lack
 of reliable troops with which
 to garrison captured towns is
 beginning to tell.  Rebels have

 Europe
 T'he heavy loss of seats in
 Italy's local governing councils
 by the Christian Democrats (CD)
 and the Socialists (PSI) in last
 week's provincial and municipal
 elections has created an immedi-
 ate ;problem in a number of key
 cities, where center-left ma-
 jorities cannot be mustered to
 regroup local administrations.
 The political effects on CD-
 PSI cooperation on the national
 scale, however, could far ex-
 ceed the local significance.
 The Communist gain of many
 council seats carries with it
 considerable benefit in terms
 of local patronage and propa-
 ganda opportunities, and  the
 party's chances for upsetting
 the coalition government have
 been somewhat improved.
 In such major cities as
 Milan, Florence, Naples, and
 Genoa the only solution will
 probably be to set up care-
 taker governments under a com-
 missioner pending new elections.
 In other cities the CD will ex-
 ert ;pressure on the PSI not to
 ally with the Communists.  Else-
 where, all three of the CD's
 coalition partners will try
 either to prevent it from
 forming all-CD administrations,
 or to block CD efforts to align
 with the conservative Liberal
 Party.
 A principal effect on the
 national coalition will be that
 both the CD and t;he PSI will
 adopt more rigid bargaining po-
 sitions on a number of important
 issues which must soon be faced.
 PSI chief Nenni will be intent
 on controlling dissatisfaction
 within his party over heavy
 losses mainly to the Socialist
 splinter party (PSIUP).  He
 will want the coalition to show
 some progress on its reform pro-
 grams in time for him to counter
 an increase in left-wing strength
 in the elections for the PSI
 congress, planned for February
 or March.
 The CD can take some com-
 fort from its increase this time
 in percent of the municipal vote
 as compared with the total vote
 in last year's parliamentary
 elections (see table on facing
 page).  The party reaffirmed
 the validity of the center-left
 concept at the CD congress in
 September and during the elec-
 toral campaign.  However, fac-
 tional differences over the
 nature and scope of the coali-
 tion's course have not been re-
 solved.  Elements in the party
 who oppose the center-left and
 its program will probably be

 POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE DOMINICAN STRIKE
 Th.e Dominican Government
 appears to be winning its bat-
 tle to thwart a general strike
 that was to have begun in Santo
 Domingo on 2 December, despite
 support for the walkout from op-
 portunistic politicians of both
 the right  and  left .
 BY
 ~nc~~day,  how-
 ever, only a few taxi-drivers
 had joined sugar workers in wa lk-
 ing off' their jobs.
 TYie strike, which has been
 relatively free from violence,
 brought: a quick response from
 the ru7Ling triumvirate.  Troops
 and naf;ional police were alerted
 in Sani;o Domingo, and strike
 leader; and agitators were ar-
 rested.,  Triumvirate President
 Donald Reid Cabral undercut some
 of the support for the strike by
 announcing that, despite the gov-
 ernrnenit's financial difficulties,
 part of the traditional Christmas
 bonus would be paid to public
 employees.
 Wl1at  started out  as  a  pro-
 test by irresponsible leftist
 unions against the government's
 refusal to pay sugar workers a
 harvest bonus was quickly seized
 by political interests which
 hope to topple the Reid Cabral
 regime.  An unlikely coalition
 of ex-President Bosch's Domini-
 can Revolutionary Party, ex-
 President Balaguer's Reformist
 Party, the right.-wing Liberal
 Evolutionist Party, and the left-
 ist Revolutionary Social Chris-
 tian Party appeared to be collab-
 orating in support of the strike.
 Communist elements, which
 have been relatively inactive
 for several months, also eagerly
 joined the strike efforts.  On
 27 November two bombs were ex-
 ploded in Santo Domingo
 A day later the home of
 et minister was machine-
 gunned.
 For the moment, Reid's po-
 sition appears reasonably secure
 despite the dissident army fac-
 tion, since he has the support
 of key elements of the military.

 Argentina:  The threat of
 passi  y vio ent demonstrations
 in Argentina in support of Juan
 Peron's return was averted on
 2 December when Brazil forced
 the e~x-dictator to go back to
 Madrid on the same day he ar-
 rivecl in Rio.  The Argentine
 mi.lit:ary, standing firmly be-
 hind the Illia administration,
 adamantly oppose Peron's return
 and were ready to aid the po-
 lice to quell any internal dis-
 turbances..
 Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay
 --in addition to Brazil--had all
 finally indicated willingness to
 assist the Argentine Government
 in preventing Peron's return. Such
 evidence of international support
 may tend to strengthen the inter-
 nal position of the Tllia adminis-
 tration.  Brazil's action will not
 only enhance its standing in Ar-
 gentine eyes but may also improve
 its position in Uruguay, where it  25X1
 has been trying to persuade the
 government to curb the activities
 of Brazilian exiles.

 Etrazilian President Cas-
 tello Branco's order imposing
 federal intervention in Goias
 State and Congress' approval of
 the decree have reduced tensions
 raised) by the prolonged efforts
 of military "hard-liners" to
 oust Governor Mauro Borges.
 Under the presidential decree,
 which became effective on 26
 Novemk-er, Borges has been re-
 moved from office and replaced
 by a i'ederal "interventor," who
 will administer the state gov-
 ernmerit for a maximum of 60
 days.
 7'he  President  justified
 his action against Borges by
 public;ly charging him with sub-
 version and involvement in a
 Communist-inspired plot to over-
 throw the federal government
 by  fox?ce.   While  it  is  not  clear
 that i;he latter charge can be
 proved, there seems to be con-
 sidera ble evidence that Borges
 tolerated Communist infiltra-
 tion i.n his own administration,
 collaborated with "agents" of
 a  Communist  bloc embassy,  and
 permii:ted armed groups of ex-
 tremists to operate in Goias.
 Borger' fate is in doubt, but
 presumably he will remain free
 as long as his party's majority
 in thca state legislature pre-
 vents his formal impeachment--
 wh:ich would allow his case to
 be tried in a military court.
 In connection with Borges'
 ouster, the army arrested more
 than 200 persons in Goias and
 elsewhere for allegedly prepar-
 ing to launch a "counterrevolu-
 tion."                         ~
 Despite some unfavorable
 criticism of his handling of the
 Goias affair, Castello Branco
 probably has not incurred any
 significant damage to his polit-
 ical control.  The 52-vote margin
 in the Federal Chamber of Dep-
 uties supporting the interven-
 tion is a substantial show of
 confidence, considering that ad-
 ministration supporters hold
 less than one third of the 409
 chamber seats.  In the senate,
 the government's action received
 overwhelming approval.
 Castello Branco, anxious
 to prevent further political
 interruptions of his efforts in
 the fields of economic develop-
 ment and social reform, will
 probably now seek to persuade
 the military "hard-liners" to mod-
 erate their tactics in any future
 cases.  These elements, however,
 may be encouraged by their vic-
 tory in Goias to go after other
 political targets.
