 Situation Report
 Internal order and security in Iran continue to de-
 teriorate.   It is clear that the government is now being
 chaZZeng    from the Left and apparently from the right
 as well.
 On the left, the principal source of opposition is
 the Marxist terrorist group, the Chariks, who appear de-
 termined to destabilize the Bazargan government as rapidly
 as possible.   They apparently organized the attacks on
 the US and Israeli Embassies and on the National Iranian
 r-              I
 Radio and Television headquarters.
 25X1
 While government forces have generally prevailed in
 these instances, for some days there have been indica-
 tions that Khomeini and Bazargan are worried about their
 ability to control leftist elements and strikers.   The
 government appears unprepared to initiate a showdown with
 the Chariks   and to be tolerating some of their
 activities.
 The disarray in the government itself is a factor
 hampering Bazargan and Khomeini in their efforts to meet
 the threat posed by the Chariks.   Both of them are issuing
 orders without assurance that they will be carried out.
 The next test comes tomorrow:   Khomeini has appealed to
 all workers to return to their jobs; the responses will
 provide an indication of his influence.                        25X1
 believes there may be Charik sup-
 porters on t e work committees who will use intimidation
 tactics in their efforts to continue the present economic
 paralysis.
 On the right, pro-Shah forces, possibly including
 some military units in the city of Tabriz, are resisting
 the government.   There is considerable street fighting in
 Tabriz, but little indication of the identity of the rival
 groups.   Separatist ethnic groups also appear to be trying
 to take advantage of the situation--Azarbai'anis around
 Tabriz and Baluchis in the southeast.                              25X1

 App
 It appears that the key to the Bazargan government's
 effort to restore order is its ability to secure the ac-
 tive support of units of the Iranian military.                  Unless
 Barzargan and Khomeini are willing to use military force
 to put down the various dissident factions roaming the
 streets of Iranian cities it is unlikely that any    m-
 blance of order can be restored soon.
 The new Chief of the Supreme Commander's staff,
 Major General Qarani, yesterday appealed for all absent
 military personnel to return to their units.   Qarani's
 effectiveness is a question mark; he has been out of the
 military since 1958.F--          1
 We have little solid information as to the likeli-
 hood of military responsiveness to any leadership at
 this time.   The government yesterday appointed Lieutenant
 General Abdollah Azarbarzin as Air Force Commander.
 Lieutenant General Mehdiyn, who had been appointed earlier
 this week, apparently was not a popular choice.   Never-
 theless, the appointment of Azarbarzin, formerly second
 in command of the Air Force, reportedly is not favored
 by Air Force technicians  (homofars) who are supporting
 the Bazargan government in such important ways as   ward-
 ing the airport and the Prime Ministry.
 It is difficult to forecast at this time if the
 situation has reached the lowest point or whether condi-
 tions will deteriorate further, even to the point of
 jeopardizing Khomeini and Bazargan. F77        I

 BRIEFS AND COMMENTS
 OPEC:   Crude Oil Price Increase
 The decision by Abu Dhabi and Qatar to increase the
 official price of their light crudes by about $1 per bar-
 rel will probably be followed by other members of the Or-
 ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Abu Dhabi
 officials have indicated that the new price structure is
 an "interim step" that might be rescinded if market con-
 ditions ease.   Unless Iranian production is stepped up     25X1
 or consumption is significantly restrained,  however,  up-
 ward market pressure on prices will continue even i
 other producers continue near maximum production.
 The latest increase is in addition to previously an-
 nounced price hikes that ranged up to 6.4 percent over
 fourth quarter 1978 levels.   The new price schedule calls
 for an average 1979 increase of about 18 percent, with     25X1
 prices for some crudes to be raised by up to about 24
 percent.   The official OPEC increases currently call for
 a 14.5-percent increase by yearend and an average increase
 r-                 I
 of about 10 percent for all of 1979.
 Spot prices for crude have been running well above
 official prices.   Recent spot sales of Abu Dhabi and
 Qatari crudes have been $4 to $6 per barrel above the
 original first quarter official prices.   Premiums of
 this magnitude can only spur further price increases
 throughout OPEC.

 CHAD:   Deteriorating Military Situation
 //The military situation in Ndjamena is deteriorat-
 ing rapidly following the resumption of hostilities yes-
 terday between supporters of President MaZZoum and Muslim
 25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 A high-level Sudanese mediation team
 is reportedly on its way to Ndjamena; but the Prime
 Minister is unlikely to cooperate and almost certainly
 will press for a complete takeover of the city.
 25X1
 The French have begun a limited evacuation to Gabon
 and have agreed to transport American and European de-
 pendents if requested.   Thus far, American personnel are
 safe, but the Embassy has been instructed to begin evacu-
 ating all US private citizens.   Paris has also sent mili-
 tary reinforcements to Ndjamena to bolster security around
 the airport and European residential areas; French troops,
 however, are continuing to avoid involvement in the
 25X1     fighting.
 25X1
 25X1
 If Habre does take over the city, he may try to form
 a coalition with southern Christian tribes that have long
 resented political domination by Malloum and his predeces-
 sors.   Habre may also be willing to negotiate with the
 various Muslim insurgent groups that he led until late
 1977. His efforts to reach an agreement with the rebels
 may be complicated by his limited support and assertions
 by some guerrilla leaders that he sold out when he joined
 Malloum's government last August.   The rebels, perhaps
 with the encouragement of their Libyan backers, may try
 to take advantage of the situation in the ca it al to
 make their own move against the government.

 SOUTH KOREA - NORTH KOREA:   Meeting

 South Korea meet publicly tomorrow at Panmunjom to ad-

 changes between Seoul and Pyongyang since President Pak

 The North,  speaking through a nongovernmental front or-
 ganization, has outlined a series of measures that would
 culminate in an "all-nation" conference,  including South
 Korean opposition groups,  later this year.   The South
 in turn has insisted that government authorities should

 INTERNATIONAL:   Wheat Negotiations Fail
 The collapse of negotiations on a new international
 wheat agreement this week ends for at least a year any
 chance of stabilizing the market and providing assurance
 to the poorer developing countries that they will have
 adequate wheat supplies.   The 70-nation conference failed
 for the third time to agree on two key issues--the size
 of reserve stocks and the trigger prices that would  ov-
 ern accumulation and release of stocks.
 The European Community and the US finally compro-
 mised on prices last week, but the Third World rejected
 these prices as too high.   In addition,  commitments by
 members to the buffer stock fell far short of the 25- to
 30-million-ton level the US considered essential for a
 workable agreement.   The conference extended the 1971
 wheat agreement--with no economic provision    o influence
 prices--through June 1980.
 Failure to obtain a new wheat agreement will hurt
 the poorer nations in the long run.   A new agreement
 would have provided for doubling the food-aid stock level
 to 10 million tons.   While wheat supplies in world mar-
 kets are currently good and prices modest,  this situa-
 tion could be reversed within two years.   Major wheat
 exporters will be under domestic pressures to implement
 policies that cut the size of their carryover stocks and
 maintain higher farm prices, at the expense of w  ld
 food security considerations. F77       I

 NETHERLANDS:   Debate on Nuclear Policy
 //The Dutch Government's recent decision to endorse
 construction of a URENCO-sponsored uranium enrichment
 facility in Gronau,  West Germany,  has rekindled the de-
 bate over nuclear energy in the Netherlands.   The oppo-
 sition has introduced a resolution in Parliament that
 would sharply restrict the government's authority on in-
 ternational nuclear questions.   If it passes,        as seems
 likely,  the resolution would further confuse the direc-
 tion of Dutch nuclear policy and complicate relations be-
 tween the Dutch and their British and West German part-
 ners in URENCO.//
 25X1
 //The British and West Germans,  annoyed by years of
 Dutch ambivalence on joint nuclear issues, refused to
 agree formally to the conditions the Dutch Parliament
 wanted settled before the government approved the Gronau
 facility--extension of the URENCO Treaty until 1981 and
 clarification of URENCO export policies.   The govern-        25X1
 ment's approval of Gronau without having secured these
 concessions has angered many legislators--includin   some
 of Prime Minister van Agt's Christian Democrats.//
 //The government believes Parliament has neither the
 technical expertise nor the political competence to be-
 come involved in the intricacies of nuclear policy.                                   The
 resolution proposed by the opposition Labor Party, how-
 ever, would require the government to consult parliament
 before it makes binding decisions on URENCO's export
 policies.   It is a direct challenge to van Agt's author-
 ity in the nuclear field.//                                           25X1
 //If it passes,  the resolution--combined with the al-
 ready significant antinuclear agitation in the country--
 would add to the already pronounced confusion in the
 formulation of Dutch nuclear policy.   It would complicate
 relations with the UK and West Germany and might jeopard-
 ize future Dutch participation in URENCO.   Increased
 parliamentary involvement in the formulation of Dutch
 nuclear policy could eventually complicate Dutch partici-
 pation in EURATOM and NATO's nuclear weapons programs.//

 BANGLADESH:   Parliamentary Election
 On Sunday, voters in Bangladesh will choose 300 Par-
 liament members in what seems likely to be a relatively
 fair election.   More than 2,000 candidates from 55
 parties are contesting the election.   President Ziaur
 Rahman should be able to form a government from the
 ideologically moderate parties willing to support him
 even if his own Bangladesh National Party does not win a
 majority of the seats.   Since the presidency is inde-
 pendent of the Parliament,  Zia--elected by a landslide
 last June--will remain in power regardless of the result
 on Sunday.   Violence could erupt after the election, how-
 ever,  if the major opposition party charges that the vote
 was rigged.

 FRANCE:   Steel Strike
 25X1
 French steel workers will hold a one-day strike
 today to protest a government revamping of the steel in-
 dustry that will entail the loss of over 20,000 jobs.
 The six major labor federations in Lorraine, heart of the
 ailing steel industry, have organized a "march on Paris"
 to demonstrate their strength and try to get the govern-
 ment to back down or at least postpone the layoffs.   Rep-
 resentatives of the unions are due to meet with Industry
 Minister Giraud on Tuesday, but Giraud has already said
 that the government has no intention of modifying its
 plans.   The government has announced its willingness to
 discuss and implement measures to ameliorate the social
 problems posed by its policies, but the unions have so
 far found these measures inadequate.   The government's       25X1
 evident determination to continue its policy of economic
 rationalization almost certainly means continued conk
 frontation in the steel sector and other industries.

 The Chinese buildup along the Vietnamese border and
 the defensive measures being taken along the Soviet fron-
 tier amply demonstrate the seriousness of Beijing's prep-
 arations for an attack on Vietnam.   The following is a
 speculative assessment of a complementary political
 strategy that Beijing may be developing--a strategy
 which could affect the timin    nature   and likelihood of
 any Chinese military action.
 during his recent trip
 to the CS and Japan, vice Premier Deng Xiaoping force-
 fully staked out China's rationale for strong action
 against Vietnam.   Deng termed Vietnam the "Cuba of the
 East" and argued that if Vietnam is not "taught a lesson"
 it will continue to act as the surrogate for Soviet ex-
 pansionism in East Asia.
 Beijing now finds itself hoist by its own petard.
 Over the past several years, it has consistently crit-
 icized the West, and especially the US,  for failing to
 take a stronger stand against growing Soviet influence
 in areas where China is in no position to intervene ef-
 fectively.   Beijing now face-s what it sees as a classic
 example of Soviet encroachment in the one region where
 Chinese military power can be brought to bear.   The Chi-
 nese no doubt reckon that failure to respond strongly
 would badly undermine their argument for Western action
 against Soviet inroads.   In short, the need to back up
 their words with action seems to be impelling China toward
 military moves against Vietnam, despite substantial risks
 and costs that the Chinese openly acknowledge.
 While a Chinese limited military action would be
 sure to complicate Hanoi's position in Kampuchea, it is
 by itself unlikely to restore the "equilibrium" mentioned
 by Deng.   A political strategy--clearly linked to the
 threat of force but also holding out the possibility of
 a peaceful resolution of the Kampuchean situation--would

 seem to be required if the Chinese are serious about at-
 tempting to redress the balance in Indochina.   The Chi-
 nese indeed appear to be developing such a political
 strategy, centered on Prince Sihanouk and a new Kampuchean
 "united front," that could affect both the timing and na-
 ture of Chinese military action against Vietnam.   If suc-
 cessful,                              it could lead Beijing to forego the large-scale
 militar     tion against Vietnam that it seems to be pre-
 paring.                              ac
 A People's DaiZy editorial on Saturday strongly sug-
 gested such an approach by calling for a union of "all
 patriotic classes,  social strata and political forces"
 in Kampuchea.   Sihanouk's ceremonious return to Beijing
 earlier this week could set the stage for creation of a   25X1
 new Kampuchean political structure that would disavow
 the harsh domestic policies of the Pol Pot regime and ap-
 peal for international support.
 In removing or at least effectively submerging Pol
 Pot, the Chinese would at least rid themselves of a ma-
 jor propaganda and political liability.   Certainly any
 Chinese military action against Vietnam that would seem
 to be aimed at restoring the Pol Pot government would re-
 ceive little if any international support or understand-
 ing.
 The Chinese, however, may be positioning themselves
 for a more ambitious political move.   Beijing could, for
 example,  formally endorse and advance Sihanouk's earlier
 call for an international conference on Kampuchea, per-
 haps linking this with a call for a Vietnamese military
 withdrawal.   Beijing could make clear that it is not de-
 manding the restoration of the Pol Pot regime but the
 negotiation of a genuine coalition government headed by
 Sihanouk,  "the undisputed representative of the Kampu-
 chean people," and including members of the present         25X1
 Vietnamese-supported government in Phnom Penh.   Implicit
 in any such proposal would be the threat of Chinese mili-
 tary force should Hanoi reject the proposition.
 Such a Chinese initiative would be certain to receive
 broad international support.   Hanoi, which has been
 attempting to improve its image by playing up the Chinese
 threat, would be in a difficult position.   Vietnam
 might feel it could ill afford to reject such a proposal

 Beijing, for its part, has reason to believe that
 the developing situation in Kampuchea could work to its
 favor.   It now seems clear that an effective anti-Viet-
 namese resistance has taken hold in Kampuchea and that
 China can continue to supply it and foster its growth,
 thus involving Vietnam in a protracted guerrilla war.
 Chinese Foreign Ministry guidance to officials abroad in
 fact has reflected such an assessment and suggested that
 Vietnam's Kampuchean quagmire makes direct Chinese "pun-
 ishment" of Vietnam less necessary.   National People's
 Congress Vice Chairman Tan Zhenlin yesterday noted Viet-
 nam's difficulties in Kampuchea and signaled China's
 interest in a "compromise" during discussions with a
 The possibility of such a Chinese political ploy is
 intriguing; its chances of success, of course, are highly
 problematical.   At this point, Sihanouk appears com-
 pletely unwilling to cooperate with Pol Pot in any
 united front arrangement.   Thus, Pol Pot's continued
 role as leader of the Kampuchean resistance remains a ma-
 jor obstacle in advancing a call for negotiations.   In
 order to reach a political solution, Vietnamese interests
 would have to be squarely taken into account.   An indef-
 inite Vietnamese military presence east of the Mekong
 and a major role for Hanoi's Khmer clients in any new
 coalition government might be required.   Such concessions
 could prove un                   China or its Kampuchean al-
 lies.
 China nevertheless may reason that it has little to
 lose in advancing such a proposition.   Categorical re-
 jection by Hanoi would further isolate the Vietnamese and
 create a better political environment for Chinese m'li
 tary action against Vietnam.

 In short, some variant of a proposal holding out
 hope for a political solution would complement rather
 than conflict with China's ongoing military preparations
 along the Vietnamese frontier.   Beijing could even choose
 to move militarily against Vietnam before making its bid
 for a political settlement.   The Chinese could occupy
 Vietnamese territory--at the risk of a Soviet response--
 then link their withdrawal with Vietnamese withdrawal
 from Kampuchea and acceptance of negotiations on a new
 coalition government there.   Alternatively, China could
 make its military action contingent on Vietnam's response
 to a call for a political settlement.   In any case, a
 carrot-and-stick military-political strategy has been
 highly characteristic of Chinese policy in the past.
 While Chinese forces remain in position to strike at
 Vietnam at any time, Beijing may engage in more politi-
 cal orchestration before reaching a final decision on
 military moves.                                              25X1
