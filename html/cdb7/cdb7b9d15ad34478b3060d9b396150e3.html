 The lifting of martial law

 no real improvement in the se-

 The new rightist-oriented

 session next April--lacks the
 balance of forces Premier de
 Gaulle desired, and may serious-
 ly curtail his freedom of ma-
 neuver in seeking an early so-
 lution to France's principal
 problem--Algeria.   De Gaulle
 is expected to be elected presi-
 dent on 21 December and to ap-
 point a new premier  shortly
 thereafter.   With his prestige
 at a new high and his power to
 govern by decree extending for
 some time, he may try to move
 rapidly toward the comparatively
 liberal solution he is assumed
 to favor.
 Information Minister Jacques
 Soustelle's Union of the New
 Republic   (UNR),    which has
 emerged as the strongest party
 in France, will be an unknown
 quantity until its real posi-
 tion in the assembly and its
 degree of cohesiveness are de-
 termined.   United only by unde-
 fined "Gaullism," the UNR is

 treme rightist fringe. The par-
 ty apparently has attracted
 votes from all parties includ-

 sorbed the Poujadist movement
 practically entirely.
 The election results were
 far from a clear mandate for
 the integration of Algeria with
 France, but they will be inter-
 preted as such; De Gaulle's
 problem will be to decide how
 far he can go in disregarding
 this view.   Although the UNR
 is pledged to support the pre-
 mier's policies, Soustelle im-
 mediately hailed the election
 as a victory for "French Algeria."
 This view is presumably shared
 by most of the 71 deputies from
 Algeria and the Sahara,  where
 only a few victorious Socialists
 in Algeria may deviate from the
 prointegration program advocated
 by the army and the European
 settlers.   Most of the 132 In-

 CURRENT. INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 December ? 1958
 De Gaulle should be able
 to divert some of the national-
 istic criticism of any moves
 he makes toward a comparatively
 liberal Algerian solution by
 pushing other programs popular
 with the nationalists.  These
 include his efforts to enhance
 France's international prestige
 by demanding equality with the
 United States and Britain in
 coordinating global policies,
 to press for a national nuclear-
 weapons program, and even to
 call for further European in-
 tegration under French leader-
 ship.  De Gaulle can also divide
 the rightists on economic and
 social policies, since truly
 Gaullist elements of the UNR
 will be inclined to join forces
 with the Socialists and Popular
 Republicans on such matters
 rather than with the economical-
 ly and socially conservative
 Independents.
 The Socialists, smarting

 the foreign minister level.  In
 his 2 December interview with
 Premier Khrushchev, Senator
 Humphrey gained the impression
 that Moscow is willing to make
 some concessions in order to
 reach some kind of agreement
 for nuclear test cessation.
 However, the Soviet leader gave
 the impression he does not an-
 ticipate agreement on measures
 to prevent surprise attack.
 Nuclear Test Cessation Talks
 On 29 November the Soviet
 delegate introduced a declara-
 tion stressing the "merits" of
 the Soviet position and accusing
 the West of evading an agree-
 ment by insisting on detailed
 discussion of a control system.
 After listing four major points
 in the Western position which
 "cast doubt on the successful
 completion" of the talks,  the
 Soviet declaration stated that
 the USSR would not object to
 the inclusion of "basic provi-
 sions on control" in a treaty
 on the cessation of tests.
 This ostensible concession was
 intended to remove a weak point
 in the Soviet position--the
 vague relationship between the
 Soviet-proposed treaty and a
 protocol on controls.
 On 1 December the Soviet
 delegate clarified the declara-
 tion,  stating that although he
 would prefer to have the treaty
 and control provisions embodied
 in two separate documents,  he
 was prepared to accede to West-
 ern insistence on one document.
 The Soviet delegate objected
 to the article in the American
 draft agreement requiring the
 parties to pledge prompt and
 full cooperation with a  nuclear
 weapons test control organiza-
 tion on the grounds that the
 American concept would create
 an international organization
 not under control of the three
 nuclear powers.
 On 3 December the Soviet
 delegate retreated from the
 recommendations made by the ex-
 perts at Geneva last summer for
 a world-wide inspection system,
 alleging that the technical
 talks at that time did not
 examine the question of whether
 an "entire" system was needed.
 He is now insisting that any
 control organization be limited
 to the three nuclear powers,
 with decisions based on unan-
 imous agreement.  This, in ef-
 fect, would provide Moscow with
 a veto over all actions of the
 organization.
 It is apparent from his
 further comments that the Soviet
 delegate is particularly in-
 terested in his government's
 veto power over decisions in-
 volving inspection of any sus-
 pected violation.  He insisted
 that inspection be performed
 by ad hoc groups formed- only
 after receipt of evidence from
 which the organization "decides"
 there is a "strong suspicion"
 of a nuclear explosion.  He
 then contended that a system
 confined to the territorial
 possessions of the three nuclear
 powers and to the oceans would
 be adequate at present, since
 this would cover 80 percent of
 the territory of the world, and
 "100 percent of that of the
 nuclear powers."
 The agreement to embody
 all commitments in one document
 is a concession in form only and
 does not alter the basic Soviet
 position that an agreed draft
 of a permanent and unconditional
 test cessation agreement with
 only the briefest reference to
 controls must precede discussion
 of the details of the control
 system.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY  SUMMARY
 Surprise-Attack Talks
 On 28 November the Soviet
 delegate introduced a declara-
 tion which spelled out bloc
 proposals linking "concrete
 measures" to reduce the danger
 of surprise attack with specif-
 ic disarmament measures.   The
 Czech delegate followed with
 a draft agreement along the
 same lines.   Both documents re-
 stated with minor variations
 long-standing Soviet proposals
 for ground control posts and
 aerial photography to be ac-
 companied by such "concrete"
 disarmament measures as reduc-
 tion of foreign forces in
 Europe by one third and denucle-
 arization of both parts of
 Germany.
 For the first time,  Moscow
 set forth its views on the num-
 ber and general location of
 control posts at railroad junc-
 tions, major ports, and high-
 ways.   According to the decla-
 ration,  28 control posts should
 be located on the territories
 of members of the Warsaw Treaty,
 including six in the USSR, and
 54 posts in NATO and Baghdad

 Pact countries, including six
 in the United States.  These
 totals were said to be based
 on the density of population
 and communications networks.
 In addition to Moscow's
 standard proposal for aerial
 photography in a zone 500 miles
 on either side of the demarca-
 tion line in Europe,  the Geneva
 declaration for the first time
 extended aerial inspection to
 Greece, Turkey,  Iran,  Japan,
 and Okinawa.   Aerial inspec-
 tion zones in the Soviet Far
 East and the western United
 States were made conditional
 on the establishment of both
 ground control posts and aerial
 photography zones  in Europe
 and the Middle East.
 This omnibus plan linking
 inspection systems with specific
 disarmament steps is designed
 to sharpen the contrast between
 the bloc's demand for "practical"
 measures to prevent surprise
 attack with Western insistence
 on a careful technical study of  25X1
 the problem, avoiding political
 issues posed by the Soviet dis-
 armament proposals.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 December 1958
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 AFRO-ASIAN ECONOMIC CONFERENCE
 The widely heralded Afro-
 Asian Economic Conference, to
 be held in Cairo from 8 to 11
 December, will provide a major
 forum for Soviet and Egyptian
 anti-Western propaganda.  Al-
 though the purpose of the meet-
 ing is to search for ways to in-
 crease foreign trade and eco-
 nomic cooperation among Asian-
 African countries, significant
 progress along these lines ap-
 pears unlikely.   The Soviet Un-
 ion probably will use the con-
 ference to reiterate its pledge,
 "tell us what you need, we can
 help you," which was given at
 the Afro-Asian Solidarity Con-
 ference held in Cairo last year.
 Moscow. probably will attempt to
 gain maximum benefit from its
 Aswan High Dam aid agreement.
 UAR leaders have expressed
 concern over what they describe
 as the eventual "evils" of the
 European Common Market.   Nasir
 believes the Common Market will
 result in discrimination against
 Egyptian goods and higher prices
 for European goods.   The   UAR
 leaders may therefore attempt to
 push plans for an Arab "common
 market" scheme to counter alleged
 Western economic imperialism.
 Iraq, which in previous
 Arab meetings has been a restrain-
 ing influence on such Egyptian
 maneuvers, reportedly will rec-
 ommend the creation of a "big
 Asian-African economic organiza-
 tion" which would establish trade
 centers for principal products
 of the area.   Baghdad has al-
 ready called for the establish-
 ment of a rice center in Commu-
 nist China and a cotton center
 in Egypt.
 While Cairo claims that in-
 vitations have been sent to "194
 economic organizations in 101
 Afro-Asian countries," a sub-
 stantially smaller number of
 countries are likely to be rep-
 resented.  Communist China, Mon-
 golia, North Vietnam, North Ko-
 rea, and the Soviet Union will-
 send delegates.  Although many
 countries are sending legitimate
 Chamber of Commerce representa-
 tives, the meeting will be domi-
 nated by Egyptians, Russians,
 and fellow travelers.
 Because the problems of
 establishing meaningful rela-
 tionships among these underde-
 veloped areas are so complex,
 the conference probably will
 concentrate on setting up perma-
 nent planning bodies rather than
 announcing immediate solutions.

 AFRICA AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY
 The current visit to Afri-
 ca's east coast of a delegation
 from the Commission of the Euro-
 pean Economic Community (EEC)
 could be significant for Western
 Europe's future relations with
 the African continent as a whole.
 The mission, headed by Director
 General for Overseas Territories
 Helmut Allardt, will be the first
 real sounding of local sentiment

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Common Market members might
 be jeopardized.    On the other
 hand, a position of relative in-
 dependence is probably essential
 if the EEC is to gain wide-
 spread acceptance in Africa
 and develop as an important
 funnel for Western economic
 and technical assistance to the
 Africans.
 PAKISTANI REGIME BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS
 Pakistan's military regime
 has begun to implement its prom-
 ises of political and economic
 reform.    The government's pres-
 tige depends largely on its
 ability to provide the country
 with substantial evidence of
 progress, particularly in agri-
 culture.                     It is already encoun-
 tering opposition from large
 landowners and the business
 community.
 Politically, the new regime
 has consolidated its control of
 the government and withdrawn the
 army from most local martial-law
 administration.   Among its many
 new measures, it has delegated
 extensive administrative author-
 ity to government units below
 the provincial level,  apparently
 to forestall renewed demands for
 provincial autonomy,- along lin-
 guistic lines.   It has also taken
 strong measures to eliminate
 corruption in public and business
 life.
 To strengthen the economy,
 highest priority apparently is
 being given to raising agricul-
 tural production.   However, gov-
 ernment land reform proposals
 may have important political re-
 percussions if they threaten the
 position of the powerful land-
 lord class.   Owners of large
 estates are already trying to
 obtain the highest possible com-
 pensation for lands they may
 lose.   Plans being prepared by
 the Land Reforms Commission to
 prevent uneconomic fragmenta-
 tion of productive lands are
 being attacked as "un-Islamic"
 because they contravene Islamic
 inheritance laws.   In the face
 of this opposition, the reforms
 finally implemented by the gov-
 ernment may be less substantial
 than originally hoped.
 Although the public has
 welcomed the regime's initial
 efforts to reduce prices, the
 Planning Commission and some
 civilian government officials
 are emphasizing the dangers of
 the regime's price-control pro-
 posals.   These, they hold, may
 destroy the incentive of pro-
 ducers and discourage badly need-
 ed new investment.
 Should the army submit
 to pressures from large land-
 owners and industrialists and
 modify previously announced
 policies,  popular disillusion-
 ment could build up rapidly and
 weaken the government's position.
 In addition to its econom-
 ic and political activities,
 the military regime is pressing
 for further modernization of
 Pakistan's armed forces.   Prob-
 ably partly to test Western
 attitudes toward the new regime
 and American intentions regarding
 future military aid, Ayub's
 government has requested F-100
 fighters from the United States

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The five-party coalition
 government of Karl August Fag-
 erholm resigned on 4 December
 as a result of Soviet pressure.
 Moscow intensified its
 two-month-old campaign against
 Finland last week by canceling
 orders from several large Fin-
 nish firms and by refusing re-
 quests for additional shipments
 of crude oil.  The Finns, in an
 effort to reduce this year's
 trade imbalance with the USSR,
 had attempted to purchase So-
 viet oil for stockpiling--a
 measure which would only tem-
 porarily have alleviated the
 large trade credit balance now
 held by Finland.  By its re-
 fusal, Moscow is seeking a
 firmer orientation of Finland's
 trade with the USSR.  Cancel-
 lation of orders and postpone-
 ment of advance payments total
 nearly $6,000,000, according
 to the Finnish Foreign Ministry.
 As a result, unemployment has
 been increasing sharply.
 Fagerholm quit following
 the resignation of the five
 Agrarian cabinet ministers.
 The Agrarian party leaders have
 been insisting on the necessity
 of thoroughgoing changes.  Un-
 til a new government is formed,
 Prime Minister Fagerhoim will
 also act as foreign minister.
 In his search for a gov-
 ernment with which the USSR X11_
 deal, President Kekko-
 nen is'said to favor
 one composed of all
 non-Communist par-
 ties but the "regu-
 lar" Social Demo-
 crats, some of whose
 leaders are particu-
 larly disliked by
 the USSR.  The regu-
 lar Social Democrats
 would be replaced by
 the opposition Social
 Democrats, who were
 expelled from the par-
 ty on 29 November.
 This formalization of the
 split in the Social Democratic
 party will have widespread
 political repercussions and
 could lead to Communist domi-
 nation of the Finnish trade
 union movement through a paral-
 lel split in the Confederation
 of Labor (SAK).    The opposi-
 tion Social Democrats control
 SAK, but the regular Social
 Democrats have already formed
 a rival organization--the
 "Joint Organization of Trade
 Unions."
 Kekkonen  and  the  other
 Finnish leaders  probably
 hope  to  satisfy  the  USSR
 without   including  the Com-
 munist-front                                                                        Finnish People's

 excluded.    Pravda  has quoted
 the  Finnish   Communist  press
 to  the effect  that  only

 ment  based  on                                                            "the  working

 their  strongest  position
 since  1948  to   demand  in-
 clusion  in                                                                the  government

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 December 1958
 BULGARIA'S NEW ECONOMIC PROGRAM
 Bulgarian party chief Zhiv-
 kov, speaking at the central
 committee plenum last month,
 called for a"great leap for-
 ward" in economic development,
 making even more unrealistic
 demands on agriculture than
 the decision in October to ful-
 fill the present five-year plan
 (1958-62) ahead of schedule.
 The primary means to be
 employed for reaching the new
 targets--mobilization of the
 masses, day and night operation
 of equipment, and economies in
 the use of raw materials--sug-
 gest that the concept of a "leap'
 forward" will be used propagan-
 distically to wring the maximum
 output from production facili-
 ties.   Although using Chinese
 Communist terminology, the ap-
 peal is probably inspired by
 the USSR's recently published
 Seven-Year Plan.  In presenting
 this plan Khrushchev pointed
 out that the next  few years
 will be decisive in the strug-
 gle between Communism and capi-
 talism.
 The Bulgarians are proud
 their steadfast adherence to
 orthodox methods has brought
 acknowledgment in bloc publi-
 cations that their country is
 the most advanced of the "peo-
 ple's democracies" in "building
 socialism,"and they have clearly
 taken a cue from Khrushchev's
 prediction and have launched
 an ambitious program of their
 own in order to retain their
 leading position.
 Zhivkov calls on agricul-
 ture to double 1958 production
 next year and triple`it in 1960,
 an apparently impossible achieve-
 ment.           In recent years, gross
 agricultural output  has  de-
 creased from the previous year's

 level as often as it has risen,
 and the five-year plan scheduled
 only a 35-percent increase.
 The agricultural sector is
 to concentrate on irrigation,
 other land improvements, and
 construction--relying heavily
 on the labor and means of the
 collective farms, which are ,
 now being enlarged by mergers.
 These mergers apparently entail
 the transfer of some production
 activities of the villages to
 the enlarged farms in order to
 process part of the produce on
 the spot.   The  mergers,; will
 necessitate a reorganization of
 district party organs, and the
 Bulgarian press  has  stated
 there will be only one village
 council for each enlarged farm.
 Citing Chinese Communist  ex-
 perience,  Zhivkov has said that
 experimental plots will be en-
 couraged on the enlarged farms.
 Capital investment for
 food and light industries rath-
 er than for heavy industry is
 emphasized because of the huge
 production increases expected
 from agriculture and because
 such investment will have an
 immediate  economic  effect.
 Present plans for heavy in-
 dustry apparently are not being
 scrapped. Zhivkov cites various
 methods  by  which industrial,
 construction, and transportation
 performances can be  improved,
 including reduction of all non-
 essential imports and the use
 of substitutes, introduction
 of additional shifts and as-
 sembly-line methods, and more
 technical training for workers.
 Bulgaria has many unem-
 ployed, and labor heads  the
 list of reserves on which the
 economy will draw in its "leap
 forward."  Men under 50, women

 party workers are to give from
 30 to 40 voluntary workdays in
 production annually.  Even cen-
 tral committee members are in-
 cluded under the motto:   "Let
 out leaders step in the mud a
 little."
 While 1962 industrial tar-
 gets could be achieved in 1960
 at the present rate of growth,
 none of the methods outlined
 by Zhivkov, can bring about
 the huge rise in agricultural
 output demanded.

 into steel because of
 excessive impurities.
 The utility of
 the steel is impaired
 because the form and
 shape in which it is
 cast is probably often
 not suitable for proc-
 essing  in a rolling
 mill. The use to
 which such a product
 can be put would there-
 fore be limited to
 smaller,   relatively  modern
 plants.
 The program, which began
 in earnest only last summer,
 seems to have been one of im-
 provisation with little advance
 planning.  Production of pig
 iron was stressed almost exclu-
 sively at first.  Peiping then
 took up the problem of making
 good steel from the varied
 quality of pig iron and is now
 beginning to turn its attention
 to providing finishing capacity
 for steel.   One of the major
 problems connected with the
 small-plant approach to iron
 production lies in the varia-
 tions in quality; much pig iron
 is unsuitable for conversion
 blacksmith forging in-
 to simple tools or
 for smelting for the producti:>>i
 of ingots or castings in larger
 plants.  The movement just get-
 ting under way for consolidating
 the thousands of small facilities
 into larger, more efficient units
 is, in part, a result of this
 problem.
 In addition to the benefit
 from the extra production, Pei-
 ping also stands to gain from
 the propaganda impact at home
 and abroad, particularly in under-
 developed areas.  The  Indian
 Government, for example, is plan-
 ning to send a delegation to       25X1

 Thie widening breach between
 Thailand and Cambodia threatens
 to undermine Western efforts to
 advance regional cooperation
 aimed at thwarting Communist ex-
 pansionism-in Southeast Asia.
 If relations between the two
 countries' continue to deterio-
 rate,. Cambodian Premier Sihanouk
 may turn to Communist China for
 support as he did last summer
 during his border dispute with
 South Vietnam.
 Sihanouk is surprised by
 the furor created by his suspen+-
 sion last week .of relations with
 Bangkok over ?oritical tt*ms~  :

 pears anxious to patch up the
 quarrel. The ruling Thai mili-
 tary group, however, apparently
 wanting to keep the issue alive
 for domestic political purposes,
 has stiffened its requirements
 for.:.a .restoration of relations.
 In addition, Thailand is con-
 sidering submitting the dispute
 to the UN Security Council.  Cam-
 bodia has already circulated a
 letter of protest at the UN
 charging that Thailand's activi-
 ties are "a threat to the peace
 These developments preclude an
 early settlement of differences
 between the two countries.
 The disposition of Thai
 leaders to ascribe Cambodia's
 actions to Communist influence
 or pressure increases the like-
 lihood that Sihanouk will charge
 Thailand with acting under "SEATO
 instructions" to overthrow his
 neutralist regime.  Rumors of
 American complicity with Thai-
 .,land in the present crisis are
 already current in Cambodian of-
 ficial circles.  Should Thailand
 use its American-trained forces
 ia..:border reprisals against Cam-
 'bodia's detention of 32 Thai na-
 tionals--as is being urged by
 some Thai military leaders--Siha-
 nouk might feel driven to seek
 military equipment from Peiping.
 The Laotian Government is
 in the initial phase of a pro-
 gram of administrative and se-
 curity reforms designed to re-
 store public confidence and
 check Communist expansion in
 the rural areas.  A sweeping
 monetary reform has been fol-
 lowed by an extensive shifting
 of inept or corrupt administra-
 tive officials.  More effective
 patrolling by the Laotian Army
 has reassured villagers in some
 areas of the government's abili-
 ty to protect them from repris-
 als by the Communist-dominated
 Neo Lao Hak Zat (NLHZ) party.
 In several provinces heavily
 infested by the NL,H?y military of-
 f icers have been appointed deputy
 governors in order to ensure ef-
 fective army security measures.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 4 December 1958
 These first stirrings of
 a positive government program
 are threatened by displaced
 conservative politicians,: who
 continue to harass the govern-
 ment in the hope of recovering
 former positions of influence
 now held by young reformist
 leaders in the cabinet.   It is
 possible these individuals will
 use the special session of the
 National Assembly in January as
 an opportunity to overthrow the
 government.   Phoui is searching
 for some means to mollify them,
 perhaps by expanding his cabi-
 net or by creating suitable gov-
 ernment sinecures.
 Revulsion against the nar-
 row opportunism of conservative
 deputies runs strong along the
 reform axis of Laotian politics
 the Crown, the army, and the
 reformist Committee for the De-
 fense of the National Interest
 (CDNI).  The parliamentary sys-
 tem has become increasingly dis-
 credited,
 THE SITUATION IN CUBA
 The Batista government in
 Cuba, which announced new ar-
 rests of disaffected army offi-
 cers last week, is in a more
 precarious position than at any
 time since Fidel Castro landed
 on Cuba's southeastern coast
 two years ago.
 Rebel forces, now estimated
 at more than 8,000,   virtually
 control Oriente Province, Cuba's
 largest and most populous prov-
 ince, and sabotage and harass-
 ment activities in three other
 provinces have increased.   Al-
 though the Cuban Army retains
 possession of the major cities
 in Oriente, it has been unable
 to break rebel blockades which
 have cut off Santiago, Guantana-
 mo City, and other cities, or
 to prevent the rebels from dis-
 rupting transportation and com-
 munications in the eastern half
 of the island.  Provisions are
 in short supply in many locali-
 ties.
 The rebel drive is serious-
 ly endangering Cuba's hitherto
 prosperous economy.  Rebel ac-
 tivities have interfered with
 the coffee harvest and will
 probably hinder the sugar har-
 vest scheduled to begin in a
 few weeks.  The disruption of
 transportation has already caused
 heavy losses by preventing the
 shipment of products to domes-
 tic markets.  Rebel activities
 have forced several companies,
 including some US owned, to cur-
 tail operations or to shut down,
 and unemployment,:,patticularly
 in Santiago, is becoming a seri-
 ous problem.
 Heavy government expendi-
 tures to support the campaign
 against the rebels are also be-
 coming a drain on the economy.

 PARTY PROBLEMS IN THE POLISH COUNTRYSIDE
 Two years after his return
 to power in Poland, Wladyslaw
 Gomulka still.lacks=?fu'lll control
 over portions of the party ap-
 paratus, especially at the
 grass-roots level.   This has
 been one of the more serious
 hindrances  to  his  program
 for the development of "social-
 ism" in Poland.   Local party
 functionaries--mostly appointed
 by the Stalinist Bierut regimeand
 still sympathetic to its prin-
 ciples--exhibit a guarded hos-
 tility toward Gomulka.   Some of
 them are able to hamper his
 program, and most remain a po-
 tential danger to his author-
 ity.   Despite his efforts since
 October 1956, he has not yet
 succeeded in winning over these
 hostile bureaucrats or in re-
 placing them with men loyal to
 him.
 Most lower- and middle-
 echelon party functionaries in
 the provinces apparently ex-
 pected Gomulka's tenure as
 party leader to be a short one.
 In order to be on the safe side
 if a change should occur, many
 of them preferred not to become
 too closely identified with
 him.   Furthermore, their sense
 of security in following such
 a course was bolstered by Go-
 mulka's disavowal of tough
 Stalinist measures to compel
 compliance with his program.
 The fact that Gomulka had long
 been out of contact with the
 party and did not know most of
 the middle- and lower-level of-
 ficials, nor they him, also
 made his problem more diffi-
 cult.
 Period Since October 1956
 Since October 1956 the
 local organizations of the Po-
 lish United Workers  (Communist)
 party (PZPR) have virtually
 disintegrated as effective or-
 gans of control.   Gomulka was
 so engrossed with pressing high-
 level problems involving the
 very survival of his regime, in
 the face of attacks by the
 Soviet-backed elements of the
 PZPR, he had little opportunity
 to devote attention to the party
 organization in the countryside.
 Some of the changes which
 Gomulka himself introduced
 tended to reduce still further
 the effectiveness of local party
 bodies.   In an effort to cut
 costs and rid the party of some
 of the top-heavy bureaucracy
 which had grown up under the
 former leaders, Gomulka decreed
 a sharp reduction in the number
 of paid party workers.   In many
 instances the abler party workers
 at the lower levels lost their
 jobs, while the entrenched bu-
 reaucrats higher in the PZPR
 hierarchy were able to retain
 theirs.   The loss of police
 power also proved to be a great
 handicap to the party apparatus
 in rural areas.
 The populace in rural areas,
 which never had much respect for
 the average party functionary,
 soon came to ignore the activ-
 ists and treat them as having
 virtually no authority.   Go-
 mulka's disavowal of forced
 collectivization and the sub-
 sequent dissolution of most
 collective farms encouraged the
 Polish peasant's individualism
 and traditional disrespect for
 authority.
 In addition to the weak-
 nesses deriving from these fac-
 tors, party authority in rural
 areas was further weakened by
 the elimination of the "nomen-
 clatural' privilege, which had
 permitted party secretaries at
 all levels to approve candidates
 for specific civil,  commercial,
 and industrial positions.   At
 provincial and lower levels this
 authority was transferred to

 local government officials, thus
 increasing their prestige and
 power at the expense of the
 party functionaries.
 The relatively free elec-
 tions of January 1957 in which
 strong identification with the
 party frequently proved a handi-
 cap, swept into office substan-
 tial numbers of people who had
 rather tenuous ties with the
 PZPR and even a number of non-
 party individuals.   The local
 party secretaries found they
 could not depend on the newly
 elected to reward loyal PZPR
 activists with the good jobs,
 so later that year a limited
 "nomenclatural' privilege was
 restored to party secretaries.
 The power of party secretaries
 has since increased to some de-
 gree,  but they have not regained
 their former authority.
 The period immediately
 following October 1956 also
 brought a significant revival
 of the old United Peasant party
 (ZSL) and the beginning of-a
 new struggle between it and the
 PZPR for dominance in the coun-
 tryside.   Farmers now felt free
 to express a preference for the
 ZSL and to reject the efforts
 of the PZPR activists to induce
 them to follow Communist direc-
 tives, a situation contributing
 further to the party bureau-
 cracy's  weakness and lack of
 influence.
 The chaotic situation re-
 sulting from the lowered morale,
 power, and prestige of the local
 (PZPR) organizations led to a
 clamor by provincial officials
 for aid from the party's na-
 tional headquarters.   The of-
 ficials repeatedly asked the
 central committee for more
 trained personnel, but, because
 of the economy measures under-
 taken by Gomulka, few paid ac-
 tivists could be added to the
 party payroll.   Party funds had
 been cut sharply because of the
 large number of Communists not
 paying their dues following Oc-
 tober.   Even after a measure of
 party discipline had been re-
 stored in the early months of
 1958, it was reported that not
 more than 50 percent of the mem-
 bers were paying their full dues.
 Problems of Rebuilding
 Although Gomulka has demon-
 strated remarkable political
 skill in rebuilding the Polish
 party from its state of near
 dissolution two years ago, his
 inability to reorganize the en-
 tire party into a cohesive unit
 responsive to his will remains
 a potential threat to his po-
 sition.   No matter how firm his
 control may be at the top, he
 must depend on the large number
 of officials at the grass roots
 to translate party orders into
 action. This remains Gomulka's
 most pressing problem, since he
 has for the most part succeeded
 in gaining control of the party
 apparatus at the national and
 provincial levels.
 Gomulka  has  Kilrays, been
 reluctant to unleash a Stalinist
 "witch hunt."   Nevertheless he
 has carried out a quiet purge
 of antagonistic and poorly quali-
 fied party functionaries,  and
 he has succeeded in weeding out
 many incompetents and unreli
 abler without fuss on fanfare
 He has consistently refused to
 be stampeded into rash actions
 in this direction lest they in-
 crease his problems instead of
 solving them.
 Many doctrinaire Stalinist
 holdovers are especially opposed
 to Gomulka's agricultural poli-
 cies.   The collective farm is
 an instrument of political con-
 trol as well as a unit of pro-
 duction, and the Stalinists con-
 sidered Gomulka's action in per-
 mitting the dissolution of the
 collective farms "a return to
 capitalism" and an ideological
 heresy.   Gomulka has always
 maintained that the "socializa-
 tion"                                                             of  agriculture., is 'the

 with socialism in the cities.
 He differs with his opponents,
 however,  on the pace and the
 methods to be employed.    He
 claims the old coercive meas-
 ures, which aimed at rapid col-
 lectivization, were harmful and
 caused peasant hostility to the
 party, as well as low produc-
 tivity of the socialized sector
 of Polish agriculture.
 an integral part of life for
 millions of Poles and that an
 all-out war against the church
 would result in a Pyrrhic vic-
 tory at best.
 Gomulka has been adamant
 in his position that the prin-
 ciple of voluntary acceptance
 of socialization in the coun-
 tryside must be strictly ob-
 served.   He advocates a pro-
 gram of education aimed at con-
 vincing farmers of the advan-
 tages of collectivization, and
 state aid to existing collec-
 tives in order to enable them
 to modernize their facilities
 and surpass the productivity
 of private farms.   To further
 this objective, Gomulka has
 urged that successful and re-
 spected  peasants be recruited
 as party activists.
 Old-line party function-
 aries in rural areas are dis-
 gruntled because Gomulka made
 a truce with the church which
 permitted it a greater measure
 of freedom than it enjoyed un-
 der the Bierut regime.   They
 consider the church agreement
 one of Gomulka's greatest back-
 ward steps,  for now the village
 priest has again become more
 powerful than the local Commu-
 nist party official.   The
 priest's influence in Catholic
 Poland, and especially in rural
 areas, extends far beyond reli-
 gious matters,   permeating so-
 cial,  political, and economic
 life as well.
 Gomulka too would like to
 curb the power of parish priests.
 He has several times character-
 ized the political activities
 of the clergy in the country-
 side as a serious problem to
 be overcome by the party.   Go-
 mulka hopes to accomplish his
 aims gradually through subtle
 rather than harsh tactics and
 without provoking trouble.   He
 realizes that Catholicism is
 Gomulka today probably is
 more popular among the peasants
 than with any other group in
 Poland, largely because of his
 liberal policies toward agri-
 culture and the church.   At the
 same time,  the PZPR is weakest
 in the countryside and has lit-
 tle following among the peasants,
 who in their political thinking
 tend to separate Gomulka from
 his party.
 In meeting the formidable
 task of revitalizing the party
 in rural areas,  Gomulka will
 probably follow a policy of try-
 ing to bring into positions of
 authority able men who are loyal
 to him and at the same time have
 some standing with the people.
 Few people meet these require-
 ments, however.
 Revitalizing the Party
 One of the most important
 innovations introduced by Go-
 mulka to combat demoralization
 and to revitalize the party at
 the lower levels was the crea-
 tion of "problem commissions"
 by the local first secretaries
 to solve various problems faced
 by the organization.   "Volun-
 teers" from the party ranks
 would be named for the commis-
 sion at a party meeting, and
 the group thus formed would be
 assigned to work with a full-
 time party official.   The compo-
 sition of these commissions was
 arranged so that no one ever
 worked on a problem involving
 his own area of responsibility.
 Since most problems arose in
 the fields of propaganda, party
 education, and discipline, most
 commissions worked with party
 officials responsible for these
 activities.
 Through the use of the
 Problem Commissions, the local
 party organization was able to
 get much of its work performed
 by unpaid party activists under

 the supervision of a full-time
 party functionary.        While the
 problem commissions frequently
 were able to shore up the shaky
 local party apparatus, they
 did not necessarily strengthen
 Gomulka's control at the lower
 levels.
 The  "verification"  of
 party membership, ordered by
 the 10th plenum in October 1957
 at Gomulka's behest, was an-
 other attempt to restore party
 discipline, rid the ranks of
 factional and opportunistic
 elements, and win better con-
 trol of the party apparatus.
 Neither politically nor organ-
 izationally did it produce all
 the results Gomulka hoped for,
 however, since the "verifica-
 tion" was carried out by the
 apparatus itself.  For the most
 part, those affected were the
 most apathetic rank-and-file
 members--15 percent of the par-
 ty's  total  membership  was
 dropped--leaving the hard core
 of the local party machines in-
 tact.
 Party weakness in the
 countryside has been an impor-
 tant factor in the repeated
 postponement of the long-over-
 due Third Party Congress, now
 scheduled to open on 10 March
 1959.  Gomulka refused to call
 the congress until he consid-
 ered his control over the cen-
 tral party organization suf-
 ficiently strong to enable him
 to push through his program.
 The first secretary's announce-
 ment at the party's 12th cen-
 tral committee plenum on Octo-
 ber of a date for the congress
 reflects his confidence that
 he now has this control.
 While no drastic moves
 against opponents seem likely
 between now and the congress,
 many Stalinists, opportunists,
 and incompetents in the party
 apparatus probably will be
 quietly replaced with Gomulka
 supporters.  Gomulka's stra-
 tegy appears to be one of
 gradually weakening the conser-
 vative faction and, whenever
 possible, winning over party
 bureaucrats instead of assault-
 ing his political opponents
 frontally.  Gomulka would pre-
 fer to placate, persuade, and
 reassure able party function-
 aries and use them for his own
 purposes rather than carry out
 a drastic purge.
 Gomulka  is  taking  no
 chances on not having a major-
 ity of the delegates to the
 party congress on his side.
 Delegates are to be chosen by
 the party organizations at the
 provincial level and in indus-
 trial enterprises.  By having
 delegates elected by higher
 level organizations, where he
 is strong, instead of at the
 lower levels and in the country-
 side where his control is weak-
 est, Gomulka will assure himself
 of a loya l majority at the congress.
 Following the election of
 a new central committee . by. the
 carefully chosen congress,Gomul-
 ka will for the first time be in
 a position to remake the entire
 party apparatus into an instru-
 ment responsive to his own ideas
 and capable of implementing his
 his policies.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE POLITICAL POTENTIAL OF ARAB LABOR UNIONS
 Arab labor unions operate
 predominantly as political,
 rather than economic,  organiza-
 tions, and have been subject to
 governmental suppression or
 control.   Union leaders are
 conditioned to political action
 because material gains for their
 memberships can be achieved
 only through bargaining with
 and pressure on the governments,
 or through labor representation
 in the governments.   The moti-
 vation for strikes has been
 political more often than eco-
 nomic.
 Generally speaking, the
 Arab union movements are still
 new, loosely organized, and
 weak, and their development
 varies sharply from country
 to country.   Their potential
 as a real political force stems
 from the basic weakness of
 other political institutions
 and from the chronic instabil-
 ity of most Arab governments.
 since encouraged their growth
 but has made sure at every step
 that they remain dependent on
 the government and subject to
 his orders.
 Before the creation of
 the UAR last February, the
 Syrian unions had some inde-
 pendence and a number of pro-
 Communist leaders.   At Nasir's
 instigation, however, several
 of the stronger leaders, both
 Communist and independent, have
 already been ousted.   He now
 has a program under way for the
 gradual federation of the Egyp-
 tian and Syrian trade union
 movements; he plans an elaborate
 new control apparatus to pro-
 vide close government super-
 vision and direction of union
 activities down to the factory
 level.   Thus the UAR union move-
 ment is an asset to Nasir's
 political position rather than
 a threat.
 Arab unions have long been
 a primary target for Communist
 penetration, and have also be-
 come involved in the struggle
 between Nasir's pan-Arab nation-
 alism and the nationalist move-
 ments of other Arab states.
 Continuing failure by unstable
 Arab governments to take the
 forceful measures necessary
 to improve economic conditions
 will promote tighter cohesion
 among workers, further growth
 of unions, and an increase in
 their inclination and capabil-
 ity to participate in anti-
 government actions.
 United Arab Republic
 In Egypt, where the union
 movement has been a carefully
 controlled creation of the gov-
 ernment and is dependent on
 government beneficence, union
 membership has grown rapidly.

 of the trade unions early and
 used them in his take-over from

 The International Confeder-
 ation of Arab Trade Unions
 (ICATU) was established under
 Egyptian aegis in March 1956,
 and its purpose is to spread
 Nasir's gospel and influence
 among trade unionists in other
 Arab states and in African
 states.   In some countries, such
 as Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq,
 this effort is a logical ad-
 junct of more direct UAR polit-
 ical intrigue; in others, where
 the governments quickly clamp
 down on such political interfer-
 ence but are disinclined to take
 unpopular measures against labor,
 it presents an opening for entry
 of the Nasir doctrine.
 When the ICATU was founded,
 Nasir said it would permit the
 trade union federations of the
 individual Arab states to belong
 to their own "neutral" inter-
 national organization, rather
 than to either the "imperialist-
 controlled" International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions

 but its main activity is out-
 side the country and political
 in nature.   The Syndicalist
 Union of Algerian Workers, cre-
 ated by the rival nationalist
 organization,  the Algerian Na-
 tional Movement, never estab-
 lished a foothold in Algeria,
 but claims to have 75,000 dues-
 paying members among Algerian
 workers in France.
 In Tunisia, 98 percent of
 Tunisian trade unionists belong
 to the General Federation of
 Tunisian Workers (UGTT).   The
 UGTT is an auxiliary organiza-
 tion of the Neo-Destour party
 and has five posts in the 11-
 member cabinet.   A small Commu-
 nist-directed federation, the
 Union of Syndicates of Tunisian
 Workers, dissolved itself in
 September 1956.   The UGTT, hav-
 ing aided the formation of
 ICFTU affiliates in Morocco and
 Algeria,  is pressing for the
 formation of a North African
 trade union confederation.
 Three fourths of Libyan
 unionists are in unions affili-
 ated with the Libyan General
 Workers'  Union.   The port work-
 ers of Tripoli have Libya's
 best-organized union.   The new,
 small but rapidly growing Oil
 Workers' Union reportedly has
 pro-Communist leaders.

 Sudan is more significant than
 its small membership would sug-

 in the key sectors of Sudanese
 industry and transport, and pri-
 or to the 17 November military
 coup, the Sudanese Communist

 jor Sudanese Workers'  Trade
 Union Federation.   The new mili-
 tary government has begun action
 to curtail Communist influence
 in the unions, dissolve front
 groups, and drive the party
 underground.
 Iraq
 The overtly organized union
 movement in Iraq is practically
 nonexistent.   But because past
 Iraqi governments consistently
 suppressed regular unions, a
 system of covert workers' groups
 has sprung up in which the Com-
 munist party has played a major
 role.   The Communists have had
 a part in directing organized
 activity by the Baghdad tobacco
 workers and the Basra oil workers,
 but little is known generally
 about other workers' groups, ex-
 cept that they remained strong
 enough, even in the face of
 stern reprisals by the Nuri Said
 government, to call strikes and
 mobilize street demonstrators.
 The Nuri Said government's
 practice of labeling virtually
 all its domestic opponents
 Communists and of resorting to
 waves of indiscriminate arrests
 resulted in a general feeling
 among Iraqi workers that the
 Communists must be on their side.
 The continuing failure of suc-
 ceeding Iraqi governments to
 improve the lot of the workers
 has resulted in an antigovern-
 ment bias of long standing.   The
 return of Communists from exile
 and the release of Communist
 leaders from prison since Qasim's
 coup have permitted an increase
 in party activities among Iraqi
 workers.
 Lebanese trade unions are
 well developed, relatively in-
 dependent, and basically anti-
 Communist.   About 90 percent of
 the members are in unions affili-
 ated with the "big-four"  fed-
 erations, all of which have non-
 Communist leadership.          The Com-
 munist party controls one tech-
 nically illegal federation and
 seven or eight   small unions.

 enough to exert considerable
 political influence.   It has not
 done so as yet, primarily because

 already caused the curtailment
 of imports from the underdevel-

 and, if the trend intensifies,
 it may seriously aggravate the
 exporting and foreign exchange
 difficulties of those raw-materi-
 als producers.   Although a seri-
 ous recession in Western Europe
 is not expected, the continuing
 threat to the economic growth of
 the underdeveloped countries is
 likely to lead many of them to
 press for enlarged international
 development funds and price sta-
 bilization arrangements.

 year in Western Europe turned
 downward--a decline of about 1
 percent--following a much re-
 tarded rate of growth in 1957.
 Subsequent data on various im-
 portant industries--for example,
 the present moderate decline in
 orders for steel products in
 France and Britain--suggest that
 the total decline for the year
 as a whole has been appreciably
 larger.
 A general decrease in the
 demand for resources, both for
 internal consumption and for ex-
 port,  began in the second half
 of 1957 and has continued during
 1958.   Slackened demand is mani-
 fested generally in the accumula-
 tion of stocks in the coal and
 textile industries, which are
 unable to compete effectively in
 world trade.    A moderate slack-
 ening of demand in the steel and
 metal-fabricating industries is
 more significant as it reflects
 somewhat reduced investment in
 machinery and equipment and the
 fact that capacity is catching
 up with demand.   The present
 tendency to reduce industrial
 inventories also suggests a pause
 in economic growth, which might
 become more serious before new
 impetus to demand develops.
 There has also been a sig-
 nificant reduction in employment
 levels throughout Western Europe,
 although with considerable varia-
 tion from country to country.
 In Britain,  for example, unem-
 ployment--2.8 percent of the

 European:Mh?ket?s Sigti ieance
 Western Europe's high in-
 dustrial development and com-
 parative lack of raw materials
 make it the most important mar-
 ket of the countries producing
 raw materials.   Although Western
 Europe's gross national product
 is only 60 percent of that of
 the United States, its imports
 of raw materials during 1956 were
 valued at $12.2 billion, or about
 double those of the United States
 and Canada.
 The coincidence of Europe's
 stagnation with the recent US
 recession intensifies its impact
 on the exports of the countries
 producing basic materials.   In
 contrast with the situation in
 1953-54, when Western Europe's
 then buoyant economy provided a
 strong demand for raw materials
 to offset reduced US buying, the
 slowdowns in both areas in 1957-
 58 largely overlapped, with
 Europe's occurring before the
 American recovery could exert a
 compensatory effect.

 PEIPING'S SHIFTING VIEWS ON TRANSITION TO COMMUNISM
 Peiping has recently al-
 tered its stand on the immi-
 nence of Communism in China and
 now is stressing that the coun-
 try is still in the stage of
 "socialist" construction.  Pol-
 itburo member Chu Te on 21 No-
 vember called for the indus-
 trialization of the "entire
 country" and of the communes,
 for management of agriculture
 in the same manner as industry,
 and for attainment of the "high-
 est world levels in science and
 culture."
 In describing the last-
 mentioned goal as one of the
 "necessary conditions" for
 eliminating the "serious" dis-
 crepancies between industry
 and agriculture, town and coun-
 try, and mental and physical
 labor, Chu in effect added an-
 other obstacle to China's rapid
 progress toward socialism on
 the road to Communism.  He com-
 plained that Peiping's achieve-
 ments to date "are still far
 behind what is needed to com-
 plete the building of social-
 ism,"  and warned against "be-
 having like Utopians."
 Chu's remarks are more in
 line with current Soviet doc-
 trine  than  earlier  Chinese
 statements which had played
 tional development assistance
 and credit facilities such as
 an  international  development
 association.  They will also

 Fund:and for international com-

 rangements.
 down a high level of industrial-
 ization as a necessary condition
 for the transition to Communism.
 In   a  recent  article,   the
 People's Daily on 22 Noveiuoer
 stated that payment according
 to "work" rather than "need"
 would continue throughout the
 "course of socialist construc-
 tion."  Chinese propagandists
 now state that the principle
 of pay-according-to-work, pre-
 viously described as a "vulgar"
 practice, is an "objective and
 unavoidable rule in the econom-
 ic life of a socialist society."
 They also say the system of
 payment in food according to
 "need" can be introduced only
 in those communes where sup-
 plies are abundant.
 The negative cast of Pei-
 ping's current statements on
 the transition to Communism
 gives some support for the view
 that Peiping has begun to defer
 to Soviet leadership, particu-
 larly since Soviet Ambassador
 Yudin on 7 November corrected
 China's claim of rapid "progress
 toward Communism."  Yudin said
 that the Soviet Union, where
 production is beginning to rival
 that of the most advanced capi-

 begins to change to Communism.
 By this statement, he implied
 that the Chinese could not hope
 to enter the Communist stage
 of development until a much
 higher level of production has
 been reached.
 Before November the Chi-
 nese had based their views on
 the future form of Communism
 almost exclusively on several
 works of Marx and Engels and
 on some of Lenin's early writ-
 ings, rather than on current
 Soviet theses.   They claimed
 that their views on labor un-
 der Communism were similar to
 those generally expressed in
 Marx's Critique of the Gotha
 Program, in which Marx speaks
 of the "enslaving subordina-
 tion of the individual to di-
 vision of labor" disappearing
 in the "higher phase of Com-
 munist society."
 Mao Tse-tung's chief lieu-
 tenant, Liu Shao-chi, implicit-
 ly attacked labor specializa-
 tion on 16 September, declar-
 ing that "all capable persons
 in out society must engage in
 labor--particularly physical
 labor."  Propaganda department
 chief Lu Ting-i made a direct
 attack earlier the same month,
 calling for the training of
 "all-purpose workers" who would
 be capable of various jobs in
 the factory, on the farm, and
 in the militia.  Liu cited Mao
 as well as Marx and Engels as
 authority, but he did not give
 any Maoist text.  Lu quoted
 the following from Engles' Prin-
 ciples of Communism:   "Educa-
 tion allows young people to
 familiarize themselves quickly
 with all systems of production
 and to alternate from one meth-
 od to another depending on the
 needs of society."
 In discussing the emanci-
 pation of women, the Chinese
 have stressed liberation from
 household chores, as discussed
 in Engles' Origin of the Fami-
 ly, State and Private Property
 and  Lenin:'.s  1919  work,  The
 Great Beginning.   Communal mess
 halls, nurseries, and kinder-
 gartens are justified by cita-
 tions from Lenin's article.
 Thus  Peiping's    approach  to
 freeing women from the "slav-
 ery" of the old-style family
 continues to differ consider-
 ably from Moscow's.
 Peiping's claim of early
 September that it had attained
 eight of the ten conditions
 for achieving Communism laid
 down in the Communist Manifesto
 and that the last two "are just
 now beginning to be attained"
 has not been repeated.  The
 position now seems to be that
 communalization--a "socialist"
 process--will take more than
 six years in some areas of the
 country, and that Communism
 will be achieved only after a
 "relatively long historical
 period."
 Peiping appears at best
 to be moving toward an announce-
 ment at some time within the
 next four years that the "main"
 foundations of socialism have
 been built in China and that a
 socialist society can be "com-
 pletely" built--a declaration
 which may place its progress
 toward Communism somewhat be-
 hind the advance of Bulgaria
 and Czechslovakia and consid-
 erably behind the USSR's posi-
 tion.
 In discussing Communism the
 Chinese have cited Mao Tse-tung's
 Selected Works only to illus-
 trate the conkitions for Commu-
 nism but not as a basic source
 defining these conditions.   The
 concept of the commune as the
 basic unit for China's future
 Communist society has been at-
 tributed to him, however.   In
 the event that he issues a thesis
 on the subject,.Mao almbst:cer-
 tainly will point to the unique-
 ness of the commune program and
 apply it to "China's concrete
 conditions" in order to avoid a  25X1
 bloc.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CHINESE COMMUNIST TRADE
 Communist China's trade
 with the free world, which is
 often conducted with political
 objectives in mind,  has in-
 creased from 26 percent of Pei-
 ping's total trade in 1954--
 after the Korean war--to 38
 percent in 1957, when it was
 valued at $1.16 billion.   It is
 expected to amount to nearly
 $1.3 billion this year,  out of
 China's planned $3.5 billion
 worth of foreign trade.
 At least half of China's
 trade with the free world is
 with the Far East and South-
 east Asia, where potential mar-
 kets for expanding
 light industrial ex-
 ports exist.   China's
 exports to these areas
 have consistently ex-
 ceeded imports, earn-
 ing foreign exchange
 for Peiping's purchas-
 es in Western Europe.
 Hong Kong and Japan
 normally account for
 half of China's Far
 East commerce.
 During the early
 period of the Chinese
 Communist regime, Hong
 Kong served as an en-
 tl-'epot                     for goods from
 Western Europe.   Now,

 its

 partly from
 the
 desirability of

 a balance of trade.   Ja-

 emergency purchases--as in 1956
 when immediate demands for ce-
 ment were fulfilled rapidly. Ja-
 pan's payments in sterling for
 its import surplus have provided
 China with about $185,000,000
 in foreign exchange to help meet
 its trade debts in Europe over
 the past eight years.

 trade relations with Europe,
 China's imports from the col-
 ony have fallen from more than
 $250,000,000 in 1950 to only
 $20,000,000 last year.   On the
 other hand,   Peiping's sales
 have gradually increased to
 the point where it now earns
 more than $150,000,000 in ster-
 ling annually from its export
 surplus with Hong Kong.
 Trade with Japan was in-
 significant until 1954, when
 China stepped up exports of ag-
 ricultural commodities and raw
 materials.   At the same time,
 but to a lesser degree, Peiping
 increased imports from Tokyo
 and by early this year trade
 was nearly balanced.  While Chi-
 China presumably will not
 be greatly affected over the
 long run by its cancellation
 of trade with Japan last spring.
 Trade contacts are in fact be-
 ing maintained  through  Hong
 Kong.   Indirect trade by Sep-
 tember had amounted to $4,000,-
 000.
 Southeast Asia
 Peiping has been able to
 further the impression through
 trade in Southeast Asia that
 China is the industrial giant
 of the Far East.   It has cap-
 tured a growing share of mar-
 kets for light industrial goods,
 particularly in Indonesia and
 Malaya, despite a general re-
 uction in demand for these

 goods as a result of depressed
 economic activity in the area.
 The large Overseas Chinese pop-
 ulation in Southeast Asian coun-
 tries has assisted Peiping in
 introducigg its consumer goods.
 The Bank of China branches
 in Southeast Asia supply Pei-
 ping with commercial intelligence
 and provide easy credit terms
 for importers of Chinese goods.
 Peiping offers products at pric-
 es as  much as 10 to 20 percent
 uelow those prevailing in the
 current market, and has report-
 edly offered rebates to mer-
 chants to compensate for im-
 port'taxes.   The Chinese effort
 is not limited to exports.  Com-
 munist China diverts its rubber
 purchases from one source to an-
 other in order to develop inter-
 nal pressures for increased eco-
 nomic.relations With : iping,
 The Singapore press reports
 that China now is banning all
 exports to Malaya, probably in
 retaliation for Malaya's an-
 nounced  intention  to  close
 branches of the Bank of China.
 Peiping presumably hopes that
 Malayan merchants, who received
 loans and financial concessions
 from China, will press the gov-
 ernment for an accommodation
 with Peiping.  Peiping may also
 decide to withdraw from Malaya's
 rubber market where,  in the
 first eight months of 1958, Pei-
 ping almost doubled its total
 1957 purchases.  The cancella-
 tion would be a temporary set-
 back to China's program for
 economic penetration.   It is
 likely that some trade with Ma-
 laya would continue through
 Singapore.
 Exploiting  Indonesia's
 anti-Western attitude and dis-
 rupted economy, Peiping has se-
 cured a firm foothold through
 long-term commercial credits,
 loans, and emergency food ship-
 ments.   In 1957, China supplied
 over 70 percent of the cotton
 cloth purchased by Indonesia.
 To assure retention of this mar-
 ket, Peiping is delivering on
 long-term credit cotton tex-
 tiles equal to 25 percent of
 its ..,sales" in  Indonesia  last
 year.  China has offered to
 supply textile machinery and
 is exporting rice to Indonesia
 on credit.   The Bank of China
 in normal commercial transac-
 tions with Indonesian importers
 arranges to provide importers
 of Chinese goods with the 100-
 percent deposit now required
 to obtain import licenses.  Pei-
 ping also offers contracts quot-
 ing fixed prices for future de-
 liveries, at a time of wildly
 fluctuating commodity prices.
 In other parts of Asia,
 China uses credit programs and
 trilateral trade deals to in-
 troduce increasing quantities
 of its goods in return for sur-
 plus agricultural commodities.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY

 goods, showed sudden increases
 in the last half of 1956 and
 in the last part of 1957, as a
 result of     "exception"  proce-
 dures to trade controls and
 the subsequent relaxation of
 these restrictions.     Increased
 direct purchases of iron and
 steel--totaling about 125,000
 tons in 1957--usually purchased
 and transshipped via Eastern
 Europe accounted for most of
 the recorded increases in ship-
 ments of strategic goods.  A-
 bout 1,000,000 tons of iron
 and steel have been bought in
 Western Europe this year, re-
 flecting, in part,.the cancel-
 lation of planned purchases of
 400,000 tons from Japan in 1958.
 Peiping's trade with in-
 dividual countries of Western
 Europe has been subject to wide
 fluctuations, resulting from
 political  considerations  and
 variations in China's economic
 planning.  It is common Chi-
 nese practice to withhold trade
 contracts until a. foreign trade
 delegation arrives in Peiping
 in order to propagandize the
 accomplishments  of  such mis-
 sions.
 West Germany and the United
 Kingdom normally account for 50
 percent of China's trade with
 Western Europe.  Sino - West
 German trade has grown rapidly
 in recent years.   It is stimu-
 lated this year by China's pur-
 chase of over 300,000 tons of
 steel plates.  China's imports
 from the United Kingdom during
 the first nine months of 1958
 were 75 percent higher than
 during the same period in 1957.
 These imports consist chiefly
 of metals, wool tops, and ma-
 chine tools.
 Trade under the initial
 agreements signed with the Scan-
 dinavian countries in the lat-
 ter part of 1957 may increase
 China's trade deficit in West-
 ern Europe.
 Peiping established its
 first economic tie; with Africa
 in 1955 by concluding a trade
 agreement with Egypt.  China
 now  conducts  $100,000,000
 worth of trade annually with
 14 African countries, having
 official trade pacts with four.
 Peiping's purchase of Egyptian
 cotton, amounting to about $42,-
 000,000 in 1957, has kept Sino-
 African trade balanced.  China
 is now insisting on barter
 agreements  with  those trade
 partners with whom it has had
 trade deficits, while its cur-
 rent trade drive elsewhere in
 Africa is primarily to seek
 markets for its own goods.
 Although the American em-
 bargo has virtually eliminated
 trade with China's former major
 trading partner in the western
 hemisphere, Peiping is increas-
 ing its efforts to expand rela-
 tions  with  Canada  and  Latin
 America.  China's purchases of
 Canadian wheat amount to over
 100,000 tons this year--ten
 times greater than last year.
 In Latin America, Peiping is
 stepping up imports of Brazil-
 ian sugar and exporting large
 quantities of coal to Argentina.
 Trade with Latin America prob-
 ably will reach a new peak this
 year and may total $50,000,000.
 Communist China's growing
 import requirements from the in-
 dustrial West are largely bal-
 anced by its growing trade in
 underdeveloped areas where its   25X1
 export balance provides the nec-
 essary foreign exchange.
