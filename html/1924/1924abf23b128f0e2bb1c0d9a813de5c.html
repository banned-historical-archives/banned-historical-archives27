INTRODUCTION 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The National Intelligence Digest is intended to serve as a 
summary of intelligence on major world problems for the use of 
government officials. Users of the Digest should be aware that 
it is not designed to provide complete and up-to-the minute 
current intelligence. The country handbooks published by the 
Office of Current intelligence provide this type of information 
in considerable detail. Moreover, the Digest does not provide 
a compilation of National Intelligence Estimates, but rather is 
a collection of generalized abstracts of such estimates. The 
Digest will be revised monthly to take account of major current 
developments and to include abstracts of the latest pertinent 
National Intelligence Estimates. The date at the bottom of each 
page indicates the cut-off date for the information contained on 
that page. 
SOURCE 
The Digest is. not an LW-coordinated publication. Where 
National Intelligence Estimates are abstracted, the source Will 
be clearly indicated in a footnote. CIA assumes sole responsi-
bility for this abstracting as well as for all other material. 
CLASSIFICATION 
This Digest as a whole is classified TOP SECRET and each page 
is so marked. Individual sections in many cases have lower 
classifications, which are shown under the title on the first page 
of the section. The lower classification may be employed if the 
material is separated from the Digest_

TOP SECRET A - 
ESTIMATE OF THE WORLD SITUATION THROUGH 1955* 
(SECRET) 
SCOPE 
This estimate is concerned with the major international trends which 
will affect the world situation through 1955 rather than with the specific 
events and conditions which will characterize that situation. The esti-
mate must assume a continuation of present US policies and thus cannot 
consider the effects which a change in these policies would have on the 
world situation. 
ESTIMATE 
The Over-All Situation Through 1955 
Despite the change in regime in the USSR and the shifts in Soviet 
foreign and domestic tactics, there has been no change in the USSR's 
basic hostility to all non-Soviet power. The USSR will continue its cold 
war against the Free World, largely through a vigorous political warfare 
campaign. While East-West negotiations are possible, there is little 
likelihood of any major Soviet concessions. 
On the other hand, we believe that deliberate initiation of general war 
by the USSR is unlikely during this period,** and, to the extent that the 
USSR pursues a more cautious policy, the chance of war by miscalcula-
tion will also probably be less. However, there will be continuing danger 
that it may occur from a series of actions and counteractions initiated by 
either side, but not intended by either side to have that result. In par-
ticular it might arise from actions by one side that were regarded by the 
other as an imminent threat to its security. There will also be a con-
tinued danger of new or intensified East-West clashes, particularly in 
Indochina, and Korea, and of incidents in Germany. 
In the absence of such East-West clashes, and unless the USSR aban-
dons its ostensibly conciliatory tactics, the next two years will probably 
be a period of reduced Free World apprehensions of general war. So long 
as this period lasts it will present a new challenge to the Free World. 
While over the longer run the very diversity of the Free World may lend 
it a flexibility and potential for growth which will constitute a source of 
strength, over the next two years this diversity may prove a source of 
weakness. The totalitarian nature and centralized controls of the Soviet 
Bloc might give it advantages in this phase of the cold war, even though 
the totalitarian rigidities of the Bloc system might over the longer run 
* This chapter contains the complete text of NIE-99, "Estimate of the World 
Situation Through 1955" (23 October 1953). 
** The Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, considers that the in-
telligence available is insufficient to permit a judgment, of Soviet capabilities 
or intentions, sufficiently accurate to justify the conclusion that: 
"Deliberate initiation of general war by the USSR is unlikely during this 
period."

impair its stability and cohesion. Continued stresses and strains within 
the Soviet Bloc are likely, but the monolithic unity and forced cohesion 
of the Bloc will probably be much less affected by a situation of reduced 
apprehensions than the more divided Free World. Moreover, the build-
up of Bloc strength will almost certainly continue, even if at a somewhat 
reduced rate, while the Free World may be inclined to relax its guard. 
We believe that in a situation of reduced international apprehensions 
and Bloc emphasis on divisive tactics, there is danger of a weakening in 
the unity of the Free World. 
The progress being made by the USSR in the development of nuclear 
weapons is also a factor of prime military and psychological importance 
in the world situation. As this Soviet capability increases, Western 
superiority in numbers of nuclear weapons will be of relatively less sig-
nificance so far as the psychological factor is concerned. As the USSR 
increases its capabilities for delivering a seriously damaging attack on 
the US, the US is losing the unique position it has held in the East-West 
struggle. The full impact of this development is not yet clear, but even 
now we perceive two new elements: 
a. One is the danger that the USSR may use threats of atomic bom-
bardment against certain Free World countries in an attempt to force 
their compliance with its demands. There is a chance that some US 
allies, if they feared that the threat of US retaliation would not deter 
Soviet action, would be forced by the prospect of atomic devastation to 
adopt more neutral positions in a cold, or especially in a hot, war. 
b. In an age where initial air assault can be so destructive, the US is 
losing, if it has not already lost, the immense advantages of being able 
to conduct a deliberate and extensive post D-day mobilization with rela-
tive freedom from enemy attack. 
Probable Trends in Soviet Bloc Cohesion, Strength, and Policies 
Cohesion of the Bloc. Despite the possibility of a disruptive struggle 
for power within the new Kremlin leadership and the evidence of popular 
disaffection within the Satellites, we believe the Bloc will preserve its 
cohesion through the period of this estimate, and that the Kremlin will 
continue to play the dominant role in the formulation of Bloc policies. 
We believe that the USSR and Communist China will remain closely allied 
during the period of this estimate. 
Bloc Capabilities. The build-up of Bloc basic industry and military 
capabilities will continue even though increased attention will be devoted 
to the correction of certain economic deficiencies in agriculture and con-
sumer industries which recently have been specially emphasized. There 
are indications that the Soviet authorities intend to proceed along the 
lines laid out in the announced plans for these sectors of the economy. 
This would require an allocation of greater resources to agricultural and 
consumer goods production and, at least for the short run, would lead 
to a reduction in the rate of expansion of other sectors of the economy. 
The most significant increase in Bloc military capabilities during the 
period of this estimate will arise from enlargement of the Bloc stockpile 
of nuclear weapons (and the addition of a thermonuclear component) , 
and from an increase in the number of its jet aircraft and its submarines.

TOP SECRET 1-3 
The Bloc may by mid-1955 have available a sufficient number of heavy 
bombers to increase greatly its long-range air offensive capabilities. The 
Bloc will probably increase its air defense capabilities, and may have a 
limited number of all-weather jet interceptors in operational units. We 
do not believe that marked changes in Bloc military strength and capa-
bilities are likely to occur in other respects; however, there will be a 
general improvement in training and equipment of Bloc armed forces. 
Bloc political warfare capabilities, through exploitation of Western 
political and economic vulnerabilities, encouragement of anti-Westernism 
and nationalism in underdeveloped countries, and utilization of the 
world-wide network of Communist parties, will remain great. 
Probable Bloc Policies.*** We believe that the Communist rulers re-
main profoundly convinced that permanent hostility exists between the 
Communist and the free worlds. Their basic objectives, therefore, con-
tinue to be an expansion of their own sphere of power and the eventual 
domination of the non-Communist world. 
We believe that during the period of this estimate Bloc leaders will try 
to avoid courses of action which in their judgment might involve sub-
stantial risk of general war. We also believe it unlikely that the Bloc 
will initiate new local aggressions with identifiable Bloc forces during the 
period of this estimate, since the Communist leaders probably estimate 
that virtually any new local military aggression would now entail sub-
stantial risk of general war or political consequences adverse to Bloc 
interests. 
It is always possible, of course, that the Kremlin will deem some act 
of local armed aggression sufficiently advantageous to make the risk 
worth while. Moreover, despite its reluctance to run substantial risks of 
general war, the Kremlin might through miscalculation adopt some 
course of action involving such a risk. We also believe that the Kremlin 
would not be deterred by the risk of general war from taking counter-
action against a Western action which it considered to present an immi-
nent threat to Bloc security. 
During the period of this estimate the Communist leaders will conduct 
a vigorous political warfare campaign to undermine the Western power 
position. At present the Kremlin seems to be trying to give the im-
pression that it has adopted a more conciliatory policy than that fol-
lowed in Stalin's later years. The Kremlin may hope by such tactics to 
relax the vigilance of some Western states, to encourage dissension be-
tween the US and its allies, and to delay the progress of Western rearm-
ament. We cannot predict how long such comparatively conciliatory 
tactics will continue; we believe that harsh courses of action similar to 
those pursued by the Kremlin in the past will reappear whenever the 
Kremlin deems them advantageous. 
We believe that Bloc leaders during the period of this estimate will 
probably be prepared to reach an accommodation on some minor ques-
tions, and may make plausible but unacceptable proposals on major 
matters. However, they will almost certainly be unwilling to settle any

East-West differences at the cost of major concessions. We believe, more-
over, that the Bloc leaders will be extremely cautious in pursuing con-
ciliatory tactics, and may revert from time to time to demonstrations of 
toughness, especially when they consider that their vital interests are 
involved, or that their tactics are being construed abroad as a sign of 
weakness. Offers to negotiate may be accompanied by reminders that 
the USSR now has improved capabilities in the nuclear weapons field, 
and as these capabilities further increase, the Kremlin may become 
bolder in its dealings with the West. 
There are recent indications that the Bloc intends to increase its trade 
with non-Communist states. The Bloc's volume of trade with the Free 
World will probably increase somewhat during the period of this esti-
mate, but this trade will continue to be very small in proportion to intra-
Bloc trade. New trade agreements will probably be intended not only 
to obtain desired imports but also to weaken the economic ties of non-
Communist states with the US, and to make strategic trade controls a 
bone of contention between these states and the US. While the Bloc 
will not be able to bring about a major shift in present trade patterns, 
the Communists probably estimate that political dividends can be earned 
from even small increases in their current volumes of trade with indi-
vidual non-Communist states. 
Probable Developments in the Free World 
During the next two years the Free World will have difficulty in main-
taining its strength in the face of Soviet divisive tactics and probable 
reduced apprehensions of East-West conflict. In contrast to the Krem-
lin's ability to control or influence the close-knit Soviet Bloc, the US, as 
leader of the anti-Soviet powers, faces the complex problems of dealing 
with the loose anti-Soviet coalition and the agglomeration of other na-
tions of varying neutral tendencies which together make up the Free 
World. To many of this latter group, particularly the Middle and Far 
Eastern countries, the East-West struggle seems less important than the 
solution of their internal problems and the assertion of their independ-
ence of the chief Western Powers. 
Differing views also exist between the US and its allies over the immi-
nence of the Communist threat. The very fact of Communist aggression 
in Korea increased fears of general war and was a prime factor in stimu-
lating Western rearmament. Now that many Free World countries be-
lieve that the threat of war has been reduced by a Korean armistice and 
by an ostensibly more conciliatory Soviet policy, the US will have greater 
difficulty holding together an anti-Soviet coalition and in securing in-
creased Free World armed strength. The levelling off of the US's own 
rearmament effort and the decline in many of its foreign aid programs 
also lessens the sense of urgency abroad. 
The apparent decline of Free World confidence in US leadership is 
another problem facing the US. Influential groups in many Free World 
countries, including several US allies, doubt the stability, moderation, 
and maturity of US policy. On the one hand, there is fear the US will 
shift to a "go-it-alone" policy or even retreat to isolationism, on the other 
that the US will involve the Free World in war. These doubts and fears

TOP SECRET 1-5 
offer a fertile field for Soviet divisive tactics, and the new Soviet regime 
may be more successful than Stalin in exploiting them. 
In a situation in which many Free World countries believe that the 
threat of war has been reduced, economic problems will also assume 
greater prominence and will test the strength and cohesion of the Free 
World. This reduced apprehension will weaken what has been a power-
ful incentive to cooperation and sacrifice. Moreover, some readjustment 
to a reduced rate of rearmament and declining US aid will be necessary. 
Much will depend on US economic policies and the US economic situation. 
Not only would US economic setbacks have a serious impact on the Free 
World, but US trade policy will directly affect the economic health of 
Free World countries, and US aid will remain in many cases an important 
element in their military build-up, economic stability and development, 
and political orientation. The problem of East-West trade is also likely 
to become more troublesome. 
Therefore, we believe that in the absence of renewed Soviet provocation, 
there may develop further serious rifts between the Free World nations 
which will weaken the Western position in the cold war. Such rifts may 
develop in any case as a result of economic developments or local nation-
alist pressures but reduced apprehensions of war, combined with skillful 
Soviet divisive efforts, would make them even more serious. The most 
troublesome differences may arise over policies to be pursued in the Far 
East. It is possible, therefore, that the next few years might see an 
increasing isolation of the US, not by its own desire but because of in-
creasing policy differences between it and other countries of the Free 
World. 
Even assuming the continuation of the Soviet courses of action pro-
jected above, there remains a serious danger of new or widening East-
West clashes in such critical areas as Indochina, Korea, and Germany, 
which would again increase Free World apprehensions. Whether, if such 
clashes took place, the Free World would then rally to the support of the 
US and of expanded rearmament programs, as after the Korean aggres-
sion, would probably depend at least in part on the circumstances under 
which the clashes developed. 
Probable Developments within the NATO Coalition 
Although we foresee no developments which will undermine the basic 
solidarity of the NATO alliance, we believe that, in view of reduced Euro-
pean apprehensions of East-West conflict, rifts may develop between the 
NATO partners, particularly between the European NATO countries and 
the US. The USSR will attempt to undermine popular support for the 
NATO alliance and for rearmament, in particular the program to rearm 
West Germany. These efforts, together with increased Soviet nuclear 
capabilities, continued intra-European differences, and European disa-
greements with the US over cold war policies, may lead to more nation-
alist and neutralist attitudes in Western Europe. 
So long as apprehensions remain reduced there also will almost cer-
tainly be a further loss of momentum in the NATO build-up. The gen-
eral feeling that the immediate Soviet threat has receded has already led 
most NATO countries to reduce their military outlays. While a further

slow increase in NATO strength over the next two years is probable, only 
in event of renewed Soviet aggressiveness will it be as rapid as in 1950-
1953. On the other hand this might allow many NATO countries to 
concentrate on domestic needs and to devote more resources to meeting 
their own social and economic problems. Such a trend might strengthen 
countries such as the UK, which remain highly vulnerable to adverse 
international economic developments. 
Significant increases in European NATO military strength over the 
coming period will probably depend upon the extent to which Spain, 
Yugoslavia, and above all West Germany can be directly or indirectly 
associated with NATO. The Trieste issue will remain an irritant in Italo-
Yugoslav relations which will render the association of Yugoslavia with 
NATO difficult. Until a settlement of the Trieste issue is generally 
accepted, the usefulness to NATO of the Greek-Turkish-Yugoslav entente 
will be impaired. 
But above all, the prospects for greater European NATO strength and 
cohesion will revolve increasingly around the interlocking problems of 
Germany's future and the attitude of France. As a result of Soviet 
failure to come forward with any acceptable reunification scheme and 
of Adenauer's overwhelming victory, the chances for integrating West 
Germany with the Western Powers and for initiating its rearmament 
have increased. The Kremlin may seek to avert or postpone these devel-
opments by renewed talk of German reunification, but it is unlikely to 
offer any terms which would jeopardize its control over East Germany. 
Adenauer's position is so strong and German disillusionment with Soviet 
unification offers is so great that any Soviet offers not involving aban-
donment of Soviet control over East Germany would be unlikely to have 
much impact on German opinion. The importance attached by the 
Soviet rulers to West German rearmament is such, however, that they 
might react to it by measures which would enhance the risk of an East-
West clash in this area. A likely pressure point would be West Berlin. 
Though many in France are aware of the need for strong government, 
there is no evidence that this awareness will lead to a stronger French 
political system.

Probable Trends in the Far East 
In the last two years the most active theater in the East-West struggle 
has been in the Far East. There the Western Powers have kept the Com-
munists from overrunning South Korea and Indochina while attempting 
to build up anti-Communist strength through US support of the non-
Communist countries in this area. We believe it unlikely that the Com-
munists will undertake new local aggression in the Far East with identi-
fiable Bloc forces. The emphasis in Communist China over the next two 
years will probably be on building up industrial and military strength. 
However, we believe that the Communists would take counteraction 
against Western actions which they felt presented an imminent threat 
to their security, even at the risk of widening hostilities in the Far East. 
It will be difficult to increase the strength, cohesion, and anti-Com-
munist orientation of the non-Communist states of the Far East. The 
cessation of hostilities in Korea, together with Communist efforts to pro-
mote rifts among the anti-Communist powers, will add to this difficulty. 
During the next two years there is unlikely to be any significant improve-
ment in the Western position in this area; moreover, there are possibili-
ties of serious deterioration, particularly in Indochina, Indonesia, and 
Korea. 
Korea. A Korean political conference, if it takes place, is unlikely to 
result in any agreement which would alter the status quo. The Commu-
nists are unlikely to break the armistice by renewing hostilities, but they 
almost certainly will not agree to Korean reunification on terms which 
would endanger their control of North Korea. On the other hand, if 
President Rhee remains convinced that the US could neither prevent an 
ROK armed attack against the Communists nor disassociate itself from 
military support of such action, once undertaken, we believe that he 
will probably at some time seek to disrupt the armistice by such an 
attack. If hostilities are renewed, the Communists will probably take, at 
a minimum, the military measures they consider necessary to maintain 
their position in Korea. Unless the ROK renews hostilities, we believe 
that there will be a continued armed truce in this area, with both the 
US and USSR engaged in reconstruction and in strengthening their re-
spective Korean partners. 
Taiwan. Any major change in the status of Taiwan is unlikely. The 
Communists probably will not attempt invasion so long as the US de-
fends Taiwan; and unless the US decides to support Chiang's forces 
directly, he in turn will be unable to undertake more than minor harass-
ment of the mainland. 
Indochina. We believe that there will almost certainly be important 
developments in the Indochina situation during the period of this esti-
mate. The steady deterioration of France's will to continue the struggle 
has been at least temporarily checked by French resumption of the initi-
ative under the Laniel-Navarre plan. We do not believe, however, that 
the French will achieve a complete military victory. The French objec-
tive is to reduce the drain of the Indochina war on France, while main-

taming a position for France in the Far East. The outcome will depend 
on whether, by a combination of military victories and political conces-
sions, the French can strengthen the Associated States to the point where 
these states will be able to maintain themselves against Communist 
pressures with greatly reduced French support. The French would hope 
in this way to create a situation which could serve as a basis for successful 
negotiations with the Communists. The Laniel-Navarre plan may be 
the last French effort in Indochina. Should it fail to achieve its objec-
tives we believe that, unless the US proves willing to contribute forces, 
the French will in time seek to negotiate directly with the Communists 
for the best possible terms. 
For their part, the Chinese Communists will almost certainly continue 
their present type of support for Viet Minh. They are unlikely to inter-
vene with organized units, at least in the absence of Western moves 
which in their opinion threatened the security of Communist China. At 
the same time, the Communists will probably talk of peace negotiations 
as part of their propaganda campaign and might raise the Indochina 
issue in high level political conferences. They are unlikely, however, to 
agree to any political settlement which they believe would lessen their 
chances of eventually gaining control of Indochina. 
Other Countries of Southeast Asia. Problems facing the other South-
east Asian countries are those of attaining political stability, coping with 
local insurrections, and meeting their own serious economic problems. 
The outlook in the Philippines, and in the absence of serious deteriora-
tion in the Indochina situation, in Burma, Thailand, and Malaya, is for 
some improvement in stability, though these countries will by no means 
resolve their numerous internal problems. In Indonesia, however, the 
leftist character of the present government offers increased opportunities 
for Communist penetration, 
Japan. Accumulating economic difficulties and the reluctance or in-
ability of the Japanese Government to adopt energetic economic and 
rearmament policies are prolonging Japanese dependence on the US and 
delaying Japan's development as a counterweight to Communist power 
in the Far East. At the same time there is growing anti-American senti-
ment in Japan. Unless Japan can find the necessary foreign markets 
and take the necessary internal economic measures, the development of 
a sound defense structure as well as a sound economy will be endangered, 
the present dominance of the moderate conservatives will be weakened, 
and the whole pattern of US?Japanese cooperation will be threatened. 
We foresee no basic change in Japan's pro-Western orientation, but eco-
nomic difficulties and growing nationalism will create increased US?
Japanese frictions and postpone the development of a strong anti-Com-
munist Japan. 
Prospective Trends in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia 
In the underdeveloped areas of Asia and Africa the Western position 
has deteriorated since World War II. Local nationalism has proved a 
force against the West and the deep-seated revolutionary forces at work 
in these areas have created political instability. It is difficult to over-
come the anti-Western sentiments of the newly independent Asian and 
African countries and convince them that Communist policies threaten

their independence. Except in Iran, however, the internal Communist 
threat is small and is unlikely to grow greatly in the next two years. 
The Middle East and North Africa. Conflicts between native nation-
alists and the "colonial" powers will continue, but we believe that in 
certain areas there are prospects for improvement in the West's position. 
The fall of Mossadegh in Iran has at least temporarily increased the 
opportunities for strengthening Iran's internal stability and settling the 
Anglo-Iranian oil dispute. Chances for settlement of the Anglo-Egyptian 
base controversy have improved, and if a settlement is reached it will 
probably have a favorable effect on both the stability of the Egyptian 
regime and on the Western position throughout the Arab World. On 
the other hand, an Anglo-Egyptian settlement may set the pattern for 
similar demands from Iraq. The Arab?Israeli dispute will continue, but 
a renewal of large-scale hostilities remains unlikely in view of the near 
military equilibrium of the two parties, and the restraining influence of 
the US, the UK, and France. The more favorable policy that the US has 
adopted toward the Arab States may contribute to better relations with 
them. However, there remain possibilities of markedly adverse develop-
ments in this volatile area. Although the deposition of the Sultan of 
Morocco has temporarily bolstered French control, it is likely to drive 
the nationalists to more extreme positions since France seems unlikely to 
implement very far-reaching reforms. 
South Asia. India and Pakistan will probably remain preoccupied 
with their own serious economic and social problems; they will also 
remain concerned with their dispute over Kashmir. India is unlikely to 
abandon its neutralist position in the cold war, but Pakistan, motivated 
largely by its desire to improve its position vis-a-vis India, will continue 
its efforts to secure some pact with the Western Powers, in return for 
extensive US aid. Some further improvement in the relations of this 
area with the West may occur over the next two years, but they will 
remain acutely sensitive both to anti-colonial disputes in other areas and 
to any indications that the West is pursuing aggressive cold war policies, 
particularly against Communist China. 
Probable Trends in Latin America 
There will probably be a continued trend in Latin America toward 
extremely nationalistic regimes based on demagogic appeals to sectors of 
new political importance ? organized labor, white-collar workers, and 
the lower middle class. This trend will be most evident in countries 
where rapid social and economic change is taking place. This change 
results from forced industrialization at the expense of agriculture, which 
is generally accompanied by severe inflation. Right or left extremism 
which poses potential threats to US security interests will probably be 
strongest in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Guatemala, and possibly Brazil. 
In these countries there will continue to be substantial Communist and 
demagogic nationalist influences, which will attempt to channel the 
resentment of the dislocated groups against the US. In Guatemala 
Communist influence over the government, already strong, may increase. 
Communist penetration of British Guiana has posed a new problem in 
the Caribbean area.

Most Latin American countries will probably continue to cooperate

increasingly to pursue an independent course on issues affecting under-

US trade and especially tariff policies. Regardless of the degree of Latin 
American cooperation with the US, there will probably be an increasing 
tendency to expand commercial and possibly diplomatic relations with 
the Soviet Bloc.

B. PROBABLE tnECTS OF INCREASING NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES 
UPON THE POLICIES OF US ALLIES* 
(Secret) 
ASSUMPTIONS 
Nuclear weapons will not have been used in war since 1945. 
No international agreement will have been made restricting or 
outlawing the use of nuclear weapons in war. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A great and recognized growth in nuclear capabilities will 
obviously intensify the anxiety of peoples and governments to avoid 
war. No government will willingly run risks of war unless interests 
are at stake which it considers vital, and the threat of nuclear 
weapons will almost certainly tend to narrow the range of interests 
that any government will consider vital. 
Under such circumstances, the difficulties presently felt in 
maintaining an effective Western coalition under US leadership may 
be increased, but we do not believe that the alliance will neces-
sarily show significant weakness, at least as long as there does 
not seem to be a greatly increased likelihood of general war. The 
US allies will probably seek to obtain greater influence over US 
policy in order to ensure a cautious and non-provocative attitude 
toward the Communist states. 
The alliance could receive a severe test, however, in con-
nection with local aggression committed or supported by the Soviet 
Bloc. Fear already exists that strong reaction to such aggression 
might lead to general war. Fears of general war will be intensified 
when both great power blocs are believed to possess large nuclear 
capabilities. US allies would therefore be even more insistent than 
at present that every effort be made to limit the scope and area 
of local conflicts and to deal with local aggression without resort-
ing to acts which might expand the conflict into general war. US 
allies generally would also be more unwilling than at present to 
participate in repelling local Communist aggression.

In the event of international crisis involving grave danger 
of general war, we believe that the allies would almost certainly 
support the US as long as they believed that firm maintenance of 
the alliance would probably avert war. 
We cannot estimate the probable courses of action of US allies 
if an international crisis should develop to the point where general 
war seemed to them virtually certain and no longer to be averted 
by firm maintenance of the alliance. There is inadenquate evidence 
or precedent on which to calculate the reaction of governments and 
peoples who consider themselves to be facing imminent threat of 
attack with nuclear weapons. Among the factors influencing the 
courses of action of each nation, we believe that the following 
would be of most importance: (a) the estimate that the government 
and people would make of their chances of survival in the event of 
participation in general war; (b) the alternatives which would ap-
pear available at the time; (c) the political and social stability 
of the state, and the morale of its population; (d) the importance, 
to the state, of the issueS at stake in the crisis; (e) the strength 
and cohesion of the alliance at the beginning of the crisis, and 
the degree of integration Of its armed forces; and (f) the judgment 
which people and government had made of the wisdom and skill with 
which US policy had been conducted. 
We believe that most allied governments, if confronted with 
certain national destruction as the sole alternative to an ac-
commodation with the USSR, would choose the latter. We believe 
it unlikely, though possible, that the major allies of the US 
would become convinced that the alternatives facing them were so 
limited and so clear-cut as the two described.

C. PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOVIET BLOC 
AND WESTERN POWER POSITIONS OVER THE 
NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS* 
We believe it essential to state at the outset that there is 
no unequivocal answer to the question "is time on our side." Even 
assuming a continuation of the present amoral trend of policies 
of both the Bloc and the Western Powersw* (itself an assumption of 
doubtful validity), there are so many accidental or unpredictable 
factors which will materially affect the world situation as to 
prevent any firm estimate of the relative Soviet Bloc and Western 
power positions fifteen years from now. However, it is possible 
to appraise in general terms our likely power position vis-a-vis 
the Bloc if present trends continue and if various major alternative 
developments do or do not come to pass. 
PROBABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF SOVIET BLOC AND THE WEST 
The Soviet Bloc. At present the over-all economic strength 
of the Soviet Bloc is far less than that of the Western Powers; 
in term of gross national product (GNP), the 1952 output of the 
entire Bloc is estimated to have been about one-third that of the 
Western states.*** However, the economic strength of the Soviet 
Bloc should increase greatly over the next 10-15 years. Soviet 
GNP will probably almost double within this period, while Bloc GNP 
as a whole will increase around 75 percent. 
Bloc economic capabilities to wage war are likely to increase 
substantially since the Bloc will probably continue to place great 
emphasis on military production.

Development of the Soviet Bloc and Western Power Positions",

The West. It is more difficult to estimate the probable eco-
nomic growth of the Western Pcwers. The Western economies are more 
vulnerable to economic fluctuations and trends in international 
trade than are those of the Bloc. However, assuming a continuation 
of present trends and no serious depressions, we estimate the prob-
able growth in US GNP at about 56 percent over the next fifteen 
years, and at almost 50 percent for the WesternPowers as a whole. 
While Bloc GNP will probably increase at a higher rate than 
that of the Western Powers, the GNP of the West is already so much 
greater than that of the Bloc that the absolute gap between the 
two will widen despite the lower rate of Western growth. Thus the 
West will remain for the indefinite future greatly superior to the 
Soviet Bloc in total economic strength. 
PROBABLE SCIENTIFIC CAPABILITIES OF THE WEST AND THE SOVIET BLOC 
The over-all scientific assets of the West are now far 
greater than those of the Soviet Bloc, and almost certainly will 
remain greater over the next fifteen years, despite great efforts 
by the USSR to reduce this disparity. 
It is impossible to estimate whether the power relationships 
between the Soviet Bloc and the Nest will be changed during the 
period of this estimate by any major technological breakthrough by 
either side, such, for example, as the initial production of the 
atomic bomb by the US in 1945. 
PROBABLE TREE:6 IN THE MILITARY CAPABILITIES OF THE WEST AND THE 
SOVIET BLOC 
We believe that throughout the next fifteen years the West 
will maintain a substantial absolute advantage in capabilities for 
atomic warfare, but that the Bloc will gradually reduce this ad-
vantage. Within the period of this estimate both US and USSR will 
produce a sufficient stockpile of atomic and possibly thermonuclear 
weapons to cripple the other side, if delivered on targets. How-
ever, unless it attained complete strategic surprise or achieved 
an unforeseen technological breakthrough, we believe that neither 
side would be able to prevent powerful retaliation in kind. It is 
likely that the West will, during the period of this estimate, 
remain superior to the Soviet Bloc in capabilities for tactical use 
of atomic weapons. 
The development of Bloc and Western power positions during the 
next fifteen years will be significantly affected by their relative

conventional military capabilities. Bloc military forces are being 
continuously modernized and strengthened. The ability of the West 
to counterbalance this by developing local military capabilities, 
particularly in key areas such as Went Germany and Japan, will 
depend on Western and other policy decisions. 
PROBABLE TRENDS IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRENGTH AND COHESION 
OF THE SOVIET BLOC AND THE WEST 
The Soviet Bloc. Political and social trends will have an 
important, and perhaps controlling effect on the relative power 
positions of the Bloc and the West and are most difficult to 
estimate over so long a period as the next fifteen years. During 
this period a struggle for control within the Kremlin might cause 
a retraction and decay of Soviet power. However, we believe it 
unsafe to assume that over the next 10-15 years the Soviet regime 
will lose its stability or the Bloc its cohesion. 
Trends in the Political and Social Strength and Cohesion of  
the West. Because of the greater diversity of the looser Western 
coalition, we find it even more difficult to project probable 
trends in Western strength and cohesion. However, at no time in 
the foreseeable future will the Western Powers be likely to attain 
or to desire to attain centralized control to mobilize their re-
sources. In general, they will probably continue to be more sub-
ject to internal conflicts, economic fluctuations, and divisive 
influences than the Bloc. 
As the only single aggregation of resources outside the US 
itself comparable to the Soviet Bloc, Western Europe plays a major 
role in the world power balance. Its continued weaknesses con-
stitute a major vulnerability of the Western Powers, while Western 
Europe's acquisition by the Bloc would be a tremendous increment 
to Soviet power. The reappearance of a strong and viable Western 
Europe, including Germany, would alter the present power relation-
ship between the Soviet Bloc and the West to the advantage of the 
latter. 
We believe that a primary concern of the Kremlin over the 
coming period will be to frustrate the development of a viable 
and defensible Western Europe; in so doing the Kremlin will almost 
certainly concentrate on the German problem. If a shift in Soviet 
policy on Germany, for example, led the Germans to accept a united, 
armed, and neutral Germany, it would introduce a new factor of 
great significance into the world power balance. Such a develop-
ment, if accepted by our NATO allies, would not necessarily weaken 
the Western position. A rearmed and neutral Germany would act as 
a buffer state, and if the Germans were subsequently to abandon 
neutrality, we believe that they would be more likely to align 
themselves with the West than with the Bloc.

The emergence of a rearmed, anti-Communist Japan would be a 
major asset in restoring the strategic balance in the Far East. 
However, the degree of future Japanese cooperation will depend 
largely on the extent to which Japan's political, economic, and 
military demands are met. 
The Strength and Alignment of "Gray" Areas  
A major difficulty facing the West is represented by the 
extreme political and social instability of the underdeveloped 
areas of the Middle and Far East and Africa. The anti-Western 
overtones of this political and social revolution create ad-
ditional difficulties for the West. The danger to the Western 
position is acute in some areas of Southeast Asia and the Middle 
East. Their loss would be a serious blow to the West. 
However, Western control or influence is still paramount in 
these areas. Over the next 10-15 years the US and its allies 
still have the opportunity to undertake actions which might arrest 
this trend and maintain that influence. 
Possible Effects of a Kremlin Shift to Soft Tactics  
We believe that a prolonged Kremlin shift to more moderate 
tactics would also present a real challenge to further growth of 
the Western Alliance. Should the Soviet threat appear to diminish, 
the likelihood of divisions among the Western Powers would markedly 
increase. It might lead, over the longer run, to some of our al-
lies adopting more neutral positions, or even to the creation of 
a European "Third Fome." 
A prolonged relaxation of tensions might also have an ad-
verse effect on the cohesion and vitality of the world Communist 
apparatus and hence on the Soviet power position. Soviet leaders 
are under some compulsion to pursue an aggressive policy in order 
to preserve the Communist ideology as a vital force. Any pronounced 
subduing of the irreconcilable hostility motif of Communist propa-
ganda might serve to soften the rank-and-file of foreign Communist 
parties. 
IS TIKE ON OUR SIDE? 
We believe that the Soviet Bloc under present policies and 
programs will over the next 10-15 years decrease the proportion by 
which its economic and technological capabilities are inferior to

those of the West and will acquire sufficient atomic capabilities 
to cripple the US. Therefore, although the West will probably 
retain a sizable absolute margin of superiority, we believe that 
in these respects time must be said to be on the Soviet side. 
In other respects, time may be on the side of the West. The 
West's military capabilities will increase during the next fifteen 
years if conventional rearmament programs and tactical applications 
of unconventional weapons enhance its present defensive capabili-
ties in overseas areas. The extent to which these developments 
are likely to occur depends on Western and other policy decisions. 
Trends can be identified within both the West and the Bloc 
which might undermine each side's political stability and cohesion. 
We cannot predict, however, that these trends will have such ef-
fects and certainly we cannot say that they would do so within the 
period of this estimate. 
Even under the assumption of continuation of the present 
general trend of policies in both the Bloc and the Western Powers, 
there are so many accidental or unpredictable factors which could 
alter present trends, that we are unable to conclude that time 
is on the side of either the Soviet Bloc or the West. Though a 
few of the components of power can be projected with fair confi-
dence, the relative over-all development of the power positions of 
the West and Soviet Bloc cannot be predicted.

(See charts following this section) 
WIC COMMUNIST OBJECTIVES AND BFLTRFS 
The Communist leaders now in power in the USSR, or any that are 
likely to succeed the% almost certainly will continue to consider 
their basic objective to be the consolidation and expansion of their 
own power, internally and externally? In pursuing this policy most 
Soviet leaders probably envisage ultimatelys (a) the elimination of 
every world power center capable of competing with the USSR; (b) the 
spread of Communism to all parts of the world; and (c) Soviet domina-
tion over all other Communist regimes, 
Soviet leaders probably are also committed to the following 
propositions concerning the empansion of the power of the USSRg 
a. The struggle between the Communist and the non-Communist 
world is irreconcilable; 
b. This struggle may go on for a long time, with periods of 
strategic retreat possibly intervening before the final 
Communist triumph; 
C. The struggle will not necessarily involve general war, 
though general war is always a possibility; 
During the period of "coexistence of the two camps" 
of Connunism and capitalism, the Communists must steadily 
build up the economic and military strength of the USSR, 
its Satellites, and Communist China; and

At the same time, the Communists must constantly try to

controls over the police, armed forces, and the bureaucracy remains 
intact. The Beria affair, during !whicA the influence and status of 
the MVD were reduced, confirmed the effectiveness of party controls 
within this important instrument of power. Despite the increased 
prestige granted to certain military career officers since Stalin's 
death, there is no evidence of stiV relaxation of party controls over 
the armed forces. 
Stabilitz:of the Regime  
We believe that the present Soviet regime is firmly in power 
and that it is unlikely to be dislodged either by a grouping of 
forces outside the top leadership or as the result of a struggle 
within it, Significant changes may take place in the composition 
of the ruling group or in the relative power positions of its members; 
one man may even succeed in gaining absolute power. We believe, hoe-
ever, that the new Soviet regime mill be able to resolve such con-
flicts within the confines of the ruling group and the higher echelons 
of the Communist Party. Consequently, we believe that whatever con-
flicts for power 4r differences respecting policy may develop within 
the ruling group, they are unlikely to affect significantly the 
stability of the regime or its authority within the country, or to 
prevent it from making policy decisions and carrying them out. These 
policies and their implementation will continue to reflect the funda-
mental agreement which evidently obtains Among the leaders concerning 
the basic objectives of the Communist regime. 
Domestic Policies  
Although there has been no weakening in the authority of the 
Soviet regime, there has been an apparent effort to moderate some of 
the more vigorous aspects of the system devised by Stalin. Since 
the death of Stalin the regime has promised the people an improve-
ment in their standard of living and increased personal security 
for average law-abiding citizens. The regime has backed these pro-
mises with a variety of measures designed to impress upon the popu-
lation at large the seriousness of its intentions. 
We believe that the Soviet regime's present efforts to moderate 
Certain aspects of the dictatorship and to raise living standards 
sprang from a conaidered revision of the extremes of Stalin's manner 
of rule and were not merely the temporary concessions of a new regime. 
We believe that the Soviet leaders recognize that a reversal of this 
program, except in the event of an external threat of actual war, 
would result in serious public discontent Which would tend to retard 
the growth of Soviet economic strength. Consequently, these measures 
will Almost certainly be continued for the next two or three years,

and possibly throughout the period of this estimates if the pressure 
of external or internal circumstances does not require their reversal. 
The result may well be an improvement of morales, especially among 
the more privileged eleeents of the population. However if the oone 
cessions made to the peasant population do not achieve sufficient 
increases in agricultural productions, or if they result in renewed 
resistance to the system of collective farming, the regime will prob-
ably resort again to more repressive measures against the peasantry. 
In this events, the regime might find itself ?faced with serious prob-
lems of low public morale and low productivity. 
SOVIET-SATELLITE RELATIONS 
The appearance of new leadership in Nbscow has had no apparert 
effect on the character of the relations betwe n the USSR and its 
Satellite states in Eastern Europe. We believe that Soviet authority 
over the satellite regimes will remain intact during the period of 
this estimete. Widespread political discontent and serious difficulties 
in building up the Satellite economies will continue. However, during 
the next five years the Satellite centribution to Soviet power will 
gradually increase. Soviet control will continue to depend primarily 
on the presence or proximity of Soviet armed forcess, and in the 
absence of general war popular dissatisfaction almost certainly will 
not develop. beyond the stage of paseive resistance and occasional 
localized outbreaks of violence. 
SINO -SOVIET RELATIONS . 
The relations of the USSR with Communist China are markedly 
different from those prevailing between the USSR and any other Comm-
unist country. Communist Chima is more a Soviet ally than a Satellite. 
It posseesee some capability for independent actions, possibly even 
for action which the USSR might disapprove but which it would find 
difficult to repudiate. However, the main outlines of Communist 
policy in Asia are probably jointly determined * Moscow and Peiping. 
While the Soviet voice probably will remain preponderants, Communist 
Chine appears to be increasing its stature within the Sino-Soviet 
partnership. Soviet propaganda and diplomacy have recently given 
great emphasis to Chinags claim to an acknowledged position in inter-
national affairs? and the USSR has giw en evidence of a willingness 
to have Communist China assume greater responsibilities in further-
ing Communist interests in Asia. In particular Communist China seems 
to have an increasingly important role in the execution of Communist 
policy in North Korea and Indochina.

The national interests of the USSR and Communist China are in 
SOMB cases conflicting, and constitute potential sources of friction 
between the two powers. We believe, however, that throughout the 
period of this estimate the cohesive forces in the Sino-Soviet re-
lationship will be far greater than the divisive forces. The USSR 
and Communist China share a common ideology. Both of them regard 
the US AO the chief obstacle to the achievement of their objectives, 
and consider that their interests are threatened by US policy and 
power. Moreover, each partner profits at the present time from its 
alliance with the other. Communist China receives essential Soviet 
political, military, and economic support. Soviet leaders recognize 
in China a valuable ally, Which provides the USSR not only military 
strength and defense in depth in the Par "Bast, but also a base for 
further advancing Communist aims in Asia. 
SOVIET Ecopomrp POLICY 
The present regime in the USSR has not fundamentally changed 
the traditional policy of placing primary emphasis on the rapid 
development of heavy industry and war potential. The new regime 
has, however, devoted a great deal of its attention and energies to 
a revision of =rent economic plans aimed at speeding up the produc-
tion of agricultural commodities, especially foodstuffs, and manu-
factured consumer goods. Soviet leaders have stated that this goal 
is to be achieved without decreasing the tempo of heavy industrial ? 
development, but they apparently intend, at least for the next two 
years, to limit defense outlays to approximately the high level 
reached in 1952 andmaintained in 1953. This modification of Soviet 
economic programs is designed to overcome deficiencies in certain 
sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture. 
We believe that Soviet economic policy will continue, at least 
through 19552 to place primary emphasis on the further growth of 
heavy industry, While maintaining defense outlays at approximately 
a constant level, and giving increased attention andresources to 
agriculture and consumer industries. Since advances in consumption 
are likely to fall far short of expectations, the chances are good 
that the regime will feel it necessary to continue the pattern of 
resource allocations along present lines through 1959. However, if 
at any time the KreOlin estimates that international tension is 
rising dangerously, 'then it Will almost certainly increase defense 
allocations. 
SOVIET ECONOMIC GROWTH 
The rate of growth of the Soviet economy has declined in the 
past five years from the very high: rate of the immediate postwar period.

We estimate that during the next two years Soviet gross national 
product (GNP) will increase by about six or seven percent, and in 
1956-1959 by about five or six percent, per year. If US GNP should 
increase during the period of this estimate at its long-range annual 
average of three percent, Soviet GNP would at the end of the period 
bei about two-fifths of US, as compared with about oneg4hird in 1953. 
The pattern of resource allocation in the Soviet economy in 
1953 showed about -14 percent devoted to defense, 28 percent to in-
vestment, and 56 percent to consumption. Current econOmic programs 
indicate that for at least the next two years the amount of expendi-
ture on defense, instead of continuing the rapid increase that 
prevailed in 1950-,1952 will remain about the same, While expenditure 
on investment and consumption will increase. We believe the chances 
are better than even that the Kremlin will continue its policies 
along these lines throughout the period of this estimate-, The chief 
emphasis will almost certainly continue to be on further development 
of heavy industry. 
The Soviet leaders probably recognize that their economy is 
unable to support the additional heavy investment outlays in industry 
and the increased requirenents of the agricultural and consumer goods 
program, While simultaneously maintaining such a rapid rate of in-
crease in the production of conventional military goods as prevailed 
in the Korean War period. Moreover?, Maintenance of a constant level 
of total military expenditure would not imply any slackening in the 
Soviet program in the field of unconventional weapons. It is possible, 
despite the absence of direct evidence, that the USSR will maintain 
conventional military production at somewhat lower levels for at least 
the next few years, but will give increased emphasis to the develop-
ment of unconventional weapons and new weapons systems. 
The chief weakness of the Soviet economy as a Whole has been 
in agricultural production, Which has remained since 1950 at ap-
proximately the prewar level, though the population is now about 
10 percent greater than in 19140. Soviet leaders appear to have 
recognized that continuation of the serious lag in agriculture would 
ultimately make it difficult to meet the food requirements of the 
growing urban population, the raw material reqnirements of the ex-
panding industrial economy, and the export requirements of Soviet 
foreign, trade, iA which agriculture plays a major role. To remecly 
the situation the regime has embarked on a vigorous prOgram? with 
the aim of achieving by 1956 a 50 percent increaee in agricultural 
production over 1950. We believe that this goal will not be met, 
and that even by 1959 agricultural production will be no more than 
15 to 20 percent higher than in 1950. Even this increases however, 
would be sufficient to achieve a moderate increase in the per capita 
availability of foodstuffs and textiles.

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
15: CIA-RDP67-00059A000100010002-7 
Soviet scientific and technological capabilities are sufficiently 
well developed to provide effective support to industrial and military 
research and development. At present, the scientific assets of the 
USSR (the number and quality of trained personnel, facilities, equip-
ment, and financiel support) are smaller than those of the US, and 
the assets of the Soviet Bloc are far smaller than those of the West. 
However, with respect to scientists of the very top rank, whose 
numbers are few in any country, the USSR probably has in many fields 
men who are as able as their counterparts in Western countries. The 
USSR provides the bulk of Bloc scientific assets, but East Germany 
and Czechoslovakia, and to a lesser extent Poland and Hungary, con-
tribute a substantial increment. Communist China is unlikely to add 
significantly to Bloc scientific assets prior to 1960. 
MILITARY STRENGTH AND WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT 
We believe that, generally speaking, the size of Soviet armed 
forces-in-being will remain approximately constant during the period 
of this estimate. However, the over-all effectiveness of these 
fortes will increase, mainly because of the following factors: 
a. A great increase in numbers of nuclear weapons, and in 
the range of yields derived frap these weapons; 
b. An increase in the number of all-weather fighters and 
jet medium bombers, and the introduction of jet heavy 
bombers in 1957; 
c. A great increase iA the number Of long-range submarines; and 
d. An increase in combat effectiveness of Soviet ground forces, 
primarily due to improved weapons, equipment and organizes 
25X1 tion, and to changes in doctrine and tacticsdesigned to 
increase their capabilities for nuclear warfare.

Jet Bombers 
In the past several months there have been =elusive indica-
tion that a jet medium bOmber equipment program has been initiated 
in Soviet Long-Range Aviation. During the 1954 Soviet May Day 
fly-by and the rehearsals preceding it, 9-11 twin jet medium bombers, 
designated by allied intelligence as Type 39, participated. SUb-
segued, intelligence has associated this type with a known Soviet 
Long-Range Aviation unit. We estimate that as of 1 July 1954 at 
least two regiments of Soviet Long-Range Aviation with a TIE 
strength of 60 aircraft were in process of equipment with Type 39 
jet medium bombers. Total actual strength of these units is estimated 
at approximately 20 aircraft. Series production of the Type 39 is 
estimated to have begun in mid-1953, and total production as of 
1 July 1954 is estimated at about 40 aircraft. It is estimated that 
Soviet Long-Range Aviation will contain an actual strength of 650 
jet Medium bombers by mid-1957, and 1,050 by mid-1959. 
The Type 370 which was initially observed on 30 July 1953 and 
later observed in flight on seven different occasions in connection 
with the 1954 May Day celebration, is a swept wing, for-engine, 
jet heavy bomber with an estimated gross weight of 365,000 peunds. 
The aircraft, considered presently to be in the prototype stage, 
is expected to appear in operational units by the end of 1956 building 
up to an actual strength of about 50 aircraft by Mid-1957 and 250 
by mid-1959. 
There has been some evidence of the existence of a large bomber 
designated the Type 31. On the basis of present evidence, it is 
highly doubtful that any substantial re-equipment of Long-Range 
Aviation units with Type 31 class aircraft has occurred to date, 
though possibly 15 or 20 may have been introduced. The Long-Range 
Aviation re-equipment program to replace the TU-4 is more likely to 
be accomplished by introduction of the jet bomber aircraft which 
have now appeared, and the Type 31 class probably will not be in-
troduced in numbers.

Air Defense Weapons 
We estimate that at present Bloc defensive capabilities against 
air attack are insufficient to provide an adequate defense under the 
variety of eenditione which could be expected to prevail. Through 
1957 Bloc air defenses will probably be gradually strengthened by 
the introduction into operational units of new fighter aircraft, new 
radar equipment, new anti-aircraft weapons, and surface-to-air guided 
missiles. All-weather fighters in limited quantities are probably 
already being introdueed into operational units, but problems related 
to the operation and maintenance of airborne intercept radar will 
probably take a minimum of 18-24 months to solve. The filtering 
phase of air raid reporting (combat information control) is expected 
to continue to be a major problem daring the period of this estimate. 
However, the gradual improvement of weapons, equipment and training 
will be sufficient by 1958 to provide a Bloc air defense system 
substantially more effective than that now existing. 
Submarines  
The Soviet Navy is apparently concentrating on the construction 
of two long-range submarine types developed since World War II. 
These are equipped with snorkel and have operating radii of about 
4,700 and 6,700 miles respectively. By early 19550 107 of these had 
joined the fleet and the present building rate is estimated as 75 
per year. The Soviets are known to have continued development of 
the Walther Closed-cycle engine for submarine propulsion and an 
experimental submarine powered by such an engine could be operational 
now. It is also possible that, during the period of this estimate, 
nuclear propuJ ion for submarines will have been developed by the 
USSR. However, there is no evidence of Soviet development of sub-
marines equipped with either of these types of propulsion. 
PROBABLE SOVIET COURSES OF AMON 
We believe that the developments within the sphere of Soviet 
power and the Soviet estimate of the world situation have led the 
Soviet leaders to assess their own situation somewhat as follows 
the balance of military power in the world and the increasing 
destructiveness of nuclear weapons are such that general war would 
involve very heavy risks to the Communist sphere, extending possibly 
to the destruction of the Soviet system itself. On the other hand, 
non-Communist power is not so great that withdrawals from the present 
advanced positions in Europe and Asia seem necessary. Moreover, 
the prospects probably seem good that the increase of Bloc military 
capabilities, together with political defections or disunity on the 
non-Communist aide, will gradually shift the balance of power in

favor of the Soviet Bloc. In the meantime, the Bloc has a full 
agenda of internal problems which, while they do not imply a 
weakness requiring abandonment of expansionist aims or even the 
neglect of opportunities for expansion under circumstances of limited 
risk, do call for attention during the next five years at least. 
These problems include the further buildup of economic power in the 
Bloc as a step toward balancing the vastly greater economic potential 
of the West, and the correction of certain weaknesses in the Bloc 
economy, particalarly in agricultural production. 
We believe that during the period of this estimate, the Kremlin 
will try to avoid courses of action, and to deter Communist China 
from courses of action, which in its judgment would clearly involve 
/substantial risk of general war.* However, the USSR or one of the 
Bloc countries might take action creating a situation in which the 
US or its allies, rather than yield an important position, would 
decide to take counteraction involving substantial risk of general 
war with the USSR. We believe, moreover, that the Kremlin would not 
be deterred by the risk of general war from taking counteraction 
against a Western action which it considered an imminent threat to 
Soviet security. Thus general war might occur during the period of 
this estimate as the climax of a series of actions and counteractions* 
initiated by either side, which neither side originally intended to 
lead to general war. 
The progress being made by the USSR in the development of nuclear 
weapons, and the increasing Soviet capability to deliver these weapons, 
are changing the world power situation in important respects. Soviet 
* ThecAssistant Chief of Staff, G-2, and the Director of Intelligence, 
USAF, believe that the following Should be substituted for the first 
sentence of this paragraphs "Although the Kremlin will probably 
try to avoid courses of action and to deter Communist China from 
courses of action that entail'substantial risk of involving the 
USSR in general warp it may be more willing to support courses of 
action that would involve risk of a localized war between the US 
and Communist China. The support given such courses of action 
would depend largely on Soviet judgment as to the probable outcome 
of the war. If the Soviet leaders believed that it would result 
in a severe defeat to Communism, or the fall-scale participation 
of the USSR in general watj, they would probably exert pressure on 
the Chinese to avoid courses of action which would precipitate 
hostilities. On the other hand, if they estimated that the conflict 
could be limited to war localized in the Far East, and that it 
would result in greater relative damage to US strengths than to 
Communist strengths, they probably would support more adventurous 
courses of action on the part of the Chinese COnnunists.?

fore have greater freedom of action to promote its objectives without 
running substantial risk of general war. In any case, the USSR will 
probably be increasingly ready to apply heavy pressure on the non-
Communist world upon any signs of major dissension or weakness among 
the US and its allies, Nevertheless, we believe that the Kremlin 
will be extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in which the 
USSR would expect to be subjected to nuclear attack, The extent to 
which the Kremlin uses its increasing freedom of action will depend 
primarily on the determination, strength, and cohesiveness of the 
non-Communist world, 
We believe that the Kremlin will continue to pursue its ex-
pansiOnist objectives and to seek and exploit opportunities for 
enlarging the area of Communist control. It will be unswerving in 
its determination to retain the initiative in international affairs 
and to capitalize on successes in order to keep the Free World on 
the defensive, For the near term, however, the Kremlin will almost 
certainly direct its external policies towards the immediate ob.. 
jectives of weakening and disrupting the mutual defense arrangements 
of non-Communist states, preventing or retarding the rearmament of 
Germany and Japan, undermining the economic and political stability 
of non-Communist states, and isolating the US from its allies and 
associates in Europe and Asia. At the same time it will continue 
to expand the industrial strength of the Bloc, and to maintain large 
modern forces-in-being as a guarantee of the integrity of the Bloc 
and as an instrument of intimidation in support of its policies abroad. 
The Communists will vary the methods used to accomplish the 
foregoing aims and will time their actions so as to exploit situations 
that in their judgment offer the most favorable opportunities. For 
the time being, the Krealin seems to feel that its foreign objectives 
will be best served by a generally conciliatory pose in foreign 
relations, by gestures of HpeacefUl coexistence" and proposals for 
mutual security pacts, by tempting profrers of trade, and by playing 
on the themes of peace and disarmament. The purpose of these tactics 
is to allay fear in some parts of the non-Communist world, to create 
the impression that there has been a basic change in Soviet policy, 
and therefore to destroy the incentive for Western defense, and to 
undermine US policies, At the same time, however, the Communists 
continue to support and encourage nationalist and anticolonial move-
ments, and to maintain their efforts to subvert governments outside 
the Bloc. We believe that the Kremlin will revert to more aggressive 
and threatening conduct Whenever if feels that such conduct will 
bring increased returns. By such varieties and combinations of tactics

the Soviet leaders almost certainly consider that they cal improve 
the chances fOr further Communist strategic advances. We do not 
believe that such tactics indicate any change in basic Communist 
objectives, or that they will involve any substantial concessions 
on the part of the Kremlin. 
We believe that Southeast Asia almost certainly offers, in the 
Cormunist view, the most favorable opportunities for expansion in 
the near future. The Communists will almost certainly attempt to 
extend their gains in Indochina, and will probably expand their 
efforts to intimidate and subvert neighboring countries by political 
infiltration and covert support of local insurrections. We do not 
believe that the Communists will attempt to secure their objectives 
in Southeast Asia by the commitment of identifiable combat units 
of Chinese Communist armed forces, at least during the early period 
of this estimate, However, we find the situation in this area so 
fluid that we are unable-to estimate beyond this early period.

Political  
Since their assumption to power in 1949, the Chinese Communists 
have undertaken to create an industrialized and militarily powerful state. 
At present, the energies of the regime appear to be devoted to the con-
solidation and expansion of Chinals"economic strength, modernization of 
military forces, and the transformation of China's political and social 
structure. 
The Chinese Communists have adapted Soviet administration and political 
institutions and techniques to Chinese conditions. The highly centralized 
and dictatorial government has imposed a unitary state structure with 
direct lines of command down to the village level. 
Ultimate power in China resides in the Cbmmunist Party and is vested 
in the Political Bureau (Politb?ro) of the Party's Central Committee. 
Mao Tse-tung continues to dominate the government and party. By the 
terms of the Constitution, adopted in 1954, Chu Teh is in line to succeed 
.Mao as Chairman of the government, but actual power appears more or less 
divided between Liu Shao-chti, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Congress, and Chou En-lai, Chairman of the Government Council. 
Despite rivalries for power in the past, Chinese leadership has 
been marked by the cohesion and stability of the party elite. The first 
purge of major proportions since 1938 appears to have been in process 
since at least early 1954. The chief victims to date have been Kao 
Kang ("suicide"), former Politburo member and boss of Manchuria; and 
Jao Shu-Shih (present status unknown), former government head of the 
East China regional area. There is no firm evidence as yet as to the 
extent, intensity, or full cause of the purge campaign. 
The precise manner in which Soviet influence or control finds 
its way into Chinese policies is not known. Soviet advisers almost

certainly are in contact with Chinese leaders, but it is unlikely that 
they issue direct orders. The USSR is able to exert influence over 
Chinese policies primarily by virtue of their common ideology and 
China's economic and military dependence on the USSR. 
The Communist regime has vigorously and ruthlessly set about 
establishing political control over the Chinese people. To de this, 
it has employed a wide array of programs, ranging from inducements and 
patriotic appeals to coercion and terror. 
The Obnmunists have had considerable success in winning support 
from certain government workers, members of the armed forces, skilled 
industrial workers and particularly the youth. 
Through terror and force, the Communists have eliminated the 
landlord class and thousands of businessmen,, professionals, and former 
government officials. There is no evidence of significant organized 
resistance. To insure its control, the regime has established extensive 
security forces in addition to the army. 
Although much of the voluntary support the regime received in 1949 
has been dissipated, such dissatisfaction as now exists in China has 
neither the universality, the intensity, nor the physical means by which 
to transform itself into effective resistance. 
China's domestic interest, international relationships, and long-
term aspirations have resulted in a foreign policy along these broad 
lines: (a) maintenance of the alliance with the USSR; (b) aid to 
indigenous Communist parties and groups in non-Communist Asian countries; 
(c) continued application of political warfare pressure against non-
Communist Asia, and intense military and political pressure against the 
Chinese Nationalists*; (d) diplomatic and propaganda efforts designed 
to enhance China's prestige and world status. Such a policy appears to 
be designed to further China's domestic and international objectives 
without provoking full-scale conflict with the West. It also appears 
to be based on the belief that time will work to Communist advantage in 
achieving China's international aspirations.

?00, Economic 
China is en underdeveloped agricultural opuntry with a population of 
600 million. China's 1952 estimated gross national product (GNP) of approx-
imately US $27 billion* was less than one-third of Soviet and about one-
fourteenth of US GNP. China's per capita GNP of less than roughly US $46 
is not quite equal to that of India and only one-quarter that of Js.pan. While 
there are the beginnings for a modern industrial development, the present 
contribution of the industrial sector to total output is small. The 
regime faces a formidable task in achieving its long-term goal of a 
modern industrial economy. 
By 1952 the Chinese national budget had risen to about a third of 
the GNP, a substantially lower proportion than in the case of the USSR. 
The two most important categories of budget expenditures during this 
period have been military outlay and capital investment. 
In 1949 production was extremely low. By the end of 1952, the 
Chinese had succeeded in general in rehabilitating the economy. Steel 
production exceeded by roughly one-quarter the highest levels reached 
between the years 1937 and 1945; grain and power production were slightly 
above this level; and coal output was about three-quarters of this level. 
The general rise in domestic production and trade, the great expansion 
of overland trade between the Soviet Bloc and China, and the movement of 
military supplies to Korea have increased demands on Chinese transport 
capacity. The regime has almost restored the rail net as it existed in 
1945. The ComMunists.have also brought to completion more than 1,600 
miles of new lines (as of the end of 1954). However, the rail net is 
still inadequate in many areas. Drastic measures are being amployad to 
stretch present capacity. Other forms of transport have played a smaller 
part in the regime's program. 
Although the Communists have made considerable progress in rehabilitating 
the Chinese economy, the basic pattern remains unchanged. Agriculture 
is still the primary activity and per capita production is stil3 low. More-
over, the geographic concentrations of economic activity within China 
remain substantially unchanged. 
On the other hand, the Communists have made a major change in the 
direction and composition of China's foreign trade. In 1938 practically 
all of this trade was with countries not now in the Soviet Bloc, while 
in 1952 the Soviet Bloc accounted for about 70 percent of China's foreign 
trade. In terms of constant dollars, 'China's total foreign trade in 1952 
Estimates based on 1952 data are used generally throughout. The 1954 
GNP will prove to be modestly greater, but changes since 1952 are 
believed not to have altered the general order of magnitudes or the 
relationships.

NOVRE: 
was roughly the same as in 1938. Imports of consumer goods in 1952 
constituted a smaller proportion of the total than in 1938. Imports of 
military supplies in 1952 constituted a much greater proportion of the 
total than in 1938. Imports of capital goods andAmdustrial.raw materials 
constituted about the same proportion in 1952 as in 1938. These changes 
in direction and composition have come about in part because of China's 
new political relationship with the Soviet Bloc, in part because of 
Western trade restrictions, and in part because of the requirements of 
China's programs of economic and military development. 
Pllitary 
The internal control and the international power position enjoyed 
by the Communist regime rest largely upon the power potential of China's 
military establishment. Within China, the armed forces hold a position 
of unique privilege and per in the state hierarchy. The loyalty of the 
mLitary forces adds greatly to the regime's power to coerce the people. 
The Chinese military establishment is at present the largest of any Asian 
nation, with over 2* million men in the field forces and an actual air-
craft strength of more than 1,500. These forces, supported by the USSR 
and greatly improved by the Korean War, have given the Comnunists an 
overwhelming military advantage over the countries of non-Communist Asia 
and have profoundly affected the over-all balance of power in Asia. 
The Chinese air capability was not fully tested in Korea. The 
Chinese have a fair capability in air defense, but only under good 
visibility conditions. The Chinese Air Force has some capability for 
tactical support operations. It alsu has a sizable force of light bombers, 
both jet and piston, and a few medium bombers. The Chinese Navy, though 
low in over-all operational effectiveness by US standards, hs demonstrated 
considerably improved effectiveness in recent small engagements in the 
Taiwan Straits area. Moreover, it now is believed to operate 2-5 sub-
marines. 
The major weakness of the Chinese armed forces is their lack of 
domestic supply facilities and their concomitant dependence upon the 
Soviet Union. At the present time this weakness would become critical 
in the event of a general war in the Far East whiCh involved both the 
Soviet Union and China. 
Estimate of Probable Developments  
The Chinese Communists have as their long-range goal the development 
of a Soviet-style state in China, with its own bases of economic and

military strength, and dominant in Eastern and Southern Asia. To this 
end they will proceed, as rapidly as possible, through the forced and 
ruthless measures characteristic of Communist regimes, to reorganize the 
social structure along Communist lines, improve the effectiveness of the 
administrative system, and develop the economy to the extent feasible. 
The regime will devote Substantial resources to modernizing and strengthening 
its armed forces as a power base for its foreign policy. 
Although the Chinese plans for economic development are not known 
in detail, it appears that these plans contemplate an increase in total 
output in 1957 to 20-25 percent above the 1952 level. Emphasis is placed 
upon increasing the output of the modern industrial sector, particularly 
heavy industry and transport. Fulfillment of the regime's economic plans 
depends upon increasing agricultural output while rigorously restricting 
consumption so as to provide the resources needed to support the industrial 
investment and military programs. A large part of the capital goods needed 
to fulfill the proaram will have to be obtained from the rest of the 
Soviet Bloc in return for Chinese exports. Available resources will have 
to be efficiently al]ocated to ensure that crucial sectors of the economy, 
such as transport, meet the demands generated by increasing production. 
. Barring a major crisis or other unpredictable event, it is probable 
that China will have attained by 1957 a GNP of roughly US $32 billion, 
an increase of 20-25 percent over the 1952 figure. It is probable that 
agricultural output will be about 10 percent higher than in 1952, and 
the output of the modern industrial sector of the economy 70-100 percent 
higher. The increases in individual industries (including transportation) 
will of course vary widely from this over-all rate of increase. Even 
by 1957, however, the Communists will only have begun the modernization 
of China's economy. The country will as a Whole remain agrarian and 
underdeveloped. 
It is probable that by 1957 the Chinese regime will have increased 
its administrative efficiency and have further tightened its mitrol over 
its people and resources, but the regime will not have been able sub-
stantially to alter traditional social patterns or to obtain more than 
passive acceptance from the bulk of the population. However, the regime's 
ability to direct and control China will probably not be significantly. 
impaired. Furthermore, the regime will probably be able to master leader-
ship problems that are likely to arise, even in the event of the death 
or retirement of Mao Tse-tung. 
It is probable that the military establishment will gain in strength 
and effectiveness during the period through 1957 as a result, of the regime's 
program of modernization and training. Soviet assistance will continue 
to be essential to the fulfillment of this program.

China's dependence on the USSR will probably not be significantly 
lessened by 1957, and maintenance of the alliance with the USSR will 
continue to be a dominant aspect of China's foreign policy. The Chinese 
Communist regime will continue to consolidate its political position, 
to gain in economic and military strength and by 1957 will be a more 
powerful force in world affairs than at present. Certain aspects of 
China's development will be used to support claims that time is on the 
Communist side in Asia. China's increased power and prestige will present 
a challenge to the influence of the Western nations in Asia, and to the 
Asian leadership aspirations of India an Japan.

SOVIET BLOC 
THE EUROPEAN SATELLITES* 
(See charts knowing these pages) 
Soviet Policy  
Soviet policy in the Satellites is directed toward developing 
them into a strong area of the Soviet empire which will increase 
Soviet power and strengthen the Soviet world position. Soviet con-
trol of the Satellites is based on the Soviet armed forces stationed 
in Eastern Europe, on the MVD (Soviet security services), on Soviet 
diplomatic, economic, and military missions in each Satellite, on 
individual Soviet citizens in key positions, and is exercised 
through the Satellite Communist parties and governments. 
The Satellite Communist parties, the leaders of which are 
approved by the Kremlin, constitute the principal instrumentality 
for implementing Soviet policy. The subservience of the Satellite 
Communist parties to the new Soviet rulers is complete. 
The Soviet Union exercises control over the economic development 
of the Satellites by fixing over-all production goals and priorities, 
and by supervising their foreign trade. Satellite economic plans are 
prepared in accordance with general policies issued by the Soviet 
Union, 
The Soviet pattern of intellectual, cultural, and religious 
life is being imposed upon the Satellites. The Satellite govern-
ments have a monopoly over the schools and all mass-information 
media and have brought church organizations under the control of 
the state. The educational system has been reorganized, and teaching 
staffs and libraries have been purged. Finally, the cultural in-
fluence and autonomy of family life has been disrupted. 
The USSR continues to maintain strong combat-ready forces, 
totalling an estimated 531,000 army troops, 24,000 security troops, 
and 1,800 aircraft (estimated actual strength) in the Satellites, 
-mostly in East Germany.

of 
The relationship between the Satellites and the USSR remains 
basically unchanged since the death of Stalin, but the new Soviet 
leadership has adopted a more flexible attitude toward the Sate-
llites under Malenkov and more recently, under Kruschev. These 
changes, , however, represent a refinement of method rather than a 
reduction in control. 
The Satellite leadership groups, which have become almost 
completely reliable through a continuous process of selection and 
purging, remain virtually unchanged. Moves taken by the Satellites 
to give a greater appearance of "collective" leadership are probably 
imitations of the Soviet pattern. The USSR continues to place great 
emphasis upon strengthening the Party position in the Satellite countries. 
The principal obstacle to the Sovietization of Eastern Europe is 
the continued opposition of the Satellite populations. However, the 
effectiveness of this opposition is severely constricted by the con-
trols imposed on every aspect of the lives of the people. There is 
virtually no organized active resistance and only little unorganized 
active resistance. On the other hand, passive resistance continues 
to be widespread and to constitute a serious drag on economic programs. 
The more prevalent forms of passive resistance are worker absenteeism, 
work slowdowns, crop-delivery evasion, increased church attendance, 
and whispering campaigns. 
The imminent approval of West German rearmament has caused the 
USSR to call at least one Satellite conference during the past six 
months, probably for the double purpose of establishing a solid 
political front and preparing for an integrated Satellite defense 
command to offset the growth of West German military strength. 
Economic  
In 1953, the Satellites undertook revisions of economic plans 
which -- like the plan revisions in the USSR -- were aimed at in-
creasing the production of agricultural commodities, especially food-
stuffs, and of manufactured consumer goods. These revisions were 
occasioned mainly by the adverse cumulative effects of overemphasis 
on heavy industry at the expense of agriculture and light industry. 
The various Satellite economies have now virtually reached the point 
in their development where manpower, raw materials and plant will be 
the controlling factors in their growth, rather than any shifts in 
emphasis promulgated by the Soviet leadership. 
Over-all Satellite industrial production was back to the 1938 
level by 1951 and in 1953 it was about 25 percent above the prewar 
level. The most impressive growth hasbeen in the production of 
machinery andequipment, chemicals, metals, energy, and building 
materials, generally in that order.

In contrast, Satellite agriculture has lagged seriously. 
Although the output of industrial crops returned to the prewar 
levels between 1948 and 1950, over-611 agricultural production has 
not yet regained the prewar level of production. Over-all agri-
cultural output in 1951 was an estimated 14 percent below the prewar 
level, but it slipped back in 1953 to approximately 21 percent below 
that level. 
Total agricultural collectivization continues to be the? ac-
knowledged long-term goal of Satellite governments. However, the 
Satellite leadersof East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and especially 
Hungary, have attempted to encourage production by private peasants 
by offering temporary concessions. 
By the end of 1953, the combined GNP (Gross National Product) 
of the Satellites had returned approximately to the level of 1938. 
Total Satellite GNP in 1953 was an estimated 45 billion of 1951 US 
dollars Or about two-fifths that of the USSR. In 1953 Poland, East 
Germany, and Czechoslovakia contributed over 80 percent of the 
total Satellite GNP, while Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria (in that 
order) accounted for less than 20 percent. 
The most important development in Satellite foreign trade has 
been its reorientation away from. Western countries toward the Bloc. 
The trade Of the Satellites with the West declined from more than 
four-fifths of their total trade before the war to less than one-
third in 1951 and 1952. During the same period, Satellite trade 
with the USSR increased from one-hundreth to over one-third of the 
total trade. 
The scientific and technical capabilities of Eastern Germany 
and Czechoslovakia, and to a lesser extent Hungary and Poland, 
constitute substantial additions to those of the USSR. In parti-
cular, the electronics and communications research capabilities of 
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, and the optics research 
capabilities of East Germany are of considerable value to the Soviet 
Union. 
The main contribution of the Satellites to the Soviet nuclear 
program is in uranium ores and concentrates. It is probable that 
East Germany is currently providing about half of Bloc production of 
uranium ores and concentrates. The other Satellites are less import-
ant sources. The USSR, however, is not dependent upon Satellite 
sources. If necessary, the Soviet atomic energy program could probably 
be supported at its present level of operation from internal Soviet 
sources alone.

Military 
The strength of the Satellite ground forces is estimated at 
1,115,000 men organized in 82 line divisions, of which 6 are 
armored and 13 medhanized. These forces are supplemented by Sate-
llite security troops which total about 306,000 men. The USSR 
controls these Satellite forces by direct Soviet staffing in Poland 
and by large Soviet military missions in all other countries. 
The Satellite armies are equipped largely with Soviet World 
War II material of good quality, but they require substantial 
amounts of additional supplies and equipment for sustained combat. 
They are dependent, upon the USSR for most of their heavy equipment. 
The questionable political reliability of the Satellite armies 
places a significant limitation upon their military usefulness. At 
present the Kremlin could probably not ray upon the majority of the 
Satellite armies in a general war except for employment in secondary 
roles or in a defensive capacity* 
The Satellite air forces now have an estimated TOO strength 
of 3,600 aircraft of all types (approximately 2,400 actual). Piston 
fighters continue to be replaced by jet fighters, and other equipment 
is being modernized. Training is being improved. 
The current operational capabilities of these forces are un-
evenly developed. Ftrthermore? the political reliability of the 
Satellite air forces, like that of the Satellite armies, is question-
able. 
Owing to their small size, their meager equipment, and the 
unreliability of the personnel, the Satellite navies lack the 
capability of making more than a minor contribution to Soviet naval 
strength. 
Estimate of Probable Developments. 
The Kremlin almost certainly regards the maintenance of the 
Soviet position in Eastern Europe as essential for: (a) safe-
guarding the military security of the USSR through possession of 
advanced bases and defensive positions outside Soviet frontiers; 
(b) adding to the economic and military resources of the USSR; 
(c) upholding the prestige of the USSR in its role as leader of 
the world Communist movement; and (d) checking the re-emergence 
of a powerful Germany allied with the west. It is likely, there-
fore, that the Kremlin will continue to push forward its long-term 
plans for integration of the Satellite countries into the Soviet 
system, though almost certainly not, during the next two years, to 
the point of outright incorporation into the USSR.

Soviet control of the Satellites remains virtually complete 
and is unlikely to diminish or to be successfully Challenged from 
within during the next two years. Although the principal Obstacle 
to the Sovietization of Eastern Europe is and will continue to be 
the opposition of the Satellite populations to Communism and Soviet 
domination, this opposition alone will not seriously impair Soviet 
control or threaten the stability of the Satellite governments. 
The revisions of Satellite economic plans have not altered 
the Kremlin's basic aim of increasing as rapidly as practicable the 
Satellitesl.contribution to Soviet economic power. The 1953 re-
visions were aimed primarily at removing the threats to future 
industrial growth by correcting the imbalances in the Satellite 
economies resulting from an overemphasis on heavy industry at the 
e:Lpense of agriculture and light industry. In essence, they provide 
for slowing down the expansion of heavy industry in 1954-1955 and 
for increasing the resources allotted to agriculture and consumer 
industries. Nevertheless, Satellite economic policies will still 
be strongly oriented toward development of heavy industry. At the 
same time, defense outlays will probably be maintained at approxi-
mately present or only slightly higher levels. These revisions 
have not resulted in any significant improvement in the standards 
of living and it is probable that the Satellite governments in two 
years time will be faced with much the same basic economic problem 
as at present. 
It is estimated that total Satellite GNP in 1953 was about 
two-fifths that of the USSR and that the Satellite.share-of total 
Bloc GNP will remain substantially unchanged through 1956. During 
this period the growth rate will probably average about 4 percent 
annually as compared with an average of 6 percent annually from 
1948 through 1953. 
The Satellite armed forces have become a substantial element 
in the balance of military power in Europe. It is probable that 
the Satellite armies will reach an over-all peacetime strength 
of approximately 1,265,000 men by mid-1955 and that no substantial 
increase is likely thereafter. It is estimated that by mid-1956 
the Satellite air forces will probably have a TOgeE strength of 
4,400, of which 2,450 will probably be jet fighters. During the 
next two years Czech and Polish production will probably be adequate 
to meet all Satellite peacetime requirements for jet fighters and 
ground-attack aircraft. It is likely that while the Satellite 
armed forces would probably fight well against traditional enemies, 
their reliability will remain sufficiently questionable during the 
next two years to place a significant limitation upon their military 
usefulness in event of general war,

E. REVIEW' OF CURRENT COMMUNIST ATTITUES. 
TOWARD GENERAL WAR* 
Chinese Communist Attitudes 
Chinese Communist propaganda and diplomatic representations demonstrate 
that the regime is strongly committed to the "liberation" of Formosa, the 
Pescadores, and the offshore islands. The Chinese Communist leaders give 
every indication of holding to this position. Moreover, Peiping has long 
regarded the continued presence in the Formosa Strait and on Formosa itself 
of a Nationalist China supported militarily by the US as at least a long-
range threat to its security. 
We believe that the Chinese Communists will refrain from courses of 
action which they estimate will involve them in full-scale warfare with 
the United States. 
However, we believe that the Chinese Communist attitude with respect 
to war is bold, sometimes boisterous, sometimes sophisticated, and that the 
Chinese Communists are therefore likely to test the upper limits of US 
tolerance with a variety of substantial military actions. Moreover, in the 
light of Chinese Communist activities in recent months and their reactions 
to the recent US policy pronouncements on the defense of Formosa and the 
Pescadores, we are not confident that the Chinese Communists clearly under-
stand which, if any," of the offshore islands the US would defend with its 
own forces, the circumstances under which the US would defend them, or the 
extent to which the defense would be carried. We believe, therefore, 
that the Chinese Cbmmunists may miscalculate the degree of risk which 
military actions on their part in this area would entail. 
In any event, we believe that the Chinese Communists will probably 
take military action against the offshore islands of sufficient scale 
to test US determination to halt their advance at some point. They might 
even*** attempt to take Quemoy, Matsu, or Nanchi regardless of whether 
they estimated that the US would participate in the defense of these islands. 
*This section contains the text of SNIE 11-4-55, "Review of Current Communist 
Attitudes Toward General War," 15 February 1955. NIE 11-4-54, "Soviet Capa-
bilities and Probable Courses of Action through Mid-1959," has dealt with this 
problem on a long-term basis. The above estimate is confined to a short-term? 
and is written primarily with reference to the situation respecting Formosa 
and the offshore islands.

They may not be convinced, in the light of the restraint exercised by US 
policy in Korea and Indochina, that the US would in fact react to attacks 
on the offshore islands by attacks on the mainland. Or, they may believe 
that the scale of any US reaction, even if it involved some attacks against 
the mainland, could be controlled by them, perhaps by diplomatic action at 
a critical juncture, in which they would count heavily on the restraining 
influence of US allies on US policy. Finally, they may believe that the US 
would not be willing to react to their actions in ways which could lead by 
stages to full-scale war against them, and perhaps eventually to war invol-
ving the USSR. If the Communist judgments did in fact prove to be mistaken, 
a series of actions and counteractions might be set in train which could 
bring about unlimited hostilities between Communist China and the US. 
Soviet Attitudes  
We believe that the Soviet leaders view general war as a hazardous ,gamble 
which could threaten the survival of their system. Accordingly, we believe 
that they will not deliberately initiate general war, and will try to avoid 
courses of action which in: their judgment would clearly involve substantial 
risk of general War. We believe that the recent changes in Soviet leader-
ship do, not indicate any increased disposition on the part of the regime to. 
risk such a war. 
,The Kremlin would.,not be deterred by the risk of general war from 
taking counteraction 'against any Western action which it regarded as, an 
imminent .threat to its security, ,.However, we see no evidence that he 
Kremlin estimates any recent action by the Western Powers, including 
progress so far made toward German rearmaments, as constituting such an 
imminent threat. 
The new Soviet leadership has express'd "full approval and support" for 
Chinese Communist mpolicy" with respect to Formosa and the offshore islands, 
but has left uncertain the extent to which the USSR would support a Chinese 
Communist effort to take Formosa and the offshore islands by military. action. 
We believe that Moscow might see certain advantages in clashes between Chinese 
Communist and US forces, at least as long as it believed that the clashes 
would be limited and localized. Both Soviet and Chinese Communist leaders 
probably estimate that strictly local cpnflict between the Chinese Communists, 
and the US, with the accompanying increase of international tensions, would 
serve their interests. They may estimate, for example, that the US in these 
circumstances would not have the support of its allies or of world opinion 
in a defense of the offshore islands, and that the result would be an in-
creasing isolation of the US. Under these circumstances they might believe 
that US progress toward its objectives elsewhere, including West German

rearmament, would be impeded, and that Soviet aims would thereby 
be served. 
However, the Kremlin would almost certainly be concerned that military 
conflict between the US and Communist China could not be kept limited and 
localized. It would almost certainly estimate that unlimited war between 
the US and Communist China not only would endanger the existence of the 
principal ally of the USSR, but also would involve substantial risk of 
spreading into general war. Hence, it would probably attempt to exert a 
restraining influence if it judged that appreciable danger of unlimited 
war between the US and Communist China were developing. If such war did 
occur, we believe that the USSR would support its ally in carrying on the 
war, but would not assist with its own forces to such an extent as, in its 
judgment, would cause the US to attack targets in Soviet territory. 
We believe that the USSR would openly intervene in the war if the Soviet 
leaders considered such intervention necessary to save the Chinese Communist 
regime, but the Soviet leaders would still try to confine the area of hos-
tilities to the Far Zast.* 
*The Director of Naval Intelligence and the Deputy 'tractor for Intelligence, 
The Joint Staff, believe that the following should be substituted for the 
last sentence: 
"Should the conflict progress so far that destruction of the Chinese 
Communist regime appeared imminent, we believe that the Soviet leaders 
would recognize that open intervention on their part against US forces 
sufficient to save the Chinese regime would involve grave risk of general 
war with the US. Their decision would probably be based on existing 
military, political, and economic strengths, with particular emphasis on 
the current disparities in nuclear stockpiles and delivery capabilities. 
We believe that the SOviet leaders would probably conclude that if 
they intervened, the conflict could not be confined to the Far East, 
and that Soviet strengths were insufficient to risk their own regime 
in this manner."

F. Probable Soviet Response 
to the Ratification of the Paris Agreements* 
ROLE OF GERMANY IN POSTWAR SOVIET POLICY 
The role that a restored Germany wouId eventually come to play 
in Europe has been a key issue in the postwar power Struggle between 
the USSR and the Western Powers. Despite the tremendous postwar 
growth of Soviet power (=pared with that of Germany, Soviet fear 
of Germany, sustained by the memory . of Nazi aggresSion?-has remained 
4 powerful force. Soviet policy in Europe since 1945 has been de-
signed to prevent any German settlement which would permit the align-
ment of a rearmed Germany on the aideof the Western Powers. This 
policy has apparently:been based on a belief that the addition of 
German power to the Western alliance would constitute a serious blow 
to patriot prestige, would seriously hamper further Communist ox-
pan ion in hrope, threaten Soviet control over the Satellites, and 
perhaps even Jeopardize the security of the USSR. 
PROBABLE SOVIET ESTIMATE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RATIFICATION 
The rearmament of even West Germany and its inclusion in the 
NATO alliance is almost certainly viewed by the Soviet leaders in 
a perspective of suda risks and danger*. They probably doubt that 
West German military forces would be kept within the proposed 
limits, and probably recognize that the net increase in the strength 
of the military combination which the USSR confront* in &rope would 
be greaterthan indicated by the simple addition Of a particular 
number of West German divisions, On the other hand? the Soviet 
leaders probably estimate that it would require :about three years 
to complete the proposed rearmament program in West Germany.' They 
would :probably consider, therefore, that the.potentialAhreat in-
volved in West GerMan rearmament would not emerge at an slay date 
and that there would remain time fpr possible counterbalancing 
developments.

PROBABLE SOVIET COURSES ()FACTION 
We believe it unlikely, therefore, that the initial Soviet 
response to ratification of the Paris Agreements would be based on 
the assumption that the security of the USSR was immediately en-
dangered. We believe that the USSR would take measures to improve 
its military position, would employ all political and subversive 
means to prevent or impede rearmament in West Germany and to 
obstruct its cooperation with its Western partners, and would 
attempt to compensate elsewhere, under conditions of limited risk, 
for the accretion to Western strength resulting from Wrest German 
rearmament. This general pattern of response would exclude a 
military action which, in the Soviet view, would involve sub-
stantial risk of general war. It would also exclude major con-
cessions which could provide the basis of a German settlement with 
the Western Powers. 
In conjunction with this general line of strategy, we do not 
believe that there would be any fundamental shift in the Soviet 
public posture, but the USSR might for a time adopt a more menacing 
attitude. In view of the vigorous campaign they have made against 
ratification, the Soviet leaders would probably take some of the 
measures they have threatened, notably the denunciation of the pacts 
with the UK and France, and the establishment of an East European 
defensive system. They might even invoke the terms of the Soviet-
Finnish Mutual Assistare Treaty of 6 April 1948. 
Attitude Toward Negotiations on Germany. We believe it unlikely 
that the USSR would participate in four-power negotiations on 
Germany for some time after ratification. Nevertheless, the Soviet 
leaders recognize that the German desire for unity will persist and 
that, as long as the USSR retains the capability to grant or withhold 
unification, it may be able to inhibit the pace and reduce the scale 
of German rearmament through negotiations, or the promise of negotia-
tion. For these reasons, we believe that the USSR would be willing, 
after an interval, to negotiate further on Germany. However, it is 
highly unlikely that the USSR would agree to German unification on 
terms that would be acceptable to the West. 
Berlin. Since we estimate that the Soviet response to ratification 
would not include any moves which would entail substantial risk of 
war, we do not believe that the Soviet leaders would take strong 
measures to force the Western Powers out of Berlin. Nevertheless, 
West Berlin border controls would probably be tightened and there 
would probably be some harassment of Western access to the city by 
1 April 1955

way of probing Western determination to maintain the Berlin position. 
Such moves might be associated with an East German program to build 
up defenses, and would probably be carried out by the East German 
regime. In consequence there is likely to be some increase of tension 
over Berlin in the period immediately following ratification. We 
believe, however, that the Soviet leaders would be concerned not to 
allow such a situation to get out of hand. 
Austria. In the initial period following ratification, the Soviet 
authorities, alleging violation of zonal agreements for Austria, 
may re-establish zonal border controls, and even threaten to parti-
tion the country. We believe it unlikely, hol4ever? that the Soviet 
leaders would permit any such actions to go beyond the stage of 
demonstration, or that they would take any course which would limit 
their freedom of action in using the Austrian issue for future 
bargaining with the West. 
Bloc Defense Measures. Among the measures which the USSR would prob-
ably take to improve its military posture would be the creation of 
the joint command structure for Eastern Ehrope forecast at the recent 
Moscow conference of Bloc states. We also believe it possible that 
the USSR would strengthen Soviet forces in the Satellites, par-
ticularly in East Germany. Satellite forces may likewise be 
strengthened. The East German forces are likely to be unveiled as 
a national military establishment and strengthened somewhat, possibly 
by the introduction of conscription. 
The USSR would probably accelerate the strengthening of its own 
armed forces if German rearmament showed signs of successful imple-
mentation. However, we see no indication, even in the most recent 
Soviet budget, of an intention to begin an early rapid build-up of 
Soviet armed strength. Since the Soviet leaders probably believe 
that ratification of the Paris Agreements poses a potential rather 
than an immediate threat to Soviet security, we believe that Soviet 
policy will continue to emphasize long-term qualitative improvement 
rather than short-term enlargement of its military forces. 
If at any stage in the process of implementing the Paris Agree-
ments the various courses of action described above did not, in the 
Soviet view, sufficiently offset the developing threat of German 
rearmament, we believe the Soviet leaders would almost certainly 
take further measures in the attempt to counter this accretion to 
the strength of the West. These measures would include primarily 
a sharp build-up of Soviet and Satellite military capabilities.

They might also include more threatening courses of action against 
Berlin, or in the Far East, or elsewhere, with the purpose of 
arousing fear of nuclear war in the West and causing Western peoples 
to demand that their governments follow a cautious policy. We 
believe that, at this stage, the USSR would adopt bolder courses of 
action than it had previously, but would avoid those which in its 
judgment clearly entailed the probability of general war. 
ALTERNATIVE SOVIET COURSE OF ACTION 
It is possible that the Soviet leaders may at any time decide 
that they cannot adequately offset the developing threat of German 
rearmament. In this case, they would be confronted with two broad 
alternatives: (a) to undertake an early showdown with the Western 
Powers on this subject, possibly including the use of force in-
volving grave risks of general war; (b) to attempt to negotiate a 
settlement in which both Western and Soviet troops would be with-
drawn and a reunified Germany would be neutralized with controlled 
armaments. We believe the USSR would reject the first alternative 
as too hazardous a gamble under currently prevailing circumstances. 
In view of the grave disadvantages entailed, we believe the second 
alternative is only a possibility, but it might be adopted if the 
Soviet leaders believed it offered the only means, short of general 
war, to prevent the development of a critical threat to the security 
of the USSR. We believe, however, that the Kremlin would be more 
likely to adopt the courses of action described in the preceding 
paragraph.

? Communist Courses of Action in Asia * 
Through 1957 ** 
Although the USSR possesses preponderant influence in the Sino-
Soviet partnership, the main outlines of Communist policy in Asia are 
almost certainly determined jointly by consultation between Moscow and 
Peiping, not by the dictation of Moscow. Chinese Communist influence 
in the Sino-Soviet alliance will probably continue to grow. it is 
estimated that such frictions as may exist between Communist China and 
the USSR will not impair the effeetivenese of their alliance during the 
period of this estimate. 
The Communists will attempt to impress free world countries, 
particularly Japan and the Asian neutrals, with their willingness to 
negotiate outstanding issues. In so doing, they will probably make 
proposals from settlements which may be attractive to BOMA non-Communist 
nations but contrary to US interests, and, as at Geneva, may on occasion 
make significant procedural and tactical concessions. Communist China 
may attempt to negotiate, on the basis of the Chou-Nehru five points, 
a series of mutual nonaggression coexistence understandings with most 
of its Asian neighbors. In these efforts, the Communists will continue 
to seek greater recognition and acceptance of the Peiping regime, and 
to hold out the promise that Asian and world problems can be solved by 
? Great Power deliberation if Peiping is permitted to participate therein. 
/n addition, the wisdom of closer diplomatic ties with Peiping will be 
impressed upon non-Communist Asia by constant exaggeration of Communist 
China's strength, progress, and peaceful intent. The Communists will 
almost certainly make every effort to publicize the attractive possibility 
for non-Communist nations of increased trade with the Bloc. It is 
probable that Communist China will continue to exchange trade missions 
with many non-Communist countries and to negotiate trade agreements, both 
formal and informal, which express hopes of a high level of trade and 
disapproval of trade restrictions.

Ceylon, and all of mainland Asia east of (but not including) Iran

The Chinese Communists will continue their efforts to subvert and 
exploit the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The degree of Communist 
success in exploiting the overseas Chinese will be strongly influenced 
by the over-all fortunes of Communist China. However, because the usefulness 
of most of these Chinese is limited (their members are apolitical, culturally 
isolated, and disliked by the indigenous populations), the Communists will 
probably concentrate their activities primarily on the governments and 
indigenous populations of Southeast Asian countries. 
Communist China will continue to regard the eventual "liberation" 
of the offshore islands, the Pescadores, and Taiwan as a basic national 
objective essential to its security, characterizing the issue as an 
internal affair in which foreign interference will not be tolerated. 
Hence, this issue will continue to present the greatest danger of large-
scale warfare in Asia. 
? It is estimated that as long as the US remains firmly committed 
to defend Taiwan and the Penghuss the Chinese Communists will almost 
certainly not attempt to invade through at least 1955. Short of invading 
Taiwan, the Communists will almost certainly concentrate on an interim 
policy of subversion and other means of softening up Taiwan for ultimate 
takeover. An intensive propaganda campaign designed to induce defection 
by offering amnesty to all save Chiang Kai-shek has already begun. 
Available Chinese Communist strength in place is such that the Chinese 
Communists have the present capability -- at the risk of heavy casualties --
to seize the Quemoy and Matsui groups if defended solely by the Chinese 
Nationalist forces. The Chinese Communists will probably undertake air, 
naval, and artillery attacks against Quemoy and the Matsus and attempt 
to seize poorly defended island outposts within the area. They will also 
seek to erode Nationalist ability and determination to hold these islands, 
and to probe US intentions. Should they become convinced the US was 
determined to prevent the seizure of an island, they mould probably be 
deterred from attempting dldh a seizure in the near future. 
It may not be possible for the Chinese Cbmmunists? as a result of 
their probing actions alone, to ascertain the full extent of a possible 
US counteraction to an attempt at seizure of an offshore island. If the 
US did not respond to initial probing actions, the Chinese Communists 
might estimate that the US would not in fact commit its own forces to 
the defense of the island. Or, even though there was sane US military 
reactiem to a probing attack, the Chinese Communists might still estimate 
that US counteraction to an actual invasion of offshore islands would 
remain limited and localized. Or, the Chinese Communists might estimate 
that they could overrun an offshore island before effective US counter-
action could be brought to bear and that the US would not subsequently 
initiate major hostilities in order to regain the captured territory.

In any of these circumntances, we believe the Chinese Communists would 
probably attempt to seize or complete the seizure of the offshore islands:* 
It is estimated that the Vietminh now feels that it can achieve 
control over all Vietnam without initiating large-scale warfare. Accordingly, 
it is estimated that the Communists will exert every effort to attain power 
in South Vietnam through means short of war. Should South Vietnam appear 
to be gaining in strength or should elections be postponed over Cbmmunist 
objections, the Cammunists probably would step up their subversive and 
guerrilla activities in the South and if necessary would infiltrate 
additional armed forces in an effort to gain control over the area. How-
ever, it is estimated that they would be unlikely openly to invade South 
Vietnam, at least prior to July 1956, the date set for national elections. 
Elsewhere in Asia (the Nationalist-held offshore islands and South 
Vietnam excepted as per the above paragraphs), the Communists will probably 
not, during the period of this estimate, initiate new local military 
actions with identifiable Soviet, Chinese Communist? North Korean, or 
Viet Minh forces. 
The Asian non-Communist countries are dangerously vulnerable to the 
expansion of Communist power and influence because of their military 
weaknesses and consequent fear of antagonizing Communist China, their 
political immaturity and instability, the social and economic problems 
they face, and the prevalence of anti-Western nationalism. The effect 
of the Geneva COnference and subsequent events has been to increase this 
vulnerability. Accordingly, the' Communist leaders almost certainly estimate 
that they have a wide area of maneuver open to them in Asia in which they 
can safely continue efforts at subversion and support of armed insurrection 
without incurring unacceptable US counteraction. 
COmmunist policy during the period of this estimate will probably seek 
to continue a stabilized situation in Korea. It is estimated that the chief 
features of this policy will be: (a) to refrain from renewing hostilities in 
Korea, but to be militarily prepared for a resumption of hostilities; (b) 
to refuse to accept any settlement in Korea Whidh either endangers continued 
Communist control of North Korea or precludes hope of eventual COmmunist 
control of All Korea; (c) to rehabilitate North Korea and to strengthen its 
military and economic power; and (d) to attempt to weaken the ROK by 
infiltration and subversion.

Japan and India will become increasingly important targets for 
Cbmmunist ?coexistence policies and propaganda. It is estimated that 
the Communists will continue their efforts to undermine Japants stability 
and present orientation and will seek an expansion of economic and cultural 
relations. They will make greater effort to create the impression that 
their terms for a resumption of diplomatic relations with Japan are flexible, 
and may offer to conclude a formal peace settlement during the period of 
this estimate. It is estimated that the Communists will focus increasing 
attention on India in an effort to insure at least its continued neutralism, 
and if possible to bring it closer to the Communist Bloc. However, even at 
the expense of friction with India, Communist China will seek to increase 
its influence in the Indo-Tibetan border area. 
Communist influence in Indonesia has grown considerably since the 
present government took office in July 1953, and as a result of recent 
political developments the government is increasingly dependent upon 
Communist parliamentary support for its continued existence. It is 
estimated that the Indonesian Communists will probably continue to support 
the present government or, if it falls, to work for the establishment of 
another government in which they would participate or in which their 
influence mould be strong. They will try, through both constitutional 
and illegal means, to expand their influence in the bureaucracy and the 
armed forces, and to prevent the formation of a unified and effective 
opposition. They will probably also attempt to strengthen their capabilities 
by the organization of a Party-controlled armed force. In general, however, 
they will probably avoid highly aggressive tactics in the near future, lest 
these provoke counteraction by the military or by domestic opposition 
groups before their own strength has become great enough to deal with it.

C. KOREA 
North-Korea 
Political  
The political situation in North Korea remains stable. The 
Soviet Union continues its dominant role in North Korean political 
affairs, although Chinese Communist influence appears to have in-
Greased during the Korean war, Pyongyang readily accepts Peiping's 
aid, and the first Chinese Communist Ambassador since 1950 has 
recently presented his credentials at Pyongyang. There is no re-
liable evidence of friction over North Korea. 
North Korean proposals on unification continue to demonstrate 
that the Communists would agree to a settlement only on terms in-
suring their control of all Korea. Continuing to woo South Korea 
with the line that the 38th parallel is an *unnatural, man-made 
obstacle" which can be eliminated easily, North Korea has offered 
to supply the south with electric power, ferrous metals, coal, and 
machinery if Seoul would accept a plan for fostering economic inter-
course between the two nations *without delay." Recent propaganda 
beamed to South Korea has urged the withdrawal of all foreign forces 
from Korea and has stressed the need for the "Koreans themselves" to 
neek unification. 
Economic 
With Sino-Soviet Bloc technical and materiel aid, North Korea 
is beginning to show some progress in rehabilitation. The regime, 
however, is plagued by labor and material Shortages, and most major 
industries remain inoperable. The goals of the current Three-Year Plan 
call for a 50 percent increase over 1949 in total industrial produc-
tion, an approximate doubling of 1949 consumer goods output, and 
a 20 percent increase in agricultnral production. 
The vote for industrial production was reportedly fulfilled 
100 percent for the first half of 1954, but it is unlikely that the 
1956 goal can be attained. The doubling of consumer goods output, 
however, does seem possible.

Since the ArMiStiC0.9 North Korean strength has increased from 281,000 
to 332,000s concurrently, Chinese strength in Korea has been reduced 
from 872,000 to 559,000 as of February 1955. The withdrawal of an 
additional 73,000 Chinese Ommunist troops from Korea during the 
period 19 February-4 Mardi has also been reported. 
The North Korean Aix Force, the bulk of which has been moved 
from Manchuria to North Korea despite the trace terms, comprises an 
estimated 340 aircraft, including 170 jet fighters and 40 jet bombers. 
The Communists in Korea retain the capability to attack with 
little warning, but their axrrent dispositions and attitude do not 
indicate an intention to resume hostilities. 
EStimate of Probable Developments* 
General Communist policy with respect to Korea will probably bes 
(a) to refrain from renewing hostilities in Korea, but to be militarily 
prepared for a resumption of hontilitiess CO to refuse to accept any 
settlement in Korea which either endangers continued Communist con-
trol of North Korea or precludes hope of eventual Communist control 
of all Koreas (c) to rehabilitate North Korea and to strengthen its 
military and economic powers and (d) to attempt to weaken the ROK by 
infiltration and subversion. 
South Korea  
Political 
President Rhee's primary aim remains the unification of Korea, 
which he believes can only be achieved by a renewal of hostilities. 
He is motivated by a genuine concern over what he considers to be a 
weakened Western military position in Asia, by the continued Communist 
threat in Korea, by fears that the US is abandoning South Korea, and 
by a belief that American assistance to Japan constitutes a threat 
to his country. He also has a deep-seated conviction that "pro-
Japanese" American officialdom is not sympathetic to South Korea. 
In keeping with these views, Rhea has criticized American strategic 
concepts in Asia including the withdrawal of American troops, has 
renewed his agitation for ending UN control and inspection of the 
South Korean armed forces, and has demanded a larger military establish-
ment.

The ROK has extended considerable encouragement and sympathy 
to Nationalist China, but has signed no military pact with it. 
.However? should the US become involved in hostilities over the 
Taiwan issue, Rhee would probably hope to initiate military action 
in Korea or at least precipitate incidents along the demilitarized 
zone. 
Relations with Japan remain unsatisfactory. Although the 
resumption of ROK-Japanese negotiations for the normalization of 
relations between the two countries appears likely, little progress 
is expected ap long as lhee's bitter and vocal distaste for Japan 
prevails. 
? Seoul has adamantly resisted North Korean blandishments for 
unification talks and cultural and economic intercourse, and has 
continued to assert that it is still at war with North Korea. How-
ever, there are indications that the general population in South 
Korea is receptive to proposals for liberalized' contacts with the 
North and pleased by the prospects of continued peace. 
Political instability has increased since the passage of Rhees 
constitutional amendments which provides (1) a means whereby Rhee 
can run for a third term (2) reorganization of the executive branch 
to assure supremacy over the legislature; and (3) a more stable 
succession in case of Rheela death or incapacitation. These 
amendments were bitterly opposed, and the legality of legislative 
approval is disputed by the political opposition. Subsequently, 
There have been some defections from Rheegs Liberal Party, which is 
wracked by internal dissension. In addition, anti-Rhee leaders 
have tried to create a unified opposition party. To counteract these 
difficulties Rhee has ordered a rejuvenation of the Liberal Party 
and has checked a number of political aspirants for governmental 
control, 
Rheels health is relatively good considering his advanced age 
and recent surgery. However the vary real possibility of his death 
or incapacitation for office has kept Korean politics in a state of 
constant unrest in anticipation of the expected power struggle. In 
any event, the military are certain to play a major part in the

inevitable.

will remain unfavorable for the development of clear US-ROK under-
standings, for the effective utilization of US economic assistance, 
or for a significant improvement in ROK-Japanese relations. It is 
unlikely that Rhee will go so far as to launch an attack against 
North Korea, but the possibility of Rheegs attempting to involve 
the US in renewed hostilities in Korea cannot be dismissed.

D. JAPAN* 
General 
Since the war, Japan has been unable to develop a sense of 
national purpose, and as a result, its leaders and people have 
tended to drift aimlessly without agreement on objectives and 
without resolution to settle the nation's pressing problems. 
Although a majority of the Japanese probably support the principle 
of cooPeration with the US and the Free World, their attitudes re-
flect confusion arising from defeat in mar and disruption of na-
tional values, uncertainty over Japan's international role, dis-
trust of foreigners, suspicion of US reliability and motives, and 
susceptibility to leftist propaganda. Many important groups in 
Japan have neutralist and leftist thought patterns, partly as a 
continuing reaction to Japan's undemocratic and militarist past. 
Japan has developed only a weak sense of partnership with the 
US and of common interest with the democratic nations. Many 
Japanese look upon US actions and motives as entirely selfish, with 
little regard for the interest of Japan. The View is strong in 
Japan that the US considers Japan indispensable to its security, and 
therefore Japan can get what it wants from the US. 
Political 
Moderate conservative forces are dominant in Japan, and have 
consistently secured about 2/3's of the Vote in recent national elec-
tions. However, they are split, and efforts to achieve unity over 
the past three years have failed. The result has been ineffective 
government. 
There has been some revival of ultra-rightist views although 
they have little representation in the Diet. 
This section is largely an extract from "Japan's Situation," an 
appendix dated 14 March 1955 to a draft NSC paper entitled "US 
Policy Toward Japan," constitutes the Conclusions of NIE 41-54, 
"Probable Developments in Japan through 19570? 10 August 1954.

Left-of-center groups are strong in Japan but, like the con-
servatives, they are split by marked differences over policy and 
personality but have cooperated closely in efforts to weaken the 
conservatives. 
Communists are weak politically in Japan and are unlikely to 
attain significant parliamentary strength. The Communists are in-
fluential, however, through their infiltration of the bureaucracy, 
the leftist parties, educational institutions, labor unions, and 
information media. The Communist Party also retains a large 
potehtial for sabotage, last demonstrated in the May Day riot in 
1952. 
There has been an inevitable reaction of all political groups 
against the Occupation reforms and against US guidance. Among the 
conservatives this takes the form of a drive for revision of the 
Occupation-sponsored constitution to increase the power of the 
central government and make for a more highly disciplined populace. 
The Socialists oppose these changes and with their control of one-third 
of the seats in the Lower House of the Diet, they block constitu-
tional amendment. 
Economic 
Japan has perhaps the poorest economy of all major powers, with 
the fewest natural resources, the most critical import reqUirements, 
and the heaviest pressure of population on productive land. 
Japanfs basic economic problem is that of providing employment 
and adequate living standards for its growing population through 
expansion of foreign trade and development of its limited domestic 
resources. Japan has had a large international trade deficit through-
out the postwar period which has been offset by roughly $5 billion of 
US economic aid and military expenditures. Although considerable 
success resulted from the governments deflationary and austerity 
policies inaugurated in late 19530 the long-term economic outlook is 
adverse. 
Pressures in Japan for higher levels of trade with Communist 
countries, particularly Communist China, are increasing and the 
Hatoyama government can be expected to make a determined effort to 
have trade controls relaxed vis-a-vis Communist China probably by 
the elimination of the differential between the COCOM and CHINCOM 
lists.

Page 3 of L. 
The government's ability and willingness to hold the line 
at this point will, in part, be determined by Japan's ability to 
solve its economic problem mitain the Free World. This, in turn, 
depends to a large extent on the success of Free World efforts to 
raise levels of economic activity in the underdeveloped countries 
of Asia and to promote Japanese exports through the relaxation of 
tariff and other trade barriers. Even if Japan undertakes sub-
stantial trade with China, its economic tics and dependence on the 
free nations will remain comparatively much stronger. 
The government's willingness and ability to develop its defense 
capabilities will also depend largely on the solution of its economic 
problem. 
Defense 
For a number of reasons Japan is unwilling to move rapidly on 
the problems of rearming. It is not convinced that it is in serious 
danger of attack or that its national interests are at stake in the 
present crisis. It desperately fears involvement in war and is in-
clined to-think that its danger of involvement is less if its forces 
are small. It claims it cannot afford to build a large force. It 
fears revival of a military clique, and there remains much anti-mar 
feeling among women and youth. 
. , 
Moreover, the Japanese government, partly at US urging, is 
committed to a deflationary program which required the curtailment 
of governmental expenditures and the maintenance of a one trillion 
yen budget ceiling. 
The unwillingness to moire rapidly on defense has made Japan's 
defense relations with the US a major issue in Japan's domestic 
politics. Most Japanese feel that the US has pushed too hard on 
rearmament and expects Japan to put more money into defense than 
Japan can afford. 
Foreign Affairs  
Japan has established diplomatic relations with most of free 
Asia, but the spirit of reciprocal interest and cooperation is weak. 
Nationalist China almost alone of the free nations of Asia wants to 
cooperate with and enlist the support of Japan, while Japan, although 
aware of the present value of its trade with Formosa, feels there is 
little future to Nationalist China and it must not get more involved.

Japan is taking steps to improve relations with the Soviet 
Union and Communist China. It desires to eliminate frictions with 
these powerful neighbors and to increase trade and cultural con-
tacts with them with a view to establishing full diplomatic rela-
tions. It believes that it can develop good relations with the 
Communist nations without harming its close cooperation with the 
US and the free nations and that it is in its national interest 
to be able to bargain more freely with both sides. 
Estimate of Probable Developments  
Through 1957, Japan will not be in a position to play a leading 
or stabilizing role in Asian affairs. Assuming a continuation of US 
assistanoe, however, it is likely that Japan will slowly gain in 
strength. 
Japan will almost certainly continue to be economically and 
militarily dependent on the US. It will therefore continue to 
avoid any action that might seriously jeopardize its alignment with 
the US, in spite of numerous frictions arising out of its condition 
of dependence. 
Within these limitations, Japan will attempt to pursue a more in-
dependent foreign policy, notably in terms of establishing more 
active and extensive economic and political relations with lommunist 
China and the U6SR. There will probably be some growth in neutralist 
sentiment, an increasing spirit of nationalism, and a continuing 
critical appraisal of US policy. 
Moderate conservative elements will probably continue to dominate 
Japanese government and politics, although factional rivalry among the 
conservative elements will probably hamper governmental effectiveness. 
Although factionalism will limit socialist influence, the two groups 
will probably retain sufficient strength to act as a break on the 
governmentls increased conservatism. 
Although the Japanese Communist Party is not likely to gain 
substantial parliamentary strength, it will continue to exercise an 
imnortant influence through its ability to aggravate popular griev-
ances and to exploit and infiltrate mass organizations of the non-
Communist left. The Communists will probably be able to maintain 
their underground organization but not to increase significantly 
their potentialities for sabotage and subversion. 
Assuming US military assistance, the Japanese Government will 
continue to rearm gradually. By 1957, it is probable that Japan 
will have military forces capable of making a substantial contribution 
to its defense, but by no means adequate to assume full responsibility 
therefor. Japan will be reluctant to accept military commitments 
beyond the immediate defense of Japanese territory and will hesitate 
to join any regional defense system.

FAR EAST 
E. 'Taiwan* 
Political 
The National Government of the Republic of China is an anomaly. 
It exists only because of US support. The National Government continues 
to be acknowledged by a majority of the states of the world as the legal 
government of China, yet it controls only a few islands, and its inter-
national position is being eroded by the growing power of Communist China. 
Nationalist China is an armed camp, maintaning a disproportionately 
large military establishment and focusing its resources and its purpose 
on a future invasion of the continent. Yet its economy is incapable of 
supporting this military establishment, and its armed fomes are not capable 
by themselves of undertaking the desired invasion or even successfully 
defending the territories they now hold. There is no immediate prospect 
that its hope for an early return to the mainland will materialize; 
meanwhile its armed forces grow older. The regime has enjoyed US support 
and on 2 December 1954 signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with the US. How-
ever, the US has not to date underwritten Nationalist aspirations to 
return to the mainland, and in recent public utterances has indicated 
ap unwillingness to do so. It is staunchly anti-Communist, yet it is 
an important source of dissension in the non-Communist world. 
The National Government is superimposed upon a native Taiwanese 
population from which its interests often diverge and which outnumbers 
the mainlanders 8 million to 2 million. The National Government claims 
to speak for the Chinese people everywhere, yet its leadership and 
political programs have not attracted significant support from among 
mainland or overseas Chinese, and the Taiwanese, themselves of Chinese 
descent, have no effective voice in the determination of national policies. 
Nationalist China is in essence a one-party state; authority is 
centralized in the hands of a few, and ultimate political power resides 
in the hands of the leader of the Kuomintang Party and head of the govern-
ment, Chiang Kai-shek. The Generalissimo dominates the political scene 
not so much through direct fiat as through indirection and the skillful 
balancing of personalities and cliques within the government. His 
traditional and skillful practice of divide-and-rule is probably responsible 
in large measure for Taiwan's present degree of political stability. 
At the same time Chiang's methods are largely responsible for such con-
tinuing Nationalist shortcomings as the retention of incompetents in 
high positions, a general failure to delegate authority to subordinate 
political and military officials, and factionalism within the ruling circles.

The struggle among traditional mainland factions for political 
influence has persisted, but political rivalry centers at present chiefly 
around Vice President Chen Chteng and the Generalissimo's Moscow-educated 
elder son, Chiang Ching-kuo. The power of these two figures is believed 
to be approximately equal at the present time. 
Antipathy is not strong at present between the native Taiwanese 
and the Chinese mainlanders on Taiwan. In short, the native islanders 
tolerate the National Government, and wish it every success in its efforts 
to return to the mainland. 
On the surface the general state of Cainese Nationalist morale 
remains fairly good; despite recent events, it is not appreciably different 
from what it has been for some time. Communist subversive activity on 
the island is not of major proportions, and apparently is being effectively 
suppressed. Nevertheless, the Nationalist regime has undergone many 
frustrations and disappointments during its six years on Taiwan, and 
adverse psychological forces are almost certainly at work beneath the 
surface of Nationalist society. 
Economic 
Owing to wartime and postwar dislocations, Taiwan no longer has a 
viable economy. Since 1945, economic development of the island has been 
largely neglected because of the National Government's preoccupation with 
political and military affairs. 
Taiwan's economy is basically agrarian, with nearly 60 percent of the 
population engaged in agriculture, while only about 5 percent are engaged 
in industry. The prospects for agricultural expansion are limited. 
Undeveloped resources outside of agriculture are also limited. Known 
mineral resources are meager, although coal production meets the island's 
current needs and could be expanded to support a growth in industry. 
Formosa could also greatly expand its hydroelectric facilities. The 
development of any of these resources, however, would regaire heavy 
initial investments. 
The National Government hasnotaeriously attacked its long-term 
economic problems, partly because of its preoccupation with immediate 
problems and partly because of its unwillingness to accept the prospect 
of a long exile on Taiwan. Government enterprises, which account for 
two-thirds of all activity in industry, mining, and transport operate 
inefficiently, and, in many instances, at a loss. Domestic private 
investors have received no real mcouragement, while foreign private 
investment has been limited by legal provisions. Other Nationalist 
policies have tended to decrease production, discourage investment 
in agriculture, reduce farrimarketing, and hamper exports.

In spite of these shortcomings, the economic situation, with US 
assistance,* has substantially improved, as compared with the chaos of 
1949. Between 1949 and 1953 industrial output increased from 74 percent 
to 140 percent of the 1941 level, while agricultural output rose from 
less than 80 percent to 93 percent of the 1935-1939 level. Effective 
budgetary controls have halted the growth in government expenditures, 
although government receipts exclusive of US aid did not rise in real 
terms between 1950 and 1953. Also inflationary pressures have been eased. 
However, a balance of trade deficit persists; in 1953 it amounted to 
$69 million. 
Military  
The present strength of the ground forces is 422,000, of Which about 
285,000 are effective combat troops organized into 24 infantry and 2 
armored divisions. 
The army's effectiveness is impaired by a failure of the highest 
command echelons to delegate authority and by a political officer system 
which interferes with command functions. However, a recent reorganization 
integrated logistical support into the field army structure. This move 
promises more effective control of supply and resupply and consequently 
should better provide effective support to fighting units. Progress 
is also being achieved in raising the level of combat efficiency of the 
Nationalist Army. Leadership at the lower levels is improving steadily. 
Training has also improved. Troop morale is considered satisfactory. 
Based on status of personnel, equipment, training, and quality of leader-
ship, MAG rates infantry units at approximately 50 percent combat effective. 
The navy includes two destroyers, five destroyer escorts, and a 
number of smaller craft. 
The air force, with 410 combat aircraft (including 117 jet fighters) 
is probably superior to the other services in equipment, morale, and 
leadership. However, it is far weaker than the Chinese Communist Air 
Force. 
Deliveries of US aid goods in 1953, exclusive of military supplies, 
totalled US $83 million, amounting to 38 percent of Taiwan's receipts 
of goods and services fran abroad, and, if converted at the average 
black market foreign exchange rate, equalling 62 percent of the net 
revenues of all levels of government. US economic aid funds, exclusive 
of Mall costs disbursed on behalf of the National Government between 
July 1950 and August 1954, totalled approximately US $300 million.

Estimate of Probable Develo ments 
The future fortunes of the National Government will be determined 
to a very large extent by US policy, and will depend increasingly upon 
the scale and character of US aid and support. 
Should US aid continue at approximately present levels, the prospects 
of the National Government for maintaining domestic stability between 
now and mid-1956 cpear good. Communist influence and subversion will 
probably continue to be vigorously suppressed, although sporadic cases 
of Communist infiltration and of defections may occur, particularly as 
time passes and there is growing disillusionment over prospects of a 
return to the mainland. Nationalist leadership will irobably not succeed 
in creating any new and dynamic political program. 
Although there will be some improvements, the fundamental economic 
weaknesses of Taiwan will probably became more acute by mid-1956. Because 
of a rising population and a leveling off of current expansion of industrial 
and agrieultural production, Nationalist China by mid-1956 will probably 
be more dependent than at present upon US economic aid for its continued 
existence. 
A return to the mainland will continue to be the centra objective 
of the National Government and the focus of its fbreign and domestic 
policies. The National Government will continue to believe that US 
support for such a return will not be likely unless and until other 
circumstances impel the US to engage Corrnunist China or the Communist 
bloc in a major war. Nationalist leadership will almost certainly not 
become reconciled to an insular future, nor will it concentrate principally 
on the development of Taiwan. In this connection the islands of Quemoy 
and Matsu have recently assumed such importance in the eyes of the Nationalists 
that their loss would be a severe blow to morale, irrespective of the 
circumstances or conditions under which the loss occurred. In any event, 
however, we believe that the blow would not be so great as to cause the 
Nationalists immediately to fold up. We believe that they would continue 
their resistance to Communist pressures, at least for a time. The sub-
sequent behavior of the Nationalists would depend in large measure on 
specific US actions with respect to Taiwan, and on US reactions to 
subsequent Communist moves, 
The Cninese Nationalist armed forces remain an important source 
of non-Communist military strength in the Far East. During the next two 
years their combat capabilities will appreciably improve. However, they 
will remain greatly outweighed by those of Soviet-aided Communist China. 
Outside logistic, air, and naval support will continue to be required 
to defend Taiwan or the Pescadores against full-scale Communist invasion.

Nationalist China's international position will continue greadually 
to deteriorate. A few foreign states will probably recognize the Chinese 
Communist regime during the next two years, and Nationalist China's right 
to membership in international bodies, including the UN, will come under 
increasingly serious challenge. In the face of a deteriorating inter-
national position and unimproved prospects for return to the mainland, 
the National Government's task of maintaining its own morale and that 
of its armed forces and the former mainlanders on Taiwan will become 
increasingly difficult. 
Twelve million overseas Chinese are one of the few sources from 
which the Chinese Nationalists might draw additional support. However, 
little significantly increased support from among the overseas Chinese 
will be forthcoming, largely because of the probable relative power 
of Communist Cnina and Nationalist China. 
If, beyond the next two years, the adverse trends described above 
are not reversed, the strength and international position of the 
Republic of China will probably deteriorate, even assuming a continuation 
of US support at approximately present levels.

Political 
The recent success of Premier Diem in military operations against 
the Binh Xuyen, and in his stand against Bap Dai and the French, has 
created a new and potentially revolutionary situation in South Vietnam. 
While the situation remains extremely fluid, Diem appears to hold the 
initiative, and the interested parties -- particularly the French and 
Bao Dai -- will have to adapt themselves to a radically new situation 
dominated by Diem or by more extreme nationalist elements. If they do 
not adapt and if there are any substantial efforts by Bao Dai or the 
French to frustrate Diem's government, the chances of anti-French violence 
and the dissolution of the imperial institution would be greatly increased. 
Prior to the recent clashes between Diem's forces and the Binh 
Xuyen, little progress towards establishing a strong, effective anti-
Communist government had been made in South Vietnam since the conclusion 
of the armistice. Despite his considerable nationalist following, Diem 
had been unable to attract much support from the small political elite 
of the country, primarily because of his inability or unwillingness to 
delegate authority. Diem placed his trust in members of his family and 
resisted suggestions that he broaden his government's popular base. 
Diem, as the leading lay Catholic in Vietnam, has the support of most 
Catholics, but this fact has generated suspicion among non-Catholic 
Vietnamese and religious sect leaders who have accused Diem of promoting 
a private Catholic army. However, none of the groups opposing Diem 
has apy broad-based popular support. Diem's popular reputation for 
integrity and his nationalist zeal have been his most important assets, 
and the virtual expulsion of the Binh Xuyen from Saigon-Cholon has 
increased Diem's prestige throughout Vietnam. The confidence of Diem 
and his supporters in their own strength, judgment, and popular appeal 
has been considerably enhanced.

In contrast to the fluid situation in South Vietnam, the Vietminh 
is energetically consolidating its control over North Vietnam, is 
greatly increasing its armed strength by various measures including the 
evasion of armistice terms, and is continuing, though not without difficulty, 
to develop networks of agents and political cadres in South Vietnam, Laos, 
and Cambodia. The harshness of Vietminh repressive measures and the 
present economic difficulties of the regime, coupled with the flight of 
refugees to the South, would seem to presage an unfavorable popular reaction 
to the regime. 
Military  
The Vietnamese National Army is now being reduced from its former 
strength of 170,000 regulars and 10,000 auxiliaries in conformity with 
US recommendations for a 100,000 man force. The French Expeditionary 
Corps has a strength of approximately 150,000 regulars and 22,000 aux-
iliaries, plus relatively small air and naval contingents. The French 
are reluctant to commit their forces in internal security operations. 
At the present time, the combined French and Vietnamese armed forces 
could only delay a full-scale Vietminh invasions they could not stop 
it without reinforcements from outside. 
The Viet Minh is consolidating and reorganizing its armed forces 
by grouping formerly independent regular and regional units to form new 
divisions with augmented firepower. During the next 12 months the Viet-
minh will probably have at least 11 or 12 infantry divisions, two artillery 
divisions, and one anti-aircraft division. These developments would more 
than double the pre-Geneva combat effectiveness and capabilities of the 
Viet Minh regular army. The Viet Minh is expanding and improving its 
transportation and communication facilities, including rail and highway 
links with South China. 
Estimate of Probable Developments  
As a result of his recent successes, Premier Diem will almost certainly 
resist any efforts to remove him from office. His actions and those of his 
followers have taken an increasingly nationalistic, anti-French tone and 
Diem may now be convinced that a continuation of this anti-French policy 
is essential to the rallying of popular support. Nevertheless, he has 
exercised a moderating influence on the more radical elements around him. 
If Diem is thwarted in his objectives by the French or by Bao Dai, however, 
he will become more susceptible to pressures toward extreme action. Diem 
has rallied additional support during the currant military phase, and

from this position of strength, Mem will almost certainly continue to 
gain adherents, including defections from among the Binh Xuyen and the 
sects. 
Aside from the French Army, only the VNA presently has the capability 
to enforce Bao Dai's authority in Saigon or to back Diem in defiance of 
Bao Dai. There are some VNA officers who dislike Diem and who are con-
cerned by the developing rift between Diem and Bao Dai. On the other 
hand, there is considerable pro-Diem nationalist sentiment in the Army; 
Diem has gained additional support as a result of clearing the Binh 
Xuyen from Saigon; and most importantly, the VNA units in the Saigon 
area appear to be loyal to Diem. As a result of Diem's stand against 
Bao Dai and because of the latter's involvement in what many Vietnamese 
nationalists consider to be a French inspired political maneuver, Bao 
Dal's prestige has been greatly reduced. There appears to be considerable 
sentiment for the deposal of Bac Dad., and if Diem gives his consent such 
action may be taken at any time. For the present, Bao Dai apparently 
feels that the tide is running with Diem, and is attempting to preserve 
the institution of the monarchy by accepting the continuation of the Diem 
government. The French will find it difficult to accept Diem's success 
which came despite their strong and well-publicized opposition, and will 
probably continue pressure for his removal. However, if the French believe 
that Diem will succeed in consolidating his position they may decide that 
they have no choice except to repair their position with Diem as best they 
can while making plans for accelerated withdrawal of their forces.* 
The Viet Minh probably fear that Diem's continuation in office would 
limit the prospects of a peaceful unification of Vietnam under terms favorable 
to the Cbmmunists. They will probably continue covert efforts in South 
Vietnam to keep the situation agitated. The COmmunists almost certainly 
will not invade South Vietnam in the near future. 
Assuming that the US continues to support Diem, and that the French 
acquiesce, we believe the situation will stabilize in Saigon under Diem's 
control. However, Diem's talents as an administrator are unlikely to improve. 
His success achieved largely on his own initiative and with his own resources 
is likely to make him more independent and less amenable to policy guidance. 
Diem's government will still be confronted with manifold internal problems e 
e.g., integration of the sects, resettlement of refugees, land reform, ex-
tension of government authority in the provinces, training of the army. 
Although Diem has improved his position, we believe that it will still be 
extremely difficult, at best, for Diem or any Vietnamese government to build 
sufficient strength to meet the long-range challenge of the Communists. 
The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department of State, believes that 
? the last sentence of this paragraph understates the difficulty the French 
would have in accommodating to a strong, anti-French government in South 
Vietnam, and therefore believes the sentence should read: "If these 
efforts are unsuccessful and Diem appeared to be consolidating his position, 
the French in the end may decide that they have no choice except to step 
up the withdrawal of their forces from Vietnam."

TA OS 
Present Situation 
Laos lacks effective political leadership, and the population is in 
large measure politically apathetic. At present the government is a 
reasonably stable coalition of leading non-Communist political personalities 
with the pro-US Crown Prince Savang maintaining a balance of power. 
Laos is principally threatened at present by the Communist-dominated 
Pathet Lao movement which occupies and controls the two northern provinces 
of Phong Saly and Sam Neua and has an army which numbers about 6,000 men. 
Negotiations designed to bring the Pathet Lao into the Royal Government 
have resulted in a cease-fire in Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces and 
the establishment of a mixed committee to renew further discussions. This 
cease-fire, which tends to solidify the Pathet Lao position in the two 
provinces, was brought about largely by Premier Katay who tends to regard 
the Pathet as "wayward brothers who can be brought back into the fold," 
rather than as Communists supported and controlled by the Vietminh. 
The Laotian armed forces have a current strength of 27,000 and are 
augmented by a French Military Mission and by 3,500 French combat troops. 
The Laotian Army has not displayed a real will to fight and is incapable 
of defending Laos against any Vietminh invasion. It is unlikely that 
the Laotian Army can now without all-out French support exercise effective 
control in the two northern provinces in which the Pathet Lao are concentrated, 
or that it can prevent Communist activities on the local level elsewhere 
in Laos. 
Estimate of Probable Developments  
Pathet Lao followers of the Vietminh will probably continue to 
exercise considerable control in the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua. 
Moreover, the Communists will have the capability by political and sub-
versive means to heighten their influence in Laos and to weaken the 
anti-communist government. However, the nature of Communist aggressive 
action against Laos will be moderated by the Communist desire to continue 
their "peaceful coexistence" line in Asia, particularly directed toward 
Indian reactions, and to a lesser degree by the possibility of US counter-
action. Under these conditions, and providing that the Lao Government 
obtains and effectively utilizes outside assistance, we believe that 
it can limit Communist political advances.

However, if during the period of this estimate, South Vietnam should 
fall to the Vietminh, Communist capabilities for pressure against Laos 
would be substantially increased, and Laotian will and capability to 
resist these pressures mould be correspondingly lessened. The extent 
to which the Communists choose to exploit this situation would depend 
almost entirely on their estimate of the probable reactions of the Manila 
Pact power and of the neutral countries of South and Southeast Asia. 
CAMBODIA 
Present Situation 
King Norodom, who had exercised supreme power since 1952 when 
the National Assembly ceased to function, officially abdicated on 2 
March 1955 following criticism by the International Control Commission 
and some of the Geneva signatories of his anti-democracy program designed 
to preserve the monarchy as the primary instrument of government in Cambodia. 
Norodom's mother and father have assumed the throne, with the former exercising 
actual authority. Norodom continues to exercise many of his old functions 
in the government and has publicly announced his intention to take his 
program to the people and form a party in opposition to the national or 
"Democratic Party." 
The Cambodian public, despite their affection for the ex-King, have 
remained largely apathetic to the abdication probably because the significance 
of the ex-King's motional maneuver escapes the unsophisticated bulk of 
the population. However, Cambodians as a whole can be expected to remain 
loyal to the royal family, and Cambodia's stability will continue to 
depend primarily on the attitudes and reactions of the royal family as 
a whole, rather than in changing popular political tastes. 
We believe that despite the evacuation of a number of Viet Minh 
troops a sizeable Viet Minh cadre remains in Cambodia. Moreover, the 
Cambodian Communist armed bands, although ending their guerrilla activities, 
have failed to demobilize or to turn over their arms. 
The Cambodian armed forces total 32,000 and would be incapable of 
defending against a large scale Viet Minh invasion.

Estimate of Probable Developments  
We believe that for the next year or so, providing outside assistance 
and the assurance of western support are forthcoming, the Cambodians will 
maintain an anti-Communist policy and will be able to control int ernal 
subversion. 
Future events in Cambodia will be co is iderably affected by developments 
in Vietnam and in Laos. A Oomrminist takeover in South Vietnam would increase 
Communist capabilities against Cambodia and would impair Cambodian will to 
resist further Communist pressures, though we estimate that the Cambodians 
would be more resolute than would the Laotians under similar circumstances.
