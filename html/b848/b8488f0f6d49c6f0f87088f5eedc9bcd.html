 Prospects for Conventional
 Arms Transfer Restraints
 In Southeast Asia (u)
 25X1
 Key Judgments           Although arms sales to the nine Southeast Asian states in recent years have
 consistently accounted for only a very small percentage of the global weapons 25X1
 traffic, political and ideological competition divide the region into rival
 supplier-recipient groups and present a significant obstacle to establishing
 broad and effective restraints on conventional arms transfers (CAT).
 Reinforced by recent developments, Soviet domination of the Indochina
 arms market is likely to persist for some years to come, while traditional US
 domination of the arms market to the countries of the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), on the other hand, is likely to be
 increasingly challenged by other non-Communist suppliers.
 While there is currently no arms race-and little chance of conflict-
 between the ASEAN and Indochina states, the emergence of a new and pro-
 Vietnam regime in Kampuchea has had a significant impact on ASEAN
 perceptions of Sino-Soviet rivalry and Vietnamese ambitions in the region.
 25X1
 Although the extent to which the ASEAN states translate their heightened
 concern into accelerated purchases of sophisticated weapons will probably
 be limited by both budgetary and doctrinal constraints, they are likely to be
 more reluctant than ever to accept restrictions on their freedom to acquire
 any arms that they believe they need. In any event, it seems certain that the
 ASEAN states would. not accept CAT controls without the full participation
 of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam.                              25X1
 For its part, the USSR might view discussions of CAT restraints in
 Southeast Asia as an opportunity to exploit conflicts of interest between
 China and the West or among Western arms suppliers. Nonetheless, it
 almost certainly would be unwilling to engage in such a dialogue unless it
 was sure that it could protect its special interests in Vietnam, Laos, and
 Kampuchea.

 Pragmatic calculations of self-interest also seem likely to predispose China,
 the Indochina states, and many Western and less developed country (LDC)
 arms suppliers to view the prospect of an effective system of CAT restraints
 in Southeast Asia with suspicion. Consequently, it seems very unlikely that
 any such system will be proposed or discussed unless the United States takes
 the lead.
 Even with US sponsorship, the chances for successfully negotiating and
 implementing a Southeast Asian CAT restraint system would be remote. At
 the same time, the very fact of US sponsorship or active support of such an
 initiative could have an adverse impact on US relations with members of the
 ASEAN grouping by raising new doubts about the strength of the US
 commitment to their security.

 I
 This study was originally scheduled for publication in
 early 1979. Following the outbreak of large-scale
 hostilities in Indochina in late December 1978, the
 original draft was revised to consider the political and
 military impact of the initial phases of the fighting.
 The continuation and widening of the conflict, how-
 ever, necessitated imposing an arbitrary cutoff date for
 further research of 31 January 1979. The discussion
 thus takes account of the immediate consequences and
 longer term implications of the Vietnamese invasion of
 Kampuchea but not of the subsequent Chinese punitive
 attack on Vietnam.
 Despite the altered politico-military environment in
 Southeast Asia we feel the basic judgments advanced
 in the study remain valid. Indeed, its assessments of
 the attitudes and policies of the non-Communist
 ASEAN states with respect to arms control have in
 large part been validated by the reactions of those
 countries to the conflicts among their Communist
 neighbors.
 Over the longer term, expansion of the Soviet Union's
 military presence and political stake in Vietnam may
 prove to be one of the most significant consequences of
 the hostilities in Indochina. While the Soviet response
 to China's attack on Vietnam fell short of military
 intervention (and while Vietnam has made a point of
 claiming it "defeated" the Chinese invading force
 without Soviet assistance), Moscow took advantage of
 China's actions to justify a buildup of its naval
 presence in the Southeast Asian region and to
 strengthen its position in traditionally independent-
 minded Vietnam. As in the case of the reactions of the
 125X1
 ASEAN states, however, the implications of these
 relatively recent developments are consistent with the
 analysis in this study. In fact, they tend to reinforce the
 judgment that Moscow would not support the estab-
 lishment of a regional arms control regime in South-
 east Asia unless it was convinced that the arrangement
 under consideration would not restrict its freedom of
 action with respect to Vietnam and probably to
 Kampuchea and Laos.
 The principal objectives of this paper are:
 25X1
 ? To project the arms transfer process in Southest Asia
 over the past few years into clearer political and
 economic perspective.
 ? To identify and weigh the security concerns and the
 political and economic conditions that are likely to
 determine the degree to which individual Southeast
 Asian countries-and leading extraregional arms sup-
 pliers-will be willing to cooperate in restraining arms
 transfers in the months and years ahead.
 ? To gauge the implications of these conclusions for
 US policies and interests.
 25X1
 The analysis and conclusions of the paper that follows
 are elaborated in two detailed annexes that examine
 the dynamics of conventional arms transfers to South-
 east Asia, and the receptivity of both supplier and
 recipient states to voluntary restraints on such trans-
 fers.

 Prospects For Conventional

 25X1
 By historical and political definitions, Southeast Asia
 consists of the five members of the Association of
 Southest Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Indonesia, Ma-
 laysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand-the
 three Indochina states-Kampuchea, Laos, and Viet-
 nam-and Burma. Most are "poor," that is, lesser
 developed countries (LDCs); only Malaysia and Sin-
 gapore are classified by per capita GNP standards as
 25X1
 the total transfers. The United States dominated the
 ASEAN market (54 percent), while the Soviet Union
 dominated the Indochina market (92 percent). Other
 suppliers-mainly West European nations, Israel,
 Australia, and several LDCs to the ASEAN states,
 and China to the Indochina states-provided smaller
 amounts of military assistance and equipment on cash
 or credit terms. For the near future, arms transfers will
 probably continue to flow along already established
 25X1
 Since the victories of Communist governments in
 Indochina in 1975, the region has been divided
 ideologically into non-Communist (ASEAN and
 Burma) and Communist regimes. Nonetheless, there
 has been no major armed conflict between the two
 groups, and political differences have been resolved by
 accommodation and cooperation. There are, however,
 armed insurgencies or resistance movements operating
 in both Communist and non-Communist states and
 several of these receive limited assistance from exter-
 nal sources. Within ASEAN, the member states have
 eschewed the use of arms to resolve disputes.
 Despite the small volume of arms sales to Southeast
 Asia and the absence of an arms race among the
 recipient or the supplier states, political and ideo-
 logical competition divides the region into rival
 supplier-recipient groups and presents significant ob-
 stacles to establishing broad and effective restraints on
 conventional arms transfers (CAT). The extent to
 which arms restraints win the voluntary cooperation of
 the regional and other states concerned will depend on
 the nature and strength of the motives driving both
 suppliers and recipients, the nature of such restraints,
 and the manner in which they are negotiated and
 The In oc ma
 states, however, continue to play out historic and
 ethnic animosities among themselves through warfare
 despite an ostensibly common ideology.
 Trade in conventional arms has been relatively less
 active in Southeast Asia than in other regions, but is
 growing steadily in both volume and number of
 suppliers. Total arms sales and assistance to the nine
 Southeast Asian states during the period 1975-78
 amounted to approximately $2.8 billion, or 3.5 percent
 of total world sales over that four-year period.' The five
 members of ASEAN received 84 percent, the three
 Indochina states 14 percent, and Burma 2 percent of
 Motives for Buying Arms
 25X1
 Recipient states buy-and produce-arms for complex
 reasons involving internal security against insur-
 gencies, national prestige and pride, self-reliance and
 independence from foreign sources, and defense
 against external threats. With respect to the last-
 mentioned concern, there is currently little chance of
 major armed conflict between the two groupings
 of arms recipients-the ASEAN nations and the

 l'he emergence of a new and pro-Vietnamese regime in
 Kampuchea has, however, had a significant impact on
 ASEAN perceptions of Sino-Soviet rivalry and of
 Vietnamese ambitions in the region-largely by con-
 firming suspicions that Vietnam cannot be trusted.
 Some ASEAN states-Malaysia and Indonesia-have
 responded to the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea
 by formulating plans for rapid improvement and
 increase of their armed forces, but the ASEAN states
 are not likely to react to it by arming themselves
 heavily or by forming a mutual defense pact. Nonethe-
 less, over the longer term, this development adds
 pressure on these nations to continue to buy arms and,
 possibly, to accelerate their purchase schedules. The
 volume and sophistication of these arms purchases will
 be constantly constrained, however, by supply and
 budgetary restrictions.
 Although they have always been suspicious of the
 ASEAN nations' relationship with the United States,
 the three Indochina states do not consider the ASEAN
 states a serious military threat. Their main reasons for
 acquiring arms have been to build military capabilities
 against internal security threats, against each other, or
 against China. Vietnam and Laos will continue to
 receive military assistance, possibly of increasingly
 higher sophistication and volume, from the USSR. The
 new regime in Kampuchea will benefit indirectly from
 Soviet assistance to Vietnam.
 Considerations of national security, prestige, or
 economic advantage, as well as the wish to expand
 political and economic leverage, are among the most
 common motives for developing and sustaining arms
 exports. Strategic concerns are of relatively minor
 importance in motivating arms sales to the ASEAN
 states but they are a factor of growing importance in
 Soviet assistance to Vietnam
 West European and LDC arms suppliers to the
 ASEAN states have indicated growing interest in
 expanding relations-and arms sales-to this market.
 Specific problems with US sales restrictions and
 general dissatisfaction with the high cost and
 unreliability of the US supply line have motivated the
 ASEAN countries to shop elsewhere. ASEAN deci-
 sions to buy more from non-US suppliers could
 enhance the potential for competition among these
 suppliers for the US share of the market.
 Conditions Influencing Possible
 Arms Restraints
 The implicitly hostile division of supplier-recipient
 relationships into rival groups would, on the one hand,
 make it essential that all participate in an arms
 restraint system if it is to succeed and, on the other
 hand, make it difficult. to reach an agreement on broad
 and effective CAT curbs in Southeast Asia. This
 problem has several components:
 ? While the non-Communist suppliers-the West Eu-
 ropean nations and the LDCs-might be persuaded to
 agree to some form of restraint, the intensity of the
 Sino-Soviet rivalry in the region would make it
 difficult, to say the least, for both China and the USSR
 to reach an agreement on CAT controls.
 ? With the recent imposition by Hanoi of a pro-
 Vietnamese--and by extension pro-Soviet-regime in
 Kampuchea, China has lost its closest ally in Southeast
 Asia and an important battle in its efforts to curtail
 Soviet influence in Indochina. Although China is not
 currently a major arms supplier to the region (it is the
 sole supplier of arms to Kampuchea), it is considered a
 major power and would have to be included in any
 negotiations on restraining arms sales.
 ? The USSR might be willing to discuss CAT re-
 straints in Southeast Asia if it can protect its special
 interests in Vietnam, Laos, and Kampuchea, and if it
 sees an opportunity to exploit conflicts of interest
 between China and the West or among Western arms
 suppliers. Under such conditions, however, CAT nego-
 tiations would be meaningless.

 Approved For Release 2003/01/30 : CIA-RDP80T00942A00100002   Ie11
 ? Vietnam's attitude toward CAT controls will be
 influenced by both its own and Soviet interests. Despite
 its friendship and cooperation treaty with the USSR
 Hanoi has attempted to maintain a degree of inde-
 pendent action and would probably be reluctant to
 restrict its ability to acquire arms from either the
 Soviets or other suppliers.
 ? The ASEAN states would not accept CAT controls
 without the full participation of the Soviet Union,
 China, and Vietnam.
 It is extremely unlikely that a system for Southeast
 Asian CAT restraints will be proposed or discussed
 unless the United States takes the lead.. Even then, the
 chances of negotiating and implementing a CAT
 restraint system in Southeast Asia are small. A
 supplier-recipient agreement to reduce transfers of
 conventional arms to Southeast Asia would depend not
 only on the voluntary participation of both suppliers
 and recipients but also on the mechanics by which it
 might be negotiated and implemented. In the case of
 Southeast Asia, the motives driving both suppliers and
 recipients present significant obstacles to establishing
 broad and effective regional curbs. The implicitly
 hostile division of supplier-recipient relationships into
 Communist and non-Communist groups of states
 would, on the one hand, make it essential that all
 participate and, on the other, make it diifficult to
 negotiate an agreement.
 At present, the major implication for US policy of a
 proposal for restraining conventional arms transfers in
 Southeast Asia lies in its potential impact on Washing-
 ton's relations with the ASEAN countries. Gaining a
 sympathetic hearing by the ASEAN states on arms
 matters will depend not only on the substance of the
 proposed restraints, but also on the manner in which
 the proposal is presented and the extent to which the
 respective governments are consulted during the pro-
 cess. The five ASEAN states would probably oppose
 any restrictions on their abilities to improve the quality
 of their forces in accordance with their own percep-
 tions of their requirements for individual and collective
 self-defense, but they might be inclined to support
 controls on the introduction of highly sophisticated or
 clearly provocative types of weapons to the region-
 largely because none of them currently plans to acquire
 such weapons.
 25X1
 Their preference for relying on the United States, not
 only for arms but also for political and security
 support, their general dislike of the USSR, and their
 desire not to antagonize Vietnam (which has the
 largest military establishment in Southeast Asia) or
 China (whose intentions they suspect) would make the
 ASEAN states especially sensitive to extrare Tonal
 initiatives without close prior consultation.
 In the long run, a US-initiated or sponsored proposal t 025X1
 restrict arms sales to Southeast Asia could have the
 adverse impact of straining relations with the ASEAN
 group. Military assistance from the United States has
 long been regarded by the ASEAN states as a key
 symbolic barometer of US concern for their security
 and, by implication, for regional stability. US security
 assurances have helped to obviate the need for these
 nations to depend on alternate sup liers or to maintain
 large arms inventories.                      25X1
 During the past few years, however, the ASEAN
 governments have voiced an uncertainty about the US
 concern for their security, and about US military
 capabilities (particularly naval forces) in the region.
 While the ASEAN states clearly prefer US equip-
 ment, they have already demonstrated a readiness to
 turn to other suppliers and to undertake local produc-
 tion. Under these circumstances, attempts to place
 restraints on arms sales, particularly if initiated or
 sponsored by the United States, could further under-

 Dynamics of Arms Transfers
 To the Region
 Trends and Patterns in Southeast
 Asian Arms Transfers
 Total arms sales and assistance to the nine Southeast
 Asian countries during the period 1975-78 was ap-
 proximately $2.8 billion, excluding all US assistance to
 the Indochina states in 1975.2 This is about 3.5 percent
 of the world total of $80 billion. The volume of arms
 purchases by the five ASEAN states jumped in 1975-
 76, as a result of concern over the emergence of
 Communist govenments in Indochina, but appears to
 have fallen off in 1977-78. Arms transfers to the
 Indochina states by Communist suppliers declined over
 the period 1975-78, but probably increased somewhat
 in late 1978 as China and the USSR assisted their
 respective allies in the Kampuchea-Vietnam conflict.
 The five ASEAN members accounted for about 84
 percent of total arms purchases by the nine Southeast
 Asian states during the period 1975-78. Within
 ASEAN, Indonesia bought the most, and Singapore
 the least. Much of the earlier arms transfers to
 ASEAN countries were in the form of grant assist-
 ance, but since 1975 the proportion purchased on cash
 or credit terms by ASEAN governments has increased.
 Most of the spending has been for small arms,
 ammunition, quartermaster gear, and tanks. Several of
 the ASEAN states, however, have acquired more
 sophisticated and high-priced equipment, including
 fighter aircraft and fast patrol boats equipped with
 guided missiles.
 The Indochina states together accounted for about 14
 percent of total arms sales and assistance to Southeast
 Asia during the period 1975-78. Vietnam was the
 major recipient, despite its takeover of the large
 arsenal of weapons left in South Vietnam by the
 United States. Vietnam's arms imports, including
 MIG-19 and MIG-21 aircraft, have been acquired
 mostly through the Soviet military assistance pro-
 grams.
 ' See Annex C, tables 1-3.
 Future patterns and trends in Southeast Asian arms
 acquisitions will be influenced by the final outcome of
 the armed conflict between Vietnam and Kampuchea,
 which has already resulted in the replacement of a pro-
 Chinese Kampuchean Government with a pro-Viet-
 namese and, by extension, pro-Soviet, regime in
 Kampuchea. Soviet assistance to Vietnam will prob-
 ably increase following the conclusion of a friendship
 and cooperation treaty between the two countries.'
 China suspended all military and economic assistance
 to Vietnam in mid-1978, while continuing to provide a
 small amount of assistance to Kampuchea. China
 currently is not an arms supplier to any Southeast
 Asian nation, although it is supporting remnants of the
 former Pol Pot Kampuchean regime that are engaging
 in guerrilla resistance. F_        I  25X1
 The ASEAN nations, and Thailand in particular, are
 concerned over the establishment of a Vietnamese-
 controlled regime in Kampuchea that could threaten
 Thailand directly and the other four member states
 indirectly. This concern will undoubtedly translate into
 continued demands for arms, but overall spending by
 the ASEAN nations will probably not increase sharply
 in response. An arms race between ASEAN and the
 Indochina states is unlikely, partly because of budget-
 ary constraints in the ASEAN nations but largely    25X1
 because each group is likely to pursue policies of
 detente and cooperation rather than military force as a
 way of deterring aggression from the other.
 During the period 1975-78, the United States was the
 dominant supplier in the Southeast Asian arms mar-
 ket. The US share of the nine-country Southeast Asian 25X1
 market was 46 percent-compared to that of the next

 A more meaningful comparison, however, is between
 suppliers to either the five ASEAN nations or to the
 three Indochina states, because the major suppliers
 have sold almost exclusively to one group or the other.`
 The US share of sales to the ASEAN states (54.3
 percent) was substantially higher than that of its
 nearest competitor, the Netherlands (7.4 percent). The
 remainder was supplied by other West European
 countries, Israel, Australia, and some LDCs. Within
 the region, Singapore has also become a supplier,
 capturing .2 percent of the ASEAN market with sales
 to Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The Soviet
 Union supplied 92 percent of Indochina's military
 assistance, with China furnishing 5.6 percent and other
 Communist nations 2.4 percent.
 who offer comparable equipment on better credit and
 delivery terms.'
 Motives of Recipients
 The ASEAN States
 Two major motives underlie most of the arms acquisi-
 tions by the ASEAN nations: to maintain internal
 security and stability and to develop a limited but
 credible defense capability. Like many other Third
 World countries, the ASEAN states are concerned
 with internal challenges in the form of active
 insurgencies and endemic economic and political
 instability. The process of modernization is inherently
 destabilizing and sometimes releases forces that are
 difficult to control. Most ruling elites find their
 positions threatened whether or not they succeed in
 stimulating development. The line between threats to
 themselves and threats to the state is often blurred
 because the elites tend to view any threat to their
 For the near future, the arms suppliers will probably
 continue to deal exclusively with one regional grouping
 or the other. The USSR has attempted to penetrate the
 ASEAN market, but the five states remain suspicious
 of Soviet political and military intentions and have not
 placed any orders.' China is not likely to sell to these
 states either, not only because of political and ideologi-
 cal constraints but because it does not produce the type
 of equipment ASEAN wants.
 An increasing number of arms suppliers are, however,
 attempting to compete and to increase their share of
 the ASEAN market. Several ASEAN states that have
 relied mainly on US arms in the past have been window
 shopping elsewhere in the past year. These include
 some-Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, in
 particular-that have balked at US sales restrictions,
 including human rights reporting requirements. All
 the ASEAN states, however, feel that the US supply
 line has grown increasingly expensive, cumbersome,
 and uncertain. They are seeking alternate suppliers

 Communist suppliers, but accounts for only 2 percent of the region's

 leadership as a challenge to national security.
 Although the ASEAN governments justify the major-
 ity of their arms acquisitions by the need to combat
 domestic insurgencies. it is apparent that their pur-
 chases are motivated at least in part by other
 considerations. Much of the equipment presently being
 considered or purchased-F-5E fighter planes, fast
 patrol boats equipped with guided missiles, sophisti-
 cated air defense systems-is clearly not appropriate
 for counterinsurgency warfare in the jungle. Moreover,
 Singapore, which has consistently spent a higher
 percentage---almost 6 percent-of its GNP on defense
 than other ASEAN states, has no insurgency problem

 The desire to prepare themselves to meet a variety of
 internal threats, as well as to bolster national pride,
 self-confidence, and prestige, are the primary impulses
 behind current ASEAN armed forces modernization
 and expansion programs. Military establishments play
 dominant political roles in several states and their
 interests must be accommodated. In the case of
 Indonesia, keeping the military satisfied is also neces-
 sary to maintain the morale and status of an institution
 deemed vital for social and economic development as
 well as for security. Similarly, the civilian government
 of the Philippines has acquired weapons as a means of
 guaranteeing the loyalty and support of its senior
 military officers. Finally, in many of these poor LDCs,
 the armed forces are catered to because they provide
 employment and thus help to alleviate social and
 The ASEAN members have eschewed the use of force

 coordinated and unified.' ASEAN's response to Viet-
 nam's invasion of Kampuchea has been unanimous in
 deploring the aggression and in reaffirming the soli-
 darity and neutrality of the group. These countries are
 likely to continue to value their unity and neutrality
 and to pursue a two-track policy toward external
 threats: conciliatory diplomacy combined with gradual
 enhancement of national and collective defense
 capabilities.
 The ASEAN countries have concentrated on building
 up their individual defense capabilities to enable them
 to respond to low-level threats and to create over the
 long term a credible deterrent to potential external
 enemies. Indonesia, for example, realizes that it has
 serious gaps in its sea defense and surveillance ability
 that have made it difficult to patrol its lengthy
 coastline or to control smugglers, pirates, and even
 Indochinese refugees. The states bordering the
 Malacca Strait-Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singa-
 pore-are concerned about possible intimidation by
 the fleets of great powers operating through the Strait
 and have therefore concentrated on acquiring fast
 patrol boats equipped with guided missiles that can be
 used effectively against large naval vessels. All have
 sought to improve their air defense forces and radar
 systems. Furthermore, most ASEAN states are experi-
 encing large influxes of Vietnamese seaborne refugees
 and the bolstering of naval forces may also be designed
 to monitor, control, and repel refugee landings.

 Nonetheless, compared to LDCs in other regions the
 ASEAN governments' requests for military aid or
 equipment are not large. Although many of these
 states would probably seek more equipment if they had
 the money, political-economic priorities and financial
 constraints preclude large expenditures for the foresee-
 able future. Civilian and military leaders alike recog-
 nize that the solutions to problems of insurgency and
 instability demand social and economic development
 programs in at least equal proportion to military
 operations. Hence, their limited financial resources
 have been allocated primarily to development, which
 reduces significantly the amount available to purchase
 arms.
 The five states have firmly rejected the idea of a
 collective security pact, at least for the time being.'?
 Military cooperation among the ASEAN states, in the
 form of joint training exercises and counterinsurgency
 operations along common borders, has been confined
 to bilateral or, at most, trilateral agreements.
 Cooperation has expanded, however, and contingency
 plans have been suggested whereby Indonesian and
 Singaporean troops would be sent to fight in Malaysia
 and/or Thailand if the latter were invaded or in danger
 of being overthrown by Communist insurgents." There
 is still a strong resistance to the idea, however.
 Cooperation has also involved a limited degree of
 equipment standardization. Indonesia and Singapore
 have taken the lead in promoting arms comple-
 mentarity-particularly the use of M-16 rifles by all
 members-to make mutual assistance easier and arms
 purchases more economical. Nonetheless, even though
 the ASEAN countries often exchange experiences and
 information before purchasing certain equipment, they
 do not always take complementarity into consider-
 ation. Constrained by a scarcity of funds, the individ-
 ual countries often sacrifice standardization for the
 best deal they can make. For example, the Indonesians
 contemplated purchasing the French Mirage-5 instead
 of the US F-5E because they felt the purchase terms
 were better, despite the fact that most of the other
 ASEAN countries possess the US aircraft.
 Motivated partly by doubts about reliability of foreign
 suppliers, all of the ASEAN members have considered
 working toward individual and regional arms self-
 sufficiency through local production. In addition, local
 manufacture could alleviate the drain on foreign
 exchange reserves caused by purchasing abroad.
 The profit possibilities of arms production and export
 sales are especially appealing to Indonesia's military
 leadership as a means of supplementing military
 salaries and financing long-term modernization pro-
 grams that cannot be budgeted out of government
 revenues. Both Indonesia and the Philippines want to
 develop their aviation industries and hope to sell
 abroad. Only Singapore currently has the industrial
 capacity and financial resources to produce small arms
 and ammunition and is expanding its production base
 for both its own supply and for export sales. While it is
 premature to expect ASEAN arms factories to
 produce military goods in sufficient quantities to meet
 local needs or to export in the near future, over the long
 term the member states will increasingly pursue local
 or joint production of small arms and ammunition in
 order to generate higher technological know-how, self-
 confidence, and additional foreign exchange.
 Burma
 Like the ASEAN states, Burma's military government
 identifies active insurgency as its major national
 security concern and motivation for seeking arms. In
 recent years, however, Burma has been unable to
 obtain the money or credit necessary to modernize its
 equipment. It has also been reluctant to rely upon, or to
 seek, major foreign military assistance, largely because
 it fears an adverse impact on good relations with
 China, the only potential source of external threat
 Burma perceives.
 The Indochina States
 Until the outbreak of hostilities between Vietnam and
 Kampuchea, internal, not external, threats were the
 major motives for the limited amount of arms acquired
 during the period 1975-78 by the three Indochinese
 states. These internal motives persist but have been
 overshadowed by the immediate need to augment
 defensive and offensive capabilities.

 While they are suspicious of the ASEAN nations'
 relations with the United States, the three Indochina
 states do not consider these nations or Burma to be
 serious military threats. Rather, their main concerns
 have been with each other and with the Chinese or the
 Soviets. Deteriorating relations with the Chinese
 helped prompt Vietnam to sign a treaty of friendship
 and cooperation with the USSR and subsequently to
 invade Kampuchea, setting up a pro-Vietnamese
 government. Laos, an ally of Vietnam, attempted to
 maintain its neutral stance in the Sino-Soviet rivalry,
 but recently it has supported Vietnam's actions against
 Kampuchea and openly quarreled with China. As
 Hanoi's client, the new Kampuchean regime of Hcng
 Samrin will benefit indirectly from Soviet assistance to
 Vietnam.
 Non-Communist
 The motives that drive the non-Communist suppliers-
 political, security/strategic, and economic-have fluc-
 tuated with changes in the regional and international
 environment. Earlier US, UK, and Australian military
 assistance accompanied formal security alliances and
 was designed mainly to meet political and security
 objectives, including enhancing local counterinsur-
 gency capabilities and cementing political ties with
 allies and former colonies.
 In the mid-1970s the Cold War atmosphere gave way
 to the spirit of detente, thus reducing the strategic
 necessity of such regional military pacts as the
 Southeast Asia Treaty Organization-the United
 States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New
 Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand-
 and the Five Power Defense Arrangement (FPDA)-
 the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Malay-
 sia, and Singapore." In addition, the victory of
 Communist regimes in Indochina and the severance of
 many former political ties have caused the United
 12 SEATO was dissolved in 1977 and the phasing out of FPDA will be
 completed by 1980. Under the terms of the 1954 Manila Pact,
 however, the United States retains a special consultative relationship
 with the Philippines and Thailand should either be in danger of
 direct attack. In addition, the Rusk-Thanat Communique provides
 for US intervention if Thai security is seriously threatened by an
 States and West European suppliers to reexamine the
 political and strategic importance of the region,
 especially in comparison to such other regions as
 Africa and the Middle East. Political motivations,
 however, are paramount as reasons for US and
 Australian military assistance to the ASEAN states.
 West European and other marginal suppliers sell arms
 to Southeast Asia mainly for economic reasons. For the
 European and non-European suppliers alike, arms
 exports help to reduce production costs, realize econo-
 mies of scale, recoup research and development costs,
 and alleviate general domestic economic concerns by
 maintaining or increasing employment. General eco-
 nomic conditions in the industrialized countries have
 accentuated these motives during the past few years.
 Nonetheless, the volume of arms sales to Southeast
 Asia has been a relatively small proportion of these
 countries' world sales
 Communist
 Soviet and Chinese arms transfers to Indochina were
 designed to thwart US intentions and to win allies.
 They are now driven primarily by Sino-Soviet rivalry
 and by their own perceptions of the importance of
 Southeast Asia to their overall world strategy. The

 continued political and security objectives vis-a-vis

 Receptivity to Voluntary
 CAT Restraints
 Both non-Communist and Communist countries in
 Southeast Asia have talked of making the region a
 nuclear free zone. However, neither of the zone of
 peace plans thus far proposed-Malaysia's "zone of
 peace, freedom, and neutrality" (ZOPFAN) and
 Vietnam's "zone of peace, genuine independence, and
 neutrality" (ZOPGIN)-is presently more than a
 vehicle for generating a political and diplomatic
 dialogue between the two rival blocs. As such, neither
 would present a suitable foundation for a conventional
 arms restraint regime. Although both plans contain
 similar principles for regional cooperation and call for
 an end to great power interference, political and
 ideological differences between the ASEAN and
 Indochinese countries make agreement on a zone of
 peace unlikely."
 The ASEAN States
 Thus far, the ASEAN nations as a group have not
 formally addressed the issue of conventional arms
 control. Nonetheless, it is clear that the ASEAN
 countries at present perceive no need for a formal
 regional agreement to control conventional arms trans-
 fers, and it is likely that they would resist efforts to
 negotiate one. Most have expressed individual opinions
 on disarmament in general, but their emphasis has
 been on nuclear-weapons-free zones and on East-West
 arms reductions. The three states that are members of
 the nonaligned movement-Indonesia, Malaysia, and
 Singapore-supported the movement's resolution at
 the UN Special Session on Disarmament (SSOD) in
 June 1978, which gave priority to control of nuclear,
 chemical, incendiary, and mass-destruction weapons
 over restraints on conventional arms transfers.
 " For additional background, see "ZOPFAN or ZOPGIN-A Zone
 of Peace in Southeast Asia?" International Issues Monthly Review,
 26 July 1978, RP IIMR 78-006.
 Malaysia has been a major spokesman for ASEAN in
 UN and nonaligned disarmament forums. It has,
 however, been largely concerned with nuclear disarma-
 ment and with promoting its initiative for ZOPFAN.
 25X1
 Philippine participation in a regional arms control
 agreement, particularly a US-initiated one, would be
 complicated by the presence of US bases in that
 country. The Philippine Government has managed
 thus far to soften the effects of unilateral US curbs on
 conventional arms transfers through exploitation of
 Washington's interest in maintaining military bases in
 the Philippines. From the Philippines' point of view,
 establishment of regional conventional arms transfer
 controls would be likely to deprive Manila of at least
 some of the benefits it currently derives from its
 favorable bargaining position.
 25X1
 Thailand's statements on arms control have focused on
 the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the competi-
 tion between the arms-producing superpowers. Thai-
 land supported the SSOD declaration but expressed
 concern that limiting international arms sales might
 affect its ability to purchase weapons for its own
 defense and for combating illicit narcotics traffic.
 Thailand would be particularly sensitive to US policy
 initiatives without close, prior consultation. Thai
 officials have expressed resentment, for example, at
 the "failure" of the United States to consult with them
 on the US-Vietnamese talks in Paris.

 .Singapore produces small arms, ammunition, and
 patrol boats for its own use and, increasingly, for
 export to other ASEAN members under the guise of
 military cooperation. It has a coproduction arrange-
 ment with Thailand and is now negotiating one with
 Malaysia. Arms sales to Indonesia, the Philippines,
 and Thailand amounted to $6.0 million from 1975 to
 1978 and accounted for .2 percent of total transfers to
 the ASEAN countries. (-Singapore has also sold arms
 worth about $1.8 million to Kuwait.) A handicap to the
 further expansion of Singapore's arms exports is that
 some of the equipment it makes either includes
 foreign-made components-such as the Israeli Gabriel
 guided missiles on the patrol boats sold to Thailand-
 or is manufactured under foreign license. In both
 cases, Singapore is required to obtain permission from
 another supplier before it can conclude a sale.
 Thus far, Singapore is apparently the only Southeast
 Asian state willing to examine the possibility of a
 conventional arms transfer (CAT) restraint agree-
 ment. In his speech during the SSOD general debate,
 Singapore's representative acknowledged that all
 nations-not just the superpowers-are responsible for
 arms races and emphasized that all states must
 examine their own conduct critically. He went on to
 praise the Latin American regional initiative to control
 acquisitions of arms for offensive purposes."
 Singapore's willingness to discuss arms control reflects
 its sense of extreme vulnerability as a small and
 relatively wealthy city-state surrounded by large and
 poor countries. Singapore is also better armed, for its
 size, than its neighbors and would obviously like to
 maintain this status. Its reactions to recent develop-
 ments in Indochina suggest, however, that its interest
 in CAT restraint may be declining. Less sanguine than
 its ASEAN partners about the possibility of tempering
 Vietnamese aggression through detente and coopera-
 tion, Singapore has begun to talk of ASEAN mutual
 security arrangements
 The success of any arms control agreement in South-
 east Asia would require the full participation of
 Indonesia, which is at present the least likely to agree
 to restrict its purchase of arms. Political and psycho-
 logical factors would make it extremely difficult for
 the military government to agree to arms restraints.
 Indeed, the necessity of placating junior officers who
 are dissatisfied with the slow pace of upgrading
 military equipment has caused the Suharto govern-
 ment to plan an acceleration of military modernization
 programs over the next several years. Nationalist
 sentiments, fears of foreign manipulation, and the
 military's own sense of pride as a revolutionary force,
 would make Indonesia reluctant even to participate in
 discussions initiated either by nonregional states or by
 other ASEAN members (and Singapore, in particular)
 with nonregional support.
 Nevertheless, the ASEAN states might be inclined to
 support controls on the introduction to the region of
 highly sophisticated or clearly provocative types of
 weapons-largely because none of them currently
 plans to acquire such weapons. They would, however,
 probably oppose any restriction on their abilities to
 improve the quality of their forces in accordance with
 their own perceptions of their requirements for individ-
 ual and collective self-defense.
 Burma
 Burma has traditionally avoided active participation in
 regional and international affairs." Neutralist and
 nationalist--to the point of isolationism-Burma is
 suspicious of everyone, and China in particular.

 The Indochina States
 As a result of conflict with Kampuchea and deteriorat-
 ing relations with China, Vietnam discarded its impar-
 tial attitude toward the Sino-Soviet dispute in 1978.
 While its friendship and cooperation treaty with the
 USSR does not require Soviet military intervention in
 case of an attack on Vietnam, Hanoi undoubtedly
 hoped that the treaty would deter China from taking
 strong measures against Vietnam.
 In an obvious bid to improve relations with ASEAN as
 friction with China intensified, Vietnam ;proposed its
 own version of a zone of peace in Southeast Asia at the
 SSOD last June. While Vietnam's proposal for a zone
 of peace is no closer to implementation than ASEAN's
 zone of peace plan it does signify a new willingness to
 cooperate and an acceptance of the concept in princi-
 ple.
 Vietnam's attitude toward regional arms control will
 be influenced partly by Soviet interests but largely by
 its own perception of its needs. Vietnam is under
 pressure from the USSR to provide air and port
 facilities to service the Soviet Indian Ocean Fleet, but
 it is unlikely to grant unrestricted use of these facilities
 in the near future. Vietnam has tried to maintain some
 flexibility and lessen its dependence on the USSR by
 seeking other sources of economic assistance and by
 limiting the Soviet military presence in Vietnam.
 Hence, Vietnam would probably be reluctant to accept
 a CAT control regime which restricted its ability in the
 future to acquire arms from either the Soviets or other
 suppliers.
 Laos is strongly influenced by Vietnam--and, by
 extension, backs the Soviet Union in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute. The security of Laos is maintained not only by
 its own forces but also by those of Vietnam. Laos has
 been a vocal opponent of ASEAN's zone of peace
 proposal but has found Vietnam's plan acceptable.
 Hence, Laos would be likely to follow the lead of the
 Vietnamese on arms control, but might be indirectly
 influenced to some degree by Soviet wishes.
 Perceptions of Supplier States
 USSR
 Although the USSR in recent years has sharply
 increased its diplomatic and ideological activities in
 Southeast Asia, its economic and military involvement
 in the region remains relatively modest.
 From 1975 to 1978 the USSR accounted for 13
 percent of the total value of arms sales to Southeast
 Asia as a whole, and 92 percent of sales to the
 Indochina states. While this is a considerable percent-
 age, Soviet arms transfers to the region steadily
 declined during this period and represented less than 2
 percent of its worldwide sales. A major reason for the
 decline was the end of the Vietnam war and the
 capture of $5 billion worth of US military hardware by
 Hanoi in 1975. Soviet military assistance to Viet-
 nam-the major recipient of Soviet arms-has con-
 sisted mainly of replacement parts, fuel, and some new
 equipment.
 Moreover, in comparison with Western suppliers,
 Moscow has fewer established arms customers in
 Southeast Asia and less potential for developing
 significant new markets in the region. Although the
 Soviets will continue efforts to expand their list of
 customers-witness their recent offers of military aid
 to the Philippines and Indonesia-widespread antipa-
 thy toward Moscow, the desire of the ASEAN states
 not to get involved in the Sino-Soviet rivalry, and the
 ready availability of suppliers that are politically and
 ideologically more acceptable suggest that the chances
 for expansion of Soviet arms sales in the region are low.
 The Soviet involvement in Southeast Asia is rooted in
 its broader foreign policy objectives, the most urgent of
 which is to limit the growth of China's influence and
 power in the region. This policy of countering China is
 based on developing a durable and broadly based
 relationship with Vietnam. The latter has both sym-
 bolic and practical significance to Moscow. For
 Moscow, Vietnam is symbolically important because it
 is the first state where US "imperialism" has suffered
 a defeat by the forces of "national liberation"-aided
 by the "world socialist system"-in a direct military
 confrontation. Consequently, influence over Hanoi is
 Until late 1978, Kampuchea had received Chinese and
 East European military assistance in very small
 quantities, with China supplying most of it. The
 Vietnamese-controlled Heng Samrin regime obviously
 will follow Vietnam's lead on arms controls issues.

 of major importance to Moscow in its ideological
 rivalries with both China and the West in the Third
 World.
 On the practical level, the USSR views Vietnam as the
 only state in the region capable of providing a military
 counterweight to China. Moscow believes that its
 establishment of a strong presence in Vietnam by
 becoming the main source of economic and military
 assistance, coupled with regional suspicions of China's
 =rims and traditional anti-Chinese sentiment, will
 enable it to use this strong and regionally dominant
 Vietnam against China. Soviet leaders undoubtedly
 regard Vietnam's membership in the Council for
 Mutual Economic Assistance, the signing of a Soviet-
 Vietnamese treaty of friendship andcooperation in
 early November 1978, and the failure of Deng
 Xiaoping's Southeast Asian trip to produce any pro-
 Beijing diplomatic breakthroughs as confirming the
 wisdom of this aspect of their Southeast Asia policy.
 ['his assessment points to several obstacles to a
 regional arms accord. The Soviets clearly have a strong
 political and strategic interest in arms sales as a means
 of maintaining their political presence in Vietnam and
 Laos. Vietnam's hostilities with China and Kam-
 puchea have provided the USSR with further opportu-
 nities for drawing Vietnam into a more dependent
 relationship. In sum, the USSR's desire to maintain its
 7osition as the primary source of Hanoi's power and
 Moscow's continuing interest in expanding arms sales
 to the non-Communist ASEAN states as a means of
 reducing both Chinese and Western influence will
 certainly strengthen the USSR's general disinclination
 to enter into international agreements to restrain
 conventional arms transfers in Southeast Asia.
 The only arrangement that the Soviets might support
 would be one that established a regional arms ceiling
 rather than limiting the amounts of arms sales to
 individual countries in the area. Since Vietnam is the
 only significant recipient of Soviet arms in the region,
 Such an arms transfer restraint arrangement would not
 greatly restrict the Soviets' freedom of action in
 dealing with Vietnam and would offer them an
 opportunity to exploit conflicts of interest among
 Western suppliers, who have multiple recipients in the
 area, or between China and the West. For example,
 China may perceive a US-Soviet regional CAT re-
 straint agreement as Western validation of the
 longstanding Soviet claim to being a force of stability
 in the region.16
 In fact, the Soviets would have little to lose by
 encouraging such an :arms restraint arrangement. The
 USSR's arms sales to Vietnam in 1977 amounted to
 $8.4 million, or less than 0.1 percent of its arms sales
 worldwide for that year. With poor prospects for a
 further significant expansion of arms customers in that
 region and with Vietnam in need of additional Soviet
 arms despite its possession of a large quantity of usable
 US arms, Moscow would probably view the potential
 benefit of unrestrained freedom to exploit the arms
 market as minimal, at least in the short run. And since
 the Western suppliers together sell more arms to more
 Southeast Asian customers than does the Soviet
 Union, Moscow might. conclude that the West would
 bear most of the political and economic cost of regional
 arms restraint agreement.
 If the Soviets can protect their special interests in
 Vietnam, therefore, they might be willing to discuss
 Southeast Asian CAT restraints. Their suggestions for
 using Vietnam's zone of peace proposal as a possible
 framework for a regional arms control regime can be
 viewed as a trial ballotm in this regard
 Australia
 Australia provided about .5 percent of the arms
 supplied to Southeast Asia from 1975 to 1978 and
 4 percent of sales to the ASEAN states alone.
 Canberra's political and security ties to its fellow
 Commonwealth members in the region-Singapore
 and Malaysia-motivate its military assistance pro-
 grams to these countries. Ironically, Australia also
 provides sizable military assistance to Indonesia, the
 one country from which it perceives       ial threat.
 Australia has endorsed the concept of an arms
 restraint accord in Southeast Asia that would inhibit
 the development of offensive capabilities of regional

 states-of Indonesia in particular. At the same time,
 Canberra sees many dangers and difficulties in the
 actual implementation of such a restraint system at
 this time. Australia is concerned that the ASEAN
 states will react adversely to the idea of CAT restraints
 (especially if proposed by the United States) and that
 they will be motivated to reexamine their defense
 capabilities and to accelerate their arms purchases.
 Western Europe
 Western Europe accounted for about 33 percent of
 sales to all nine Southeast Asian states and 38 percent
 of those to the five ASEAN nations during the period
 1975-1978. With the exception of the United Kingdom
 and the Netherlands, the West Europeans have no
 strong political ties or strategic interests in that region.
 The United Kingdom and its Commonwealth col-
 leagues in the region are members of the regional Five
 Power Defense Arrangement. Even so, its sales to
 ASEAN accounted for only 6 percent of its worldwide
 sales during the four-year period. The Netherlands,
 whose sales to ASEAN-mostly to Indonesia-repre-
 sented a substantial 40 percent of its worldwide sales,
 retains political and economic interest in its former
 colony, Indonesia.
 Western Europe's major economic motives for selling
 arms-the need to sustain domestic arms industries
 and to compensate for an economic slowdown-are
 important but have not been well served by the
 Southeast Asian market because of the small
 quantities of arms sales involved. Political and
 economic commitments and arms sales to other
 regions-the Middle East, China, and Africa-have
 been generally viewed by the West Europeans as much
 more important and lucrative.
 West European attitudes, however, are changing. In
 the past year, several EC nations have indicated
 greater interest in the ASEAN group. The first
 ministerial level meeting between the ASEAN and the
 EC governments, held in November 1978, followed a
 marked expansion of investment and trade, including
 arms sales and coproduction agreements, with the
 ASEAN states. France and West Germany, in par-
 ticular, stepped up arms sales efforts in 1978. The
 potential for cornering a larger share of the ASEAN
 market has been enhanced, too, by ASEAN's problems
 with US sales and deliveries.
 The generally low priority currently assigned to
 Southeast Asia by most of the West European nations
 would probably make them willing to accept an arms
 restraint system in the region-provided that all the
 region's recipients and suppliers agreed to the same
 limitations. By agreeing to limit their sales to South-
 east Asia, EC suppliers might hope to alleviate
 international pressures to reduce sales to other regions 25X1
 they consider to be more important. It is conceivable,
 however, that in the near future improved economic
 and political contacts with the ASEAN states could
 make the West Europeans increasingly unwilling to
 restrain their arms sales                          25X1
 Marginal Suppliers
 China, although not currently a major supplier to the
 region, has used military assistance to promote its
 political and ideological objectives in Indochina.
 Beijing's efforts in the region currently are directed
 toward thwarting Vietnamese and-by extension-
 Soviet expansionism in the area. During the period
 1975-78, China provided 5.6 percent of all arms to
 Indochina, with the largest portion going to Kam-
 puchea. During 1978, as a result of its dispute with
 Vietnam and Vietnam's subsequent tilt toward the
 USSR for assistance, China halted all economic and
 military assistance to Hanoi. In Kampuchea, Beiiing
 has announced its commitment to supply arms to the
 resistance forces of the ousted Pol Pot government.
 China would like to draw closer to the ASEAN states
 to counter Vietnamese and Soviet influence in Indo-
 china. The ASEAN states, however, have mixed views
 about China's long-term intentions and have generally
 held China at arm's length.
 In the present stage of its rivalry with
 the USSR in Asia, China will not easily foreclose its
 option to provide arms to any client in the future.

 Yugoslavia, Israel, and the Republic of Korea are 25X1_
 eager to expand their arms sales to Southeast Asia, and
 the ASEAN states in particular. Together, these three

 Approved For Release 2003/01/30 : CIA-RDP80T00942A001000020001-1
 nations supplied about 7.7 percent of the arms to
 ASEAN, and about 6.4 percent of the total to
 Southeast Asia during the period 1975-78.
 Yugoslavia's sales to Southeast Asia-mostly to the
 non-Communist ASEAN states-accounted for over
 3.0 percent of its total world sales. One of the most
 developed of the developing countries, it is both an
 importer and exporter of conventional arms. Yugo-
 slavia's vigorous efforts to market its equipment are
 driven by basic economic imperatives born of chronic
 imbalance of payment and unemployment problems,
 combined with the desire to bolster its own security
 and independence by achieving self-sufficiency in arms
 production by the year 2000. Its burgeoning arms
 industry produces a wide array of military equipment
 which it sells to other LDCs. Belgrade's desire to
 enhance its standing as a Third World and nonaligned
 spokesman has also provided a powerful incentive to
 expand arms sales to-and to engage in defense-
 related joint production ventures with-other leading
 LDCs, such as Indonesia.
 Despite its growing role as an arms supplier,
 Yugoslavia has a longstanding and active interest in
 disarmament. Belgrade believes that if the LDCs act in
 concert, the disarmament process offers a unique and
 promising means for undermining the industrialized
 nations' monopoly of military, political, and economic
 power. The emergence of alternative arms suppliers
 among the LDCs tends to advance these same goals
 and is thus seen as a useful and even necessary adjunct
 to the overall disarmament effort.
 Belgrade is on record as being generally receptive to
 proposals for the control of conventional arms, but it
 has expressed fundamental skepticism about the value
 of "unbalanced" schemes that are limited in scope or
 geographic area. Yugoslavia's natural inclination to
 resist conventional arms control proposals that seem to
 sustain or enhance the military superiority enjoyedby
 the industrialized powers has been reinforced by what
 it perceives as the discriminatory nature of the current
 international nuclear nonproliferation system. More-
 over, Belgrade's freedom of maneuver on CAT issues is
 constrained by its desire to maintain LDC solidarity.
 Israel's sales to the ASEAN states amounted to about
 10 percent of its total worldwide sales. The bulk of
 these sales involved aircraft and Gabriel guided
 missiles, some of the most advanced equipment that
 the ASEAN states have acquired. A number of
 economic and political motives underlie Israel's arms
 export effort: Israel needs foreign exchange to pay for
 its own weapons imports; it wants to maintain a strong
 defense industry; and it seeks to overcome its interna-
 tional isolation. By selling to ASEAN states, Israel
 may hope to sway the votes of the group's two Muslim
 members---Indonesia and Malaysia-on Middle East
 issues in multilateral forums.
 Despite its small industrial base, Israel's relatively
 advanced military technology has enabled it to com-
 pete effectively in this market. Its main handicap is
 that much of the equipment it makes includes foreign-
 made components or is manufactured under foreign
 license, obliging it to obtain permission from another
 supplier (usually the United States or a West Euro-
 pean state) before it can make the sale. The denial of
 this permission could be an important means for other
 suppliers to restrain Israel from undermining an
 agreement on arms transfer restraint in Southeast
 Asia.
 The prospects for purely voluntary Israeli restraint,
 however, are dim. Partly because of the political
 barriers keeping it out of many Third World markets,
 Tel Aviv is unlikely to acquiesce in anything that
 would weaken its defense industry for the sake of arms
 restraint in a region still much more lightly armed than
 its own.
 The other nonregional supplier with a chance of
 making significant inroads in the Southeast Asian
 arms market is South Korea. So far, South Korea's
 modest sales of small arms, ammunition, and military
 clothing to the ASEAN states have accounted for 3
 percent of its total worldwide sales of military supplies
 and hardware. It is endeavoring to expand its share of
 the market (2 percent) with deals for larger items such
 as patrol boats. Like Israel, however, it faces the
 problem of requiring third-party permission to export
 complex equipment containing foreign-made compo-
