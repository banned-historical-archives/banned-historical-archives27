 Communist propaganda position on the eve of the World
 Economic  on erensce o    r e    am a ron an   r.   ange 9   the two
 c  e  organizers o   the World Economic Conference9 during
 interviews in the Soviet capital on the eve of the conference9
 made the first definite suggestions for trade possibilities
 in specific commodities between the Orbit and the West --
 between Communist China and France and Great Britain.   These
 remarks are in line with alleged Soviet interest in increased
 East-West trade.
 On the other handy  the US Embassy in Moscow believes
 that the real motivation behind the conference is revealed
 in the following statement in the newspaper Trudo   "The
 foremost condition for the development of European trade
 must be the cessation of economic discrimination against the
 USSR and Eastern Europe which is being carried out by the
 ruling circles of the US,"  Furthermore9  it is "well known
 that" the US ban on export of strategic materials "is being
 extended in fact to all types of goods and services
 completely severing trade between the West and East."-

 Comment:   The reorganization of Vostokintorg in the
 fall m    51 , the Soviet propaganda effort of recent months
 to encourage Asian interest in trade with the USSR, and the
 International Economic Conference in Moscow have pointed
 up an emerging trend in Soviet policy towards the establish-
 ment of enlarged trade channels in various susceptible areas.
 This information provides additional evidence of
 Moscow's desire to promote Asian trade relations, and may
 actually lead to increased trade in low-priced commodities
 despite the improbability of obtaining strategic goods in
 return.
 Such a program would not only supplement the active
 Soviet cultural efforts to woo India, but would also serve
 to counterbalance American economic aid and trade ties.
 The USSR has at times been able to undercut Western prices
 by selling inferior products, and such an effort could be
 made in India with drugs, chemicals and small machinery.

 Comment:  The uniformed militia are believed to number
 some M_, WT, but the full strength of the Bulgarian People's
 Militia is not known.   Since ordinary civil police and
 special security forces are  probabl   included in the larger
 totals given in                          a security force strength
 of 100,000 would not appear to  e i mprobable o
 Although an undetermined number of Yugoslavs and Greeks
 are in the service of Bulgaria, there is no evidence to
 indicate that they have been integrated into Bulgarian
 Militia units.

 4.          Bulgaria reported planning new economic and political
 25X1        measures                                                        11-remier
 1ierveai ov recently visited Moscow in connection with a new
 program for the "moral reinforcement" of the people and
 party of Bulgaria.   Allegedly, the new program calls for a
 campaign to stress the importance of the party congress to be
 held in May for the postponement of plans for a Bulgarian
 currency reform, for an abatement of the propaganda campaigns
 against Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, for stimulation of
 economic cooperation with the West, and for a "renaissance
 of Bulgarian national feeling."   (S Athens 4327, 1 Apr 52)
 Comment:  Although it is probable that Chervenkov
 visits    .scow late in February, the balance of this report
 25X1        has not been confirmed                     I and should be treated
 with considerable reserve.
 The last congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party was
 held in December 1948.  According to party statute, a
 congress should be held every two years.   There is no other
 evidence that a congress might be held in May.
 The Rumanian currency change in January caused rumors
 concerning an impending Bulgarian reform.   It is likely that
 such a reform9 if planned, has been postponed.
 There is no evidence that Bulgaria intends to alter
 its hostile policy toward Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, and
 it is highly doubtful that Sofia will "act to stimulate
 economic cooperation with the West."
 During the past year Bulgaria has undergone a rigorous
 program of consolidation and integration into the Soviet
 sphere Q and national feeling has been deliberately played
 down.   It can be assumed that any "renaissance of Bulgarian
 nationalism" must necessarily take place within this
 established Satellite framework,

 Comment:  There has never been evidence to support per-
 sistent rumors that Mao and Liu head opposing factions in
 the Chinese Communist party and governments    While reliable
 information on the private views of CCP leaders is lacking,
 the public pronouncements of Mao and Liu have been complemen-
 tary.   Official Chinese Communist releases strongly suggest
 that Mao dominates the CCP and that Liu is his trusted
 subordinate,

 unconfirmed,  the Peiping regime could be expected to lean on
 Soviet technical assistance in Tibet as in the rest of

 Recurrent reports in recent months relate the Chinese
 Communist effort to accelerate modernization of Tibet.   The

 policy, which is formulated in Paris, will be affected by
 Letourneau's absence.
 Whenever Letourneau is absent from Paris, his position
 there will probably be filled by a secretary of state without
 full responsibility.   (C Paris 6029,  1 Apr 52)
 Comment-   Letourneau has been one of the strongest French
 supporters of his country's position in Indochina.   This selec-
 tion of a cabinet member to be Minister Resident in Saigon is
 an indication that the French Government is determined to end
 the rumors that it was contemplating a withdrawal,

 reports  -                                                              25X1
 t ax t_tt'F army has asked the Union o  Burma Airways to transport
 1400 troops from Rangoon to the town of Kengtung in north-
 eastern Burma over a ten-day period beginning 27 March.
 An American official was privately informed that the ob-
 jective of this operation is the capture of the Chinese Nation-
 alist airfield at Mong Hsat, 60 miles southwest of Kengtungo
 25X1A
 Comment-   Previous Burmese military operations against
 the Ciin'~esemNationalists have been unsuccessful,
 Latest reports indicate that the Nationalists around Mong
 Hsat are well-equipped and far outnumber the Burmese force
 being flown to Kengtung.,
 Karens in southeastern Burma planning attack on Moulmein:
 Karen  orces  n sout easternurma are reported to 15e _p anning
 a 13 April attack on Moulmein, Burma's third largest port.
 These troops, numbering about 9,000 well-equipped men, recently
 received two air-drops of arms.   They believe that their arms,
 which have been obtained in Thailand in exchange for tungsten
 ore, originated from American sources and their morale is
 high.  (                                    )     25X1A
 Comment-   Information from other sources indicates that
 this report exaggerates the size of Karen armed forces in
 southeastern Burma.     There is no evidence of air-drops in the
 area, and although the trading of tungsten ore for arms by the
 Karens has been reported on a number of occasions,  the source
 of these arms has never been determined,

 The Karens have been more aggressive in southeastern
 Burma recently, but there is no reliable evidence that they
 are prepared to attack the comparatively large garrison at
 Moulmein.
 12.           Comment on new Indonesian Cabinet:  Although led by an
 unimpressive prime   im nis erg  lie new Indonesian cabinet appears
 to be slightly stronger than the former government,   With the
 exception of two ministries -- Foreign Affairs and Economic
 Affairs -_ the various portfolios are held by fairly able and
 experienced men.   This is particularly true of the Defense
 Minister  (the Sultan of Jogjakarta) and the Minister of Home
 Affairs  (Mohammed Ruin), the latter a leader of the Masjumi
 liberal wing.   The appointment of the Sultan, one of the most
 capable and popular men in Indonesia, promises improved treat-
 ment of the country's outstanding problem -- the lack of
 internal security.   Mohammed Rum should be able to provide the
 Sultan with necessary cooperation from the Home Affairs
 Ministry,
 The cabinet's foundation on a coalition of Indonesia's
 two largest parties, together with inclusion of representatives
 of the small but influential Socialist Party, appears to pro-
 vide it with the necessary parliamentary support to work
 effectively toward accomplishment. of its program, particularly
 in regard to attempts to solve the country's widespread inse-
 curity.   Unfortunately, however,  Indonesian governments are
 frequently threatened as much from internal dissension as from
 public and parliamentary opposition.   The former cabinet fell
 largely as a result of internal political rivalry;  it is
 almost inevitable that similar rivalries will appear in the
 present government.   (Factual data based on R Djakarta 1447
 and 1451,  2 and 3 Apr 52)
 13.         Spain's Moroccan policy outlined.-   Current Spanish policy
 legal status for the Moroccan nationalist Islah Party and close
 relations with its local leader, Torres; amnesty for nationalist
 exiles from the Spanish Zone, despite any connections they may
 have with the Rif leader, Abd-el-Krim;   improved economic con-
 ditions; provisions for increasing native participation in the
 Khalifian government; and opposition to France's Moroccan
 policy.   To attain these objectives, special security measures
 in Spanish Morocco is reported   o  ave the following objectives:

 will be taken and efforts made to obtain the active support
 of "well-disposed" Moroccans, especially the upper class.
 Torres is reportedly receiving personal favors and finan-
 cial aid from the Spanish Government, which hopes to use him
 in  lannin  and promoting an Arab-Spanish bloc.                            25X1
 Comment:   Spain expects its current conciliatory policy
 towar  t e  oroccan nationalists to enhance its prestige and
 influence throughout the Arab world, and indirectly to
 strengthen its bargaining position vis-a-vis France, Britain,
 and the United States.   The reported plan for increased
 security precautions indicates that Spain intends to control
 the course of developments in its zone.
 The formation of political parties was authorized by a
 Spanish decree on 12 March.   Moroccan nationalists, however,
 feel that, because of the many restrictions included, any
 real political activity will be dependent on the good will
 of the Spanish High Commissioner.  Moreover, Islah leaders
 are alarmed over reports that a rival nationalist party will
 be sponsored by the Spaniards.

 Comment:   No new election for vice president will be held.

 will become acting vice presidents   Teisaire will hold this
 post at least until the new Congress convenes next May, when
 the Senate may reelect him or select another president pro

 the president die or resign,  the acting vice president would
 take over his functions only until special elections for president
 and vice president were called.
 Quijano's death will not significantly affect the admin-
 istration's policies, since he was politically inactive and
 Teisaire is chairman of the Peronista Party.

 to yield on this point, the resulting official and public re-

 would impair the effectiveness of the American military and
