 ARAB-ISRAELI  CONFLICT
 USSR NOTES KISSINGER'S EGYPT, ISRAEL TALKS ON DIISENGAGMENT
 Moscow is giving somewhat more news coverage to Secretary Kissinger's
 third visit to the Middle East than it had to his previous trips,
 Moscow has avoided any hints of displeasure at the secretary's
 prominent role, reporting his comings and goings in a factual
 manner. It has, however, drawn attention to its own stake in
 the negotiations by revealing, in a TASS report on the 16th,
 that Gromyko had held a "friendly"' talk with the Egyptian
 ambassador, presumably to receive the latter's briefing on
 the course of the talks.  Cairo radio had announced on the
 15th that Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi had sent a letter
 to Gromyko informing him about developments.  Cromyko was
 reported by TASS as having reaffirmed the USSR's "consistent
 line" in support of the just cause of Egypt and the other Arab
 states.
 Soviet media have chronicled Kissinger's movements back and
 forth between Egypt and Israel in short, strafi,gh,.forward
 reports, noting that the main topic of discussion was the
 issue of disengagement.  Arabic-language broadcasts on the
 12th reported Kissinger as having expressed hope to the
 Egyptians that he would be able to find a decision acceptable
 to both. sides and that an agreement could be reached on the
 principles of troop separation. Cairo's AL-AHRAM was cited
 as saying Kissinger had shown understanding of the Egyptian.
 attitude on this issue.  Subsequent Moscow Arabic-language
 broadcasts noted news agency reports that Israel had agreed
 to proposals to solve the problem; they also cited Egyptian
 Foreign Minister Fahmi's statement that the Israeli plan brought
 by Kissinger was "unsatisfactory=" and that an Egyptian plan
 had been presented to Kissinger.
 The only skeptical observation on the progress in discussions
 thus far came in a domestic service newscast on the 14th,
 which reported Kissinger's return to Aswan and remarked
 that "through. Tel Aviv's fault," the problems of troop
 disengagement ",ire proving to be very complicated."
 Criticizing details of Israel's proposals publicized earlier, a
 panelist on the weekly observers roundtable broadcast by Moscow
 radio on the 13th pointed to Israel's demand for reduction of
 Egyptian forces and armaments in the canal zone and called
 Israel's ideas "clearly unrealistic."  Earlier, TASS, in reporting

 Kissinger's arrival in Cairo on the 11th, had pointed out that
 troop disengagement was one of the points in the "agreement
 reached during Kissinger's Mideast visit" last November, but
 that Isra?1.i "procrastination" in the Kilometer 101 meetings
 and in the meetings of the military working group at the Geneva
 conference had prevented the agreement from being implemented.
 EGYPTIAN POSITION     A Moscow Arabic-language broadcast on
 the 13th, summing up Foreign Minister
 Fahmi's foreign policy statement reported by Cairo radio that
 day, said the proposed Egyptian plan stipulates full Israeli
 withdrawal from Arab territories, the return of the Arab part
 of Jerusalem, and a solution of the Palestinian problem.
 Faiuni particularly stressed, the broadcast observed, that Egypt
 would not agree to the conclusion of a ".separate" peace
 agreement with Israel, since the Middle East problem concerned.
 all, Arab countries.
 Soviet media have repeatedly cited the Cairo press'  insistence
 that disengagement must be linked to a general settlement and
 implementation of Security Counc:!1 resolutions.  The panelist
 on the 13 January observers roundtable declared Moscow's "full
 support" for Egypt's position that disengagement should be
 regarded as the first stage, and that this should be followed
 by the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from all territories
 occupied since 5 June 1967.  The panelist explained that the
 USSR believes that the earliest possible agreement on disengagement
 would make it possible to begin examination of the whole complex
 of problems in a Biddle East settlement.  The panelist did
 not raise the question of whether and how a disengagement
 agreement should be linked to commitments for subsequent withdrawals.
 Soviet media have reported, however, that AL-AHRAII has called
 for linking disengagement to "future steps to be mapped out
 beforehand" and has said that subsequent stages must be carried
 out in accordance with "predetermined dates."  Previous Egyptian
 suggestions for a timetable for staged implementation of
 Security Council Resolution 242, advanced by Cairo in 1968, had
 been endorsed by Moscow at the time as a "realistic proposal."

 ENERGY  CRISIS
 USSR DOWNPLAYS U1S1 CONFERENCE CALL1 DEPICTS WESTERN DISARRAY
 Moscow has originated minimal low-level comment on President Nixon's
 9 January call for a conference of major noncommunist oil-consuming
 countries.  Soviet comment on other aspects of the energy crisis
 and ?^.eviews of foreign press articles present a picture of Western
 disarray.  Moscow reporting has focused on what it describes as the
 self-serving and discriminatory U.S. practices directed against
 both West European and Arab countries and suggests that U.S.
 leadership is not acceptable to most other countries.
 While avoiding any authoritative comment on President Nixon's
 conference initiative, Moscow radio and TASS have carried numerous
 reviews of articles in the Western press indicating that recent
 U.S. policy moves have met with a cautious response at best,
 and that some countries--France in particular--have been sharply
 critical of U.S. intentions.  Moscow's only direct comment on the
 Nixon 9 January proposals, in a radio broadcast to Arab listeners
 on the 14th, asserted that the failure to invite the Arab countries
 to the proposed initial conference on 11 February constituted
 proof of "the biased nature" of the U.S. move and signified
 Western collusion against the Arabs.  Moscow broadcasts in Arabic
 continue to defend the right of the Arab states to employ oil as
 a political weapon and nationalize foreign oil companies.
 Moscow has reported without comment the U.S. invitation to oil
 producer nations to meet later with consumer nation representatives,
 while citing negative Cairo press reaction to this second conference
 proposal,
 On 13 January IZVESTIYA's international affairs department editor-
 Grigoryants avoided discussing the latest U.S, initiative in a
 wide-ranging Moscow radio Roundtable covering other energy develop-
 ments.  However, he maintained that the earlier proposal in
 December for a multination energy action group, promoted by
 President Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger, envisaged a
 united front of capitalist states which the United States would
 attempt to use to break the oil embargo i-..po>.ed by the Arab
 states. He also stated that the recent improvement in the dollar
 exchange rate was "inseparably linked with maneuvering by the
 American oil companies" aimed at increasing their profits.  He
 added that "the panic" existing in Western monetary markets
 mirrored the impact of this maneuvering on the relations between

 the United States and Common Market countries.  In the same
 vein, PRAVDA commentator Ovchinnikov charged on the 13i:h that
 the multinational corporations dominated by the United States
 were deliberately aggravating the situation by engaging in
 speculative activities.  Another PRAVDA commentator, Yuriy
 Kharlanov, wrote on the same day that the oil crisis was a
 manifestation "of the overall illness of capitalism."
 OTHER COMMUNIST     Other communist media have carried little
 REACTION            original comment on President Nixon's
 conference proposals, but the tenor of
 available reporting has been uniformly negative.  Peking has
 not mentioned the subject.  East European media have dissemiuA.ated
 only a few commentaries, wit'it Bulgaria, East Germany and
 Yugoslavia offering the mor,t pointed criticism.  Their common
 theme is the charge that the U.S. initiatives seek to increase
 U.S. influence and control over the Arab and the Western
 capitalist countries.  In a particularly acid commentary broad-
 cast by Belgrade radio on the 9th, Bojan Dimitrijevic contended
 that the U.S. energy action group proposal represented a
 ''colonialist approach" to the solution of the oil shortage
 problem, and that its acceptance would "only provoke new crises,
 conflicts and disagreements."
 U.S. MILITARY "THREAT"     Defense Secretary Schlesinger's remark
 in a TV interview on 7 January on the
 possibility of military reprisals against Arab countries was
 widely criticized as an example of U.S. high-handedness.  Aleksandr
 Druzhinin, a political observer for Moscow radio and television,
 in a Moscow radio broadcast on the 13th accused Schlesinger of
 threatening to use force if the oil embargo was not ended and said
 plans existed for the seizure of oil fields in Saudi Arabia and
 Kuwait.  In a more conciliatory vein, TASS Deputy Director Sergey
 Losev said in an English broadcast to North America the next day
 that such threats were unnecessary, because as soon as Arab goals
 in Palestine were achieved the need to employ "the oil weapon"
 would disappear.  Peking's NCNA transmitted a lengthy raport on
 international criticism of the Schlesinger remarks.  Belgrade's
 TANJUG on 11 January alleged that 3,000 U.S. Marines were deployed
 in France and Spain for possible intervention in the Middle East.

 INDOCHINA
 MILD RESPONSE TO SCHLESINGER WARNING, U.S. PLANES FOR GVN
 Consistent with the moderate tone of current Vietnamese communist
 propaganda, Hanoi and the Front issued no official statements on
 Defense Secretary Schlesinger's reiteration, at his 10 January
 press conference, that the United States might respond to a
 large-scale offensive by North Vietnam.*  Liberation Radio on
 the 11th merely pointed out that this "insolent, slanderous,
 and threatening allegation" had now become a "familar trick
 of the U.S. authorities" but that it can no longer "intimidate"
 anyone.  Chiming in on the 12th, a Hanoi broadcast claimed that
 these "repeated threats" and the Defense Department's announcement-
 on 8 January--that the United States would be replacing Saigon's
 F-5A with the more modern F-5E constituted a "gross violation"
 of the "spirit and letter" of the peace agreement.  Other reaction
 to the F-5E announcement included a 10 January NHAN DAN commentary
 which called the U.S. move a "brazen distortion" of Article 7
 of the Paris Agreement.
 Reflecting similar moderation, Hanoi and the PRG issued restrained
 foreign ministry spokesman's statements in response to the
 recent alleged increase Ln Saigon air attacks on PR.G-held territory--
 and especially the reported bombing of an TCCS compound at
 Due Co in Pleiku Province.  The PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 statemant, released on the 12th, charged that since 29 December
 Saigon had "stepped up its air raids on many populated areas
 deep in the PRG-controlled zone," and labeled "particularly
 serious" the alleged 11 January air actack on Due Co.  The
 PRG protest concluded by warning routinely that the "U.S.
 Government" and Saigon must be held responsible for the
 consequences of "their military adventures."  The DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman's protest was even milder than the PRG's
 and omitted the usual reference to the United States.
 * The DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman had issued statements on
 8 January 1974 and on 26 June, 17 August, and I. December 1973
 protesting speculation by Secretary Schlesinger about the
 possibility of resumed U.S. bombing in the event of an offensive.
 The PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman issued similar protests on
 each occasion, except in August 1973.  See TRENDS of 9 January 1974,
 page 9, for background.

 PRC-GVN
 PRC CLAIMS CONTESTED ISLANDS, RESOURCES IN SOUTH CHINA SEA
 An ll January PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement has
 for the first time specifically laid broad claims to natural
 resources in the sea adjoining four contested South China Sea
 island groups.  Pegged to Saigon's official incorporation--last
 September--of several islands of the Nansha (Spratly) chain
 into a GVN province, the statement reiterated Peking's position
 that China owns the Spratly  as well as the neighboring Hsisha
 (Paracel), Chungsha, and Tungsha islands.*  It charged Saigon
 with intensified encroachment on the Spratly and Paracel
 islands, observing that such actions arouse Chinese "indignation."
 (A 16 January GVN Foreign Ministry statement, responding to
 Peking's protest, charged that the Chinese have recently sent
 men to some of the disputed islands, where they set up tents
 and Chinese flags.  It warned that Saigon would not tDlerate
 such actions, which it said constitute a "threat to the. peace
 and security of the region.")
 Peking long ago claimed territorial sovereignty over the .four
 island groups, in a 15 August 1951 statement by Chou En-lai
 specifying Chinese reservations to a U.S.-sponsored draft of
 an allied peace treaty with Japan.  Peking has since reiterated
 its territorial claim in response to various actions in the
 area by governments--Saigon, Manila, and Taipei--which also
 claim all or part of the four island groups.  The last known
 Chinese protest was contained in a 16 July 1971 speech by PLA
 Chief of Staif Huang Yung-sheng and an accompanying NCNA article
 which denounced Philippine President Marcos' 10 July 1971
 announcement that Manila intended to use armed troops to assert
 its claim to certain of the Spratly Islands.
 Unlike previous statements of Peking's position, however, the
 current spokesman's pronouncement included a specific claim to
 *  The Chinese statement said certain of the Nansha islands,
 "including Nanwei and Taiping" had "not long ago" been put under
 the administration of Saigon's Phuoc Tuy Province.  A 12 J,.nuary
 Saigon press report of a GVN spokesman's remarks that day, in
 response to the PRC protest, said that Saigon in September 1973
 had incorporated islands (called Chungsha by Saigon) into Phuoc
 Tuy Province.

 the "natural resources in the sea areas" around the four island
 groups.  The addition of this claim conforms with and effectively
 completes Peking's efforts in recent years to stake out firm
 positions on the sea resources along the East Asian continential
 shelf, prior to a ruling on this crucial issue at the international
 Law of the Sea conference scheduled to convene this June.  The
 Chinese had already laid claim to sea and seabed resources along
 the China coastline, most recently in a 15 March 1973 foreign
 ministry spokesman's statement protesting a U.S. company's oil
 exploration in the Yellow and East China seas.  Peking had also
 asserted full rights to resources adjoining Taiwan and the

 BREZHNEV ENDORSES MOLDAVIAN KOLKHOZ COUNCIL INNOVATION
 In a 9 January speech at an awards ceremony in Kishinev, Politburo
 member Pelshe for the first time revealed that Brezhnev had endorsed
 the controversial Moldavian kolkhoz council experiment in his
 unpublished speech at the December CPSU Central Committee plenum.
 In making this disclosure, which was reported in PRAVDA as well
 as locally, Pelshe expressed his own approval of the experiment,
 becoming the third Politburo member to do so.*
 Pelshe's comments appeared in a speech presenting an Order of
 Friendship of Peoples to the Moldavian republic.  After praising
 the Moldavian leadership for having shifted control over farms
 from the agriculture ministry to kolkhoz councils, Pelshe
 declared that "it is a pleasure to report to you that at the
 recent CPSU Central Corrunittee plenum Comrade L.I. Brezhnev gave
 a high evaluation to the Moldavian experiment."  BBrezhnev's
 endorsement is not surprising, as he had tentatively endorsed a
 similar proposal for kolkhoz unions in 1966.  Pelshe and
 several other Politburo members had also supported the earlier
 proposal.
 DEBATE OVER ECONOMIC PLANNING SURFACES IN THE CENTRAL PRESS
 The debate over reforms in Soviet economic planning and manage-
 ment, which in recent years has been relatively muted though
 clearly dominated by defenders of the status quo, appears to be
 entering a new stage of more heated polemics.  A highly
 provocative article that sharply criticized the traditional
 system of planning and openly advocated a number of far-reaching
 reforms appeared in the December issue of QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS,
 on the eve of the 10-11 December CPSU Central Committee plenum.
 Although the plenum deliberations have been kept secret in
 accordance with the practice of recent years, the followup
 comment indicates that the plenum focused on problems of economic
 management and considered Brezhnev's cryptic call for "a system
 of measures aimed at raising the effectiveness of management and

 planning and improving the entire economic mechanism."  Despite
 the apparent renewal of official interest in economic reform,
 conservative spokesmen have continued to uphold the virtues
 of the traditional planning system.
 DECEMBER ARTICLE      The QUESTIONS OF ECONOMICS article by a
 prominent Soviet specialist on manpower,
 Ye. L. Manevich, dealt with the problem of improving the use of
 labor and other resources in the economy.  Because of its highly
 provocative content, it was designated a "discussion" article
 by the editors of the journal.
 Pointing to various glaring economic inefficiencies, Manevich
 proposed a number of reforms designed to stimulate the economy
 by reducing the proliferation of central controls, expanding
 the rights of enterprises and production associations, and
 increasing the incentives for management and labor.  His principal
 proposals were:
 4-  Establishment of a single income tax on the
 profits of enterprises in place of the variety
 of payments now levied  on enterprises by the
 state and granting enterprises complete control
 over profits after taxes;
 1-  Reduction of the number of centrally funded
 producer goods in the supply system and
 expansion of commercial trade between enterprises;
 4-  Improvement of the "entire system" of wages
 and bonuses, which has not undergone any basic
 reforms in over 15 years, in order to stimulate
 increased productivity and greater use of
 production reserves.
 In advancing these proposals, Manevich argued that the current
 system of planning and management was seriously impeding
 economic progress.  He charged that present plans were merely
 compiled on the basis of the previous year's results, thus
 encouraging enterprises to hide reserves.  He pointed out, for
 example, that the current system of levies on profits of
 enterprises was too complex and burdensome, consequently
 inhibiting managerial initiative.  He likev:.tse insisted that
 the highly regulated system of wholesale trade, with its
 centrally planned allocations and guaranteed markets, did not

 encourage enterprises to improve the quality of their products.
 And he also charged that the system of incentives was seriously
 hampered by the trend toward reducing wage differentials for
 workers of varying skills and the practice of plaing numerous
 restrictions on the size and use of bonuses.
 OTHER PROPOSALS     Manevich's proposals are similar to other
 currently debated schemes to give enterprises
 greater incentive to adopt "strenuous" plans instead of hoarding
 reserves.  In the 23 May LITERARY GAZETTE philosopher V. Yakushev
 argued that incentives are presently linked too closely with
 plans and quotas, leading enterprises to seek plans that can be
 easily met.  His solution was to detach the incentives from
 the indices for plan fulfillment and base them on the levels of
 production in comparable enterprises.
 'lakushev's proposals and similar proposals by other economists
 to renounce the traditional stress on plan fulfillment and
 transform legally binding plans into "recommendations" were
 denounced in the December issue of the Gosplan organ PLANNED
 ECONOMY by G. Kosyachenko, director of the finance ministry's
 research institute and onetime head of Gosplan.  He attacked
 the proponents of such reforms ror belittling the importance of
 centralized planning.  Those advocating greater independence
 for enterprises and treating central planning as an impediment
 to progress were also attacked in a September ZHURNALIST
 interview by K.N. Rudnev, Minister of Instrument Making,
 Automation Equipment and Control Syptems.

 CHINA
 TENG HSIAO-PING REGAINS MEMBERSHIP ON CCP POLITBURO
 A further step in the rehabilitation of Teng Hsiao-ping, former
 CCP Secretary General who was purged with Liu Shao-chi in 1966,
 was evident on 11 January when he was included ire a list of CCP
 Politburo members in NCNA's account of the funeral for Wang Shu-
 sheng, vice minister of national defense.  Teng surfaced as a
 Vice Premier in April 1973 and was named to the CCP Central
 Committee at tL.e 10th Party Congress in August.*
 The circumstances of his return to the Politburo are not known,
 but it is possible that the decision was taken at the time of
 the reshuffle of PLA military region commanders, announced earlier
 this month.  No plenary session of the Central Committee has been
 announced; the party constitution adopted at the 10th CCP Congress
 says that Politburo members are elected only by Central Committee
 plenums, although in recent gears such constitutional requirements
 have been ignored.   It is poGsible that Teng may also have be-
 come a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.  The 11 January
 NCNA item followed the list of Standing Committee members with
 the names of other Politburo members in stroke order.  Thus,
 immediately after Standing Committee member Chang Chun-ch!ao, NCNA
 listed Teng and then Wei Kuo--ching, although with four strokes in
 both names either could have headed the list of ordinary Politburo
 members.
 The reemergence of Teng, together with the reshuffle of military
 region commanders, seems to show the dominance of Chou En-lai and
 the party-centered coalition he heads,  While Chou and TerLg were
 on opposite sides during the cultural revolution, Teng's administra-
 tive talents and experience should take some of the burden from
 Chou.  Teng's resurgence also signifies that although cultural
 revolution "new things" must be preserved, not all cultural revolution
 changes are permanent.  The promotion should encourage other former
 party officials and reassure them that they were not the target
 of the anti-Confucius camnaien's warning against "calling back to
 office those who have retired."  Teng's new status may also be a
 signal that the long-awaited National People's Congress is not far
 distant and that a decision has been made to give Teng a high state
 Dost.
 *  During the Cultural Revolution, Teng was under heavy fire in the
 Red Guard press and was cited in a few provincial references to the
 "Liu-Teng line."

 PEKING EXPLAINS LIMITS OF CAMPAIGN TO REFORM EDUCATION
 Amid continuing injunctions to correct the sensitive "red" and
 expert balance in the educational system, PRC propagandists have
 explained what is not meant by the call to "go against the tide"
 in educational reform--a slogan introduced last July and endorsed
 at the party congress in August.  Commentators say the call must
 not be interpreted as a green light for disruption of school dis-
 cipline or classroom order.  Teachers and students are to work
 under party tutelage in the same "revolutionary trench" to implement
 Mao's educational line.  Massive purges of educational authorities--
 a damaging aspect of the Red Guards' attack on the educational
 system during the cultural revolution--do not appear in the
 offing, as officials guilty of educational shortcomings have
 been encouraged to remain in their posts and participate in the
 reform.
 The most comprehensive call for party members to steer educational
 activists away from any return to the chaotic school situation of
 the cultural revolution years was set forth in an NCNA article on
 11 January.  It argued that the current drive to safeguard the
 political restraints imposed on the education system during the
 cultural revolution is aimed only at achieving "a better education
 system...and a better revolutionary discipline and order."  To
 illustrate this point, the article described how a local. atudent
 had misread recent calls for educational reform and wrongly con-
 cluded that "I will raise hell, starting today."  Othet students
 quickly denounced this view, explaining that the struggle against
 the "r9visionist" education line "will not bring chaos into the
 sc:iools."  Asserting that prompt republication by central news-
 papers of student complaints against the educational system was
 evidence of the leadership's attention to necessary educational
 reforms, the article specifically praised the Peking party committee
 for successfully rectifying the style of work in Peking's middle
 and primary schools.
 Judging by the methods approved for carrying out educational
 changes, Peking is seeking to prevent the campaign from degenerating
 and slipping from party control.  A Hangchow broadcast on 11 January,,
 for example, lauded a local party committee for helping activists
 use "facts and reasoning to persuade" those guilty of mistakes in
 educational work to "stand firm, and take an active part in the
 revolution in education."  SimilarlL, a Kweiyang radio article on
 8 January concluded that even in areas where there are many problems
 the majority of cadres are good, and that discussion and persuasion

 should be used instead of suppression to overcome shortcomings.
 Calls for educational reform continue to stress the need to follow
 the party's lead.  A Foochow broadcast on 8 January revealed
 that the first secretaries of several local party committees are
 "personally" in charge of the drive.
 A Central issue in the debate now raging on educational reform
 is the longstanding problem of carving out a permanent place for
 worker-propaganda teams in the schools.  New indications of tension
 between the teams and educational authorities--an endemic theme
 in PRC media since 1968, when the teams responded to Mao's call
 to enter the schools and conduct educational inform--surfaced
 in a Sian broadcast on 10 January that specifically asked party
 committees to intensify their efforts to overcome opposition to
 worker teams in the schools.  Disruption of classroom activities
 does not appear to be a task of the teams, as the broadcast also
 praised local workers for making teachers more aware of their
 responsibility to raise the cultural level of backward students.
 Another major reform championed by critics of the educational
 system is the need to strike a better equilibrium between political
 and professional training in the schools.  Taiyuan radio on
 11 January expressed concern over tha heavy emphasis in recent
 years on professional studies, a means used to salvage a new
 educational system from the ruins of the cultural revolution.
 1 cflact-Ar.ag  the  Ghoi:t  b.h;:lft given to a policy dear to Mao's heart,
 the article noted that during one period of 20 months at Shansi
 University only one month was spent going down to villages and
 factories.

 NOTES
 CSCE:  TIMING OF FINAL STAGE:  As the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) reconvened on 15 January after the
 holiday recess, Moscow commentators remained vague about how
 long the present second stage might last or when the third
 and final stage would be called.  Moscow has now become more
 cautious about committing itself publicly to any precise
 timetable, in contrast to last fall, when before the second
 stage of the CSCE talks began in Geneva both Iloscow and its
 East European allies were virtually adamant in demanding that
 the second stage be concluded and the third convened before
 the end of 1973.  While this may reflect declining expectations
 regarding the CSCE outcome, it also has the effect of increasing
 Moscow's negotiating flexibility.
 The present phraseology calls for cor-clus_+on of the present
 stage and convening the third and final stage by "spring or
 summer."  This was the phrase used by PRAVDA's Orestov on 23
 December and by the same paper's Kolesnichenko on 6 January.
 IZVESTIYA's Grigoryants used a similar time frame on the
 weekly iIos' w radio international discussion program on
 13 January, saying it was "possible" to hold the concluding
 stage in "late spring or early summer."  East European
 spokesmen have been similarly cautious, with Hungary's newly
 appointed foreign minister Puja expressing hope on 10 January,
 after meetings with Gromyko and Brezhnev, that the third stage
 "might be held soon, perhaps in the summer."  The head of
 the GDR delegation to the CSCE, Bock, has also been reported
 ac saying that the third stage should be held in the first
 half of 1974.
 SOUTH KOREAN EMERGENCY MEASURES:  Although Pyongyang, Peking,
 and Iloscow have criticized South Korea for promulgating stringent
 emergency measures on 8 January, Pyongyang and Moscow have not
 reacted at the same level as they did in December 1971, when
 a similar state of emergency was imposed.  On 11 January
 Pyongyang released an "authorized" KCNA statement sharply
 denouncing the measures adopted by "the Pak Chong-hui puppet
 clique in its new move of fascist suppression against the South
 Korean people."  Under similar circumstances in 1971, however,
 Pyongyang issued a foreign ministry statement.  Iloscow, which in
 1971 had published a signed article in PRAVDA. denouncing the
 state of emergency, has responded to the latest move with several

 16 JANUARY 1974
 tendentious TASS reports and comparatively restrained radio
 commentaries broadcast in Korean.  Peking condemned South.
 Korea both times in PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator articles.
 MOSCOW ROUNDTABLE "SPONTANEITY":   An insight into the spontaneity--
 or lack of it--on Moscow radio's domestic service Sunday "inter-
 national observers' roundtable" was provided by the 13 January
 weekly roundtable.  In what appears to be a break with usual
 practice, one section of this program was en almost verbatim
 repeat of a commentary broadcast the previous day by Moscow's
 domestic service.  The discourse among the panelists has generally
 appeared to be unscripted and spontaneous, but it has not been
 uncommon for sections of the roundtable to be rebroadcast at
 a later time or date and attributed to a roundtable panelist.
 In the 13 Jav.uary roundtable, remarks by IZVESTYA international
 affairs editor Boris Dmitriyev on the Middle East disengagement
 talks repeated, with a few emendations, a commentary attributed
 only to "our observer" broadcast on the 12th.  An introductory
 paragraph in this commentary referring to Secretary Kissinger's
 talks in Egypt was omitted by Dmitriyev, and the commentary's
 concluding paragraph was read in the roundtable program by
 radio/TV commentator Druzhinin, as if he were commenting on
 Dmitriyev's discussion.
 BREZHNEV TRIP TO CUBA:  No date has been announced for Brezhnev's
 trip to Cuba although both Moscow and Havana had indicated last
 July, shortly after Brezhnev's U.S. visit, that he would go to
 Havana at the end of the year.  A report of a TASS interview with
 Cuban central committee secretary Blas Roca, published in PRAVDA
 on 13 January, cited the Cuban party official's remarks that the
 "impending" visit by Brezhnev is of "great international significance"
 since it is taking place during a time of major global changes and
 in an "atmosphere of relaxation of tensions."  In comment pegged
 to the visit, the media have stressed the importance. of Soviet
 economic aid to Cuba, citing effusive Cuban praise for the "main
 role" such aid has played in the development of the Cuban economy.
 It has also hailed the visit, the first by Brezhnev to Cuba, as a
 "historic new landmark" in further strengthening Soviet-Cuban ties.
 Moscow has also drawn attention to the visit's significance in the
 context of international detente, thus suggesting that Moscow does
 not anticipate the visit will be an irritant to its relations
 with the United States.
