THE THREE STAGES OF THE CAMTAIGN FOR THOUGHT REFORM IN COMMUNIST CHINA 
HU SHIH 
1 b 9 tx 4 
According to Mr. Edward Hunter, the new terms "Brainwashing" and 
"Brain-changing" were coined by the plain people of China. 
It seems quite possible that those plain folks in my country 
who invented these succinct and picturesque terms most probably had in 
mind some such old Chinese tales like the one told by Pu Sung-ling 
and translated by Herbert A. Giles in his "Strange Stories from 
a Chinese Studio" (pp.56-65). The story tells of a Mr. Chu who 
was "an egregious dunce" and could not even pass the first 
examinations for civil service. But, by a strange accident, he 
became an intimate friend and companion of the Infernal Judge in 
night 
the Courts of Purgatory, who frequently visited him at/hip home 
les 
and drank with him vast quantity of wine. One night Mr. Chu 
got tipsy and fell asleep, leaving the Judge drinking by himself. 
In his drunken sleep, Mr. Chu seemed to feel a pain in his stomach, 
and waking up he saw that the Judge had cut open his body and was 
carefully arranging his inside. 
"Don't be afraid", said the Judge, laughing, "lam only providing 
you with a more intelligent heart. ...Your heart (the seat of 
the intellect) wasn't at all good at writing compositions, the 
proper orifice being stuffed up. I have now provided you with 
a better one which I procured from Hades".

The Judge of Purgatory then quietly put back his friend's viscera 
and closed up the opening, securing it with a bandage tied tightly 
around his waist. He took the old heart and left him. 
"From that moment", so the story goes, "Chu became an apt scholar", 
composed fine essays, and "passed first on the list for the bachelor's 
degree, and then among the first five for the master's degree". His 
old comrades who had been accustomed to make a laughing-stock of him, 
were not astonished to find him a full-blown chu-jen 
Some such folk tales probably furnished the background out of 
which have come the apt terms of "Brain-washing" and "Brain-changing", 
which the plain folk of China naively conceive as somekind of 
almost painless surgical operation by the magic power of an 
Infernal Judge of the Courts of Purgatory. 
But what the Chinese Communists call "Thought Reform" is a much 
more complicated and difficult affair. Indeed it is a trememdous 
undertaking involving thousands and tens of thousands of people 
and requiring long months and even long years of concentrated 
political effort, political pressure and mass pressure, endless 
self-criticism and criticism of self-criticism, and endless 
confessions of error and self-debasement. 
Mao Tse-tung, in his "The People's Democratic Dictatorship" 
published July 1, 1949, made this statement on the policy of 
Thought Reform:

"The People's State protects the people. Only when there is the 
People's State will it be possible for the people to use democratic 
methods on a Nation-wide and all-comprehensive scale to educate and 
reform themselves, to free themselves from the influence of re-
actionaries at home and abroad (which influence is at present still 
very great, and will continue to exist for a long time, and cannot 
be eliminated Quickly), to reform the bad habits and bad ideas acquired 
from the old society, not to allow themselves toll on the erroneous 
ways led by the reactionaries, and to continue to advance and develop 
toward a Socialist and a Communist society. The methods we use in this 
work will be the democratic methods of persuasion, not the methods of 
coercion. 
If 
This brief paragraph summed the objectives and the methods of the 
Communist campaign for Thought Reform. The Objective is to 
"protect the people", to protect them from going wrong: it is to 
educate and "remould" (kai tsao) the people, to free them from the 
influence of reactionaries at home and abroad, and to reform (kai 
tsao) their bad habits and bad thoughts acquired from the old society. 
The methods are to be "the democratic methods of persuasion", that 
is, the methods of "Criticism and self-criticism" 
Even as Mao was proclaiming "the Peop;e's Democratic Dictatorship" 
(July 1, 1949), a program of Thought Reform had already been 
rigorously carried out in Manchuria and North China. The North 
China University of the People's Revolution was only one of the 
better known large centers of Thought Reform, to which many 
thousands of young and old men and women who had or were suspected 
to have had ties with the old regime, were sent for indoctrination 
and reform. The students there, numbering at all times from eight 
to ten thousand, once included two former mayors of Peiping as 
well as my own younger son. The "Thought Conclusion" of my 
son in which he denounced his father as an enemy of 
the People and his own enemy, was published in Red China in

September, 1950, after he had been there for nearly a year. 
Many older people were kept there for much longer time. 
Beginning with fall opening of the schools in 1949, there was 
established in every school, from the primary grade to the 
university, what was called "the Big Course" which consisted 
of nine hours per week of "Political Science" taught by 
trained Communist teachers, and which all teachers as well as 
all students were required to attend. Small Study Groups were 
formed to discuss and analyse the contents of the Big Course, 
and to apply them to the personal and professional thinking and 
conduct of every member of each group. 
Many university professors of national and international reputation, 
such as Feng Yu-lan and Ch'ien Tuan-sheng, were sent to the interior 
rural areas to participate in "land reform". This, was a part of the 
Thought Reform Program, and its purpose, as Feng Yu-lan has vividly 
described in his report, was to make those intellectuals go through 
the actual practices and the mental and emotional experiences of 
confiscation of land and farming implements from the small landlords 
and of their redistribution to the landless. When they were participating 
in these "reforms" in the interior, they had also to undergo the new 
experience of being subjected to the questioning and criticism, of self-
criticism by the local party agents and the masses. Professor Ch'ien 
Tuan-sheng testifies . that this questioning and criticism in the rural 
areas was the most effective method he had ever experienced in his own 
ideological re-education.

This relatively long period from early 1949 to the fall of 
1951 was the First Stage of Thought Reform. 
The Communist Party and Government had by this time (1951) secured 
control over a-aumlier-ef all? institutions of higher learning including 
the Catholic and Protestant universities and the Rockefeller-founded 
Peiping Union Medical College. Party organizations were formed in all 
colleges and universities, of which there were 24 in the Peiping and 
Tientsin area alone. Representatives of the Party sat in the 
administrative committees of all these institutions. 
But the few older universities, - notably Pieta and Tsing Hua - 
were internally still more or less intact, and because of their 
academic standing and national prestige, and because of their long 
tradition of political independence, were still capable of putting 
up a measure of resistance to the interference and control of 
tbe '?arty representatives in their institutions. They were twice 
successful in actually resisting the Communist Government's program 
for a thorough reorganization and regrouping of the universities and a 
thorough revision of the university curriculum in the direction of 
lowering standards and shortening the years of study. 
Under ihe government program of university reorganization, there 
was to be only two types of universities: (1) the comprehensive 
university which is to be confined to the Humanities, the

(2) 
physical sciences, and the social sciences including law; and the 
technical university, either of Technology, or of Medicine, or of 
Agriculture. Peking University, for example, was to merge with 
Yenching University and form a comprehensive university by giving up 
its colleges of Medicine and Engineering: and Tsing Hua was to give up 
its colleges of Letters and Social Science and become .a University 
of Technology. Opposition from the two universities was so strong that 
the Communist vice-minister of Education had to make a verbal promise 
that those two universities were not to be included in the scheme 
or reorganization, and the whole program was postponed for many 
months. (See the published 1952 confessions of Dean Chou Plei-yuan 
and other professors of Tsing Hua, and of Professor Shen Shih-hua 
of Peita's college of Engineering.) 
But the really important issue at stake was the universities' resistance 
to Party Control. I quote this revealing paragraph from Dean Chou 
P'ei-yuan's confession published in the Kuangming jihpao on 
April 8, 1952, when the struggle was all over: 
'My understanding of the (Communist)?Party organization inside the 
university was also quite wrong._ I have been using the .!professional' 
standards' of the bourgeois class to judge the Party comrades, whom 
I regarded as too young and professionally beneath my standards. I 
have therefore subjectively and erroneously concluded that they were 
not to play any important role in matters concerning unversity 
teaching and administration. During all these past three years, 
I have ignored the importance of the the ideological leadership 
of the Party in the university and never consulted the Party 
organization in all important questions of university administration." 
This resistance to Party control was intolerable and must be crushed 
at all cost. The leading universities, and Peita and

Tsing Hua in particular, therefore, must be beaten, humiliated 
and forced to surrender whatever spirit Of independence was left 
in them. This, as all the 1952 confessions undoubtedly indicate, 
was the real motive and the real cause for the launching of the 
big-scale campaign of Through Reform which began in the last week 
of September, 1951. 
This Second State of Thought Reform was called "the Study Movement 
of the Teachers of all Schools of Higher Learning in the Peking 
and Tientsin Area". It included all the 24 universities and colleges 
and all the scientific research institutes in that area. Three 
thousand thachers took part in the beginning, and the number grew to 
6188 in November and to 6523 in early December. 
The press frankly reported that "this Study movement for ideological 
reform was not only to lay the foundation for a systematic and 
long-term study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung thought, but 
also to serve as "the primary condition for the reform of higher 
education." The heads of the universities were ordered to set the 
example of self-criticism by making frank and self-debasing confessions. 
The students in these institutions were mobilized to bring pressure 
on the teachers by cheering and welcoming them in their "voluntary" 
effort to study and reform. 
The Study meetings were soon directed to concentrate on one big 
question: Wham do we serve? And against whom do we fight? 
norinccifiprl in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/07/12 : CIA-RDP83-00423R000100030001-6

The answer was: of course we serve the people and fight our enemy. 
Who are our enemies? Our enemies are the imperialistic USA and all 
those reactionaries who have been poisoning the people with thoughts 
and ideals of American origin. 
So the teachers, who had had the misfortune of an American education, had 
to make solemn confessions of their past errors of worship of America and 
love for America, and solemnly pledge, henceforth, to despise and hate 
America. The sole exception was Prof. Pan Kuang-tan of Tsinghua who con-
fessed tha, while he had never been guilty of worshiping America, he could  
not yet have the heart to hate America. 
And the professors of Peking University had to hold many meetings to 
accues and repudiate Hu Shih; those of Tsinghua University, to accuse and 
repudiate Mei Yi-chi(Y.C.Mei); and those of Nankai University, to accuse and 
repudiate Chang Poling. But the arch-reactionary of them all was Hu Shih 
who is said to have spread the poisonous thoughts of individualism, 
liberalism, and reformism(that is, melioriam as opposed to revolutionism) 
for ove r 30 years and whose evil influence is said to be still deep-rooted 
in the country. So the campaign to "accuse Hu SOih and criticize ourselves" 
was extended to Shanghai in early Dec 1951, and to South China in the 
last days of the year. 
But all this was not enough. Loud professions of complete ideological 
reform, of hating and despising America, of declaring Hu Shih's thoughts 
as "enemy thoughts",---all this was not enough to bring about a complete 
breakdown of the

spirit of independence in the leading universities, and to secure a 
complete political control of those institutions by the Party. 
Therefore, there had to be a Third Stage in the campaign for Thought 
Reform--which came in the first months of 1952 in the form of the 3-anti 
campaign and its speedy application to the universities. 
The "3-anti# campaign was anti-corruption, anti-waste and anti-bureaucraticism. 
All were criminal charges under the Communist regime. 
The students and the junior staff of the universities were quickly mobili-
zed to expose all forms of corruption, vaste and bureaucratic practices in 
all the universities and colleges. Very little evidence of corruption was 
unearthed. Of bureaucraticiam, there was plenty; every sign of political 
independence, every word of gesture of intellectual arrogance toward 
the Party representaitv9, every move of resistance to government policy 
of university reorganization or curriculum revision, was bureaucraticism. 
But the most spectacular exposures came under the charge of waste,?waste 
of the People's money in the over-stocktiling of sciehtific laboratory equip-
ment and materials, in the wilful purchase of expensive foreign(especially 
American) equipment and materials when cheaper but equally serviceable 
home-made goods could have been substituted, and in the wasteful loss and

destruction of these materials through faulty storage and careless 
handling. Of all these forms of waste, there was a vast amount of 
alleged evidence. 
There was speedily organized a gigantic "exhibition of the anti-waste 
Campaign in the Peking Schools of Higher learning", which was open to 
the public. The press reported that "on the basis of incomplete estimates 
made in ten leading universities alone(including Peita, Tsinghua, Yenching 
university-, the Normal University, the Catholic Fu Jen university, and the 
Peiping Union Medical College), the wasteful accumulation and careless 
destruction of equipment and materials has resulted in a total loss of 
S50,800,000,000! 
money amounting to JMP$50-,4040y000-1 This sum of money is enough to buy 
34 jet fighter planes! It is also enough to pay for the livelihood of the 1002 
university professors in the whole area of Peking for four years and 
five monthsf' All these are great crimes against the People. 
So the Party comrades got the goods on the professors and the adminis-
trators of the universities. The universities were loudly criticized 
and publicly condemned. A Kuang ming Jihnao reporter described thus 
the plight at Tsinghua university: 
"During the 3-anti war, after the entire student body had 
enthusiastically assisted their teachers in exposing the ugly 
faces of their bourgeois class ideblogies, the vast majority 
of professors were now able to see clearly the dirt and poison 
in themselves, and have now begun to acknowledge the real 
danger of the whole ugly situation. In their meetings of 
milt criticism and self-criticisn, very many professors were 
saying in tears: !My body is full of poisonous germs, and I 
only now wakeup --as if from a dreamt!"

hints of the enormity of the political pressure and the awful pressure 
of "the masses" as represented by the incited student body. 
This third and political stage of Thought Reform by means of the 
3-anti campaign at last succeeded in crushing the spirit of political 
indepepdende in the universities. "Not until the 3-anti campaign did I 
discover my real errors.., .1 now profoundly reali ze that my bureau-
craticism has made me a criminal against the people" so confessed Professor 
Liang Ssu-cheng, son of the great Liang Chichao and head of the 
Architecture School at Tsinghua, who tiad been one of the strongest 
opponents to the Communist government's plan of university reorganization 
and revision of cirriculum. And Dean Chou Pei-yuan of Tsinghua, another 
leader in the opposition to the reorganization plan, was made to say: 
"The three-anti campaign led by Chairman Mao has at last awakened me from 
a terrible nightmare. I now acknowledge that the Party is the leader 
in all our work, and that it is our most faithful and most loving 
friend.... Henceforth, I shall resolutely obey the leadership of the 
Party, and shall closely rely upon the Party in carrying on my work". 
"I thank the Party, and I thank Chairman Mao. The Party has educated 
me and enabled me to see the light."

Thus was finally achieved the main and real objective of the entire 
campaign for the ideological reform of the intellectuals. The spirit 
of independence and resistance was apparently crushed?--not by thought 
reform?--not by the "demodratic methods of persuasison", ---but by force 
and intimidation. At least all overt manifestations of that spirit 
disappeared. The Communist governmentis policy of university reorganization 
and curriculum revision was carried out last summer in all Red China. It 
met no opposition from any quarter. 
4HHHHHHHHOH8HH8K-
How far has the Communist Party and Government succeeded in washing or 
changing the brains of the Chinese intellectuals? Some intellectuals 
were apparently capable of achieving an easy and quick success in thought 
reform. Such was the case of Professor Pei Wenichung? the geologist and pale?
ontologist who attained world fame as the first discoverer of the Peking 
Man. In an eloquent confession published three years ago, het proudly pro?
claimed that he had readily completed his thought reform in being able to 
successfully apply Marxism?Leninism to all three sciences in which he was a 
workerx, namely, geology, paleontology and archaeology. His confession 
was prominently given the first place in a volume of earliest confessions 
published in 1950. He had attained. 
Other stubborn intellectuals, howerver, seemed to make very slow progress 
in this business. One of the outstanding examples of this type is Pro?
fessor Chin Yueh?lin, the logician and philosopher of Tsinghua university. 
In his most recent

confession published on April 17,1952, he tells us that he had been 
"studying" for thought reform ever sime March and April of 1949--
exactly 4 years ago. By 1951, he still made no great progress. So he was 
ordered to study Mao Tse-tungIS essay "On Practice". "Then by the spring 
of 1951" , he tells us, "my tYlingking came near to a sudden change.... 
Two years of piecemeal understanding culminating in the study of the Essay 
on Practice, has mad d MB recognize that dialectic materialism was in es-
sense quite different from the old philosophies. The old philosophies are 
I meta-physical and basically anto4scientific? whereas dialectic and ma-
terialism is scientific philosophy; it emphatically is the truth". 
And'he goes on to confess: "In the 1951 discussion on the revision of 
university curriculum, I further recognized that the duty and function 
of the department of philosophy in a university was to train propaganda 
workers for Marxism-Leninism". 
All these confessions of a "sudden change" or sudden awakening frum a 
most rugged individualist should be considered successful "briin-washing" 
0 
and even "brain-changing"4et his Red Masters apparently were not satis-
fied. Ft* he was made to go on "studying" long after his 2sudden change" in the 
spring of 1951, and was still publishing more se1f4debasing criticisms 
during the 3-anti campang of 1952. And a report reached me last November 
that he was among the six intellectuals "purged" in that month.

Perhaps real brain-washing and real brain-changing afe after all 
impossible tasks,--miragles, which could only be performed by 
some Infernal Judge of the Courts of Purgatory. Perhaps my former student 
Mao Tse-tung showed some real wisdom when in July 1949, he remarked parenthe-
tically that "the influence of reactionaries at home and abroad.., 
will continue to exist Lor a long time, and cannot be eliminated 
quickly."
