 SECTION I.  SUMMARY OF FAR EAST TRE14DS AND DEVELOPMENTS
 All other Far Eastern developments this week paled in comparison
 to the   gpect   Communist invasion of southern Korea.  At this
 writing,       doubtful whether cohesive southern Korean resistance
 will continue beyond the next 24 hours (see map and repot, pp. 1-2).
 In the context of this climactic event, Indian Prime Minister Nehru
 has completed a tour of Southeast Asia, during the course of which
 he departed from his usual anti-imperialist theme and outspokenly
 denounced Communism in the area (p. 1)m  Meanwhile, it is estimated
 that., while the Chinese Communist probably will not take an active
 role in the Korean war, the strength or weakness of US efforts to
 assist the southern Korean regime may well govern the future Chinese
 attitude toward Taiwan and Indochina (p. 3).
 Elsewhere, 0 US observers complained of French stalling in
 Indochina (p. 5), and the Burmese Socialist Party's impending split
 over East---Vest orientation may be affected by the Korean attack (p0 6).

 SECTION Ile  DEVEL)PMMTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS
 GENERAL
 Nehru ends successful tour of Southeast Asia India's Prime Minister,
 Pandit Nehru, has completed a highly successful tour of Indonesia,
 Malaya and Burma, during which he was enthusiastically welcomed by all
 except the local Chinese and Co-=unists.  Although many observers feared
 that Nehru would take this opportunity to denounce Western colonialism
 in Southeast Asia, he instead advocated cooperation between Asia and
 the iVest and launched a totally unexpected and surprisingly violent
 attack upon Conn nism?  4hile he continued to maintain that the strongest
 force in Asia was nationalism and that colonial imperialism would soon
 disappear, Nehru warned that imperialism survives "in other foams" even
 though it might speak in terms of freedom and social change.
 Nehru advised the Indonesians not to sever all their ties with the
 Netherlands, admitted the necessity for continued British suzerainty over
 Malaya for the present, and tried to point out the advantages of foreign
 investments to the Burmese.  Specifically regarding Communism, Nehru
 indicated his belief that Communism was losing ground because it had
 "not only parted company with nationalism, but opposed its"  He charac-
 terized Communist activity in Malaya as "excessively harmful" and not
 to be tolerated and, in Rangoon, denounced the Burmese Communists for
 killing "innocent women and children in their beds,"
 The large crouds which turned out to hear the Indian leader and the
 obvious respect with which he was treated by his official hosts are clear
 evidence that Nehru made a strong and favorable impression throughout the
 area,, not only enhancing his o'vn personal prestige in Southeast Asia, but
 also that of India.  By strengthening popular understanding between India
 and the countries of Southeast Asia, Nehru has probably bolstered India's
 prospects for spiritual, if not de facto, leadership of non-Communist
 Asians,  Finally, Nehru may have lent encouragement to the moderates who
 now control the Governments of Burma and Indonesia, as well as the inci-
 pient Malay nationalist movement, to stiffen their resistance to Communist
 encroachments and thus indirectly strengthened the Western position in
 Southeast Asia at this critical times
 KOREA
 Pub ec t invaders continue advance-On the fourth day of the surprise
 northern Korean invasion of southern Korea, the puppet People's Army is
 continuing to make progress in what appears to be the primary mission of
 capturing the southern capital of Seoul (see map).  Thusfar, 4 divisions
 of the People's Army and 2 brigades of puppet Border Constabulary have

 _3-
 been identified in action,  Armor, with estimates running as high as 70
 medium and light tanks, is in use and the northern Korean air force has
 been involved in limited action.
 Reports just before midnight of 26 June indicate that the capture
 of Seoul is imminent and all available southern troops have been commit-
 ted to the defense of the city. No concerted attempt is being made by
 southern forces to withdraw for continued resistance south of the capital
 and at least one of the four divisions in the Seoul area has been demora-
 lized and cut up.  Meanwhile, critical ammunition shortages are developing
 and it appears that the evident demoralization of the high command is
 affecting southern troops.
 President tthee and his Cabinet are reported officially to have left
 Seoul for an unknown southern destination and the Republic's Premier,
 British Merchant Marino-trained Shin Sungmo, reportedly despairing of
 "saving anything", has handed over full authority to Army Chief of Staff
 Chao Byongduk.  In Chairs opinion, resistance is useless after the fall
 of Seoul.  In the light of these multiple circumstances and the estimated
 ability of the invading People's Army to launch further large-scale of-
 fensives all alon  the line, it is problematical whether cohesive southern
 Korean resistance will continue beyond the next 24 hours.
 CHINA
 Co    et China's role in Korean conflict-.Although the Chinese Communists
 are not expected to play a major role in the Korean invasion, Chinese Com-
 munist leaders may regard Korea as a testing-ground for determining the
 intentions of the West, and Western policy toward the support of South
 Korea may be reflected in Peiping's policy toward both Taiwan and Indo-
 china.
 The Peiping regime has had a continuing interest in strengthening north-
 ern Korean forces for eventual military action against the southern
 Republic.  While the Chinese Communists probably exert no independent
 influence on the northern Korean regime and have no voice in the formula-
 tion of northern Korean policy, a possible total of 20-30,000 Korean
 troops from Manchurian units of the People's Liberation Army have been
 transferred to northern Korea over the past few years, together with
 unknown amounts of materiel?  While it is not anticipated that regular
 Chinese Communist forces will appear in the Korean conflict,, some
 sixty to seventy thousand additional troops of Korean extraction are
 available in Manchuria for transfer to the North Korean forces, should
 this prove necessary,

 There is no necessary connection between events in Korea     and
 Peiping's intentions toward Taiwan.  If tiestern action in support of
 the Republic of Korea is ineffectual, however, the Peiping regime might
 be encouraged to proceed rapidly with the invasion of Taiwan?  Effective
 Western action in Korea, In turn, might delay the invasion of Taiwan
 indefinitely:  on the other hard, if a Korean operation were to in-
 volve the bulk of estern resources available in Asia, it might well
 inspire a Chinese Communist glow against Taiwan at an early date.
 The Invasion of Indochina by regular Chinese Communist forces has
 been regarded as improbable in 19500  The invasion of South Korea by
 North Korean forces does not necessarily imply any change in interna-
 tional Communist strategy as regards the employment of the armed forces
 of Communist regimes against non-Communist states.  Korea is an inde-
 pendent country where the northern puppet's aggression can be uniquely
 disguised as a civil conflict, and the hands of the USSR and Communist
 China are technically clean.  Regardless of developments in Korea, a
 Chinese Communist invasion of Indochina continues to be unlikely so
 long as French capabilitiestdo not improve.  However, the past disin-
 clination of Moscow and Peiping to commit Chinese Communist forces to
 action in Indochina is believed to have derived in part from the risk
 of provoking a third * rld warp  If the North  Korean adventure does
 not evoke any strong Western response, the USSR and Communist China might
 reformulate their strategy for Southeast Asia in this light.
 High 1950 goal set for Manchurian steel industry--The 1950 production         "Gil
 plan for heavy industry in Manchuria, presented by Kao Kang, Chairman
 of the Northeast People's Government in March 1950, has now been re-
 leased in full.  The established goals will require the full-time
 operation of nearly all Manchurian plants which remain, following
 wartime demolitions and Soviet removals.  The 1950 quotas for the iron
 and steel industry are 720,000 tons of pig iron, 540,000 tons of steel
 ingots and 340,000 tons of rolled steel, in contrast to estimates for
 existing Manchurian capacity of 540,000, 500,000 and 500,000 tons
 respectively J,/  The ambitious scope of the Communist plan emphasizes
 the fact thah the Northeast is the only sizable industrial area in
 China which also possesses a heavy industrial base, with ferrous re-
 sources surpassing those. of any other area in quantity,,
 The 1950 iron and steel goals correspond closely to the estimated
 capacity of the two Northeast iron and steel centers,. Anshan and
 Penchihu.  The Communists, however, will be faced with several diffi-
 culties in attaining near-capacity output.  Chief among these is the
 1946 Pauley report figures:  the Communists have repaired two more
 blast furnaces than the Pauley investigators counted on, a fact which
 explains the apparent discrepancy in pig iron figures.

 problem of iron ore supply.                         In contrast to last year's goal of 100,000
 tons of ore, the 1950 output wculd have to exceed a million tons,
 Owing to the almost complete destruction and removal of ore-concentra-
 ting equipments moreover, only high-grade ore, which is harder to mine,
 is processable in the blast furnaces,  Other production problems will
 arise from the lack of key machinerg and the inadequacies of adjunct
 industries such as electric power and cement.  It is noteworthy that
 the Japanese in Manchuria never attained more than 70% of capacity.
 The lack of diversification in Manchuria's steel-finishing plant
 poses an additional problem.  Finishing mills, whose    industrial sse-
 timated at 300,000 tons, are able to produce only small
 shapes, such as concrete reinforcing bars.  An increased output would
 therefore be one-sided in character, and its satisfactory utilization
 in any reconstruction program would require the concurrent importation
 of larger shapes from abroad.
 The physical difficulties of attaining capacity production and the
 necessity of imports may compel the Communists to lower their sights
 in 1950.  Nevertheless, in view of the high priority assigned to the
 iron and steel industry in Manchuria, the extent to which the Communists
 attain their 1950 plan will be a good measure of their all-round econo-
 mic capabilities.                   Even if they attain only half the declared 1950
 goal, the Chinese Communists will have succeeded in more than doubling
 their 1949 Manchurian production..

 actually been transferred and where the locus of authority lies in
 services supposedly handed over, in process of transfer, or to be
 transferred by a decision of the Interstate Conference.  In the case
 of services already "transferred", parallel services continue to
 exist,.  Control of finances, foreign trade and customs, and armed
 forces is still firmly in the hands of the French,
 The French contend that their withdrawal from a position of auth-
 ority would create a dangerous political vacuum in view of the Bao Dal
 Government's failure to establish a competent administration resting
 on a solid popular foundation,  It is nonetheless evident that the
 French themselves are largely responsible for this state of affairs,
 The tenacity of French office-holders in the Indochina civil service,
 their general refusal to assume subordinate positions with respect to
 Vietnamese administrators, the stickiness of the French in relinquish-
 ing to the Vietnamese certain administrative facilities (the palace at
 Saigon is the most conspicuous example ),, and the insistence by the
 French Government that no foreign technicians shall be employed by the
 State of Vietnam, all have rendered Bao Dai's task of assembling a
 competent administration, responsible to him, an almost insuperable
 one.  The few Vietnamese possessing the technical skills essential to
 modern government are not attracted to a regime which the French them-
 selves seem often not to take seriously.  Thus, lacking the capacity
 to attract able Vietnamese and the right to hire foreign experts, the
 State of Vietnam finds itself incapable of establishing the type of
 self-reliant goverment on which mass support and psychological vic-
 tory over the Communist-led Resistance ultimately depends.
 I3R1QA
 South Korea issue and Socialist             Burmese authorities and
 moderate Sonzialists have stated that the smoldering conflict between
 moderates and pro-Communists is about to be climaxed by the expulsion
 of the left wing both from the Government and from the influential
 Burma Socialist Party (BSP), with the Party simultaneously throwing
 its full support behind Prime Minister Thakin Nu,  The split in the
 BSP will probably develop within the next few weeks and may be hastened
 by the leftists' withdrawing before being formally read out of the
 party.
 There are no indications that the pro-Communists are preparing to
 go underground.  Instead, it seems likely that they will seek to form
 a new political organization which would openly support international
 Communism, in opposition to the present Burmese Goverment and its
 Socialist supporters,;  Such a development would clear the befogged
 political atmosphere in Rangoon, considerably, and would seem to oDn mit
 the BSP to a policy of increasing cooperation with the West.

 Since the friction within the BSP is primarily a matter of Burma's
 orientation as between East and west, however, the implication of the
 invasion of southern Korea -while it may cause an initial hardening
 of the moderate Socialists' attitude- could bring the themselves moderates a anti-
 Communist and cause them to reconsider before committing
 Communist position from which It would be difficult to retreat.  On
 balance, the removal of the pro-Communist fraction from the BSP presently
 appears to be a better than 50-x50 chance.
 Ali Japanese Cabinet     stem, except the Premier, are to tender
 their resignations, thus paving the way for the formation of a new
 YOSHIDA Cabinet.  The Liberal Party decision to broaden the bases of responsibility for whatever future commitments Japan and the West may
 mutually agree upon has been strengthened by recent events and the
 Government plans to present a unified non-Commuist policy on foreign
 affairs through the medium of a coalition cabinet.  If a coalition
 cabinet cannot be formed, the ILiberals will at least be in a position
 to justify their future conduct on the basis of being  the Party which
 could not escape responsibility for what the Japanese Government may
 consider unhappy but necessary decisions.  Meanwhile, a lack of "impar-
 tiality" in the coverage of the present

 The UK's lamest active China investment, the Kailan Mining Adninis--

 a million tons of coking coal to Japan.  A recently signed one-year agree-

 right to export its own coal, although the state company will continue

 SECTION Ill.  The Unitary State in Indonesia
 Two distinct and often opposing groups of Indorrsians participated
 in the creation of the USI:    Republicans -who represented the 1947
 Republic of Indonesia (including only Java, Sumatra and Madura); and
 Federalists -who represented other parts of the Indonesian archipelago,
 and were willing to work with the Dutch toward eventual independence.
 Although Federalist influence was actually strongest in the scattered
 islands of East Indonesia, the Dutch had extended military control over
 former Republican areas and had sponsored the creation of separate
 states in such areas, both in Java and Sumatra.  By November of 1949,
 the 1947 .Republic had been reduced to a small area in central Java and
 some relatively undeveloped parts of Sumatra, while the proposed federal
 structure of the USX included 16 areas with differing degrees of autonomy.
 The three most important states, or "Negaraste, in the proposed structure
 were (1) the reduced version of the Republic of Indonesia, (2) East Indo-
 nesia, and (3) East Sumatra.
 The Indonesian government, which was granted sovereignty in December
 1949, was composed largely of leaders of the former Republic.  Sukarno,
 the new President, and Hatta, the new Prime Minister, had held the same
 positions in the Jogjakarta government.  Federalists, in turn, headed
 the Ministries of 'I terior and Information, as well as two ministries
 without portfolio.:/ In general, the first USI cabinet was moderate in
 character.
 within a few weeks, the trend toward a unitary state had become ap-
 parent.  Pro-Republican sentiment was strong in nearly all of the areas
 which had once been under Republican control and, while the majority of
 the 15 Dutch-sponsored states appeared too artificial to endure, the
 move for a unitary state was furthered by the vigorous actions of the
 aggressive nationalists who had gained control of the Jogjakarta Govern-
 ment after the more moderate Republican had become USI officials.
 Jogja propagandists and elements of the former TNI accelerated the
 dissolution of the Dutch-sponsored Negara governments in areas adjacent
 to the Republic and, although most Indoneai ns probably fared a more
 simplified form of government than the federal structure, the USI differed
 with Jogja over the method of achieving this end.  The USI wished, to
 achieve a unitary state by means of deliberate and formal methods:  the
 Jogjakarta Republic cared little about the methods used.,
 At present) this conflict in views is being settled by compromise
 between the two elements.  On 19 May, the USI, acting in behalf of the
 One of these latter, Sultan Hamid of lest Borneo, has been removed
 and is currently under arrest for masterminding a plot to overthrow
 the USI by force.

 states of East Sumatra and East Indonesia, reached an agreement with the
 Jogja Republic which will abolish the federated USI and form a unitary
 state?  The new governmental structure, which is e3gaected to become ef-
 fective by August, will have a constitution combining features of the
 USI's provisional constitution with essentials of the earlier Jogjakarta
 constitution.  Under the agreement, the UST senate will be dissolved
 and the new provisional parliament will combine the former USI House of
 Representatives with the Jogja Parliament's working Committee, and addi-
 tional members of parliament will be appointed by President Sukarno.
 There are several aooarent disadvantages to the elimination of the
 federated structure.  From the US viewpoint, one of the more serious is
 the decision to Incorporate much of the socialistic language of the old
 Jogja constitution into the new constitution, and action which may well
 diminish opportunity and incentive for investment by private US interests.
 The new structure may also enhance the opportunities of pro-Communist
 and ultra-nationalist elements who are strong in the Jogja regime.  There
 is also. a possibility that the provisions in the Hamie agreements con-
 cerning "self-determination" or free expression of the desires of the
 population regarding the ultimate status of territories in Indonesia will
 tend to be ignored.
 A more optimistic view considers the unitary state inevitable and
 more suited than a federated structure to a new government which is
 short of capable administrators and unable to support & multiplicity of
 expansive local governments.  There .is also the hope that a centralized
 authority will suppress friction between local military and civil unite.
 Prime Minister Hatta has assured the Indonesian people that formation of
 a single state will not affect the Round Table agreements and that the
 state would assume only a temporary character until a constituent assembly
 has been set up and steps toward self-determination taken.
