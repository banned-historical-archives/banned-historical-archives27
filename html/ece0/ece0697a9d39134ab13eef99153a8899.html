MEMORANDUM 
NIC 00880 89 
10 August 1989 
This memorandum sets forth procedures for preparing 
Executive Briefs. 
WHAT ARE EXECUTIVE BRIEFS? 
Briefs are designed to provide,policymakers with coordinated, 
policy-relevant analysis on short notice. They are not a 
substitute for Estimates. But they are a means of producing 
estimative intelligence more rapidly and in more abbreviated 
form than is possible with Estimates. Accordingly, like 
Estimates, Briefs should avoid lengthy descriptions of current 
intelligence in favor of predictive, judgmental assertions about 
future uncertainties. 
GENERATING A BRIEF: 
Briefs are generated the same way as Estimates: namely, any 
appropriate senior policy official can request a Brief on a 
specific subject, or the NIO can originate one if he believes 
developments in a particular geographic or issue area have 
created a need for a Brief. In either case, the topic should be 
approved by Chairman or Vice Chairman, NIC. 
PRESENTATION AND PRODUCTION: 
Brevity is essential. Three pages is long enough for most 
Executive Briefs; few should exceed four. Speed is also 
essential. Most Briefs should be completed in two or three 
days; few should require longer than a week.

SUBJECT: Executive Briefs 
The NIC Production Officer is the focal point for ensuring 
that NIC Executive Briefs are produced in a uniform style, to 
the extent feasible. Attached are samples of recent Executive 
Briefs in the style we have adopted for use until the NIC gets 
up to speed with the new workstations and printers and learns to 
use more sophisticated desktop publishing software and 
procedures. To keep abreast of possible refinements of the. 
standard style, please check with the Production Officer before 
starting the process. 
In the current format, developed through trial and error and 
refined in the Analytic Group, Briefs have two sections: the 
first page and the body, consisting of all succeeding pages. 
(No cover memorandum is necessary; disseminate with a buck slip.) 
The first page is styled on NIC letterhead with NIC 
number and date. The words EXECUTIVE BRIEF (underlined) 
centered and THE TITLE are capitalized, in bold face, and 
centered. They are followed,by four or five short 
bullets-(each of four lines or less) summarizing the key 
findings. A note at the bottom of the page indicates: 
-- Which NIO produced the Brief, 
-- How the findings were generated, 
-- With whom and how the Brief was coordinated, 
-- Who the drafter was. 
The body is printed in two-column pages with headings and 
key points in bold face. The key points are further 
highlighted through isolation from the main text. THE 
TITLE is repeated at the beginning of the body. Bullet 
(but not sub-bullet) paragraphs may be used. 
Currently, most Briefs are produced using Microsoft Word 
(version 4.0 or 5.0) and printed, via the VM system, on a Xerox 
2700 printer, using its Kosmos fonts. Similar though not 
identical versions can be produced for printing on the new 
Hewlet Packard laser printers or NIO/SP's IBM laser printer. 
COORDINATION1 
Coordination may be achieved at a Community meeting or by 
telephone. The key point is that participating analysts must be 
satisfied that their viewpoints are fully represented. If 
consensus cannot be achieved, express dissent clearly in the 
text. Avoid footnotes. They are more suitable in Estimates 
than in Briefs. When a draft is substantially altered during 
the coordination process, participating analysts should be given

Ultimately, the degree of formal coordination required is 
subject to the collective judgment of the NIO and his colleagues

APPROVAL: 
Chairman or Vice Chairman must approve the final product 
before distribution. 
DISTRIBUTION: 
Each NIO office should develop a distribution list tailored 
to the Executive Brief: Standard distribution lists for - 
Estimates in most Cases are too broad for this purpose. To keep 
the package small, distribution lists Should not be attached to 
the Briefs.; they are -(with some exceOtions)for NIC office use 
only. Our target audience for Briefs:generally ranges from the
DireCtorthrough.the'Under-Secretary level, including 
'comparable officials in the services and the National Security 
Council.

EXECUTIVE BRIEF 
NIC 00680/89 
16 June 1989 
ETHIOPIA'S PRESIDENT MENGISTU: THE MORNING AFTER 
o For the?moment, having cowed his opponents and purged the officer 
corps, Mengistu is secure in power following last month's coup attempt. 
o But his military, has been seriously weakened, and setbacks at the hands of 
northern rebels coupled with economic woes and popular discontent may 
well prove his undoing in the longer run. 
o The Eritrean rebels are unlikely to relieve the pressure on him by accepting 
his offer to talk; even if they do, peace prospects are dim. 
o The Soviets will continue to provide military aid while urging him to 
negotiate a settlement in Eritrea and improve relations with the West, 
? especially the US, whose participation Moscow seeks in a peace effort. 
o Mengistu will make a show of complying without, however, compromising 
his ambitions for military victory in the north. 
This Executive Brief was produced by the National Intelligence Officer for Africa. It 
reflects the judgments of Intelligence Community analysts presented at a meetinij 
9 June 1989.

SECRET 
ETHIOPIA'S PRESIDENT MENGISTU: THE MORNING AFTER 
Mengistu's Survivability  
For the time being, Mengistu seems 
stronger politically than before last 
month's aborted putsch by senior 
military officers. His East German 
trained security forces and the 
Presidential Guard proved their 
effectiveness -- the coup leaders 
are all dead, under detention, or in 
hiding -- and he quickly made 
wholesale changes in the officer 
corps, replacing professionals with 
loyalists. 
Nonetheless, Mengistu's respite will 
be short. The problems that plague 
Ethiopia are worsening rapidly: 
-- Militarily, the regime is now 
much more vulnerable to 
initiatives by the rebels in 
Eritrea and Tigre. Atop the 
turmoil and demoralization 
within the armed forces caused 
by the coup attempt, Mengistu 
has imposed new senior officers 
who are politically reliable but 
have little or no qualification for 
conducting military operations. 
Economically, immediate 
pressures stem from an acute 
shortage of foreign exchange. 
More fundamentally, the 
economy has been drained by 
Mengistu's war effort and 
contorted by his statist policies. 
Exports, productivity, and per 
capita income are declining, and 
the regime can squeeze few 
more resources from the 
population. 
-- Psychologically, war-weariness 
combined with fear has left the 
general populace even more 
cynical than before. When it 
appeared the coup might 
succeed, many Ethiopians 
welcomed it. Since then, in 
contrast to customary passivity 
in most segments of the 
population, student demon-
strators have openly defied and 
ridiculed Mengistu. 
Any would-be challenger will no doubt 
draw lessons from the aborted coup: to 
succeed in overthrowing him, Mengistu 
would have to be killed, his security 
forces neutralized, and Ethiopian 
nationalism taken squarely into account. 
2 
I- r%rT 
Last month's plotters mistakenly 
assumed that, once they struck an 
arrangement with the Eritrean 
rebels, they would receive wider 
support within the military. But 
most military officers are as 
nationalistic as Mengistu and would 
be reluctant to make fundamental 
concessions to the rebels. 
Prospects for War and Peace  
The Ethiopian military establishment 
is in disarray. Up to 500 officers 
are in detention, some have been 
executed, and defections among 
those not under arrest will likely 
increase. The air force is resentful, 
justifiably mistrusted by Mengistu, 
and largely out of action. While we 
expect Mengistu to refrain from 
large scale retribution, the damage 
to morale from political interference 
may further devastate military 
capabilities.

SECRET 
The countrywide campaign to 
dragoon teenagers into service 
persists despite past debacles from 
ill-trained recruits who cut and ran. 
Last month's attempt against 
Mengistu was motivated in part by 
disgust with this practice. 
Seasona: rains have begun, further 
favoring the guerillas. We expect 
the two main groups -- the 
Eritrean People's Liberation Front 
(EPLF) and the smaller Tigrean 
People's Liberation Front (TPLF)--
to resume the coordinated 
operations that have had telling 
effect in recent months. They will 
probe for weaknesses rather than 
launch frontal attacks that might 
coalesce government forces. Lines 
of communication linking Eritrea to 
the south are likely targets. 
EPLF leaders no doubt calculate 
that time is on their side and that 
they have no interest in lifting 
pressures on Mengistu by accepting 
his recent "unconditional" offer to 
negotiate a settlement. 
Even should talks get underway, they 
would have little chance of success 
because neither side is willing t?
compromise on the ultimate status of 
Eritrea -- the EPLF wants independence, 
while Mengistu will offer only limited 
autonomy at best. 
The EPLF might consider a formula 
for loose confederation, but 
probably not while Mengistu is still 
in charge. For his part, the 
seriousness with which Mengistu 
made his recent offer is not yet 
clear. Tactical imperatives favored 
pleasing foreign audiences --
particularly the Soviets -- and 
buying time. An indicator of 
deeper motivation would be 
abandonment of the regime's 
"lowlands" initiative, a year-long 
effort to divide Eritreans under the 
guise of selective "autonomy." The 
TPLF has sought to upstage 
Mengistu by agreeing to talk, but he 
is unlikely to accept its 
preconditions. 
Moscow's Burdensome Client  
To Mengistu's displeasure, the 
Soviets stood on the sidelines 
during the coup attempt. They 
seem to have been prepared to let 
him fall and deal with a successor. 
But they are unlikely to deliberately 
undermine him. We expect 
Moscow to honor the current 
military assistance agreement until 
it expires in 1991, after which arms 
aid will be pared down as part of 
the worldwide Soviet cost-cutting 
effort. On the other hand, the 
2,000 or so Cuban troops in 
Ethiopia may well begin departing 
much sooner, perhaps in the 
coming months -- their basic 
mission, deterring Somali 
aggression, being no longer 
relevant. 
The Soviets are in a quandry in 
dealing with Mengistu. On one 
hand, they have lost patience with 
his quest for a military solution to 
the Eritrean rebellion and his 
mismanagement of the economy. 
On the other, they seem unwilling 
to exercise leverage over him by 
constricting the flow of vital military 
aid. They will carefully watch his 
pursuit of the latest offer to 
negotiate. Anxious to reduce 
burdens without the appearance of 
abandoning their client, they will 
also seek opportunities to enlist US 
participation .in "cooperative" or 
"parallel" efforts to find a 
settlement.

SECRET 
Relations with the US  
Mengistu wants .to improve relations 
with the US despite suspicions --
fanned by Soviet disinformation --
that Washington had a hand in last 
month's events. Western economic 
assistance is essential for salvaging 
his economy, and he fears 
sanctions proposed in Congress 
that would pinch Ethiopian coffee 
exports -- the main foreign 
exchange earner. He also 
(mistakenly) believes that the US 
enjoys influence over the Eritreans 
and their Arab backers. To woo 
Washington and general Western 
goodwill, he will avoid provocative 
steps such as the "red terror" of 
1977, the vengeful response to an 
earlier challenge to his rule. 
But Mengistu will stubbornly resist 
compromising on matters of most 
importance to the West. The far-
reaching reforms necessary for 
reversing Ethiopia's downward 
economic slide would undermine 
his political control mechanisms 
and violate his collectivist vision. 
Moreover, the immediate -pressure 
to negotiate a northern settlement 
has been alleviated now that he has 
announced his offer. He can turn 
his attention to preparing for rebel 
initiatives on the battlefield, 
rebuilding the military, and pursuing 
-- illusory -- victory.

National Intelligence Council NIC 00826/89 
1 August 1989 
'EXECUTIVE BRIEF 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNREST IN THE USSR 
o Some Intelligence Community analysts believe that the ethnic and labor 
unrest in the Soviet Union could escalate beyond the regime's control 
over the next six months. Most judge, however, that the regime probably 
will be able to cope with the unrest, at least over the short term. 
o Clearly, the party faces a crisis. It is deeply divided over what to do, with 
Gorbachev arguing that it must identify .with societal pressures for change 
while his critics call for retrenchment. 
o Gorbachev is still in a strong political position. Most analysts believe he 
intends to use the unrest to force a showdown in the party. That could 
lead to a further radicalization of political reform and the ouster of one or 
more leading conservatives from the Politburo. 
o Whether Gorbachev can reform the party -- so that it continues to play a 
leading role while relinquishing a significant amount of decisionmaking 
authority -- is uncertain. Even if he further strengthens his grip on the 
? party, no lasting solutions to the society's grievances are yet in sight: 
-- The concessions to the miners probably will embolden other workers 
to make similar demands, heightening inflation and perhaps even 
threatening regime control. 
-- The Soviet standard of living will worsen before it improves. 
-- The ethnic violence may be containable, but continuing turmoil is 
certain regardless of the policies the regime decides to pursue. 
This Executive Brief reflects the view of the Intelligence Community expressed at a 
special warning meeting held on 25 July 1989. It was drafted by the National Intelligence 
Officer for the USSR and informally coordinated within the Community.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNREST IN THE USSR 
The Soviet system is facing its 
severest challenge since Stalin's 
death. The recent escalation of 
interethnic violence and the most 
serious labor unrest in Soviet 
history reflect both the Soviet 
population's increasing frustration 
over the meager results perestroyka 
has produced thus far and its 
decreasing fear of voicing its 
complaints. 
A System in Crisis  
Intelligence Community analysts see 
the current situation as highly fluid 
with major uncertainties that make 
predictions about events and the 
ability of the regime to cope very 
tentative. Some analysts believe 
the current unrest has the potential 
to escalate beyond the regime's 
control over the next six months. 
They argue that Gorbachev has 
unleashed the whirlwind and that 
his knack for driving the society's 
agenda is beginning to fail him. 
Most analysts, however, see the 
regime as able to cope with--but 
not resolve--what Gorbachev 
himself has labeled a "crisis." 
o As long as ethnic violence is not 
directed against Russians, the 
regime can probably contain the 
brushfires. The MVD troops, 
while stretched thin, have 
? improved in controling riots. 
o The leadership showed skill and 
nerve in ending the coal strikes, 
even though its concessions 
could spark further walkouts and 
eventually strain an already 
strapped state budget. 
Seizing the Moment 
Some analysts, while acknowledging 
Gorbachev's political strength, think 
? he will have to retrench in order to 
stem the decline in the party's 
status and remind the Soviet 
people that there are limits to 
challenging authority. Most 
analysts, however, believe that he 
will do just the opposite: 
o His emphatic declaration at the 
Central Committee meeting held 
on 18 July that those in the 
party who believe that it is still 
possible to resolve the USSR's 
and the party's problems using 
the old "authoritarian methods" 
are "making the greatest and 
deepest error" indicates that he 
sees the current crisis as reason 
to push ahead all the more 
quickly with political reforms. 
o His praise of the strikers and 
willingness to allow local and 
regional state elections this fall 
rather than next spring indicate 
he is trying to identify the party 
with forces in society pushing 
for reform and use them against 
conservatives in the party. 
Indeed, most Community analysts 
? anticipate that Gorbachev intends 
to exploit this crisis to force a 
showdown in the party leadership 
during the next six months. This 
was suggested in his call at the 
Central Committee meeting for new 
blood in the party at every level, 
including the Politburo. The 
Outcome of such a showdown is by 
no means certain, but the odds 
favor Gorbachev.

SECRET 
He may have to settle for ousting 
some of the lesser lights among 
the conservatives, but Gorbachev's 
main targets will be orthodox 
leaders like Ligachev and Chebrikov 
and the old nomenklatura they 
represent. While they have not 
coalesced into a united opposition, 
they all believe, to varying degrees, 
that Gorbachev is going too far, too 
fast for the party's good. 
Daunting Tasks  
Even if Gorbachev succeeds in 
strengthening his control over the 
Politburo, the task of rejuvenating 
the party is daunting. He is forcing 
the party to get out of the day-to-
day administration of the -govern-
ment and the economy, though the 
new management system is not yet 
in place. The party apparat is 
becoming increasingly demoralized, 
and there is confusion in the party 
ranks along with resentment that 
,the new Supreme Soviet has gained 
authority by filling the vacuum 
created by the party's disarray. 
The reforms are undermining the 
party's traditional raison d'etre. 
Gorbachev is making a bold wager 
that, while he is trying to make the 
Soviet system modern and efficient 
by spurring Soviet citizens to 
innovation and productivity, the 
party will be able to maintain its 
leading role and the nation its 
cohesiveness. He is weathering the 
unrest his own policies have helped 
spawn but largely by deferring the 
resolution of many problems. 
The concessions to the coal miners 
are likely to embolden other 
workers to strike for similar 
concessions, even if not on such a 
large scale. The impact of the 
economic concessions on the 
Soviet economy is not yet clear, 
but they probably will add to 
inflation -- though they may prove 
beneficial in the long run if they 
prompt local authorities and 
workers to show greater economic 
accountability and initiative, thus 
accelerating aspects of Gorbachev's 
economic reform program. 
Even before the current round of unrest, 
the leadership had put off many hard 
decisions on economic reform. 
?The long-promised plenum on 
nationalities was delayed once 
again until September at the 
earliest. Judging by his 1 July 
address to the nation on the 
question, Gorbachev will not brook 
the use of violence to press nation-
alist demands but is prepared to 
grant ethnic groups wide latitude in 
legal steps toward autonomy. 
He has no blueprint, however, for a 
solution to the nationality problems. 
Moreover, he must cope with 
growing resistance from Russians. 
Even though they have yet to 
become targets of interethnic 
violence, many Russians living in 
non-Russian republics are beginning 
to complain louder about discrimi-
nation. This could create a new 
and more volatile dimension to the 
ethnic problem. 
Thus, his course remains a high 
wire act. There are no easy 
solutions to any of these problems. 
Gorbachev will do well just to 
prevent them from bringing him 
and perestroyka down. He has 
displayed impressive political skills 
up until now, but the force with 
which the Soviet system's weak-
nesses and contradictions have 
been boiling over, indicates that 
even these skills will not by 
themselves be enough to provide 
lasting remedies.

EXECUTIVE BRIEF  
HAS CHINA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK CHANGED? 
Economic disruptions resulting directly from the student protests have 
largely dissipated. 
,o Nevertheless, the effects of the crisis are likely to exacerbate severe 
economic problems that predated the turbulence. 
?o Over the longer term, the continuing political uncertainty will hurt both the 
domestic economy, the main source of economic growth, and foreign 
investment, a key source of modernization despite its small share of 
China's gross national product. 
o Economic reforms instituted before the crisis will continue to pay 
dividends, but prospects for further reforms -- hence for enhanced 
economic growth -- are dim. 
This Executive Brief was produced by the Acting National Intelligence Officer for 
Economics, based on a meeting in July 1989 with China specialists in the Intelligence 
Community. It was informally coordinated in the Intelligence Community.

SECRET 25X1 
HAS CHINA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK CHANGED? 
Although the immediate economic 
disruptions resulting from the 
student-led protests have largely 
dissipated, China's long-term 
economic outlook has substantially 
worsened as a result of continuing 
political turmoil and economic? 
problems that arose well before the 
disturbances. We judge that 
continuing socal instability and 
political uncertainty over the next 
five years will cause China's 
economic growth rate to decline 
from a previous expectation of 7 to 
8 percent to about 5 or 6 percent.' 
Short-term dislocations fading  
The government is trying hard to 
project an image of business as 
usual. There have been some 
positive developments, in fact. The 
transportation and banking systems 
are back to normal after the 
disruptions of late May and early 
June. Most foreign firms with 
operations in China are resuming 
them; those that do not return are 
likely to be replaced by others. 
The Bank of China, which had 
ample reserves before the crisis, 
remains liquid though it is 
tightening access to foreign 
exchange; reserves probably 
dropped from $18.2 billion in April 
to $14-15 billion at the end of July. 
Western economic sanctions have 
not had a significant effect on 
China's foreign exchange picture, 
although they have delayed a 
number of communications, trans-
portation, and energy projects. 
1. A 2-percentage-point lower growth 
rate over 10 years would result in 21 
percent less GNP in the 10th year. 
The flow of new aid has stalled, but 
ongoing projects are unlikely to be 
cut off. 
The tourist industry, however, 
remains seriously hurt, with hotel 
bookings initially down by as much 
as 90 percent. During the year 
following the upheaval, tourism is 
unlikely to bring in much more than 
half of the $2.2 billion in foreign 
exchange it earned in 1988; 
But economic troubles will persist  
Some of the toughest conomic 
problems facing China in the short 
term are inflation, agricultural 
production shortfalls, unemploy-
ment, and a growing budget deficit, 
all of which predate the Tiananmen 
riots. Some of these problems may 
be exacerbated by the aftereffects 
of the political crisis: 
? o A simmering malaise among 
? workers may lead to slowdowns 
or other job actions. 
Inflation-induced subsidies to 
workers and enterprises will 
grow, adding to the budget 
crunch. 
o Unwillingness to accept local 
government IOUs for their crops 
may prompt peasants to refuse 
to sell produce to the state --
or stimulate violence if they are 
forced to sell to the state. 
o Retrenchment policies aimed at 
cutting back the unrestrained 
growth of rural industries may 
increase unemployment.

Long-term growth threatened  
The prospect of political instability 
will slow China's economic growth 
for at least the next few years --
particularly while the succession to 
Deng Xiaoping remains in question. 
During an extended period of 
political turmoil, the influence of 
reformers would decline, hindering 
China's adoption of more market 
reforms and even its ability to 
address basic economic Problems 
such as inflation. While nominally 
committed to continued openness' 
and economic reform, the hard-
liners in ascendancy are unlikely to 
enact the fundamental reforms --
particularly the installation of a fully 
functional market-based price 
system -- necessary even to 
sustain, much less advance, China's 
_economic progress. 
Uncertain policy direction at the top 
is putting pressure on politically 
vulnerable reformers at lower levels. 
Successful entrepreneurs, efficient 
managers, and independent rural 
industrialists who have offended 
local party cadre face possible 
attack in an increasingly intimi-
dating climate . Many Chinese 
students now abroad may never 
return, depriving China of their 
urgently needed technical and 
managerial skills. Worst of all for 
China's economy, if strong oppo-
nents of reform continue to gain 
influence, even some of the re-
forms that have taken hold may be 
rolled back for ideological reasons. 
The political situation is already 
impeding the growth of China's 
domestic market, which has been 
the engine of its recent economic 
expansion. Continued reform is the 
crucial element in maintaining that 
progress. However, the critical 
agricultural sector, once the 
showcase for China's economic 
reforms, has suffered during the 
past four years as leaders have 
focused their attention on urban 
problems. Grain production is not 
likely to increase very much over 
the long term without a substantial 
increase in the price farmers are 
paid for their grain. With price 
reform on hold, moreover, short-
ages of energy and industrial raw 
materials will persist, and Beijing 
will be unable to increase enterprise 
efficiency by enforcing the 
bankruptcy law adopted last year. 
The recent announcement that China's 
14.5 million private businesses would be 
inspected for tax evasion raised concerns 
that the government is again becoming 
hostile toward private enterprise. 
The political uncertainty is also 
impinging on the foreign sector. 
Foreign investment, though a small 
portion of total investment, is 
China's main channel to technical 
progress and increased foreign 
trade. For example, foreign firms 
provide valuable high-level 
technical and business training to 
Chinese managers. Though current 
investors reportedly believe they 
must remain in China to protect 
their investments, potential 
investors have a choice. Relevant 
to their decision about whether to 
put money into business operations 
in China are such considerations as 
the stability of the regime and the 
business climate and the prospects 
for more economic reform, all of 
which are now in greater doubt 
than before the student 
demonstrations.

Some favorable aspects  
China's economic picture is not 
altogether bleak: 
o The reforms instituted during 
the past decade are still helping 
the economy. 
China's government managed to 
overcome the recent disruptions 
with its authority intact. 
o Foreign investors do not fear 
nationalization. 
o China's prospective 5-percent 
annual growth rate, though 
diminished, is still faster than 
that of most other nations and 
therefore still offers tempting 
opportunities to the foreign 
investors permitted access to 
the country's domestic market. 
Nevertheless, China may have fallen 
from the ranks of the prospective 
"economic miracles" -- if indeed it 
ever belonged there.
