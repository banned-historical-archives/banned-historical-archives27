 China's Independent Foreign Policy in Perspective
 Summary
 China's formal  articulation of an "independent
 foreign policy" in September 1982 marked a
 significant tactical shift rather than a basic
 change in China's strategic posture--which remains
 anti-Soviet.   It was intended to remind Washington
 that China's anti-Sovietism could not be taken for
 granted (and hence to increase Chinese leverage with
 the United States); to improve China's influence in
 key areas of the Third World; to ease tensions with
 Moscow; and to enhance Chinese leaders' nationalist
 credentials at home.   We believe the Chinese
 concluded by last spring they may have
 miscalculated.   Thus, although they continue to
 stress their independent line, they also have sought
 better relations with the United States--we believe
 for basic strategic reasons.   Premier Zhao,  in fact,
 openly acknowledged when he was here in January that
 China does not stand "equidistant" between
 Washington and Moscow.
 Chinese leaders have not changed their basic perception of
 Soviet strategy.   They continue to assert that the Soviet Union
 is pursuing a long-term strategy to outflank Europe in the West
 and encircle China and Japan in the East.   As an influential
 Chinese foreign policy adviser told US

 "When we don't talk about the Soviet threat,  it does not mean
 that our views have changed."                                         25X1
 We believe China also still regards at least a tacit
 strategic relationship with the United States as an essential
 component of its foreign policy.   Premier Zhao Ziyang, for
 instance, recently told a visiting US delegation that good
 relations with the United States have an "extremely important
 strategic significance.   China continues to view the United
 States as the only viable counterweight to the long-term Soviet
 threat globally and as a strategic deterrent to Soviet aggression
 on its borders.  In strategic terms, China relies upon the US-
 NATO alliance in Europe                   oint, supports US-Japanese
 cooperation in Asia.                                                   25X1
 What accounts, therefore, for the Chinese decision in late
 1982 to distance themselves publicly from the United States and
 to open talks with Moscow?  Some strands of their current policy
 clearly predate the public enunciation of the "independent
 foreign policy."  By the late 1970s, for example, some senior
 Chinese leaders were arguing that China should strike a more
 independent posture in order to compete more effectively with the
 Soviets for influence in the Third World and the socialist
 movement.   Close association with the United States, they argued,
 only alienated potential opponents of the Soviet Union in key
 strategic areas such as the Middle East and southern Africa,
 where they believed the United States relies too heavily on
 unpopular surrogates ("unsinkable aircraft carriers")  such as
 Israel and South Africa to thwart Soviet advances.   China,  in
 fact, began its efforts to expand contacts with the Eurocommunist
 parties, especially those in France,  Italy and Spain, as well as
 with the Communist parties of Eastern Europe well before it       25X1
 adopted its current independent line.
 Similiarly, China undoubtedly would have reopened talks with
 the Soviet Union at some point as part of its policy to reduce
 tensions.   Some Chinese leaders advocated such an approach as
 early as 1979,1                                       ~ and Beijing    25X1
 held one round ot discussions wit    oscow in  ate 1979 before
 breaking off the talks as a result of the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan.                                                           25X1
 The shift in 1982, however, probably was triggered by a
 combination of factors.   By then, Chinese leaders were
 complaining that the United States increasingly acted
 uniilaterally and that it was insensitive to the concerns of its
 friends and even close allies.   They, of course, were
 particularly upset with US policy toward Taiwan and may have seen
 that policy as symptomatic of the lower priority they believed
 Washington accorded good relations with Beijing.   In late 1981,
 Ji Pengfei--one of the formulators of the independent policy  .
 line--declared that it was possible for the United States and
 China to pursue parallel strategic interests and, at the same
 time, imperative that China continue its "principled struggle"

 with the United States over Taiwan,
 Ji and some other Chinese leaders,.in fact,
 implied that adopting a more independent stance--with the implied
 threat of moving toward Moscow--could give China greater lever
 with Washington on a range of issues,  including Taiwan.
 We believe the Chinese decision to move in this direction
 was bolstered by their assessment that the overall global balance
 of power was shifting back in favor of the West--hence, giving
 China greater room for diplomatic manuever.   The Soviets,  they
 concluded, had become bogged down in Afghanistan, Poland, and
 Indochina and posed a less immediate threat to China's
 security.   In our judgment, Beijing saw an opportunity not only
 to increase its leverage with the United States by opening talks
 with the Soviets, but also to enhance China's independent image
 in the Third World.   Chinese leaders also sought to reduce
 tensions with Moscow in part so that they could concentrate on
 their ambitious modernization program.
 Finally, we believe China's leaders have used this policy to
 help strengthen their domestic position.   Through it, Deng
 Xiaoping and his allies have continued the process of dismantling
 the Maoist ideological edifice without sacrificing the regime's
 strategic goals.   They have set aside the Maoist notion of the
 inevitability of war, for instance, and have reemphasized the
 nationalist basis of their foreign policy.   At the same time, the
 establishment of the policy has enabled Chinese leaders to
 continue to proclaim C         "self-reliance" while defending its.
 opening to the West.

 The Foreign-Policy Positions. of China's Senior Leaders
 Each of the Chinese leaders with whom the President will
 hold talks next month--Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and
 Li Xiannian--plays a key role in China's foreign policy.   Deng
 Xiaoping, at 79,  is the leading strategic thinker and main
 architect of China's current foreign policy.   Deng is the primary
 exponent of a strong relationship with the United States on
 strategic grounds and the leading antagonist of the Soviet
 Union.   Deng's chosen successors--General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 and Premier Zhao Ziyang--endorse his views but are more closely
 identified with China's policies toward Eastern Europe, Asia, and
 the Third World.   Li Xiannian, Deng's peer on the Politburo's
 Standing Committee, takes a more cautious approach to relations
 We believe that the Chinese will try to set a positive tone
 both in public and private in order to ensure that the visit is a
 success.  A principal. Chinese aim is to establish good relations
 with the President--reflecting a consensus that relations with
 the United States must be improved for strategic reasons.   In
 keeping with past practice, we expect that the Chinese will
 manipulate the atmosphere of the visit and that each leader will

 follow a prescribed role in discussions with the President.   Deng
 in particular will concentrate on the strategic dimension of US-
 China relations and on sensitive bilateral problems, especially
 Although Li Xiannian, 79, holds a.largely ceremonial
 position as State President, he is still very influential on
 foreign policy issues.   He is a senior a.member of the
 Politburo's Standing Committee and the party's Foreign Affairs
 Group as well.   Like Deng, Li  has had broad experience in foreign
 affairs.   He has been involved in the US-China reconciliation
 since its inception in the early 1970s when he stood behind
 Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai's opening to the
 United States against formidable opposition.   Unlike Deng, who
 was still  in political disgrace  Li '           rti  ipant in the 1972
 meetings with President Nixon.
 In recent years, Li has reaffirmed that Chinese strategic
 cooperation with the United States is both imperative and long-
 term.   Li told a former senior US official  in August 1981, for
 example, that good relations with the United States were
 "essential to preserve and enhance global stability" and praised
 the administration's efforts in areas of Chinese concern,
 especially aid to Pakistan.   At the same time, however, Li has
 taken a harsh, rigid line on US arms sales to Taiwan.   In April
 1981, Li was among the first leader to label US policy toward
 Taiwan as "hegemonist" and ,later declared that China "cannot make
 any concessions" on arms sales.
 Li may favor the adoption of a more balanced approach to
 Sino-Soviet-US relations but, we believe, he does not advocate
 significantly improving relations with the Soviets.   He has been
 willing, however, to use the threat of improved relations with
 the Soviets to try to extract greater concessions from the United
 States.   He told the Romanians in 1979, for instance,  that China
 would watch the results of Vice President Mondale's visit to
 China in August to help determine the positions it would take
 when negotiating with the Russians.  Similarly, in January 1982,
 as 'tension with the United States over arms sales to Taiwan rose,
 he'told the Italian Communist paper "L'Unita" that China would
 indeed be willing to talk to the Soviets.
 Li, who is currently in poor health and quite frail, will
 probably touch only briefly on matters of substance.
 Nonetheless, it is possible that he will include a frank
 statement on arms sales to Taiwan in his opening remarks.

 Zhao Ziyang
 As Premier and a member of the Politburo Standing Committee,
 Zhao Zivana plays a
 major role in China's foreign policy.
 he is the head of a high-
 level party Foreign Affairs Group that debates and makes
 decisions on sensitive foreign policy initiatives.   But Zhao's
 chief concern is the management of China's modernization
 program.   In foreign affairs, he tends to concentrate on
 bilateral  issues and on international economic policy.
 Zhao's strategic views, to the extent that he has expressed
 them, appear to be in line with those of Deng.   Zhao has been
 most closely involved with the implementation of policy toward
 Asia and the Third World.   In 1981, for instance, Zhao traveled
 throughout ASEAN and led efforts to build support for China's
 Kampuchean policy.   Last year. Zhao took a largely symbolic trip
 to 11 African states.
 Zhao appears increasingly to be charged with management of
 US-China relations, however, and has a special stake in
 furthering trade and technology transfer.   He is personally
 involved, for instance,  in a US corporation's effort to establish
 a joint coal mining venture in Shanxi Province.   Recently, he has
 lobbied US businessm      d officials to increase investment in
 Chinese industries.
 In his meetings with the President, we expect Zhao to
 reiterate the same themes he did in January.   He has repeatedly
 expressed his interest in making the official trip a successful
 one and, as the President's host, he will want to set the tone
 for the entire visit.   We believe that Zhao will focus on
 bilateral economic matters and continue to press for US
 concessions on a variety of issues,  including:   greater access to
 US technology; easing of COCOM restrictions; concessional US
 funding for joint ventures; Presidential assistance in amending
 the Foreign Assistance Act; US support for China's position on
 the Asian Development Bank; and US assurances that it will
 continue to follow a one-China policy.
 Hu Yaobang
 As Deng Xiaoping's chosen successor, Hu Yaobang is probably
 the most important leader the President will meet with the
 exception of Deng himself.   In his capacity as head of the
 party's Secretariat and a member of the Politburo's Standing
 Committee, Hu Yaohanq plays an important

 Unlike Deng Xiaoping, Hu does not have long experience in
 foreign affairs--although he has gradually begun to extend his
 grasp.   He has been primaril  .'concerned with intern 1     ty and,
 ideological matters.                                                Hu     25X1
 began to assume a leading role in articulating China's foreign
 policy in the spring of 1981, when he delivered a major address
 onChina's relations with the US and the Soviet Union.  In
 September 1982, he formally enunciated China's "independent
 foreign policy" line, in a speech to the 12th Party Congress.  He
 has promoted China's ties with the East European Communist
 parties--travelling to Romania and Yugoslavia in May 1983--and
 has indicated his interest in improving relations between. China
 and other Eastern Europen countries.  Hu has also begun to play a        0
 key role in China's relations with North Korea and Japan..  In
 June 1983 Hu escorted Kim Chong-il during a visit to China,
 giving implicit Chinese backing to him as Kim Il-sung's
 successor.  Hu also visited Japan last November--his f'      rip.
 abroad to a modern industrial power.                                25X1
 Hu does not appear to,have clearly articulated views on .the
 Soviet Union.   He did not become directly involved in the Sino
 Soviet rivalry and probably does not share the bitterness of"Deng
 Xiaoping and the old guard toward the Soviets.  Although Hu has
 been sharply critical of Soviet behavior toward China on
 occasion, he appears to have favored the establishment of a=more
 balanced relationship with the USSR   I       late 1970s,           25X1
 Hu, was among the
 ideological obstacles in the way of normalizing relations-wi:th ,
 the. Soviets.   In addition, Hu recently praised the Soviet-Union -.
 Although. Hu has: publicly supported current efforts to
 improve relations with the United States, he'is not as closely
 identified with this policy as Deng.   Hu appears to be suspicious

 Hu is not the cold, calculating strategic thinker that Deng
 is.   In conversations with foreign officials, he is often
 extremely animated and sometimes appears to exceed his brief.   He
 also has a fervor and an intensity that surpasses that of the
 other leaders with whom the President will meet.   Based on the
 record of his past conversations, we expect Hu to address briefly
 and pointedly China's concerns about US policy but to show
 greater interest in discussing bilateral economic cooperation and
 Chinese domestic matters.   In his meeting with former President
 Carter,  in August 1981, for example, Hu reviewed the direction of
 China's domestic policy and his own role in it.
 Deng Xiaoping
 As the first among equals on the Politburo's six-man
 Standing Committee, Deng establishes the agenda in China's
 foreign policy, makes the key decisions, and is the leadership's
 primary strategic thinker.   Deng has consistently supported the
 maintenance of a firm strategic relationship with the United
 States, and has sought' US assistance and technology for China's
 modernization program.   At the same time, he has been the most
 staunchly anti-Soviet member of China's current leaders.
 the late 1950s and early 1960s.   Deng has long shared Mao
 Zedong's view that the Soviet Union has been, attempting to
 Deng's deep distrust of the Soviets is rooted in his
 participation in the bitter Sino-Soviet ideological disputes of
 encircle and to dominate China.   In 1979-80,I                                 25X1
 Deng argued against improving relations           25X1
 with the  ovie s, and, we believe, agreed to enter into talks
 with Moscow in 1982 primarily on tactical qrounds.   More
 recently, in February, Deng told a US delegation that the Soviets
 will become "more rigid" in their  olic   toward China during the
 transition in Soviet leadership.                                               25X1
 Deng has advocated close strategic ties with the United
 States since 1974, when he began taking part in high-level
 discussions with US visitors, including Henry Kissinger and
 President Ford.  At the time of normalization, Deng proclaimed
 that US-China ties had a "long term strategic significance" and
 proposed the formation of a United Front against the Soviet
 Union.   Although Deng has acceded to the shift in China's foreign
 policy toward a more independent stance--and has associated,
 himself with the more nationalistic aspects of that policy--he
 haq indicated that his strategic views have remained constant.
 Deng ,has an important political stake in relations with the
 United States.   Deng personally orchestrated the normalization of
 relations and agreed to set aside the issue of US arms sales to
 Taiwan at that time.   More important, Deng's policy of opening to
 the West for aid in China's modernization rests on good relations

 with the United States.  Deng has stated his own disappointment    25X1
 that bilateral relations have not been more fruitful.   In
 addition, when relations with the United States soured
 critics were able to'use,the un u  i  ee25X1
 expectations of normalization and US actions toward Taiwan to
 question Deng's domestic and foreign policies.   Deng has    .
 reflected these pressures in the occasional bitterness of his
 criticism-of the United States.                                      25X1
 We believe that Deng's first objective in his talk with the
 President will be to establish good rapport.   Deng will seek to
 win the President's sympathy for China's point of.view, on.key
 issues,  such as Taiwan, and to stress the two countries' mutual
 interest in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula and
 cooperating on other complex problems.  Deng can be unusually
 blunt, intense and manipulative.  Although we do not believe that
 Deng will behave in this manner with the President,  the President
 should be prepared for some frank remarks  bout US policies e.g.,
 with..regards the Third World.                                        25X1
 On Taiwan, Deng, may formally ask the President to take steps
 to'rescind the Taiwan Relations,Act by the end of his-term--as
 Zhao Ziyang suggested in January.   At a minimum, Deng will ask
 the President to manage the TRA in a manner that least harms
 Chinese interests and to observe the provisions of the August
 Communique.   Deng may also press for fewer US restrict-ions on the
 transfer of sophisticated technologies and US circumvention of,
 COCOM restrictions.                                                    25X1
 Deng will want to probe the President's think-ing.on China's
 strategic importance to the United States and expect to be
 treated as an equal.   Deng and other Chinese leaders recently:
 reiterated to the CSIS delegation their sensitivity.to being...
 trea,ted.as a "junior partner", and.their unhappiness over b,eing,,
 relegated to the status of. a regional rather. than.global factor
 in,US strategic calculations.   They have noted with some concern
 that the United States has steadily strengthened its military
 ties with Japan and South Korea--ost                                 25X1
 Chinese concerns into consideration.
 We expect Deng to reiterate that .China sees the Soviet Union
 as,the nrimar.y threat to Chinese security and that China supports
 the US. military buildup against the Soviets.   De.ng, however,, is
 also likely. to argue that the United States has regained the
 initiative from the Soviets and should now pursue less aggressive
 policies to avoid alienating natural opponents of the Soviets.
 Deng told the US delegation in February,. for. example, that the US
 "policy of confrontation" with the Soviets in Europe allows the
 Soviets to exploit anti-war sentiment and to drive a wedge
 between the United States and NATO. -.Zhao Ziyang similiarly urged

 Finally, Deng probably will want to discuss Korea.   Deng has
 long been concerned with maintaining stability on the'Korean
 peninsula and excluding Soviet influence by preserving good
 relations with North Korea.   Deng has been actively involved in
 relations with the North--including his role as an go-between in
 seconding the North Korean proposal for a confederal solution--in
 part to balance these aims.   Deng may not present any new ideas
 but indicated to the CSIS delegation that he would like to
 explore with the President the notion of confederation as a'
 solution for Korea, and for Taiwan and Hong Kong as well.   As he
 said in February, "We must work out of some blind alleys that we
 are in."

 Deng-Zhao Talks with Brzezinski--An Assessment
 Although it is easy to overinterpret the sometimes delphic
 pronouncements of Chinese leaders, Deng and Zhao's remarks to
 Zbignew Brzezinski and other members of a Georgetown University
 delegation on 22 February strike us as revealing a good deal
 about current Chinese foreign policy concerns.
 The Chinese have often used visits by such unofficial US
 groups for tactical purposes--to air their concerns in strong
 terms, thus hoping to place subsequent official visitors on the
 defensive even before their arrival.   In this case, however, both
 Deng and Zhao appeared anxious initially to signal their
 satisfaction with Zhao's visit in January and President Reagan's
 April trip, and to highlight the strategic and economic
 importance China continues      ttach to close rel.ations with the
 United States.
 Both became defensive and critical of US policy only after
 some members of the delegation accused China of inconsistency in
 its policies.   In rebuttal, Deng and Zhao sought to cast
 themselves as friends offering advice, but they strongly
 criticized US foreign policy in general and toward China in
 particular over the past few years.   We believe this sharp
 reaction reflects underlying Chinese fears of being relegated to
 a less important strategic role in US calculations and a deep
 seated Chinese concern that China will be treated as less than an
 equal by the United States--just as Moscow dealt with Beijing

 Shifting Strategic Assessment
 The Chinese assessment of the strategic balance has changed
 significantly over the past few years.   During much of the 1970s
 China saw the US and its NATO allies on the defensive and Soviet
 power and influence expanding.   Hence, China favored a "united
 front". strategy to check Soviet expansion and viewed
 normalization of relations with                     es as a key
 ingredient of that strategy.
 But, since 1980 the Chinese believe the balance has begun to
 shift back in favor of the West.   The United States and its
 allies have greatly strengthened their military power and resolve
 in the face of the Soviet challenge, while the Soviets have
 become increasingly beset by domestic and foreign policy
 problems.  Deng indicated the Chinese see little chance of that
 25X1
 25X1
 From China's perspective this shift has had both positive
 and negative consequences, some of which Beijing clearly did not
 anticipate.  Over the short run, for example, it has lessened
 Chinese concern over the Soviet threat to their security.   It has
 also allowed them Ito drop their call for a united front, to
 distance themselves from the United States publicly, and to adopt
 a more flexible strategy toward the Third World designed to
 enhance Chinese influence and combat the Soviets.   The Chinese
 have been particularly critical of those US policies toward the
 Third World they regard as counterproductive and as playing into
 Soviet hands, such as US support for Israel.   China's resulting
 "independent" policy     also reflected its deep suspicion of US
 policy on Taiwan.                                                           25X1
 But as the United States has moved to rebuild its military
 strength and political resolve,  the Chinese fear it has:
 -- Stimulated US-Soviet competition in Asia that threatens
 to weaken China's position and thus make it even less of
 a factor in the strategic calculations of both
 superpowers.
 -- Raised in turn the prospect that China will have even
 less leverage with the United States over Taiwan as time
 Deng and Zhao's complaints and advice to the delegation
 should he seen as reflecting these concerns and therefore as
 self-serving.   Both, for example, emphasized that the United
 States should temper its military buildup and seek to ease
 tensions with the USSR by seeking an arms accord.   They also held
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/07: CIA-RDP04T00367R000201410001-5
 the'United States should avoid military actions in the Third
 World or close association with the so-called four unsinkable
 aircraft carriers--Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa and Israel.
 In our view, China would prefer to see a rough strategic
 parity maintained that gives China maximum maneuverability and
 leverage on both sides.   Increased superpower tensions and arms
 competition in particular will.only complicate China's ability to
 deal with resulting growth in Soviet military capabilities in
 Asia.   The Chinese are also concerned that the Soviets might
 still succeed in driving a wedge between the United States and
 its European allies by exploiting public concern in Europe over
 the deployment of more US missiles there.
 At the same time, China wants to develop closer economic,
 political and perhaps even- military ties with the United States,
 but to avoid tarnishing its reputation with the Third World and
 "progressive" parties in the developed countries, or with
 nationalists at home concerned with the issue of Taiwan.
 Deng also criticized US policy in East Asia, especially US
 support for allies and friends such as South Korea and Taiwan,
 asserting that this impedes the search for stability in the
 region.   Deng stressed his desire to get out of the "blind
 alleys" of the past which,  in the case of Korea, could result in
 what he called a "slide into war."   He referred to President
 Carter's troop withdrawal plan as a "good idea."   He offered his
 own.vaguely defined proposals stressing "confederation" as a
 means to stabilize the situations not only in Korea and Taiwan,
 but also Hong Kong, Macao, and the Nansha (Spratly)  Islands.   We
 believe Deng sees a stronger United States as less willing to
 compromise on issues such as Taiwan and Korea on terms
 advantageous to China or its North Korean ally.
 Finally, Deng and Zhao focused on alleged US unwillingness
 to modify US laws and procedures (e.g. Taiwan Relations Act,
 Export Administration procedures) to accommodate China.   This
 again reflects in part China's concern that. the United States no
 longer needs China as much as in the past as a strategic asset
 against the USSR, and therefore will be less likely to
 accommodate Chinese interests.   Zhao was especially outspoken in
 asserting that China "will never agree" to be a "second class
 partner" of the United States, but will resist just as it
 resisted Soviet efforts in the past to make China a "junior
 partner."

 Sino-Soviet Relations  F_
 We expect China and the Soviet Union to remain suspicious,
 wary antagonists, continuing to arm against each other and to
 manuever in an effort to restrict each other's power and
 influence in Asia.   The current series of Sino-Soviet talks are
 likely to contribute to a gradual- expansion of contacts,
 especially in economic areas,  and a reduction in tensions, but w
 foresee no major breakthrough on key security issues.
 Many factors divide the two sides:
 -- Moscow's refusal to halt its unrelenting buildup of
 military power in Asia or reduce its continued close ties
 with Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Mongolia.
 -- China's determination to counter a perceived long-term
 Soviet effort to intimidate and subjugate China with
 military power and political encirclement.
 -- Historical, territorial, racial  and ideological grievances
 felt deeply by           leaders in both Moscow and
 Beijing.                                                             25X1
 The impasse in relations continues to center on China's
 demand that Moscow remove the-so-called three obstacles to Sino-
 Soviet relations--the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, support
 for Vietnam in Kampuchea, and Soviet military deployments along
 the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia.   Evidence of a continuing
 deadlock on these questions includes:

 -- Chernenko's public refusal early this month to deal with
 China on issues affecting third countries.
 -- Soviet stationing--as of late last year--of TU-16 bombers
 in Vietnam.
 -- Sino-Vietnamese armed tension during the current dry
 season.
 -- Sino-Soviet propaganda exchanges over Vietnam and Mongolia
 in February and March.
 -- Continued steady buildup of other Soviet forces in Asia--
 especially SS-20s.                                                  25X1
 Nevertheless, for tactical reasons both sides will continue
 gradually to progress in secondary areas:
 -- Moscow seeks to normalize relations to drive a wedge
 between the United States and China.
 China seeks to reduce tensions,  increase its maneuvering
 room in the US-Soviet-Chinese triangle,  and project a more
 nonaligned image in the Third World.   However,  it still
 regards the Soviet Union as its principal  security problem
 and its strategic interests as largely compatible. with
 those of the United States.
 China's growing contacts with Moscow parallel  its emphasis
 on an "independent" foreign policy--an attempt to rely less  .
 explicitly in the United States as a strategic counterweight to
 Soviet power, and more on diplomacy to counter Soviet pressure.
 But, China clearly recognizes that it runs grave risks if it goes
 too far in easing tensions with the USSR.
 - It could alarm and alienate the United States and Western-
 oriented countries that provide an essential counterweight
 to Soviet pressure on China and are a vital source of
 economic and technical help for China's modernization.
 -- It could reduce Soviet incentive to compromise and confirm
 Moscow in its hardline Dolic-  of military pressure and
 Thus, progress in relations remains confined to secondary
 areas:
 -- Trade doubled in 1983 and is expected to increase 60
 percent in 1984 to a level of $1.2 billion--still far
 below Sino-US trade.

 -- Two separate forums for talks at the vice foreign minister
 level have been established--one to deal with "bilateral"
 issues and another to discuss "global"  issues.
 -- Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Arkhipov is slated to visit
 China in May--the higest level Soviet official to visit
 China in 15 years.   Arhkipov reportedly will discuss
 increased economic cooperation.   Meanwhile, the Chinese
 and Soviet foreign ministers have agreed in principle to
 meet, but no date or venue has been set.
 -- Low level cultural, sports and scientific exchanges have
 resumed.   Each side is to exchange 100 students this year,
 and the USSR has agreed to study refurbishing a few
 Soviet-supplied plants in China.
 -- Moscow has muted most anti-China polemics; Beijing
 continues to attack Soviet foreign policy but has stopped
 criticism of Soviet "revisionism."
 In the near future, Beijing will probably continue to use
 its carefully modulated interchanges with the USSR to contain
 Sino-Soviet tensions,  increase its leverage with the United
 States, and demonstrate Chinese "independence".   It is no  .
 accident that Beijing scheduled Arkhipov's visit in May on the
 heels of President Reagan's visit to China,  and plans tentatively
 to send defense Minister Zhana Aioing to the United States the
 following month.
 Moscow, while concerned about the possibility of Sino-US
 ties, especially in the military sphere, seems generally
 satisfied with the gradual  improvement in Sino-Soviet exchanges,
 and has little incentive to offer a far reaching initiative
 designed to meet China's demands on the three "obstacles."   The
 Soviets also would like some sort of an agreement and will
 probably continue to seek some common ground with China on
 bilateral , security issues, without accommodating China's
 There is a low possibility (5-10 percent chance) that events
 such as a sudden change in leadership in Moscow or Beijing, a
 sharp deterioration in US relations with either Moscow or
 Beijing, or the outbreak of war in Korea, could prompt China and
 the USSR to move toward greater accommodation than anticipated.
 But there is an at least equal possibility that Sino-Soviet
 relations could worsen over the next few years as a result of
 such events as Sino-Vietnamese conflict over Indochina, closer
 US-Chinese military ties, or Soviet efforts to expand in the
 fluid situation in Southwest Asia.

 We believe that the Chinese see little reason to change this
 cautious approach, primarily because the prospects for any Korean
 dialogue seem dim:
 -- Pyongyang remains intractable in its call for 3-way
 talks and on its basic goals, primarily withdrawal of
 US troops from the South.   We believe the North's
 tripartite talks proposal is only a tactical maneuver
 to engage the US in direct talks.
 -- Seoul has all but rejected the North Korean proposal,
 calling instead for direct talks with Pyongyang.   The
 South also wants at least.an implicit apology from
 the North for the Rangoon bombing.

 Beijing is further inhibited from pursuing a more activist
 approach by its interest in maintaining strong ties with
 Pyongyang.   We believe the Chinese want to avoid antagonizing the
 North Koreans, who for now clearly do.not want Chinese direct
 involvement in a dialogue.   Pyongyang instead wants to portray
 Seoul as a US dependency, to avoid displeasing Moscow by its
 exclusion, and to minimize Chinese contacts with the South
 Koreans.   China, moreover, does not want to be in a position
 where it would be expected to seek concessions from the North
 Koreans to keep the talks alive.  Finally, the Chinese would like
 fear could lead to improved Soviet-North Korean relations.
 We believe China for the near term will continue its policy
 of endorsing both the North's proposals and the need for
 "peaceful" reunification of Korea.   The lack of an explicit US
 rejection of tripartite talks probably reinforces. Beijing's
 inclination to adopt a wait-and-see approach.   China meanwhile
 can maintain its strong position in Pyongyang at a low cost to
 other Chinese interests, such as improved ties with the United
 States and Japan.
 At the same time, the Chinese remain interested in reducing
 tensions on the Korean Peninsula.   China wants to keep North
 Korea from turning to Moscow as a strategic counterweight to the
 US-South Korean alliance, and. to avoid a conflict in Korea that
 would pit Chinese forces against the US.   Beijing has announced
 that party leader Hu Yaobang will visit North Korea in early
 May.   We believe one of the key discussion topics during his
 visit probablv will be      status of North Korea's tripartite
 proposal.

 Sino-Soviet Trade and Economic Relations
 China's economic relations with the Soviet Union have
 expanded significantly over the past two years, principally as
 the result of the easing in political tension between the two
 states.   Trade has reached the highest level since the early
 1960s, and China has apparently concluded that the USSR can play
 a useful, supplemental role in China's modernization.  We
 believe, however, that the Soviet role in China's modernization
 will remain small,  in part because of Soviet inability to provide
 technology as advanced as that available in the West and Japan,
 and in part because of painful memories of the Soviet a   lication
 of economic sanctions against China in 1960.
 Sino-Soviet trade will increase 60 percent in 1984 to a
 projected value of $1.2 billion.   This follows a doubling of
 trade in 1983 and gives substance to a recent Chinese statement
 on the "great potential" for economic and technical cooperation
 with the USSR.   The markets  in the Soviet Far East for Chinese
 textiles and other consumer goods and in China for Soviet timber,
 fertilizer, and machinery provide ample room for further
 expanding total trade which is still only about 15 percent of
 Sino-US trade.   Recent Soviet and Chinese comments that total
 trade could reach $5 billion by 1990 suggest that Beijing may be
 willing to consider a long-term trade agreement with Moscow.
 China also reportedly has agreed to use Soviet assistance in
 the technical upgrading of several  industrial plants built by the
 PRC with Soviet help in the 1950s.   Because Beijing's leaders
 remember past Soviet efforts to exploit China's economic
 dependence for political purposes, we believe they will sharply
 limit the number and activities of Soviet technical experts used
 in China to help plant modernization.   The Chinese also will not

 China and Japan:          Building for the Long-Haul
 Prime Minister Nakasone's recent visit to Beijing
 underscores the convergence of Chinese and Japanese strategic and
 economic interests.   China looks to Japan both for help in
 promoting its modernization program and in countering Soviet
 expansionism and promoting regional  stability.-  Japan hopes that
 support for China's modernization will enhance prospects for the
 survival of a moderate leadership in Beijing, help to reinforce
 China's "opening to the West," and reduce incentives for a Sino-
 Soviet rapproachement.
 -- During Nakasone's trip, both sides reaffirmed their
 opposition to the increasing Soviet military buildup
 in Asia, particularly the deployment of more SS-
 20s.   The two sides agreed to share information on
 these Soviet missiles.
 -- Premier Zhao used the occasion to stress that the
 Soviet Union represents the primary threat to Chinese
 security.
 -- The Soviet media'have reacted sharply to the visit,
 accusing China and Japan of "distorting" Soviet Asian
 polices to "camouflage" US and Japanese military
 intentions.

 -- Nakasone and his hosts reiterated their common
 interests in peace on the Korean peninsula.   The two
 sides remained far apart, however, on the issue of a
 Korean dialogue, with China repeating its support for
 Pyongyang's tripartite proposal and.with Japan
 endorsing Seoul's call for direct North-South
 contacts.   Hu Yaobang, moreover,  stated that China
 would "never" change its stance of promoting "from
 the sidelines" Korean reunification and a reduction
 of tensions there.
 -- The Chinese agreed to allow separated Korean family
 members living in China and South Korea to meet in
 either those two countries or Japan.   Premier Zhao
 also suggested that China would favorably consider
 participation in the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988
 Olympics, both to be held in Seoul.
 -- The long-term commitment by both sides to strong
 bilateral ties was symbolized by the establishment of
 a committee to promote Sino-Japanese friendship into
 the 21st Century."                                          25X1
 Over the past several years, China and Japan have pursued
 parallel policies in Asia:
 In Southeast Asia, both China and Japan provide
 strong diplomatic support for ASEAN's efforts to
 bring about a Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea.
 Both sides provide assistance to Thailand, with China
 also supporting the Kampuchean rebels.
 -- In Southwest Asia, both sides have condemned the
 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,  and sought through
 diplomatic and economic means to bolster Pakistan.
 Beijing reportedly also provides arms and other aid
 to the Afghan rebels.
 -- In Northeast Asia, both states have sought to
 exercise.a moderating influence over their respective
 Complementary economic interests meanwhile have served to  25X1
 further strengthen Sino-Japanese relations.   China hopes to
 acquire increased Japanese imports, financial  credit,  and
 technology, as well as a larger Japanese market for Chinese
 goods.   Japan regards China as a potentially lucrative export
 market, and as a significant source of raw materials.

 The Japanese are considering about $3 billion in

 Tokyo also has agreed to a one-time export of nuclear

 demanding stricter controls before it will  sign a

 These mutual strategic and economic benefits serve to
 minimize several  latent problems in the relationship, such as
 Chinese concern over the long-term implications of growing US-

 as well as Japanese concern over China's ability to maintain it's

 lay the groundwork for even closer ties.

 China's Taiwan Policy
 Since last summer, Beijing has revived its reunification
 campaign.   Deng Xiaoping and others have issued authoritative
 statements designed to flesh out Ye Jianying's 1981 nine points
 proposal to Taiwan by:
 stressing both sides'  commitment to one China and the
 need for peaceful  reunification;
 calling for negotiations between the Chinese Communist
 Party and the Kuomintang as equals;
 proposing to make Taiwan into a special  administrative
 region with full control over its internal  affairs and
 continued access to international trading markets;
 suggesting that anything short of full  independence can
 be discussed;
 promising not to send Ch'inese troops or bureaucrats to
 Taiwan and holding the door open for Taiwan's officials
 to seek government positions on?the mainland;
 rejecting Taipei's position that reunification be based
 on its official  ideology of the "Three People's
 Principles"  (civil  liberties, Chinese nationalism, and
 equal economic opportunities);

 leaving unclear whether Taiwan will be allowed to
 purchase foreign arms after reunification;
 offering Taiwan a limited role in international
 organizations.   Since 1981, Taipei has rejoined numerous
 nongovernmental bodies through the "Olympic solution,"
 by adapting a different name--China, Taipei--and flag.
 China has recently suggested that a similar solution
 could be used to resolve the ADB impasse; Taiwan,
 however, has explicitly rejected this approach for
 governmental organizations.
 Such proposals are intended-to contrast Beijing's
 "flexibility" with Taiwan's "intransigence"  in order to:
 --      induce Washington, as well as Overseas Chinese and
 foreign businessmen, to encourage Taipei to enter
 negotiations;
 entice Taipei to be more flexible;
 --      demonstrate to Washington Chinese interest in improving
 Believing that US support for Taiwan--and particularly arms
 sales--reinforces Taipei's refusal  to negotiate, Beijing
 continues meanwhile to demand that the US abide by its agreements
 with China.   During Zhao Ziyang's recent trip to the US,  he
 repeatedly emphasized that the Taiwan issue remains the key
 obstacle to smooth progress in Sino-US relations.  Zhao and the
 Chinese media also called on the US to take concrete steps "this
 year" to implement its commitments in the August 1982 communique  25X1
 on arms sales to Taiwan.
 At the same time, China wants to limit what it sees as the
 growing influence of Taiwan self-determination sentiment.
 Beijing recently has stepped up its criticism of self-
 determination advocates, especially in the US.   The Chinese also
 have warned that a declaration of Taiwan independence, or the
 continued refusal  (over the long term) of Taipei to begin
 reunifiqation talks could trigger the use of force to bring about
 unity.                                                               25X1

 China-Southeast Asia
 Vietnam's occupation of Kampuchea and an increased Soviet
 presence in Indochina remain among Beij-ina's primary security
 concerns.   Since China's first effort to "teach Vietnam a lesson"
 in 1979, Beijing has followed a consistent strategy designed to:'
 Force the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from
 Kampuchea.
 -- Deprive Vietnam of its new client by promoting a
 neutral government in Kampuchea.
 -- Weaken and eventually break the Soviet-Vietnamese
 alliance with the aim of removing the Soviet
 military presence in Southeast Asia.
 -- Bring about a leadership in Hanoi more responsive to
 Chinese interests.
 The key ingredients in that strategy' are:
 -- Direct military pressure along the Sino-Vietnamese
 border, tying down Vietnam's best troops and
 equipment.

 of East Asian Analysis in response to a National Security Council

 Laotian resistance groups.
 -- Diplomatic efforts aimed at isolating Vietnam.
 -- Pursuit of better relations with ASEAN to encourage
 united opposition to the Vietnamese--with Thailand
 as the keystone.
 Soviet support for Vietnam.
 China continues to insist on a settlement based on the
 International Conference on Kampuchea formula--complete
 withdrawal, neutralization of Kampuchea under UN supervision,
 free elections. But in the October 1982 session of the Sino-
 Soviet talks the Chinese offered a five-point proposal with some
 modifications and inducements.   These include:
 -- Allowing a.Vietnamese withdrawal  in phases within a
 specified time period.
 -- Offering to resume Sino-Vietnamese talks--broken off
 in 1980--after the first increment of troops
 withdraw.
 Moving to normalize Sino-Soviet relations depending
 settlement of the Kampuchea issue.
 Thus far, the Chinese show no signs of relenting--their
 policy costs them little while Beijing believes Hanoi  is paying
 dearly.     Nevertheless, China expects Hanoi to hold out for at
 Beijing's strategy has some obvious weak points that Hanoi
 tries to exploit:
 -- Several ASEAN states regard China as a greater long-
 term threat to their security than Vietnam because
 of Chinese ties with local Communist parties and
 overseas Chinese.
 c
 -- Chinese aid to the Communist Khmer resistance forces
 is interpreted in some ASEAN and Western capitals as
 a desire to see Pol Pot return to power.   Beijing
 maintains Pol Pot's group is the most effective
 fighting force and points to the aid it gives the
 non-Communists.
 -- Without Thai cooperation China could not pr
 adequate support for the Khmer insurgents.

 And, even though Beijing has increased its ability to
 conduct a wide variety of military actions against Vietnam the
 credibility of its threats to teach Hanoi a "second lesson" has
 actually diminished.   Indeed, we believe China would be reluctant
 to undertake major offensive operations against Vietnam unless
 Thailand's security or the existence of the Khmer resistance were
 clearly threatened.   The reasons:
 -- Cost:   Beijing suffered 20,000 casualties in 1979
 and spent at least $1 billion.
 -- Vietnamese strength:   Hanoi has nearly doubled its
 troop strength along the border since 1979 while
 upgrading its equipment.
 -- Soviet presence:   The Soviets have beefed up their
 naval and air assets in Cam Ranh Bay--making Chinese
 air and sea operations against Vietnamese-held
 islands more risky.

 China:  Leadership and Succession
 Deng Xiaoping, 79 and formally only the third ranking member in the
 Communist Party, is the most powerful man in China.  Since his ascendance in
 1978, Deng has generally controlled the policy agenda, using it to reverse
 some aspects of Mao Zedong's legacy and to promote his own vision of a stable,
 prosperous China.  He and his allies have enjoyed a string-of modest successes
 in their efforts to overcome political opponents, to focus economic activity
 on improving the general standard of living, and to reform China's sprawling
 bureaucracy.  Deng has had failures as well, the most notable being an
 inability to refurbish the public image of the Communist party after two
 decades of political strife and oscillating policies.
 Successors
 Deng recognizes that he has little time remaining to accomplish all his
 goals.  To continue his program and preserve his reputation for posterity,
 Deng has installed younger, politically compatible leaders in the top party
 and state posts.  Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang,.68, has been a protege
 of Deng for more than 40 years.  Premier Zhao Ziyang, 64, has no longstanding
 personal ties to Deng but nevertheless is a capable and pragmatic lieutenent
 who shares Deng's views.
 Most of what Deng has attempted to do over the past five years has a
 succession angle.  Hu and Zhao have generally shared in Deng's victories over
 political rivals, and they also stand to gain from economic and bureaucratic
 reforms.  Indeed, they have staked their careers on achieving progress in
 these areas.  The three-year party "rectification" campaign--an effort to
 reindoctrinate veteran members, recruit educated young leaders, and purge the
 politically unreliable--is being run by Hu Yaobang with an eye to making the
 party more loyal to reformist goals and reformist leaders, such as himself.
 Hu and Zhao seek to raise a new generation of party members who are more

 sophisticated and professionally competent than the party's peasant old
 guard.  If able to effect broad personnel changes, they will simultaneously be
 expanding their own political bases.                                         25X1
 After Deng
 Should Deng die soon, however, we believe Hu would not immediately
 inherit Deng's place as first among equals in the leadership.  Although Hu may
 have stronger credentials than any other leader of his own generation, he
 remains distinctly junior to Deng's peers on the Politburo.  Moreover, we
 believe that Hu has only thin support among senior military officers, a group
 he has actively cultivated.  In our view, only a leader whose standing and
 personal connections in the party approximates Deng's could assume Deng's
 crucial roles of broker, conciliator, and final decisionmaker.  Deng's peer.
 group has scant reason to defer to Hu and would likely prefer that Deng's
 authority gravitate to one of their own, such as President  i  iannian or
 National People's Congress Chairman Peng Zhen.                                25X1
 In the post-Deng period, collective rule is probable, at least until a
 new pecking order is sorted out.  We believe that the leadership would choose
 to avoid a divisive power struggle, which would convey all the wrong signals
 both in China and abroad.  Given Hu's impulsive nature, however, we cannot
 rule out the possibility.that a blunder or series of missteps by Hu might
 provoke a concerted move by party traditionalists to replace him.  Barring
 that,  Hu would likely remain the titular head of the party,'presiding rather
 than ruling,.holding on until the gerontocrats left the scene.  For the longer

 China: Economic Reforms
 In the last five years, China has instituted a series of
 economic reforms aimed at using market forces to supplement the
 planning apparatus.   Specifically, the reforms seek to reduce
 direct government involvement in economic affairs, encourage
 entrepreneurial  initiative, and motivate the work force by more
 closely linking pay to productivity.   The reforms continue to
 face opposition from ideologues, who decry their departure from
 Marxist dogma, and from cadre at all  levels, who resent the
 erosion of their own authority resulting from the reforms.
 Reforms in Place
 The most sweeping and successful changes thus far have come
 in agriculture, where over three-quarters of the land is now
 un ed    the effective control--though not legal ownership--of
 peasant households.   Peasant farmers are free to market and
 retain the income of production above the amount contracted for
 by the government.
 In industry, enterprises that formerly remitted all but a
 small share of their profits to the government now retain a
 significantly larger share, which they may use to pay bonuses or
 invest in new facilities.   In finance, provincial governments now
 have greater discretion in spending locally generated revenues.
 In commerce, free markets reappeared in cities and the
 countryside with official sanction, and enterprises are permitted
 to sell some of their product outside the government-run
 commercial system.  In the credit sector, bank loans are
 gradually replacing government grants as sources of fixed and
 working capital.

 of East Asian Analysis in response to a National Security Council

 The government has even given its blessing to some very
 limited forms of private enterprise, though the number of
 individuals engaged in privately owned production or service
 activity is still only about 2 percent of the nonagricultural
 workforce.  Ownership of capital continues to be strictly
 controlled by the          ent, and we do not expect these controls
 to be eased.
 The Report Card
 To date the reforms have yielded mixed results.
 Agricultural output is running at record levels, reflecting the
 combined results of the reforms, better than average weather, and
 price increases.   In the industrial sector, however, productivity
 remains low, and a tremendous waste of resources is continuing.
 Reforms have also generated some new problems.  Runaway local
 investment has siphoned off funds and raw materials needed for
 infrastructure projects that Beijing regards as key to its
 modernization effort.   Moreover, poor industrial performance has
 prevented government revenues from increasing rapidly enough to
 counterbalance expenditures.   Continuous budget deficits since
 We expect Beijing to push ahead with reforms   albeit in a
 groping fashion.   Where reforms create unacceptable problems--
 economic or political--Beijing will retrench, falling back on
 command-style controls.   We have already seen some
 recentralization in a number of areas, such as foreign trade and
 production of certain agricultural goods.   Irrational prices
 prevent market forces from yielding, efficient results, but so far
 Beijing has proven reluctant to institute necessary price
 adjustments.   Therefore, we expect the reforms to yield only

 US-China Economic Relations
 Prospects are good for improved US-China economic relations
 in 1984.   The tensions over technology transfer and commodity
 trade, which last year dampened Chinese imports and left the
 United. States a deficit for the first time since 1977; have
 abated.   The liberalization of US high-technology exports,.
 combined with China's keen interest in acquiring machinery and
 technology to upgrade its factories and transportation system,
 should help revive US'sales to China.
 Commodity Picture
 US exports to China in 1984 should exceed the $2.2 billion
 level of last year.  Up to $1 billion in high-technology
 contracts will probably be signed this year.   Many of.these are
 multiyear undertakings, thus the full amount will not be
 reflected in 1984 trade.   We do not expect the Chinese to buy
 whole plants, except for used plants that become available
 because of bankruptcy or replacement.
 Grain sales could see moderate gains, even with continued
 good Chinese harvests and improved internal distribution.  Sales
 of pesticides and fertilizers,,`especially phosphates, will
 probably remain strong to support agricultural development; log
 sales could increase as much as 20 percent.  US exports of
 synthetic fibers, however, will probably continue to stagnate.
 Although China's requirements increased this year, most will be
 supplied by Asian and European producers at prices about 10
 percent below US offers.
 Chinese exports.to the United States will continue to be
 dominated by textiles and apparel, probably followed by petroleum

 products, footwear, and crafts.                                  25X1
 Investment
 US investment in China now exceeds $500 million.  The
 Industrial and Technological Cooperation Accord, the patent:-law
 (approved 12 March), and pending agreement on a bilateral
 investment treaty will bolster investor confidence and encourage
 additional commercial ties.  Some investments. will be prohibited
 until agreement on nuclear cooperation is reached. and others may
 be inhibited because China's patent law does not cpr All
 technologies--chemical formulations, for example.
 International Organizations
 China will continue to join international economic
 organizations.   Beijing, a member of GATT's Multifiber
 Arrangement since January,  is now exploring the intricacies of
 full GATT membership.  Although unlikely in 1984, Chinese
 accession to GATT would remove the last legal requirement for
 Generalized System of Preferences status.  China is also unlikely
 to obtain membership in the Asian Development Bank this year, but
 Beijing will continue to test th  ADB for indications of support
 for Chinese membership.                                             25X1
 Potential Stumbling Blocks
 Despite the improvement in Sino-US ties there is still a
 potential  for friction that could endanger economic relations..
 In recent weeks,  the Chinese have complained in the press and
 through diplomatic channels about US sales of..arms to Taiwan.  US
 restrictions on Chinese exports, primarily textiles; also
 irritate the Chinese leadership.   Further, China is annoyed that,
 in spite of relaxed US controls on technology sales, its
 purchases are still delayed by COCOM approval procedures.   Should
 any of these irritants be aggravated or should Chinese tolerances
 decline, Beijing could once again turn to other suppliers at the

 China:  -Expanding Market for US Energy Firms
 China's need for new technology, both to develop new energy
 resources and to improve the efficiency of domestic energy
 consumption,  is a major reason for Beijing's decision to
 strengthen commercial links with the West.  China, we believe,
 sees the United States as the best source for much of this
 technology and access to it is a pivotal consideration in its
 official dealings with the United States.  This linkage may
 provide a relatively stable underpinning for China's opening to
 the United States.   Beijing did not, for instance, allow the 1983
 political and economic controversies with the United States to
 impede the critical, offshore oil contract neqotiations that were
 occurring at the same time.
 Key areas in which energy technology is already forging
 important commercial  links between the two countries include
 joint ventures for offshore oil exploration and development, coal
 mining, and electric power development.  Two areas of potential
 cooperation--contingent upon solving difficult investment and
 political.problems--include hydroelectric and nuclear power
 development which some Chinese view as the likely dominant energy
 sources  in the next century (see Appendix).
 In most of these fields,  China believes the US holds the
 most desirable technology; however, US firms usually face fierce
 competition from European and Japanese firms.   China, moreover,
 has proved adept at playing these competitors against each
 other.   This competition will probably become more intense,
 particularly when it comes to the financing of energy projects--
 an area in which the United States appears at considerable
 disadvantage.

 Oil and Gas
 Offshore Oil  Thirteen US firms have contracts to explore
 and develop large sections of China's continental  shelf.   At
 least 20 wells will be drilled in 1984, the first year of a
 minimum three-year exploration effort.   If successful,  this
 exploration will  lead to long-term--up to 35 years--commitments
 by the firms to-work in Chi a in an industry of vital  importance
 to Beijing.
 Onshore Oil   US firms are rapidly increasing sales of
 seismic surveying and processing equipment--including high speed
 computers--and secondary recovery technology needed by China to
 maintain current onshore production rates.
 Natural Gas   Atlantic Richfield and Santa Fe, the first
 contractors for offshore oil exploration, have already made a
 natural gas discovery that may be large enough to warrant
 development of a petrochemical/fertilizer complex.   The discovery
 has been marred, however, by                        rill ship and its
 80 member US-Chinese crew.
 Coal Mining
 Beijing spent $1.13 billion on coal mining equipment and
 technology purchases from the West. in 1978-82 and is looking for
 $5 billion in foreign investment in China's coal mine development
 through the 1990s.   China has turned to European and Japanese
 suppliers for mining machinery, but favors US suppliers in
 several key areas:
 Open Pit Mining  The Chinese want US firms to help develop
 production at huge coal mining areas  in northern China.   Talks
 with Occidental Petroleum for development of the $1 billion
 Pingshuo area have stalled over financial details and marketing
 responsibility. although some equipment for Pingshuo is on

 Electric Power
 A 1979 technology transfer agreement with Westinghouse is
 helping China to produce 300 MW turbine generator units and will
 eventually lead to production of 600 MW units as well.   Beijing
 may 'seek modifications of these units for use in nuclear power
 plants.   US firms are also leading contenders for supply of
 computerized grid management systems and are providing technical
 training for Chinese managers.   US expertise has been used to
 help plan China's ambitious hydropower efforts but the Chinese
 now appear to be leaning toward Japanese firms for the actual
 purchase of construction equipment and technology.   US firms may
 play an important role in China's nuclear power plans, contingent
 upon the signing of a US-China nuclear power agreement.

 China:                  Nuclear Power Prospects
 China is one of few countries in the world still optimistic
 about the use of nuclear power.  No, nuclear plants are on line--
 nor will they be until probably the early 1990s--but Beijing
 hopes to have 5 to 10 plants operating by the year 2000,
 contributing at least 10,000 megawatts (MW) or 5 percent of the
 county's power requirements.
 Beijing has been trying to develop indigenous nuclear power
 technology since 1970 and now has a relatively small (300 MW)
 plant in an early stage of construction near Shanghai.   The
 thrust of the Chinese nuclear program is to import at least two
 1800 MW turnkey plants along with the technology to begin
 building such plants.   Even the domestically designed plant is
 slated to use considerable Western technology,  including a
 Japanese built reactor vessel, West German coolant pumps, and
 US-designed turbine/generator units.
 France, which has signed several nuclear agreements with
 China since 1978 but still has not made a sale, leads in the
 competition to provide the turnkey plants.   Prominent Chinese
 officials now state that Framatome has won a contract to provide
 an 1800-MW plant to be constructed near Hong Kong.   Hong Kong has
 been" asked to help finance the plant in return for a large share
 of the power output.   We expect Framatome will also be awarded
 contracts to build a similar plant northwest of Shanghai.
 China has  long preferred US nuclear technology--not being
 content with the Westinghouse derivative technology offered by
 Framatome--but has been prevented from purchasing US plants
 because of Beijing's unwillingness to agree to certain non-

 China, according to press reports, last month accepted similar
 Japanese provisions including "friendly" visitation rights by the
 Japanese and appears close to such an agreement with West Germany
 and the United States.                                                  25X1
 China is already attempting to sign contracts with US firms
 for consultation and engineering. help for the French reactors--
 still prohibited under US law--and has carried out extensive
 negotiations with Westinghouse and General Electric for the
 supply of nuclear reactors.   It is also discussing the purchase
 of two surplus 1300-MW power reactors from TVA.   Financing of
 such projects--providing a nuclear agreement is reached--could
 still be a major hurdle, however, as China is reluctant to borrow
 at commercial or even EX-IM Bank rates.   A direct purchase would
 be a major strain on the country's already pressed electric power
 investment budget.                                                    25X1

 China:,  Changes In Military Industrial Develo men
 Policy--Implications'for the United States
 China is merging its military and civilian R&D organizations
 in order to strengthen its scientific and technological research
 capabilities.   At the same time, military industries--most
 notably the six military machine-building industries--are being
 integrated with civilian   industry to enlarge their contribution
 to the overall development of the economy.
 A series of organizational and policy changes  introduced
 since 1981 will have a major impact on future Chinese military
 and civilian industrial activity:
 o       Planning of military and civilian S&T and industrial
 activity will be increasingly centralized.
 o       Military and civilian research institutes and factories
 will be consolidated into specialized research and
 production combines.
 o       Acquisition of advanced foreign technologies and equipment.
 will be stepped up.
 The closer military-civilian relationship will pose new
 problems for the United States  in monitoring Chinese weapons
 programs and in implementing the export control  system:
 o       The merger of military and civilian institutes and
 factories into specialized combines will further obscure
 Chinese progress  in the strategic and special mission
 areas; so will newly tightened security measures in

 Chinese research and production facilities and on Chinese
 personnel.
 o   Determining the military or civilian status of end-users
 of US and Western technology exports will become far more
 difficult.
 o   if China follows through on its stated preference for
 acquiring US technologies, other members of COCOM may
 become even more reluctant to agree to further
 liberalization of export restrictions.
 o   The new policies also increase the likelihood of closer
 military linkages to joint ventures and similar technology
 transfer mechanisms.   These types of transactions may
 become a more sensitive issue in COCOM deliberations than
 the export of  articular pieces of equipment and
 machinery.
 We believe that Beijing will benefit from these changes in
 several ways:
 o   There will be a more systematic ordering of priorities.
 This could eliminate some of the wasteful duplication of
 past Chinese efforts to acquire technology and equipment
 .abroad.
 o   Although military needs will  remain paramount, civilian
 industry will also profit from increased. access to
 technology developed or acquired for military purposes.
 o   Increased production of civilian goods by military
 industry should also be a plus--for the military in terms
 of greater use of idle capacity and increased revenues;
 for the civilian economy in terms of larger quantities of
 badly needed producer and consumer goods.
 The concentration on key industrial and S&T projects implied by
 these policy changes may already be beginning to bear fruit.
 China's new "Galaxy" super computer was developed by combining
 the talents of both military and civilian research organizations
