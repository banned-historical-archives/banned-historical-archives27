 11056                    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 True,  this  present type of warfare is
 against South Vietnam, but it is not re-
 stricted to that country alone. Should South
 Vietnam fall prey to communism, the impact
 of such a Communist victory in lesser de-
 veloped countries of the free world would
 indeed be incalculable.  New efforts of this
 type would be mounted, not only in other
 parts of southeast Asia, but in Africa and
 Latin America.
 The success of this type of warfare in South
 Vietnam would also immeasurably strengthen
 the  world's  most  aggressive  Communist
 power, Communist China, in its twin theses
 that aggression pays off and that the United
 States is but a "paper tiger."
 If we break the pledge of three Presidents
 to South Vietnam, how can other Asian na-
 tions and their peoples count on us in the
 future?
 We must not only study history but learn
 from it.  President Johnson on April 28 said,
 "This is the clearest lesson of our time.  From
 Munich until today, -we have learned that
 to yield to aggression brings only greater
 threats and brings even more destructive
 war.  To stand firm is the only guarantee of
 a lasting peace.'
 How well we should remember the tri-
 umphant words of British Prime Minister
 Neville Chamberlain, In September of 1938,
 when he returned to England after his Mu-
 nich conference with Hitler and Mussolini.
 He said, "For the second time in history, a
 British Prime Minister has returned from
 Germany bringing peace for our time.  Go
 home and get a nice quiet sleep."
 I prefer, instead, the words of realism of
 Winston Churchill, which proved so true:
 "The belief that security can be obtained by
 throwing a small state to the wolves is a
 fatal delusion."
 Myth No. 3: "We will eventually lose, and
 Communist  China  will  inevitably  control
 Asia."
 I will not accept that as reality, and there
 is no need to.  Even the Communists wish
 they could count on this myth as a reality.
 Our actions have rudely jarred their firm
 belief that it is s&
 China has not actually controlled this
 area for most of the past 1,000 years, and
 will not, if free nations remain firm.  Un-
 questionably, our hardened actions are get-
 ting results-in the morale and will to resist
 on the part of the South Vietnamese-in
 greater respect for America's will to do what
 it says and follow its commitments. Indeed,
 there are reports of new tensions in Hanoi
 itself.  Reports which commence to indicate
 that the North Vietnamese themselves have
 become more and more split due to the
 'tighter pressure we have placed upon them
 and there are increased and more serious
 bickerings between Communist China and
 the Soviet Union.
 There is no question that China will con-
 tinue to be influential, and increasingly in-
 fluential, in Asia, but even dominance need
 not and must not mean domination.
 President Johnson has said in answer to the
 myth of China's inevitable victory in south-
 east Asia, "There is no end to that argument
 until all of the nations of Asia are swallowed
 But, to the pessimists and defeatists, I
 would say that in the long view of history,
 people who demonstrate their determination
 to fight to achieve and to maintain their
 freedom, remain free.  We shall honor our
 commitment to help South Vietnam defend
 itself.  With the free world's great strength
 and with our equally great determination;
 we shall remain free.
 While holding out his offer for "uncon-
 ditional  discussions,"  the  President  has
 nevertheless issued a clear warning against
 Communist 'aggression. He said, "We will
 not be defeated. We will, not grow tired.
 We will not withdraw either openly, or under
 the cloak of a meaningless agreement."
 Myth No. 4: "Vietnam is a civil war."
 This is myth, not reality.  Even Hanoi
 does not attempt to deny that it is actively
 supporting, assisting, and abetting the Viet-
 cong in South Vietnam.  Even they, when
 calling upon us to discuss peace terms with
 the National Liberation Front,  which in-
 cludes a few non-Communists as window
 dressing, but is overwhelmingly Communist-

 North Vietnam would have controlling num-
 bers In any peace discussions.                                                                                Most of the
 National Liberation Front leaders are resi-
 dents in Hanoi.
 Our intelligence information, statements
 of captured and defecting Vietcong mem-
 bers, clearly show the stepped-up and heavy
 infiltration of soldiers from North Vietnam
 into South Vietnam.  As a matter of fact,
 in recent months Hanoi has begun to give
 direct radio signals, orders to units operating
 In South Vietnam, coordinating their num-
 bers and concentration of targets.
 Evidence shows that major regular army
 units from Hanoi are now operating in the
 south and that there has been wholesale
 importation  of  supplies  and  armaments
 brought in to the guerrillas. In recent bat-
 tles, the Vietcong are found to be armed
 with weapons, 90 percent of which come
 from outisde, mostly from China and Czecho-
 slovakia and nearly 100 percent of the larger
 weapons from China.  We stepped up our
 efforts in South Vietnam as the efforts of
 the  North  Vietnamese  aggression  were
 stepped up on the other side.
 New though its tactics may be, the situa-
 tion in Vietnam is notcivil war, but outright
 aggression. As President Johnson has said,
 "The confused nature of this conflict cannot
 mask the fact that this is the new face of
 an old enemy. It is an attack by one country
 upon another.  And the object bf that at-
 tack is a friend to which we are pledged."
 Myth No. 5: "South Vietnam is incapable
 of stable government" '
 First, let me say that there are truly na-
 tionalistic forces in South Vietnam who have
 not supported some or all of the govern-
 ments there in recent time-young Turks in
 the military, some Catholic elements, some
 Buddhist elements, and some students.  No
 one is happy with the "musical chair" ap-
 proach which has beenprevalent recently in
 South Vietnam's Government.
 But let me say this: First of all, the only
 government the people of South Vietnam
 knew, before their own independent-govern-
 ment was established, was that of France,
 which, at that time, was almost a model in
 its frequent changes for what has been tak-
 ing place In the South Vietnamese Govern-
 ment.  Furthermore, the South Vietnamese
 have  had  little  chance  for  governmental
 stability. The Communists never intended
 to abide by the Geneva accord of 1954. They
 were supposed to pull back to the 17th paral-
 lel as the French left.  Instead, they left arms
 caches,  infiltrators, and guerrillas  in  the
 south,   and took others   to the north for
 training and eventual reentry.  Immediately,
 they made plans for control of South Viet-
 nam, which they felt was ready to fall like
 a ripe plum, but it has not been so.   At first
 it was felt they would be successful in 6
 months.  Ten years have passed, and they
 have not been successful.
 What chance for governmental stability
 Is there In a country where local and na-
 tional officials have been systematically mur-
 dered and kidnaped to the degree that, had
 such terroristic efforts been carried on in the
 United States in such proportion, it would
 have been the equivalent of killing 6,000
 mayors and kidnaping 20,000 mayors here?
 The people of South Vietnam seek free-
 dom and independence.  They have proved
 themselves  courageous and  hard  working.
 Equally important, they are among the most
 persistent and determined people on the
 face of the earth.  Any people which has
 May 25, 196,
 taken so many casualties and gone on fight
 ing, deserves the respect of the entire world
 They are at least entitled to have their bord-
 ers sealed off and achieve self-determination
 without outside aggression.  The Quat gov-
 ernment, now In power, has lasted longer
 than most.  Every day it lasts, its chances
 of continuing are greater.   The people of
 South Vietnam want to govern themselves;
 they are fighting for that right and we must
 help them.
 Myth No. 6: "The people of South Vietnam
 are in sympathy with the Communist Viet-
 cong."
 Our evidence is very much to the con-
 trary.  The South Vietnamese now have ap-
 proximately  500,000--one-half  million--of
 their people as regular troops, fighting in the
 field against the Vietcong.  Does this sound
 like support for the Vietcong? During the
 last 5 years, the South Vietnamese forces
 have suffered nearly 80,000 military and civil-
 ian casualties in fighting the Vietcong.  In
 relation to their population, this would be
 equivalent to more than 1 million casualties
 for the United States.  Does this sound like
 support for the Vietcong?
 Despite dissension in past governments, no
 South Vietnamese Government leader has
 ever advocated bringing representatives of
 the Vietcong into the government.
 Morale is clearly Increasing among the
 people of South Vietnam because of our help
 and planned escalation of hostilities, as is
 plainly Indicated by a cross section of press
 accounts from that area.  There are other
 indications of improved morale in the south.
 More and more weapons are being captured
 by the South Vietnamese.  More and more
 defectors are leaving guerilla forces to return
 to their home and families. In many places
 the efforts in the south on our side have now
 shifted  from offensive to defensive.  And,
 very importantly, in 1 week recently it was
 reported that 8,000 South Vietnamese vol-
 unteered for service in the South Vietnamese
 Army.    Not long ago we would have been
 talking about South Vietnamese deserters,
 instead of volunteers.
 The South Vietnamese, by their own sacri-
 fices, have so eloquently said that they do
 not support the Vietcong or want Commu-
 nist domination, that this myth should not
 be given any responsible belief.
 Myth No. 7: "The United States Is going it
 alone in Vietnam."
 This is not so.  Thirty-three free world
 countries, including the United States, are
 providing, or have agreed to provide assist-
 ance to South Vietnam.  A 2,000-man South
 Korean engineer battalion arrived in Saigon
 in mid-March.  Last week,  Australia an-
 nounced it would soon dispatch an 800-man
 combat infantry battalion to South Viet-
 nam. . Whese two recent efforts are small in
 comparison to our own, more than 30,000
 fighting men there, but they are most signifi-
 cant because they evidence a growing aware-
 ness by the people of Asia that this is basic-
 ally their fight.
 Many decry our efforts there and wish that
 the United Nations or some other multi-
 lateral organization might assume tifis heavy
 burden.  I say: "Easier said than done."
 There has been criticism of American ef-
 forts there without international organiza-
 tion approval.  First, let me say that I was
 glad to see the approving action just last
 Wednesday by the Southeast Asia  Treaty
 Organization, and, second, let It be said that
 in the words of Senator GALE  MCGEE  of
 Wyoming:
 "We have to live with our conscience. We

 ment is right because it is right, not because
 we are trying to win a popularity poll witb,

 The United States is, not. going it alone,
 Ind .I believe that others will continue to
 Join us.  But, until the aggression is stopped
 or until other resistance to aggression is
 assumed by additional nations or by some
 international  organization,  we must  con-
 tinue the great responsibility inherent in
 great power.
 Myth No. 8: "The United States has vio-
 lated the 1954 Geneva accord."
 The reality is that the United, States in-
 creased its personnel and weaponry and its
 planned  escalation  there only after  con-
 firmed Communist violations of the Geneva
 accord, and our Increased efforts have been
 measured and responsive to the increased
 violations.  We were and are in favor of
 United Nations-supervised elections and ul-
 timate unification of the two countries, but
 the facts of life are that neither earlier, nor
 now, do conditions exist for really free elec-
 tions in North Vietnam or immediate re-
 unification.
 Every  agreement  is  a  two-way street.
 Therefore, we have not and we should not
 be bound by restrictions while the other
 side is free to do as it pleases.
 Myth No. 9: "The United States is con-
 cerned solely with military actions In Viet-
 nam and is the real block to peaceful settle-
 ment."
 The realities show there has been a long
 list of accomplishments in the economic sec-
 tor of South Vietnam, that it was making
 steady progress toward economic soundness
 and that it was experiencing steady growth
 in its gross national product, prior to the in-
 creased efforts against it by North Vietnam.
 The President has indicated his desire in
 no uncertain terms to turn our interests
 there toward peaceful pursuits, rather than
 toward war.  He has Made it clear over and
 over again, as he did in his speech at Johns
 Hopkins University, that we remain ready
 for "unconditional discussions." Yet,  the
 Communist response has been decidely nega-
 tive thus far, although the offer remains
 open.
 All' that is necessary for peace to be re-
 stored and for our military efforts to be re-
 duced is for the North Vietnamese to stop
 their aggression.  Even Yugoslavia doesn't
 believe this myth and has indicated that
 Hanoi and Peiping are being unrealistic in
 their demands.
 So, finally, we come back to the reality
 that the Communists have not changed their
 goals, but only altered their. strategy.  We
 come back to the reality that this is old-
 style aggression, dressed up in new clothes.
 We come back to the reality that aggression
 feeds upon itself and spreads unless met and
 stopped when Its starts.  We come back to
 the reality that this is not a war over South
 Vietnam, but over the peace and security of
 southeast Asia and the world.
 We come back. to the reality that there is
 no dramatic way to bring things back to
 normality in one fell swoop, but that pa-
 tience and perseverance are required.  We
 come back to the reality that America's word,
 its commitment has been given and accepted
 and must be kept.
 We cogne back to the reality that this
 should not be a debate by the "hawks" and
 "dovs," those who seek war and those who
 seek peace, because all of us seek peace.  But
 We must take to heart the history-taught
 reality that he who seeks peace, by taking
 risks now in order to assure that such peace
 will be just and lasting, is no less a peace-
 maker than he who asks for peace immedi-
 ately with_ no safeguard that it may not
 have to b  enforced or defended later at
 much greater price.
 We come back to the reality that only in-
 creased pressure will stop this aggression
 and only increased will and determination
 will preserve the freedom and independence
 of the countries of southeast Asia and the
 world.
 The ultimate reality is that the goal of
 this country is and must remain, as Church-
 ill set for his own people: "In war, resolu-
 tion;  in defeat, defiance; In victory, mag-
 nanimity; in peace, good will."

 statement was ordered to be printed in

 GI BILL FAVORABLY REPORTED
 Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President,
 this morning the Labor and Public Wel-
 fare Committee favorably reported the
 cold war GI bill, S. 9, to the Senate. It
 is my hope that this body will not allow
 the cold war GI bill to languish on the
 Senate Calendar, as it did for more than
 a year during the 88th Congress, but will
 give the bill a fair and adequate consider-
 ation on the Senate floor.
 This bill is cosponsored by 41 Senators,
 the most in its history, and it has ac-
 cumulated a vast amount of support from
 all areas of this country.  If we are to
 achieve the Great Society, it is essential
 that we do not discriminate against the
 40 percent of our draft-eligible young
 men who defend this country. We can-
 not create pockets of poverty by neglect-
 ing these men and still expect this coun-
 try to progress toward the Great Society.
 The predecessors of the cold war GI
 bill, the World War II, and the Korean
 GI bill have proven to be two of the
 most successful pieces of legislation ever
 passed by Congress. Our choice is sim-
 ple: We can either continue to neglect
 these men and impede our progress as a
 Nation, or we can provide them with the
 effective and just educational assistance
 they need, adding additional thrust to
 the success of this country.
 I believe the latter course is the only
 wise position, and hope that this body
 will consider this proposal in the near
 future.
 I ask unanimous consent that a letter
 I recently received from Pfc. William
 Iver Lessley, of the U.S. Army, be printed
 at this point in the RECORD to emphasize
 the need for this bill.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Hon. RALPH YARBOROUGH,
 Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.O.
 DEAR SENATOR YARBOROUGH:  Recently, my
 attention was brought to the bill which you
 helped to sponsor that deals with the aid for
 the education of cold war veterans, while I
 was perusing a January 1965 issue of Harper's
 magazine.   The bill, as explained in your
 article, proposes, in my opinion, a great good
 for the country.  The fact that the total out-
 lay for the program each year would only be
 a fraction of a percent of the whole defense
 program, combined with the convincing ar-
 gument which shows that the money spent
 on the program would be more than paid
 back during the next two or three decades in
 higher taxes paid as a result of greater earn-
 ing power through education, makes me be-
 lieve that the bill, or one similar to it would,
 indeed, be a positive good for the Nation as
 a whole, and not a program that would just
 11057
 favor a very small portion of the population.
 One must remember that money spent on
 education is nothing short of an investment
 in the future of the individual involved, and
 therefore an investment in the future of the
 Nation.   In the long run, all citizens will
 benefit from the passing of the proposed bill
 for the assistance to the education of cold-
 war veterans.
 The very fact that most of the first-term
 men in the services of the Nation are not in-
 volved in a career, but, rather, interrupting
 a career, or delaying the start of one for the
 sake of their country-for the protection of
 the country they love-seems to me to qual-
 ify them for a little extra consideration by
 their countrymen.   When a man gives 6
 months, 2 years, 3 years, or more of his life
 to Insure the safety and security of his coun-
 try and loved ones, is it too much to ask of
 those for whom he has served so well, for so
 long, for so little-is it too much to ask of
 those who owe so much-is it too, much to
 ask of those people such a relatively small
 donation to help the men who have defended
 the Nation that they love and have served so
 well?  Is it too much to ask this small deed
 so that they  (the cold-war veterans)  may
 further their own education and become more
 responsible citizens who would be not only
 willing, but able to help further develop and
 improve the country and society that they
 have served and protected by way of their
 time in the military service? My answer, as
 I am sure would agree with yours, to these
 questions is an emphatic no.  The men in
 the services who have given up so much for
 their country deserve a helping hand from
 those whom they have served.  It only seems
 fair.
 Although I am not a citizen of Texas, my
 wholehearted support, both as a seviceman
 and as a citizen of the United States of
 America, is with you in your efforts to make
 this bill to aid in the education of cold-war
 veterans into law.  Good luck in your diffi-
 cult task.
 Sincerely,
 WILLIAM IvER LESSLEY,
 Private, First Class, U.S. Army.

 aircraft program.  Subsequent to this out
 the Department of Defense furnished infor-

 at the time of its original consideration of
 this program. The Department of Defense
 in its later furnished information stated that
 an attempt is being made "to achieve lower
 procurement costs through a continuing pro-
 gram of updating Government owned equip-
 ment which has become technologically ob-
 solete.  We encourage the services to budget
 5 percent of the value of their active inven-
 tory for this purpose-representing turnover
 of equipment only every 20 years.  In the
 fiscal year 1966 budget the Air Force request
 of $27.5 million for this purpose is equal to
 only 3.5 percent of the inventory value.  Re-
 duction of this request will hamper our ef
 forts to reduce procurement costs through
 modernization  of  our  production      tech-
 niques."
 On the basis of this additional Informa-
 tion, the House conferees agreed that the
 $5 million should be returned to the pro-
 gram.
 The House recedes.
 Air Force (Missiles)
 In Its consideration of the Air Force mis-
 sile program, the House Committee out $25
 million from the missile support equipment
 and facilities program.  Additional infor-
 mation. subsequently furnished by the De-
 partment of Defense indicates that this cut
 could generate problems within the missile
 program of the Department of Defense and
 the conferees agreed that it should be re-
 turned.
 The House recedes.
 Research, development, test and evaluation.
 The biil.passed by the Senate reduced the
 requested research and development budg-
 et by $44 million, all of which was to be
 taken from the military sciences budget ac-
 tivity. The Senate then added.to the amount
 requested $82 million, to be applied only for
 the development of the advanced manned
 strategic aircraft (AMSA), for a net addition
 to the budget of $38 million.
 The bill as it passed the House reduced
 the research and development budget by
 $121.3 million.  The House added $7 million
 to the` amount requested for the advanced
 manned strategic aircraft.  Thus, the ac-
 tion by the House reflected a net reduc-
 tion of $114.3 million to the total amount
 requested for research, development, test and
 evaluation.
 The bill passed by the House contained
 restrictive language for the $150 million au-
 thorized for the manned orbiting laboratory
 (MOL).  This restrictive language was ac-
 cepted by the Senate in conference.
 Both bills included restrictive language
 for the amounts added for the development
 of an advanced manned strategic aircraft.
 In conference the Senate receded and ac-
 cepted the House language which added only
 $7 million above the amount requested. The
 total amount of new obligational author-
 ity, $22 million, is available only for the de-
 velopment of an advanced manned strategic
 aircraft.  Both the House and the Senate
 continue to support the development of a
 follow-osl manned ..bomber.  However, the
 conference committee, agreed that the addi-
 tional $22 ;pillion in new obligational au-
 thority is about the maximum that could
 be expended wisely and effectively during
 ments.  Therefore, it was recommended that
 the reductions could be taken in program
 areas other than those indicated and could
 be on the basis of military priorities of each
 department.
 Army
 The House reduced the amount requested
 for Army research, development, test, and
 evaluation by $31.6 million.  The Senate re-
 duced $8.5 million from the amount re-
 quested,  The Senate recedes and accepts
 the House reduction.  Thus, the amount au-
 thorized for Army R.D.T. & E. is $1,406,400,000.
 Navy
 The House reduced the amount requested
 for Navy research development, test and eval-
 uation by $33.4 million.                                                                                  The Senate reduced
 $10 million from the amount requested.  The
 Senate recedes and accepts. the House ver-
 sion.  Thus, the amount authorized for Navy
 R.D.T. & E. is $1,439,200,000.
 Air Force
 The House reduced $50.9 million from the
 amount requested and then added on $7 mil-
 lion for the advanced manned strategic air-
 craft, for a net reduction of $43.9 million.
 The Senate reduced the amount requested by
 $8.5 million and then added on $82 million
 for the advanced manned strategic aircraft.
 The Senate recedes and accepts the House
 version.  Thus, the amount authorized for
 the Air Force R.D.T. & E. is $3,103,900,000,
 Defense agencies
 The House reduced the amount requested
 for research, development, test and evalua-
 tion by the Defense agencies by $5.4 million,
 The Senate reduced $17 million from the
 amount requested,  The Senate recedes and
 accepts the House version. Thus, $495,000,000
 is authorized for research, development, test
 and evaluation for Defense agencies.
 TITLE III
 The House added six new sections to the
 bill.   Each of them is described and the
 rationale explained below:
 Section 301. Repeal of tonnage: The Vin-
 son-Trammell  Act  and  subsequent  acts
 created tonnage which now is in excess of
 3,300,000 tons. From every practical stand-
 point, the enactment of section 412(b) has
 rendered  existing  tonnage authorizations
 meaningless.  Bookkeeping on this tonnage is
 expensive.
 Section 302. Alternate ship provision: Sec-
 tion 301, in addition to repealing outstanding
 tonnage also repealed the alternate ship pro-
 vision of the Vinson-Trammell Act.   It is
 considered desirable that this provision be
 preserved.
 The Vinson-Trammell Act applied only to
 "warships,"   Since that act, escort vessels
 have become an important part of the Navy.
 The  House    committee,  therefore,  in  re-
 enacting the alternate ship provision modi-
 fled                                                                            it slightly to  include        "warships and
 escort vessels."  In this year's bill alone the
 change will embrace 10 destroyer escorts at
 a price of $279.1 million.
 Section 303. 65/35: Today at least 35 per-
 cent of all conversion, alteration and repair
 of naval ships must, under Appropriations
 Committee language, be performed in private
 shipyards.  This section would eliminate this
 requirement.
 The Navy and the Secretary of Defense
 strongly support this new section.
 The Secretary of the Navy in a letter to
 the committee stated, among other things,
 that:  "Cost studies show that there is no
 approved by the Department of Defense to                     yarcrt Uun, and repair work (CAR) to private
 datq.                                                        yards.  In  fact,  annual  savings  can  be
 The House reduced specific                                 achieved under present cost differentials by

 ments in arriving at the recommended re-                                         tion, and repair work assigned to naval ship-
 e      allowed the flexibility to

 yards.  If all factors involved in these as-
 signments were to permit an increase from
 the current statutory level of 65 percent to a
 somewhat higher level, it is estimated that
 an annual savings of several million dollars
 could be achieved.  This results from the
 fact that the naval shipyards which must be
 maintained  for strategic  and  operational
 reasons have a high fixed overhead cost which
 continues regardless of. workload assigned."
 Section 304. Inclusion of tracked combat
 vehicles in 412(b): This section will require
 procurement authorization for "tracked ve-
 hicles" in addition to aircraft, missiles, and
 naval  vessels.  For  fiscal  year  1966  about
 $200 million would have been involved.
 Section 305. Emergency fund: Each year
 Congress makes available to the Department
 of Defense an Emergency Fund for Research
 and Development.      It has varied between
 $125 and $150 million.  The House commit-
 tee believes that this emergency fund should
 be authorized in the same fashion as all
 other funds for research and development.
 Section 306. Changing name of MATS: The
 House committee believes that MATS is too
 important to be designated as a "service".
 Military Airlift Command is both descriptive
 of its true function and provides a recogni-
 tion of its vital missions.  The cost of mak-
 ing this change is estimated at be $173,800.
 This change in name is to be effective as of
 January 1, 1966.
 The Senate recedes with respect to these
 six new sections.
 SUMMARY
 The bill as presented to the Congress by
 the  President  totaled  $15,297,200,000  (of
 which $6,558,800,000 was for research, devel-
 opment, test, and evaluation).  The bill as
 it passed the House totaled $15,303,400,000
 (of which $6,444,500,000 was for R.D.T. & E.).
 The bill as it passed the Senate totaled $15,-
 283,800,000 (of which $6,596,800,000 was for
 R.D.T. & E.).
 The bill as agreed to in conference totals
 $15,402,800,000 (of which $6,444,500,000 is for
 R.D.T. & E.).
 The agreement arrived at by the conferees
 is $99,400,000 more than the bill as it passed
 the House, $119,000,000 more than the bill as
 it passed  the Senate,                             and  is $105,600,000
 above the bill as it was presented to the
 Congress by the President.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE-              ay
 lief in the right of people to govern'them-
 selves. 'Yet too often in the short run
 we yield to other considerations and fail
 to act decisively when free government
 is threatened.
 Mr. Speaker, if the United States had
 made its intention to support restoration
 of constitutional processes in the Domin-
 scan Republic explicit at the outset, much
 of the criticism directed toward our Gov-
 ernment would have been avoided.  It is,
 nevertheless, a tribute to the wisdom and
 understanding of our President that U.S.
 policy is clearly emerging on the side of
 the people of the Dominican Republic
 and their right to govern themselves.
 Mr. Speaker, we need to make this sup-
 port of self-government a long-term
 commitment.  Such, a commitment will
 require a reexamination of some of the
 current ideas about intervention held
 within the OAS and elsewhere.
 Yet such a commitment is essential if
 we are to preserve democratic govern-
 ments in the Western Hemisphere and
 ultimately throughout the world.
 Mr. Speaker, under unanimous consent
 I insert a report published in today's issue
 of the Christian Science Monitor:

 vindication  in  the  Dominican  Republic.
 where the issue was more sharply defined
 for the whole world to see.  The direction
 now has become one of vindication.
 There has never been any question here
 of relaxing the guard against Communist
 infiltration, either in the Caribbean or in
 southeast Asia.  That remains the first aim
 of the U.S. policy.
 The  question    was  whether  a  predomi-
 nantly military action, such as stiffening
 American military action in Vietnam and
 using the guns of the Dominican Army to
 restore order, was enough in itself to cheek
 communism without also building a strong
 middle-ground government and encouraging
 it to make the reforms which would ease the
 revolutionary pressures that feed commu-
 nism.
 RISKS COMPARED
 On page 10110, column 3, line 24,
 "January 29" should read "January 25."
 Ol page 10114, column 3, the second
 line from the bottom, the words "Mr.
 STRATTON" should be inserted at the be-
 ginning of the line, since these remarks
 and those thatfollow on the subsequent
 pages are my remarks, not the remarks
 of the gentleman from Missouri [Mr.
 HtNGATE.]
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 permanent RECORD be corrected accord-
 ingly.
 The SPEAKER.  Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from New
 York?
 There was no objection.

 In the first place, we go on as previously

 Following that we shall take up S. 800.
 There will be a rule on this bill waiving

 In Vietnam the makings of such a govern-
 ment exist, but it has not been a prime ob-
 ject of U.S. policy.  President Johnson has
 looked chiefly to military measures to achieve
 his purpose.  In the Caribbean the ingredi-
 ents of such a non-Communist government
 were actually being liquidated by the forces
 of the military junta.
 To the more military minded advisers in
 Washington the risks of this course seemed
 less than the risks of working with popular
 reform governments which seemed vulner-
 able to the maneuvers of Communists and
 of radicals who are willing to work with
 Communists.
 There are highly placed political advisers
 to the President, however, who took the op-
 WASHINGTON.-One of the historic turning
 points in the foreign policy of the United
 States may well have been passed in the past
 few days.  The United States now is acting
 to check communism through the .forces of
 popular, democratic government instead of
 through military reaction.
 Although the change of course has come
 in the Dominican Republic, it is likely to
 have a profound effect on the much more
 important case of Vietnam, where a similar
 problem exists.
 Up until some time last week, President
 Johnson and his advisers were backing the

 U.S.  POLICY  ON  THE                       SIDE  OF
 DEMOCRATIC  CONSTITUTIONAL
 PROCESSES
 (Mr. FRASER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his remarks
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. FRASER.  Mr. Speaker, as a se-
 vere critic of earlier U.S. positions in
 the Dominican Republic, I want to com-
 mend President Johnson for the current
 policy which places U.S.. power and au-
 thority on the side of democratic con-
 stitutional processes.  In the long run we
 have no other choice because of our be-
 or-
 acting through a foreign military dicta
 ship to crush it will have ended.
 It is considered not too late to recover the
 rapidly fading respect of the progressive
 forces in Latin America and elsewhere in the
 free world.   Indeed the dramatic turn of
 events  is  likely  actually  to  enhance  the
 American position.
 CREDIBILITY RESCUED
 From Washington, it also appears that
 something much more important now is pos-
 sible.                                                                               For the credibility of the United States
 and of President Johnson, when he promised
 to withdraw from Vietnam as soon as free
 government was secure, had been severely
 damaged.
 It seemed for a while that American policy
 in Vietnam might find its graveyard or its
 Though in the minority, they have argued
 that communism feeds on economic unrest,
 plus the unpopularity of so-called strong-
 arm regimes-or on weak though well-mean-
 ing governments (like that of Saigon) which
 are unable to bring about economic and po-
 litical reform.
 These advisers have insisted that com-
 munism can best be thwarted by the maxi-
 mum emphasis on the kind of people's gov-
 ernment that the United States believes in.
 Events now appear to have brought the
 President around to this view.
 The events included the mounting criti-
 cism of the friends of the United States in
 the free world, the action of the Dominican
 military junta in discrediting itself, and a
 swinging of the pendulum in argument with-
 in the highest echelons of the Government
 here.
 It now remains to be seen whether the
 President can stay on the new course and
 what its influence  n the restraint of com-
 munism and the sfipport of the free world

 (Mr. RACE asked and was given per-

 point in the RECORD and to include ex-

 Mr. RACE.  Mr. Speaker, my distin-
 guished colleague from Wisconsin, the
 senior Senator, WILLIAM PROXMIRE, re-
 cently traveled to Reed College in Port-
 land, Oreg., where he debated with the
 very able senior Senator from that State,
 WAYNE MORSE.  The topic which they
 debated was one which merits the con-
 cern of all Americans-the policy of the
 United States in Vietnam.  Because of
 the timeliness of this topic, I extend my
 remarks at this point in the RECORD in
 order to bring this debate to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues:

 simple: (1) We want the, independence of
 South Vietnam-what is wrong with that?
 (2) *e want peace and freedom In Asia and
 in the world, and what is wrong with that?
 (3) We want to stop Communist aggression,
 and what is wrong with that?  American
 policy is not reckless.  It is not an all-out
 military policy, just as it is not withdrawal.
 In this controversy, the real division Is not
 between those who want to withdraw and
 those who., would blast North Vietnam and
 China off the face of the earth,  Our policy
 Is more realistic than either of those.  Our
 policy is to measure and restrain military ac-
 tion, to build for peace, and to stay in South
 Vietnam for years and years no matter how
 long it takes to out-work, to out-educate,
 out-serve, and if necessary, but only if neces-
 sary, to out-fight.  To pay any price.  It has
 been said this is too much * * * this is too
 big a burden * * * we cannot afford it. Our
 responsibilities all over the world are too
 Widespread.
 Can we afford it?  Is It too big a burden?
 The fact is that this Nation has just had
 the biggest tax out in our history, an $11 bil-
 lion tax out.  Can. we afford it?  The defense
 budget is less this year than it was last
 year, and less last year than It was the year
 before.  Can we afford it?  The President
 has just submitted the lowest foreign aid
 program since the beginning of this program
 15 years ago.  Can we afford it?  Bureau of
 Labor Statistics show unemployment is at
 the lowest level in 8 years.  This is the
 greatest prosperity in all of American his-
 tory.  We have never had so much income
 after taxes, even allowing for inflation.  Can
 our will to defend freedom be so feeble that
 this rich country cannot afford a fraction
 of what we spend on cosmetics to stand up
 to communism?  And, of course, military
 and even economic assistance is not enough.
 All the time it is true that we must press
 night and, day for conditions permitting a
 basis for  egotiations that will bring inde-
 pendence.for South Vietnam.
 What has been President Johnson's posi-
 tion  on                        peaceful  negotiations?  I  know
 President Johnson, and I have disagreed
 with him far more than I have disagreed
 with my distinguished colleague, Senator
 Moasg.  Senator MoasE and I both know
 President Johnson well.  He speaks honestly
 and sincerely when he says that he will go
 anywhere at any time, see anyone, If he
 thought it could serve the cause of peace.
 Until very recently there was simply no evi-
 dence that the Communists were Interested
 in negotiating a settlement in Vietnam.
 Before we began to use our power in the
 last .few weeks, the principal foreign offices
 In. the worth said negotiations were impos-
 sible.  The British Foreign Secretary at the
 White House recentiytold the President that
 the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
 had said In London a few, days ago that it
 was useless, to talk about negotiations.  The
 French, who have been the principal agita-
 tors for a pegotiated settlement, now con-
 cede that tl}eir explorations have been fruit-
 less; they have been rebuffed by Hanoi and
 rest of the world?  You do not have to list   ,,  muy Go, Leos, "i. reef that the situation

 aggression.  These people are not just walk-
 ing across the border as clearly and simply
 and obviously as the Hitler march.  This is an
 invisible, subtle, and apparently indigenous
 kind of aggression.  We fall into the trap
 that this is civil war, and wherever this ter-
 rorist Infiltration tactic is developed in the
 future, we will take It to be a civil war.
 These are the types of terror tactics the Com-
 munists have perfected, tactics involving kid-
 naping  of  officials,  deliberate  murder  of
 mayors and leaders of villages, the murder
 of thousands of Vietnam exofficials. If the
 Communists win here, If this kind of action
 can prevail, there is no reason why the Com-
 munists  should  not     use  it  elsewhere-in
 Asia, in Africa, and in South America.
 ,This is a far crueler, tougher war. It seems
 as though we are losing or have. lost. The
 fact is that we can win. The military situa-
 tion Is bad.  I think it is true that this ad-
 ministration  and  the  last         administration
 were very wrong in not telling us the true
 situation about how we were losing in South
 Vietnam. But It is a fact, as every reporter
 I have heard has reported, that morale in
 South Vietnam is now rising.  Not only do
 the Catholics and the business communities
 support our position, but the Buddhists, the
 students, and the labor people are supporting
 recent  developments  in  Vietnam.   Most
 promising of all, now that we have shown
 that we not only have the greatest power in
 the world, but that we have the will to use it,
 North Vietnam seems to be taking d different
 view of negotiation.  The New York Times
 recently reported that diplomats of the non-
 alined countries said privately that North
 Vietnamese officials might be willing to agree
 to a new Geneva conference on Indochina.
 The indications were private-publicly, the
 North Vietnamese officials indicated with-
 drawal of U.S. officials mandatory before ne-
 gotiation.  There were no conditions in the
 private approach:  The British Foreign Sec-
 retary declared that there is more hope of
 negotiation than even a day ago, that there
 has been a change in the attitude of the
 Communists  toward  negotiation.   Mean-
 while, the President maintains the posture,
 *hich he sincerely believes, that this coun-
 try must persist with all Its might to resist
 aggression in South Vietnam, and to de-
 fend freedom there with its military strength.
 But far from being inconsistent, it seems to
 me that the posture the President has as-
 sumed is essential to finally creating peaceful
 negotiations.  This is the same administra-
 tion that has made proposals for economic
 development of all southeast Asia, including
 perhaps  North Vietnam,  in  the event of
 peace.   This  is  the same  administration
 which indicated there would be no direct
 reprisal for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy
 in Saigon, specifically no attack on Hanoi.
 This is the same administration that directed
 Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleve-
 s no precedent.  The precedent of the Gaza
 strip, the precedents of the Congo and Cy-
 prus are terribly different.  This is the same
 administration that had Secretary of State
 Dean Rusk give a respectful reception to the
 proposal of 17 so-called nonalined nations
 that petitioned us to negotiate.  All of this is
 good.  It indicates that we do not have a
 policy of simply pounding away hoping some-
 thing will happen.  We are carrying an olive
 branch in one hand as well as arrows in the
 other. But We have those arrows, and the
 fact is that vinegar is just as essential as
 the oil of peace.  We stand prepared to con-
 tinue bombing if defense requires it.  Not
 only do we have a massive, awesome power,
 but we have the will to use It.  The Presi-
 dent pledged that we will stay In South
 Vietnam for 10 or 20 years, if necessary, to
 stop communism.
 This resolution may be as significant as
 President Truman's resolve in Berlin in 1948,
 in Greece, in Korea, when against criticism
 and under very different circumstances, he
 decided to stand against the Communists.
 It may be as significant as John F. Kennedy's
 resolve in October of 1962, when we discov-
 ered that the Soviet Union had planted mis-
 siles in Cuba.  This resolve, which has been
 so denounced, could stabilize the last great
 front of Communist aggression, and I predict
 that this U.S. persistence in South Vietnam
 will drive Hanoi to the bargaining table.  On
 the  other  hand,  had  President     Johnson
 chosen the withdrawal option, and that is
 the realistic option, peace as well as freedom
 would be in far greater danger throughout
 the world.  He has chosen the tough course,
 the painful course, but the right course.
 You do not need a graduate degree to under-
 stand what, basically, is going on: this is
 aggression. This is the kind of aggression
 the free world, at its terrible regret, failed
 to meet in Austria; and the Sudetenland and
 Manchuria, the kind of aggression that re-
 sulted in the violence and death and the
 agony of 4 long years in World War II.  In
 South Vietnam we are meeting it.  We are
 meeting it with military force, but with re-
 strained force.   We meet it with military
 force at the same time that we're building an
 economically stronger and better future in
 South Vietnam, as I documented.   And, we
 meet it with the olive branch of negotiations
 In the other hand.
 Let us not forget that it was not Lyndon
 Johnson who 4 years ago stepped up our mili-
 tary commitment to South Vietnam.                                                                                                                                        It was
 the same John Fitzgerald Kennedy who gave
 the finest speech on peace of this generation
 at American University in May  1963-the
 same John Kennedy whose greatest monu-
 ment is a test ban treaty that begins the first
 hopeful step toward the control of nuclear
 destruction of the world.  It was the same
 John Kennedy who, however, recognized that
 the price of peace and freedom can some-
 times be cruel and terrible, that there are
 times when We, must face aggression, and

 used.  I have a clipping from today's news-
 paper.  "London, April 1, Colonial Secretary
 4nthony Greenwood told Parliament today
 that British colonial police used nontoxic
 gas 124 times in the last 5 years.',  That
 doesn't make it right, but I imagine that
 tear gas could be used here in Portland.
 You can buy it.  Any police force can have
 it and does use it.  When this gas was used,
 and it Was used on three occasions, it was
 totally ineffective on every single occasion.
 It was used so that it would not be neces-
 sary to use other weapons' that are far
 worse-so that we would not have to use
 napalm, so that we would not have to use
 machine guns, so that we would not have
 to kill people.  Civilians were being used as
 shields, and it was thought necessary to pro-
 vide solve method of saving the lives of
 civilians so it would be possible to step in
 and overpower the others.  Nevertheless, it
 was stupid for one other reason.  In a mili-
 tary situation, you can count on escalation.
 We use a gas that is a tear and nausea gas.
 They-the enemy-use a gas that is a little
 worse; we use gas which is little worse; and
 the first thing you know you have bac-
 teriological warfare-you have mustard gas,
 you have some weapons which, fortunate-
 ly, have not been used since World War I.
 It was a bad mistake, but at the same time,
 I think it should be put in perspective.
 Question.. "Senator MORSE. assuming that
 SEATO and the United States do not want
 to assume the responsibility in southeast
 Asia, should the United States at any time,
 along a unilaterial basis, stand against Com-
 munist aggression in southeast Asia?  If so,
 where do we draw this line?"
 Senator MORSE.  We will not know until we
 take it to the United Nations, first through
 the Security Council, and then to the Gen-
 eral Assembly.  I am satisfied that at least
 85 nations, and probably not more, would
 vote to take jurisdiction if given the oppor-
 tunity to take jurisdiction, because they are
 scared, too.  They know what this great
 threat in Asia means for all the rest of the
 world.  They  know  that  if  you  start  a
 massive war with Red China it will not be
 over for a quarter of a century. I am satis-
 fied, also, that basic in the philosophy of
 many of our military, is the sincere convic-
 tion (but I think-dead wrong from every
 standpoint), that you have got to fight China
 sooner or later, and this is the time to fight
 her.  I am satisfied that we are following
 the course of action of a provocateur, and
 that we are going to step it up until finally
 China makes a misstep.  And when China
 makes the misstep, get ready for the bomb-
 ing of China.  The first target will be the
 nuclear installations, but do not forget, they
 can be rebuilt. .It may take 10, 15, or 20
 years to rebuild them, but when they are
 rebuilt, they will be rebuilt with a vengeance,
 and we will leave a heritage to future genera-,
 tions of American boys and girls of the hatred
 of the Chinese for the next 1,000 years.  That
 is why I want to take my country out of the
 unilateral course of action-that is why I
 want to bring in others to help maintain the
 peace.  China is not going to stop for us,
 but line up 85 to 90 nations around this
 world against her, and in my judgment, she
 will think a long time before she follows a
 course  of  action  of  nonnegotiating  an
 'honqprabPle settlement.
 Ii~e11eve that the fundamental purpose of
 our policy in Asia is to establish an American
 foothold, * * * It goes right back to Dulles
 "wanting France to get out of Indochina, to
 his wanting Great Britain to come in with
 us-back to his refusal to sign the Geneva
 accord of 1954, although he said we would
 .live -,,up to its tenets-and we have violated
 one after another ever since..e.. * +- I cannot
 give you any assurance that, if the U.N. does
 not take jurisdiction, you ' are not going' to
 have very serious trouble in South Vietnam,
 but I will face the ugly question. If we are
 put to the point where we, and we alone,
 are going to have to fight a war in Asia, then
 the first thing we should do is try to work
 out an arrangement where the people would
 not be  massacred.   Then, and only then,
 would I have the United States withdraw, be-
 cause South Vietnam is not in the perimeter
 of America defense.  If we got into a war
 with Russia tomorrow, we would not leave an
 American boy in South Vietnam any longer
 than it took to get him out, because South
 Vietnam is not vital to the United States in
 time of war. *  * * Western nations better
 face up to the fact that Asians are not going
 to allow them to stay in Asia.
 Senator PROXMIRE. The United Nations is
 now paralyzed.  As Senator MORSE said, we
 have to go to the General Assembly.  The As-
 sembly cannot meet until next September.
 We have to draw the line against the Com-
 munists.  We can say, "Take it to the United
 Nations"-I do wish this were a practical
 solution, but the fact is that the U.N. is not
 in session, and will not be in session.  The
 Secretary General has indicated that this
 was a question that was, in his estimation,
 probably too big.   Furthermore, if we try
 to get the United Nations involved on the
 basis of having to take jurisdiction between
 North  Vietnam and the United States  of
 America, there is about as much chance that
 North Vietnam would stand still for that as
 there is that the Oregonian is likely to name
 the Senator from Oregon as mediator in its
 next labor contract.  The fact is that North
 Vietnam was invited to sit in on discussions
 by the Security Council at the time of the
 Tonkin Gulf episode.  North Vietnam was
 urged by the Soviet Union, by the United
 States, and by members of the Security Coun-
 cil.  She flatly refused, and said that she
 would have nothing to do with it, and would
 not be bound by any decision of the Security
 Council.   Under these circumstances, how
 in the world can we get the U.N. involved?
 Question:  "Senator  PROXMIRE,    you said
 that the aggression in South Vietnam is of
 a subtle kind, and is invisible, and I would
 agree with you.  What can Congress do if
 the terroristic attacks against Americans in
 the last few months turn out to be inside jobs
 by those who disagree with the policy of
 restraint that you advocate and the Presi-
 dent hopes to carry on?"
 Senator PROXMIRE, We are acting in North
 Vietnam militarily.  We decided to take overt
 military action very recently.   It has been
 stated over and over again by President John-
 son by Secretary Rusk, by Secretary McNa-
 mars, and others, that we have done so be-
 cause of the infiltration and invasion from
 North Vietnam.  This is not just a pipe-
 dream-this is not a guess.  It is true that
 this is a subtle kind of war, but the fact is
 that the invasion has been documented.  The
 International Control Commission has found
 that  there  has been aggression from the
 north.  They have said so-they have found
 it-it is a fact of life, and this is what we are
 trying to stop.  Furthermore, it is my under-
 standing that the man who planted the bomb
 to blow up the Saigon Embassy admitted that
 he had been paid by the Vietcong to do it.
 .It is true that the evidence, under war cir-
 cumstances, is never the kind of thing that
 one would like to have in court.  However,
 we do know that there is invasion from the
 north, and that is what we are trying to stop.
 Senator MQRst. There is nothing that stops
 the United Nations from being called into
 session from within 1Q to 15 days. Just read
 the charter.  It calls for an extraordinary ses-
 sion of the United Nations, and we ought to
 call for an extraordinary session of the U.N.
 immediately. As to aggression in South Viet-
 nam, within 3 weeks of the filing of the white
 paper, witnesses before the Foreign Relations
 11163
 Committee continued to testify that this was
 primarily a war from witthin in South Viet-
 nam, by South Vietnamese, using American
 weapons.  In recent weeks there have been
 some weapons coming in from the north, but
 there is still no showing of any substantial
 number of North Vietnamese military men
 out  of  the  North  Vietnamese  Army.   Of
 course, there has been some training of South
 Vietnamese up in North Vietnam, but we are
 the last country in the world that ought to
 talk about training soldiers of another coun-
 try.                                                                                                                                         We have been doing it all around the
 world, and we have been doing it in South
 Vietnam for a long time.
 What we do need to face up to is that,
 in South Vietnam, we have been guilty, time
 and time again, of aggression on our part.
 Take the Tonkin Bay incident.   The first
 propaganda of the administration was that
 the American ships were 75 miles from those
 North Vietnamese islands 3 to 6 miles off
 the  coast of North  Vietnam, which  were
 bombed by South Vietnamese vessels-ves-
 sels which we equipped, which moved with
 the full knowledge of our Embassy and Of
 U.S. Navy ships in Tonkin Bay at the time.
 Our administration said they were 75 miles
 away.  Well, if Russia had a destroyer 75
 miles from Key West, for example, and Castro
 sent over a destroyer to bomb Key West, you
 know what we would do to that destroyer
 75 miles away.  We would give it one chance
 to come into port, and if it did not come to
 port, we would sink it, because we would
 know that it was there for a cover.  The 75-
 mile issue blew up in their face, because we-
 the Foreign Relations Committee-got the
 log of the ships, and when the bombing of
 the islands took place, that American vessel
 was within 13 miles of the islands.  That is
 why I say we acted as a provocateur.  Of
 course, our ships were on the high seas, and
 had the right to be where they were, as far
 as the high sea laws were concerned. But,
 we had no right to be there as a cover to
 those South Vietnamese vessels.  Time and
 time again, we have been participants in a
 violation of the borders of Cambodia, of the
 borders of North Vietnam, and, as is usually
 the case when you get into a dirty war, both
 sides play dirty.  We have been playing dirty
 along with the Communists.
 Moderator JONES. In accordance with the
 procedures of debate, each Senator will have
 an opportunity to make a brief summary
 remark.
 Senator PROXMIRE. My good friend Senator
 WAYNE MORSE is a great Senator and a great
 debater, but it seems he has failed to distin-
 guish the difference between our action in
 South Vietnam and that of the North Viet-
 namese.                                                                                                                                       We are there because we were in-
 vited by the duly constituted and recognized
 Government of South Vietnam, a Govern-
 ment that has been recognized by over 100
 nations in the world.  Although there have
 been five successive governments, each one
 has wanted us to stay, and every element in
 this Government today has asked us to stay
 there.  On the other hand, the North Vietna-
 mese are there to subvert that Government,
 to overthrow that Government, to destroy
 that Government.  I think there is all the
 difference in the world on that basis.  Sena-
 tor MORSE has offered us an alternative, but
 what an alternative.  He has said the U.N.
 Charter indicates that we can call the United
 Nations together in 10 or 15 days-but .why
 is the U.N. paralyzed? It is paralyzed because
 the nations cannot vote.  It is paralyzed be-
 cause the problem of the Russian dues to the
 U.N. will not be solved until September.  I
 wish it were not so-I wish we were living in
 a different kind of a world.  Oh, how I wish
 we had an international court of justice, and
 that we could take the Communists to that
 court.  How nice it would be if we could get
 .85 nations to join us in South Vietnam.  But,
 as the Senator from Oregon has pointed out,
 we cannot even get the SEATO nations "to

 join us in South Vietnam. if communism is
 going to be stopped, we have to stop it.
 Finally, the position of the administration in
 this perplexing, complex, and difficult situa-
 tion., is that negotiation, and the will to try
 and hope and pray and work for a peaceful
 solution through negotiation, is important.
 But that is not the only important element.
 When dealing with the Communists, in the
 kind of real world in which they are operat-
 ing, you have to have two other legs to this
 stool, too.  One of those legs is the kind of
 hard, tough, grinding assistance we are devel-
 oping in Vietnam so she can develop her in-
 dependence, so that she can have the seed-
 bed of political freedom.  The third leg, and
 the one that is so hard for Americans who
 live peace to accept,- is that of force and
 power-the force of military muscle and the
 will to use that military muscle.  What the
 administration is doing is to use our military
 force, use our economic ability, and at the
 same time sincerely and honestly work to cre-
 ate a situation in which negotiations will be
 possible, but negotiations that can permit a
 free and independent South Vietnam and
 stop Communist aggression.
 Senator MORSE. When my very close friend
 Senator PROxMIRE talks about our being in-
 vited into South Vietnam by the Government
 of South Vietnam, I would ask him, "Which
 one?"  "When?"  No government has been
 set up by the people of South Vietnam. We
 saw to it that that did not happen in 1956.
 We stopped the government from being set
 up in South Vietnam.  We set up our own
 puppet, and a whole chain of puppets.  Sen-
 ator PROxMIRE says a hundred or so nations
 have recognized that government.  Well, we
 have spent $100 billion now in foreign aid
 to some 100 nations and they are not going
 to offend us very quickly.  I want to say that
 it is pretty difficult for this great power of
 the United States to find very many people
 taking positions that they will not recognize
 a puppet. $ * *  We never have been called
 in by a government of the people of South
 Vietnam. I am for a procedure that will give
 the people of South Vietnam their own gov-
 ernment, not an American-imposed govern-
 ment, which they have had ever since 1954.
 The United Nations is in a position to work.
 Read the charter.  Who is responsible for the
 fact than the U,N. went out of session?  It
 was what Ambassador Stevenson called a
 procedural vote on article 19, the most sub-
 stantive vote that could be cast in that gen-
 eral session.  That is why the students of
 the United Nations are severely criticizing
 the United States for our course of action on
 article 19, and they should criticize.  That is
 why your Senator led the fight in the Senate
 against the policy of our Government, backed
 up by a surprising number of Senators, when
 I said "You should hold the nose of Russia
 and France to the grindstone in the United
 Nations-not let them out of it, and insist
 on a vote on article 19."  But I am talking
 about an extraordinary session of the United
 Nations, an extraordinary session called for
 the nations to carry out their responsibility
 to keep the peace.  I have no doubt what the
 General Assembly would do if reconvened, if
 there was any hope of maintaining the peace
 by the United Nations sending whetever
 number of divisions of the U.N. troops neces-
 sary to enforce the peace in southeast Asia.
 They would quickly waive any obligations
 regarding any money if they could get this
 matter decided; then they could go back to
 the debate on article 19.
 :1 did not come here, and Senator PROxMIRE
 did not come here, to ask for agreement.  We
 came believing that what is needed in this
 country on this critical issue is the thought
 of the American people-to get the American
 people away from their dogmas and their
 slogans. Remember, you, too, have a respon-
 sibility of statesmanship.  Yours is the re-
 sponsibility of citizen-statesmanship. Never
 forget that foreign policy under our constitu-
 tion does not belong to the President of the
 United States.  That is one of the myths or
 bubbles that needs to be burst.   Foreign
 policy belongs to you, the people.    The
 President is the administrator of the people's
 foreign policy, subject to the checks of Con-
 gress.  We now have to think about American
 bQys and girls 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 years
 from now.  It is my deep conviction that
 if we follow this course, we will never leave
 a heritage of freedom to our grandchildren.
 Moderator  JONES. Thank  you,  Senator
 MORSE, and particularly for that final word.
 It has been our privilege to listen to a discus-
 sion of truly historic proportions this eve-
 ning, for which we thank both of our guests
 very warmly.
 SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENT TO THE
 VOTING RIGHTS BILL
 (Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
 mission to address the House for 1 min-
 ute, to revise and extend his remarks
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, last Thurs-
 day the Senate adopted a most signifi-
 cant amendment to the voting rights
 bill. The amendment, sponsored by Sen-
 ator KENNEDY of New York. will enfran-
 chise thousands of Spanish speaking
 citizens.   Senator ROBERT KENNEDY de-
 serves the gratitude of all those dedi-
 cated to equality in voting for directing
 his great abilities to the passage of this
 amendment.
 This amendment would prohibit the
 denial of the right to vote in any elec-
 tion of any person because of his inabil-
 ity to read, write, or understand English
 if he has successfully completed the sixth
 grade in a public or accredited private
 school in any State, territory, the District
 of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of
 Puerto Rico in which the predominant
 classroom language was other than Eng-
 lish.
 The amendment provides:
 No person who demonstrates that he has
 successfully  completed  the  sixth  primary
 grade in a public school in, or a private
 school accredited by, any State or territory,
 the District of Columbia, or the Common-
 wealth of Pirerto Rico in which the predomi-
 nant classroom language was other than Eng-
 lish, shall be denied the right to vote in any
 Federal. State, or local election because of
 his inability to read, write, understand, or
 interpret any matter in the English language,
 except that in states in which State law
 provides that a different level of education
 is presumptive of literacy, he shall demon-
 strate that he has successfully completed
 an equivalent level of education in a public
 school in, or a private school accredited by,
 any State or territory, the District of Colum-
 bia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in
 which the predominant classroom language
 was other than English.
 Mr. Speaker, Congress certainly has
 the power to pass this literacy test
 amendment  under  the  enforcement
 clauses of the 14th and 15th amend-
 ments.
 The 14th amendment to the Constitu-
 tion guarantees that no State shall "deny
 to any person within its jurisdiction the
 equal protection of the laws."  In New
 York State thousands of American citi-
 zens have been denied the equal protec-
 tion of the laws.
 New York State requires a prospective
 voter to take an English language liter-
 acy test or to establish his literacy by
 showing an eighth grade education at a
 school conducted in English.  As a result
 of this requirement thousands of Amer-
 ican citizens of Puerto Rican origin do
 not register to vote.         Senator ROBERT
 KENNEDY estimated that there are ap-
 proximately 7:30,000 Puerto Ricans in
 New York, of whom approximately 480,-
 000 are of voting age.                                                                                                   Less than one-
 third-about 150,000 are registered to
 vote.  While it cannot be said that all
 the other 330,000 are not registered be-
 cause of the literacy test, there is no
 doubt that a substantial number do not
 register for this reason.
 The New Yorker of Puerto Rican origin
 has every opportunity to be as well in-
 formed a voter as his English-speaking
 neighbor.  There are Spanish-language
 newspapers, televisions, and radio.  The
 schools in Puerto Rico teach civics and
 American history. The English-language
 literacy test is an arbitrary requirement
 for voting and should be abolished.
 I have sponsored legislation through-
 out my service in Congress to abolish the
 literacy test completely. In this Congress
 my bill to eliminate the literacy test is
 H.R. 2477.  I testified at length before
 the House Committee on the Judiciary on
 this question. I believe the least we can
 do in this session is to adopt the literacy
 test amendment sponsored by Senator
 KENNEDY of New York.
 Unfortunately, this amendment is not
 included in the voting rights bill which
 has been reported out by the House. In
 view of the action taken by the other
 body, I hope the House will adopt it, and
 I urge the distinguished Chairman of the
 Committee on the Judiciary to accept the
 amendment when the voting rights bill
 is on the floor. I urge all my colleagues
 to join with me in this fight to bring full
 rights of citizenship to thousands of
 Americans who speak Spanish.

 HOn. CHARLES E. CHAMBERLAIN,
 Houle of Representatives,
 Congress of the United States,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  CONGRESSMAN  CHAMBERLAIN:  Your
 letter of May 22 arrived while I was away
 from the office and I understand our Wash-
 ington office indicated to you in my absence
 that this reply would be forthcoming soon.
 We were pleased to learn from your letter
 that you will be continuing your efforts to
 reduce or repeal the discriminatory 10-per-
 cent excise tax on automobiles.
 You asked in your letter if the present
 position of Ford Motor Co. continues to be
 the same as in the past on the subject of
 passing on any reduction in the excise tax
 to its dealers.
 In response to similar inquiries in 1958, I
 stated that our company would immediately
 pass on to our dealers the full amount of any
 reduction in the excise tax.  That is still
 our  position.  The  suggested retail  price
 shown on the price label would also be low-
 ered by the amount that the excise is re-
 duced.  We have no doubt that competition
 for the consumer's dollar would insure that
 our dealers, in turn, would pass a reduction
 on  to their  customers.  You  realize,  of
 course, that the company has no authority
 to commit what the dealers' decision on this
 matter would be, however.
 Thank you for your efforts over the years
 in support of reduction or elimination of
 .the passenger car excise tax.
 Very sincerely,
 HENRY FORD II,
 Chairman.

 Hon. CHARLES E. CHAMBERLAIN,

 Washington, D.C.
 MY  DEAR  CONGRESSMAN:  Thank  you  for
 your letter of May 22 concerning my views
 on whether the removal or reduction of the
 present 10-percent excise tax on new auto-
 mobiles would be passed along to the cus-
 tomer by the automobile companies.
 As you know, our new passenger cars are
 sold by General Motors to franchised dealers
 who, in turn, sell to the customer.  The price
 at which this final sale is made is one that
 is agreed to by the dealer and the customer.
 The manufacturer is not a party to this
 transaction and of course the dealer is' free
 to sell at any price agreed to with the cus-
 tomer.
 passenger cars should be reflected in lower
 prices to the new car buyer."
 I am enclosing a copy of the full AMA
 statement from which  this quotation is
 taken.  You will note that the association
 is proposing that Congress not extend the
 3-percent increase in the excise tax author-
 ized in connection with the Korean wartime
 emergency, and is further urging affirmative
 congressional action to reduce or eliminate
 the remaining 7 percent of this discrimina-
 tory excise tax.  In order to minimize the
 disruption of the market during the period
 such a reduction is under review by the Con-
 gress, the association is ouggesting that pro-
 vision be made in current tax legislation for
 the retroactive application of the reduction
 to the date hearings begin on specific legis-
 lation.
 I very much appreciate your continued
 active interest in removing this discrimina-
 tory excise tax.  I hope you will feel free to
 call on me at any time that I may be of
 assistance in this matter.
 Very truly yours,
 JOHN F. GORIIk~ON,

 White House,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:  You have received or
 will soon receive a letter from the Clergy-
 man's Emergency Committee for Vietnam of
 the Fellowship of Reconciliation.  This letter
 has been circulated among American clergy-
 men to gain their signatures of support.  The
 letter will petition you to seek a peaceful
 solution to the Vietnam crisis at all costs.
 As a Christian clergyman and citizen I
 oppose this letter for three reasons. First,
 it vastly oversimplifies a complex cultural,
 political, and military problem.  Second, it
 perfect and not always most just, but this
 does not obligate us to surrender to com-
 munism nor to trust it.
 Yes, I am dismayed by the war in Vietnam
 (and in Congo and elsewhere) and I long for
 peace, but to betray ourselves or allies into
 Communist tyranny and designs will bring
 neither peace, nor freedom, nor honor, nor
 godliness.  Only Jesus Christ can bring last-
 ing personal, social, or world peace, He "Who
 is coming in power and great glory."
 Yours truly,
 PATRICK MORISON.

 THE PEGASUS B
 (Mr. MILLER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. MILLER.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to
 report another major success on the part
 of the National Aeronautics and Space
 Administration in the exploration and
 conquest of space.  At 3:35 this morning
 the Saturn booster placed into orbit the
 Pegasus B meteoroid technology satel-
 lite.                                                                                            This is the ninth straight success
 of the most powerful operational launch
 vehicle  in the  world,  a remarkable
 achievement that bodes well for the fu-
 ture of our entire space program.,
 The Pegasus satellite exposes more
 than 2,000 square feet of instrumented
 panels to register meteoriod impacts in
 the region near the earth.  The 3,200-
 pound spacecraft, attached to the last
 stage of the Saturn, is in an orbit with
 a predicted lifetime of over 3 years-
 the instruments are designed to operate
 for about 1 year.  The achieved orbit
 with an apogee of 740 kilometers and
 perigee of 513 kilometers, is within
 1  percent  of  the planned  values-
 an example of the Nation's increasing
 capability for high-precision space oper-
 ations. The total weight in orbit is over
 23,000 pounds, making it one of our
 heaviest successful payloads.
 The information we will receive from-
 this mission will be important to our
 total capability for operations in space,
 both manned and unmanned.
 The actual deployment in space of 100-
 foot panels was televised by a camera
 mounted on the booster; I am sure many
 of you will see it before long on your
 own TV sets.
 Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the
 National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
 istration and the industrial and scientific
 team responsible for this mission for
 another step forward in the power and
 prestige of the United States.
 Since preparing these remarks, I have
 been informed that throughout the day
 the three television networks will show
 pictures of the Pegasus B.

 RECORD   and   to include   extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, I today
 asked the Federal Trade Commission to
 determine whether the prices of cotton
 textiles are being fixed in restraint of
 trade.
 The trend of cloth prices and textile
 mill margins has been so peculiar since
 the enactment of last year's cotton legis-
 lation that a thorough inquiry is in the
 public interest.
 Text of my letter to the Commission:
 The trend of cloth prices and cotton mill
 margins since the enactment of the one-price
 cotton legislation of last year is so peculiar
 that I strongly urge that you make an in-
 vestigation to determine whether the prices
 of cotton textiles are being fixed in restraint
 of trade.
 The statistics enclosed herewith, provided
 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, show
 a steady upward trend in cloth prices despite
 the drop In cost of raw cotton made possible
 by last year's legislation.  You will note that
 mill margins jumped sharply when the lower-
 cost cotton became available.  There is no
 indication that consumers have benefited
 from this legislation, despite official assur-
 ances Congress received last year that it
 would save them more than $700 million.
 Clearly, cloth prices have not responded
 to substantially lower raw material costs.
 This of course does not necessarily mean
 that a conspiracy to fix prices exists, but It
 is highly unusual in a supposedly competitive
 industry.  Consequently, it seems to me that
 a thorough inquiry would be in the public
 interest.
 I enclose herewith:
 1. A table showing cloth and raw cotton
 prices and mill margins by months begin-
 ning with 1962, together with a chart reflect-
 ing these same statistics.
 2. A copy of a letter dated January 31,
 1964, from the Secretary of Commerce to the
 chairman of the Senate Committee on Agri-
 culture and Forestry giving assurances to the
 Congress that the proposed cotton legislation
 would save consumers more than $700 mil-
 lion.
 This has special interest for me because
 I ain a member of the Cotton Subcommittee
 of the House Agriculture Committee, We will
 soon be considering a revision of the present
 legislation.

 ments I enclosed:

 THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE,

 Hon. ALLEN J. ELLENDER,
 Chairman, Committee on Agriculture and
 Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: It is my understand-
 ing that during the course of your current
 hearings on the need for emergency cotton
 legislation, the question continues to arise
 as to whether or not a reduction of 81/s cents
 per pound in the cost of cotton to domestic
 mills would be reflected in savings to Amer-
 ican consumers of cotton textile products.
 When similar legislation was being considered
 by the House Committee on Agriculture,
 Hickman Price, Jr., then Assistant Secretary
 of Commerce, testified in behalf of this De-
 partment that savings to consumers would
 amount to about $90 million for each cent
 of reduction.  A reduction of 81/2 cents per
 MIZE QUESTIONS BILL "RIDERS"
 (Mr. MIZE (at the request of Mr.
 QUILLEN) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)  -
 Mr. MIZE.  Mr. Speaker, it has been
 my privilege to appear before the Joint
 Committee on the Organization of Con-
 gress to express my concern about the use
 of omnibus bills.  Often these bills com-
 bine new concepts with established pro-
 grams and thus bring into being a new
 area of Government spending which
 probably would not be authorized if the
 new concept was presented as an in-
 dividual bill.
 I have had a bill drafted which I plan
 to introduce to ban bills and amend-
 ments dealing with more than one sub-
 stantive matter.  I realize that this is
 a far-reaching reform, but the reception
 I had before the joint committee indi-
 cates to me that many other Members
 share my same concerns about the
 abuses in omnibus bills.
 During the time that this proposal was
 in the talking stage as far as my office
 is concerned, the Topeka (Kans.) State
 Journal editorialized in favor of this ap-
 proach.
 I appreciate this support by one of the
 leading and influential dailies in Kansas,
 and under leave to extend my remarks,
 I include the editorial, "MIZE Questions
 Bill Riders," in the RECORD:
 Mhos QuE5TIONS BILL RIDERS
 Representative CHESTER MIZE, Republican,
 of Kansas, is on the right track in question-
 ing the fairness and feasibility of omnibus
 bills and in starting a movement to limit
 each bill considered in Congress to one sub-
 stantive matter.
 MIZE said this week he has asked that a.
 resolution to that effect be drafted while he
 conducts research to see if such an approach
 to legislation would be feasible.  If it is, he
 said, he hopes someone in the Senate will
 join him in introducing the measure.
 In  question  are  two  types      of  bills--
 omnibus bills and bills onto which riders
 are attached.
 An omnibus bill is one which makes a
 number of miscellaneous provisions or ap-
 propriations.  The other type usually con-
 tains fewer provisions but can be even more
 deceptive than the omnibus bill.
 Granted, these types of bills have at times
 served worthwhile purposes by making it
 possible to enact necessary legislation when
 it was too late, or for some other reason it
 was impossible, to do it any other way.  But
 often, Miss believes, they have served    as
 expedients to slip through measures which
 likely would have been killed if they had
 received the undivided, unclouded attention
 of Congress.
 An example of what he is talking about,
 MIZE said, was the recent education bill,
 "where the new expanded idea of Federal
 assistance to public school students and in-
 direct aid to nonpublic schools was tied to
 the existing programs of aid to impacted
 areas.            ,
 "We saw it in medicare, where compulsory
 hospital and medical care for the aged was
 pound would thus result in a saving to con-
 sumers of more than $700 million.
 This saving, Mr. Price said, would come
 with a lag of from 3 to 8 months, the time
 from first consumption at the mill to ulti-
 mate consumer, and would be reflected in
 either lower prices or higher quality of the
 merchandise.
 Speaking with personal knowledge from
 many years in the manufacturing and mar-
 keting of cotton textiles, I agree that such a
 raw material cost reduction in the highly
 Competitive tetxile and apparel manufac-
 turing industries  would generate a chain
 reaction of savings to consumers.  It is the
 best estimate of our Department that these
 savings would be of the general order of
 magnitude indicated by Mr. Price.
 Sincerely yours,
 LUTHER H. HODGES,
 Secretary of Commerce.

 A Blessed Event
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM
 OF NEBIRASKA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. CUNNINGIjAM,  Mr. Speaker, as
 a longtime advocate of an. improved
 mail service for our country, I was
 pleased to-learn- that plans have been
 approved for a congressional investiga-
 tion into the Post Office Department's
 sectional plan for mail processing and
 the effect it will have on employees and
 mail service.
 The sectional center concept, which
 will lead to the elimination of many of
 the railway post offices, is not the an-
 swer to improved service in my opinion.
 I am not alone in this opinion and would
 like to call to the attention of my col-
 leagues an editorial which appeared in
 the Bennett County Booster II, Martin,
 S. Dak,, on May 13, 1965:
 A BLESSED EVENT
 People  in          western South Dakota were
 blessed Monday, April 26, with their first
 installment of "Progressive Postal Service."
 For the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar
 with the term, it is a fancy name for bureau-
 cratic bungling.
 It seemed as though the Metro mail serv-
 ice, which was established a few years ago,
 was doing a pretty good job of getting mail
 .in and out of area post offices with a reason-
 able amount of service.  That's probably what
 was wrong.
 Somewhere,  someone got  the  idea that
 mail forwarded to sectional centers could be
 handled in greater volume and faster than
 through the local area post offices. This plan
 has been tried in other areas prior to coming
 to western South Dakota, and apparently is
 achieving about the same results.
 One of these sectional centers has been
 established at Pierre.  And as of April 26,
 all mail in this area is to be routed to this
 sectional center.
 As a result mail going from Martin to Pine
 Ridge can no longer go the 45 miles over
 U.S. Highway 18.  It is to be sent from Mar-
 tin to Kadoka, to Pierre, to Presho, to Rapid
 City, to Hot Springs and back east, again,
 to  Pine Ridge-a distance  of  at  least. 500
 miles.  Also, mail returning from Pine Ridge
 to Martin goes back around the same route,
 instead. Of coming across U.S. Highway 18.
 .Somg,.ow, mail service between Martin
 frond Plilellidge isn't quite as good as it was
 prior tp April 26, 1965.
 In orde;. to test this new modernized serv-
 iee, press time at the Booster, was moved
 ahead in time to catch the 5 ~p.m. mail
 Wednesday out of the post office at Martin.
 Copies of the Booster now have been getting
 to Pine Ridge Friday morning where as they
 previously got there Thursday morning.
 This is not an isolated example.
 Prior to  the change,  a letter  could be
 mailed at 5 p.m. at Kadoka and it would be
 placed the next morning on the Kadoka truck
 arriving at Martin at 6:30 a.m.  Now, before
 the letter can get on that truck, it must first
 go into Pierre, back to Presho and back to
 Kadoka to get on that same truck.
 ., The sectional center idea has hit other
 areas of the country, too.  The Pioneer Press
 of Mott, N. Dak., points out:
 "The Bismarck mail  bus stops  at Burt
 now and we get all our mail from Dickinson
 post office.  In the past, the Bismarck mail
 bus came to Mott and laid over until evening.
 Not true now-the Dickinson bus picks up
 our mail, hauls it to Dickinson  (85 miles)
 then it goes by train to Bismarck (102 miles)
 then it is loaded on a bus and hauled to
 towns east of Mott, to Burt (95 miles).  The
 point is: Burt is 8 miles east of Mott."
 The trouble with the postal service, says,
 the head of the General Accounting Office,
 Is too much modernizing.
 The mail flo system is one example cited
 by GAO.  Under mail flo letters and packages
 were supposed to flit through big city post
 offices virtually untouched by human hands.
 The trouble was, said Comptroller General
 Joseph Campbell, it didn't work.
 But before finding out that the pilot ex-
 periment in Detroit had serious deficiencies,
 Mail-Flo was installed in Philadelphia and
 Denver, where it increased the costs of postal
 service by hundreds of thousands of dollars
 and decreased labor productivity.
 Why should adequate service at reasonable
 cost be an impossible job for the Post Office
 Department?
 Public utilities solve the problem of in-
 creasingly complex operations to serve an
 expanding population.  The Post Office does
 not.
 Utilities,  whether  publicly  or  privately
 owned,  give adequate service at lower or
 stabilized rates as their customers increase.
 The Post Office does not.
 Utilities put money aside     for   improve-
 ment,  and most privately                                                                                   owned  utilities
 manage to pay dividends to their      stock-
 holders.  The Post Office does neither.
 Why, we repeat, can't the Post Office do
 its job?
 The fault cannot be blamed on the 500,000
 men and women-our friends and neighbors
 and fellow citizens-who deliver the mail.
 It has to lie at the very top where decisions
 are made.  And we wonder just how bad the
 postal service has to get before the public
 stops bawling out the people behind the post
 office window, and starts directing its anger
 at the fumblers in Washington.

 fore the Declaration of Independence, the
 people of Roxborough, Manayunk, and
 Wissahickon have preserved a commu-
 nity as unique as the one that saw the
 British march up the ridge early in the
 morning of May 20, 1778.
 Although the little village of Rox-
 borough, which once consisted of a few
 houses scattered down the road, is now
 fully grown, one can still see signposts of
 the past.  For instance, Roxborough is
 one community where you can still see a
 horse on the street.  Many riding stables
 serve patrons who like to gallop up and
 down the trails of the Wissahickon.
 It is true that there are now more
 houses and people in the community,
 which was once known as Roxborough
 Township.   There  are  also  more
 churches and schools. Television, auto-
 mobiles, and the Schuylkill Expressway
 have brought a new era to the formerly
 isolated ridge of land between Wissa-
 hickon Creek and the Schulykill River.
 Yet the 21st ward is still an exciting
 place.  Although concrete has covered
 the fields and pastureland, and shopping
 centers and parking lots have come to
 the vales and valleys of Roxborough,
 Shawmont, and Wissahickon, the un-
 usual loyalty of the people of the 21st
 ward for their community is one signpost
 of the past that will never come down.
 The Intellectual and Vietnam
 HON. EL MO A. CEDERBERG
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. CEDERBERG.  Mr. Speaker, this
 country is witnessing a new development
 in the arena of higher education.  Al-
 though it is not listed in the catalogs of
 some of our leading colleges and univer-
 sities, and neither is it listed in the calen-
 dar of sporting events of these schools,
 a clique of professors have; invented
 teach-ins.  The goal of these is to at-
 tempt to persuade anyone willing to lis-
 ten that this country, in its efforts to
 stay the advance of communism in Viet-
 nam, has gotten off its course.
 Stewart Alsop, writing in the Saturday
 Evening Post, says:
 It is mysterious that so many American
 intellectuals  look  forward  with  compla-
 cency-even positive relish-to Communist
 victory  in    Asia, which  they  regard as
 inevitable.
 Mr. Alsop makes a good presentation
 of this new development in his article
 which follows:
 THE INTELLECTUALS AND VIETNAM
 WASHINGTON.-The  war  in  Vietnam has
 brought to the surface again a mysterious
 phenomenon.  This is the. Peculiar fatuous-
 ness which the profoundly antiintellectual
 Communist system seems to inspire in a good
 many American intellectuals and would-be
 intellectuals.
 At  least  until  1948,  it was fashionable
 among many intellectuals to admire, or find
 excuses for, the system presided over by that
 ferocious enemy of the free intellect, Joseph
 A2620

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX          May 25, 1965
 Stalin. This fatuousness of an older genera-
 tion of intellectuals provided useful ammu-
 nition for the homegrown antiintellectual
 yahoos, like Senator Joseph McCarthy. Now-
 adays it is becoming fashionable to proclaim
 that Mao Tse-tung's version of communism
 is the wave of the future in Asia, and to
 castigate the American Government for its
 blind refusal to permit the future's wave
 to roll over South Vietnam.
 From Berkeley to Harvard, the chic thing
 for the politically aware professor to do is
 to conduct teach-ins on the iniquities of
 American  imperialism  in  Vietnam,  or  to
 march in protest demonstrations, or, for the
 less dashing, to sign open  letters to the
 President, like  the  remarkably  silly open
 letter of protest recently signed by 149 Yale
 professors.
 Surely    this  is  a  mysterious  business.
 Logically, liberal-minded intellectual persons
 should hate and fear Mao's communism as
 instinctively as they hated and feared Hit-
 ler's nazism.                    For as an idea killer, an ene-
 my of the free mind, Mao outdoes Hitler and
 Stalin combined.
 The anti-intellectual campaign in Com-
 munist China, which began in earnest in
 1963, is now reaching a peak of Intensity.
 Chinese  intellectuals  have  been  bluntly
 warned that they are suspect, not only indi-
 vidually, but as a class.  Some months ago
 Hu Yao-pang, secretary of the Communist
 Youth League, announced that "intellectuals
 always belong to certain social classes and
 serve the interests of these classes."
 Warnings to  intellectuals are now con-
 stantly reiterated in the Communist press.
 In January of this year, for example, Red
 Flag,  the  Chinese  Communist  theoretical
 journal, thundered against "intellectuals who
 refuse thought reform, refuse to integrate
 with the masses, and become 'spiritual aristo-
 crats' perched proudly high above the toiling
 masses."
 According to a leading Government expert
 on. Communist China, the idea that Mao
 wants above all to kill is "the concept of
 humanism-i.e.,  the fraternity  of people
 human dignity, happiness, and individual-
 ism."  Humanism has become a respectable
 concept among Soviet intellectuals since the
 post-Stalin thaw.  Therefore Tse-tung is de-
 termined to "wall off Chinese intellectuals
 from any contact with currents of relative
 moderation in the Soviet bloc," and the whole
 concept of humanism is now denounced in
 China as a bourgeois distortion of Marxism-
 Leninism.
 The attack on humanism has its super-
 ficially amusing aspects.  For example,
 Ma Yen-sheng, of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences, recently published  a long letter
 of  abject  "self-criticism." Professor Ma
 wrote that he had found himself of late in-
 creasingly filled with bourgeois sentiments.
 He began to have strange notions about the
 idea of universal love, and even to dream
 of a world filled with friendly love,  and
 forever at peace.  Thus was his mind in-
 creasingly  infected                      with  bourgeois  senti-
 ments.
 And how did the infection start?   Largely
 as a result of listening to the degenerate,
 Western, bourgeois work, Beethoven's Ninth
 Symphony.
 A fondess for bourgeois music is deeply
 suspect, and instantly marks an intellectual
 as a candidate for a "mental-reform-through-
 labor camp."  Debussy, against whose music
 Mao is said to have conceived a particularly
 violent prejudice, is -even more dangerous
 than  Beethoven. The  periodical  Peoples'
 Music recently  anounced  that the   music
 of the Chinese patriotic oratorio, "The Long
 March," had been completely rewritten be-
 cause in its original form it recalled De-
 bussy's degenerate bourgeois style.
 Writers must be especially waxy of the
 taint of bourgeois influence and humanism.
 The Chinese Journal of Literature and Art
 has warned writers that the "writing of mid-
 dle-character stores" is proof of such taint.
 A middle character is someone not perfect
 and not totally bad. In Chinese Communist
 literature, middle  characters  (i.e., human
 beings) no longer exist.  All characters must
 be either perfect toilers and peasants, or
 wholly evil class enemies.
 In last October's issue of China Youth
 Daily, the following sharp warning to a lead-
 ing  Communist  Chinese  philosopher  ap-
 peared: "The kind of life advocated by Com-
 rade Feng Ting, which would provide good
 things to eat and wear, good places to live
 d
 in, and cordial relations between husban
 and wife and between parents and children
 does not accord with the Communist ideal."
 On the contrary, the Communist ideal de-
 mands that the youth of China make a class
 analysis of their parents, granparents, aunts,
 uncles  and  other  relations.  Deviationist
 ideas are to be reported immediately to the
 local block officer or farm party secretary.
 Even. jokes may smack of deviation-a Pei-
 ping newspaper warns that some jokes savor
 strongly of feudalism and capitalism.
 Nor are the dead immune.  China Youth
 tells its readers that "we should make a class
 analysis of there who have died."   Such a
 class analysis seems likely to lead to the re-
 moval of the famous and beautiful tombs of
 Eugene H. Breitenberg, U.S. Army, re-
 tired, who served as Department of De-
 fense Civil War Liaison Officer to the
 National Civil War Centennial Commis-
 sion. Captain Breitenberg is now a mem-
 ber of the faculty of the Annandale, Va.,
 High School.
 A taped message from former Presi-
 dent Dwight D. Eisenhower was included
 in the presentation, which was entitled
 "The Character of Lee."
 In view of the national scope of the an-
 niversary observance, I think this trib-
 ute to a great American should be made
 a part of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  I
 ask unanimous consent for its publica-
 tion in the Appendix.
 The presentation was made by Cap-
 tain  Breitenberg,  on  April 9,                                                                                                                                  1965,
 before the principal, the faculty, and
 the students of Robert E. Lee High
 School.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE CHARACTER OF LEE
 It is a distinct honor to be privileged to
 speak to you and especially so on this day,
 the 100th anniversary of the meeting of Gen.
 Robert E. Lee and Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
 in the McLean house near present day Ap-
 pomattox, Va.   The surrender  of General _
 Lee's  army  of northern  Virginia,  for  all
 practical purposes, ended a war that had
 pitted father against son, brother   against
 brother, American against American.
 it would seem most apropos to the oc-
 casion, consistent with a Presidential procla-
 mation and a public law, if we took stock
 for a few minutes of the character of Robert
 E. Lee, especially in light of the fact that
 this school, your school, is named after that
 illustrious  gentleman,  soldier  and  noble
 American. ,
 Sir Winston Churchill, proclaimed already
 by many historians as the one most likely to
 be honored as "man of the 20th century,"
 had this to say of Robert E. Lee in book 11,
 chapter  10 of "A History of the  English
 Speaking Peoples": he was "* * * one of the
 noblest Americans who ever lived, and one
 of the greatest captains known to the annals
 of war."
 Such is the esteem in which Robert E. Lee
 is held by practically all historians.  Such
 esteem is further enhanced in the thousands
 of books written about the Civil War period
 and by the men who fought in that so called
 "irrepressible conflict."   Said Churchill of
 the Civil War "* * * the noblest and least
 avoidable  of  all the  great mass  conflicts
 fought up to that time."
 During my tour of duty as Department of
 Defense Civil War Centennial Liaison Officer
 to the National Civil War Centennial Com-
 mission, with the primary duty of coordinat-
 ing Armed Forces participation in centennial
 commemorative events, I often was asked to
 speak to military, civic, school and other
 groups.  It occurred to me that my talks
 would be more meaningful if the proclama-
 tion could be heard in the President's own
 voice, rather than quoted.   Accordingly, I
 requested and received the following taped
 message from former President Dwight I).
 Eisenhower:
 "The years 1961-65 will mark the 100th
 anniversary of the American Civil War.
 Hangehow.  For these tombs "are the graves
 of poets, scholars, and courtesans, and are
 therefore * * *  serving merely the purpose
 of spreading the foul odor of the reactionary
 ruling classes * * * and must be removed."
 How is one to avoid being sent to a "Men-
 tal-Reform-Through-Labor Camp" as a re-
 sult of a negative class analysis?  Very sim-
 ple:
 "[We must] use the thought of Mao Tse-
 tung to analyze * * * events.. If they cor-
 respond with the thought of Mao Tse-tung,
 they are right.  We must support, believe,
 praise them.  If not, they are wrong * * *
 we must expose and attack them."  George
 Orwell's big brother asked for no more total
 an abdication of man's right to think for
 himself.
 Perhaps the "Thought of Mao Tse-tung"
 is indeed the wave of the future in Asia,
 and the American effort to Contain Asian
 communism is therefore futile, as such intel-
 lectuals  as Dr. Hans  Morgenthau  preach.
 But it does seem mysterious that so many
 American  intellectuals  look  forward with
 complacency-even     positive  relish-to the
 Communist victory in Asia, which they re-
 gard as inevitable.                                                                          For they are looking for-
 ward, of course, to the rapid spread of a
 system which means the murder of the free
 mind.

 meats that are needed to keep a normal,
 healthy household functioning, but there is
 never 'a note pf fear in their voices.
 When we are in school, we are taught to
 observe the rules, of silence for the sake of
 an orderly system, and not in fear, of what
 might have been said.  Our subjects of his-
 tory, . languages, and mathematics are not
 colored by propaganda to make America
 seem always right.  We are taught to admit
 our mistakes, and we are taught to correct
 them,
 Each afternoon I come home from.sohool
 and enter the house to find my baby sister
 happily playing, and my mother busy with
 household chores.  Dad is out working to
 support his family, in his own chosen field
 of work.  My older sister's career will be her
 choice, not the state's, When she decides to
 marry, her marriage will be made for her
 happiness, and the license will be the only
 legal paper provided and needed.  My brother
 speaks of becoming an electronics engineer.
 If, as he grows older, some other .field will
 lure him, only his talents and ambitions will
 have to be considered.  My little sisters, liv-
 ing in _ their child's world of, coiWoxt and
 happiness, are too little to realize their ad-
 vantage of being American children.  They
 will grow in the love of their. parents, not in
 the paid lgve of a state nursery school
 teacher.
 In the evening, when my father reads the
 newspaper, the facts in the articles are writ-
 ten as they happen,, not as the state would
 like them to happen.  As in almost every
 American home, the family is drawn to the
 TV set.  Programs are selected for the fam-
 ily's enjoyment.  Some evenings the choice
 involves a rather heated family discussion.
 However, when the program is finally chosen,
 we know that it is governed by the manu-
 facturer of perhaps a famous soap product,
 and not a ministry of propaganda.  And
 when, at times, the family decides to go out
 for entertainment, we choose our own place,
 and time for return is not governed by a
 set curfew.
 In -attempting to show what my country
 means to me,. I have expressed in words the
 freedom in my -everyday life.  It is the same
 freedom every American experiences, and we
 must fight to keep, so that every future
 American will experience it.
 Tabulation of Results of a Questionnaire
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. JACK EDWARDS
 Or ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May ?,5, 1965
 Mr. EDWARDS  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, we have just completed an ex-
 periment in the First Congressional Dis-
 trict of Alabama in order to learn more
 about the opinions of the district's cit-
 izens regarding important national and
 international issues of the day.
 A2627
 We have been overwhelmed by the tre-
 mendous number of persons who took
 the time to respond to a written ques-
 tionnaire which we mailed to every home
 in the district.  More than 16,000 per-
 sons responded.
 This is a great tribute to the First Dis-
 trict because it shows that our people
 want to make their ideas on important
 issues known to their elected representa-
 tive in Congress.
 In order that representative govern-
 ment can be effective it is important that
 elected officials know the views of the
 voters.  This is one way that I can be in-
 formed as I proceed to serve the First
 District.
 I want to call particular attention to
 2 of the 10 issues raised in the ques-
 tionnaire.  Of those responding to the
 questionnaire fully 86.2 percent oppose
 President Johnson's proposal to repeal
 section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act
 and thus they favor continuing the State
 authority to enact right-to-work laws.
 On the other hand, 73.5 percent of
 those responding believe that our na-
 tional security is at stake in the conflict
 in Vietnam, giving support to the admin-
 istration in its determination to help
 South Vietnam resist outside aggression
 from the north.
 Following is the complete tabulation
 of results of the questionnaire:

 The Presidenes, Position on the IV ietnam
 Situation
 HON. WILLIAM A. BARRETT
 or PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HQUSE.OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, may 25, 1965
 Mr. BARR9TT.   Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to extend my, remarks in the REC-
 ORD, I include the two following- articles
 on the President's position on the Viet-
 nam situation,
 Both editorials are excellent and again
 demonstrates Mr. Johnson's humanitar-
 ianism and leadership.
 [From The  Philadelphia  (Pa.)  Inquirer,
 May 14, 1965]
 JoHNSON's.yT5ATEGY IN ASIA.
 Pgesidel;t j..phnson;s televised address from
 the White Ifoz3.se.,Thursday had a ring of
 similarity to other Speeches he has given
 recently, on the subject of Vietnam, but
 there were notable, and significant differ-
 ences.
 Heretofore, the President had discussed
 southeast Asialrom the standpoint of Amer-
 ican policy.  On Thursday he talked mostly
 not of policy but of strategy.
 He did reiterate, it is true, the basic U.S.
 policy of defending South Vietnam against
 Communist aggression, by whatever military
 action is necessary, and of making every
 effort to achieve a satisfactory settlement by
 negotiation.  However, he went on to indi-
 cate in considerable detail some of the stra-
 tegic devices which may be employed in im-
 plementation of that,policy.
 The strategy is complex but it boils down
 to  this:  Prevail upon  Communist  North
 Vietnam to break away from the dominance
 of Red China and chart its own course in
 foreign affairs.  Or, to put is,another way,
 the North Vietnamese are being encouraged
 to stop allowing themselves to, b@_,used as
 pawns of Peiping and to start acting in their
 own self-interest.
 An essential part of this strategy is to con-
 vince the North Vietnamese that their self-
 interests  lie  in peaceful settlement rather
 than in continuation of the war against
 South Vietnam to further Red Chinese am-
 bitions of conquest.
 "It would clearly be in the interest of
 North Vietnam to come to the conference
 table," President Johnson said.  "Commu-
 nist China apparently desires the war to con-
 tinue,  whatever  the  cost  to - their                                                                       allies.
 Their target is not merely South Vietnam.
 It is Asia,"
 The President went on to portray elabo-
 rately the bright economic future that is
 possible for all the Vietnamese people-to be
 established primarily by U.S. financial and
 technical assistance to promote progress in
 agriculture, in industry,  in education, in
 health, in housing.  He made a point of em-
 phasizing that "when peace has come * * *
 all the people of Vietnam, North and South
 alike," will share in the economic bounties.
 Noteworthy,  also,  was  the  President's
 specific invitation to the Soviet Union to
 join the United States in helping to "create
 a better life for the people of southeast
 Asia."
 One exceedingly large question, as Presi-
 dent Johnson well knows, is whether the
 North Vietnamese Communists have suffi-
 cient power and mastery of their own house
 to end the war in South Vietnam against
 the wishes of Red China.  As the air raids
 on North Vietnam intensify, and the price of
 aggression rises steadily, the political leaders
 in Hanoi may well be asking themselves the
 same question.

 Finally, President Johnson emphasizes the
 constructive and idealistic aspect of what he
 sees as the basic American goal in Vietnam.
 It is this nonmilitary aspect that he develops
 in his latest talk; not what the South Viet-
 namese are fighting against, but what they
 are fighting for-food, education, and health.
 President Johnson's educational campaign
 is keyed to the idealistic aspirations of young
 people.  It is chiefly in the colleges that pro-
 tests against the Vietnam war have centered.
 He does not sound a martial or belligerent
 note in his latest talk.  He does declare the
 United States unwavering purpose to meet
 what he charges is North Vietnamese aggres-
 sion.
 But the whole emphasis is on the Idealistic
 side, with reference to American cooperation
 to bring material improvement to the South
 Vietnamese.  Such improvement has come,
 he declares, even in spite of the war.  He lists
 such gains at length, remarking In passing
 that since 1954 the United States has spent
 $2 billion in economic help for the 16 million
 people.
 COMMON EFFORT SOUGHT
 Mr. Johnson boldly challenges not only the
 idealistic aspirations of his own citizens but
 of other countries, including the  Soviet
 Union.
 Mr. Johnson painted the struggle as one
 where the United States is developing food,
 health, education, and housing for the South
 Vietnamese but where Communist terrorists
 are raiding these very improvements in a
 deliberate campaign.
 His speech contained homely details of rice,
 corn, and pig production, and of an improved
 sweet potato that promises a "sixfold in-
 crease" in yield.
 Wistfully at the end he spoke of the hope
 of peace, when "we can share that gracious
 task with all the people of Vietnam-North
 and South alike."
 Mr. Johnson's speech was available by TV
 satellite  for  broadcast  all  over  Europe.
 it was another example of diplomacy by
 satellite. He sought to draw attention to
 many constructive things done in Vietnam
 that are obscured by the war.   He tried also
 to refute two assumptions-that the Viet-
 namese have no interest in the struggle and

 HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. CONTE.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to bring to the attention of the
 House a recent statement by our distin-
 guished colleague from the State of
 Maine, Representative STAN TUPPER, the
 full text of which appeared in the Port-
 land Sunday Telegram May 16, 1965.
 Congressman TUPPER, in his compre-
 hensive and forceful statement, has
 placed In proper perspective the prob-
 lems of the Republican Party; moreover,
 he advances some provocative proposals
 for the party's course in the future.
 I wish to commend the gentleman
 from Maine for his contribution to the
 cause of strong two-party government.
 If the Republican Party is to correct the
 damaging  imbalance  that  exists  in  the
 strength of cur two-party system, there must
 be abrupt and bold changes made within the
 minority party; another year may be too late.
 We now have at best a one-and-a-half
 party system in Washington,'lRth the specter
 of one-party government in the Nation in-
 creasingly before us.  The responsibility for
 this serious imbalance rests squarely with the
 Republican Party.
 If honest with ourselves, Republicans must
 admit that our party has abjectedly failed to
 capture the imagination of the voters for
 well over three decades.  Our victories have
 nearly always been victory of the individual
 rather than of party.  The only Republican
 presidential victory since1928 was a reward
 to a war hero.  General Eisenhower could
 have just as easily been elected as a Demo-
 crat, and often gave the impression that he
 wished he had been.
 While it grieves me to say so, the Repub-
 lican Party is still looked upon by the aver-
 age run-of-the-mill voter as the party of the
 wealthy, rather stuffy and lacking in imagi-
 nation.  Despite the considerable efforts of
 a handful ofRepublican governors, senators,
 and Congressmen to change this unfortunate
 image, it still persists.
 It is disquieting to read comments scorn-
 ing the idea that there is danger of the
 Republican Party  declining to  a splinter
 party status simply because It has manages.
 to survive in the past. This is but wishful..
 thinking; with little better than 20 percent
 of the registered voters now preferring the
 Republican Party, we face the ultimate loss
 of many of these loyal partisans unless we
 give them a better reason to vote Republican.

 Vietnam: Digging In and Pitching
 EXTEI'SION OF REMARIV
 or
 IRON. CLEMENT J.. ZABLOCKI
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. ZABLOCKI. Mr. Speaker, if U.S.
 policy in Vietnam could be summed up in
 two short phrases, they would be "digging
 in" and "pitching in."
 Today in Vietnam our marines, our
 paratroopers, and our South Vietnamese
 allies are digging in against an offensive
 from the Communist Vietcong that is al-
 most certain to come with the inception
 of the monsoon season.
 It will be a long, wet summer in Viet-
 nam and the inclement conditions will
 favor the guerrilla actions of the Viet-
 cong. The Communists may be hoping
 to obtain a swift and decisive victory
 during the coming months in order to
 force the withdrawal_of American sup-
 port from the South Vietnamese.-
 We are determined to blunt this at-
 tack, to deny victory to the Vietcong, and,
 thereby, hasten the day when the conflict
 can be taken off the battlefield and into
 the conference room.
 At the same time that we are making
 military preparations, we also are pitch-
 ing in to assist the economic progress of
 South Vietnam, and to help the Viet-
 namese people to better lives.
 In his recent statement to the Nation's
 editorial cartoonists, President Johnson
 described the achievements in develop-
 ment which have resulted from our
 financial and technical ' assistance-de-
 spite the state of crisis in Vietnam.
 It is clear that in Vietnam the United
 States is pitching in to help defeat those
 age-old enemies of man-hunger, igno-
 rance, poverty, and disease-just as we
 are digging in militarily against a 20th
 century scourge of humanity: Communist
 aggression and tyranny.,
 At this point I am pleased to insert
 four recent newspaper editorials com-
 menting on U.S. policy in Vietnam, in-
 cluding two from the Milwaukee Journal,
 These editorials point up both the
 digging in and the pitching in aspects of
 the struggle in Vietnam, and I commend
 them' to the attention of my colleagues: .
 [Prom the Milwaukee Journal, May 14, 1965]
 THIRD FACE OF VIETNAM
 Another picture of the Vietnam struggle
 emerged from President Johnson's statement
 Thursday to a group of editorial cartoonists.
 It depicted the steady task of development
 that continues amidst the shooting and
 terror.
 "It is the most important battle of all,"
 the President said.  "For a nation cannot be
 built by armed power or political agreement.
 It will rest on the expectation by individual
 men and, women that their future Will be
 better than.theirpast."
 The progress outlined by the President is
 amazing, considering the turmoil that has
 engulfed  the  country.   Since  1954,  the
 United States has spent more than $2 billion
 in economic aid for South Vietnam.      This
 has helped double rice production and In-
 crease corn output and has brought modern
 farming techniques that otherwise might
 never have been introduced.
 The United States has helped vaccinate
 more than 7 million people against cholera
 and millions more against other diseases.
 We have helped build 12,000 hamlet health
 stations.   A new medical school is under
 construction that will graduate as many doc-
 tors in a single year as now serve the entire
 South Vietnamese population.
 American money has gone into the con-
 struction of more than 4,000 classrooms in
 the last 2 years; 2,000 more schools will be
 built in the next 12 months. Our funds have
 been used to purchase 8 million textbooks
 and to increase elementary school capacity.
 Total enrollment, 300,000 in 1955, now stands
 at 1.5 million.
 The struggle in Vietnam has three faces,
 the President said-armed, conflict, diplo-
 macy and politics, and the Job of develop-
 ment.  The last existed before hpstilities be-
 gan and will be there when peace has come.
 "Then perhaps," he added, "we can share
 that gracious task with all the people of
 Vietnam-north and south alike."  That was
 the most hopeful comment of all.
 [From the Milwaukee Journal, May 20, 1965]
 BACK TO THE BOMBING
 The lull in American bombing of North
 Vietnamese targets is ended, apparently with-
 out any response by Hanoi to indicate a will-
 ingness to begin negotiations.
 The 6-day suspension did, however, serve
 several purposes: It indicated a response to
 critics in Congress, In the intellectual com-
 munity, and among our allies who have been
 exerting pressure for a negotiated settlement
 in Vietnam. It demonstrated that President
 Johnson Is not inflexible in the course being
 followed in the war.  It. provided an oppor-
 tunity for a direct approach to Hanoi through
 a third party-an effort which has so far
 proved fruitless.
 The refusal of North Vietnam to give any
 positive response to President Johnson's dis-
 play of good faith is interpreted as evidence
 of the influence of pro-Peiping elements in
 the Hanoi government.   The Communists
 are said to hope for a quick and decisive vic-
 tory during the monsoon season between
 June and August.
 The Americans and the South Vietnamese
 are preparing for such an effort, hoping that
 its repulse will bring the Reds to the con-
 ference table.
 It appears now that the bombings will con-
 tinue on much the same scale as in the past
 until such time as developments bring some
 meaningful response from the north and
 another bid for negotiation appears to have
 some chance.
 [From the Knoxville News-Sentinel,
 May 14, 1965]
 L.B.J. MAKES His CASE-ELOQUENTLY
 President Johnson never has done a more
 persuasive job on an issue than he did Thurs-
 day morning in his TV appearance to detail
 again the whys and hows of U.S. policy in
 Vietnam.
 Some seem to think the President is mak-
 ing these repeated enunciation of our pur-
 pose in Vietnam because a few vociferous
 professors and others keep ragging him on
 the subject, L.B.J. Isn't going to reverse this
 particular brand of nonthinking-but ad-
 dresses such as"Thursday's can do a lot to
 solidify national understanding.
 Moreover, this puts it up to the Commu-
 nists once .A}ore....They show no more sign
 of relenting than the college hecklers.  But
 there are other people in the world who do
 have open minds.
 A2643
 Our policy, the way Mr. Johnson stated it
 Thursday, is positive, not merely defensive.
 Our preferred priority is on helping the
 South Vietnamese (and others in southeast
 Asia) to improve their lot.  Since 1954, for
 instance, rice production has been doubled,
 new crops introduced, industrial production
 developed.   This all would be much more
 meaningful, and farther along, except for the
 Communists who murder and pillage and
 force the Vietnamese and the United States
 to concentrate on military defense.
 Americans would much rather devote some
 of their resources to helping others with
 their economy and their standard of living.
 Our heavy expenditures on weapons are not
 by choice, but through necessity.
 All the same, the President is still willing
 to sit down and talk it out.
 The North Vietnamese obviously are hard
 to convince.  Probably because for so many
 of the years this war has been going on they
 have been getting off easy, giving them the
 idea the United States was merely a paper
 tiger and that eventually they could over-
 whelm the South Vietnamese.
 The President's purpose is to disabuse them
 of both notions-meanwhile being ready to
 negotiate and even readier to get on with
 peaceful ways to better life in southeast Asia,
 a program which would be far more useful to
 us and to the Asians than fighting.
 There is nothing new or strange In this
 double-edged policy.  This Is what we did
 during and after World War II.  We went all
 out to win and when the military job was
 finished we turned an enormous share of our
 effort and resources toward peaceful develop-
 ment around the world.
 [From the Bridgewater (S. Dak.)  Tribune,
 Apr. 29, 1965 ]
 There are diametrically opposed points of
 view as to what we can do and should do in
 Vietnam.  But there can no longer be any
 dissent to one fact:  this Government is
 totally committed to using whatever force
 and whatever tactics are necessary to pre-
 serve South  Vietnam from  a  Communist
 takeover. The President went all out when,
 at a conference of Governors, lie declared
 that this would be the policy even if it takes
 "20 or 50 years." He has also said that he is
 always ready to negotiate an honorable peace
 but has found no signs of any willingness on
 the part of the Communists to move in that
 direction.
 Intelligence Digest, a British publication
 which deals in world affairs and has a repu-
 tation for prescience, quotes one of its spe-
 cial correspondents as saying:. "It is now
 obvious that the United States has worked
 itself into a monstrous dilemma in Vietnam
 and finds itself, so to speak, suspended be-
 tween the devil and the deep blue sea.  What
 is so aggravating to America and her allies Is
 the fact that there do not seem to be any
 alternatives for the solution of the situation
 but the following three courses of action:
 (i) An indefinite prolongation of the present
 situation;  (ii)  a negotiated neutralization
 of Vietnam and subsequent American with-
 drawal; or, (iii) an expansion of the war at
 the risk of a conflict with Red China and/
 or Soviet Russia."
 This is a widely held point abroad.  And
 certainly no one can any longer believe that
 there is a simple solution to the Vietnam
 problem.  The President, it seems absolutely
 clear, has made his decision and there will
 be no back tracking.  That decision, as U.S.
 News & World Report sums it up, "is to be
 generous if the Communists end their ag-
 gression, but brutal if they choose a test of
 military  strength."  The   magazine  adds
 that Red China has been informed that she
 will be subject to attack with all weapons,
 including nuclear, if she enters the fight.
 In other words, it is up to the Communists
 to decide whether the war is to grow hotter
 or not.  And in this country, the President's

 position is being given the most powerful
 kind of bipartisan support within and with-
 out Congress.  For instance, Barry Gold-
 water,  in  one of his newspaper columns,
 writes that the Johnson policy "has worked
 wonders ~'in turning the war from a hopeless
 morass into a sharply focused issue."  Go-
 ing on, he suggests that this country issue
 a "target ultimatum" to the Hanoi govern-
 ment.  This would consist of naming a series
 of  targets  of  increasing  importance that
 would be hit successively until Hanoi accedes
 to peace terms.  He also proposes that we ask
 our Asian allies such as the Philippines, to
 enter the Vietnam ground war.
 There is another important facet to the
 picture.  Newsweek sums  it up this way:
 "For the time being, at least, Washington's
 newfound decisiveness  has  stolen  the in-
 itiative                      from  the  Communist    camp.  In
 sharp contrast with the recent, past, it is
 now the leaders in Moscow and Peiping who
 seem uncertain and confused, who are grop-
 ing for a way to answer the U.S. challenge."
 So far as anyone can see now, they don't
 want to risk direct warfare, on any scale,
 with the United States, while, at the same
 time, they are vitally concerned with saving
 face.
 No one knows what the future will bring.;
 But the United States is demonstrating th79

 HON. EMILIO Q. DADDARIO
 OF CONNECTICUT
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. DADDARIO.  Mr. Speaker, the
 activity of the United States in mov-
 ing into the Dominican Republic to pro-
 tect the lives of our citizens has had a
 serious effect upon our people, who have
 followed this operation closely.  The
 Hartford Times, which is one of the ma-
 jor newspapers in Connecticut, recent-
 ly commented on the forthright nature
 of the President's actions, and I believe
 it deserves the recognition of all Mem-
 bers of the House.  I offer the editorial
 for the RECORD:
 (From the Hartford (Conn.) Times, May 3,
 1965]
 THE PRESIDENT'S DECISIONS
 The decisions made by President John-
 son in Vietnam and the Dominican Repub-
 lie-to defend our commitments and respon-
 sibilities-is bound to have salutary effect.
 The firming exposition of our attitude will
 arouse criticism;  there always is "another
 way" to act.
 :But we think that the President has made
 our position more creditable, in this way
 carrying on in the direction taken by Pres-
 ident Kennedy at the time of the Cuban
 missiles crisis.
 An overriding disposition to defer, to stand
 on the beach and talk about rescue when
 diving in and effecting the rescue Is re-
 quired, always leaves at question whether
 one can, or will swim.
 President Johnson is distinguishing be-
 tween occasions-the time to talk, and the
 time to act.  And in national affairs such
 distinction  is as  important  and  laudable
 as is our basic disposition to negotiate or
 compromise.
 One senses an opinion hsd formed that
 the U.S. endorsed negotiation and deferment
 even when that constituted a retreat into
 words rather than an advance toward a so-
 lution.   Events in Vietnam and at Santo
 Domingo have corrected any such misap-
 prehension.
 We champion peace, but also we champion
 responsibility and our commitments.  Peace
 is weakened when we veer off from the job
 of making our Will believable.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JEFFERY COHELAN
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, May 25, 1965
 Mr. COHELAN.                                      Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
 cans will do "stoop labor" if they are
 paid for it.
 This statement of Ralph McGill, writ-
 ing in the New York Hearld Tribune of
 May 18, clearly supports the position cf
 Congress in terminating Public Law 78
 and the insistance of the Secretary of
 Labor that domestic workers can be
 hired if competition is permitted to re-
 turn to the farm labor market.
 At a time of frequent charge and
 countercharge, and in a further effort to
 set the record straight, I include Mr.
 McGill's remarks for our colleagues'
 information:
 No FOREIGN LABOR
 (By Ralph McGill)
 It is claimed that "Americans won't do
 stoop labor."  The answer seems to be that
 they will do it if they are paid for it.
 Public opinion in California appears to be
 rallying behind a congressional act and the
 Secretary of Labor whose job it is to enforce
 it.   The Congress  barred  importation  of
 cheap foreign labor to harvest crops.
 The outcry from growers in California was
 loud and angry.     They insisted Americans
 won't do stoop labor-picking vegetables,
 fruit, and lettuce. They demanded the gov-
 ernment allow the import of cheap Mexican
 labor.
 The position of the growers was, to persons
 outside the State, untenable and somewhat
 shocking.  The growers were among the loud-
 est in their support of free enterprise.  Yet,
 in a State where 400,000 Americans are job-
 less, growers put themselves in a position of
 demanding that the Government provide
 them with labor that would not merely work
 for wages below the competitive level but
 would also accept living conditions that all
 too often involved squalor and misery.  In-
 vestigations revealed that some growers had
 provided good working and living conditions
 for the contract laborer. A majority had not.
 Secretary Willard Wirtz, in carrying out
 the congressional legislation, suggested that
 jobless Americans would respond if the wages
 were adequate and the living conditions im-
 proved.  The contract under which foreign
 labor             was  imported  guaranteed  work  for
 three-fourths of the contract period.              The
 Department of Labor suggested this be tried
 with U.S. workers.           It was. The lettuce crop
 was harvested in the Imperial Valley.          Statis-
 tics here indicate the work was done more
 efficiently.
 Some growers continue their demands to
 bring in foreign labor while their own people
 are without work.  Some canning represent-
 atives, in a recent meeting With the Secre-
 tary, threatened to move their operations
 into Mexico, thereby throwing thousands
 more Americans out of work.
 There are indications that American in-
 dustry leaders outside California are holding
 up a warning finger to the growers who make
 free enterprise seem ridiculous by insisting
 on avoiding the competitive labor market and
 retaining the special privilege of importing
 noncompetitive labor with Federal help.
 The Secretary of Labor has been consist-
 ent.  He argues that adequate domestic work-
 ers can be hired from the 400,000 unemployed
 if competition is permitted to return to the
 farm labor market. Reasonable wages, decent
 housing and food for field hands, he insists,
 ,will bring the workers.  Mr. Wirtz summing
 up included these points:
 "Treat your domestic workers right, and
 you will never lack for them.  If you don't
 treat them right, there will be no certifica-
 tion of foreign workers to ease the transition.
 Higher wages may mean some slight increase
 in retail prices, but the American housewife
 should be willing to pay a half-cent more for
 a head of lettuce to improve the lot of farm
 labor."
 Mr. Wirtz has been heard to say that the
 economy of the great factories in the fields
 resembles the industrial development of the
 years following the Civil War when millions
 of immigrants were brought in to fill the new
 factories and mills, to lay the rails west, to
 dig the canals, and so on.  There no longer
 is any reason for U.S. agriculture to be al-
 lowed special considerations in a State where
 some 400,000 Americans are outof work.
 California's  farm  economy    is  the  most
 prosperous in the Nation.  Public opinion in

 U.S. Cancels Grand Jury Probe in Social
 Security Fee Dispute
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. H. R. GROSS
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Monday, May 24, 1965
 Mr. GROSS.                                                                            Mr. Speaker, in the in-
 terest of acquainting other Members of
 the House of Representatives with a sit-
 uation involving social security claims,
 I have obtained permission to have re-
 printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an
 article which appeared in the May 16,
 1965, issue of the Des Moines, Iowa, Sun-
 day Register.
 While this article deals only with a
 situation in Iowa, there is evidence that
 highly questionable practices in the han-
 dling of social security claims may be
 much more widespread.  If it does be-
 come apparent that an appreciable num-
 ber of social security beneficiaries have
 been the victims of sharp practices in
 the establishment or maintenance of
 their claims it may be necessary for a
 proper committee of Congress to delve
 into the matter.
 Following is the newspaper article:
 U.S. CANCELS GRAND JURY PROBE IN IOWA FEE
 DISPUTE
 (By Nick Kotz, of the Register's Washington
 Bureau)
 WASHINGTON,                                                                       D.C.-A scheduled  Federal
 grand jury                                                                    investigation of two Iowa at-
 torneys was called off after the attorneys
 agreed to refund several thousands of dollars
 they charged social security applicants.
