 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1o    USSR.  Electricity shortage reported in Central Volga regions  A 24 August
 Red Star article -states that the central industrial region comprising seven
 oblasts, ten percent of the Soviet population, and a "considerable" propor-
 tion of heavy industry is short of electricity.  This shortage, said to be.
 delaying the industrial development of the Volga area as well as of the en-
 tire central industrial region, will theoretically end upon completion of
 the new Volga hydro-electric stations,  (S Moscow Weeka, MA-1216, 31 Aug 51)
 -Comments  "Shortage" of electricity may possibly be serving a dual
 purpose in that it excuses lagging industrial production, while at the same
 time acting to stimulate speedy completion of the postwar Volga hydroelectric
 program.
 2?     EASTERN EUROPE. GENERAL.  Satellites reportedly preparing to shift labor to
 high priority industries: A recent report from Germany points to a compre-
 hensive program of labor resettlement in the Satellite states aimed at rais-
 ing the productivity of heavy industry.  The whole program is aimed at build-
 ing an economy under the centralized direction of Soviet economic experts
 that will counter-balance that of Western Europe.  Soviet recruiting teams
 are reportedly visiting Satellite industrial installations on a survey of
 technicians in order to allocate them to high priority industries, includ-
 ing shipbuilding, mining and heavy automotive manufacture.  The program in
 East Germany contemplates the eventual transfer of about 150,000 workers to
 Poland., Czechoslovakia and Hungary,  (U New York Times, 2 Sep 51)
 Comments  The transfer of skilled technicians between countries of the
 Soviet Orbit to high priority jobs has been evident for some time.  The
 movement of industrial labor, however, is a possible new development in the
 Satellites,
 No evidence is available to confirm the contemplated transfer of 150,000
 Germans to neighboring Satellites,  This development would reverse a trend
 of expelling Germans from the Satellites since the end of the ware  While
 there is some unemployment in East Germany at present,, the East German Five
 Year Plan requirements make the transfer of this number of German workers
 unlikely,

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA,  Worldwide publicity on Oatis case disturbs Communists:
 The US Embassy Prague reports that the worldwide interest in the Oatis case
 may be disturbing the Czechoslovak Communists as is evidenced by the resump-
 tion of publicity regarding Oatis for the first time since the trial ended
 on 4 July.  Czechoslovak  propaganda is seeking to belittle Western efforts

 to free Oatis.and goes considerably beyond the indictment in describing his
 alleged crime and guilt.  (C Prague 165, 31 Aug 51)
 Comment:  The theme of current Czechoslovak propaganda regarding the
 Oatis case is the contrast between legitimate and even critical reporting
 of Czechoslovak events and espionage which Oatis was allegedly engaged in.

 la   IRAN.  Comment on Palish and Czech bid far Iranian oil:  Iran, according
 to its official spokesmen, is considering a bid from Poland and Czecho-
 slovakia for the purchase of 700,000 and 500,000 tons of oil respectively.
 It was also stated that companies in the US, Italy and Sweden had offered
 to supply tankers.
 Poland owns four tankers with a combined tonnage of 22,044 and char-
 ters three totaling 179378 tons.  The Czechs have no ocean-going tankers
 under their control.  Using its entire tanker facilities, Poland could
 move the 19200,000 tons of oil under consideration in approximately three
 years.  There is no indication that any sizeable number of tankers will
 be available for charter anywhere in the free world.

 4.      BURMA..   Increasing Communist militarv cagabilities reported: The US
 Embassy in Rangoon reports that insurgents have recently become more
 active in the vital Irrawaddy Deltas, while maintaining a high level of
 activity farther north.  The embassy has noted increasing evidence of
 Communist ability to concentrate larger forces than heretofore for op-
 erations in strategic areas.  (C Rangoon 2489 1 Sep 51)

 titularly encouraged by the enthusiasm of the students who have also or-
 ganized. a new non-Communist school and have launched a campaign to recruit
 other students attending pro-Communist schools.  As further evidence of this
 trend, the embassy reports that there have been several instances during the
 past few days of local Chinese leaders initiating social contacts with mem-
 bers of the embassy, whereas previously they had tended to consort exclus-
 ively with the Communists.  (C Rangoon 2489 1 Sep 51)
 C   en o  Growing antagonism among the Chinese in Burma toward the
 Communists has been noted for some time.

 Embassy in Rangoon, recently returned from Namkham9 near the
 China-Burma
 border, reports that the area is relatively peaceful but that smuggling
 continues on a "considerable scale" over the Burma Road.  This smuggling,,
 averaging 20 truck loads of contrabands a day, is largely under the con-
 trol of the Burmese Army, which collects over 400 dollars for each truck.
 reported that during a 10 day visit in Wanting on the China Ksidenofathe
 border he observed truck convoys, loaded with tires and petroleum, leaving
 for Kunming every few nights.  He further confirmed the complete absence
 of Burmese military authority in the village of Kyukok, which Ss directly
 across the border from Wanting, and claimed that it was controlled by
 Chinese Communist agents.  (C Rangoon 248, 1 Sep 51)
 s  The smuggling of tires and petroleum products over the
 Burma Road into China has been reported by a number of sources.  Although
 the Burmese Government is aware of this problem, it is both unwilling
 and unable to take effective action to suppress smuggling, especially in
 the absence of strong outside pressure.

 sties, allowing their political interests to be represented by a "national
 organization,"  This is apparently a reference to Dato Onn's recently-
 con-ceived "Independence of Malaya Party," the non-communal rival of the United
 Malay National Organization (UMNO) whose presidency Dato Onn recently re-
 linquished.  The UMNO, lacking Onn?s leadership, has already retrogressed
 toward a narrowly racist, Malaya-for-the-Malays policy,  Dato Onn predicts
 that UMNO will intrigue with the Sultans but that he will get the support
 of the villages.  (C Kuala Lumpur 41, 31 Aug 51)
 8.  INDOCHINA. Viet Minh army.morale retorted declininao  Viet Minh: forces are
 reported by French Gm2 in Saigon to be undergoing increasing hardship from
 lack of food and medicine.  Thirty to sixty percent of the troops in large
 units are unable to fight due to sickness.  The result has been a decline
 in troop morale, increased desertion, and failure to fill recruitment quotas.
 Because of the condition of Viet Minh troops and the prevailing flood condi-
 tions in the Tonkin delta, no major action is expected before October.  (S
 USARMA Saigon, MC 227, 2 Sep 51)
 99a  n o  Cumulative evidence from several sources has strongly indi-
 cated that the Viet Minh is increasingly hard-pressed to meet the material
 needs of the population within its zone, and that civilian morale has con-
 sequently declined,,                            This is the first report, however, that Viet Minh armed
 forces are suffering a-similar lowering of morale.
 9.                Economic and psvcholoaical deterioration in Viet Minh zoned  The
 Viet Minh-held rice?producing region of Thanh Hoa in northern Annan is suf-

 the Far East division of the French Foreign Office told US Ambassador
 Bruce in Paris that the French Government is considering the possibility of
 repatriating, through the agency of some international organization such as
 the Red Cross, the 30,000 Chinese Nationalist troops interned in Indochina.
 The official indicated that some decision on this question might be taken
 "before long."  (S Paris 1368, 31 Aug 51)

 Comments  Although constantly pressed by Chinese Nationalist officials
 to repatriate these troops., the French authorities have postponed making
 any decision for more than a year and a half.

 nameses  The hand of the French Surete was evident in the invalidation of
 the passport of Tran Van An9 semi-6fficial Vietnamese press representative
 to the San Francisco conference.  Although known to be on very poor terms
 with General De Lattre and regarded by the French as suspiciously pro-US,
 Tran Van An had been personally invited to attend the conference by Premier
 Huu.  The US Charge comments that this episode,, following closely upon other
 cases of French intolerance of even the Oloyal opposition,," will have con-
 siderable repercussions.  (S Saigon 551, 1 Sep 51)

 The number of Chinese advisers in North Vietnam reportedly is unchanged,
 but new."propaganda units" are arriving.  Reports received by French Gm2
 from agents in the area of Langson9 the traditional "China Gate,," indicates
 no evidence of Chinese troops on the Indochina side of the frontier.  This
 is verified by French Air Force reports.  (S Saigon OARMA MC 227?51,, 2 Sep

 Chinese Commun s  s                                       in late February 19519
 SOBSI,, Communist=controlled Indonesian labor a era ion,, was receiving a
 monthly subsidy of about 159000 dollars from Chinese Communists for use in
 instigating strikes.  Chinese Communists were spending approximately the
 same amount for propaganda purposes., including individual subsidies ranging
 from 300 to 1,500 dollars to leftist newspapers in Indonesia.
 Indonesian police have been unable to apprehend 242 Chinese Communists
 who secretly entered Sumatra and southwestern Borneo in late 1950.  Early
 in February., three of these Chinese were arrested in Pontianak but escaped
 three days later.                                                            25X1 A
 C mmen a  Both infiltration of Chinese Communist agents and Chinese
 financial support of Indonesian and Chinese Communist activity in Indonesia
 are frequently reported and undoubtedly exist.  The full extent of such
 activity., however., is impossible to assess.

 drawn from South Sumatra, Java and parts of East Indonesia in readiness for

 The US Army Attache comments that the guerrillas, now numbering 4,000,
 could swell to 8,000 or 10,000, and that the affair could become equal in
 significance to the Makassar "rebellion" of 1950.  Rumors persist that the
 Chinese Communists may have had a hand in fomenting the trouble.  C'Djakarta

 involvement of government forces.  Five days of heavy fighting followed,

 quality basis:  Observing that the senatorial candidates chosen by the op-
 position party (Nationalista) are much more impressive than those put up
 by the Liberal Party, the US Embassy in Manila comments that if Voting were
 on the basis of quality and if.(as is "unlikely") the November elections

 majority,  (C-Manila 867, 31 Aug 51)

 The Nationalistas-oppose Philippine acceptance of the Japanese peace treaty
 and accuse the administration of subservience to the US.
 Although there has been considerable public demand that the fraud and
 coercion which accompanied the 1949 elections not be repeated, the adminis-

 could be expected to devise an organization and program designed to appeal

 other Western submarines are believed to have been in these waters at
 the time, this appears to be the first reliable sighting of a Communist
 submarine in South China waters,  Previous reported sightings of submarines
 in these waters have been assessed as possibly true.  Numerous unconfirmed
 reports have stated that Russian submarines are smuggling agents and arms
 into Southeast Asian countries and the Philippines.

 The  4ilY Di est of 13 August reported the unconfirmed
 assertion                           hat Soviet ground forces in the Port
 Arthur area were  e ng increased to a total of about 100,000 men; the
 present report, also unconfirmed, indicates a ground force strength more
 nearly in accord with the figure (61,000) accepted by US Army G?2.
 The figure of 350 aircraft is also unconfirmed but also cred i:.b1a, and
 may even be law.  There is Soviet naval activity of various kinds in the
 PANBA, but the presence of a destroyer squadron (at least six DDs) cannot
 be confirmed.
 ~{a~ Kangso ~~~  ~c~rra~ti?gn~ and "bureaucrac,y" in Manchuria,
 Mukden radio states that the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist
 Party met with 2,000 of its top cadres on 31 August to discuss "bad prac-
 tices and bureaucracy" in various unspecified Manchurian organizations,
 Kao Kang, the leading Party and governmental functionary in the Northeast,
 is reported to have "severely criticized corruption and bureaucratic methods
 in management,"'  Kao is further quoted as citing this "trend" as evidence
 that the Party has been affected by "reactionary capitalism."  (R FBID
 Flimsy, 1 Sep 51)
 22mment& Kao?s remarks clearly point to a more serious problem than
 the moral failings of the cadres, but this brief release suggests only the
 nature and not the magnitude of the problem.  If it is true that corruption
 and incompetence are widespread among the managerial personnel of state
 enterprises iniManchuria ?- the area longest and most firmly under Communist
 control ?- it is reasonable to assume that this problem is much greater
 throughout China than the Communists have admitted.

 C mmen x It is worth noting that Mao?s "high evaluation" of the Soviet
 role is confined to appreciation for "help" and "inspiration.," and does not
 credit the USSR with the leading or even a major part in the fight.  Peiping
 apparently feels., with truth, that the Chinese contribution    both National-
 jet': and Communist mo was considerably greater than the Soviet.  Nevertheless,,
 this exchange of messages,, on the occasion of Sino'Soviet observance of
 V-9 Day, draws attention to the unity of Sino-Soviet purpose as expressed
 in the Sino Soviet treaty of February 1950    namely, that of preventing the
 resurgence of Japanese aggression.

 with additional troops, the earlier democratic nations will be able to
 attain their ultimate aims.  (R FBID Ticker, 3 Sep 51)

 Minister of Defense stated that the ROK.Army will be a "first class fight-
 ing machine,"'Rhea?s speech gives the appearance of another campaign for
 US arms to equip a large army.  The motivation of the campaign'is not clear
 but may stem from Rheees apprehension that the UN is going to pull its         25X6

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.  GENERAL.  Smaller NATO countries may check power of military:  US NATO
 Deputy  pofford warns that it would be a mistake to underestimate the
 resentment caused by the three power Standing Group's refusal to present
 a report or to be represented at the Ottawa meeting-of NATO Finance and
 Foreign Ministers.  He expects that some of the minor NATO countries will
 now press strongly for greater control over the deliberations of the Standing
 Group,  (S London, Depto 298, 30 Aug 51)
 Comment:      The Standing Group argues that the Ottawa meeting is primarily
 non-mil,            Several NATO nations, however, claim that a military progress
 report is needed, and that a Standing Group representative should be present
 to answer questions.  The NATO governments not represented on the Standing
 Group are jealous of the power they have delegated, and, unless the Standing
 Group takes steps to keep them better informed of its deliberations, they
 will undoubtedly demand a share in decisions now made by the tripartite body,
 2.   GERMANY.  New Soviet move tightens economic noose in Berlin:  On 31 August
 Soviet and as  German authorities further tig  ene   he economic squeeze
 on West Berlin by imposing a toll on all West German traffic between Berlin,
 and Western Germany,  Exempting Allied and East German traffic, they levied
 the tax-for "maintenance of the road"-on each one-way trip made by both
 cars and trucks-, West German truckers reacted sharply by blocking the highway
 at the Helmstedt border point, in an attempt to prevent compliance and force
 action by West German authorities to alleviate the situation.
 Local US officials see no chance for immediate relief to the shippers,
 who carry most of West Berlin's imports of perishable foods.  The thirteen
 freight trains now running daily to Berlin are the limit permitted the Allies
 and are already fully utilized, although some unused capacity is available
 on the Elbe water=way,  These officials estimate that the new tax, if absorbed
 by shippers and consignees, would increase shipping costs at least 20 percents
 constitute a 1+palpable increase" in the cost of food and other imports, and
 measurably affect the competitive position of West Berlin's industry.
 The Allied commandants in Berlin met on 3 September with West Berlin
 officials to discuss possible countermeasures, including the taxing of all
 East German barges passing through West Berlin locks, an effective measure
 in the past.  (C Berlin 3399 1 Sep 51)
 Comment:  This latest Soviet move, apparently under consideration
 since at least last June, represents another in a series of measures designed
 to harass West Berlin, and a possible further step to force resumption of
 interzonal German trade.  The step, which will greatly increase the general

 British and US officials, however, believe that the Russians are much

 Margaretha will' try to convince US officials that an additional release
 of counterpart funds for 1951 is essential., that present exchange rates must
 be maintained if further price advances in imported raw materials and food
 items are to be avoided, and that Austria should be granted additional
 latitude in exports to Czechoslovakia and Poland in return for their rela-
 tively cheaper coals  As an example of Austriaes efforts to achieve economic
 stability, the minister will cite current measures to hold the line on meat
 prices, even though such anti-inflationary controls have resulted in serious
 shortages of meats  (C Vienna 841, 30 Aug 51)
 Comment:  Rising costs of essential raw materials, deterioration of
 trade wit  Western Germany subsequent to.Germanyos own balance-of-payments
 difficulties, a continuation of controlled inflation under the system of
 periodic wage-price increases, and vulnerability to economic pressures
 exerted by Poland and Czechoslovakia have all contributed to the current
 economic difficulties in which Austria finds itself and to fears that the
 situation may become acute this falls  While retention of price controls
 for meat is no doubt politically essential and has avoided importation of
 expensive animal feeds, imports of animal products have in consequence
 further burdened Austrians limited supply of foreign exchange,

 1. ;M.  More delays over Iraq Petroleum Company agreement foreseens  The Iraqi
 Prime Minister has proposed that the negotiators begin drafting the final
 text of the oil agreement, which will then be submitted to Parliament for
 consideration.  Both the British Charge and IPC officials foresee that the
 drafting of the agreement will produce long tough wrangles and probably new
 Iraqi demands.  (C, S/S Baghdad 188, 2 Sep 51),
 cowmen s  The Prime Minister is reluctant to come to a final agreement
 with the oil company because he fears the reaction of the Iraqi opposition
 parties.  Prime Minister Nuri Said has refused to sign the letters covering
 the oil agreement unless the company promises a basic minimum,annual royalty
 payment.  A company official has recommended that the IFC make a private
 pledge to include a provision on a minimum annual royalty payment in the final
 draft of the agreement.
 IRAN.  Economic situation in Irans  The US Embassy in Tehran, in a statement
 o  Iran's economic prospects, concludes that economic collapse could be
 averted for several months and possibly longer by resorting to various ex-
 pedients, such as reducing note-cover reserve or simply printing more money.
 Moreover, the primarily agricultural economy of the country can stand consider-
 able deterioration in non-agricultural sectors before breakiown would occur.

 3. INDONESIA.  Indonesia likely to sign Japanese peace treaty:  Despite impor-
 tant political and press opposition in Indonesia to signature-of the Japanese
 peace treaty, the US Ambassador in Djakarta expects the government to author-
 ize its delegation at San Francisco to sign the treaty and to obtain majority
 support in Parliament when the question of ratification subsequently arises.
 The Indonesian Prime Minister is currently demonstrating exceptional
 firmness in his determination to have Indonesia sign the treaty,  Both Presi--
 dent Sukarno and Vice President Hatta support him strongly in this policy,

 Comments  The Department of State has requested 12 governments recogniz-
 ing the Peiping regime to instruct their representatives in Peiping to dis cuss
 with the Foreign Ministry, inter alia, the cases of at least 20 US nationals
 imprisoned in Communist China, some 30 others under house arrest, and a number
 of others unable to obtain exit permits.  The nationals of governments recog-
 nizing the Peiping regime have generally fared much better than those of non-
 recognizing governments, particularly the US.  It is conjectural whether
 Lamb's representations or those of the other recognizing governments will
 significantly improve the status of US nationals.

 was no possibility of Irel   's joining NATO or other collective defense
 arrangements at this time?  (S, S/S Paris 1377, 31 Aug 51),
 Cos  This is the first reported approach to the US for military
 assistance on the part of the DeValera government which came to power in June,
 Early in 1950 the previous government had indicated to the US Ambassador that
 it needed US equipment for defense against a possible airborne invasion, and
 very indirectly hinted that it might be prepared in return to forget about
 the Partition issue which had kept it out of NATO, and to enter instead into
 a formal alliance with the  US alone on much the same terms as NATO membership,
 Though introducing a military budget about 25 percent higher than its pre-
 decessor0e, the DeValera government had publicly reaffirmed Irish neutrality,
 and has given no countenance to any suggestions that Ireland might in effect
 be willing tq trade bases for military assistance,  The form of the present
 approach, which easily lends itself to official denials, further suggests
 that DeValera is not yet ready to challenge Irish neutrality sentiment to ob-
 tain US military equipment,

 O t t a w a s s Foreign Minister Lange stated to US AMnbassador Bay that although

 does not intend to lead the opposition to such membership at the Ottawa meet-
 ing.  Norway, he said, will make known its position that Greek Turkish security
 needs can be adequately safeguarded by a Mediterranean Pact,, and that such a
 pact is preferable since Greek Turkish membership would dilute NATOAs Western
 European character and lend substance to the view that the treaty is merely a
 military alliance?  Lange added that he expected some support for this posI
 tiOn at Ottawa,  (TS, S/S Oslo 235, 3 Sep 51)0
 Comments  Norway will tenaciously oppose the extension of membership ut
 til it becomes clear that the majority of other NATO members are prepared to
 endorse Greek-Turkish admission,  However, since Norway is not preparing to
 lead the opposition, as it has in the London discussions, and the Netherlands
 Government has indicated its reluctant'acquiescence, concerted opposition at
 Ottawa is not expected to be strong or protracted.
