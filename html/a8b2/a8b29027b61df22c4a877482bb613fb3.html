ARAB-ISRAEL1 CONFLICT 
USSR WELCOMES ARAB SUMMIT, MARKS TIME ON DEVELOPMENTS 
Moscow continues its reportage on developments connected with the 
cease-fire agreement and convocation of an Arab-Israeli peace 
conference, but there has been little comment of substance. The 
Soviet posture was typified in a message from Podgornyy and 
Kosygin welcoming the Arab summit conference, convened in Algiers 
on 26 November. The message stressed the need for further Arab 
coordination as the Middle East conflict enters "a stage of 
practical steps," and it again called for Israeli withdrawal 
from "all" Arab territories. 
While continuing to complain of Israeli tactics of "sabotage and 
procrastination," Moscow has briefly noted Israel's 25 November 
agreement in principle to take part in a peace conference with 
the "stipulation" that the Israeli Government cannot make any 
important decision before the parliamentary elections at the end 
of December. And Soviet media reported without comment Secretary 
Kissinger's assessment, in his 21 November news conference, of 
sufficient progress in the Egyptian-Israeli situation so that a 
negotiating process could begin in December. 
KISSINGER NEWS CONFERENCE Short reports of Secretary Kissinger's 
21 November news conference by TASS, 
Moscow radio and PRAVDA, while varying somewhat, all focused on his 
opening statement on the Middle East and paraphrased some of his 
remarks on detente. 
-I- U.S. objectives, peace conference: Kissinger was cited as 
explaining the U.S. objective in the Middle East as solidifying 
the cease-fire "so that we could move forward together with other 
interested parties" toward peace negotiations. TASS and PRAVDA 
noted his belief that sufficient progress had been made in the 
"complex situation" on the Egyptian-Israeli front so that "we can 
look forward with scme confidence" to the beginning of peace 
negoaations. Kissinger was also reported as saying that "our 
effort will be to create the appropriate auspices called for in 
Resolution 338 and under the auspices of the United Nations" to 
begin a negotiating process hopefully during December. The 
Soviet reports did not mention Kissinger's remark that thk peace 
conference should be under the auspices of Moscow and Washington 
with UN "blessing," and Moscow has never defined the

- 2 - 
"appropriate auspices," going no further than observations by 
PRAVDA's Zhukov that the negotiations should be held under 
"suitable aegis," involving the assistance and participation 
"of the United Nations or that of various states." Thus Soviet 
media have ignored Cairo and Amman reports on the 27th that the 
U.S. and Soviet envoys had been jointly received by Egyptian 
Vice President Fawzi and King Husayn respectively; Amman radio 
explained that the ambassadors had extended an invitation to 
Jordan to attend the peace conference to be held in Geneva on 
18 December. 
-I- Detente: The Soviet accounts of Kissinger's press conference 
all cited the Secretary as noting the "great significance" of 
detente in Soviet-American relations for the settlement of the 
Middle East conflict. According to PRAVDA and Moscow's domestic 
service, Kissinger said that from time to time "existing 
differences cause tension" in U.S.-Soviet relations and it was 
important at such moments to have sufficient trust between 
them to relax this tension. (Kissinger in fact said that, as 
happened during the Middle East crisis, "long-standing commit-
ments--ideological pressures--produce actions that bring these two 
sides into confrontation." At that point, he added, "it is 
important that enough confidence exist so that the confrontation 
is mitigated.") 
-I- Guarantees: Moscow's reports of the news conference did not 
mention Kissinger's observation that the final accord would have 
to include "an element of security arrangements" between the 
Arabs and Israelis and "may have to have an element of outside 
guarantees." But TASS on the 24th did note his remark on outside 
guarantees in promptly reporting Israeli Defense Minister Dayan 
as turning down "the American proposal for guarantees of Israel's 
borders and security." TASS cited Dayan as declaring that "the 
Americans 'tell us that we can and must rely on security guarantees. 
But why do we need such guarantees in view of the fact that 
Israeli borders will then be worth nothing?'" TASS assessed 
Dayan's statement as demonstrating that Israel's real concern 
was not the security of its borders nor even the establishment of 
peace, but rather a continued policy of territorial expansion. 
The same point was expressed in a Mayevskiy article in PRAVDA on 
the 23d which scoffed that the Israeli "theory of the 'need for 
reliable borders" was simply a justification for the seizure of 
Arab land. Similarly, Kudryavtsev in an IZVESTIYA article on 
10 October had dismissed Israel's insistence on secure frontiers 
as being only a cover for its "expansionist" policy. Kudryavtsev 
had reiterated hiF.I thesis that Israel's frontiers would become

genuinely secure only when it maintained "good-neighborly 
relations" with the Arab states.. And in a 23 November IZVESTIZA 
article Kudryavtsev declared that genuine security for Israel 
could be insured only by guaranteeing the security of all 
countries and peoples of the region. 
4- Energy crisis: The Moscow radio and ITAVDA versions said the 
Secretary noted the seriousness of the energy crisis in the United 
States as a result of the Arab oil embargo and stated that economic 
pressure would not change U.S. policy in the Middle East. But 
Moscow did not pick up his remark that if "pressures" continued 
unreasonably and indefinitely, the United States would have to 
consider what countermeasures it might have to take. TAS S on 
the 24th acknowledged this remark by indirection in reporting 
from Dacca on indignation in Bangladesh over "Kissinger's 
announcement of U.S. intentions" to resort to "repressive economic 
measures" against Arab states which were seeking to liberate their 
lands. TASS also noted that a Congressional committee had 
conceded that a retaliatory U.S. embargo on grain and food exports 
would be ineffective. An Arabic-language broadcast the same day, 
citing Algerian and Lebanese press comment, said Arab public 
opinion condemned the "U.S. threat" to ban the export of grain. 
and goods to Arab countries as a countermeasure against the 
reduction of oil exports. A KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA article by 
Agaryshev on 24 November, discussing the U.S. oil supply situation, 
claimed that this "partly explains" American diplomatic activity 
in the Middle East. 
ARAB SUMMIT CONFERENCE Moscow comment in Arabic un the Algiers 
summit conference has cited the 
consolidation of Arab solidarity in political, military and 
economic cooperation as the focus of the discussions, which would 
deal among other things with future oil policy and the "Palestinian 
question." A Moscow domestic service broadcast on the 26th 
additionally noted two other agenda issues, a Middle East peace 
conference and the status of Jerusalem. As in the case rC the 
last Arab summit conference, in Rabat in December 1969, Podgornyy 
and Kosygin sent a greetings message to the pnrticipants.* 
Along the lines of Kirilenko's October Revolution anniversary 
* The Podgornyy-Kosygin message and Soviet treatment of the 1969 
sv:ilmit are discussed in the TRENDS of 24 December 1969, pages 
17-20, and of 31 December 1969, pages 19-20.

speech, the message pledged that the USSR would continue giving 
"comprehensive assistance and support" to the Arab countries, 
and again expressed Soviet readiness to contribute to the 
creation of conditions for the establishment of peace. Kosygin 
and Podgornyy repeated the standard Soviet tall for Israeli 
withd.zawal from "all" Arab territories and adhered to the usual 
formulation in supporting the Palestinians' "legitimate rights." 
In reporting the opening of the conference, TASS on the 26th 
mentioned without comment that Iraq and Libya had not sent 
delegations. Libya's absence was dismissed as of no consequence 
by former PRAVDA Middle East expert Belyayev in the weekly 
Moscow radio observers' roundtable on the 25th. He remarked 
that there was nothing new in al-Qadhdhafi's stand, since he 
had disapproved of Egyptian and Syrian strategy and tactics in 
connection with the October fighting and "remained, as it were, 
outside the framework of Arab unity" since then. 
The panelists' failure to mention Iraq undoubtedly stems from 
Soviet annoyance over Iraq's rejection of the Security Council 
cease-fire resolutions. Thus the Iraqi foreign minister, asked 
in an interview reported by Baghdad radio on 17 November about 
Soviet efforts to persuade Iraq to accept the cease-fire, replied 
that "the Soviets have-their viewpoint and we have ours on war 
and peace." He added chat "we regard them as friends who give 
every possible means of support," but do not consider them "as 
an alternative to the Arabs with regard to Arab issues." 
Perhaps not coincidentally, Moscow and Baghdad on the 27th 
announced the arrival in Iraq of a Soviet party-government 
delegation led by CPSU Central Committee Secretary Ponomarev.* 
The visit would seem to be connected both with Iraq's stance 
on a cease-fire and with Iraqi internal dissensions. Baghdad 
radio reported that at the delegation's first talks, with 
Bafth Party Deputy Secretary Saddam Husayn, the sides discussed, 
"in an atmosphere of frankness and amity," bilateral relations 
and the situation in the Middle East on which they "exchanged 
views." On the internal front, the visit may deal with recent 
reported clashes between the Iraqi Communist Party and the 
Lurdish Democratic Party; both ICP and KDP delegations have had 
talks,in Moscow this month with Ponomarev, the communists having 
* At the same time, Cairo and Moscow announced the arrival in 
Egypt on the 27th of a CPSU delegation headed by CPSU Central 
Committee candidate member Kirichenko.

also been received by Brezhnev. A TASS report on the talks with 
the Kurds indicated that the USSR was still pressing for Kurdish 
participation in the Iraqi national front established by the 
ruling Balth Party and the communists in July. 
PALESTINIAN ISSUES Moscow continues its reticence in matters 
pertaining to the Palestinians. The 
visit of a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) delegation 
to Moscow was not acknowledged until the release by TASS of a 
"communique for the press" on 26 November, two days after the 
visit ended. The communique indicated that the talks were 
again held under the umbrella of the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity 
Committee although, as in the case of PLO Chairman 'Arafat's 
August visit this year, talks were also held with "other USSR 
public organizations." The communique referred to the 
Palestinians' legitimate "national" rights, as did the Soviet-
Yugoslav communique on Tito's recent talks with Brezhnev in 
Kiev, but Moscow comment otherwise has generally avoided 
including the word "national." 
Moscow followed up the visit on the 27th by broadcasting in 
Arabic an interview with delegation leader 'Arafat, a practice 
also observed in at least his last two visits. 'Arafat called 
the talks positive and constructive and praised Soviet support 
for the Arabs whether by "passing along its experience or 
giving arms," and he particularly expressed gratitude to 
Brezhnev for "insisting on mentioning" the Palestinians' 
"legitimate rights" in the Soviet-U.S. communique on Brezhnev's 
June visit to the United States. 
Moscow has again conveyed in typical fashion its disapproval 
of the latest Palestinian hijacking. A broadcast to Great 
Britain on the 26th called attention to a PLO disclaimer of 
involvement in the hijacking of a KLM Boeing 747 out of Beirut 
on the 25th.

SOVIET BLOC ENERGY 
MOSCON, ALLIES ACKNOWLEDGE FUEL AND POWER DIFFICULTIES 
As the energy shortage grips the developed economies of the West, 
Moscow and its East European allies have coupled routine ex-
pressions of support for the Arab boycott with increasing attention 
to the status of their own energy resources. While the comment 
continues to emphasize the adequacy of oil stocks, in comparison 
with the situation in the West, there has been general acknow-
ledgement of the need for conservation measures, as well as 
announcements of energy rationing in Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria. 
Only Hungary has explicitly acknowledged dependence on Arab oil 
deliveries. 
MOSCOW Radio Moscow gratuitously reported on the 24th that 
deliveries of Soviet petroleum to Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Poland, and the GDR via the Druzhba pipeline were running 
24 hours ahead of schedule, and that the volume of such deliveries 
to these countries had increased 12 percent over last year. On 
the 17th Moscow radio had reported completion of installations 
for the second segment of the Druzhba line, which would ircrease 
annual Soviet oil deliveries to Hungary from the present 4.5 
up to 10 million tons. The report included a reminder of Budapest's 
dependence on such deliveries in stating that "Hungary produces 
only 2 million tons a year of its own oil." 
While maintaining outward calm, Moscow hastened to convene a series 
of CEMA meetings on energy problems. On the 23d Radio Moscow 
carried reports of meetings in the Soviet capital of the CEMA 
standing commissions for electric power and for peaceful use of 
atomic energy, and TASS on the 26th reported a meeting of the 
CEMA standing commission for power engineering. The reports 
included glowing accouurs of past achievements and of long-
range projects to step up fuel and power supplies to the member 
countries over the next two decades. 
The overall Soviet portrayal of a favorable domestic energy 
situation was marred only by a 13 November MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA 
report of a Moscow gorkom conference convened to discuss the 
city's power situation for the ct.ming winter. The lengthy report 
referred repeatedly to difficulties in delivering heating gas 
to Moscow homes and enterprises and stressed the "extreme" 
importance of economical use of power resources. It appeared to

rAse some possibility of future gasoline rationing in pointing 
out that 16 million liters of gasoline had already been saved 
since the start of the current five?year plan in 1971. In contrant to 
the generally somber tone of the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA article, TASS 
on the 22d reported the Soviet English?language weekly MOSCOW 
NEWS as claiming that there were plentiful stocks of natural gas 
to heat Moscow apartments this winter. 
POLAND, Warsaw's uniquely rather restrained support of the 
BULGARIA Arab cause in the recent hostilities has been followed 
by official acknowledgement of a serious energy 
shortage. On the 24th, two da:s after TRYBUNA LUDU had publicized 
a government decision to switch to coal as the future power 
base, the Polish Council of Ministers announced a series of 
restrictions on the use of liquid fuels in motor transportation, 
effective 1 December. Although the fuel rationing order was 
restricted to "official" motor vehicles, according to the Warsaw 
radio, it was "closely linked with the situation which has arisen 
lately in the world fuel market." 
The government order specified a one?third raduction in fuel 
consumption by official passenger cars, comfared with average 
monthly consumption during the first quarter of this year; a 
ban on driving on Sundays and other religious holidays; and a 
speed limit of 70 kilometers per hour for trucks and 80 for 
passenger vehicles. The order, as reported by Warsaw radio, 
called for voluntary cooperation by private passenger car 
operators, in contrast to "many countries" which have banned 
all Sunday driving. In justifying the decision, the government 
daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY on the 25th stressed that Poland imports 
all its liquid fuels and that the restrictions were designed 
to "avoid a tense situation which could affect our economy." 
Bulgaria's rationing order, announced on 21 November by the 
Ministry of Power Supply, restricted the use of electric power 
in the public sector and urged voluntary cooperation in limiting

indicated that the order was necessitated by, among other things, 
"a shortage in some liquid fuels." On the 25th the party daily 
RABOTNICHESKO DELO reported that as a followup to the rationing 
order a five?day work week and a reduction in total working 
hours would be introduced on 1 December.

HUNGARY, An article in the 17 November issue of the 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA Budapest trade union daily NEPSZAVA, reported 
by both MTI and the Budapest domestic service, 
noted that Hungary has "sufficient reserves" of gas and fuel oil 
and thdt its crude oil stocks are "about double" that of a year 
ago. The article pointed out that two-thirds of Hungary's crude 
oil comes from the Soviet Union and one-fourth from domestic 
production, with the remainder coming from Iraq Ey rail from 
Yugoslav harbors and by river from Romanian ports. The article 
said that deliveries of Iraqi oil from Syrian ports had been 
temporarily interrupted for "understandable reasons" but have 
now been resumed. 
Prague has issued a number of public denials of a general energy 
shortage. On the 24th Czechoslovak Finance Minister Rohlicek 
was quoted by CTK to the effect that there was "no danger of an 
energy crisis." A radio commentary by the Prague domestic service 
on the 22d, in ridiculing "rumors" of a sharp rise in the price 
of gasoline, noted that the price of crude had "tripled" in the 
West and that "no wonder our motorists are asking if similar trends 
will not come to our country as well." Both items were accompanied 
by doctrinaire assurances that economic cooperation with the 
Soviet Union and other socialist countries ruled out the danger 
of tuel price increases or shortages. News of the discovery of 
a new crude oil sourcc..) was reported by RUDE PRAVO on the 21st. 
The new deposit, in the Zdanice forest area of Moravia, was 
reportedly expected to produce 15 tons of petroleum per day. 
At the same time, an "especially pressing" electric power short-
age was acknowledged in a Prague domestic service commentary on 
the 14th which reported a joint meeting of the committees for 
indAstry, transport, and trade of both chambers of the Federal 
Assembly to deal with the problem. The shortage was attributed 
to shortfalls by hydroelectric plants resulting from this 
year's drought. Articles on the power shortage in the Bratislava 
PRAVDA on the 10th and in the Prague LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE on the 
13th combined demands to conserve power with assurances that 
help was forthcoming from the CEMA power grid. 
ROMANIA Bucharest's decision on fuel rationing, adopted by 
the party E.'ecutive Committee on the 13th and sub-
sequenily spelled out in decrees by the State Council and the 
Council of Ministers, was more drastic than Poland's. It re-
stricted both public and privately owned automobiles to 40 1.:ters 
of gasoline per month from 1 November through 31 March 1974 and

to 60 liters per month thereafter. Lower vehicle speed limits 
and reduced quotas for natural gas consumption in home heating 
were also imposed, and electric power consumption for public 
buildings and public lighting was cut by 50 percent. 
Romanian comment has gone no further in explaining the fuel 
shortage than to indicate that its economy is dependent on fuel 
imports which are not available in sufficient quantities. Thus, 
a commentary carried by AGERFRES on the 9th, four days prior to 
the announcement of the rationing decision, stressed that the 
country's growing electric power and industrial requirements 
demand "bigger quantitie.; of oil products, natural gases, and 
other fuel" and that "imported fuel" was a necessity. The 
large-scale drive for fuel conservation, it added, was occasioned 
by the fact that "Romania's reserves are not limitless."

SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS 
MOSCOW REPLIES TO PRC GREETING, RESTATES ITS BORDER POSITION 
In an unusual step, Moscow publicized its message of thanks to 
the Chinese for their greetings on the occasion of the October 
Revolution anniversary earlier in the month. The message was 
carrIed by TASS on 24 November and appeared in the central 
press on the 25th. Moscow normally sends individual messages 
of thanks directly to the parties concerned but publicizes 
only a generalized message to all well-wishers. This year's 
general message was Carried by TAS on 17 November. 
The Soviet message was in response to a somewhat Conciliatory 
Chinese greeting which had dropped certain provocative phrases 
used in previous years to suggest ideological backtracking on 
the part of Mo:mow.* The Chinese message had also for the 
first time referred to the border questicn, reiterating Peking's 
call to solve the issue through negotiations "under conditions 
which exclude any threat." The message echoed Chou En-lai's 
remarks on the border issue at the 10th CCP Congress in August, 
where he had also reiterated Peking's proposal that relations 
between the two countries be normalized on the basis of peaceful 
coexistence. 
While the Soviet reply is not po17mical, it breaks no new ground 
in the dispute. It reflects the posture taken in recent leadership 
statements and in earlier responses to Chou's remarks at the 
10th Congress by ,:epeating past Soviet proposals, reminding Peking 
that "concrete deeds are of decisive importance for normalizing 
relations," and implying that the next move is up to the 
Chinese. The Soviet message lists two specific proposals at 
the border talks already rejected or ignored by the Chinese--the January 
1971 nonuse of force proposal and the nonaggression treaty proposed 
in June of this year. The same day that TASS transmitted the 
Soviet message of reply, NCNA reported remarks by a Chinese 
representative at the UN which accused Moscow of "hypocritically 
proposing the nonuse of force against each other." 
The publication of the message is apparently a further attempt 
by Moscow to place its positam in the dispute in ecle best light 
possible while indicating to the Chinese that it dues not 
intend to relax its own demands for a settlement. The message 
thus conveys, in a more subtle fashion, the same assessment

of Sino-Soviet relations provided by Kosygin a few days earlier

Kosygin lamented the lack of progress in the border talks and 
obseroed pointedly that Chou's remarks at the 10th CCP Congress 
had no been backed by "real actions." He went on to call 
for suc'l action in the for of "businesslike discussion" of 
"the constructive proposals submitted by the USSR."

INDOCHINA 
FOREIGN MINISTRIES CHARGE GVN BOMBING, U.S. OVERFLIGHTS 
Alleged Saigon bombing raids on 23 November in the Katum area, 
Tay Ninh Province, prompted protests from the DRV and PRG at the 
foreign-ministry level which also reviewed alleged air attacks 
since the beginning of October. While in the past two months 
the spokesmen for thc foreign ministries have issued frequent 
protests over bombings, the current statements are the first 
at foreign-ministry level since early October, when the GVN 
carried out large-scale raids over PRG-controlled areas of Tay 
Ninh in retaliation for the communist capture of the Le Minh 
base in Pieiku Province. 
Issued on the 26th, three days after the air strikes were 
supposed to have taken place, the PRG statement termed them 
"the largest-scale bombing of the Tay Ninh liberated zone since 
28 January" and claimed that the Saigon air force killed and 
wounded "dozens of civilians, most of them women and children" 
and destroyed large amounts of civilian property. The statement 
warned that the PRG will "resolutely counter" all violations of 
the cease-fire agreement by Saigon. This was milder language than 
in the 15 October PLAF Command order, which promised to "resolutely 
counterattack" GVN forces "anywhere in appropriate form and 
with appropriate forces" for violations of the cease-fire agreement. 
The DRV statement issued on the 27th similarly described 
civilian deaths and destruction allegedly caused by Saigon's 
air attacks and characteri2ed them as "another very barbarous 
crime" and an "extremely grave Vtolation" of the Paris agreement 
and the 13 June joint communique. The DRV statement gave more 
attention than had the PRG to the alleged U.S. role as the inptigator 
of the raids. The DRV statement declared that Saigon was 
"encouraged and assisted by the United States" in carrying out 
the air attacks, and it additionally asserted that this was 
part of the "U.S.-Saigon Administration clique's sinister schme 
to systematically sabotage the ceace-fire." The PRG statement, 
while not neglecting charges of U.S. complicity, accused the 
United States only parenthetically, in its concluding paragraphs, 
of "abetting and encouraging" Saigon to violate the cease-fire. 
Aerial reconnaissance of PRG-controlled areas in Quang Tri 
Province on 21 and 24 November and of the DRV's coastal Nghe An 
Province on the 28th, reportedly conducted by SR-71 and "unmanned" 
aircraft dispatched by the United States, drew routine-level 
foreign ministry spokesmen protests from the PRO on the 24th and

t7th and from the DRV on the 28th. The three latest statements 
are virtually identical in wording and tenor to protests 
by the DRV and PRG on 19 and 21 November for alleged overflights 
at that time.* 
PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman statements on the 24th and 27th, 
like the statement of the 21s1., charged that U.S. overflights 
of PRG territory consitituted a violation of Article 4 of the 
Paris agreement, "denounced and condemned" such action, a',d 
"demanded" it be discontinued. The protest of aerial reconnaissance 
by unmanned aircraft reported in the statement of the 27th 
is the first time since 2 May that unmanned a1rcr7I]t have been 
mentioned in this regard. While the May spokesman's protest 
did not specify the type of aircraft involved, media commentary 
then described the overflight as being carried out by 
"pilotless reconnaissance aircraft." 
Tinlike earlier DRV protests of SR-71 intrusions, which clearly 
charged that North Vietnam's interior had been penetrated, 
the latest statement only asserts that U.S. aircraft "encroached 
upon . . . many areas of Nghe An." The statement repeated the standard 
charge in overflight protests that the alleged intrusion was 
in violation of Article 2 of the Paris agreement and the 
first point of the 13 June joInt communique.

statement of the 21st are discussed in the TRENDS of 21 November

PRC-PRG COMMUNIQUE SHOWS MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION 
The 21 November joint communique marking the "complete ouccess" 
of the 18-23 November Mina visit by the PRG delegation led 
by Advi:zory Council Chairman Nguyen Huu ThO reflected 
bilateral efforts to reconcile Sino-Vietnamese differences 
evident in leaders' speenhes and other authoritative pronouncements 
during the visit.* Most notably, the two sides reaffirmed 
common stands on crucial issues such as alleged U.S,-Saigon 
violations of the Paris agreement, while implicitly acknowledging 
continued Sino-Vietnamese differences by failing to mention whether 
"identical views" had been reached. This omission was a departure 
from tha last PRC-PRG communique of 1 January 1973 marking 
Foreign Minister Binh's visit to Peking. 
In contrast to Peking's silenc.e in speeches during the visit on 
the subject of alleged U.S. obstruction of the Paris agreement, 
in the communique the Chinese compensated by pointedly condemning 
Saigon violations ?with the support and connivance of the United 
States" and by demanding that Washington shoulder its "unshirkable 
responsibility for implementation of the Paris agreement." This 
was a stronger Chinese position than Peking's generalized 
express:.on of support for the Vietnamese charges in the 12 June 
1973 joint communique marking DRV party leader Le Duan's visit 
to China. In that communique Peking had blandly admonished the 
United States to respect and implement the peace accord. Peking 
enhanced its accommodation of PRG interests by offering in the 
communique its first authoritative endorsement. of recent PRG 
warnings that it would take countermeasures agaiut:t the Saigon 
viulations. Specif:!cally, the Chinese joined with the PRG 
in affirming that the South Vietnamese people are entitled to 
take "all resolute measures" to check Saigon violations, defend 
the liberated areas, and uphold the Paris agreement. 
Some PRG accommodation to the Chinese positions was evident in 
the communique's playing down of the seriousness of U.S.-Saigon 
violations. Thus, although Tho had stressed in his Peking speech 
on the 18th that the United States and Saigon had "ever more 
crudely and systematically violated many most important provisions 
of the Paris agreewmt," in the communique the PRG merely pointed

to "violation 1 of some vital provisions" by Washington and 
Saigon. This formula was even milder than that used by the DRV 
in the 12 June communique, which stated that Washington and 
Saigon had "incessantly, systematically and grossly violated 
important provisions of the agreement." Furthermore, the PRG 
side inserted in the communique more effusive praise for Chinese 
support than the DRV had in the 12 June communique, noting in 
particular that it has "always received enormous and effective 
support ond assistance" from the PRC. 
Peking pointed out "emphatically" its firm support for the South 
Vietnamese struggle for national rights, but this time avolded 
any reference to pledges of continued Chinese assistance to 
the Vietnamese struggle, pledges mentioned in both the 12 June 
and i Januar: communiques. The Chinese duly reaffirmed support 
for the PRG as the "sole authentic representative" of the 
South Vietnamese and for the PRG six-point proposal. 
Both sides' treatment of Cambodia and Laos echoed thAr 
complementing statements earlier in the visit, addi4g a demand 
that ,he United States halt its support for Lon Nol and 
interference in Cambodian internal affairs. The 12 June 
communique had sidestepped any specific demand in mentioning 
the futility of the U.S. bombing and military intervention in 
Cambodia. 
After short stays in Tientsin and Canton the PRG visitors 
departed for Hanoi on the 23d. While in Canton, Tho and Binh 
reportedly had a "friendly" meeting on the 22d with Cambodian 
Princs Sihanouk and RGNU Prime Minister Penn Nouth, and also 
met with Sihanouk's ailing mother. Penn Nouth attended a 
Canton banquet for the delegates on the evening of the 22d, 
but Sihanuuk's only ocher publicized appearance dnring the 
PRG visit was on the 23d, when he received Tho's Chinese host, 
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, who came to pay respects to the 
prince's mother. Upon arrival in Hanoi on the 23d, the PRG 
delegetes were received by the same high-ranking DRV officials 
who greeted them during their 18 November stopover on the way 
to Peking.

CHINA 
PROVINCES STRESS NEED TO FOLLOW PARTY'S RURAL POLICIES 
With the ead of the harvest season, PRC media are following 
time-honored tradition in again stressing ideological and 
capital construction tasks in rural areas for the winter. The 
uroadcasts suggest no change in current policies dealing with 
production relationships, but there seems to be increase over 
recent years in the attention devoted to Lleological struggle. 
Kirin radio on 23 November carried a CHANGCHUN DAILY commentator's 
article that criticized certain cadres for mistakes in harvest 
distribution policies which would weaken the economy and dampen 
the peasants' enthusiasm. Such criticism indicates the errors 
were "leftist" in their opposition to current PRC distribution 
policies, which stress the legi:imacy of the peasants' needs 
for gradual increases in income as production increases. The 
article noted that "efficient distribution arouses people's 
socialist enthusiasm, which in turn promotes production." 
Current production relationships were also reaffirmed by Kweichow 
in a 25 November broadcast summing up results of a provincial 
conference on afforestation. The broadcast stressed the rights 
of lower-level production teams when their resources are used 17,y 
brigades and communes, stating that when teams contribute labor 
and investment, they must receive "compensation in proportion." 
The status of production teams was also treated by Shensi radio 
or the 23d, in an attack on "erroneous tides" by rural cadres. 
The radio defended the current size of production teams in re-
calling that during the 1962 rightist surge supported by Liu 
Shac-chi, "upper levels" had requested that a brigade reduce the 
size of its teams and that the brigade had "disobeyed the persons 
sent by the upper level" in a spirit of going against the tide. 
But the article pointed out that the correct tide may sometimes 
be hidden, noting that Lin Piao in 1969, using as a pretext 
criticism of Liu's incorrect line, had interfered with the 
party's rural policies from the "ultraleft," attempting to 
"cut off the tail of private ownership."

As usual, middle level cadres are left most exposed in the 
current stress on ':ural line struggle. The Shansi provincial 
radio on the 23d carried a pointed warning to aueh cadres in 
reporting a speech by Tachai model Chen Yung-kuei, now a member 
of the Politburo, to a symposium on learning from Tachai held 
earlier this month. Chen attributed Tachai's success to its 
adherence to the party line and stated that "the failure in 
some localities to impelement policies is a great obstacle 
to 1:11e current campaign to learn from Tachai. . . . If 
polices are not implemented we cannot blame the lower level; 
the responsibility lies with the leadership." Chen demanded 
that "the county CCP committees in particular" get rid of their 
apprehensions and "implement correctly all party policies." 
Cadre apprehensions appear natural since past swings of the 
pendulum have brought severe attacks on those who implemented 
moderate policies.

NOTES 
DRV ORGANIZATION CONGRESSES: The announcement by a third DRV 
mass organization, the trade unions, that their first congress 
in more than 12 years will be held in early 1974 is further 
evidence of a return to normal organizational activity after 
the long war effort. If vh,-; pattern of 13 years ago is followed, 
the calling of three conEreszes by mass organizations suggests 
more strongly that another Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) congress 
may be in the offing. The Vietnam General Federation of Trade 
Unions will hold its third congress In mid-February, according 
to a Hanoi radio 22 November report. Earlier announcements of 
congresses included a 9 August newspaper report that the Ho 
Chi Minh Working Youth Union would hold its fourth congress in 
1974, and a 16 October directive of the VWP Central Committee 
Secretariat broadcast by Hanoi on 20 October stating that the 
Vietnam Women's Union would hold its fourth congress in 1974. 
All three of these mass organizations held their last congresses 
in Febrrary and Marh 1961, several months after the VWP's 
third and most receut congress in September 1960. 
SOVIET AMBASSADOR TO INDIA: Although Moscow has not announced 
the long-awaited appointment of a new ambassador to India, Soviet 
media reports that "USSR Ambassador" V.F. Maltsev is a member 
of Soviet party chief Brezhnev's delegation visiLirg India 
suggest that Maltsev's appointment co this post is Lriminent. 
Moscow has been searching for a suitaLle candidate since April, 
when Ambassador to India Nikolay Pegov was appc,tnted deputy 
foreign minister. Since Pegov was one of the few Soviet 
ambassadors in noncommunist countries who was a member of the 
CPSU Central Committee, Moscow and Delhi obviously wanted to 
maintain this symbolic manifestation of their close relations. 
After the long delay the two countries may have settled on 
Maltsev, a candidate member of the Central Committee who is 
presently Soviet ambassador to Finland. The tentative nature of 
this move, however, is reflected in the failure of Moscow to 
acknowledge formally that Maltsev is absent from his post in 
Helsinki.
