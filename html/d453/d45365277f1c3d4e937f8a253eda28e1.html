 minutes.
 Mr. BATTIN. Mr. Speaker, the Spe-
 cial Subcommittee on Cuba and Subver-
 sion in the Western Hemisphere, ap-
 pointed by the House Republican policy
 committee early this year to make "a
 continuing study of one of our most seri-
 ous foreign policy problems, has author-
 ized me to issue a comprehensive report.
 I have the honor to serve as chairman
 of this special committee along with the
 following members: Representative WIL-
 LIAM C. CRAMER, of Florida; Representa-
 tive E. Ross ADAIR, of Indiana; Repre-
 sentative JOHN M. ASHBROOK, of Ohio;
 Representative EDWARD J. DERWINSKI, Of
 Illinois; Representative SAMUEL L. DE-
 VINE, of Ohio; Representative DURWARD
 C. HALL, of Missouri; Representative
 CLARK MACGREGOR, of Minnesota;  and
 Representative  GARNER  E.  SHRIVER, Of
 Kansas.  '
 This committee has issued four earlier
 statements.  Its present report contains
 seven policy recommendations which the
 members of the special committee be-
 lieve to be essential for the security of
 this Nation and of our Latin American
 neighbors.
 SPECIAL SUBCOMMITTEE ON CUBA AND SUBVER-
 SION IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 One year has passed since the Cuban
 missile crisis.  At this time 1 year ago
 the momentary firmness of the Kennedy
 administration was dissolving as at least
 some Soviet missiles andmedium-range
 bombers were withdrawn from Cuba.
 Administration spokesmen unleased a
 barrage of propaganda heavy with self-
 congratulation and the assertion of the
 "inherent right of government to lie" in
 time of crisis.  And then the adminis-
 tration proceeded to sweep Cuban affairs
 under the rug.

 WE HAVE BEEN SOLD A BILL OF
 GOODS IN LATIN AMERICA
 The SPEAKER.  Under previous order
 of the House, the gentleman from Wis-
 consin [Mr. SCHADEBERGI, is recognized
 for 60 minutes.
 (Mr. SCHADEBERG asked and was
 given permission to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr.  SCHADEBERG.  Mr. Speaker,
 Latin America is of vital importance to
 the future security of the United States
 in her struggle, along with her neighbors
 to the south, against the colonialism of
 the Soviet empire.  We are facing a
 critical stage in the cold war at which
 this Government must not be found
 wanting in its determination to save not
 only our own people but the people of
 Latin America and the Caribbean from
 the totalitarian policies of a power-mad
 group of opportunists who would fasten
 their concepts of atheistic materialistic
 dictatorship  upon  the  unsuspecting
 people of the world.  While those how
 are a part of this international con-
 spiracy cry "peace" and "brotherhood of
 man," and by corruption of words claim
 only to want to save the world from eco-
 nomic chaos and nuclear holocaust, let
 it be clear that they do not and indeed
 cannot talk about freedom.  Nowhere in
 the world have the people by free elec-
 tions chosen a Communist ballot and
 likewise nowhere in the world where
 Communist tyranny has fastened itself
 upon the people have the people been
 offered a free choice to repudiate it.
 Those who are outright, active, support-
 ers of the international conspiracy to en-
 slave all humankind under their godless
 banner, claiming to want to lift human-
 ity out of the dregs into which they have
 fallen because of their innate and tena-
 cious faith in a divine Creator, would
 have us believe that all who oppose them,
 oppose people; that all who oppose their
 diabolical policies of double dealing are
 warmongers and greedy capitalists and
 imperialists.  Those who oppose them
 are rightwing extremists-are parasites
 feeding off those who work to make a
 living.
 It is because I believe that our future
 as a free nation is tied up intimately with
 the interests of our traditional and wel-
 come friends in the other Americas; it
 is because I believe that our aid to the
 people in Latin America who have be-
 come pawns on the chessboard of inter-
 November ,
 national communism, must be directed to  but whose apparent sole claim to diplo-
 the end that they can be spared the fate                                                               matic appointment was the fact that he

 course, has been the Bay of Pigs fiasco
 in Cuba, followed by the incredible
 pledge of no invasion to Castro after the
 missile crisis of 1962. But while the most
 glaring example of the failure of the poli-
 cies of this administration in Latin
 America because it is so obvious, Cuba
 is not an isolated indication of failure.
 The same forcible-feeble approach-to-
 day a threat, tomorrow a cringe-has
 characterized our policy in practically
 every Latin American situation.  At the
 end of 21/2 years of repeated and un-
 broken bungling in this hemisphere, this
 administration stands before the world
 an abject and pathetic object of confu-
 sion and retreat.
 In the case of the Dominican Republic,
 there was not the slightest excuse for the
 Kennedy administration to put its un-
 qualified support behind the Juan Bosch
 regime.  Throughout the 7 months of
 Bosch's rule, Washington. seemed to de-
 liberately blind itself to Dominican reali-
 ties.  The administration sent to the
 Dominican Republic as Ambassador a
 magazine writer, John Bartlow Martin,
 who was undoubtedly well intentioned,
 annum, than it would have paid to the pro-
 posed American lender.
 But there was worse to follow.
 It came to light that Bosch borrowed from
 the consortium an advance of $15 million,
 giving notes for the amount.  Shortly after-
 ward, these notes made their appearance in
 the money markets of various countries, as
 the head of the consortium tried to dis-
 count them.  Some of them were discounted
 by  the  General  Electric  Co.  of  London.
 Others were offered to the Lock Joint Pipe
 Co., but were refused.
 To this day, despite the repeated demand
 of the nonradical Dominican press, Bosch
 and Borda have not made an accounting of
 the $15 million.
 Yet we decided to throw the prestige
 of the United States behind the Bosch
 government.
 If Ambassador Martin had listened
 to the responsible people in the Domini-
 can Republic, instead of those in the
 narrow leftist circle, he would have
 known that a great part of the Domini-
 can population had already stamped
 Bosch unreliable from the standpoint of
 democracy and of individual as well as
 national progress. He would have known
 of the rampant corruption which was
 corroding away the confidence of the

 One evening at dinner, after they had him

 familiar relationship between old and young

 on page 280 she says:
 His [Esmond's] brand of socialism was un-
 cluttered by fine Christian sentiments, for
 like Boud he was a gifted hater, although
 unlike her he directed his venom against
 the enemies of humanity, peace and free-
 dom.
 This, Mr. Speaker, is the woman being
 defended by the so-called liberals while
 they denounced me for attempting to
 expose her.
 I said that I was not surprised at the
 New York Times or even the San Fran-
 cisco Chronicle or even the Oceanside
 (Calif.) Blade Tribune, or the El Cajon
 (Calif.) Valley News, all of which mim-
 icked each other, nor was I surprised to
 find that the Democratic Committee of
 Escondido, Calif., bought space to have
 the editorial in the New York Times
 printed in the Escondido Times Advocate
 as an advertisement.  Of course, as ex-
 pected, the Communist People's World,
 Saturday, November 2, 1963, leveled a
 typical attack upon me quoting liberally
 from the New York Times.  I was sur-
 prised to find so many solid newspapers
 in the country such as the Orange
 (Calif.) Daily News and the Daily Pilot
 (Costa Mesa, Calif.), and others, arising
 to the defense of this woman who has
 done more to destroy the soul of Amer-
 ica than almost anyone else, and I am
 wondering if, after they have the facts as
 presented here, they will continue to
 place her on a pedestal.
 When Jessica Mitford Romilly Treu-
 haft was questioned about my remarks
 in the RECORD, she dismissed them airily
 with the remark that it was nothing but
 a "red herring."  Where have I heard
 that before? As I recall, a former Presi-
 dent used that phrase concerning the
 charges brought against persons both in
 and out of the Federal Government, who
 were later convicted as spies, Commu-
 nists and traitors.
 Mr. Speaker, in my opening remarks
 I said that the charge of congressional
 immunity was hogwash, and as further
 evidence of this, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to include herewith an article ap-
 pearing in Tocsin, August 28,  1963,
 printed at Berkeley, Calif. This is only
 one of several magazine articles carrying
 similar charges.
 WRITER JESSICA MrrFORD EQUALS COMMUNIST
 DECCA TaxUHAFr
 Simon and Schuster has just published a
 new book by Okland resident, Jessica Mit-
 ford of 6411 Regent Street, entitled "The
 American Way of Death," a clever attempt to
 bury capitalist America's funeral customs.
 Absent from the superficially plausible
 case which the author makes in her sharply
 satirical lampoon are biographical data about
 Miss Mitford which could place the book's
 thesis in new perspective for the unwary
 reader.
 For Writer Jessica Mitford Is also fleece
 Treuhaft, wife of Oakland Communist law-
 yer Robert E. Treuhaft and herself an often-
 identified Communist Party member. It is as
 Deeea Treuhaft that the writer has per-
 formed her service for the Communist Party.
 Despite the book's innocent air of indig-
 nation at the purported crass commercial-
 ism of American funerals and the author's
 proposal for "grassroots" type remedies, Mrs.
 Treuhaft is no newcomer to the role of op-
 ponent of American Institutions.
 As executive secretary of the subversive
 East Bay Civil Rights Congress in the 1950's.
 she kept local law enforcement agencies busy
 with assorted cases of "police brutality" and
 "racial discrimination"-all pivoting on well-
 oiled Communist propaganda machinery and
 fully exploited by the People's World.
 One of the seemingly Innocuous solutions
 Mrs. Treuhaft proposes for the funeral prob-
 lem is organization of local memorial asso-
 ciations  which  would  provide  low-cost
 burials. Two such associations in southern
 and northern California (reported In Tocsin,
 March 8 and May 1. 1983) have strong Com-
 munist and leftwing backing.  They are the
 Bay Area Funeral Society of Berkeley and the
 Los Angeles Funeral Society.
 British-born and bred, Mrs. Treuhaft ar-
 rived In the United 9ttacs In 1939 following
 a youthful elopement to Spain with Esmond
 Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill.
 who had fought with the pro-Communist
 forces in the Spanish Civil War.
 Mrs. Treuhaft is the sister of Nancy Mit-
 ford, acid-tongued novelist always severely
 critical of the United States; Unity Freeman
 Mitford, Hitler's onetime "Nordic Goddess";
 Lady Diana Mosley, wife of Sir Oswald Mos-
 ley. England's leading Fascist; Pamela Mit-
 ford, wife of a distinguished British scientist;
 and Deborah Mitford, wife of the Duke of
 Devonshire.
 Mrs. Treuhaft's penchant for doing the
 unexpected-plus her kinship-have won her
 several treatments In Bay Area supplements,
 where her interest In leftwing politics has
 been viewed as frivolous unconventionality
 at most.  Interpreting her elopement with
 Romilly as is defiance of her rightwing back-
 ground,  the San Francisco  Examiner of
 February 19. 1981, declared, "The two self-
 avowed Communists continued their fight
 against the uppercrust society from which
 they had fled."
 REBELLIOUS DAUGHTERS
 lira. Treuhaft's service to the Communist
 movement does, In fact, seem to be motivated
 by the same kind of rebellion her other five
 sisters had demonstrated in the opposite po-
 litical direction.  "Daughters and Rebels,"
 Mrs. Treuhaft's autobiography published in
 1980, dissects the rebellious daughters and
 their indomitable drives. Even IronCommu-
 nist Party discipline, commented one of her
 readers, cannot confine a "mad Mitford" for
 very long,
 In bay area Communist circles, for example,
 Mrs. Treuhaft has always carefully associated
 with communism's upper crust. And despite
 her ability to subordinate herself to such
 short-term party goals as "police brutality"
 drives, Mrs. Treuhaft's statements have never
 been  known  to include  endorsement of
 "workers solidarity" or similar Communist
 propaganda pillars.
 A literate and amusing writer, she has
 aimed her talent for satire at even such
 sacrosanct Communist techniques as the use
 of language as a weapon In the class struggle
 (see "Fun and Games" story, this Issue).
 After Romilly was killed in World War IT,
 Mrs. Treuhaft met and married RobertTreu-
 haft while both were employees of the Office
 of Price Administration.  At about the same
 time, she became secretary of San Francisco
 Local 221 of the United Federal Workers of
 America, a Communist-dominated union.
 LABOR SCHOOL OFFICIAL
 In 1944 she assumed the post of financial
 director for the now defunct Communist
 California                                            Labor  School  at  its  Oakland
 branch.
 Lending their home for various Commu-
 nist benefits during the years that followed,
 the Treuhafts hosted an annual all-night
 party in August 1949. according to the Peo-
 ple's World of August 23.
 Most of Mrs. Treuhaft's efforts during the
 1950's were devoted to promoting the East
 Bay Civil Rights Congress. She and her sub-
 ordinates In the group won "special praise
 from Albert J. Lima  (northern California
 chairman of the Communist Party) for their
 fight against the Smith Act," the November
 23, 1951, People's World declared.
 When  the  CRC      championed  Oaklander
 Jerry Newson In a murder case In 1951, Mrs.
 Treuhaft even induced her 6-year-old son
 Nicholas. now deceased, to sell tickets for a
 Newson benefit.   The young child-whom
 the  Treuhafta  had christened  with  the
 middle name of Tito, according to the Labor
 Herald-was arrested for selling tickets.
 Together with their son Benjamin and
 daughter Constancia, the Treuhafts visted
 Hungary in the late 1950's and wrote a lauda-
 tory account of "life under socialism" for
 the People's World, February 17, 1957.
 IDENTIFIED AS RED
 An Independent-Progressive Party voter in
 1952 and 1955, Mrs. Treuhaft was identified
 as a branch and county functionary of the
 Communist Party by Dickson Hill at Decem-
 ber 1953 hearings of the House Committee
 on Un-American Activities and as a party
 member by Dr. Jack Patten, June 19, 1957.
 She was also identified at 1956 Subversive
 Activities Control Board hearings on the
 California Labor School by former Commu-
 nists William Michael Foard, who said Mrs.
 Treuhaft was an officer at San Francisco
 headquarters of the Communist Party, 942
 Market Street; Bessie Honing, who had seen
 Mrs. Treuhaft at a countywide meeting of
 the Communist Party at Garibaldi Hall;
 Sylvia G. Hill, who knew her during the early
 portion of Mrs. Hill's role as an undercover
 Communist for the FBI; Dorothy M. Jeffers,
 who identified Mrs. Treuhaft as a party
 functionary: Timothy Evans, who said she
 was a member of his section in Kameda
 County; George William Smith, who Tdenti-
 fled her as present at an officers meeting in
 Oakland.
 Fired from the San Francisco Chronicle
 staff after 3 months' work there in 1956,
 Mrs. Treuhaft nevertheless continued active
 as a journalist, Her justification of the San
 Francisco Communist led riots against the
 House Un-American Activities Committee in
 1900 was featured by the Nation magazine.
 DISINHERITED, BUT
 When the second Lord Redesdale of Great
 Britain, Mrs. Treuhaft's father, died in March
 1058, he cut his Communist daughter from
 his will.  Through a legal fluke, however,
 Mrs. Treuhaft received as a bequest Inch
 Kenneth, an island in the Hebrides and site
 of the family's ancestral castle.
 The  pYess  reported  then  that she  had
 broken with her father more than 20 years
 earlier over the Spanish Civil War question
 and  that her father  hated "leftwingers."
 Mr. Treuhaft, born in New York of Hunger-
 tan Jewish parents, ascribed her father's ac-
 tion to anti-Semitism.
 Mrs. Treubaft's more recent Communist
 activity has included picketing with the local
 Morton Sobell committee, a group seeking
 clemency for the condemned atom spy, dur-
 ing the March 1962 visit to Berkeley of Presi-

 people.  He could have listened to such
 men as. Rafael Bonilla Aybar who was
 daily reporting the expose of Bosch's
 misdeeds over the radio and in his paper,
 La Prensa Libre, to a large and growing
 audience. He would have talked to such
 a man as Don Jose Mejia who had suf-
 fered unspeakable wrongs under Trujil-
 lo and who had returned enthusiastically
 to the Republic when Bosch was elected,
 to cooperate with the new President.
 What he saw under Bosch, however, dis-
 enchanted him so completely that he
 began pouring out a stream of slashing
 attacks upon the regime in the press and
 radio.  The final weeks of Bosch saw
 Santo Domingo ringing with the voices
 of these and many other disillusioned
 former supporters.  Apparently Ambas-
 sador Martin didn't hear them.  Nor
 did he understand the significance of the
 July episode when the leaders of the
 military warned Bosch that he must
 mend his ways and clean house, or they
 would turn against him. The adminis-
 tration in  Washington was walking
 around in such a fogbank that only about
 2 weeks before Bosch's fall it induced
 the Alliance for Progress to offer Bosch
 a multimillion dollar dam project in the
 hope of beefing up his popularity.
 There was also the questionable Sasha
 Volman situation. Volman, originally a
 protege of Norman Thomas and the New
 York Socialists, had been pursuing a
 covert and mysterious game in Central
 America for several years. Former Presi-
 dent Otilio Ulate of Costa Rica described
 Volman as "one of the most dangerous
 foreigners to have arrived in Costa Rica."
 Ulate revealed that Volman "handles
 enormous sums of money, from an un-
 revealed source, collects "a large month-
 ly income, and travels every month
 to different countries in the Caribbean
 area."
 When Bosch was running for Presi-
 dent, Volman appeared in the Dominican
 Republic and attached himself to Bosch.
 He  apparently  acquired  a  strange
 ascendancy over Bosch's mind.   When
 the new President was inaugurated, he
 installed Volman as his adviser on Wash-
 ington  relations.  Volman                   convinced
 him, truthfully or untruthfully as it may
 be, that he had great influence with
 Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and Mc-
 George Bundy, who have advised the
 President on Latin American policy.
 When, in midsummer, -a situation arose in
 which strong elements began to demand
 that Ambassador Martin be replaced,
 Volman informed Bosch that he had
 phoned the White House to one of the
 President's closest  advisers and had
 saved Martin's job. Bosch believed him.
 It is true that Bosch carefully main-
 tained a pose of noncommunism during
 his Presidency. So, also, did Castro dur-
 ing the first year of his rule in Cuba.
 But actions speak louder than words.
 The OAS has received a document,
 prepared by Ambassador J. T. Bonilla
 Atiles, revealing that Dr. Miguel Angel
 Dominguez Guerra, Bosch's Minister of
 the Interior and head of the national
 police, was a "blatant" Castroite and a
 member of the Partido Socialista Popu-
 tar, a Communist front. Other top offi-
 cials in the Bosch regime whom Dr.
 Bonilla Atiles named as known Commu-
 nists or Communist sympathizers were:
 Luis del Rosairo Ceballos, Minister of
 Public Works; Miguel Angel Valazques
 Mainardi, Secretary of the Senate; Diego
 Bordas, Minister of Industry; Julio Mar-
 tinez, director of the Government 'TV-
 radio station; Ramon Alberto Ferreras
 Manual, executive in the Government
 radio network.
 It is to be wondered at, that the re-
 sponsible people of the Dominican Re-
 public felt the shadow of Castro falling
 over their nation under the rule of such
 a President?
 With such unmistakable portents sig-
 naling Bosch's certain collapse, Wash-
 ington indulged itself in its usual game
 of wishful thinking. Less than 3 weeks
 before the coup, the New York Times
 published a eulogistic article, hailing
 Bosch as "a reformer with a mission"
 and declaring that "the Bosch regime
 had the anxious blessings of the Kennedy
 administration."  So, once again the
 present administration had been per-
 suaded by its left-minded entourage tp
 go all out for a Communist-coddling
 regime whose misgovernment was so
 glaring that its own subjects were turn-
 ing from it in disgust.
 But the most disturbing phase of the
 Bosch deposition was the wailing and
 gnashing of teeth which suddenly com-
 menced at the other side of the Capitol
 when the news reached Washington.
 One distinguished Senator actually pro-
 posed that the U.S. Armed Forces should
 forcibly take Bosch back to Santo Do-
 mingo and restore him to the Presidency,
 backed by American bayonets. Another
 learned Senator bluntly proposed that
 the OAS should set a police force to stop
 future military uprisings in Latin Amer-
 lea. Think of it-an OAS army to dic-
 tate to the 20 autonomous and proud
 Latin American nations what kind of
 government they should be permitted to
 have.  And in Santo Domingo itself,
 Spencer M. King, whom Ambassador
 Martin had left behind as U.S. Charge
 d'Affaires, showed his lapse from reality
 by telling Manuel Tavares Espaillat,
 Member of the Junta, that the United
 States wanted them to place Juan Casa-
 novas Garrido in the Presidency in
 Bosch's place, as the price for recogni-
 tion.  Cassanovas was a henchman of
 Bosch and at that very time was under
 investigation by the new government on
 the charge of complicity in some mis-
 appropriations of money of Bosch's ad-
 ministration.  How could any clear-
 thinking American diplomat imagine
 that a Dominican public which had
 exiled Bosch would accept another Do-
 minican revolutionary party back in his
 place?
 Perhaps the best statement of the
 situation which confronted the Domin-
 ican people when they expelled Bosch
 was given by Brig. Gen. Miguel Atila
 Luna Perez, chief of the Dominican Air
 Forces. General Luna said:
 No one wished to dethrone the government
 of Juan Bosch.  It would have never hap-
 pened, had Mr. Bosch been true to his re-
 sponsibilities  of  maintaining  democratic
 principles and preserving internal peace.
 Such internal peace was menaced by the
 advance (which no one doubted) of Marx-
 ism-Leninism, under the protective cloak of
 a pro-Communist government which did not
 take  any  preventive  measures  against  it. -
 This  Marxist-Leninist advance   became     a
 deadly menace to the traditions of a people'
 who   are  fundamentally  democratic      and
 Christian. There was something else which
 caused our intervention, and that was the
 contant violation of the Constitution of the
 Republic, and the imminent enactment of a
 series of laws of typical communistic intent.
 Yes, we have certainly goofed in the
 Dominican Republic.  And we will goof
 again, and even more dangerously, un-
 less we quickly ask ourselves what is
 really the matter with our Latin Amer-
 ican policies.
 If the Dominican Republic, as Cuba,
 stood isolated as a failure in the admin-
 istration's policy, the incident would be
 deplorable enough.  But unfortunately
 the Dominican Republic does not stand
 alone.  The Bosch regime was merely
 one of the arches of the whole structure
 of  U.S.-imposed  "left  liberal"  gov-
 ernments which, it seems quite evi-
 dent to me, the present administration
 is trying to set up in the Americas. That
 it was an important arch is measured
 by the infuriated outcry which has aris-
 en from the Washington salesmen of
 that policy since the Dominican people
 rejected Bosch.
 It is high time we reexamine this pol-
 icy which is failing so dismally in the
 Americas.
 The strategy was defined by Adolf A.
 Berle, Jr., in 1957 in his book "Tides of
 Crisis" when he wrote that it was unim-
 portant whether a nation lives under a
 Socialist or non-Socialist government.
 What is important is that the nation
 should not live under a dictatorship.  In
 fact, a. rereading of the Berle book will
 give us a theoretical background of all
 the misbegotten ideas which President
 Kennedy apparently has accepted un-
 questioningly since he stepped into the
 White House.  Once we understand the
 basic premises on which the strategy is
 based we can understand why our coun-
 try has met failure after failure in its
 Latin American policy, and incidentally
 in its entire foreign policy.  If we would
 only view the strategy through the eyes
 of reality rather than through the rose-
 colored glasses of idealism divorced from
 reality, we could easily discover the basic
 fallacy of this strategy.     The catch in
 the whole proposal is that there is no
 real certainty that the crypto-Com-
 munists and the-Socialists-the Bosches,
 the Betancourts, the Ramon Villeda Mo-
 raleses, the Haya de la Torres, the Paz
 Estenssoros, the Arevalos-are really on
 our side, that they have actually agreed
 to play on our team.  Do we have any
 bona fide proof in fact that they are?
 Their present pretense of friendliness
 may be only a Dr. Jeykil act of expe-
 diency to get U.S. help in their struggle
 for power.  Since they share with the
 Moscow Communists a common belief in
 the Marxist picture of the world, why

 eulogize Betancourt because he is a great
 democratic leader and the foe of mili-
 tary coup d'etats.  Unfortunately, the
 record shows that Mr. Betancourt Is
 against coup d'etats only when he is not
 conducting one himself.  On October 18,
 1945. President Isaias Medina Angarita,
 who had been elected democratically In
 the election of 1941, was overthrown by
 a coup d'etat.  Who was the leader of
 this coup d'etat?  You have guessed it.
 It was Romulo Betancourt.    Betancourt
 was raised by the military to the post of
 Provisional President.  In the crypto-
 Conimunist                                                               rulebook,  the  important
 thing is who pulls off the coup.
 To get the real picture of Betancourt
 It would be revealing to consider his
 whole career in Venezuela.   Betancourt
 is one of the few men in public life who
 have ever drawn a diagram of their life
 plan.  This diagram, when we look at it,
 gives a complete refutation to the touted
 claim  that  Betancourt  Is  an  anti-
 Communist.
 At this point, a question of semantics
 faces us. If, by communism, one means
 the Khrushchev or Castro brand of
 .communism,
 communism, a very valid case can be
 out to prove that Betancourt is
 against it But never in his zigzag career
 has he ever repudiated the basic objec-
 tive of communism-a socialized society.
 Unlike Mao Tse-tung in China, like
 Enver Hoxha in Albania, but deceivingly
 like Tito in Yugoslavia, -Betancourt does
 not accept Khrushchev's method of
 reaching the Marxist goal. Right now he
 is trying, with some success, to com-
 munize Latin America, and, by mouthing
 a few democratic phrases, to hoodwink
 the United States into helping him do it.
 When did he draw his diagram?  In
 1932 and 1933, Betancourt was an exile
 in Costa Rica. By this time he had al-
 ready been a veteran of 6 years of Com-
 munist activity.  With Machado and
 Villalba he had set up an underground
 Communist movement  in  Venezuela
 while Gomez was President. He fled to
 Costa Rica, and, with Manuel Mora, he
 founded the Communist Party of Costa
 Rica. He remained a member until 1935.
 However, his keen mind began to play
 around with the Idea that communism
 could best be won in Latin America by
 detaching itself from Stalin and Moscow.
 He envisaged a nationalistic form of
 communism which would assume a dif-
 ferent and deceptive shape and name In
 each country. Already, Haya de la Torre
 in Peru had beenthinking along parallel
 lines and had launched his Peruvian
 Aprista movement, after returning from
 Moscow.
 And then Betancourt made the great-
 est mistake of his careful career. He put
 his plans down on paper.  He sent them
 In the form of letters to his Communist
 comrades who were still operating as an
 underground In Gomez's Venezuela, with
 their base in Barranquila, Colombia.
 One of those who received these letters
 was Raul Leoni, who is now Betancourt's
 candidate to succeed him as President of
 Venezuela in the December 1963 elec-
 tion.
 In these letters, he told his little band
 of disciples that Venezuela could be won
 for communism If Communists would
 only be smart enough to stop using the
 Communist label.  On January 27, 1932,
 he wrote to Valmore Rodriguez:
 should we assume that they would not
 be just as great a menace to the United
 States as Castro, once they are secure in
 power?
 Indeed, Fidel Castro is himself the
 prime exhibit of the deadly danger of
 this  Washington  attitude.   Put  into
 power originally in Cuba with American
 aid and acclamation, Castro, as late as
 his visit to Washington in April 1959.
 described himself as a "liberal" and de-
 clared in Washington that "I am going
 back to Cuba to fight the Communists."
 Then less than 2 years later on Decem-
 ber 2, 1961, he revealed to the world
 what he really was. If he declared him-
 self divorced from Khrushchev would he
 be any less Castro?  Would the people
 have any more freedom than they have
 now?  What assurance do Americans
 have that the present company of our
 Socialist and crypto-Communist allies in
 Latin America. whom the State Depart-
 ment is frantically backing, do not en-
 tertain the same Intentions of a final
 doublecross?
 Perhaps the best example of the dyna-
 mite with which we are playing in Latin
 America Is Romulo Betancourt, President
 of Venezuela.  Betancourt was Bosch's
 No. 1 sponsor in the Dominican Republic.
 During the days of their exile, Bosch
 boasts that he was Betancourt's secre-
 tary.          It is no secret that Bosch con-
 sulted  Betancourt,                 after  he  became
 President, in many of his major moves.
 There have been reports in the Domini-
 can Republic that Betancourt financed
 Bosch's electoral campaign.
 Today Betancourt is the beneficiary of
 one of the most lavish and what I con-
 sider one of the most undeserved build-
 ups in the U.S. press of any Latin Ameri-
 can of our times.  Just as we heroized
 Castro in 1958 and 1959, so the liberal
 American press has pulled out all the
 stops for Romulo. Even the usually con-
 servative Readers Digest has joined the
 "amen" chorus and has twice published
 glowing panegyrics of the Venezuelan
 President. It was most unfortunate that
 at the height of the whole buildup. Presi-
 dent Kennedy greeted Betancourt at the
 White House last November with the
 words :
 You are the kind of President the United
 States wants in Latin America.
 For all the evidence indicates that
 Romulo Betancourt has put over on the
 American people, one of the most colos-
 sal hoaxes ever perpetrated.  It  is a
 hoax which he has maintained, in vary-
 ing forms, for a quarter of a century.
 For years, despite all his astute efforts to
 entice the United States to help him to
 get and hold control of Venezuela, we
 refused to bite.  It has remained for the
 present administration to fall for him,
 boots, baggage, and money.  Today, not
 only are we helping him to hold Vene-
 zuela, we are also urging him to extend
 his influence over other strategic points
 of Latin America.  We are accepting
 him, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, in
 the face of one of the longest and most
 subversive Communist records in Latin
 American history.
 One of the minor absurdities of our"
 times is to hear one of our misinformed
 American liberal friends stand up and
 We _ already know how those people fear
 the aforesaid little word (communism). And
 with vaseline we may be able to insert into
 the people all of Marx and all of Lenin, the
 most vehement hatred of private property,
 the most intense and active desire to do
 away with the capitalistic regime without
 ever having to use this word which smells of
 sulfur-communism.
 In another letter of thesame date, he
 wrote:
 In Europe. the peasants and laborers have
 reached a atage of political intelligence which
 allows them to act as government funtion-
 aries.  But in Latin America the peasants
 and laborers haven't that level of intelli-
 gence.  Therefore, a Marxist party founded
 on that basis is doomed.  The party to form
 a high general staff to direct, and that high-
 level staff should be formed by us because
 I am confident that we will not allow a devia-
 tion until we, with our high intellectuality,
 will determine the right time has come to
 make the left turn to the extreme leftwing
 and ultimately to communism.  I derive this
 from the writings of Lenin who said: "The
 party shall follow the leader's path."  How
 about It, little brothers?  Are you of the
 same opinion as I?
 These letters would never have come
 to light, and Betancourt's life plans
 would have remained an undisclosed
 secret, had it not been for two happen-
 stances.  One was the fact that Val-
 more Rodriguez and Raul Leoni did not
 destroy the letters.  They retained them.
 And the second accident was that the
 Columbia police raided the secret Com-
 munist headquarters in Barranquilla and
 found the letters.    They turned them
 over to President Lopez Contreras of
 Venezuela.
 In 1936, President Lopez Contreras
 published the letters in full, together
 with a rogue's gallery of photos of Betan-
 court, Leoni, and Miguel Otero Silva-
 now a Betancourt senator-in an official
 Red Book.  It is the most damning evi-
 dence of the secret Communist plan of
 Betancourt that has yet been disclosed.
 The significance of these Baranquilla
 letters can be read in the subsequent
 Betancourt career.  A study of his life
 will show that he has followed almost
 faithfully the diagram which he drew
 for his disciples in the early thirties.
 Returning to Venezuela after Dictator
 Gomez's death in 1935, he carried out
 his "communism without the Communist
 name" plan by establishing a new party,
 the ORVE, which was declared illegal
 by President Lopez Contreras on the
 grounds that it was actually a Com-
 munist Party.  Later, after going under-
 ground, Betancourt established the Par-
 tido Democratico Nacional.  This, in
 turn, was illegalized, after a court action
 in which It was shown that the principal
 party leaders all were men with open
 Communist records.  With the same ele-
 ments, Betancourt then launched his
 Accion Democratica, the party through
 which he acts today. This party, as we
 have  seen, participated  with  Perez
 Jimenez In the coup d'etat which over-
 threw President Medina in 1945.                                                                                                After
 3 years of gross misrule, and communis-
 tic government, Betancourt's first ad-
 ministration was overthrown by a second
 coup d'etat In 1948, the Accion Demo-

 cratica was illegalized, and Betancourt
 went into exile.
 However, it was in. the forties that
 Betancourt made his second great politi-
 cal discovery, a discovery which he has
 coined into the minted gold of fabulous-
 political success.  That discovery was
 that if he would make a pretense of an-
 ticommunism and loudly proclaim him-
 self as a democrat, he could obtain the
 support of virtually the whole body of in-
 fluential American liberals. They would
 help him, with their press and radio con-
 nections and with their great influence in
 Washington, particularly in the State
 Department, to get back into power.
 Once restored to the Miraflores Palace in
 Caracas, he could pursue Communist
 aims while winning American plaudits
 through his -anti-Communist pose.  His
 success in his latest period is attrib-
 utable almost entirely to this astute
 strategy.
 This basic Betancourt strategy was
 disclosed in April 1955, in an article pub-
 lished in Venezuela Democratica, Betan-
 court's newspaper in exile, which was is-
 sued in Mexico during his stay in that
 country. The article was a statement of
 reasons why the Accion - Democratica
 would not accept the invitation of the
 exiled Venezuela Communist Party to go
 into a united front.. It stated that if
 they took such a course, "We would have
 to renounce, without any compensation,
 all possibility of aid from.the liberal and
 democratic sectors in the United States,
 from whom we can expect useful aid."
 This excerpt appears in the book, "Com-
 munism in Latin America,"-by Prof. R. J.
 Alexander, himself a Socialist and a
 stanch supporter of Betancourt. It is a
 frank revealment of the motivation of
 the Accion Democratica in opposing
 communism. This motivation is not an-
 ticommunism; it is cold-blooded political
 expediency.
 For over a decade, Betancourt has been
 the recipient of the most fulsome cam-
 paign of flattery by American liberals
 ever enjoyed by a Latin American ruler.
 The "liberals" have been his American
 politics.  They have shouted so loudly
 that they have impressed, the Betancourt
 virtues upon a large sector of the Ameri-
 can press, and upon the principal policy-
 making officials of the Kennedy admin-
 istration.  Today this tarnished- and
 liberal mask-wearing Venezuelan crypto-
 Communist has become the symbol to
 millions of uninformed Americans of the
 kind of . leadership which the United
 States intends to support in the Ameri-
 cas.  God help Latin America if such is
 the future which our Government has
 planned for them.      -    -
 But, someone will ask, if it is true that
 Betancourt is playing a covert false-face
 game in Venezuela, how does it happen
 that he is fighting the Castroites and the
 Communists in Venezuela? Why has he
 taken recent measures to arrest their
 leaders?  - -
 Here again we are dealing with a sit-
 uation in which Betancourt is playing
 with mirrors.
 All evidence points to the fact that
 Betancourt never wanted and never in-
 tended actually to suppress the Commu-
 nists.  Castro himself is one of Betan-
 court's -own disciples.  It has been
 charged that Betancourt intervened with
 the Colombian authorities to save Castro
 from death in Bogota in 1948 when he
 was caught redhanded participating in
 the bloody Communist uprising-Betan-
 court was then the head of the Vene=
 zuelan delegation to the OAS at the
 Bogota meeting.  It is incredulous to
 suppose that Betancourt did not know
 that Castro was a full-fledged Commu-
 nist at the time.                                                       The official leader of
 the Castro party In Venezuela, the MIR,
 is Domingo Albert Rangel. Rangel is an-
 other of Betancourt's pupils. He grew up
 in the Accion Democratica, and broke
 with Betancourt- only in 1961.  Raul
 Ramos Gimenez, leader of another pro-
 Castro group, was also one of Betan-
 court's henchmen in the Accion Demo-
 cratica until 1962.
 Even after Castro threw off the mask
 and revealed himself as a Communist,
 Betancourt continued to recognize him.
 Long after the United States had broken
 off relations with Cuba, Betancourt in-
 sisted upon continuing diplomatic rela-
 tions, breaking them off only after the
 San Jose conference in August 1960,
 when he knew he would risk Washington
 friendship-and aid-if he persisted.  -
 His suppression of the Venezuela Com-
 munists has been halfhearted and inef-
 fective. Had he wished to end commu-
 nism in Venezuela, there was a simple
 and direct way to do it. He could have
 outlawed the Communist Party, just as
 half of the other Latin American coun-
 tries have done. Betancourt has never
 resorted to this obvious measure.  All
 along there has been something unmis-
 takably two-handed about his highly
 publicized reprisals against communism
 and his failure, in every instance, to fol-
 low through. As long ago as October 15,
 1962,  Betancourt's  government  an-
 nounced that it planned to take court
 action to outlaw the Communist Party
 and the MIR.  More than 1 year later
 the action has not been taken. -
 True, he had denied them the right to
 participate in the rigged December 1963
 presidential election, but it is highly
 significant that when he came to pick
 his successor for the Presidency he gave
 the nod, not to a middle-of-the-roader,
 but to Raul Leoni, his old, and tested
 comrade of the Communist Party of the
 thirties.               -
 But it will be asked, if Betancourt is a
 part of the world Communist conspiracy,
 why did he finally give the order, late
 this summer, to arrest Machado and the
 other top leaders of the official Commu-
 nist Party? Is this not the sign that he
 has broken completely with commu-
 nism?       -
 On the surface, it would seem so. But,
 like so many other things that happen in
 the government of a crypto-Communist,
 the real story is not the one which is
 carefully fed out to friendly American
 correspondents to be bold-typed in the
 U.S. press.
 Here is the real story, as given in El
 Diario and La Prensa, New York, the
 principal Spanish language newspaper
 published in the United States.  Here is
 the story, by Felicino Jaspe, published in
 the October 30 issue:        -
 It is secretly, but well known, among im-
 portant people (in Venezula)  that Betan-
 court went on TV to announce action against
 the Communists only when he was informed
 by one of his agents within the armed forces
 that they were coming to take action.  The
 decision of the armed forces resulted from
 the assassination of two national guardsmen
 on an excursion train which was going to
 Les Teques, a- town near Caracas.     Some
 Venezuelans quoted the chief of the national
 guard as saying, "If there is no one to take
 armed action, I will do it myself."  And here
 is what all Venezuelans are saying: Betan-
 court is being forced by the military to do
 things which he does not want to do him-
 self.
 How different is this story from the
 laudatory news stories which appeared in
 the New York Times and other Betan-
 court praising papers, picturing the au-
 dacious Betancourt cracking down on the
 party Communists.  If he really wanted
 to weaken the Communists, Betancourt
 had from February 13, 1959, when he was
 inaugurated President, until midsum-
 mer, 1963, to take the logical action of
 imprisoning the Machados, Faria, and
 the other top Communist Party officials.
 For more than 4 years, he gave the
 Machados and Faria sanctuary to con-
 tinue their Communist work in Vene-
 zuela, under the alibi that they were
 members of the Senate, and hence im-
 mune to arrest.  But when the armed
 forces laid down the law to him and told
 him that he must arrest the leaders,
 Betancourt tremblingly found that he
 had the power to do so, and he acted,
 Does this seem like the course which
 would have been pursued in violence-torn
 Venezuela by a genuine anti-Communist?
 Of course, there is only one answer to
 such a question.
 It is admittedly difficult to detect mo-
 tives when one deals with men like
 Betancourt.  But taking a page from the
 late Al Smith, let us look at the record.
 Sometimes what men do speaks so loud-
 ly it drowns - out what they say. If we
 would carefully examine the record as a
 whole, it becomes convincingly clear that
 Betancourt does not actually want to
 wipe  out  communism  in  Venezuela.
 Venezuelans who have known Betancourt
 through all his twists and turns believe
 that the game he is now playing is to en-
 force the ascendancy of his Accion
 Democratica brand of communism over
 the other Communist splinter groups-
 'the Castroites of Rangel and Villalba,
 and the orthodox Moscow-affiliated Com-
 munists - of the Machado brothers.  If
 possible, he will keep the rival Commu-
 nist sects alive for future purposes, but
 right now he is trying to render them
 powerless to weaken the Betancourt
 hegemony.
 Betancourt fools American liberals be-
 cause they cannot understand the laby-
 rinthine intricacies of the trained Com-
 munist mind. They fail to see the- play
 within the play. And so, the American
 public which trusts the advice of the lib-
 erals permits itself to be betrayed by its
 own enthusiasm for the Titos, the Cas-
 tros, and the Betancourts. The day of
 revelation, in the case of Betancourt, has
 not yet come.   -
 One of the incongruities of the Wash-
 ington atmosphere today is the agonized
 pain with which our liberal brethren
 greet each setback to the crypto-Com-

 munist forces in Latin America.  Every
 reverse to the Betaneourts and the
 Bosches is greeted as an intolerable blow
 to the United States. If there Is a plan-
 ning brain in international communism,
 it could not have planned with more
 lethal shrewdness.  With the false pic-
 ture of Latin America which the Com-
 munists and Socialists have implanted in
 their minds, nonradical Americans are
 actually hailing the  gravediggers of
 Americanism as their champions in the
 Latin  American  conflict.  They  are
 lamenting the fall of the Bosches and the
 Villeda Moraleses as If it were our loss.
 Not since the days when half of our State
 Department was hailing Mao Tse-tung In
 China as a great "agrarian democrat"
 have we been so cruelly mistaken.
 But the latest development between the
 Kennedy administration and the Betan-
 court leftist regime is the information
 which has recently reached the press
 that President Kennedy has decided, in
 the event of a military uprising In Betan-
 court's Venezuela, to intervene in Betan-
 court's defense with American troops.
 The Allen-Scott report says:
 President Kennedy has definitely decided
 on that, and has so informed the State and
 Defense Departments and members of the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Presi-
 dent Romulo Betancourt also has been told
 of this momentous decision. ? ? * In prepa-
 ration  for  possible recourse  to American
 troops, the administration has already set the
 wheels in motion to get Senate backing for
 such explosive action.
 Think of what this means.  The
 United States, which timorously held
 back from intervention in Castro's Cuba
 and which argued, even before the Rus-
 sians fortified the island, that we could
 not intervene because we were pledged,
 under the Rio Pact, to take no inter-
 vention action without the agreement of
 two-thirds of the members of the OAS,
 now contemplates unilateral interven-
 tion to save a Betancourt.  The United
 States, which let great China go down
 the Communist drain, because, as we
 then argued, we could not intervene to
 save Chiang Kai-shek without United
 Nations agreement, is now ready to vio-
 late its signed agreements, for what?-
 to keep crypto-Communist Betancourt in
 power.
 Truly the Kennedy administration, If
 it attempts such a thing, will have come
 full circle in its championship of the
 left in Latin America. If we are willing
 to repudiate all our commitments under
 the Rio Pact and the Caracas Declara-
 tion for the sole purpose of perpetuating
 the rule of Romolo Betancourt in Vene-
 zuela, then statesmanship has become a
 plaything in the hands of political im-
 maturity.
 When the President of Venezuela came
 to the United States last February, I was
 one of a precious few who were willing
 to speak openly words of warning against
 all-out support of one who had not
 proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that
 he was not a part of the insidious attempt
 to infiltrate this hemisphere with the
 Marxist doctrines, so deadly to the health
 of our civilization.
 I felt then we had been sold a bill of
 goods without having had the opportu-
 nity to examine it carefully to see in it
 the true character of the pattern.
 It is understandable that those in
 policy-making positions in our Govern-
 ment were intent on finding someone,
 somewhere, upon whom they could pin
 their hopes as the Messiah of Latin
 America.  The people of the United
 Suites do have the interests of the people
 of all the Americas at heart. We want
 governments to be stabilized. We would
 like to stamp out dictatorships and il-
 literacy and poverty and corruption. We
 want others to enjoy the stability we
 have gained in our own great land.  A
 symbol of strength and leadership to the
 South was needed.  Castro's lustre had
 dimmed and in the exposure of the light
 he was seen as he is.
 "But," I ask, "just why did our State
 Department hitch its wagon to a star
 which if not the red of the Soviet Union
 is certainly not the blue symbolic of
 loyalty of leadership in the cause of
 freedom?"
 Within the past few months I have had
 contact with a teacher of science In
 Venezuela; conversations with a mem-
 ber of an honored profession; a news-
 paperman who spent nearly 15 years in
 that area and who knows Betancourt
 personally; a man who works for an
 American concern but who is neither
 Venezuelan or American; and several
 other Venezuelans who have confided to
 me that we are making a serious error
 in our support of the present Govern-
 ment of Venezuela which we trust will
 take the leadership throughout Latin
 America.
 Following my remarks last February on
 the eve of Betancourt's state visit, a news
 reporter who had spent many years in
 Latin America and who knows the Vene-
 zuelan President personally, contacted
 me by letter.  He wrote:
 You may not have all the facts but what
 you have are correct. " ' ? Romulo never
 indicated to me he had turned his back on
 communism.
 We are backing a movement In Latin
 America which claims to be opposed to
 individual  Communists  but  not  to
 communism.  Betancourt has publicly
 spoken against Castro but his policies are
 strangely in keeping with Castroism.
 Let us beware lest we support those whose
 only mission is to take control of the
 sprouting movement In the South of this
 hemisphere, who condemn all, friend and
 enemy, whom they oppose not because of
 what they believe and represent but for
 the position of power they hold which
 they want for themselves.
 It is becoming increasingly evident
 that our present policy in Latin America
 is a dismal failure. The time to change
 this policy in order to rectify our errors
 in judgment and action is now, not when
 the situation has so completely deterior-
 ated that violent action on our part would
 be required.
 However, this Venezuelan proposal is a
 crisis for the future.  The curtain raiser
 for such a course in Venezuela is the
 present effort of a small group of Sena-
 tors to stage a dress rehearsal interven-
 tion in the Dominican Republic.  If we
 execute such an Intervention, and get
 away with it, a similar step is almost
 certain in Venezuela. The irony of the
 present debate is that the very "liberal"
 voices, which are now shouting most
 clamorously for unilateral intervention,
 include some of the men who protested
 most passionately against unilateral in-
 tervention in Cuba.  Until Betancourt
 and Bosch came into danger, the whole
 kit and caboodle of this g roup were
 violent  anti-interventionists.  To  the
 liberal mind, consistency is a jewel
 only when it protects its own ideological
 friends.
 As the issues darken in the Caribbean,
 it is Juan Bosch himself who has sud-
 denly made the whole liberal effort to
 save him meaningless and dangerous to
 American security.  The familiar chant
 of the liberals to justify aid to Bosch and
 Betancourt is that we need them to lock
 the gate in their nations against Castro-
 ism.  Both Bosch and Betancourt have
 played to the American gallery by de-
 claring their last-ditch opposition to
 Castro.
 But when Bosch was taken from Santo
 Domingo to the island of Guadelupe on
 the first leg of his trip into exile, some
 strange reversal to type caused him to
 forget the lines which he was supposed
 to speak.  Reaching Guadelupe, he de-
 clared, as reported by UPI:
 This movement (the Castro movement) is
 not calling for a struggle to achieve com-
 munism, but to achieve liberty.
 Later, Bosch tried to shrug this off
 but his disclaimer is contradicted by the
 fact that Gonzalo F3cio, President of the
 Council of the OAS sharply rebuked
 Bosch for his declaration.  Facio is him-
 self considered to be a member of the
 left-liberal group in Latin America.
 There is only one conclusion which we
 can draw from this Bosch lapse into
 truth-telling.  Bosch, as his Dominican
 opponents have always maintained, has
 never actually been against Castro.  I
 am convinced that neither is Betan-
 court, Castro's old mentor.  I predict the
 day will come, to the consternation of
 the advisers who have been led to as-
 sume such unrealistic policies in Latin
 America, when Betancourt will similarly
 unmask and tell us what he really wants.
 But until that moment comes, he will
 continue, like Tito, like Sukarno, to
 fatten on our aid and our gullibility.
 While the men -around Kennedy and
 Munoz Marin In Puerto Rico are working
 frantically to bring Bosch back and to
 reimpose  him  upon  the  Dominican
 people, Bosch himself has drawn a pic-
 ture of the future which he and his kind
 are  planning  for   Latin America.
 Writing in the October 14 issue of the
 New Leader, a pro-Betancourt weekly,
 he said:
 The peoples of Latin America find them-
 selves on the brink of a revolution.  It is a
 revolution that will once and for all do away
 with the power of the minority of large land-
 owners, businessmen and the upper-middle
 class of our hemisphere, and that will dispose
 of the military cliques which serve them.
 ? ? * But I fear that it will be almost im-
 possible to prevent the coming revolution in
 Latin America from being bloody, destruc-
 tive and prolonged.
 I wonder if President Kennedy with
 his propensity for the Latin American

 left, proposes to underwrite that "bloody,
 destructive and prolonged revolution."
 I wonder if that is the kind of leader-
 ship we would like to see throughout all
 Latin America.  I wonder if this is the
 future our people are paying taxes for
 through support of the Alliance for
 Progress.
 I have in this speech raised the ques-
 tion of our official all-out acceptance of
 the good faith of Betancourt and Bosch
 because the issue has a gravity which far
 outweighs our natural inclination to
 trust the judgment of our national pol-
 icymakers.
 We are fighting a cold war for the
 security of this hemisphere.  Only a few
 years ago, because we refused to face the
 deadly seriousness of this struggle, we
 indulged ourselves in the luxury of giv-
 Ing the benefit of the doubt to Fidel
 Castro.  When three former U.S. Am-
 bassadors to Cuba-Mr. Braden, Mr.
 Smith, and Mr. Gardner-warned the
 State Department that Castro's liberal-
 ism was only a masquerade and that he
 was actually an agent of the Communist
 international, the warnings were con-
 temptuously dismissed as rightist clap-
 trap.  Then, as now, we were told to join
 the hallelujah chorus and give Castro all
 our support.
 What was our reward for accepting
 this ill-advised counsel?  We have lived
 to see Cuba, under our horrified eyes,
 converted into an armed and bristling
 Russian base, frowning at us just 90
 miles away.
 Are we going to make that same mis-
 take again?
 The same kind of "gee whiz" minds
 which accepted and lionized Castro in
 1959 are now whooping up a demand for
 unlimited support for Betancourt in his
 staged contest with the Castroites.  In
 the face of his 30-year Communist and
 revolutionary record, we are being asked
 to accept him as America's Latin Amer-
 ican standardbearer against Moscow.
 If we fall into this trap, we will be in-
 viting a disaster in Latin America the
 magnitude of which will dwarf even the
 catastrophe in Cuba.  Can the United
 States afford to take that risk?  Can we
 unquestioningly accept the word of Mr.
 Schlesinger, who influences the admin-
 istration on many things including Latin
 American affairs, that the bad man of
 Venezuela's yesterday is now noble and
 admirable?  Just when and where did
 the switch take place?
 Ladies and gentlemen, I insist that
 we cannot afford to take.that gamble.
 The administration is wrong in Vene-
 zuela, just as it was wrong in Peru, in
 the Dominican Republic, and before that
 in Cuba. Let us reverse ourselves before
 we become mired in something which can
 only lead to further national humilia-
 tion and a weakening of the cause of
 freedom in the Western Hemisphere.
 In summary, the reasons for my re-
 marks today, and the sole motive be-
 hind them, are to promote the good of
 the United States and at the same time
 to aid the cause of the peoples of all
 Latin American countries--the cause of
 individual freedoms, human dignity, and
 a better way of life through democratic
 self-governments of their own choosing.
 I recognize this is a complex and mon-
 umental challenge in any one country, to
 say nothing of all those among the Latin
 American countries where genuine re-
 form is still a crying need and where
 progress has not yet had even its begin-
 nings.  I labor under no delusions that
 my lone voice will carry very far-or that
 it is powerful enough to be even a little
 effective.  But what I have had to say
 needed to be said.  It needed to be said
 because I feel that the American people
 for the most part have been getting only
 one side of the picture. It has been my
 objective here to at least let the public
 know there is another side; to state what
 in my judgment that other side in-
 eludes-both from the standpoint of
 known fact- and fair and reasonable con-
 clusion; toward the end that both the
 people at home and those elected and
 otherwise chosen to represent and serve
 them in government may better weigh
 all factors and have the benefit of all
 evidence in charting and following the
 best possible course of action throughout
 the Americas.
 THE WILDERNESS BILL
 The SPEAKER. Under previous order
 of the House, the gentleman from Penn-
 sylvania [Mr. SAYLOR] is recognized for
 45 minutes.
 Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, recently,
 on September 17, 1963, it was my privi-
 lege to be on a panel at the Los Angeles
 meeting of the American Mining Con-
 gress conducted by the esteemed chair-
 man of our Committee on Interior and
 Insular Affairs, the Honorable WAYNE
 ASPINALL of Colorado, and to have as a
 fellow member of the panel the. chair-
 man of the interior Committee's Sub-
 committee on Public Lands, the Honor-
 able WALTER BARING, of Nevada.
 The wilderness bill, with which I have
 so long been concerned, was not among
 my own assigned subjects for that day,
 but it was the full subject of Mr. BAR-
 ING's remarks and was introduced by Mr.
 ASPINALL. What they had to say about
 wilderness legislation was of keen inter-
 est to me at the time and has since in-
 fluenced me to reconsider some aspects
 of this important subject in the light of
 their remarks.
 REMARKS BY COMMITTEE AND SUBCOMMITTEE
 CHAIRMEN
 Our chairman, the gentleman from
 Colorado  [Mr. AsPINALLI, introduced
 the full texts of these addresses into the
 CONGRESSIONAL                                            RECORD  for  October  3,
 1963, where they can be found on pages
 17658 and 17659.
 Mr. ASPINALL himself made the com-
 ment that "we are continually making
 additional Members of the House of
 Representatives aware of the basic con-
 stitutional question requiring affirma-
 tive action by Congress in the designa-
 tion of wilderness areas."
 Mr. BARING assured that-and I quote
 him:
 If there Is going to be a wilderness bill,
 there will be provisions for affirmative action
 by Congress after the Chief Executive or his
 Cabinet officers have made their review and
 submitted their recommendations to Con-
 gress.
 20353
 Mr. BARING indicated that further ac-
 tion regarding the wilderness bill would
 be dependent on its proponents' being,
 as Mr. BARING put it, "willing to move
 in the direction of the compromise of-
 fered by the House committe last year."
 NEW  BILLS  PROPOSED  TO  MEET  SUGGESTIONS
 During the past weeks I have been
 pursuing these and other suggestions by
 the chairman of our committee.         With
 other proponents of the wilderness bill
 I have been working toward the develop-
 ment of a proposal that might meet the
 requirements of all concerned and thus
 merit prompt enactment.
 I am today introducing the results of
 these efforts as a new.bill, and am asking
 unanimous consent that its full text ap-
 pear at the conclusion of my remarks.
 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BY CONGRESS
 I am happy to assure my colleagues
 that this revised bill does propose and
 provide for what our chairman described
 as. "affirmative action by Congress in the
 designation of wilderness areas."
 On June 27, 1963, in a statement to the
 House-a reprint of which I later sent
 to each of my colleagues-I sought to
 indicate a willingness to meet this re-
 quirement.  On, that occasion I said-
 and I now quote:
 Let me emphasize that it is the purpose
 of advocates of the wilderness bill to see
 positive action by Congress in establishing a
 sound national wilderness preservation policy
 and a program to make this policy effective
 on the land.
 And I said further:
 Any proposals that provide for more posi-
 tive congressional action will have our'sup-
 port if they likewise iflsure the protection
 as wilderness of the areas provided for in
 the act until Congress does take further
 positive action.
 Accordingly, when I found that some
 redrafting of the wilderness bill had been
 attempted in the direction, as Mr. BAR-
 ING Put, of the House committee bill last
 year, I undertook to cooperate by adapt-
 ing and adopting this myself.
 It is this measure that I.am today in-
 troducing.
 SATISFACTION IN PROSPECTS FOR AGREEMENT
 Before describing this bill in detail
 and 'analyzing its contents, I should like
 to emphasize briefly the satisfaction
 with which I anticipate the prospect of
 agreement on a wilderness bill.
 If wilderness. is to be preserved in our
 country, it must be by the firm deter-
 mination of all who are concerned.
 The urgency for the preservation of
 some of our remaining areas of wilder-
 ness has come from all parts of the Na-
 tion.  It has been nonpartisan,  In
 enacting a measure to establish wilder-
 ness preservation as a national policy,
 we must accordingly be nonpartisan and
 nationwide in our view.
 It is especially important that those
 whose enterprises might destroy the
 wilderness be among the supporters of
 its preservation. They can see that the
 needs for which wilderness might be sac-
 rificed are met outside the wilderness.
 They can provide the consensus on
 which the preservation of wilderness in
 our culture must be based if it is to en-
 dure. .

 I would indeed be happy to see differ-
 ences regarding the wilderness bill re-
 solved and to see a prospect for its en-
 actment with a broad basis of nonparti-
 san national support.
 NEW BILL ONE ON WHICH WE CAN AGREE
 The bill I now introduce, I am con-
 vinced, is one on which we can all agree.
 The committee may find ways to improve
 it, and I shall be glad to cooperate In
 its further consideration, but essentially,
 I am satisfied; It meets the criticisms
 made against its predecessors and meets
 these in a way to merit its support.
 It is described as follows:
 DESCRIPTION OF TIIE BILL
 The revised wilderness bill (H.R. 9070)
 proposes to exercise congressional pre-
 rogatives with regard to Federal lands-
 pursuant to the Constitution's article IV,
 section 3, 2d paragraph-by taking posi-
 tive action to first establish a national
 congressional policy for the preserva-
 tion of some Federal areas as wilderness;
 second, provide a program for carrying
 out this policy through the administra-
 tion of existing wilderness within the
 national park system, within wildlife
 refuges and ranges, and within certain
 designated portions of the national for-
 ests, by the presently established agen-
 cies; and do this In such a way as to
 preserve the wilderness character of the
 lands without Interfering with their pres-
 ent purposes and without transferring
 any lands from one jurisdiction to an-
 other; and, third, make provisions to
 prevent the wilderness preservation pro-
 gram from interfering with other pro-
 grams and to provide for emergency and
 other exceptions.
 These objectives the wilderness bill
 would achieve through, first, the declara-
 tion of a national policy; second, the
 designation by Congress of wilderness
 areas; third, the provision of guidelines
 for the use and administration of the
 areas involved; and fourth, certain. other
 provisions related to gifts, bequests, con-
 tributions, inholdings, records, and re-
 ports.
 The measure requires no expenditures
 beyond those that would be called for in
 any case In administering the park, ref-
 uge, or forest lands for their presently
 established purposes.
 The bill's provisions are more fully
 yet briefly described as follows:
 First. A national policy "to secure the
 benefits of an enduring resource of wil-
 derness" by establishing wilderness areas,
 is set forth in section 2, which likewise
 includes a definition of wilderness.
 Second. The areas designated or to be
 considered for designation as wilderness
 areas are specified, and procedures for
 determining the areas to be considered
 are set up. Any lands not provided for
 in this act are to be added only by a
 subsequent act of Congress.
 Third. Guidelines for the use and ad-
 ministration of the wilderness areas are
 set forth in section 4. which says that
 nothing in the act shall interfere with
 the purposes the areas serve as park,
 refuge, or forest land but that these pur-
 poses shall be served in such a way as to
 preserve the wilderness character of the
 lands designated' as wilderness Section
 4 also prohibits certain uses Inconsistent
 with wilderness preservation and makes
 special provisions or exceptions regard-
 ing certain nonconforming uses.  The
 President is authorized to allow certain
 otherwise prohibited uses in specific
 areas of wilderness If he finds these uses
 "will better serve the interests of the
 United States and the people thereof."
 Fourth. Certain other provisions re-
 garding State and private lands within
 wilderness areas, gifts or bequests of
 land, records and reports, and contribu-
 tions are in sections 5, 6, and 7.
 EXPLANATION. SECTION BY SECTION
 An explanation of the measure, section
 by section, Is as follows :
 I
 Section 1 states the title as the "Wil-
 derness Act."
 2
 Section 2 is a statement of policy, in-
 cluding a definition.
 Section 2(a) is a statement of Con-
 gress belief that increasing population
 and human developments will occupy or
 modify all areas of the Nation except
 those set aside for preservation in their
 natural condition. It Is accordingly de-
 clared to be the policy of Congress to as-
 sure the Nation an enduring resource of
 wilderness, and for this purpose a Na-
 tional Wilderness Preservation System
 is established to be composed of appro-
 priate federally owned areas.
 Section 2(b)  defines wilderness in
 three sentences.  The first States the
 nature of wilderness in an ideal concept
 of areas where the natural community of
 life is untrammeled by man, who visits
 but does not remain.  The second sen-
 tence describes an area of wilderness as
 it Is to be considered for the purposes of
 the act-areas where man's works are
 substantially unnoticeable, where there
 is outstanding opportunity for solitude or
 a primitive or unconfined type of recrea-
 tion, and where there may also-be ecolog-
 ieal, geological, or other features of scien-
 tific, educational, scenic, or historical
 values-areas including at least 5,000
 acres and of sufficient size to make their
 preservation as wilderness practicable.
 The third sentence says that for the pur-
 poses of this act wilderness shall include
 the areas provided for in its section 2.
 Section 3 sets out the areas of Federal
 lands in national forests, in the park
 system, and in wildlife refuges and game
 ranges which-subject to existing priv-
 ate rights-are designated as wilder-
 ness areas or are to be considered for
 such designation.  A procedure is es-
 tablished that will assure review of every
 area by the executive agency In charge
 of It prior to its designation by the,Con-
 gress.  Addition of areas not specified
 In the act is limited to those established
 by later action by Congress.
 NATIONAL  FOREST   LAND6
 Section 3(a) -designates as wilderness
 areas the presently existing wilderness,
 wild, and canoe areas of the national
 forest, and sets forth requirements that
 maps and descriptions of the areas and
 regulations regarding them be available
 to the public.
 Subsections 3(a) and (b) both deal
 with national forestareas now adminis-
 tratively classified for wilderness pro-
 tection.  There are 86 of these areas,
 totaling some 14,731,471 acres (out of
 the national forest total of 186 million
 acres).                        -
 The 17 wilderness and 32 wild areas
 and the 1 canoe area have already been
 carefully reviewed by the Forest Service
 for classification as such and were clas-
 sified after having been subjected to
 public-notice and public-hearing pro-
 cedures.  Section 3(a) accordingly des-
 ignates these as wilderness areas with-
 out further review and sets forth re-
 quirements for maps and descriptions
 of them and for having maps, descrip-
 tions, and copies of notices and reports
 available to the public.  These areas
 immediately designated total 8,609,659
 acres-wilderness areas 6,409,284, wild
 1,165,523, and canoe 1,034,852.
 Section 3(b) deals with the 3 dozen
 now existing primitive areas in the na-
 tional forests, the 36 areas comprising in
 all 6,121,8.12 acres.  These areas  are
 made subject to further review, half to
 be completed in 3 years and all within 5
 years.  After the reviews by the Forest
 Service, the Secretary of Agriculture is
 to report the findings to the President
 and the President is to make recom-
 mendations regarding each area to the
 Senate and the House.  These recom-
 mendations may Include a proposed
 elimination and declassification of por-
 tions not found to be predominantly of
 wilderness value or proposed addition of
 contiguous areas of national forest lands
 that are predominantly of wilderness
 value.
 Each such recommendation will be-
 come effective only if so provided by an
 act of Congress.  The primitive areas
 are to continue in their status quo until
 Congress has acted on a presidential
 recommendation    or  has  determined
 otherwise.
 There are other national forest areas
 that are in fact wilderness but have
 never been so classified for protection as
 such.  Nothing in this bill would prevent
 the Secretary of Agriculture from con-
 sidering such  areas for preservation.
 Each area, however, will have to be the
 subject of further legislation in the fu-
 ture.                                                                                               The bill provides that-and I
 quote:
 No Federal lands shall be designated as
 "wilderness areas" except as provided for in
 this Act or by a subsequent Act.
 Section 3(c) makes a provision for
 wilderness within national park system
 areas and national wildlife refuges and
 ranges that is like that made with regard
 to primitive areas.
 The -Secretary of the Interior in this
 instance is to review the roadless por-
 tions comprising 5,000 or more acres in
 the parks and refuges and report his rec-
 ommendations to the President.
 The P,r'esident Is to advise the House
 and the Senate of his recommendations.
 An area will be given wilderness pro-
 tection on a permanent basis only if and
 when Congress so provides.  The areas
 are to be administered in status quo until
 Congress has acted on a Presidential rec-

 Through  resolutions  adopted  by  our
 Miami Reach national convention in Sep-
 tember, the American Legion has pledged
 its support and that of its members to as-
 sist the law enforcement agencies of the
 land whenever and wherever they can be of
 help.
 Basically, I believe the ? American people
 to be' patriotic, law-abiding citizens.  Yet,
 as sometimes happens in 'our zeal to protect
 our homes and families from the elements
 of lawlessness, there is ever the tendency to
 take the law into our own hands.
 This is not the type .of help I mean when
 I invite you to call upon Legionnaires to
 assist you.
 When I say use. them, I mean in the ca-
 pacity that you would seek the assistance of
 any good citizen who can be of help to you
 in your work. The American Legion is not,
 and does not propose to become an investi-
 gative  body.  This  is  the  work  of  the
 trained, professional officer, which is as it
 should be, and as the American Legion views
 it.
 I have mentioned the fact that the Amer-
 ican Legion believes extremism to be unde-
 sirable, yet in the very field in which you
 men labor there appears to be extremes of
 opinion as to how we may best cope with
 the problems of lawlessness.
 These. range from the apparent trend in
 some communities to be over. sympathetic
 to the cause of the criminal, to the opinion
 expressed in some circles that the FBI should
 be converted into a national police force, or
 that a -new agency be created as a national
 police force.
 Again, may I say.I believe it would be a
 mistake to go overboard in either direction.
 As a practicing attorney, I believe the pun-
 ishment should fit the crime, and that jus-
 tice should be administered fairly and im-
 partially.
 I believe that justice should be. admin-
 istered with logic and with reason, and tak-
 ing note of the alarming increase in major
 crimes committed by youngsters under the
 age of 18, I believe there is a pressing need
 for more effective programs of rehabilitation
 of youngsters who have gone astray.
 To be sure,  there are  the incorrigibles
 among the younger criminal element.  On
 the other hand, there are those who made a
 mistake and who, with proper guidance,
 could become useful members of society. I
 do not propose to excuse a criminal act be-
 cause of the age of the offender.  I do say
 that every effort should be made to save that
 which is salvageable.
 As  a  citizen,  I  concur  with Director
 Hoover's view that a national police force
 is neither necessary nor desirable. I believe
 that such an agency could conceivably con-
 stitute a dangerous encroachment by the
 Federal Government.
 The responsibility for proper law enforce-
 ment is primarily that of local agencies and
 of local citizens, and there the responsibility
 should  remain.  The  FBI  certainly  has
 proved its capabilities for enforcing those
 Federal laws which fall within its jurisdic-
 tion, and the cooperative effort they provide
 to local and State enforcement agencies leads
 me to believe we already have the machinery
 to do the job;
 You men of this graduating class from the
 FBI National Academy have a rare oppor-
 tunity and a significant challenge facing you
 as you return to your respective departments
 across this land in foreign countries.  Yours
 is the opportunity to help raise the stand-
 ards of performance of your fellow officers by
 imparting to them the knowledge you have
 gained here.  Yours is the challenge of in-
 suring that law and order shall prevail' in
 your respective communities.
 On behalf of the American Legion I wish
 you Godspeed in the vital mission you are
 about to assume.

 fellow classmates, ladies and gentlemen, "It
 has been said that a mail who works with his
 hands is a laborer, a man who works with
 his hands and his head is a craftsman, a man
 who works with his hands, his head and his
 heart is an artist."
 This was a quote which one of our class-
 mates came across during the extensive re-
 search which we performed in the last 12
 weeks.  It is, I think, quite appropriate for
 this occasion.
 Some of us arrived hero as laborers, others
 as  craftsmen.  Perhaps  a  few  even  ap-
 proached the status of artist.  But none had
 the knowledge and training necessary to be
 fully  competent as. laborer, craftsman or
 artist in the law enforcement profession.
 This was one of the first lessons we learned.
 So we renewed our determination to gain as
 much knowledge as possible during the 3
 months ahead of us.
 With graduation, we are beginning to re-
 alize and appreciate what these 8 months
 have meant to us.  We have learned that
 hands and head. are not enough to make us
 truly professional law enforcement officers-
 we must put our hearts into our work also.
 We realize we are just beginning to learn
 about our chosen profession.  To conclude
 that we are now totally enlightened with re-
 spect to law enforcement would be a betrayal
 of Mr. Hoover and all the people connected
 with.the FBI National Academy.  We have
 learned much, but the most important lesson
 taught us is that we must continue to study
 and work to advance ourselves and our pro-
 fession.
 I take great pleasure and pride in serving
 as the spokesman for this class to thank you,
 Mr. Hoover, for having had the foresight to
 create this Academy, to benefit all law en-
 forcement officers.   Its excellent influence
 on law enforcement has. been tremendous
 and is growing steadily.  I doubt that there
 is an officer in the United States who has not
 heard about the FBI National Academy.
 Many of them hope, as we did, to attend it,
 A number of us have been closely associated
 with officers who previously attended the
 Academy and have benefited from the knowl-
 edge they obtained. here.  But not until we
 became a part of the fellowship we have en-
 joyed in and out of class and spent the many
 long nights together in study.did we fully
 appreciate the'meaning of this Academy.
 This is one of the largest classes ever to
 be graduated.  We have had the privilege
 and honor of having 18 officers from 13 for-
 eign countries in this class: It has been en-
 couraging to learn that our fellow officers
 from other parts of the world are dedicated
 to the same principles we hold, and that they
 are striving as we are to improve their status
 and stature through proper training.  We
 enjoyed working with these men and feel
 we have established new and valued friend-
 ships which will help advance the cause of
 good law enforcement around the world. We
 also are proud of the members of our class
 who shot perfect scores on the practical pistol
 course.
 We are deeply indebted to the special
 agent counselors, to each member of the
 Academy training staff, to the visiting lec-
 turers and to all other members of the FBI
 who have given of their time, knowledge, and
 years of experience to make this Academy a
 success.
 We cannot forget the ones who were left
 behind during our stay in Washington-our
 wives and children. Without their love and
 faith, it would not have been possible to
 attend or complete this course.
 We assure you, Mr'. Hoover, and the ad-
 ministrators of our departments, that we will
 November 7
 share our knowledge with other officers and
 will strive to make law enforcement a better
 profession for ourselves and those who fol-
 low.                                                                                                 We return home knowing that the
 knowledge obtained here will enable us to
 better use our hands, our heads, and our
 hearts, and to teach others to do the same
 so that we all may become artists in our_
 profession.                         t

 matter.)
 Mr. SELDEN. Mr. Speaker, we ob-
 served last month the first anniversary of
 a crisis which brought the world to the
 threshold of nuclear disaster. A year ago,-
 our people recognized that the risk in
 Cuba was great, but so were the stakes.
 Our action was hailed by our friends,
 and our firm resolve at a time of supreme
 crisis gained for us new confidence from
 our hemispheric neighbors.  The initia-
 tive we gained last fall in this area has
 since slipped from our grasp. Fidel Cas-
 tro and his Kremlin-supported govern-
 ment remain the unfinished business of
 the hemisphere. Today we are again on
 the defensive in Latin America, where
 gnawing Castro-Communist subversive
 activities are increasing.
 Hearings conducted by the Subcom-
 mittee on Inter-American Affairs earlier
 this year indicated the scope of Commu-
 nist subversive' activities emanating from
 Cuba.  A recent three-part newspaper
 article by Mr. Charles Keely of the Cop-
 ley News Service not only "substantiates
 the findings of the subcommittee but
 reveals that Communist subversion in
 the Latin American area is being stepped
 up. Mr. Keely's articles follow:
 COMMUNISM ? IN LATIN AMERICA
 (By Charles Keely)
 (First of three articles)
 WASHINGTON.-A year ago Russia took one
 step backward and withdrew missiles from
 Cuba.  Since then, the Communists have
 taken a dozen important steps forward to-
 ward their goal of a Red takeover of Latin
 America.
 The steps are documented.  They reveal
 that  Premier  Fidel  Castro's                   Cuba  is  a
 launching pad for subversion of the West-
 ern Hemisphere.
 Today, 10 schools of guerrilla warfare and
 subversion are operating at full capacity in
 Cuba.  Last year, according to Central In-
 telligence Agency Director John McCone,
 1,600 Latin Americans received such training
 in Cuba.  More schools are being built.
 Intelligence sources estimate 20,000 secret
 Red agents can be trained this year in
 Cuba's subversion centers.
 In essence, McCone told Congress  last'
 February, "Castro   tells                     revolutionaries
 * * * `Come to Cuba;  we will pay your
 way, we will train you in underground or-
 ganization techniques, in guerrilla warfare,
 In sabotage and in terrorism.  We will see
 that you get back to' your homeland.'"
 Travel bans have not hurt Cuba's subver-
 sion school attendance, an Organization of
 American States security committee reports.
 "Despite limited means of transportation
 to Cuba today," the OAS said, "Trips to that
 country have been increasing  in  number
 during the current year."

 ADDRESS BY DANIEL F. FOLEY, NATIONAL
 COMMANDER, THE AMERICAN LEGION
 It is with great pride and pleasure that I
 come before you on this occasion which I
 know is a most significant event in the lives
 of you officers who are graduating from this
 72d session of the FBI National Academy.
 While none can foretell the total impact
 that these past 12 weeks of intensive train-
 ing may have upon your lives and careers, It
 is safe to assume that each of you will have
 benefited substantially  from  the  training
 you have received here.
 I am confident also, that your respective
 departments, your fellow officers, and your
 communities will reap abundant rewards for
 your having been here.  There is no other
 place in America where you may acquire the
 professional skills taught here, and rm sure
 there Is no place where you will find a staff
 of more experienced and expert Instructors
 In the various phases of law enforcement.
 You may take justifiable pride In the fact
 you were selected to attend this Academy for
 you were selected on the recommendation of
 your superiors, and with the endorsement of
 Director J. Edgar Hoover under whose leader-
 ship this Academy was conceived and de-
 veloped to its present high state of efficiency.
 Naturally, the training in law enforcement
 work will be the greatest single asset you will
 carry with you from  the FBI Academy.
 There are, however, certain intangibles asso-
 ciated with this experience that will serve
 you well in the years ahead.
 Important among these intangibles is the
 comradeship established as you worked and
 studied with men from 37 States and 13 for-
 eign countries-men whose chosen profes-
 sion and ultimate objectives are the same as
 yours.
 You have cultivated friendships and de-
 veloped an understanding of personalities
 and  backgrounds  entirely  different  from
 those which you encounter in your daily
 work at home.  Your associations here have
 provided you with an understanding and
 appreciation of problems peculiar to certain
 areas, and the realization that many prob-
 lems are universal.  I would urge you to
 maintain the friendships and understanding
 which have developed here, for they are
 priceless.  It was precisely this type of rela-
 tionship, developed during wartime military
 service to  our  Nation,  which led  to  the
 founding of the American Legion.
 Another, and equally important intangible
 is the espirit de corps which you must feel.
 None can be closely associated with the FBI
 without being inspired by the spirit of this
 organization.  Mr. Hoover's personal dedica-
 tion to law and order has been instilled in
 every member of the FBI and, as a result,
 this great organization has been lifted above
 the norm and into the realm of excellence.
 No organization can hope to achieve great-
 ness without members with spirit who take
 pride In their group, its work, and Its ob-
 jectives.  Thankfully, the same 23A million
 members of the American Legion are imbued
 with this same spirit and pride In the work
 which they seek to accomplish.
 The American Legion is comprised of men
 and women from all walks of life, of widely
 diversified backgrounds and interests.  They
 have a common goal, however.  Each Is dedi-
 cated to keeping this great Nation strong and
 free.
 All Legionnaires are personally aware of
 the rigors of wartime service. Many of our
 members  carry  visible reminders of  the
 armed conflicts which America has been
 forced to fight. Yet, those of us who remain
 share a common and sacred trust to perpet-
 uate the high cause of freedom which so
 many fought and died to preserve.
 When a small group of veterans of the
 American Expeditionary Force met In Paris,
 France, in 1919, to form what is now the
 American Legion, they immediately defined
 the principles and purposes for which this
 great organisation would stand -through the
 years. and which included:
 1. The creation of a fraternity based on a
 firm comradesh'p born of wartime service,
 and dedicated to the cause of equal treat-
 ment for all veterans, particularly the dis-
 abled, their wid.-)ws, and orphans.
 2. A system of national defense for Amer-
 lea, Including a program of universal mili-
 tary training which would keep this Nation
 strong and serve as a deterrent to future
 would-be aggressors.
 3. The promotion of patriotism and the
 combating of materialistic and totalitarian
 Ideologies which recognize neither the honor
 nor the dignity of man.
 Justice for the disabled was. Is, and shall
 always be a major goal of the American Le-
 gion.                                                     The achievements of the Legion in
 this area of concern is a matter of record and
 of history, but the effort continues.
 From the Legion's concern for the chil-
 dren of disabled and deceased veterans was
 born the American Legion child welfare pro-
 gram, which long since has expanded its
 scope of activity so that it now operates
 under the slogan of "A Square Deal for Every
 Child"  Since  1925,  the Legion  and  Itk
 amliated  organizations  have  contributed
 more than $185 million to this cause, rang-
 ing from direct financial assistance to the
 children of needy veterans to major con-
 tributions for research into crippling dis-
 cases and vexing problems affecting Amer-
 ica's youth.
 The success of this program through the
 years may be traced  to an alertness to
 changing concepts of child care and guid-
 ance dictated by rapidly changing social con-
 ditions.  New areas of concern for our child
 welfare program include support for more
 rigid Federal and State controls over the
 Illicit drug traffic which is a growing menace
 to our young people.  We also seek laws that
 would require reporting to the proper au-
 thorities of cases of physical abuse of chil-
 dren by adults, similar to laws now requiring
 the reporting of gunshot wounds.
 The American Legion's Intense Interest in
 national security Is a natural area of concern
 for our organization.  We have asked, and
 we continue to ask that our Nation main-
 tain defensive forces, both in men and ma-
 terial, superior to those of any potential
 enemy.  We ask that these forces be main-
 tained in the hope that they need never be
 employed-but we of the Legion believe that
 preparedness Is the key to the maintenance
 of freedom, and we believe that our best
 defense to a military potential unmatched
 throughout the world, and strongly backed
 by the patriotic and moral resources of a
 freedom -loving citizenry.
 We believe our Nation should always be
 prepared to speak from a position of strength
 to those who understand no other language.
 The validity of our position has been pain-
 fully proved.  After World War I our Na-
 tion's military strength was dissipated.  We
 were gravely unprepared to defend ourselves
 as was shown so forcefully at the time of
 the attack upon Pearl Harbor.
 Again in Korea America's citizen soldiers
 responded, and acquitted themselves nobly-
 but were we really ready?  America finally
 adopted a form of universal military train-
 ing-s,  program  long  advocated  by  the
 American Legion-and that program was
 strengthened with the enactment in 1955 of
 the national security training law. We shall
 continue to speak up on behalf of adequate
 and modern weapons and well-trained men
 as a deterrent to aggression.
 The greatest military machine in the world
 cannot prevail if America Is permitted to de-
 cay from within.  Crime and delinquency
 have an adverse Influence upon our commu-
 nities, and must be eliminated.  Further-
 more, there are powerful influences at work
 In America today intent upon destroying our
 moral strength and our dedication to the
 principles of freedom.  I Speak of the Com-
 munist Party, U.S.A., and Its various front
 groups.
 The Legion, is and always has been, a de-
 termined  foe  of  communism.  While  the
 struggle with communism has cost many lives
 In Korea, In Vietnam, and in other trou-
 bled areas of the world, the struggle here at
 home has been bloodless but no less treach-
 erous.
 Members of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,
 have used every conceivable trick and device
 In the effort to influence Americans toward
 their viewpoint, and strive constantly to
 dull Americans' sense of appreciation for
 the freedoms they enjoy and to weaken their
 will to fight to preserve them.
 Almost daily we read or hear of Commu-
 nist efforts  to  Infiltrate  our  Government
 and steal our defense secrets. The Commu-
 nists are bent on imposing their will upon
 us, and we must be as dedicated in our ef-
 forts to resist the encroachments of core-
 munism as they are to foster their false
 Ideologies.
 If our freedoms fall, that of the remainder
 of the free world will fall with us for this
 Nation is the last major barrier to the Red
 goal of world conquest.
 It is our contention, and again history has
 proved the accuracy of our stand, that the
 course of extremism, either to the right or
 to the left, is the course of failure.  To fol-
 low such a course has brought about the
 downfall of many men, of many govern-
 ments, yes, even of entire civilizations,
 It is the view of the Legion that a strong
 program of positive Americanism, strength-
 ening our basic belief in our principles and
 Ideals, Is the best answer to atheistic com-
 munism.  Through Legion-sponsored Amer-
 icanism programs, more than three-quarters
 of a million American youngsters each year
 are exposed to activities designed to give
 them a greater appreciation of our form of
 government and our way of life.
 Our Boys State and Boys Nation programs
 teach better citizenship to more than 27,000
 boys each year.  More than 122,000 young-
 sters each year learn the elements of citizen-
 ship and self-sufficiency through Legion-
 sponsored Boy Scout units.  Some 355,000
 high  school students  annually  learn  the
 meaning of our Constitution and Bill of
 Rights through preparation for the Legion's
 national high school oratorical contest, and
 a quarter of a million youngsters learn the
 rules of the game of life while playing Amer-
 ican Legion baseball each year.
 Through these programs we hope to help
 our young people grow to responsible adult
 citizenship-to  develop  strong  minds  in
 sound bodies, and to stem the tide of de-
 linquency which produces all                                                                                                                   too many
 potential criminals.
 The scope of organized crime in these
 United States has been made alarmingly
 clear to Americans in recent weeks, and Mr.
 Hoover has wisely warned that law enforce-
 ment cannot achieve total victory over the
 elements of lawfulness without the cooper-
 ation and assistance of the honest citizens
 of each community, Individually and col-
 loctively,

 Many of the students reach Cuba by slip-
 ping across the British. Honduran border in-
 to Mexico, the Cuban Student Directorate
 (DRE) has revealed.  From. islands off the
 Yucatan Peninsula, they are taken in small
 boats to a sea rendezvous with Castro's
 "fishing fleet."
 The Latins are then taken to the port of
 La Coloma, in Cuba's Pinar del Rio Prav-
 ince, and transported to the different train-
 ing camps.  Others fly or sail into Cuba from
 Communist countries.
 Castro's clumsy and unsuccessful efforts
 to invade and subvert neighboring Carib-
 bean countries during his first 9 months in
 power have been given professional guid-
 ance by trained "technicians" from the So-
 viet bloc.
 The State Department's Sterling Cottrell
 says that Reds from satellite nations today
 outnumber  Russians  in   Cuba.  Cottrell,
 Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
 America,  told  Congress August  13  that
 "Czechs, Rumanians, Bulgarians, and others"
 are in Cuba to train Latin Americans in the
 arts of modern guerrilla warfare and sub-
 version.                       The threat to the United States of
 Soviet troops in Cuba is secondary to the
 use of the island as a base to export revolu-
 tion, said Cottrell.
 "Today the Cuban effort is far more so-
 phisticated, more covert, and more deadly,"
 CIA's McCone explained.  "In its profes-
 sional tradecraft it shows guidance  and
 training by experienced Communist advis-
 ers from the Soviet bloc including veteran
 Spanish Communists."
 One Spanish Communist, Gen. Alberto
 Bayo, created the "Revolutionary Comman-
 dos for  Latin America"  (ORAL)  to  train
 Latins  to instigate  insurrections against
 their  governments.   To strengthen CRAL,
 DRE claims, Soviet Col. Jarslav Valensky in-
 stituted an International Military Command
 to control the widespread net of Commu-
 nist front groups in Latin America.
 A "supreme command" for Latin American
 guerrillas has been set up in Cuba by the
 Soviet Ministry of Defense, according to ex-
 ile intelligence sources.  Its headquarters
 are in Santiago de Cuba where guerrilla op-
 erations  throughout the  hemisphere  are
 masterminded and coordinated.
 Enrique Lister,  another Spaniard, runs
 the Minas del Frio subversion school in
 Oriente Province.    Lister, a graduate of the
 Soviet's Fruntze Military Academy, is as-
 sisted by former Guatemalan President Col.
 Jacobo Arbenz.
 At the Julio Antonio Melia School near
 Havana, Communists are training Latin la-
 bor leaders. Military personnel receive in-
 struction at the El Cortijo School in Pinar
 del Rio, the Citizens Committee for a Free
 Cuba reports.  The San Lorenzo School in
 Oriente specializes  in  guerrilla  training.
 Subversion centers are spread across the
 island.
 COMMUNISM IN LATIN AMERICA
 (By Charles Keely)
 (Second of three articles)
 WASHINGTON.-Cuban Maj. Maximo Can-
 ales left San Julien Air Base in Cuba with
 five Venezuelan terrorists trained in Pre-
 mier Fidel Castro's guerrilla warfare schools,'
 and flew over the Sari Andres Islands off the
 coast of Panama.
 The men parachuted into the water and
 were picked up by a small fishing boat which
 took them to Maracaibo, Venezuela.  Later
 they joined a  guerrilla force of the pro-
 Castro  FALN                      organization  to  wage war
 against President Romulo Betancourt.
 Subversion has replaced sugar ,as. Cuba's
 top export.
 Many of the thousands of Latin Americans
 receiving training in Cuba today are being
 parachuted  back  into  their  homelands.
 Others return to Mexico in "shrimp boats,"
 and then go home.
 According to Central Intelligence Agency
 Director John, McCone, Fidel Castro tells
 these trained subversives, "We will keep in
 touch with,you, give you propaganda sup-
 port, send you propaganda materials * *
 secret communications methods, and per-
 laps  funds  and  specialized. demolition
 equipment."
 Venezuela, says McCone, is Castro's "No. 1"
 target and FALN's sabotage "is the work of
 experts (using)  advanced types of explo-
 sives."
 McCone  told     Representative  ARMISTEAD
 SELDEN'S, Democrat, of Alabama, Foreign Af-
 fairs Subcommittee on Latin America that
 more than 200 Venezuelans received training
 in Cuba in 1962.  He said the number is
 increasing this year.
 The  1,500  Latin  Americans  who  were
 trained in Cuba last year, according to Mc-
 Cone, took courses ranging from 4 weeks to
 a year.
 They include "intensive training in sabo-
 tage, espionage, or psychological warfare."
 No country in the Western Hemisphere is
 immune to the cancer of Castro-inspired ter-
 rorism.  On November 17, 1962, the Federal
 Bureau of Investigation in New York City
 smashed a Castro-Communist plot to launch
 a series of terrorist attacks on department
 stores. The FBI reported that members of
 Cuba's United  Nations  delegation  were
 training "a corps of Cuban Communists in
 the use of explosives."
 The United States and Its Latin neighbors
 have met the Communist challenge with
 limited success.
 The Selden subcommittee recommended to
 President Kennedy that the United States
 "should be prepared to act with military
 force" to help any nation in danger of being
 overthrown by Communist subversive ag-
 gression.
 The  Organization  of  American  States
 (OAS) has  passed  numerous resolutions
 dealing with means to counter the Castro
 offensive.
 Yet, day by day the Cuban-trained terror-
 ists nibble away at this false front of anti-
 Castro hemispheric unity.
 "These wolves in sheep's clothing are the
 greatest danger ever to threaten the country,"
 explained Colombian President Guillermo
 Leon Valencia on September 25,
 . On October 2 Radio Havana warned the
 Nicaraguan  Government  "to  take  care."
 Broadcasting from Cuba, a woman identified
 as Blanca Sandino, daughter of the late Nic-
 araguan  rebel  bandit,                                                                     regularly incites
 Nicaraguans to rebel and join pro-Castro
 guerrillas whom she says already are oper-
 ating in the country,
 The Cuban Student Directorate in Exile
 claims that 100 instructors, trained in Cuba,
 have organized a Colombian guerrilla force
 of more than 1,600, broken into 13 groups in
 5 territorial areas.
 . Tony Varona, former Cuban foreign minis-
 ter and leader of the Cuban Revolutionary
 Council, told Congress that the international
 Communist movement is enlisting volunteers
 in all 19 Latin countries.  The objective, he
 said, is to build. a people's army. of 400,000
 men, 100,000 women, and 200,000 reserves to
 defend Cuba in the event of aggression,
 COMMUNISM IN LATIN AMERICA
 (By Charles Keely)
 (Last of three articles)
 WASHINGTON.-On, September 12, Cuban-
 trained Colombian rebels kidnaped wealthy
 Cattleman German Mejia Duque and held
 him for $250,000 ransom.
 During the 6 days he spent in the insur-
 gents' camp before his rescue by army troops,
 Mejia said a Cuban plane flew over the area
 and dropped weapons, propaganda and other
 material to Premier Fidel Castro's look-alike
 guerrilla leader Federico Arango Fonnegra,
 The bearded Arango told Mejia that Castro
 recently had sent him $20,000 with a warn-
 ing. that this. would be the last financial
 support he would get if his terrorists did not
 accomplish a decisive operation against the
 Government...
 Colombian. Interior Minister Aurelio Ca-
 macho Rueda; Said Castro is openly Interven-
 ing in Colombia by "sending arms and money
 from Cuba tothe bandits and the offering
 of scholarships to Colombian students  to
 study guerrilla warfare and terroristtech-
 niques in Havana."
 Twelve tons of Communist propaganda is
 discovered monthly  by Panama's customs
 authorities, according to Centeral Intelli-
 gence Agency Director John McCone.  An-
 other 10 tons comes into Costa Rica.
 "Castro is strengthening his position" in
 the wake of last October's missile crisis, says
 Costa Rican President Francisco Orlich.
 "I expect continuous, increased attempts at
 agitation here."
 Former Guatemalan President Miguel Ydi-
 goras Fuentes charged last February that
 since late 1959 Russian submarines have
 been reaching the Central American Pacific
 and Atlantic coasts to unload men and
 arms.
 Cuba has clearly become an open flood-
 gate for. a torrent of terrorists.  They flood
 a politically parched Latin America, sowing
 seeds of subversion.
 When Castro can't finance them, they turn
 to other sources of income.
 Peruvian guerrillas, teamed with "ordi-
 nary criminals," robbed a Lima bank last
 year of $100,000 and split the loot 50-50, Mc-
 Cone told a congressional subcommittee sev-
 eral months ago.
 Venezuelan pro-Castro terrorists robbed
 a bank last February of $25,000.
 "The principle that guerrillas must be
 self-sustaining his obviously been applied to
 finances," McCone explained.
 But he added that there are also involved
 bank transfers by which Cuban money even-
 tually reaches Latin American Communist-
 front groups.
 One such example was outlined here sev-
 eral Weeks ago by British Guianese Sen. Anne
 Jardim, who revealed documents showing the
 transfer of $1 million from Russia through
 Cuba to Prime Minister Cheddi Jagan, the
 Communists' best friend in South America.
 Castro sounded the keynote for Cuban sub-
 version on July 26, 1960.
 "We promise to continue making Cuba
 the example that can convert the Cordillera
 of the Andes into the Sierra Maestra of the
 American continent," he said.
 He has restated this goal on countless
 occasions, with the full blessing of Moscow
 and Peiping.
 Intelligence sources say Castro's subver-
 sive pipeline to Latin America today is his
 growing "fishing fleet."
 With the help of the Japanese, Castro has
 built an estimated 169 fishing vessels, though
 Hurricane Flora reportedly sunk 39.  These
 vessels carry their subversive cargoes be-
 tween Cuba and Latin America.
 An Organization of American States (OAS)
 security committee has reported that. this
 Communist advance in the Western Hemi-
 sphere is due mainly to the lack of informa-
 tion regarding its true aims.
 Col. Jose Luis Cruz Salazar, Guatemalan
 politician and soldier, told Congress February
 27 that the Communist menace is not specu-
 lation.
 "It is a -reality, and we must open our eyes
 to it," he said.
 THE CASE AGAINST JESSICA MIT-
 FORD, HER SUPPORTERS AND AD-

 (Mr. DTF asked and was given permis-
 sion to revise and extend his remarks
 and include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. UTT. A few weeks ago I Inserted
 some remarks in the CONGRESSIONAL Rite-
 ORD with reference to Jessica Mitford-
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, October 15, 1963,
 page A6429.  These remarks brought
 forth a hail of condemnation from the
 lethal left which quickly sprang to her
 defense with all kinds of maudlin apolo-
 gies. I was not surprised to see the edi-
 torial in the New York Times of Octo-
 ber 21, 1963, which indicated that no
 one  without  congressional  immunity
 would dare make such a statement. The
 statements which I made have been pub-
 lished in many periodicals which do not
 have congressional immunity, so that
 dodge is pure hogwash.
 In assessing the New York Times, it
 should be remembered that it was most
 laudatory in its praises of Communist
 Castro, and one of its reporters, Herbert
 Matthews, was most instrumental in
 working with our State Department en-
 voys in establishing the Communist Cas-
 tro government, and even last week Cas-
 tro praised Herbert Matthews of the
 New York Times, who is now visiting
 Cuba with his wife.  I am wondering
 how Matthews got his passport validated
 to visit Cuba, while the State Depart-
 ment has been refusing permission to
 students to visit Cuba.
 It was not my purpose then, nor is it
 now, to defend the abuses which un-
 doubtedly exist in the funeral business.
 These same abuses can be charged to
 many American businesses. In fact, ev-
 ery time I buy a new automobile I am
 persuaded to include some extras which
 are very nice, but not absolutely neces-
 sary.  Some of these extras cost more
 than the average funeral, but I did not
 have to buy them. My real purpose for
 my original remarks was that I felt that
 when CBS in its so-called documentary,
 "The Great American Funeral," was go-
 ing to bring an identified Communist
 into several million American homes, the
 public was entitled to know the identity
 of the author in order to evaluate the
 subject matter. Surely, if I wrote a book
 on the theory of relativity, the public
 would be entitled to know that I am
 neither a physicist nor a mathematician.
 and that slight credence should be given
 to me in this field.
 At this point, Mr. Speaker, I should
 mention that the rumor was broadcast
 throughout the Nation that I or my fam-
 ily owned an interest in the Fair Haven
 Cemetery at Santa Ana, Calif.  I wish
 to emphatically state that neither I nor
 any of my family now has nor ever had
 any financial interest in any cemetery
 whatsoever. I assume this rumor started
 because I was a trustee of Orange County
 Cemetery District No. 1, a public, munici-
 pal, tax-supported district, organized to
 take over and restore two abandoned
 cemeteries in which hundreds of Califor-
 nia pioneers were buried. I was a trustee,
 appointed by the Orange County Board
 of Supervisors, over a period of 20 years,
 and served without salary or expenses.
 The apologists for Jessica Mitford, also
 known as Decca Treuhaft, continue to re-
 mind the public that she wrote a "smash-
 ing hit," even though she makes the ex-
 ception appear to be the rule. May I say,
 Mr. Speaker, that there was another
 author who wrote a smashing hit. His
 name was Karl Marx, whose works today
 rank second only to the Bible in annual
 sales.  The burden of his book was an
 attack on the capitalistic free enterprise
 system and on religion, but today no one
 but Communists and Socialists rise to his
 defense. The burden of "The American
 Way of Death" is likewise a two-pronged
 attack: First, against the free enterprise
 capitalistic system enjoyed by Ameri-
 cans: second, against the funeral service
 which is basically a religious service, for
 those who have an immutable belief in
 the immortality of the soul.
 As Rev. Dr. Edgar N. Jackson, a Meth-
 odist minister, of Mamaroneck, N.Y.,
 said:
 A funeral faces the reality of death.  It
 does not avoid it.
 A funeral provides a setting wherein the
 religious needs of the bereaved may be
 satisfied.
 A funeral provides faith to sustain spirit.
 A funeral helps free one from guilt or self-
 condemnation.
 A funeral helps express one's feelings.
 A funeral directs one beyond the death of
 a loved one to the responsibilities of life.
 A funeral, in a personal way, helps one
 face a crisis with dignity and courage.
 A funeral above all provides an environ-
 ment where loving friends and relatives can
 give the help needed to face the future with
 strength and courage.
 The above-referred-to editorial in the
 New York Times indicated that Jessica
 Milford's association with Communist
 activities was in the dim and distant
 past. Let us look at the record. Jessica
 Milford, also known as Decca Treuhaft,
 was identified as a member of the Com-
 munist Party in hearings before the
 Committee on Un-American Activities,
 as follows:
 By Dickson P. Hill, an undercover agent of
 the Federal Bureau of investigation during
 his membership in the Communist Party
 (1944--49), "Investigation of Communist Ac-
 tivities In the San Francisco Area, part 2."
 December 2, 1953, page 3227.
 By Dr. Jack (Beverly Mikell)  Fatten, a
 former  member of  the  communist Party
 (1936--40 and 1946--48), "Hearings Held in
 San Francisco, Calif., June 18-21, 1957, part
 1," June 10, 1957, page 1168.
 By Dorothy M. Jeffers, an undercover agent
 of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during
 her membership in the Communist Party
 (1043-52). "Hearings Held in San Francisco,
 Calif., June 18-21. 1957, part II," June 21,
 1957, page 1295.
 Her stint before the California Senate
 Fact-Finding Committee on tin-Ameri-
 can Activities was related in my previous
 remarks, and appears on pages 260-262 of
 that committee's report to the 1953
 regular California Legislature.
 We are told that leading clergymen
 of all faiths endorse the so-called exposd.
 That may be true, but do not forget that
 many of our leaders of all faiths are
 collectivists and most of them oppose the
 House Committee on Un-American Ac-
 tivities, so they are running true to form.
 It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker,
 that one of these leaders who appeared
 on the CBS program, "The Great Ameri-
 can Funeral," Rev. Stephen Fritchman,
 has been cited by the Committee on Un-
 American Activities for his Communist-
 front affiliations and, of course, he took
 the fifth amendment.  Again, I say,
 "strange bedfellows." Reverend Fritch-
 man was also a contributor to the Com-
 munist People's World of September
 7, 1963.
 The commercial sponsor for the CBS
 colossal, "The Great American Funeral,"
 was the Travelers' Insurance Co. of
 America, which is engaged in selling in-
 surance for all contingencies, including
 death. It must have grated the Travel-
 ers' agents to watch the door-to-door
 salesmen castigated.  There is no busi-
 ness                                                                                            in  America  that  engages  more
 heavily in telephone solicitation and
 door-to-door selling than do the various
 insurance companies of America. If the
 capitalistic free enterprise system is de-
 stroyed in America, its demise is being
 gratuitously aided by the American busi-
 ness community which sponsors such
 programs.
 It might be well, Mr. Speaker, at this
 time, to examine another book of Jessi-
 ca Mitford, "Daughters and Rebels,"
 which is an autobiography, in which she
 refers to her father, who was an out-
 standing British citizen, as the missing
 link between ape and homo sapiens.
 She also admits that she was a shop-
 lifter, a "bill jumper," and that she
 bought volumes of Communist literature
 and "rigged up some homemade hammer
 and sickle flags." This book was written
 In 1960. As late as 1963, she was invited
 to be a special guest at the 25th anni-
 versary celebration of the Communist
 People's World in San Francisco.  This
 is according to People's World-the
 January 19, 1963, issue.  Whether she
 attended or not, I do not know.
 In her book, "Daughters and Rebels,"
 on page 12 In referring to her govern-
 esses, she says :
 She was soon followed by Miss Bunting,
 whose main contribution to our education
 was to teach a little mild shoplifting * * *
 Mise Bunting in her governessy beige coat
 and gloves, Boud (Jessica's sister) and I In
 matching panama straw hats, would strut
 haughtily past the deferential salespeople
 to seek the safety of Fuller's Tea Room,
 where we would gleefully take stock of the
 day's haul over cups of steaming hot choc-
 olate.
 In referring to her father on page 29,
 she writes:
 I developed the theory that he was a
 throwback to an earlier state of mankind, a
 missing link between the apes and homo
 sapiens (man).
 On page 68 she speaks of her enthu-
 siasm for communism:
 In fact, this declaration was something
 more than a mere automatic taking of op-
 posite aidesto Baud: the little I knew about
 the Fascists repelled me-their racism, super-
 militarism, brutality.  I took out a sub-
 scription to the Daily Worker, bought vol-
 umes of Communist literature and litera-
 ture that I supposed to  be  Communist,
 rigged up some homemade hammer and
 sickle flags.
 She refers to her first husband, Es-
 mond Romilly, on page 98 as follows:
 Esmond's abrupt conversion to Communist
 ideas had come about in a way very similar
 to my own.
 On page 190 she expresses her lack of
 knowledge of economics by stating:
