 6 OCTOBER 1971
 INDOCHINA
 Hanoi's observance of the 1 October PRC National Day followed the
 standard pattern with the usual congratulatory message, speeches,
 and editorial comment.  However, strains in Sino-DRV relations
 seem reflected in some of Hanoi's anniversary propaganda, just as
 they had been mirrored in its propaganda on the 211-28 September
 visit of the Li Hsien-nien economic delegation.  Both Pham Van
 Dong's speech and the anniversary message are more restrained
 than they were last year in thanking the Chinese and characterizing
 the Chinese revolutionary struggle.  The DRV congratulatory message
 uses the term "proletarian internationalism"--after Hanoi had
 studiously avoided it during Li Hsien-nien's visit--but there is
 continued evidence that the DRV remains less willing than China to
 describe their bilateral relations as based on this concept.
 Propaganda surrounding Soviet President Podgornyy's official visit
 in Hanoi stresses Soviet aid and solidarity between the two
 countries.  And Podgornyy at a banquet on the 3d pointedly said
 that the CPSU and the VWP share a common ideology which they
 defend against both revisionism and dogmatism.  Hanoi avoids
 openly polemical statements, but it does repeatedly describe
 Soviet-DRV relations as being based on proletarian internationalism.
 First Secretary Le Duan, at the meeting on the 4th, pledged that the
 Vietnamese "will exert all their energy" to strengthen relations
 with the USSR, China, and other socialist countries in crder "to
 help restore and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and the
 international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism
 and proletarian internationalism."  The reiteration of this stand
 seems particularly noteworthy against the background of Hanoi's
 polemical charges in July and August that the United States (through
 its overtures to Peking) was attempting to split the socialist
 countries.
 Hanoi a d Front media pursue standard propaganda themes in their
 reaction to the 3 October GVN presidential election.  The voting
 is dismissed as a "farce" in a statement by a PRG spokesman and in
 press and radio comment, which reaffirms communist determination to
 bring about President Thieu's overthrow and maintains that the
 election has only made his position more isolated.
 DRV PROPAGANDA ON PRC ANNIVERSARY IS STANDARD BUT RESTRAINED
 Hanoi observed PRC National Day with a "grand meeting" sponsored by
 mass organization, on 29 September, a banquet at the Chinese embassy
 on the 30th, and a NHAN DAN editorial on 1 October.  In a departure

 from the practice of previous years, DRV speeches and. the
 editorial marking the PRC anniversary all mention Soviet as
 well as Chinese aid.  Similar atypical references to Soviet
 aid were interjected in propaganda on the visit of the
 Li Hsien-nien delegation which signed the Sino-DRV aid agreement.*
 The references square with Hanoi's general effort to assume a
 scrupulously nonpartisan stance on the eve of Soviet President
 Podgornyy's arrival in Hanoi.
 Pram Van Dong's expression of thanks to the Chinese in his
 speech at the banquet this year was more reserved than his
 comments last year, when he voiced "profound gratitude" for
 China's "heartfelt support and great and valuable assistance."
 His only reference to Chinese aid this year was in a passage
 declaring that the Vietnamese have relied mainly on their own
 strength but have also "strived to win the sympathy and the
 great and precious support and assistance of the PRC, the Soviet
 Union, and the other fraternal socialist countries as well as of
 the wMnle of progressive mankind."  He also referred this year
 to Vietnamese "profound gratitude" for the Chinese people's
 "militant solidarity."
 The annual DRV message of greetings to the PRC--as usual
 addressed to Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao, and Chou En-lai and signed
 by Ton Duc Thang, Le Duan, Truoag Chinh, and Pham Van Dong--is
 .somewhat more subdued than last year's message.  It does credit
 the Chinese with achievements in "the struggle against U.S.-led
 imperialism and colonialism, and neocolonialism and for peace,
 national independence, democracy, and socialism."  But the 1970
 message was inuch more ebullient in its declaration that China
 has been "holding aloft the banner of opposition to imperialism
 headed by U.S. imperialism" and that it "has given powerful
 support to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed people
 and nations and has made tremendous contributions to the struggle
 in the whole world for peace, national independence, democracy,
 and socialism."
 The reference to proletarian internationalism in the message
 differs from last year's--a noteworthy difference against the
 recent background of Hanoi's implications that China was
 departing from this principle and the DRV's failure to respond

 in kind to Li Hsien-nien's use of the term during his visit to
 Hanoi.  This year's message maintains that the people of
 Vietnam and China have built up "an ardent love [as translated
 by VNA] among 'comrades and brothers' on the basis of
 Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."  But it
 drops the declaration in the message last year that mutual
 friendship between the two peoples had been "unceasingly
 consolidated and developed" on this basis.
 Despite this change, there seems no lack of warmth in the
 message when it refers to the "ardent love" (tinhf thawms
 thieets) of "'comrades and brothers."'  This appears to be a
 paraphrase of a line in a Ho Chi Minh poem:  "profound is the
 friendship between Vietnam and China, who are both comrades
 and brothers."  Peking's versions of the message and Hanoi's
 own Chinese-language broadcast of the greeting modify the phrase
 to conform more closely with the Ho quotation, referring to
 "profound friendship" instead of "ardent love."  The reason for
 the appearance of the. less usual term "love" in the message
 as transmitted by VNA and in Hanoi's domestic service is not
 clear.
 The DRV's current sensitivity regarding the concept of
 proletarian internationalism was also indicated by Hanoi radio's
 failure to include some remarks at the 29 September "grand
 meeting" by one Nguyen Van Huyen, a vice president of the
 Vietnam-China Friendship Association, vwhich were reported by
 NCNA.  According to NCNA, Huyen said that the Vietnamese "are
 determined to do their utmost to nurture the fraternal
 friendship and militant solidarity between our two peoples
 based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and
 have it consolidated and developed with each passing day."
 Elsewhere in his speech Nguyen Van Huyen hailed the friendship
 of the two peoples since they "came under the leadership of the
 proletarian parties," but these remarks too were reported only
 by Peking.
 PODGORNYY VISIT PROVIDES PEG FOR STRESS ON USSR-DRV SOLIDARITY
 Soviet President Podgornyy was given a top-level, warm greeting
 upon his arrival in Hanoi on 3 October, comparable to that
 accorded Kosygin in February 1965 and Chou En-lai last March.
 The entire VWP Politburo with the exception of Le Due Tho and
 the long-absent Pham Hung met him at the airport, and most of

 the Politburo members also attended the banquet that evening
 and the Hanoi rally the next day.
 r  addition to the banquet and rally, Podgornyy's activities so
 fp..r have included talks with Ton Due Thang on the 3d and with
 most of the members of the Politburo on the kith and 5th.  Moscow
 has repeatedly described the talks as being marked by "complete
 mutual understanding" and "unanimity," while Hanoi has avoided
 these characterizations.*
 TASS described Podgornyy's talks with Thang a- having taken place
 in an atmosphere of "fraternal friendship, solidarity, and
 complete mutual understanding," while VNA said they wera
 characterized by "fraternal friendship and militant solidarity."
 The talks on the 1th, according to VNA, were "permeated with
 brotherly friendship and militant solidarity."  TASS' brief
 report on the 4th did not characterize the talks, but on the 5th,
 reporting their "completion," TASS said they were held in an
 atmosphere "of brotherhood characteristic of the relations
 between the CPSU and the VWP" and that they "reaffirmed full
 unanimity and mutual understanding of the sides on all problems
 under discussion."  VNA's brief report on the 5th merely said
 that the talks "concluded successfully."  In his 4 October rally
 speech, according to VNA's text, Podgornyy said again that
 "complete mutual understanding" was manifested on "all questions
 brought up" and that "good decisions.have been reached."  Le Duan
 did not however, mention the talks in his speech on the same
 occasion.
 SOVIET AID     Both the composition of the-Soviet delegation and
 the remarks made by Podgornyy suggest that Soviet
 aid has been a major topic of discussion.  in addition to Politburo
 member Mazurov, Party Secretary Katushev, and Deputy Foreign
 Minister Firyubin, the delegation includes Vice Premier Novikov,
 who customarily signs the-annual Soviet-DRV aid agreements,
 Chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations
 Skachkov, First Deputy Minister of Defense Gen. Sokolov, and
 Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Grishin.
 *  When Le Duan met with Brezhnev on 9 May 1971, after attending
 the CPSU Congress and spending several weeks in the USSR,
 Moscow said that talks-.had taken place in an atmosphere of
 ''complete unanimity," a term Hanoi avoided.

 6 OCTOBER 1,71
 At the 4 October Hanoi rally, Podgornyy said that aid was
 discussed in the talks and added that "we take into consideration
 the fact that the war is continuing and that Vietnam needs arms,
 ammunition, and various military materials."  He also stressed
 that the further development of "economic, trade, scientific,
 and technical ties" was being discussed.  Routine Moscow comment
 on the visit reviews Soviet aid in the kind of detail that has
 become common in recent Moscow propaganda.  The current comment
 includes assertions that more than 150 industrial, agricultural,
 and other projects have been built in the DRV with Soviet
 assistance and that more than 3,000 Vietnamese trainees and
 4,000 students have received education in the USSR, with about
 10,000 Vietnamese now studying and undergoing training in the
 Soviet Union.
 Hanoi spokesmen have repeatedly expressed gratitude for Soviet
 aid and support, and a 3 October NHAN DAN editorial says
 Podgornyy's visit shows the Soviet Union's determination to
 "increase its support and assistance to the Vietnamese people."
 Le Duan at the rally was typically effusive in saying that the
 Vietnamese people "will forever engrave in their hearts the great,
 valuable, and effective support" rendered them by the party,
 government, and people of the Soviet Union.  He said nothing
 specifically about military aid but mentioned Soviet specialists
 "in great numbers" and scientists who are training Vietnamese
 scientific and technical workers.  He went on to express
 "heartfelt" sympathy for recent Soviet flood relief, thus
 paralleling the expression of thanks for Chinese flood relief
 during Li Hsien-nien's visit.
 Podgornyy in his rally speech on the 4th made a remark which
 could be construed as a slap at the Chinese stand on modern
 warfare when he said:  "You know better than anyone else that
 the modern arms and modern war materials in the skillful hands
 of the heroic combatants of the VPA, of the Vietnamese patriots,
 play an important role in delivering thunder blows at the
 aggressors."  Peking and Hanoi both profess commitment to the
 theory that men are more important than weapons, but Hanoi has
 on occasion been more willing than Peking to acknowledge the
 significant role of?idbdern weapons.  Their different approaches
 were reflected in propaganda during the Lam Son 719 operation
 earlier this year:  A 21 March PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 article, for example, hailed alleged communist successes in
 Laos as proof that "modern warfare still relies on bravery and

 political consciousness" and described battles in which the
 "patriots" used "bayonets" to wipe out "whole battalions and
 regiments" which were "armed to the teeth."  By contrast,
 Hanoi comment acknowledged the communist use of tanks and
 other modern weapons and held that the Lam Son 719 engagement
 demonstrated the importance of organizing logistics and
 technological support.
 USSR-DRV       In his 3 October banquet speech, Podgornyy made
 RELATIONS       a reference to Soviet-DRV party relations which
 seems particularly pointed against the background
 of Hanoi's implications--in its polemics during July and
 August--that China was departing from a proletarian internationalist
 path.  Expressing satisfaction with the strengthening relations
 between the CPSU and the VWP, Podgornyy said:
 We have a common ideological banner, Marxism-Leninism,
 the purity of which we have upheld and will continue to
 uphold from any attacks and revisionist or dogmatic
 distortions.  We are invariably loyal to the Leninist
 princiy,le of proletarian internationalism of which HHo
 Chi Minh, the great patriot and internationalist, was
 a convinced advocate and champion.*
 Speaking at the Hanoi rally on the Ith, Podgornyy said that "to
 support unconditionally the Vietnamese people's cause is the
 direct internationalist duty of all the revolutionary forces of
 our time.  There is every reason to say that the word Vietnam
 today sounds like an appeal for solidarity and unity."
 Vietnamese speakers repeatedly characterized Soviet-DRV
 relations as being based on "proletarian internationalism," a
 description they had been notably reluctant to use regarding
 Sino-DRV relations during the Li Hsien-nien visit.  And according
 to VNA, one of the slogans decorating the city was:  "Long live
 the unity and friendship among the socialist countries on the
 *  In a general passage in his rally speech on the lth expressing
 Soviet willingness to strengthen friendship and cooperation with
 Asian countries, Podgornyy reaffirmed Brezhnev's 24th CPSU
 Congress call for normalized relations with Peking "on the basis
 of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism"-positions
 which the Soviets maintain the Chinese leadership has abandoned.

 basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism!"
 Ton Due Thang made a similar toast at the 3 October banquet and
 called Soviet assistance to the DRV "a graphic manifestation
 of proletarian internationalism."
 Le Duan paid his usual glowing tribute to Lenin and the Soviet
 revolution and declared that the peoples of Vietnam and the
 Soviet Union "have long been closely bound together by profound
 proletarian internationalist feelings."  It was after he
 interjected expreadons of thanks for aid from China* as well as
 the Soviet Union and "other socialist countries" that he went on
 to revive the pledge to work for socialist unity:
 The Vietnam Workers Party and the Vietnamese people
 will exert all their energy to consolidate and
 strengthen their militant solidarity and their
 relations of fraternal cooperation with the Soviet
 Union, China, and the other socialist countries so
 as to help restore and strengthen the unity of the
 socialist camp and the international communist
 movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and
 proletarian internationalism.
 This is the first high-level DRV pledge to attempt to "restore"
 and strengthen socialist unity in the period since the 15 July
 announcement of the President's planned visit to Peking, which
 elicited the vitriolic anti-Chinese polemic  from Hanoi.
 During the July August period, along with the charges that the
 Nixon Doctrine was aimed at splitting the socialist countries,
 Hanoi did refer to its belief in and efforts toward socialist
 unity.  But the last previous declaration comparable to
 Le Duan's was in the 19 June 1971 DRV-Romanian communique
 at the conclusion of Ceausescu's visit.  Le Duan's assertion
 now is in contrast to Hanoi media's silence on socialist unity
 during the Japanese CP delegation's visit to Hanoi last month.**
 Ton Due Thang also mentioned Chinese as well as Soviet aid.
 This accords with Hanoi's gratuitous references to Soviet aid
 during the Li Hsien-nien visit.  Le Duan in speeches in Moscow
 has also mentioned Chinese as well as Soviet aid--at the 24th
 CPSU Congress in March 1971, the Lenin Centenary in April 1970,
 and the 23d CPSU Congress in March 1966.

 Presumably, Vhile the DRV is willing to make such a statement in
 the presence of the Soviets, it did not wish to associate itself
 in such a statement with the openly anti-Chinese Japanese CP
 delegation.
 POLITICAL      Le Duan in his speech at the rally voiced the
 SETTLEMENT     standard sentinen+, that the PRG's seven-point
 proposal, "which has the cbnplete support of the
 DRV," is "the most appropriate way" for the United States to
 get out of the war and that "the U.S. Government must give a
 positive response to this logical, reasonable proposal."  He
 did not go into the details of the proposal, saying only that
 U.S. troops must be withdrawn and that there must be "respect"
 for the South Vietnamese people's right to self'-determination.
 He concluded routinely that the United States must bear full
 responsibility for the lack of progress at the Paris talks.
 In his banquet speech on the 3d, Podgornyy, while avoiding any
 mention of President Nixon, said that the "American ruling circles'
 are stalling and undermining the Paris talk`s, resorting to
 "different political maneuvers" and refusing to accept the PRG's
 seven point proposal.*  He characterized the PRG initiative as
 "constructive," said that it opens up realistic prospects, and
 declared that the Soviet Union regards it as a good basis for a
 political settlement.  In the rally speech the next day, Podgornyy
 again briefly praised the seven point initiative as well as the
 "constructive proposals" of the DRV.
 Moscow had endorsed the 1 July PRG proposal in a PRAVDA editorial
 on 5 July--the day after PEOPLE'S DAILY'S editorial endorsement.
 It was subsequently endorsed in a statement by the Soviet trade
 union council on 13 July.

 TASS STATEMENT BELATEDLY SCORES U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST DRV
 The belated issuance on 1 October of the TASS statement denouncing
 the U.S. bombings of the DRV was apparently designed to place
 Moscow officially on record in support of the DRV before
 Podgornyy's arrival in Hanoi.  Moscow's failure to issue an
 official statement earlier on the 21 September bombings had
 been made the more conspicuous by the issuance of PRC and DPRK
 Foreign Ministry statements and of official statements by
 Sihanouk's RGNU and the NLHS.  Moscow had promptly denounced
 the 21 November 1970 raids with a TASS statement on the 23d,
 but had scored the 21-22 March 1971 strikes only in routine
 comment.
 The tardiness of the current statement is obscured by its
 denunciation of U.S. raids on DRV territory "toward the end of
 September."  It mentions that the bombings on the 21st caused
 many casualties and much destruction, but it adds that U.S.
 planes "repeatedly invaded DRV airspace" in "subsequent days."
 The statement notes that President Nixon "personally approved"
 the raids, and it once again denigrates U.S. arguments that they
 were made as "protective reaction" and that the United States
 had the "right" to make them.  Asserting that neither "barbarous
 bombings" nor "political maneuvers and diplomatic intrigues" can
 break the will of the Vietnamese people, TASS says that the
 Vietnamese people, "relying on the assistance of the Soviet Union
 and other socialist countries," will give a strong rebuff to the
 aggressor.  It reaffirms that the Soviet people condemn the
 bombings and that the USSR will continue its assistance and
 support to the Vietnamese people.

 HEAVY AIR STRIKES SCORED IN DRV COI+1UN IQUE, LE DUAN SPEECH
 Hanoi media continue to pick up foreign reports of "worldwide
 condemnation" of the intensive 21 September U.S. air strikes
 against the North.  And on 2 October the DRV War Crimes Commission
 issued a special communique  which repeated earlier allegations
 regarding civilian casualties and destruction caused by the strikes.
 First Secretary Le Duan, in his speech at the 4 October meeting
 welcoming Podgornyy, denounced the U.S. strikes by "a great number
 of aircraft" against "many areas" in language largely identical
 to that of the 22 September DRV Foreign Ministry statement.  Thus,
 he called the action "an extremely serious act of war which
 blatantly violates" the U.S. bombing halt and "an Impudent
 challenge to the peace- and justice-loving nations in the world."
 He went on to warn that Vietnam is an independent state, that
 DRV territory is inviolable--language that was not used in the
 foreign ministry statement but that did appear in supporting
 comment at the time.  Le Duan did not specify that the heavy
 strikes were on 21 September, referring instead to the attacks
 "in the last days of September"--a phrase similar to that
 contained in the belated 1 October TABS statement and perhaps
 used for that reason.
 The last available Hanoi comment on the strikes came in a brief
 VNA review of a 30 September QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article.  According
 to VNA, it complained that following the strikes on the 21st,
 U.S. aircraft continued "to reconnoiter and strafe various places
 in North Vietnam in defiance of worldwide condemnation." VNA
 also says the article denounced the dispatch of the U.S. aircraft
 carrier Enterprise "to the South China Sea close to Vietnam from
 the Indian Ocean."
 At the Paris session on the 30th,. DRV delegate Nguyen Minh
 Vy--filling in for Xuan Thuy, who reportedly had influenza--
 echoed earlier comment on the air strikes when he rejected
 "the absurd and arrogant" explanations by the Nixon Administration
 such as "protective reaction" and "defense of U.S. soldiers'
 security."  Although PRG delegate Dinh Ba Thi--again substituting
 for PRG Foreign Minister and delegation head Mme. Nguyen Thi Binh,
 who is currently on home leave--also scored the 21 September
 strikes, the VNA account did not report his remarks.

 FOREIGN MINISTRY       Hanoi radio on 5 October publicized the
 SPOKESMAN'S PROTEST    latest of the continuing statements by the
 DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman.  This one
 "severely condemned" U.S. strikes against North Vietnam from
 26 September to 3 October.  (Following the DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement on 22 September protesting the large-scale raids the
 previous day, a spokesman's protest on 27 September had scored
 U.S. strikes from 22 to 25 September.)  The current protest
 charges that U.S. aircraft, including B-52's, bombed Huong Lap
 village and that U.S. artillery "south of the DMZ and naval
 gunfire" attacked Vinh Son and Vinh Phu villages from 26 September
 to 3 October.  It says that "all these villages are located
 17 kilometers north of the demilitarized zone."  The statement
 also claims that U.S. aircraft strafed a number of villages in
 Quang Binh Province from 26 to 28 September and on 2 October.
 HANOI, FRONT HAIL "VICTORIES" IN CAMEODIAN BORDER AREA
 Communist media have given moderate attention to recent heaNy
 fighting along Highway 22 in the South Vietnamese province of
 Tay Ninh and along Highway 7 in the Krek area of Cambodia.
 Hanoi comment was highlighted by articles in NHAN DAN and QUAN
 DOI NHAN DAN on 2 October which praised alleged communist
 victories in Tay Ninh, in particular lauding a 20 September
 attack on the ARVN's Trang Lon base.  Hanoi claimed that the PLAF
 completely destroyed the base and annihilated more than 600 troops,
 and the army paper asserted that the destruction of the base
 pierced "Saigon's northwest defense line" and cut off ARVN
 elements in Cambodia from their rear.
 According to QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, the Trang Lon "victory" was
 followed by "a series of victories" along a 50-kilometer stretch
 of Highway 22.  It maintained routinely that feats in Tay Ninh,
 along with "recent and repeated victories" in the Krek area and
 elsewhere in Cambodia, have "lowered the fighting morale of the
 U.S.-puppets and will lead them from defeat to defeat."  An
 LPA commentary on the 4th similarly praised alleged achievements
 in Tay Ninh and "well-coordinated" attacks launched in the border
 area by the "Cambodian People's Liberation Army."

 PRG, HANOI ASSAIL THIEU ELECTION. PLEDGE INCREASED STRUGGLE
 The PRG officially denounced they 3 October GVN presidential
 election in a statement by a government spokesman on the 5th
 charging that the election was a "farce" which was "rigged"
 through the use of "brutal, repressive measures and brazen,
 fraudulent methods."  Dismissing Thieu's administration as a
 "bellicose and rotten ruling group" of "traitors" which is
 "fostered and commanded by the United States," the statement
 reiterated the communist position that, so long as U.S. troops
 remain in Vietnam and Thieu is in power, the South Vietnamese
 cannot exercise their right to self-determination.  Pledging
 continued struggle, the statement routinely predicted that the
 Vietnamization policy and the Nixon Doctrine will fail and
 "the traitorous ruling clique  headed by Nguyen Van Thieu will
 certainly be toppled."  The election was also condemned in a
 statement by the PRG delegation spokesman in Paris, released at
 a 4 October press conference.
 DRV First Secretary Le Duan, speaking at the 4 October meeting
 welcoming Podgornyy, also dismissed the election as a "farce" and
 went on--in the manner of other communist comment in recent
 months--to speculate on the possibility of a coup in Saigon.
 Le Duan warned:  "Let Nixon and his like be reminded that even
 though the United States had staged a similar farce to make
 Ngo Dinh Diem win with 'over 90 percent of the votes,' Diem
 could not hide his face of a traitor and finally took the
 punishment he deserved."
 A 5 October NHAN DAN article on the elections commented in this same
 vein, predicting that the election would plunge Thieu's administration
 "deeper into a crisis of disintegration" and that opposition factions
 would have even more reason to oppose him.  The article speculated
 that Thieu will "try to punish Ky" for his recent attacks and then
 observed that "Ky will certainly not let himself be subdued easily,
 nor will many other persons and organs that have firearms."  It
 added, in line with Le Duan's remark, that a tense situation will
 prevail and "a collapse of the Diem-Nhu type" may happen to Thieu.
 Prior to the election, a call for a broad struggle against Thieu and
 the United States was voiced in a letter from NFLSV Chairman Nguyen
 Huu Tho, dated the 27th and broadcast on the 29th.  The letter
 enjoined "compatriots," as an "immediate objective" of this struggle,
 to "resolutely oppose the fraudulent, deceitful election farce."
 Front media subsequently publicized a 28 September letter from Vietnam
 Alliance Chairman Trinh Dinh Thao and a statement by Alliance Vice
 Chairman Thich Don Hau which also advocated continued struggle and
 opposition to the presidential election.

 DRV ASSEMBLY DELEGATION CONCLUDES TOUR OF USSR, EAST EUROPE
 On 28 September VNA announced the return to Hanoi that day of the
 DRV National Assembly delegation led by Politburo member Hoang
 Van Moan after a tour which included "friendship visits" to
 Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the USSR.  The delegation,
 which left hrme on 18 August, made stopovers in Peking and
 Moscow before arriving in Warsaw on 23 August.  It again stopped
 in Peking from 25 to 28 September en route to Hanoi from Moscow.
 Publicity for the tour, which began at the time of Hanoi's
 shrill polemical attacks direc"ed at the PRC, has been in the
 same low key as that for a sinilar Hoan delegation visit last
 year to Bulgaria, East Germany, Albania, and Hungary.*  Thus,
 according to VNA on 30 September, the delegation reported on its
 tour to a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee
 convened on the 29th.  Following last year's pattern, the tour
 was described as having contributed to the strengthening of
 friendship and solidarity between the Vietnamese people and the
 peoples of fraternal countries "on the basis of Marxism-Leninism
 and proletarian internationalism."  Since this is s. standard
 formulation its presence here is notable only because of Hanoi's
 implication--following the 15 July announcement of the President's
 planned trip to Peking--that China was departing from a
 proletarian internationalist path.**
 PEKING        Consistent with the PRC's general effort to
 STOPOVERS     reassure the DRV during the past two months,
 Peking media reflected the warm welcome given the
 Hoan delegation during both its 18-22 August and 25-28 September
 stopovers in Peking.*** According to NCNA's report, at a banquet

 to a policy based on proletarian internationalism brought no response
 from Hanoi.  See the TRENDS of 29 September 1971, pages 1-6.  Hanoi's
 treatment of the concept in its propaganda on the 1 October PRC
 National Day is discussed above.

 hosted by Chiu Hui-ten and Kuo Mo-jo on 26 September, the two
 sides toasted the "constant strengthening and development of
 their great friendship and militant unity" and reaffirmed that
 they would always "unite, fight side by side, and win victory
 together" in the struggle against the "common enemy, U.S.
 imperialism."  NCNA described the banquet as having been held
 in a "warm atmosphere of friendship."  (NCNA somewhat more
 effusively had described a banquet during the first stopover on
 19 August as being "permehied with an atmosphere of revolutionary
 friendship between the people of China and Vietnam 'who are both
 comrades and brothers."')  Chou En-lai, as reported by NCNA,
 received the delegation on both occasions for "very cordial and
 friendly conversations."  VNA's brief reports noted only that
 Chou "warmly received" the delegation and gave no substance of
 the banquet speeches.
 MOSCOW VISIT     Hanoi and Moscow media on 24 August had briefly
 noted that on its 22-23 August stopover in the
 Soviet capital, the delegation was met at the airport and hosted
 at a banquet by Central Committee member and Chairman of the
 Soviet of the Union Shitikov.  (The Moscow stopover last year
 had also been handled at a low level; the delegation was hosted
 by Chairman of the USSR Parliamentary Group Spiridonov and went
 sightseeing in the capital.)
 During the subsequent 13 to 24 September "official friendship
 visit," the delegation toured Volgograd, Kazan and Kishinev,
 held talks with Supreme Soviet officials, was greeted at a
 Moscow meeting of "representatives of the capital's working
 people" on the 22d, and had talks with Podgornyy on the 24th.
 As reported by TASS and Moscow radio--including its Mandarin-
 language ser-,rice--Podgornyy and Hoan had a "heartfelt, friendly
 conversation" during which Podgornyy promised continued Soviet
 aid and support and Hoan expressed "profound gratitude."
 According to a Hanoi radio Vietnamese-language broadcast on the
 26th, Podgornyy also stressed that the coming visit of a soviet
 Party-Government delegation to the DRV would contribute to the
 strengthening of Soviet-DRV friendship and unity.
 The remarks at the Moscow public meeting by Vice Premier and
 Chairman of the Soviet-Vietnam Friendship Society Kalashnikov
 are not carried textually by available Soviet or DRV media.
 VNA reports that in addition to referring to the USSR's policy
 of "all-sided aid" to the Vietnamese, he noted Soviet support
 for the DRV's "correct stand" and the PRG's seven-point initiative.

 Reports in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA highlight his remarks on aid
 with no reference to a political settlement.  A Moscow radio
 version in Vietnamese quotes him as elaborating on Soviet aid,
 but does not mention a political settlement, although other
 radio versions, including Mandarin- and English-language
 broadcasts, report him as referring to Soviet support for a
 peaceful settlement as well as to aid.
 VISITS TO       The publicity of the Hoan delegation's visits
 EAST EUROPE   to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania largely
 consisted of reportage of activities, which
 included receptions in each country by party first secretaries
 and officials of legislative bodies.  There were standard
 references to support and aid by the hosts and expressions of
 gratitude by Hoan.
 TASS on 30 August briefly reported the delegation's arrival in
 Prague and a TASS-attributed report in PRAVDA on 24 August
 reported the arrival in Warsaw, but there is no known Moscow
 acknowledgment of the group's visit in Romania.  On the other
 hand, the only NCNA report of the delegation's activities in
 Eastern Europe was a 14 September report describing the visit
 to Romania.
 Limited propaganda on the visits was generally devoid of
 polemical overtones.  However, the Czech organ RUDE PRAVO, in
 an 8 September comment on the Hoan visit attributed to CTK,
 echoed some of Hanoi's earlier anti-Chinese polemic.  It said
 that "no one but the DRV Government and the PRG has. the right
 to make decisions concerning the destiny of the Vietnamese
 people.  The Paris peace conference, and possibly Hanoi, are
 the only two places where American representatives can hold
 responsible and binding negotiations.  'The keys to peace in
 Vietnam certainly do not lie outside Vietnam and out of the
 reach of its legitimate representatives.'"
 Prague's CTK on 2 September and the labor organ PRACE had
 reported that Hoang Van Hoan, at a meeting with Czechoslovak
 CP Secretary General Husak, interjected a reference to the
 Soviet Union in expressing appreciation for socialist aid.
 RUDE PRAVO, however, like VNA and NHAN DAN, quoted Hoan as
 thanking "the socialist countries, including Czechoslovakia."

 CHINA
 LOW-KEYED NATIONAL DAY WITHOUT TOP LEADER TURNOUT OR EDITORIAL
 For the first time since 1949, there was no National Day parade
 reviewed by Mao and other major PRC leaders from the Tienanmen
 rostrum.  Officials had told foreign reporters earlier that
 the parade had been canceled, although there was no prior
 announcement in the public media.  The top official present at
 National Day activities was Chou En-lai; but Chou did not
 deliver his usual speech on the eve of National Day, with the
 traditional state banquet being replaced by a Foreign Ministry
 reception.  This and three other receptions for foreign
 vistors on 30 September and 1 October, plus a walkthrough at
 the Summer Palace grounds, were the only formal celebrations.
 In attendance at one or the other of these affairs were Polit-
 buro members Chou En-lai, Chiang Ching, Chang Chun-chiao,
 Yao Wen-yuan, Li Hsien-nien, Yeh Chien-ying (senior PLA leader
 currently in public view) and Tung Pi-wu.
 The ceremonial changes are in line with regime pronouncemerts
 favoring frugal celebrations--and in keeping also with the un-
 expectedly low-keyed observance of the CCP's 50th anniversary
 last summer, on 1 July.  No doubt more crucial to the nature
 of the celebrations, however, is the fact that elimination of
 the final obligatory appearance this year for Politburo members
 in good standing effectively screens off any sure knowledge of
 Politburo changes.
 In yet another, and even less explicable, break with tradition,
 there was no editorial hailing the anniversary.  There had
 been joint RED FLAG - PEOPLE'S DAILY - LIBERATION ARMY DAILY
 editorials since 1967, and before that separate editorials in
 the central journals.  The National Day period also offered
 further opportunities for downplaying the adulation of Mao,
 with the PEOPLE'S DAILY omitting its usual frontpage picture
 of Mao or of Mao and Lin.  References to Lin seem fewer than
 normal, but perhaps no less than would accord with the somewhat
 fewer references to Mao.  The 50 color photos of Mao, and
 Mao with Lin--reported by NCNA on 12 September as ready for
 distribution throughout the country but never again mentioned

 and Shantung but nowhere else (they had been referred to

 PROVINCIAL    Rallies in seven provinces, among those reporting
 RALLIES       so far, were attended by provincial chiefs.
 (Data is based solely on local broadcasts; NCNA
 did not release its customary detailed account telling who was
 present where.)  In Liaoning Politburo member and Military
 Region commander Chen Hsi-lien spoke to Korean visitors.  Hsu
 Shih-yu, the other Politburo member who commands a military
 region, did not show up in his Nanking base; a 22 September
 Anhwei broadcast had referred to Hsu's deputy Liao Jung-piao
 as "head of the PLA Nanking units," raising the possibility
 that Hsu has been purged or perhaps transferred to replace
 one of three military chiefs on the Politburo--Huang Yung-
 sheng, Wu Fa-hsien, and Li Tso-peng--who have now been out of
 public view for nearly a month.  Hsu, however, has not appeared
 publicly since June.
 CENTRAL, PROVINCIAL PROPAGANDA CONTINUES MUCH AS USUAL
 The daily propaganda in official media continues to provide
 scant help in suggesting policy issues that might have led to
 the current anomalies in Peking. That portion of the propaganda
 which is issue-oriented reveals no notable shifts in such
 areas as cultural and economic affairs; but the continuing
 flow of such propaganda does suggest that the leadership could
 easily have agreed on a series of bland pronouncements foi a
 National  Day editorial had it chosen to do so.  Release of a
 2 October article by the writing group of the Ministry of
 Commerce makes it less likely that agricultural policy is at
 issue, because the article simply reiterated the theme that the
 peasants' living conditions must be improved as output rises.
 The article did perhaps hint that some cadres and peasants
 are unhappy at the continual accumulation of surpluses; there
 was unusual attention to the need for surpluses, including the
 explanation that "in case enemies of a foreign country invade
 us and a war breaks out, grain reserves will be available
 everywhere."
 A HEILUNGKIANG DAILY editorial of 26 September may reflect some
 of the current tensions in the course of rhetoric which seems
 aimed at Chen Po-ta and the former Heilungkiang chief Pan
 Fu-sheng.  Noting that the struggle in Heilungkiang "has been
 extremely fierce and acute," the editorial states that under
 the leadership of Mao and the Central Committee those under-
 mining the cultural revolution in Heilungkiang had been
 repudiated and the "opportunist line that was 'left' in form
 but right in essence" had been destroyed.

 The continuing nature of the struggle in Heilungkiang is
 emphasized by the editorial's insistence that even "after the
 founding of the new provincial CCP committee" the left op-
 portunist line "has brought damage to our cause" and must be
 wiped out.  One tactic with which the enemy is credited--as
 is usual in this type of propaganda--is trying to split
 revolutionary ranks, in this case "the unity between the army
 and people and between the army and government."  The editorial
 calls for closely following Mao's strategic plan, and may be
 indicating a larger area than Heilungkiang in placing an
 injunction against "independent kingdoms" in the context of
 disunity between the army and the people and government.
 AIRPLANE CRASH IN MONGOLIA IS IGNORED IN PRC MEDIA
 PRC media have not referred to the crash of a PRC airplane in
 Mongolia on the night of 12 September, which was reported by
 Mongolia's MONTSAME agency and by TASS on 30 September.  These
 accounts indicated that the plane was a jet belonging to the
 PRC airforce, that the Mongolians had issued a formal protest,
 and that the Chinese had been allowed to send observers to
 view the wreck.  Chinese spokesmen in Peking confirmed the
 crash to Western newsmen, but said it was a civilian flight.
 There have been no media indications that the crash was
 connected to the various anomalies in PRC behavior since then.
 HAILE SELASSIE GREETED BY CHOU, PEOPLES DAILY EDITORIAL
 NCNA on 6 October reported the arrival of Haile Selassie in
 Peking after a short stop in Canton.  He was greeted at the
 airport by Chou En-tai and at the guesthouse by Vice Chairman
 Tung Pi-vu.  The only other Politburo members reported in
 attendance were Li Hsien-nien and Yeh Chien-ying, both of whom
 have been making frequent public appearances.  At his Canton
 stop Haile Selassie was greeted by almost all the top local
 leaders.  The three heads of state who visited Peking previously
 during the past year were each received by Mao at some point
 in their visit.
 A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial hailing the visit followed standard
 forms, praising the Ethiopians for their valiant stand against
 fascist invaders in the 1930's and for supporting the PRC in
 restoring "her legitimate rights" in the United Nations.  As
 highlights of past friendly relations, the editorial mentions con-
 tacts at the 1955 Bandung Conference and the 1964 visit by Chou
 En-lai.

 USSR - PRC
 MOSCOW COUPLES APPEAL FOR BETTER RELATIONS WITH NEW POLEMICS
 Moscow has again used the PRC's 1 October national day to
 call for normalization of Sino-Soviet state relations, but in
 contrast to its behavior last year it has coupled this call
 with new polemical attacks designed to discredit the Chinese
 leadership among the Chinese people and in the world com-
 munist movement.
 The call for better relations came, as it did last year, in
 a message sent impersonally from the Supreme Soviet Presidium
 and the Council of Ministers to "the president of the PRC"* and
 leading governmental organs, as well as in signed articles
 in PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA.  But where both articles last year
 had shied away from attacks on Maoism, reflecting a calmer
 period in Sino-Soviet relations and perhaps higher hopes for
 the Peking border talks, both this year attack Maoist policies
 and the one in PRAVDA portrays the Peking leadership as ag-
 gressive, divisive, and anti-Soviet.
 The IZVESTIYA article takes a more conciliatory tack than the
 one in PRAVDA, avoiding direct attacks on the Chinese leader-
 ship.  Against the background of President Nixon's impending
 visit to China and the prospect of improved U.S.-PRC relations,
 a defensive insistence in the article on Moscow's "tireless"
 efforts to normalize relations with Peking seems calculated to
 justify the USSR's China policy for domestic and foreign com-
 munist audiences and to underscore the idea that the full
 burden of responsibility for the present state of relations
 rests with Peking.  The softer tone of the article as compared
 with the one in PRAVDA is in keeping with IZVESTIYA's role
 as government organ, against the backdrop of the ongoing state
 negotiations with the PRC on the border question.  IZVESTIYA,
 but not PRAVDA, refers to these negotiations, as was the case
 *  Last year's message was similarly addressed to "the president
 of the PRC," an office which has not been filled since Liu
 Shao-chi was purged in late 1966 during the cultural revolu-
 tion.

 last year; and it was IZVESTIYA, but not PRAVDA, which last
 year called for the settlement of disputed questions through
 "talks and consultations."
 PRAVDA's attack on the Peking leadership fits generally with
 the pattern of the continuing, concerted Soviet bloc polemical
 charges keynoted by the I. Aleksandrov article in the party
 organ on 4 September.  It also accords with a new blast at the
 Chinese leadership by CPSU ideologue Suslov at a party con-
 ference on Marxism-Leninism.
 In keeping with this pattern, Moscow chose the eve of the
 PRC's national day to publicize a report, credited to the
 Mongolian news agency, that a Chinese air force jet, after
 violating Mongolia's airspace, crashed in Mongolian territory
 on the night of 12-13 September.  The Soviet news agency
 also, on 1 October, picked up a Tokyo report that Liu Shao-chi
 had defected to the Soviet Union, ridiculing it as "fantasy"
 but underscoring the portrayal of PRC leadership instability
 by publicizing it while in effect dissociating the USSR from
 involvement in the Liu.Shao-chi affair.
 OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS,    Despite the polemical cast of the com-
 GREETINGS MESSAGE                                      ment, the Soviet Union was represented
 at the same level at Chinese national
 day functions as it was last year.  TASS briefly reported that
 Deputy Ministers Nikolay Rodionov and Nikolay Smelyakov,
 Engineer Colonel-General Komarovskiy, "and others" attended
 the PRC embassy reception in Moscow.  Last year Soviet media
 reported that Deputy Foreign Minister Rodionov attended the
 reception but did not report who else was present.  NCNA
 noted that Ilichev and Lubin, "the head and deputy head of the
 Soviet Government delegation to the negotiations on the Sino-
 Soviet border question," attended a foreign ministry reception
 in Peking.  Following its customary practice, NCNA mentioned
 the Soviet guests at the tail end of a long list of participants
 at the festivities; last year, Ilichev and his then deputy
 Gankovskiy were similarly listed last among hundreds who
 watched the national day parade from the reviewing stand.
 The Soviet message, frontpaged in PRAVDA on 1 October, follows
 a theme of Brezhnev's 24th CPSU Congress speech in calling
 for normalization of state relations with Peking, but it
 adjusts to the present Soviet polemical line by dropping a
 call in last year's message for united efforts agai%:st "the
 forces of war":  Where last year's message urged that the

 Soviet and Chinese peoples unify their efforts in the struggle
 with "the forces of imperialism, reaction, and war," the
 current one merely calls for unified efforts to struggle
 against "international imperialism and reaction."  The change
 accords with PRAVDA's portrayal of the Chinese as part of
 the aggressive, anti-Soviet forces:  Where last year's com-
 ment on the occasion had sought to shift the blame to the
 West for seeking "to poison the atmosphere" and to exploit
 tensions between the USSR and China, this year's PRAVDA
 article--in tune with comment generally over the past month--
 depicts the Chinese leadership and their policies as themselves
 constituting a danger to world peace and sustains a cautious
 line toward the West.
 VIKTOROV      The PRAVDA article, by Viktorov, charges that
 IN PRAVDA     the Chinese leaders have "set the task of prepar-
 ing for war" as the PRC's main goal and "stress
 in every possible way that a threat from the north hangs
 over the country."  Viktorov adds that "anti-Sovietism--the
 poisonous weapon of the enemies of socialism--has now been pro-
 claimed the Peking leaders' long-term policy."  In a possible
 allusion to Peking's invitation to President Nixon and its
 diplomatic maneuvering in the Balkans, Viktorov says the
 Chinese leaders have also "initiated hostile activity against
 world socialism and the international communist movement," add-
 ing that "the Marxist-Leninist parties are aware of all the
 danger of the Chinese leadership's course and are dealing a
 resolute rebuff to its hegemonist and chauvinist pretensions."
 Underscoring the benefits accruing from friendship with
 Moscow, Viktorov goes on to explain that history has demon-
 strated that the PRC's successful development could be assured
 only when it sought to strengthen its "cooperation and friend-
 ship with the Soviet Union."  He reaffirms Moscow's desire
 for normalized relations with Peking while in effect charging
 that the present Chinese leadership is not acting in the
 best interests of its people by practicing anti-Sovietism.
 The implication is that a change in the present leadership,
 "whose voice is now heard in unison with that of the Kuomingtang
 reactionaries," would open the door to restoration of good
 relations with Moscow, with attendant benefits to the Chinese
 people.

 PAVLOV IN     The IZVESTIYA article, by Pavlov, credits Moscow's
 IZVESTIYA     "tireless" diplomatic efforts with having
 prevented a further exacerbation of Sino-Soviet
 relations despite continuing Chinese efforts to fan anti-
 Soviet sentiments and to foment divisions in the world com-
 munist movement--the later themes being left to PRAVDA to
 develop more fully.  Asserting that the Soviet Union has
 been a model of "restraint and self-control" in the face of
 PRC efforts "to distort Marxism-Leninism and to drive a
 wedge in the ranks of the fighters against imperialism,"
 Pavlov emphasizes the point that "the Soviet Union has done
 its utmost to strive to normalize relations with the PRC."
 It was "thanks to the Soviet Union's tireless efforts," he
 adds, that "success has been achieved in halting the process
 of progressive deterioration in Soviet-Chinese relations."
 Reaching for documentation of this "success," Pavlov notes
 that ambassadors were exchanged, that there has been some
 increase in trade, and that the border talks "are continuing."*
 He adds without elaboration  that Moscow has "also made other
 principled and constructive proposals which correspond to
 the national interests of both peoples and the adoption of
 which would promote a change for the better in Soviet-Chinese
 relations."
 The Pavlov article repeats the stock formulation that pointedly
 expresses the Soviet party's respect only for "the Chinese
 people."  While avoiding attacks on the leadership, it
 assails Chinese propaganda and policies, playing some of the
 Viktorov PRAVDA article's themes in lower key when it remarks
 that "one cannot fail to see that the anti-Soviet line in Chinese
 propaganda and policy continues to conflict with the cause
 of socialism and the Chinese people themselves."  Pavlov
 says this is indicated by "fresh attempts to fan anti-Soviet
 sentiment among the population."  He adds that "as before,
 Peking is making flagrant attacks on the CPSU and the
 *  Where this year's PRAVDA article does not mention the
 border talks at all, both the PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA articles
 last year had made the point that the talks resulted from
 Soviet initiatives and were "continuing."  The IZVESTIYA article
 had indicated that some progress was being made, reporting for
 the first time in Soviet media that the Chinese had agreed
 to-assign an ambassador to Moscow.

 Soviet Union ..., which by no means facilitates an improve-
 ment in relations between the two countries."
 Pointing to the "unwavering" policy toward the PRC defined
 at the 24th CPSU Congress, Pavlov reaffirms its principles as
 "cohesion of the socialist countries on a Marxist-Leninist
 basis" (the principle Moscow charges the Chinese leadership
 with discarding), defense of the national interests of the
 Soviet State, and normalization of relations with Peking.
 Maintaining that this "Just and positive" position "meets with
 the understanding and approval of the socialist countries,"
 Pavlov invokes as evidence the "high assessment of the USSR's
 peace-loving foreign policy" at the 1969 Moscow international
 communist conference.
 SUSLOV     The harsher line expressed in PRAVDA was predictably
 taken by party ideologue Suslov in an address
 to a conference at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism on 29 Sep-
 tember.  According to TASS, Suslov condemned "the anti-Soviet
 line of the present Chinese leaders" as "a great danger to
 the cause of socialism and rejected "the slanderous inventions
 concerning the policy of the CPSU that are circulated by
 Peking."  He added "at the same time," TASS said, that "we
 have always striven and are prepared now to contribute in
 every way toward reestablishing and developing good neighborly
 relations and friendship between the Soviet Union and the
 PRC."

 FBIS TRENDS
 6 OCTOBER 1971
 DELEGATION OF DIETMENIS LEAGUE SIGNS JOINT STATEMENT
 Judging by the contents of a Joint communique issued on 2 October
 by the China-Japan Friendship Association and a delegation of the
 Japanese Dietmen's League for Promoting the Restoration of
 Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the U.S. "occupation" of Taiwan
 and the Taiwan straits area is no longer a major roadblock to
 the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and. Japan.
 U.S. military presence on Taiwan was listed as one of the five
 major issues preventing improvement of relations between the
 two countries in a joint statement issued in July between the
 China-Japan Friendship Association and a delegation of the
 :Comeito Party, Japan's second larepAst opposition party.  In the
 latest communique, the issue of U.S. military presence in the
 Far East is mentioned only in the context of a joint call for the
 "two superpowers" to "withdraw their troops stationed in foreign
 countries and dismantle their military bases abroad."
 Aside from the one omission, the communique essentially repeats
 the remaining four points contained in the July Kc-aeito communique
 as the "basic principles for the restoration of Japan-China
 diplomatic relations."  It denounces the "absurdity" of "'two
 China's, 'one China, one Taiwan,"' argues that Taiimn is Chin:-Is
 internal affair, calls for abrogation of the "illegal and invalid"
 1952 Japan-Nationalist China treaty and declares that the "lawful
 rights of the PRC in all organs of the UN" must be restored and
 that the "representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique" must be
 expelled.  The Japanese side expressed its determination to work
 through the Diet to "urge the Japanese Government to accept these
 principles" and begin negotiations with the PRC "to end the state
 of war between Japan and China, restore diplomatic relations and
 conclude a peace treaty."
 In an apparent effort to assist the League's drive to pass an
 antigovernment resolution on the question of restoration of
 relations with China, Peking appears to have made a tactical
 decision to soften its line on "Japanese militarism."  The Chinese
 side noted with unusual confidence that the Japanese people "will
 absolutely not allow Japanese militarism to take the road of
 aggression again."  It also noted that since "it is the Japanese
 people who determine the destiny of Japan" they will "certainly
 realize their aspirations to establish an independent, democratic,
 peaceful, neutral and prosperous new Japan."

 Since the Nixon-Sato talks in 1969, Poking's propaganda line on
 Japan has fully exploited the theme of an irrevocable revival of
 military-im in Japan under the influence of "Marxist laws."  Some
 softening of this line was reflected recently in an 18 September
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial marking the 40th anniversary of the
 "Manchurian Incident"; the United States was portrayed as
 chiefly responsible for leading Japan down the military road
 and confidence was expressed that "farsighted people in
 Japanese economic and political circles" would successfully
 counter the influence of a "handful of pro-U.S. monopoly
 capitalists" and guide Japan down the path of "independence,
 peace and neutrality."
 The communique contains specific blasts at Sato's China policy.
 The Japanese side expressed its "deep regrets" that the "Sato
 cabinet, in disregard of opposition by public opinion," has
 acted as a cosponsor of the draft resolutions for dual UN
 membership for Taiwan and the PRC.  The Chinese side condemned
 the Sato Government for "stubbornly pursuing the policy of
 following the United States and of hostility toward China" and
 predicted that "it will surely meet with irretrievable defeat."
 The communique was signed by Wang Kuo-chuan, head of the China-
 Japan Friendship Association, and Aiichiro Fujiyama, senior
 LDP Diet member and leader of the delegation, which was composed
 of Diet members from the ruling LDP as well as opposition members
 from the Komeito, Socialist and Democratic Socialist Parties.
 Kuo Mo-jo, vice-chaixinan of the Standing Committee of the National
 People's Congress and honorary president of the China-Japan
 Friendship Association, attended the signing ceremony.  Chou En-tai
 met with the delegation once during its 17 September-4 October visit.
 JCP REACTION     KYODO on 4 October reported that JCP Chairman
 Kenji Miyamoto characterized the League
 delegation's visit to Peking as "kowtow diplomacy" in a 3 October
 speech at the Japan Press Club.  Miyamoto also charged that the
 League committed a "grave error" by transgressing "its
 suprapartisan position" to side with China in an "united anti-U.S.
 and USSR front." Reflecting sensitivity to the failure of his
 party to participate in the delegation, Miyamoto asserted that
 the JCP was maintaining "splendid isolation" from other Japanese
 opposition parties in the "race to approach China."

 USSR  -  INDIA
 GANDHI VISIT CEMENTS PRO-INDIAN SOVIET STANCE ON EAST BENGAL
 Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's 27-29 September state
 visit to the USSR, six weeks after the ratification of the
 9 August Soviet-Indian treaty of peace, friendship, and
 cooperation, has moved Moscow's public position on the East
 Bengal crisis toward closer alinement with Delhi's.  It has
 also produced a significantly increased level of Soviet
 propaganda attention to the burdens imposed on India by the
 continuing flow of refugees from East Pakistan, coupled with
 critical comment and reportage on alleged activities of the
 Pakistani authorities contributing to the exodus and violating
 the "human rights" of the East Pakistanis.  Soviet mass meetings
 on the East Pakistan situation, resulting in appeals for an end
 to "reprisals" and "atrocities," were reported by TASS for the
 first time on 5 October and are continuing.
 The joint statement issued at the close of Mrs. Gandhi's visit
 on the 29th, Moscow's publicity for the visit, and remarks by
 the Soviet leaders register in general a further consolidation of
 Soviet-Indian relations.  Mrs. Gandhi had talks with all three
 of the top Soviet leaders, and the joint statement announces a
 decision to set up an intergovernmental commission on economic,
 scientific, and technical cooperation.
 On the question of East Pakistan, while Moscow continues to press
 for a political solution--the substance and mechanics le:.gely
 unspecified--it has now laid the blame for the crisis squa-ely
 at the door of Pakistani President Yah;,ra Khan.  In the ha:?s4lest
 terms yet used by a Soviet leader, Kosygin declared in a luncheon
 speech on 28 September that "it is impossible to justify the
 actions of the Pakistani authorities" which led to the "wholesale
 flight" of over eight million people from East Pakistan   The
 exodus, he said, "can only be explair.,ed by unbearable living
 conditions created for them there."  Kosygin called on President
 Yahya Khan--by name--to take "the most effective steps for the
 liquidation of the hotbed of tension that has emerged."
 The Soviet leadership has also endorsed the legitimacy of India's
 concern with events in East Pakistan, in effect gainsaying
 Pakistan's claim that India is meddling in a purely internal
 affair.  In remarks keyed to the refugee flight, Kosygin declared

 on the 28th that "the task is to prevent aggravation of the
 relations between India and Pakistan," adding that "we
 distinctly perceive the intricacy of the questions that emerged
 as a result of these events in the relations between India and
 Pakistan."  More directly, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko
 asserted in his UNGA address on the 28th that the East Pakistan
 crisis is "not simply an internal question" and declared that
 "one cannot but admit that India has grounds for displaying
 uneasiness in connection with the turn. that events have taken
 in East Pakistan."
 THE JOINT      "The grave situation which has arisen on the Indian
 STATEhENT      subcontinent as a result of the recent events in
 East Bengal" is the principal issue dealt with in
 the joint statement of the 29th, as publicized in full by TASS
 in English.  The use of the term "East Bengal" throughout the
 TASS English text, as in the text disseminated by India, is a
 departure from consistent Soviet practice--an evident concession
 handled with kid gloves by the Soviets and not generally reflected
 in Soviet propaganda.  Notably, in an abbreviated version
 transmitted by TASS in Russian, in the text published in PRAVDA,
 and even in the versions broadcast by Radio Moscow in Hindi as
 well as in Urdu, Punjabi, and Bengali, the term "East Pakistan"
 is consistently substituted for "East Bengal."  Kosygin, as well
 as Soviet comment and reportage, consistently used "East Pakistan."
 The joint statement broaches the events in East Pakistan with an
 acknowledgment of the burdens imposed on India by the more than
 nine million refugees who have fled from the eastern region of
 Pakistan, mentioning India's "humane approach" to the problem.
 These passages preface a statement that the Soviet side "took
 into account" the Indian prime minister's statement that India
 is "fully determined to take all necessary measures" to stop
 the flow of refugees and to ensure that those refugees who are
 already in India "return to their homeland without delay."
 Clearly not prepared to concur in such an open-ended statement
 of intent, the Soviet side merely "reaffirmed its position
 regarding the problem of refugees and other questions"
 relating to the situation "as laid down in" Podgornyy's
 2 April letter to Pakistani President Yahya Khan.  The letter
 had in fact made no reference to the refugee problem, which
 had not at the time assumed major proportions, but had merely
 called for adoption of "the most urgent measures to stop the
 bloodshed and repressions against the population in East
 Pakistan" and for recourse to "methods of a peaceful
 settlement."

 Calling again for "urgent measures" to achieve "a political

 must show regard for--in the words of the TABS English text--
 "the wishes, the inalienable rights and lawful interests of the
 people of East Bengal as well as for the speediest and safe
 return of the refugees to their homeland in conditions safe-
 guarding their honor and dignity."  While this falls short of
 what Mrs. Gandhi may have sought by way of an explicit call
 for President Yahya Khan to deal directly with the elected
 Awami League leaders in East Bengal, it amounts to the strongest
 Soviet demand yet made on the Pakistani Government.  The last
 Soviet-Indian joint statement, issued on 12 August at the close
 of Foreign Minister Gromyko's visit to New Delhi, had simply
 called for "a political solution" and "the creation of conditions
 of safety for the return of the refugees to their homes,"
 without elaboration.
 The formula used in the 12 August statement had remained the Soviet
 position, as registered in authoritative pronouncements, until
 Podgornyy on 14 September--during the visit of the King of
 Afghanistan--foreshadowed the current demand that the "wishes"
 and "inalienable rights and lawful interests" of the people of
 East Pakistan be respected.  Podgornyy called for a political.
 settlement "taking account of the legitimate interests of [East
 Pakistan's] population" and the creation "of secure conditions"
 for the return of the refugees.
 Kosygin,picked up Podgornyy's line on the 28th, during Mrs.
 Gandhi's visit, when he called for "an early political
 settlement in East Pakistan which would consider the legitimate
 interests of its population, would safeguard its normal
 development and eliminate the threat of further aggravation of
 Pakistani-Indian tensions."  It is "necessary above all,"
 Kosygin said, "to offer the refugees an opportunity to return
 home, to give them a full guarantee on the part of the Pakistani
 authorities that they will not be persecuted and will have an
 opportunity to live and work peacefully in East Pakistan."  On
 1 October at a luncheon in Delhi, Podgornyy called for "a just
 political settlement with due consideration for the lawful
 rights and interests of the peoples of this region."

 authorities to "end mass reprisals against the population of
 East Pakistan," to cease the "mockery of justice over Mujibur
 Rahman"--described as a "legitimately elected leader of the
 Pakistani people, fighter for civil rights and freedom"--and
 to bring about a political solution "taking into account the
 will, rights, and aspirations of the people of East Pakistan"
 and enabling the refugees to return from India.
 A particularly strong statement came from the Soviet Peace
 Committee, which declared that the Pakistani Government's
 actions "cannot be described otherwise than a violation of
 the lawful human rights of the population of East Pakistan
 and disregard of the clearly expressed will of the Pakistani
 people."  And the Soviet Red Cross expressed "wrathful
 indignation" at "the continuing reprisals and the gross
 violations of the human rights declaration and universally
 recognized standards of human morality."  On 5 October TASS
 reported statements in the same vein by the World Federation
 of Democratic Youth, the World Federation of Trade Unions, and
 the Women's International Democratic Federation.  TASS has
 carried previous statements on the situation from the WFTU,
 but there had been no publicity for statements by Soviet
 organizations before the 30th.
 Mass meetings throughout the Soviet Union, first publicized
 by TASS on 5 October, are said to be adopting statements and
 resolutions demanding an end to "wholesale reprisals in East
 Pakistan" and cessation of "the disgraceful trial" of Awami
 League leader Mujibur.
 Citing Indian press sources and other unspecified "reports,"
 TASS dispatches from Delhi on 30 September and 4 October
 portrayed "India's great role in alleviation of the sufferings
 of those who fell victim to the events in East Pakistan" and
 went on to describe those events in terms of "unending
 repressions by the West Pakistani Army against the citizens
 of East Pakistan," "deliberate physical extermination" of
 the youth and intelligentsia,  "atrocities," "terror,"
 "barbarity," "lawlessness," and "oppression."  The dispatch
 on the 30th cited "reports" that "special detachments in East
 Pakistan are destroying foodstuffs, burning down dwellings., and
 abusing in every way the civil population."  With reference to
 '.'data cited by Indian and international press," the 4 October
 dispatch claimed there was "no doubt that fear of reprisals is
 the most important factor preventing the earliest return home

 of the refugees, and there is abundant proof that reprisals are
 really taking place."  TLS added that the very fact of the
 presence of over nine million refugees in India was "irrefutable
 proof of brutal treatment by the East Pakistani authorities of
 the people of that province."
 Soviet media had given little attention to the events in Pakistan
 in the weeks prior to Mrs. Gandhi's visit.  There were occasional
 reports on developments relating to Mujibur Rahman, and Moscow
 sporadically reported--in carefully neutral fashion--the
 persistence of tensions on the Indian-Pakistani border.  Soviet
 reports had taken note of the refugee problem and the burden it
 imposed on India, but had not emphasized it.

 MIDDLE EAST
 USSR IGNORES SUBSTANCE OF ROGERS, EBAN SPEECHES ON SETTLEMENT
 A continuing low volume of Moscow propaganda on the Middle East
 situation draws on stock themes in pressing for a peaceful
 settlement on the basis of the 22 November 1967 Security Council
 resolution and in indicting Israel--as supported by its "patrons"
 in Washington--as the opponent of an accord.  At the elite
 level, Premier Kosygin at a 3U September dinner speech honoring
 the visiting Yemeni Prime Minister 'Ali Nasir Muhammad urged
 unity of action of all forces in the Middle East struggling
 againsL~ "imperialist aggression."  He pledged support to the
 just cause of the Arab peoples and their efforts aimed at
 restoring "their flouted rights, at insuring a just political
 settlement in the Near East, and at defending the legitimate
 rights of the Arab people of Palestine."
 At this writing, Moscow has not acknowledged the substance of
 Secretary Rogers' remarks in his 4 October UNGA address in
 which he called for an interim Suez Canal agreement.  The
 TASS report of the speech noted only that Rogers "placed
 himself, in fact, in the position of Tel Aviv's defender,
 calling on the Arab countries to give up their demand for
 the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the foreign territories
 occupied by them."
 On 28 September, a TASS report of ARE Foreign Minister Riad's
 remarks on television that dV said he expressed puzzlement
 over the fact that the United States, which is "trying to pose
 as an 'impartial international mediator' in the efforts to
 solve the question of opening the Suez Canal, has been ignoring"
 the ARE Government for over two months.  Riad went on, TASS
 said, to observe that neither Rogers nor Assistant Secretary
 Sisco has raised the question of opening the canal with Cairo.
 The TASS report of Riad's remarks after his meeting with Rogers
 on the 30th did not mention the canal issue, instead noting
 only that Riad told journalists that the Jarring plan of last
 February constitutes the "best plan" for a Middle East settlement.
 At the same time, the account continued, Riad "held the door
 open for any new possibility that will lead to peace."

 In the pattern of its handling of the Rogers speech, Moscow
 media have ignored the substance of Israeli Foreign Minister
 Eban's 30 September address to the General Assembly on a Middle
 East settlement in which he proposed an interim Suez agreement.
 A brief TABS dispatch on the 3d on the ARE's rejection of Eban's
 proposals said merely that Eban has "again shown that Israel
 continues to oppose all efforts of the United Nations aimed at
 establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.  The
 Israeli ruling circles are exerting every effort to legalize
 their bossing on the seized Arab lands."  And a domestic service
 broadcast on u October observed that Eban in the General Assembly
 "loudly stated" that Israel is seeking ways for a peaceful
 settlement, at the same time making "an intolerable attack on
 the Arab states and on the decisions of the General Assembly
 itself."  Against this background, the broadcast concluded,"one
 is not amazed" by reports that Eban has raised new demands for
 the delivery of Phantom aircraft to Israel from the United States.
 Other propaganda echoes the complaint that Israel is stepping up
 its pressure for delivery of additional aircraft from the United
 States.  And an Arab-language broadcast on 3 October, citing
 Cairo's AL-AKHBAR, said that "a large number of American military
 experts and technicians" arrived in Tel Aviv in recent weeks and
 was. immediately granted Israeli nationality.  According to the
 broadcast, the Americans joined the Israeli army where they will
 serve in rocket and air force units and will be used in servicing
 military electronic equipment.
 Further documenting their charge that Israel is bent on blocking
 a peace accord in the Middle East, propagandists have seized on
 the Israeli cabinet's rejection of the 25 September Security
 Council resolution urging Tel Aviv to discontinue its actions
 aimed at annexing Jerusalem.  A domestic service commentary on
 28 September, for example, called the decision "impudent" and
 assailed Tel Aviv's efforts since June 1967 to carry out "the
 so-called Israelization of Jerusalem."  On the same day, a RED
 STAR article said that the cabinet's decision is fresh evidence
 that the Israeli rulers "are in fact prepared for any extreme
 measures in order to hang on to the occupied territories."

 EASTERN EUROPE
 BORBA WELCOMES THAW IN BUDAPEST COMMENT ON YUGOSLAVIA
 The semiofficial Yugoslav BORBA on 1 October expressed gratification
 at the cordial tone of a 25 September article in the Hungarian
 Government organ MAGYAR HIRLAP, contrasting it with comment during
 August in which Budapest had served Moscow as leading proxy
 spokesman in warning the Balkan communist mavericks against
 receptivity to Chinese overtures.
 The MAGYAR HIRLAP article used the occasion of the 25th anniversary
 of Hungarian-Yugoslav relations for a prompt shifting of gears in
 the wake of Brezhnev's fence mending visit to Belgrade.  It
 appeared on the day the Soviet-Yugoslav Joint statement was
 released and on the first day of Brezhnev's 25-26 September
 stopover in Budapest, presumably to fill in the Hungarian
 leadership on the substance of his talks with Tito and on the new
 ground rules for relations with Yugoslavia.
 The BORBA commentary, signed by Zoran Mandzuka, is entitled
 "A Good Road" in response to the title of MAGYAR HIRLAP's
 article, "A Rich Content."  It welcomes the contrast between the
 tone of the Hungarian article and that of the some paper's
 article on "a previous occasion"--a clear allusion to the
 13 August article in which MAGYAR HIRLAP had warned Albania,
 Romania, and Yugoslavia against any attempt to form an "anti-
 Soviet axis" in the Balkans under Peking's aegis.  "As is known
 to our readers," BORBA recalls, MAGYAR HIRLAP "on that occasion
 made a surprising and willful statement dealing with the Balkan
 situation in an unacceptable manner and even with a tone of
 warning."
 BORBA comments approvingly that the new Hungarian article, while
 noting that periods in the past hfidl. been marked by "misunder-
 standing," said it could "now" be noted with satisfaction that
 the two countries are linked by "the common aims of building
 socialism and the even development of Hungarian-Yugoslav
 relations."  It also cites the Hungarian paper's conclusion that
 the two countries have built "a rich content" into their relations
 and that those relations "have never represented a mere formal act."

 On its own authority, BORBA goes on to expound the thesis that
 "methods" of building socialism are the affair of the individual
 countries, in harmony with the passage in the new Soviet-
 Yugoslav joint statement granting that "the methods of constructing
 socialism . . . area matter for the peoples and working classes
 in individual countries and need not contradict each other."
 BORBA recalls that Hungarian Premier Fock, on a visit to Belgrade
 last year, had noted that existing differences between the two
 countries concerned only "the methods of solving essentially
 similar problems."  The Yugoslav paper further underscores the
 "good direction" of relations between the two countries which,
 "while striving for the same aims, have chosen different methods."
 MAGYAR HIRLAP's 25 September article, cordial but relatively
 restrained, stated that relations with Belgrade were developing
 on the basis of "mutual respect and understanding."  BORBA goes
 beyond this to declare that "both sides" have stressed that
 their relations are also based on respect for "full sovereignty
 and noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries
 in practice" and on "full equality."
 Publicizing a further gesture of rapprochement, TANJUG on the
 30th reported that a notably high-level Yugoslav party figure--
 Stane Dolanc, member of the LCY Presidium's Executive Bureau--
 had paid a visit that day to "the first world hunting exposition"
 in Budapest, which included a large Yugoslav exhibit.
 KADAR SPEECH     Possibly to keep a rein on the new cordiality,
 MTI on the 2d, the day after the appearance of
 the BORBA-commentary, released further details of a 29 September
 speech by Kadar in Tolna County in southern Hungary.  Where
 recorded excerpts of the speech carried in the Budapest domestic
 service on the 30th included only a brief passage devoted to
 Hungary's loyalty to the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, and CEMA
 in its dealings with capitalist countries, the MTI summary adds
 gratuitous remarks by the MSZMP leader which could be read as an
 admonition to those socialist countries which failed to follow a
 consistently pro-Soviet line, aimed chiefly at the Romanians but
 in part also at Yugoslavia.  In such dealings, MTI reports Kadar
 as having, said, "socialist Hungary does not 'wobble' this way
 and that," and "in international life more respect is given to
 one of whom it is known where he stands," just as in everyday
 life "cooperation is impossible with the sort of person who
 keeps changing his mind and position all the time."  Also in the
 MTI report, but not in the 30 September recorded excerpts, is

 Kadar's remark that as a measure of Budapest's solidarity with
 the USSR and the Warsaw Pact, "Just recently we had a friendly
 and comradely exchange of opinions in Budapest with-Comrade
 L.I. Brezhnev," a type of consultation which "advances our united
 struggle for our common goals and interests."
 HUNGARY & ROMANIA     In another development evidently flowing
 from the Soviet-Yugoslav accommodation,
 Romanian and Hungarian media on 2 October publicized a meeting
 that day in Bucharest between visiting NEPSZABADSAG Chief Editor
 Istvan Sarlos and Paul Niculescu-Mizil, RCP Secretary and member
 of the party Executive Committee and Permanent Presidium--foremost
 spokesman for the RCP's independent policy in relations with the
 other ruling communist parties.  The meeting, also attended by
 SCINTEIA Chief Editor Alexandru ionescu, was characterized by
 both Budapest and Bucharest as "cordial and comradely."
 Niculescu-Mizil had authored a 9 July SCINTEIA article directly
 attacking remarks by Hung&rian party Politburo member and Secretary
 Komocsin, in a 24 June Hungarian National Assembly speech, which
 transparently criticized Ceausescu's trip to Peking and conveyed
 overtones of a threat to disrupt the political situation in
 Romania by voicing concern over the status of "socialism" among the
 Hungarian minority in Transylvania.
 POLAND AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA STRESS UNITY. LOYALTY TO MOSCOW
 A lengthy communique on the 1-2 October visit to Warsaw of a
 Czechoslovak party-government delegation led by CPCZ General
 Secretary Husak and Premier Strougal, and including arch-conservative
 figures Vasil Bilak and Vaclav Hula, presses the cause of Soviet bloc
 unity and orthodoxy and calls for consistent opposition to "splitting
 tendencies" as well as "any anti-Soviet tendencies."  The document
 praises "the results of the recent negotiations between the leading
 representatives of the Soviet Union and other European countries,"
 specifying only last year's Moscow and Warsaw treaties with Bonn
 and ignoring the Soviet-Yugoslav Joint statement.
 A large segment of the communique is devoted to economic integration
 under CEMA.  Underscoring continuity in Polish-Czechoslovak
 coordination, the document recalls with satisfaction the visits
 of Polish leaders Gierek and Jaroszewicz to Prague in January and
 of Premier Strougal to Warsaw in August.

 FRG  - CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 MOSCOW: RESPONSIBILITY FOR MUNICH DAMAGES ALREADY APPORTIONED
 A Moscow radio commentary on the eve of the 33d anniversary of
 the signing of the Munich agreement suggested that the FRG need
 not concern itself with the "legal responjibility" for damages
 inflicted on Czechoslovakia as a result of the Munich agreement
 if it recognizes the agreement as invalid ab initio.  The
 commentary by Aleksandr Galkin, broadcast only to German
 audiences on 28 September and repeated in German on the 29th,
 coincided with the windup of the third session of the Prague-
 Bonn exploratory talks on the normalization of relations, held
 27-28 September in the Czechoslovak ca?ital.
 The Moscow commentary reflected the amendment of the official
 Czechoslovak position apparently worked out at the 2 August
 Crimea meeting of bloc leaders.  The communique on the meeting
 for the first time modified Prague's hitherto consistent
 demand for FRG recognition of the invalidity of the Munich
 agreement nb initio "and all the consequences arising there-
 from" by dropping the final phrase.  Although Czechoslovak
 elite and official statements since then have consistently
 registered this change, two Czechoslovak press articles
 following the exploratory talks restored the dropped phrase
 to the formula and generally took a hardened line.  Thus the
 Moscow commentary may have been symptomatic of Soviet pressure
 on reluctant elements in the Czechoslovak regime to move ahead
 more vigorously in the talks with Bonn, as well as to reassure
 the West Germans.
 A hardened line was expressed in both the Slovak and Czech
 party organs.  The Slovak PRAVDA said on 29 September that
 "the socialist countries unconditionally support" Czechoslovakia's
 demand that the Munich agreement be recognized by Bonn as
 invalid ab initio, along with "acts" ensuing from it.
 Similarly, in citing Foreign Minister Marko's expressed hope
 in his UNGA speech on the 30th that "the present developments
 in Europe will favorably influence . . . negotiations with
 the FRG" and that Czechoslovakia is "sincerely interested in
 the successful conclusion" of the negotiations, a RUDE PRAVO
 commentator on 4 October added editorially that this success
 will depend "primarily on the FRG attitude toward nonvalidity
 of the Munich diktat ab initio with all the consequences arising

 therefrom."  In reporting Marko's speech on the 30th, CTK had
 noted that he spoke of nonvalidity ab initio of the "diktat,"
 with no address to the question of ensuing "consequences."
 At the top official level, West German recognition of the
 invalidity of the Munich agreement ab initio--with the former
 final phrase duly absent--was demanded in the 3 October joint
 communique on the Warsaw visit of a Czechoslovak delegation
 led by Husak and Strougal.  It was also demanded by Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko in his UNGA speech on the 28th.
 Noting in the course of his discussion of European developments
 the recertly signed four-power agreement "on questions relating
 to We&;1 Berlin," the inner-German phaze of the Berlin negotiations,
 and the expectation that the Moscow and Warsaw treaties will be
 ratified "in the near future," Gromyko said the normali-.ation of
 Czechoslovak-FRG relations is "next on the list."
 SOVIET EFFORT TO     The Galkin commentary over Radio Moscow set
 REASSURE THE FRG     out to debunk arguments that make Bonn
 hesitant to recognize the nonvalidity of
 the Munich agreement ab initio along with all the consequences
 arising from it--a move that would raise a myriad of legal and
 technical questions concerning such issues as the validity of
 German civil acts and citizenship in the Sudetenland between
 September 1938 and March 1939, when Hitler occupied Bohemia and
 Moravia, as well as possible Czechoslovak war damage reparations
 claims and, in turn, Sudeten German compensation claims.
 Pointing to "ambivalence" in the West German "official position"
 on the Munich issue, Galkin remarked that Bonn "is said" to
 recognize the nonvalidity of the Munich agreement "for the
 present" while rejecting Prague's "Just demands" for recognition
 of the accord ab initio, adducing "juridical reasons" for the
 latter.  It is asserted in Bonn, Galkin continued, that the
 Munich agreement "is perfectly legal because it was concluded
 by the legitimate heads of government," while "unofficially"
 it is argued that "to declare that the Munich agreement was devoid
 of all legality from its inception would be to provide the
 juridical justification for instituting proceedings against
 those persons who were responsiblq for those measures."
 Concluding that "this whole line of argument is totally
 untenable," Galkin directly discounted "references to possible
 legal consequences if the Munich agreement is declared invalid
 ab initio."  In fact, he said, "the legal responsibility for
 the damage inflicted on the Czechoslovak republic during the

 occupation has long since been apportioned by international
 accords on war criminals and by Czechoslovak laws which provide
 punishment for collaborationism."
 The Moscow commentary may possibly have been contrived to lay
 public groundwork for a more "pragmatic" approach in tha coming
 November session of the Prague-Bonn talks.  According to the
 West German DPA on the 29th, FRG Government spokesman Ahlers
 announced that FRG negotiator Frank had told the federal cabinet
 the most recent talks in Prague had passed from the stage of
 exchanging basic thoughts to "a more pragmatic" search for a
 mutually acceptable formula regarding the Munich agreement, and
 that this approach would be pursued in November.  A spate of
 authoritative Soviet press articles in the wake of the
 16-18 September Brandt-Brezhnev meeting in the Crimea had been
 marked by warm praise for the "realism" of Brandt's Ostpolitik.

 DEMICHEV SWITCHES FORMULATIONS ON ECONOMIC PRIORITIES
 Reporting on 29 September to a high-level conference on the 24th
 party congress and questions of theory, P.N. Demichev, Central
 Committee Secretary for ideology, referred to the need to
 "preserve the preferential growth of subdivision I of public
 production as a whole . . . ."  (PRAVDA, 30 September).
 "Subdivision I" in this formulation, which has long been
 utilized in economic literature, includes not only heavy industry
 but also significant categories of construction, transportation
 and agricultural production.  The formulation is apparently
 designed to replace the traditional obeisance to the
 "preferential development of heavy industry," which has become
 increasingly nonsensical in recent years as the growth rates
 for industrial consumer goods (Group B) drew even with and
 surpassed the rates for heavy industry (Group A).
 Demichev appears to be the first Soviet leader to use the
 "subdivision I" formulation.  Recently the leaders have for the
 most part avoided use of the term "preferential" and have used
 vaguer terms, describing heavy industry as the "foundation" of
 economic expansion (Podgornyy, Kirilenko and Kapitonov in their
 May-June 1971 election speeches) or "basis of bases" (Shcherbitskiy
 in his June 1971 speech).  Shelepin alone among the top leaders
 spoke of "retaining preferential. development of heavy industry" in
 his 1971 election speech.  Brezhnev has not recently repeated h3.s
 June 1966 statement that "the unchanging principle of our economic
 policy was and remains preferential development of heavy industry
 The decision to accelerate Group B at a faster rate than Group A
 in the draft 1971-1975 plan obviously necessitated doctrinal adjust-
 ment designed to allay fears among party propagandists that Lenin's
 law of the preferential development of the means of production was
 being ignored.  By reverting to the broader Marxist concept of
 "subdivision I" Demichev has squared the new policy with Lenin's law.
 In their numerous 1971 speeches Brezhnev and other leaders had
 passed up the opportunity to use the broader formulation, leavar.
 the propagandists in some confusion.  Demichev's reformulation of
 economic policy, coupled with Suslov's condemnation of a "purely
 consumer" approach to raising welfare in his speech at this same
 conference, should reassure propagandists that Soviet policy remains
 oriented to traditional goals.

 TOPIC  IN BRIEF
 GROMYKO WARNING AGAINST "COMBINATIONS OF STATES"
 For the eighth year running, the fullest version of Foreign
 Minister Gromyko's speech before the United Nations General
 Assembly appears in the central press, with TASS and Radio
 Moscow carrying excerpts and summaries.  But a key passage in
 this year's address, which appears in a TASS excerpt of
 Gromyko's remarks on China as well as in the TASS summary of
 the 28 September speech, is not included in the press versions.
 According to the TASS excerpt, Gromyko followed his remarks on
 U.S.-PRC relations and Chinese representation in the United
 Nations with the observation that in the past there have been
 "combinations" of states directed against others which have
 caused international tension and sometimes even wars.
 Ultimately, Gromyko added, these have "always backfired against
 their initiators and participants."  He concluded that "the
 generation that witnessed such combinations is still among the
 living."  Both PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA--which carried the longest
 versions of the address--ignored this passage, moving from the
 foreign minister's remarks on Chinese representation in the
 United Nations to his remarks on U.S.-Soviet relations.
 Gromyko's warning against the creation of "combinations" of
 states against others appears to go beyond earlier authoritative
 Moscow comment on President Nixon's forthcoming trip to the PRC,
 although the I. Aleksandrov article in the 4 September PRAVDA
 approached this formulation in asking rhetorically if a "deal
 against socialism" was being prepared behind the scenes in
 Peking and Washington.  The exclusion of the "combinations"
 warning from the central press versions of the speech accords
 with Moscow's current cautious, restrained treatment of Sino-U.S.
 relations.  PRAVDA's article on the PRC's 1 October national
 day this year contains no reference to Sino-U.S. relations.  And
 the TASS account of Secretary Rogers' 4 October UNGA speech
 mentions none of his comments on U.S. relations with Peking
 or on the China representation issue.
