 China's Science and Technology Reforms
 Summary
 The Central Committee's Decision on S&T reforms
 of 13 March gives the highest official endorsement
 to modernizing China's S&T structure.   The reforms--
 which rely heavily on economic incentives and market
 mechanisms--are aimed at overcoming chronic
 management problems that have hobbled the Chinese
 S&T system and increasing its contribution to
 national development.   China's determination to
 reform its S&T system is also reflected in the
 appointment of technocrat Song Jian as Minister-in-
 Charge of the State Science and Technology
 Commission and in proposed plans for the
 reorganization of the Chinese Academy of Science.
 The reforms could radically change the Chinese S&T
 structure, but we believe implementation will be
 slow.
 The Decision reaffirms China's opening to the
 West in science and technology and some of the
 reforms are based on US experience in managing
 S&T.    As China focuses its domestic resources on
 applied research and development work, we believe it
 will push for greater technical cooperation with the
 United States as opposed to cooperation in basic
 This memorandum was prepared byl                  lof the Office of
 East Asian Analysis in response to a request from the Office of

 research.   Nevertheless, the proliferation of
 players and the potential  loosening of central
 oversight implied by the reforms may complicate the
 course of US-PRC S&T cooperation.
 Introduction
 Since 1981, Beijing has tried to increase the contribution
 of S&T to national development by emphasizing applied rather than
 basic research and by working to overcome S&T management
 shortcomings.   The Chinese research and development structure has
 long been hampered by:
 -- Lack of coordination between research institutes,
 -- Inefficient use of resources; overemphasis on
 theoretical research,
 -- Inability to apply research results to production,
 -- Lack of incentives for quality performance;
 interference by party cadre, and technically
 unqualified managers,
 -- Lingering suspicion of intellectuals.
 In 1982 and 1983, Beijing instituted several organization
 reforms.   The State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC),
 which had been the leading body for planning and coordination of
 S&T activities, was forced to share its planning functions with
 the State Economic Commission and the State Planning
 Commission.   China also established a Leading Group for Science
 and Technology directly responsible to the State Council and
 chaired by Premier Zhao Ziyang.   A second Leading Group was set
 up to oversee the key electronics industry.   Under these groups,
 China began to experiment with new mechanisms for managing S&T
 and increasing the contribution of S&T to the economy.  (See
 Appendix for Chinese S&T Organizations.)
 Party Decision on S&T Reform
 China's leadership underlined its support for S&T reforms in
 early March when nearly the entire Politburo attended the
 National Scientific and Technological Work Conference.   A host of
 party and government leaders spoke about the importance of
 reforms,  including Deng Xiaoping, Party Chairman Hu Yaobang,
 Premier Zhao Ziyang, Minister-in-Charge of the State Planning
 Commission Song Ping, State Councillor Fang Yi and Song Jian.
 The Central Committee's 13 March "Decision on the Reform of
 the Science and Technology Management System" gives the party's
 political affirmation to structural changes that S&T reformers
 have been advocating for several years.  Although embassy

 officials report that the decision was drafted primarily within
 the SSTC rather than in party organization, the party's stamp of
 approval  is necessary for such a major reform effort.   Party
 approval  is particularly important since some of the opposition
 to S&T reforms in the past has come from party members.
 The document calls for using economic levers and market
 regulation in science and technology management.   Deng linked S&T
 reforms to the sweeping economic reforms--announced last fall--in
 his speech to the conference, calling on the S&T community to put
 the two reforms together to solve the longstanding question of
 the "disconnection" between S&T and the economy.
 The decision--like the reforms of the economic system--
 represents an exhaustive wish list for changes in S&T
 management.   It calls for reforming the funding system, greater
 exploitation of technology,  less state control, and greater use
 of economic levers to control S&T work and encourage
 initiative.     Specific reforms include:
 -- Funding.   State funding will gradually be reduced for
 institutes  involved in development and applied
 research.   These institutes are to become self-
 reliant within three to five years through reliance
 on contracts for research projects, consulting
 services, technology transfer, and joint venture
 arrangements with enterprises.   A system of science
 funds will be introduced to support basic and some
 applied research projects with state funds.
 Institutes  involved in research on selected topics
 such as public health and disaster prevention will
 continue to receive state appropriations.
 -- Greater Management Autonomy.   Research institutes
 will be granted more decisionmaking power in matters
 such as planning, outlays, personnel management,
 rewards, and internal structure.   Directors of
 institutes, who will still be appointed by higher
 authorities, will take full responsibility for their
 decisions.   Project team leaders will be given
 increased authority, and project teams may be made up
 of personnel hired by the team leader or through free
 association.   Collectives and individuals are now
 permitted to set up scientific or technical service
 organizations for profit.
 -- Personnel Management.   The document calls for
 training more S&T personnel and administrators,
 giving talented persons positions of responsibility,
 improving working and living conditions for S&T
 personnel, promoting a rational flow of S&T
 personnel, allowing research institutes and schools

 to adopt a hiring system.   S&T personnel are to be
 permitted to take up appropriate side jobs, and free
 discussion in academics is to be guaranteed.
 Exploitation of Technology.   The document recognizes
 technology as a commodity and calls for:   changing
 the practice of uncompensated transfer of
 technological achievements; actively promoting
 technology transfers through technology markets and
 other services; enacting laws to protect rights of
 buyers and sellers of technology; and determining
 market prices of technology through negotiation
 without state restrictions.   Institutes are
 encouraged to set up partnerships with production
 enterprises.   Defense research institutes are also to
 establish a system to increase their contribution to
 economic development.
 Changes in SSTC Leadership
 The party decision is only the latest in a series of moves
 by Beijing to promote S&T reform.   Last summer Fang Yi was
 removed from his position as Minister-in-Charge of the SSTC, a
 change we believe reflects Beijing's dissatisfaction with his
 management of the SSTC and frustration at continuing problems in
 S&T management.   In addition, Fang had been closely identified
 with basic research projects in the past, and may have been seen
 as not vigorously implementing the policy of favoring applied
 research.   Fang, however, retains his position as one of two
 deputy heads of the S&T Leading Group and remains the preeminent
 spokesman for S&T.
 Song Jian, Fang Yi's replacement,  is experienced in managing
 large-scale technology projects and has a vigorous management
 style.   Song was formerly a vice minister of the Ministry of
 Astronautics with responsibility for China's satellite
 programs.   He is much more active in the daily operations of the
 SSTC than Fang Yi was.   Song reportedly has been a major player
 in the current process of formulating S&T reforms through his
 position at the SSTC and in his capacity as director of the
 office of the S&T Leading Group.   Song may be trying to
 reestablish the SSTC's former role as the leading S&T policy
 organization.
 Four new vice ministers for the SSTC have been appointed
 under Song Jian, strengthening the SSTC's ties to important
 segments of the R&D community.   One of the appointees is being
 promoted from within the SSTC, another from the Ministry of
 Machine Building, a third from Qinghua University, and the fourth
 is deputy director of the office of the S&T Leading Group as well
 as being active in high energy physics programs.   The

 appointments, which run counter to the trend of reducing vice
 ministers throughout China's bureaucracy, suggest Song is moving
 aggressively to surround himself with the personnel needed to
 carry out reforms.
 Proposed CAS Reforms
 Lu Jiaxi, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
 and other CAS spokesmen have already announced plans to change
 funding mechanisms, permit greater mobility for S&T personnel,
 and increase the autonomy of individual  institutes.   Most
 striking is Lu's stated goal of divesting CAS of from one- to
 two-thirds of its 118 institutes in order to decentralize control
 over S&T and promote closer links between research and production
 enterprises.   The institutes may be placed under local control,
 combined with other institutes, turned over to other ministries,
 or disbanded.   The party Decision notes the need for CAS
 institutes involved in technology development to set up
 partnerships with enter rises and the importance of CAS basic
 research institutes.
 Prospects for Change
 Several factors bode well for the reform of China's S&T
 system.   Beijing apparently is united behind the reforms, with
 both party and government authorities lined up in support.   Song
 Jian has been actively working on the reforms and assembling an
 effective management team.   The top leaders within CAS are
 advocating the reforms, and most of the CAS research directors
 have been replaced in recent years with younger, presumably more
 progressive,  individuals who should favor the reforms.
 In addition, a large number of institutes and enterprises
 throughout China have already acquired favorable experience with
 the reforms.   All of the reforms outlined in the party document
 have been advocated by China's S&T leadership for some time,
 several  in formal documents approved by the State Council.   Many
 have been implemented on at least a trial basis for the past
 several years.   Provinces have adopted measures increasing
 personnel mobility and experimenting with alternative funding
 mechanisms.   Reports of contracts or successful technology
 transfers between research institutes and production enterprises
 are common.  F_~
 Nonetheless, potential problems remain.   Critics of the S&T
 reforms (similar to critics of the economic reforms) include
 those who are threatened by the call for younger, better educated
 personnel as well as those who object to the new market-oriented
 reforms on ideological grounds.   Deng and other leaders appear to
 have addressed these latter critics by stressing that the reforms
 are part of building a socialist society with Chinese
 characteristics.   In his speech to the national  science
 conference Deng also alluded to denigration of intellectuals as a
 continuing problem.   The party document calls on party cadre

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/04/19: CIA-RDP85T01058R000101220001-0
 within S&T organizations, who have resisted changes  in the past,
 to provide support for the implementation of the reforms and to
 be enthusiastic in supporting science.
 Decentralization of CAS may be difficult if personnel
 associated with  institutes slated for divestiture resist leaving
 the prestigious umbrella of CAS for association with an
 industrial ministry.   For similar reasons, S&T personnel are much
 more likely to want to transfer to institutes in urban locations
 than to the interior where qualified personnel are needed.
 Bureaucratic obstacles such as the need for housing permits may
 also limit greater personnel mobility.
 Resistance to the policy of favoring applied over basic
 research is also likely in certain quarters, both from reluctance
 on the part of basic researchers to switch research fields as
 well as from a genuine concern over the possible long-term
 effects of neglecting basic science.   The party Decision offered
 some reassurance to these critics by calling for steady,
 continuous progress in basic research.
 The reforms have the potential to change radically the
 nature of the Chinese S&T system, but progress is likely to be
 slow.   The party Decision stresses that any reform  must be
 gradually popularized and concludes by cautioning that "we should
 not expect to achieve quick results."
 Implications for US-PRC S&T Relations
 The party Decision reaffirmed the principles of opening to
 the West in S&T and of importing technology.   Chinese S&T leaders
 have modeled some of their reforms on S&T structures in the
 United States and are actively seeking US advice on S&T
 management.  F__1
 Although decentralization may increase opportunities for
 cooperation by allowing ministries more autonomy in developing
 international cooperative relationships, any lessening of central
 oversight of international S&T relationships could lead to
 greater confusion in managing US-PRC protocols.   Whether this
 turns out to be the case depends largely on the role the SSTC is
 willing to play.   The SSTC recently has expressed more interest
 in policy than in program coordination, but the importance of the
 US-PRC S&T relationship to China is such that the SSTC is
 unlikely to completely relinquish its program oversight role.
 The Chinese push for greater cooperation between institutes
 working on related topics may in time make it easier for several
 organizations to be involved in a particular protocol.
 Bureaucratic rivalry has caused problems in the past, however,
 and will not disappear overnight.   In addition,  in keeping with

 China's current focus on applied research and use of technology,
 China may push for greater technical cooperation rather than
 cooperation in basic research.   The Chinese may also look for
 more participation by private companies in future protocols, as
 they have for the telecommunications protocol.

 APPENDIX
 Major Chinese S&T Organizations
 Figure 1 shows the major S&T policy organizations in China
 today,  including the layer of leading groups added in 1982.   In
 addition to those listed in the figure, members of the S&T
 Leading Group include the Minister of Education, the Chairman of
 the State Economic Commission, a Vice President of CAS, the
 Minister of Labor and Personnel, the Chairman of the National
 Defense, Science, Technology, and Industry Commission (NDSTIC),
 and Song Jian.   The diagram does not fully indicate the prominent
 part the party plays throughout the S&T establishment.
 China has been working toward an integration of its military
 and civilian S&T structures, as illustrated in Figure 2.   We
 believe the appointment of Song Jian, formerly with the Ministry
 of Astronautics, a defense industry,  is intended to further the
 merger of military and civilian organizations.
 The S&T reforms primarily will affect the relationship
 between the policy organizations and the research elements (shown
 at the bottom of Figure 1).   General guidelines for S&T
 priorities will continue to come from central policy
 organizations, but research elements will have much more freedom
 to choose projects and personnel  if the reforms are
 implemented.   Research institutes involved in basic research
 (which should be a reduced number) will remain tied to the
 central government for funding, but institutes involved in
 applied and development work will be increasingly independent of
 the central government as they get more of their funding through
 contracts with production enterprises.   Contacts between research
 institutes, even those subordinate to different ministries,
 should increase.   If the proposed CAS reorganization takes place,
 CAS will become a smaller organization more focused--if not
 exclusively focused--on basic research.
