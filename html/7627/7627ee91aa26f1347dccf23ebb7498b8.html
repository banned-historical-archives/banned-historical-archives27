 MEMORANDUM FOR:  Historical Officers and Writers
 in the CIA Historical Program
 FROM             Chief, CIA Historical Staff
 SUBJECT          Chronology        1946-65
 1.  The CIA Historical Staff has recently
 compiled and published for your use the attached
 Chronology 1946-65, Volumes I and II.
 2.  You will note that events of historical
 interest have been tabulated in four parallel
 columns in chronological order--one column each
 for international, national, community, and CIA
 events.   The page is designed to facilitate the
 identification of related incidents.
 3. The Chronology is not,  of course,  intended
 to take the place of basic documents that would
 normally be researched and exploited by the histori-
 cal writer.   It should,  however, be useful in pro-
 viding the writer with a quick, general survey of
 the events of broad interest that occurred during
 a given time period.
 4.   This Chronology is a first edition based
 on data currently avai~ble to the CIA Historical
 Staff.   Readers having information that would
 assist the Staff in refining or correcting entries
 in this edition are invited to communicate with the
 CIA Historical Staff,         203 Key Bldg., x2621.
 5.   I trust you will find this tool useful in
 your historical research and writing,  and I welcome
 your comments and suggestions.

 Approved For Release 2011E'A-RDP90-00708R000300040001-2
 Approved For Release 28t1C0f((CIA-RDP90-00708R000300040001-2
 Foreword
 This chronology provides the Agency historian with a brief,
 factual introduction to the main currents of the two turbulent
 decades of world affairs after World War II, when the United
 States emerged as leader of the Free World and when the Central
 Intelligence Agency evolved as a significant instrument of US
 national security policy in the cold war.   The chronology
 reflects CIA's development and progress not only as a central
 agency for the analysis of intelligence information and the
 preparation of strategic intelligence estimates but also as
 an active, operational member of the US and Allied security
 system.
 The chronology consists of four parallel columns:  column
 1 cites occurrences of world-wide significance;  column 2,
 events of national interest; column 3, developments in the US
 intelligence and national security communities; and column 4,
 milestones in the evolution of the Agency.   Included are
 public events of major political, diplomatic, military,    and
 technological significance, as well as selected intra-Agency
 activities.
 In format and detail the chronology is necessarily selective
 and terse.   The historian will, of course, wish to exploit
 the many specialized chronologies in his field--both clas-
 sified and unclassified.   In addition, he will also find
 useful the historical compilations prepared by the Library
 of Congress for the Committee on Foreign Relations of the
 United States Senate such as Background Information Relating
 to Southeast Asia and Vietnam,  5th rev ed  (91st Congress,  1st
 Session,  1969)  and A Select Chronology and Background Documents
 Relating to the Middle East,  1st rev ed  (91st Congress,  1st
 Session, 1969).   The numerous entries in the Annual Index of
 the New York Times provide details on the day-to-day progress
 of public affairs; Neville Williams'   Chronology of the Modern
 World,  1st American ed, New York,  David McKay, 1967, is an
 important British compilation; Andre Fontaine's two chrono-
 logies in his History of the Cold War, New York, Pantheon,
 1965,  illuminate events from the French point of view;  and
 the latter part of William L.  Langer's An Encyclopedia of
 World History,  4th ed, Boston,  Houghton Mifflin, 1968,
 furnishes a chronological survey of the postwar period in
 its broadest historical perspective.

 CHAPTER I.  OVERALL MANAGEMENT MATTERS-
 A.                                Scope of Support Activities 1953-1956
 The magnitude of CIA's support activities increased steadily
 during the period, money-wise,  personnel-wise,  and materiel-
 wise.                          Actual expenditures rose from                 dollars for
 Fiscal Year 1953 to                dollars for Fiscal Year 1957
 with a slight dip in Fiscal Year 1953 when expenditures
 2/
 dropped to                 dollars.-    The number of civilian
 staff employees and military personnel on duty as of December
 1952 was           nd the number on duty as of December 31,
 1956, was             With the addition of temporary and part-
 time employees,  consultants and foreign nationals,  the
 latter figure is brought to more than                The dollar
 value of inventories on hand increased from                for
 Fiscal Year 1954 to                   for the first half of

 rapid rate than expenditures or personnel.   None of the
 increases were as spectacular as those which occured
 during the Smith period 1950-1953, when personnel strength
 increased two and one-half times and expenditures increased
 five and one-half times. 1/
 During the period, an important trend is to be noted
 in distribution of available funds.  Obligations for intel-
 ligence activities increased from                dollars for
 Fiscal Year 1953 to             dollars for Fiscal Year 1957
 and obligations for cold war activities decreased from
 dollars for Fiscal Year 1953 to                    25X1A
 dollars for Fiscal Year 1957.   The principal increase in
 intelligence activities was for covert intelligence col-
 lection and the principal decrease in cold war activities
 was paramilitary activities.2/  Obligations for intel-
 ligence activities rose during the period from two-fifths
 to three-fifths of all obligations and those for cold war
 activities declined from three-fifths to two-fifths.
 1/  See "Organizational History of CIA,  1950-1953"  (1957)
 especially Chapter X; in DCI/HS files.
 2/  As explained below,  Chapter II,  the analysis of obligations
 by major activity was based on a distribution of support
 costs to the different activities.   Intelligence activ-
 ities included covert collection, production, overt col-
 lection,  and reference services.   Cold war activities
 included political and psychological paramilitary activities.

 The distribution of manpower resources followed similar
 trends during the period of those shown above for financial
 obligations.   Considering staff employees only,  however,
 the concentration of manpower in intelligence operations
 was greater throughout the period than the concentration
 of financial resources.   At the beginning of the period
 two-thirds and at the end of the period three-quarters of
 staff employees were in intelligence operations as compared
 1/
 to one-third and one-quarter in cold war operations.-
 The CIA costs for foreign, positive, strategic intel-
 ligence activities were estimated by the Bureau of the
 Budget in a study for IAC to be only                of total   25X1A
 government costs for such activities in Fiscal Year 1954.
 The CIA costs rose slightly to comprise nearly                 25X1A
 during the next two fiscal years.   As far as this type of
 intelligence activity is concerned the main financial burden
 was carr:Led by the Defense Departments and related agencies.
 As used,  the term "positive" excludes by illustration Comsec,
 FBI, or internal security activities,  and "strategic" ex-
 2/
 cludes combat or tactical intelligence activities.

 The statistical trends in the distribution of man-
 power resources followed a similar but slightly different
 pattern.   For example,   the figures on staff employees
 show a greater concentration of manpower in intelligence
 activities throughout the period than there was in money
 resources.   At the beginning of the period two-thirds and
 at the end of the period three-fourths of staff employees
 were in intelligence activities.   Over the same period,
 those in cold war activities dropped from one-third to
 one-fourth. l/
 The figures for the geographical distribution of staff
 employees showed a tendency toward greater concentration
 in headquarters as compared with overseas.   While in 1953
 the DCI had expressed the view that headquarters should
 be smaller and the field expanded, 2/ the next three years
 did not bring about this development.  The proportion
 that departmental employees were of the total increased from

 60 to 63 percent during the period,  that of United States
 field employees increased from 8 to 10 percent, while
 that of overseas employees declined from 32 to 27 percent.
 In absolute numbers,  there were fewer employees overseas
 1/
 and more in headquarters in 1956 than in 1953.-    Reduc-
 tions in foreign field strength were heaviest in              25X1A
 and the Far East where the end of military occupation and
 changed political conditions made it difficult to maintain
 staffs as large as they had been at the beginning of the
 period.2/   It was difficult to tell in advance where
 people would be most needed three or four years later.
 Persons were assigned to the places where their services
 were in greatest need at the moment.
 The fact that the ratio of overseas staff employees
 to headquarters staff employees dropped from a little
 over one-half to 43 percent may have had some effect upon
 the practice of rotation between headquarters and the field.
 In theory,  if rotation is to be carried out to the fullest
 extent,  there must be an equal number of positions at
 headquarters and overseas.   This was the situation in the

 Office of Communications and the practice of rotation was
 found to be highly successful in that office. l/   The im-
 balance between headquarters and the field in the Agency
 as a whole reduced the amount of rotation that was possible
 from the theoretical point of view,  assuming two years as
 the standard tour of duty both at home and abroad.   Of
 course, many headquarters positions involved duties that
 had no relation to overseas activities and persons occupying
 those positions would not normally expect to be sent abroad.
 Planning administrative support for intelligence
 activities and for cold war activities continued to pre-
 sent serious problems.   Unforeseen emergencies arose each
 year for which advance planning was difficult.   The device
 of the contingency fund was effectively used during the
 2/
 period to meet the financial needs of such crises.    As
 far as emergency personnel needs were concerned,             not much
 headway was made in cutting down the time needed for
 security investigations,  for finding people with unusual
 qualifications, or for training promising young people
 in the tradecraft of intelligence and cold war operations.

 tingency fund and its use during the period.

 A proposal was made to establish an Actions Operations
 Unit which would provide a cadre of personnel skilled
 in all action aspects of Clandestine Services emergency
 operations, but the proposal was only partially imple-
 mented during the period.   Advance planning was also
 difficult to meet emergency materiel needs.   To obtain
 sterile equipment,  especially that of a military nature,
 was not possible on the spur of the moment.   To stockpile
 such equipment also involved many problems because of
 the multiplicity of types and the rapidity of obsolescence.
 B.   Management Advice and
 Inspection in the Agency as a Whole
 At the beginning of 1953,  the management advisory
 functions of the Agency were divided among various offices.
 The Deputy Director (Administration) was charged with establish-
 ing and maintaining a continuous management improvement
 program to insure both efficiency and economy of operations
 on an Agency-wide basis.   While management improvement with-
 in their respective spheres was a concern of all of the
 offices under the DD/A,  the Organization and Methods
 Service  (O&M) of the Office of the Comptroller was specif-
 ically charged with analyzing the organizational structure

 of all Agency components,  their functions, methods,  and
 procedures, with particular attention to personnel needs
 and staffing patterns; with furnishing technical and
 substantive guidance for utilization of business machines;
 with controlling and publishing Agency-wide regulations
 and procedures;  and with developing a forms control pro-

 records management program which included records dis-
 position, storage of vital materials, and record keeping

 existed and in order to improve efficiencies and economies.3/

 for changes in organization and procedures as well as in
 operational emphasis.      In the Office of the Director,
 the Office of Training gave general courses in management,
 supervision,  and administrative organization and cooperated
 with other offices which gave specialized courrjes on finan-
 cial,  logistics and personnel administration.      On behalf
 of the Director,  the Inspector General (IG) was charged

 with inspecting the performance of missions and/exercise

 of functions of all CIA offices and personnel.     During
 the period 1953-1956,  the IG made a survey of practically
 every office in the DD/A-DD/S group.   His recommendations
 were the source of many of the organizational changes
 made during the period,  particularly those which affected
 several offices.

 immediate office of DD/A in April 1954,  the DD/A,  the IG,

 inasmuch as the IG,  in making over-all inspections,  had
 to consider management as well as other aspects of the
 offices concerned.   It was also agreed that the IG would

 The comprehensive character of the management improve-
 ment program was revealed by the report on this subject
 made to the Bureau of the Budget for the Fiscal Year 1953
 by the DD/A.l/  The Agency program used all of the generally
 accepted techniques for reviewing operations to determine
 the effectiveness and economy of performance.   These re-
 view techniques included reports,  normal supervisory
 processes, staff conferences, budget estimates and justi-
 fications, surveys and special studies.   Every part of
 the Agency was involved in the report. The philosophy
 of the DD/A was that while any large organization needed
 to be supported with staffs,  task forces,  and other mech-
 anisms set up for purposes of planning, coordinating,
 or monitoring,  the true energy and power of an organization
 came through command channels.   He thought that a heavy
 emphasis should be placed on line management. 2/

 In the Intelligence field the management improvement
 report stated that the establishment of improved procedures,
 more effective control over the flow of intelligence infor-
 mation,                             and the scheduling of research,  had resulted in
 increased output,        the conservation of manpower and signif-
 icant economies.
 In the Operations field the report found that organ-
 izational and procedural studies conducted for the purpose
 of implementing the over-all reorganization had resulted
 in improved channels of communication between headquarters
 and the field, more efficient administration of support
 of operations, more effective manpower utilization,  and
 more effective operations.
 In the Administrative field,  the report found that
 significant gains had been made in personnel management,
 logistical support and in financial and budgetary areas.
 Improvement in personnel management was closely linked
 with the Career Service Program in all its various as-

 program could serve all of the Agency in the most effec-
 tive,  expeditious and economical manner possible.   Improved
 financial controls were established and further use was
 made of electronic accounting machine methods.
 Another unit with management advisory functions was
 the Office of the General Counsel which during the period
 was attached to DD/A-DD/S for administrative purposes.
 This Office was called upon to give advice on all high
 policy and administrative questions which involved the
 interpretation of the basic laws,  executive orders,  and
 National Security Council Directives.  It was concerned
 with a wide range of administrative procedures which had
 to conform with Federal laws and governmental regulations
 on such subjects as use of confidential funds,  incorpora-
 tion budgeting,  use of aliens, Federal procurement prac-
 tices, civil service pracrices,  travel,  government sec-
 urity of information.   As indicated below,  it reviewed
 all proposed regulations and it reviewed administrative
 plans when legal questions were involved. It furnished
 legal advice to operating officials on how certain tasks
 might be performed and, when the occasion arose,  it
 warned officials about the legal consequences of acts
 that may have been contemplated.

 C.   General Direction of Support Services
 The beginning of the Dulles administration in 1953
 came some six months after General Smith issued his
 directive of July 15,     1952, which merged the separate
 area divisions of OSO and OPC and created the FI,  PP,
 PM,   and Administrative Staffs under the jurisdiction
 of the Deputy Director (Plans).   General Smith's concept
 of the administrative arrangements which went along with
 these changes in the Clandestine Services was based on
 the following three principles:
 a. The control administrative organization is not
 extended separately and in parallel to the op-
 erational command system.
 b. Officers responsible for operations,  insofar as
 our resources permit, are allocated personnel,
 funds,  and materiel adequate for the performance
 of the missions assigned to them.   They are held
 responsible both for the success of their opera-
 tions and for the practical and effective expen-
 diture of the means allocated.
 c. Subject to paragraphs a. and b. above, the Deputy
 Director (Administration) is responsible for all
 administrative support for the Agency.   This re-
 sponsibility extends on operational levels to in-
 clude appropriate audits and inspections of the
 handling of funds and materiel allocated to op-
 erating offices .1/

 The DD/P was responsible to DCI for all clandestine
 activities.   The Chief of Administration on the staff of
 DD/P had a position similar to the G-1--G-4 for a field
 army who had no command over the offices rendering ad-
 ministrative support but who was responsible for insuring
 that such support was arranged and provided for.
 During the first year following the July 1952 directive
 DD/A worked towards implementing this system.   He eliminated
 considerable overlapping and duplication.   About 200 admin-
 istrative-type positions in the clandestine services area
 were eliminated and the functions performed by these
 people were absorbed with relatively minor expansion else-
 where.   Integration of overseas activities with the Head-
 quarters system remained to be completed.                               This involved
 developing new regulations and indoctrinating and training
 personnel to implement them.
 DD/A took the position that the resources devoted
 to administration should be the minimum that would insure
 the success of the mission and not less.    He could not
 arbitrarily decide that for a given year only a certain
 1
 proportion of the budget would be expended for administration.-

 There were instances in which to accomplish given missions
 practically all of the costs might be called "administra-
 tion."  All too frequently an operation was unsuccessful
 because of failure to provide at the outset a well conceived
 administrative support plan and to make timely provisions
 for funds and materiel to carry it out.
 For Fiscal Year 1953 administrative support provided
 by the central administrative offices made up about 11 per-
 cent of the total budget. I/  About one-third of this admin-
 istrative support was for security.   Spread out in some
 buildings,  the guard service along cost more
 than $1,000,000 annually. Support costs under DD/A did
 not include all costs of administration.   Personnel doing
 administrative work were found in all parts of the Agency.
 In some cases it was almost impossible to separate admin-
 istrative support costs from operational costs.
 For Fiscal Year 1956 administrative support provided
 by the central administrative offices on a basis comparable

 to that mentioned in the above paragraph consititued
 about 9 percent of the total budget. 1/  This appears
 to represent a scaling down of the proportion of admin-
 istrative costs although it must be remembered that the
 obligations for Fiscal Year 1956 contained some special
 projects which were not in the earlier budget.   Certainly
 it can be said that there was no increase in adminis-
 trative costs as reckoned in this fashion.   Of course,
 the addition of the Communications and the Training
 Offices during the period brought the proportion of sup-
 port costs under DD/S to a higher figure,  namely 22
 percent of the total budget.

 As far as organizational matters were concerned,
 Col. White held to the principle that there should be a
 unified system of support for the entire Agency.   He
 took the position that there should be a single DD/S and
 that no support functions should be set up separately
 in DCI.l/  His views were to prevail in early 1955.
 While the Assistant Directors of Communications, Personnel,
 and Training were nominally grouped with the three Deputies
 into what was called in the Agency the "Big Six," actually
 the three Assistant Directors were the "Little Three" and
 they did not come to morning meetings of the Deputies
 through which the Director ran the Agency.   Col. White
 pointed out that personnel matters were closely linked
 with budget,  financial,  and security matters.   In February
 1955, the Director, on his own initiative, decided to con-
 centrate responsibility for all administrative support
 matters in DD/A.   It was his idea to merge DD/P/Admin and
 DD/A.   Col. White talked to DD/P and his Chief of Opera-
 tions about the change and at first he met resistance.
 Finally DD/P said to Col. White,  "You take it."   The

 Director added, "I'm going to put personnel back under
 "Red" (Col. White)."  Then the IG said, "If you're going
 to do this, why not put OTR and Commo also under DD/A."
 General Cabell said about the plan, "I buy that."  Then
 someone said, "Let's call the office DD/S, after the analogy
 of military support functions."  The reorganization order
 of February 1955 was the result.l/
 When DD/S was first organized, Col. White appointed
 a number of functional assistants.  He had a Special Assis-
 tant to DD/S (Logistics), a similar officer for Finance,
 one for Personnel, one for Training, and one for Admin-
 istrative Career Service.   The theory behind these
 special assistants was that the DD/S would have to solve
 many administrative problems and these specialists would
 be in touch with the different office chiefs.   Experience
 showed that his system meant that the work was handled
 twice.   In 1956 the IG recommended that the DD/S dis-
 continue liaison-type Special Assistants, and instead
 develop a small personal staff of carefully selected

 generalists qualified to assist him in developing and
 coordinating policies of over-all DD/S applications.
 The DD/S concurred and indicated that the Special Assis-

 who remained had responsibility for special assignments
 but they also functioned as generalists.   They had had
 overseas assignments or had worked with DD/P organiza-
 tions and understood operational and administrative prob-
 lems.   He was developing a staff of generalists of this
 sort who understood the Clandestine Services. I/
 The IG's survey of the Office of DD/S made in 1956
 implied that the DD/S tried to carry too much of the
 support load personally and recommended that the DCI
 establish an Executive Director, or Chief of Staff,  re-
 sponsible for supervising and coordinating activities
 transcending the responsibilities of more than one
 Deputy.   The DD/S regarded this as equivalent to estab-
 lishing a fourth Deputy Directorate which would mean
 that the Deputy Directors for Intelligence and Plans

 their total support rather than one and which would comp-
 licate rather than simplify existing supervisory and

 coordinating mechanisms and procedures.
 In a similar vein,  the IG recommended that the DCI
 relieve the DD/S of personal responsibility for special
 assignments,  such as the new building,              and permit the
 DD/S to devote maximum time to the direction of the
 twelve offices and staffs reporting to him.   The DD/S
 said that he thought the new building was appropriately
 assigned to the DD/S.   While it imposed a heavy load,
 it was a job which required continuing high level atten-
 tion.   Col. White doubted seriously that any other
 arrangement would have been less of a headache either
 to DD/S or the Director. 2/
 During the period the centralization of support
 functions remained under the DD/S.   The Director did
 not appoint a Chief of Staff or take the new building

 Special Administrative Support for DD/P
 Prior to the reorganization of February 1955,  the
 Chief of Administration,  DD/P,  reported to DD/P,  not to
 DD/A.     Under this system it was impossible for the Director
 to hold DD/A responsible for all administrative support
 matters.   There were many projects which were handled
 directly by DD/P/Admin.   The trouble with this setup was
 (1)  that DD/P/Admin tended to be a bottle neck through
 which the area divisions and staffs had to go to get
 services needed and  (2) that he had no line control over
 support officers.   DD/P/Admin was an unnecessary channel
 and he did not have authority over the Comptroller and
 other support officers upon whom he depended for support
 services.   By changing the name of DD/P/Admin to Special
 Support Assistant and placing him in DD/S,  the two dis-
 advantages were eliminated.   SSA/DD/S became an extension
 of DD/S and when SSA went to the Comptroller or to other

 After a year and a half of experience with the SSA
 arrangement,  the IG proposed a return to the old plan.
 In a memorandum for the Director,  Col. White defended
 the SSA/DDS plan as follows:
 The authorities delegated by the DD/P to SSA/DDS
 do in a sense require that the SSA "serve two
 masters," but the delegations are clearly on ad-
 ministrative matters.   I feel strongly that a DD/P
 administrative staff should not duplicate DD/S
 functional components.   I believe our present or-
 ganization has proven its soundness in this respect...
 There is no question in my mind that the present
 arrangement whereby the Comptroller furnishes the
 budget and fiscal service to the DD/P is in the
 Agency's best interest.   I do not concur in re-
 turning these responsibilities to the DD/P.
 SSA representatives have done much to establish a
 bond between operations and support and have pro-
 vided "spot" assistance in all administrative
 fields.   Because of physical proximity to the DD/P
 offices there has been a tendency for SSA represen-
 tatives to engage in some support activities pro-
 vided by major offices.   This had decreased greatly
 and the SSA representatives are devoting their
 efforts to assisting DD/P in staffing of sensitive
 matters,  coordinating and helping on matters in-
 volving major policy,  and insuring that Clandestine
 Services receive adequate, proper and timely support
 in their activities. I shall continue to make every
 effort to improve this situation.1/

 of the successful operation of the system lay in the
 development of a corps of senior support officers who
 had served in a variety of positions at headquarters in
 both the DD/S and DD/P organizations,  as well as in. the
 field.   Rotation and cross-fertilization brought a better
 personal understanding between personnel engaged in Op-
 erations,  Intelligence,  and Support.                               At the end of the
 period about 80 percent of the senior support officers
 in DD/S had had such experience.
 Career service in support functions was accepted
 by Clandestine Services after the reorganization of 1955.
 DD/P looked to DD/S components to hire and train support
 specialists.   This was done on a world-wide basis and it
 facilitated the rotation and career development of ad-
 ministrative personnel.
 In the immediate office of DD/A there was an Assis-
 tant DD/A.   Col. White held this position from about
 December 1951 until May 21,  1954, when he was officially
 appointed DD/A.   After a lapse of four months the appoint-
 ment of Mr. H. Gates Lloyd,                           senior DD/P officer,  as

 Mr. Lloyd held that position until February 1955 when
 he was appointed Assistant DD/S in connection with the
 reorganization.   The Assistant Deputy Director became

 DD/S.

 for projects which did not lend themselves to the ordin-

 August 1956 the IG recommended that the Staff as an entity
 be abolished,  that its function of the preparation of
 Administrative Plans be assigned to appropriate DD/P
 components,  and that technical guidance to DD/P components
 in the preparation of Administrative Plans be provided
 by the Office of the Comptroller.   DD/S opposed placing

 As a part of the reorganization of February 1955,
 the Commercial Division,  DD/P, was reassigned to the

 the IG to make a survey of the Commercial Staff.   The

 were to oversee the development and operation of such
 companies,  and of any project operations with commercial
 aspects.   It also was expected to provide technical and
 professional competence in the field of business,  to en-
 sure that such projects, with their large budgets, were
 handled in accord with good business practice and in the
 1/
 best over-all interest of the Agency.-    The Commercial
 Staff was both an internal protective device,  and a
 mechanism for advancing operations through the preserva-
 tion of cover,  the stretching of funds,                         etc.
 Initially,  all new proprietary,      subsidy, operational
 investment and preclusive buying projects passed through
 the Commercial Staff for review, sign-off,  comment,  and
 concurrence before they finally were approved at the
 higher levels.     With the establishment,  in April 1955,
 of the Office of SSA/DDS,  an initial review of projects
 was made by SSA/DDS.   Thus,  only those new projects
 actions which,  in the view of SSA/DDS,    had commercial
 implications were forwarded to Commercial Staff for

 coordination and comment.   This development,  in effect,
 cut the Commercial Staff out of the early planning phases
 of many projects,  as often plans were drawn and commit-
 ments made before projects were presented for SSA/DDS
 review and approval.       A later requirement, however,
 that Administrative Plans accompany Project Outlines
 through the Project Review Committee brought the Commer-
 cial Staff more actively back into the proprietary pro-
 ject planning cycle.
 Until April 1957, PAPS continued to have responsi-
 bility for the drafting of Administrative Plans.   The
 Commercial Staff was required to coordinate, and some-
 times even draft, appropriated sections of Plans.  Over
 a period of time, however, PAPS developed a tendency to
 develop Plans so detailed in all their aspects that it
 often was impossible for case officers,  and the project
 organizations,  to comply and still effectively utilize
 the project mechanism for covert operations.   Ultimately,
 it was realized that there must be a middle ground be-
 tween efficient commercial management,                             and effective
 operations.

 The solution of the problem of management of com-
 mercial companies was the assignment to the Commercial
 Staff the function of advising and assisting Agency com-
 ponents in the commercial and business aspects of their
 operations as they related to the establishment,  opera-
 tion, or liquidation of proprietary, investment and
 subsidy activities.   This concept placed the Staff pri-
 marily,  although not exclusively,  in an advisory and
 consulting role, with a capacity for supervision or
 direct control of project company management when specif-
 ically requested.                              During 1953-1956,  the Commercial Staff
 assumed direct operating responsibility for six projects.
 In addition,  it normally had operating responsibility
 for projects in liquidation.
 During the period under consideration,  and at the
 request of the DD/S,  an internal study group, with rep-
 resentatives from Commercial Staff, Office of the General
 Counsel,  and PAPS,  completed in December 1956 a study of
 "Business, Banking and Legal Practices in Covert Projects
 under Non-Government Cover."  This group pointed up the
 continuing need and usefulness of proprietary cover,
 and offered a number of suggestions for improving its
 use.

 In addition to its frequent relationships with PAPS,
 SSA/DDS,  and the General Councel's Office,  the Commercial
 Staff had business with the Audit Staff, Central Cover,
 and the Office of the Comptroller.   In arranging for
 the audit of Agency proprietaries,   the Audit Staff fre-
 quently levied management and accounting requirements
 on the Commercial Staff.   The Central Cover Division of
 DD/P was concerned with the utility and mechanics of
 placing individuals under the cover of business organiza-
 tions under proprietary projects.                             During the period,  the
 Commercial Staff had to resolve its differences of opin-
 ion with Central Cover Division as to procedure and
 technique.   With the Technical Accounting Staff on the
 Office of the Comptroller,  the Commercial Staff main-
 tained day-to-day relationships regarding systems of
 accounts for Agency business organizations.
 Administrative Support for DD/I
 The DD/I did not have as many and as complicated
 administrative problems as the DD/P.   A larger propor-
 tion of the DD/I personnel were located in headquarters
 and most of those in the field were not under the same
 strict security controls that characterized the DD/P

 At the beginning of the period both the DD/I and the
 DD/P had their own administrative staffs which were de-
 signed to maintain liaison with the administrative sup-
 port staffs and to expedite the obtaining of financial,
 personnel,  logistical, communications,  and other forms
 of administrative support.   As has been pointed out
 above,  the administrative staff of DD/P was transferred
 to the 1)D/S under the reorganization of February 1955.
 This did not happen to the administrative staff of the
 DD/I.
 In his 1956 Survey of the Office of DD/S,  the IG
 recommended that DD/S confer with the DD/I,  establish a
 program for the rotation of administrative career per-
 sonnel between the two areas,  and develop other broad
 policies designed to incorporate DD/I more fully into
 Agency support Planning activities.

 The DD/S conferred with the DD/I regarding the lo-
 cation of administrative career people in the DD/I area.
 The DD/I preferred to place these administrative people
 under the DD/I career services.   As a result of this
 policy,     administrative people in DD/I had limited oppor-
 tunities for rotation or promotion as compared with the
 administrative people under the Support Career Service.
 Administrative people in DD/I soon reached a ceiling
 and had no place to go.   DD/S could not remedy this sit-
 uation as long as the DD/I kept to this policy.
 Management Improvement Advisory Services in DD/S
 During the first fifteen months of the period
 there was some shifting about of the management improve-
 ment services within the DD/A area but the backbone of
 the services remained the Organization and Methods
 Service (O&M) which started out in the Office of the
 Comptroller.   On February 17,  1953,  the standard Agency

 While the MS remained for the balance of the period
 in the DD/A--DD/S group, 1/ -   there was some discussion of
 moving the function to a higher echelon.   In 1956 the IG
 recommended that the MS be transferred to the Office of
 the Director and that it come under the immediate super-
 vision of the DDCI or of an Executive Director if such
 a position were established.   The DD/S held that such
 a move would violate the Director's concept of minimizing
 the number of component heads reporting to his office and
 it would dilute the responsibility of operators.   He
 knew of no instance in which a Deputy Director had
 failed to cooperate with the MS in its present organiza-

 Early in the period,  three O&M sections were estab-
 lished,  one each for the DD/P,  DD/I,  and DD/A--DD/S
 areas. This arrangement was challenged in 1956 by the
 IG who recommended that the three sections be consolid-
 ated into a single staff under the supervision of a
 Chief, O&M,  reporting to the Chief, MS.   The DD/S replied
 that sectionalizing the small O&M Staff had been desir-
 able because it permitted specialization resulting in
 the ability to deal with problems effectively.   Special-
 ists in management who were daily assigned to an opera-
 tional entity found greater acceptance, more freedom of
 action and more positive inter-change of ideas than
 generalists in management. l/
 The Agency management improvement program used all
 of the generally accepted techniques for reviewing opera-
 tions to determine the effectiveness and economy of per-
 formance.   These review techniques included reports,
 normal supervisory processes, staff conferences, budget
 estimates and justifications,  surveys and special studies. 2/

 Management studies by the Management Staff were conducted
 in collaboration with operating personnel.   Internally the
 MS used a coordinated "team" approach, bringing to bear

 The Chief of MS designated the O&M representative as the
 focal point for using the collaborative approach in manage-

 During the period the Records Management Staff con-
 ducted surveys in more than two-thirds of the CIA offices
 to develop records control schedules.   One of the purposes
 of these schedules was the saving of office space by the
 retirement and destruction of records not in active use
 in conformance with the requirements of the Federal Re-
 2/
 cords Act of 1950.-    The schedules were inventories of
 the records of each office on which was indicated the
 "temporary" or "permanent" character of each file.   Tem-
 porary records were marked for destruction after varying
 lapses of time.   The program also included maintaining
 storage and reference services for retired records.   For

 this purpose a CIA Records Center was established to
 house temporary records for short periods of time and
 permanent records indefinitely.   During the first part
 of the period the Records Center was located in temporary
 quarters in Rosslyn, Virginia, but in April 1955 it was

 1/
 to house CIA records.-
 A feature of the Records Management Program was the
 designation by each office of an Area Records Officer
 who had responsibility for maintaining an internal re-
 cords program. 2/   In 1956 the IG recommended that the
 designation of such officers be discontinued.   The DD/S
 stated that he did not believe discontinuance of Area
 Records Officers would be practical.   Operating Officials
 could best avail themselves of the services of the Re-
 cords Management Staff through a knowledgeable individual

 sponsible for actively supervising the record processing

 One measure of its accomplishments which the Records
 Management Staff used was the amount of records trans-
 ferred to the Records Center and the amount destroyed.
 Total records in the Center at the end of Fiscal Year
 1956 amounted to 27,903 cubic feet, equivalent to 3,488
 safe cabinets with a replacement value of over $1,000,000.
 Up to this time some 4,875 cubic feet of records had
 been destroyed.2/
 The Records Management Staff also furnished infor-
 mation to the operating offices regarding the Vital Materials
 Program.   It helped develop Vital Materials Records Sched-
 ules for all Agency offices for the deposit of Vital Ma-
 terials in accordance with Agency needs and Office of De-

 Throughout the Agency there was continued interest

 The DD/S group took the lead in trying to streamline the
 regulations so as to simplify reporting and accounting.
 Some of the offices under DD/S filled in the gaps and
 thoroughly revised the regulations concerning their
 activities.  This was particularly true of the account-

 after the end of the period under consideration a

 Staffing and Career Service in the Support Area
 The number of civilian employees in the DD/A--DD/S
 group increased from         as of December 31,  1952 to
 _ as of January 31,       1957.   Almost all of this in-
 crease came in Communications, Training,  Logistics,
 Security,  and Personnel Offices. 1/  The immediate Office
 of Deputy increased three-fold but this was largely the
 result of the addition of DD/P/Admire and Regulations
 Control.   The Office of the Comptroller and the Manage-
 ment Staff remained fairly stable during the period.
 In relation to the total manpower strength of the Agency,
 the DD/S group remained around 30 percent during the
 entire period.   In other words,  it grew about the same
 rate as other parts of the Agency.
 Each of the six main offices under DD/S had its own

 had its own Panel, while the others were grouped under the
 Administration Career Service Board.  As pointed out below,
 the Office of Communications was a pilot office for devel-

 While the 1960 Survey on Career Service by the IG
 was made after the period under discussion,  the replies
 received from the DD/S components reflected experience
 which had been gained during the period 1953-1956.   There
 was general agreement in the reports of DD/S Office Heads
 on the Survey that the IG condemned too strongly the system
 and its shortcomings and failed to recognize some accomp-
 lishments it had achieved.   Most commentators were unwill-
 ing to accept the statements or implications that the
 career system had failed. There was objection to the idea
 that "throughout the Agency career planning is viewed as
 a burdensome exercise," that "the Agency has little to

 Responsibility for the financial administration

 basic functions:   (1) budgeting or planning for securing

 resources and providing the basic records in discharging

 were spent for the purposes intended and within the pro-
 visions of Federal laws and regulations; and (3) evaluat-
 ing or utilizing financial reports to analyze costs and
 program accomplishments in relation to planned operations.
 The Director of Central Intelligence continued to
 make key decisions regarding the Agency's budget in accor-
 dance with general government procedures.   He first re-
 viewed the summarized office estimates and discussed them
 with the Bureau of the Budget for budget ceiling purposes.
 He then determined the financial and operating policy and
 approved budget allowances for each component within the
 budget ceiling agreed to by the Bureau of the Budget.   The
 submission of Agency estimates to the Bureau of the Budget
 and their justification at Bureau of the Budget hearings
 were also functions of his office.   His approval was then
 secured for the changes made necessary by action of the
 President on the recommendations of the Bureau of the Budget.
 The Director also appeared personally at the hearings
 before the appropriation committees of Congress.   Finally,
 he approved the allocations of the appropriated funds to
 CIA components.l/

 The financial administration of CIA was not disturbed
 greatly when Mr. Allen Dulles replaced General Smith as
 Director of Central Intelligence.   A$ Deputy Director of
 Central Intelligence from August 23,  1951 to February 26,
 1953, Mr. Dulles assisted General Smith in the presentation
 of CIA estimates for Fiscal Year 1953 to the Bureau of the
 Budget and to Congress.   As soon as Mr.  Dulles was sworn
 in as Director of Central Intelligence on February 26,  1953,
 he became fully responsible for the presentation of CIA
 Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1954 to Congress.
 In making decisions on certain budget matters, par-
 ticularly those concerning the DD/P,  the Director con-
 tinued to be advised by the Project Review Committee.                         As
 of January 1953 the PRC was composed of the DDCI, Chairman,
 DD/P,  DD/I,  and DD/A members,  and an Executive Assistant
 to the DCL.as Recording Secretary.!/ In March 1955 the
 Special Assistant to the DCI for Planning and Coordination

 named as nonvoting members and the Recording Secretary
 was listed without any other designation.   These changes
 marked the increasing importance of Mr.
 the new Chairman, in the top affairs of the Agency. 1/
 At the beginning of the period the chief function of
 the PRC was the review of projects as it had been from the
 time of setting up the committee in 1948.   A project was
 an operational entity or unit of operations, to which funds
 and other resources were allotted for use in performance.
 For each project a project outline was required describing
 specific objective or objectives, means to be employed,
 and support requirements in sufficient detail necessary to
 obtain consideration and approval of the project.2/
 In preparing a project outline,  the originating divi-
 sion was directed to cite or quote relevant policy docu-
 ments such as NSC directives; State, Defense, JCS or OCB
 policy papers; CIA plans and programs; and other documents

 or statements, memoranda, or cables having policy impli-

 trative plans were required for projects which had to be
 conducted under cover or operational circumstances which
 did not permit adherence to all relevant Agency regula-
 tions and procedures.  An administrative plan was a
 written document which set forth the authorities and con-
 trols which were to govern the conduct of a project entity,
 the relationship of the project entity with the Agency,
 and internal Agency requirements where it was necessary to
 depart from normal Agency requirements.   Every proprietary,
 large subsidy, and operational investment project required
 an administrative plan and other projects might be covered
 by an administrative plan when the Deputy Director con-
 l/
 cerned regarded it as necessary.       Except for project
 requesting less than $25,000 in any one fiscal year, all
 projects required approval by the DCI before they could
 receive or spend any funds.
 In March 1955,  the PRC was also directed to perform
 staff functions for the Director in connection with the

 approval of Agency programs.   A program was defined as
 a major classification of work or effort of an Agency com-

 Programs presented for approval included all new projects
 and support activities as well as projects and support
 activities that were approved in the prior fiscal year or
 years and were being recommended for continuance during
 the current fiscal year. 1-/   In making recommendations to
 the Director, the PRC was directed to consider from the
 point of view of the Agency as a whole all projects, plans,
 and operational activities in terms of the following criteria:
 consistency of what was proposed with Government policy;
 need for what was proposed, including evaluation of the
 relative worth of anticipated results; feasibility of what
 was proposed,  including security considerations; and con-

 preliminary estimates which were the basis for subsequent
 presentations, the first of which was at the hearings held
 by the Comptroller.        These estimates were over-all office
 requirements presented on a program basis and were designed
 to help the Director make the final determination as to
 direction and scope of the Agency programs.   The com-
 ponents then compiled detailed justifications of the
 allowances made to them by the Director to be used in
 preparing estimates to be submitted to the Bureau of the
 Budget some eight months before the beginning of the fiscal
 year.   The supporting document was in much more detail and
 was designed not only to present the program requirements,
 but to give the organizational and object support of those
 requirements.   The components then contributed their share
 to the Congressional Budget Submission which represented
 the budget for the Agency that the President was willing
 to recommend to Congress.   This presentation was similar
 to that of the Bureau of the Budget submission but it re-
 flected any changes that the President directed to be made
 in the Agency programs or resources.   This stage came three
 or four months before the beginning of the fiscal year.

 The Agency components were also involved in all three
 stages of the execution of the budget cycle.--    They first
 made their contribution to the Operating Budget Estimates
 which reflected their current estimate of their program
 requirements in relation to the plans presented to Con-
 gress and the year just being completed.   This stage came
 less than one month before the beginning of the fiscal
 year and formed the basis on which the Director made deci-
 sions on the allocation of resources approved by Congress
 in the form of an appropriation.   The second stage was the
 granting of authorities to operating officials to plan and
 conduct activities within financial limitations.   The
 third stage was the review of execution which consisted
 of a continuous analysis of actual operations in relation
 to planned budgeted operations using accounting and oper-
 ating report data.

 Budget Cycles for Fiscal Years 1953 through 1957
 Before taking up the history of each fiscal year, a
 few general observations about some of the peculiarities
 of CIA's budget process are in order.   In view of the
 Agency practice of activating new projects to exploit
 targets of opportunity whenever fortuitous circumstances
 indicated a possibility of success, it was difficult to
 anticipate long in advance the exact nature of the finan-
 cial support that might be needed.   Particularly in the
 early part of the period,  the Agency requested more funds
 that it found later it could use.
 Another characteristic of CIA's budget was the dis-
 tribution between the fund for operations and the reserve
 fund for contingencies.    The fund for operations was the
 fund for those continuing and planned activities that
 could be justified on the assumption that the general
 international situation would remain substantially as it
 was during the fiscal year which has just been completed.
 The fund for operations was backed by experience and by
 plans which assumed no startling new developments.   The
 reserve fund for contingencies, on the other hand, was a
 special fund which could not be used unless some new and
 unexpected crisis occurred which could not be met out of
 regular funds in connection with intelligence and cold war

 operations.   Emergency CIA actions called for by National
 Security Council directives required swifter procedures
 than the supplemental Congressional appropriation which
 took eighteen months.   In July 1951 CIA in a submission
 to the Bureau of the Budget for Fiscal Year 1952 included
 an item of              dollars to provide for a con-
 tingency fund. l/  The DCI stated that this contingency
 fund had the informal concurrence of representatives of
 the JCS, and the Departments of State and Defense, after
 a review of current commitments and programs in relation
 to the international situation.2/  Congress authorized a
 contingency fund of this size for Fiscal Year 1952 on the
 condition that it could be used as released by the Bureau
 of the Budget.   When an emergency arose, what usually
 happened was the National Security Council directed CIA to
 take appropriate action.   If CIA lacked the funds to meet
 the crisis,  it requested the Bureau of the Budget to re-
 lease the funds needed from the emergency fund.   The
 Bureau of the Budget, on its part, was primarily concerned

 with whether the activity had been contemplated in the
 preparation of the annual budget and whether the increase
 could be absorbed within the regular funds.  An appeal
 could be made to the President from a decision by the
 Bureau of the Budget.   During the period,  CIA considered
 making an appeal to the President on several occasions,
 but the questions were settled by negotiations with the
 Bureau of the Budget.   In general, the Bureau of the Budget
 acted favorably on requests for releases from the con-
 tingency fund and the device worked smoothly. 1/
 The need for security furnished an additional reason
 for the CIA contingency fund.   The nature of the objectives
 which Congress and the National Security Council set for
 CIA and the methods that had to be used to achieve these
 objectives demanded concealment of the size of funds
 involved.   Information regarding the Agency's budget was
 obviously a priority target for hostile intelligence
 services.   It was much easier to conceal a release from
 the reserve fund than it was to conceal a request and
 hearing on a supplemental appropriation which had to come

 of this request for "supplemental" funds and recommended
 that the President present to Congress the same estimate
 as he had presented for the preceding fiscal year, a. total
 reserve fund for contingencies.   In defending the estimates
 before the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Com-

 fund for contingencies be appropriated on a no-year basis

 and the unobliga.ted balance be carried over each year.
 CIA officials had earlier explained that this procedure
 would produce a. substantial saving in the Government's
 cash budget and would reduce the amount of the CIA budget

 which had to be hidden in various appropriations.
 Congress acted favorably on the idea. of a carry-over and
 authorized for the Fiscal Year 1955 the carrying forward
 of the sum of                  dollars which had been originally

 The Office Estimates for Fiscal Year 1956 as prepared

 In discussing this request for Fiscal Year 1956 at the

 General Cabell indicated that the covert collection of
 intelligence and political and psychological activities
 would be increased slightly over current levels while the

 it was a matter of long term Agency policy to continue
 strengthening covert collection of intelligence by all
 means available including scientific means. I/    The Bureau
 of the Budget recommended for the first and only time dur-
 ing this period that the President present the requested
 figure to Congress unchanged.   The funds requested were
 the same as those appropriated for the two preceding
 fiscal years except for a               dollar reduction in    25X1A
 the contingency fund.   CIA's budget was now on a plateau
 of cold war operations.
 In March 1955 when the Agency defended the request
 for Fiscal Year 1956 before the House Appropriations Sub-
 committee, it was too late in the Budget cycle to make a
 request for new funds to restore the reserve on which
 there had been a heavy drain during Fiscal Year 1955.
 Such a request should have been started with submission
 to the Bureau of the Budget the preceding fall and at
 that time the releases from the reserve were yet to come.
 The DCI proposed that Congress continue to make the un-
 obligated balance of the reserve fund available from year

 Section 10 of the Central Intelligence Act of 1949
 stated in part:
 Section 10.(b)  The sums made available to
 the Agency may be extended without regard to the
 provisions of law and regulations relating to
 the expenditure of Government funds; and for
 objects of a confidential, extraordinary,
 emergency nature, such expenditures to be ac-
 counted for solely on the certificate of the
 Director and every such certificate shall be
 deemed a, sufficient voucher for the amount
 therein certified.l/
 The CIA General Regulations on Confidential Funds
 interpreted this law as meaning that Congress is granting
 this extraordinary authority for expenditure of public
 funds was voicing its determination to afford the Agency
 all of the means that might be required in the performance
 of its mission.   The Regulation further stated that
 Congress, in effect, gave recognition to the following
 principles:
 a.   Intelligence operations require the use
 of methods which do not always conform to law or
 regulation.   No law could be drafted to contain
 all of the precise authorities and policies
 needed for the conduct of intelligence operations.

 of intelligence operations, or the identities
 of persons so engaged from unauthorized dis-
 closure is essential la a secure and effective
 intelligence service.-
 The law was interpreted as meaning that for the
 support of strictly covert operations and for extra-
 ordinary or emergency requirements, where the nature of
 CIA activities precluded compliance with other statutes
 and procedures and normal Government audit by the General
 Accounting Office, CIA funds would be expended under the
 authority cited above which made the certification of the
 Director of Central Intelligence a final accounting to
 all outside agencies.   This permitted the Agency to con-
 duct all audits internally on what it called confidential
 or unvouchered funds.   Confidential funds were those funds
 which did not have to be accounted for in detail outside
 the Agency.   Instead these funds were obligated and expended
 under authorities and regulations prescribed by the
 Director of Central Intelligence and were accounted for
 to the Department of the Treasury and the General Account-
 ing Office without disclosure of details involved solely

 upon the certification of the Director that the amounts
 indicated were property expended for confidential
 1/
 purposes
 The Agency interpretation of the law continued to be
 that large portions of its headquarters activities, while
 highly classified,  could be audited securely in confor-
 mance with normal Government procedures and were, there-
 fore, subject to standard Government law and regulations
 and a final audit by the General Accounting Office.   The
 funds used for these activities were, therefore, called
 vouchered funds and it was the responsibility of Agency
 officials to see that vouchered funds were used insofar
 as operational security and requirements of operations
 would permit.2/
 All obligations and expenditures, vouchered and un-
 vouchered, had to be accounted for, and the degree and
 form of accounting had to be the optimum compatible with
 the maintenance of reasonable security for Agency oper-
 ations and the protection of the sources of intelligence.
 This standard was an expression of the belief that ac-

 being a deterrent to the misuse or loss of funds, was a
 primary tool for the exercise of efficient management
 and direction of an intelligence organization.-
 Early in 1953, Mr. Dulles expressed a great concern
 regarding responsibilities which went with the financial
 powers of the Agency:
 President Eisenhower said to General Cabell
 and me the other day, very earnestly:   "Your agency
 has the largest amount of unvouchered funds of any
 agency in government.   I realize that it is neces-
 sary that you have them.   But those unvouchered
 funds must be a sacred trust; and you must see to
 it that there is no abuse of the confidence and
 privilege which is reposed in you and in the Agency
 in handling those funds."   I want that word to go
 right through this Agency.   I'm going to watch the
 use of unvouchered funds with the greatest care
 and see that they can be justified in their expen-
 diture just as much as other funds, even though we
 have V e privilege of not advertising how we spend
 them.-

 Finance Division extended detailed budget and related
 funding controls to several major proprietary projects.
 The device of the administrative plan was used to
 describe the special procedures needed for a given project.
 In very rare cases (for 1954, 2 percent of all projects)
 the magnitude or sensitivity of the project made the admin-
 strative plan procedures unsuitable and the project oper-
 ated under a blanket waiver authorized by the Director. 1/
 The Inspector General recommended in 1954 that certain
 minimal standards should be established and enforced for
 all projects granted blanket waivers, such as:   consul-
 tation with the Comptroller's staff, avoiding large lump
 sum payments to a principal, and requirement of summary
 2/
 accounting statements from the operations officer.-  The
 Comptroller pointed out that these recommendations,
 although basically sound, might not be applicable to
 every project,  and it was impracticable and unwise to
 attempt to force these few highly unusual projects into

 Audit Staff
 During the period the audit functions of the Agency
 were clarified and re-emphasized by a number of regula-
 tory issuances.   A March 1953 statement of the mission of
 the Auditor-in-Chief said that he was responsible for the
 audit (exclusive of internal audit) of all finance, fiscal,
 and property matters not under procedures laid down by the
 2/
 General Accounting Office.      In other words, the emphasis
 was on the final audit of all financial accounts involving
 unvouchered (confidential) funds.   This was a post-audit
 which was a verification that the financial records in-
 volving unvouchered funds were accurate as compiled under
 the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller.   Since
 two-thirds of the expenditures were unvouchered during the
 period this was a major task.!/

 more comprehensive statement of the audit mission was
 issued which made it clear that the Auditor-in-Chief was
 also responsible for the review of procedures for con-
 ducting internal audits of vouchered funds prior to final
 1/
 audit by the General Accounting Office.-     This Regulation
 likewise directed the Auditor-in-Chief to report to the
 Director any activities of the Agency which he found as
 a result of his audit to be uneconomical,  inefficient, or
 improper and to recommend to the Director and the appro-
 priate responsible officials changes in the interest of
 efficiency and protection of Government funds and
 property.
 While there were name changes affecting the auditing
 officers, the organizational position of the officers
 remained unchanged.   From January 1953 to February 1955,
 the Auditor-in-Chief and the Audit Office under his
 supervision were attached to the immediate office of the
 2/
 DD/A.     The Auditor-in-Chief also supervised the Field
 Audit Units. 1/   After the February 1955 reorganization

 Chief was renamed Chief, Audit Staff, and reappointed to
 the immediate office of the DD/S.1/   The former Audit
 Office became the Headquarters Audit Division, Audit
 Staff, and the former Field Audit Units became Audit
 Staff Branches Offices.
 During the period final auditing continued to be dif-
 ferentiated from accounting and auditing prior to payment,
 from property accountability, from management improve-
 ment, and from general inspection, but it was always
 closely related to these functions.  According to account-
 ing theory and practice, the final audit should be inde-
 pendent of the pre-audit.   The Audit Staff, in making
 final audits, was separate from the Office of the Comp-
 troller and made an independent check on the pre-audits
 performed by the Office of the Comptroller.   Both the
 Chief, Audit Staff, and the Comptroller, however, were
 under the DD/S.   The Chief, Audit Staff, reported to the
 DCI through the DD/S.   These relationships were not
 regarded by the Chief, Audit Staff, as limitations on his

 During the period the Audit Staff made a number of
 improvements in its auditing of all property accounts.
 In 1955 it initiated an audit of financial property
 accounting and it placed the audits of property stored
 at all Agency-controlled depots and warehouses on an
 annual basis.   It also audited "in-use" property accounts
 in domestic and overseas field stations.   It worked
 closely with Logistics personnel on inventory, reconcil-
 iation, document control and procedural phases of the
 property program. 2/    Its auditing of property accounts
 included test checking property accounting records to
 determine that property purchased or issued to the Agency

 The Audit Staff audited all proprietary projects

 satisfactory cover arrangements could not be made in
 time. 2/    Proprietary projects were audited by Agency

 The work of the Audit Staff continued upward during
 the period due to an increase in the number of stations
 and projects developed within the Agency and the fact
 that with improved training and enlargement of the Audit
 Staff the audit was extended into a more comprehensive
 type than it was earlier.   The Audit Staff grew from an
 authorized strength at 1 January 1953 M to an autho-
 rized strength at 31 December 1956 of         ith the
 adoption of the overseas program, rotation of personnel
 between Headquarters and the field became the established

 During the period unvouchered obligations fluctuated
 but vouchered obligations rose steadily.   Unvouchered
 For each fiscal year a larger proportion of obli-
 gations was unvouchered than of expenditures.   The reason
 for this was the practice of making expenditures on a
 vouchered basis where security permitted even though
 obligations were unvouchered.   Obligations would ordi-
 narily be unvouchered for a project which was budgeted
 on unvouchered funds.   Some of the expenditures for this
 project might be vouchered.   The project might use some
 equipment from an inventory in a warehouse which the
 Office of Logistics obtained by using vouchered funds.
 For the Fiscal Year 1953, 74 percent of obligations but
 only 60 percent of expenditures were unvouchered.l/
 1/
 The differences were less for the other fiscal years
 in the period but were present in each case.   For
 the period as a whole  72 percent of obligations and
 67 percent of expenditures were unvouchered.

 The classification of unvouchered obligations by
 object class for Fiscal Years 1953-1957 show fluctu-
 ations and some trends.   The largest single item for
 every fiscal year was the item, "other contractual
 services," which went up and down during the period.
 object class included obligations for operational services
 rendered by international organizations, foreign contract
 agents, informants, private firms, and other govern-
 mental agencies.   The amount of the item fluctuated
 with the fortunes of special projects and with releases
 from the contingency fund.   It was high for Fiscal Year
 1955 because of a number of costly emergency projects
 started that year.   Obligations for personal services
 were the next largest item and these ranged fror
 million dollars for Fiscal Year 1954 to
 25X1A
 25X1A
 dollars for Fiscal Year 1956.  Vouchered obligations for
 personal services increased at about the same rate during
 the period.   Unvouchered obligations for supplies dropped
 from              dollars for Fiscal Year 1953 to less than
 dollars for Fiscal Years 1955 and 1956.
