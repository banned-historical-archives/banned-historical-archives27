as of 14 April 1986 
was used in this report. 
China in Hong Kon. 
Building for 1997 
We believe the Chinese are steadily expanding their influence in Hong 
Kong and that their authority will grow as they begin to assert themselves 
over the next few years. We judge that the Chinese will continue to be gen-
erally successful over the near term in reassuring local and international 
business firms that their interests will be protected. 
Beijing has shown itself more adept so far at managing 
had expected and is becoming more knowledgeable 
the transition than 
about the territory. 
As a result, US companies?which have $4-5 billion invested there?will 
continue to see Hong Kong as an attractive place to do business. In fact, 
Hong Kong will probably become increasingly important to US firms over 
the next few years, both as a market?especially for US agricultural 
products?and as a center for facilitating US trade and investment in 
China. Bilateral trade in 1985 reached $12 billion. Hong Kong, moreover, 
probably will remain available as a port of call for the US Navy at least 
until 1997, when the British formally relinquish control. 
In our view, Hong Kong's growing importance to China's modernization 
program?both as a trading partner and as a source of investment 
capital?offers local interest groups their greatest leverage over the longer 
run for influencing Chinese policy toward the territory. China's ability to 
sustain the confidence of the local professional and business classes?
essential to Hong Kong's continued prosperity?will become increasingly 
critical by the early to middle 1990s. Many Hong Kong businessmen, who 
make their investment decisions on a five-year basis, will then be reassess-
ing whether to reinvest or to transfer their assets elsewhere. 
Several factors, in our judgment, will influence business confidence as 
Hong Kong moves toward the transition. Most important will be whether 
Beijing remains eager to attract foreign capital for its modernization 
program. If it does, then the Chinese will probably be highly sensitive to in-
ternational business concerns over the stability of Hong Kong. This 
sensitivity probably will be reflected in Beijing's handling of several 
matters that will directly affect Hong Kong over the next few years. Key 
benchmarks will include: 
? 1987?when London has promised to consult Beijing before introducing 
any further democratic reforms, giving the Chinese potential veto power.

China in Hong Kong: 
Building for 1997 
Cooperation, Lingering Suspicions 
The British and Chinese have worked reasonably well 
together in implementing the Hong Kong accord, 
which they signed in December 1984. They have 
established a joint Land Commission to regulate and 
disburse revenue from leasing arrangements. The 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group?established as part 
of the 1984 Joint Declaration to exchange information 
and negotiate issues left ambiguous by the accord?
recently agreed that Hong Kong could gain indepen-
dent status in the General Agreement of Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and is working out a basis for Hong 
Kong to retain its separate membership in other 
international organizations such as the Asian Devel-
opment Bank. The British have appointed the Bank of 
China in Hong Kong as one of the three institutional 
representatives on the semiofficial banking advisory 
committee?hoping to "educate" China more on the 
Hong Kong economy. 
Determined to protect and expand their influence in 
Hong Kong, however, the Chinese reacted very sharp-
ly to British efforts last year to promote democratic 
reforms in the territory.' Beijing made it abundantly 
clear that it would not be bound by such reforms. 
Hong Kong New China News Agency (NCNA) Dep-
uty Director Li Chuwen, for example, told a US 
Consulate official in March 1985 that China "would 
not consider itself bound by extensive modification of 
Hong Kong's political system between now and 
1997." Finally, in November 1985, NCNA Director 
Xu Jiatun, Beijing's chief representative in Hong 
'In September 1985 the British introduced an indirect election to 
the Legislative Council (Legco), a 56-member body responsible for 
enacting ordinances that must receive the governor's assent before 
becoming law. Half of the 24 elected seats represent electoral 
colleges based on geographic divisions, and the other half represent 
constituencies such as labor, education, law, commerce, and indus-
try. The rest of the Council consists of 10 ex officio members, who 
are the colony's senior cabinet, and 22 others appointed by the 
governor. British authorities are considering introducing a direct 
election, changing the role of the governor, and expanding Legco's 
powers, which the Chinese fear would turn Legco into a trouble-
some power base for local interests. 
1 
Kong, publicly accused the British of "deviating" 
from the 1984 Joint Declaration by pursuing these 
reforms without consulting the Chinese. 
We believe Xu's outburst reflects lingering Chinese 
suspicions of British intentions. Judging from their 
reactions throughout the negotiations, the Chinese 
appear to believe that the reforms are an attempt to 
perpetuate British influence after 1997; to preempt 
the role of the Basic Law Drafting Committee 
(BLDC), set up to spell out the basis of the promised 
autonomy for Hong Kong; and ultimately to limit 
Beijing's ability to exercise control over Hong Kong. 
Although the Thatcher government continues to favor 
democratic reform in Hong Kong to protect the 
autonomy promised by Beijing, Hong Kong Govern-
ment political adviser John Boyd recently acknowl-
edged that the British have been discouraged by local 
apathy and strong Chinese objections. In our opinion, 
the British also realize they have little leverage, and 
they do not want to antagonize Beijing. Not only 
would such strains adversely affect stability in Hong 
Kong, but they also would affect Britain's growing 
economic relations with China. 
As a result, we believe the British are resigned to a 
gradual erosion of their authority. In a January press 
conference in Beijing, Foreign Office Minister 
Timothy Renton acknowledged that London plans to 
push the reforms more slowly and to consult more 
with Beijing?thus giving Beijing a potential veto over 
further reforms. Only if the Chinese directly 
challenged British authority in Hong Kong?an event 
we believe highly unlikely?would we expect London 
to make a strong diplomatic protest. Such an action 
would be taken to reassure Parliament and to remind 
both Beijing and local residents that Britain retains 
responsibility for government until 1997.

Key Agreements of the 1984 Joint Declaration 
The policies set out in the Joint Declaration and in 
the annexes will be included in a Basic Law that will 
be maintained for 50 years after 1 July 1997. Under 
the agreement: 
? Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as 
a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the 
People's Republic of China, except in foreign and 
defense affairs, which are the responsibilities of the 
Central People's Government. Socialist policies ap-
plied in the mainland will not be applied to the 
SAR. 
? The people of Hong Kong will continue to enjoy 
their existing rights and freedoms under Hong 
Kong law. The international covenant on civil and 
political rights and the international covenant on 
economic, social, and cultural rights will continue 
to be applied to Hong Kong. Private property, 
ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheri-
tance, and foreign investment will be protected by 
law. 
? The legislature of the SAR will make laws for 
Hong Kong. The legislature will be elected (how 
they will be elected is not specified), and the 
executive will be accountable to the legislature and 
to the courts. 
? The government of the SAR will be composed of 
local inhabitants. Beijing will appoint the chief 
executive on the basis of an election or after 
consultations with local authorities. Beijing will 
also appoint principal officials on the recommenda-
tion of the chief executive of the SAR. 
? Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems, including 
the common law, will be maintained. A court of 
final appeal will be established. The maintenance of 
public order will be the responsibility of the govern-
ment of the SAR. 
? The SAR will be able to negotiate agreements and 
participate in international organizations in appro-
priate fields. The SAR will have autonomy in 
economic, financial, and monetary fields. There 
will be no exchange control, and the Hong Kong 
dollar will continue to be freely convertible. Inves-
tors will be able to deposit or withdraw their capital 
freely. The SAR will retain the status of a free port 
and a separate customs territory. 
? The SAR will have independent finances. The Cen-
tral People's Government will not levy taxes on the 
SAR. 
? Existing land rights will be recognized. The Hong 
Kong Government will be able to grant new leases 
extending until the year 2047. 
? The right of free entry into and exit from Hong 
Kong will be guaranteed. The agreement sets out 
the criteria for the right of abode in Hong Kong and 
the issuance and use of passports and other travel 
documents.

OAK; 
...OF COURSE. YOU CANNOT SPEAK 
FOR THE PEOPLE OF HONGKONG! 
Figure 1. During the negotiations between the United Kingdom 
and China on the future of the territory, both sides claimed to 
"represent" the "people of Hong Kong." In a July 1983 press 
conference, Governor Youde stated, "I am the governor of Hong 
Kong . . . Indeed, I represent the people of Hong Kong." The 
Chinese, in turn, argued that "Mr. Youde . . . take(s) part in the 
talks as a member of the British Government delegation. Therefore 
he can only represent the British Government." The Chinese viewed 
the Hong Kong people as their compatriots?part of the same 
family, whose interests were a domestic issue and of no concern to 
Britain. (From the 21 July 1983 Far Eastern Economic Review) 
China's Expanding Influence 
While keeping a close eye on British actions, Beijing 
is sending in more cadres to penetrate the Hong Kong 
Government (especially the Royal Hong Kong Police 
and Immigration Department), evaluate Hong Kong 
personalities, companies, and organizations dealing 
with China, carry out legitimate business activities,  
and expand "united front"2 work. 
United front work is the winning over, or at least neutralizing, of 
all non-Communists to enable the Communist party to devote its 
energies to consolidating its position and eventually dominating all 
sectors of government and community.

Figure 2. In Hong Kong's first indirect election to the Legislative 
Council held last September, fewer than 0.5 percent of the 
territory's 5.5 million people elected 42 percent of the reformed 
Council. Beijing raised objections to the British-initiated demo-
cratic reforms despite their limitations. (From the 10 October 1985 
Far Eastern Economic Review) 
To manage this increasing number of cadres, in 1985 
Beijing reorganized the NCNA, its principal unoffi-
cial representative in Hong Kong, along the lines of 
government departments, giving it the appearance of 
a shadow government and an alternative to British 
authorities. Under the leadership of Xu Jiatun and 
four vice directors, NCNA Hong Kong now consists 
of the departments of propaganda, foreign affairs, 
administration, economic affairs, research, culture 
and education, personnel, art and sports, coordination, 
and social affairs, as well as the original news agency. 
NCNA Hong Kong now has some 3,000 cadres, 
including a significant number of senior political 
officials. 
NCNA has already begun to press the Hong Kong 
Government to decrease the activities of the Special 
Branch of the Hong Kong police,

The New China News Agency in Hong Kong 
The New China News Agency (NCNA) has a history 
of conducting surrogate political operations abroad 
for China as well as those normally associated with a 
news agency. Some of these have been of a diplomatic 
nature; in the case of Hong Kong, NCNA has served 
as Beijin s semiofficial representative there since the 
1950s. 
From time to time, Beijing has sought permission 
from the Hong Kong Government to establish an 
official representative's office in the territory, but the 
British have consistently rejected such requests be-
cause of concern that official Beijing representation 
could be destabilizing and would not be in the best 
interest of Hong Kong. 
Consequently, routine matters between Hong Kong 
and China have been handled mostly through special 
channels. For example, postal matters have been 
handled by the Hong Kong Post Office with 
Guangzhou postal authorities, and questions relating

officers) and the upgrading of the top position in the 
Special Branch in March 1986, we believe the British 
are strongly resisting such pressures. 
the NCNA also is 
trying to woo and co-opt influential individuals in the 
territory with hints of positions in a post-1997 Hong 
Kong Government and of lucrative trade deals. Senior 
NCNA officials handpicked 23 Hong Kong represen-
tatives for the 59-member BLDC,3 who Beijing un-
doubtedly hopes will cooperate closely with the Chi-
nese in putting together the Basic Law. Hong Kong 
shipping magnate Sir Yue-kong Pao, who serves as a 
vice chairman on the BLDC, has already proved very 
cooperative by putting forward as his own an NCNA-
drafted proposal for the composition of the Basic Law 
Consultative Committee (BLCC). 
Pao probably expects preferential 
treatment in carrying out economic ventures in China 
in exchange for his cooperation. 
The Chinese also are increasingly using the leftist 
press (Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, New Evening Post, 
Tin Tin Yat Po, Ching Pao [The Mirror]) to shape 
public opinion, while trying to intimidate and co-opt 
the independent media in Hong Kong. During Decem 
ber 1985 the pro-Beijing monthly magazine, The 
Mirror, for example, published a fairly detailed 
"blueprint" of the future political system in Hong 
Kong, which we judge was intended to influence the 
debate in the territory over political reforms. In 
The 1984 Joint Declaration states that the National People's 
Congress shall enact and promulgate a Basic Law, but it does not 
specify how the Congress should approach this task. In turn, the 
Chinese National People's Congress appointed both mainland and 
Hong Kong individuals to work on the BLDC, which has the job of 
drafting the constitution under which the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) will be governed after the 1997 
Chinese takeover. In addition, Beijing has established a Basic Law 
Consultative Committee (BLCC), an advisory group charged with 
collecting public opinion in Hong Kong on the Basic Law. It is 
made up entirely of local people. The BLCC will present its 
findings to the BLDC after working in subcommittees of 20 to 30 
people. The subcommittees will focus on issues such as the rights 
and obligations of Hong Kong SAR citizens, external affairs, 
finances and economy, and the structure of the Basic Law. These  
efforts contain little real substance, however. 
 the Hong Kong mem-
bers of the BLDC were included to make it appear that the 
committee was representative of the Hong Kong people, but Beijing 
will not allow the  Hong Kong members to have a significant role.

Secret 
China's Blueprint for Hong Kong's 
Future Government 
An article in The Mirror proposes a strong executive 
government, dominated by the business class and 
retaining many of the "advisory" features of Hong 
Kong's present system. The proposal appears de-
signed to cater to Hong Kong's entrepreneurial and 
professional elite and to reassure them about Bei-
jing's intentions for the colony. The blueprint, for 
example, calls for the creation of a supreme, 100-
member executive advisory assembly composed 
"mainly of capitalists." It would select the chief 
executive, be consulted on policy formation, and have 
a say in deciding who would fill up to 30 percent of 
the seats in the Legislative Council. The Hong Kong?
based members of the Basic Law Drafting Commit-
tee, whose membership includes the head of the local 
NCNA office, would select this executive assembly. 
The executive advisory assembly would select the 
chief executive through election or democratic con-
sultations. Then Beijing would approve the assemb-
ly's selection for the chief executive, who could serve 
a maximum of two eight-year terms. The duties of 
the chief executive would include formulating policy 
in conjunction with the assembly and the Executive 
Council, commanding the local police force, and?
under urgent conditions with the approval of 
Beijing?commanding troops stationed in Hong 
Kong. 
The blueprint proposes that the ultimate number of 
Legislative Council members be about 60, with 40 
percent of the seats filled by direct election, 30 
percent from functional constituencies, and 30 percent 
by professionals "at the invitation of the assembly." 
The Legislative Council would be under the authority 
of the chief executive, who would have the power to 
dissolve it with the concurrence of a majority of the 
executive advisory assembly. The chief executive 
would be required to consult the Legislative Council 
on matters of importance, and to explain policy, but 
would not be accountable in any other way to the 
Council. 
Secret 
is systematically cultivating local newspaper editors 
and reporters by offering them home mortgage loans 
through Chinese banks in Hong Kong. The net result, 
according to one journalist, is that heavy self-censor-
ship within the media is already the order of the day. 
Tempering Factors 
Beijing's actions in Hong Kong continue to be tem-
pered by its interest in cultivating local and interna-
tional business interests, including US companies. In 
our judgment, China wishes to ensure that its actions 
do not stampede nervous investors into moving the 
bulk of their assets elsewhere. Beijing also appreciates 
Hong Kong's role in its modernization program?as a 
source of investment and management skills, as a port 
for entrepot trade and technology transfer, and as a 
provider of training in basic business methods. 
Beijing also continues to believe, in our view, that a 
peaceful transition in Hong Kong will increase inter-
national pressure on Taipei to open a dialogue with 
the mainland on the reunification issue. Chinese 
officials have indicated that the "one country, two 
systems" rubric, under which Beijing pledges to allow 
Hong Kong to retain its capitalist system and to enjoy 
a measure of political autonomy, was created with 
Taiwan in mind. Since the signing of the Sino-UK 
accord on Hong Kong's future, Beijing has increasing-
ly pressed the United States for an endorsement of 
Deng Xiaoping's "one country, two systems" formula 
as a model for the reunification of Taiwan. 
These concerns have not kept the Chinese from 
occasionally blundering and being heavyhanded, most 
notably in the instance of Xu Jiatun's blunt criticism 
of the British. On balance, however, they have sought 
to conciliate and calm public fears. For example, 
Beijing quickly sent Ji Pengfei in December 1985 to 
soothe local concerns about Chinese intentions after 
Xu's remarks. According to the US Consulate in 
Hong Kong, Lu Ping's monthlong visit in January?in

which the Chinese took the step of consulting Hong 
Kong public opinion widely and visibly?also  eased 
concerns created by Xu Jiatun's intervention. 
Growing Interdependence 
While China continues to increase its political power 
in Hong Kong, the growing interdependence of the 
two economies may well be a greater source of 
Beijing's influence. Beijing, for example, is making 
selected, well-publicized investments in Hong Kong's 
banking sector to bolster business confidence. In June 
1985, after the collapse of the Overseas Trust Bank 
shook public confidence in other small and medium-
sized Hong Kong banks, China Merchants Steam 
Navigation Company?one of Beijing's three big 
commercial operations in Hong Kong?bought a 
25-percent share of the Far East Bank when that 
bank faced liquidity problems. For the first time since 
the signing of the accord with the United Kingdom, a 
Chinese organization (China International Trust and 
Investment Corporation [CITICD agreed in principle 
to directly take over a financially troubled Hong Kong 
bank (Ka Wah) in January 1986 . Although CITIC 
received most of the favorable publicity for the 
bailout, it was probably the Hong Kong Government's 
promise to guarantee Ka Wah's doubtful loans that 
clinched the deal. 
Beijing is increasing its economic ties to the territory 
in areas other than banking. The US Consulate in 
Hong Kong reports that China has purchased interest 
in one Hong Kong securities brokerage firm (Chung 
Mao) and is rumored to have bought another. Chinese 
enterprises and organizations have been especially 
active in Hong Kong's property market. In the past 
two years, Chinese enterprises have either purchased 
or committed themselves to invest in more than $800 
million worth of property. China has also made forays 
into leasing, residential property development, insur-
ance, transportation, and hotel development. To en-
courage investment in Hong Kong, the Bank of China 
has also offered loans for new capital investment at 
better than market terms. The US Consulate in Hong 
Kong does not know how often such loans have been 
made, but suspects that it is relatively infrequently. 
7 
Secret 
In turn, Hong Kong continues to be Beijing's most 
important "outside" source of investment capital, 
with nearly $8 billion in pledged investment over the 25X1 
past five years. Hong Kong accounts for approximate-
ly 60 percent of all investment in China and 70 per-
cent of all joint venture projects there. The US 
Consulate in Hong Kong reports that many Hong 
Kong businessmen see investing in their ancestral 
towns on the mainland as a way of contributing to 
China's modernization campaign and building politi-
cal equity with Beijing. They are also more willing to 
take risks than most foreign investors, according to 
the US Consulate in Hong Kong. 25X1 
China's rising trade with Hong Kong also underscores 
the growing interdependence between Hong Kong and 
the mainland. China's international trade?much of it 
carried out through Hong Kong?has jumped since 
Beijing first began to push its open-door economic 
policies. Last year China replaced the United States 
as Hong Kong's major trading partner. Hong Kong's 
total trade with China (including domestic exports, 
reexports, and imports) in 1985 was $15.4 billion?a 
27-percent increase from 1984's $12.2 billion total. 
Because of Hong Kong's role in facilitating China's 
trade ties to the rest of the world, its share of Chinese 
trade has grown, and Hong Kong now accounts for 
over one-quarter of all China's trade. Reexports, 
which make up three-quarters of all of Hong Kong's 
exports to China, jumped from $900 million in 1980 
to about $6 billion in 1985. Moreover, Hong Kong's 
role in entrepot trade provides a convenient fig leaf for 
indirect trade with countries such as South Korea, 
Indonesia, and even Taiwan, which do not have 
diplomatic relations with Beijing. 
Local Reaction 
The public reaction to the clash between the Chinese 
and British over reforms has been muted mainly 
because, in our opinion, most residents are fatalistic 
about Beijing's future rule. Moreover, many Hong 
Kong businessmen approve of Chinese efforts to block

the introduction of representative institutions. A lead-
ing Hong Kong businessman, Lord Lawrence 
Kadoorie, may have expressed the attitude of his 
fellows when he asserted that Hong Kong could best 
survive under a "benevolent oligarchy," ruled prefera-
bly by those who made the territory rich rather than 
by the shifting sands of public sentiment. 
At the same time, most Hong Kong businessmen 
continue to hedge their bets by investing some of their 
profits abroad. The extent of capital flow from Hong 
Kong is difficult to determine. Because many Hong 
Kong businessmen base their decisions on a five-year 
turnover period, however, they have plenty of time to 
transfer their assets if necessary. A recent hint of 
business concern was reflected in the always volatile 
Hong Kong stock market when Xu Jiatun's public 
criticism of the British caused the index to shed nearly 
50 points in one day. The market quickly bounced 
back to record highs?until late January, when 
rumors of Deng Xiaoping's deteriorating health 
caused the index to fall 30 points. Realizing the 
sensitivity of the territory's stock market to any 
reports indicating eventual changes in the political 
situation, the Chinese Foreign Ministry? uickl 
denied the rumors as "pure invention." 
A few gadflies in the Executive and Legislative 
Councils continue to criticize Beijing's occasional 
heavyhandedness. Executive and Legislative Council-
lor Allen Lee, for example, charged Chinese officials 
with "misleading" Hong Kong's people into thinking 
they will be entrusted with the power to run the 
territory. Elected Legco representative and BLDC 
member Martin Lee also criticized Xu Jiatun's re-
marks on British "deviations" from the accord as 
"unacceptable intervention." Lacking popular sup-
port, these critics, in our jud ment will be only a 
minor irritation to Beijing. 
Although the press has in general treated China 
gingerly, a few newspapers continue to snipe at 
Beijing. The Hong Kong Standard?which in May

1985 transferred ownership to a publicly listed com-
pany in Australia, probably for political reasons?and 
the consistently pro-British South China Morning 
Post continue to criticize Chinese actions in their 
editorials, although to little effect. 
Toward the Inevitable 
In our judgment, real power in the colony is beginning 
to shift gradually from the United Kingdom to China. 
This process is likely to accelerate over the next 
several years. As the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group 
and BLDC become more active over the next year, 
the influence of China's local representatives is 
certain to increase as well. 
The British reform program, in the meantime, may 
languish and die. There is little popular support for it, 
and if Beijing can speed up the work of the BLDC the 
reforms may become moot. 
British officials who assisted in the negotiations admit 
that their gloomy forecasts have not come to pass and 
that Beijing has become more knowledgeable about 
the territory. They clearly retain a "so far, so good" 
attitude, however, stressing?correctly in our judg-
ment?that the real test of China's ability to manage 
the transition will not come until the early 1990s, 
when businessmen must decide on their future invest-
ment strategies. Hong Kong's continued economic 
health depends, of course, on many factors outside 
the China?Hong Kong relationship, but certainly 
Beijing's ability to sustain business confidence is a 
key factor. 
Local and international business reaction to certain 
events and time periods will be crucial to a smooth 
transition. In 1987, for example, the Hong Kong 
Government will conduct a review of the current 
democratic reforms. As promised, the British will 
consult with Beijing before publishing their findings, 
and we expect little further progress on the reforms. A 
year later, on 1 July 1988, the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group will move its base of operations to 
Hong Kong, where it will be in a better position to 
directly influence territorial policies. In 1990, the 
9 
Secret 
target date for completion of the Basic Law on Hong 
Kong, Beijing may encourage the Hong Kong Gov-
ernment to put aspects of the Basic Law into practice 
before reversion of sovereignty. By 1992, business 
confidence becomes crucial to the territory's economic 25X1 
performance; businesses in Hong Kong traditionally 
have been able to recover their investments in five 
years. Decisions will undoubtedly be strongly influ-
enced by the success or failure of economic reforms in 
mainland China. 25X1 
Implications for the United States 
Primarily economic concerns spur US interest in a 
successful transition for Hong Kong. The United 
States is a leading foreign investor in Hong Kong, 
with total US investment there in the $4-5 billion 
range. Besides accounting for just over half of all 
direct foreign investment in Hong Kong's manufac-
turing sector, US firms are very active in Hong 
Kong's service sector?including about 30 US banks 
and numerous brokerage houses and insurance agen-
cies. There are now more than 600 US-registered 
firms and 13,000 Americans resident in Hong Kong. 
Total trade between the United States and Hong 
Kong is substantial, reaching approximately $12 bil-
lion last year. The United States purchased $3.3 
billion of domestic Hong Kong goods in the first half 
of 1985, with garments, electrical machinery, office 
machines, computers, toys, and plastics making up the 
majority of US imports. 
Conversely, Hong Kong?despite its size?ranks 
among the top 20 US export markets. The United 
States supplied 10 percent of Hong Kong's imports in 
the first half of 1985 (about $1.5 billion) and is the 
territory's largest source of computer products and 
scientific instruments. Hong Kong is also one of the 
fastest growing markets for US agricultural products. 
On average, every person in Hong Kong spent about 
$66 on US farm products in 1984.

Secret 
Hong Kong, moreover, serves as an important center 
for facilitating US trade and investment in China. 
Roughly one-third of all China-bound US goods pass 
through Hong Kong, and many US businesses base 
their China operations there. The territory also serves 
as an important communications link and surveying 
post on China, as well as a port for the US Navy. 
Finally, as the world's third-largest financial center, 
Hong Kong contributes to the economic growth of 
Southeast Asia, in which the United States has a 
strong stake. 
Because the Sino-British agreement declared that 
Hong Kong is to remain economically autonomous 
after 1997, we anticipate that, unless Beijing begins to 
interfere more directly, US trade with Hong Kong 
will be relatively unaffected. As 1997 approaches, 
some trade and investment firms will probably opt to 
leave Hong Kong, but as long as the large volume 
businesses remain confident, business turnover should 
not seriously dampen the trade and financial environ-
ment. Hong Kong will almost certainly remain the 
most advantageous place for US firms to do business 
with China. 
US warships frequently visit Hong Kong and contrib-
ute to the territory's economy. A nascent antinuclear 
movement poses little immediate threat to US ship 
visits, since we doubt that British authorities would 
react to weak popular pressure on the nuclear issue. 
However, if a serious harbor accident involving a 
nuclear warship triggered large-scale popular objec-
tions, the British would be forced to reassess their 
policy. Once China assumes sovereignty, Hong Kong's 
ship-visit policy will be consistent with the mainland's.
