THE WASHINGTON STAR 
Betty Beale 
The air was charged with electricity in that de' 
bate between the New York Times' Seymour Hersh 
and former CIA .official Jack Maury at the AIM 
conference last weekend. In case you're not up on 
such things, AIM stands for Accuracy In Media, a 
group that drew 300 to the banquet that wound up 
two days of panel discus'sions out at 4-H headquar-
ters on Connecticut Avenue. 
Three Washingtonians won AIM awards at the 
banquet ? Ben Wattenburg for .his television 
series, "In Search of the Real America"; Frank 
Scott, WRC's vice president and general manager, 
,Yor the Pat Buchanan-Torn Braden show; and Vic-
? tor Lasky for his book, "It Didn't Start with Water-
gate." ? ? ' 
With former career diplomat Elbridge Durbrow 
moderating, Maury produced a list of New York 
Times-printed allegations over the years that he 
said were totally untrue, i.e., that the CIA was in-
volved in Watergate; that the CIA was involved in 
drug smuggling; that the CIA was not controlled 
by either the White.House or the Congress. ' 
Not only were those stories false, said Maury, 
but in every significant controversy the CIA was 
carrying out the, orders of the president, as was 
.discovered by the investigations of the Church 
?and Pike committees and the Rockefeller Commis-
sion. Also untrue, he said, was the NYT story that 
claimed a CIA agent was killed-in combat in Laos 
? which could have violated the Geneva Accords. 
What happened, said the former intelligence offi-
cer, was that the reporter saw the last name on a 
death certificate of .a 5-year-old baby and decided 
it referred to an agent by that name: ? 
Hersh said he was more concerned about the 
domestic operations. He wondered what Richard 
Ileums thought was going on June.23, 1972, when 
H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman called him 
to the White House, he said, and asked him to stop 
the FBI Investigation. He seemed to- think Helms 
should have leaked such information arid also 
0100040001-2 
what James McCord was telling him in the letters 
he was writing to him. ? 
Jack Maury took delight in quoting from a letter 
he wrote over a year ago to Seymour's boss, 
"Punch" Sulzberger, in which he listed inaccura-
cies and distortions and asked Sulzberger to let him 
know if any were incorrect or unfair. Sulzberger 
wrote back, "As a matter of policy I do not preread 
articles that comment on the New York Times: I 
feel that is up to the author." Whatever that means. 
, But all that was mild compared to what Uwe 
Siemon-Netto, German correspondent for Die Ziet, 
said as the main banquet speaker. As a correspond-
ent for a German news service from 1964 to 1969 in 
Vietnam, he blamed the American media as well as 
some European correspondents for so distorting 
the war that people on both sides of the Atlantic . 
thought the United States was the aggressor and 
the North Vietnamese, the liberal democrats. He 
told how the Viet Co ng mutilated civilians and 
strung them, up. But the. press overlooked such 
'things. =' '? ? In fact fact said Siemon&tto, this was the first war 
ever lost primarily because the media undermined 
the war effort On our side and was favorable to the 
Communist side.. When AIM takes aim, no holds 
are barred. . .S.-

I think it waS an outcry that 
was justified. For the news media 
to remain credible they must take 
pains to insure that they aren't 
infiltrated by any outside organ-
ization.

Reed Irvine, chairman of AIM, 
takes up the sticky issue in a sup-
. plement to the current AIM Re-
. port. He wrote that AIM had spon-
sored a luncheon in February 
!where John M. Maury, a retired 
CIA official and a former assist-
ant secretary of defense, talked on 
e the issue of the Soviet KGB infil-
trating and exploiting the. Ameri-
can news media.  . 
Mr. Maury was with the CIA for 
27 years. This past December he 
testified before a House subcom-
mittee and at that time informed 
the congressmen of the Soviet 
Union's use of the press in this 
- country. He testified that a Soviet 
intelligence manual, "The Prac-
tice of Recruiting Americans in 
_the, USA and Third_ _Countries" 
placed members of the press sec-
ond in a list of priority recruit-
ment targets. 
"At the luncheon, Mr. Maury 
said in response to a question that 
the CIA files contained informa-
tiorelattIrspecific journalists who 
had KGB ties," Mr. Irvine wrote. 
"However, Mr. Maury declined to 
name any names. He was not in-
clined to favor a congressional 
investigation in this area, but if 
congressional committees think it 
is necessary and desirable to 
investigate CIA- use of journalists, 
why would they not be even more 
interested in probing the activities 
of the KGB and other foreign 
intelligence services in this impor-
tant area?" 
ase 2004/11/01: CIA-R0P88-01315R0001 
It's a good question. And it de-
serves an answer. If were 'going. 
to get so wrought up over CIA ex-
- ploitation of the press, why don't 
we get at least a twinge of irrita-
tion over KGB exploitation? But 
? Congress doesn't appear inter-
ested. Maybe it's because Sen. 
Frank Church isn't seeking a 
presidential nomination this year. 
'And the orgenizations V which 
squeak with alarm over exploita-
tion of the press in any form have-
n't discernibly lifted so .much as 
? azz eyebrow... 
, In an earlier issue Of AIM Re-
_tort this auestion 
"Entirely missing from this dis-
-cussion, as far as we have been 
able to see, is any exposure by the 
media of the use of journalists and 
journalistic covers by foreign 
intelligence Services, particularly 
those hostile to the United States 
such as the Soviet KGB and the 
Cuban DGI. One would think from 
discussions in our press that the 
infiltration of our news media by 
our, own intelligence agencies 
posed a critical danger _to our. 
?freedoms. : 
"At the same time the penetra-
tion of our media by the KGB and 
its allied intelligence services IS 
evidently viewed as no problem at 
all. It is not clear whether this is 
because the media here think that 
such penetration is impossible or 
whether they accept' it as possible 
but think that it poses no danger." - 
For my part I believe the press 
and the electronic types should 
make every effort to eliminate ex-
ploitation by the CIA, the KGB, 
the DGI and any other outside 
group. - - 
But it doesn't make any sense to 
literally and. figuratively make a 
federal case out of CIA penetra-
tion and treat KGB and DGI pene. 
tration in the manner of an over.

LETTERS TO THE 
DITOR 
A Reply From Accuracy in Media, Inc. 
We regret that The Washington Post 
has used an F.Y.I. editorial [Jan, 121 to 
mislead its readers about our criticism 
of an article by Lionel Martin about 
Cuba. Let's set the record straight. 
Our Dec. 5 letter to the editor was a 
short one, just nine sentences long. Six 
of those sentences were devoted to a 
discussion of Mr. Martin's article. One 
of them noted that he had been an ad-
viser to Castro's government and a cor-
respondent of the left-wing weekly, the 
Guardian. One suggested that it would 
be helpful to the readers if they knew 
that, and the last one asked if The Post 
would tell them this information. 
The Post described this letter as an 
ad hominem attack on Mr. ,Martin that 
"impugned a news dispatch and its 
author, not by demonstrating any inac-
curacy in the dispatch itself, but by se-
lectively reciting only a part of the 
writer's personal and professional 
background." 
The article in question carried this 
headline: "Will Influx of Capitalist Tour-
? ists Bring Back the Vices of the Old Re-
gime?" Our criticism could be summed 
up in this sentence from our Dec. 5 let-
ter: "The article carried the suggestion 
that such vices as prostitution and gam-
bling were the inevitable fruits of the 
free-enterprise system and that Castro's 
? Communist system had established a 
new higher morality in Cuba.'.' 
? In a letter to me dated Dec. 13, Philip 
Geyelin, editor of the editorial page of 
The Post, essentially confirmed that 
this was what Mr. Martin was saying. 
Mr. Geyelin wrote: "He was merely say-
ing that the Castro regime had pretty 
'well stamped out not just prostitution 
and gambling but the operations of the 
mob and organized vice in general; and 
that he was afraid that the return of 
tourism to Cuba would mean a return 
to the bad old days of the Batista dicta-
torship." - 
As we pointed out in our paid ad in 
The Post on Jan. 6, those "bad old days" 
were the days when Cuba was capitalist 
and the Cuban people enjoyed freedom 
of speech, press, religion, association, 
the right to travel abroad, etc. 
We suggested in our original letter 
that it might be appropriate to specu-
late about whether the return of tour-
ism to Cuba would "result in a relaxa-
tion of the draconian,- oppressive laws 
and punishment with little regard for 
due process that has characterized 
Castro's totalitarian system." Instead, 
Mr. Martin chose to focus on the dan-
ger that it might bring back prostitu-
tion, gambling and tipping. 
, Some people might think that this re-
flects an unusual sense of values, espe-
cially in a writer for a newspaper that 
places such high store by human free-
dom and which has not been known to 
get unduly upset by the prostitution, 
gambling and tipping that can be ob-
served within a few blocks of its Wash-
ington headquarters. It was for that 
reason that we suggested that the read-
ers of The Post might be interested in 
the background of Mr. Martin so that 
they could better understand the per-
spective from which he writes. 
The Post is not, of course, indifferent 
to connections that iournalists have 
' luence their writin . It 
pas viewed with great disfavor . in-
fluence on newspaper correspondents  
?even stringers.  
Cuba is one of Many countries that  
uses journalists routinely for uttelle  
? ence and propaganda purposes. in  
view of some of the comments in The  
Post's F.Y.I. editorial, one might well  
wonder whether The Post would be as  
careful about not hiring_ a correspon-
dent or stringer under the control of a  
. foreign intelligence agency. such .as the  
DGI of Cuba, as it presumably is about  
not hiring anyone connected with the 
CA. 
I say this because you concede. that, 
great pressures may be brought upon! 
your stringers in countries such as. 
Cuba by the government. You perceive i 
no danger in this, since your editors are! 
very skilled at eliminating any storiesi 
that appear to be biased or inaccurate. 
It is left to the reader to wonder how 
a harried editor in Washington can de-
tect the inaccuracies and biases in sto-
ries written in countries that are far 
away and that may be totally unfamil-
iar to him, when he so frequently lets 
pass bias and error in stories that con-
cern matters on his own doorstep. 
You say to your readers: Trust us to 
protect you from biased and inaccurate 
stories. But you are showing by your ac-
tions in declining to print letters that 
point out cases of bias and error that 
you are not anxious to have the readers 
know that the trust you seek cannot al-
ways be said to be deserved.

ITEWASH-. FR MIHE WASHINGTON PO 
On February 17, The Post carried a story 
by Lee Lescaze under the headline, "tetc-
hier Briefcase Opened to the Press." Mr. 
Lescaze said in his story that the associates 
of the late Orlando Letelier had "decided 
to make the briefcase public" because 
"leaks" had damaged Letelier's reputation. 
We have been informed by the office of 
the attorney, who "opened" the briefcase 
that no press -conference -was called and 
that, as-,a matter of fact, only The Wash-

on the documents. It is 'difficult to justify

tt3B Activities, 
By REED J. IRVINE 
Last October, Accuracy in Media 
took the news media to task for failing 
to investigate and report on charges made 
by Sen. Barry Goldwater (R.-Ariz.) 
that the Soviet KGB had infiltrated the 
staffs of U.S. senators. Sen. Goldwater 
stated on a Washington TV program that 
this information had been given to him 
by Vice President Rockefeller. He said 
that the Vice President had told him that 
the information would be included in his. 
report on intelligence activities. Gold--' 
water said that the Rockefeller Report 
failed to make any mention of these 
charges, and that the Vice President had 
explained to him that he had been asked 
to leave them out. 
In one or our columns, we said that it 
was shocking that the news media should 
so completely ignore this- story. It in-
volved allegations of a serious threat to 
our national secUrity and of a cover-up 
by the Administration. 
Some 50 members of the House of 
Representatives signed a letter to Sen. 
Frank Church (D.-Iowa) asking that his 
committee on intelligence investigate 
these charges. Sen. Church responded 
by having a couple of aides talk to FBI 
officials about the matter. On Novem-
ber 5, he released a letter he had re-
ceived from FBI Director Clarence 
Kelley, which said that the FBI "has no 
evidence at this time of any infiltration 
of congressional staff." 
The letter did not point out that the 
assistant director of the FBI, W. Ray 
Wannall, had told a seminar on intelli-
gence and internal security sponsored 
by the American Conservative Union a 
few weeks earlier that the .Soviet intel-
ligence services were showing an in-
creased pattern of activity on Capitol 
Hill and elsewhere. He told the seminar 
that the Soviets were trying to develop 
"agents of influence" and that the U.S. 
was their prime target. 
The FBI letter to Sen. Church has ? 
a confidential attachment. Sen. 
Goldwater told MM that this men-
tioned a case of suspected infiltra-
tion of a congressional office some 
time ago. Sen. Church kept this se-
cret. Ile used the FBI letter to 
create the impression that there was 
no reason to he concerned about 
KGB infiltration of Capitol HU 
On March II, the issue exploded 
again, with the discovery that back in 
1967 the KGB actually recruited an 
aide to Sen. Eastland of Mississippi. The

I MIS CHMe in a ficw UJOI1/4 on Lin.z ploy 
Sanford Ungar, Washington editor of 
the Atlantic magazine. Ungar wrote that 
an aide to a senior senator had "passed 
information to the Soviet Union for 
years without being detected...." He 
was wrong about the length of time. It 
was a matter of months, but the press 
showed interest in the case and revealed 
that the aide in question was Kenneth 
Tolliver. He had been fired by Eastland 
in 196S, at the urging of the FBI. 
Ungar says he is sure that Tolliver's 
activity went undetected for some time, 
because L. Patrick Gray and, later, 
Clarence Kelley, were both shocked to 
learn the details of the ease when they 
took the helm at the FBI. Tolliver says 
that he informed the FBI as soon as the 
KGB approached him and that he be-
came a double agent, working for the 
Bureau. The FBI refuses to comment. 
It is evidently true that Tolliver did 
become a double agent. but there are 
also indications that the FBI did not 
fully trust him even when they were 
using him. Tolliver's version has been 
given a lot of publicity by the media, and 
it is unfortunate that the FBI or the 
Church Committee aren't telling what 
they know of the matter. 
This is important. The case shows that 
Sen. Goldwater was talking about a real 
danger last year. The KGB has a strong 
interest, in aides on Capitol Hill. If it 
could recruit the aide to a senior sena-
tor, who as chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee and Seriate Internal Secur-
ity subcommittee had access to highly 
sensitive information, the danger cannot 
be lightly dismissed. This shows the folly 
of the lack or intesrest in Goldwater's 
charges by both the media and Sen. 
Church last year.

A WATERGATE COVER UP BY THE MEDIA 
Reported as a public service by Accuracy in Media (AIM) 
(Reprinted from the December A.1.M. Report) 
A recently published book reveals that there is evidence 
that officials of the Democratic National Committee and 
gossip columnist Jack Anderson were among those who had 
knowledge of the Watergate bugging many weeks before the 
break-in of June 17, 1972. 
The book is At That Point in Time and the author is Fred 
D. Thompson, Chief Minority Counsel of the Ervin Com-
mittee, the special committee created to investigate the 
Watergate scandal. 
Thompson devotes an entire chapter to the intriguing 
evidence that the victims of the Watergate bugging were 
warned several weeks in advance of what was planned. This 
evidence was developed by the minority staff of the Ervin 
Committee. Sworn testimony was taken in executive 
session from three officials of the Democratic National 
Committee, columnist Jack Anderson, and the two indi-
viduals who gave the warning, A.J. Woolston-Smith, a 
New York private detective, and William F. Haddad, a 
former official in the Kennedy and Johnson Administra-
tions. 
The staff prepared a surnmarY of its findings, but it was 
never included in the final report of the Ervin Committee. 
The majority did not think the findings were sufficiently 
conclusive. We have learned that a copy of the summary fell 
into the hands of a reporter for CBS News, but that news 
organization chose not to divulge the story. 
The transcripts of the secret testimony became available to 
the public, and AIM acquired a set, but the major media 
showed no interest in them and the story they contained. 
We have discussed the story with many people, including a 
number of reporters. The reaction is always one of 
astonishment and interest. But with one or two exceptions 
the reporters have failed to probe the evidence and inform 
the public about it. 
Who Was in the Know? 
We will give you the story in some detail so that you may 
judge its newsworthiness for yourself. 
First, we must point out that those who dug into this 
matter were frustrated by witnesses who contradicted 
themselves and each other, who had incredible lapses of 
memory, who claimed to have kept no records or poor 
records of important matters, and who misplaced important 
documents. But it is precisely the obvious effort to conceal 
md confuse on the part of the witnesses that strengthens 
the conclusion that there was some real fire beneath the 
clouds of smoke that some of the witnesses were blowing. 
If investigative reporters had devoted a fraction of the time 
they spent on other aspects of Watergate to investigating 
how the Democrats and Jack Anderson found out about 
the bugging in advance, it is conceivable that they might 
have uncovered either a double agent, some counter-
bugging, or even an unindicted co-conspirator. 
Here is the story. partly as told by Fred Thompson, but 
-snyiptentensed?isp?sper own analysis of the eaceacret 
testimony. 
A private detective in New York named A.J. Woolston 
Smith apparently became aware of the?Republican plans to 
bug the Democrats as early as December 1971 or January 
1972. He conveyed this information to William F. Haddad, 
publisher of a small New York weekly, the Manhattan 
Tribune, who had previously given Woolston-Smith assign-
ments to detect suspected wiretapping. Haddad had held 
high positions in both the Kennedy and Johnson 
Administrations. Satisfied that Woolston-Smith had reliable 
information, Haddad sent this letter to his friend Lawrence 
O'Brien, then Chairman of the Democratic National Com-
mittee, on March 23, 1972: 
I am hearing some very disturbing stories about GOP 
sophisticated surveillance techniques now being used for 
campaign purposes and of an interesting group here in 
New York where some of this "intelligence" activity is 
centered. The information comes from a counter-wire 
tapper who helped me once in a very difficult situation 
in Michigan and who had come to me highly recom-
mended from two lawyers, Gallagon (sic) and Shapiro. 
Can you have someone call me so you can get the 
info first hand and take whatever actions you deem 
necessary. If you want, I will go a little deeper into the 
situation, but I would prefer that you evaluate the same 
information I have received, and from the same source, 
before taking further steps. 
O'Brien turned the matter over to a member of his staff, 
John Stewart, the DNC's director of communications, 
appending this note to Haddad's letter: "Could you follow 
up on the attached and put in a call to Bill?" 
Stewart had phone conversations with both Haddad and 
Woolston-Smith. A meeting with them was arranged in 
Haddad's New York office on April 26, 1972. It was 
attended by Stewart, Haddad, Woolston-Smith, and Ben 
Winter, the vice president of a New York bank who was a 
friend of Haddad's. Haddad said Winter had nothing to do 
with the matter. He just happened to be in his office, and 
he invited him to sit in on the meeting "to hear something 
fascinating." 
What Was Known 
Woolston-Smith testified that Haddad did most of the 
talking. Haddad testified under oath that the discussion 
included plans of the Republicans to bug the Watergate. 
offices of the DNC, the involvement of Cubans, ways in 
which the funding of the espionage operation might be 
traced, and a Republican organizatio._ in New York called 
the November Group that had some connection with G. 
Gordon Liddy. He also said that the name of former 
Attorney-General John Mitchell had been mentioned. ? 
Woolston-Smith's sworn testimony also indicated that these 
were among the matters discussed, but he did not mention 
John Mitchell's name being brought up. He did, however, 
say that James McCord, who participated in the Watergate 
burglary, had been mentioned at the meeting. Woolston-
Smith claimed that nearly everything discussed by Haddad 
was based on his information except for the Cuban 
involvement. He thought that information could havicome 
from Haddad's friend, Jack Anderson. 
en Winter, the banker, recalled that Woolston-Smith had 
-displayed a "sophisticated bug" at the meeting and had 
handed it to Stewart and Haddad. Winter thought 
Woolston-Smith's information appeared to be hard evidence 
of surveillance, not just a theory. Woolston-Smith himself 
tried very hard to put the investigators off with an 
incredible story that he had presented nothing but a theory. 
He changed his tune when interrogated a second time, but 
the staff never .felt that he had given them a true statement 
about the source of his information. He insisted that he did 
only "defensive wiretapping," i.e., detection of bugging. 
The bug he exhibited at the meeting, he said, was only a 
fake model intended to show the type of equipment 
available in the market. 
Two days after this meeting, Haddad addressed a letter to 
John Stewart, saying that Woolston-Smith had "good 
information" and that it was his judgment "that the story is 
true and explosive" Seeming to answer a question from 
Stewart about whether Woolston-Smith wanted to be paid 
for continuing his investigation, Haddad wrote: "Yes, he 
did want to cover expenses..." Haddad said: "Instead of 
pursuing this with money, I decided to see what a good 
investigative reporting operation could do with it now. So 
went ahead along these lines. If they draw a blank, I'll be 
back to you on how to proceed, and keep you 
informed." 
Haddad testified that he made copies of all the matenal in 
his file and sent it to columnist Jack Anderson with a 
covering letter. Strangely, neither Anderson nor Haddad 
could locate any copies of the material Hadildd sent or of 
the letter. It had all mysteriously vanished. Haddad says he 
sent Anderson his "file," everything he had. Anderson said 
all he received was a one-page letter. 
What Was Done 
Having been warned that there were plans afoot to bug 
their offices, did the Democrats notify the police, have the 
office swept for bugs, hire a night watchman, or even ask 
the staff to take precautions? 
The answer is that they did none of these. Officials have 
given various explanations for the seeming total lack of 
reaction to the warning. Stanley Griegg, then Deputy 
Chairman of the National Committee, said that John 
Stewart had told him that Woolston-Smith had warned that 
there might be electronic surveillance and possibly breaking 
and entering, but that what he said was very fragmentary. 
Griegg said he told Stewart that he could not conceive of 
the opposition conducting that type of campaign. He said 
he told him that they did not have money to hire guards or 
buy sophisticated security equipment. 
They took great pains to create the impression that they 
did not really take the warning too seriously, and that they 
could not afford protective measures. No one seems to have 
asked why they did not complain to the authorities, but the 
answer would probably have been that they lacked hard 
evidence .of any crime. However, the fact was that they did 
have evidence of crimes. Mr. Griegg testified that the office 
had been broken into and documents and checks stolen in 
the first week of May. On another occasion there had been 
an unsuccessful attempt to force the locks. Under these 
warning would be strange. No one has admitted it, butitig, 
conceivable that a search was made for bugs and that one 
was found in Larry O'Brien's office. The break-in on June 
17 was made because that bug was not functioning 
properly. Perhaps it did not die a natural death. 
Elation After Break-In 
Woolston-Smith testified that the DNC's interest in his 
information continued right up to the time of the June 17 
break-in. He said he was in regular telephone contact with 
John Stewart ? once or twice a week. He said his last 
discussion before the break-in was along the line of 
"something is about to happen." He also said that after the 
break-in Stewart called him and was "elated." Asked what 
he was elated about, Woolston-Smith said: "Elated that we 
had more or less called it the way it happened." 
When asked to elaborate further, Woolston-Smith said: 
"This enthusiasm seemed to have been, well, we may not 
have this election, but boy, we have got them in real great 
position." He said this was because Stewart thought there 
was definite involvement of the Committee to Re-elect the 
President. He added: "They are expecting the newspapers 
to develop it." 
John Stewart painted a very different picture. According to 
his testimony, his contact with Woolston-Smith was ex-
tremely limited, and he really obtained no definitive 
information from him. He indicated that he had only one 
telephone conversation with him before Watergate. He 
could not remember any meeting with him prior to June 
17. It was only when he was told that the others had 
testified that Stewart had met with Haddad, Woolston. 
Smith and Winter prior to Watergate that he would admit 
that and then only as a possibility. Stewart also had trouble 
remembering the letter Haddad had sent to him dated April 
28, right after the meeting in New York. The letter 
characterized Woolston-Smith's story as "true and ex-
plosive," but Stewart had no recollection of ever having 
seen it, even though he was sure that he must have. 
Stewart insisted repeatedly that his only meeting with 
Woolston-Smith was after Watergate. He claims to have 
forgotten about him, but after the burglary he recalled his 
warning. He had his assistant find his name and number and 
give him a call. He arranged to meet him in New York, 
together with Haddad. 
While Haddad and Woolston-Smith frequently gave the 
impression of being fuzzy and less than candid in their 
testimony, Stewart seemed to go to unusual lengths to 
downplay his meetings and conversations with Haddad and 
Woolston-Smith. His testimony was so lacking in credibility 
that one is bound to wonder what he was afraid of. Would 
an admission that they took the advance warning seriously 
be so damaging? 
The answer is probably yes. If they took the warning 
seriously, they would have had to have known more about 
the source of the information. No one has been willing to 
come up with a credible story about how Haddad and 
Woolston-Smith managed to assemble such accurate in-
formation in advance. Thompson and his staff were 
strongly inclined to suspect some leak from the CIA. Or did 
they have access to information obtained by electronic 
surveillance? Or was there a double agent within the ranks 
of the CRP group? Suspicions have fallen on McCord, who 
bungled the break-in, confessed to Judge Sirica and ended 
up serving very little time in jail. They have fallen on 
another member of his team, Alfred Baldwin, the lookout 
man, who was never prosecuted. Baldwin was a flop as a 
lookout, and he was also the source of extensive in-
formation about the Watergate operation that provided the 
basis for a press conference by Larry O'Brien on September 
7, 1972, according to Fred Thompson's book. Thompson 
was inclined to doubt that Baldwin was a double agent only 
because he had done so many things that risked 
compromising the operation. 
Finally, if the DNC took the warning seriously, it would be 
harder to explain why no obvious defensive measures were 
taken. Woolston-Smith did not accept the idea that there 
was no money for security. He pointed out that field force 
meters could have been acquired to detect bugs at little 
cost. He noted that while the committee was saying it could 
not afford money for security, it was spending $45,000 fot 
a motor launch as a gift. His conclusion was that they had a 
plan to let the bugging take place and capitalize on it. 
The Anderson Angle 
Haddad, as we noted above, says he turned his file on the 
bugging plans over to Jack Anderson, expecting that he 
would be able to develop more detailed information. 
Anderson admitted that he received some information from 
Haddad in an article he published in Parade magazine July 
22. 1973, a little more than a year after the break-in. He 
also mentioned it in a book he wrote. 
Anderson claimed that he was not able to develop any 
information on the basis of what Haddad had given him. He 
claimed he ran into a stone wall and just dropped the 
matter. Unfortunately neither-Anderson nor Haddad 
produced the documents that addad says he sent to 
Anderson. Haddad says that he would have given him 
everything he had. That would have included the name of 
McCord. It would have included information about Cuban 
involvement, if, indeed, that information had not originated 
with Anderson, as Woolston-Smith seemed to think. 
By strange coincidence, Anderson had a very close friend in 
the Cuban community who knew a great deal about the 
Watergate matter. He was Frank Sturgis, a member of the 
burglary team who was caught in the Watergate on June 
17. Anderson went personally to the Washington, D.C. jail 
to see Sturgis as soon as he heard of the Watergate arrests. 
In fact he got there before the jailers even had Sturgis's 
correct name. He was still booked under the alias he used, 
Anderson testified, and he had a hard time finding him. 
Anderson said he learned of Sturgis's arrest from the 
papers, and this would suggest that the press had printed his 
correct name before the jailers became aware of it. 
Anderson tried to get Sturgis released to his custody, but he 
did not succeed. He visited hin: at his home in Miami while 
Sturgis was out on bail, and he also testified that he had 
telephone contacts with him during that period. On the eve 
of Sturgis's trial, Anderson was at the Arlington Towers 
Apartment one night while the Cubans were discussing 
whether they should plead guilty or not guilty. Anderson 
testified that he did not participate in that discussion, but 
from time to time one of the participants would emerge 
and report to him on what was happening. He offered to 
bring Sturgis's wife to Washington and have her stay in his 
home. He visited Sturgis twice in the Rockville, Md. jail. He 
staved in contact with Sturgis's attorney after Souirtiwsr 
-
sent to prison in Danbury, Conn. All of this is based on 
Anderson's sworn testimony. 
Why this intense interest in Frank Sturgis? Anderson said 
he was trying to get an exclu:sive story. He was trying to 
find out what Sturgis was up to at the Watergate. 
But actually Jack Anderson published very little in his 
column about Watergate. Despite his unique connection 
with Frank Sturgis, be seems to have contributed nothing 
to the breaking of the Watergate story. Indeed, the first 
column that he wrote on the subject that we were able to 
find was not published until August 25, 1972, more than 
two months after the break-in. It dealt with funds used to 
finance the bugging having been traced to a Minnesota 
businessman who had also been a financial backer of 
Hubert Humphrey. That is not the sort of thing Sturgis 
would have known about. 
In December 1972 and January 1973, Anderson did publish 
three columns about the pressure on the defendants to 
plead guilty, and he intimated that they might reveal 
embarrassing secrets if they did not get more help. This 
appears to have been the only journalistic harvest Anderson 
reaped from all his attention to Sturgis. 
Did Anderson Miss 
the Boat? 
Anderson's unusual reticence in the treatment of the 
Watergate story raises an intriguing question. Was he quiet 
because he knew so little, or was he quiet because he knew 
so much? 
If he had heard in the spring of Cuban involvement in the 
bugging plans, Sturgis would have been the logical person to 
whom he would have turned for information. Anderson 
testified that the first he knew of Sturgis's involvement in 
the Watergate bugging was when he read his name in the 
paper after the arrests. But he also testified that he had, by 
chance, met Sturgis at National Airport in Washington. D.C. 
on June 16, 1972, as Sturgis was arriving from Miami to 
participate in the break-in. 
This was an innocent chance encounter, the way he 
described it. But there was a question about why Mr. 
Anderson was at the airport. Here is how the testimony 
went. 
Q: And were you at the airport to travel yourself, you 
were leaving town? 
A: Yes, 1 was on my way to keep an engagement in 
Cleveland. 
Q: A speaking engagement? 
A: Yes 
Q: Where was that? 
A: Cleveland 
Q: Where in Cleveland? 
A: I do not recall. I have been to Cleveland three or four 
tunes to speak. We have a very enterprising paper there, the 
Cleveland Press, and they are always arranging speaking 
engagements for me. 
A spokesman for the Cleveland Press denied that it had 
sponsored or arranged for a speaking engagement for Mr. 
Anderson. in June 1972, or at any other time. A search of 
their files did reveal that Mr. Anderson had spoken in 
Cleveland on June 1, 1972, at the Park Synagogue. The 
Cleveland Press had carried a big story about the affair on 
June 2. But there was no similar evidence of a speech by 
Mr. Anderson in Cleveland on June 16 or soon thereafter. If 
Mr. Anderson did not have a speaking engagement in 
Cleveland on June 16, why did he say that he did? Why did 
he say the Cleveland Press arranged for the speech? What 
was he doing at National Airport that day? Those are 
questions the Ervin Committee investigators did not get 
around to asking. 
The mystery deepens when one notes that The Washington 
Post of June 22, 1972, quoted Anderson as saying that he 
"happened to bump into Sturgis at the airport just several 
days before the bugging incident." Asked about this on a 
Washington television program, Mr. Anderson stuck to the 
June 16th date for the encounter and denied that he had 
ever given a different date. 
The June 22nd article discussed a column Anderson had 
published two days before that had carried highly confi-
dential information about the expense accounts of 
Lawrence O'Brien, Chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee. It stated that a spokesman for the Committee 
said the information in the column could only have come 
from a file that was missing from the Committee's 
headquarters at the Watergate. Democratic officials also 
noted Anderson's close ties to Frank Sturgis. Anderson 
denied that the information had been provided by Sturgis. 
The Press Does 
Not Press 
Fred Thompson titled his chapter on the prior knowledge 
aspect of Watergate. "Unanswered Questions." Some of the 
unanswered questions he listed were these: 
1. Did McCord deliberately leave the tape on the door? 
2. Did someone alert Shoffler (one of *he arresting officers 
who was voluntarily working overtir.4 when the call about 
the Watergate break-in came over the radio)? 
3. Did the information pass from Sturgis to Anderson to 
Haddad to the DNC, or had the offices of the November 
Group been bugged, with information from conversations 
of McCord or Liddy, or both, combined with Haddad's 
"other sources" to put the story together before June 17? 
4. Or was it some combination of these things? 
S. And why had Jack Anderson been so mysteriously 
quiet? 
Thompson said: "We agreed that we had come close but 
that we had fallen short. To borrow still another Watergate 
expression, we had been unable to find the smoking gun in 
anyone's hands." 
True enough_ But the tnajor missing ingredient was the lack 
of interest on the part of the press. Thompson's small staff 
was not up to pursuing every lead and forcing a reconcilia-
tion of every contradiction. They let the matter drop, with 
many intriguing questions unanswered, "and with a 
gnawing feeling in our stomachs.-
The investigative reporters who pursued other Watergate 
stories so doggedly, showed no interest in probing for the 
o ,,tiotic Indeed, they had no 
interest in even reporting the existence of the questions. A 
reporter for The Washington Post told us that he had not 
pursued the matter because he understood that Senator 
Howard Baker thought there was nothing to the story. That 
conflicts with what Fred Thompson says, and he was close 
to Senator Baker. 
An investigative reporter for The Washington Star expressed 
amazement and interest when the story was outlined to 
him, but he reported back that his editors had dismissed it 
as "old stuff." He could not say when The Star had ever 
said a word about it. 
A reporter for The New York Times reacted similarly. He 
was very excited about the story, especially since he had 
just written a story about Bill Haddad getting a new job for 
the New York State Legislature which involved investi-
gating such things as electronic surveillance. But his interest 
apparently waned quickly. The New York Times owns 
Quadrangle, the publisher of Fred Thompson's book. That 
gave them access to the galley proofs of the book and the 
right to a scoop on any news it might contain. Not only has 
The Times not done a news story on the book, but as we go 
to press it has not even published a review of it. (The same 
is true of The Washington Post). 
News is what the editors decide is news. As with Senator 
Goldwater's story about KGB activities on Capitol Hill, the 
editors seem to have decided with virtual unanimity that 
the "prior knowledge" side of Watergate shall not be 
treated as news. It may be interesting. It may be intriguing. 
It may be of historical importance. But news it is not. The 
Times, The Post, the wire services, the networks and the 
news magazines have so decreed. 
It is an illustration of a point Leopold Tyrmand makes in 
his provocative article, "Media Shangri-La," in the winter 
1975 issue of American Scholar. He writes: 
"It took the bloody atrocities of the totalitarian move-
ments to enforce the unanirtimity of their communication 
system in the name of faith and orthodoxy. The American 
media achieved like-mindedness by entrenching themselves 
as a separate power in the name of freedom and variety of 
opinion. This cartel of solid, preordained thinking is a 
threat to democracy, all the worse because it occurs in its 
name, speckled with bogus paraphernalia, democratic in 
word but not in spirit."

Is there an orchestrated effort in 
some quarters to destroy the effective-
ness of , the Central ? Intelligence 
Agency? ,- ? 
There are those in Washington and 
elsewhere who think they detect signs 
of this. And they point, quite rightly in 
our judgment, at what appear to be in-
dications in the media of a. deliberate 
attempt to serve up all the unfavorable 
news possible about the CIA--authenti-
cated or not. ? 
Critical Report ? 
? 
At the sthrie time it is evident that 
the Washington media are not intern 
ested in presenting the CIA in a favora--.-
ble " ? . 
:? 
Accuracy in Media, Inc.- (AIM), a 
conserVative organization in the capi-
tal which monitors newspapersatelevi-
sion and radio for signs of news inaccu-
racies, distortions and omissions, 
recentlyissued a highly critical report 
of coverage of the CIA. 
ALM took particular -note of a 
speech made recently before the Amer-
ican Security Council by Lt. Gen. Ver-
non A. Warters ? which was ignored,a1-. 
-most enth'ely by the news media.- ? 
In his speech Walters declared that 
it may be possible to conduct intelli-
gence operations "in a goldfish bowl," 
but he added that if we do it, it will be 
like going to the moon. "We will be the 
only ones ever to have done it." 
A "goldfish bowl" operation seems 
to be what is wanted by the liberal in-
quisitors hi Washington, and Walters, 
who is deputy director of. the CIA, is 
clearly apprehensive aboat it. 
ALM noted that the Washington Star 
on the day Walters made. his speech 
devoted 70 colkpprdiVkleFtiFiRelFEigse 
-kr" 
theCIA, but not one line about Walters' 
remarks. A Star reporter, who was at 
the luncheon, said he found nothing 
new in Walters' remarks. Hence no 
story. 
.? ? . "It would appear!! the AIM report 
said, "that in the minds of some jour-
nalists the only thing that is newswor-
thy is material that is crticial of the 
? 
"Statements that put our intelli-
gence activities in -proper perspective,' 
defending what has been done, are 
.simply not deemed to be worth. report- . 
ALM quotes a speech made last-Feb-
ruary by Peter Arnett of the New York 
Times as reflecting the media attitude 
toward the CIA. ? 
?? "It seems to me," Arnett was quot-
ed as saying, "that this is going to 
be the year the the 'spooks' (CIA) get 
theirs, or they have to start answering. 
questions . . . Many reporters that I 
know are starting to go to Washington 
and are trying to find all the security 
people, all the discontented CIA offi-
cers and others who could feed the 
grist for the mill to find the story of 
what went on. 
I TIMM( there are going to be some 
embarrassing stories about this in the 
next few months and the next year." 
? General Walters, in his speech to 
the ASC, recalled that 20 years ago the 
'United Sta:tes believed that it was 
faced with a ruthless and implacable 
enemy who was determined to destroy 
us by any means in its power. The CIA 
at that time sought to counter the So-
viet bid for world dominion. 
As of today, Walters had this to 
say: "I think we are facing a very 
tough situation. I think the tactics may 
120041afffil.:thltAl-gtikel-ti3tigR 
R000100040001-2 
long-term goal has changed very 
.much." - - ? - 
According to the ATM report, Wal-
ters noted that many people.enow ex-
pect the intelligence service to Operate 
with a degree of purity that will not be 
? reciprocated by our enemies. He com-
pared this to fighting by the Marquis of 
Queensbury roles against an opponent 
with brass knuckles. 
As a result of the current wave a of 
calumny against the CIA, the agency's 
ability to operate is being- severely 
impaired. Said 1-Val tars : 
"People who used to give t,3 whole 
rep-orts are giving us summaries, and 
people who used to give us summaries 
are shaking hands with us. ? --
. "P-eople who used to help, us volun-
tarily are saying- don't come near me. - 
This must be a delight to the America-
is-wrongers. For the people who be-
lieve that the U.S. represents the best 
hope of -mankind for freedom in the . 
world, it is not an encouraging factor." 
Steadily Losing Ground - ? - 
Perhaps we have only to look at 
Portugal to see what the attacks noon 
the CIA are doing to the world balance 
-of power. The Soviet Union reportedly 
is pumping 510 million a month into the 
Communist party of that country. 
There is evidence that the United 
States now feels inhibited about trying . 
to counter this activity: _ 
. The destructive attitude of the 
-.Washington news media undoubtedly is 
contributing in one way or another to 
the continuing encroachments of the 
Soviet Union, despite the widely hailed 
virtues of detente. 
We are losing ground steadily just 
about everywhere, and it seems that 
there are plenty of people in Washing-

In First Period 
1315R000100040001-2 
Sales Climbed 7%; Holders 
Reject AIM Proposal for 
Study of News Handling 
By a WALL STREET JOURNAL Staff Reporter 
NEW YORK?CBS Inc. said first quartet 
earnings ros?5% to an estimated record of 
$24.2 million, or 84 cents a share, from th 
year-earlier $21 million, or 73 cents a' share. 
Sales climbed 7% to $442.2 million from 
$412.6 million. ? . - 
The earnings announcement by Williara 
S. Paley, chairman, came at the outset of 
what developed into a three-hour annual 
meeting yesterday. Among other actions 
taken during the session, which was occa-
sionally marked by extended debate. on a 
range of subjects, shareholders rejected a 
proposal by Accuracy in Media Inc. that 
would have required the company to investi-
gate charges of unfairness in programming 
by the CBS News division. . 
AIM, a group established to expose er-
rors in the news media, had charged that 
CBS news reporting was "partial, slanted 
and lopsided." CBS officials didn't dfsclose 
the exact shareholder vote on the AIM or 
other shareholder proposals, all of which 
were defeated. 
On the financial side, Arthur R.. Taylor, 
president, said that CBS-Broadcast group 
sales in the first quarter rose 5% from last 
year, with the company's television network 
making the largest contribution. Mr. Taylor 
said the CBS-Records group had record first 
quarter sales, up 8% from a year ago, "with 
significant gains for the international divi-
sion more than offsetting some weakness in 
the domestic market." 
The CBS-Columbia group and CBS-Pub-
lishing group, Mr. Taylor said, had sales 
gains of 14% and 16%, respectively. 
Under questioning bY shareholders, Mr. 
Paley disclosed that CBS's previously an-
nounced plan to sell the professional prod-
ucts department of the CBS Laboratories 
unit to Thomson-SF S.A., a French com-
pany, involved a sales price of "about $3 
million." Mr. Paley, who is 73 years old, 
also reiterated that he has no plan to re-
tire. 
A major reason for the length of the 
meeting was debated between Mr. Paley and 
Evelyn Y. Davis, who attends many stook-
holder meetings. Other shareholders also 
spoke at length on Mrs. Davis's criticisms 
of Mr. Paley, and CBS.

A Columnist vs. 
Accuracy in Media, which likes to

is a Washington-based organization 
that bills itself as a non-partisan guard-
ian of "the people's right to accurate, i 
unbaised news coverage." Its mission, 
which it purso,:s with disconcerting 
zeal?and a et-lain selectivity?is to 
blow the whistle on inaccuracies and

AIM does not disclose its contribu-

But the main target was Irvine him-
self. .AndersOn charged that as -a Fed-
eral ?Pieserve Board official he used 
-government time and facilities to for-
ward AIM's "Watergate-style assault 
on the press." possibly in violation of 
the law. Specifically, he said that Ir-
vine; working for AIM undercovereef 
his federal job, obtained a copy .ofenis 
unpublished !aovernment report An-
derson had used in writing an earlier 
column and nut only used, it in 'fram-
ing. an AIM attack on Anderson but 
also sought to discredit the report. 
Irvine says the chaenes.. are false. 
He says he didn't use federal time or 
facilities on AIM business and what 
he, did in connection with tile report, 
a Library of Congress study on oans 
to Chile, was a legitimate part of his 
Fed job. He says his AIM woek is 
strickly moonlighting. And he says 
the real Purpose of Anderson's column 
was to 'silence a troublesome critic. 
Soon after the column appeared, 
Anderson and Irvine were ':.ed to 
a House Banking subcommittee near-
ing, where each told his story. The 
hearing ended with a charge by An-
derson that Irvine had cOMMitted per-
jury there in denying he did AIM 
work in his fed office. The columnist 
offered to preduce proof thv Irvine 
had made a call on behalf of AIM on 
his government phone, but the offer' 
was not tr ken up. 
Two days later, the Federal Reserve 
Board announced that an investigation. 
had cleared Irvine of the misconduct 
charges. Anderson says the case isn't 
closed. The House subcommittee is 
continuing its investigation. 
A thorny question is raised by the 
..foregOing, one that has nothing to do, 
with the accuracy -of the Anderson' 
charges against It-vine. It is this: Did: 
-Anderson ? abuse the power of the: 
Press?specifically the great power he 
himself wields by virtue of publican 
tion in nearly 1,00n neva:papers?to1 
shoot down a critic? 
Anderson indignantly says no. He: 
concedes that annoyance overIr-
vine's "constant misstatements" about, 
his column and Irvine's letters to edi-
tors figured in the decision to investi-
gate AIM and its chairman. But he 
maintains that the resulting column. 
stands on its own feet. Irvine is a pub-
lie figure guilty of improper conductil 
he says, and he deserved to be 12N-
posed. Further. Anderson sees sinister" 
implications in Irvine's AIM that make 
its exposure as a right-wing at-press 
operation a matter of public interest. 
Irvine 'maintains that Anderson's 
column was a gross misuse of the,. 
power of the press and a violation of., 
his civil liberties.

but it was not published until the 
day after the hearing?eight days

announced in advance, The Post did 
not assign one of its own reporters 
to cover it?a failure in my opinion 
to meet its responsibility as the Wash-

Anderson, AIM and t 
Speech Issue 
By ALLAN H. RYSKIND 
Columnist Jack Anderson exudes a certain piety. 
when he sinks his teeth into a victim, but he is also a 
self-righteous bully, a below-the-belt street fighter, 
who relishes flinging mud at those who challenge him 
in any way. Anderson the bully was on full display 
before the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary 
Policy of the Committee on Banking, Housing and 
Currency on March 18. , 
The hearing iiroduced a bit of fireworks, with 
Anderson frenetically shouting "perjury" at his prey, 
arguing with clumps of interested bystanders, and, 
finally, just before exiting the hearing room, engag-
ing in a near brawl with columnist Paul Scott. Wher-
ever Anderson goes, controversy is sure to follow. 
The hearing had been called by Chairman Wright 
Patman after Anderson and his associate, Les Whit-
ten; had penned an awful diatribe?straight from one 
of Herblock's famous sewers?against Federal Re-
serve Board economist Reed Irvine. 
Serving in his spare time as chairman of Accuracy 
in Media (AIM), a private organization devoted to 
correcting media misinformation, Irvine had gone so 
far, argued Anderson, as to engage in a "Watergate-
style assault on the free press." He had used "his fed-
eral post to gather ammunition for his anti-press 
campaign from unsuspecting government re-
searchers." And then Anderson wandered around to 
the crux of his ire: "Irvine has also kept up a torrent 
of abuse against us "(Italics added.) 
Irvine had clearly committed a "no-no." While 
Anderson, of course, feels it his solemn duty to 
pulverize his targets at will in the 400-plus papers 
that carry his daily column, he apparently believes 
that Irvine has no right of reply. No matter how 
erroneous Anderson is, Irvine, Supposedly, is 
to behave like a vegetable or a Lump of sod. 
Freedom of expression is only for the privileged 
few of the fourth estate, you understand. 
Patman initiated the inquiry into Irvine's 
activities as a means Of getting at his old enemy,? 
the Federal Reserve Board, which Patman views as a 
creation of Beelzebub. The Texas populist has been 
seeking an audit of the Federal Reserve, and he clearly 
hopes to force one by proving that the board is some-
how improperly backing Irvine's crusade for accuracy. 
The Patman panel, however, is not the place to 
expect a judicious finding on Irvine's activities. Pat-
man, as noted, is out to lynch the Federal Reserve 
Board, and he has latched onto Irvine as a convenient 
scapegoat. He also unleashed Anderson as Irvine's 
chief accuser, though Anderson can hardly be con-
sidered an objective observer, since AIM has so fre-
quently caught Anderson with his facts down. 
Patman's administrative aide, Baron L Shacklette, 
curiously enough, has also had a close association 
with Anderson. In 1958, Shacklette was an investi-
gator for the Special House Committee on Legislative 
Oversight. "Mr. Shacklette," noted the New York 
Times recently, "was forced to resign [in 1958.1 when 
it was discovered that he and Mr. Anderson, then an 
assistant to the late Drew Pearson, had electronically 
bugged a hotel suite rented by Bernard Goldfine, a 
Boston industrialist accused of seeking and receiving 
favors" from President Eisenhower's assistant, 
Sherman Adams. If Putman is searching for pos-
sible conspiracies and conflicts of interest, he 
might cast a glance in the mirror. 
Anderson's bias against Irvine was evident from 
the outset of the hearings. The lead-off witness, the 
columnist began with his mud-gun on fully auto?-
matic. Splattering away, he decided to speculate on 
the possibility that Irvine's efforts to correct the 
media just might have been part of the Watergate 
"plumbers" operation. Any proof? No, just throwing 
ideas around. Ile suggested AIM was a front for bank?. 
ers and the oil companies because it had rallied .to., 
their defense on an issue or two. But then why didn't 
Anderson accuse AIM of being a front for Ralph 
Nader, since it has also rallied to his defense as well? 
Anderson then tossed his biggest mud-pie of all: 
he hinted, ever so vaguely, that AIM members may 
somehow have a Ku Klux mentality. He managed

this by quoting some newspaper to the ell'ect that 
AIM "'was afflicted by paranoia symptoms usually 
associated with the Ku Klux Klan syndrome.'" 
Anderson's efforts to conjure up the Klan in connec-
tion with AIM was not only wicked but stupid, since 
such an insinuation could only damage Anderson's 
reputation, not Irvine's. (Just for the record, AIM's 
first two executive secretaries, Benjamin (Iinzburg 
and Abraham Kalish. are Jews, while Irvine has a 
Japanese wife. Not exactly Klan material.) 
Not having thrown enough sludge at AIM, Ander-
son tried to convey the idea that everyone connected 
with MM was somehow on the extreme right. He. 
depicted its board of directors as a bunch of "ex-
military men, former ambassadors, rightist ideo-
logues, retired Red-hunters," a description which 
drew hoots of derision from those in the hearing room 
actually familiar with the composition of the AIM 
board. 
Anderson described Murray Baron, a board mem-
ber, for instance, as "a former AFL-CIO official, who 
worked with the right-wing Committee of One Mil-
lion [to keep Red China out of the United Nations.)" 
Mr. Baron, however, also happens to be a former of-
ficial of the Liberal party in New York and an early 
stalwart of Americans for Democratic Action. How 
could this information have eluded Super Sleuth? 
Moreover, Senator Jacob Javits (R.-N.Y.) and Wil-
Him Proxmire (D.-Wis.)?hardly right-wing ideo-
logues--also belonged to the Committee of One Mil-
lion, as did the overwhelming majority of Congress 
at one time. 
Anderson dismissed AIM board member Lewis 
Walt, one of the country's most distinguished ex-
Marine generals and a member of President Ford's 
Clemency Board, as a "crony of Sen. James Eastland 
[D.-Miss.]," which happens to be totally inaccurate. 
He is, however, a crony of ex-Sen. Paul Douglas, 
a liberal, who, having served under Walt in World 
War II, became one of Walt's great admirers and 
friends. 
It also eluded Anderson that former Secretary of 
State Dean Acheson was on the AIM board until his 
death and that such noted liberals as Morris Ernst, 
a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, and 
Harry D. Gideonese, chancellor of the New School of 
Social Research in New York, arc current members. 
Anderson saved much of his wrath for Irvine di-
rectly. Irvine's "diatribes, issued in the name of 
accuracy," thundered Anderson, "have no more to 
do with accuracy than the Communist people's 
democracies have to do with democracy." 
Then the columnist delivered a sentence that, 
for sheer gall, deserves a Pulitzer l'rize. "We 
should," he proclaimed, "caution the subcom-
mittee that Irvine is a specialist at manipulating 
glance, appears authentic. He will shave a fact 
here, twist a troth there, remove a statement 
ever so slightly from context. Then he will present 
the fabrication with such bold authority that 
?the unsuspecting reader easily can be taken 
unaware." In psychology, this is called "pro-
jection," attributing your worst offenses to 
? others, 
Yet it was Anderson who came up short on the 
facts. His major accusation against Irvine before the 
Patman panel is that he used his official Federal Re-
serve position on behalf of Accuracy in Media. But 
' Federal Reserve Board Gov. Robert Holland wrote 
1 Rep. Patman on March 19 that a thorough review 
leads the board "to conclude that Mr. Irvine did 
not abuse his official position through use of 
.Federal Reserve facilities on behalf of AIM." In all 
t. . 
of Irvine's correspondence at the Federal Reserve, 
i only two letters even Mention AIM at all, and these 
i mentions were only asides. 
What had really set Anderson off was that Irvine 
and AIM had nailed an Anderson.colurnn concerning 
Chile as inaccurate. Anderson had charged that the 
Li. S. sought to bankrupt the Allende government and 
had helped to bring about that country's "financial 
strangulation" by cutting off loans from the Inter-
American Development Bank. He based his column 
on an unpublished Congressional Research Serv-
ice study. Irvine, whose responsibilities at the board i 
include monitoring and analyzing the operations of 
the IDB, found some serious errors in the study 
which he pointed out to the CRS in his official 
capacity. . 
On his own time, Irvine wrote a letter for AIM 
saying that the Anderson column, based on the CRS 
study, was dead wrong, that the IDB, in fact, was dis-
bursing loans to Allende up to the time of his over-
throw. Irvine also pointed out that Chile's dependence 
on IDB disbursements was actually quite small, 
contrary to Anderson's report. 
Irate over Irvine's efforts to correct him, Ander-
son charged in his column and before Patman that Ir-
vine had misused his position at the Federal Re-
serve to get information for AIM. In effect, Ander- i 
son seemed to be saying that Irvine Might be permit-
ted to respond, but only after he had obliterated from 
his memory any knowledge he had gained through his 
profession. In fact, Gov. Holland asserted that Ir-
vine acted in a perfectly proper way. And Irvine testi-
fied that, unlike Anderson, he does not even use 
information in his work for AIM that is not avail-
able to the general public. 
Though ostentatiously demanding to be sworn in, 
Anderson uttered another massive falsehood when he 
took issue with Irvine's previous criticism of an 
Anderson assault on the Senate Internal Security 
facts to form a false picture which, at quick Ritfteliu7161*-141:9081114,113)it 111643'04r0004013111Faack

- 1 Members of the council staff, said the NNC, "vis-
ited Washington and -examined the five 'Papers in full-. 
.and in detail.. They found that the quotations by 
' 
'Anderson did in fact. misrepresent the attitudes of 
the students toward torture as set forth in their papers. 
In addition, they found that all .five papers were writ-
ten in the. years 1965-67, a fact, not mentioned in the 
Anderson 'column (which gave the impression that 
they were reasonably Contemporary). 
"In a letter dated Dec. 30, 1974,, Mr.. Anderson I 
insisted that the statements in his column were sup- I

national and the National Council of Chtirehes.'- as 
well as with Sem.- James Abouretk and unnamed 
members of his stall all of whom, it was suggested., 
would support Anderson's charges. 
That Anderson would repeat such inaccuracies ! 
under oath is astonishing. First of all, there is no 
recent report on Marijuana, but a hearing record, 
which is quite different. Secondly, Gen. Walt had 
zero to do with the hearing record. Thirdly, the hear-
ing record was put together by a full-time staffer, 
David Martin, not an outside consultant. Fourthly, 
the hearing record of over 400 pages can hardly be 
considered "crackpot," since it includes the consid-
ered and qualified testimony of 21 top-ranking scien-
tists from around the world. Among them: Prof. W. 
D. M. Paton, head of the British drug research pro-
gram, perhaps the world's top-ranking pharmacolo- ? 
gist; Dr. Henry Brill, regional director, New York 
State Department of Mental Hygiene;_tor. Julius Axel-
rod, a Nobel laureate, of the National Institute of 
Mental Health; Prof. Nils Bejerot of Sweden, one of . 
the world's top experts on drug abuse; and Prof. M. I. 
Soueif, chairman, Department of Psychology and 
Philosophy, Cairo, Egypt, who has done the classic 
study of the hashish impact on the Egyptian popula-
tion. 
The hearing record, in fact, his revolutionized the 
thinking on marijuana, and has altered the thinking of 
many persons in the area who previously had a much 
more tolerant attitude toward marijuana's dangers. 
To disagree with its findings is one thing; to call 
it crackpot is, well, crackpot. 
gen...,..IY'lark Hatfield (R.-Ore.), who, along with.  
Jack Anderson, hopes to rid the Senate of its In-
ternal Security subcommittee, said on March 7 that 
he believed the marijuana hearing was "a very extra-
ordinary piece of research" and commendCd the 
SISS's general counsel, Jay Sourwine, and staffer 
Martin "for this very outstanding work." 
In trying to assail Irvine's credibility vis-a-vis his 
own column, Anderson's testimony, however, con-
tained a curious omission. It failed to mention that 
on February 4 the National News Council, whose 
executive editor is William Arthur, former editor of 
Look magazine, issued a formal finding upholding 
AIM's complaint that Anderson had twisted facts re-
garding the International Police Academy. 
"11. such support as wa.?: alleged by Mr. Anderson 
exists, it is up to him, not this Council, to develop and 
publish it. Al M's complaint alleged simply that the 
live quotations set forth and relied on in the original 
Anderson column misrepresented the views of the 
writers; and the complaint is quite correct." 
But the NNC wasn't finished. "Nor can Mr. An-
derson," it went on, "escape responsibility for the 
misrepreseritations.by pointing to the second sentence 
of his column, which stated, 'After a lengthy investiga-
tion, we found no evidence that the academy actually 
advocates third-degree methods* In the first place, 
ekculpating the academy itself does not excuse leav-
ing a false implication with respect to the views of the 
live named students. In the second place, the sentence 
was simply inconsistent with the general thrust of the 
column, which Mr. Anderson's own syndicate titled 
The Torture Graduates.' " 
Briefly, then, Anderson's attack against Irvine, 
far from a public service, looks more like a private 
vendetta?launched from. a platform financed by the 
taxpayers?to squelch a critic who has rattled Ander-
son on numerous occasions. Rep. Pittman, moreover,.

Crucial Comments Cut from Interview 
AIM Protests CBS Editing of Castro Special 
By JEFFREY HART 
The big guns are now being trained on Accuracy 
in Media (AIM), a private Washington organization 
devoted to publicizing distortions and misrepresenta-
tions in the major media. It was only a matter of 
time, of course, before so persistent and persistently 
accurate a media critic would come under attack. 
AIM is now involved in a bitter controversy on two 
fronts. The first involves an argument with columnist 
Jack Anderson over AI M's charge that Anderson has 
slanted the facts in a recent column on attitudes to-
ward torture at the International Police Academy. 
The dust has not settled on that one yet. AIM, of 
course, is not infallible. But the foundation-supported 
National News Council, headed by a former New 
York chief judge, and embracing many shades of 
opinion, has backed AIM against Anderson. 
Anderson, however, in the course of replying to 
AIM, launched a secondary and unrelated attack 
upon AIM Chairman Reed Irvine, who is also a Fed-
eral Reserve Board economist. Anderson charged that 
Irvine has used his federal office for his AIM work. 
This was followed by the decision of Rep. Wright 
Patman of Texas to call a hearing of his House Bank-
ing subcommittee to look into Irvine's alleged infrac-
tion. (A Federal Reserve Board inquiry said Irvine 
"did not abuse his official position through use of 
Federal Reserve facilities on behalf of AIM.") 
Ominously enough, in a letter to Fed Chairman 
Arthur Burns, Patman stated it as a fact that 
Irvine and AIM seek to "harass the press, and 
hamper' their reporting of news of major public 
interest." That statement sounds as if it had been 
confeeted by some PR man for the major media, 
and it certainly does not describe the work or the 
motives of AIM. Time and again, AIM has doc- ? 
umented a major distortion or an outright lie by 
the media, most recently catching'none other than 
CBS and Mr. Dan Rather with their hands in the 
? ideological cookie jar. 
Last October, CBS put on an hour-long documen-
tary, "Castro, Cuba and the U. S. A." featuring Dan 
Rather and including an interview with Castro by 
Rather. In his commentary, Rather sought to convey 
the impression that Cuba no longer supports revolu-
tionary movements in other Latin American countries. 
This is a key political point, since Cuba's ostracism 
by the Organization of American States was based on 
. precisely such export of Marxist revolution. 
Today, said Rather, Castro talks "more of concilia-
tion and trade." In a central passage on the issue, 
Rather said: "Che [Guevara] went to Bolivia in 1967, 
was killed there trying to carry out a Castro-style 
guerrilla war. Che's way failed. Now, Castro talks 
more of conciliation and trade. Indeed, while keeping 
Che's memory alive in Cuba, Castro is pushing else-
where an economic union of all Latin American na-
.tions." The greening of Castro, you gather. 
. Now AIM noticed something interesting. Included

Approved For Release 2004/11/01 : CIA-RDP88-Bta13R000100040001-2 
in the Rather documentary on Cuba were some ex-
cerbts from a taped interview with Castro made by 
Frank Mankiewicz and Kirby Jones, to which CBS 
had acquired the rights. CBS obviously knew every-
thing Castro had said in this interview. 
In it, Castro was asked about his support for- rev-
olutionary violence elsewhere. He replied: "Do we 
sympathize with revolutionaries? Yes, we do. Have 
we aided revolutionaries as much as we have been 
able to? Yes, we have." 
Asked under what conditions he would support 
revolutionaries abroad, _Castro elaborated: "It is 
essential that they be fighting. If they are not, then 
we don't. When they fight, we back them." 
Those words, of course, contradicted the entire 
thrust of the Rather broadcast. And so they were 
just omitted. 
I give you AIM's conclusion: "That comes close to 
being deliberate falsification with intent to mislead. 
Instead of informing the American people that Castro 
had not changed his policy, letting them hear it from 
his own lips, CBS censored Castro. Knowing that 
Castro was still helping those dedicated to violent 
overthrow of other governments, Dan Rather falsely 
implied that this was all past history and that Castro 
had switched to...talking of 'conciliation and trade.'" 
It looks as if CBS has decided to put its considerable 
resources behind the policy of detente with Cuba; even 
? if that means a little judicious?editing. 
And you can see why AIM, ferreting out this sort 
of thing, is such a nuisance to the media barons. 
Naturally, AIM has come under attack, Wright Pat-
man taking on the role of Sam Ervin.

NEW YORK, .Feb; 5 (AP) ? 
The National News Council 
said today a. syndicated Jack 
Anderson column entitled 
"The Torture Graduates" 
made biased and inaccurate 
use of quotations from source 
letters. 
- Accuracy in Media, a Wasg 
ington-based group, had filed 
the complaint against the col-
umn with the National News 
Council, a private organizaton 
that investigates allegations

dia.

FOR THE RECORD 
Margaret Fisk's characterization of 
Ac-
curacy in Media's complaint against Eric 
Sevareid for his inaccurate assessment of 
American news media coverage of the Hue 
massacres was misleading. 
On September 12, Eric Sevareid criti-
cized Soviet Nobel Prize-winning novelist, 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, for saying that 
the Communist massacre of over 5000 ci-
vilians at Hue did not arouse much atten-
tion or protest in Western countries. Seva-
reid said Solzhenitsyn was wrong and that 
the hue massacres had been heavily re-
ported. 
This was obviously not a minor issue. 
Solzhenitsyn's statement had been widely 
reported around the world. Sevareid 
thought it important enough to criticize in 
his nationwide television commentary. The 
question was, which was Correct. 
Accuracy in Media informed Mr. Seva-
reid that we could find only two stories on 
this terrible massacre in the New York 
Times in 1968. There was no editorial com-
ment and no photos. By way of contrast; 
we noted that The Times index for 1969 
had no less than 31/2 pages of entries on 
My Lai even' though that story did not 
break until the 11th month of the year. 
We haVe presented to CBS and Eric Seva-
reid considerable additional evidence dem-
onstrating that Solzhenitsyn was absolutely 
correct in his criticism of the scanty at-
tention paid to the Hue massacres by the 
news media in this country. We invited 
CBS to tell us how heavily they covered 
the massacres Jn their news programs. 
CBS has revealed nothing whatsoever 
about its own coverage of the Hue mas-
sacres, and neither Sevareid nor CBS has 
presented a single piece of evidence to 
show that the reporting of the massacres 
was anything but scanty. Indeed, Sevareid 
has said that it would require considerable 
research to check his impression that the 
coverage was heavy and he has said that he 
is unwilling to undertalce that research. This 
is tantamount to an admission that he criti-
cized Solzhenitsyn on network television 
without having first checked the facts. 
After having failed to persuade Sevareid 
that he owed Solzhenitsyn an apology, 
AIM decided to see what the National 
_News Council would do with i this case. We 
filed a complaint with them on October 22, 
over a month after we first wrote to Seva-
reid. (This is of some importance, since 
the National News Council' will not take a 
complaint unless the complainant has first 
written to the newspaper or broadcaster 
and has failed to receive a satisfactory re-
ply within 30 (lays. This is no doubt one 
reason the Council does not get many com-
plaints.) 
The NNC responded promptly to AIM 
on November 2, 1973. Your article was in-
accurate in. saying that the decision came. 
after three months of correspondence. The 
decision had two points: 
"heavy" coverage. It thought that the con-
trast with the incomparably heavier cov-
erage of the Mv Lai massacre of 109 ci-
vilians was irrelevant since "the My Lai 
massacre invrilved the killing of defense-
less civilians by 'American soldiers, an act 
unorecedented in the history of our coun-
try." ? 
On the first point, the NNC seems to take 
the position that editorials are privileged 
ground for factual inaccuracy. AIM does 
not agree. We agree, rather, with Franklin 
R. Smith of the Burlington (Vt.) Free 
Press, who, in a talk published in E & P on 
May 1, 1971. said: 
"An editorial can 'promote any cause, 
criticize any situation or express any 
opinion no matter how far out?hut 
don't get caught with erroneous facts." 
On the second point, I feel that the 
NNC position bears out the very criticism 
that Solzhenitsyn was making--that there 
exists a terrible double standard in the 
treatment of misdeeds. The killing of 109 
Vietnamese civilians at My Lai was given

So, says, Arthur, he and

"That's the only way to deal 
with them fairly." 
"We certainly hope we're 
not going to be used on a

said that "I wish 'to propose

A Group Keeps Bitsj; 
Trying to Ensure 
Accuracy of Media 
So-Called Liberal Media Are 
Targets of Pest, er, Gadfly; 
Does It Have Any Influence?v 
By JOHN PIERSON 
,Staff Reporter Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
WASHINGTON ? The Washington Post, it 
seems, has discovered a nifty way to make 
money. 
First, it prints some slanted and/or inaccur-
ate stories. This stirs uP an organization called 
Accuracy in Media Inc., which writes several 
letters to the Post to. complain. Then the Post 
publishes only one. 
So AIM buys space in the paper to advertise 
its "letters the editor of the Washington Post 
refused to print." This cost AIM $1,800. 
Next, a reader writes in to ask why the Post 
didn't run AIM's letters in the first place. And 
the Post explains that printing all of them 
? wouldn't have left any room for anybody else 
to voice his opinions. And AIM writes back that 
correction of error deserves top priority. But 
the Post won't run this letter, either. 
So AIM buys more space?for the original 
letters from its first ad, for the Post's reply, 
for AIM's reply to the reply and for a ballot 
so readers can say how they feel about it all. 
That's $2,400 more for the Post, and the end 
may not he in sight. 
This said, It now is necessary to report, in 
the interests of accuracy and fairness, that the 
Post thinks its original stories were both fair 
and accurate and that if AIM wants to spend 
money to print letters that didn't make the 
paper free of charge, that's AIM's-business. 
"They are biased, and they're trying to sub-
stitute their news judgment for ours," declares 
managing editor Howard Simons. "But I don't 
really worry about them. They're more of a 
pest than anything." 
AIM' doesn't mind being called a pest, al-
though it would prefer the more dignified 
"gadfly." But the group rejects the idea that 
the nips it has been taking out of the hide of 
the Post, The New York Times, the TV net-
works and others of the allegedly liberal media 
are having HO effect. 
"I like to feel we have a sort of background 
influence, that writers are a little more careful 
of their facts after we've had a paid ad in the 
Times or the Post," says Abraham Kalish, 
ATM's executive secretary. 
Some Allegations 
Although go-rounds with the Post are taking 
the lion's share of AIM's time just now, during 
the past year. the Washington-based -organiza-
tion has: 
?Run an ad in The New York Times criti-
cizing, Times columnist Anthony Lewis for re-
porting that the North Vietnamese might be 
25X1 
Times columnist, Tom Wicker, correct eight 
"serious" errors concerning ? electric power 
projects in the Southwest, a State Department 
computer and the Communist massacre of ci-
vilians in Hue in 1968. (Mr. Wicker concedes he 
"probably should have run a correction" of his 
computer mistake, but he says his Southwest 
power errors were "not fundamental" and 
maintains the Hue massacre is "a matter of 
how you read history.") 
?Filed a complaint with the Federal Com-
munications Commission charging that NBC 
had violated the "fairness doctrine" with its 
documentary "Pensions: The Broken Prom-
ise." (NBC says that "the program was fair, 
and in addition to focusing on abuses in private 
pensions, it did acknowledge the existence of 
many good private plans and satisfied partici-
pants.") 
?Brought a Rand Corp consultant to Wash-
ington to take part in a televised discussion of 
whether a bloodbath would follow a Communist 
takeover of South Vietnam. Mr. Kalish told 
Martin Agronsky, host of WETA-TV's Evening 
Edition, that the consultant was needed to 
"balance the anti-bloodbath views" of other 
participants. (Mr. Agronsky says that Mrs. 
Howard. Nutt was a welcome addition to the 
program but denies that without her it would 
have been one-sided.) 
?Helped persuade ABC to correct five fac-
tual errors in a documentary, "Arms and Secu-
rity: How Much is enough?" ABC senior vice 
president William Sheehan says, "There was 
one bad error, but the rest were trivial.") 
?Urge businessmen to insist on seeing the 
text of any program they sponsor before it's 
broadcast on radio or TV. 
"Right-Wing Point of View" - 
Many of AIM's targets refuse to take the or-
ganization seriously, because they feel its criti-
cisms are so one-sided. They note, too, that 
AIM almost never finds error or bias in conser-
vative columns or publications. "Kalish is for 
accuracy as long as it's his kind of accuracy," 
says Charles Seib, managing editor of The 
Washington Star-News. "He obviously repre-
sents a right-wing point of view." 
But Mr. Kalish says AIM has remonstrated 
with a Midwest paper over an article blaming 
fluoridated water for causing sickle-cell ane-
mia. He says AIM has challenged the National 
Review, a conservative periodical, for at least 
four "errors." 
"Most of the news media are liberal-ori-
ented, and most of the complaints that come to 
us concern the liberal media," Mr. Kalish 
says. "I make a special effort to find conserva-
tive error, but we can't make up cases if they 
don't exist or if we don't get complaints." 
Complaints come in from ordinary citizens 
as well as special-interest groups. The NBC 
documentary on pensions, for example, was 
brought to AIM's attention by businessmen, 
business groups and actuaries, AIM says; In 
addition, ATM's officers and advisory-board 
members are also careful newspaper readers 
and TV watchers. 
AIM's president is Pi-an,-is Wilson, profes-
clearing mines from Haiphong harbor as sot emeritus of government at the. University 
quickly as U.S. planes dropped them. (Mr. of Illinois, and its chairman is Reed Irvine, an 
economist with the Federal Reserve Board. 
Lewis replies that "some of the AIM criticism

?Placed another ad in l'he Washington 
Star-News demanding that another New York oresc.ent bow ties, gaudy shirts and lizard-skin 
shoes, says he takes no pay from AIM and 
lives on his government pension. He holds' 
down expenses by renting office space at a cut 
rate from his wife, who has a secretarial and 
phone-answering service. 
AIM started small in 1969, and even in the 
year that ended last April 30?the first year. 
AIM had tax-exempt status?contributions to-
taled only $6,412. and expenses $5,047. But busi-
ness is picking up. This year's budget should 
be about $65,000, Mr. Kalish says, and Lead 
year's goal is $100,000. 
AIM's two largest donors so far are an un-
disclosed foundation ($10,000) and an anony-
mous company ($10,000). The 1,200 other con-
tributors include, according to Mr. Kalish, 
foundations, trade associations, professional 
groups, labor unions, women's clubs, business 
firms and individuals. He declines to identify 
any contributor, because some are worried 
about getting "on every mailing list in the: 
world" while businessmen have expressed fear 
of "bad publicity that would hurt their busi-
ness." 
In answer to one question sometimes asked, 
Mr. Kalish says AIM receives no money from 
the 'White House. Nor docs the White House 
send AIM complaints about the media, he 
adds. Lyndon Allin, the man who prepares 
President Nixon's daily news summary, 
agrees. "They've done some very good stuff," 
he says, "but we haven't had.any contact with 
them." 
When a complaint cbmes- in, Mr. Kalish nor-
mally farms it out to one of some 30 "consul-
tants." They prepare rebuttals, often in the 
form of letters to the editor. 
If a paper or network refuses to run a letter 
or recant error, AIM urges the 4,000 readers of 
its monthly report?contributors, newsmen, li. 
brarians, and others?to complain to the editor, 
the network president, the network's affiliatet 
stations, their Senators or their Congressmen 
How effective is all this? Mr. Kalish claim! 
AIM's biggest success was in getting ABC ti 
admit those five errors in its defense documen 
tary. But ABC's Mr. Sheehan says the networl 
received a lot more complaints from anotha 
conservative organization, the American Sect 
rity Council. 
Mr. Kalish thinks Martin Agronsky's pane 
show has "gotten better" since AIM begs: 
hounding him about "lack of balance." (Mi 
Agronsky calls Mr. Kalish "utterly irrespons: 
hie" and adds: "If we're going straight accore 
lag to him, I'm ashamed of myself.") 
Mr. Kalish claims he has forced the FCC t 
take speedy action on his "fairness doctrine 
complaints. "But, of course, they're rulin 
against me in every case." he concedes. 
And AIM achieved "sort of a breal 
through," Mr. Kalish adds, when The Ne? 
York Times finally printed one of his letters 1 
the editor. In fact, Mr. Kalish's proudest pa 
session appears to be a framed letter to Hi 
from Times publisher Arthur Ochs Suizberge 
which begins: "I believe you must be the ma 
Approved For Release 2004/11/01: CIA-RDP88-01315R000100040001-2? 
thorough reader that The New York Times has, 
and I think in the particular instance that you 
mention in your letter of January 24 you are 
correct." (The January 24 letter called the 
publisher's attention to a column by corre-
spondent Lewis which, as Mr. Kalish put it, 
erred by suggesting that the British involve-
ment in World War II "was in response to a 
German attack on Britain," Mr. Kalish point-
ed out th,at Britain entered the war after Ger-
many invaded Poland and before Britain it-
self had been attacked.) 
Beyond this, what about that "background 
influence" Mr. Kalish likes to think AIM brings 
to bear upon reporters to keep them straight? 
The Post's Mr. Simons doubts this influence is 
very influential, and so do a lot of other news-
men. 
But the Star-News' Mr. Seib gives AIM 
more credit. AIM, lie says, ? "keeps us on our 
toes. Only I wish we had someone on the other 
(liberal) side doing the same thing."

The following letters have been submitted to the Post by Accuracy in Media for the purpose of correcting inac-
curacies or misleading information published in the Post and other papers. The editor has dec fined to publish th-,se 
letters. Since AIM believes that the readers of the Washington Post really do have a right to know, we are poblisheig

John Stewart Service 
Jan. 31. 1973 
SIR: In reporting on a luncheon given at the State Depart-
ment to honor John Stewart Service and other "old Cnina 
hands" of the 1940's, the Post described the recipient of 
this honor as "the men who were persecuted and dismissed 
for sending news their country did riot want to hear." This 
statement was apparently based on an uncritical acceptance-
of an assertion made by Mr. William C. Harrop, Chairman of 
the Board of Directors of the American Foreign Service 
Association, the sponsor of the luncheon. 
In a letter announcing the luncheon, Mr. Herron said "The 
facts they reported were unwelcome at home. Many of these 
officers suffered harsh domestic criticism and were unable 
to continue their careers." 
Mr. Harrop has admitted in private conversations that he 
had never made any systematic study of the reporting of the 
foreign service officers whose reporting his association was 
honoring. Nor was he able to cite any study that would 
? confirm that Service and his colleagues suffered because they 
reported factually and objectively information that was "un-
welcome at home." ? 
An analysis of the reports from China Submitted by John 
Stewart Service in 1944 suggests that Mr. Service was funda-
mentally wrong in his judgments about the philosophy and 
Intentions of the Chinese Communists. For example, a report 
of his dated September 28, 1944. said: "The Communist po-
litical program is simple democracy. This is much more 
American than Soviet in form and spirit." In the same report, 
Mr. Service assured Washington that it was wrong to think 
that Mao wanted to bring socialism to China. He said: "The 
next stage in China's advance must be capitalism." 
Mr. Service's analysis of the Chinese communists was 
dead wrong, but it is incorrect to say that it was unwelcome 
in Washington. On the contrary, this kind of analysis was 
very popular in the United States in 1944. Mr.- Service was 
simply one voice in a loud chorus that was telling America 
that the true democrats in China were the communists and 
that we should support them, not Chiang. That chorus was 
largely successful in getting American policy changed, and 
the policies recommended by Service, and his colleagues 
were to a large extent adopted. 
Those historians who are now rewriting history would have 
us believe that Washington ignored Service and Davies and 
gave unstinting support to Chiang Kai-shek. That is not true. 
The policies followed in the critical postwar years were 
essentially those that these experts recommended. We actu-
ally withheld vitally needed aims from Chiang for a whole 
year while we tried to force him into forming a coalition 
government with the communists. 
Amnesty 
Feb. 9, 1973 
SIR: Haynes Johnson's recent article on the issue of amnesty 
(214/73) suggests that there is a need to clear up the serious 
misunderstanding that has arisen about the actions and atti-
tude of Abraham Lincoln toward deserters and draft evaders. 
.Johnson and others have discussed Lincoln's policies with-
out drawing a clear distinction between his offer of amnesty 
to those who had rebelled against the Government of the 
United States and fought for the Confederacy and his policy 
toward those who deserted from the Union forces or evaded 
the draft. The distinction is an important one. 
Lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation on December 6, 
1663. while the war was still in progress. It provided that 
members of the Confederate forces below the rank of colonel 
and others who were supporting the Confederate cause, with 
certain exceptions, would be exempted from any punishment 
if they took a loyalty oath. The purpose of the proclamation 
was to encourage desertion from the Confederate forces. It 
did not aPpiy to those who were already prisoner; of war, 
and Lincoln made it clear that it was "not Fe these who 
may be constrained to take (the oath) in order to escape 
actual imprisonment or punishment." 
It is most misleading to confuse this tactical move by 
Lincoln to encourage enemy desertions with Lincoln's policy 
toward deserters from his own forces. The standard punish-
ment for desertion during the Civil War was death, and 
although Lincoln commuted many death sentences, many 
such sentences were carried out. As the war neared its end, 
on March 11, 1865, Lincoln issued a proclamation ()tiering 
a conditional pardon to deserters. The condition was that 
they return to their units and serve out their enlistment, add-
ing time for the period of their desertion. The proclamation 
stated that those who failed to turn themselves in or who 
fled to avoid the draft would be deemed "to have voluntarily 
relinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship" for-
ever. Lincoln clearly took a very firm stand toward deserters 
and draft evaders, a fact that has been badly obscured in 
much of the current discussion. 
Post readers might also be misled by Haynes Johnson's 
discussion of Truman's pardoning of some selective service 
violators after World War 11. Johnson says that Truman 
granted amnesty to 1523 violators, but he fails to say that 
When America later discovered that these policies had 
helped bring about Mao's absolute control of the mainland continuad 
and when they found that the communists were Stalinist 
totalitarians, not the democratic reformers described by Serv-
ice, there was strong criticism of Service's reports and policy 
recommendations. 
However, John Stewart Service would probably never have 
been fired on the basis of his misleading reporting alone. 
What got him into hot water was the fact that it was ound 
that in 1945 he wrongfully gave ponies of some 18 classified 
State Department documents to Philip Jane, the editor of 
Amerasia, a pro-communist publication. He has admitted this 
serious violation of security, and there is no doubt that it 
weighed heavily in the judgment of the Loyalty Review Board. 
The American Foreign Service Association does no credit 
to its own reputation when it honors Service and his col-
leagues wilhoiAPPreVellaftr Rev* ?gtoilVer CIA-RDP88-01315R000100040001-2

90 per cent of the selective service viceators whose c:3ses 
were considered by Truman's amnesty board were not par-
doned. Nor does he say that the pardons were not extended 
to deserters. None of those pardoned by Truman were ex-
cused because they sympathized with the Nazi cause and had 
moral scruples about fighting them. 
Mr. Johnson advocates that an amnesty board be estab-
lished "to determine those cases that merit pardon on 
grounds of moral objections to the war." These would not 
be persons who could qualify for conscientious objector 
status beeauso of opposition to all war, but persons who 
objected to this particular war. There is no precedent in 
Arnericail history (or probably the history of any country) 
for forgiving deserters and draft evaders for such a reason. 
TV Bias 
e Feb. 14, 1973 
SIR: By coincidence, George Will's article arguing that TV 
bias does not matter appeared in the Post at the same time 
as an article in TV Guide demonstrate.c1 that TV bias matters 
very much. 
Will contends that the networks are Indeed biased but 
lacking in power to influence public opinion. Therefore, we 
need not worry about the distorted view of the world that 
comes over the tube. 
TV Guide's article, "The Black Eye That Won't Go Away," 
shows that the city of Newburgh, N.Y. is still suffering today 
from the unfair negative image that it was given by an NBC 
documentary aired over ten years ago. The mayor of New-
burgh is quoted as blaming the difficulty experienced in 
attracting industry to his city on the unfavorable impression 
that was created by the NBC program. 
Was the NBC portrayal of Newburgh accurate and fair? 
The people of Newburgh don't think so. The local newspaper 
described the program as "a hatchet job on the city." It 
asked for an apology from NBC, but no apology was ever 
made. The TV Guide points out that because of the NBC 
documentary the local media are extremely distrustful of 
the national press, both print and broadcast. 
The Newburgh case is only one of many that could be 
cited to show that TV has a stronger influence on public 
opinion, for good and ill, than Mr. Will seems to believe. 
More TV Bias 
Feb. 15, 1973 
SIR: In a recent speech the president of NBC, Julian Good-
man, charged that "some Federal Government officials are 
waging a continuing campaign aimed at intimidating and 
discrediting the news media." Singling out an official who 
recently charged that there was bias in TV network news, 
Mr. Goodman said: "He did not say how we are biased." 
Accuracy in Media, Inc. has spelled out in detail many 
specific cases of TV network bias. Many of these involve 
NBC, and Mr. Goodman knows of them. He misleads the 
public when he implies that charges of bias are lacking in 
documentation. 
In the AIM REPORT for February 1973, we cite the fol-
lowing cases of bias in NBC News programs in recent 
months. 
1. An attack on private pension plans In America In a 
documentary called "Pensions: Tho Broken Promise." 
The program was very one-sided. 
2. An attack on private health care systems In a docu-
mentary called "What Price Health?" Another one-sided 
presentation. 
3. A documentary on San Francisco's famed Chinatown 
based entirely on the carping criticisms of two radical 
youths whose sympathies for Mao Tse-tung came 
through loud and clear. 
4. A documentary about the drug traffic In Southeast Asia 
transmitting the views of those who Wanted to portray 
America and its Southeast Asian' allies in a had light. 
At the same time, NBC did not report the testimony on 
the other side that was given by Marine General Lewis 
W. Walt before the Senate Internal Security Subcom-
mittee. 
It is not the government that Is 'discrediting the networks. 
The networks are discrediting themselves by their one-sided 
presentations of controversial issues of public importance. 
tlection Campaign Law Violations 
Feb. 19, 1973 
- on February 13, the Associated Press sent out a story 
siich Lie an this way: "The General Accounting Office re-
: ( i.clay that the campaign organization's of President 
na and Senator George McGovern failed to report within 
, r see.. a series of large contributions received in the last ' 
? ass af the 1972 Presidential campaign." The story pro-
? ? ?, it te say that no legal action was being recommended 
"neither the new law nor the regulations were suffi-
els explicit on these matters," according to the Comp-
.'. r General. . 
? Jiff report was a very accurate account of the GAO press 
aase on this subject. 
Washington Post carried a story about the GAO re-
,: ? under the headline: "GAO Says Nixon Funds Unit 
r led Spirit, Intent of Law." The headline was a summary 
e, lee Post's lead paragraph. It was not until the reader 
rated to the sixth paragraph of the Post story that he 
?*d that the GAO had "also reported apparent viola- ? 
? by the campaign organization" of Senator McGovern. 
; Post story then reverted to the Nixon campaign funds, 
ribing how large contributions had been divided among 
lees e rot's committees so that each amount would be under 
the $5000 floor for contributions that had to be reported 
feat :n 48 hours. Nothing was said about the fact that the 
e i.'e,evern campaign organization was reported by the GAO 
id have followed the same practice. 
'rim GAO criticized the Nixon committee for Its handling 
o' reeds totaling over Si million. It criticized the McGovern 
.comeeittee for its handling of funds totaling over $150,000. 
Is il_ehe difference in the amounts that justifies the differ-
(ace in the way the Post reported the criticism of the two 
committees? Does that wipe out the fact that the GAO criti-
cism was directed evenhandedly at both committees?

By REED J. IRVINE 
With criticism of inaccurate and biased news re-
porting mounting at a rapid rate, it is surprising that 
the news media have done almost nothing to remedy 
the faults that the customers are complaining about. 
The press and TV news departments are on the de-
fensive. Their thin skins show as they react with irri-
tation to well-intentioned criticism and with super-
cilious contempt to suggestions that there is a dem-
onstrated need for an independent media watchdog. 
In the fall of 1969 such a media watchdog made its 
appearance. Called Accuracy in Media, or simply 
AIM, it was a toothless puppy at the time, possess-
ing neither bark nor bite. In three short years, how-
ever, AIM has demonstrated that it is possible for 
ordinary concerned citizens to do something about 
the serious deficiencies in news reporting. The little 
pup has developed both bark and bite. 
This was demonstrated on Sept.. 17, 1972, when the 
American _Broadcasting Co. televised a statement 
admitting that several inaccurate statements had 
been made in an ABC documentary, "Arms and Se-
.curity: How Much is Enough?? 
ABC took time at the beginning of its popular 
Sunday afternoon program, "Issues and Answers," 
to correct the erroneous statements. It admitted that 
it had erred in saying that 60 per cent of the Ameri-
can tax dollar goes for defense, amending the figure 
to 40 per cent. It admitted that it had been incorrect 
? when it said that the President's blue ribbon defense 
panel had characterized our defense policies as suffi-
cient. It acknowledged that the panel. had not made 
such a judgment and that seven of the 16 members 
of the panel had signed a supplemental report which 
said that the strategic military balance was running 
against the United States.. 
ABC conceded that it had erred in saying that the 
American Security Council had criticized the blue 
ribbon defense panel, and informed its audience that 
r the Council had circulated the supplemental state-
ment to the panel's report. ABC also conceded error 
in saying that the 13-52 was a supersonic bomber. 
This amazing and unprecedented public admis-
sion by a TV network of serious errors in what 
? ? was supposed to have been a carefully. prepared 
documentary by its own staff was the result of the 
? 
efforts of Accuracy in Media and the American 
Security Council. 
AIM and the ASC both lodged strong protests 
with ABC about the factual inaccuracies in "Arms 
and Security: How Much is Enough?," and both 
scored the program for its lopsided presentation of 
the defense debAk2. It was heavily weighted in favor 
of the disarmarMIMW KgreigliglagictiAQ04411401 
documentary that I prepared was widely circulated 
hv thn ASC in its Washington Report. 
0100040001-2 
As a result, the president of ABC News, Elmer 
Lower, ordered that the corrections be made on the 
air. ABC notified both AIM and the ASC in ad-
vance that this would be done. A I M's executive sec-
retary, Abraham H. Kalish, immediately issued a 
statement to the press commending ABC for taking 
this corrective action, contrasting it with refusals 
by CBS and NBC to make public correction of 
errors pointed out by AIM. However, Mr. Kalish 
noted that the ABC program was faulty not only be-
cause of its factual errors but because of its lack 
of balance, which was contrary to the requii.ements 
of the fairness doctrine of the Federal Communica-
tions Commission. He said ABC still had an obliga-
tion to correct the imbalance by airing a program 
that would deal fairly with those who are concerned 
about the deterioration of our military defenses. 
Accuracy in Media had previously succeeded in 
getting some publications and broadcasters to cor-
rect errors. National Review, for example, has 
printed two out of three criticisms that AIM has 
made of errors found in its pages, and a fourth is yet 
to be disposed of. But the media giants, the television 
networks, the New York Times and the Washington 
Post have stubbornly refused to correct errors ? that 
AIM has heretofore called to their attention. After 
bombarding them with polite letters, documenting 
their mistakes, to no avail, AIM recently escalated 
its attack on media errors. 
On June 30, readers of the New York Times were 
startled by a two-column quarter-page ad with this 
bold headline: "CAN YOU TRUST THE NEW 
YORK TIMES?" The ad challenged the credibility 
of Anthony Lewis, a top staff writer for the Times. 
It showed that Lewis had printed false statements 
on the subject of Viet Nam, including a claim that 
North Viet Nam was successfully sweeping the mines 
in the port of Haiphong. This had been printed on the 
front page of the Times. The ad said that Lewis had 
previously declared his overriding commitment to 
bringing about an end to the Viet Nam war, and it 
suggested that his reporting was influenced by that 
commitment. 
The ad was the work of Accuracy in Media. Hav-
ing failed to get the Times to correct the Lewis errors, 
it laid out nearly $3,000 to buy the space in the Times 
to have the corrections made. It not only'set the 
record. straight, but the ad put readers of the paper 
on notice that Anthony Lewis was apt to let his anti-
Viet Nam emotions get the better of his journalistic 
duty to report the facts fully and accurately.

Washington, D. C. 20554 
On July 28, 1972, NBC presented in its Chronelog Series a documentary on 
? the narcotics traffic in Southeast Asia. 
We have analyzed this program and have concluded that it fails to meet the 
Fairness Doctrine requirement that the licensee provide a balanced presentation 
of all sides in programming that deals with controversial issues of public impor-
tance. We therefore wish to file a complaint of violation of the fairness doctrine 
against all NBC-owned and affiliated statiOns that carried the program. 
There appear to be three principal controversial issues involved in the NBC 
. documentary. ? 
1. The documentary dealtmith the question of whether or not America's allies 
in Southeast Asia--Thailand, Laos and Vietnam--are important sources of supply 
of heroin for the American. market. 
2. It discussed the charges that U 
in assisting those who are trafficking 
accusation that our Government has not

. S. Government agenciea have been involved. 
in narcotics in Southeast Asia and the 
been aggressive in fighting the traffic 
to hinder the war effort. 
3. It discussed charges that the Governments of Thailand, Vietnam and Laos 
are not cooperating adequately in combatting the narcotics traffic, charges that 
have led to legislative proposals that aid to these countries be terminated. 
Our analysis suggests that all of these issues were deliberately treated in 
a manner that was intended to lead the viewer to the conclusion that American 
allies in Southeast Asia were iirmortant sourees of heroin for the American 
market, that the governments of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam were not cooperating  
adeqaately in putting down the traffic and that U. S. agencies were themselves 
involved in supporting the traffic. 
Moreover, we find that NBC has managed to give support to these conclusions 
and to avoid presenting evidence that would lead to contrary conclusions by its 
news programming. For example, perhaps the largest amount of opium ever deliberately 
. destroyed was burned in Thailand on March 7, 1972 by the Thai Government. This 
event .was not reported on the NBC evening TV news program at that time. Never-

We submit that the suppression of news of General Walt's testimony and the

General Walt testified confirms!that one-sidedness has characterized the NBC 
discussion of the'narcotias traffic of Southeast Asia. The Chronolog program 
is part Of the same pattern. 
To make the point that ,Southeast Asia is an important Source of 'heroin for 
the U. S. market, NBC Chronologiquoted a "professional estimate" that one-
third of the heroin in our market came from Southeast Asia. Even Alfred McCoy 
thinks this is too high a figure. NBC did not put any other estimates before 
its vieviers, nor did it point out that until recently it is believed that 80 
per cent of our heroin came from Turkey. NBC did not point .out that Turkey had 
been a serious problem for several years and that it was only after long and 
difficult negotiations that we succeeded in persuading Turkey to make the cultivation 
.of opium poppies illegal.- By failing to give this broader background, NBC created 
the impression that Thailand, Laos and Cambodia were major 'problem suppliers and 
were particularly uncooperative in dealing with the traffic. The fact is that 
they have been nothing like Turkey as a problem source of supply, and they have 
all moved more rapidly than Turkey in making efforts to stamp out the traffic. 
NBC charged that the so-called "golden triangle" area produces 900 to 2700 tons 
of illicit opium a year. A recent government report puts illicit opium production 
in Burma, Thailand and Laos at 700 tons a year. This difference between NBC's esti-
mates and our official estimates was not mentioned, much less explained. 
By exaggerating the importance of Southeast Asia as a source of heroin supply. 
to the U. S. market, NBC misled its viewers about the significance of the fact that 
the United States has taken action only within recent years to get Southeast Asian 
governments to curb opium production and traffic. NBC promotes the view that the 
U. S.' officials were deliberately ignoring the problem because it would hurt the 
war effort to pressure the governments to ban opium. No one was presented on the 
program to point out that U. S. concern with opium in this area began as soon as 
it became known that heroin use by American troops in Vietnam was a serious problem. 
While -NBC permitted charges to be aired that the CIA and our military forces 
were involved in the narcotics traffic, it did not put on a .single government 
official to deny those charges. In a letter published in The Washington Star 
on July 5, 1972,.W. E. Colby, Ec.ec.utIve Director of the CIA, responded to similar

R00010(1040001-2. 
charges, denying them. NBC made no use of this stateiient by Mr. Colby nor of 
any similar statement by any of his colleagues. 
, NBC did discuss some of the progress that had beei made by Southeast Asian 
governments, but it minimized the achievements and emPhasized the failures. For 
example, in discussing the destruction of 26 tons of Opium by Thailand, opium. 
whose street value in heroin equivalent in the U. S. Would be in excess of $1 
billion, NBC dismissed this as little more than a public relations stunt. NBC 
permitted Mr. McCoy to make much of the fact that the IKMT Chinese in northern Burma 
were once supported by the CIA, implying that the CIAlis therefore responsible 
for everything they have done over the past 20 years. NBC did not mention that 
the 26 ions of opium destroyed in Thailand in March came 'from the KMT people and 
that they pledged to give up dope-running as part of the deal made with -che Thai 
government. Nor did NBC mention that the Thai Government was the first to enter 
Into an agreement with the United Nations to provide or compensation of farmers 
who give up opium cultivation. 
The issue of cutting off aid to Thailand because of the opium traffic is 
one that is currently agitating our Congress. NBC put on three congressmen, Wolff, 
Rangel and Steele who have taken a very hard line on this issue. NBC put not a 
single congressman on the program to represent the view that cutting off aid 
would not be desirable. There are, of course, many congressmen who take that 
point of view. They would point out, among other things, that we are getting 
far better cooperation from Thailand than we are from Burma, a country that 
we do not give aid to. 
Our timing of the various statements on the Chron.log program indicates 
that nearly four times as much time was given to those who, made statements 
critical of the Southeast Asian countries and the United States policies than 
to those who answered these criticisms and charges. BC's own statements were 
very heavily weighted on the side of the McCoy thesis 
Moreover; the program. gave a one-sided and misleading impression about the 
attitude of the communists toward production and distribution of narcotics. It 
suggested that the communists were hard on the producers and traffickers. It 
made no mention whatsoever of charges that have been Made about illicit opium 
being produced in North Vietnam and of illicit opium coming from Mainland China. 
The role of these countries In the drug traffic is ce tainly an issue of importance 
and controversy, and omission of it could be explaine as being motivated by the 
desire of NBC to focus criticism on the allies of the United States in Southeast 
Asia. 
In summary, we believe that NBC did not comply vi h the requirements of the 
fairness doctrine in discussing the nartotics traffic in Southeast Asia on 
July 28, 1912. Its powerful voice was lent to a camps gn that is underway to 
discredit the United States Government and its allies in Seutheast Asia, playing 
. upon the public's fear and hatred of heroin. The proc. am did not provide the 
viewers with balanced information that would enable tlem to weigh charges made 
by Alfred McCoy. Instead, the program was largely a, ehicle for the transmission 
of McCoy's ideas. This was supplemented by McCoy's a pearance on the Today show 
on July 14 and by the blackout or the testimony of Ge eral Wait on the same day.

AIM raised a number of questions about this program in a letter to NBC dated 
July.28, 1972. We have received a replY from NBC that is not at all responsitre 
to our request for comments. 
We request that you investigate the Chronolog program of July 28, 1972. .WA 
'feel that you will conclude as we have that NBC has not given adequate representa-
tion to the views of the CIA, the U. S. military, many members of Congress and 
to that substantial body of opinion which holds that both Communist China and 
North Vietnam are an important part of the Southeast Asian narcotics problem. 
We ask that you instruct the NBC-owned stations and the NBC affiliates that 
they have a duty to offset the one-sided presentation of the Chronolog program 
by appropriate programs, including interviews with such men as General Walt, 
who can .put the matter into perspective and tell the people what is being done.

Dear Mr. Prank: 
July 28, 
Mr. Reuve 
Presiden-
NBC News 
30 Rockefeller Plaza 
New, Yank, N. Y. 
001-2 
Accuracy in Media wishes to call to your attention a few apparently 
erroneous.etatements in the Chronolog program of July 20 on the narcotics 
traffic in Southeast Asia. 
Mr. Utley, the narrator, made the following statement. 
? , "CIA Went to' the publishing house of Harper & Row to get and to read 
the manuscript of McCoy's book before its publication date. And surprisingly 
Herper and Row acquiesced. It surrendered to the threat of prior censorship." 
A story on this matter was published in The New York Times on July 22. 
According to this story, CIA 'asked to have an opportunity to review the book 
because it believed that it contained statements concerning the agency that were 
totally false and without foundation. The CIA letter' to Harper and Row stated: 
"It is our belief that no reputable publishing house would wish to publish such alle-
gations withouebeing assured that the supporting evidence was valid." 
B.' Brooks Thomas, vice president and general counsel of Harper and Row, said: 
"We're not'cubmitting to censorship or anything like that. We're taking a responsible 
middle position. I just believe, that the CIA should have the chance to review it." 
I am sure teat it is known at NBC that manuscripts being considered by 
reputable publishers are always submitted to experts for review prior to publication. 
One of the big mistakes McGraw-Hill made with the Irving book on Howard Hughes was 
that it did. not take the precaution of having the book read by people who were 
sufficiently. knowledgeable about the subject of the book. Of course, a publisher 
is free to accept or reject the suggestion .ade by the reviewers. We think it 
would be irresponsible for a publisher to ignore warninip that a manuscript contained 
serious inaccuracies and to refuse to permit those able to point out the inaccuracies 
to.havo.an opportunity to do so prior to publication. By taking every precaution. 
to insure' accuracy, the publisher helps establish his own credibility, the credibilit 
of the book, and he avoids increasing the amount of misinformation that circulates 
in public channels. We do not. think this has any connection with censorship, which 
connotea Legal compulsion to prevent statements from being published. Since CIA has 
no legal power to prevent Harper and Raw from publishing anything, Mr. Utley' eharg

We raise a question concerning the 
reports of  
Anthony Lewis, one of the 
top writers of The New York Times. 
Mr. Lewis' words speak for themselves. 
"Haiphong, May 17_The North 
Vietnamese say they are clearing 
American mines from the Haiphong 
harbor as planes drop them, and 
moving ships in and out. Independ-
ent sources give supPort 10 that 
claim." Lewis, The Times, May 18. 
[Emphasis added. This report was 
carried on the front page of The 
Times even though Administration 
officials had informed the paper that 
it was false. Their denial was in-
cluded in the story.] 
"The only way to be certain (about 
the minesweeping) would be ex 
tended investigation or observation 
of the harbor, which the North Viet-
namese would not allow. So the 
claim could be mere bravado." 
Lewis, The Times, May 20. 
3. "The consensus of foreign observers 
? here (Hanoi) now is that American 
mining has effectiVely closed North Ardent advocacy which leads to mis-
Vietnam ports." Lewis, The.I'intes, leading reporting should not be tolerated

to have given it support.

A clue to the ans\ el. 
in this passage from Lewis' May 13 
column: 
? 
"This issue (stopping the war) is 
now paramount. It conies before other 
obligations, before personal ambition 
or comfort. For the ordinary citizen 
that means participation in some form 
of political expression, howo cr incon-
venient . . . involving one's professional 
association, school or other activity in 
the attempt to stop the war." 
We believe that Mr. Lewis has en-
listed in a crusade. We believe that he 
feels his obligation to the crusade comes 
before his. obligation to report the news 
accurately and objectively. 
This might explain why Lewis told 
the readers of The Times on April 10 
that the United States had never offered 
total withdrawal of troops from Vietnam 
in return for the POW's, "even in the 
secret talks." The fact is that President 
Nixon *revealed that the United States 
had offered to agree to a deadline for 
withdrawal of all American forces in ex-
change for the release of all prisoners of 
war and a ceasefire in the secret talks in 
his televised address of January 25. The 
President said North Vietnam had re-
jected the offer, continuing "to insist 
that we overthrow the South Vietnamese 
GOAT rnment."

AN OPEN LETTER 
March 17, 1972 
Thank you for sending the material on Media Probe. We had heard of this organization 
but had not seen any of its literature until we received your letter and enclosures. You 
ask a very pertinent question, Is one of you a phoney"? 
We have examined the names on the letterhead of the Media Probe stationery. They 
belong to men of good reputation, and we are sending copies of this letter to them as well 
as to other individuals who might be interested. 
We note that Media Probe is asking the public for $80,000 to-be used to finance future 
activities. It asks this even though it has no record of actual performance. Accuracy in 
Media, on the other hand, already has a widely recognized record of achievement. We have 
carried on extensive correspondence with the top officials in the news media, pointing out 
errors and seeking corrections. We have already made ten studies of significant news media 
issues. Most of these have been placed into the Congressional Record, with highly complimen-
tary introductions by various Congressmen from both parties. Examine the back of this letter 
which lists the principal AIM releases and reprints. Other studies are in process. 
Articles about Accuracy in Media have been published by Editor and Publisher, Seminar, 
The UPI, Washington Star, Columbia University Journalism Review, Barron's and by nationally 
syndicated columnists. AIM officers have appeared on TV and radio discussion programs. 
CBS, Newsweek, the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times have investigated AIM, 
but have not to date published anything about us. We feel sure that they would have hurried 
to do so had they discovered anything "phoney" about Accuracy in Media. 
AIM has two cases now pending before the FCC, charging violations of the Fairness 
Doctrine. We are preparing a third complaint. The Ervin Committee has promised to print 
AIM's statement to the Committee, in its final report. We expect to be invited to testify 
on the Fairness Doctrine in a coming FCC hearing. We have also placed two paid advertise-
ments in the Washington Post in order to expose an error by a prominent TV commentator. 
We send all our releases free of charge to 300 leading news media. The cost of this 
has been met by 240 individuals who to date have sent us $10 each for annual subscriptions. 
The same people have also donated an average of $15 each. We are financially solvent because 
tens of thousands of dollars worth of time and talent in research, writing and many other 
tasks have been contributed free by individuals who know that without truth in our communi-
cation media, our democracy will perish. 
If you have any further questions, please let me know. 
Sincerely,

EDITORIAL COMMENTARY 
"Pentagon" Revisited 
CBS Is Still Doing Business at the Same Old Stand 
ACCURACY in Media (Warner 
Bldg., Washington, D.C., 20004) 
is a non-profit, tax-exempt organiza-
tion launched a few years ago "by a 
group of concerned citizens who had 
become increasingly fearful that the 
content and presentation of the news 
by many sections of the media were 
undermining the democratic process 
and threatening our freedom." 
A.T.M. boasts a National Advisory 
Board comprising such prestigious 
figures as Morris L. Ernst, Eugene 
Lyons and Edgar Ansel Mowrer. In 
pursuit of its goal (which is aptly de-
scribed by its name), A.I.M. since 
its inception has issued perhaps two 
dozen "critiques, articles, editorial 
replies, bulletins, reports and news 
releases", as well as filed several 
complaints with the Federal Com-
munications Commissioh charging 
violation of the Fairness Doctrine. 
Letting the chips fall where they 
may?a warm reference to its activ-
ities in the March 29, 1971, issue of 
Barron's evoked a courteous re-
sponse and a correction of two fac-
tual errors?A.I.M. has not blinked 
at taking on some of the leading 
lights of the liberal establishment. 
* * * 
Perhaps its chief claim to fame 
has been its confrontations with the 
Columbia Broadcasting System. 
Taking dead aim in 1970 at one of 
CBS' famous "documentaries," 
dealing with Castro's Cuba, Accu-
racy in Media listed 10 major doubt-
ful statements, including: "For 
Cuba's poor, things are a good deal 
better than they used to be. . . the 
Cuban poor man doesn't want to 
leave. . . there is a quiet equality of 
the races now. . ." Noting in metic-
ulous detail that real life refuses to 
follow the script, A.I.M. solicited 
comment from Richard S. Salant, 
then and now president of CBS 
News. Nine times out of 10, in the or-
ganization's view, his answers failed 
to meet the objections. Painfully 
aware of the mounting national in-
terest in his network's efforts, Mr. 
Salant lately has grown more re-
sponsive. Thus, the CBS point-by-
point defense of its controversial 
program, "The Selling of the Penta-
gon," which finally surfaced in mid-
December, nine months after its 
promised appearance, addresses it-
self?albeit inadequately, in the 
main?to 13 of the 23 issues raised 
by A.I.M. and a host of other critics. 
Again, in its eagerness to refute the 
devastating proof of network bias 
which emerges from the recent 
best-selling book, "The News Twist-
ers," by Edith Efron of TV Guide, 
CBS hastened to release a rebuttal 
on the day of publication. 
Lesser communications media, 
as we have observed before, occa-
sionally run a correction or retrac-
tion, but CBS is made of sterner 
stuff. "We are proud of `The Selling 
of the Pentagon'," Mr. Salant told a 
nationwide television audience a 
year ago. "We are confident that 
when passions die down, it will be 
recognized as a vital contribution to 
the people's right to know." Recog-
nition?in the form of the George 
Foster Peabody, Saturday Review 
and National Academy of Television 
Arts and Sciences awards for distin-
guished journalism?followed with 
almost indecent speed. Nor has CBS 
lacked for support?notably from a 
professor of sociology at City Uni-
versity of New York and a vice pres-
ident of United Press International 
?with respect to the "News Twist-
ers." 
Yet on both occasions, so the 
facts suggest and the critics affirm, 
the network has staged a really poor 
show. Thus, while professing contin-
ued pride in its brainchild, CBS, by 
A.I.M. count, "actually concedes 
that five points of criticism are to 
some extent justified . . . and 
makes de facto admission of error in 
two other cases." As for Miss Ef-
ron's best-seller, professional statis-
ticians have defended her methods 
and endorsed her findings. On even 
a casual inspection?and the author 
has prepared an 87-page report, as 
she testified recently before the Sen-
ate Subcommittee on Constitutional 
Rights, "in which I identify every 
misrepresentation; restore every vi-
olated context; present the stories 
CBS sought to conceal"?the CBS 
"spot-check" plainly fits her de-
scription of a "carefully calculated 
smear" and "fraud." Last summer, 
the House Interstate and Commerce 
Committee voted to cite CBS for 
contempt of Congress (the full 
House killed the move). Evidently 
CBS' real contempt is for truth. 
Regarding the controversial doc-
umentary, CBS explains that "deci-
sions were made by intelligent, con-
scientious journalists applying the 
best professional judgment with the 
intent only to condense and focus a 
vast amount of material . . . no one 
has refuted its basic veracity." Ac-
curacy in Media?and Barron's?
disagree. As A.I.M. points out, "CBS 
now actually concedes that five 
points of criticism were to some ex-
tent justified. It admits that the edit-
ing of one of the answers Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Henkin gave to 
a CBS question might not have con-
veyed accurately what Mr. Henkin 
actually said. CBS also admits that 
it was wrong in saying of defoliated 
areas that 'nothing will grow there 
any more.' It agrees that it should 
have mentioned that one of the Pen-
tagon films it criticized was actually 
produced by CBS. CBS also con-
cedes that it greatly exaggerated 
the number of offices in the Penta-
gon, and allows that it should not 
have used language that implied

that it had to track down the indus-
trial War College team that was put-
ting on a National Security Seminar 
in Peoria, Ill. 
"In addition, CBS makes de facto 
admissions of error in two other 
cases. In the broadcast, CBS had 
said that a still unpublished report 
of the prestigious 20th Century Fund 
had estimated real total spending by 
the Defense Department on public 
affairs at $190 million, compared 
with the budget figure of $30 million. 
CBS now concedes that the report of 
the 20th Century Fund had been pub-
lished at the time the broadcast was 
made and that it contained no such 
figure. CBS tries to wriggle out of 
this embarrassing situation by 
showing that such a figure was used 
in some of the research done for the 
study. However, it was also clear 
that the figure was not used in the 
published study precisely because it 
could not be verified and the 20th 
Century Fund quite properly would 
not accept it as valid. CBS was 
therefore both wrong and unethical 
in foisting such a figure on its unsus-
pecting audience and using the pres-
tige of the 20th Century Fund to au-
thenticate it." 
Accuracy in Media proceeded to 
dissect the reply made by CBS to 
eleven other points of criticism, in-
cluding "the editing of the remarks 
of Col. John MacNeil, which in-
volved creating a synthetic state-
ment from widely separated sen-
tences in his speech; the circum-
stances surrounding the appearance 
of the Industrial War College lecture 
team in Peoria, Ill., especially 
whether or not the visit was ar-
ranged by Caterpillar Tractor Co. 
(Ed. note: "which," according to 
the broadcast, "did $39 million 
worth of business with the Defense 
Department last year"), charges 
that CBS selectively edited films of 
press briefings in Washington and 
Saigon to make the spokesmen ap-
pear unresponsive to newsmen's 
questions; charges that CBS gave a 
wrong impression in saying that the 
U.S. had resumed bombing in North 
Vietnam." In A.I.M.'s judgment: 
"CBS refuses to admit that there 
was merit to any of these charges, 
but in every case its refutation is 
weak and unconvincing." 
By deed, if not word, CBS in ef-
fect has conceded the point. In strik-
ing contrast to the publicity splash 
which accompanied Mr. Salant's 
television debut last March, the 
company's point-by-point rebuttal 
was quietly inserted into the Con-
gressional Record toward Christ-
mastime by Rep. Ogden R. Reid 
(R., N.Y.), allegedly at the behest of 
the head of the Radio Television 
News Directors Association. Last 
June, moreover, CBS, in reviewing 
its "operating Standards for News 
and Public Affairs," specifically 
outlawed most of the dubious prac-
tices in which those responsible for 
"the Selling of the Pentagon" had 
indulged. 
The rank-and-file at CBS now 
may have gotten the word?verac-
ity. However, to judge by the corpo-
rate response to "The New Twist-
ers," there's plenty of room for im-
provement at the top. To dernOn-
strate the pervasive political bias of 
all three networks, Miss Efron se-
lected 13 controversial issues "on 
which strong opposing positions 
were taken by the Republican-con-
servative-right axis and by the Dem-
ocratic-liberal-left axis." Then, with 
the help of The Historical Research 
Foundation' she tape-recorded and 
transcribed the prime-time (7-7:30 
p.m.) news broadcasts of all three 
networks for the seven weeks ended 
November 4, 1968. She isolated all 
stories dealing with the chosen is-
sues, excerpted all stands "for" and 
"against," and, in each case, tallied 
and totaled the number of words. 
What she found ought to open the 
country's eyes. On all three net-
works, the number of words spoken 
against Richard M. Nixon far ex-
ceeded those spoken for him, some-
times by a margin of 10-to-1. On 
such issues as the bombing halt or 
U.S. policy in Vietnam, broadcast 
sentiment, as expressed in wordage 
for and against, was equally one-
sided. 
In a press release last October, 
Richard S. Salant of CBS News of-
fered another rebuttal, in which he 
charged Miss Efron with "distinct 
bias and gross distortion," as well 
as "using statistical procedures 
which are seriously flawed." Mr. 
Salant went on: "With full recogni-
tion of its responsibility to be fair 
and 9bjective, CBS News has re-
tained two highly qualified, experi-
enced, independent research 
organizations, one to study 
the methodology used by 
Miss Efron and the other to 
review the identical 1968 
campaign coverage on which 
her book reports. They will 
advise us of their conclu-
sions when these studies 
have been completed, and

it was wrong in saying of defoliated 
areas that 'nothing will grow there 
arny more.' It agrees that it should 
have mentioned that one of the Pen-
tagon films it criticized was actually 
produced by CBS. CBS also con-
cedes that it greatly exaggerated 
the number of offices in the Penta-

have used language that implied 
that it had to track down the Indus-

"In addition, CBS makes de facto

said that a still unpublished report 
of the prestigious 20th Century Fund 
had estimated real total spending by 
the Defense Department on public 
affairs at 8190 million, compared 
with the budget figure of $30 million. 
CBS now concedes that the report of 
the 20th Century Fund had been pub-

made and that it contained no such 
figure. CBS tries to wriggle out of

company's point-by-point rebuttal, 
was quietly inserted into the Con-

the head of the Radio Television

were taken by the Republican-con-
servative-right axis and by the Dem-
fered another rebuttal, in which he 
charged Miss Efron with "distinct 
bias and gross distortion," as well 
as "using statistical procedures 
which are seriously flawed." Mr. 
Salant went on: "With full recogni-
tion of its responsibility to be fair 
and objective, CBS News has re-

organizations, one to study 
the methodology used by

No. 20 
CBS DIGS DEEPER HOLE 
HON. F. EDWARD HEBERT 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE.OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 16, 1972 
Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been 
nearly a year since the nostrils of Amer-
ica's television audience were choked 
with the stinch of the irresponsible, poli-
tically carious presentation disguised by 
the title, "The Selling of the Pentagon." 
The odor has never faded as is wit-
nessed by the most recent analysis pub-
lished by Accuracy in Media, an inde-
pendent organization which will not let 
the truth die. 
And after 1 year of squeamish, pusil-
lanimous explanations by the Columbia 
Broadcasting System, the truth con-
tinues to emerge. The following speaks 
for itself: 
[From AIM Bulletin, Feb. 1, 19721 
CBS REPLIES TO CRITICS' QUESTIONS ABOUT 
"THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON" 
February 23 will mark the anniversary of 
the first showing of the CBS controversial 
documentary, "The Selling of the Pentagon." 
Claude Witze of the Air ForcerTeUial , Con-
gressman F. Edward Hebert, Chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, and Ac-
curacy in Media were among the severest crit-
ics of this program. On March 20, 1971, AIM 
sent a 7-page letter to Richard S. Salant, 
President of CBS News, asking for his com-
ment on many inaccuracies or, questionable 
points in the documentary. In our letter to 
Mr. Salant, we said that we agreed with 
a statement made by Roger Mudd in the 
broadcast, which said: "Nothing is more es-
sential to a democracy than the free flow of 
information. Misinformation, distortion. 
propaganda all interrupt that flow." AIM 
said that "The Selling of the Pentagon" con-
tained a great deal of misinformation and 
distortion. We wanted CBS to clear up the 
disputed points as quickly as possible. 
CBS PROMISES COMPREHENSIVE REPLY 
On March 29, 1971, Mr. Salant replied to 
AIM saying that he had decided to wait for 
the myriad of complaints and charges to ac-
cumulate and then prepare a comprehen-
sive analysis. He said: "When this analysis 
is completed and at such time as we deter-
mine tts release Is appropriate, I will include 
you on our distribution list." 
Many months passed and no reply to the 
questions was forthcoming. AIM raised this 
with CBS from time to time. We urged our 
Supporters to write to CBS to prod them into 
releasing the promised analysis. Finally, in 
December 1971, CBS informed us that we 
could find the long-awaited analysis in the 
Congressional Record for December 15 and 
December 17, beginning on pages E 13493 
and E 13697. There was no press release, no 
announcement that CBS had met its critics 
head-on and had shown them to be wrong. 
No copy of the reply was sent to the principal 
critics. We all had to look it up in the Con-
gressional Record, where it had been inserted 
by Congressman Ogden Reid, who said he 
obtained it from the president of the Radio-
Television News Directors Association. The 
press has completely overlooked this latest 
word in the great controversy over the CBS 
documentary. It appeared that that was pre-
cisely what CBS wanted. The less publicity 
the better. 
CBS ADMITS A FEW ERRORS 
CBS does not claim to be infallible, but 
AIM's experience is that it will rarely admit 
an error. Mr. Salant appeared on TV on the 
night of March 23, 1971, to reply to the critics 
of "The Selling of the Pentagon." He said: 
"We are proud of 'The Selling of the Penta-
gon' and CBS News stands behind it." He 
said they could refute every charge of the 
critics who had appeared on the air?Cong. 
Hebert, Secretary Laird and Vice President 
Agnew. Nine months later, in the statement 
quietly slipped into the Congressional Record 
CBS admitted that not all of the criticisms 
could be refuted. For CBS that wiz quite an 
admission. That was why they sought no 
publicity for their statement, we believe. 
CBS now actually concedes that five points 
of criticism were to some extent justified. It 
admits that the editing of one of the answers 
Assistant Secretary of Defense Henkin gave 
to a CBS question might not have conveyed 
accurately what Mr. Henkin actually said. 
CBS also admits that it was wrong in saying 
of defoliated areas that "nothing will grow 
there any more." It agrees that it should 
have mentioned that one of the Pentagon 
films it criticized was actually produced by 
CBS. CBS also concedes that it greatly ex-
aggerated the number of offices in the Penta-
gon, and allows that it should not have used 
language that implied that it had to track 
down the Industrial War College team that 
Was putting on a National Security Seminar 
in Peoria, Illinois. 
In addition to these admissions of error, 
CBS makes de facto admissions of error in 
two other Oases. In the broadcast, CBS had 
said that a still unpublished report of the 
prestigious 20th Century Fund had estimated 
real total spending by the Defense Depart-
ment on public affairs at $190 million, com-
pared with the budget figure of $30 million. 
CBS now concedes that the report of the 
20th Century Fund had been published at 
the time the broadcast was made and that 
it contained no such figure. CBS tries to wrig-
gle out of this embarrassing situation by 
showing that such a figure was used in some 
of the research done for the study. However 
It was also clear that the figure was not used 
in the published study precisely because it 
could not be verified and the 20th Century 
Fund quite properly would not accept it as 
valid. CBS was therefore both wrong and 
unethical in foisting off such a figure on its 
unsuspecting audience and using the pres-
tige of the 20th Century Fund to authenti-
cate it. 
The second de facto admission of error 
relates to the CBS charge that Pentagon ex-
penditures on public affairs in 1971 were ten 
times the 1959 level. CBS now admits that the 
1959 figure for public affairs expenditures was 
not comparable to the 1971 figure because 
different definitions for "public affairs ex-
penditures" were used in these two years. 
ARE THE ADMITTED ERRORS SERIOUS? 
Yes. Three of them are quite serious. The 
improper editing of the Henkin interview, 
which CBS now concedes, was one of the ob-
jects of the heaviest attacks of the critics of 
the documentary. For example, Martin Mayer 
In the December 1971 issue of Harpers maga-
zine said this about the editing of the Henkin 
interview: "This episode shows at least sub-
conscious malice, a desire by the producers 
of the program that the man in charge of 
the Pentagon selling apparatus look bad on 
the home screen." Reed J. Irvine, writing in 
the August 10, 1971 issue of National Review, 
said that in editing the Henkin interview, 
CBS did more than make Mr. Henkin look 
bad. He stated in his reply to one of CBS's 
questions his justification for spending pub-
lic money to inform the public of the reasons 
why we need national defense. Since CBs was 
clearly out to prove that such expenditures 
were wasteful, the mangling of the Henkin 
interview was necessary to make sure the 
viewers were not provided with any effective 
counter-arguments to the point CBS wanted 
to make. 
CBS, of course, does no go very far in ad-
mitting that it might have done better by 
Mr. Henkin. Discussing the transposition of 
answers that Mr. Henkin gave to incorpo-
rate them as parts of answers of different 
questions, CBS says: "Upon review, one 
might judge that a fuller answer could have 
been broadcast by including, in the compo-
site answer, the second sentence of the 'orig-
inal' answer . . ." CBS concedes that edit-
ing involves subjective judgments and that 
others may disagree with the judgments of 
CBS. It insists, however, that in editing the 
Henkin interview its intent was to condense 
and clarify, not to deceive. The admission 
that it might have done better by Mr. Hen-
kin is limited and grudging, but it is a step 
forward from the previous insistence by CBS 
President Frank Stanton that the editing 
was completely fair. 
The two errors cited above relating to the 
amount of money the Department of Defense 
spends on public affairs are serious because 
in the documentary CBS placed a great deal 
'of emphasis on the amount of money being 
spent on these activities. It used the false 
$190 million figure in comparison with the 
combined news budgets of the three com-
mercial television networks, showing a graph 
on the TV screen that told the viewer that 
the Department of Defense spent more to tell 
Its story to the people than all three net-
works spent to bring them the news. The 
exaggeration of the size of the Pentagon 
expenditures at the beginning of the pro-
gram helped establish the important nature 
of the subject of the documentary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD?Extensions of Remarks February 16, 19 72 
The other three admitted errors are sig-
nificant in that they cast light on the bias 
and carelessness of CBS. The bias is clearly 
shown in the incorrect description of the 
results of defoliation in Vietnam. The truth 
could easily have been ascertained by CBS, 
but it would not have been so dramatic. The 
exaggeration of the number of offices in the 
Pentagon by a factor of 6 shows the same 
kind of bias, as does the implication that 
CBS had to "find" the Industrial War Col-
lege lecturers. The criticism of the film, 
"Road to the Wall," would have been blunted 
If CBS had correctly attributed its produc-
tion to CBS rather than to the Pentagon. 
THE ERRORS CBS REFUSES TO ADMIT 
The purpose of the CBS reply is not to ad-
mit and apologize for errors in The Selling of 
the Pentagon, although that is grudgingly 
done in a few cases. Rather, CBS set out to 
show that the critics, not CBS, had erred. 
Thus the reply is mainly an effort to rebut 
the numerous criticisms made of the docu-
mentary. In addition to the points already 
discussed, the CBS reply takes up the fol-
lowing criticisms: 
(1) The editing of the remarks of Col. 
John MacNeil, which involved creating a syn-
thetic statement from widely separated sen-
tences in his speech; 
(2) The circumstances surrounding the 
appearance of the Industrial War College lec-
ture team -In Peoria, Ill., especially whether. 
or not the visit was arranged by Caterpillar 
Tractor Co.; 
(3) Whether or not the IWC lecturers vio-
lated regulations in discussing foreign policy; 
(4) The accuracy of the statement that the 
Pentagon "used" sympathetic Congressmen 
to interview military heroes such as Maj. 
James Rowe to counter anti-war reporting; 
(6) The charge -that CBS used false pre-
tenses to obtain a tape of the interview of 
Maj. Rowe by Congressman Hebert; 
(6) The charge that CBS falsely suggested 
that the Pentagon spent about $12 million 
a year on films to be shown to the public; 
(7) The charge that CBS gave a mislead-
ing impression about a film narrated by 
Robert Stack; 
(8) The charge that CBS implied that an 
expensive war game was staged for the bene-
fit of a few VIP civilians; 
(9) Charges that CBS selectively edited a 
film of a press briefing by Jerry Friedheim to 
make it appear that he was unresponsive to 
newsmen's questions; 
(10) ditto for a Saigon news briefing; and 
(11) Charges that CBS gave a wrong im-
pression in saying that the U.S. had resumed 
bombing of North Vietnam. 
CBS refuses to admit that there was merit 
to any of these charges, but in every case its 
refutation is weak and unconvincing. 
(1) CBS justifies creating a synthetic 
statement and putting it the mouth of Col. 
John MacNeil on the ground that each of the 
sentences used was actually said by Col. Mac-
Neil and their meaning was not altered. It 
admits that one of the sentences was taken 
out of chronological order, but it does not 
mention that this is contrary to the CBS 
Operating Standards for News and Public 
Affairs, which state that this kind of trans-
position must not be done without inform-
ing the audience. This rule was adopted in 
June 1971, after the controversy about The 
Selling of the Pentagon. But if CBS says that 
there was nothing wrong with this kind of 
transposition in The Selling of the Pentagon, 
we wonder how seriously CBS intends to en-
force its new regulation. 
The same point can be made about the 
editing of the Henkin interview, which also 
involved clear violations of the rules against 
the transposing of answers to questions with-
out giving an indication of this to the au-
dience. In its discussion of the editing of the 
Henkin interview, CBS makes no mention of 
the fact that the editing was clearly contrary 
to the rules later adopted. 
These are the most obvious criticisms to 
be made of the CBS defense of its editing of 
the MacNeil speech and the Henkin inter-
view. OBS is actually dishonest in suggesting 
that there was no significance to the fact 
that it took a sentence out of proper chron-
ological order to begin the synthetic state-
ment it created for Col. MacNeil. The sen-
tence was: "Well, now we're coming to the 
heart of the problem, Vietnam." This was. 
then followed by a statement the colonel had 
made about Thailand and two sentences that 
he had quoted from the Premier of Laos con-
cerning Southeast Asia. The latter two sen-
tences were taken so completely out of con-
text that they were not shown as quotations 
at all in the CBS synthetic statement. 
Why was it necessary to introduce state-
ments about Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and 
other Southeast Asian countries with the 
statement on Vietnam which CBS took out 
of its proper order? CBS did this for the very 
good reason that it wanted to lead into Col. 
MacNeil's synthetic statement with this: 
"The Army has a regulation stating: Per-
sonnel should not speak on the foreign policy 
implications of U.S. involvement in Viet-
nam." It would appear that CBS wanted to 
create the impression that Col. MacNeil was 
speaking in violation of that regulation. The 
easiest way to do this was to lead off the 
synthetic statement created for him with a 
sentence taken out of order. CBS seems not 
to understand the meaning and importance 
of context. If it can still say that what it did 
to Col. MacNeil's statement was fair editing, 
then no one's words are safe with CBS. 
(2) CBS described the National Security 
Seminar given by the Industrial War College 
In Peoria, Ill., this way: "The Pentagon has 
a team of colonels touring the country to 
lecture on foreign policy. We found them in 
Peoria, Ill., where they were invited to'speak 
to a mixed audience of civilians and military 
reservists. The invitation was arranged by 
Peoria's Caterpillar Tractor Co., which did 
$39 million of business last year with the 
Defense Department." 
Every one of these sentences was chal-
lenged by the critics. The team did not come 
;rom the Pentagon, but from the Industrial 
War College. In addition to colonels, it in-
eluded a Navy captain and a State Depart-
ment civilian. The seminars cover 33 topics, 
including foreign policy, and they are given 
each year in seven locations throughout the 
country, primarily for the benefit of military 
reservists. They were invited to Peoria by the 
Association of Commerce of Peoria, which 
shared sponsorship with the 9th Naval Dis-
trict. 
CBS, in a lame rejoinder, justifies its 
phrase, "a team of colonels," by asserting 
that the Navy captain is equivalent to a 
colonel and the State Department civilian 
was a reserve It. colonel, It does not explain 
why it called this a "Pentagon" team rather 
than identifying the responsibility of the 
Industrial War College (Industrial College 
of the Armed Forces), but it justifies the mis-
leading term by saying that the military 
officers are all subject to the authority of the 
Pentagon. It admits that it should not have 
said it "found" them in Peoria. It admits that 
the team lectures on many subjects other 
than foreign policy, but it defends the mis-
leading statement by saying that the broad-
cast did not say the team lectured only on 
foreign policy. Presumably if the listeners 
inferred that, that was their mistake. 
CBS says it was justified in saying that 
Caterpillar arranged the invitation, because 
an official of Caterpillar was co-chairman of 
the committee that arranged the seminar and 
they were told that he and his associates were 
very helpful "in heading up the committee 
and making all the necessary arrangements." 
OBS would apparently have us believe that 
anything an employee of a company does, in-
cluding civic activities, can be attributed to 
the firm that employs him. 
(3) CBS accused the lecturers for the In-
dustrial College of the Armed Forces of vio-
lating military regulations in discussing for-
eign policy implications of Vietnam. It was 
criticized for not pointing out that the talks 
given by these speakers had been cleared 
not only by Defense but by the State Depart-
ment. The Assistant Secretary of Defense 
says this is all the regulations require. CBS 
Insists that the talks violated regulations, no 
matter who cleared them. Since national de-
fense and foreign policy are frequently inter-
twined, it would seem clear that the Depart-
ments of Defense and State are in a better 
position than CBS to determine whether or 
not a speech runs counter to government 
regulations and policy. 
(4) CBS was charged with having falsely 
suggested that friendly Congressmen, spe-
cifically Cong. F. Edward Hebert, had been 
"used" by the Pentagon in broadcasting in-
terviews that they had made with Maj. James 
Rowe. This was vigorously denied by Cong. 
Hebert, who denied that the interview with 
Maj. Rowe. was produced at the suggestion 
of the Pentagon or that the broadcast to his 
home district involved the ?use of Pentagon 
funds. This could easily have been the infer-
ence drawn by those who heard the CBS 
statement. CBS says the program did not say 
that the Pentagon produced the Hebert-Rowe 
interview or that it was the Pentagon's idea. 
However, it undermines this denial by 
stressing that Cong. Hebert thanked the 
colonel who served as liaison with the House 
Armed Services Commitee for bringing Maj. 
Rowe to him. They do not seem to consider 
that Cong. Hebert might have asked the 
colonel to bring Maj. Rowe, who was famous 
for surviving five years of captivity as a VC 
prisoner and who successfully escaped, to see 
him. While denying that it meant to imply 
What it implied, CBS persists in conveying 
the same unfair implication. 
(5) Cong. Hebert charged that CBS ob-
tained the tape of his interview with Maj. 
Rowe by telling his office that It wanted it 
in connection with a documentary it was 
doing on prisoners of war. CBS denies this, 
saying that it was public knowledge that it 
was doing a documentary on public infor-
mation activities of the Department of De-
fense at the time it obtained the Hebert tape. 
CBS asserts that no one on its staff ever 
represented that the tape it wanted from 
Cong Hebert was to be used for a POW 
documentary. 
On the contrary, says CBS, they said they 
wanted the film in connection with a docu-
mentary on Pentagon public relations ac-
tivities. This is flatly contradicted by Cong. 
Robert's press secretary and by the Congress-
man. Congresman Hebert has put into the 
record letters or memos from the offices of 
five other congressmen who assert that they 
were approached by the same CBS staffers 
who approached Congresman Hebert's office 
to obtain tapes of interviews with Maj. Rowe. 
Four of them said they were told that CBS 
wanted these tapes in connection with a 
documentary it was doing on POW's. CBS 
makes no mention of this evidence confirm-
ing Cong. Hebert's charge that the CBS staff 
sought tapes of interviews between congress-
men and Maj. Rowe under the pretense that 
they were working on a documentary on 
POW's. In a delightful evasion, CBS says: 
"Months after the Rowe-Hebert program 
was delivered to M. Seabrooks, Mr. Branon 
contacted Mr. rlabert's office and the offices 
of other Representatives to obtain informa-
tion with respect to additional Congressional 
interviews with Major Rowe and other mili-
tary personnel, including other former pris-
oners of war. It is at this point, seemingly,

POUT of them said they were told that CBS 
wanted these tapes in connection with a

makes no mention of this evidence confirm-
ing Cong. liebert's charge that the CBS staff 
sought tapes of interviews between congress-
men and Maj. Rowe under the pretense that 
they were working 'on a documentary on 
POW's. In a delightful evasion, CBS says: 
"Months after the Rowe-Hebert program 
was delivered to Mr. Seabrooks, Mr. Branon 
contacted Mr. Hebert's office and the offices 
of other Representatives to obtain informa 
tion with respect to additional Congressional 
interviews with Major Rowe and other mili-
tary personnel, including other former pris-
oners of war. It Is at this point, seemingly, 
that the confusion began. The focus on addi-
tional Rowe interviews and other POW inter-
views may well have been the genesis of the 
misunderstanding which arose." 
We are expected to believe that five Con-
gressional offices all got the impression that 
CBS wanted these tapes in connection with 
a documentary on POW's even though they 
were all presumably told that CBS wanted 
them in connection with a documentary on 
Defense Department public relations activi-
ties. That is too strange a coincidence to be 
swallowed. 
(6) CBS devoted nearly one-fourth of "The 
Selling of the Pentagon" to films made by 
the military and available to the public. It 
said that most of the films were made orig-
inally for troop information but a large num-
ber was later released for public showing. It 
said that the Pentagon spends over $12 mil-
lion a year on films. Later, in criticizing anti-
communist films made by the Pentagon, CBS 
said: "But to the filmmakers at the Penta-
gon, with at least $12 million a year to spend. 
1946 seems to have lasted a whole genera-
tion." One could easily infer from these 
statements that a very large part of the $12 
million goes for films that are intended for 
public release. The Pentagon notes that the 
great bulk of the films are made for troop 
training, researah development, recruiting, 
medical and religious use. It charges that 
CBS was wrong in implying that the $12 
million in films was largely used to influence 
the public. CBS responds that it had no in-
tention of implying what most of the viewers 
probably Inferred from what was said. 
(7) It is charged that CBS showed Robert 
Stack narrating a Defense Department film 
in a way that suggested that he was doing a 
film on the use of weapons in Vietnam when, 
in fact, the film was about unarmed recon-
naissance pilots. The brief film clip used by 
CBS did give the impression that Stack was 
going to talk about guns in Vietnam. CBS 
says they had no intention of implying 
this and that "no such implication was 
created." Nevertheless, the inference was 
created. 
(8) "The Selling of the Pentagon" gave 
many viewers the impression that a large 
military training exercise called "Brass 
Strike" was put on for the benefit of a small 
group of civilian VIP's. Describing this mili-
tary exercise, CBS said: "An air and land 
assault on enemy territory was simulated for 
the visitors." The Defense Department points 
out that the training exercise would have 
taken place with or without the VIP visitors 
and that many other observers, including 
military personnel saw it. The answer CBS 
gives is that it did not say that the exercise 
would not have taken place in the absence 
of the VIP visitors, that it was other than a 
training exercise and that no other observers 
were present. True, CBS did not say any of 
those things, it only created that implica-
tion. 
(9) It Was charged that CBS showed As-
sistant Secretary of Defense Jerry Friedheim 
declining to answer half of the questions he 
was asked at a press briefing when actually 
at that briefing he responded to 31 of the 34 
questions asked. The complaint was that CBS 
deliberately focused on those questions that 
Mr. Friedheim detained to answer for se-
curity reasons to create the impression that 
he did not provide the press with much in-
formation. It was charged that CBS used the 
Sarile technique to indicate that press brief-
ings in Saigon were characterized by "no 
comment" answers to newsmens' questions. 
CBS said that at the Friedheim briefing 
at least 56 questions were asked and Mr. 
Friedheim was unable to answer 11 of these 
completely for varying reasons. This meant 
that he answered 80 per cent of the questions 
asked completely. CBS showed six questions 
E 1235 
being asked, the first three of which Mr. 
Friedman declined to answer or could not 
answer. In the CBS portrayal, his response 
rate was only 50 per cent compared with the 
actual 80 per cent which CBS says prevailed 
for the entire briefing. CBS says: "This is a 
fair representation which does not reflect 
adversely on Mr. Friedheim." What CBS se-
lected to show was clearly not typical of 
Mr. Friedheirn's performance at the briefing. 
CBS appeared to be trying to make the point 
that the press briefings are an occasion 
when the press is trying, without much suc-
cess, to extract information from unwilling 
Defense Department spokesmen. 
In introducing Mr. Friedheim, CBS de-
scribed him as an "adversary" of the press. 
The briefing was described as a "confronta-
tion," and CBS said of Mr. Friedheim: "He 
does not, of course, tell all he knows; he 
wouldn't have his job long if he did." There 
followed the carefully selected segment from 
the briefing showing Mr. Friedheim avoiding 
answering reporters' questions. That is what 
CBS calls a "fair" representation. The same 
kind of treatment was given the press brief-
ing in Saigon for exactly the same reason. 
CBS said the daily press briefing there was 
"known among newsmen in Saigon as the 
Five O'clock Follies." It indicated that the 
most popular phrase at the briefing was 
"no comment." 
It then illustrated this by showing a film 
clip of the briefer declining to answer ques-
tions. The Defense Department claims that 
this was not a typical scene. CBS does not 
deny that the sequence it showed was not 
typical. Instead it argues that the briefer 
should have been authorized to answer the 
particular questiolts that he was shown de-
clining to answer. Arguable though that may 
be, it does not get CBS off the hook for pre-
senting an atypical sequence and passing it 
off to the viewers as completely representa-
tive of the daily briefings. 
(10) CBS was criticized for saying that the 
phrase "protective reaction" means that the 
U.S. resumed the bombing of North Vietnam. 
The Defense Department states that "protec-
tive reaction" means a very limited kind of 
bombing undertaken to protect unarmed re-
connaissance flights over North Vietnam. It 
emphasizes that this does not mean the re-
sumption of the widespread bombing of 
North Vietnam carried out prior to Novem-
ber 1968. CBS responds that it only said the 
bombing had resumed, without saying that 
large scale bombing had been resumed. They 
say that the Defense Department has made 
it clear that "protective reaction" bombing 
Is different from the pre-November 1968 
bombing. CBS made not the slightest dis-
tinction of this kind, and many in the audi-
ence could well have been misled into think-
ing that the phrase, "the U.S. resumed the 
bombing of North Vietnam" meant that the 
U.S. had resumed the kind of bombing that 
was being carried out in 1968. 
THE QUESTION CBS DID NOT EVEN TRY TO 
ANSWER 
Although CBS once claimed to have an 
answer for every one of the criticisms of "The 
Selling of the Pentagon," its comprehensive 
reply to the critics leaves many questions un-
answered. AIM criticized 23 points in the 
CBS documentary, and CBS dealt with only 
13 of them in its "comprehensive" reply. Ten 
points, with 35 questions attached, were com-
pletely ignored. 
Among the questions CBS avoided were 
these: (1) was it not inaccurate and unfair 
to suggest that John Wayne narrated De-
fense Department films in return for help in 
making "The Green Berets?" (2) How does 
CBS define its phrase, "Pentagon propa-
ganda," and would any factual description 
of the record of communist oppression be la-

beled "propaganda" by CBS? Does CBS know 
that Walter Cronkite has changed his mind 
about the aggressive nature of communism, 
and if not why was it implied that he had 
changed his views? 
In analyzing Pentagon films, why did CBS 
focus on films on communism and then com-
plain that they dealt with communism? How 
does CBS reconcile its assertion that we 
adopted a policy of "peaceful coexistence" 
prior to 1961. with the Bay of Pigs invasion, 
the Cuban missile crisis, the building of the 
Berlin Wall and the Gulf of Tonkin resolu-
tion? 
Many of the questions CBS did not try to 
answer probed the most serious flaw in "The 
Selling of the Pentagon," the fact that it was 
fundamentally dishonest. CBS says no one 
has refuted the basic veracity of the doc-
umentary. That is precisely what AIM did.

That is why CBS has not answered AIM's 
deep probing questions. 
Mr. Speaker, if anyone is further in-
terested in the type of propaganda, such 
as was evidenced by the "Selling of the 
Pentagon" program, I add this bit of 
information from Claude Witze's column 
in Air Force magazine: 
[From Mr Force magazine, February 1972] 
In case anyone is still interested, "The 
Selling of the Pentagon" is available for 
rental. It can be obtained for a fee of $65 
from American Documentary Films, a non-
profit educational organization with offices 
at 336 West 84th St., New York, N.Y. 10024, 
or from 379 Bay St., San Francisco, Calif. 
94133. 
(Not printed at Government expense) 
American Documentary Films advertises 
that it circulates "Films for Agitation." In 
addition to the CBS masterpiece, you can se-
lect from a list that includes, for example, 
"79 Springtimes," described as "a brilliant 
impressionist biographical tribute to Ho Chi 
Minh." And there is "Hanoi, Martes 13," 
which is a "moving salute to the Vietnam-
ese," presumably those in North Vietnam. 
Then there is available, "Stagolee: Bobby 
Seale in Prison," a film in which the Pan-
ther leader speaks out, and another picture 
in which Angela Davis tells it like it is, 
from her viewpoint in jail. 
The American Documentary Film catalog 
does not include "Road to the Wall," a doc-
umentary produced by CBS for the Depart-
ment of Defense in 1962.
