 ON QUESTIONS REGARDING OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 2-10
 [Article by Editorial Department]
 [Text]   In order to open up new prospects for developing China's foreign
 economic relations in an all-round manner, we should sum up both the positive
 and the negative of our past and present experiences on a series of basic
 problems related to our foreign economic relations and thus more clearly
 understand and more satisfactorily carry out the CCP Central Committee's
 correct principles and policies.
 I.  What Exactly Is the Nature of Foreign Economic Relations?
 A few years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the external economic
 work is a strategic issue that has a bearing on the success and failure of
 our four modernizations.  This is absolutely true.
 In the "introduction" to Marx' well-known "Manuscripts on Economics (1857-
 1858)," he pointed out the necessity of studying "the international relations
 in production" after he had expounded on the various sectors in social pro-
 duction and their relations.  He was also of the opinion that we had to treat
 international relations in production as a special subject of study in eco-
 nomics.  This subject had to include "international division of labor,"
 "international exchange," "import and export," "exchange rates" and other
 themes. This is a view of great significance.   By raising this view, Marx
 pointed out, briefly and succinctly, that in the modern world, economic
 problems are by no means phenomena that are related only to domestic factors;
 on the contrary they must be studied in the context of international rela-
 tions and should not be studied in isolation from international relations.
 We should never neglect this important view of Marx' in discussing China's
 foreign economic relations.
 Almost all the countries in the present world, with perhaps very few excep-
 tions, attach great importance to the problem of external economic relations.
 Many countries and areas, such as Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, even
 regard it as a vital one.  As far back as more than 100 years ago, Marx and
 Engels pointed out that along with the emergence of the international market,
 the nations of the world have become increasingly economically related and

 dependent on one another and the closed-door and self-sufficient situation
 are gradually becoming things of the past.  During the past decades, espe-
 cially since World War II, this situation has been further developed in an
 unprecedented manner.  This is a fundamental historical task as well as an
 inevitable trend of social development.  We should never be ignorant of this
 fact in regarding China's foreign economic relations today.
 Since the founding of the PRC, we have undergone many twists and turns in
 developing our foreign economic relations and have failed to make any sub-
 stantial progress in this respect.   Of course, we are not to blame for this
 on the grounds that we preferred a policy of closing our country to inter-
 national exchanges.  At that time there were other reasons:  First, the
 major capitalist countries in the world headed by the United States adopted
 an antagonistic attitude toward us and blockaded us for a long time.  They
 put an embargo on many commodities.  Second, since the beginning of the
 1960's, when the Soviet Union tore up its economic contracts with us, our
 economic relations with the Soviet Union and a few other countries have
 been greatly reduced.   Third, for a time, especially during the period of
 the "Great Cultural Revolution," our policy of self-reliance was greatly
 distorted.   Self-reliance is an absolutely correct policy, but it is abso-
 lutely wrong to distort this policy and set it against the development of
 external economic relations.
 Since the time around 1972, there has been a change in our foreign economic
 relations and we have gradually opened up some prospects.   However, it was
 not until the smashing of the "gang of four" and especially not until the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee that it was made clear
 throughout the party that we should develop our foreign economic relations.
 This is indeed a very farsighted policy decision.  Then, from 1978 to 1980.
 we actually brought about a great change to and made great progress in our
 foreign economic relations.  At the same time, we also committed some errors
 in this respect.   This has taught us that we should sum up our experience and
 make the pace of our progress steadier.  However, we should not, for this
 reason, get the wrong idea and think that we should retreat and dare not
 continue to actively develop our foreign economic relations.   Summing up
 experience is aimed at developing the foreign economic relations of this
 socialist country more satisfactorily.   Otherwise, we will be going against
 the principle of the third plenary session of the Central Committee.
 The party Central Committee recently noted that to promote our socialist
 modernization program, we must use two types of resources, that is, domestic
 resources and international resources; we must develop both our domestic
 market and our place in the world market; and we must master two skills,
 that of domestic construction management and that of developing foreign
 economic relations.   This has further defined the strategic position of our
 foreign economic relations.  According to this point of view we should con-
 tinue to vigorously widen our field of vision and raise our understanding
 on the problem of developing our foreign economic relations.  After the
 October Revolution, Lenin advocated the implementation of the concession
 system.  At that time, since the Soviet Union was in great difficulties, the
 enterprises under the concession system amounted to more than 200 and tens

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 of millions of rubles of foreign capital was drawn into the Soviet Union.
 At that time, Lenin was of the opinion that associating the Soviet Union
 with international capital was necessary.  At the same time, he thought that
 there was a serious struggle in the course of associating with international
 capital and associating with international capital was aimed at promoting
 the socialist economic construction of the Soviet state.  Today, we are con-
 tinuing to act in accordance with Lenin's viewpoint.  It is wrong to close
 the country to international exchange, to fight in isolation or to refuse to
 be associated with international capital.   On the other hand, it is also
 wrong to neglect or abandon struggles during the process of associating with
 international capital.   To put it in a nutshell, we should struggle while
 associating.   At present, we must pay attention to summing up experience,
 formulate a whole set of correct guiding principles, policies and measures
 by thinking over carefully and continuing to make great efforts, and open up
 a path for developing our country's foreign economic relations that is suited
 to both national and international conditions.  Only by so doing can we really
 and effectively overcome all kinds of conservative ideas that uphold sticking
 to old ways and can we overcome blindness and spontaneity in our action.
 Only by so doing can we open up new possibilities and take the initiative
 in our own hands.
 II.  Why Is It That the Development of Foreign Economic Relations Is an
 Important Strategic Question in Our Modernization Program?
 In essence, this is a question of how to soberly understand the problem of
 in what historical conditions, what national conditions and what favorable
 and unfavorable conditions we are carrying out our modernization program.
 We have the following four favorable conditions:
 First, except in Taiwan, we have already soundly established the socialist
 political and economic system throughout our country.  We have transformed
 the private ownership of the means of production into public ownership and
 the members of the exploited class into laborers who support themselves by
 their own labor.   We have also placed the lifelines of our national economy
 in the hands of our state on behalf of the working class and on behalf of
 the whole laboring people.
 Second, we have already corrected our guiding ideology and started to formu-
 late a line and a complete set of principles and policies for carrying out
 the four modernizations program, and we have already formed a strong and
 resolute CCP Central Committee that is competent to correctly lead the four
 modernizations.
 Third, with our strong national defense forces, we are strong enough to
 defend the peaceful construction of our people.  At the same time, owing to
 our correct foreign policies, we enjoy high political prestige in the world.
 Fourth, there are very favorable international conditions for our concen-
 trating on carrying out our modernization program.  Already, 174 states and
 areas have started trading and are developing their trade and economic
 relations with us.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 We have the following four unfavorable conditions:
 First, though we already have some technical strength which is already up to
 advanced world standards in some respects, on the whole, our equipment, tech-
 nology, technical personnel, management and administrative standards are
 backward and lag behind the world advanced standards to a fairly large
 degree.
 Second, although we already have a considerably sound material basis and are
 able to accumulate some funds every year, our sources of funds are, after all,
 limited.   The amount of funds raised within our country falls short of the
 demands of construction.
 Third, our rich natural resources are indeed a favorable condition, but many
 of these resources still remain unexploited underground.  Therefore, this is
 only a latent favorable condition instead of a realized favorable condition.
 Fourth, our excessive population is a heavy burden on our country.  Though
 it constitutes a rich resource of manpower, we lack the means to utilize
 this.   Of course, if our manpower is fully utilized, it will change from
 being a burden into being an advantage.
 The above-mentioned favorable and unfavorable conditions are what we should
 proceed from in considering the problems concerning China's economy today,
 'including those of foreign economic relations.  It is precisely because vie
 proceed from these historical conditions that we uphold the view that we must
 work hard and perseveringly, rely on, our own strength, maintain independence
 and keep the initiative in our own hands while promoting our socialist mod-
 ernizations program.  We must not, in the slightest degree, deviate from
 these principles.   The modernization cause of a big country with a popula-
 tion of 1 billion should and can only be carried out by relying on the
 country's own strength.   However, on the other hand, it is also because we
 proceed from these historical conditions that we uphold that we should not
 distort self-reliance and regard closing our country to international
 exchange and fighting in isolation as self-reliance.  We must expand our
 field of vision from our country to the world on the basis of self-reliance.
 We must not only go all out to make use of all positive factors within our
 country, but should also go all out to make use of all foreign factors that
 can be used by us.   This means, in fact, using the strong points of all the
 countries in the world to offset our weakness.   Using the phrase in the book
 "Guan Zi," this means "taking all the valuable things in the world for our
 use."  Only in this way can we develop our national industries as quickly as
 possible through foreign economic relations and by drawing support from
 foreign capital and advanced technology.   Only in this way can we more
 smoothly overcome the difficulties facing us and quicken the pace of pro-
 moting our socialist modernization program.   Precisely in this sense lies
 the strategic significance that we attach to our foreign economic relations.
 On the problem of foreign relations, we can draw quite a large number of
 experiences and lessons from the history of modern China.   In our history,
 there were two kinds of people.   One kind of people worshipped and had blind

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 faith in foreign things and was subservient to foreigners.  As a result these
 people humiliated the nation and forfeited its sovereignty.  Whether the
 Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai or Chiang Kai-shek, they were, without
 exception, cast aside by the people.   The other kind of people upheld closing
 the country to international exchange and adopted an arrogant attitude toward
 other countries.  Thus these people were satisfied to lag behind and finally
 became castaways in history.  Were not the diehards at the end of the Qing
 dynasty, who regarded China as the "Heavenly Kingdom" and treated all foreign
 countries as "uncivilized nations" that should be put under the suzerainty
 of China, this kind of people?  Under the present new historical situations,
 the above-mentioned two tendencies are still to some extent reflected in the
 minds of some of our party members and cadres.  This may perhaps be regarded
 as a kind of historical legacy.  Some people feel ashamed before foreigners
 and think that everything is good in other countries, and bad in ours.  Others
 are very apprehensive about opening up to the outside world and are of the
 opinion that there will not be peace and security if we-open up and that if we
 must open up, we must open up as little as possible.  The two tendencies have
 a common point and that is their lack of confidence in the fact that today
 we, as a developing great socialist country, are able to open up new pros-
 pects in developing our foreign relations.
 Our comrades, especially all those who are engaging in external activities
 including external economic activities, must have a profound understanding
 of the strategic significance of our foreign relations, especially the
 strategic significance of our foreign economic relations.  They must be both
 brave and adept in plunging into the vast world to open up new prospects.
 At the same time, they must also carefully pay attention to understanding
 the extremely complex nature of the environment we face as a result of open-
 ing up to the outside world, be both brave and adept in learning new skills
 and abilities, prevent and overcome various kinds of negative practices,
 adhere to the principle of socialism and persistently safeguard the purity
 of communism.  We must do all the above-mentioned things without the small-
 est omission.                      Otherwise we will be committing a great error which will
 cause great harm to our cause.  This is an indispensably important factor
 in ensuring the healthy development of our external work and the victory of
 our construction cause.
 III.   The Necessity.of Having a Whole Set of Correct Guiding Principles and
 Policies on Foreign Relations
 This means that we should not do our work at random or deal with only those
 problems that have cropped up.   Instead, we should have a complete set of
 plans- with scientific foresight.   For this purpose, we should really have a
 good grasp of the major issues and characteristics of our foreign economic
 relations.
 What are the characteristics of our foreign economic relations?
 First, dealing with foreign businessmen is different from dealing with
 people in our country.   In dealing with the people in our country we can
 enforce discipline and even force people to observe the discipline if
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 necessary.  However, in dealing with foreign businessmen, we cannot act in
 this manner, and should pay attention to maintaining our good reputation.
 In discussing contracts and agreements, we must deal with the foreign busi-
 nessmen on the basis of equality, mutual benefits and voluntariness.   In
 view of this, we should both be strict in enforcing discipline at home and
 be flexible externally..
 Second, foreign economic relations often involve many departments and fields.
 Some of the problems they involve even affect the whole economy and social
 life of our country.   In view of this, our localities, departments and units
 should not act independently in conducting their foreign economic activities
 and thus leave loopholes for foreign businessmen to exploit and enable them
 to make excessive profits at our expense.   Instead, we should carry out our
 external economic activities under unified leadership and comprehensive
 planning.   Only under such a premise can we give better play to the initia-
 tive of all the parties concerned.
 Third, we should make a distinction between two kinds of foreign businessmen.
 With regard to those foreign businessmen who show their good faith in
 cooperation and do business in a proper way, we will take a welcoming and
 polite attitude, pay attention to maintaining a friendly relationship with
 them and implement the policy of equality and mutual benefit, no matter
 whether we will be able to do business and come to terms with them.  As for
 those foreign businessmen who have ulterior motives, adopt improper measures,
 go so far as to adopt measures that violate our country's sovereignty, and
 go in for swindling, bribing, smuggling, infiltration or even espionage
 activities that impair the rights and interests of the Chinese people and
 corrupt our cadres and citizens, they will certainly meet with firm
 resistance from the Chinese people and some will be prosecuted in accordance
 with China's laws.  All our party members, cadres and citizens who depart
 from the correct stand in these unlawful activities and who have been cor-
 rupted by such foreign businessmen must naturally be criticized and admin-
 istratively, or even judicially, punished.
 In short,  the above-mentioned characteristics mean unified leadership,
 comprehensive planning, flexible response, strict discipline, making dis-
 tinctions and adherence to principles.   These things must be conscientiously
 observed as a general principle in our work.
 However varied our foreign economic relations are, they can be summarized as
 exportation and importation.   These two aspects interact and are dependent
 and conditional on one another.   Therefore, the key issue in handling
 foreign economic relations is to correctly handle the relationships between
 these two aspects and dialectically harmonize them.
 Focusing on this key issue, we have to study the following six problems:
 First, how to attract foreign capital; second, how to correctly introduce
 advanced science and technology from abroad; third, how to vigorously
 develop international cooperation in exploiting manpower; fourth, how to
 energetically market our products in the world; fifth, how to provide
 economic aid to other countries in accordance with our capability; and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 sixth, how to correctly handle the relationships between political and eco-
 nomic aspects in our external relations.  As long as we have a clear under-
 standing of these six problems and adopt correct policies and vigorous
 measures to solve them, we will surely be able to continuously make progress
 in developing our foreign economic relations year by year, and we will surely
 be able to give increasingly full play to the role of foreign economic rela-
 tions in promoting our construction at home.
 IV.  How Should We Attract Foreign Capital?
 This is a prominent problem in handling our foreign economic relations at
 present.  It is a problem which we urgently need to solve but which we have
 as yet failed to solve.
 Attracting capital from capitalist countries and areas in accordance with the
 practical needs and capabilities of our country is a new task that we have
 never tackled before.  That is why this problem is especially important today.
 At present we usually adopt the following three methods in attracting foreign
 capital:   First, attracting direct investment in joint ventures, joint
 management, joint exploitation, compensation trade, processing and assembling;
 second, striving to obtain long- or medium-term loans at medium or low inter-
 est rates from foreign governments and international financial organizations
 and all kinds of development funds and relief funds; and third, obtaining
 ordinary commercial loans.  At present, attracting direct investment has
 become the most important method for China to utilize foreign capital.  This
 method has two advantages, .namely, that of granting the investor direct
 interest in what they invest in and that of enabling us to better learn from
 the advanced technology and management abroad.   The successful experiences
 in many countries have proved that these kinds of joint venture and joint
 management enterprises themselves constitute economic and technical training
 courses.
 In order to effectively attract direct investment, we should have a set of
 clear and definite correct policies.  First, we must grasp all the large,
 medium-sized and small projects at once while regarding medium-sized and
 small ones as the main factor..   This is the way to get quick results.
 Second, we should welcome all capitalists from abroad, including foreign and
 Overseas Chinese capitalists and those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
 And third, we should to a certain extent relax our policy and allow these
 capitalists to make profits.  If we do not allow them to make money, we will
 not be able to attract them and we will not be able to open up any possi-
 bilities.  We will not be able to keep up with the times if we do not act
 bravely and wisely.
 It is imperative to be prudent in using ordinary commercial loans.   Since
 they are loans, we have to repay the principal and the interest.  Moreover,
 the loans should be used in combination with domestic investment to form
 complete sets of investment.   Thus there will inevitably be limitations in
 our utilization of foreign commercial loans.  As for long- and medium-term
 loans at medium or low interest rates, though we can feel more at ease in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 utilizing them, their availability is limited.  A capitalist is, after all,
 a capitalist.  As long as he is a capitalist, he will always be pursuing
 excessive profits.  We should be especially careful in drawing lessons from
 the countries that are heavily in debt.
 In short, in order to emancipate people's minds, we should sum up our
 experiences in a timely way and carefully foster model units.  The experi-
 ence in a successful model unit will facilitate the progress in all similar
 units.  Thus we will be able to open up broad prospects step by step.
 V.  How Are We To Correctly Import Advanced Science and Technology?
 There are many ways to introduce advanced science and technology from abroad
 and we should not restrict ourselves to a few ways.  We have five kinds of
 things to import in this respect:  advanced equipment or components; new
 and fine-quality materials; new principles, data, and know-how; new skills
 and scientific rules of operations; and advanced management methods.
 In importing equipment, we have committed some errors, but we have to make
 a realistic analysis of these errors.   Importing a few complete sets of
 equipment was necessary not only in the past, but also is necessary now and
 will be necessary in the future. Our errors in the past were mainly in the
 following four respects:   importing an excessive number of complete sets of
 equipment; importing the same equipment more than once; importing equipment
 without importing the technical information to operate the equipment; and
 failing to study the technology of the imported equipment so as to under-
 stand it and popularize it.                   Having learned lessons from the above-mentioned
 errors, we will be able to gradually improve our work in this respect in the
 future.
 Regarding the problem of importing new and fine-quality materials, we should
 first of all make efforts to produce these materials ourselves.  We should
 encourage our specialists and technicians and organize them into key task
 teams to plunge into production practice, grasp the new production tech-
 nology, increase the varieties of our products and expand the scale of our
 production, and thus win glory for our country.   However, we should also
 fully reckon on a long-term policy of importing various kinds of raw mate-
 rials, especially new and fine-quality materials that are necessary for our
 construction.  In order to grasp all kinds of new technology, all countries
 in the world have to do so, including the developed ones such as the United
 States, Japan and West Germany.
 Regarding introducing advanced science, technology and management from
 abroad, we should admit that we have failed to make sufficiently great
 efforts to learn soundly and modestly from abroad.   Now we should further
 encourage our broad ranks of cadres, intellectuals and workers to have the
 high aspirations of the Chinese people and turn the slogan of studying
 science to become more capable and learning from experts into action.   We
 should strive to create a social mood of working and studying hard for the
 prosperity of our country among all our party members, among the broad ranks
 of our cadres, intellectuals and workers, and even among all the people
 throughout our society and nation.   This is a task of vital importance.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 In introducing advanced science and technology from abroad we should also pay
 attention to the following two problems:
 The first problem is that from now on, we must no longer import consumer
 goods. Except under unified state arrangements, no departments or localities
 are allowed to import consumer goods without authorization.  The practices of
 some departments and localities that are importing consumer goods without
 permission are, in fact, very harmful and shameful activities that impair our
 national industry.  It is an important principle that we must pay close
 attention to protecting our national industry.  We must make the widest
 possible use of those daily consumer goods that can be made and supplied by
 domestic units.   We should vigorously encourage and develop the spirit of
 Comrade Zhou Enlai in refusing to wear any watches other than those that
 are made in China.  Only by encouraging our broad masses of people, and
 above all our party members and cadres, to use Chinese-made consumer goods
 can we protect our national industry and ensure its smooth development.
 The other problem is that we must do a good job in managing foreign exchange
 in all our central departments and in all the localities under the unified
 leadership of the state.  We must use our foreign exchange where it is
 needed most.   This means that we should use it for the technical reform and
 the renewal of our industrial equipment.  We should use it to import advanced
 equipment and components that are necessary to develop new lines of indus-
 trial production, new and fine-quality materials that are in short supply
 in our country and that are urgently needed for processing goods for export,
 certain agricultural means of production that our country cannot supply and
 that are urgently needed in developing agriculture, and certain kinds of
 consumer goods that our country indeed cannot supply and that are indeed
 indispensable in the life of our people.  Are we not acting against the
 interests of our state and people if we waste the limited amount of our hard
 earned foreign exchange in importing unnecessary consumer goods instead of in
 importing equipment, technology and raw materials that we urgently need for
 expanded production and for earning a larger amount of foreign exchange?
 VI.  How Are We To Energetically Promote Our Business of International Labor
 Cooperation?
 An excessive population-is a great problem facing us.   On the other hand, our
 abundant labor force is our country's greatest advantage.  We not only have a
 large amount of surplus labor in our countryside, but also some surplus labor
 in our state-owned factories and mines.  Moreover, every year a large number
 of people enters the labor force.   Therefore the total amount of our surplus
 labor is very large.   If we take the total number of surplus laborers as 100
 million and suppose that every laborer is able to produce 500 yuan of products,
 the total value of their products will be 50 billion yuan a year.  The prob-
 lem now is not that these laborers lack initiative in their work but that
 they have no opportunities to play their roles.  In order to find a way out,
 we should strengthen our organizational work, open up as many possibilities
 as possible. and be good at giving guidance.  As far as we can foresee, in a
 fairly long period to come, we should first speed up the development of the
 diversified economy in our countryside and open up as many possibilities in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 the cities to provide more job opportunities.   By so doing we will be able
 to employ a large amount of the labor force and can, moreover, organize it
 to produce goods for export.  At the same time, we should find employment
 for them throughout the world and conscientiously develop international
 labor cooperation.
 Our business of international labor cooperation has just begun.  In 1981, we
 sent over 17,000 laborers abroad to work on contracts.  This number was too
 small compared with our potential in this respect, compared with the demand
 for such labor abroad and compared with the numbers of laborers that other
 developing countries have sent abroad.  Our construction undertakings have
 shown a sharp competitive edge in contracting for construction projects in
 the world market and these projects will in turn promote the export of our
 building materials.  From the above we can see that there are bright pros-
 pects in developing international labor cooperation.
 Labor cooperation is not restricted to contracting for construction projects
 abroad.  It can also be developed in the following three ways:  processing
 materials from foreign businessmen and processing in accordance with the
 samples or drawings from foreign businessmen; establishing all kinds of
 enterprises in foreign countries; and energetically developing tourism.  It
 is said by some foreigners that the pottery figurines of soldiers and horses
 at Lintong are one of the eight wonders in the world and as a result 50,000
 foreigners went there to see them last year.  We have to improve our tourist
 facilities and nationally fix the prices of the goods that we sell to tourists
 in order to increase our sales by narrowing the profit margins.  By so doing
 we will benefit by opening up of more job opportunities and earning more
 foreign exchange.
 It seems that for a long time to come, our manpower will continue to be the
 most competitive thing we have in the world market.  We should give guidance
 to the cities and provinces along our coastline in vigorously developing the
 processing of materials provided by foreign businessmen.   But we must pay
 attention to exporting all the finished goods of our processing undertakings
 and should not allow them to enter the domestic market.  Otherwise, the
 processing undertakings will facilitate the import of foreign goods.
 VII.   How Are We To Bring Chinese Products Into the World Market on a Still
 Larger Scale?
 China's current export trade is conducted on a too narrow and small scale.
 We have nearly one-fourth of the world's population, but our share of the
 world market is less than 1 percent, 0.9 percent to be more exact, which
 ranks 28th in the world.  Of course, in recent years we have to some extent
 improved our work and have made relatively great progress in this respect,
 but we should not exaggerate our successes.
 There are both objective historical and subjective reasons why the scale of.
 our exports has remained so small for more than 30 years.   We should cer-
 tainly not reproach ourselves too severely for our subjective errors, but we
 must soberly understand this fact and strive to achieve a relatively great
 development of our export trade within a short period of time.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Regarding the relationships between exports and imports, there is also the
 problem of breaking through the old conventions and opening up a new situa-
 tion.
 Generally speaking, exports are the basis of our foreign trade.  It will
 never do if we conduct our foreign trade in the manner of importing only
 without exporting any goods.  We have always been particular. about striking
 some important balances, including the balance of international receipts and
 payments.  However, does this mean that in arranging our export and import
 business that our imports should be restricted by the value of exports and
 should not exceed our exports every year?  No, this is not a good way of
 putting it.  Regarding this question, we should make all-round arrangements
 by considering the whole situation, and we should correctly understand and
 handle the dialectical relationships between exports and imports.  That we
 can only import after we have exported some of our goods and obtained some
 foreign exchange to pay for our imports is only one aspect of the question.
 We should see another aspect of the question, namely, our imports can in
 turn promote our exports.   For example, when we lack materials for producing
 goods for export, we have to import the materials and then process and turn
 them into goods for export.   Only by so doing can we promote our exports.
 Another example is that by introducing equipment and technology to increase
 the output and improve the quality.of our products, we will be able to make
 them more competitive in the world market.   Thus imports will also promote
 our exports.   These arguments have long been fully proved by the successful
 experiences in Japan and many other countries and areas.   Could these coun-
 tries and areas have survived if they had restricted the volume of their
 imports to that of their exports?  Therefore, promoting imports by develop-
 ing exports and promoting exports by developing imports is a kind of dialec-
 tical relationship.   This relationship can only be rationally balanced and
 reasonably handled in the course of time, perhaps 1 or 2 years.
 What policies should we adopt and in what direction should we strive to
 increase the export of our products?  To answer this question, we have to
 sum up the experiences in our history.  In the past, the export of some kinds
 of our products relied, to a great extent, on reducing their supply in our
 domestic market.  This was a natural practice during the 1950's because we
 had very few things to export at that time and could not avoid doing this.
 However, it is wrong to continue to do so now.   Certainly, we can reduce the
 supply of some high-grade goods and agricultural and sideline products at
 home in order to export these goods.  But even in doing this we should not
 go too far and we should not base our hopes for increasing exports on this.
 Otherwise we will bring about an acute shortage of consumer goods in our
 domestic market, and thus we will not only force our people to reduce their
 consumption but also make it impossible for the processing undertakings in
 our country to develop smoothly.  Moreover, a shortage of goods at home will
 impair our people'.s initiative and will encourage speculative activities in
 our domestic market.   Perhaps some people will say that the United States is
 also exporting a large amount of agricultural products.   This shows that these
 comrades do not understand the essence of the problem.   Agricultural produc-
 tion in the United States has already been carried out in the manner of
 industrial production, and this is completely different from the agricultural
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 production in the countries of the Third World.  The extensive export of
 agricultural products by the United States is in essence an action to dump
 its surplus industrial products.  On the other hand, when the Third World
 countries sell agricultural products to developed capitalist countries in
 exchange for their industrial consumer goods, they suffer the exploitation
 of the rich countries because of the unequal exchange.  We should not follow
 the path of these Third World countries or we will commit mistakes.
 What should we do in accordance with a correct policy?  According to our
 historical and current experiences, we should strive to make progress in
 the following four directions:
 First, energetically increasing our export of mineral products and vigorously
 developing our export of nonferrous and rare metals.  In the past, there was
 an argument that strategic materials should not be exported.  This view has
 long been outdated.  We should emancipate our minds in understanding this
 problem.   Of course, we should arrange our export of these materials.in a
 planned manner and strive to get the most favorable terms in trading them.
 Second, conscientiously increasing-our export of mechanical and electrical
 products.   In the past few years, we have made relatively rapid progress in
 this respect, but there is still great potential to tap.   We should mobilize
 the millions of staff and workers in our engineering industry and encourage
 them to raise the quality of their products and improve their technology in
 order to enable their products to enter the world market and win prestige
 for their motherland.
 Third, further developing the export of light industrial products, textiles,.
 various arts and crafts articles such as chinaware, cross-stitch work,
 Chinese medicines, clothes, embroidery products and carvings.
 Fourth, developing the export of our special local products such as tea,
 Chinese medicinal materials, livestock products, natural products and
 preserved fruits.
 Of course, if necessary, we will have to reduce, to an appropriate extent,
 the domestic supply of some daily consumer goods that are in short supply
 both at home and abroad and that are much needed in the livelihood of our
 people in order to increase their export.
 We should adopt a series of policies and measures in order to develop our
 export trade.   For example, we should adopt proper policies. in support of
 the development of our export trade, including going out to establish
 marketing and servicing networks, making increased efforts to improve the
 prestige of our products, pay attention to product quality, pay attention
 to honoring agreements, solving transportation problems and port problems,
 and bringing into full play the initiative of all departments and areas.
 VIII.  How Are We To Correctly Support the Third World?
 Offering support to the peoples of all Third World countries in their just
 struggles to defend their national independence, develop their national

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 economies and oppose imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism is China's
 international duty which it cannot shirk.  Over the past 30 years and more,
 China has done a lot of work in such aspects and played an important active
 role in handling international affairs.
 Most of the Third World countries are countries friendly with us and are
 enthusiastic in opposing imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism.  However,
 their social and political systems and level of economic development differ
 widely.  Regarding the level of economic development of these countries,
 most of them are poor or the poorest countries in the world and only a small
 number of them are rich.  In terms of per capita average national product,
 the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait rank as the top three in the
 world, but they are Third World countries.   There are also quite a few Third
 World countries that are much richer than our country.  Owing to the above-
 mentioned complicated situation, in carrying out our policies of supporting
 Third World countries including the policy of giving them economic aid and
 promoting our economic contacts with them, we should make a clear distinction
 of their different economic statuses and act accordingly.
 One of the facts at present which cannot be ignored is that many of the
 Third World countries are carrying out their economic construction on a
 fairly large scale.  This is the case in many countries in Latin America,
 Africa, the Middle and Near East, the Gulf area and Southeast Asia.   There
 are bright prospects for our economic cooperation with them.
 On the other hand, we should extend by every possible means material aid to
 those poverty-stricken countries which are in difficulty and which are sub-
 ject to external aggression and threats.
 Our comrades must understand that supporting the Third World countries is an
 issue of strategic significance and we should never neglect this issue.  Now
 many Third World countries hope that we will help them in their development.
 They say that some of the First World and Second World countries have set up
 factories in their countries to bully them and some are even carrying out
 subversive activities there.   These countries have also expressed their con-
 fidence in China.   It is reported that in the past few years,. India has
 achieved good results in setting up joint venture enterprises abroad--mainly
 in other Third World countries.   In 1981, the number of such joint venture
 enterprises was more than 400 and these enterprises were located in more than
 40 countries in the world, of which more than 90 percent were in Southeast
 Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.  We should also do our best to
 do something along these lines.
 IX.  We Should Correctly Understand Political and Economic Relations
 In order to develop our foreign economic activities well, we should break
 with some old conventions and set to right the relationships between politics
 and the economy.
 For a long time, we upheld the argument that economics must be subordinated
 to politics.  This argument is partly right but it fails to take every aspect
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 of the problem into account.  One of the basic viewpoints of Marxism-
 Leninism is that economics and politics influence and act-on one another
 but in the final analysis, politics is decided by economics.  This is also
 true in handling the issue of foreign relations.  If foreign economic rela-
 tions are developed in a satisfactory manner, it will facilitate the con-
 tinuous development of political diplomatic relations.   On the contrary, if
 we fail to open up the prospects for developing foreign economic relations,
 the development of political relations with foreign countries will inevitably
 be obstructed and will never be able to be vigorous.   The reason why many
 countries carry out their economic transactions with one another despite
 bitter political antagonism lies in the demand resulting from their economic
 interests.  Not only the capitalist countries but all countries have to take
 into account their major economic interests in deciding their political
 policies.  This is a common phenomenon in the world.
 In handling the relationships between politics and economics, we should
 stress that stringent efforts should be made to master advanced science,
 culture and management methods from other countries, but as for the influ-
 ence of corrupt bourgeois ideas, we should resolutely oppose them.  At
 present, some people are adopting a diametrically different attitude.   They
 do not work hard to learn from the really advanced things abroad and even
 completely neglect the study.   On the other hand, they treasure the most
 degenerate and the most evil things from capitalist countries and allow them
 to become all the rage.  We have sharply pointed out this problem for a long
 time, to call the whole party and the people throughout our country to be on
 their guard and to pay attention to correctly handling this problem.  We
 should strictly enforce the discipline that governs our external economic
 activities and tell everyone who is engaged in external economic activities
 his obligation to observe discipline.   If anyone violates this discipline,
 he will be punished in accordance with party discipline, administrative
 discipline and the laws of the state.   We should intensify our education in
 patriotism and internationalism and teach all our party members, cadres and
 citizens to understand that in our contacts with the outside world we should
 resolutely oppose the corruption of capitalist ideology, safeguard our
 national dignity and national interests and maintain the prestige of our
 party and state.
 China is implementing special policies and flexible measures in Guangdong and
 Fujian Provinces, and has also established in the two provinces four special
 economic zones, namely, Shenzhen, Zhuhai,  Shantou and Xiamen.  We should
 intensify our education and make the cadres and masses in these provinces,
 especially those in the special economic zones, really understand the true
 implications of the special policies and the flexible measures.  What is
 special is special only when it is compared with what is unified, and what
 is flexible is flexible only when it is compared with what is in accordance
 with principle.   Both specialty and unity and both flexibility and principle
 are related with one another.   The special policies are adopted under the
 guidance of the unified national policy.   Deviating from the four basic
 principles and the socialist orientation is not a part of the special poli-
 cies but is called degeneration.  Our flexible measures can play flexible
 roles only on the basis of firmly adhering to a principled stand.   Casting

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 away the communist stand, the party spirit and the party principles is not
 called a flexible way of doing things but is called capitulationism.  This
 fundamental demarcation line must not be obscured.  Through the development
 of our foreign economic relations, the special policies and flexible measures
 are primarily aimed at enabling us to do a better job. of boldly promoting
 construction on our own initiative and under better conditions, and to
 improve product quality, production techniques and management for the sake
 of making new progress in two fields, namely, the management of economic
 construction and the development of foreign economic relations.
 X.  The Profound and Lasting Significance of Expanding Foreign Economic
 Relations
 A major issue that our central leading comrades have been repeatedly mulling
 over is whether we will be able to achieve material successes in our social-
 ist modernization within this century.  We have confidence in this.  However,
 taking our party as a whole, there are still some comrades who lack confi-
 dence and a small number of people even doubt it.   Naturally, as yet no one
 can immediately foretell how great our material successes will be in our
 modernizations and one can only give a rough estimation.   If. we do our work
 well, we may achieve relatively great success, but if not, we will perhaps
 achieve only some small or medium successes.  One of the critical issues here
 is whether we will be able to really open up bright prospects over the next
 few.years.
 It is not easy to open up bright prospects.  During the initial period of the
 war of resistance [against Japan], Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi
 laid stress on opening up bright prospects.  As Comrade Liu Shaoqi so rightly
 said, there is always a problem of opening up bright prospects during the
 period of a turning point.   This is a historical truth.  In the modern
 history of China, the Taiping Tianguo initially opened up bright prospects,
 but there was a change in the situation after it took Nanjing and the bright
 prospects were lost.   When Doctor Sun Yat-sen led the revolution, the 1911
 revolution opened up bright prospects, but this was brought to an end by his
 death.   The tortuous course of our history tells us that all those who want
 to lead the historical trend and open up a bright prospect must first of all
 have.a good insight and some courage and perseverance.  Moreover they should
 also have a complete set of correct strategy and tactics.  Otherwise, it will
 be impossible for them to open up bright prospects, and even once they have
 opened up some prospects, they will not be able to maintain the good situa-
 tion and win final victory.  On the contrary,  they will often suffer defeats
 when victory is already in sight.
 To open up bright prospects, our task in the economic field at present lies
 chiefly in the following four closely connected links:
 First, bringing our agricultural potential into full play and particularly
 bringing about a great development of our diversified economy.
 Second, bringing our industrial potential into full play and particularly
 achieving success in reorganizing enterprises at an early date.

 Third, developing China's financial, monetary and commercial circulation in
 a more healthy way.
 And fourth, relatively quickly developing our foreign economic relations.
 If in the coming 20 years, we quadruple the scale of our foreign trade
 through developing our foreign economic activities, our total yearly trade
 volume will be 160 billion yuan.  This figure appears tremendous, but it
 constitutes only 4 percent of the total yearly trade volume in the world at
 present.
 Lu Zhi, an outstanding statesman and a man well known for his abilities in
 conducting financial transactions in the Tang dynasty, once said:   "Losing
 a large amount of money because of begrudging a small expenditure, this is
 what a businessman will not do; and losing.a bright future prospect because
 of pursuing immediate interests, this is what a man of common wisdom will
 not do."  These words were well said.   Our comrades who are engaged in
 economic work should be enlightened by these words.   Businessmen who know
 how to do business, who are good at increasing sales by narrowing their profit
 margin and who really want to enliven their business will never act in the
 manner of losing a large amount of money because of begrudging a small
 expenditure.   Even people of common wisdom can understand that it is wrong
 to give up one's future bright prospects in pursuing one's immediate inter-
 ests.   This means that we should be good at having a thorough understanding
 of the whole situation and at perceiving the future general direction of the
 development of things, thus we will have a strategic insight and will be free
 from shortsightedness.
 Have we not always mentioned being of one heart and one mind?  Being of one
 heart means that we should think the same way and being of one mind means
 that we should struggle together.  As long as we really unite our strategic
 thinking and really coordinate our tactical actions and thus think the same
 way and struggle together, we will surely open up bright prospects.   Of
 course, this takes time.   In the future, we should seek to be of one heart
 by means of. exchanging opinions and conducting investigation and study and.
 we should seek to be of one mind through the practice of fighting together.
 In short, let us be of one heart and one mind in striving to open up bright
 prospects so as to develop the cause of socialist modernization of our
 motherland.

 ON BOURGEOIS LIBERALIZATION AND OTHER ISSUES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 11-13
 [Article by Hu Qiaomu]
 [Text]   Editor's note:   Issue No 23, 1981, of this maga-
 zine carried an article by Comrade Hu Qiaomu entitled
 "Some Present Problems on the Ideological Front."  After
 the publication of this article, some constructive views
 and suggestions were received from readers on this dis-
 cussion.  Therefore, before the article's publication by
 the People's Publishing House, Comrade Hu Qiaomu made
 some amendments and additions to.this article based on
 the views and suggestions of readers.  In the amendments
 and additions, the expositions on the issues of bourgeois
 liberalization and of the criteria for appraising lit-
 erary and art works are very important.  At present, we
 are publishing them under the title "On Bourgeois Lib-
 eralization and Other Issues."  The parts published here
 are based on the sequential order of the original article
 with captions and annotations added.  The fourth part is
 not an amendment of the original article, but a new
 annotation added by the author.
 1.   On the Meaning of Bourgeois Liberalization
 Here I would like to briefly discuss the meaning of bourgeois liberalization.
 Why do we call the social ideological tendency of opposing the four basic
 principles which exists in our society at present the ideological tendency
 of bourgeois liberalization?  As everybody knows, the most important freedom
 under the capitalist system is the freedom of capitalists to carry out
 exploitation through the hiring of labor and the freedom of safeguarding
 bourgeois private ownership.  This is the most essential point about bour-
 beois liberalization.   The others include freedom of speech; publication,
 assembly, and association; freedom of election; and freedom for two or more
 parties to hold office in turn.   In the final analysis, all these are derived
 from the above-mentioned important freedom and serve it.  Moreover, this
 ideological tendency appearing in our society at present is characterized by
 energetically publicizing, advocating and seeking the freedom of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 bourgeoisie and trying to apply the bourgeois parliamentary system, the two-
 party system, the election system, the bourgeois freedom of speech, publi-
 cation, assembly and association, bourgeois individualism and nihilism to a
 certain extent, bourgeois profit-before-everything ideas and actions, bour-
 geois lifestyle and vulgar interests, bourgeois morals and artistic standards,
 bourgeois speculation and manipulation, graft and embezzlement, extortion and
 accepting of bribes, profiting at public expensed appropriating public
 property, and worshipping and. fawning on the capitalist world to oppose our
 political, economic, social and cultural life, and negate, oppose and sabo-
 tage in principle China's socialist cause and negate, oppose and sabotage
 the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over China's socialist cause.
 The social essence of this ideological tendency is to, consciously or uncon-
 sciously, try and break away from the socialist path and practice the so-
 called liberal trend of capitalism in the political, economic, social and
 cultural spheres.   Therefore, we call it the ideological tendency of bour-
 geois liberalization.   Clearly understanding and grasping the significance
 and characteristics of this ideological tendency will help us to guard
 against the misuse of this concept and help us to pay attention to drawing
 clearly some important lines of demarcation.  For example, if a party member
 or a citizen criticizes a certain decision, a certain aspect of work or a
 certain responsible person of a certain party organization, he is exercising
 his legitimate democratic right and cannot be described as negating and
 opposing party leadership or as seeking bourgeois liberalization.  Also, the
 academic freedom and literary creative freedom protected by our constitution
 and law are essential to the development of science and art, and these are
 completely different from the bourgeois liberalization mentioned here.  No
 doubt it is necessary to properly solve the relations between collective
 planning and freedom of individual activity in scientific research organs and
 artistic undertakings and organizations, but generally speaking, this also
 does not involve the question of bourgeois liberalization.   Conversely, if
 anyone really wants to negate, oppose and undermine the socialist cause of
 China; negate, oppose and undermine the leadership of the Chinese Communist
 Party over China's socialist cause or try to replace socialism and the whole
 socialist system with the liberal system of the bourgeoisie, we must wage a
 struggle against him no matter how he defends himself.
 2.  An Analysis of "Unrequited Love" and "The Sun and the Man"
 The reason why we criticized the film script "Unrequited Love" and the movie
 "The Sun and the Man" based on it, is because they distorted the historical
 development of practical life in our society.  Actually, they negated social-
 ist China and the party leadership and propagated the "freedom" of the
 capitalist world.   In both "Unrequited Love" and "The Sun and the Man," the
 author and the film's director made use of contrasts and spared no efforts
 to propagate the following view to the people: The "gang of four" represents
 the Chinese Communist Party and the 10 years of chaos means socialism.   In
 socialist China, the Chinese people have not yet been emancipated and enjoy
 no freedom at all.  What they display are  ignorance and superstition.   The
 party and the people have not won an historical victory in their struggle
 against the "gang of four."  Therefore, there is not the slightest bright-
 ness and freedom in China and intellectuals deserve no better fate than

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 persecution and humiliation.  It seems that brightness and.freedom only exist
 in the United States and the capitalist world, where the fate and freedom of
 life enjoyed by intellectuals are the admiration of everyone.   Such a view-
 point is a typical manifestation of bourgeois liberal thinking.                         It is
 obvious that if we had failed to criticize "Unrequited Love" and "The Sun
 and the Man" and to educate people in our literary, art and ideological
 fields and the whole party through criticism so that they could enhance
 their capability to combat the tendency of bourgeois liberalization, it
 would have been difficult to maintain the socialist orientation of our
 literary and art cause and other causes.
 3.   On the Erroneous Tendency of Seeking Commercialization of Spiritual
 Products
 In our socialist society, just as do material products, most of our spiritual
 products circulate as commodities.  However, both the production of material
 and spiritual products should have the basic objective or satisfying the
 material and spiritual needs of the whole people.  To attain this basic
 objective, our departments in charge of spiritual production should not only
 increase the quantity of the spiritual products, but do their best to enhance
 quality.   In other words, we should make every effort to ensure that every
 spiritual product has patriotic, revolutionary and healthy ideological con-
 tent and that it spiritually provides people with aesthetic enjoyment and
 inspires strength so that they will strive to make progress.  At the same
 time, in spite of the fact that most spiritual products circulate as commodi-
 ties, no spiritual product can break away from its spiritual objective and
 be blindly commercialized.   In a word, the practice of "taking money as the
 be-all and end-all" is not allowed.   If we depart from the basic objective
 of satisfying the needs of the people and blindly seek commercialization, we
 are liable to deviate from the basic principle of socialism.   Then there
 would be no intrinsic difference between the spiritual production of our
 society and that of capitalist society.   In capitalist society, both the
 production of material and spiritual products is highly commercialized and
 seeking profit is the sole objective.   For the sake of making money, every-
 thing can be sold.   Even the intuitive knowledge of man, personal influence,
 and living bodies of human beings can be "freely" sold as commodities.  For
 the purpose of making profits, much spiritual production may unscrupulously
 produce various kinds of vulgar, philistine, decadent and reactionary
 spiritual products to corrode the spiritual world of the people basically
 without any interference.  The commercialization and liberalization of such
 spiritual products is one of the basic reasons why spiritual crisis occurs
 and cannot be avoided in the capitalist society.   At present, owing to
 shortcomings in their management systems and erroneous guiding ideology,
 .some of our departments in charge of spiritual production, such as the press,
 editorial sections of publishing houses, and literary and art units have
 followed the erroneous tendencies of seeking the commercialization of
 spiritual products to a certain extent.  They have defied the socialist
 principle of meeting the needs of the people who are engaged in moderniza-
 tion and failed to set high demands on publications and the ideological
 content of artistic activities.   Instead, they "have taken money as the
 be-all and end-all" so that some spiritual products which surely exercise

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 passive influence and corrode people's minds have prevailed in varying
 degrees.  Some people even advocated that our publication and cultural
 undertakings should not be run by the state and society alone and that free
 management by individuals should be allowed.  In the cultural field, such
 bourgeois liberal thinking and the spread of various erroneous viewpoints
 will play a role which cannot but encourage the spread of the tendency of
 bourgeois liberalization.  This is a matter which merits our close attention
 and should be truly corrected.
 4.   On the Problem of Criteria for Evaluating Literary and Art Works
 We should evaluate literary and art works from the two aspects--ideological
 content and artistic form.  Generally speaking, the ideological content of
 literary and art works involve a number of things, including political,
 social, philosophical, historical, moral and artistic viewpoints, and so
 forth.   Obviously, these viewpoints put forth in literary and art works are
 not abstract, but are connected with the truthfulness of life reflected by
 artistic images, subject matters, plots and art.  Therefore, we demand that
 while evaluating the ideological content of a work, apart from analyzing its
 political views and tendencies, we should also analyze its ideological con-
 tent in other respects and its understanding of the value of life.  Only thus
 can we reflect the overall ideological content of the work.  If we fail to do
 so, we are liable to regard literary and art works as the diagrams of certain
 political views.  With regard to literary and art works with very strong
 political tendencies, their ideological contents should not be restricted to
 political tendencies alone, unless they do not possess the characteristics
 of literary and art works in general.   Therefore, we should not reduce the
 ideological content of literary and art works to political viewpoints and
 tendencies alone (there is no doubt that revolutionary political viewpoints
 and political tendencies are absolutely important and necessary for a revo-
 lutionary writer).  We should not take the political criterion in isolation
 as the first criterion for evaluating literary and art works.   If we do so
 in a coercive fashion, we are liable to do things in an oversimplified and
 crude way in practice and obstruct literary and art creation and the healthy
 development of literary and art criticism.

 A PROBE INTO A DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR SOLVING THE FOOD PROBLEM--TALK ON
 EXPLOITING PROTEIN RESOURCES AND INCREASING THE UTILIZATION RATE OF PROTEIN
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 14-19
 [Article by Luo Jingba [5012 0513 2672]]
 [Text]   Editor's note:   This is a good article well
 worth reading.   It is clearly integrated, coherent and
 easy to understand.   In the light of the research find-
 ings of many scientists of our country and the actual
 condition of our agriculture, the article expounds
 penetratingly with simple language the thesis that
 China must take the road of giving first priority to
 plant protein and at the same time appropriately
 developing animal protein so as to meet the nutri-
 tional requirements of 1 billion people.
 Thousands upon thousands of comrades who do agricul-
 tural work and are related to agricultural production
 have too little knowledge of science on the one hand,
 and there is a lack of scientific and technical books
 which can quench people's thirst for knowledge on the
 other hand.  Therefore, all of us have, in fact, a
 scanty knowledge of such questions as why a man must eat
 and what feasible methods we should take to further solve
 the problem of feeding a population of 1 billion.  It
 seems to be a fantastic story which is hard to believe
 but which, in fact, is a living reality.   In this way,
 how can blindness not emerge in our work?  In order to
 get rid of blindness and enhance our consciousness,
 while earnestly implementing the various policies of the
 CCP Central Committee, we must attach great importance
 to the position and role of science and technology in our
 socialist modernization program and conscientiously study
 and master modern scientific and technical know-how.  It
 is hoped that the departments concerned, particularly the
 planning and agricultural departments and food and feeding
 industrial departments and the related scientific research
 institutions will seriously consider and study the propo-
 sals put forth by the article.

 People take food as everything.  The problem of how to feed a population of
 1 billion occupies a very important position in the development strategy for
 science and technology, the economy and society.
 Eating meets the man's needs for nutrition.  Man's needs for nutrition are
 diverse, but the most fundamental ones are for energy and protein.  At
 present, 80 or 90 percent of these two kinds of nutrition needed by our
 inhabitants are derived from cereals.
 According to a nationwide nutrition survey conducted by the health depart-
 ment and its affiliated organizations under the instruction of the State
 Scientific and Technological Commission in 1959 (Note:  Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, considerable improvements have
 been made in the nutrition of our people but the situation in which people
 lack protein has not changed fundamentally), every day every member of the
 urban and rural population absorbed on average 2,060 kilocalories of energy
 and 57 grams of protein.  With regard to the nutritional situation at that
 time, the supply of calories was 10.4 percent less than the standard require-
 ment and that of protein was 18.5 percent less.   In the southeastern and
 southwestern regions of the country, the people's principal food is rice,
 so the protein content is less, constituting on average only about 60 percent
 of the standard required supply.   It can thus be seen that in improving the
 people's nutrition, efforts should be made to solve the problem of protein.
 To this end, the writer of this article would like to discuss some of his
 tentative ideas on this problem.
 The general method for the developed countries to solve the problem of
 protein requirements is to substantially expand grain crops and to use 60 to
 70 percent of the output of cereals as fodder to develop animal husbandry.
 The average annual amount of grain per capita of countries such as the
 United States, Canada, Australia and Denmark is above 2,000 jin and that of
 the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia is around 1,500 jin.   Japan
 is an exception.  When Japan began to vigorously develop animal husbandry in
 1973,  the average per capita amount of grain was only 400 jin and it mainly
 depended on imported fodder for a solution of this problem.
 To reach the level of a per capita average of more than 1,500 jin of grain,
 there must be more cultivated land.   Our country has ?a large population but
 limited cultivated land.   Therefore, the development pattern of the developed
 countries does not suit China's national condition.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, there have
 been substantial advances in China's agricultural production.   Now every
 person has on average 650 jin of grain.  In accordance with the suggestions
 of the Chinese Society of Physiological Science, to meet the needs of man's
 body for thermal energy, it is enough for every person to have on average
 360 jin of processed grain a year.   So, in terms of nutriology, it is not
 difficult to meet the needs of the whole population of the country for heat
 energy.   The problem lies in the need for protein.

 The cell of all organisms consists of various kinds of protein.   Engels
 pointed out:   "Life is the mode of existence of proteins.  This mode of
 existence lies, in essence, in the constant self-renewal of the chemical
 components of these proteins."   ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3,
 p 120 Protein is the main constituent of the human body.    The growth and
 the daily and hourly metabolism of human beings need to be continuously
 replenished by protein.   The various kinds of protein are chemical compounds
 of macromolecule which are combined by more than 20 amino acids in accordance
 with a certain sequence of permutation and space structure.   The protein in
 the human body can be resolved into various amino acids through the functions
 of various enzymes, and the human body again forms the amino acids into
 different proteins according to its different needs.   There are eight amino
 acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body; they must be absorbed
 directly from food.  These amino acids are called essential amino acids;
 they are methionine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, theonine,
 trytophan and valine.  The remaining amino acids that can be synthesized by
 the human body itself are not the essential amino acids in food.   The human
 body forms the protein of the human body in a way that takes a kind of amino
 acid with the least content as the basic point and absorbs the various remain-
 ing amino acids in proportion.  Therefore, a so-called nutritional balance is
 in fact a kind of "short-line balance," that is, of these eight amino acids,
 any one which has insufficient content will interfere with the full utiliza-
 tion of the remaining amino acids.  These incomplete sets of amino acids
 cannot be formed into the protein of the human body but can only produce
 thermal energy.  They are wasted, so to speak.  Therefore, of the edible
 proteins, whether the proportion of the content of various amino acids is
 coordinated is a very important problem.  The nutritive value of the proteins
 whose various amino acids are in proportion is high and that of the proteins
 whose various amino acids are in disproportion is not high.   Therefore, in
 terms of modern nutriology, there is both the question of quantity and quality
 in the need of the human body for protein.   Generally speaking, every person
 needs on average more than 70 grams of protein a day.   This is a quantitative
 index.  Along with this, the eight essential amino acids contained in these
 proteins must be in a certain proportion and the proportion of any one of
 them cannot be too little, that is, the nutritive value must be complete.
 This is a qualitative index.   Protein from animal sources generally contains
 the eight amino acids needed by the human body, and particularly eggs and
 milk, in which the proportion of the eight amino acids is coordinated, pro-
 vide complete nutrition.   This is the fundamental reason why many developed
 countries attach importance to developing animal husbandry to solve the
 problem of edible protein.
 Exploit Protein Resources and Increase the Utilization Rate of Protein
 In considering solutions to the problem of the need of our people for pro-
 tein, it is necessary to give consideration to both quality and quantity and
 to try by every conceivable means to exploit protein resources and increase
 the utilization rate of protein.

 Raise the protein content of cereals and vegetables.  Raising the protein
 content of cereals through breeding work will help substantially improve
 the protein content of cereals and the nutritional level of cereals in terms
 of the quantity of protein.  Take wheat for example.  The protein content of
 wheat in the areas north of the Huanghe River is about 13 percent and that
 in the Changjiang River basin is 10 to 12 percent.  The protein content of
 the commodity wheat of the United States and Canada is, on the whole, 15
 percent and the protein content of some new varieties that have started to
 be popularized is 17 to 18 percent.   In England, the protein content of the
 latest experimental variety of wheat is 25 percent.  It can thus be seen
 that the potential for raising the protein content of cereals is fairly
 large.  In the past, in our breeding work, one-sided emphasis was put on
 output targets at the expense of the nutritive value of crops and of whether
 the crops suited the people's tastes.  In the future, more attention must be
 paid to the nutritive value of any new variety and to making a quantitative
 anslysis, and especially making an analysis of the protein content and the
 composition of amino acids.  This requires that agricultural scientific
 research departments and educational departments enhance the building of a
 specialized profession of nutrition.
 With regard to the food structure of our inhabitants, vegetables are second
 only to cereals.   By and large, the protein content of vegetables is not
 high, but the protein content of fresh mushrooms is about 3.5 percent, much
 higher than that of common vegetables (the protein content of Beijing
 cabbage is 1.1 percent and that of radishes is 0.6 percent).   In the process
 of growth, mushrooms can use the cellulose of plant straws and seed shells
 for nutrition.   None of these things can be digested and absorbed directly
 by the human body.  Therefore, culturing mushrooms by using wood-wool,
 cottonseed shell and cow dung as a culture medium is an important way to
 increase the sources of protein.  At present, the world annual output of
 mushrooms is over 1 million tons.   In the United States, some people predict
 that fungus food will become one of the main foodstuffs in the 21st century.
 Many units in the cities of our country have begun to produce various edible
 fungi.   The annual output of edible fungi of Fujian Province is 40,000 tons
 and that of Shanghai is 6,000 tons.   They are mainly for export.   The cul-
 turing of mushrooms must be done under certain conditions, but it requires
 comparatively little investment and promises fairly quick. results.   It is a
 kind of labor-intensive and intellect-intensive production, and is in a
 position to provide jobs for quite a few youths waiting for employment.
 Some people say it is a kind of "urban agriculture" which has a great future.
 The underground civil defense projects in many cities of our country can be
 used for producing mushrooms.   However, at present the output of the cultur-
 ing of mushrooms is not high and the production costs are relatively expen-
 sive.   This problem needs to be solved through scientific research.
 In developing a diversified economy in the rural areas, it is imperative to
 make the exploitation of protein resources as an important goal.   Special
 attention should be devoted to the utilization of hills, lakes and ponds
 as well as sea mud and to the planting and gathering of crops and fruits
 which have a rich protein content, such as Chinese chestnut, walnut, oil-tea
 camellia, mudou [2606 6258], shiny-leaved yellowhorn, olive, water caltrop

 and kelp. Most of the seeds of oil-bearing crops have both a high fat and a
 high protein content.   Developing these plants will provide people with 'the
 most needed protein and fats.  This can kill two birds with one stone.
 Particular importance should be attached to it.
 Revive the acreage planted to soybeans and develop the soybean food industry.
 Soybeans contain about 40 percent protein and around 20 percent fat.  Of the
 amino acids in the protein of soybeans, besides the fact that the methionine
 content is relatively poor, the content of the remaining essential amino
 acids is relatively high.   Therefore, soybean is a grain crop with high
 protein and high fat content, and is a crop which has a relatively complete
 nutritive structure.
 Our country was the origin of soybeans and is called "the land of soybeans."
 China's acreage under soybeans in the 1930's totaled 220 million mu.  Both
 the output and export volume of soybeans constituted 90 percent of the world
 total.  This figure began to decline in the 1940's but gradually increased
 after the founding of the PRC.   The soybean output in 1956 was 20.4 billion
 jin and the acreage under soybeans in 1957 was revived to 190 million mu.
 However, by the 1960's and 1970's, as the result of one-sidedly concentrating
 on grain output and denouncing soybeans as a "low-yielding crop," the acreage
 under soybeans and the soybean output had dropped by a big margin.   The
 acreage under soybeans dropped to a minimum level of 100 million mu and the
 minimum annual output was 14 billion jin.   Besides, precisely at this time,
 the world output of soybeans increased far more rapidly than that of other
 grain crops.   The total world soybean output in 1949 was only 24.8 billion
 jin, but by 1979 it had increased to 188.3 billion jin, an increase of 6.6
 times over the 1949 figure.  The soybean output of the United States in the
 same period increased by 9.7 times and its acreage under soybeans rose from
 several million mu to 440 million mu, constituting over 14 percent of the
 acreage under grain crops, and its total output was 121.7 billion jin.
 Brazil began to import soybean seeds from our country in 1960.  In 1970, its
 acreage under soybeans was no more than 20 million mu and its annual output
 was 3.1 billion jin, but in 1977 its acreage under soybeans was developed to
 100 million mu and its annual output was 25 billion jin, thus becoming the
 second largest soybean-producing country in the world.
 Is soybean really a "low-yield crop"?  Calculated in terms of output alone,
 the output of soybeans is really lower than that of other grain crops (for
 instance, in 1980 the average per mu yield of paddy rice was 550 jin; that
 of corn, 410 jin; that of wheat, 250 jin; and that of soybeans, 146 jin).
 However, judged from the point of view of nutriology and economic results,
 soybeans can by no means be called a low-yield crop.  Compared with soybeans,
 the protein content of corn is usually around 8 percent.  The protein of
 1 jin of soybean is equal to the protein of 5 jin of corn, and furthermore
 the quality of soybean protein is far superior to that of corn.  According
 to the calculations of scientists, the application of every 1,000 kilo-
 calories of energy to 1 mu of land sown with corn will achieve an additional
 increase of 2.69 kilograms, and the application of the same quantity of
 energy to soybean production will achieve an additional increase of 1.43
 kilograms.   The increased amount of soybeans is not as large as that of corn

 but, calculated in terms of protein content, the protein content of corn is
 only 215 grams while that of soybeans is 514.8 grams.  The protein content
 of soybeans is substantially higher than that of corn.  According to data
 of the United States, the beef provided by 1 hectare of land sown with
 fodder grass can only meet the protein requirements of one person for 77
 days; that provided by 1 hectare of land sown with wheat, for 877 days; and
 that provided by 1 hectare of land sown with soybeans, for 2,224 days.
 There is a lack of protein in our people's nutrition, so more importance must
 be attached to soybean production.  For this purpose, we propose that before
 1985, China's acreage under soybeans be restored to the level of the 1960's,
 that is, 150 million mu, and that by 1990, to the level of the 1950's, namely,
 200 million mu, comprising about 10 percent of the acreage under grain crops.
 China has always attached adequate importance to the planting of grain crops
 rather than soybeans.  The cultivation of soybeans has been invariably
 extensive.   Therefore, the potential for increasing the yield per unit area
 is enormous.  At present the average world per mu yield of soybeans is 200
 jin.  If we can reach this level by 1990 through ameliorating varieties and
 improving cropping techniques, then our country will be able to produce 40
 billion jin annually and to reach an average of 37 jin per person, the level
 we attained in the 1950's.  China's commodity base of soybeans is.in the
 northeast.   There is still enormous potential for increasing production
 there.   Soybean is a hydrophilous crop.   There are bright prospects for
 rotating soybeans with corn, cotton and other crops in the Huanghe River and
 Huaihe River basins; for interplanting soybeans with dry crops, such as corn
 and tea, in the south and for dibbling soybeans in parcels of land scattered
 around fields.  This will both boost production and improve the soil through
 the fixation of nitrogen resulting from soybean root-nodule bacteria, thus
 contributing to putting an end to the decline of soil fertility.  Therefore,
 gradually restoring and developing soybean production is an important
 measure for achieving many things at one stroke.
 China has a fine tradition of processing soybeans.   It has more than 100
 varieties of bean products and fermented bean products.  Most of them are
 conducive to raising the nutritional value of soybeans.  At present a "craze
 for bean curd" has arisen in the United States and other countries in the
 West, a craze in which people like to eat Chinese-style bean products.   Over
 the last few years, along with the advances in food-processing techniques
 and under the influence of modern nutriology, some countries, such as the
 United States, have been substantially developing the production of soybean
 protein.   For example, there are nonfat soybean protein, enriched soybean
 protein, separated soybean protein, tissue soybean protein and others.
 Apart from the nutritive structure of soybeans, such as the inhibitor of
 trypsin, haemagglutinin, saponin, and gas-producing factors of intestines
 and stomach,  these processed products increase nutritive value.   They are
 widely mixed into meat, drinks, bread and refreshment products, artificial
 cream and other foodstuffs.  According to statistics, at present in the
 world there are more than 12,670 kinds of foodstuffs which contain soybean
 protein.   In the United States, every year 1.4 million tons of soybean
 protein are added to 16 kinds of foodstuffs;  In order to raise the nutri-
 tive value of soybeans, we must carry on the traditional processing tech-
 nology of soybeans and at the same time vigorously develop the soybean food
 industry.

 Nearly half of the 15 billion jin of soybeans China now produces every year
 is used for extracting soybean oil.   In the past, large quantities of soy-
 bean protein, which could have been digested by man and animals, became
 compounds which could not be digested and absorbed because of the improper
 use of heating in the process of extracting oil both by. indigenous methods
 and machines.   There were similar cases in the process of extracting oil
 from peanuts, cottonseed, rapeseed and others.   This was a great waste of
 protein resources.  It is necessary to be resolute in transforming our fat
 industry and to adopt advanced dipping processes, and while extracting fat
 we must try our best not to destroy protein.  There are some problems calling
 for further study and solution in the choice of solvents, precipitation,
 deodorization and other processing techniques.   In our country at present,
 most of the bean dregs left over after extracting oil are used as fodder.
 It is imperative to find new ways to use some of them directly as raw mate-
 rials for producing foodstuffs, such as synthetic meat, bean powder, bean
 curd, and salted and fermented soy paste.
 Revive and develop compound foods, such as mixed-grain flour, nutritious
 bread and fortified food.  As we mentioned above, the nutritive value of
 protein is determined by whether the amino acids of which it is composed
 are in proportion.  At present the main sources of protein for our people
 are cereals.   In accordance with the principle of "short-line balance," in
 the protein of cereals,  the lysine content is exceedingly scarce, which
 affects the role of the remaining amino acids.   Lysine became the first
 amino acid which restricted the nutritive value of cereal protein.   The
 recent experiment of the Nanning Maternity and Child Care Hospital in
 Guangxi shows that food mixed with two permils of lysine resulted in marked
 improvements in children's weight, height and health conditions compared with
 the control group in the experiment.  It is known to all that in soybean
 protein, lysine is relatively plentiful.  Mixing a certain amount of soybean
 powder into corn by utilizing the principle of nutrients complementing each
 other can raise nutritive value.  People in the north have the habit of
 using mixed-grain flour.  We must adopt measures to revive this tradition in
 grain processing.   This is the most practical and effective way to increase
 the utilization ratio of plant protein.   In our country the nutritive value
 of the composition of mixed-grain flour is as follows:
 Mixed flour    Mixed flour    Mixed flour

 Although the nutritive value of soybean protein is relatively high, the
 methionine content of soybean protein is still relatively low compared with
 animal protein and the protein from milk resources.  Therefore, to bring
 into full play the nutritive value of such plant proteins as soybean, it is
 necessary to add a certain amount of methionine.  Modern science enables the
 synthesis of the eight essential amino acids through biological methods such
 as fermentation and chemical synthetic methods.  China's problem of producing
 these amino acids for medical use has now been basically solved.   China has
 experimental factories with a total production capacity of 3,000 tons of
 edible lysine and lysine for fodder per year.  However, other problems, such
 as the purification of these amino acids, have not been completely solved.
 Methionine has been produced on a small scale, but its price is nearly 10
 times higher than that of imported methionine. We hope that the state will
 organize its forces to tackle key problems in scientific research in this
 respect and be determined to promptly set up several big factories each with
 an annual 10,000-ton plus production capacity in the period of the seventh
 5-year plan.  By so doing, we can substantially raise the nutritive value of
 our existing plant protein.   This would be a major step in solving the prob-
 lem of feeding a population of 1 billion.   It needs an investment of only
 several hundred million yuan but promises fairly great economic returns.   So
 we must make early preparations for it.
 Develop the feed industry and improve the level of production of animal
 husbandry.   According to study and research, the portion of solar energy
 transferred and utilized by crops in the process of their growth which can
 be directly utilized by the human body is only about 25 percent.   It is only
 through animal husbandry that the remaining 75 percent (straw, stems and
 leaves as well as bran and others) can be transformed into animal protein,
 fat and so forth which can be utilized by the human body (of these materials,
 such as straw as well as stems and leaves, which constitute the 75 percent of
 energy, animals can digest and utilize only 25 percent and a considerable
 part of the remaining 75 percent becomes organic fertilizer which will become
 useful material to the human body through transformation by plants).   This
 is the fundamental reason why we must give equal priority to both agriculture
 and animal husbandry and make strenuous efforts to develop animal husbandry.
 In developing animal husbandry, it is necessary to pay attention to
 nutriology.   The needs of animals for nutrition are the same as humans, that
 is, mainly energy and protein.   Energy fodder and protein fodder constitute
 the principal part of fodder.   Judged by a comprehensive survey of our fodder
 supplies, in the past importance was attached one-sidedly to the supply of
 energy at the expense of the supply of protein.   The failure to ensure a
 proportionate supply of protein made animals unable to fully utilize the
 energy provided and thus resulted in the high "ratio between fodder and meat"
 (that is, several jin of fodder producing 1 jin of meat) in China's animal
 husbandry.   High costs interfered with its development.   For instance, in the
 past, in breeding pigs, we one-sidedly concentrated on the amount of grain and
 green fodder used for feeding pigs, but neglected the amount of energy and
 protein contained in the grain and green fodder and the proper proportion
 between the two.   In the 1960's and 1970's, for a while we went in for
 saccharified pig feed in a big way, but there remained the problem of energy

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 fodder.   One of the important reasons why our pigs provide more fat meat
 rather than lean meat is, apart from the factor of the breed of pig, that
 we have insufficient protein fodder.
 In order to give full play to the role of fodder grain and green fodder, it
 is necessary to try in every possible way to exploit protein fodder resources
 and to enthusiastically develop mixed feed, compound feed and whole feed.
 Such being the case, we must develop the feed industry in a planned and
 vigorous way in the light of local conditions.  This is the road we should
 follow in accelerating the development of animal husbandry and increasing
 its economic return.
 How should protein fodder resources be exploited?   There is a lot we can do
 in this respect.  They are mainly as follows:
 1.   Fully utilize various existing cakes and dregs.  Our fat industry pro-
 duces nearly 20 billion jin of various cakes and dregs a year, some of which
 generally contain 20 to 50 percent protein.  However, at present more than
 half of the cakes, such as rapeseed, peanut and cottonseed cakes, are used
 directly as manure.   In our country, it is impossible to completely refrain
 from using the various cakes and dregs as manure for the time being, because
 some cake fertilizers must still be applied to some industrial crops.  How-
 ever, it must be realized that by not first using most of the cakes and
 dregs as feed and then using the waste of poultry and livestock as manure
 we are wasting protein resources.  We must gradually change this situation
 and strive to make more cakes and dregs than we have at the moment so that
 they become a source of protein feed in the feed industry through simple
 detoxification processes.
 2.   Make full use of leftover bits and pieces, such as animal blood, flesh,
 bones, skin and pupas, from the meat-processing factories, slaughterhouses,
 fish-processing stations, and filatures of the cities and the countryside
 and turn them into various kinds of protein powder through processing.
 3.   Make use of industrial liquid waste and waste heat to develop unicellular
 fodder protein from fodder yeasts and nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae.
 4.   Produce lysine, methionine and various fodder vitamins and biotins and
 use them as the nutritive additives of feed so as to increase the utiliza-
 tion ratio of various kinds of protein of the feed industry.
 5.   Strengthen the study of mycelial protein, which uses petroleum and
 natural gas as raw materials, and develop the petroleum protein industry
 step by step.
 To sum up, we should take the road of giving first priority to the develop-
 ment of plant protein and at the same time developing animal protein.   This is
 a development strategy for solving the food problem, a strategy which suits
 China's national condition.

 The road of giving priority to the development of animal protein which is
 being taken by the developed countries is in fact a road of using plant
 protein as feed to meet the nutritional requirements of human beings through
 the intermediary of transformation by livestock and poultry.  This inter-
 mediary transformation is fairly inefficient (Note:  According to study and
 research, the transformation rate of pigs is 18.3 percent; that of cows, 12.1
 percent; that of milch cows, 25.3 percent; that of layers, 21 percent.  That
 is to say, out of every 100 jin of plant protein, only about 20 jin can be
 transformed into animal protein and the remaining 80 percent can be used only
 as manure) and causes a lot of waste.  This should not be taken as a model by
 our country, a country which has a large population but limited usable land.
 Compared with plant protein, animal protein contains relatively complete
 nutrition.   However, under the guidance of modern nutriology, we can develop
 compound food by mixing several plant proteins which contain different pro-
 portions of amino acids, thus enabling the plant proteins to complement each
 other and maintain a nutritional balance.  We can develop fortified food,
 produce lysine and methionine, which plant protein lacks, with industrial
 methods and mix them into various plant proteins according to the proportion
 of amino acids in eggs and milk so as to raise their nutritive value.
 The road of giving priority to the production of animal protein which is
 being taken by the developed countries provides relatively good nutrition
 but also has side effects which easily give rise to diseases, such as
 coronaries and obesity (Note:  These side effects have become an important
 topic of social concern in the United States and Western Europe.   Many
 scientists put forward plans for food structure which are aimed at reducing
 animal protein and increasing plant protein.  Formerly, Japan's food struc-
 ture was relatively similar to that of China.   But over the last 2 decades,
 the food structure.of Japan has advanced in the direction of giving priority
 to the development of animal protein, a road similar to that taken by the
 developed countries.  According to recent investigations in Japan, 10 percent
 of Japanese youngsters suffered from high cholesterol.   The shortcomings of
 this food structure can thus be fairly easily seen).   Our country has a
 tradition of putting a vegetarian diet in first place.   For this reason, we
 have basically avoided these side effects.  However, incomplete nutrition of
 plant protein will also interfere with the improvement of the people's
 constitutions.   The road we have proposed can simultaneously overcome the
 shortcomings in these two aspects.  Of course, we do not in the least mean
 that we can neglect to expand the production of animal protein and the
 development of the production of animal husbandry and fishery.   No mis-
 understanding is expected on this point.
 To take this road, we must judge the value of various crops in accordance
 with nutriology rather than the output of the crops, and readjust the
 overall crop pattern and the whole agricultural structure of our country in
 a planned and orderly way.   To take this road, we must mobilize the indus-
 trial and agricultural forces and the urban and rural forces to give equal
 priority to both industry and agriculture, to combine the city and the
 countryside, and to unite in our efforts to solve the food problem.

 country.  Before the early 21st century, in view of the significant break-
 throughs in science, such as biological fixation of nitrogen, genetic engi-
 neering and the synthesizing of protein, it will be possible to further
 improve the protein nutrition of the inhabitants of our country.

 RECTIFY THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE, DEVELOP CONSTRUCTION IN MOUNTAIN AREAS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 20-24
 [Article by Tie Ying [6993 3841]]
 [Text]  Within Zhejiang Province there is an endless chain of rolling hills
 and a wide expanse of mountainous terrain, all of which are rich in
 resources.   But, compared with the plains, the mountain areas are relatively
 backward both economically and culturally.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, construction
 in Zhejiang's mountain areas has taken a turn for the better.  A marked
 change has taken place in the poverty-stricken and backward appearance of
 these areas.  After more than 3 years of hard work, grain output in the
 areas has increased.  Diversified economic forms have vigorously developed.
 Forestry production has achieved a definite degree of recovery and progress.
 Many communes, production brigades and production teams have begun to show
 signs of affluence.   In 1981, compared with 1978, in the 26 counties of the
 mountain areas of the entire province, the gross output value of agriculture
 increased by 23.4 percent; the area planted with tea increased by 200,000 mu
 and the gross tea-leaf production increased by 51 percent; nearly 100,000 mu
 of land were added to the mulberry fields and the gross silk output in-
 creased by 60.8 percent; over 98,000 mu of land were added to the orange
 orchards and the gross orange output increased by over 3 times; the number
 of pigs, cattle and sheep increased respectively by 17, 3, and 14 percent,
 and the number of rabbits bred increased by 1.8 times; the gross industrial
 output value of the communes and production brigades or teams increased by
 1.5 times; the installed generating capacity of small hydropower units
 increased by 58 percent; and 356 mu of land were afforestated.  As a result
 of the development of diversified economic forms, the total quantity of
 state purchases of agricultural and sideline products increased by 57 per-
 cent.  The standard of living of commune members was greatly improved.   The
 per capita grain ration apportioned by the collectives increased from 525 jin
 to 567 jin; the per capita income distributed by the collectives increased
 from 79 yuan to 96 yuan; and, with income from household sideline production
 added, the per capita income amounted to 165 yuan and was as high as 280 yuan
 in some of the more affluent counties.

 Reviewing the actual practice in the last 3 years and even over the past 20
 years and more, we have come to fully realize that in order to develop con-
 struction in the mountain areas, the most basic conditions are that the
 ideological line must be rectified, that understanding must conform with
 reality, that guidelines and policies must also conform with reality, and
 that we must work in strict accordance with natural laws and economic laws.
 I.  Correctly Understand and Handle the Relationship Between the 70 Percent
 Mountains and 20 Percent Farmland; Put Construction in Mountain Areas in a
 Strategic Position
 Zhejiang Province has a total area of 100,000 square kilometers of which
 mountain areas comprise about 70 percent, the plains areas about 23 percent
 and inland waterways about 7 percent.  We generally speak of this situation
 as "70 percent mountains, 10 percent rivers and 20 percent farmland."
 Unfortunately, a great proportion of the mountain areas is economically
 backward and can produce little wealth or affluence.  Take the 26 mountain
 counties for example:  The gross value of their agricultural and industrial
 output in 1978 was only 16.67 percent of that of the province as a whole.
 Formerly, many people considered the mountain areas as a burden and as a
 factor slowing the economic development of the whole province.   Influenced
 by this idea, they frequently focused their attention on the plains,
 loosened their leadership work over the mountain areas and neglected con-
 struction in these areas.   Some comrades in leadership organs seldom went
 to mountain areas to investigate or to do research, and many of the poli-
 cies and measures were not in conformity with the realities of the mountain
 areas.  Some comrades working in the mountain areas even "failed to see the
 mountains when opening their doors and did not care for the mountains even
 though they lived there." This was a one-sided and static viewpoint, and
 was the main ideological reason for the failure to develop construction in
 the mountain areas.
 After the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, in dis-
 cussing the problem of developing a true standard which links together
 realities and summing up past experiences and lessons, we brought up the
 problem of studying anew the provincial conditions of Zhejiang.  We empha-
 sized the need to adopt a viewpoint calling for all-round development in
 treating the realities of the province.   Everybody felt that despite the
 length of time we have worked in this province, some for a few years and
 some for over a decade, or as many as several decades, we still lack a
 clear understanding of Zhejiang's realities and its natural conditions and
 resources.   This being the case, we are unable to offer correct guidelines
 or adopt appropriate measures.  We cannot display our talents or evade
 shortcomings.   We are bound to meet with setbacks.   We have to take a zig-
 zag course and thus waste time and miss chances.  We have been saying all
 along that Zhejiang Province is a "land of plenty and the kingdom of wealth
 and affluence."  Naturally this is all true and reflects Zhejiang's special
 attributes and superior features.  At present, people of the entire province
 depend on the plains as the source of their food and clothing while the
 state also counts on the plains for part of its revenue.  Hereafter,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 construction of the four modernizations in Zhejiang will have to depend on
 bringing the advantageous conditions and active role of the plains into
 full play.  However, to stress the plains alone is not sufficient.  The
 plains have a big population but little land.  Comparatively speaking, the
 ground left unused is far less than that in the mountain areas.  At the same
 time, economic construction in the plains cannot be separated from the
 mountain areas.  The mountain areas must be depended upon for the supply of
 certain essential raw materials for industry, for construction materials, and
 for other important resources and materials.  At present, very little of the
 aboveground or underground resources of the vast mountain areas has been
 opened up or utilized.  In counties in the lower productive category, the
 output value per mu of hilly land ranges from 1 to 2 yuan while in counties
 in the higher productive category it is 6 to 7 yuan.  The province has
 8 million mu of hilly land suited to forest development.  If a third of
 this land is subjected to intensive farming, then its gross output value
 would be equivalent to that of the present 27 million mu of cultivated land
 in the whole province.   This shows that the hidden potential of mountain
 areas far surpasses that of plains.  Mountains, rivers and farmland depend
 on each other and condition each other to form an integrated whole.  The
 waterway system in Zhejiang Province has the defects. of insufficient water
 at the source and too rapid a water flow,.  Because of this, the heavy ero-
 sion of soil and silt from the upper reaches of the rivers seriously damages
 farmland along the lower reaches.  At present, many rivers have become more
 .shallow and their navigable parts have been shortened.  Much silt has
 collected in water reservoirs.  A great proportion of farmland suffers from
 the threat of drought or waterlogging.  All these things are the dire con-
 sequences of the prolonged neglect of construction work in the mountain
 areas.
 Having rectified their ideological line, the provincial party committee and
 the provincial people's government adopted a series of measures to strengthen
 construction in the mountain areas.   One of the measures is to make clear to
 all the idea of making construction in the mountains a strategic focal point
 in the construction of the four modernizations in the whole province and
 treating it as a promising factor in enriching the province.   The party com-
 mittees and people's governments at various levels have been requested to
 pay due regard to both the mountains and the sea.   The second measure
 adopted is that organs ranging from the provincial to the county level have
 on various occasions conducted large-scale investigation of the mountain
 areas.  In 1980 alone, throughout the province some 30 investigation teams,
 accompanied by the leadership, went to the mountain villages to conduct
 investigation and research.   They produced several scores of investigative-
 reports touching on conditions in the areas, analyzing them, and making
 recommendations.   Still another measure adopted was the convening of two
 provincial work meetings on mountain areas.   The meetings specially dwelt
 on the significance, the guidelines and the policy for construction in the
 mountain areas.   Following the second work meeting on mountain areas,  the
 province organized over 20,000 cadres to proceed to the communes and produc-
 tion brigades in the areas to establish authority, to issue permits and
 licenses, and to enforce the production responsibility system in the
 mountain and forest areas.  The fourth measure taken was to take various

 steps to aid the development of the economy of the mountain areas such as
 providing guidance, economic policies and financial and material support.
 II. Correctly Understand and Handle the Contradiction Between Forestry and
 Grain; Determine the Production Guidelines for the Mountain Areas According
 to Local Conditions
 For a prolonged period of time the poverty-stricken and backward appearance
 of the mountain areas has not been changed and the practice of deforestation
 and reclamation has not been checked.  What is the reason for this?   In the
 past, we simply ascribed this phenomenon to the struggle between the two
 classes and the two lines but failed to look to the production guidelines
 to find the reason.   Just what should be the guidelines for production in
 mountain areas?  For a long time there has been much discussion on this
 topic, but so far a correct answer has not been found.   In the investiga-
 tion of mountain areas it has been found, in all places, that the contradic-
 tion between forestry and grain constitutes a practical problem that cannot
 be avoided.   In the past, we neglected the realities of mountain areas.  We
 copied in full the slogan of the plains to take "grain as the key link."  In
 some localities, the unrealistic suggestion was made that "peasants in the
 mountains should not eat any commercial grain" and that "in several years'
 time we would be able to lift off the 'cap' of grain deficiency."  In the
 process of examining, appraising and comparing the performance of peasants,
 only the quantity of grain output was taken into consideration, while the
 quantity of output of mountain and forest products was ignored.  In this
 way the-cadre masses in the mountain areas were subjected to great pressure.
 Manpower and material resources in the mountain areas were not used in the
 mountains, or in afforestation, or in promoting the development of the
 processing of the special products of forests.  Rather, they were used in
 opening up mountains and reclaiming farmland, which, in effect, only
 "bothered the people and wasted public funds."  Such conditions as weather,
 sunshine, soil composition and water resources in mountain areas were totally
 ignored, and the "triple cropping" system and planting of "double-crop" rice
 were uniformly practiced.   In arranging production tasks, the guidance given
 was not in accordance with different categories or localities and scant
 attention was paid to work in mountain areas.  Quoting cadres in the mountain
 areas, "Water buffaloes and oxen basked side by side in the sunshine."  This
 guidance policy, which obviously violated objective laws, has had serious
 consequences.  In some localities, reclamation work was carried out on
 mountain tops and the mountains were denuded of perfectly good forests.  This
 caused serious soil erosion, closed forest production channels, and dampened
 the enthusiasm of the masses.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP.Central Committee, we have
 summed up the experiences and lessons derived from these sources and come to
 the understanding that one logical premise for transforming this malignant
 -cycle to a benign cycle in production in mountain areas is to pay due atten-
 tion to the contradiction between forestry and grain and to correctly handle
 the relations between developing grain production and developing the economy
 in the mountain areas.   People in the mountain areas must fill their stomachs.
 Hence, grain production should be developed.   But how can this objective be

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 achieved? If we disregard the realities of mountain areas and one-sidedly
 stress the principle of "taking grain as the key link," and if we squeeze
 out the special products of mountains and forests, disrupt the ecological
 balance of mountain areas and adopt a farming system not in conformity with
 the realities of the localities, or, in other words, adopt a guideline of
 subjectivism, then the result will be_barren hills, poor soil, poverty-
 stricken collectives, empty family coffers and a still lagging grain output.
 The years will roll by, but the situation of dependence on resold grain will
 stubbornly remain.   People in mountain areas not only do not have money to
 spend but their grain ration is also very low.  Before 1978, all those
 people in our province receiving an average income distribution from the
 collectives of 50 yuan or less and an average per capita grain ration of
 450 jin or less, lived in counties in mountain areas.  Commencing in 1979,
 we made it perfectly clear that, in general, communes and production brigades
 in the mountain areas should take forestry as their major profession but,
 since conditions vary, those suited to forestry should adhere to forestry,
 those suited to agriculture should take up agriculture, and those suited to
 animal husbandry should take up animal husbandry.   To give people in mountain
 areas a chance to recuperate, reclamation was gradually stopped and affores-
 tation.was gradually resumed.   The provincial people's government gave
 several hundred million jin of grain to be used for reducing the agricul-
 tural tax, reducing the state purchases and increasing sales, and subsi-
 dizing afforestation.  Concerning grain production in mountain areas, the
 former uniformity in farming was abandoned and in its place a farming system
 suited to the special features of mountain areas was adopted.   In some
 localities,  the triple-crop system was changed to the double-crop system,
 while in other localities the planting of rice in paddy fields was changed
 to the planting of dry grain.   The planting of beans and peas, potatoes,
 corn, sorghum, millet and other miscellaneous grains was promoted.  Thus,
 the road of grain production became increasingly broad.   In farmland capital
 construction, emphasis was put on transforming low-yield farmland.  The
 result of this work was that grain production increased.   The majority of
 mountain areas reported an increase in production every year, and the extent
 of the increase was much greater than that on the plains.  With the help of
 "support grain" from the state, the grain ration and fodder grain of the
 people in the mountain areas were both generally increased.   Qingtian County
 in the mountain area of southern Zhejiang Province used to feel a heavy
 burden in relation to grain.  All along it has tried to remove the "cap" of
 grain deficiency but grain production never increased.  Every year the county
 had to ask for an increase in "unified sales grain."  In the last 2 years,
 they adjusted their production guidelines to local needs.   They fully dis-
 played the superiority of mountain areas and, as a result, forestry and
 diversified economic forms developed while grain production also increased.
 In 1981, after retaining sufficient grain ration and fodder grain for their
 own needs, the county was able to sell an extra quantity of over 2.3 million
 jin of surplus grain and reduced the quantity of "unified sales grain" by
 7 million jin.   Thus, facts have amply justified that if, to start with, we
 can keep in mind the realities of mountain areas and work according to
 objective laws, it will be possible to solve the longstanding contradiction
 between forestry and grain.   Violating objective laws will result in both
 sides losing.

 III. Correctly Understand and Handle the Relationship Between "Long" and
 "Short" in Production in the Mountain and Forest Areas; Insist Upon Using
 the "Short" To Support the "Long" and on the Union of the Two
 The production cycle in mountain forests is a long one.   It differs from
 other agricultural production precisely because of this feature.  As the
 proverbial saying goes:   "One generation plants the trees under the shade
 of which another generation rests."  The forests that we have at present are
 mostly the fruits of the labor of our forefathers.  Our work in planting
 trees and afforestation today is intended in most part for the welfare of
 our children and grandchildren.  Once the forest resources are ruined,
 restoration will take several scores of years.  This special feature of
 production of the mountain forests requires that we adopt a guideline
 calling for union of the "long" and the "short."  On the one hand, we must
 protect the current interests of the masses in mountain areas in order to
 arouse their enthusiasm to devote their efforts to undertaking the building
 of timber forests which will not yield any benefits until a much later time.
 On the other hand, we must take a long-term view.   Starting from now, we
 should expand the area of afforestation year after year to achieve the
 objective of the continuous existence of green hills, good for use forever
 and ever.  We have consistently said:   "Support the 'long' with the 'short,'
 and effect the union of the 'long' and the 'short."'
 In the past, in planting trees and in afforestation, we gave preference to
 timber forests.   We began with the masson pine and followed up with the fir
 tree.  Certain results were achieved.   However, we did not at the same time
 get'a grip on the economic forests, which can produce much quicker results.
 In consequence, the economy of mountain areas became a single-product
 economy and the income of the peasants was very low.  Many cadres felt that
 "distant water cannot quench current thirst."  They despaired because they
 planted trees every year but failed to benefit by any results.
 Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, concurrently
 with getting involved with the construction of forest base areas, we have
 emphatically got involved with the production of special mountain area
 products which can yield benefits in a short time or even within a year.
 This was because we felt that forestry production in our province was making
 slow progress and that peasant families in mountain areas were generally
 weak financially and urgently desired an increase in their income and an
 improvement in their standard of living.   Counties in mountain areas
 analyzed the special features of the localities and summed up the experi-
 ences of certain advanced communes and production brigades which had trans-
 formed poverty into affluence.   They raised the slogan "Heal poverty and get
 rich."   For example, one slogan said:   "To make Xin Chang rich, try planting
 tea and raising rabbits."  Another slogan was:   "Lin An has three treasures:
 tea leaves, dried bamboo shoots and hickory nuts."  Many counties in mountain
 areas arranged "experience-exchange meetings" and printed and distributed
 small pamphlets.   Their leading cadres solicited advice from wise people
 while the populace offered schemes and propositions.  In short, a thousand
 ways and means were tried to open wide the door of production.   In order to
 encourage people in mountain areas to develop their special products,  the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 provincial people's government fixed definite base figures governing the
 quantity of the state purchases of such special products as tea leaves,
 silk, oranges, the "three seeds" (tung seeds, tea-oil seeds and tallow
 seeds), raw lacquer, and resin.  Surplus production of these products may
 be retained on a percentage basis.  Extra state purchases will be paid for
 at higher prices or by sales rewards of grain, chemical fertilizers, and
 cloth tickets.  As a result, in the last few years, there has been a boom-
 ing growth of such crops as tea, mulberry, tangerines, day lily and so on.
 Their growth rate has risen every year.  Take tea leaves for example:
 Production in the whole province in 1979 increased by 130,000 dan over that
 of 1978, the 1980 output increased by 200,000 dan over that of 1979, and the
 increase in 1981 over that of 1980 was 240,000 dan.
 As we see it now, the populace has showed a high degree of enthusiasm for
 developing the "short" but has not paid sufficient attention to developing
 the "long."  Thus, this requires that we guide the enthusiasm of the masses
 toward the development of timber forests and other products requiring some
 years for growth, and to really accomplish the objective of supporting the
 "long" with the "short."  In this connection, we must stress the adoption
 of the following measures:   First, based on the natural resources and
 economic conditions of the various localities, we must formulate a plan
 for the overall development of the economy in mountain areas.  The plan will
 grasp both the "long" and the "short."  It will capitalize on the "many" but
 will not lose sight of the "few."  The superiority of the localities will
 be displayed.   Second, we must adopt a correct policy.  Apart from giving
 special rewards for the purchases of certain special forest products, the
 policy we adopt must support the development of timber forests.   The require-
 ment is that the 300 people's communes in the mountain areas of the province
 develop, in the next 7 years, 5 million mu of timber forests.   Local finan-
 cial administrations will earmark a certain amount of funds to subsidize
 afforestation work.  Third, during the course of developing timber forests
 and bamboo production, we must also pay attention to the combination of the
 "long" and the "short."  For example, bases will be developed for the quick-
 growth and densely-grown fir,   so that in 3 to 5 years time the trees will
 be ready for intercutting.   In the bamboo hills, an area will be reserved
 specially for bamboo shoot production, so that the populace can more quickly
 reap the benefits and the development of "specialized bamboo hills" can be
 promoted.  Fourth, we must develop the comprehensive utilization of forestry
 and sideline products,  take the road of overall development of planting,
 growing, processing and marketing and endeavor to upgrade the economic
 value of mountain and forestry products.   Our province has abundant forest
 resources.  At the same time, its timber requirements are high, the extent
 of the extravagant use of timber is also great, and every year timber cutting
 far exceeds timber growth rate.  Hence, the comprehensive utilization of
 timber is all the more important.   Facts have also shown that much can be
 accomplished by comprehensive utilization.   A plant making boards from wood
 shavings in Longchuan County made use of tree tops, tree branches, wood
 shavings and tree bark to produce 8,000 cubic meters of wood-shaving boards
 every year.   This achieves savings of some 20,000 cubic meters of timber.
 Besides the comprehensive utilization of timber, the hidden potential is also
 very great for the comprehensive utilization of bamboo and other forestry

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 and sideline products.   Further processing work will enhance the value of
 these products.   If this job is done well, then we not only can convert
 "wastes" to "treasures" but also enable the large number of skillful   .
 artisans in mountain areas to display their skills.  Moreover, in so doing
 we can make and encourage the masses to treasure mountain and forest
 resources, to protect them, and to develop forestry production much more
 enthusiastically.  As a matter of fact, in this regard we still have a
 "weak link," and more efforts must be made.  Speaking from an even broader
 view, the opening up and construction of mountain areas should also include
 the tourist trade.   Zhejiang Province has a host of scenic spots.   Such
 tourist spots as Yandang Shan, Mokan Shan, Tianmu Shan, Putuo Shan, Fuchun
 River and Xinan River are known the world over.  If we can link the con-
 struction of mountain areas with the protection of natural resources and
 development of the tourist trade, we can surely attract an even larger
 number of tourists.
 IV.   Correctly Understand and Handle the Relationship Between Unified
 Operation and Dispersed Operations; Arouse the Enthusiasm of the Collective
 and the Individual Commune Members
 Communication is a difficult problem in the mountain areas.  Houses are
 widely scattered and production conditions are backward.  Developing con-
 struction there requires us to take two separate roads.   One is to arouse
 the enthusiasm of the collectives and to display the superiority of unified
 management.   The other is to arouse the enthusiasm of the individual commune
 members and display the good points of dispersed operations.
 In Zhejiang Province, the great majority of mountain areas suitable for
 afforestation are owned by production brigades or production teams.  Thus,
 with the exception of the self-retained hills of a small number of commune
 members, basically there is only one road to take, namely, that of unified
 operation by the collectives.   Moreover,  the production responsibility sys-
 tem in mountains and forests is not healthy.   In some forests, there has
 been excessive felling of timber and little afforestation work has been done.
 In particular, there are over 30 million mu of barren mountains and hills
 that are sparsely forested.  They have defied being "greened" for a long
 time.   This is a problem which urgently requires a solution in the construc-
 tion of mountain areas in our province.
 Following several years of actual practice, people on all sides have
 acquired a comparatively fuller understanding of the production responsi-
 bility system in agriculture.   But many cadres do not have any idea of how,
 taking into consideration the realities of mountain areas, to institute a
 production responsibility system there, and do not have a uniform under-
 standing of the problem.   Some cadres generalize that mountains and forests
 must be placed under unified management and operation.  They neglect the
 importance of arousing the enthusiasm of commune members in diversified
 operations.   Some comrades do not feel at all concerned about the sight of
 so many barren mountains, but when they hear that a portion of the mountains
 will be assigned to commune members to plant trees, they fear this and that.
 A large number of barren hills are in name under the management of and are
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100280001-7
 operated by the collectives.  In fact, no operation has been going on, and
 the collectives are not capable of doing this work.   On-the other hand, much
 labor power cannot find an outlet and cannot find places to work.  If such a
 situation persists, how will it be possible to make so many barren hills
 green?  Which is better--to have, or not to have, trees on mountains?
 Certainly, having trees there is much preferable.   If we can arouse the
 enthusiasm of both the collectives and the individual members to plant
 trees, this will create wealth for the state.  Our objective and our direc-
 tion should be toward all mountains being green, toward water in all rivers
 being clear and toward all mountain areas enjoying affluence.  All policies
 and measures beneficial to arousing the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation
 should be correct policies and measures.
 Judging from the experiences of certain localities in Zhejiang Province,
 taking the road to the development of forestry production cannot depend on
 a single "leg" in the form of the collectives alone, or on the "leg" of
 individual commune members alone.   Rather, both "legs" must be used to step
 .forward smoothly and quickly.   Having understood this point., people can then
 formulate concrete plans.  Measures suited to local conditions can be shaped
 and we can pursue diversified economic forms.   In mountain areas which are
 forested, an entire forest can continue to be placed under the unified
 management of the forest departments of production brigades or communes,
 or of their specialized teams or specialized units.   But the responsibility
 system of specialized contracting and linking remuneration to output must be
 instituted.   In the case of small forests, we can adopt the responsibility
 system of assigning the household, laborer, or unit full responsibility for
 task completion and linking remuneration to output.   Unified planning must
 be done for barren or sparsely wooded hills.   Apart from assigning some of
 them as self-retained hills for commune members, any hills which the collec-
 tive is capable of managing should be managed by the collective.   If the
 collective is incapable of doing the management work, then decisive measures
 must be taken and the responsibility for management must be assigned to the
 commune members, either singly by household or jointly by several households.
 There should be no change in the rights of ownership, but the household or
 households doing the planting or afforestation work should do the managing.
 The yield from interplanting or intercropping may be retained by the house-
 hold itself, but receipts from the commercial forest should. be divided on a
 percentage basis.   This should be a long-term arrangement and should not be
 readily changed.   In our opinion, the adoption of this policy can yield good
 results and involves no risk.   Once the enthusiasm of the vast masses has
 been aroused, there is hope for making the hills green.  We must emancipate
 our minds, carefully weigh advantages and disadvantages, decide on opportune
 times and brook no procrastination.
 In the last few years, we have done much work in the construction of mountain
 .areas and have achieved certain results.   However, in the economy of the
 entire province, forestry is still a weak link.   The "tree-cover" rate of
 forests is still relatively low, much soil has been eroded into waterways
 while the poor ecological condition has not been much improved.   The task of
 making Zhejiang green and of constructing the mountain areas of the province
 is still a difficult one.   We are determined to continuously rectify our

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 ideological line.  We will continue to conduct sufficient investigation and
 research so that we can understand better the realities of Zhejiang.  Based
 on a general survey of the natural resources, we will do a good job of
 agricultural division and will mobilize the various counties, municipali-
 ties, communes and production brigades to formulate plans for construction
 of mountain areas.  We will, in a down-to-earth way, endeavor to solve the
 problems confronting construction of mountain areas.   In working in Zhejiang
 Province, we must keep in mind the welfare of the people of the province.
 We must do good deeds for them.  We will do our utmost to quickly make the
 great earth green in Zhejiang.   We will make the mountain areas of the
 province more beautiful and wealthy and make the necessary contributions to
 the socialist construction of the motherland.

 HOW TO VIEW THE CHANGES IN PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 25-28
 [Article by Li Chengrui [2621 2052 3843] and Zhang Zhongji [4545 6945 1015]]
 [Text]   Since the convening of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP'
 Central Committee, the party and the government have, under the situation in
 which our state finances are still faced with many difficulties, taken vari-
 ous measures to improve the people's standard of living.  The broad masses
 of people are deeply conscious of and grateful for these measures.  But some
 people have raised some questions in this respect.   For example, how much
 has the people's livelihood been improved over the past 3 years?  Have
 increases in prices accorded with increases in wages?  Are we doing too much
 or too little in improving people's livelihood?  This article is intended,
 through facts and figures, to explain and probe into these questions.
 People's Livelihood Has Been Considerably Improved Since the 3d Plenary
 Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee
 For a long time in the past, because of the "leftist" mistakes and particu-
 larly because of the interference and sabotage by Lin Biao and the "gang of
 four" during the 10 turbulent years, our national economy was seriously out
 of balance and no appropriate measures were taken to improve the people's
 livelihood.   Following the downfall of the "gang of four" and particularly
 since the convening of the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Com-
 mittee,  the party and government has taken measures to restore order.
 "Leftist" mistakes have been corrected; the proportionate relations between
 agriculture, light industry and heavy industry and various economic policies
 have been readjusted; and agricultural production and the production of con-
 sumer goods have been developed in a big way.  At the same time, the exces-
 sively high accumulation rate has been lowered.  With regard to the use of
 national revenue, the proportion of accumulation has lowered from 36.5 per-
 cent in 1978 to less than 30 percent in 1981 while the proportion for con-
 sumption was increased from over 63.5 percent to over 70 percent.   Of the
 amount of capital construction investment in the units owned by the whole
 people,  the amount of the investments in production construction dropped
 from 82.6 percent in 1978 to 58.9 percent in 1981.  The investment in non-
 production construction such as that for housing, education, health and
 scientific research, and public utility undertakings increased from 17.4 to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 41.1 percent.  Over the past 3 years, the improvement in the people's mate-
 rial and cultural life is shown in the following:
 First, peasants'  incomes have increased drastically.   An investigation made
 of the incomes of more than 18,000 households of commune members in 536
 prefectures showed that the average per capita annual net income was esti-
 mated at more than 220 yuan, 80 yuan more than the 134 yuan in 1978, giving
 an annual increase of over 18 percent for 3 years.    Over the past 2 to 3
 years, great changes have taken place in both agricultural production and
 the livelihood of the commune members in some poor regions that were charac-
 terized by "relying on resold grain for food, on loans in production and on
 relief goods in livelihood."  Of the total investigated peasant households
 across the country, the proportion of households with difficulties and with
 average per capita income of less than 100 yuan has dropped from 33 percent
 in 1978 to less than 10 percent in 1981.
 The increases in the income of peasants is due on the one hand as a result of
 the implementation of the party's policies for rural areas and the introduc-
 tion of various forms of the production responsibility system and the devel-
 opment of diversified economic management, and this brought about increases
 in both production and income.   On the other hand, the state has increased
 the purchase prices of agricultural and sideline products and decreased some
 taxes in rural areas, and all these have also been helpful in increasing
 peasants' income.   During the 3 years between 1979 and 1981, the peasants
 across the country gained a total additional income of more than 50 billion
 yuan because of the increases in the purchase prices of agricultural and
 sideline products and decreases in taxes.
 Second, the income of workers and staff have increased.  According to an
 investigation of the income of the more than 8,700 workers and staff house-
 holds in urban areas in 46 municipalities across the country, the average
 per capita monthly amount of income that was used for living expenses in
 1981 was 38.6 yuan, 46.8 percent higher than the 26.3 yuan in 1978.  When
 this figure is reduced by the rate of increase in the cost of living of
 workers and staff, the actual increase in income would be 30.8 percent.  As
 the families of workers and staff have more income, the proportion of house-
 holds with an average monthly income to be used for living expenses of 20-25
 yuan has dropped to 5.4 percent of the total households.  The proportion of
 those with less than 20 yuan has dropped to 2.1 percent.
 Over the past 3 years,  the party has worked out and implemented various
 policies and measures to increase production and improve the standard of
 living of workers and staff.  These include opening up more channels for
 employment.   During these 3 years, more than 26 million people awaiting jobs
 have been employed.   The majority of the great number of such people who
 accumulated over many years have been given jobs.  With the expansion in
 employment,  the average number of people (including the workers and staff
 themselves) that are supported by each worker or staff member dropped from
 2.06 in 1978 to 1.77 in 1981.  This means that.the families of workers and
 staff have a lighter economic burden, their income has increased, and con-
 sequently this situation has promoted social stability and unity.   Second,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 the wages of some of the workers and staff members have been readjusted and
 the bonus system has been introduced.  The total wages paid by the units
 under the ownership of the whole people across the country and the units
 under collective ownership in cities and towns in 1981 came to 82 billion
 yuan, 25.1 billion yuan more than in 1978, with an average annual increase
 of 8.37 billion yuan.  The average wages of workers and staff in 1981 were
 772 yuan, 25.7 percent higher than the 614 yuan in 1978 and after deducting
 the cost of living  increase,  the actual wage increase was 11.9 percent.
 Third, the treatment of the cadres and workers and staff who have retired has
 been improved, and subsidies for family planning, having a single daughter or
 son, traveling expenses in visiting parents, traveling expenses in going to'
 and returning from work, and haircut subsidies have been increased.  All
 these mean an increase in the family income of workers and staff.  The total
 expenditure on the welfare of the workers and staff of the units under the
 ownership of the whole people were 6.7 billion yuan in 1978 and 11.6 billion
 yuan in 1980.   It further increased in 1981.
 Third, the consumption by the urban and rural population has increased.  Over
 the past 3 years, agricultural and sideline production and the production of
 daily consumer goods have increased, and consequently there are a greater
 quantity and more varieties of consumer goods on the market.  The total
 retail sale volume of social commodities in 1981 was 235 billion yuan, 50.7
 percent higher than the 155.9 billion yuan in 1978 (with a deduction for the
 increase in retail prices, the actual increase rate was 36.2 percent).  The
 volume of major food, clothing and daily-use commodities has also increased.
 The per capita grain consumption in the whole of 1981 was 12 percent higher
 than in 1978, the consumption of edible vegetable oil increased by 87 per-
 cent, that of pork increased by 44 percent and that of cloth increased by
 28 percent (the consumption of grain, edible oil, meat and cloth includes
 direct consumption by the population, the volume processed by catering,
 foodstuff and tailoring industries and publicly used cloth).  The number of
 sewing machines owned by every 100. persons increased from 3.5 to 5.5,
 bicycles from 7.7 to 11.1, watches from 8.5 to 15.7 and radios from 7.8 to
 14.9.   Some families already have the "four big pieces" and they are now
 adding several "new big pieces."  An investigation made of family incomes
 and expenditure of the workers and staff in urban areas showed that by the
 end of 1981, every 100 families on the average owned 58 television sets,
 43 electric fans, 6.3 washing machines, 13 tape recorders, 4.3 cameras,
 44 sofas and 86 big wardrobes.
 Now, the consumer products the urban and rural population eat, water and
 use have not only increased in volume but also in quality.  An investigation
 of the income and expenditure of commune members showed that the average per
 capita annual consumption of flour and rice in 1980 was 326 jin as against
 245 jin in 1978, while the figure for coarse food grains dropped from 251 jin
 to 188 jin (calculated on the basis of unprocessed food grains).   The con-
 sumption of quality commodities such as woolen fabrics, silks and satins,
 knitting wool and woolen sweaters  in 1980 more than doubled the figure in
 1978.  With regard to clothing, in the past people were mainly interested
 in buying cheap and yet durable clothes, but now they have turned to mainly
 buying good quality, new style and medium- and high-priced clothing.,

 Fourth, housing conditions have been improved.   Over the past 3 years, the
 state invested 29 billion yuan in housing; the floorspace of completed new
 housing facilities was 223 million square meters, an average of more than
 74 million square meters every year and 3 times higher than the average
 annual figure of 18 million-plus square meters during the 10 years of the
 "Great Cultural Revolution."  An investigation of the income and expenditure
 of the families of workers and staff in cities showed that the average living
 space of the members of such families increased considerably from 4.4 square
 meters in 1979 to 5.27 square meters in 1981.  A "fever of house building"
 has emerged in rural areas.   Having enough to eat and wear, many peasants
 have been developing their living conditions in a big way.  Expenditure in
 building houses made up 3.2 percent of the total consumption expenditure in
 1978 and jumped to 10.3 percent in 1981.  The total floorspace of houses
 built by peasants themselves over the last 3 years  was 1.4 billion square
 meters.  Now the average living space in rural areas is about 10 square
 meters.
 Fifth, the saving deposits of the urban and rural population have increased.
 The total savings deposits of the urban and rural population by the end of
 1981 were more than 52.37 billion yuan, 31.31 billion yuan more than those in
 1978 and an increase of 1.5 times.  The savings deposits of the urban popula-
 tion were 35.41 billion yuan, an increase of 1.3 times, while the savings
 deposits of the rural population were 16.96 billion yuan, double that of
 1978.   The increase in the deposits not only represent increases in the
 income of the population but also show that the people are fully confident
 in the development of our economy.
 The state has also strengthened the building of a commercial network and
 public utility facilities in urban areas so as to gradually relax such con-
 tradictions as the difficulties of finding a restaurant, buying vegetables,
 getting repairs done and riding on a bus.  Health and education undertakings
 have also been restored and developed.  The number of hospital beds and
 doctors at the end of 1981 was respectively 8.3 percent and 13.9 percent
 higher than in 1978; the number of college students was 1.28 million, an
 increase of 49.5 percent over the figure in 1978 and 33 percent more than
 1960 which witnessed the biggest number of the students prior to the
 "Great Cultural Revolution."  Polytechnic schools, broadcasting television
 universities, and spare-time industrial and agricultural education are
 developed vigorously.   People's cultural life has become more active, the
 circulation of newspapers, magazines and other publications has increased
 drastically and broadcasting undertaking has also developed rapidly.
 But we must understand that although the standard of living of our people
 has been improved considerably, it is not high enough and is unbalanced.
 At present, there are still a few peasants whose food problems have yet to
 be completely resolved and some workers and staff families are still living
 a fairly hard life.   It is still common for'the houses of workers and staff
 to be too crowded and the development of public utility facilities and
 scientific, cultural, education and health undertakings does not accord with
 objective needs.  All these have to be gradually resolved along with the
 development of the economy.

 The Growth in the Income of Workers and Staff Was Faster Than the Increase
 in Prices
 Some comrades have said that although the income of workers and staff have
 been increased over the past few years, the increases have been offset by
 increases in prices.  We have to concretely analyze the increases in prices.
 Generally speaking, it is true that market prices have increased over the
 past few years, but the prices of some industrial products were increased
 while the price of some other industrial products were decreased.   For
 example, the prices of cigarettes, wines, furniture, bambooware and woolen
 fabrics were increased, but the.prices of polyester and cotton fabrics, tape
 recorders,  television sets, electric fans, wristwatches, refrigerators and
 Western medicines were decreased.   The prices of state-rationed basic daily
 necessity goods such as grain and edible oil remained stable.  What the
 masses have complained much. about is the increases in the prices of vege-
 tables and nonstaple foodstuffs.  In addition, the nonstaple foodstuffs with
 state-fixed prices have been in short supply and consequently the commodi-
 ties with negotiated prices and those available in free markets have
 increased in quantity.   Therefore, compared with 1978, the price index (the
 average listed price, the negotiated price and the price on the free market)
 in 1981 was 32.1 percent higher. At the same time, some of the commodities
 which had their prices lowered are not often bought while those which had
 their prices increased are daily necessity nonstaple foodstuffs such as
 vegetables.  As a result, the masses are more aware of the increases of
 prices.   But nonstaple foodstuffs only make up less than 25 percent of the
 total retail volume of consumer goods.  The staff and workers have other
 expenses for food, clothing, daily-use goods, haircutting, bathing and other
 services.  Taken as a whole, in 1981 the price index in the living expenses
 of the workers and staff in 1981 was 12.3 percent higher than in 1978, and
 during the same period the average income which could be used for living
 expenses of the families of workers and staff increased by 46.8 percent.
 With a deduction of increases in cost of living,  the actual income increased
 by 30.7 percent (if the calculation is based on the average wages of workers
 and staff, the actual income after deductions for price increases is an
 increase of 11.9 percent).   Therefore, it can be seen that the growth in
 income which could be used for living expenses of workers and staff was
 faster than the price increases.   Because the management of prices is not
 strict and some unhealthy tendencies in business ideology still exist in
 some enterprises, consequently there also exist such phenomenon as marketing
 low-quality commodities as high-quality commodities, giving short weights,
 actually increasing prices and changing costs at will.  All these have
 increased the economic burden on the masses.  However, it must be confirmed
 that the standard of living of workers and staff has been improved over the
 past 3 years.   Otherwise, how can we explain the increases in the actual
 consumption of the families of workers and staff and their savings deposits?
 Some workers said that over the past few years they have earned more money
 and that although prices have increased, they found, after meticulous
 calculations, that their actual standard of living has improved.   Such a
 situation is in line with the actual situations of the majority of workers
 and staff.  A few workers and staff still have not had their wages increased
 for a long period of time and they have received little or no bonuses.

 Therefore, with price increases, there has been little improvement or even
 a drop in their actual standard of living.  Measures must be taken to give
 special consideration to these workers and staff.  .
 Improvement of People's Livelihood Must Be Based on the Development of
 Production and Labor Productivity
 Some comrades acknowledge the improvement in people's livelihood, but they
 demand that the improvement must be stepped up.   Such a desire is understand-
 able.   But the pace of such improvement does not rest with our subjective
 desire.  On the contrary, it rests with the possibility of objective condi-
 tions.  This is because the pace in the improvement of people's livelihood
 must in no way exceed the growth in social labor productivity; otherwise our
 country will not be able to realize the great goal of modernization.   In
 the final analysis, people's livelihood can in no way be improved excessively.
 Over the past 3 years, almost all of the growth of our state revenues has
 been used in increasing consumption funds.   The growth of the income of com-
 mune members and workers and staff has exceeded the growth of the national
 revenue and industrial and agricultural production.   It is necessary to do
 this because historically the people's livelihood had not been improved for
 quite a long period in the past.   Such improvement has played a positive role
 in promoting social stability and unity, mobilizing the initiative of the
 masses in production, and in stepping up the revival and development of
 economy.   But as we have made excessively large steps forward, there have
 emerged some problems that merit our attention.
 First, the subsidies for price increases have become a heavy burden for state
 finances.   In order to stabilize market selling prices and lighten the eco
 nomic burden of the broad masses of people, the state has over the past few
 years resorted to financial subsidies for some basic daily necessity goods
 and for the means of agricultural production.   Such a measure is absolutely
 necessary.   Because of incomplete planning and because some places purchase
 agricultural and sideline products at lower prices, the situation of nego-
 tiated and increased prices has developed and consequently price subsidies
 provided from state finances have drastically increased.  In 1981, price
 subsidies were as high as 32 billion yuan, more than 30 percent of the
 financial expenditure during the year.
 Second, the growth of social purchasing power has exceeded the growth of
 commodity resources.  The amount of currency issued in 1979 and 1980
 increased by more than 20 percent each year.   After efforts were made, the
 figure dropped to 14 percent last year, but it was still higher than the
 growth of the retail volume of social commodities and the total volume of
 the stock of commodities on hand.
 Third, the growth of bonuses exceeded the growth of production by a big
 margin.   The bonuses offered by the units under the ownership by the whole
 people and the units of collective ownership in cities and towns increased
 successively over the past 3 years.  In 1979, bonuses were 4.6 billion yuan,
 but in 1981 they drastically increased to 7.8 billion yuan and this figure
 excluded the material and cash that were given to workers and staff in the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 name of bonuses.   Over the past 3 years, gross industrial output value
 increased by 23 percent while the labor productivity of industrial workers
 and staff grew by 6.6 percent.  But the bonuses for workers and staff
 increased by a staggering 6 times.
 If these situations continue to develop in this way, the financial deficit
 will no doubt increase, market demand and supply will become unbalanced and
 prices will be unstable.  As a result, the benefits that have been enjoyed
 by the urban and rural population will certainly be affected.   Thus the
 steps taken to improve people's livelihood cannot be too big.
 Comrade Chen Yun recently pointed out that people's livelihood must be
 improved.   He said the people must not eat too poorly or eat too well.   To
 eat is first and to construct is second.  But if we eat everything, there
 will be no hope for our country.   It is only when we have a surplus for
 carrying out production and construction after meeting the food needs that
 our country has hope.   Thus, in simple words, Comrade Chen Yun profoundly
 expounded the dialectical relations between people's livelihood and state
 construction which promote and condition each other.
 In the final analysis,  the purpose of socialist production is to constantly
 meet the needs in people's material and cultural life.  But the improvement
 of people's livelihood must be based on the development of production and
 the improvement of labor productivity.  Now our national economy is being
 readjusted and our state finances are facing many difficulties.  Therefore,,
 the broad masses of people must put the interest of the state in first
 place, contribute their efforts to the country, strengthen their socialist
 initiative and the sense of responsibility as the masters of their own
 country, display the good tradition of hard work, and improve labor pro-
 ductivity and economic results so as to increase our state's financial
 revenues.   By doing so, we will be able to form a reliable materialistic
 foundation for the improvement of the people's livelihood.

 .VIGOROUSLY STUDY ECONOMIC THEORY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 29-30
 [Short commentary]
 [Text]   Vast numbers of cadres in the state have been studying economic
 theory in a general way since last February.  To sum up, the result of their
 study has been relatively good.  Through study they have initially grasped
 some basic Marxist political and economic principles; they have gained a
 better understanding of the experiences and lessons of economic construc-
 tion since the founding of the republic; they have cleared up the influence
 of the "leftist" ideology; they have gained a deeper understanding of the
 party's line, guiding principles and policies adopted since the third
 plenary session; they have strengthened their confidence in achieving our
 socialist modernizations; and, on this basis, they have also paid close
 attention to relating the realities of our four modernizations, studied new
 conditions and resolved new problems.  However, their progress is very
 imbalanced.   They are only interested in studying practicable policies to
 which the party committee has attached great importance and over which it
 has exercised good leadership.  They have made great progress and scored
 good results in studying these. policies.  But they are inactive when it
 comes to studying the policies to which the party committee has paid little
 attention.   They make slow progress and score relatively poor results in
 studying such policies.  Although some localities and units have made prepa-
 rations for the study of theory, they do not have a sound system of examina-
 tion and supervision.   The tutorials they provide cannot keep pace with the
 progress of study, and thus the study period becomes a mere formality.   Some
 localities and units have a poor study plan.  They only study vigorously
 current policies.   They ignore and slacken their study of economic theory.
 A small number of units have not even organized any study of theory.   It is
 necessary for cadres at all levels and leading departments to examine the
 situation of the study of theory, tackle existing problems, adopt effective
 policies, urge cadres who are required to participate in the study of theory
 to finish studying the books listed for them as scheduled and to make real
 improvement.
 Straightening out our understanding is the key to the vigorous study of the
 theory.  First of all, the leading cadres should be far-sighted.  They should
 be fully aware that cadre education in theory plays an important role in the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 construction of the cadre ranks.   The enhancement of cadres' theoretical
 level has a decisive effect on the mental outlook of cadres, their ability
 to comprehend, their understanding of policies, and the quality and quantity
 of their work.  Nowadays, the party has shifted its emphasis to economic
 construction.  If we are not armed with Marxist economic theories and if we
 do not understand the objective law of socialist economic construction, it
 is obvious that we cannot do our own job well and score good results in the
 four modernizations.   Cadres' failure to analyze correctly the situation and
 to understand and carry out the party's line, guiding principles and poli-
 cies can often be explained by their lack of economic theory and knowledge.
 Cadres at all levels should, therefore, handle cadres' study of theory with
 a strategic view and take up the work with an attitude of being highly
 responsible to the revolution.  They should also set a good example and take
 the lead in studying theory well.
 Cadres at all levels should also adopt an effective policy on organization
 and establish and perfect the system of study so as to ensure the completion
 of the study plan.   It is true that current tasks and missions are very
 intense.  However,  they should not hamper the organization of cadres' study
 of theory.  In order to resolve the contradiction between work and study,  -
 some localities and units have adopted a method of "small concentration" to
 ensure a period of study and to speed up training in rotation.  This method
 should be advocated as it can bring forth better results.  Localities which
 do not possess such conditions should make appropriate arrangements to ensure
 a period of study.   The study of current policies is very important and
 should be vigorously carried out.  However, it cannot replace the study of
 theory.   We should start the organization of study well and complete it
 well.  We should not do it perfunctorily.  We advocate that examination and
 assessment should be carried out when the study period ends.
 The policy of relating theory and practice should be continuously put into
 effect to improve the quality and quantity of study.   The books listed for
 study should be related to Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of socialist con-
 struction expounded in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History
 of Our Party Since the Founding of the PRC" and the fundamentals of our
 socialist modernizations, to the study of the 10 policies on socialist con-
 struction made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the government work report at the
 4th Session of the 5th NPC, and to the speeches on current economic work
 made at the national conference on industry and communications on 4 March
 this year.   At the same time, attention should also be paid to relating the
 practical problems in economic construction and cadres' practical ideological
 problems in study to improving our understanding and work and to resolving
 various new problems encountered in economic development.   Since quite a few
 cadres do not have a basic understanding of politics and economics, their
 comprehension of the content of the study is affected.   It is necessary to
 give them some basic knowledge and more guidance in study, so that they can
 keep pace with the progress of study.
 It is entirely possible to speed up the progress of the study of economic
 theory to improve the quality and quantity of the study, to complete the
 study quantitatively and qualitatively as scheduled, and to create good con-
 ditions for the study of philosophy which will come next if cadres at all
 levels have a clear understanding of cadres' study of theory and have an
 effective policy.

 TAKING PLANNED ECONOMY AS THE DOMINANT FACTOR AND REGULATION BY MARKET
 MECHANISM AS A SUPPLEMENT
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 30-33
 [Article by Xue Muqiao [5641 2550 2890]]
 [Text]  On 25 January of this year, Comrade Chen Yun invited the leading
 comrades of the State Planning Commission to discuss the question of ensuring
 that the planned economy plays the major role and regulation by market mechan-
 ism the supplementary role.   Comrade Chen Yun pointed out:   "Industry must
 use planned economy as the major factor; agriculture is no exception to this.
 Even after the production responsibility system has been introduced, the
 planned economy should still prevail."  Adhering to taking planned economy
 as the dominant factor and regulation by market mechanism as a supplement is
 a major principle in developing the national economy.   The broad masses of
 cadres should firmly maintain this viewpoint.
 In recent years, in studying the reform of the national economic management
 system, we have expressed in many ways the relationship between planned
 economy and regulation by market mechanism.   After testing them in practice,
 many comrades say that some of these ways are not precise and are apt to be
 misunderstood.   The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our.
 Party Since the Founding of the PRC," adopted by the 6th Plenary Session of
 the 11th CCP Central Committee, pointed out:   "It is necessary to practice
 planned economy and at the same time give play to the supplementary, regu-
 latory role of market mechanism on the basis of public ownership."  Last
 year, Comrade Zhao Ziyang further expounded on the relationship between
 planned economy and market mechanism in his report entitled "The Present
 Economic Situation and the Principles for Future Economic Construction"
 delivered at the 4th Session of the 5th NPC.   His exposition completely
 coincided with the resolution and the spirit of Comrade Chen Yun's speech.
 The socialist economy is a planned economy.   In economic activities, vital
 aspects related to the overall national economy, such as the scale of
 capital construction,  the level of people's livelihood, the ratio between
 accumulation and consumption, and the major proportions of different depart-
 ments in the national economy, should be strictly controlled by state plan-
 ning.  In order to maintain proper ratios between different departments, the
 arrangement of all major construction projects and the production and

 distribution of important products (especially those in short supply) must
 be subject to state plans.  The production and operation of key enter-
 prises should also be conducted in line with state plans.   Planning is
 essential to industry as well as to agriculture.  Industry and agriculture
 are interdependent.  If planning is only extended to industry but not to
 agriculture, the national economy cannot develop proportionately.  Mean-
 while, it is also necessary to regulate our economy by market mechanism
 under the guidance of state planning because of the following facts:  The
 development of productive forces in China is still at a low level and there
 is uneven development in different areas; in respect of economic forms,
 ownership by the whole people, which takes a leading position in the national
 economy, coexists with the collective economy, which covers a fairly wide
 sphere, and individual economy, which covers a smaller sphere (if peasants'
 household sideline undertakings are included, individual economy then covers
 quite a large sphere).  Most industrial and agricultural products have to be
 exchanged through markets.   The big commodities with limited varieties but
 great output value, which are vital to the national economy and people's
 livelihood, need to be produced in line with state plans, while the small
 commodities with small output value but tremendous varieties, which cannot
 be completely covered by state plans, can be produced freely according to
 market demands within the specified limits allowed by state plans.
 Planned management requires both administrative and economic measures.
 Market mechanism can spontaneously regulate the economy according to objec-
 tive economic laws, but the necessary administrative management cannot be
 abandoned.   In the past, we mainly resorted to administrative measures and
 to the issuing of mandatory plans in our planned management.   Industrial
 branches arranged production and commercial branches handled purchasing and
 sales in line with these plans.   As a result of the nonconformity between
 production and market demands, some products were overproduced and others
 were in short supply, thus leading to serious waste.   Therefore, even in
 implementing mandatory plans, economic measures must be adopted at the same
 time.  That is, we should give thorough consideration to and make use of the
 law of value and lay down and adjust planned prices for products in the light
 of their value and market conditions.   In order to give full play to economic
 measures, it can be considered that, after readjustment is largely completed
 and the balance between supply and demand is attained, although key products
 with limited varieties which are vital to the national economy will still
 require mandatory planning, we will not need to issue mandatory plans for
 the production and marketing of daily-use goods, but can switch over to
 guiding plans.   This method means that the targets of production and
 marketing set by the state are only references for the production and
 marketing departments concerned.   Commercial departments can purchase goods
 from industrial departments in line with both planned targets and market
 demands, while industrial departments can organize production in line with
 orders placed by commercial departments and market demands.  When planned
 management is conducted in this way, it can reflect market demands better.
 So long as the major proportion of the products are unifiedly purchased
 and sold by state-owned commercial departments in accordance with planned
 prices set by the state, the economy is still being governed by planned
 management and not by regulation by market mechanism.   Only free production

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 within the limits allowed by the state, and those commodity prices which
 are not unifiedly fixed by the state but float freely according to market
 conditions, belong to the realm of market mechanism.
 After guiding plans for reference are issued, their fulfillment should be
 guaranteed mainly by economic means and not by administrative means.  We
 should lay down a proper pricing policy, under which the balance between
 supply of and demand for common products can be guaranteed largely by
 prices.  For some products, this balance cannot be regulated completely by
 prices; in these cases, we can consider obtaining help from tax rates.  For
 example, high tax rates should be imposed on cigarettes and alcoholic
 beverages because their consumption needs to be limited, while low tax rates
 can be imposed on people's daily necessities which can sometimes be exempt
 from taxes.  The prices of a few items (such as grains) can be subsidized if
 necessary.   Regulation sometimes can be carried out through bank loans. If
 the state needs to develop certain trades, more loans with lower interest
 rates can be offered to them.   But for those trades which the state needs to
 limit,  few or no loans should be made.  Also loans can be made at high inter-
 est rates, so as to accelerate normal circulation of all sorts of products
 and diminish overstocking and waste.  Mastering the method of applying
 economic levers, gradually reducing mandatory plans and replacing them with
 guiding plans for reference, is an important part of the future reforms of
 our planning system.  At present, owing to the irrationality in system,
 structure and prices, it is difficult to adopt guiding plans, and so it is
 still necessary to intensify planned guidance and administrative interven-
 tion.   Of course, even if we learn how to apply economic levers, mandatory
 plans cannot be completely abandoned.   The investment in capital construc-
 tion of some major projects, the production and distribution of a small
 number of important materials closely related to the national economy and
 people's livelihood, especially those in short supply (such as grains and
 energy sources), all need to be subject to mandatory plans for a long time
 in the future.
 Besides mandatory plans and guiding plans for reference, planned management
 needs to be carried out in other diversified ways.   For example, mandatory
 plans and guiding plans for reference can be adopted simultaneously;
 cooperative plans between different areas, trades and enterprises can be
 implemented.  For steel and cotton cloth, the gross volume of production and
 marketing must be subject to mandatory plans.  But the varieties, specifica-
 tions and assortments, numbering in the tens of thousands, cannot all be set
 down in state plans and can only be specified through contracts.   Some
 products in short supply must be unifiedly distributed by the state.   But,
 after fulfilling state plans, a small quantity of them may be retained to
 allow the producing areas to cooperate with areas needing these products.
 Thus the producing areas can exchange these products for those which it is
 short of and which even the state is not able to supply.   In recent years,
 coastal cities and industrial areas have invested in inland areas, jointly
 explored natural resources in inland areas, and assisted technical innova-
 tion of industry in inland areas.  All this has achieved marked results.
 Unified plans of the central authorities pursued from above should be supple-
 mented with cooperation plans between areas implemented from below.  When

 working out cooperation plans from below, the fulfillment of product-
 transfer assignments laid down by the state must first be guaranteed.
 Cooperation plans between areas should be coordinated on a nationwide scale,
 thus making these plans a part of the state plan and properly maintaining an
 overall balance.  Without an overall balance, a planned economy cannot exist.
 Although there is more flexibility in the above-mentioned planned management
 methods, they still cannot be considered regulation by market mechanism.
 This is because the cooperation between different areas or state-owned
 economic departments must be included in departmental or area plans, and is
 thus coordinated by the central planning department.
 Owing to the extent of collective ownership in rural areas, planned manage-
 ment in these areas needs to take more complex forms.   In the past, key
 agricultural products were subject to planned management mainly through
 pricing policies, thus falling under the scope of guiding plans for refer-
 ence.  When many key agricultural products were in short supply, besides
 utilizing pricing policies, we also adopted measures of requisition by
 purchase (for grains), monopoly purchase by the state (for cotton) and
 quota-assigned purchase by the state (for pigs and eggs) in order to guaran-
 tee fulfillment of the purchasing targets for these products.   This can be
 regarded as a kind of planned management with mandatory assignments, adding
 administrative measures to economic measures.  This method can be changed
 only when a balance between supply and demand is attained or when supply
 exceeds demand.  As long as prices are set by the state, there is planned
 pricing and most products are unifiedly purchased by organs designated by
 the state, the adoption of pricing policies in seeking a balance between
 supply and demand still falls within the scope of planned management.  Only
 the third category of agricultural and sideline products, for which the
 state does not fix prices, and those products that the state allows to be
 sold in country fairs or on urban agricultural and sideline product markets,
 are subject to regulation by market mechanism.  State-owned commercial
 departments purchase agricultural and sideline products from peasants at
 negotiated prices.   This is a necessary supplement to planned purchasing at
 the present stage.   However, the scope of purchasing at negotiated prices
 must be strictly controlled, lest it adversely affects state purchasing
 plans.
 In line with the above distinction, the production and exchange of most
 products in our country are subject to planned management; regulation by
 market mechanism only plays a supplementary role.  However, from the view-
 point of varieties of products, there are many more products subject to
 regulation by market mechanism than there are products subject to planned
 management.  Although the output value of the former is not large, they.are
 still necessary for the people.   Thus, regulation by market mechanism is a
 necessary complement to planned management.  At the same time, it should be
 pointed out that we must apply the law of value when pursuing planned
 management.  All consumer goods in our country are exchanged through markets
 and are freely bought by consumers according to their own choices.  A con-
 siderable proportion of the means of production is also exchanged through
 markets.   Thus economic personnel (including planning personnel) must regu-
 larly make market surveys and familiarize themselves with the laws operating

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 in the market.  In recent years, the reason we stressed the role of market
 mechanism in reforming the economic management system was, that our economic
 personnel paid too little attention to market conditions and studying
 economic laws.  It is wrong to juxtapose market mechanism and planning regu-
 lation without realizing that the latter is the main body.   It is also wrong
 to think that planned management can be conducted without studying the role
 of regulation by market mechanism, or even to regard utilization of the
 role of market mechanism as a kind of capitalist liberalization.  In order
 to eliminate the existing phenomenon in which production is separated from
 marketing, we must continue to thoroughly study market activities and fore-
 cast market trends, and promptly revise plans for production and purchasing.
 Upon discovering the nonconformity of production with demand, we must adjust
 planned prices.   Over the last few years, in the reform of the economic
 management system, we have gradually implemented the.following measures with
 regard to circulation:
 First, the system of monopoly purchase and marketing by the state of many
 daily-use goods has been changed.  Apart from grain, cotton and other vital
 consumer goods, and petroleum, coal, timber and other important means of
 production, common commodities can be subject to purchasing plans laid down
 by commercial departments according to market demands, to the production
 plans worked out by manufacturers in the light of market demands and to the
 purchasing plans of commercial departments.   Factories without sufficient
 production assignments can change their products themselves and look for
 markets.  Within limits set by the state, manufacturers can deal directly
 with retail shops in many items of daily-use goods which the state allows
 to be marketed in local areas.  These transactions need not be handled
 through wholesale companies.   Some commodities can be sold in stores set up
 by the manufacturers themselves.  Commercial departments can purchase many
 daily-use goods.  They can refuse to purchase products not readily market-
 able.  Manufacturers can market products not purchased by commercial depart-
 ments.   Since monopoly purchase and marketing of daily-use goods by the state
 have been changed into selective purchase and self-marketing, the problems of
 having many products overstocked or out of stock for a long time have
 initially been solved,  thus reducing waste.
 Second, we have increased circulation channels and reduced circulation links.
 In the past, urban commerce was monopolized by state-owned commercial depart-
 ments, rural commerce was monopolized by supply and marketing cooperatives,
 and import and export trade was monopolized by the state foreign trade
 departments.   Thus,  the market was excessively controlled and the national
 economy was hindered from growing healthily.  At present, while the commer-
 cial departments continue to play a leading role in the market, manufacturers
 have been allowed to directly market some industrial goods.   Some special
 companies set up by the industrial departments have also been allowed to
 directly market products (such as machinery and electrical appliances).
 Communes, production teams and peasants are allowed to sell their products,
 within the limits set by the state, in urban agricultural and sideline product
 markets.   The state also allows some areas and factories to handle import and
 export under the unified leadership of the foreign trade departments, or to
 handle import and export jointly with special foreign trade companies.   This

 reform has played an important role in promoting product exchange between
 urban and rural areas and between China and other countries.  Of course,
 when we give play to market mechanism, it is difficult to avoid some illegal
 activities, such as speculation, smuggling and evading taxes.  Therefore,
 the state has to intensify market management at the same time.
 The correct handling of the relationship between planned economy and regula-
 tion by market mechanism is one of the important links in our reform of the
 system.  We have appropriately expanded the scope of regulation by market
 mechanism and paid attention to utilizing economic levers in our planned
 management.  Experience over the last 3 years has proved that these reforms
 have achieved marked results.   In order to bring the positive roles of these
 reforms into play and to prevent negative roles, we must intensify planned
 management, properly utilize economic measures, use economic levers to
 handle the economy, step up economic legislation, and strengthen supervision
 and inspection by customs and industrial and commercial administrative
 bureaus.   Just as the rule of law must be instituted in the practice of
 democracy, market control must be strengthened in the practice of market
 regulation.  Failure to implement regulation by market mechanism or loosen-
 ing market control are equally unfavorable to the development of the socialist
 economy.

 IS THERE ANY CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE APPROPRIATE RESTORATION AND DEVELOPMENT
 OF THE INDIVIDUAL ECONOMY AND THE PAST PRACTICE OF TRANSFORMING IT?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 33-34
 [Article by He Jiangzhang [0149 1696 4545]]
 [Text]   The individual economy in cities and towns has been restored and has
 developed considerably over the past few years; the number of people
 employed jumped from 150,000 in 1978 to more than 1 million by the end of
 1981.   This change has caused some comrades to harbor a doubt:  Does this
 situation not mean that the socialist transformation of the individual econ-
 omy in the past was wrong?  This is a question that must be clarified.
 First of all, it must be affirmed that big achievements have been made in
 carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
 The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the
 Founding of the PRC" points out that "it is a great historic victory."  In
 1952, the output value of state-owned industry accounted for 41.5 percent
 of the gross national output value, that of state-private joint industry for
 4 percent, that of cooperative industry for 3.3 percent, that of capitalist
 industry for 30.6 percent and that of individual handicraft industry for
 20.6 percent.   State commerce accounted for 16.2 percent of the total retail
 volume of social commodities, state-private joint commerce for 0.4 percent,
 cooperative commerce for 18.2 percent, private commerce for 60.9 percent and
 peasants retail for 4.3 percent.   That means that industry at that time,
 particularly the commercial sector, was under the dominance of the capital-
 ist economy and the individual economy and that the question of "which will
 win" as between socialism and capitalism had yet to be answered.  In order to
 overcome capitalism, it was imperative to carry out socialist transformation
 of the capitalist economy and individual economy, and there was an objective
 need for developing social productive forces.   By that time, the capitalist
 relations of production were not in line with big economic construction, and
 it was difficult for the individual economy to develop because it was
 scattered, backward and lacked funds.   Individual commerce and industry were
 almost at a standstill prior to socialist transformation.  Between 1952 and
 1955, the output value of individual handicraft industry dropped from 20.6
 percent to 14.8 percent of the total industrial output value.  Following
 gradual socialist transformation, the handicraft industry made rapid progress
 in production because of concentrated strength, division of work and more

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 funds.  For example, between 1953 and 1957, the labor productivity of the
 staff and workers of the handicraft cooperatives in Beijing Municipality
 grew an average of 16.3 percent annually.  What is more important, the
 socialist transformation of individual industry and commerce helped get
 rid of the soil that bred capitalism, and it consolidated the position of
 socialism and answered the question of "which will win."
 But at the same time some mistakes occurred in the process of socialist
 transformation.  After the summer of 1955, the transformation of agricul-
 tural cooperatives, handicraft industry and individual commerce was done too
 hastily, roughly and dogmatically and, as a result, this work left a legacy
 of some problems that existed for quite a long period.  What was the reason
 for these problems?  Comrade Chen Yun pointed out at that time that, in the
 process of cooperativizing the handicraft industry, there was too much
 merging and there was unified calculation of profits.  Consequently, the
 quality and varieties of some handicraft products dropped as compared with
 what they were in the period when everyone was managing his own business.
 Following merging, some handicraft units in the service sector were greatly
 inconvenienced, and so were residents.   It was in this situation that Com-
 rade Chen Yun proposed that "the production of a considerable part of
 industrial products, handicraft products and agricultural sideline products
 and commerce must be carried out dispersedly and with dispersed management";
 "small businessmen and peddlers must manage their own businesses within the
 framework of cooperative groups, and this situation must be maintained for
 a long period of time."   ("New Questions Following the Basic Completion of
 Socialist Transformation")   He also said:  "The situation of our socialist
 economy should be like this:  With regard to industry and commerce, the state
 and collective management are primary but industry and commerce are supple-
 mented by certain types of individual operations."   (ibid.)   It can be seen
 that the method that is used today for appropriately restoring and developing
 the individual economy was suggested by Comrade Chen Yun more than 2 decades
 ago.  At that time, he suggested some measures to solve the partial short-
 comings and mistakes under the premise of fully affirming the great and
 decisive victory of our socialist transformation.  Today we are merely imple-
 menting these measures, and we are not denying the necessity and correctness
 of socialist transformation.   By so doing we will be able to make the struc-
 ture of all ownership at the present stage accord with our national condi-
 tions so that this structure will become more beneficial to activating the
 economy and to promoting the healthy development of our socialist construc-
 tion.
 Today we are appropriately restoring and developing the individual economy,
 but this does not mean that we are restoring it to the situation prior to
 socialist transformation.   The range of the individual economy at the present
 stage is limited, while in the past it covered everything.   Furthermore, after
 socialist transformation was basically completed, and particularly under
 today's circumstances in which the economy under the system of socialist
 public ownership predominates,  the individual economy is no longer at a
 crossroads; it depends on and is a necessary complement to the socialist
 economy.  We can resort to economic and administrative ways to bring the

 individual economy onto the path of serving socialist construction.   Of
 course, the individual economy has its spontaneity and blindness and it
 might be contradictory to the planned development of the national economy.
 Therefore, in order to avoid passivity, it is necessary to strengthen con-
 trol over the individual economy.

 HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THE COEXISTENCE OF DIVERSIFIED ECONOMIC FORMS AT THE
 PRESENT STAGE IN OUR COUNTRY?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 34-35
 [Article by Wu Shuqing [0702 2885 7230]]
 [Text]   Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee and
 following the readjustment and transformation of the national economy, there
 have existed diversified economic forms in our country.   Some comrades do
 not have a good understanding of this situation, and they even wonder whether
 the past socialist transformation might have been wrong and that we are
 retrogressing.  In order to eliminate such doubts, it is imperative for us
 to compare the existence of diversified economic forms at the present stage
 with the existence of diversified economic forms prior to socialist trans-
 formation and analyze them.
 First of all, there existed three basic economic sectors prior to the com-
 pletion of socialist transformation.   They were the socialist state economy,
 the individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, and the capitalist
 economy.   It is true that at that time the socialist state sector of the
 economy had already grasped the major state economic lifelines and had even
 established a leading position in the struggle against the capitalist
 economy.   But the socialist economic sector was not yet in a predominant
 position throughout the whole national economy.   The individual peasant
 economy was still in the predominant position in agriculture, which was the
 basis of the national economy.  The capitalist economy still dominated a
 considerable proportion of industrial production as well as the circulation
 of commodities and, at that stage, it still constituted a power that could
 in no way be neglected.   Thus at that time, diversified economic forms
 "coexisted" under the situation in which the economy with public ownership
 was not in predominant position.   Consequently, our society was still at the
 stage of transition and it was yet to become a socialist society.
 But today, basic changes have taken place in the situation of our socialist
 economy.   The socialist state economic sector and the collective economy are
 in predominant positions in regard to the volume of the means of production
 and funds, in the number of laborers employed as well as in providing society
 with products and labor services and in national revenues, and they have also
 become the basic economic forms of our country.

 Marx pointed out:  "In all social forms, there is a certain production which
 dominates the position and influence of all other production and therefore
 its relations dominate the position and influence of all other relations.
 It is a generally illuminating light and all other colors are submerged in
 it and consequently they change their features."   ("Selected Works of Marx
 and Engels," Vol 2, p 109)  At the present stage,   socialist public owner-
 ship is this "illuminating light" in our socialist economy.  As socialist
 public ownership is in a predominant position, the nature and features of
 other economic sectors have consequently changed drastically compared with
 the past.
 .With regard to the individual laborer economy that still exists within
 certain limits at the present stage, it is true that this kind of economy
 still only possesses a little of the means of production and, therefore, it
 has a nature of private ownership.  However, it differs with the individual
 economy in the old society.   Such individual laborer economy also has
 experienced big changes if it is compared with the individual economy that
 widely existed prior to the socialist transformation.  The individual economy
 at that time was an economy.at the crossroads.   It might have taken the
 socialist road or might have combined with the capitalist economy to become
 a hotbed for the emergence of capitalism.   Now, all the related aspects of
 the individual economy such as range, scale, mode, the resources of raw
 materials, sales prices, and the standard for charges are all conditioned
 and influenced by the socialist economy and are under the leadership and
 management of various government departments concerned.   So the existence
 and development of such an economy depends on socialist public ownership; it
 is complementary to the economy with socialist public ownership and it dis-
 plays a role of "making up for omissions and deficiencies."
 Our country has allowed foreign economic institutions and individuals to
 invest and undertake various forms of economic cooperation under the laws
 and regulations of the PRC.  All such foreign enterprises, economic institu-
 tions, and joint ventures between Chinese and foreign capital must abide by
 the laws, regulations and policies of our country.  Because of this, they are
 all different from the capitalist economy in the past.   Their existence will
 in no way affect our socialist economic system; on the contrary, they are in
 the interests of our modernization program.
 Second, prior to the completion of socialist transformation,  the contradic-
 tion between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy was the main
 contradiction of the transitional economy.   The nature and the trend in the
 development of various nonsocialist economic sectors were contradictory to
 the growth and development of the socialist economy.   Their contradiction
 with the socialist economy was the main contradiction and the question of
 "which will win" had not yet been resolved.   This was the reason why it was
 imperative to carry out socialist transformation of the means of production
 with private ownership and realize the transition from new democracy to
 socialism.
 The question of "which will win" between socialism and capitalism was
 basically resolved following the completion of socialist transformation,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 while the contradiction between people's increasing material and cultural
 needs and backward social production began to become the principal domestic
 contradiction.  An important measure for resolving this contradiction was to
 carry out a socialist modernization program and develop social productive
 forces in a big way.   Under such conditions, the contradiction between the
 socialist economy and other economic sectors became a secondary contradic-
 tion.  Under the leadership, supervision and influence of the socialist
 economy, it was important to use these economic sectors to develop produc-
 tion and improve people's livelihood.  For example, restoring and developing
 a certain quantity of individual economy is in the interests of increasing
 production, as are promoting market activities, arranging employment, bring-
 ing convenience to the masses, improving the management of the economy with
 public ownership and improving services.   The spontaneous tendencies of this
 individual economy can be resolved through strengthening management.  With
 regard to such economic forms as joint ventures between China and foreign
 companies and foreign capital, it is true that they have a feature of seeking
 profits, but what is more important is that the permission given for the
 existence of these economic forms is in the interest of absorbing foreign
 capital, importing new technology and equipment, and learning from advanced
 management systems.   All this will benefit our socialist modernization pro-
 gram.   But we must guard against the negative influences of these economic
 forms and the influence of decadent capitalist ideology and fight against
 their corrosive influence.
 In short,  the coexistence of diversified economic forms at the present stage
 in our country is totally different from the coexistence of diversified
 economic sectors prior to socialist transformation.   The existence of
 diversified economic forms does not mean a "retrogression" to the situation
 prior to socialist transformation.   It is in fact a necessary readjustment
 in production relations under the premise of upholding basic socialist
 principles and it is in line with our national conditions.  'The coexistence
 of diversified economic forms is not an expedient measure, it will continue
 for a long time to come.

 STRENGTHEN RURAL PARTY ORGANIZATIONS AT THE BASIC LEVEL
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 36-39, 43
 [Article by Jing Dong [0079 2639]]
 [Text]   A very important problem at present is to strengthen the rural party
 organizations at the basic level, give full play to the role of rural party
 branches as fighting bastions and to the exemplary vanguard role of party
 members, and lead the rural cadres and commune members in building socialist
 material and spiritual civilizations.
 Generally speaking,  the party organizations at the basic level in China's
 broad rural areas are good.   This must be fully acknowledged.  The rural
 areas throughout the country are full of vitality.   The commune members are
 full of joy.   Development of agriculture is on the ascendant.  How has this
 situation come about?  First of all, the party's line, principles and poli-
 cies are correct.  In addition, this situation is inseparable from the
 efforts of rural party organizations at the basic level and of commune mem-
 bers.  In the past few years, in various rural areas, the party organizations
 at the basic level and the commune members have gotten rid of "leftist"
 ideological trammels; enthusiastically propagated and implemented the party's
 line, principles and policies; persisted in socialist collectivization and in
 the public ownership of the basic means of production such as land; ener-
 getically carried out and perfected various forms of the production responsi-
 bility system; developed agricultural production in line with local condi-
 tions; and done a great deal of meticulous ideological and organizational
 work.   Those who originally failed to see why various forms of the agricul-
 tural responsibility system had to be carried out have through practice seen
 the advantages of this system.   They have gradually realized why this system
 must be carried out, and they have regained the initiative.   There has been
 great improvement in the work style of party members and cadres.   The rela-
 tions between the party and the masses are becoming closer every day.   In
 short, the great majority of the rural party organizations at the basic
 level are combatworthy.
 Then, can we say that we do not have any problems?  Of course not.  We still
 have many problems, and the problems in some places are very serious. The
 rural party organizations at the basic level have the problem of slack and
 weak ideological work.   For instance, owing to the long-term influence of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 "leftist" guiding thinking, there are still obstructions to the implementa-
 tion of the party's and government's rural policies; since the carrying out
 of the production responsibility system, the problem of how to correctly
 handle the relations between the state, the collective and the individuals
 has become prominent; gambling and superstitious activities are rampant in
 some places; civil disputes and criminal offenses often take place; in par-
 ticular, illegal and criminal activities such as corruption and embezzle-
 ment, speculation and profiteering, smuggling and appropriating collective
 and state property and materials are rampant in some places.  To solve
 these problems, the rural party organizations at the basic level must be
 strong and have combat effectiveness.   But some party organizations at the
 basic level are at their wit's end and powerless in the face of these
 problems.  Some are even in a state of paralysis and disintegration, and
 many problems are not dealt with.   This phenomenon merits attention.
 Our party is in power.   The rural party organizations at the basic level are
 the rural basic leading cores.   The party's line, principles and policies
 must be propagated and implemented through the party organizations at the
 basic level.  Work and tasks in the rural areas must be completed by the
 rural cadres and the peasant masses under the guidance of the party organi-
 zations at the basic level.  Contradictions in the rural areas must be
 solved through profound investigation and study and meticulous ideological
 work carried out by party organizations at the basic level.  Unhealthy
 trends in the rural areas, especially illegal and criminal activities in
 the economic field, must be combated by the rural basic-level cadres and
 peasant masses under the guidance of party organizations at the basic level.
 We must first do a good job in strengthening the rural party organizations
 at the basic level so that we can build socialist material and spiritual
 civilizations in the rural areas.
 Since the extensive implementation of various forms of the production
 responsibility system in the rural areas, some comrades have felt that it
 is not so important to strengthen the rural party organizations at the basic
 level.   Some people say:   "Now that grain and cotton output quotas are
 fixed for each household, the party branches do not have to bother about
 production.  Since each household is solely responsible for its own produc-
 tion,  there is no longer any need for the leadership of the party branches."
 This view is obviously wrong.   Since the implementation of various forms of
 the production responsibility system, the tasks of the rural party organi-
 zations at the basic level have not, in the slightest degree, become lighter.
 On the contrary, the organizations have heavier tasks because many new
 situations and problems have emerged since implementation of the production
 responsibility system.  We will not be able. to tackle these new situations.
 and problems without the leadership of party organizations at the basic
 level.   We know that implementation of the production responsibility system
 has brought into play the production initiative of the peasants.   This is
 excellent.   But because some people still have ideas and habits left over
 from the old society, and furthermore are influenced by the decadent bour-
 geois ideology and way of life, they sometimes show no consideration for
 the interests of the state and the collective.  This must not be overlooked.
 There are the following phenomena:  Some people have, disregarding the

 requirements of state plans, expanded the areas grown to those industrial
 crops from which a high income can be obtained; some people only care for
 selling their agricultural and sideline products on the free market at high
 prices regardless of whether state purchase quotas are fulfilled; some
 people are not enthusiastic about fulfilling the tasks of the collective,
 are not willing to participate in public welfare work and in the work of
 showing consideration for the families of armymen and martyrs, the "five
 guarantees" households and households with material difficulties, but only
 think of attaining individual wealth; and by doing harm to the interests of
 the state and the collective, some people try to get petty advantages at
 the expense of the state and collective economies under all kinds of pre-
 texts, fleece the state and even violate the law and discipline.   If these
 problems are not solved, the production responsibility system cannot be
 consolidated and perfected, nor can the rural economy develop healthily.
 Therefore, the party's ideological and political work in the rural areas
 must be strengthened; it cannot be weakened.  Since implementation of the
 production responsibility system, the rural party organizations at the basic
 level have had a great deal of work to do.  It is not true that they are not
 essential.
 In the final analysis, the reason why the rural party organizations at the
 basic level still have problems and why the leadership of the party has been
 ignored and even abandoned since implementation of the production responsi-
 bility system is that the influence of the leftist erroneous tendency has
 not been eliminated.   In the past, people always talked about "taking class
 struggle as the key link."  They were accustomed to this way of doing things,
 and they had the old approach to their work.   Since the 3d Plenary Session
 of the 11th CCP Central Committee, the focus of the work of the whole party
 has been shifted to socialist construction by centering on the four mod-
 ernizations instead of on political movements.  Some comrades have not been
 able to adapt themselves to this new situation.   Since implementation of the
 production responsibility system, especially since many places began to
 implement the system of fixing output quotas for each household or of
 assigning work to each household, the past method of urging the peasants to
 carry out plowing and planting and of relying on administrative orders has
 become outmoded, and these comrades are-not accustomed to the new system.
 It is just as some people say, "The old methods did not work, but we do not
 understand the new approach."  As a result, they do not know how to take
 charge of their work.   Many comrades have long been engaged in party work at
 the basic level, but under the influence of the leftist erroneous tendency,
 they amassed a lot of "experience" in carrying out class struggle and did a
 lot of administrative work instead of party work.   In reality, they are not
 sufficiently experienced in party work.   Therefore, party organizations
 at the basic level must eliminate the leftist erroneous tendency.  They must
 shift the focus of their work not only from class struggle to economic con-
 struction, but also from administrative work and production activities to
 party work, learn how to carry out party work and strengthen party leader-
 ship.
 What is party work?  In the main it is building the party and carrying out
 ideological and political work.   Rural party organizations at the basic level

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100280001-7
 have the responsibility of leading other rural basic level organizations
 such as organs of political power, economic organizations and mass organi-
 zations.   But this does not mean that party organizations at the basic level
 should take on everything.   Being functions of collective economic units,
 the leading economic functions of production brigades and production teams
 must be retained.  Being functions of organs of political power at the basic
 level, the functions of communes (towns) and production brigades (villages)
 must be strengthened.   Commune party committees and production brigade
 party branches should support organs of political power and economic
 organizations at the basic level in shouldering their tasks, but they should
 not interfere in specific administrative affairs and production activities.
 Besides, by relying on the role of party members in various leading posi-
 tions, the leadership of party organizations at the basic level over other
 basic level organizations and the broad masses in the rural areas is
 realized mainly through strengthening ideological and political work.  In
 other words, party organizations at the basic level should at all times pay
 attention to their own building and frequently educate party members to
 maintain close ties with the masses, do ideological work and play an
 exemplary vanguard role among them, closely unite them around the party
 organizations and lead them in their advance.  The reason why our party can
 shoulder the responsibility of leading the broad masses is that the party's
 line, principles and policies represent the interests of the broad masses
 and that, through propagation, the party's line, principles and policies
 can be implemented among the masses until the masses understand their own
 interests, unite and work hard for their own interests.   Therefore, the
 fundamental way to bring into full play the leading role of rural party
 organizations at the basic level is to strengthen the building of these
 party organizations.  Otherwise, strengthening party leadership will be
 nothing but empty talk.
 Then, how should we strengthen party organizations at the basic level?  We
 should start from the specific conditions of local places.  Generally
 speaking, we must strengthen the leading groups, enhance the political
 quality of party members, strengthen the regular activities of party
 organizations, correct unhealthy trends and carry out the struggle against
 the corrosive influence of bourgeois ideology.
 The key link for strengthening party organizations at the basic level is to
 do a good job in building the leading groups.  Whether the party organiza-
 tions at the basic level are firm and energetic or lax and weak is deter-
 mined mainly by the status of the leading groups.   Many party members in
 some leading groups are getting on in years.   These comrades have been
 trained and educated by the party for many years. They are intrinsically
 good and have work experience.   But they are not very vigorous.   Further-
 more, some of them have been deeply influenced by the "leftist" ideology,
 so they lag behind the situation and cannot efficiently carry out the
 party's line, principles and policies.   Some leading groups have redundant
 personnel who cannot work with one mind and who always engage in disputes
 over trifles; they cannot form a firm and energetic leadership core.    The
 cultural level of some members of leading groups is so low that they cannot
 even transmit to the masses the essence of instructions from the CCP Central

 Committee or from a higher party committee, to say nothing of leading agri-
 cultural modernization.  What merits special attention is that some members
 of leading groups are not pure.  Some bad elements have sneaked in, or good
 members have degenerated because of the corrosive influence of bourgeois
 ideology and of the bourgeois way of life.  They have embarked on the
 criminal road of engaging in graft and embezzlement, speculation and
 profiteering, smuggling, bribery and appropriation of state and collective
 property.  Therefore, we must clear bad and degenerated elements out of the
 party so that we can build the leading groups well.   Those who politically
 undermine the party's regular activities and who economically violate law
 and discipline must not be allowed to remain in the leading groups.  In
 addition, we must find a way for the leading groups to solve the problem
 of their members being advanced in years, too large in number and too low
 in cultural level, and fill the leading groups with educated middle-aged and
 young party members who can resolutely implement the party's line, principles
 and policies.  We must do the work of readjusting the leading groups strictly
 according to the election system stipulated in the party constitution,
 namely, party branch committees should be elected in a democratic way by
 party members.   Generally speaking, it is not appropriate to adopt the
 methods designated by higher party committees.   In some places, party
 branches have not been reelected for many years.   These party branches
 should energetically create conditions and carry out reelections according
 to the stipulations of the party constitution.   In the future, they will be
 required to have an election once a year.   Through regular elections we can
 build firm and energetic leading cores which have strong party spirit and
 good work style.
 The total number of rural party members throughout the country is large.
 Besides developing appropriately and in a planned way new party members who
 are really up to standard in those places where party organizations at the
 basic level are comparatively good, we must also educate the party members
 we now have and raise their levels.   Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out 2
 years ago that some of our party members did not have the requisite qualifi-
 cations.  This problem has not yet been totally solved,  The great majority
 of rural party members are intrinsically good, but a certain number of them
 have low political consciousness, weak party spirit and low sense of organi-
 zation.  They have neither committed any mistake nor played any role.  Since
 implementation of the production responsibility system, some party members
 have had the following idea:  "Since output quotas are fixed for each house-
 hold, everything we do is to make individuals well off; and since production
 tasks are assigned to each individual, everything we do is in regard to
 individual interests."  They do not bother any more about the ideal of com-
 munism, the cause of the party, and the interests of the state and collec-
 tive.   Some party members do not want to be cadres any longer, saying that
 cadres are always at a disadvantage.  Some party members even say:  "Eating
 and spending money require effort, but whether one is a party member does not
 make much difference."  They are unwilling even to participate in the party's
 regular activities, let alone fulfilling the tasks assigned by the party.
 With regard to this phenomenon, we must strengthen the education of party
 members and change the situation in which some party members do not have the
 requisite qualifications.   We must understand that implementation of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 production responsibility system means that we must set higher requirements
 for party members and not vice versa.  Party members must not only be like
 commune members in conscientiously implementing what is stipulated in the
 responsibility system, but also maintain close ties with the masses, do
 ideological work among the masses and energetically do propaganda work, and,
 take
 the
 lead
 in implementing the party's principles and policies.  They
 must
 take
 the
 lead in implementing contracts and fulfilling the purchase
 tasks
 of
 the
 state and the tasks assigned by production teams.  They must
 take
 the
 lead
 in participating in public welfare labor and actively help
 households with material difficulties to solve their problems in production
 and livelihood.  They must take the lead in observing law and discipline and
 in combating unhealthy trends, and guide the masses in becoming well off
 through manual labor.  They must take the lead in cultural study and in the
 study of scientific knowledge, and popularize advanced agricultural tech-
 nology.   They must take the lead in carrying out family planning and in
 changing prevailing habits and customs.   In short, they must play an
 exemplary vanguard role in everything they do.   To do all this will be
 utterly impossible if we do not have the lofty ideal of communism and the
 socialist consciousness of loving the country and the collective, and if we
 do not have the revolutionary spirit of utter devotion to the public and of
 serving the people without thought of self.  In order to build well party
 organizations at the basic level, we must adopt practical methods and improve
 the political quality of rural party members.  Training party members by
 rotation is carried out in some places during the slack season in farming.
 Education on the party's basic knowledge, on the party's principles and
 policies and on the situation and tasks is also carried out in these places.
 Practice has proved that good results can be obtained in this way.
 Perfecting the organizations' regular activities is an important part of
 strengthening party organizations at the basic level.   Our party is the van-
 guard of the proletariat and is a united militant collective composed of
 advanced proletarians.  One important reason why it has become the leading
 core of the broad masses and why it has invincible strength is that it is an
 organization.   Engels said:   "Organizations are the most important weapons."
 ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 19, p 284)   The combat effective-
 ness of rural party organizations at the basic level is to a great extent
 determined by whether the organizations' regular activities are perfected.
 If a party organization at the basic level does not have a strict system for
 its activities, or if it has had no activities for a long time, is it worthy
 of the name of organization?  The system of "three meetings and one lecture"
 (the party branch committee meeting, the-general meeting for all party mem-
 bers,                  the party group meeting and the party lecture) is indispensable for
 every party branch.   Some party branches have not had a meeting for half a
 year or even a full year.   They do not study or discuss the party's instruc-
 tions, principles and policies.   They do not investigate or study the
 problems in practical work or the ideological state of the cadres and masses.
 They do not propagate correct things; nor do they praise good people and
 good deeds.   They do not criticize erroneous things; nor do they combat
 evildoers and evil deeds.   If a party branch continues to act in such a way,
 how can it become a powerful fighting force?   Some people say that since
 implementation of the responsibility system in production, people have been
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 very particular about using their own time and that, therefore, the party's
 regular activities should be relaxed.  This viewpoint is wrong.  We must
 understand that since implementation of the production responsibility
 system, most party members and commune members-have carried out their
 activities individually.  It is necessary to carry out more strictly the
 system of regular activities.  Otherwise, party members and commune members
 will become slack and perfunctory, and in the end the party.organizations
 will be paralyzed and disorganized.  This is very dangerous.   Of course, we
 should be flexible in arranging time for holding meetings and for conducting
 party lectures.  We should do our best not to take up,.. or to take up as
 little as possible, the time for productive labor.  In short, if we want
 regular activities to be in line with the specific conditions of local
 places in a more appropriate way, we cannot but persist in the system of
 maintaining the party's regular activities.
 Public security in some rural areas is bad, and so is the general mood of
 society.  This is closely related to the unhealthy tendency or even criminal
 activities of some party members and cadres.   If a party member or a cadre
 is light fingered, he will not be able to carry out mass work and change
 the general mood of society.  Why is it that gambling, superstitious activ-
 ities, and speculation and profiteering in some places, smuggling. activities
 in some coastal areas and border regions, and abnormal religious activities
 in some regions of minority nationalities are so rampant?  The reason is
 that either some party members and cadres have directly participated in
 these activities or that these activities are indirectly related to them.
 This phenomenon must not be allowed to continue.   Correcting unhealthy
 tendencies in the party and seriously punishing party members and cadres
 who have broken the law and engaged in criminal activities have an important
 bearing on enhancing the party's combat effectiveness and changing the gen-
 eral mood of society.  At present, we must regard the struggle against
 criminal activities in the economic field as an important part of strengthen-
 ing the rural party organizations at the basic level.  With regard to party
 members and cadres who indulge in unhealthy tendencies, we must criticize
 and educate them, and help them to realize their mistakes and resolutely
 correct them.  With regard to a small number of party members and cadres who
 have violated law and discipline, we must seriously punish them according to
 party discipline and state law.   We must not tolerate their crimes.   Other-
 wise, evil will spell ruin if left unchecked, and party organizations at the
 basic level will not be able to be strengthened.
 The task of strengthening rural party organizations at the basic level is
 arduous.   How should we do it?  In some places experiences have been accumu-
 lated.  According to an investigation, the experiences are mainly as follows:
 Some leading groups of party organizations at the basic level have been.
 rectified through summing up their experiences in work; some leading groups
 of party branches have been reelected in a democratic way according to the
 party constitution to realize rectification; and some party organizations
 at the basic level have carried out all-round rectification by turns and in
 groups.   These methods have brought good results.   They are feasible.  When
 dealing with specific problems, the localities may try to find their own
 ways.   No rigid uniformity should be sought.   But one point must be stressed,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 namely, no matter what methods are adopted, higher party organizations
 should send their members to assist party organizations at the basic level.
 Particularly with. regard to party organizations at the basic level which
 are already in a state of paralysis or semiparalysis, their problems will
 not be solved if they do not make great efforts, even though the higher
 party organizations might send their members to assist the rectification work
 at the basic level.  Because various unhealthy tendencies are still growing
 and spreading over all these places, it is not easy to distinguish problems,
 and it is even more difficult to solve problems.  We must not belittle these
 things.
 To strengthen rural party organizations at the basic level, party committees
 at all levels must change the situation in which the party does not promote
 the party's cause.  Although party committees have many things to attend to,
 they must not overlook the building of the party.   Under the present circum-
 stances in which rural party organizations at the basic level are confronted
 with many problems, we must devote more effort to strengthening our investi-
 gation and study, and carry out the work in this respect step by step, in a
 planned way and by stressing focal points.   Particularly in places where the
 corrosive influence of capitalist ideology and the tendency of bourgeois
 liberalization are serious, we must do our best to rectify party organiza-
 tions at the basic level which are in a state of paralysis or semiparalysis.
 Otherwise, the party organizations in these places will exist only in name
 but not in reality, and the communist methods will vanish.   Some leading
 comrades of party committees only pay attention to economic work; the work
 of building the party has no place in their minds.   This phenomenon must be
 changed.   It is doubtlessly true that party committees must pay sufficient
 attention to economic work; the problem is how to carry out this work.  The
 CCP Central Committee has pointed out that we must do a good job in dividing
 party and government work.   This problem must be further solved.   Party com-
 mittees at all levels must emancipate themselves from their busy administra-
 tive affairs and from their vocational work, and put emphasis on doing a good
 job in building the party.   Only if we do a good job in building the party,
 only if we give full play to the role of party committees as the leadership
 cores, only if we give full play to the role of party branches as fighting
 bastions And only if party members can play an exemplary vanguard role, will
 there be a reliable guarantee for fulfilling various tasks.   Otherwise, the
 building of the party will be neglected, and the party organizations and
 party members will not be able to play their proper roles.  As a result, no
 matter how specifically we carry out economic work or any other work, it will
 be very difficult to achieve any success.  Of course, we cannot carry out
 party building in an isolated manner, but must carry it out in coordination
 with the central tasks at a given time and in a given place.   The building
 of rural party organizations at the basic level must be carried out in com-
 bination with the work of consolidating and perfecting the production
 responsibility system.  Otherwise, this work cannot be done well.

 BE BROAD-MINDED ABOUT REJUVENATING THE CADRE RANKS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 40-43
 [Article by Luo Yinghuai [5012 2019 2037]]
 [Text]  We are now faced with the extremely important task of selecting tens
 of thousands of middle-aged and young cadres to enter leading bodies at
 various levels and of making the leading bodies more revolutionary, younger,
 better educated and more professional.  This is the most vital problem we
 must solve in restructuring organs.   Ensuring that this task is done is the
 glorious duty of our veteran cadres.   Our veteran cadres must clearly under-
 stand their responsibility, be broad-minded about rejuvenating the cadre
 ranks, withdraw with lofty sentiment to the second or third lines, and make
 a final historical contribution to the party and people.
 To be broad-minded, we must first proceed from the overall and long-term
 interests of the party's cause and treat the problem of rejuvenating the
 cadre ranks with communist foresight and vision.
 The object of our struggle is to build a strong and modern socialist country
 and then realize communism, the most lofty ideal of mankind..   This is an
 extremely important and arduous undertaking requiring many generations of
 sustained struggle.   The continuity and carrying forward of the revolu-
 tionary cause of the proletariat require that we keep passing the baton from
 generation to generation.   This is a problem of old cadres handing their
 batons over to new cadres.   Comrade Mao Zedong said:   "If our party does not
 have a great many new cadres working in unity and cooperation with the old
 cadres, our cause will come to a dead end."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong,"
 Vol 3, p 782)   The historical experience of our party has proved that the
 work of selecting and training revolutionary successors and letting out-
 standing middle-aged and young cadres take over from old cadres not only has
 a bearing on advancing the revolutionary cause pioneered by the older genera-
 tion of proletarian revolutionaries but also a bearing on the future and
 destiny of the party and state.
 Take our army for example.  Here, it is even more important to speed up the
 rejuvenation of the cadre ranks.   Our army is a strong pillar of the

 dictatorship of the proletariat.  It shoulders the important task of defend-
 ing the nation, and is ready at all times to strike at invaders.  If war
 breaks out, it must fight large-scale battles, tough battles and battles
 under unfavorable conditions.  Even in peacetime it must carry out arduous
 tasks.  Therefore, this not only requires that the commanders and fighters
 at various levels have good military and political qualities, but also
 requires them to be physically fit and to be full of vim and vigor.  Only in
 this way can they cope with possible emergencies.  It has been more than half
 a century since the founding of our army.  Many of the old cadres have spent
 a whole generation fighting all over the country.  It is said that "old
 people still have high aspirations," but they are after all getting on in
 years and gradually losing their vigor.   Replacing the leading members and
 rejuvenating the cadre ranks has become an extremely urgent historical task
 facing our army.   If we do not step up the tempo, firmly grasp the "inter-
 planting" of new "seedlings" in the leading bodies at various levels and
 conscientiously solve the problem of rejuvenating the cadre ranks, we will
 be unable to fulfill the arduous task entrusted to us by the party.   In a
 military exercise held at a certain place in north China, the contrast was
 extremely vivid:   Large numbers of middle-aged and young cadres in the prime
 of life were active at various levels of command.   They were full of vim and
 vigor, full of spirit, were hard working in the tense and difficult situa-
 tion, and displayed the vitality and talent of the young.  However, although
 some of the overage comrades were full of high aspirations and worked
 tenaciously, they felt themselves unequal to the continuous tension and
 burden of work because of their physical conditions and energy levels.  At
 the end of the exercise, some of the old comrades emotionally said:   When we
 led the units into battle during the war years, we could go sleepless for
 several nights without feeling any fatigue.   During this exercise, we have
 only taken a few extra shifts, but we are already feeling the strain.   This
 is the result of age.   If we are like this during an exercise, how can com-
 rades who are old and in poor health lead units to fight large-scale battles,
 tough battles and battles under unfavorable conditions in war?  If we have to
 change the commanding officer at a critical juncture in a battle, we are
 bound to suffer a great disadvantage.  Many old comrades are deeply aware of
 this point.   Valuing the interests of the party above everything else and
 proceeding from the long-term construction of the units, they are seriously
 considering and handling the problem of rejuvenating the cadre ranks.  Their
 spirit of standing high and seeing farther ahead is worth advocating.
 For the sake of selecting middle-aged and young cadres and bringing up suc-
 cessors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, our party has made
 unremitting efforts since the 1960's and paid a high price for valuable
 experience.   In recent years, we have selected a number of cadres who are in
 the prime of life and possess both ability and political integrity to
 replenish leading bodies at various levels.  However, judging from the
 situation as a whole, progress in this work is still not fast enough, and
 there is still no basic change in the age structure of leading bodies at
 various levels.   If this situation were to continue, a temporary shortage
 of experienced cadres would be bound to appear, seriously jeopardizing our
 party's cause.   Therefore, stepping up the work of making the cadre ranks
 more revolutionary, younger, better educated and more professional is not

 only a project of vital and lasting importance, but also a task of immediate
 urgency.  At present, we already have the conditions for basically solving
 this problem. Since the smashing of the "gang of four," and particularly
 since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, our party
 has affirmed the correct political line, ideological line and organizational
 line, and we can place this problem on the agenda for solution.  At the same
 time, many old comrades with higher consciousness are still alive, and they
 can set the pace as well as overcome resistance.  As long as everyone unifies
 his understanding, acts selflessly and sets examples, this problem will not
 be difficult to solve.
 Some of our old comrades are highly dedicated to the cause of the revolution.
 They feel that they are still in good health and can still work for a few
 more years and make more contributions to the party.   This spirit is indeed
 highly commendable.   However, we should think a bit further ahead.   The num-
 ber of establishment personnel in a leading body is limited.   The greater the
 number of old cadres,  the less openings there will be for outstanding young
 cadres.   Some old comrades are definitely still able to work for a few more
 years.  However, if they work for a few more years, not only will the young
 cadres have several less years of tempering, but this will also create an
 "aging cycle" in the cadre ranks.  If the old cadres vacate their posts and
 let the outstanding young cadres receive tempering earlier, the time they
 work for the party will not be several years but will be 10 or 20 years.
 In this way we will be able to organizationally guarantee the continuity of
 the line, policies and principles of the party, there will be successors to
 our cause, and our cause will prosper and develop.   Therefore, promptly
 allowing young people to shoulder the burden and withdrawing to the second
 or third line to pass on experience, give help and set an example are a
 manifestation of farsightedness and concern for the party's cause.  At
 present, this is the foremost responsibility entrusted to our old comrades
 by history.   This plays a more significant role than working with all one's
 might for a few more years.
 To be broad-minded, we must have a correct attitude toward the young cadres
 after they have taken up leadership posts, and we must enthusiastically
 believe in, support, show concern for and help them.
 First, we must believe that the young cadres are capable of shouldering the
 burden of the revolutionary cause.   Stalin said:   "The youth are our future
 and our hope.   The youth have to take our place,  the place of old people.
 They have to carry our banner to final victory."    ("Collected Works of
 Stalin," Vol 13, p 226)   Comrade Mao Zedong compared the young people to the
 sun at 8 or 9 in the morning and placed his hope on them.  However, because
 of the force of habit, even now there are still people within our ranks who
 look down on young people.   They are worried that after taking up leadership
 posts "these young people will make mistakes because of their lack of
 experience, will let things fall apart because they are not authoritative
 enough and will make a mess of things by failing to carry out work properly."
 Actually, such anxieties and worries are groundless.  The old comrades

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 should think back on the process of their own growth.  During the revolu-
 tionary war years, were many of our present old comrades not commanding a
 division or an army in battle against the enemy at the age of 20 or 30?
 Chen Haisong, an army political commissar and also an outstanding young
 commander of the 9th Red Army, was a regimental political commissar at 18,
 a divisional political commissar at 19 and an army political commissar at 20.
 He was only 22 when he died, but he had already commanded units in many
 brilliant battles.  At that time, the leadership had such great faith in us
 and allowed us to shoulder important leadership work.  At present, in the new
 generation growing up under the education and training of the party, many
 people are politically and ideologically much better than we were at that
 time, especially in the field of cultural and scientific knowledge.  As long
 as we believe in them and boldly allow them to temper themselves in leader-
 ship posts, they will grow up very quickly.  As a matter of fact, many of the
 middle-aged and young cadres have been very outstanding in their work after
 taking up leadership posts.   Divisional commanders and political commissars
 of about 40, regimental commanders and political commissars of about 30, and
 battalion commanders and political instructors in their 20's are mostly able
 to lead units well.  In a military exercise held in a certain part of north
 China, the overwhelming majority of middle-aged and young cadres displayed
 fairly high command ability and creativeness.   Four young regimental com-
 manders of a certain division fulfilled their tasks in an outstanding manner,
 and all of them rendered meritorious service and received awards.  This is.a
 very good example.
 Second, we must energetically support the work of middle-aged and young
 cadres.  Old comrades, educated for a long time by the party, have richer
 experience.  Whether enthusiastic support and help can be given to young
 cadres has a very important bearing on whether they are able to grow up as
 quickly as possible.   The overwhelming majority of our old cadres have done
 very well in this respect.   They are deeply conscious of the righteousness
 of the cause and have actively created conditions for the growth of young
 cadres.   They are enthusiastically and patiently passing on experience,
 giving help and setting an example.  However, there is also a small handful
 of comrades who are able to enthusiastically support the work of young
 cadres working. under them, but'when the young cadres are of the same grade
 or have outstripped them, they do not feel so comfortable.  This is incor-
 rect.   Zheng Banqiao of the Qing dynasty said in a poem:   "The new bamboo
 branches are taller than the old bamboo branches.   They depend wholly on the
 support of the old stems.  Next year there will be more new branches.  Bamboo
 a hundred feet tall surrounds the pond."  The new bamboo branches are taller
 than the old bamboo branches and the new branches of tomorrow will grow into
 bamboo a hundred feet tall because of the support of the old bamboo branches
 and old stems.   The growth of young cadres is the same.  Indigo blue is
 extracted from the indigo plant but is bluer than the plant it comes from.
 That those who come after surpass the old-timers is a universal law govern-
 ing the development of things.   This is a manifestation of the prosperity
 and development of our party's cause, and the old comrades should feel
 heartened.  We must take delight in and be good at becoming "a human ladder,"
 help the young cadres "climb" to leadership posts at various levels, and
 allow them to give full play to their wisdom and ability at appropriate
 posts and in a broad field.

 Furthermore, we must correctly handle. the shortcomings of young cadres.
 Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us that we must allow cadres to make
 mistakes and to correct their mistakes.  In everything, one divides into
 two.  The same as other cadres, young cadres cannot help having this or that
 kind of shortcoming, or making this or that mistake in their work.  Par-
 ticularly when they lack experience, it is easier for this or that kind of
 problem to appear.  This is a normal phenomenon.  However, there is a kind
 of abnormal condition at present, namely, when a shortcoming occurs or a
 mistake is made by old cadres, it can easily be forgiven but when the same
 shortcoming occurs or mistake is made by a young cadre, it will invariably
 lead to endless discussions and might even create a scandal.  It might be
 correct to set stricter demands on the young cadres, but "there is no pure
 gold and no one is perfect."  Not allowing them to have shortcomings and make
 mistakes is asking too much from them, and this is metaphysical and wrong.
 The correct attitude in dealing with young cadres is to judge the whole of
 their work and particularly their essence and principal aspects.  When they
 have shortcomings and make mistakes, the old cadres must help them to analyze
 the cause, sum up past experiences and lessons, and study ways to improve,
 and when necessary, help them shoulder responsibility so that they will not
 become overcautious just because of problems in their work.  At the same
 time, the old cadres must encourage them to boldly temper themselves, learn
 from "a fall into the pit, a gain in the wit," and continue to mature.
 Naturally, we must strictly examine and carefully choose the young cadres
 preparing to enter leading bodies.  We must pay close attention to selection
 standards.  We must select cadres in accordance with the criteria put forth
 by the CCP Central Committee and thoroughly and carefully examine them one
 by one.  We must understand clearly the whole of their history, mainly
 their stand during the "Great Cultural Revolution" and particularly their
 attitude toward the line, principles and policies of the party since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee.  We must ensure that
 young cadres entering leading bodies will be politically of one heart and
 mind with the CCP Central Committee, and will be pure and dependable.  We
 absolutely cannot allow those who got their start through rebellion, who
 are seriously affected by the factionalist mentality, who have taken part in
 beating, smashing and looting, and who resist the line, principles and poli-
 cies of the party, to get into the leading body.  At the same time, we must
 also pay attention to their military skills and vocational levels.  We must
 select cadres on the basis of the unity of their ability and political
 integrity.   If old comrades do not make the effort in selecting the right
 people or do not properly hand over the work of the revolution, they will be
 making an historical mistake.
 To be broad-minded, we must also handle correctly the question of withdraw-
 ing to the second or third lines.   To select and utilize outstanding young
 cadres and make the leading body revolutionary, younger, better educated and
 more professional, we must arrange for some of the old cadres to leave their
 posts to convalesce, retire or withdraw to the second line.   There will be
 people coming in and going out, and going out is for the sake of making room

 for people coming in.   This is the demand of the development of the revolu-
 tionary cause.  There is a question of how to properly settle and look after
 these old comrades.  We have already done a great deal of work in this
 respect as well as made quite a bit of progress, but there are still many
 problems. This is mainly because "when a person leaves, the tea gets cold"
 and the attention given to old comrades who have withdrawn to the second or
 third lines has not been as good as when they were in office, and this has
 caused anxieties among some of the old comrades who are about to leave their
 posts to convalesce or to retire.   The reason for this situation is mainly
 because some comrades do not have a correct understanding of why the old
 comrades are withdrawing to the second or third lines.  In particular, the
 bad habit of "snobbishness" of the former society is still reflected in the
 question of dealing with old cadres leaving their posts to convalesce or
 retire.  These comrades do not understand that, in working for scores of
 years in the service of the country, these old comrades have made tremendous
 contributions to the liberation of the motherland and the cause of socialist
 construction.   The old cadres are the hardcore force of the cause of the
 party and the meritorious officers of the state, and they should be respected
 and looked after when they become old or senile.   Moreover, the bad habit of
 "snobbishness" is opposed to our fine national tradition of honoring the old
 and the virtuous.  It runs counter to our party's policy for old cadres and
 is the moribund consciousness of the exploiting class.  On the other hand,
 a handful of old comrades also sense that they have "lost stature" since
 leaving a leading body and feel "ashamed."  This is a wrong impression.   Old
 comrades who withdraw to the second or third lines and vacate their posts for
 middle-aged and young cadres are making an important contribution to rejuve-
 nating a leading body.   This is a glorious thing and should be acclaimed by
 society.   After withdrawing to the second or third lines, the old cadres are
 still a very important political force in our party and state, and if health
 permits, they can still continue to play their role.  Especially after cast-
 ing off daily routine, the old cadres can devote their energy toward offer-
 ing ideas and making suggestions on major issues of party, state and army
 building.  At the same time, many of them have an intimate understanding of
 the glorious tradition of the party and are familiar with the glorious
 history of our party and our army.  By writing memoirs and teaching by
 personal example as well as verbal instruction, they can contribute to the
 construction of socialist spiritual civilization.  In fact, some old comrades
 have already made achievements in this respect, and this is a role which can
 hardly be played by other people.
 The CCP Central Committee, the State Council and the Military Commission of
 the Central Committee have already adopted many effective measures for look-
 ing after the livelihood of the old comrades leaving their posts to convalesce
 or retiring, and they are now studying, perfecting and setting up the neces-
 sary rules and regulations.  However, because the level of productive forces
 in our country is still not high and the state is still faced with many
 difficulties, some of these problems cannot be solved right away.  Our old
 comrades must make allowance for the difficulties of the state and adopt a
 correct attitude toward them.  When our old comrades joined the revolution,
 their only thought was to emancipate themselves and seek liberation.  Who
 gave a thought to a high position and a handsome salary at a future date?!

 Numerous revolutionary martyrs lost their heads, shed blood and sacrificed
 their lives without even tasting the joy of revolutionary victory.  Compared
 to them, how can we, the lucky survivors, fuss about material treatment?
 We communists consider it our duty to liberate all mankind, and we have
 vowed to persevere in the course of working for the interests of the people.
 While in office we must conscientiously work to the best of our ability.
 After withdrawing to the second or third lines, we must still work hard
 and maintain revolutionary integrity in our later years.

 ON THE QUESTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA
 I
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 pp 44-48
 [Article by Shen Baoxiang [3088 1405 6116], Wang Chengquan [3769 6134 2938]
 and Li Zerui [2621 3419 6904]]
 [Text]   In current international activities, the problem of human rights
 occupies a certain place.   Discussing or examining the problem of human
 rights is one aspect of the activities of the United Nations.  States with
 different social systems, different political interests and different degrees
 of economic development, and groups and persons with different political
 leanings, have put forward their own ideas of human rights.  Therefore, the
 problem of human rights is of an unprecedentedly comprehensive and compli-
 cated nature.   Concerning the current complicated struggle about the problem
 of human rights on the international scene, we must make a serious analysis
 or study.  We must adhere to our own principled stand and strive to main-
 tain world peace and safeguard the right of self-determination and the
 fundamental human rights of the people of various countries.
 Origin of Human Rights
 To clarify the current problem of human rights on the international scene,
 we must review the development of the history of human rights.
 Human rights represented, the theory, idea or slogan put forth by the Western
 bourgeoisie 2 or 3 centuries ago.   To counter the privileges and divine
 rights of feudal aristocrats and monks and priests in the Middle Ages,
 enlightened bourgeois thinkers originated the idea of "innate human rights"
 and of freedom, equality, the pursuit of happiness and other human rights.
 Such an idea became an effective ideological weapon of the rising-bour-
 geoisie in fighting feudal despotic rule.   In 1776, the "Declaration of
 Independence" of the United States of America stated that "all men are
 created equal;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalien-
 able rights; that among them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
 This was the first time that the bourgeoisie had affirmed, in the form of a
 political program, the idea of human rights that it had conceived.   Marx
 considered this document as the "first declaration of human rights."   In
 1789,  the constitutional congress produced by the French bourgeois revolu-
 tion adopted the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen," or

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 what people usually call the "Declaration of Human Rights."  It declared:
 "People are born free and equal and are meant to always remain so."
 People's innate rights are "freedom, property, safety and resistance against
 oppression."  This declaration became the preface to the French Constitution.
 It advanced for the first time the slogan of "human rights" in the form of
 law.  The "Declaration of Human Rights" declared an end to the rule of the
 feudal privileged class in the Middle Ages and the establishment of the
 ruling position of bourgeois politics.
 The idea or slogan of human rights played a very positive role in history.
 It reflected the features of an historical period.  For a long period of
 time, this slogan had a far-reaching influence on the capitalist world.  The
 slogan of human rights supposedly covered all people--people who shared
 common rights.   It was a slogan of a universal nature.   But, actually, the
 bourgeois slogan of human rights gave expression to the demands of the rising
 bourgeoisie in the most general terms of rights.   In the name of human rights,
 the bourgeoisie replaced the feudal lords' special privileges and hereditary
 privileges with its own moneyed privileges.   The so-called right to freedom
 .is chiefly the freedom to own private property.   The so-called right to
 pursue happiness is actually the right to exploit labor in an unrestricted
 way and the right to pursue wealth.  Just as Marx pointed out:  "Human rights
 are privileges in themselves."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3,
 p 229)  In capitalist society, human rights for the proletariat and the masses
 of laboring people are of a highly fraudulent and deceptive nature.
 For a very long period of time, human rights existed merely as principles
 for political life and legislation in some countries.   The widespread applica-
 tion of human rights in international relations, and the universal acceptance
 by international society of human rights as a standard, began during World
 War II and especially after the founding of the United Nations.   During
 World War II, the fascist outrages of Germany, Italy and Japan, which ruth-
 lessly killed the people of various countries, aroused the anger of the
 world.   There was a widespread demand for the protection of human rights
 and a call for respecting fundamental human rights as the aim of postwar
 international relations.   The "United Nations Charter," adopted in 1945,
 declared:   It was decided to save "future generations from again suffering
 the catastrophic effects of war twice experienced by the present generation
 and to reaffirm fundamental human rights, human dignity and values and also
 the faith in the right of equality between men and women and between big and
 small countries."  Respect for human rights has since become an important
 problem in international political struggle.
 New Developments in the Concept of Human Rights
 The concept of rights has always developed in accordance with the develop-
 ment of history.   Human rights are no exception.   As time marches on, given
 changes in the economic and political situation, the emergence of new
 political forces and the development of various struggles in international
 society, the concept of human rights inevitably breaks out of the confines
 of the original Western bourgeois version.   At present, the concept of
 human rights advocated on the international scene, chiefly within the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 framework of the United Nations, is a far cry from the version put forth and
 upheld by the bourgeoisie in the 17th and 18th centuries.  It is marked by
 important changes in the following two respects.
 1.  For a long period of time, the bourgeoisie upheld the right to possess
 private property as the most important of its human rights. On the other
 hand, it ruthlessly exploited workers leaving them in dire straits.  After
 World War II, the struggle of the working class in capitalist countries
 which asserted its rights reached an unprecedented height.  This forced the
 bourgeoisie to adopt domestically some so-called welfare policies, but
 actually "in the long run, people paid for what they got."  On the inter-
 national scene, economic, social and cultural rights were also incorporated
 into the UN pact on human rights.   In 1966, the United Nations adopted two
 important conventions on human rights:   the "International Convention on
 Civil Rights and Political Rights" and the "International Convention on
 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights."   (These two conventions together with
 the "World Declaration of Human Rights" are generally known as the "Inter-
 national Constitution on Human Rights.")   The latter stipulates that every-
 one should have the right to work and be assured of proper and good working
 conditions and of the right to organize trade unions, the right to receive
 education,  the right to share in cultural life, the right to enjoy social
 protection, and other rights.   The advancement of economic rights and social
 and cultural rights has caused the concept of human rights to break out of
 the narrow confines of its original version.
 2.  Another important change in the concept of human rights was the addition
 of the right of self-determination and the right of development for the
 people of colonies and dependencies in Asia, Africa and Latin America.  When
 the bourgeoisie was vigorously advocating human rights in the mother coun-
 tries of capital, they were carrying out ruthless exploitation and naked
 robbery in a large number of colonies, semicolonies and dependencies.   The
 colonialists and imperialists never recognized any human rights for the
 people of these countries and areas.  After World War II, the national
 liberation movements among the people of colonies grew.  Many colonies
 won independence and joined the United Nations.   They participated in inter-
 national political activities and put forth their own ideas of human rights.
 In recent years,  the Third World countries have voiced in more clearcut terms
 their opposition to "any people monopolizing the interpretation of human
 rights" and their opposition to the human rights activities of the United
 Nations "being guided only by European standards, as in the past."  The 7th
 UN General Assembly [UNGA] in 1952 and the Asian-African conference held in
 Bandung in 1955 affirmed national self-determination as "the prerequisite
 for fundamental human rights."  Thus, the protection of human rights was
 linked with national self-determination for the people of colonies.  In 1960,
 thanks to the efforts of newly independent countries in Asia, Africa and
 Latin America, UNGA adopted the "Declaration Granting Independence to
 Colonial Countries and People," and announced that "all people have the
 right to self-determination."   It was pointed out that "subjecting a people
 to conquest, rule and exploitation by foreign countries is a negation of
 fundamental human rights and a violation of the UN Charter."  This declara-
 tion affirms in clearcut terms that the right of self-determination for the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 people of colonies was a fundamental human right.  In the 1970's, the strug-
 gle in the United Nations of the Third World countries in the field of human
 rights grew fiercer.  The concept of human rights was continuously injected
 with new content.  In 1977, the 32d UNGA passed with an overwhelming majority
 vote a resolution (Resolution No 32/130) on the new concept of human rights
 put forth by the Third World countries.  A concept was advanced for the
 United Nations to take into consideration in the future the promotion of
 human rights and basic freedoms.  This resolution shows that human rights do
 not just mean individual rights and basic freedoms; they also cover the
 rights and basic freedoms of a nation and its people.  The resolution
 stresses that in UN human rights activities, priority should be given to
 solving "matters of serious and large-scale encroachment on the human rights
 of the people and individuals of countries which have been affected by racial
 segregation; all forms of racial discrimination, colonialism, foreign rule
 and foreign occupation and aggression; threats to national sovereignty,
 national unity and territorial integrity; and refusal to recognize national
 self-determination and the fundamental right of.countries to exercise full
 sovereignty over their own wealth and natural resources."  This spirit is
 in line with the prevailing conditions of international society and is
 therefore correct.  The resolution also pointed out that sustained progress
 in the area of human rights depends on rational and effective domestic and
 international policies for economic and social development.   The continuous
 existence of an unfair international economic order seriously hampers the
 exercise of economic, social and cultural rights by developing countries.
 The establishment of a new international economic order is a factor in
 effectively promoting human rights and basic freedoms.  In 1979, the UN
 Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution stressing the right of
 development as a fundamental human right.   Thus, the concept of human rights
 took on additional meaning:   the upholding of national independence by the
 people of various countries, chiefly Third World countries, the exercise of
 the freedom to control their natural wealth and resources and to develop
 their economy, and their opposition to foreign aggression and oppression.
 Thus, the struggle to win and uphold human rights was linked with the
 struggle against imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism.
 This new concept of human rights has reflected the historical features of
 this era of ours from a certain point of view.   But where the problem of
 human rights is concerned, the echoes of the old era can sometimes still
 be heard.
 Political activists and scholars in certain Western countries have adhered
 to the traditional narrow concept of human rights and one-sidedly stressed
 the individual's human rights, advocating absolute freedom for the indi-
 vidual and claiming that the individual's human rights provide "basic con-
 ditions for economic development."  This shows contempt for the realities
 of international politics.   It might be asked:  How can there be :individual
 rights and freedom when a nation has been deprived of its right of self-
 determination, or a country has been occupied by aggressors, or the whole
 nation and the people are in slavery, and when a country has been deprived
 of its sovereignty over its wealth and natural resources and is under the
 shackles of colonialism?   Given such a situation, how can there be basic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 conditions for economic development?  The fact is that in the world today,
 certain countries and nations are still placed in such a state owing to the
 havoc caused by hegemonism, imperialism and colonialism.  Obviously, uphold-
 ing national rights in these areas is a primary prerequisite for respecting
 the individual's human rights.  If the fact of national rights being seri-
 ously encroached upon is ignored and much is made of the individual's
 human rights, then this can only be interpreted as hypocrisy and deception.
 Complicated Struggle Under the Banner of Human Rights
 Human rights activities within the framework of the United Nations represent
 the main aspect of the international struggle for human rights.   But the
 area of struggle for human rights is actually much wider.   The complicated
 struggle for human rights on the international scene is chiefly marked by
 the following several situations, with various essential differences.
 First,  the efforts of a large number of Third World countries and some
 countries upholding justice in revealing and fighting large-scale encroach-
 ment on human rights by hegemonism, imperialism and colonialism and by
 certain autocratic regimes.   In recent years, the UN Human Rights Committee
 has adopted resolutions condemning the foreign armed invasions of Afghanistan
 and Kampuchea, interference with national self-determination, the creation of
 large numbers of refugees, and large-scale and serious encroachment on human
 rights.  At UN conferences, the representatives of Third World countries have
 also condemned the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination pursued by
 the South African authorities and Israel's persecution of the Palestinian
 people, which represent large-scale and serious encroachment upon human
 rights.
 Second, there is the struggle of the Third World countries in opposing the
 rich countries' exploitation of their poor counterparts and achieving the
 right of development in order to establish a new international economic
 order.   Thanks to the efforts of Third World countries, UN conferences
 adopted declarations and resolutions explicitly calling for the establish-
 ment of a new international economic order, stipulating the right of every
 country to freely exercise full and permanent sovereignty over its wealth
 and natural resources, and urging the adoption of measures to improve the
 economic conditions of developing countries.  But such a proper demand for
 the development of human rights has met with stiff opposition from rich
 countries that make a ballyhoo about human rights.  'Therefore, the actual
 results have been limited.
 Third,  there is the promotion of human rights activities in social, humani-
 tarian, cultural and other fields.  There are such activities as:   elimina-
 tion of discrimination against women, realization of the right of equality
 between men and women, concern for the growth of youth and children,
 improvement of the lives of old or crippled people, stimulation of educa-
 tional and scientific development, and so forth.   In these respects, the
 United Nations has adopted a series of declarations and formulated many
 international conventions, such as the "Declaration of Social Progress and
 Development," the "Declaration of Juvenile Rights," the "Declaration of

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100280001-7
 Promotion Among Young People of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and
 Undcrs.Lnn ding Between the Peoples of Various Countries," the "Convention
 on the Political Rights of Women," the "International Convention on
 Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women," the "Declaration of
 the Rights of the Crippled," the "Pact on the Position of Refugees," and
 pacts calling for the prohibition of trading in human beings, forced prosti-
 tution, and so forth.  Focusing on these social and humanitarian matters,
 the United Nations and many countries have launched extensive activities
 along various lines.
 Fourth,  there is the dispute between two superpowers centering on human
 rights.  At UN and other international conferences, the two superpowers, the
 Soviet Union and the United States, have constantly seized on the problem of
 human rights as an excuse to attack each other.   The United States has
 accused the Soviet Union of encroaching upon the fundamental human rights
 of East European countries.  The Soviet Union on.its part has accused the
 United States of staging a "human rights propaganda war."  The Soviet Union
 has also collected data and made a countercharge about U.S. encroachment on
 human rights.  All the heated exchanges between the Soviet Union and the
 United States centering on the problem of human rights are by no means
 prompted by real concern over human rights.   They are motivated rather by
 what they seek in their contest for hegemony.   Hegemonism itself is a nega-
 tion of fundamental human rights.  The Soviet Union's defense of the Viet-
 namese authorities' large-scale eviction of refugees, which is a serious
 encroachment upon human rights, and the United States' consistent support
 for South Africa's policy of apartheid and for Israeli expansionism show
 that all the ballyhoo they make about human rights is hypocritical.
 Fifth, the bourgeoisie and others who have ulterior motives use human rights
 to attack socialism.  Imperialism and the bourgeoisie of the West have never
 eased up in using human rights to attack and slander our country, aiming to
 score an ideological penetration against us.  The propaganda machine of the
 West have been continuously distorting their reporting on the social and human
 rights situations in our country.  They have slandered our socialist democratic
 system as a violation of the so-called "human rights."  Some people have even
 fanned and supported those people in our country who want to see the world
 plunged into chaos and who engage in illegal activities under the pretext of
 human rights.  These situations existed not only in the past, but also at
 present.   They will continue to exist in the future.  We must constantly
 guard against them.
 Adhere to a Principled Stand on the Problem of Human Rights
 As early as in 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai, who had led a Chinese delegation
 back from the Asian-African Bandung conference, pointed out in a report at
 an enlarged meeting of the NPC Standing Committee that the 10 principles
 embodied in the declaration of the Asian-African conference "cover also such
 principles as respecting fundamental human rights, respecting the principles
 and aims of the UN Charter, respecting justice and international obligations,
 the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and so forth.  All these
 have been consistently advocated by the Chinese people and have been con-
 sistently followed by China."  Our attitude toward the aims and principles
 of the UN Charter, including respect for fundamental human rights, is clearcut.

 Human rights are not a hollow slogan.  Nor do they represent an isolated
 problem.   Instead,  they are associated with the main problem of inter-
 national politics.   At present, the main factors underlying the tense and
 uncertain international situation, the threat to the safety of mankind and
 large-scale encroachment upon fundamental human rights, are hegemonism,
 imperialism and colonialism, and especially the contest for hegemony between
 the two superpowers,  the Soviet Union and the United States.   The struggle
 to safeguard fundamental human rights must be linked with the struggle
 against hegemonism, imperialism and colonialism and be made part of this
 struggle.  Only in this way can the struggle be meaningful and achieve
 results.
 Opposing the hegemonists' foreign aggression and large-scale and serious
 encroachment upon human rights is the primary duty of international society.
 The Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to occupy Afghanistan, forcing several
 millions of Afghan people to flee their own motherland as refugees, is a
 serious encroachment upon the fundamental human rights of the Afghan people.
 Soviet support for the Vietnamese hegemonists' invasion of Kampuchea and
 their slaughter of patriotic Kampuchean militarymen and civilians has
 deprived the Kampuchean people of the least semblance of human rights.   The
 acts of aggression on the part of Soviet and Vietnamese hegemonists contra-
 vene the aims and principles of the United Nations and are a gross viola-
 tion of the international charter on human rights.   U.S. support for
 Israel's serious encroachment upon the rights of the Palestinian people and
 U.S. support for the South African racists is common knowledge.  Such acts
 on their part have naturally been justly condemned by international opinion
 and have similarly met with the opposition of the Chinese government and
 people.
 The struggle of a large number of Third World countries for the right of
 economic development is another major task on the international scene to
 stimulate and safeguard fundamental human rights.  With the rich countries
 exploiting the poor ones, the people of a large number of Third World coun-
 tries are still in a state of poverty and backwardness.  The people of
 certain of the least developed countries fare even worse.  This is hard
 reality.   Therefore, to safeguard the Third World countries' right to
 develop their national economies and change the impoverished state of the
 people of these countries is a problem especially worthy of note in inter-
 national human rights activities and is a duty that falls squarely upon the
 United Nations, various international organizations and various countries,
 particularly the developed ones.
 Human rights activities promoted by the United Nations and certain inter-
 national organs in social, cultural and other fields, such as the elimina-
 tion of discrimination against women, protection of children, concern for
 old or crippled people, elimination of illiteracy, promotion of scientific
 and technical development, and so forth, are also human rights problems of
 concern to international society.   In these respects, we should strive to
 make our own contributions.   This is also in line with our existing policy.

 In international activities, the act of using the slogan of human rights as
 an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries cannot be
 allowed.  We have resolutely upheld the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence and have never interfered in the internal affairs of other
 countries. Similarly, we consider that the act of using the problem of
 human rights as an excuse to slander and attack our country and to interfere
 in the judicial and administrative affairs of our country is an unfriendly
 gesture to our country and people and an encroachment upon our sovereignty.
 This will, of course, meet with our rejection and opposition.
 Socialism and Human Rights
 The human rights put forth by the bourgeoisie played a positive role in
 history.   But such human rights are narrow and limited.   They chiefly serve
 to meet the demands of the bourgeoisie.  For the working class and other
 laboring people, they are of a highly fraudulent and deceptive nature.  Class
 exploitation is the most serious case of inequality in society.  The system
 of exploitation is the main cause of various phenomena of unequality in
 society.   Under a social system in which one man exploits another, the
 masses' demand for rights cannot really be met.  Marxists hold that only by
 fully developing social productive forces on the basis of the exploitation
 system having been eliminated can we enable the broadest mass of people to
 enjoy rights in political, economic, social, cultural and other fields.  And
 only in this way can we achieve rights on a universal basis.
 The socialist experience of China provides eloquent proof that only the
 socialist system can safeguard the full realization of the various rights of
 the people.   Our revolution led to the overthrow of the rule of imperialism
 and feudalism in China, a change in the political system of dictatorship by
 the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, and the founding of the regime of
 people's democracy.  With the system of exploitation having been eliminated
 by us, the social productive forces have developed greatly.  Scientific,
 educational and cultural undertakings have also made great progress.  All
 this has brought about a fundamental change in our people's political and
 economic statuses.  These results of our revolution and these rights won by
 the people have been solemnly incorporated in our constitution.   In our
 constitution, the stipulations about the inviolability of public property,
 the prohibition of exploitation, the protection of remuneration for an
 individual's labor, and the realization of the principle of "nothing to those
 who contribute no work" have provided a most solid basis for the protection
 of fundamental human rights in our country.  All unbiased people can see that
 the citizens' rights specified in our constitution cannot be compared with
 the rights of the individual advocated by the Western bourgeoisie.  Of course,
 apart from being restrained first of all by the social system, the rights
 enjoyed by the citizens of a country are restricted by economic, cultural and
 other objective conditions.   Therefore, for a developing socialist country
 like ours, the full realization of various civil rights must naturally follow
 a process.

 Our revolution has its own lofty ideals and objectives.  Meanwhile, we have
 also consistently fought to uphold human rights.  Socialism is synonymous
 with human rights.   In our country, it is impossible to detach ourselves
 from our socialist democracy and legal system and from socialist moderniza-
 tion in promoting what is called the problem of human rights.                      With the con-
 tinuous improvement of our socialist democracy and legal system and the
 development of modernization, the various rights enjoyed by the people of
 our country will surely continuously grow to a new level.  Facts will provide
 ever more convincing proof that the socialist system is also a reliable
 guarantee for the full realization of human rights.

 IS THIS REALLY FOR THE GOOD OF ALL AND THE COLLECTIVE?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 8, 16 Apr 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Li Zhuqi [2621 0031 0366]]
 [Text]  "We should be willing to spend any amount of money for the people";
 "Anything we do for the collective is perfectly justified."  Such are the
 fashionable excuses used by certain leaders of units, mines, shops and
 schools who, having no regard for the nation's laws, openly violate regula-
 tions concerning financial administration, and seek to feather their own
 nest at the nation's expense.
 Shielded by the banners of "for the good of all" and "for the collective,"
 they completely ignore the fundamental and long-term interests of the coun-
 try and the people and are willing to spend any amount of money and engage
 in any activity:   they unscrupulously hold back profits or other funds, and
 recklessly issue bonuses, subsidies and overtime payments; they misappro-
 priate "fringe benefits" under all. sorts of pretexts, and secretly use them
 for their own personal ends; they rack their brains for ways to force other
 units to pay "additional charges," siphoning off a portion of the ill-gotten
 wealth for themselves....  Activities such as these reduce the nation's
 financial income, damage the party's fine work style, corrupt the thinking
 of some of the cadres and masses, and have aroused angry opposition among
 the broad masses of staff, workers and cadres.
 Why is it that these leading cadres have been trying to fleece the nation by
 raising the banners of "for the good of all" and "for the collective."  The
 main reason is simply that these cadres, having yielded to the pressure of
 various unhealthy trends and evil practices, have begun pandering to the
 backward consciousness of a part of the masses.  Worse than this, however,
 is that they are unable to resist the allurement of money and material goods
 and hope to make a profit out of what they see as the "impunity of the
 masses."  They have calculated that rather than take both sides into con-
 sideration, bearing responsibility toward the state and trying to satisfy
 the "masses," it is better to throw their lot in with the "people."  In this
 way they can both "enjoy the support of the people" and gain material bene-
 fits.   These people have completely forgotten about the responsibility that
 must be shouldered by every Communist Party member and revolutionary.   To
 put it bluntly, they appear on the surface to be acting "for the good of

 all" and "for the collective"; in reality, however, they think only of them-
 selves.
 We are now engaged in building socialism and as far as ultimate aims are
 concerned, everything is for the people and for the collective.  We must at
 all times concern ourselves with the lives of the masses.  If we are to
 truly act in the interests of the people and the collective,.however, we
 must look at the situation as a whole.   It is imperative that we uphold the
 principle of "taking into account the interests of the state, the collective
 and the individual," and that we protect the nation's public property.  The
 life of the people must be gradually improved in line with the ceaseless
 development of production.  At present, our country's level of production is
 still too low, the nation's finances are still in the red and the people are
 by no means wealthy.  Equipped with a firm sense of being masters of their
 own affairs, however, millions of cadres and masses are working to overcome
 difficulties and build socialism.   Leading cadres should lead the masses in
 their own units in sharing the state's burdens and making a contribution to
 the four modernizations.  There are certain people, however, who have
 rejected the interests of the whole and are like mice gnawing at the very
 foundations of socialism.   In this way large amounts of property and money
 belonging to the state have been appropriated through both "legal" and
 illegal means.   Some people say:   "This is for the good of all and the
 collective.   It certainly won't end up in my pocket."  Even though this
 might be the case, one cannot escape the true facts of the situation.  Such
 notions of "the good of all" and "the collective" combined with actions
 which harm the overall interests of the nation will invariably lead to
 damage on a more serious scale.  All such actions violate the regulations
 concerning finance and seriously threaten the socialist cause.
 "One ant hole might cause the collapse of a thousand-li dike."  It is
 imperative that we go all out to block up the "mouse holes" in our country's
 socialist foundations.   If we fail to get rid of these "mouse holes" it
 will be difficult to achieve the objective of the four modernizations.
 There is a danger that the fruits of revolution and construction for which
 several generations have fought will be snatched away..  Every cadre who
 truly has the interests of the people at heart must accept the wide scope
 of his own duties and must firmly defend the socialist cause.  We also urge
 all people who speak about the "good of all and the collective" while
 acting to the detriment of the interests of both the. people and the collec-
 tive, to quickly wake up to the truth and stop trying to fool us.   It is
 dangerous!
