 Rumanians split ~'ith Soviets to Supper- Nuclear-Free Latin
 America
 On is November, the UN General Assembly voted Sa to a,
 with 14 abstentions, for a study to make Latin America a de-
 nuclearized zone.   `.7o points were notable about this vote:
 1.  Despite a history of espousing denuclearized zones,
 and especially a denuclearized zone in Europe (apac'.>'
 ?Ian), neither the Soviet Union nor _=oland voted for the
 measure :   they abst? ined.
 .  For the first time in UN history, the Rumanian rep-
 resentative did n o t follow the Soviet exa:mp?e, but voted:
 2 o r the measure.
 Most of the Bloc abstained out of (Soviet) regard for Cuba.
 Castro claims that there can be no Latin American nuclear-free
 -one unless the US formally promises not to base nuclear teapons
 in the Canal Tone, '7uerto Rico and elsewhere in Latin America,
 and unless the US returns Guantanamo to Cuba.  The US position
 is that we will support and abide by any nuclear-free zone, pro-
 viding it embraces the whole region in quest.-1on, does not upset
 the m litary balance of power (this is one major weakness of to
 Faoacki plan), is supported by all area nations, and provides
 for verification that there are no nuclear weapons.  These pro-
 visos,  and especially verification,  are what Cuba really objects
 to.    The  :''krem?in  is more anxious to caopease Castro (for fear he
 may turn to '?eking) than it 9 s to follow its old policy on de-
 ~zuclearized zones.  Actually, the Kremlin's old policy has been
 merely a disguised diplomatic attempt to break down the NATO
 position in Europe and win sympathy on other continents.
 The Rumanian delegation expressed support for Cuba's posi-
 tion, but their government felt it more important to abide by
 the old policy than to follow Moscow's shift.    u. an .a has re-
 cently had differences with the USSR over C31,,A and other matters,
 but unlike Alban-12,, she  is not merely exchanging one master  for
 another.  The Rumanian vote mar 1_-s a new step in the weakening of
 Communist discipline and in the emergence of independence in the
 Bloc.

 The pur ose of this spectacular ca a,ma-i a has been to b?beep:)
 the elections fro', to-,-.inn- place:   1)  by sabotaging public con-
 fidence in the viability of democratic governiient; 2)  by pro-
 Vo'si.ng' President Betancourt into taking repressive measures so
 severe as to alienate public support; 3)  by tempting the mili-
 tary to stage a coup d'etat; and 4)                        by frightening the voters,
 ,
 at the last moment,  into staying home on election day.   I-oEjever,
 over 90% of the voters went to the polls Sunday,  1 Decenber;
 the FALIT has   failed utterly to achieve any one of its objectives.
 All it has achieved is the senseless murder and maiming of hun-
 dreds of innocent people and the equally meaningless destruction
 of millions of dollars of property, representing a net -loss to
 Venezuela.
 Regardless of who is elected, we point out the lesson to
 be drawn from recent events in Venezuela:   that the rule of lace
 can be maintained and orderly political succession achieved if
 the responsible e' events in the government shoey enough deter--mina-
 ti on.    .hat  .any democratic  governments do not  realize is that
 of all subversion is  i n_i tiated: and carried out by a fraction
 of one per cent of the copulation.  :?resident Betancourt a,:r)ar-
 catjy realized this and consequently refused to be intimi, ated.

 focus his subversive exports upon their territories.   '"e use

 ?ROPAGAITDIST'S GUIDE TO COMMUNIST DI3SINSIONS
 # 17                                          0-22 November 1963
 Commentary
 `Principal Developments:
 1.  Only one major contribution to the Great Feud appeared
 during this period, a 19 November 10,003-word, joint People's
 Daily/  ed Flag diatribe entitled "Two Different Lines one
 - ues  on of  ar and ?eace."  Designated as the fifth in the
 series of such joint Chinese articles replying   rectly to the
 14 Sul  CPSU open letter, it is probably the most extreme oTTIl
 authoritative expressions by either of the protagonists to date,
 in its political/theoretical formulathns, its derisive denunci-
 ation of C?SU views, and its insulting personal attacks on
 x.hrushchev.   (See extensive review in Chronolog=y, November 10.)
 2.  The Albanians published another 7,030-word tirade
 against Tito which struck at Xhrushchev in passing, but a, did
 not equal in intensity some of the previous Albanian attacks.
 (November 90  The North Vietnamese monthly theoretical journal
 Zoe Tap carried a 5,003-word article ponderously defending "the
 1.avo u ionary Principles of the Two Moscow Statements, " '711   h
 not only denounced the "Yugoslav revisionist clique" but also
 criticized "a number of persons (w-ho) are claiming that the
 analysis of the Tito clique by the 1360 statement is wrong."
 (November 16.)
 3.  We have seen no reports of polemical materials in
 Soviet or pro-Soviet or;ang: during this period, although the
 Chinese claimed on the 15th that "the Soviet press is vigor-
 ously keeping up its anti-China campaign," publishing more than
 attacks, Soviet as well as foreign, from 23 October to
 13 November.  The few examples cited appeared before 3 November.
 4.  Meanwhile, various sources reported that the C71SJ had
 taken the initiative in exploring with the Chinese the prospects
 for holding a second round of bilateral talks between delegations
 o:' the two parties.    .  mes Moscow correspondent Tanner reported
 (Chrono, November 20).     n-ormed sources" as saying that consult-
 ations of this nature were taking place with members of the
 Chinese 3mbassy in Moscow, and that "it now appears that such a
 conference will take place in ?eiing.... early next yeas."  Other
 reports regarding discussions in Moscow during and following the
 October tevolution celebration have been conflicting.    epresenta-
 tives of several minor parties have returned home reporting that
 t .he Soviets made no attempt to draw them into any meetings.  A
 secret report tells of a 13 November meeting of top Belgian and
 r'rench C? leaders who agreed to issue a joint resolution reject-
 ing the Chinese line and expressing hope for an all-Parties con-
 ference as soon as possible.

 5.  Meanwhile, the important Japanese C? restated its
 "independent attitude toward the disputes in the international
 Communist movement" in terms attuned to the Chinese line and
 emphasized its views that "an international conference must be
 held only after necessary conditions are sufficiently provided
 through prior consultation." (November 10)  Rumania further de-
 monstrated her "independence" by voting in opposition to a USSR
 position (on a resolution barring nuclear weapons in Latin
 America) in the UN for the first time in history (November 19),
 while boss Georghiu-Dej decided to take up a long-standing in-
 vitation to visit Yugoslavia (November 22).
 S.  Among the smaller parties, the trends toward independ-
 ence and split continued.  The recent soul-searching in the
 Swedish Cl::- produced an amazing article in the Party's daily organ
 Ny _,agBy'prominent leader Landin categorical) y rejecting the
 i7=oscow Declaration and advocating complete autonomy in polm-7.
 with a reconstitution of the warty, goes o y in   e form of a
 "socialist peoples party." (Described in Chronology under Novem-
 ber 23, but the date has subsequently beem.determined to be
 Nov. J:  please make correction to your copies.)  In Britain, a
 nets pro-Chinese "Committee for Communist Unity" issued-'''-a manifests
 signed by 1S CPGB members appealing to all members to defeat the
 pro-Soviet "revisionists" in the Party leadership a nc_-es ab.  sh
 a  genuine  :_ ar y .    November 11
 Significance:
 Available evidence (neither clear-cut nor reliable) seems
 to indicate that the Soviets have now decided to undertake to
 schedule another round of W.ateral discussions with the Chinese
 and are unilaterally refraining from further polemics while the
 effort is being made.   It seems most likely, however, that the
 Soviets do not expect to achieve any resolution of the conflict
 by this effort, but are making it primarily as another step in
 avoiding the onus for further deterioration in relations and as
 further preparation for a possible excommunication move.  tdean-
 cwhile, the Chinese and their allies' have shown no sign of retreat
 from their extreme positions.  There has been no reported shift-
 ing in allegiance among the parties of the world, but evidence
 indicates some further growth in "independence" and splitting
 to dencies.

 CHRONOLOGY -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 #17                                         9-22 November 1963
 November 9 - The Albanian Zeri I Popullit publishes another
 7,000--w-o-rZ tirade,erAcs o  Treachery by the Renegade
 Tito," also denouncing "the hostile splitting activity of the
 N. Khrushchev group, which supports the Tito gang and follows
 in its footsteps."
 November 10 - The Japanese CP Sunday weekly Akahata carries
 an anonymous question---a-0--answer-type feature g v ng the
 Party's views on "the so-called 'international dispute."'
 It affirms that "the JCP takes an independent attitude toward
 disputes in the international Communist movement," and "does
 not state which party is right, who is right, or who should
 be supported for the advantage of the JCP."  However, it
 does answer "some people (who) contend that the CCP wants war"
 by stating "we believe that such a view is utterly unfounded"
 and that "the Japanese people . . . could not believe that
 the CPR Government and CP are warlike," and it expresses dis-
 approval of "the leaders of certain Communist parties" who
 started "open criticism of those parties which had not agreed
 with them" at the 1960 Moscow conference, specifically,
 criticism of the Albanian Workers Party and the Cam.
 The feature concludes by maintaining "that an interna-
 tional conference must be held only after necessary co nn itions
 are su    c en  y provided through prior consultation between-
 fraternal parties ..."  (The text was reprinted in -full in all
 Peking papers on the 12th.)
 November 11 - The British press reports that "a campaign to
 overthrow  the leadership of the Communist Party of Great
 Britain began over the weekend."  2,000 cop es o  a 5-page
 manifesto signed by 14 Communists who claim they represent
 "cadres" throughout Britain were mailed to leading Party
 workers:   it bitterly criticizes Soviet views and supports
 the Chinese, appeals to all Party members to "defeat the
 revisionists" in the Party leadership and establish a "genuine"
 C?.   It accuses Khrushchev of "outright betrayal" and attacks
 General Secretary Gollan, and Daily Worker editor Matthews
 for supporting him.   Secretary proem of the new British Com-
 mittee for Communist Unity is 34-year-old Michael Mccreery.
 November 12 - The Peking correspondent of the Yugoslav agency
 Tanyug reports on the meeting of the Chinese R    nat-People's
 congress due to open in Peking 17 November, noting that the
 pre-congress atmosphere is dominated by the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 'The general impression among observers in Peking, based on a
 whole series of facts and documents made public there, is that
 the only alternative which might be accepted by the CCP is the
 full and unconditional capitulation of the other Side,"

 'November 14 - Peeking People's Daily gives the full text of an
 article from the Malayan Monitor    ndon) commemorating the
 October Revolution anniversary which counterposed Lenin to the
 old and new revisionists.  "Lenin did not say: 'we are surrounded
 by world imperialism, therefore we must not start an insurrection
 lest we provoke a world holocaust'. . . Lenin did not say of the
 revolutionary movements then in being:  'fold it up, you are
 creating tensions; a single fire may start a worldwide confla-
 gration."  It predicts:  "The great Soviet land which saw the
 establishment of the first socialists to will shine again when
 the clouds have cleared."
 November 15 - The Chinese press features a "Joint statement by
 the    -   na Youth Federation and the Ceylonese Federation of
 Commun s  an    ogress ve You        es  re ease  in PRO g on
 e 14th.    NCNA says that   e  ocumen , "ratified recently by the
 two federations;"and signed by the vice president of the All-
 China federation and by two members of the Ceylon federation1.e
 Central Committee who "paid a friendly visit to China from 1S
 to 20 July at the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation,"
 declares agreement by both on "further consolidating and devel-
 oping the relations of friendship, unity, and cooperation
 between the two organizations, on the present international
 situation, and on major questions of the present world movement."
 November 16 - The November issue of the North Vietnam Party's
 eoreEical monthly Hoc Tap features a ponderous 5,  0-word
 editorial entitled "Let Us Resolutely Defend the Revolutionary
 Principles of The Two Moscow Statements."  Making the "attitude
 toward the Yugoslav revisionist clique" the touchstone of "Lenin-
 ism or revisionism," the article denounces the persons who
 "are claiming that the analysis of the Tito clique by the 1960
 statement is wrong.  They eulogize the Tito clique.. ...Mean-
 while they seek every means to isolate a number of true Marxist-
 Leninist parties . . . .  To say that dogmatism is the main
 danger for the present international Communist movement is to
 contravene completely the spirit of the two Moscow statements."
 November 16-17 - All Chinese papers on the 16th featured an
 NCNA report of the 15TE-To the effect that "the Soviet press
 is vigorously keeping up its anti-China campaign . . . .  A
 total of more than 2 000 articles and other ftems have so far
 been published for   a purpose.   Since 27 October, Soviet papers
 have given great publicity to what they call Khrushchev's appeal
 to China to discontinue open polemics, but their wanton attacks
 on China continued as usual after the so-called appeal was made.
 Incomplete figures show that from 28 October to 10 November the
 Soviet press published more than 80 editorials, Soviet as well
 as foreign articles, 'reader's letters,' caricatures and other
 items, all attacking the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people."
 On the occasion of the 30th annivers     of the establishment of
 diplomatic relations be weep the USSR and the US, the Chinese
 press reports on the 17th, that the Soviet papers published "a
 good number of articles advocating alliance with the U.S. in
 opposition to    na.   They also report   a           arg oorn,
 a U.S. spy arrested by USSR security organs, was released without
 trial because of the 'concern' of high U.S. officials."

 November 18 - A Cuban diplomatic mission arrives in Tirana, the
 Albanian capital,  o open a cuba4 Embassy.  An Albanla-h-Iffibassador
 has been in Havana almost two yearsbut the Cubans have hesitated
 lest such a move undermine Cuba's 'neutrality' in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute.  Observers saw the present move as a "slap at Moscow."
 November 19 - After a lapse of almost a month, the Chinese pub-
 lished the fifth in their drawn-out series of joint People's
 Dail/Red `Tag commentaries  a  ed to the 14 July (WSU open letter:
 a 10,000-word article en titled    o     eren    nes on the ques-
 tion of War and Peace."  (see Chrono ogy, September 6, 13t 26j,
 and October     or earlier articles in series).   it employs some
 of the most extreme formulations and insulting derision -: direerteca
 at Khrushchev by name -- yet to appear in any polemics.
 The first section, "The Lessons of History," details the
 "pack of lies on the question of war and peace" spread by "the
 renegade Kautsky" and his fellow "revisionists of the Second
 International," in whose footsteps Khrushchev is following.  The
 gist of the second section, headed "The Greatest Fraud," is in
 its opening sentence:  "There is no bigger lie than the designa-
 tion of the arch-enemy of world peace as a peace-loving angel....
 Yet the leaders of the CPSU hold that the chief representatives
 of U.S. imperialism love peace."  Turning to the CPSU open letter's
 question addressed to them{ "Do they really think that all
 bourgeois governments lack'all reason in everything they do7"
 the Chinese reply:  "In a class society there is no reason that
 can transcend class."   ey conclude   a :
 the U.S. imperialists have not
 become beautiful angels in spite of MrushiffievTs

 hard  ru  c ev tries to serve the           S. imperialists,
 ..e  they continue to slap Nhrushchev in the face
 and reveal the bankruptcy of    s ridiculous theories
 prettifying imperialism....
 In the third section, "The Question of the Possibility of
 Preventing      a New World War," the Chinese cite Mao, Lenin and
 Stalin (Stalin:   "To eliminate the inevitability of war, it is
 necessary to abolish imperialism.") to show how wrong Khrushchev
 is.     They go on to Mao's 1938 "famous thesis" that "political
 power grows out of the barrel of a gun," which the        enders
 have cited as evidence   is      a is  warlike":  "slanders like
 yours were refuted" by Mao, who 25 years ago noted that "some
 people ridicule us as advocates of the 'omnipotence of war "
 and answered "Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revo-
 lutionary war; that is good, not bad;     s   r
 "What is wrong with Comrade Mao Tse-tung's remark?   ...
 With their guns, the Chinese people have created a socialist
 political power.  All except imperialists and their lackeys can
 readily understand that this is a fine thing...."  The Chinese
 characterize as "nuclear fetishism and nuclear blackmail" the

 Soviet charge that they are hoping for a "head-on clash" between
 the Soviet Union and the United States:
 "Our answer is:  no, friends.  You had better
 stop your sensation-mongering cal
 The     is
 !ME -
 rm y opposed to a -head-on clash"  etween the
 Soviet Union and the United States, and not in words
 only.  In deeds, too, it has worked hard to avert
 direct armed conflict between them. Examples of
 this are the Korean war against U.S. aggression,
 in which we fought side by side with the Korean
 comrades, and our struggle against the United States
 in the Taiwan Strait.  We ourselves preferred to
 shoulder the heavy sacrifices necessary and stood
 in the first line of defense of the socialist cam
 so that   e Soviet  non might stay on the second
 line. ave the  ea ers o    e CzSU any sense of
 pro etarian morality when they concoct such lies?"
 The fourth section, "Fight or Capitulate," continues in
 the same vein.        "Tit-for-tat struggle" is "the correct fighting
 policy put forward  y M  e ales   communists. 11
 "The CPSU leaders assert that a tit-for-tat struggle
 aga ns            era   sm wITT lead to International
 tension.       Actually,   ru  c ev s wrong app roams
 to `negotiations is itself harmful to negotiations.
 The more Khrushchev retreats before the imperialists
 and the more he begs, the more the appetite or   e
 roper alas s will grow.  Khrushchev, who poses as
 the greatest devotee of negotiations in history, is
 a ways at unrequ ted  over and too often a laughing
 stock....
 The fifth section, "The Road in Defense of Peace and the
 Road Leading to War," is a brief summary of the features of the
 Chinese line on war and peace, juxtaposed against "the line
 pursued by the leaders of the CPSU (which) is diametrically
 opposed to our line, to the common line of all Marxist-Leninists
 and revolutionary people."
 November 19 (cont.) - The UN General Assembly's Political Com-
 m   ee approved a   tin American resolution aimed at barring
 nuclear weapons from Latin America by a vote of 89 to 0, with
 14 abstentions.  After delegates of the USSR  Bulgaria, Czech-

 on, all members of the Communist bloc abstained in   e vo  ng
 -- except Albania and Rumania.  This was said to be the first
 time   a Rumania has ever acted in opposition to a Soviet
 position in the UN.
 November 20 - The NYTimes carries a report by its Moscow corres-
 pondent Tanner who cimes "informed sources" to the effect that
 Soviet and Chinese Communist representatives (members of the
 nese Embassy) have been "conducting consultations here with
 a view to holding a conference o  their two parties on   eo Tog -

 Peking, "unless the consultations fail."  Tanner goes' on to say
 that "some observers here believe that the Russians agreed to
 another meeting with the Chinese because they wanted to avoid
 being blamed for bringing about a showdown at a world conference,
 not because they held any hope for success in the talks."
 November 20 - Swedish CP daily    Dag carries article by promi-
 nen            leader Lan  n  e aandiugamputonomy in "forming policy
 and judging tendencies, occurrences and events abroad."  He
 categorically rejects the Moscow Declaration of 1960 and advo-
 cates that   e               be reorganized and reconstItuted, possibly
 in the form of a "socialist peoples party."  Urges that CP
 acknowledge democratic character of Swedish Government,
 repudiate utilization of. the trade union movement for Party
 purposes, etc.  (Note:  report of this article received here
 was not specific on date; November 20 is assumed)
 November 21 - The Chinese press reports that, following the
 return. o  "ylon CF-Chairman wickremasinghe from Moscow, the
 Party's w  issued a statement attacking the CCP and the Albanian
 Workers Party to keep time to the baton of the Soviet CP leaders"
 and took punitive measures against two of its Politbureau mem-
 bers.  However, these measures "have met with opposition from
 many of its party organizations and members, as well as mass
 organizations," People's Daily devotes more than a page to "the
 full text of a statement issued by 10 members of the Ceylon CP
 CC on 27 September in refutation of" the CC statement of the 26th.
 (See Chronology, October 8, for earlier reference to the Ceylon
 CP resolution.)
 November 22 - Rumanian Party/State boss Gheoghe Gheorghiu-Dej
 arrives-"'in Ie gra es' at
 the head of a state delegation in response
 to a long-standing invitation to make a state visit.  Welcoming
 the visit, Belgrade Politika anticipates that "luestions of the
 international workers movement, international relations,, and
 bilateral relations will dominate the talks "   (in addition to
 the construction of tire   on  a es  y  oe ectric power system),
 and points out that "no disputed problems exist in Rumanian-
 Yugoslav relations that would make understanding and mutual
 cooperation impossible."

 La premiere section, "Les lecons de l'histoire , donne en detail
 "les foul.es de mensonges sur la question de guerre et de paix" re-
 pandus par "le renegat Kautsky" et par sea camaradea "revisionnistes
 de la 2e Internationale" dont Khrouchtchev embotte le pas.  L'essen-

 grand que de qualifier d'ange pacifique cet archiennemi de la paix
 mondiale...  Cependant, lea leaders du P.C.U.S. pretendent que lea
 principaux representants de l'imperialisme americainn soot pacifiques".
 Reprenant alors la question de la lettre ouverte du P.C.U.S. qui
 leur fut adressee:  "Pensent-ils reellement que tons lea gouverne-

 Chinois repondent:  "Dana une societe de classe it n'  a pas de rai-

 "Les leaders du P.C.U.S. affirment qu'une lutte coup

 EACKGROUND:  Recent coups d'etat in Africa, Asia, and
 Latin America have focused world attention upon an important
 phenomenon in the underdeveloped countries of the world:
 instability in government has come to be a sort of vicious
 circle.   It is one of the causes of the poverty and ignorance
 of the masses, and, at the same time, it encourages and
 facilitates violent action on the part of irresponsible
 groups, including the frequent seizure of power by the military.
 We define a stable government as one that can assure
 Its citizens and inter interested nationals of other governments
 that its policies will not change suddenly or radically over
 an extended period of time.  Totalitarian governments achieve
 a maximum degree of domestic stability by the arbitrary
 application of force.  Democratic, representative governments
 seek to achieve a sufficient degree of stability through
 popular support and conciliating the oftentimes conflict-
 ing demands and interests of all sectors of the population.
 The fact of instability has come to be more and more
 the number-one pro  elf the underdeveloped countries of the
 world:   and the former colonies of Asia and Africa, now inde-
 pendent nations, have only served to swell the ranks of the
 chronically unstable governments.  The countries of Latin
 America, having been independent for 150 years, have a long
 history of instability.   In the matter of military coups
 alone, the casual observer has the impression that Latin
 American nations prefer to solve the problem of presidential
 succession violently rather than constitutionally.   Indeed,
 during the 34-year period beginning in 1930 and ending in
 1C3, there were 103 changes of heads of state in Latin America
 by violent or illegal means.   In Mexico, the only exception
 to the general rule during this period, presidents have been
 elected and inaugurated in an orderly manner and according to
 the Constitution of 1917, the oldest constitution in force
 today in Latin Lmerica.   If Eomulo Betancourt is able to
 finish his constitutional term as president of Venezuela, it
 will be the first time in the history of that country that a
 legally elected president has been able to do so.
 Dictatorship, or the seizure of power by military force
 has not provided the answer to stability, especially in a
 world increasingly convinced that sovereignty resides in the
 people.  The dictator at first offers advantages in efficiency
 and promise of stable government.  The so-called oligarchy of
 many countries of Latin America has traditionally had recourse
 to the dictator to protect itself against the masses.  But they

 forget the implacable process by which, according to Lord Acton,
 "?ower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
 In addition, and by a logical dialectic, dictatorship generates
 an opposition composed of many decent elements, both in and out
 of the country, which becomes more and more popular, more and more
 respected.  The danger is not only that disruption accompanies
 the removal of a dictator, but that a respectable opposition may
 be captured by Communists and converted into a Castro-type force.
 The succeeding government may bring something far worse than the
 repressive administration of the military dictator it overthrew.
 Just as Simon Bolivar saw clearly the need for a balance
 between libertad y orden, the desire for stability should not
 be translated into an emphasis on order to the detriment of
 liberty.
 Few of the countries in the underdeveloped areas have been
 free from other chronic types of violence, such as:  mass
 demonstrations against the government; deliberate attempts to
 provoke the police to use clubs, tear gas, sabers, and even fire-
 arms; attempts by crganized labor to control the government
 through work stoppages or general strikes; seizure of private
 lands by armed peasants; indiscriminate planting of bombs in
 public places; senseless destruction of the property of both
 foreign-owned and domestic enterprises; the constant threat of
 nationalization that hangs over many foreign-owned properties;
 and  the continual plotting by elements of the military for the
 illegal seizure of the apparatus of government.
 United States concern over instability in governments in
 Latin America was underscored by President  ,ennedy in the address
 which he delivered on 1C November 1963 before the Inter-American
 press Association at its meeting in Miami Beach.  Giving voice
 to some long overdue truths about the Alliance for progress, he
 said:
 "Nor can the failure of some to meet the goals
 of the charter be placed wholly on the shortcomings
 of the Alliance.  No amount of external resources, no
 stabilization of commodity prices, no new Inter-
 American institutions, can bring progress to nations
 which do not have political stability and determined
 leadership.  No series of hemispheric agreements or
 elaborate machinery can help those who lack internal
 discipline; who are unwilling to make sacrifices, and
 renounce privileges.  No one who sends his money
 abroad, who is unwilling to invest in the future of
 his own country, can blame others for the deluge which
 threatens to overcome him."
 The causes of instability should not be sought exclusively
 in the  cover y, hunger, ignorance, or generally depressed condi-
 tions of the masses.  These are as much a result as a cause of
 instability.  poverty leads to dissatisfaction, agitation, dis-
 order and violence.   In turn, chronic instability alienates

 foreign and domestic capital, stifles initiative, makes for
 corruption in government and inefficiency in industry and
 agriculture.  A vicious circle is set in motion.
 Nor is a high per capita income such as in Prgentina and
 Venezuela, any guaranieability.
 Venezuela has one of the highest per capita incomes in Latin
 America but the indiscipline of erem     ggroups threatens
 the stability of this government perhaps more than anywhere
 else in the ;Western Hemisphere.
 en so, in most parts of the world, the submerged masses
 are easy marks for agitators and demagogues who promise land
 to the landless, bread to the hungry.  Injustice has come to
 be so much the rule rather than the exception that there is
 a widespread tendency for groups to prefer direct action to
 legal appeal.  Regardless of the righteousness of their cause,
 they have no faith in the governing authorities.  Thus, if the
 students of a university can be persuaded that the government
 is not giving their school enough money, or that the rector is
 incompetent, or that they should have to pay only half-fare on
 all public transportation, or that certain professors should be
 fired, -- then they will go on strike and physically occupy the
 campus until their demands are satisfied.   Sometimes the
 students are justified and sometimes they are not.  rut where
 stability -- law and order -- suffers is that most issues are
 never legally decided one way or the other.
 A clever Communist agitator may be able to persuade a
 community of half-starving peasants to seize the lands and
 stock of a wealthier, more progressive farmer.  The needs of
 the many are so real and the possessions of the few so obvious
 that it is difficult in such cases for those in authority to
 take measures necessary to maintain public order.  This situa-
 tion has brought about an attitude of tolerance toward arbitrary
 and illegal acts, which, when generalized, signifies the virtual
 abdication of the rule of law.
 Where the state permits one group to break the law because
 it has some semblance of moral right on its side, other groups
 are encouraged to do the same thing though they may have no
 moral justification whatever.  The apparatus of justice in a
 given country is normally concerned with whether an act is
 objectively legal or illegal, not whether it is subjectively
 moral or immoral.  To argue, as many presumably intelligent
 Latin Americans do, that it is moral, therefore should be legal,
 for the needy to take what they need by force is to encourage
 a subjective, ad hoc interpretation of objective, positive law.
 In such an atm-ospere, more and more people will tend to taste
 the law into their own hands, which will result in a breakdown
 in law and order, an end to stability.
 The advantages of stability among democratic governments
 thus become self evil t; Countries with stable governments
 will have fewer problems of public order and hence less danger

 25X1C10b 716 EE,VZ.  Poland:  Lard-Line Trend
 BACKGROUND:   Party chief Gomulka since his advent to
 power in 1755 has more or less unswervingly pursued his own
 peculiar policy line during an era of tortuous change of
 direction among other Communist states in fast Europe.  His
 goal for Poland is a national Communist welfare state with
 limited individual liberties and limited free enterprise.
 Me recognizes that the Poles could be brought to accept such
 a system only through slow persuasion but he is determined
 that the system will be ultimately accepted by them.   In
 following this road he has fluctuated between responsiveness
 to popular pressures for greater freedom, particularly
 freedom of expression, and insistence by hard-line Communists
 on stricter regime controls.
 Gomuiha was swept into his ;resent )osition in 1956 by
 the impact of an anti-Russian and revisionist (at least
 potentially anti-Communist), nationalist surge.  He was
 accepted, despite initial Soviet disapproval, by other Polish
 Party leaders as the only alternative to internal chaos,
 and the threat of consequent Soviet military intervention.
 wit of the historic meeting of the Central Committee of the
 United Polish "Jorkers Party (PZP,) in the autumn of 1956
 came relaxation of police  rule, an end to forced collectiviza-
 tion of agriculture, reaffirmation of the right of peasants
 to own land and a truce with the Roman Catholic church.
 These reforms earned for Poland the reputation of being the
 relatively most liberal country in the Soviet Bloc.  However,
 -- as liberalization was gradually curtailed over the follow-
 ing years -- it has become evident that much of the relaxation
 was owed to the weaknesses and not to the designs of the Party
 leadership.   Currently the Gomulka regime appears to have
 accelerated the curtailment of what still remains of the
 "Cctober gains" and finds itself now moving counter to new
 trends toward liberalization among other East European states
 of the Soviet Bloc.  While there is no proof that this
 hardened policy comes from other than party leader Gomulka, it
 may be attributable in part to diehard dogmatists who Gomulka
 has reinstated in certain key posts.  At the same time, unful-
 filled promises of more consumer goods have fostered growing
 bitterness among the people.   In a vicious circle of cause and
 effect, the productivity of labor has declined to a point
 bordering on sabotage and the country's economic stagnation
 has been deepening.   If Gomulka continues to impose harsher
 controls, he will place in jeopardy all of the public support
 and economic gains that have accrued to the regime as a
 result of the 19'56 reforms.  The pattern of tightening is

 evident in the realms of public expression and religion as
 well as in security.
 Freedom of Expression.  The Poles' strongest desires for
 emancipation are in this field and it is here that the Gomulka
 regime has most sharply curtailed earlier concessions.  The
 highly popular and revisionist weekly, Po Prostu, was closed
 only one year after the Polish October, signalling the regime's
 return to a more rigidly repressive policy.  The once flourish-
 ing discussion clubs of the young intellectuals have been closed.
 Distributors of offending books or periodicals have been jailed
 and prize winning plays, critical of the regime, have been
 banned by censors.  Progressive writer and editor Henryk Holland
 died in police custody in 1962, officially reported as a
 "suicide, but apparently in reprisal for having had close con-
 tacts with foreign journalists.  The freedom of writers to
 travel abroad has been severely restricted.  Finally, Warsaw's
 two influential literary weeklies, Nowa Nultura and Przeglad
 Kulturalny, were closed in 1963 and were replaced by  u  ura,
 the stated mission of which was to "serve the cause o
 many-faceted developments of socialist culture, stressing the
 achievements and perspectives of the cultural revolution in
 Poland."  Or, as Gomulka put it to the Thirteenth Plenum of
 the PZPR Central Committee in summer of 1963, "We do not and
 will not allow the propagation of ideas hostile to socialism,
 ideas that are harmful from the point of view of our educational
 work."  With the closure of these two weeklies, the Party has
 closed an era of outstanding Polish achievement in the creative
 fields of literature, art, theater and the cinema.  The editorial
 content of the new Kultura, while less dogmatic than feared,
 has reflected the emptiness of the socialist "cultural model."
 Creative talents and the deep desire for freedom of expression
 are still very much alive but they are silenced in Poland by
 the growing control of hard-line Party functionaries over the
 entire field of culture.  For broader coverage of this subject,
 see                "Eclipse of the Polish October," from Problems
 of Communism, ^ept-Oct 1963, included       in Press Comment ov1363.
 Religion.   Gomulka saw the church-state agreement of
 Detober 1956 only as establishing a modus vivendi based on the
 status quo.  Thus, in violation of the agreement concluded
 between Gomulka and Cardinal Wyszynski just prior to the
 parliamentary election of January 1957, religious instruction
 in public schools was subsequently curtailed.
 During an interview with the Le Monde editor-in-chief in
 1931, Gomulka replied to the question of whether religion was
 to disappear with the older generations under Poland's "own
 road" course by saying,
 "Religion is deeply anchored in the greatest part
 of our population.   It would be senseless for us
 t4 try to force changes and convictions of faith
 by administrative means.   . .  .    It is difficult

 to say how long religious belief will continue
 to exist in Poland.   Certainly for decades,
 possibly still longer.   . .  . The only thing we
 do not want is for the Church to be used in
 opposition to us and to socialism .  . .  .17
 GomulLka naturally failed to mention that he used pseudo-Roman
 Catholic political groups in an effort to weaken the influence
 of the church.  Nor has the regime by any nneans forsaken "admin-
 istrative means" against the church.   In 1963 a pattern of
 operations has emerged for regime seizure by force of property
 belonging to Roman Catholic religious orders, with geographic
 coordination of seizures apparently effected carefully in Vlarsaw.
 By the end of August 1963 all but one of the minor seminaries,
 devoted to the training of future clergy at high school level,
 had been closed by the State and  harassment of major seminaries
 had begun.  Nuns have been driven out of work in most of the
 former church hospitals, which were first made state property,
 and today nursing nuns operate only in sanatoria for the hope-
 lessly ill and for retarded children.  However, despite the
 regime's unacknowledged campaign against the church as an
 institution, individual religious freedom in the narrow sense
 of the term does continue to exist, both for religious minorities
 and for the Roman Catholic majority.
 Agriculture.   Agriculture has remained a major problem
 despite the fa-e-f-that it has been relatively more successful in
 Poland than in most Communist states.   It is notable that polish
 agriculture, among the most productive in the Soviet Bloc, has
 always been the least collectivized.   Added to this, the 1956
 uprising impelled the regime to permit a mass dissolution of
 collectives and additional incentives were given to farmers in
 the form of higher delivery prices or lower quotas of forced
 deliveries.  Production increases followed.  Extremely adverse
 weather and crop conditions have recently hurt polish agricul-
 tural production just as in the rest of Europe.  Official pro-
 nouncements express concern over production levels.  These
 pronouncements bring to mind the consistent reiteration by
 Gomulka and other regime officials that the polish peasantry
 '5X1C10b  must ultimately be led to agricultural collectivization.

 717 ",'iE, a.   An Italian C"-,  "Declaration of Independence"
 UACXG OUND:  The 28 October issue of the PCI daily organ
 L'Unita carried a 12,000-word statement adopted by a CC plenum
 ,e day before, entitled "'or a New Advance and  or the Unity
 of the International Communist Movement," which is the strong-
 est and most effective presentation to date of their "creative
 development in Marxist thinking" in accordance with the "new
 situation (which) has grown up to face the Communist movement."
 It presents persuasive arguments for revisionism, reformism
 and polycentrism.
 Ac'hnowledging that "the Communist movement as a whole
 has been slow to grasp the real meaning of the changes that
 have come about," the Italian Communist leaders again praise
 the 20th CPSU Congress, which "constituted a first giant
 step toward making up for lost time,  .  .  . hailed by Communist
 `arties throughout the world as the beginning of a grand
 reformation of the entire movement."  Throughout the text they
 condemn   a Chinese for their "dogmatic approach, closed and
 sectarian" views, and their "attach=, pushed to the point of
 exasperation and in fact to the limits of endurance, against
 the CPU and other Communist oar,.ies.'
 Along with their general rebuttal of the Chinese line,
 however, the Italians subtly take advantage of the situation
 to reinforce their demand for independence for their party, for
 other parties and for the international front organizations,
 from Soviet (as well as Chinese)  om na  on or interference.
 Translating their concept of independence into action, the
 Italians opposed an apparent Soviet plan to convene an early
 conference of world parties to force the issue with the
 Chinese (most observers believe that the C^'1 action was a
 major factor in stopping this Soviet move), emphasized their
 own conviction that bilateral relationships should be
 principal form of contact,  de ate and collaboration among
 parties." and   a  "considerable benefit can be derived" from
 such collaboration "among parties working in the same part of
 the wor c, where all  ace certain major issues and problems
 in the common struggle."  They declare:   "Insofar as we our-
 selves are concerned, we shall go on working to get such
 channels established, to serve the European Common Market Prea,
 and all of capitalistic :3urope.11
 On the specific issues in dispute in the Communist world
 today (war and peace, revolution and national liberation,
 transition to and building of socialism), the Italian state-
 ment sets forth views so "reformist," even "democratic," that
 they could be said to verge on the platforms of some of the

 calling for "the total liquidation of those illegal restrictions
 on and violations of the principles of democracy and socialist
 legality which for too long have tarnished the socialist ideal
 and hampered economic construction and democratic growth, both
 in the Soviet Union and in the other socialist countries."   eir
 arguments are on a far more intelligent and persuasive (from a
 free world view, at least) level than those of the Soviets or
 the Chinese.

 5X1C10b 710        N JThe 70th Birthday of Mao Tse-tung
 BACKGROUND:  Mao Tse-tung was born on December 26, 1993
 in the village of Shao Shan, Hunan Province.  His parents were
 poor peasants who, as Mao grew into boyhood, gradually improved
 the family status and became rather well-to-do.  Mao was given
 the usual formal education but early in life turned his interest
 to Marxism and to revolutionary activity.  Ie was one of the
 founders of the Chinese Communist Party and has devoted his
 entire life to it.   In 1931 he became Chairman of the Soviet
 Republic of China and in 1934 he led the famed "Long March"
 from 1:iangsi Province to Yenan (61,000 miles).  After V!orld ViarII
 he led the Communists in their civil war against the government,
 ending in the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's Euomintang.  Mao,
 long the central figure in the Chinese Communist Party, has
 dominated it and the government of the Chinese People's Republic
 since it came to power on October 1, 1949.
 Law prohibits celebration of leaders' birthdays.  Mao's
 upcoming birthday will probably be the occasion of at least
 some celebration  in spite of the fact that the CCP Central
 Committee in 1949 passed a resolution prohibiting celebrations
 of the birthdays of living Party leaders.  Regardless of how
 the Chinese Communists choose to mark the occasion, it provides
 an excellent opportunity for reviewing and evaluating Mao's
 contribution to the Chinese people as well as to Marxism-Leninism
 and the International Communist Movement.  Granted that Mao was
 a great revolutionary leader and a highly skilled general in
 guerrilla warfare, he is nevertheless vulnerable for the dismal
 failure of Chinese Communist domestic policies and their disas-
 trous results on the living standards of the Chinese people.
 Similarity to Stalin.  Mao, like Stalin as soon as he had
 consolidated his authority, initiated a period of terror the
 extent of which will never be fully known.  Like Stalin's purges,
 Mao's reached down into the remotest villages effecting the
 lives of nearly everyone on the Chinese Mainland.  Mao may have
 had his differences with Stalin but he imta?- him quite delib-
 erately in choosing terror as his weapon for ensuring the
 permanence of the Communist revolution.  Even the tactics chosen
 were similar:  The Communist cadres aroused the villages and
 set class against class, group against group until thousands of
 people had been wiped out.  The purges stopped as soon as Mao
 wanted them stopped -- and he wanted them stopped when in their
 wake they had created an all-pervasive environment of fear.   Mao
 himself has said that 000,000 people were "liquidated"; Po Yi-po
 later raised the figure to two million, and Kuomintang officials
 put the figure at nine million.  No one will ever know how many
 died; all that is known is that there was a bloodletting of

 monstrous proportions and that the innocent suffered along with
 the guilty as the Communists relentlessly stamped their imprint
 on the country and its people.
 Mao's domestic economic policies.  Each of Mao's new policy
 pronouncements seems to lead to a new cycle of failure and is
 abandoned just in time to avert total disaster.   In the Spring
 of la53 Mao decided on the wildly unrealistic goal of a 150-
 percent increase in agricultural production within 12 years.
 In the Autumn of 1057 he set out a new course of socialist con-
 struction in China which was to rely on unprecedented organiza-
 tion and exploitation of human resources -- the formation of
 ^eople's Communes as part of the Great Leap ~orward.  The attempt
 to:establish communes with their quasi-military discipline
 envisaged a state of control over the lives of the peasants that
 even Stalin did not consider possible.
 It has been said that Mao tries to rule the vast empire
 of China in the same way that he ruled a small valley in Yenan
 where meal and clothing tickets largely took the place of money
 -- i.e. by a single authoritarian dictatorship.   A single store
 in Y'enan catered to the needs of the whole population on the
 basis of tickets signed by Communist officials.   Such a primitive
 system magnified several thousand times and applied to the whole
 of China has only compounded the troubles and difficulties that
 the Chinese people have had to face.
 Regarding Mao's contribution to Marxism-Leninism and the
 International ~:ommunis  movement., for many years  a was applauded
 for having "adapted Marxism-Leninism to the conditions and situ-
 ation in China" with the implication that the original tenets
 of Marxism-Leninism were inadequate and required adjustment or
 revision before they were applicable to Chinese conditions.
 But now that Mao has charged Khrushchev and the other Soviet
 leaders with Revisionism, Mao is no longer the adaptor but rather
 the most ardent and strictly orthodox follower of the purest
 form of Marxism-Leninism.  Fie is, of course, not the first nor
 the last Communist leader to change his definitions and his
 position on Marxism-Leninism to suit the needs and demands of
 the moment.
 Chinese propagandists try to portray Mao as a great origi-
 nal thinker and as an accomplished ideological theoretician in
 the tradition of Marx and Lenin.  They have tried, with Mao's
 help to weave Mao's successes in the tactics of guerrilla warfare
 into doctrine on "the strategy of waging revolution from self-
 sustained rural bases."  They also base their claim of 1.lao's
 worth as a Marxist philosopher on his "On Practice" and "On
 Contradictions," alleged to have been written in 1937 but not
 published until 1950 and 1952 respectively.  Actually, "On
 Practice" is a paraphrased selection of portions of Lenin's
 Philosophical Notebooks and Materialism and 23mpirio-Criticism.
 n Con rac.ic ions  is a similar rehash o  what others have said
 about the unity of opposites.   Mao's real role as a philosopher
 has been not as an originator or even as a skillful adaptor, but
 rather as a vulgarizer and a plagiarist.

 The question of "peaceful coexistence" has played a crucial
 role in the Sino-Soviet rift, for which Mao bears a large part
 of the responsibility.  Years ago in Yenan, in an interview with
 Robert Payne, in response to Payne's question regarding what the
 Chinese Communists would do if they were confronted with modern
 tan';s, Mao answered that "they would tear them to pieces with
 their bare hands."  Mao today is still the victim of his own
 experience; he thinks in terms of guerrilla warfare and is unable
 to deal with questions related to the power of modern weapons
 and thermonuclear destruction.   At the time when other Communists
 are beginning to concede that not even Lenin, let alone Marx,
 could have foreseen the nature of thermonuclear war, Mao still
 adheres to outmoded concepts.
 Mao honors Stalin.   Ironically, in view of the fact that
 China was the arena of-some of Stalin's most monumental blunders,
 (failure to recognize the importance of the peasantry and will-
 ingness to use the CC's as a pawn in his own international
 strategy) Stalin is more honored as a prophet in China than in
 Russia.   ^talin's words, spoken in 1945 when the Soviet Union --
 li'-e China today -- still did not have atomic weapons, form the
 basis for Mao's current concepts of nuclear war.   Stalin said:
 "I do not believe the atom bomb to be so serious a force as
 certain politicians are inclined to regard it.   Atomic bombs
 are intended for intimidating weak nerves."
 Another irony is that Mao is Stalin's staunchest defender
 and imitator today, although Tiao disagreed with Stalin on many
 occasions and even instituted policies against the specific
 advice of Stalin, most notably the Chinese Communists' intensive
 and vigorous pursuit of the civil war against Chiang Kai-shek.
 The supreme irony is that Mao defends Stalin while -pursuing
 policies more closely akin to the ideas of Stalin's arch enemy,
 Leon Trotsky;  All of these conflicting and confusing aspects
 of Mao's loyalties, conceptions, and his policies are consistent
 with the interpretation that Ilao's primary motivation and inter-
 est is in retaining his own position of power and authority over
 700 million Chinese people and in furthering the age-old national
 25X1C10baspirations of the Chinese race.

 713 A ,I ,f. Co:i.Lunist Wducation of Foreign Students
 BAC'NGROUI  ;  The Soviet Union and her European satellites
 continue to expand educational opportunities for students from
 uneardeveloped countries despite public criticism of strict Com-
 mun,_st control over foreign students, despite the numbers of dis-
 satisfied students who have fled Communist schools and revealed
 the political nature of their training.   Riots against repressive
 treatment have ta>:en place in several of the satellites, most re-
 cently in Bulgaria during February 1333 when African students
 loudly voiced their protests against being forbidden to form
 their o*.wn foreign students' organization and against discrin.na-
 tory treatment.
 Bone of the criticisms and revelations has slowed the Com-
 munist education program which has roughly trebled in size since
 1333.  Accurate statistics are difficult to obtain.  Approximately
 EE,330 students from Africa alone are believed to be studying in
 the Communist bloc and a total of approximately 20,030 foreign
 students in all of the Communist countries.  Although this does
 :ot compare with the nearly 2001000 foreign students from under-
 developed countries now enrolled in the United States,  France,
 Great Britain and :lest Germany, it represents a tremendous in-
 vestment in foreign youth elites by communist countries which
 need funds for capital investment themselves.  Expansion of this
 increasingly expensive program is positive evidence of its im-
 portance to co=, unism.  Some clues to why it is important may be
 found in the treatment and use of the     dents during their
 years of schooling.
 privileged Students.  Not all foreign students studying
 in the bloc are ban  a in the same fashion.  Students recently
 returning to African countries have reported that there is a
 privileged group among than.  Some receive special allowances;
 some are able to travel abroad even though they have no pass-
 ports; some are accorded far better grades than their academic
 achievements warrant.  Fellow students believe this special
 treatment represents payment for services rendered such as parti-
 cipation in propaganda broadcasts or interviews for publication;
 attendance at, Communist front conferences as representatives of
 their home country; participation in "spontaneous d;e: ons::ra-
 trons" against Waste-_"n actions;  leadership of associations of
 fellow students, from the homeland; and even informing on fellc:i
 students.
 Students Foe turn.  The impact of lame numbers of students
 returning horse after several years of Communist education will
 not be felt for another few years, but a few returnees have
 spent several of their impressionable years with their Communist
 hosts.  Ito consistent pattern emerges as to their political at-
 titudies or the roles they will play in the community but some

 is derived from an objective necessity, from the very forces
 that the builciin C of soc9 a 11s i sat  in motion,  from a ripening
 of the entire Soviet society, not to mention the demands of
 competition with capitalism.   This drive of the Soviet peoples
 towards greater veil-being is born of new needs that have
 slowly ri2ened, of the awareness that the uasses have of these
 needs,  and of a desire for ?rogres  that cannot be frustrated.
 It is ridiculous and impossible to tell the Soviet people to
 v'ait.  We should instead as! the Soviet people to move forward
 with courage and with vigor, because their new achievements
 will provide a new drive and new enthusiasm for the whole so-
 cialist camp, which will ial:e it possible, step by step, to
 achieve the coupler and fair equilibrium among the varying re-
 quirements of development for each country, in the interests
 of the common strug,le and the common cause.
 Of primary importance, not only for economic progress,
 but for the continue? advance of the socialist countries and
 of the entire workers' and Communist movement throughout the
 vicrld, is the abolition and the total liquidation of those il-
 legal restrictions on and violations of the princis3les of de-
 mocracy and socialist legality, which for too long have tarnished
 the socialist ideal and hampered economic construction and ?a_
 1ocr atic 7rov,th  both in t hl Sovief Union and in t e other
 socialist countries.  These grave distortions have seriously
 impeded the spread of socialist influence throughout the world,
 and have been, as they are to this day, a potent weapon for our
 enemies.  The advance of our ideals in the countries still sub-
 ject to capitalist domination will be the surer anti wifter, the
 more closely progress in economic construction in the socialist
 countries is followed by the growth of a richly democratic life,
 evidenced in every facet of society.
 This is why it is so wrong and so harmful for the Chinese
 comrades to try to defend the methods associated with the cult
 of personality....

 The current debate among the Communist ?ar;;ies is inevitable and'
 necessary .... a,ny position which, starting from the difficulties,
 tie ..'ivergent views, and the differentiations existing today,
 reasoned to the abandonment of the job and the struggle for
 lc'eoioCica1 and political unity in the Communist movement on
 the international scale, would perforce be a mista%en one.
 Therefore, the schismatic anc: sectarian activities pursued by
 the Chinese comrades today are to be rejected, as a genuien
 threat  to this unity.
 There is no contradiction between the need for unity in
 our movement ani the need for autonomy  and independence  or
 every party.  What does it really mean, in fact, this  autonomy

 PYpf     he principle of non-interference by any party in the in-
 ''L~.;            of f cair s of Other parties,   even in the  necessary debate
 and comparison of opinions.    It mean: that every party      is re-
 sponsible only to its own people for its own policy, and for
 the contribution it rzahes to the general orientation and to
 the progress of the mover.ent as a whole, and that no ?arty
 need feel itself responsible for every position of every indi-
 vidual act of other parties, in whose decisions it has no part,
 and wh . ~h nay, in addition, be in conflict with the general
 principles that motivate our movement....
 It is on the basis of this concept of unity in diversity
 and in autonony that we believe the problems of the patterns
 of contact and -  collaboration among Corziunist ?arties, and the
 issues involving the method and tone of debate within: our move-
 nent ought to be approached.
 Our ?arty believes that the principal form of contact,
 debate and collaboration among parties should consist  of  closer
 bilateral relft-:Anships.... Our party has done some intensive
 wool, c~  recent years on the  level of exchange of delegations
 an     bilateral relations ....':'e  shall peep trying,  i x this way as

 in Latin     Arica ano  ::n     racy  ,  whose problems and  needs we
 thins  require special study, and which may possibly profit by
 a ~bnowledge of our experiences.
 We also believe that considerable benefit can be derived
 (witness the early experiments made in western Europe, With the
 Conference of the 1? ')artles in 131: ) from contacts, meetings,
 and collaboration among  arties working in the sage part ca   he
 world, where all of then face certain major issues and problems
 In the common struggle.  In this field, it T11-11 probably be
 found necessary to establish some formal channels for regular
 consultations and coordination.   Insofar as we ourselves are
 concerned, we shall go on working to get such channels estab-
 lished            to serve the :~uropean Common L arke  area, and a o
 capitalist Europe.
 F'Te are fully aware of the special value, at certain tines,
 of international conferences attended by the entire Communist
 movement.  They enrich and deepen our joint appreciation of the
 international situation, clarify the major lines of our global
 strategy, and even help us in our approach to specific problems.
 The essential condition for their convocation, however, is an
 examination of the real chances they afford for furthering an
 analysis of the situation and, working out a common orientation,
 for reaching clear-cut conclusions, and, for achieving progress
 towards unity in the movement.   Important requirements for such
 conferences, if they are to be useful and effective, are good
 timing, adequate preparation, and a clear and realistic idea of
 the topics to be discussed and of the  jectives that can and
 should ae achieved.
