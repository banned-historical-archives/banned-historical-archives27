 NORTH KOREAN MEDIA TREATMENT OF MOSCOW
 Clues to Future Ties?
 Summary
 P'yongyang's radio and press radically changed the quality and
 quantity of their reporting on North Korean-Soviet ties in the 1980s,
 reflecting an increasingly positive view of ceremonies, events, and issues
 that has paralleled--and in some cases preceded--tangible progress in the
 relationship. The change was particularly apparent in 1986, when North
 Korea and the Soviet Union dramatized common anti-US themes in their
 rhetoric. Problems remain in the relationship, but we believe the two
 sides are closer now than at any time since 1948. Judging from the
 pattern in media coverage,                                we expect the
 warmer atmosphere in North Korean-Soviet relations to continue in 1987.

 Media Analysis as a Gauge: The Rationale for a Close Look
 The warming trend in Soviet-North Korean relations that began in 1983 was
 clearly signaled by President Kim II-son 's visit to Moscow in May 1984. Since then,
 evidence of the improved relationship,                                     has included:
 ? Soviet aid in building a nuclear power plant in North Korea.
 ? A recent unprecedented joint naval exercise.
 But P'yongyang also has altered its public behavior, offering Moscow greater
 support in the media, as well as changing its treatment of Soviet-North Korean relations:
 ? Pyongyang has significantly upgraded its rhetoric marking major Soviet-North
 Korean anniversaries and celebrations.
 ? The North has also expanded media support for Soviet foreign policy and security
 proposals.
 Sometimes, however, North Korean and Soviet media accounts of the same event
 have been very different--and occasionally one country has failed to report an event
 that received play in the other's press. Explanations include North Korea or Soviet
 disapproval of an issue or exaggeration of an event's importance for use in domestic or
 international propaganda. For example, items such as Soviet banquet toasts and
 birthday greetings to Kim Chong-il, Kim II-song's son and apparent successor, play
 prominently in the North Korean media but not infrequently are omitted from the Soviet
 press.
 Our review of P'yongyang's media treatment of the Soviets since the 1960s
 confirms patterns that in some cases presage tangible steps. P'yongyang's public
 commentary consistently mirrored the declining state of bilateral relations in the 1970s.
 Compared with that period, in the past three years the North Korean press has
 significantly increased both the number of its items about Moscow and the effusion of
 its rhetoric.
 The Historical Perspective
 In the 1970s, the media reflected P'yongyang's correct but cool ties to Moscow
 as the Soviets significantly reduced their public backing as well as shipments of military
 equipment. P'yongyang rarely noted Soviet foreign policy initiatives, and it virtually
 ignored milestones in US-Soviet relations--including President Nixon's trip to Moscow

 in 1972, SALT I that same year, and the strategic arms limitation talks during the
 Ford-Brezhnev summit in Vladivostok in 1974. The only notable exception came in June
 1979, when P'yongyang radio briefly reported, without comment, the conclusion of the
 SALT II agreement at the Vienna summit. P'yongyang's coverage of events that were
 bad news for Moscow reflected the same treatment. For example, NATO's decision in
 December 1979 to allow the deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF)--a
 major policy defeat for the Soviet Union--received no attention in North Korean media.
 P'yongyang similarly tempered its public treatment of ceremonial milestones.
 Observances of the Soviet-North Korean Friendship Treaty of 1961 are a case in point.
 Ceremonies marking the 10th, 15th, and 20th anniversaries indicated a steady downward
 slide in the relationship:
 ? In 1971, P'yongyang's celebration was far less lavish than its observance that
 year of a similar treaty with China, and it did not reciprocate the visit of a
 high-level Soviet delegation to mark the occasion.
 ? P'yongyang failed even to hold rallies in 1976 and downplayed traditional
 messages of Kim II-song and Premier Pak Song-chol to their Soviet counterparts.
 In the same vein, the Soviet Union's congratulatory message to the North Korean
 leadership omitted the salutation "Dear Comrades," the first time the Soviets had
 dropped the greeting to P'yongyang on a major anniversary.
 ? By 1981, General Secretary Brezhnev--not even mentioning Kim II-song by
 name--had downgraded his "warm congratulations" of 1976 to merely
 "congratulations." Unlike Chinese Communist Party Chairman Hu Yaobang, he
 voiced no support for Korean reunification or Kim II-song's confederation
 proposal. At the same time, Beijing upgraded its message to Kim I1-song who, in
 turn, emphasized that North Korea's relations with China were "bloodsealed" and
 "militant."
 The Warming Trend
 Viewed against the backdrop of the 1970s, Kim II-song's visit to Moscow in May
 1984--his first in 23 years--signified a dramatic realignment in P'yongyang's relations.
 The message from that visit, since underscored in the media, has been the North's
 closer identification with Soviet interests, and cooler ties to Beijing. Still, media
 reporting suggests the relationship has grown at a measured  ace, which is perhaps not
 surprising given the arms-length nature of past ties.
 To determine whether tell-tale media clues foreshadowed the possibility of
 progress during Kim's visit in 1984, we discovered that, in the months preceding Kim's
 trip, the press contained hints of a new direction in policy. Our retrospective analysis of

 radio and newspaper reporting indicates P'yongyang had begun to upgrade its treatment
 of Soviet affairs--a move reciprocated by Moscow--in 1983. Even so, examples of the
 new state of affairs were relatively few and far between:
 ? In September 1983, P'yongyang, for the first time in several years, took a clearly
 positive stand on a Soviet position by supporting Moscow's version of the Korean
 Airlines 007 shootdown. P'yongyang's action occurred just after Moscow
 withdrew from the Interparliamentary Union meeting in Seoul. Although we have
 no evidence of a causal link between the IPU withdrawal and P'yongyang's stance
 on the KAL shootdown, we surmise the North welcomed Moscow's boycott.
 ?      Four months later, North Korean media reported that, for the first time, the Soviet
 Union sent official New Year's greetings to Kim II-song as well as Kim Chong-il,
 suggesting Moscow had softened--although not abandoned--its disapproval of
 the elder Kim's plans for dynastic succession.
 ? In the same month, the Soviet press promptly reported North Korea's proposal for
 tripartite talks with the United States and South Korea. They did so without
 comment, however, suggesting displeasure over Moscow's exclusion from the
 talks.
 ? The clearest indication that Kim II-song would visit Moscow occurred about a
 month before the trip. On 10 April 1984, KCNA published the text of a TASS
 interview with Kim.

 a banquet speech on 23 May. Moreover, North Korean media reported that Chernenko
 "warmly hailed" Korean economic achievements and indicated Soviet support for a US
 meeting in generally favorable terms, they did not specifically endorse Soviet foreign
 policy positions. But both sides hinted at fundamental agreement on broad goals--for
 instance, repeating their opposition to "imperialist aggression," a phrase used by Kim in
 that the treaty had served to consolidate friendship.
 Given the more detailed Soviet media accounts of the talks, North Korea's
 treatment suggests that P'yongyang's self-styled "independence" may have inhibited an
 admission of the extent of Soviet interests in Northeast Asia. For example, only TASS
 reported that Kim and Chernenko emphasized the importance of the 1961 treaty for the
 development of bilateral relations and the "preservation of peace in the Far East." Six
 years earlier--the last time both sides referred to the treaty--Moscow had noted merely

 Kim's visit was followed by a distinctly more positive tone in North Korean-Soviet
 protocol coverage. One of the first upbeat signs occurred in July 1984, when the two
 sides marked their treaty anniversary:
 ? In P'yongyang, the North Korean delegation to the Soviet Embassy's reception
 was prominently reported to include three full Politburo members. Since 1971
 the anniversary had not drawn more than one North Korean official at the
 Politburo level, and in many years the turnout was led by an alternate member.
 ? P'yongyang's media coverage of the anniversary--including reports of ceremonies
 in Moscow for the first time in a decade--was also the most extensive in years.
 P'yongyang's characterization of relations with Moscow warmed noticeably,
 echoing language used during Kim's visit. Nodong Sinmun, the official Korean
 Workers' Party newspaper, called the two countries "friendly neighbors linked by a
 river" and "class brothers and intimate comrades-in-arms." Similar, but much
 less effusive, language had last appeared in 1979.
 ? Moscow also upgraded its treatment of the anniversary--Soviet officials
 attending a reception at the North Korean Embassy were of a higher level than
 those attending the year before.
 Security Cooperation
 In retrospect, clues in the media that the two countries were cooperating more
 closely preceded concrete evidence of the warmer relationship. After Kim's 1984 trip to
 Moscow, North Korean-Soviet security cooperation surfaced as a recurrent theme in
 P'yongyang media:
 ? For example, in August 1984, during the 39th anniversary celebration of Korea's
 liberation from Japanese rule, North Korea paid special attention to the Soviet
 role in defeating Japan. Kim II-song's anniversary message to Moscow, carried
 by KCNA, was the warmest in over 20 years, referring to the Soviet Union as
 North Korea's "liberator."
 ? A Nodong Sinmun editorial echoed the "liberator" theme and went on to praise
 current Soviet domestic and foreign policies. By contrast, editorials on the
 anniversary for more than a decade had contained no more than a brief reference
 to the Soviet Union's past assistance.
 In 1986, both P'yongyang and Moscow spoke out repeatedly on the UN peace
 theme. North Korea has vocally backed Soviet policy stances that complement its own
 attempt to project a moderate, peaceful image.

 In November 1985, P'yongyang abandoned its traditional silence on US-Soviet
 summits, praising Gorbachev's performance in Geneva and endorsing his proposal for a
 collective Asian discussion of regional security issues. During the 1970s, P'yongyang
 had consistently turned aside Moscow's periodic efforts to elicit approval of a collective
 security arrangement. The endorsement--made in a speech by Foreign Minister Kim
 Yong-nam marking the October Revolution as well as a Nodong Sinmun
 editorial--apparently impressed Moscow. The Soviets reciprocated in February 1986 via
 a TASS statement that supported P'yongyang's condemnation of Team Spirit and the
 North's unilateral suspension of military exercises. The Soviet pronouncement was the
 clearest statement in nearly 20 years supporting P'yongyang on a peninsular issue.
 In 1986, North Korean calls for a nuclear-free zone on the peninsula were echoed
 in Moscow, forging a new common stand:
 ? The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued its most authoritative statement of support for
 North Korea in 26 years, seconding P'yongyang's antinuclear theme. Gorbachev
 also included the refrain in his Navy Day speech in Vladivostock in July.
 ? Less than three weeks later, North Korea's Foreign Ministry followed up,
 expressing "full support" for Gorbachev's announcement of an extended nuclear
 test moratorium. The declaration marked P'yongyang's first formal statement
 supporting a Soviet position in 25 years.
 Both sides have used the peace theme to demonstrate their broader accord:
 ? As part of its campaign to add tension-reduction proposals to the proposed
 agenda for North-South talks, the North announced in September 1986 that
 150,000 troops were to be assigned to civilian construction projects.
 P'yongyang's "initiative" was picked up by Pravda and aired on Moscow television.
 Such use of military personnel is not new, and, in this case, probably rooted in
 economic necessity--North Korea is grappling with shortages of raw materials,
 energy, and labor. But the attention given the alleged action also is consistent
 with P'yongyang's year-long propaganda campaign to portray itself as a
 peace-loving nation.
 ? Similarly, in September, P'yongyang's role as host of an international antinuclear
 conference was well publicized both in North Korea and the Soviet Union. Pravda
 and TASS highlighted those sections of the conference declaration praising
 Soviet nuclear disarmament proposals and Gorbachev's extended nuclear testing
 moratorium, and condemning the Strategic Defense Initiative.
 ? Common themes figured prominently in press coverage of Kim II-song's October
 1986 visit to Moscow. Both Kim and Gorbachev condemned US imperialism,
 reiterated Gorbachev's Vladivostok proposals for Asian security, and praised the
 Soviet position at the Reagan-Gorbachev talks at Reykjavik. P'yongyang's media
 accounts of the summit were more extensive and effusive than the reports of

 Kim's 1984 visit. Upon Kim's return, KCNA publicized a Korean Workers' Party
 communique proclaiming the two leaders reached "full consensus on all the
 questions discussed."
 ? Both North Korean and Soviet media harshly criticized the US announcement in
 November of plans to deploy Lance missiles in the South, asserting that
 Washington had escalated the arms race while praising Moscow and P'yongyang
 for their peaceful initiatives.
 ? During the same month, North Korea acknowledged Soviet interest in an
 intra-Korea issue--the Kumgangsan Dam--by replaying Soviet media coverage
 that mirrored P'yongyang's line.
 Media Omissions: Tacit Signs of Disagreement
 The increasingly positive media treatment of bilateral issues and events. suggests
 that North Korean-Soviet ties are stronger than would be indicated solely by other, more
 tangible measures of the relationship. Nonetheless, we do not underestimate the
 differences. Like information on improvements in Soviet-North Korean connections, the
 indicators of friction are sparse. Frequently our best clues of policy disagreements are
 gleaned not from what press statements say, but from what they omit:
 ? The Soviets have given only lipservice to P'yongyang's demand to cohost the
 1988 Olympics with Seoul and have failed to support the North's threat of a
 boycott.
 ? In contrast to Moscow, P'yongyang recognizes Prince Sihanouk's Cambodian
 coalition. The Soviet press does not publicize events related to Kim II-song's
 personal friendship with Sihanouk.
 ? Perhaps most important, Soviet coverage of its North Korean relations reveal
 Moscow's reluctance to approve Kim Chong-il as Kim II-song's heir.
 Moreover, on several of these and other issues, the Chinese are more supportive
 than the Soviets:
 ? The Chinese press has publicized periodic North Korean calls for Vietnamese
 withdrawal from Cambodia.
 ? China implicitly blessed the elder Kim's succession plan by giving Kim Chong-il
 the red-carpet treatment during his visit to Beijing in 1983. He has not yet
 visited Moscow.
 Notwithstanding the North's shift toward the Soviets, we believe P'yongyang is
 reluctant to abandon its image of fierce independence and self-proclaimed status as a

 Nonaligned nation. In fact, public behavior
 the North's sensitivity on this score:
 highlights
 ? During the 25th anniversaries of the Soviet and Chinese treaties in July 1986,
 North Korea tried to balance its position between the two sides, dispatching full
 Politburo members to both Moscow and Beijing.
 ? North Korean media frequently extol the virtues of Kim II-song's philosophy of
 chuche or self-reliance.
 Implications
 We believe analysis of the media remains a useful complement to other
 intelligence in gauging the direction of North Korean-Soviet relations. There are several
 areas that bear watching to discern how bilateral ties may change:
 ? Economic cooperation. The Soviets have been tightfisted on economic issues,
 demanding balanced trade and repayment on debt obligations, and we do not
 expect Moscow to change its tack significantly in the near term. But a rise in
 media attention to bilateral economic issues--articles on joint exploitation of
 North Korean resources, for example--in consonance with new trade agreements
 and exchanges of economic delegations, could be a tipoff of improved
 cooperation in this area. To date, media accounts of economic meetings have
 been vague, and terms of agreements have not been publicized.
 ? Defense cooperation. Public references to defense agreements historically have
 been sparse on details, but nonetheless indicators of broader accord. In
 December 1986, for example, KCNA described the aim of Soviet General Lizichev's
 visit to P'yongyang as the expansion of military cooperation "in accordance" with
 the Kim-Gorbachev summit. We would read such statements as well as reports
 of visits of military delegations, or articles on each other's defense posture, as
 barometers of the defense relationship. They could offer tipoffs of possible new
 Soviet aid or joint military exercises.
 ? New common policy themes. North Korea's media have hinted that P'yongyang is
 inching toward an acknowledgement of its role in the Socialist community. For
 example, occasionally P'yongyang will use codewords that traditionally imply
 membership in the Soviet Bloc, such as "proletarian internationalism." More
 frequent use of such terms would suggest further movement in this area. In
 January 1987, the North Korean Vice Foreign Minister joined his counterparts from
 the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Mongolia at a meeting
 in Moscow for the first time. North Korean attendance at the first Asian
 Communist party convention in Mongolia this summer would provide evidence of
 a convergence of policy interests.

 ? Cooperation Abroad. Evidence is sparse on collusion between Moscow and
 P'yongyang in the Third World and elsewhere. Although we do not expect to see
 radical changes soon, we cannot rule out cooperation as a result of closer North
 Korean-Soviet ties. Media features on topics such as joint military or economic
 aid to third countries, or increased rhetorical support for diplomatic overtures,
 could mark such a new direction in policy.

 Appendix: Chronology of Selected Events
 The following chronology presents the key events in North Korea's relations with
 the Soviet Union and China, including a short description of P'yongyang's media
 treatment. We also list in boldface selected developments involving the major powers
 in Asia to provide a backdrop to relations between North Korea and its major allies.
 9 September 1948            North Korean Communists establish the
 Democratic People's Republic of Korea in
 P'yongyang.
 July 1961                    North Korea signs friendship treaties with China
 and the Soviet Union.
 February 1965               The United States begins bombing North
 Vietnam. Improved North Korean-Soviet
 relations during 1965-68 may stem from hopes
 Soviet support would help counter US power
 in Asia.
 1966
 January 1968
 January 1968
 The Chinese Cultural Revolution strains
 China's ties to North Korea. Posters in Beijing
 call Kim II-song a "fat revisionist" and a
 "disciple of Khrushchev."
 China refuses an invitation to the Soviet
 Communist Party Congress, starting a long
 period of noncommunication.
 North Korean commandos attack the South
 Korean presidential mansion in an abortive
 effort to assassinate Park Chung Hee.
 North Korea seizes the USS Pueblo, an
 intelligence-gathering ship operating near the
 coast. Moscow gave minimal media coverage
 to the incident, omitting any mention of its
 role in settling the crisis, illustrating a cool
 state of North Korean-Soviet relations.
 November 1968               North Korean commandos infiltrate the east
 coast of South Korea and terrorize a village.
 The series of violent acts in 1968 reinforces
 North Korea's image of dangerous
 unpredictability.

 April 1969
 April 1970
 China and the Soviet Union clash along their
 border, leading to a further deterioration in
 relations.
 North Korean fighters shoot down a US EC-121
 reconnaissance plane. As with the Pueblo
 incident, Soviet media reports did not mention
 Moscow's intervention--Soviet ships helped
 the United States search for the downed
 aircraft.
 Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visits P'yongyang
 to mend relations damaged by the Cultural
 Revolution.
 President Nixon visits Moscow and Beijing.
 North Korean apprehension over the China trip
 is probably a factor in a temporary increase in
 P'yongyang's contacts with Moscow:
 ? The two exchange high-level delegations.
 ? The Soviets provide additional economic and
 military assistance.
 1972                       The US-China Shanghai communique
 criticizes (Soviet) "hegemony."
 August 1974
 South Korean President Park narrowly escapes
 assassination by a North Korean agent; Mrs.
 Park is killed.
 April 1975                 The United States withdraws from Vietnam.
 August 1976
 North Korean soldiers attack a UN Command
 tree-cutting team at Panmunjom, killing two
 US officers.
 October 1978               China and Japan normalize relations.
 November 1978              The Soviet Union and Vietnam sign a treaty
 that gives Moscow access to military facilities
 in Vietnam.
 North Korean-Soviet friction over Cambodia
 begins as P'yongyang denounces Vietnam's
 invasion of Cambodia.

 December 1978              North Korean media report the normalization
 of US-China relations but do not comment on
 its implications for the Korean peninsula.
 P'yongyang probably fears its interests could
 be sold out in US-China discussions about
 Korea.
 February 1979              China launches a limited border war with
 Vietnam.
 December 1979              Soviet forces invade Afghanistan. North
 Korea criticizes the move.
 September 1981             The IOC selects Seoul to host the 1988
 Summer Olympics.
 September 1982             Following a series of high-level exchanges, Kim
 I1-song receives a red-carpet welcome during
 his 11-day visit to China.
 October 1982
 January 1983
 May 1983
 Soviet press and cultural officials visit South
 Korea for the first time to attend an
 international conference.
 Kim II-song tells Japanese reporters it is
 inconceivable Beijing or Moscow could
 recognize the "illegitimate" authorities in Seoul.
 South Korean and Chinese officials conclude
 direct negotiations--their first official
 contact--to resolve the hijacking of a Chinese
 airliner.
 Kim Chong-il visits China. The trip marks
 Chinese recognition of Kim 11-song's
 succession plans.
 1 September 1983           Soviets shoot down a South Korean
 passenger plane over Sakhalin Island. The
 halt in Soviet contacts with South
 Korea--including Moscow's withdrawal from
 the Interparliamentary Union meeting in
 Seoul--is accompanied by an improvement in
 Soviet-North Korean relations. For example,
 P'yongyang media cover Soviet INF initiatives
 and Andropov's "peace" initiatives.

 Xiaoping meets with US Secretary of
 Defense Weinberger in Beijing. Their talks

 Korean assassination attempt in Rangoon; 17
 South Korean officials are killed.
 October 1983                Two South Korean officials attend an
 international conference in Shanghai.
 November 1983
 November 1983
 January 1984
 February 1984
 April 1984
 Chinese media report a fairly balanced view of
 the Rangoon bombing, reporting both Burma's
 announcement blaming P'yongyang, and the
 North's official denial of the charges. Moscow
 reports only P'yongyang's denial.
 Moscow deploys 10 TU-16 Badgers and two
 TU-95 Bears at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, the
 first Soviet deployment of bombers outside the
 Warsaw Pact area since the 1962 Cuban
 missile crisis.
 Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang makes an
 official visit to Washington.
 Moscow begins deployment of two of its
 three aircraft carriers to the Western Pacific.
 In March a Soviet aircraft carrier task force
 supports its first joint amphibious exercise
 with Vietnam.

 interview, the clearest precursor of Kim's trip a
 month later.
 April 1984                 President Reagan travels to China.

 June. 1984
 August 1984
 P'yongyang announces its boycott of the Los
 Angeles Olympics on the final day for
 applications, citing concern over its athletes'
 safety. North Korea does not refer directly to
 the Soviet boycott.

 North Korean Premier Kang Song-san visits
 China. Soon after his return North Korea
 promulgates its joint venture law--patterned
 August 1984
 P'yongyang reports a meeting between the
 Soviet Ambassador in North Korea and Kim
 Chong-il--who rarely meets foreigners. The
 meeting may be an oblique acknowledgement
 of Kim's status as designated successor .to Kim
 11-song.
 November 1984               Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa,
 accompanied by military representatives, visits
 North Korea to conclude a border treaty: Both
 North Korean and Soviet media report his
 meetings with Kim II-song on the 20th and
 with Kim Chong-il on the 23d.

 April 1985
 May 1985
 July 1985
 August 1985
 North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam
 visits Moscow. P'yongyang publicizes a joint
 communique attesting to "consensus on all
 problems discussed at the talks," a break with
 its longstanding practice of not issuing joint
 communiques. The communique may be
 evidence of an effort to strengthen ties with
 the Soviets.
 South Korean diplomats visit China for the
 first time to attend an international
 conference.
 Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu
 Yaobang visits North Korea. Neither side
 claims, as was customary in the past, that
 their standard "unanimity of views" extends to
 foreign affairs.
 Kim II-song indirectly criticizes Chinese policy
 by saying that, despite its attempts to bolster
 its economy through increased contacts with
 the outside world, North Korea would "never"
 introduce foreign capital and thus risk
 becoming a "subjugated" economy.
 General Secretary Gorbachev revives the
 "zone of peace" and "Asian security"
 concept, first initiated by Brezhnev in 1969,
 during Prime Minister Gandhi's visit. Both

 Japanese rule reveals a new focus on
 Soviet-North Korean security ties. China does
 not send a delegation.

 Nonproliferation Treaty in return for Soviet
 agreement to help construct a nuclear power
 plant.

 January 1986
 Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visits
 North Korea. P'yongyang endorses the Soviet
 proposal for Asian collective security and gives
 stronger support for the Soviet-backed
 government in Afghanistan--thus broadening
 the gap with China.
 January 1986
 June 1986
 North-South talks are halted as P'yongyang
 protests the announcement of the US-South
 Korean joint exercise Team Spirit 1986.

 officers visits Moscow. The visit is
 reciprocated by General Lizechev in December.
 June-July 1986             North Korea calls for military tripartite
 talks--including the two Koreas and the United
 States--to reduce tension on the Korean
 peninsula.
 July 1986
 September 1986

 visit by North Korean warships to a foreign
 port.
 China sends a team to the Seoul Asian
 Games on the first direct flight from China to
 South Korea.

 Korea. Chinese media portrayals of the trip
 are warmer than P'yongyang media accounts.
 The first joint North Korea-Soviet naval
 exercise marks a growing defense relationship.
 President Reagan and General Secretary
 Gorbachev meet at Reykjavik. P'yongyang
 supports the Soviet position at the talks.
 Visiting US Defense Secretary Weinberger
 receives a warm welcome from China. The
 reception underscores Beijing's willingness to
 widen its defense relationship with
 Washington.

 Kim 11-song visits Moscow. North Korean
 media exude lavish praise for the results of the
 talks.
 November 1986               The United States announces its deployment
 of Lance missiles in South Korea. The
 decision is criticized by P'yongyang and
 Moscow as another act of US aggression
 leading to nuclear war.
 December 1986               KCNA reports that Soviet General Lizichev
 heads a delegation to P'yongyang for talks on
 expanding North Korean-Soviet military
 cooperation.

 meeting of deputy Foreign Ministers in
 Moscow--including officials from Vietnam,
 Cambodia, Laos and Mongolia. Soviet media
 shows an interest in both intra-Korean and
 Asian regional issues by calling for an
 improvement in Chinese-Soviet ties, and
 backing the North's new talks proposal.
