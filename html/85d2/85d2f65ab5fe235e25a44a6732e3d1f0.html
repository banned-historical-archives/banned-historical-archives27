 the Viet Cong continued to
 with allied operations last
 avoid
 week,
 significant
 they con-
 ducted a damaging mortar attack against a principal
 US Army helicopter base and sharply increased attacks
 against both regular and paramilitary South Vietnamese
 forces.  North of Saigon, US forces have fielded the
 largest allied task force of the war against a strong
 Viet Cong base area.   Premier Ky has publicly softened
 his attitude toward a negotiated settlement
 several delta province chiefs and possibly Defense
 Minister Co, one of the few southern generals still in
 high military positions.
 THE CRISIS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 Significant breakdowns in transportation services and
 public security have taken place in some areas.   There
 are indications that the shaky leadership coalition
 is falling apart, and that the loyalty of some im-
 portant military figures is in question.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS ORDERED HOME
 The most likely explanation of the recall of an un-
 precedented number of overseas personnel is that they
 are being pulled back for screening and reindoctrina-
 tion as part of the "cultural revolution."
 SUKARNO STATEMENT FAILS TO SATISFY OPPONENTS
 The Indonesian President's 10 January statement con-
 cerning his role in the antiarmy action of October
 1965 will not satisfy the Suharto regime and will in
 tensify demands for his ouster.   However, General Su-
 harto will probably continue with deliberation and
 rely on constitutional means despite expected in-
 creased pressures from anti-Sukarno activists.

 CHILEAN OPPOSITION PARTY IMPROVES POSITION
 The Socialist Party, which takes a more extreme line
 than its Communist   coalition partners, has put its
 leader, Salvador Allende,  into the Senate presidency,
 thereby erhancing the party's political standing and
 enabling it to harass the Frei administration and to

 In two years in office President Eduardo Frei--despite
 opposition from both left and right--has put through

 ments for government participation in Chile's all-im-
 portant ccpper industry,  and make some progress in eco-
 nomic stabilization.   He early attempted to stake out
 an "independent" position in international affairs
 which brought differences with the US on some issues,
 although Chilean-US cooperation has since increased.
 During his visit to Washington next month Frei will
 probably concentrate on a general improvement in US-

 FAR EAST
 Events in the fast-moving drama in China last week were
 highlighted by the first significant and widespread breakdown
 in public order and by mounting indications of divided loyal-
 ties in the army.  Official Chinese Communist media disclosed
 that strikes and violence occurred in at least ten major cities.
 These clashes between  Maoist Red Guards and workers apparently
 were precipitated by the Mao-Lin faction's recent decision to
 launch a drive for final victory in an effort to destroy op-
 ponents in the party apparatus who control the urban proletariat.
 The gravity and scope of this resistance to Mao and Lin Piao
 was also reflected in posters asserting that the nation's police
 and security troops under the Ministry of Public Security have
 opposed the "cultural revolution" and that they have been trans-
 ferred to army control.   The unity and reliability of the army
 itself, however, has been called into question by attacks on sev-
 eral major military figures, including a vice minister of national
 defense.  According to Red Guard posters, public security forces
 supported by the army were used against pro-Mao Red Guards in Nan-
 king.   The situation created by this growing resistance to the Mao-
 Lin faction could well develop into something even more violent.
 Although Hanoi has maintained a prudent silence on develop-
 ments in China,                          the North Vietnamese leaders almost certainly are
 gravely concerned about the possible implications of disarray in
 China for their ability to prosecute the war.  Hanoi's sensitivity
 to any suggestion of a decline in its will to persist in the war
 reflected in a terse statement denying,  in effect,  that Premier
 Pharn Van Dong's statements to Harrison Salisbury implied a soften-
 ing in North Vietnam's terms for a settlement.
 Communist forces in South Vietnam continued to avoid contact
 with major allied operations, but there has been a sharp increase
 in attacks on South Vietnamese troops and outposts.
 In Laos the 1 January National Assembly elections produced
 the expected heavy majority of deputies pledged to support Prime
 Minister Souvanna,  and Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese forces
 have launched their annual campaign to clear government guerrillas
 from northern Laos.   In Indonesia, an evasive statement by Sukarno
 on his role in the abortive coup in October 1965 will probably in-

 VIETNAM
 Communist forces this week
 sharply accelerated the scale
 and intensity of military activ-
 ity against vulnerable South Viet-
 namese paramilitary targets.                  At
 the same time, however, enemy
 main force units continued to
 avoid major contact with large-
 scale allied search-and-destroy
 operations.
 One battalion-sized and at
 least seven company-sized attacks
 were launched by Viet Cong/North
 Vietnamese Army  (NVA) units
 against South Vietnamese Regional
 and Popular Forces outposts and
 patrols in widespread sections
 of the country.   Cumulative losses
 to government irregulars in these
 actions included 102 killed,  77
 wounded, and 56 missing.
 In addition company-strength
 enemy strike forces mounted four
 heavy assaults against battalion-
 sized or smaller troop   forma-
 tions of the South Vietnamese
 Army   (ARVN)  in Kien Hoa and Quang
 Nam provinces, resulting in more
 than 100 friendly casualties.
 Enemy-initiated operations
 against US forces were highlighted
 by a damaging attack on 7 Janu-
 ary against one of the US Army's
 principal helicopter bases in the
 central highlands, Camp Holloway,
 near Pleiku.   Under cover of a
 45-minute mortar bombardment,
 elements tentatively identified
 as subordinate to the Viet Cong
 407th Sapper Battalion penetrated
 the camp's defensive perimeter,
 placing satchel charges against
 numerous parked  aircraft  and sup-
 ply installations.  Postaction
 reports placed friendly losses at
 12 killed  (6 US),  63 wounded  (61
 US),  and 34 aircraft damaged.
 The Communists continued to
 harass Camp Holloway with mortar
 and small-arms fire for three
 more days  (8-10 January), but
 failed to inflict significant
 casualties or damage.
 The most important allied
 military activity in South Viet-
 nam during the week was the in-
 itiation on 7 January of a major
 ground offensive, Operation
 CEDAR FALLS,  20 to 30 miles north
 of Saigon in Binh Duong Province.
 The largest allied task force
 ever fielded in the Vietnam war
 has been committed to this
 sector--twenty US and three ARVN
 battalions together with heavy
 artillery support.
 The operation is targeted
 against the Viet Cong base area
 known as the Iron Triangle, a
 60-square-mile region of aban-
 doned rubber plantations, vil-
 lages, and jungle which has been
 under firm Communist control for
 years.   The over-all allied ob-
 jective is to neutralize Commu-
 nist presence and influence in
 the Iron Triangle area by relo-
 cating an estimated 10,000
 civilian inhabitants to areas
 under GVN control, disrupting
 the local Viet Cong organiza-
 tion, and denying the enemy

 Premier Ky and his close sup-

 Ky twice last week made im-
 promptu public remarks on the
 possibility of negotiating a
 peaceful settlement with North
 Vietnam.   This marks an apparent
 easing of the South Vietnamese
 military regime's previously
 rigid stand against talks and
 its increased confidence in the
 strength of its position vis-a-
 vis the Communists.
 Ky is planning a good will
 visit to Australia and New Zeal-
 and next week, although there has
 been a volley of criticism within
 both countries over the visit.
 The Ky government is also
 apparently receptive to a resump-
 tion of diplomatic ties with In-
 donesia
 On the domestic front, Ky
 has reportedly sanctioned the
 replacement of several province
 chiefs in IV Corps in addition
 to the two who have already been
 dismissed.   Such wholesale
 changes would almost certainly
 represent a coordinated effort
 by Ky and Chief of State Thieu
 to strengthen the government's
 hand in the delta.   The moves
 come at a time when Ky is said,
 once again, to be considering
 the removal of Defense Minister
 Co, one of few southern generals
 left in high military positions.

 prospective candidates for the
 office of president of South Viet-

 The presidential elections,

 bly to take place soon after mid-
 1967, may open up a political
 Pandora's box as the aspirants

 role of the military, the evolu-

 and the influence of the more
 dynamic northern groups as op-
 posed to that of the southerners
 with a larger popular base, will
 all probably affect the politi-

 THE CRISIS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The decision by Mao-Lin forces
 to launch late lE.st month what ap-
 pears to be a dr-_ve for final vic-
 tory over their apposition has
 triggered a counterattack which
 iias plunged Chine. into the most
 serious crisis since the estab-
 lishment of the Communist regime.
 ']'here are indications that the
 shaky coalition cf leaders formed
 .it the eleventh plenum is falling
 apart, and that the loyalty of
 Some  military leEders is increas-
 i..ngl.y in question..
 Significant breakdowns in
 transportation sErvices and pub-
 i.ic order have occurred in some
 areas. These breakdowns reflect
 successful efforts by local party
 ;authorities, prolably encouraged
 by elements at tte center,  to
 pit workers in tre provinces
 against pro-Mao Red Guard activ-
 i.sts.
 A Red Guard poster seen in
 Peking on 10 January reported
 !_.hat one of China's most impor-
 tant. rail lines--the one linking
 Shanghai and Peking--was still
 out because service across the
 `rangtze River at Nan-:king was
 blocked.   A Shanghai :broadcast
 on 11 January reporting that
 service had been restored as far
 as Nan-king is the first public
 admission that the line was out.
 Whether it has been reopened north
 of Nan-king is unknown.
 Other posters put up in Pe-
 king have reported heavy fighting
 in Nan-king from 3 to 6 January
 between pro-Mao Red Guards who
 call themselves "rebels" and
 workers mobilized by local party
 authorities.   The incidents, which
 took place in factories and other
 organizations, reportedly re-
 sulted in 900 casualties with
 54 deaths.   Public security
 forces supported by the army are
 said to have arrested 6,000 of
 the "rebels."
 The situation in Shanghai
 and Foochow may be equally dis-
 orderly, although few details
 are available.   Broadcasts indi-
 cate that a sharp struggle be-
 tween pro-Mao "rebels"--who have
 taken over some functions--and

 January to denounce the three.
 A joint Peo le's Daily - Red.

 ary implies that these are not
 isolated examples.   The most
 sweeping official  statement seen
 co date on this subject,  the
 editorial charges: that reaction-
 ary officials posing as "extreme
 leftists" are instigating armed
 struggles which lead to "serious
 incidents" and are causing fac-
 t=ories and transport services
 to shut down by bribing workers
 with. wage increases and other
 Inducements.
 The Chinese press and radio
 have reported recent strikes
 and absenteeism in Shanghai, Foo-
 chow, Peking, Canton, and Cheng-tu
 as well as violent clashes in
 Nan-king.
 Several major party and
 military figures  aho were work-

 forces have now cDme under sharp
 Red Guard attack.   This is the
 first time since  .he new leader-
 ship was formed iz August that
 Mao and Lin have  :urned against
 active members of the coalition.
 The most sta:-tling casualty
 is Tao Chu,  fourth-ranking mem-
 ber of the hierare;hy and through
 December a key f iijure in the
 regime's Cultural Revolution
 Group.   He has been savagely at-
 tacked for being it follower of
 disgraced Chief o: State Liu
 Shao--chi and party General Secre-
 Others denounced in the past
 two weeks include Wang Jen-chung,
 a proteg6 of Tao and a deputy head
 of the Cultural Revolution Group,
 Minister of Public Security Hsieh
 Fu-chih, and three major military
 leaders.
 The most significant of these
 is Liu Chih-chien, deputy direc-
 tor of the army's political con-
 trol organization and until 11
 January probably head of the
 army's Cultural Revolution Group
 --its current purge organization.
 The reorganization of this group,
 announced on 11 January, tends
 to confirm suspicions that the
 army's political loyalties have
 been divided.
 Other military leaders at-
 tacked in the past week are Liao
 Han-sheng, who holds the crucial
 post of political commissar of
 the Peking Military Region, and
 politburo member Ho Lung, a mem-
 ber of the party's Military Af-
 fairs Commission.
 Premier Chou En-lai, who
 has consistently taken a less ex-
 treme stand than Mao and Lin in
 the drive against their opponents,
 still survives but has been
 sharply criticized for the first
 time and appears to be fighting
 back.   Posters displayed in Pe-
 king on 6 and 10 January accused
 Chou of trying to soften the
 charges against Liu and Teng and
 blunting the drive against their
 followers.

 Several of Chou's protegis,
 including standing committee mem-
 ber Li :Fu-chun and politburo mem-
 bers Li Hsien-nien and Chen Yi,
 have again been denounced in
 posters.
 Developments during the past
 week indicate that the line be-
 tween opposing forces in China
 has become sharper.  The demon-
 stration of strength by opponents
 of Mao and Lin makes it seem
 likely that the struggle will be-
 come even more violent before a
 resolution is achieved.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS ORDERED HOME
 Peking since late December
 has recalled an unprecedented
 number of its representatives
 abroad in a move which will prob-
 ably affect all of its 58 for-
 eign missions.   Some Chinese dip-
 lomats have stated that they
 were returning for "vacation" but
 the most likely explanation is
 that they are being pulled back
 for screening and reindoctrina-
 tion as part of the "cultural
 revolution."
 More than 300 personnel in
 22 countries--at every level
 from chauffeur to ambassador--
 are involved, and in most cases
 at least a third of the staff is
 included.   If this pattern is
 followed in all 58 foreign mis-
 sions, the total returning could
 reach 750--a third of the ap-
 proximately 2,200 Chinese serv-
 ing abroad in a political capa-
 city.   As yet there is no indi-
 cation how many Chinese techni-
 cians stationed abroad--2,000 are
 in Mali and Guinea alone--will be
 recalled.
 Thus far at least 13 chiefs
 of mission are returning, but the
 across-the-board nature of the
 personnel cutback makes it appear
 unlikely that the recall is con-
 nected with one of the periodic
 ambassadorial-level reviews of
 foreign policy.   The most recent
 such meeting took place in De-
 cember 1965 and was attended by
 15 chiefs of mission.
 Some of the officials now
 leaving their posts will prob-
 ably return after undergoing the
 required political retreading.
 Peking may, however, take the
 opportunity to reduce its rep-
 resentatives in those countries
 where there is little prospect
 of improving China's position
 at this time.

 SUKARNO STATEMENT FAILS TO SATISFY OPPONENTS
 President Sukarno's evasive
 10 January statement concerning
 his role in the abortive Indo-
 nes.ian coup attempt of October
 1965 is likely to lead to an in-
 tensification of demands for his
 ouster.
 Sukarno, in his brief state-
 ment, refused to recognize the
 pre-eminent constitutional au-
 thority of the Provisional
 People's Consultative Assembly
 (MPRS)--Indonesia's policy-making
 body--or to cond.amn the Communist
 Party  (PKI)  as tie regime had
 wanted him to do.   He denied any
 responsibility for the attempted
 coup and the economic and moral
 decline in Indonesia.
 Sukarno said that his own
 investigation of the 1 October
 incident showed  :hat it was
 brought about by three factors--
 Communist leadership, neocoloni-
 alist and imperia:_ist subversion,
 and the existence of "undesirable
 elements" in Indonesia.   He re-
 iterated that the events of 1 Oc-
 tober were a "complete surprise"
 to him.
 This unsatiEfactory state-
 ment: will provide added ammuni-
 tion for those who want to mount
 an accelerated campaign against
 Sukarno.  Even before it was
 issued, ten "action fronts" had
 demanded that the MPRS remove
 him from office, and three popu-
 lar newspapers had highlighted
 some of his financial manipula-
 tions.
 Despite the prospects of in-
 creased activist pressures, in-
 dications are that General Su-
 harto will continue to move with
 deliberation and to rely on con-
 stitutional methods.  Parliament
 will reassemble on 23 January
 and may be asked to call a special
 session of the MPRS, which could
 then vote on some means to remove
 Sukarno from office.
 In the meantime Suharto may
 proceed with his long-pending
 plans to enlarge parliament by
 appointing 110 new members from
 groups regarded as anti-Sukarno.
 Since parliament is part of the
 MARS, this would also ensure a
 more responsive congress.

 CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LAOS
 Prime Minister Souvanna
 will probably get a more coopera-
 tive National Assembly as a re-
 sult of Laos'  1 January election,
 but the outcome has also strength-
 ened the hand of key  regional
 military commanders.
 A still incomplete tally of
 votes indicates that possibly 40
 of the new assembly's 59 seats
 will be occupied by deputies who
 were elected on the prime minis-
 ter's "united front" slate.   Al-
 though these deputies are pledged
 to support Souvanna and Laos'
 tripartite government, they prob-
 ably owe primary allegiance to
 the military commanders respon-
 sible for their success.   The
 deputies will probably back Sou-
 vanna only as long as he retains
 the support of these commanders.
 In addition,  it remains to
 be seen how much control the re-
 gional commanders can exercise
 over their delegates.   Much will
 depend on Souvanna's attitude
 and how adroitly he handles is-
 sues that are almost certain to
 rise between him and the new
 assembly.
 One suggestion of greater
 flexibility in his approach ap-
 peared in a recent conversation
 in which he indicated that he
 plans to expand his cabinet--a
 move he refused to make when the
 previous assembly demanded it.
 As expected, the election
 has weakened the positions of
 neutralist and rightist politi-
 cians.   More important, however,
 were the losses suffered by Gen-
 eral Kouprasith, chief of the
 general staff, who managed to
 elect only three of his nine
 candidates.   Kouprasith,  long
 the strongest military figure
 in Laos, will be especially con-
 cerned over the gains made by
 regional commanders whose power
 and independence he has been
 trying to curtail.
 On the military front, Com-
 munist troops,  including substan-
 tial numbers of North Vietnamese,
 overran several government posi-
 tions at Na Khang  (see Indo-China
 map on page two)  on 6 January,
 before being driven off by a
 vigorous counterattack which cost
 them 40 to 50 casualties.   Sev-
 eral other small government po-
 sitions in this area of northern
 Laos were overrun early last week,
 however,  and a concerted enemy
 push has been expected for: several
 weeks.
 If the Communists succeed in
 taking Na Khang,  friendly opera-
 tions will be hampered for a time,
 but it is doubtful that the Com-
 munists would be able to hold it
 for any extended period.

 EUROPE
 Soviet concern over events in China has been
 further demonstrated by a campaign, unprecedented
 in scope, to indoctrinate party workers.   During
 the last ten days, almost all the top Soviet lead-
 ers have fanned out across the nation to explain
 the outlines of Soviet policy on China and to re-
 ceive in return the usual unanimous pledges of
 local party support.   By this burst of activity,
 the leadership probably hopes that the lower party
 ranks will be psychologically prepared for what-
 ever happens within China or to Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions.
 President Tito is said to be planning a
 visit to the USSR soon--possibly at the end of
 this month. During Brezhnev's visit to Belgrade
 in September,  the two leaders' divergence of views
 both on Yugoslav internal developments and on an
 international conference of Communist parties was
 evident.
 Chancellor Kiesinger is holding discussions
 with President de Gaulle in Paris on 13 and 14
 January.   Both will try to generate a warmer at-
 mosphere for Franco-German relations.   Bonn's cau-
 tious moves toward closer relations with Eastern
 Europe should be well received by De Gaulle, who
 believes that his own three-stage formula  ("detente,
 entente, and then cooperation")  for developing
 some kind of Euro can unity is well into its first
 phase.

 S FCRE`7,
 SOVIET LEADERS CONDUCT NATIONWIDE BRIEFINGS OF PARTY WORKERS
 In a campaign of unprecedented
 scope,  Soviet leaders fanned out
 last week across tie nation to
 brief regional party workers on
 the regime's policies, particularly
 relations with China.   The high-
 .evel briefings arc meant to bring
 home to the party's working level
 the leadership's concern over events
 in China and to put on record a
 broad affirmation of support for
 the Kremlin's policies.
 General Secretary Brezhnev led
 off the campaign with a report to a
 -fathering of 6,000 Moscow party of-
 ficials on 4 January.   since then
 virtually all members of the polit-
 'luro and secretariat have left Mos-
 cow to address meetings in key
 cities.   Leading military figures
 have carried the message to major
 units of the armed  Forces in the
 USSR and East Germany.   Brezhnev
 Flew to Donetsk and now is in
 Corky; party secretary Suslov went
 to Leningrad; and P:-emier Kosygin
 Spoke in industrial centers in the
 I:Jrals and then went on to Vladivos-
 t.ok and Khabarovsk.   At week's end
 Soviet leaders had met with party
 activists in more taan 30 cities.
 The last campa_gn of a simi-
 t_ar nature--though on a more modest
 scale--took place in the spring of
 1_064 when party sta=_wart.s were in-
 ''_ormed of the central committee's,
 condemnation of the Chinese.
 The current meetings are tak-
 ing place behind closed doors
 There has been little pub-25X1:
 licity beyond the formal announce-
 ment that each local meeting heard
 a report on the results of the De-
 cember central committee plenum and
 adopted a resolution unanimously ap-
 proving its decisions.
 That plenum's principal busi-
 ness was to consider Brezhnev's re-
 port on foreign policy with emphasis
 on increasing tensions with China.
 The leadership apparently in-
 tends next to brief the party rank
 and file and ultimately the popula-
 tion at large.   According to Pravda,
 1.50 propagandists who attended the
 Leningrad briefing were sent out to
 pass on the word to party members
 in their districts.   The next step
 may be publication of a position
 paper in a more generalized form ap-
 propriate for a mass audience.
 The Soviet leaders during their
 travels have also inspected indus-
 trial and agricultural sites, dis-
 cussed production problems with
 local officials, and plumped for
 greater output.   They probably
 raised the specter of an increas-
 ingly hostile China to exhort the
 workers to greater effort on the
 home front.

 LUNAR PROBES HIGHLIGHT SOVIET SPACE LAUNCHINGS IN 1966
 During the year the Soviets
 conducted 47 space operations--
 five less than in 1965, their most
 active year in space.  Except for
 a new spacecraft probably intended
 for future manned flights, no rad-
 ically new or advanced systems made
 their appearance, and not a single
 manned mission was attempted.
 The program of unmanned lunar
 exploration produced the most dra-
 matic successes in the 1966 launch-
 ings.   Lunas 9 and 13 soft-landed
 on the moon and returned photo-
 graphs of the surface, and Luna
 13 added a soil analysis experi-
 ment.   Lunas 10, 11, and 12 went
 into orbit around the moon.  Al-
 though both 11 and 12 were   designed
 to photograph the lunar surface,
 only Luna 12 successfully transmit-
 ted pictures,  and these were of
 very poor quality when compared
 with those from the two US lunar
 orbiters.
 Military reconnaissance was
 the most active single program and
 accounted for half the launchings
 last year.  While the number of
 reconnaissance satellites orbited
 from Tyuratam declined,  seven were
 launched from Plesetsk bringing
 the total to 23--five more than in
 1965.   In March, the first space
 launching from Plesetsk occurred.
 The Soviets have put no men
 in space since March 1965 but in
 late November conducted the first
 unmanned orbital test of what may
 be a new spacecraft.   If so, it
 would indicate that their manned
 program is still very much alive.
 A new type of capsule may be used

 SOVIET NAVAL EXPORTS TO UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES
 The USSR exported a large
 number of naval craft in 1966 and
 deliveries are expected to remain
 high this year. They will include
 more OSA-class guided-missile pa-
 trol boats, first exported to non-
 Communist countries in 1966, and
 possibly the initial delivery of
 F-class submarines.
 The bulk of deliveries last
 year were to Egypt in fulfillment
 of a 1964 arms agreement.   Since
 October the USSR has exported ten
 OSAs to Egypt and at least two
 more are scheduled for delivery
 this month.   Five R-class sub-
 marines,  a later model of the W-
 class formerly supplied to nonbloc
 countries,  arrived in Alexandria
 in mid-1966.   In addition, Egypt
 exchanged two W-class submarines
 for reconditioned models,  and re-
 ceived four SO-1 submarine
 chasers and a POLUCHAT-1 torpedo
 retriever.
 Algeria, which has the second
 largest ground and air force in
 North Africa, now is building up
 its naval force with Soviet equip-
 ment.   It has obtained six KOMAR-
 class guided-missile patrol boats
 since November, and will probably
 get a destroyer and possibly a
 submarine after Algerian naval
 personnel are trained to operate
 them.
 Somalia has received four
 and Guinea two POLUCHAT-1s,  to
 be used as coastal patrol boats,
 and under a recent agreement
 Tanzania will get four recondi-
 tioned P-4 class motor torpedo
 boats.   Iraq has eight KOMARs
 and eight minesweepers on order
 under an arms agreement signed
 last May and is expecting de-
 liveries to begin this year.
 The first deliveries--two
 POLNOCNY-class LSTs--under the
 USSR's October 1965 naval aid
 agreement with India were made
 last year.   Four submarines, a
 submarine tender,  five PETYA-
 class patrol boats and five
 small patrol boats are on order.
 Although New Delhi may, as part
 of its austerity program,  cancel
 some of these orders,  it is ex-
 pected this year to get an F-
 class, long-range, diesel-powered
 submarine, the first the USSR
 will have exported.

 WEST GERMANY SEEKS FORMAL TIES WITH EASTERN EUROPE
 Bonn is cautiously sounding
 out East European capitals on pos-
 sibilities for establishing dip-
 lomatic relations.  A Foreign Min-
 istry delegation left for Prague
 on 9 January, and a ranking min-
 istry official is scheduled to go
 to Budapest later this month.
 Probably the most serious discus-
 sions will be undertaken by a ne-
 gotiating team which recently ar-
 rived in Bucharest.
 This initiative is a follow
 up to Chancellor Kiesinger's
 13 December policy statement call-
 ing for diplomatic relations with
 East European countries  'Wherever
 this is possible under the circum-
 stances."   It is also a natural
 extension of the policy of relax-
 ation toward the East that former
 foreign minister Schroeder began
 in the latter years of Adenauer's
 rule.  West German officials in
 recent years have reasoned that
 if the Federal Republic could win
 greater trust from the East Euro-
 pean states,  the climate for
 eventual reunification of Germany
 would be improved.
 According to the German
 charge in Washington,  the Kie-
 singer government believes Ru-
 mania offers the best chance for
 a diplomatic breakthrough.   Thus,
 the major emphasis will be placed
 on the Bucharest talks, despite
 the feeling of some of Foreign
 Minister Brandt's Social Demo-
 crats that an accord with Warsaw
 or Prague would be a more signifi-
 cant achievement.
 While Kiesinger's policy
 statement did speak of German
 desires for "reconciliation with
 Poland," the charge explained
 that Warsaw was not included in
 the current campaign because it
 would demand recognition of the
 Oder-Neisse line.   Prague,  like-
 wise, is likely to attach numer-
 ous conditions to an agreement,
 including German acceptance of
 its view that the Munich Pact of
 1938 was invalid from its incep-
 tion.
 On the other hand,  Rumania
 is expected to give serious con-
 sideration to the German initia-
 tive since an agreement would
 help advance its independent
 image.  The main problem is the
 applicability of any agreement to
 West Berlin, but a West German
 official recently indicated that
 a simple verbal understanding
 might be sufficient.
 Bonn hopes ko preserve the
 Hallstein Doctrine, under which
 it threatens to sever diplomatic
 relations with any country recog-
 nizing East Germany.   The charge
 said that Bonn would seek the
 help of its Western allies in
 convincing third countries that
 the doctrine excepts East Euro-
 pean states on the ground that
 they recognized the Ulbricht re-
 gime at Moscow's behest.               25X1

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Syria's exchanges of fire with Israel, includ-
 ing two tank skirmishes, have overshadowed other
 Arab-Israeli incidents.
 Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Turks are
 mounting a wide-ranging diplomatic campaign to en-
 sure that Czech arms the Makarios government brought
 into Cyprus last month are placed under UN custody.
 Ankara is also expressing some concern over the
 lack of a stable government in Athens with which
 to deal.   Andreas Papandreou's belated acceptance
 of his father's decision to support the interim
 Greek Government has removed the immediate threat
 of a split by one of the country's two major parties
 before the elections next spring.
 The conflict between aggressively nationalist
 Africa and some European interests continues to
 keep the Congolese and Rhodesian situations hot.
 Union Miniere evidently is standing up against
 Congolese President Mobutu's further demands follow-
 ing his seizure of the company's local properties.
 The Portuguese foreign minister has reiterated Lis-
 bon's intention to defend its interests in Africa
 and implied resistance to the UN sanctions program
 against the rebel Rhodesian regime.  With few other
 exceptions, the program is receiving world-wide
 compliance.

 ISRAEL WARNS SYRIA ON BORDER FIRING
 While Israel's Jordanian
 border has been relatively quiet
 for several weeks, the situation
 along its disputed frontier with
 Syria has worsened. The almost
 daily series of incidents that
 began in late December have in-
 cluded tank duels on 9 and 11
 January.   The Syrians had used
 tank fire during earlier ex-
 changes, but the Israelis had
 not previously responded in kind.
 The use of heavier weapons
 increases the possibility of an
 Israeli retaliatory strike against
 Syria.   Although Israel has suf-
 fered a few minor casualties,
 thus far there have been no fa-
 talities.   As in the past,  the
 death of Israelis or extensive
 damage to Israeli property could
 quickly trigger a reprisal.
 Israeli officials in recent
 days have referred frequently
 to the mounting gravity of the
 situation.   Prime Minister Esh-
 kol,                      in a press interview,  said
 the shootings "are not the usual
 seasonal business....  I must warn
 those who are responsible in
 Damascus that we will tolerate
 no attacks on the well-being of
 our citizens or our sovereignty.
 Syria is not immune."   Israel
 has also sent notes to the
 UN Security Council but as yet
 has made no formal complaint.
 The current recriminatory
 exchanges among the Arab states
 over defense policy toward Israel
 probably have encouraged the
 Syrians to be especially belli-
 cose at this time.   According
 to the US Embassy in Damascus,
 they appear to be bracing them-
 selves for a possible Israeli
 strike.   There is no indication,
 however,  that Syria intends to
 stop trying to prevent Israeli
 "incursions" on Arab-claimed
 lands, which have been the al-
 leged cause of many of the in-
 cidents.
 Many of the recent incidents
 stem from long-standing differ-
 ences over rights to fields in
 the demilitarized zones estab-
 lished by the 1949 armistice
 agreement between the two coun-
 tries.   Syria contests Israel's
 claim to sovereignty over the
 zones and each year fires on
 the Israelis who attempt to work
 in "Arab"  fields within them.
 Local UN officials have been un-
 able to resolve the dispute.

 ELECTION CAMPAIGN UNDER WAY IN INDIA
 Serious campaigning for India's
 15-21 February general election now
 has begun in an unusually turbulent
 political atmosphere,  and prospects
 For the ruling Congress Party are
 uncertain.   With a month to go,
 Congress is expected to retain a
 comfortable, but reduced, majority
 is the national parliament, but to
 do less well in the balloting for
 16 state legislative assemblies.
 '[he stultifying effects of
 almost 20 years in power have weak-
 ened the party's appeal and effec-
 t:_ven.ess.   It is faction ridden,
 internally divided on major issues,
 and to some extent blamed for the
 country's current economic prob-
 lems.   A prolonged struggle for
 party nominations has further
 hardened the lines of caste and
 Faction within the party organiza-
 t:_on.
 In several states dissident
 leaders have resigned, have set up
 rebel parties,  and are negotiating
 w:Lth opposition groups to form anti-
 Congress electoral fronts.   As a
 result, Congress stands a good
 chance of losing power or being
 forced into coalition governments
 in at least three states, and will
 face a hard fight in one or two
 others.   Politically volatile West
 Bengal will probably remain under
 Congress rule, but mainly because
 the leftist opposition has been
 unable to form an electoral alli-
 ance.   In the southern state of
 Kerala, a Communist-led electoral
 front. is almost certain to win
 against two rival Congress organi-
 zations.
 Despite these problems and
 the loss of the charismatic lead-
 ership of Jawaharlal Nehru,  Con-
 gress still has some advantages
 over its splintered opposition.
 No other party has been able to
 attract a significant following
 on an all-India basis.   Some have
 only regional support.   Others
 with aspirations for national
 standing--such as the conserva-
 tive Swatantra, the two rival Com-
 munist parties,  and the Hindu com-
 munal Jan Sangh--have only pockets
 of strength in widely scattered
 parts of the country.
 Congress, on the other hand,
 has a generally strong nationwide
 organization and in most areas is
 well financed.   As the party that
 led the independence movement and
 that has dominated the political
 scene since independence, it is
 in a position to dispense patron-
 age and commands decades-old loy-
 alties.   It has also acquired a
 degree of expertise in manipulat-
 ing caste and communal groups,  an
 important element in winning In-
 dian elections.
 The pre-election period has
 thus far been one of unusual so-
 cial and political turmoil, even
 for India.   Opposition parties,
 especially the Jan Sangh and both
 Communist factions, have been
 quick to capitalize on this un-
 rest and in some cases have been
 the prime instigators.   Voting
 patterns will probably be deter-
 mined more than ever before by
 the performance of Congress-con-
 trolled national and state gov-
 ernments and the ability of Con-
 gress and its rivals to get out

 NIGERIAN RULERS MEET IN GHANA
 Nigeria's long drift toward
 fragmentation and possible civil
 war has been checked at least for
 the moment by the meeting of all
 key leaders of the country's mili-
 tary regime in nearby Ghana on
 4 and 5 January.   However, the
 small measure of agreement re-
 flected in their communiques is
 still offset by wide divergencies
 on basic issues.
 The meeting was recalcitrant
 Eastern military governor Ojukwu's
 first face-to-face encounter with
 the head of the federal government,
 Lt. Col.  Gowon, and the other
 three regional governors since
 Northern soldiers killed General
 Ironsi--the Easterner who led the
 previous military regime--and in-
 stalled Gowon in power last sum-
 mer.   It was brought about largely
 by the quiet go-between efforts
 of British trouble shooter Malcolm
 MacDonald.   The Ghanaian hosts--
 British-trained army and police
 officers like the Nigerians--also
 helped to arrange the talks and
 then to preside over them.
 Early agreement on a decla-
 ration renouncing the use of force
 as a means of settling the complex
 Nigerian crisis helped restore a
 degree of confidence and trust
 among the leaders--the most im-
 portant single achievement of the
 meeting.   They all agreed their
 interim regime should continue
 for some time and made some prog-
 ress in spelling out powers and
 functions of its basic central
 and regional institutions.   Lim-
 ited agreement was also reached
 on reorganizing the shattered army
 into regional commands and on
 measures to ease the plight of
 victims--mainly Easterners--of
 last year's upheavals.
 The leaders who make up the
 Supreme Military Council  (SMC)
 made no real attempt, however,
 even to come to grips with such
 difficult core questions as the
 creation of new states and the
 allocation of revenues and powers
 in a permanent government system.
 Their final communique merely
 provided for the resumption "as
 soon as practicable" of the ad-
 journed constitutional conference,
 and looked forward to future
 meetings of the SMC within Ni-
 geria itself.   Ojukwu has indi-
 cated that three special new ex-
 pert committees concerned with
 finance,  the army, and federal
 decrees are to meet over the next
 month, with an SMC session to
 follow if a venue can be agreed
 on.   Early implementation of the
 limited agreements reached in
 Ghana will be a prerequisite to
 more significant progress.
 Nigerian reaction to the
 meeting and its communiques has
 so far been highly favorable
 with the Eastern media and Ojukwu
 himself hailing it as a triumph
 for the regionalism they espouse.
 A general relaxation of major
 tensions, already reflected in
 the Western governor's 7 January
 announcement that roadblocks were
 being lifted in his region,  thus
 seems likely for the immediate
 future.

 UNION MINIER
 r TAKES HARD LINE IN DISPUTE WITH CONGO
 Congolese President Mobutu's
 confrontation with union Miniere
 continues, with no sign that the
 company is particularly inter-
 ested in rescuing the Congolese
 from a potentially disastrous
 economic crisis.
 There are some indications
 .hat Mobutu is becoming less in-
 transigent.   Nothing has been
 heard recently,  fir instance, of
 his threat to seize the extensive
 Congolese assets Df Union Miniere's
 largest stockholder, the Societe
 Generale holding company, on 15
 ,-anuary unless Union Miniere
 yielded to his demands.
 Union Miniere has still not
 made public its attitude toward
 such indications  Df a softening
 on Mobutu's part.
 Union Miniere has a substan-
 tial amount of unsold copper out-
 side the Congo.   It thus can
 satisfy its regular customers for
 several months and can play a
 waiting game at relatively little
 cost.
 The Congo, on the other hand,
 cannot.   Kinshasa's foreign ex-
 change reserves are nearly ex-
 hatisted, and stocks of consumer
 goods and materials needed to
 keep the country's industry going
 are measured in days and weeks
 for most articles.   A long im-
 passe would probably force the
 shutdown of the mines, which are
 still producing at the moment
 although exports have been
 halted.
 While the majority of Congo-
 lese still are largely outside
 the cash economy and would not
 be seriously affected by an eco-
 nomic crisis, considerable unrest
 in the large and politically im-
 portant urban areas would be ex-
 pected if the crisis should con-
 tinue.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Recent developments in several Latin American nations in-
 dicate an upsurge in contacts--primarily commercial--with Com-
 munist states.  Other Western Hemisphere nations will be watch-
 ing the results and, if they see economic benefits or prestige
 for themselves, may well move in a similar direction.
 In some cases, the initiative evidently has come from the
 Latin Americans.   Colombia's five-month-old Lleras administra-
 tion,  for example, has moved to establish diplomatic and trade
 relations with several Eastern European nations and may soon
 approach the USSR and other Communist countries as well.   The
 main inducement here would appear to be the possibility of ex-
 panding trade, and Soviet and Polish trade missions are due in
 Bogota within the next few weeks.
 Moreover, the Communists are offering trade deals to coun-
 tries hungry for nontraditional markets for their primary ex-
 ports.                           Should such deals be consummated, local pressures for
 exchanging diplomatic missions with Communist countries will
 be stepped u .
 Since last August, Ecuador has signed agreements to sell ba-
 nanas and coffee to East Germany and Poland, and has had over-
 tures from the Czechs and Hungarians aimed at expanding com-
 merical ties.
 ~A Brazilian delegation
 will visit Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague beginning on 14 January
 but is not expected to come home with any startling new trade
 deals.
 On another front, Argentina's 4 January decision to claim
 sovereignty over waters within 200 miles of its coastline will
 further complicate chances of achieving any common hemispheric
 position on this matter soon.   Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and El
 Salvador also claim a 200-mile territorial sea and can be ex-
 pected to applaud the Argentine move, but the Brazilians are
 said to be upset by it and other countries which fish in this
 area probably will oppose it as well.   The problems posed by
 such extensive claims were illustrated by Ecuador's detention
 on 7 January of three US-owned tuna boats which Quito alleged
 were fishing well within Ecuadorean waters.

 CHILEAN OPPOSITION PARTY IMPROVES POSITION
 The electio~-i of Socialist
 Party leader Sal'iador Allende as
 president of the Chilean Senate
 has enhanced the opposition role
 in that body and improved the So-
 cialists'  political position. The
 Frei administration, although it
 controls the lower house,  lacks a
 majority in the ,senate but pre-
 viously held the leadership there
 by virtue of the swing vote exer-
 cised by the vaguely rightist Rad-
 ical Party  (PR).   Although no se-
 rious obstructio:iism is expected,,
 Allende's election is a definite
 slap at Presiden: Frei--who is
 about to visit t.ae United States.
 The Socialist Party  (PS)  co--
 operates with tht~ Communist Party
 (PCCh)  in a PopuLar Action Front
 (FRAP), but thei..- relations have
 become strained  because the PS
 generally espouses a more extreme
 line than the PC(,h and is less
 willing to coope.:ate with the gov-
 ernment.
 On 21 December, the PDC
 president and vie president of
 the Senate were :)usted in a vote
 in which the Radicals cooperated
 with FRAP.   This situation had oc-
 curred twice before in 1966, but
 FRAP and the PR  iad never been
 able to agree af:erward on a new
 leadership.   This time the PR was
 determined not t,:) re--elect the
 PDC leaders and, while not op-
 posed to a Socialist president,
 refused to accept a Communist vice
 president.   The  ?RAP partners
 stood firm against naming a Rad-
 ical.   The slate finally agreed
 to give the presidency to the
 Socialists' Alle:Zde and the vice--
 presidency to Luis Fernando
 Luengo, a member of the small
 left-wing Social Democratic
 Party.
 Allende, who lost the na-
 tional presidential election in
 1958 and was again defeated by
 Frei   in  1964, has been one of
 the Frei administration's loudest
 critics.   He is a firm supporter
 of Fidel Castro and has on sev-
 eral occasions praised Castro's
 attacks on Frei. As Senate presi-
 dent he will be able to guide
 debate and to some extent control
 the movement of bills through
 the Senate machinery.   As a re-
 sult Frei will probably face in-
 creased harassment in Congress,
 especially when it debates his
 request for permission to leave
 the country for his US visit in
 February.
 An example of Allende's
 power as Senate president was his
 granting permission to use Senate
 facilities for a local celebra-
 tion of the Cuban revolution an-
 niversary on 2 January.   This ac-
 tion displeased the Radicals,
 however,  so Allende in the future
 may have to make greater efforts
 to heed their wishes or risk
 losing their votes.
 The Communists'  failure to
 elect a member to the Senate
 leadership was a blow to their
 position as an important leftist
 force.   They now face the pros-
 pect of operating in the shadow
 of the more extremely leftist So-
 cialist Party.

 GUYANA'S COALITION GOVERNMENT FALTERS
 Political differences between
 Guyana's Prime Minister Burnham
 and his junior coalition partner,
 Finance Minister D'Aguiar, nearly
 broke up their shaky two-year-old
 partnership last week.   The two
 leaders have never gotten on well
 and,  although they now appear to
 be trying to patch up their most
 recent quarrel,  they have not yet
 reached complete agreement.
 D'Aguiar has reluctantly
 withdrawn his demand for complete
 jurisdiction over economic devel-
 opment and Burnham has agreed to
 postpone the transfer of civil
 service control from D'Aguiar's
 ministry--two of last week's
 sticking points.   Burnham has
 also agreed to grant D'Aguiar's
 request that Minister of Works
 and Hydraulics Mohamed Kasim be
 removed from the cabinet.   How-
 ever, he has not yet asked for
 Kasim's resignation and the de-
 lay is beginning to antagonize
 D'Aguiar.
 The prime minister is reluc-
 tant to dump Kasim,  a Burnham
 supporter who is a member of
 D'Aguiar's United Force  (UF)
 party, because he believes that
 Kasim would remain in the govern-
 ment and help him retain a working
 majority in the legislature should
 D'Aguiar resign.   D'Aguiar wants
 the way cleared for another, more
 acceptable UF member to be ap-
 pointed to Kasim's post and his
 determination to see this accom-
 plished is growing.
 Both leaders understand that
 the alternative to their coali-
 tion government would be,  at best,
 a Burnham-led minority government
 or,  at worst, one headed by pro-
 Communist opposition leader
 Cheddi Jagan, whose party holds
 the largest single block of seats
 in the legislature.   For this
 reason Burnham and D'Aguiar have
 declared themselves willing to
 make an extra effort to stay to-
 gether.   Nevertheless,  they both
 feel justified in their positions
 and,  as always, seem unable to
 keep from antagonizing each other.
 Even if they manage to patch up
 the current quarrel, other dis-
 agreements are sure to threaten
 the coalition in the future.
 If D'Aguiar were to resign,
 Burnham could probably at least
 temporarily hold the support of
 enough members of the finance
 minister's party to maintain a
 slim working majority in the
 legislature.   Many members of
 D'Aguiar's party are dissatisfied
 with Burnham's administration,
 however,  and without D'Aguiar in
 the government the coalition
 would be on a much weaker footing.

 DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONS WITH OPPOSITION DETERIORATE
 Radical elements in control.
 of the left-of-center Dominican
 Revolutionary Pnn.rty  (PRD)  appear
 headed toward more militant oppo-
 sition to the Bn:.laguer government
 after a period of hesitation over
 the past few months.
 The major theme in the PRD
 attack on Balaguer is the allega.-
 tion that his government is "neo-
 Trujillista."   The PRD has charged
 the President, who faithfully
 served Trujillo for many years,
 with systematic political perse-
 cution and authoritarian implemen-
 tation of his pc,licies.   Jottin
 Cury,  the PRD's far left fire-
 brand in Congress, has said he
 will present to the legislature
 formal charges Egainst Balaguer
 for "grave faults in the exercise
 of his duties."   PRD Secretary
 General Pena Gon.ez has charged
 that the government is becoming
 "de facto" throigh arbitrary ac-
 tions.
 The conduct. of the Balaguer
 government has lent a degree of
 credibility to the often exagger-
 ated PRD charges.   The government
 has not appearec concerned about
 sporadic acts of political vio-
 lence and the pclice at times ap-
 pear heavy handed.   Balaguer him-
 self has shown r.o disposition to
 seek a reconciliation with the
 left and elements in his entourage
 consider the PRE  little better
 than Communists.
 Although the rhetoric of the
 PRD radicals is often more in-
 flammatory than their acts, re-
 cent statements by the leaders
 suggest they may be moving toward
 violent opposition to Balaguer.
 Pena,  for example, has said that
 the PRD rank and file, having had
 five months of Balaguer's "re-
 pression," hope he will be over-
 thrown.   Cury's statement that
 the political spectrum is polariz-
 ing into "Trujillismo versus anti-
 Trujillismo" rather than left
 versus right, and statements by
 Pena absolving rightist civil-
 military elements of responsibil-
 ity for political terrorism sug-
 gest that the party may seek an
 alliance with political opportun-
 ists of the far right.
 Meanwhile, dissident PRD
 moderates and conservatives, hav-
 ing failed to shake the radicals'
 hold on the leadership, have an-
 nounced plans to hold a "conven-
 tion," apparently to establish
 an "authentic" PRD.   Past efforts
 by party dissident Angel Miolan
 to establish a party independent
 of the PRD have failed but en-
 couragement of the new effort
 by Balaguer and the radicalism
 of the new leaders may make
 this try more successful.   Such
 a movement would probably lead
 to stepped-up efforts by the dis-
 sidents to tag the present PRD
 leadership with the Communist

 NO CLEAR VICTORY IN BAHAMAS ELECTIONS
 The standoff in the 10 Jan-
 uary House of Assembly elections
 presents the British governor
 general with a difficult task
 in trying to form a new govern-
 ment.   The government had called
 the election following allega-
 tions by the opposition Progres-
 sive Liberal Party  (PLP)  of cor-
 ruption on the part of the ruling
 United Bahamian Party  (UBP).
 The Negro-led PLP dramati-
 cally increased its representa-
 tion in the House of Assembly
 from four to 18 seats, equaling
 the number won by the conserva-
 tive UBP.   One of the two remain-
 ing seats was won by a member of
 the Labor Party who is expected
 to vote with the PLP.   The other
 went to an independent whose
 alignment is in doubt.   The more
 moderate opposition National
 Democratic Party lost all repre-
 sentation.
 The PLP, campaigning on the
 issues of alleged gambling cor-
 ruption in government and white
 rule, captured 12 of the 17
 seats from populous New Provi-
 dence Island, where the capital
 is located, while only four
 went to the UBP and the remain-
 ing one to the Labor Party.   UBP
 Premier Sir Roland Symonette re-
 tained his seat by the slim mar-
 gin of some 50 votes.   The out-
 lying islands on which the UBP
 had heavily depended failed to
 deliver the expected victories.
 Under the constitution the
 governor appoints as premier the
 man he believes best able to com-
 mand the confidence of the major-
 ity of House of Assembly members.
 If neither party can form a work-
 ing majority, or is unwilling to
 enter into coalition with the
 other, new elections would have
 to be held.
 The PLP, formed in 1953, has
 for the first time effectively
 challenged the tight control of
 the Bahamas by the white-led UBP.
 Jubilant Negroes marched through
 the streets celebrating what
 their leaders called an end of
 "three centuries of white rule."
 If the PLP is chosen to
 form the next government, party
 leader Lynden O. Pindling will
 become premier.   Pindling is
 an energetic and intelligent
 individual.   He told the US
 consul general that he acts as
 a moderating influence on party
 extremists.
 Investors are apparently
 concerned over a possible end to
 their freedom from taxation in
 the Bahamas.   PLP views vary on

 this issue.   The Bahamian consti-
 tution provides that legislation
 proposing taxation can be delayed
 by the Senate for at least 15
 months.   The control of the Sen-
 ate is "nonpartisan" because even
 the combined representatives of
 the two main parties cannot de-
 feat a solid vote of the gover-
 nor's eight apoiatees--white
 businessmen.   According to a
 leading Bahamian barrister this
 ensures ample time for an ex-
 pression of public opinion and
 also gives investors the oppor-
 tunity to take action on their
 assets if they deem it expedient.
 The US consul general in
 Nassau predicts a period of gen-
 eral economic and political con-
 fusion.
