 Recent events have done nothing to clarify
 Chairman Mao's current political status.   He sent
 a wreath to, but did not attend, the funeral of his
 old comrade Tung Pi-wu, and he failed to meet the
 visiting Tunisian prime minister.
 Given Tung's role, along with Mao,  in founding
 the party, the Chairman's failure to attend Tung's
 funeral is significant. His absence was somewhat
 obscured by the absence of several other Politburo
 members, but they were either out of the country
 or in the provinces. The only other notable
 absentee was Chou En-lai, who met with the Tunisian
 prime minister a few days earlier.   Chou was prob-
 ably healthy enough to attend the funeral, but it
 seems likely that he stayed away to make Mao's ab-
 sence less conspicuous. Politburo member Wang Tung-
 hsing, who used to be Mao's bodyguard, also missed
 the funeral,  suggesting he may be staying with Mao
 in the provinces.
 Despite what appeared to be a conscious effort
 to soften the impact of Mao's absence, Yeh Chien-ying
 in his eulogy to Tung seemed to underscore that ab-
 sence in his reference to the joint role of Mao and
 'Tung in founding the party.  Ironically, Yeh said in
 public what Teng Hsiao-ping curiously failed to men-
 tion in his private speech to the Central Committee
 in January.   Teng made no reference to Mao's role-in
 founding the party in his comments on the Chairman's
 early political activities.  If this omission was in-
 tended to slight Mao--and it appears that,it was--
 Chinese leaders are obviously being careful to
 balance unflattering private statements with lauda-
 tory public statements.

 a speech by chief
 economic planner Yu Chiu-li to the National
 People's Congress seemed to raise much the same
 criticism of Mao that other Chinese officials
 have made. Yu complained that political instability
 over the last ten years, i.e., since the Cultural
 Revolution, has had an adverse effect on economic
 development. He raised yet another issue on which
 the Chairman is vulnerable--the failure of the
 Great Leap Forward--when he commented that the
 "three difficult years"  (a synonym for the Great
 Leap Forward failures) could not be blamed on
 others, specifically the Soviets.
 Yu's reference to the Soviets, in what could
 imply a more flexible attitude toward Moscow,
 coincides with comments of other Chinese officials
 that appear critical of Mao's policy toward the
 Soviet Union. Yu's comment, however, could also
 be read as an answer to those--if any--who may be
 arguing that an improvement in relations with
 Moscow might bring needed economic assistance.
 Yu's message was that responsibility for economic
 development is in Chinese hands.
 Comments by some Chekiang provincial officials
 raise still further questions about Mao's status.
 They reportedly believe that Mao, at his own
 request, is in the "second line" of leadership
 and has become the adviser to "first-line" leader
 Chou En-lai. This view is the reverse of last
 year's anti-Confucius propaganda, which portrayed
 historical prime ministers as advisers to their
 emperors. Whether Mao is in fact in the second
 line and whether he is there of his own volition
 remain open to question. Nevertheless, coming on
 the heels of comments by officials in Fukien
 Province that Mao's influence is on the decline,

 Peking's Reporting on Indochina Picks Up
 Peking continues to replay PRG and North Viet-
 namese commentary on the situation in South Vietnam,
 but has so far refrained from elaborating its own
 view of the fighting.  Chinese coverage of the Cam-
 bodian situation is somewhat more intensive, but
 still centers on the inevitability of an insurgent
 victory.   In both cases, Peking seems to be getting
 over its earlier surprise at the rapidity of recent
 developments, and its press is now keeping pace with
 battlefield developments.
 one new element in Chinese press treatment of
 the war revolves around the US domestic debate over
 US involvement in Indochina.   In an April 1 Peking
 radio broadcast, the Chinese referred to the divi-
 sion among US leaders on this question, pointing out
 that some Americans argue that the Indochina effort
 has prevented the US from devoting sufficient atten-
 tion to Europe, which should be Washington's "primary"
 concern.
 The Chinese seem to be arguing that the US should
 not allow itself to be drawn into increasing its in-
 volvement in South Vietnam, a step they allege would
 seriously weaken the US capability to devote adequate
 attention to more important areas where the Soviet
 "threat" is greater.   Hong Kong's communist Ta Kung
 Pao reflected this notion last week, suggesting that
 the US should remember the lesson of the 1960s when,
 after becoming "bogged down in the quagmire of Indo-
 china," the Soviets were able to "sneak into the
 Middle East and Europe."
 By casting Washington's Indochina "predicament"
 in the context of Soviet-US confrontation, Peking
 may be attempting to forestall the possibility of

 Indochina creating problems in Sino-US relations.
 At the same time, of course,   this approach tends
 to play down Peking's influence over events in
 Vietnam.
 Recent reports from several sources quoting
 Chinese officials abroad support this line of
 reasoning.   These sources strongly suggest that
 Peking had been surprised and disturbed at the
 rapid pace of North Vietnamese battlefield suc-
 cesses in South Vietnam.   In late March,
 claimed Peking had
 no _._? n g to           TIT-71      Wlu  t North Vietnamese
 offensive and would not supply additional aid to
 support the campaign.   In early April,
 said a Chinese military     eg     n
 that visi?e  Hanoi in March had discussed only rou-
 tine military aid with the North Vietnamese and that
 the Chinese had not been forewarned of plans for an
 offensive.                         the Chinese had been
 led to believe   a -,   anoi s intention was to press
 for implementation of the Paris agreement while it
 continued mopping-up operations in "liberated" areas.
 said in
 early April that Peking had curtailed Soviet mili-
 tary aid to Hanoi in the past and suggested that the
 Chinese were considering similar steps in order to
 impede both Soviet and North Vietnamese efforts to
 "establish hegemony" in other parts of Indochina.   He
 also suggested that Peking was taking other measures
 to improve its position in both Laos and Cambodia.
 Peking is clearly.attempting to make the best
 of the complicated situation in Indochina, playing
 down its own role in Vietnam in order not to jeop-
 ardize its more important interests with the US,
 while maintaining efforts to improve its influence
 in Cambodia and Laos.   Peking will not, of course,

 abandon its equities in Hanoi and presumably will
 maintain what it considers to be "proper" levels
 of military assistance.            The North Vietnamese
 have reportedly applied strong pressures on Peking
 to provide additional foodstuffs, transportation,
 and other aid for recently liberated areas in
 South Vietnam.   Peking will probably respond rather
 generously to these requests.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN

 The political fortunes of Politburo members
 Chiang Ching and Hsu Shih-yu do not appear very
 bright at the moment. There were indications dur-
 ing the anti-Confucius campaign last year that the
 two were linked in some way, and this apparent con-
 nection is now being talked about by Chinese offi-
 cials.   Adding to Madame Mao's woes,  in particular,
 is the belief now being expressed by Chinese that
 Mao himself is unhappy with her political performance.
 Chiang Ching's current round of difficulties
 appears to date back to early January, when the lead-
 ership was working up a slate of new government of-
 e's Con-
 Mao did
 is wire to hold a government post and, ac-
 cording to one account, even vetoed her nomination
 to the relatively innocuous position as one of sev-
 eral vice chairmen of the National People's Congress.
 Adding insult to injury, Mao reportedly praised Chou
 En-lai's wife and the widow of former vice premier
 Li Fu-chun as the two most respected female party
 officials.
 On one occasion, Mao reportedly became so angry
 with Chiang Ching that he wanted her removed from
 the Politburo.

 Another ominous sign is a letter from Mao in
 which he warned Chiang Ching of Lin Piao's treach-
 ery and advised her to correct her own mistakes.
 The letter was first circulated in 1972 as part of
 the campaign to discredit Lin, and was circulated
 again last year in conjunction with the anti-Con-
 fucius campaign.   The same letter reportedly was
 disseminated throughout China earlier this year and
 is the subject of study sessions.   Madame Mao made
 her first public appearance since the National
 People's Congress at Tung Pi-wu's funeral on April
 7.   During her absence, International Women's Day,
 a time for praising the contributions of female
 party members, passed without a single mention of
 her.
 Canton Military Region commander Hsu Shih-yu
 seems to be facing double jeopardy. As a regional
 military commander, he automatically falls within
 a group viewed with some suspicion by the civilian
 leadership in Peking.   In addition, Hsu, perhaps more
 than any other regional commander, seems in the past
 year to have developed ties with the party's left
 wing and especially its leader, Chiang Ching.
 This connection, alluded to by historical analogy
 in the propaganda last year, is now being openly ex-
 ressed b  Chinese officials.                                       25X1C
 some of the military and the

 several military regions where leftist sympathies ran
 high, and these included Hsu Shih-yu's former and cur-
 rent commands. Chekiang Province officials recently
 claimed that Hsu was in line for the job of defense
 minister, but lost out because he "supported the left-
 ists" during the anti-Confucius campaign.
 Whether Hsu was ever seriously in the running
 for the defense portfolio, there were several indica-
 tions last year that Madame Mao was in correspondence

 with troops under his command and, perhaps, even
 with Hsu personally.  According to rumors in Canton,
 Chiang Ching even visited Hsu in April of last year.
 Like Madame Mao, Hsu dropped out of sight after the
 National People's Congress.   Unlike her, he did not
 appear at Tung Pi-wu's funeral but only sent a
 wreath.   Possibly as a sign of Peking's suspicions
 about Hsu, he is the only regional military commander
 with two civilian members of the Politburo as politi-
 . cal commissars in his region.
 Although both Chiang Ching and Hsu Shih-yu ap-
 pear to be under a dark cloud, it is not at all cer-
 tain that they will suffer any major political ca-
 tastrophe in the near future.   Given Peking's concern
 with promoting unity and stability--and evidently
 with setting such an example among the top ranks of
 the party--a decision to remove either of the two
 from office would probably have to be weighed against
 the potentially destabilizing effects of such a move.
 As one Chinese has claimed, Chou En-lai had "his own
 political reasons" for not wanting Madame Mao to be
 completely humiliated.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO

 Peking Comments on Taiwan
 Nationalist President Chiang Kai-shek's death
 last week provided Peking with the opportunity to
 reiterate a theme to which it has given heavy at-
 tention in recent weeks--the hope that Taiwan's
 residents would participate in the peaceful reuni-
 fication of the island with the mainland.
 Commenting last week on Chiang's death,
 PeopZe'a Daily--after characterizing the Generalis-
 simo as the "common enemy of all Chinese people"
 --asserted that "patriotic" military and govern-
 ment personnel on Taiwan could now actively con-
 tribute to Taiwan's reunification with the main-
 land.   The brief article also pointed out that
 increasing numbers of people on Taiwan would be
 able to see the benefits of solidarity among all
 Chinese peoples.   No timing for the island's
 liberation was mentioned, however, in keeping
 with the patience Peking has shown for some time
 on this issue.
 Peking's renewed enthusiasm for increased
 communication and cooperation between Chinese on
 both sides of the Taiwan Strait surfaced last
 February.    On February 27, marking the anniversary
 of the 1948 uprising on Taiwan, Liao Cheng-chih
 claimed that many former Taiwan residents had
 returned to China and said he hoped more "com-
 patriots" would come to "tour, see relatives, and
 take part in various activities."   Liao also ex-
 pressed confidence that "patriotic forces" on
 Taiwan would grow and contribute there to the

 The themes of peaceful reunification and
 Peking's desire for more communication with Taiwan
 residents were pointed up again in March, when

 the Chinese announced the amnesty and release of
 nearly 300 Nationalist "war criminals."  At that
 time, Peking said the released prisoners could
 travel to Taiwan, if they wished.           Although none
 of the prisoners has as yet exercised that option,
 Peking's frequent references to it suggest
 that some of the prisoners will eventually make
 the attempt.
 The activities of the released prisoners
 have been given extensive coverage in the Chinese
 media, with emphasis on their salutary comments
 about the changes in China since the communists
 came to power in 1949.   In Hong Kong, the communist
 press has carried a number of articles on the am-
 nesty, urging Taiwan residents to work for reuni-
 fication.   One Hong Kong newspaper has pointed'out
 that Peking is likely to treat Taiwan residents
 fairly after "liberation," because among those
 pardoned last month were some of the most notorious
 Nationalist "war criminals."
 In late March, Peking returned to the notion
 of improving communications with residents on Taiwan,
 in an open invitation to Taiwan suggesting that a
 delegation of athletes be sent to the Third National
 Games in Peking next September.   The invitation
 included a call for "unity of compatriots in Taiwan
 and the rest of the entire Chinese people."
 The Chinese clearly have several objectives
 in mind in their appeals for unity among Chinese on
 both sides of the strait.   In addition to the obvious
 attempt to quiet any fears that Taiwan residents will
 be treated harshly after "liberation," Chinese leaders
 also hope to create apprehension among Taiwan's
 residents about the island's prospects after Chiang.
 Peking has argued that Chiang was the major obstacle
 to accommodation between the two sides and that his
 death will clear the way for better understanding
 between them.

 Moreover, by declaring the fundamental unity
 of all Chinese, Peking may be taking steps to
 make clear its opposition to any options other
 than eventual reunification with the mainland.
 The Chinese appear to be most concerned about
 forestalling any speculation in Taipei about an
 independent Taiwan or the development of some sort
 of relationship with Moscow. Although there is no
 evidence that Taipei is actively considering
 either option, Chinese wariness, especially
 regarding the Soviet angle, surfaced in two recent
 articles in Hong Kong's communist press.
 in early March, Hong Kong's PRC-owned Ta
 Kung Pao published a front-page article that
 warned of Soviet designs on Taiwan and implied that
 some officials in Taipei had toyed with the pos-
 sibility of "changing allies," a move characterized
 as "absurd" by the author.   In mid-March, the
 same newspaper claimed that the Soviets had made
 unspecified moves toward Taipei, but played down
 the possibility of any collusion between the
 Nationalists and the Soviets.   A major factor that
 inhibits Soviet designs on the island,  according
 to the article, is the likelihood that the US would
 not permit the Soviets to step in.   The article
 also dismissed the notion that an independent
 Taiwan is a real possibility, declaring that even
 after President Chiang's death, it will be impos-
 sible to separate Taiwan from the mainland.
 Another feature of Peking's recent statements
 regarding Taiwan should be noted.   In keeping
 with Peking's low-key treatment of the US role in
 Taiwan, little press attention has been paid to
 this potential complication in Peking's efforts to
 enhance communications with Taipei.   In fact, the
 refutation of any possibility that Taipei could
 "change allies" reflects Peking's preference that
 Taipei retain its links with Washington, at least
 for the time being.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 Criticism of Foreign Trade Policies Continues
 China's expansive foreign trade policy has
 drawn sharp criticism in domestic propaganda for
 some time. While honest differences undoubtedly
 exist smong leaders of various ideological hues
 over the role of China's foreign commerce, criti-
 cal comments in the media have been highly polem-
 ical, mainly reflecting the use of the foreign
 trade question for partisan political ends by ele-
 ments of the political left.  A notable criticism
 of over-reliance on foreign resources appeared in
 the national media in August 1973, when the anti-
 Confucian campaign was just getting under way. More-
 over, the linkage between Confucius, Lin Piao, and
 those who advocate "the philosophy of servility to
 things foreign" has been stressed repeatedly.
 As the leader of the broad coalition of mod-
 erate forces and the chief architect of external pol-
 icy, Premier Chou En-lai has been the apparent target
 of many of these propaganda barbs.   An article in the
 January 6 issue of the Peking Kuangming Daily, which
 was only recently received in Washington, continues
 the attack and leaves little doubt that the objective
 is to disparage Chou. The piece assaults Chang Chih-
 tung, described as "the bureaucrat handling foreign
 affairs at the end of the Ching dynasty who worshipped
 things foreign and fawned on foreign powers."
 The article charges that 19th century modern-
 izers, who favored the melding of Western technology
 with traditional Chinese culture, were in effect col-
 luding with reactionary elements at. home and abroad.
 The parallel to what is wrong with current imports of
 Western technology and equipment is obvious, but the
 line of argument seems to have another objective.   A
 number of harsh articles have been published under
 April 14, 1975

 pseudonyms associated with Mao and Chou, branding
 feudal princes and other Confucianists as traitors
 who colluded with foreign enemies, especially the
 Huns--i.e., the USSR.   The targets of the criticism
 were certain regional military commanders and their
 leftist political allies.   The line of attack in
 the Kuanaming Daily article turns the traitor charge
 against the original accusers by drawing the com-
 parison between those who have shaped foreign trade
 policies with historical figures who have sold out
 to foreign revisionists.
 The Kuanaming article does not limit its scope
 to foreign trade matters.   Chang Chih-tung is also
 charged with suppressing the legitimate revolutionary
 struggle of the people under the guise of countering
 the "non-enforcement of rules and regulations and
 the emergence of great disorder in all corners of the
 country"--an obvious jab at Chouist efforts to dampen
 wall poster and other disruptive mass criticism ac-
 tivity.
 The real impact of these propaganda blasts is
 difficult to assess.   China has continued to import
 large quantities of foreign technology and equipment,
 and a growing number of foreign technicians are now
 setting up equipment in China.   Premier Chou may have
 been criticized as the result of China's large trade
 deficit last year--nearly $1 billion--or the Premier
 may have perceived the advantage in a pre-emptive
 move to protect his flank.
 ou's aaaress on
 the work of government to the National People's Con-
 gress included critical remarks against workers and
 cadre who began "to worship things foreign" and began
 to ignore domestically produced equipment and manage-
 ment techniques.   Chou is said to have concluded that
 "we do not oppose foreign assistance," but that the
 most important consideration is to carry out the policy
 of independence and self-reliance.   In any case, the
 trade deficit should narrow somewhat this year.

 Most of the articles that attack current for-
 eign trade policies include the caveat that China
 must never adopt a policy of exclusion or isola-
 tion.   This suggests that real differences among
 leaders or groups on the issue are a matter of de-
 gree. Still, so long as foreign trade policy con-
 tinues to be used as a political weapon, politically
 motivated adjustments in foreign trade remain possi-
 ble, particularly during the succession period.   (SE-

 Washington's postponement of the US tour of
 a Chinese performing arts troupe has had minimal
 impact on Sino-US relations.
 Peking's reaction was as mild and low key as
 possible.   The US decided to shelve the tour on
 the grounds that the troupe planned to use a song
 calling for Taiwan's liberation. The PRC Liaison
 Office, in a statement to the organization spon-
 soring the tour, regretted the US decision, de-
 fended the inclusion of the objectionable song and
 implied that the US was "retreating" from the Shang-
 hai communique. The statement included no further
 criticism and made no mention of Chinese displeasure
 or possible retaliation.
 The Chinese waited almost a week before making
 an official public announcement about the affair
 and then issued a tepid, low level joint statement
 under the aegis of a friendship association and the
 spokesman of a Foreign Ministry department.   The
 statement used much of the same language employed
 earlier by the Liaison Office and also affirmed
 China's intention to promote contacts with the US.
 In charging that the US action contravened the
 spirit of the Shanghai communique, both statements
 misrepresented the US position on Taiwan contained
 in the communique. While the statements said the US
 "agreed" that there is one China and that Taiwan is
 part of it, the Shanghai communique said that all
 Chinese maintain this position and the US government
 "does not challenge" it. The Chinese obviously are
 aware of the language in the communique and probably
 do not in fact regard the US action as incompatible
 with it.

 Peking seems at pains to make its position
 clear in other ways. A few days after the tour was
 postponed, NCNA carried a glowing article on the
 PRC archaeological exhibit in Washington.   The
 Chinese further endorsed continued cultural ex-
 changes with the US in agreeing to permit this ex-
 hibit an additional and unscheduled run in San
 Francisco.
 The postponement of the Chinese troupe's tour
 came up during the visit to Peking of House Speaker
 Albert and Congressman Rhodes early this month. Al-
 though Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua complained
 rather strongly about the US action, he said the
 issue was not too important.   Teng Hsiao-ping told
 the congressmen that such problems probably could
 not be avoided at this stage of Sino-US relations.
 There is every indication, in fact, that Peking
 believes Sino-US relations are on track.   Chiao
 characterized relations to the congressional delega-
 tion as "not bad," and Teng said that Peking has
 "nothing to complain about."   Teng reportedly added
 that the US and PRC should not have unrealistic il-
 lusions about what can be accomplished and that re-
 lations inevitably would develop in zig zags.
 Senior Chinese officials with knowledge of the
 state of play between Washington and Peking have
 consistently indicated since the first of this year
 that China remains patient and recognizes that dis-
 engagement from Taiwan poses difficulties for the
 US.   One went so far as to indicate that China would
 welcome President Ford whether he came empty-handed
 or brought "gifts."
 Along these lines, a PRC-owned newspaper in
 Hong Kong carried a front page article warning of
 Soviet designs on Taiwan.

 US withdrawal from Taiwan was clue, in part, to
 concern in Washington that the Soviets might fill
 the resulting vacuum.   This may be an argument
 used in Peking with those Chinese who might ques-
 tion the pace of US withdrawal from Taiwan, and
 its appearance in the Communist press in Hong Kong
 is another sign of Chinese patience regarding Taiwan.
 Peking also used the Hong Kong Communist press
 recently to signal that it has taken note of US
 plans to withdraw fighter aircraft and airmen from
 Taiwan this spring.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO

 Capabilit  To Produce Oscilloscopes
 China's advance into modern electronics
 technology--large-scale integrated circuits, high-
 speed computers,  lasers, and the like--depends in
 large measure on the availability and sophisti-
 cation of its testing devices.   The oscilloscope
 is one of the most important and versatile units of
 test equipment for electronic research, development,
 and production. It is used to provide a visual
 presentation of the characteristics of various types
 of electronic pulses.
 China produces roughly 20,000 to 25,000 oscil-
 loscopes a year, most of which are used domestically
 in industry, research laboratories, and in military
 field applications. The technical level of these
 instruments is considerably lower than that of the
 US--judging from the characteristics of the 50 or
 so  types of oscilloscopes produced in China, most
 of these appear to be copies of Soviet prototypes.
 China produces both general-purpose and
 sampling oscilloscopes.   A general-purpose oscil-
 loscope presents a real-time display of electronic
 signals across the viewing screen.   Oscilloscopes
 of this type produced in the US have bandwidth
 frequencies up to 600 megahertz  (MHZ), while the
 majority of Chinese general-purpose instruments
 operate at less than 60 MHZ.   Sampling oscillo-
 scopes, with their extremely wide bandwidths and
 fast operating speeds, have wide application in
 testing band-limited components,  sub-assemblies of
 radio frequency transmission systems, and high-
 speed switching circuitry of computers.   While US
 manufacturers produce a variety of sampling
 oscilloscopes with bandwidths up to 18 gigahertz
 (GHZ), Chinese production in this area is still
 at the prototype stage.

 At least 12 electronic plants throughout the
 country manufacture oscilloscopes.   Shanghai Radio
 Plant No. 21, which began producing oscilloscopes
 in 1958,  is the largest,  followed by Tientsin
 Electronic Instrument Plant No. 2.   In 1966, both
 of these plants started producing transistorized
 scopes in addition to the earlier the tube-type
 models.
 A number of new oscilloscope manufacturing
 plants have come into existence since the end of
 the Cultural Revolution in 1969.  A small number
 of oscilloscopes are being manufactured at Peking
 University, presumably for in-house use.   Recent
 reports indicate that these are similar to 1962-
 vintage US instruments, although university officials
 claim that modern electronic components such as
 gallium-arsenide,light-emitting diodes are made at the
 university for use in oscilloscopes.
 China relies heavily on Western suppliers to
 meet its demand for advanced oscilloscopes.  Approxi-
 mately 200 to 300 oscilloscopes have been imported
 annually from the West since the mid-1960s.  Because
 Coordinating Committee  (COCOM)  regulations have set
 technical constraints on the types of oscilloscopes
 that can be exported,  some of China's requirements
 for advanced oscilloscopes remain unfulfilled, par-
 ticularly for use in the research laboratories.

 New Headaches:   The Cho  al's    11
 Indian acquiescence, if not connivance, in
 the abolition of the Sikkimese monarchy makes
 chances of Sino-Indian rapprochement in the near
 term even more remote.          While Chinese criticism
 of what Peking regards as a blatant Indian attempt
 to consolidate power in Sikkim is to be expected,
 Peking's initial reaction has been relatively sharp.
 On April 13, a People's Daily Commentator article
 "strongly" denounced the "ugly features of Indian
 expansionism."   Furthermore, it named Mrs. Gandhi
 as being largely responsible for the "annexation,"
 and went on at some length about what it alleged
 was Moscow's backstage role.
 This language is a few notches stronger than
 Commentator's treatment in March of the new political
 arrangement that New Delhi engineered in Kashmir.
 That article refrained from mentioning Moscow or
 the Prime Minister.   Moreover, the speed with which
 Peking issued the authoritative comment on Sikkim--
 only three days after the event--suggests considerable
 dismay.   In the case of Kashmir, nine days passed
 before Commentator responded.
 In terms of short-run prospects for Sino-Indian
 rapprochement, New Delhi's move in Sikkim does not
 bode well.   The Chinese have long expressed their
 support for the choygal; and last November, NCNA
 aired its apprehension that New Delhi was planning
 to abolish the monarchy.   In the context of such
 warnings and of India's failure to reciprocate China's
 recent signals for better relations, Peking will un-
 doubtedly read New Delhi's latest actions in Sikkim
 as a further sign of disinterest in rapprochement.

 For the next couple of months, at least, China
 will probably suspend efforts to improve relations
 and will grow more vocal with its public, if not
 its private, anti-Indian themes.   In doing so, Peking
 would seek to tell the Indians not to mistake ges-
 tures of friendship for lack of resolve to maintain
 the status quo in South Asia, and at the same time
 reassure Pakistan and the other Himalayan buffer states
 of its support.
 On a more fundamental level, India's failure to
 respond to recent Chinese initiatives, the abolition
 of the Sikkimese monarchy, and the visit to New Delhi
 of Soviet Defense Minister Grechko in February will
 almost certainly raise new doubts in Peking about
 Indian intentions on.the subcontinent.   Indeed, the
 inclusion in the April 13 Commentator article of an
 entire paragraph on the Soviet Union seems clearly
 related to China's concern over the results of Grechko's
 visit.
 There are some signs, however, that the Chinese
 still hold out hope for Sino-Indian rapprochement.
 The April 13 Commentator article, for example, did
 not return to the harsh language used when New Delhi
 changed the status of Sikkim to an "associate state"
 last September.   At that time, Peking mentioned India's
 new-found nuclear muscle and dwelled on its expansion-
 ist ambitions in South Asia.   This time, such talk was
 absent, although these thoughts are clearly on the
 minds of Chinese policy-makers.   (SECRET)

 The prestige of the People's Liberation Army,
 which reached its zenith during the Lin Piao era,
 was severely tarnished by his disgraceful fall.
 Nevertheless, the armed forces remained an important
 avenue to party membership, a good civilian job and,
 for many demobilized soldiers, an urban rather than
 a rural habitat.   Now, however, there is a campaign
 in progress to send ex-soldiers to the countryside.
 Articles have appeared in domestic propaganda
 in recent weeks lauding demobilized soldiers who
 have advanced the socialist cause by electing to
 take jobs in rural areas.   The broadcasts stress
 that the arrangements are permanent, and the message
 is obviously intended to influence the mass of
 recently demobilized soldiers to make a similar
 choice.
 According to recent reports,  the government
 has decided to pare a million men from the armed
 forces.   Such a move could further reduce the
 political power of regional military men and would
 certainly cut military expenditures.   The reports
 cannot be confirmed, but the current propaganda
 concerning demobilized soldiers is consistent with
 such a plan.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 An NCNA article late last month criticized a
 UK "white paper" on defense policy which called
 for cuts in London's defense budget.   NCNA ques-
 tioned the policy in light of the expansion of So-
 viet military. strength, and the Chinese account
 claimed that the cuts have caused serious concern
 among the UK's NATO Allies.
 At the same time NCNA carried an article crit-
 ical of the Labor Party's stand on continued member-
 ship in the Common Market comparing this position
 unfavorably to the Conservative Party's more positive
 policy.   In its account of Parliament's vote last
 week for continued membership, NCNA mentioned that a
 number of Labor Party members favored British with-
 drawal.
 In contrast, the Chinese press recently has
 carried several favorable accounts of plans in the
 US, West Germany, and Austria to increase defense
 spending--which NCNA attributes in large part to the
 Soviet threat--and an article on French President
 Giscard's recent public call for increased European
 solidarity.
 Peking has tilted somewhat toward some of
 Europe's more conservative political parties in the
 past but rarely has leveled such criticism at the
 policies of a Western government with which the Chi-
 nese have enjoyed good relations.   China's displeas-
 ure                           with these British policies has not, however,
 been reflected in other areas of the UK-PRC relation-
 ship.   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM)
