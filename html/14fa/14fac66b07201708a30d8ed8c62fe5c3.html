 China: Political Agenda for the New Leadership
 Summary
 China's leaders face  formidable political tasks after the dismissal of
 Hu Yaobang.  Deng Xiaoping and Premier Zhao Ziyang, who is now the
 Acting General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, will be the
 most prominent decisionmakers in the coming year, but competition for
 influence among various groups will be intense as China prepares for a
 party congress in October.  We believe their first task will be sorting out
 new power relationships.  Zhao will be working to consolidate his control
 of the party at the same time that party traditionalists, emboldened by
 recent events, try to reassert dominance.  Deng's role will be pivotal, but
 we have few indications of his plans or of the extent to which his and
 Zhao's agendas may differ.
 Three important decisions confront the leadership: the choice of a
 new premier, how to build new succession arrangements, and how to
 handle Hu Yaobang's numerous supporters in the party and government.
 This memorandum was prepared by               Office of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 24 February 1987 was used in its preparation.  Comments
 and queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Political Assessments
 Branch, China Division, OEA

 Following practice, Deng probably will  put tough policy choices aside
 while he works out personnel issues, and he may also cede the
 conservative wing some ground until he is satisfied with personnel
 arrangements.
 We believe the most pressing policy concern of the leadership,
 especially of Zhao, will be to protect economic reforms already in practice.
 Major initiatives probably will be postponed until the political situation is
 less turbulent.  Another concern is political reform, which we believe will
 be confined mainly to attempts to improve bureaucratic efficiency.  In
 foreign policy, the leadership has demonstrated that it places a high
 priority on reassuring foreign countries that basic policies will not change
 as a result of Hu's fall.  Finally, Beijing has to rebuild confidence in party
 stability and in the longevity of reform policies.
 Sorting Out the Power Relationships
 regain lost influence and restrain the reforms.
 The dismissal of Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang and the selection of
 Premier Zhao Ziyang to replace him 1 will entail working out new relationships in both
 party and government circles, particularly given the tense circumstances under which
 the changes took place.  We believe party traditionalists see Hu's downfall and the
 attendant realignments in the party hierarchy as an opportunity--perhaps their last--to
 well as their ability to constrain Deng's choices
 We do not know what role Deng Xiaoping will play in working out the new
 arrangements, or what his strategy will be, although we believe Deng remains the top
 power broker and arbiter.  Deng may have incurred debts in calling on the
 conservatives 2 of the Politburo and Central Advisory Commission to support his move
 against Hu.  Deng thus may have to make concessions and depend on coalitions and
 dealmaking to a greater extent than he did six months ago.  We do not believe that the
 traditionalists can force their preferences on Deng, but their influence may be greater, as
 Another unknown is the degree to which Zhao's agenda may differ from Deng's.
 We believe that, even if Zhao's opinions diverge from Deng's, during the next few
 months Zhao will be careful to mute these differences and avoid disputes.  Not only is
 October, may make more strenuous efforts to continue to act in concert.
 For the purposes of this paper we have treated the conservatives as a unified interest
 group, but it actually is an alliance of several disparate groups--ideologues,
 conservative economists, and some military leaders.  In the past, such coalitions have
 proved fragile.  However, it is possible that the various conservative groups, having
 suffered for their lack of cohesion and facing the deadline of the 13th Congress in

 Zhao's political style less confrontational than Hu's, the recent example of Hu's dismissal
 makes clear the risks of challenging Deng.
 However, over the next year as the succession issue becomes more urgent,
 differences between Deng and Zhao may surtace as Zhao begins moving to establish his
 post-Deng leadership lineup.  Moreover, because Zhao seems positioned to become the
 successor to Deng's position of preeminence, Deng may over time become increasingly
 suspicious.  We lack direct evidence, but some                   have speculated
 25X1
 that Deng, like many aging authoritarian leaders, will feel increasingly challenged as
 Zhao begins to assert his authority independently.
 25X1
 The most visible indicator of the strength of competing forces will be the
 designation of a new premier.  We expect this decision to be made within the next eight
 months before the party congress, although it possibly will not be announced until then.
 However, some evidence suggests the leadership, wishing to avoid further controversy
 following Hu's dismissal, may wait until 1988.  To gain time to strengthen his own
 choice--Tian Jiyun--Zhao himself may wish to delay the decision, although there are
 costs to holding both top jobs.  Because he will have the top political and economic
 slots, he will be vulnerable to criticism from rivals or opponents of reform.  In addition,
 combining top party and government authority in one man runs counter to Deng's goal
 of separating party and government functions.
 We can identify five candidates to succeed Zhao:3
 ?   Wan Li, 71.  Wan is the senior vice premier.  He is a reform advocate, especially
 in economic areas, and was one of the architects of the successful agricultural
 reforms of the early 1980s.  He is also respected by most conservatives and
 apparently has made few enemies.  He would be a good compromise choice, but
 we believe Deng would still prefer some one younger who could be counted on
 to carry reforms forward.
 ?   Li Peng, 59.  Vice Premier Li is probably the most conservative of the candidates.
 Because of Li's Soviet training and preference for central planning, we believe
 Zhao, a strong proponent of introducing market forces, opposes Li's elevation.
 His selection ,therefore, would signal not only that Zhao lacks authority to
 enforce his preferences, but that the conservative wing has considerable clout.
 ?   Tian Jiyun, 57.  Vice Premier Tian is a Zhao protege and well-known as an ardent
 champion of reform.  He is a finance specialist, but currently has overall
 responsibility for managing the economy.  We believe Tian is Zhao's first choice,

 political acumen and leadership qualities.

 ?   Qiao Shi, 62.  Qiao, the junior vice premier, also represents a compromise choice.
 Although he has close ties to Hu, he has been careful to cultivate conservatives
 as well.  Qiao, whose responsibilites include the legal and security portfolios,
 won him the respect--and gratitude--of many leaders.  Qiao lacks
 economic experience; if he gets the job, we expect that either Zhao, from his
 party seat, or one of the vice premiers, would continue to be the chief executor
 of economic policy.
 ?   Li Ruihuan, 53.  Li Ruihuan (no relation to Li Peng) is mayor of Tianjin.  He has
 recently emerged as a rumored candidate for the premiership.  Li has a good
 record as city administrator and has won Deng's kudos for his firm handling of
 student protests in his city, according to Japanese press reports.  However, Li
 may encounter resistance because of his weak educational background--Li was a
 carpenter who first rose to prominence as a labor leader and "model worker."  Li
 is close to both Zhao and Hu, but we have little information on his political
 leanings.  If he is chosen, we believe it would be because each of the other
 candidates is unacceptable to one of the key players, and that none of them has
 won Deng's strong support.

 accept.
 There are other personnel choices demanding attention as well--the Politburo
 Standing Committee currently has only two functioning members" and will have to be
 reconstituted, and Deng will probably make some moves on the party Military Affairs
 Commission (MAC) soon.  The appointment of a new MAC chairman or new members
 will be especially sensitive; a variety of evidence indicates that the MAC's refusal to
 accept Hu Yaobang--Deng's choice--as chairman contributed to Hu's fall.  Deng may
 find his options in this area especially limited by what military elders are willing to
 These decisions, we believe,  will be the focus of political contention for the next
 several months leading up to the party congress.  Although he has connections to Yang
 Shangkun, the powerful MAC permanent vice chairman, Zhao has few other military ties
 and the choice of a new MAC chairman--or at least the appointment of a probable
 successor--will be especially important.  Zhao will need a trustworthy man for that job
 Of the five members of the Standing Committee, we believe only Zhao and Deng are
 fully active.  After his disgrace, Hu Yaobang is probably no longer a participant in the
 committee's decisions.  Chen Yun is                      not active except
 on extraordinary occasions.  President Li Xiannian appears to have withdrawn from
 activity--he has been out of Beijing for several months--for reasons that are not
 clear.

 to help him manage the military if he wishes to succeed Deng.  Although the choice of
 anew MAC chairman is one issue on which Deng and Zhao could conceivably
 diverge--because many of Deng's close military allies have no ties to Zhao and may
 consider themselves his equal in seniority and prestige--we believe Zhao is unlikely to
 challenge Deng on this issue.  Zhao can probably work with any of Deng's likely choices.
 A somewhat different kind of personnel problem involves handling Hu Yaobang's
 supporters in the party and government.  Hu was very successful at placing his people
 throughout the bureaucracy--in fact, one of the charges against him was that he
 monopolized patronage, according to a US Embassy source.  Many of these appointees
 will be willing to switch allegiance, and some are now running for cover.  However, we
 believe that there remains a sizable group of disaffected followers of Hu that could
 obstruct Zhao's consolidation of power and possibly even Deng's plans.  In addition,
 because of their numbers and expertise, they are necessary to implementation of reform
 policy.  Accordingly, Zhao will have to find a way to make at least a temporary
 accommodation with them.  In his New Year's speech, Zhao suggested that he was
 willing to welcome those who would renounce their Hu-ist errors and join him.
 Complicating his task is the likelihood that many of Hu's proteges are now on
 conservative hit lists.  Reformist leaders, especially Zhao and Deng, will need to decide
 whom to protect and what cost they are willing to incur in doing so.  A test of Zhao's
 influence, and of the degree of conservative resurgence, will be the extent of purges of
 reformist officials who would probably support Zhao but are tainted by associations with
 Hu Yaobang.                           conservatives have moved to displace a
 number of Hu appointees in several areas, including propaganda, personnel, and
 international party liaison offices.  Deng's role will be critical on this issue, in our view.
 The depth of his debt to the conservatives will be indicated in part by how much of a
 purge he permits.  Struggles over this issue may also disclose whether Hu's supporters
 are trying, out of loyalty or desperation, to mount any counterattack.
 A major casualty of the last three months was Deng's attempt to craft his
 succession.  We believe this had already begun to unravel, but Hu's ouster means all
 aspects of the succession are unresolved; virtually all the top posts--including the
 general secretaryship, in our judgment--are now up for grabs.  If, as we believe, a major
 sticking point for Deng's plans was that he could not ease Hu out of the general
 secretaryship and over to the MAC chairmanship, he may in one sense have simplified
 his succession problems; but in our view the new complications outweigh the possible
 gains.
 Although Deng, who is 82, has frequently stressed having a succession
 generation in place before he dies, it is not clear whether he can put together a
 succession package.  His original plan, we believe, was to skip a generation and install
 men in their 50s, reserving a kind of elder statesman role for those in their late 60s and
 70s--which includes both Hu and Zhao.  Deng was disappointed by his earlier picks and

 may now decide to back Zhao and other leaders of his age as his immediate successors,
 letting them choose the next Generation.  Or he may decide to stay on indefinitely and
 not set up a succession.
 On balance, we believe Deng will make his own choices and have his
 arrangements in place before he is gone.  We doubt that Deng will retire.  In our
 judgment, he will probably stay but try to position his chosen heirs to take over when
 he dies.  If we are correct, tension between the apparent successors and Deng and
 other elders will persist.
 Zhao may well have his own agenda for the succession.  He now holds what is
 formally the top job in China, and will probably be working to consolidate his position as
 Deng's successor as the top leader in fact as well as name.  However, Hu's dismissal
 has cast doubt on the permanence of any succession arrangement brokered by Deng,
 and we believe that over the long term Zhao will face challenges from conservatives and
 reformers alike.  His position as the apparent choice of Deng gives him advantages, of
 course, but also sets him up as a target.  Zhao's immediate task is to establish his
 authority working under Deng's aegis, but, given Deng's age, he must also soon begin to
 build his own power bases--which may lead him into the same troubles Hu
 encountered.
 The issue of "political structural reform," a vaguely defined set of changes in the
 political and legal spheres, was a principal point of contention between Deng and Hu,
 and between conservatives and reform activists.  Deng, we believe, inaugurated a drive
 to promote political reform in the spring of 1986, but probably had much more modest
 changes in mind than students and intellectuals began pushing for in the fall.  Deng and
 Zhao now face the decision of how to carry on this campaign.  Zhao has given hints of
 the new line in a speech in which he declared that political reform was still on the
 agenda but stressed that such reform has narrow limits.
 In our judgment, the broad program of reforms discussed in the press last spring.
 and summers is on hold indefinitely.  Political reform under the new regime will
 probably be confined to efforts to improve the quality of party and government cadre
 and to cutting administrative redtape.  Measures to reduce the party's role in day-to-day
 economic and administrative decisionmaking, originally a key part of the reforms, will
 probably still be proposed, but, we believe, will be harder to implement now.  Official
 press stories indicate that the leadership intends to go forward with reforms to make
 local elections somewhat freer by permitting more candidates than there are seats, but
 any other moves toward democratization seem unlikely.  Without a clear return to
 reformist policies by the leadership, these efforts will meet with only partial success, in
 s  A number of articles during the spring and summer of 1986 called for radical changes
 in the political structure.  Among the proposals were calls for free elections even for
 national leaders, for a true multiparty system; some articles even implied that
 Marxism was no longer an appropriate ideology for China.

 our judgment.  Party authority is clearly ascendant now, and it will be a rare official or
 manager who will challenge the local party hierarchy.
 The official media continues to extol democracy--in his New Year's speech, Zhao
 said that "socialist democracy" was still agoal--but the emphasis now is on setting
 clearer limits.  We believe that one item for Zhao will be establishing the limits of
 permissible discussion of democracy while trying to convince the Chinese that there has
 been no policy reversal.
 Protecting the Economic Reform Program
 A key goal for both Deng and Zhao, we believe, will be saving the economic
 reforms already made.  A growing conservative trend in economic policy is evident.
 Self-reliance, a shibboleth of the Maoist years, has surfaced again in the propaganda;
 political study sessions are being stepped up in factories and other workplaces.  Price
 reforms slated for 1987 have been deferred, and even in agriculture, a reformist success
 story, there are signs of conservative resurgence.  Many of these trends have roots in
 economic difficulties as well as in political infighting, and predate Hu's dismissal, but
 they add up to greater conservative influence on economic policy than we have seen for
 several years.  Certainly Chinese at middle and lower levels will see the policy changes
 Zhao and other reformers are aware of the risks to the economic reforms, we
 believe, and have undertaken a damage limitation campaign.  So far, their efforts appear
 to have been confined largely to speeches and articles, although the US Consulate in
 Shanghai reported evidence suggesting that Zhao has protected the staff of the
 Shanghai-based reformist journal World Economic Herald.  Reformers may try to
 announce some new initiative, even if it is largely symbolic, to demonstrate that their
 program is alive.  The recent announcement of regulations for factory management may
 have been intended in part to do this, though the regulations were drawn up and
 implementation was begun last year.
 Reform  leaders appear to have put reassuring foreign investors near the top of
 their agenda.  Announcements that nothing would change for investors appeared within
 a few days of Hu's resignation.  These protestations indicate that the leaders know fears
 of renewed instability might discourage some foreign investors.  However, they may not
 be sufficiently aware of the more subtle threats; China is already a marginal investment
 prospect for many foreign businessmen, and renewed conservative strength would
 exacerbate that problem.  Fear of innovation, unwillingness of factory managers to make
 decisions, the necessity to consult party committees at every turn, and time lost to
 political study sessions are all possible consequences that could further discourage
 investment.  In our view, Zhao needs to send a strong signal that these risks have not
 been heightened.

 Restoring Confidence
 A crucial item on the political agenda will be to restore confidence in party
 stability and in the longevity of reform policies.  Beyond the fact that Hu and his policies
 were popular with important segments of the population, the abrupt circumstances of
 his dismissal have awakened in many Chinese fears of instability, factionalism, and
 capricious policy reversal.
 Not surprisingly, intellectuals--including college students--are particularly
 disheartened, according to a variety of evidence.  We believe that Zhao and Deng agree
 that China needs the support of intellectuals in its modernization efforts, although Zhao
 may be willing to tolerate somewhat more diversity of opinion than Deng in order to
 encourage needed innovation.  The leadership clearly perceives that it has lost ground
 with intellectuals.  Moreover, Deng and Zhao seem to be acting firmly to prevent
 anti-intellectualism from getting out of hand as it did in the 1983 "spiritual pollution"
 campaign against Western influences.  According to press information, Zhao has directed
 that only Beijing can approve the criticism by name of any intellectual, and that erring
 intellectuals should be educated, not attacked.  We expect, however, that these attempts
 will do little to counter disillusionment among intellectuals in the renewed atmosphere
 of repression and rigidity.
 Effects on Foreign Policy
 We believe foreign policy played a secondary role in Hu's sacking, and doubt that
 it will be much affected in the short term.  The Chinese leadership has given priority to
 reassuring the West and especially the United States that Beijing's policies will not
 change. Indeed, press reports and other accounts have claimed that one reason Hu was
 dropped was that he was pro-Soviet--one of Zhao's secretaries made this claim to a US
 diplomat the day of Hu's resignation.  In our judgment, these claims represent efforts to
 deflect foreign concerns about Hu's dismissal and convince the United States and others
 that Hu was a threat to the open door policy.
 Over the longer term, relations with the West might suffer if Zhao and other
 reformers are unable to limit conservative influence.  Many of those associated with Hu
 were among the most active proponents of better relations with the West, whereas the
 conservative camp has many who believe China should pursue either a middle course
 between the West and the Soviet Bloc or try to go it alone--"self-reliance."  A key
 indicator of trends in this area will be the makeup of the Politburo and Central
 Committee after the 13th Party Congress.  We believe that as long as Deng is active
 China is unlikely to draw much closer to the Soviets, but power alignments established
 at the congress will affect what happens when Deng is gone.

 Greater conservative influence implies greater tolerance for anti-Western ideas
 and a touting of the virtues of "Chineseness."  These themes have appeared prominently
 in the press since December.
 We expect the coming year to be politically tense, with the 13th Party Congress
 in October the focal point of attempts by all sides to influence personnel choices.  The
 reformist coalition, under strain before Hu's resignation, will be even more severely
 tested.  Splits between more moderate reformers willing to compromise with the
 conservative wing and the generally younger, more activist reformers may develop.
 Moreover, we believe there will be considerable competition within the reform camp for
 the seats on the top party bodies, possibly fueling tensions between former Hu
 associates and others, and complicating Zhao's task of holding the coalition together.
 It is also likely, in our judgment, that the traditionalists within the leadership will
 mount a strong effort to advance their position at the congress--assuming that the
 conservative coalition stays together.  It is possible that new power relationships may
 not be worked out and the congress may turn out to be a nonevent, with few real
 changes being made in the top policy bodies and the period of infighting prolonged.
 We do not know what Deng's own plans for the congress are.  Moreover, he may
 be limited by his ability to juggle the many decisions competing for his attention.  In
 recent years, Deng has seemed to have trouble making decisions when faced with
 several problems at once and occasionally has made decisions that, we believe, he has
 later regretted.  An example would be the 1983 spiritual pollution campaign.
 Deng halted the campaign when he realized that
 many party cadre had far exceeded his intentions and that the campaign was
 threatening his economic program.
 Faced with both personnel and policy questions, as he is now, Deng has generally
 preferred to settle personnel issues first and defer policy decisions.  Under the present
 circumstances, he may prefer to cede some ground to the conservatives--for instance,
 in the propaganda field--while he maneuvers to place his choices in key spots.  Thus,
 events at the congress will probably provide important pointers to Deng's intentions on
 the succession.  His personnel choices should also provide clues to his policy plans.

 As for Zhao, he may have different personnel preferences from Deng's.  But we
 doubt that he would be willing to challenge Deng at this stage, even if the differences
 are significant.  As he has in the past, he would probably seek to put people
 sympathetic to his policies in secondary positions as vacancies occur, possibly also
 create some new organizations staffed with his supporters, and wait for a later
 opportunity to make top-level appointments.
