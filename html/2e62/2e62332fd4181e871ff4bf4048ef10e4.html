 New Assignment
 The Senate Intelligence Committee con-
 tinues to make a charade of CIA "over-
 sight" by such actions as the recent ap-
 pointment of 38-year-old Robert Ruhl
 Simmons to be staff director. According to
 government-released information, Simmons
 is a 10-year veteran of the CIA's opera-
 tions directorate - "dirty tricks" -
 which he joined after serving with Army
 intelligence in Vietnam (1965-68).
 Simmons has been serving on the intelli-
 gence committee staff as the representa-
 tive of conservative Senator John H.
 Chafee.   He is replacing John F. Blake, a
 32-year CIA veteran and former president
 of the Association of Former Intelligence
 Officers who left "to take advantage of a
 forthcoming opportunity," according to
 committee chairperson, Senator  Barry
 Goldwater.
 Exotic Languages
 In October, a House post-secondary edu-
 cation committee unanimously approved an
 $87 million-a-year program to encourage
 the teaching of foreign languages in
 schools and colleges. This action does not
 signal a sudden Congressional interest in
 promoting understanding between the U.S.
 and citizens of other countries. According
 to committee chairperson, Paul Simon (D.-
 Ill.), the program is intended to enhance
 the capabilities of the defense department
 and intelligence agencies and improve the
 U.S.'s position in international trade.
 Simon said he expects to win approval for
 the bill by focusing on its potential to
 aid national security. "Where there is a
 national need, we have to meet it," he
 said in a Washington Post (10/10/81) in-
 terview.
 CIA Deputy Director Bobby Inman testi-
 fied in a July subcommittee hearing, even
 though the CIA is prohibited from promot-
 ing legislation. Inman bemoaned that  the

 language capability was having an "adverse
 impact" on intelligence. "We are especial-
 ly vulnerable when it comes to the more
 exotic languages, such as Urdu, Arabic and
 Farsi." These three languages are spoken
 in areas of the world where the CIA,  the
 Pentagon and the multinational corpora-
 tions are facing increasing resistance to
 their penetration, manipulation and ex-
 ploitation.
 Casey's Sudan Emergency
 Some eight years ago, CIA Director
 William Casey's brother-in-law was killed
 in a bizarre accident involving a riding
 lawn mower owned by Casey. The brother-in-
 law's family filed a damage suit for al-
 leged negligent maintenance of the lawn
 mower. Eight years later, they were having
 difficulty getting Casey to court. On Oc-
 tober 20, 1981, Casey was scheduled to ap-
 pear for trial. A few days before, Casey's
 lawyer Robert C. Minion told Judge Howard
 E. Levitt that Casey had to be in London
 on October 20 to direct the CIA response
 to the "Sudan emergency." On October 20,
 CIA spokesperson Dale Peterson said: "He's
 still here." (Washington Post, 10/26/81),
 Asked if Minion had told the judge October
 20, Peterson added: "That may not be ex-
 actly accurate, but it's pretty close."
 Actually, Casey was scheduled to be in
 London on October 23, to address a frater-
 nal organization of special forces sol-
 diers.
 Aid for Terrorists
 In spite of repeated attempts at unif i-
 cation, the Afghan "rebel" groups are  as
 divided as ever. Infighting was pushed to
 a new peak recently  by  Sayed Ahmad
 Gailani, the head of the "National Islamic
 Front of Afghanistan." Gailani confirmed
 statements made by the Afghan government,
 when he told a press conference in London,
 England in early November 1981 that it is
 "incomprehensible and unforgiveable" that
 the West is aiding certain rebel groups
 who are "terrorizing the Afghan popula-
 tion." Gailani, who likes to style himself
 as a moderate and who is asking for West-
 ern aid himself, singled out Gulbuddin
 Hekmatyar's Islamic Party which has "shot
 villagers who had refused to pay them
 taxes, and sometimes burnt down villages
 which supported other resistance groups."
 Hekmatyar received U.S. and Pakistani sup-
 port as early as 1973 when Pakistan clan-
 destinely trained some 5,000 Afghan "reb-
 els" to destabilize the government of
 Muhammad  Daoud.  (For a detailed descrip-
 tion of the various rebel groups, see
 Mohammed Sarkash, Seamus O'Faolain, "Af-
 ghanistan: Foreign Intervention and the
 Prospects for Peace," CounterSpy, vol.5,
 no.3, pp.24-33).
 Amnesty Faults FBI
 On October 13, 1981, Amnesty Interna-
 tional (AI), after studying thousands  of
 pages of official transcripts and docu-
 ments, called on the U.S. government to
 set up an independent commission of inqui-
 ry into the influence of the FBI on the
 criminal justice system. "Amnesty Interna-
 tional," the 144-page report says, "does
 not have any views about the need for any
 particular domestic intelligence investi-
 gation, but it wonders what conclusion
 should be drawn when a federal government
 agency [the FBI) conducts such an investi-
 gation and at the same time appears will-
 ing to fabricate evidence against its
 'targets' and to withhold information
 which, according to law, should have been
 disclosed."
 Entitled, Proposal for a Commission of
 Inquiry into the Effect of Domestic Intel-
 ligence Activities on Criminal Trials in
 the United States of America, the report
 does not comment on juries' decisions or
 call for the automatic acquittal of de-
 fendants in cases involving FBI miscon-
 duct. "But," says AI, "there comes a point
 when the number or type of measures taken
 against members of a political group sug-
 gest that it may be impossible to decide
 whether a particular case has been affect-
 ed by law enforcement misconduct without
 the conducting of a comprehensive inquiry
 into. whether or not the individual mea-
 sures form part of a pattern."
 Commenting on the FBI's COINTELPRO ab-
 uses - which, AI charges, continued long
 after the program's official termination -
 the report says that: "Undoubtedly there
 is a clear distinction between the 'chill-

 the Cambodian Communists [apparently the
 Pol Pot forces fighting in Cambodia  with
 Chinese aid]. What company is the depart-
 ment keeping? With what certainty can it
 assure the public that its samples are
 genuine?"
 The Times pointed out other State De-
 partment inconsistencies. "It told a Sen-
 ate committee that the symptoms caused by
 trichothecenes in animals match perfectly
 those reported by the victims of yellow
 rain. But they apparently do not. The  de-
 partment has said yellow rain is so named
 because it patters on rooftops; yet it
 does not explain how particles large
 enough to patter are also small enough  to
 breathe." Not surprisingly, the Times
 urged a continuing investigation but con-
 cluded that statements such as, "We now
 have the smoking gun," are inappropriate.
 "Jumping the gun is more like it." (11/17/
 81).
 The yellow rain issue is also being ex-
 amined by a United Nations panel of four
 experts from Egypt, Peru, Kenya and the
 Philippines - all close U.S. allies. The
 panel submitted its report in late Novem-
 ber 1981 saying that "there was no conclu-
 sive evidence to support United States
 charges that Soviet-made chemical and bio-
 logical weapons had been used in Laos,
 Cambodia and Afghanistan." (Charges of So-
 viet use of chemical weapons in Afghani-
 stan date back to the Carter administra-
 tion; see "Chemical Warfare in Afghani-
 stan," Counterspy, vol.5 no.1, pp.17-22).
 Nevertheless, the U.N. General Assembly
 voted on December 9 that the panel should
 continue its investigation.
 Ironically, the biological and chemical
 warfare propaganda campaign was launched
 by General Haig.   The same  Haig was
 serving in the U.S. Army in Southeast Asia
 in the 1960s when the U.S. was dumping
 close to 100,000 tons of chemicals such as
 Agent Orange, on Vietnam - the only docu-
 mented use of chemical warfare in South-
 east Asia. Even before that, there was an-
 other disturbing chapter in Haig's career,
 linked to biological and chemical warfare.
 After graduating from West Point in 1947,
 Haig was assigned administrative assistant
 and aide to General Douglas MacArthur in
 Japan. MacArthur's staff at the time was
 involved in what probably is history's
 biggest cover-up of biological and chemi-
 cal warfare atrocities. The Japanese army,
 under Lt. Gen. Ishii Shiro, had developed
 a vast arsenal of chemical and biological
 weapons - and actually used them against
 China and the Soviet Union. Knowledge
 about the way these weapons worked was ob-
 tained from human experiments. Some of
 Ishii's victims, who were killed in the
 experiments, were U.S. POWs.
 The Soviet Union demanded that Ishii be
 brought to trial for his war crimes.
 MacArthur and his staff stalled. Ishii had
 told them he would work with the U.S.,
 further developing his chemical and bio-
 logical weapons, in exchange for immunity.
 A memo prepared for the State Department
 in 1947 argued that "the value to U.S. of
 Japanese BW [Biological Weapons] data is
 of such importance to national security
 as to far outweigh the value accruing from
 war crimes prosecution." Another memo  by
 Dr. Edwin Hill of Camp Detrick, Maryland
 praised the Japanese research and stated
 that their "information could not be ob-
 tained in our own laboratories because of
 scruples  attached to human experimenta-
 tion."
 Ishii Shiro never went to trial. His
 scientific data on biological and chemical
 warfare - considered to be "extremely
 valuable" military information - was sent
 to Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army's center
 for biological warfare. The Japanese and
 the U.S. governments, including General
 Haig, have covered up this incident since
 World War II.  (For a detailed description
 of this cover-up, and subsequent U.S. bio-
 logical and chemical warfare efforts, see
 John W. Powell, "Japan's Germ Warfare: The
 U.S. Cover-up of a War Crime," Bulletin of
 Concerned Asian Scholars, vol.12, no.4,
 1980, pp.2-17.)           - by Konrad Ege -
 Closer to Censorship
 Less than four hours before the Senate
 packed up for its long holiday recess at
 10:30 pm on December 16, the so-called In-
 telligence Identities Protection Act  was
 brought to the floor.   It was only stopped
 when several Senators thteatened to fili-
 buster, urging that the bill be considered
 at greater length in the second session
 beginning January 25, 1982. Reproduced be-
 low is HR4, the version of the Act already
 passed by the House of Representatives on
 September 23, 1981. The Senate version is
 very similar.

 There, are very strong indications that
 in the case of Cuba the war of words has
 already been transformed into a secret ac-
 tual war with biological warfare opera-
 tions against Cuba.  (See "U.S. Biological
 Warfare Against Cuba," CounterSpy, vol.6,

 number of options to be used against Cuba,
 including large naval exercises, obstruc-

 complete blockade of Cuba (an act of war),
 as well as "an invasion by American and
 possibly Latin American forces." According
 to   a New York Times article, several
 Latin American countries have been con-
 tacted "at high levels in government and
 the military and asked if they might join
 in any kind of military operations."
 The Reagan administration's campaign
 against Nicaragua, with General Haig in
 the forefront, has been especially vola-
 tile. In a November 12 Congressional hear-
 ing, Haig explicitly refused to rule out
 the use of U.S. military force to defeat
 the Nicaraguan revolution.  Already, in
 violation of U.S. neutrality laws (even
 according to the State Department), Nica-
 raguan exiles are training in Florida for
 a possible invasion of Nicaragua, and the
 Reagan administration is doing its best to
 destabilize the country economically.
 Haig's comments led Rep. Michael Barnes
 (D-Md.) to say: "Based on your responses,
 if I were a Nicaraguan, I'd be'building
 my bomb shelter." The Nicaraguans are not
 building bomb shelters; instead they are
 building up a large army and peoples' mi-
 litia, actions which Haig calls signs of
 Nicaraguan aggression. Reportedly, the .
 Reagan administration is considering a na-
 val blockade of Nicaragua, allegedly to
 stop the flow of arms to the FMLN in  El
 Salvador. Salvadoran Defense Minister Jose

 selves to blame for the latest series of
 attacks by senior members of the Reagan
 administration.... The list also includes
 the repeated closing of the opposition
 newspaper, La Prensa; the jailing of four
 prominent businessmen...; the banning from
 radio and television of sermons by...
 Archbishop Obando y Bravo; and the curbs
 placed on the Free Labor Movement." Cor-
 rectly, the Times added, "the fact that
 Sandinist police have also been rounding
 up members of the Nicaraguan Communist
 Party at the same time as arresting busi-
 nessmen is not mentioned ...... 4 The article
 fails to note that U.S. pressures on Nica-
 ragua and the danger of foreign subversion
 have forced these actions.
 THE ENDERS PROPOSAL
 Still, Thomas Enders, in charge of Latin
 American affairs at the State Department
 made a set of proposals to Nicaragua in
 August as a basis for better relations.
 The U.S. offered to enter into a non-ag-
 gression pact and to assure "control over
 Nicaraguan exile groups in Florida" in re-
 turn for "a change in the Sandinist re-
 gime's behavior and orientation."5(Enders'
 proposal is remarkable given the adminis-
 tration's public position that it had no
 jurisdiction over the exile training
 camps.) The Nicaraguans responded by uni-
 laterally vowing not to attack the U.S.,6
 but this was not enough for Washington.
 The Reagan administration reserved the
 right to attack Nicaragua and to loosen
 the reins on Nicaraguan exiles unless the
 government's "behavior and orientation"
 changed.?
 Planning for an invasion of Nicaragua -
 it least a violation of the U.S. Neutrali-
 :y Act - is quite public at a Nicaraguan
 axile camp called Campamento Libertad near
 [iami, for example. Hector Fabian, the
 ,ublic information officer at the camp,
 tated: "You could say these camps have
 een one of the biggest helps given the
 icaraguans now fighting for their coun-
 ry. They've prepared here, they've train-
 d here and now they've gone on to fight
 rom third countries and also from Nicara-
 gua." Moreover, several Americans, "whom
 Fabian later identified as former Green
 Berets, were assisting in the training."8
 Washington Post writer Don Oberdorfer
 reported that the Nicaraguan leadership
 took the U.S. pledge to "vigorously en-
 force" its neutrality laws in relation to
 these camps as "a dud." From the Nicara-
 guan point of view, the U.S. " was merely
 promising to do what it should be doing
 already - enforce its law to stop the
 paramilitary training of exile groups....
 Earlier in the year, Managua had com-
 plained about the exiles and received a
 cable from Haig citing some of the same
 U.S. laws. But nothing was done about  the
 exiles."
 According to the Boston Globe, among the
 actions against Nicaragua approved by the
 NSC was a plan to intensify "public rela-
 tions efforts at home and abroad  to pro-
 vide hitherto classified details on what
 the Soviets, Cubans and Nicaraguans are
 doing in Central America to create a cli-
 mate of opinion in which stern action
 might be supported." U.S. intelligence re-
 ports of the extension of three Nicaraguan
 airfield runways, of the training of pi-
 lots in Bulgaria, of upcoming shipments of
 24 MIGs from Cuba and the creation of a
 50,000-person military and a 200,000 per-
 son militia are being widely publicized by
 the administration.
 MILITARY OPTIONS
 The U.S. is clearly also keeping the
 military option open. Through diplomatic
 channels the U.S. is cautioning the Nica-
 raguans that they are "playing with fire,"
 much as Haig did in his December meeting
 with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
 d'Escoto. At the same time, the NSC has
 told the Pentagon "to work up very specif-
 ic contingency plans on such things as
 quarantines, blockades and military exer-
 zises in the event future events - such as
 the shipment of combat jets [or tanks] to
 Nicaragua - might call for consideration
 of a military response."
 Unilateral blockades and arms quaran-
 tines are.thought to be impossible to exe-
 cute successfully. What is worse for mili-
 tary planners, they are acts of war. A
 more likely possibility is said by
 Beecher's sources to be a quarantine of
 "something vital to Nicaragua's economic
 and military operations, such as petro-

 absolute majority in the Parliament. Upon
 assuming office, the Papandreou government
 attempted certain liberal reforms which
 did not challenge U.S. military and eco-
 nomic interests. The EK didn't even ad-
 dress the question of Greece leaving NATO
 or U.S. bases being closed. Nevertheless,
 the prime minister's attempt to entrust
 the Ministry of Defense to a person of his
 choice moved the U.S. to initiate destabi-
 lization of the centrist government.
 In 1965, CIA Chief of Station in Greece,
 John Maury became "directly involved in
 Greek politics. He was reported to have
 helped King Constantine buy Deputies of
 the Greek Center Union Party, thus bring-
 ing about the downfall of the Government
 of George Papandreou" in 1965.3 (Maury is
 now president of the Association of Former
 Intelligence Officers and one of the main
 promoters of the so-called Intelligence
 Identities Protection Act. In fact,
 Maury's conduct in Greece demonstrates why
 the Act should not be made law.) A chain
 of King-appointed, short-lived governments
 was broken by the military-fascist coup of
 April 21, 1967. The direct role of the
 U.S. in the establishment and support of
 the Greek junta is well-documented. The
 dictatorship finally collapsed during the
 1974 Cyprus crisis, but only after
 eight years of bloody and repressive rule.
 "New Democracy," the rightwing party
 that controlled an absolute majority in
 the Parliament from 1974 to 1981, proved
 incapable of solving the tremendous prob-
 lems plaguing the working people of
 Greece. This is not surprising, as subser-
 vience to NATO and U.S. corporate inter-
 ests - the very causes of such problems -
 was the essence of that party's policy.
 "Greece belongs to the West," declared
 then-Prime Minister Constantine
 Karamanlis, the leader of "New Democracy,"
 in his address to the Parliament on Octo-
 16, 1975.4 With the defeat of "New Democ-
 racy," this submission is now being chal-
 lenged.
 Three
 ernment
 main tasks confront the
 and the Greek Left: the
 a genuinely independent foreign
 fundamental changes in the economic struc-
 ture designed to benefit the working peo-
 ple of the country, and the democratiza-
 tion of social life. Of course, these
 three tasks cannot be achieved in isola-
 tion from each other. Meaningful economic
 changes are inconceivable so long as
 Greece remains attached to the economic
 and strategic role assigned to it by NATO
 and the European Common Market. Nor are
 such economic changes attainable without
 the active participation and involvement
 of the working people, i.e. without democ-
 ratization of social life.
 The first and foremost step in the pur-
 suit of an independent foreign policy is
 the withdrawal of Greece from NATO and the
 dismantling of U.S. military bases. Greece
 has been a most "loyal" NATO member until
 1974, when troops of Turkey, another NATO
 member, invaded the Republic of Cyprus,
 occupying almost half of its territory.
 (80 percent of the people on Cyprus are
 Greek, 20 percent Turkish.) Even the
 staunchest Western apologists could  not
 explain to the Greek people what kind  of
 "protection" NATO offered  their fellow
 Greeks in Cyprus. Hence, the rightwing
 civilian government that took office imme-
 diately after the collapse of the military
 junta in 1974  was forced to announce the
 withdrawal of Greece from the military
 wing of NATO. Greece never withdrew, how-
 ever, from the political

 In 1980 Greece resumed its previous
 "normal" relationship with NATO, formally
 rejoining the military wing. Pretenses
 aside, the hastiness with which this deal,
 the "Rogers Plan," was arranged, the se-
 crecy of the terms, and its timing -
 shortly before the elections - suggest
 that it was designed to present the next
 government (whose character was anticipat-
 ed) with a set situation and to raise ob-
 stacles to total withdrawal of Greece from
 NATO.
 Although PASOK has in the past called
 for the withdrawal of Greece from NATO,
 the government program presented to the
 Parliament by Papandreou on November 22
 contained no such call. The program de-
 nounced the Rogers Plan as "harmful to
 [the] national interests" of Greece  and

 plan. Finally, it does not address Greek
 participation in the political wing of
 NATO. Because of this, KKE abstained  from
 the vote on the government program.
 Papandreou's actions at a NATO defense
 ministers' meeting in Brussels in early
 December were equally ambiguous. On one
 hand, Papandreou blocked the issuing of a
 final communique - usually a routine event
 - demanding that NATO guarantee the safety
 of Greek borders against fellow NATO mem-
 ber Turkey. Not surprisingly, the minis-
 ters refused to go along with that demand.
 On the other hand, Papandreou's announce-
 ment of Greece's "partial suspension" of
 NATO commitments at the meeting was vague,
 so vague that some NATO officials appar-
 ently dismissed it as "diplomatic grand-
 standing." Meanwhile, almost half a mil-
 lion people demonstrated in Greece for
 disarmament and against U.S. bases in the
 country on December 6.

 Papandreou's plans to remove U.S. mili-
 tary bases are likely to encounter great
 obstacles. Most of these are not directly
 related to NATO but stem from bilateral
 U.S.-Greek agreements. The removal of the
 bases will have to be negotiated separate-
 ly from Greece's withdrawal from NATO.
 Among the numerous U.S. bases in Greece
 are: 1) a naval base in Eleusis  (Piraeus)
 near Athens; 2) Souda Naval Base on Crete;
 "a large and convenient anchorage [which]
 allows the United States to project the
 Sixth Fleet far into the eastern Mediter-
 ranean." The Souda base "would be diffi-
 cult to replace," and  includes  a missile
 firing installation used by NATO. Nuclear
 weapons are also stored at Souda; 3) Hel-
 lenikon Air Base,  also on Crete, which
 serves as a base for  U.S. intelligence
 surveillance in the eastern Mediterranean]
 4) Iraklion Air Station, a "major elec-
 tronic surveillance station;"  and 5) the
 Fleet Communication System Center at Nea
 Makri, especially important for the Sixth
 Fleet. According to the Athens daily Ta
 Nea (February 22 to 24, 1978), the CIA has
 also been using Nea Makri as a base of op-
 erations.6
 The existence of U.S. bases constitutes
 a danger to the Greek people for a number
 of reasons. These bases were used by the
 NaNionW -
 -.CRETE
 U.S. to intervene in the October 1973 war
 in the Middle East. According to a conser-
 vative Greek newspaper, the Greek govern-
 ment "imperiled the good relations between
 Greece and the Arabs, by secretly allowing
 the Americans to use... bases in Greece
 for transporting  equipment to Israel dur-
 ing the Arab-Israeli war.... Greece also
 allowed U.S. intelligence to use a commu-
 nications station outside Athens in order?
 to tap Soviet and Arab radio broadcasts."
 The bases make the country a military tar-
 get even in a conflict in which Greece is
 not directly involved. Their existence al-
 so requires a Greek government friendly
 toward the U.S.   Therefore, the bases
 might pose a threat to a government such
 as PASOK. Finally, they are sources of so-
 cial pollution. The areas where the bases
 are located have become centers of corrup-
 tion, characterized by a rising crime
 rate, increased prostitution, drug traffic
 etc., involving U.S. military personnel.
 Prime Minister Papandreou announced that
 base negotiations will begin early in
 1982. He said that the negotiations will
 set a timetable for the removal of the
 bases, but he did not name a deadline. He
 added that until the bases are removed,
 they will operate under the following re-
 strictions:

 a)  [Greek] control and supervision of
 their activities.
 b) Yearly revision and potential termi-
 nation of the relevant agreements,   so
 that the national interests of Greece
 are guaranteed.
 c) Suspension of the bases' activity
 when the security of Greece or the
 country's relations with other friend-
 ly countries in the region is at stake.8
 These are certainly positive measures, but
 they are somewhat vague and, most impor-
 tantly, their implementation is yet to be
 seen. How the Greek government will be
 able to control, let alone to suspend, the
 activities of the bases is not at all
 clear, and Papandreou's speech shed no
 light on the question. At the same time,
 concrete statements have been made.  "Re-
 moval of nuclear weapons will be one of
 our first demands in the talks on the U.S.
 bases," said Dimitri Maroudas, a PASOK
 spokesperson in a press conference on No-
 vember 11. He also indicated that the
 Greek government favors the idea of nucle-
 ar-free Balkans. This statement came
 shortly after Bulgaria's President Todor
 Zhivkov proposed a Balkan summit on the
 issue, a proposal that now has some
 chances of being implemented.
 CYPRUS
 prus, Archbishop Makarios, and to over-
 throw the legitimate government. Under the
 pretext of "restoring the legal order,"
 the Turkish army invaded the island, occu-
 pying about 40 percent of the   land.  and
 forcing 200,000 Greek Cypriots (almost 40
 percent of the island's population) into
 refugee camps in the southern, unoccupied
 part of the country. Following the col-
 lapse of the junta in Greece and their
 puppets in Cyprus, the legitimate govern-
 ment of Cyprus was restored, but the Turk-
 ish army still controls 40 percent of  the
 island. It seems clear that the objective
 of the U.S. and NATO militarists is the de
 facto partitioning of Cyprus by the insti-
 tutionalization of the Turkish military
 presence.
 The former Greek government dealt  with
 this issue as an internal NATO "family"
 dispute, diminishing the role of the Unit-
 ed Nations in its solution and essentially
 refusing to use the support offered by the
 socialist and non-aligned countries in re-
 solving the Cyprus problem. The main in-
 gredients of the solution are: recognition
 of the central government as the legiti-
 mate political power in Cyprus; withdrawal
 of all foreign troops; and return of the
 refugees to their homes. These aims were
 adopted in the PASOK government program
 presented to the Parliament on November
 22, 1981.
 Another major foreign policy question is
 the issue of Cyprus. The Republic of Cy-
 prus, a sovereign state since it gained
 its independence from Britain in 1953, has
 been an active member of the non-aligned
 movement. The island of Cyprus, strategi-
 cally situated at the conjunction of Eu-
 rope, Asia and Africa, is an ideal loca-
 tion to base U.S. forces policing the Mid-
 dle East. The political orientation of
 that country, however, ruled out this pos-
 sibility. The U.S. and NATO goal is to
 partition the island between Greece and
 Turkey. Both of these countries are  NATO
 members and have agreements with the U.S.
 allowing the establishment of military
 bases on their territory. Both Greek and
 Turkish rightwing terrorists, in line with
 this U.S. and NATO policy, have been try-
 ing for over twenty years,by-and-large un-
 successfully, to divide the two ethnic
 communities of the island.

 and executed by the Greek military junta,
 attempted to murder the president of Cy-

 GREECE AND EUROPE
 Another critical foreign policy issue,
 directly affecting domestic economic poli-
 cy, is the question of the relations of
 Greece to the European Economic Community
 (EEC), an organization "uniting" the West-
 ern European industrial countries. When
 the economic crisis of the mid-1970s  hit
 the capitalist European countries, the EEC
 changed its exclusionist policy. The new
 strategy - designed to mellow down the
 crisis for the industrially advanced coun-
 tries by shifting part of the burden to
 others - was to bring in the less develop-
 ed capitalist countries: Greece, Turkey,
 Spain and Portugal. Greece was the first
 (and so far the only) to join, becoming
 the tenth member of the EEC in 1980. The
 consequences of that move, even in the
 short time that has elapsed, have been de-
 vastating. Greek industry cannot compete
 with the much more developed Western Euro-
 pean countries within the framework of the

 EEC. Agriculture is in a state of chaos as
 Greek peasants are forced to abandon tra-
 ditional crops to conform to the stipula-
 tions of the "Common Agricultural Policy"
 dictated by the EEC.
 Both major Left parties, PASOK and KKE,
 are opposed to the participation of Greece
 in the EEC and campaigned on anti-EEC
 platforms in the recent elections. In his
 pronouncement of the government program,
 Papandreou stated: "Our goal is to hold a
 referendum... for the Greek people to de-
 cide on this serious issue. "  He pointed
 out, however, that calling for a referen-
 dum lies within the power of the president
 of the country, a position held by the
 leader of "New Democracy," Karamanlis. The
 president of Greece, an office endowed
 with extraordinary constitutional and law-
 making powers, is not elected by direct
 vote, but through the Parliament.
 Karamanlis was elected president in 1980
 for a five-year term. It is highly unlike-
 ly that Karamanlis - the architect of the
 previous government's pro-EEC policy -
 would call a referendum.
 Greece is facing a critical period. The
 electoral victory of the Left and the for-
 mation of a progressive government by
 PASOK, may be the seeds of much-needed po-
 litical and social. change that would end
 Western domination and create a society
 catering to the needs of the Greek people
 and not the greed of multinational corpo-
 rations or the strategic interests of the
 U.S. and NATO. The meaning of the vote
 cast on October 18 is that the Greek peo-
 ple desire, indeed demand, a progressive
 reorientation of their country. The mili-
 tary coup of 1967 and CIA activities to
 destabilize the liberal government of
 Andreas Papandreou's father demonstrate
 that PASOK's task is enormous.

 Jurgen Roth Interview
 Turkish Fascism as NATO Democracy
 The September 12, 1980 military coup in
 NATO member country Turkey, led by General
 Kenan Evren got, as the Wall Street Jour-
 nal commented, "relatively good" press
 coverage in the U.S. and in Western Eu-
 rope.   The Economist, mouthpiece of Euro-
 pean capital, grudgingly conceded that the
 coup may be "regrettable" because NATO is
 "morally weakened when the democratically
 elected government of a member country is
 forcibly overthrown," but then praised the
 Generals for moving to eliminate "terror-
 ism," and giving the country one more
 chance to become stable.   Newsweek intro-
 duced the Generals as "benevolent despots"
 and labeled Fvren "Turkey's Father Fig-
 ure."  Such uncritical coverage by the
 Western media is hardly a new phenomenon.
 It closely resembles press treatment of
 Turkey's two previous coups in 1960 and
 1971.
 Reality for many Turkish people, as
 described in the following interview with
 West German journalist, Jiirgen Roth, is
 quite different, and has been for some
 time.   The first military takeover, led by
 General Cemal Gursel on May 27, 1960, fol-
 lowed a wave of student unrest and econom-
 ic instability, partly caused by the de-
 valuation of the Turkish lira.   One of
 Gursel's first post-coup actions was to
 dispatch a colonel to U.S. Ambassador
 Warren Fletcher with the assurance that he
 intended "to build a Turkey on the model

 of the U.S." (A secret 1961 State Depart-
 ment report had characterized Gursel as
 "strongly pro-Western.")
 The Turkish Generals instituted a new
 and relatively liberal constitution, but
 at the same time, on U.S. advice, they
 founded the Mutual Aid Society (OYAK).
 OYAK began as an inconspicuous society,
 financed by officers' salaries, popular
 "donations" and, at times, the U.S. gov-
 ernment.   It has now developed into one of
 Turkey's largest holding companies, tying
 the military firmly to the corporate rich
 and foreign multinationals.   Today, OYAK
 controls virtually the entire insurance
 sector and much of the armaments and auto
 industries.  (It owns 42 percent of Renault
 Turkey and 87 percent of International
 Harvester Co. in Turkey.)
 The late 1960s saw an upsurge of opposi-
 tion to an economic policy which left ba-
 sic needs of many workers and peasants un-
 met, and to Turkey's dependence on NATO.
 Protests were countered with government
 repression and terror from the Right.
 During this time, the MHP (see glossary)
 founded the first training camps for its
 commandos - the-Grey Wolves - while the
 CIA and the U.S. Green Berets began to
 train the Counter-Guerrilla, a secret ter-
 ror organization consisting of members of
 the military, police and MIT.   The Coun-
 ter-Guerrilla  was headquartered in Ankara
 in the same building that housed the U.S.
 military mission.
 In collaboration with the Grey Wolves,
 the Counter-Guerrilla was responsible for
 numerous acts of terrorism which preceded
 the March 12, 1971 military takeover.
 This coup, accompanied by mass arrests and
 torture, was directed against the left
 movement which had voiced strong opposi-
 tion both to an economic policy devastat-
 ing for workers and to the ruling AP's
 threats to scuttle certain liberal sec-
 tions of the constitution.   The coup,
 which according to Roth was "basically...
 planned by the intelligence agencies CIA
 and MIT," was to prevent the Left from
 taking power.
 The 1973 elections, after two years of
 military rule, brought the CHP to power in
 a coalition government.   Bulent Ecevit's
 rule was short-lived.   He called for new
 elections in 1975 and lost, largely due to
 his inability to deliver on economic prom-
 ises.   A National Front (NF) coalition

 tion and Development] officer in charge of
 Europe.
 Whose interests does the present govern-
 ment represent?
 The Generals are not, as is often said,
 politically independent. Instead, they are
 tied to the capitalist system. The Gener-
 als are representatives of monopoly capi-
 talism, the faction of capitalists in Tur-
 key which works closely with multinational
 corporations, especially. from West Germa-
 ny, the U.S., and Switzerland. Because of
 that they have a strong self-interest in
 the, execution of the Milton Friedman eco-
 nomic program in spite of the fact that it
 benefits only a miniscule sector of soci-
 ety.
 Wfhy did the coup take place in September
 1980? Are there reasons why it came at
 that specific time?
 The official reason given by the Gener-
 als is known: rising terrorism. It's obvi-
 ous that the military felt threatened by a
 rising leftist movement, and they felt
 they couldn't wait much longer. For in-
 stance, the Turkish labor federation DISK
 was planning a general strike at the time
 of the coup, and this strike was a poZiti-
 cal one, directed against political re-
 pression by the Demirel government and
 against high inflation and social injus-
 tice.
 At the same time there were external
 22 -- CounterSpy -- Feb. - April 1982
 factors. One of them, naturally, was Af-
 ghanistan and another was Iran, where an
 important Western stronghold had fallen.
 Turkey, with its geostrategic position,
 has been one of the few countries which is
 able to represent U.S. and NATO interests
 in Third World countries, especially in
 the Middle East. The very unstable inter-
 nal situation in Turkey presented a prob-
 lem for NATO in that respect. Even before
 the coup, NATO could no longer count on
 Turkey as a reliable ally. A military in-
 tervention had become necessary to stabi-
 lize the country in the interests of West-
 ern imperialism.
 Are there any indications that NATO
 countries were directly involved in the
 coup?
 There was certainly an indirect involve-
 ment, but it is hard to prove that they
 intervened directly in the coup itself.
 However, I don't think it is a coincidence
 that a high-ranking State Department offi-
 cer, John Williams,, (whom I met in Brussels
 at a conference of the Friedrich Ebert
 Foundation) was in Ankara at the time of
 the coup. Before that, he just happened to
 be in Athens at the time of the military
 coup there, and in Turkey at the time of
 the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. More im-
 portant, however, is the fact that the
 U.S. played a key role in the creation of
 a climate that allowed the coup to take
 place.
 How was that climate created?
 Terrorism in Turkey before the coup was
 mainly the work of the extreme right and
 the so=called Counter-Guerrilla, a mili-
 tary organization trained by CIA officers.
 This Counter-Guerrilla created instabiZi-
 ty, and the Generals, likewise trained in
 the U.S., used that terrorism as a reason
 for staging a coup.
 Actually, it all began well over ten
 years ago. There was a military coup in
 1971 which had a structure very similar to
 the 1980 coup. At that time leading poli-
 ticians declared that it had been Zed by
 the CIA. There is the statement by a for-
 mer Turkish foreign minister, and even the
 former Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, said
 that "foreign powers" played a role in the
 coup. The foreign power in Turkey at the
 time was, of course, the United States.
 The preparation for the 1980 coup began
 way back in 1974 and utilized two tools.

 that this "stability" was achieved only
 because the workers and peasants are being
 suppressed with Western-supplied weapons.
 The Generals are now facing some pro-
 tests from Western Europe because they
 outlawed all political parties. Almost all
 parties in Europe are advocating that aid
 to Turkey should be halted if the Generals
 continue that policy. The only resistance,
 internationally, is coming from Europe and
 not the U.S.
 However, I think that to demand a return
 to democracy is somewhat illusionary. It
 is all too obvious that the political
 parties are not able to solve the coun-
 try's social and economic problems. There
 are strong indications that there's a siz-
 able revolutionary movement in Turkey, but
 what  that's going to achieve one cannot
 predict. There are two currents: What hap-
 pened in Iran might also happen in Turkey.
 At the same time, the left might decide
 that things cannot be changed by working
 toward the re-introduction of the parlia-
 mentary system. Their conclusion could on-
 ly be to create an armed liberation move-
 ment. And as I see it, that's exactly what
 is happening now.
 What do the Generals want for Turkey?
 They say they want stability, but they
 haven't explained what that means. Stabil-
 ity, above all, requires more social jus-
 tice, and the Generals haven't shown any
 interest in passing laws that would en-
 hance social justice. Most importantly,
 they would have to institute a land re-
 form, and there are no signs of that what-
 soever. In rural Turkey today, there is a
 very small sector of large landowners on
 one side, and a huge sector of landless
 peasants, often even serfs, on the other
 side. This feudal system, especially in
 eastern Anatolia, is a natural breeding-
 ground for the liberation movements.
 To come back to an issue you raised be-

 NATO and the U.S. as a country that be-
 longs to the Third World, a country with a
 large percentage of the population being
 Muslim   and at the same time a country
 that is part of NATO.
 The strategic importance of Turkey is
 obvious. There are countless U.S. and NATO
 military facilities, especially in the
 eastern part of the country. It is not
 just radar facilities, but military facil-
 ities which can be used against Third
 World countries. And that is very attrac-
 tive for the U.S.  The Rapid Deployment
 Force is using bases in Turkey, and the
 nuclear depots in Turkey are not there to
 counter the danger of a Soviet invasion -
 which is all but nonexistent anyway - but
 primarily against the liberation movements
 in Africa and Asia. These movements are
 already being suppressed from Turkey., a
 prime example is the Kurds, and we'll see
 it in North Africa.
 NATO needs Turkey. I was told by a U.S.
 professor, Lawrence Whetten, who identi-
 fied himself as a policy advisor of the
 U.S. government, that if Turkey wants to
 become independent, the U.S. will punish
 it. And I don't think there is a better
 expression for what is happening in Turkey
 right now.
 You mentioned the so-called Kurdish
 problem. How has the military coup affect-
 ed the lives of the people in Turkish Kur-
 distan?
 First of all, the coup has had the same
 effects on the Kurds as on all the other
 people. But they got it worse. The Kurdish
 area in eastern Anatolia is very rugged
 and much more isolated than the rest of
 the country, and guerrilla movements have
 been organizing there for a long time. In
 the past they were able to move freely
 across the borders to Iran and Iraq and,
 to a certain extent, presented a military
 threat to Turkey as a NATO country. Unlike
 tries. This strategic partnership appears to go far
 beyond the two countries' NATO membership. Comment-
 ed the New York Times: "Not since the heyday of the
 Baghdad Pact nearly a quarter of a century ago has
 there been such a public effusion of warmth and un-
 derstanding between Washington and Ankara." U.S.
 aid to the Turkish junta will be stepped up. Pres-
 ently, Turkey receives some $700 million in U.S.
 military and economic aid for the fiscal year that
 began on October 1, 1981. For the next year, the
 Generals are requesting $900 million in military
 aid alone.

 the rest of the country, the guerrilla
 movement in Kurdistan is very strong. It
 is a national liberation movement with two
 basic demands: End the feudal system, and
 freedom for Kurdistan. So on one side it
 is the struggle for social justice, on the
 other the struggle for independence or at
 least self-determination.
 After the military coup the Kurds began
 to be oppressed in a way that is almost
 unimaginable. The military and elite units
 raided whole villages and tortured every-
 body collectively - men, women and child-
 ren. The military conducted aerial bomb-
 ings of  regions where they thought guer-
 riZZas might be hiding. Three divisions of
 the Turkish army were stationed in Kurdi-
 stan. For all practical purposes, Kurdi-
 stan is an occupied country.
 In addition to the occupation and col-
 lective torture, everyone who is arrested
 or taken in for questioning is tortured.
 Torture is conducted by speciaZZy trained
 units.- it has become very sophisticated.
 The military also conducts mass trials
 against suspected members of Kurdish orga-
 nizations, at times as many as 2,000 peo-
 ple are tried simultaneously by the same
 judge. Naturally, there are no democratic
 rights whatsoever and no effective de-
 fense.
 The number of "indirect death sentences"
 is also on the rise. That means people are
 not sentenced to death by a judge; they're
 simply gunned down in the streets. All
 these things are hardly known in Western
 Europe and in the United States, but the
 only comparison one can make is to the
 brutal methods of fascist dictatorships in
 Latin America.
 The Turkish military is a member of NATO
 and NATO officers are stationed in Turkey.
 Has the brutality of the Turkish military
 brought about any change in the collabora-
 tion of NATO officers with them?
 I don't think so. Last fall there were
 large NATO maneuvers in eastern Anatolia,
 and that's a strong symbol for the popula-
 tion. They see that it is not only the
 Turkish military that is oppressing them,
 but it is done with the presence and, at
 the very least, the acquiescence of the
 foreign troops in the country.
 Some people compare Turkey today to
 Chile; what are the similarities?
 Structurally, the two countries are very
 Police
 Maps such as this one  listing special
 police telephone numbers for informants
 to call were published in Turkish news-
 papers after the September 1980 coup.
 The Turkish police can proudly pro-
 claim to have one of the highest rates
 of solved crimes compared to other coun-
 tries. The reason for that, however, is
 not a sophisticated crime-solving tech-
 nique. An anecdote told in Ankara gives
 a hint: Some NATO officers are debating
 the best way to hunt bears. Each of them
 describes his method, and then the Turk-
 ish officer says: "If I want to hunt a
 bear, I catch a rabbit." Surprise all
 around,."A rabbit?"  "Yes, a rabbit, and
 then I beat it as long as it takes to
 make it confess that it is a bear."
 The basis for policework... is a gener-
 ous reward system for usable tips. Spy-
 ing, especially by conservatives and fas-
 cists, leads regularly to mass arrests.
 After September 12, the Ankara military
 announced a phone number to be called for
 anonymous tips. However, the opposition
 thwarted that plan when they distributed
 handbills listing the same number as one
 which people could call to get informa-
 tion about cheap housing.  ...
 Since September 12, anyone can be de-
 tained without charge for 90 days. As  a
 rule, the imprisoned are held incommuni-
 cado, and are completely at the disposal
 and mercy of the police or military of-
 ficers. Torture and beatings during these
 days, no matter what the allegation is,
 are commonplace. In espionage cases,
 treason, or political crimes, the MIT
 takes over. The MIT has unlimited powers.
 People arrested by the MIT are not taken
 to the police station, they disappear,
 and their relatives don't know where to.
 The MIT has farms and country houses in
 remote areas which have been transformed
 into prisons and are heavily guarded.  . .

 the Gendarmerie in other countries, e.g.
 France).   Thanks to the U.S. and NATO, the
 Gendarmerie is today a force of 120,000
 men equipped with helicopters, armored ve-

 Four of its district commands are located
 in Turkish Kurdistan.10 Gendarmerie forces
 have raided Kurdish villages and terror-
 ized people again and again. Three infan-
 try brigades are devoted to this specific
 purpose. Kurds know them as the "Blue Be-
 rets" or "commandos": they were trained by
 the U.S. Green Berets.-1
 In addition to the armed forces, several
 types of police and the Counter-Guerrilla
 (see Jurgen Roth interview in this issue)

 and Britain, specialize in tracking down
 and defusing "subversive" movements.12 The

 mob-control police, as the name suggests,
 are designed to break up mass demonstra-
 tions and strikes. Special armored vehi-
 cles   with water, paint and rubber bullet
 spraying devices have been provided by
 West Germany for that purpose.13
 The Counter-Guerrilla can easily cross
 official national boundaries to attack
 Kurdish rebels. On February 12, 1980, for
 example, three mobile teams attacked
 Qamishi, a Kurdish town inside Syrian Kur-
 distan, killing fifteen people, three of
 them children. 14 Mobile team operations
 are backed up by the infamous Blue Berets
 and the Turkish National Intelligence
 Agency, MIT, which works closely with the
 CIA. Most of the MIT's activities are di-
 rected against the progressive forces
 in the region. The MIT closely collaborat-
 ed with SAVAK before the fall of the Shah
 of Iran, and with the Mukhabarat, the se-
 cret police of Iraq.
 THE CIA AND THE KURDS
 The CIA itself has committed atrocities
 against the Kurdish autonomy movement. As
 will be remembered, Kurds in Iraqi Kurdi-
 stan waged a guerrilla struggle against
 the Ba'ath regime from 1960 to 1975. By
 the early 1970s, the number of Kurdish
 fighters reached 100,000. The Shah of
 Iran, involved in a border dispute with
 Iraq, sought to aid the Kurdish rebels to
 create trouble for the Ba'ath government.
 Kurdish rebel leader Mustafa Barzani, a
 feudal chief, lacked confidence in the
 Shah, but was willing to accept the offer
 if the U.S. could guarantee the future
 flow of aid. Following a private meeting
 between Henry Kissinger and the Shah, U.S.
 aid amounting to $16 million began. De-
 tails of this operation, carried out by
 the CIA, were released in the Pike Report
 to the House of Representatives, which was
 reproduced in the February 23, 1976 Vil-
 lage Voice, almost a year after Barzani's
 movement was defeated.
 From the very beginning, "neither the
 Shah nor... Dr. Kissinger desired victory"
 for the Kurds. "They merely hoped to in-
 sure that the insurgents would be capable
 of sustaining a high level of hostility,
 just high enough to sap [Iraq's] re-
 sources." The plan proceeded nicely along
 these lines. The feudal leader obtained
 some out-of-date  anti-aircraft guns and
 low-power artillery, and. launched a con-
 30 -- Counterspy -- Feb. - ApriZ 1982
 ventional war in which the Kurds were  no
 match for the sophisticated weaponry of
 the Iraqi army. Moreover, the CIA "had
 long-standing information indicating that
 [the Shah] would abandon [the Kurds] the
 moment he reached an agreement with  his
 enemy [Iraq]."15
 That moment arrived on March 6, 1975,
 when the Shah and Iraqi leader Saddam
 Hussein embraced during the OPEC confer-
 ence in Algiers. The Shah made a deal with
 Hussein to settle the border conflict and
 ordered the Iranian army to cut the supply
 lines of the Kurdish fighters. According
 to Kurdish refugees, the Iranian army ac-
 tually started to bomb some of the Kurdish
 positions. Barzani was forced to order his
 guerrillas to pull back from the front
 lines. An Iraqi offensive caught the Kurds
 very badly off guard in one of the coldest
 months of the year. The human cost of the
 war was very high. Close to 700,000 people
 were either displaced, killed, or deported
 to forced settlements guarded by Iraqi
 soldiers, where many remain to this day.
 This is not the first tragedy the U.S.
 government has set up in the Middle East.
 The Palestinian revolution received a sim-
 ilar blow from the Jordanian-CIA joint op-
 eration in September 1970. The liberation
 war of the Dhofari people in Oman was set
 back by the massive invasion of the Shah's
 troops backed by the U.S. fleet in the
 Indian Ocean. In Pakistan, the Baluchi
 uprising of 1973-77 was put down in a
 similar manner.
 Nevertheless, things are changing.
 Kurds, Palestinians, Dhofaris and Baluchis
 are increasingly questioning the acts and
 intentions of the "bastion of freedom" -
 the U.S.A.   These days one can hear people
 saying: "If America is for freedom, then
 how come it helps these corrupt occupiers
 kill our children?"  They know that the
 bullets and the M-16 rifles carried by the
 Blue Berets are made in the U.S.A.   The
 Voice of America radio distributes chills,
 not smiles. From a distance, the land of
 the oppressed seems to lie under snow and
 frost. But does not spring follow winter?

 travel to Libya. Deputy Secretary of State against Arab groups in the U.S. for use at
 William Clark, making the announcement,
 said there was "an imminent danger to the
 physical safety of Americans,"21 echoing
 the words of the Carter administration to
 justify its ban on travel to Iran several
 weeks prior to the unsuccessful military
 raid into Iran. Despite Clark's words,
 however, many Americans leaving Libya bit-
 terly said they felt safer in Libya than
 in the U.S.
 At the same time, Libyan nationals  in
 the U.S. are increasingly having immigra-
 tion problems, and it has been reported
 that one of the options actively consid-
 ered against Libya during the NSC deliber-
 ations on Libya in early December was  the
 -expulsion of all Libyan nationals from the
 U.S.  A strong argument against this ac-
 tion reportedly grew out of concern for
 anti-Qaddafi Libyans among them. It is
 probably true that there is reason to wor-
 ry about the freedom and safety of some
 Libyans if they were forced back to Lib-
 ya.22 But there  is also an awareness that
 these Libyans are a group that the U.S.
 government can work with in overthrowing
 Qaddafi. Qaddafi, in fact, recently ac-
 cused the CIA of recruiting thirty Libyan
 students to return home to spy for the
 U.S.23 The CIA has been doing exactly that
 with foreign student groups in the U.S.
 since its inception.
 Many Arab-Americans are convinced that
 the "hit squad" stories, like the "big Red
 scare" of the 1950s, could "turn into a
 witch-hunt - and that it could be directed
 against them. From Los Angeles to Detroit
 to Washington, Arab-Americans [in mid-De-
 cember] were accusing the Reagan Adminis-
 tration of cynically creating a climate of
 fear that could only increase the isola-
 tion felt by many immigrants and Americans
 of Middle Eastern descent." One man inter-
 viewed, head of a community center in
 Michigan, said that the "hit squad"
 stories would cause "real problems" in the
 Arab-American community: "It strengthens
 the preconception that all Arabs are ter-
 rorists." Arab-American organizations have
 long charged that manipulation of that
 preconception as  well as harassment from

 a later time. Military action by the  U.S.
 against Libya, for example, could provoke
 strong opposition in the U.S.  It would
 not be surprising that American officials,
 if they are contemplating military action,
 would want to be well prepared on the home
 front, just as Clark's statement that
 Americans are not safe in Libya indicates
 a concern for the foreign front.25
 Memories linger among Arab-Americans of
 the "anti-terrorist" campaign ordered by
 Richard Nixon in late 1972 in the after-
 math of the seizure of Israeli athletes at
 the 1972 Munich Olympics by a Black Sep-
 tember unit and the failed attempt by Is-
 raelis and Germans to rescue them by kill-
 ing their captors. The Nixon administra-
 tion established a cabinet-level committee
 on terrorism, including the directors of
 the CIA and the FBI. Nixon also issued an
 executive order which included five "anti-
 terrorist" measures. The first was "Opera-
 tion Boulder," according to scholar
 Mohammed Shadid, ordering "the CIA to car-
 ry out a security check on any Arab trav-
 eling to the United States," leading to
 "weeks and months of delay for those seek-
 ing visas." The other four measures were:
 "Special postal checks of mail from sus-
 pect areas, tightening of the anti-hijack-
 ing program..., doubling of the number  of
 wiretaps, and a nationwide surveillance
 and. investigation campaign of politically
 active Arabs in general and Palestinians
 in particular."
 Describing activities that bear some re-
 semblance to those endured by Iranians af-
 ter November 1979, Shadid wrote: "The FBI
 and immigration officials frequently ab-
 used, intimidated and harassed individuals
 investigated.... During the first two
 months of this investigating campaign,"
 Shadid said, "125 Arab students were de-
 ported, most of them without due process.
 About  seventy students were arrested, but

 the present campaign now, or at some fu-
 ture time, will take on the dimensions of
 the domestic campaign against Iranians
 throughout 1980. There is concern among

 the U.S. that it will.
 PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS
 There has been great concern inside Lib-
 ya over possible plots by Western powers
 for a number of months. On several occa-
 sions, the Free Unionist Officers (the
 progressive group in the military that
 overthrew the monarchy in 1969 and brought
 Qaddafi to power) in Libya issued threats
 that Reagan would be killed if the CIA
 caused Qaddafi's death. It is conceivable
 that the reports presently circulating re-
 flect preparations by Libya for this con-
 tingency. The Free Unionist Officers made
 their first counterthreat just after News-
 week's report in July 1981 that the CIA's
 Max Hugel had briefed the Senate Intelli-
 gence Committee on a plot to assassinate
 Qaddafi. The White House quickly denied
 that there was a direct assassination plot
 but remained silent about the rest of the
 story - that the CIA planned to destabi-
 lize Libya and ultimately to overthrow
 Qaddafi with the help of Libyan exiles and
 Egypt. A Daily News article of May had
 earlier reported that "senior Administra-
 tion officials" were saying that the U.S.
 would "encourage" conservative Arab states
 that feel threatened by Qaddafi, "most
 notably Egypt, to take action of their
 own, either through direct invasion or
 sponsorship of a coup."27 The Daily News
 item appeared ten days after the State De-
 partment ordered Libyan diplomats out of
 the U.S. and asked Americans to leave Lib-
 ya for the first time, and about a week
 before Libya arrested a group-it claimed
 was planning a coup. Journalist Claudia
 Wright later noted that the U.S. secretly
 lent Anwar Sadat an AWACS plane about this
 time and speculated that the U.S. might
 have done so in order to watch for possi-
 ble Soviet and Syrian military moves to
 save Qaddafi from a coup attempt against
 him.28
 During August 1980, French intelligence
 allegedly cooperated with Egypt and the
 CIA in an unsuccessful plot to overthrow
 Qaddafi.29 This failure and the upcoming
 now it has been disclosed that "a high-
 ranking French official" also "brought  an
 assassination plan to the Reagan Adminis-
 tration last February [1981]." The off i-
 cial is said to have been present at a
 White House meeting with Richard Allen and
 assistant secretaries of state Nicholas
 Veliotes and Chester Crocker. The French
 official reportedly "proposed that the
 killing be done by a group of Libyan ex-
 iles and controlled by the French,"  and
 asked for a "general expression of admin-
 istration support for the venture and as-
 sistance in the aftermath of the coup.
 Specifically, he wanted the U.S. to give
 quick diplomatic recognition to
 [Qaddafi's] successor. He also sought  as-
 surances that the U.S. would be prepared
 to interdict Libyan harbors and airfields
 in the event of a move by Moscow to pro-
 tect the vast supply of Soviet weapons in
 the country."  The scheme, the official
 explained, would have to await the anti-
 cipated re-election of Giscard in May).
 "but he suggested that the planning begin.
 ... U.S. officials agreed to keep the
 talks going. The venture came to an abrupt
 halt when Giscard was unexpectedly defeat-
 ed at the polls by... Mitterrand."30
 Mitterrand's inauguration occurred at
 about the same time that the alleged plot-
 ters were arrested in Libya, and French
 intelligence has since reportedly main-
 tained a policy toward Libya at odds  with
 the Mitterrand government.   These differ-
 ences came to a head in late October when,
 unknown to Mitterrand, French intelli-
 gence, in an effort perhaps to provoke a
 French-Libyan confrontation, fed AFP the
 false 'report that Libya was staging a coup
 in Chad. The report was publicized world-
 wide and caused some of France's 1,700
 troops stationed in the Central African
 Republic to go on alert.31
 The recent U.S. "Bright Star" military
 maneuvers in Egypt have caused consider-
 able alarm in Libya as well. An indication
 of the extent of concern was a Voice of
 Arab Homeland broadcast of November 3. It
 cited information from diplomatic circles

 ALLEGATIONS ABOUT LIBYAN PLOTS AGAINST
 U.S. OFFICIALS
 Since Sadat's assassination on October
 6, there has been an intensive U.S. effort
 to pin assassinations and assassination
 attempts on Qaddafi. The morning after
 Sadat was killed, Henry Kissinger said
 that "if Libya had been taken care of two
 years ago, last year, this year  Sadat
 would probably be alive today."~7 General
 Haig told a closed briefing that the
 promptness and intensity of reaction  by
 Radio Tripoli after Sadat was shot indi-
 cated that Libya at least had advance
 warning.38 (One report even claimed that
 Hosni Mubarak three days before had
 "warned the White House of what he feared
 was a Libyan-financed, Soviet-backed plot"
 against Sadat.39) Along with increased
 military readiness for U.S. forces in the
 region, it was announced that Reagan had
 responded immediately with "heavier secu-
 rity... on U.S. diplomats in the re-
 gion. "40
 Despite extensive efforts,   the U.S.
 could find no Libyan link to the assassi-
 nation. Egypt, too, later exonerated "out-
 side powers."  On October 9, however, in
 the midst of the tensions on Egypt's bor-
 ders after Sadat's death and the propagan-
 da campaign against Libya, NBC reported
 that the FBI and Secret Service were in-
 vestigating the possibility that "hit
 squads," trained and manned by ex-Green
 Berets and hired by Libya, were plotting
 to kill Reagan, and that for that reason
 Reagan did not attend Sadat's funeral.'

 plans to have Reagan assassinated."
 (Anderson said he had been given the
 translation by the NSA,44 but he did not
 explain under what conditions he got it.)
 In its report, Newsweek stated further
 that Maxwell Rabb, U.S. Ambassador to Ita-
 ly, was also the target of a Libyan plot -
 "a plot that was aborted when Italian po-
 lice deported ten suspected Libyan hit
 men."45 Nearly two weeks later, the New
 York Times reported that Rabb was hastily
 flown out of Italy October 21 after the
 discovery of "a Libyan plot to assassinate
 him," according to "a diplomatic source"
 (presumably in Washington). The plot al-
 legedly emerged while Rabb was visiting
 Milan; "a heavy cordon of police protec-
 tion" was promptly thrown around him, and
 he was "put on an early flight to Washing-
 ton.... The source said that about ten
 people, including some top Libyan intelli-
 gence officers, were implicated in the
 plot and that several had been expelled
 from Italy as a result."46
 On October 26, however, the Washington
 Post reported that Rabb had had lunch with
 Senator Larry Pressler in Washington on
 October 15, and had been there at least

 to go in and bash Libya for a long time,"
 and other sources said that Israel "might
 be trying to build public support in the
 United States for a strike" against Libya
 The Hartford Courant's U.S. "intelli-
 gence sources" also leaked rather sensa-
 tional stories. They said that all U.S.-
 Canadian border agents had been alerted,
 into the disappearance of Mousa Sadr. The
 timing of the hijacking and a denial by
 Nabih Birri, leader of the Amal Movement,
 that it was      involved71 along with the
 Anderson report, at least make for an in-
 teresting coincidence. Libya denounced the
 hijacking as a terrorist act of the CIA.

 with a background in terrorist tactics"
 said: "This would not be a lone  gunman-
 style assault, the kind we're used to
 [sic] in this country. We're talking
 about an all-out attack by people who
 don't care if they get away." A "high-
 ranking CIA official directly involved
 with intelligence on international terror-
 ism" said: "There is a very strong feeling
 that [Qaddaf i]  would like to strike be-
 fore the end of the year, during the holi-
 days. In his mind, assassinating a U.S.
 leader during the Thanksgiving-Christmas
 season would give it maximum impact." Two
 "ranking intelligence officials" said
 there was already "substantial" evidence
 that "up to six Libyans" had entered the
 U.S.  One of these officials said: "We're
 fairly certain that [the assassins] are
 here, but we haven't been able to pick up
 their trail."69 The New York Times, how-
 ever, claimed a week later that officials
 were still skeptically debriefing their
 informant.
 It is unclear how much mere publicity
 there is here and how much outright disin-
 formation. In September, Jack Anderson re-
 ported that the CIA was preparing a cam-
 paign to discredit Qaddafi through disin-
 formation. Anderson also reported a plan
 that sounded rather unlikely at the time
 but sounds less so in light of subsequent
 events: "The agency has even considered
 arranging the disappearance of a moderate
 Moslem leader after a visit to Libya. This
 could revive the outrage against Qaddafi
 in the Moslem world that followed the dis-
 appearance of a holy man, Mousa Sadr. He
 tors; all of these undermine the credibil-
 ity of the "hit squad" stories.   There are
 also pieces of counterevidence, although
 these are not always made available to the
 U.S. public. On December 4, for example, a
 UPI story from Beirut quoted "Lebanese se-
 curity forces" reporting that U.S. envoy
 Philip Habib was being stalked by "hit
 squads." The report was printed throughout
 the U.S.72 What was not reported, however,
 was the denial of the report by Lebanese
 Prime Minister Shafiq al-Wazzan, in his
 capacity as interior minister.73 Similar
 allegations of Libyan plots in Turkey74
 and Greece75 cannot be confirmed.
 As for the stories about the "hit
 squads" allegedly stalking Reagan, there
 have been reasons for skepticism from the
 very beginning. Many FBI agents assigned
 to the case were skeptical even early on
 about the "hit squads,"76 and customs of-
 ficers at many border crossings treated
 the matter in a very low-key fashion.' 7
 Canadian Immigration Minister Lloyd
 Axworthy said that in late November, at
 the time when the U.S. press was reporting
 increased vigilance along the U.S.-Canadi-
 an border,78       he had not received any
 notification of concern from the U.S. gov-
 ernment.79
 The Washington Post wrote on December 7,
 1981 that there were even doubts "within
 the global U.S. intelligence and security
 network:   "some analysts" doubt that
 Qaddafi "would put his name to an assassi-

 not], could lead to an incendiary after-

 tually were in effect, it likely would be
 a most closely guarded secret, and the
 ability of an informant to obtain the kind
 of detailed information on each squad mem-
 ber, as is now circulating, is viewed as
 highly unlikely." Some specialists believe
 the reported ten-man squad is too large
 and doubt that the team members were
 trained in Eastern Europe because of the
 "volatility of the mission and the feeling
 that no nation in Eastern Europe would
 take a chance on being associated with
 it."
 THE SPECTRE OF TERRORISM
 On the home front, intelligence gather-
 ing on Libyans and others in the U.S. con-
 tinues. Executive Order 12333, unleashing
 the CIA domestically, was signed with very
 little public reaction. And the spectre of
 terrorism in the U.S. has been created. In
 the long run, it  could be this  spectre
 that most benefits Reagan administration
 plans. The terrorism threat can be mani-
 pulated in a variety of ways to intensify
 repression at home and militarism abroad.
 Only by fighting the administration's
 plans on both fronts can this spectre be
 destroyed.

 by the administration to
 bring the campaign against Libya home to
 Americans has not been a huge success as
 of late December 1981. Skepticism grows
 and the "hit squads" remain as elusive as
 ever. Still, the Reagan administration has
 obviously exploited the public hue and cry
 to take certain actions against Libya and
 its opponents here at home. "One senior
 White House aide" admitted to Time that
 the publicity led the government to "speed
 up" its deliberations about sanctions
 against Libya.80 It is generally believed
 that economic sanctions will follow the
 withdrawal of Americans from Libya. Month-
 ly U.S. oil purchases from Libya were
 halved from April to August, contributing
 to the havoc threatening the Libyan econo-
 my; the hope is that this disruption can
 be increased. The possibility of freezing
 Libyan assets in the U.S. has been ex-
 plored, but Libya, it was discovered,
 keeps little money in U.S. banks.81 Fur-
 ther military pressures are also under
 .consideration. More maneuvers off the Gulf
 of Sidra are likely for early 1982, per-
 haps as soon as February.82

 GORDON WINTER - SPY AND REPORTER FOR FWF
 Before leaving the subject of FWF, Gordon
 Winter should be mentioned.  He worked for Forum
 for seven years during which time he was, as he
 has subsequently confessed, an intelligence agent
 for South Africa's Bureau of State Security
 (BOSS).  Winter first went to South Africa in
 1960 and got a job as crime reporter on the Jo-
 hannesburg Sunday Express.   In an interview on
 television in 1979 he said that the country was
 good to him and he wanted to do something in re-
 turn.  He became a spy.  He was deported from
 South Africa in somewhat mysterious circumstances
 and worked as a freelance journalist, which work
 included assignments for FWF.   He specialized in
 stories about South African exiles and attended
 many anti-apartheid meetings.   He was a familiar
 and unwelcome figure.  His camera recorded all
 personalities attending such meetings and, while
 suspected of being a South African agent, no one
 had proof.  As part of his journalistic work he
 became membership secretary of the National Union
 of Journalists' London freelance branch and as a
 result had access to the files and address lists
 of well known opponents of apartheid.
 One of Winter's tasks was to discredit such
 people and especially the Liberal Party whose
 members at the time (1969/70) were dramatically
 involved in the boycott of sporting links with
 South Africa and other anti-apartheid campaigns.
 It was Winter who, in 1971, somehow got hold of
 the story about Jeremy Thorpe's relationship with
 Norman Scott and tried, unsuccessfully, to sell
 it to Fleet Street.   The South African covert op-
 eration against the Liberals intensified ? ring
 the run-up to the 1974 election.  There were sus-
 picions that the arrest of Peter Hain for an al-
 leged bank robbery was an attempted frame-up to
 undermine the work of the Young Liberals.*  There
 was also a broadsheet called The Hidden Face o
 the Liberal Party which was wily distributed in
 a number of constituencies  including that of the
 Bodmin Liberal Paul TyZer.#  Tyler said that
 there was a lot of speculation at the time as to
 how the addresses were obtained.  This broadsheet
 was published by Geoffrey Stewart-Smith's Foreign
 Affairs Publishing Co.2  Its content was mainly
 concerned with identifying the Liberals with var-
 ious forms of political violence and terrorism
 and proving that the driving forces behind the
 party were politically ultra-left-wing and not
 the moderate ones the Liberal manifesto was pro-
 moting.
 Gordon Winter returned to South Africa the day
 before the 1974 British General Election.  The
 circumstances were as strange as those surround-
 ing his deportation from that country in the
 1960s.  For a time he worked again on the Johan-
 nesburg Sunday Express and then left to join The
 Citizen, the paper created and funded covertly by

 South Africa's intelligence agency BOSS.

 the Department of Information.  In the wake of
 Muldergate, he fled South Africa and went into
 hiding.  In a television interview on London
 Weekend TV on 29 June 1979 he told part of his
 story and hinted at more to come.
 LINKS BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF
 CONFLICT AND FWF
 The links between the new Institute for the
 Study of Conflict and the old Forum World Fea-
 tures were strong ones.  Not only Brian Crozier
 but Forum's managing director lain Hamilton left
 to become ISC's Director of Studies and the Forum
 Library went with them. ISC has a 10-man Council
 which includes Sir Robert Thompson, the counter-
 insurgency expert, Vice-Admiral Louis de Bailly,
 former Director-General of Intelligence at the
 Ministry of Defence 1972-1975, Sir Edward Peck,
 former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Commit-
 tee, and Professors Max Beloff and Leonard
 Schapiro.  The Institute's full-time fund-raiser
 is another general who is described as a Defence
 Services Consultant.  He is Major-General Ling,
 who has been on the staff since the early days.
 According to a background paper prepared by State
 Research in October 1977, the ISC operates by of-
 fering its 'technical expertise' on 'subversion'
 and on 'communist influence' to official bodies -
 including the military, the police, other govern-
 ment bodies and business.  Its contacts in the
 public service and business have helped it re-
 cruit the 2,000 or so subscribers who make up the
 bulk of the t 30,000-plus annual budget which it
 uses.  However, ISC's technical expertise brings
 with it, says State Research, a highly political
 line.  Its anti-communism extends not only to so-
 cialists and radicals, but to all social demo
 crats and liberals.  Those who favour progressive
 changes or seem to be 'soft' on 'communism' are
 in their eyes fellow-travellers.  In its own pro-
 spectus the jargon used is 'the defence of free
 industrial societies against totalitarian en-
 croachments' and the field covered includes 'sub-
 version, particularly in industry and all system-
 atic attempts to undermine society, in the uni-
 versities, Parliament, government and other
 fields'.
 One of the ISC's conflict studies in 1979 was
 called 'World Council of Churches Programme to
 Combat Racism'.  It was commissioned from Canon
 George Austin, a member of the Church of England
 General Synod since 1970.  He has made at least
 two visits to South Africa as an official guest

 of the government, as he freely admits.  In his
 essay on the WCC he demands that 'it must turn
 with some urgency away from the path of conflict,
 confrontation and non-acceptance of dissent and
 renew its.. .ministry of reconciliation'.  Canon
 Austin's analysis seems to have fallen on deaf
 ears.  It raised no significant debate and its
 conclusions have been overtaken by events.
 'Conflict Studies' are significant in that vir-
 tually a whole edition will find its way onto the
 files of dozens of board rooms, ministries and
 information-gathering organizations, becoming
 perhaps the only reference work consulted.  Thus
 a set of ready-made opinions or prejudices are
 ccnvenier,tly at hand for future decision-makers.
 The four-figure print run of each paper is auto-
 matically distributed by subscription.
 The ISC has close ties with the Freedom Asso-
 ciation.  Brian Crozier was one of the people who
 signed the National Association of Freedom (its
 former name) articles of association when it was
 founded and he and Sir Robert Thompson are mem-
 bers of their Council.  Robert Moss, a former
 director of NAF, is a close associate of Crozier.
 Moss wrote recently in Free Nation that the ISC
 was 'the most valuable research centre on subver-
 sion and communism in Western Europe'.  Crozier
 writes regularly for The Free Nation. Both orga-
 nizations maintain links with other similar-mind-
 ed bodies such as Aims for Freedom and Enterprise
 - now Aims,3 the Economic League and Common
 Cause.
 The Freedom Association is a pressure group
 which sets out to campaign on a non-party politi-
 cal basis for the 'preservation of freedom in the
 United Kingdom' but in effect plays exclusively
 on the instruments and with the tunes of the
 ultra-right.  Its monthly (once fortnightly) pa-
 per The Free Nation carries a regular feature
 Pulpit Watch and in the issue of 25 May 1979 car-
 ried a mud-slinging article attacking Christian
 Aid, echoing the phraseology and arguments of the
 Christian Affirmation Campaign.
 The Free Nation has more than once carried ad-
 vertisements for the Christian League of South-
 ern Africa and these adverts have been Photo-
 statted by the CLSA and circulated in their  own
 mailings as warranty of their acceptability in
 respectable political circles. Earlier issues of
 The Free Nation contained articles attacking  the
 World Council of Churches. The December 1978 is-
 sue, for instance, included selected extracts
 from the General Synod of the Church of England
 headed 'The Church is Condoning Murder'. There
 was also a review of The Bear at the Back Door
 one of the publications of the Foreign Affairs
 Publishing Co., an article on the 'leftwards
 leaning' charity war on Want and a puff for the
 1979 BBC Reith lectures by Edward Norman which
 attacked the politics of compassion.
 Previous director of the NAF was Robert Moss,
 who has spoken frequently in favour of authori-
 tarian dictatorship  in Britain,4 is a staunch
 supporter of the Chilean Junta Zed by General
 Pinochet and a former speech writer for Margaret
 Thatcher. He has written several books with anti-
 communist themes and contributed 'conflict stud-
 ies' for fellow Australian Brian Crozier's ISC.
 As a journalist he writes 'Foreign Report' for
 the prestigious Economist and also contributes a
 Monday morning column to the Daily Telegraph.
 Moss and Crozier are members of what the press
 have come to regard as the New Right, along with
 Edward Norman and other academics of the Peter-
 house Set - the group of Cambridge scholars who
 urge the virtues of possessive individualism and
 the gospel of anti-collectivism across a range of
 disciplines, and the Milton Friedman school of
 economists known as the Chicago Boys, whose mone-
 tary theories General Pinochet applied Zike a
 scourge to the problems of post-AZZende Chile and
 which are now, in an adapted form, being applied
 to Britain.
 Another former director of the Freedom Associa-
 tion was John Gouriet who, apart from supporting
 the management of Grunwick in its struggle with
 the unions had previously challenged, in the
 courts, a boycott of the South African regime by
 the British Postal Workers Union. On 8 February
 1977, in the midst of this controversy, the Club
 of Ten, a mysterious group of South African busi-
 nessmen, placed a quarter-page advertisement in
 the London Daily Telegraph which challenged  Tom
 Jackson, the secretary of the Postal Workers
 Union, to announce a boycott of postal and tele-
 graphic services to the Soviet Union, East Germa-
 ny and Angola. The Club of Ten, which was later
 revealed as a front organization of the South Af-
 rican Government, occupied a suite of offices
 (Suite 66) in the same building as the NAF (Suite
 63).
 THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION (FARI)
 Both the Institute for the Study of Conflict
 and the Freedom Association have links with  the
 Foreign Affairs Research Institute (FARI). This
 is the body founded by Geoffrey Stewart-Smith in

 FARI has in the past arranged several visits of
 prominent people to South Africa on behalf of the
 South Africa Freedom Foundation or the Foreign

 Telegraph, 25 March 1979, Lord Chalfont was one
 of them. Sir Frederic Bennett, talking to Guard-

 many times by the South African Government to
 suggest names of MPs  who might want to go to

 one of his contacts, and Professor Nic Rhoodie,
 who had invited him to lecture in South Africa at

 Another and important piece of collaboration
 was the conference held at-Brighton in June 1978
 jointly sponsored by the ISC, FART, Aims for
 Freedom and Enterprise and the American National
 Strategy Information Centre. The South African
 director of the Foreign Affairs Association, C.F.
 de Villiers, was present, as was Admiral James
 Johnson, a former head of the South African Navy,
 plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Penn and Gideon Roos of
 the South African Institute of International Af-

 nist organization to be financed by private com-
 panies. The strong participation of the South Af-
 ricans and their backina of at least one of the
 conference sponsors was aimed at influencing NATO
 military personnel and governments to stand by
 South Africa and harden their line on the Soviet
 Union. In an attempt to make the occasion an his-
 toric one, the conference issued The Brighton
 Declaration  which stated: 'The destruction of
 the CIA and other assaults on Western inteZZi-
 gence sources make it imperative that the US and
 its allies should again take the initiative on
 intelligence, information and counter-
 intelli-gence.'
 THE NATIONAL STRATEGY INFORMATION CENTRE
 The American sponsor of the Conference, the Na-
 tional Strategy Information Centre (NSIC),* has
 since its foundation in 1962 been a key cold war
 institution. It has supplied money and expertise
 to the extreme right in Britain. For instance, it
 provided money to enable the ISC to publish its
 Annual of Power and Conflict. In addition, the
 minutes of the ISC's council meeting of 21 Janu-
 ary 1972 noted that the NSIC was covering the
 salary of a research assistant plus advertising
 and printing costs of the Annual.
 The NSIC committee is closely linked to the
 Committee on the Present Danger (CPD),** an
 American group of prominent supporters of an in-
 terventionist US foreign policy which became ac-
 tive very soon after President Carter's election
 in 1976. The CPD has strong affiliations with
 A background paper titled 'Labour's Transatlan-
 tic Links' in State Research Bulletin No.16, Feb-
 ruary 1980, shows that these influences have now
 been brought to bear on the right wing of the
 British Labour Party, as part of a widespread co-
 vert campaign for greater arms spending and mili-
 tant anti-communism. One of the chosen vehicles
 for this is a monthly newsletter, the Labour and
 Trade Union Press (LTUPS) which is seen as con-
 tinuing the old CIA-backed Congress of Cultural
 Freedom and the work of the Forum World Features
 in the 1960s.
 When State Research  wrote its paper on the ISC
 in 1978 it concluded that it was easy to over-es-
 timate the significance of the ISC since they
 were only a small group of individuals, though
 with good connections. 'It is also easy', the pa-
 per continued,  'to dismiss them simply because
 they are not part of the mainstream of the state
 and the economy. The ISC is important because of
 the present political context. The liberalization
 of the sixties has now been overtaken by a gener-
 al swing to the right, most clearly visible in
 the Conservative Party. The politics of the ISC,
 which would have been considered as extreme  ten-
 years ago, today find a receptive ear.'
 In 1980, however, it is clear that organiza-
 tions such as the NSIC in America and the people
 associated with it can no longer be treated as a
 fringe. They play a major role in American poli-
 tics and would like to extend their influence  to
 Britain. The swing to the right has brought them
 once more to the centre of power.

 Had the case gone to court, the ISC
 could have counted on bad publicity and

 pleased with the outcome.   It is a result
 that affects all investigative journal-

 reporter's questions about the memo by
 saying that VOA is "not a propaganda agen-
 cy."4 The day after this denial, however,
 Conkling stated that he was considering "a
 certain relaxation, or enhancement, of the
 foreign speaking activities, so that they
 [VOA broadcasters] may have a little more
 freedom to reach the people they under-
 stand in selecting the items they want to
 talk with them about and in 'transcultu-
 rizing' the way they talk with them."5
 Conkling was advocating a return to the
 practice of allowing broadcasters - par-
 ticularly Eastern European exiles - to in-
 fuse their broadcasts with their own stri-
 dent, adversary attitudes. It was precise-
 ly to curtail this practice that Congress
 legislated in 1976 that the VOA was re-
 quired to broadcast "accurate, objective
 and comprehensive" news.
 Conkling sought to minimize the impor-
 tance of the Nicolaides memo, telling the
 Post that: "I didn't buy any of that...
 that is not the reason I hired him."6 Yet,
 it is clear from the memo that Conkling
 solicited the recommendations from
 Nicolaides, and Conkling did appoint
 Nicolaides after receiving and filing the
 memo. Conkling also said that the memo was
 "stolen" from his office - reflecting the
 prevalent attitude in the Reagan adminis-
 tration that government information is
 private property.
 VOA employees are now circulating a pe-
 tition asking Conkling to disassociate
 himself from Nicolaides' views and to can-
 cel his appointment. Recently-fired VOA
 Deputy Director William Haratunian circu-
 lated a farewell memo saying that "the ab-
 sence of mutual trust between political
 appointees and professional broadcasters
 has created an adverse atmosphere at VOA.
 This risks damaging VOA's credibility, and
 therefore its ability to serve as a truly
 national voice of our country."7
 Haratunian is being replaced by Conkling-
 appointee Terrence Catherman, a National
 War College graduate who served with the
 U.S. Information Agency (now the Interna-
 tional Communication Agency) at the height
 of its Cold War propagandizing. Another
 USIA careerist, Charles Courtney, has been
 appointed to the newly-created post of De-
 puty Director for Policy and Programs.
 Courtney's role, according to Conkling, is
 to "Judiciously apply the policy that ob-
 viously goes with our program." The re-
 cently announced plan  to change the name
 58 -- CounterSpy -- Feb. - ApriZ 1982
 of VOA's parent agency from International
 Communication Agency back to its Cold War
 name, the United States Information Agen-
 cy, provides a telling symbol of the VOA's
 current reversion to its hard-line past.
 Equally telling is the recent creation
 of the New Directions Advisory Committee
 by ICA Director Charles Wick (whose office
 employed Nicolaides just before he went to
 VOA)., The new Committee is in addition to
 the statutory advisory panel, the U.S. Ad-
 visory Commission on Public Diplomacy.
 Wick did not consult with the Advisory
 Comm ission before creating the new Commit-
 tee.   Its members are: Norman Podhoretz,
 editor of Commentary magazine; Gertrude
 Himmelfarb, Commentary contributor whose
 husband Irving Kristol is also a Commenta-
 _EY contributor; Evron Kirkpatrick, resi-
 dent fellow at the conservative American
 Enterprise Institute and husband of Jeane
 Kirkpatrick; Robert Nisbet; Bayard Rustin;
 and Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of the
 ultra-right Heritage Foundation. All Com-
 mittee members share a staunch anti-commu-
 nism and Podhoretz, Kirkpatrick, and
 Rustin, willingly or unwittingly, were in-
 volved in CIA-connected propaganda and la-
 bor operations. Podhoretz and Kirkpatrick
 have been recipients of CIA money and
 Kirkpatrick's Operations Policy Research,
 Inc. was involved in the improper domestic
 dissemination (through USIA) of CIA-con-
 nected publications. Podhoretz,   Rustin
 and Kirkpatrick have never disavowed or
 disassociated themselves from this opera-
 tion. The purpose of the new Committee,
 according to Wick, is to "identify world-
 wide intellectual trends" and to evaluate
 private research on "long-term intellectu-
 al currents in the world."9

 CounterSpy Statement of Purpose:   The United States emerged from World War II as the
 world's dominant political and economic power. To conserve and enhance this power,
 the U.S. government created a variety of institutions to secure influence over "free
 world" nations which supply U.S. corporations with cheap labor, raw materials, and
 markets. A number of these institutions, some initiated jointly with allied Western
 European governments, have systematically violated the fundamental rights and free-
 doms of people in this country and the world over. Prominent among these creations
 was the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), born in 1947.
 Since 1973, Counterspy  magazine has exposed and analyzed such intervention in
 all its facets: covert CIA operations, U.S. interference in foreign labor movements,
 U.S. aid in creating foreign intelligence agencies, multinational corporation-intel-
 ligence agency link-ups,  and World Bank assistance for counterinsurgency, to name
 but a few.   Our view has been that while CIA operations have been one of the most in-
 famous forms of intervention, the CIA is but one strand in a complex web of inter-
 ference and control.
 Our motivation for publishing Counterspy is two-fold:
 --- People in the U.S. have the right and need to know the scope and nature of
 their government's abrogation of U.S. and other citizens' rights and liberties be-
 cause it is these people who will change the institutions.
 --- People of other nations, often denied access to information, can better
 protect their own rights and bring about necessary change when equipped with such
 information.
