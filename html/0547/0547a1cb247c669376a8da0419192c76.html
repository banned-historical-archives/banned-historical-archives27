COLA. Chief Tells House 
Of $8-Million Campaign 
Against Allende in '70-73 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7?The 
ldirector of the Central 
,Intelli-
gence Agency has told Congress 
that the Nixon Administration ; 
authorized more than $8-million 
for covert activities , by the 
agency in Chile between 1970 
and 1973 to make it impossible 
for President Salvador Allende 
Gossens to govern. 
The goal of the clandestine 
C.I.A. activities, the director, 
William E. Colby, testified at a 
top-secret hearing last April, 
was to "destabilize" the Marx-
ist Government of .President 
Allende, who was elected in 
1970. 
The Allende Government was 
overthrown in a Violent coup 
d'etat last Sept. 11 in which the 
President died. The military 
'junta that seized per.-"er say he 
cortmitted suicide but his sup-
porters maintain that he was 
slain by the soldiers who at-
tacked the presidential' palace 
in Santiago. 
Intervention in '64 
? In his House testimony, Mr. 
Colby 'also disclosed that the 
Central Intelligence Agency first 
intervened against Dr. Allende 
in 1964, when he was a presi-
dential candidate running 
against Eduardo Frei Montalva 
of the Christian Democratic 
party, which had the support 
of the United States. ? 
The agency's operations, Mr. 
Colby testified, were considered 
a test of the technique of using 
heavy cash payments to bring 
down a governMent viewed as 
antagonistic toward the United 
States. However, there have 
been many allegations that the 
C.I.A. was, involved in similar 
activities in other countries be-
fore the election Of Dr. Allende. 
Mr. Colby also maintained 
that all of the agency's opera-
tions against the Allende Gov-
ernment were approved in ad-
vance ,by the 40 Committee in 
Washington, a secret high-level 
intelligence panel headed by 
Secretary of State Kissinger. 
The 40 Committee was set up 
by President Kennedy in an at-
'tempt to provide Administra-
tion control over C.I.A. activi-
fties after Cuban exiles trained 
and' equipped by the agency 
failed in their invasion of Cuba 
In 1961. Appro 
' Details of the agency's in-
volvement in Chile were firsts 
provided by Mr. Colby to the 
House Armed Services Subcom-
mittee of Intelligence, headed 
by Representative Lucien N. 
Nedzi, Democrat of Michigan, 
at a special one-day hearing 
last April 22. The testimony 
was .later made available to, 
Representative Michael J. Har-
rington, a liberal Massachusetts 
Democrat who has long been 
a critic of the C.I.A. Harrington 
wrote other members of Con-
gress six weeks ago to protest 
both the agency's clandestine 
activities and the failure of the 
Nixon Administration to ack-
nowledge them despite repeated. 
inquiries from Congress. A cop. 
of a confidential seven-page 
letter sent by Mr. Harrington 
to Representative Thomas E. 
Morgan, chairman of the House, 
Foreign Affairs Committee, was 
made available to. The New 
York Times. 
The testimony of Mr. Colby 
indicates 'that high officials in 
the State Department and 
White House repeatedly and 
deliberately misled the public 
and the Congress about the 
extent of United States involve-
ment in the internal affairs of 
Chile during the 6-me-year 
government of Dr. Allende. 
Shortly after Dr. Allende 
won a plurality in the presiden-
tial elections in September, 
1970, high Chilean officials 
told newsmen, as,a dispatch in 
The New York Times reported 
then, that the "United States 
lacks political, economic or mil-
itary leverage to change the 
course of events in Chile, even 
if the Administration wished to 
do so." 
However, Mr. Colby testified 
that $500,000 was secretly au-
thorized by the 40 Committee 
in 1970 to help the anti-Allende 
forces. Another $500,000 had 
been provided to the same 
forces in 1969, Mr. Colby said. 
Mr. Allende's victory was ra-
tified by the Chilean Congress' 
in October, 1970, and the State's 
Department later declared 'thati 
the Administration had 'firmly 
rejected" any attempt to blockl 
his inauguration. J 
But Mr. Colby testified that 
$350,000 had been authorized 
by the 40 Committee in an un-
successful effort to bribe mem-
bers of the Chilean Congress. 
The bribe was part of a much 
more complicated scheme in-
tended to overturn the results, 
of the election,' Mr. Colby tes-
tified; but the over-all plan, al-
TOCOOrkilOPMil 
rejected as unworkable. " 
Whilethe Central Intelligence 
Agency was conducting these 
'clandestine operations, there 
were reductions- in United 
States foreign-aid grants to 
Chile .in development bank 
loans and in lines of credit 
from American commercial 
banks. Commodity credits for 
vitally needed grain purchases 
also were restricted. 
United States officials have 
declared that there was no 
Over-all Administration 'pro-
gram designed to limit eco-
nomic did to Ithe Allende 
Government, but critics have 
noted that large-scale loans'' 
and aid are now going to Chile. 
President Allende repeatedly 
complained about what he told 
the United Nations in Decem-
e.xternal pressure to cut us off 
our economy and paralyzetra 
from the world, to strangle our 
economy and paralyze trade 
and to deprive us of access to 
sources of international ft-
- nancing." 
Colby Declines Conunent 
Mr. Colby acknowledged in 
a brief telephone conversation 
this week ,that he had testified 
before the Nedzi' intelligence 
subcommittee about the C.I.A.'s 
involvement in Chile, but, he 
refused to' comment on the Har-
rington letter. 
Mr. Nedzi, contacted in Mu-
nich, West Germany, where he 
is on an inspection trip with 
other members of the House 
Armed Services Committee, 
also declined to comment. 
Mr. Harlington noted in his 
letter that he had been permit-
ted to read the 48-page tran-
script of Mr. Colby's testimony 
two times, apparently without 
taking notes. "My memory 
must serve here as ? the only 
source for the substance of, 
the testimony," he wrote. 
A number of high-ranking 
Government officials subse-
quently confirmed the details 
of the C.I.A.'s involvement as 
summarized by the Massachu-
setts Representative, a liberal - 
who has long been a critic of ' 
the agency's policies. 
In 1964, Mr. Colby 'testified,: 
some American corporations in 
Chile volunteered to serve as 
conduits for anti-Allende funds, 
but the proposal was rejected. 
A similar' proposal in 1970 led 
to a widely publicized Senate 
hearing las tyear. ? 
The C.I.A. director also said 
that after Dr. Allende's 'election, 
$5-million was authorized by 
the 40 Committee for more "de-
stabilization" efforts in 1971, 
1972 and 1973. An additional 
$1.5-million was provided to aid 
anti-Allende candidates in mu-
nicipal elections last year. rington wrote. He added, how-

In hi  
A specific request earlier in 
Ithese operktions was 'direct, 
though nOt to the point of iden-
tifying 'actual. contacts and 
conduits," Mr.,' Harrington 
added. 
One fully informed _official, 
told of The New York Times's 
intention to publish an account 
of the clandestin4 C.I.A. ac-
tivities in Chile, declared, 
"This thing calls for balanced 
reporting to put the blaine 
where it should be laid." 
"The agency didn't do any-
thing without the knowledge 
and consent of the 40 commit-
tee," he said. pointedly adding 
that the committee was headed 
by Mr. Kissinger, who was then 
serving as President Richard M. 
Nixon's National Security Ad-
viser. 
_ 
Secrecy Called Necessary 
Another Government official 
similarly defended the C.I.A.'s 
role in funneling fund into 
Chile and the agency's subse-
quent denials of any such 'ac-
tivities. "You have a straight 
out policy that the United 
States conducts covert action 
on an officially authorized ba-
is," he said. "If you do such 
things, obviously you're not go-
ing to say anything about it." 
"On this kind of covert ac-
'tion," the official added; "it's 
up to those asked to do it to do 
it secretly." . 
Mr. Kissinger; although fully 
informed of The Times's ac-
count through an aide, did not 
respond.', . 
A number of officials whose 
information about such activi-
ties has been accurate in the 
past declared in interviews this 
week ,that there was a sharp 
split between some State De-
partment officials and Mr. Kis-
Singer over the 40 Committee's 
Chile policy. 
Kissinger,'s Comment 
In his only public comment 
on the Allende coup, Mr. Kis-' 
singer told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee last year: 
"The C.I.A. had 'nothing to do 
With the coup, to the best of 
my knowledge and belief, and 
I only put in that qualification 
in case some madman appears 
' down :there who without in-
-structions talkild to soniebody. 
I.have abSolutely no reason to 
'suppose it." 
, 'In his July" 18, 1974, letter to 
Representative , i Morgan, Mr. 
Harrington quoted Mr. Colby 
as:testifying that the 40 Com-
mittee authorized an expendi-
ture 14 $1-million for "further 
political destabilization" activi-
ties in August, 1973, one month

control in Santiago.

WASHINGTON POST 
09 September 1974 
lwas a pretty" firmview on the 
part of the 40 Committee 
which is Kissinger and nobody 
else?that the Allende Govern-
ment was bound to come to de-
struction and had to be thor-
oughly discrdited.". 
"The State Department sup-
ported this, but in a different 
way," the official recalled. "It 
wanted to stretch out any clan-
destine activities to permit the 
regime to come to a political 
end. 
"The argument was between 
those who wanted to use force 
and end it quickly rather than 
to play, it out. Henry was on 
the side of the former?he was 
for considerabl obstruction." 
All of the officials inter-
viewed, emphasized that the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
was not authorized to play any 
direct' role in the coup that 
overthrew Dr. Allende. It was 
also noted that- most of the 
subsequent denials of agency 
involvement in the internal af-
fairs of Chile were made in the 
context, of a direct, United 
States role in the overthrow. 
, "On most of those you have 
ito look at the language very 
!carefully," one official said of 
ithe denials. 
' 'Shortly after President Allen-
de's overthrow there were.am-
confirmed reports that the 
truckers' strike, which was a 
key element in the social chaos 
that preceded the coup, had 
been financed, at lease in part, 
by the C.I.A. ? 
At a closed hearing on Chile 
'before 'a House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee last October, Mr. 
Colby refused to rule out the 
possibility that some anti-
Allende demonstrations in Chile 
.may have been assisted through 
subsidiaries of United States 
corporations in Brazil or other 
Latin-American countries. 
He was sharply questioned 
about ,that ,, possibility bye Mr. 
Harrington who emerged dur-
ing Congressional debate' as a 
leading critic of the Adminis-
tration's Chilean policies. 
Representative Harrington, 
reached yesterday at his Mas-
iachusetts office, refused to 
discuss his letter to Mr. Mor-
gan, which he termed confi-
dential. Nor would he discuss 
!other aspects of-' the possible 
'American involvement in the 
.fall of President Allende. 
In his letter, Mr. Harrington 
complained about the "inherent 
limitations facing members of 
Congress in uncOvering the 
facts of covert activities such 
as those in Chile." 
He also expressed dismay 
that the Administration had 
authorized the Covert expendi-
ture of $1-million in August, 
1973, "without any apparent 
deterrent being posed by the re-
cently completed hearings into 
I.T.T. [International Telephone 
& Telegraph] involvement in 
Chile and the Senate Water-
gate committee's disclosur of 
C.I.A. activities related to 
Watergate." 
, A Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee concluded hear-
ings last April into what I.T.T. 
officials acknowledged was an 
attempt to contribute $1-million 
to the United States Govern-
ment for use by the Central .In-
telligence: Agency to create eco-
nomic. chaos in Chile. Testimony 
showed, that the offer was re-
jected after discussions that ap-
parently involved Mr. Kissinger 
and Richard M. Helms,'then di-
rector of the agency. , 
A number of high State De-: 
pertinent officials testified un--
der oath at those hearings that 
the United States was not mak-
ing any attempts to interfere 
with Chile's internal politics. 
Edward M. Korry, former 
Ambassador to Chile, declared: 
"The United States did not seek 
to pressure, subvert, influence 
a single member of the Chilean 
Congress at any time in the en-
tire four years of my stay. No 
hard line toward Chile was car-
ried out at any time." 
Charles A. Meyer, former As-
sistant Secretary of State for 
Latin-American Affairs, simila?-
ly testified that the United 
States scrupulously adhered' tb 
a policy of nonintervention. 
"We bought no votes, we fund-
ed no candidates, we promoted 
no coups," he said. 
Senator Frank Church, Deart 
arra of Idaho, who is chair-
man of the Subcommittee on 
Multinational Corporations,. 
could not be reached for com-
ment. The subcommittee's chief. 
counsel, Jerome I. Levinson, ex-
pressed anger today on hear-
ing of Mr. Colby's- testimony. 
"For me," he said, -"the funda-
mental issue now is who makes 
foreign policy in a democracy 
and by what standards and by 
what criteria?" ? 
Mr. Levinson said that the 
subcommittee had been "de-
liberately deceived" during its 
public hearings last year. 
In ? his letter, to Mr. Morgan, 
Mr. Harrington said that he 
hid turned to the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee chairman "as 
a last resort, having despaired 
,cif the likelihood of anything 
productive occurring as a,. re-
sult of the avenues I have al-
ready pursued." 
Mr. Harrington noted that 
the subcommittee on Inter-
American Affairs had held five 
hearings 'on human rights in 
Chile since the junta came to 
power, with testimony from 
only one State Departmerft wit-
ness with full knowledge of the 
clandestine C.I.A. activity. 
And that witness, Harry W.' 
Shlaildernan, a Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary of State for Inter-
American Affairs, refused to 
testify about agency activities, 
Mr. Harrington wrote. 
He' urged Mr. Morgan to call 
for a full-scale public investi-
gation of the Nixon Adminis-
tration's involvement in Chile: 
Mr. Morgan could not be 
reached for comment, nor 
could it be learhed whether he 
had responded to Mr. Harring? 
.ton's letter.

report from Washington that use against Allende. The Chi-
lean government printed a pa-

ITT documents released by 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency had alloc'ated $11 mil-

support anti-leftist political ac-
tion in Chile caused no excite-
ment here today. 
Reports of CIA financial in-
volvement in Chilean politics 
have been so persistent in the 
past 10 years that they- were 
accepted as fact by many Po-
litically aware Chileans Jong 
before a military coup de-
posed leftist President Salva-
dor Allende last year. , ? 
On this warm, sunny Sun-
day, no government official 
could be located to comment 
on the report. 
Radio stations did not men-
tion the report in their news 
broadcasts, although interna-
tional news agencies sent the 
news to their Chilean subscri-
bers. 
. There was no certainty that 
Santiago's government-con-
trolled newspapers would pub-
lish news of the report, 
, printed today in the United 
States on the basis of ? secret 
testimony before a congres-
sional committee by William 
Colby, the director of the CIA. 
As long ago as 1970, just af;; 
ter Allende was elected presi-
dent as the candidate of a left-
ist coalition, Chileans in the' 
upper levels of several politi-
cal parties believed - that for= 
eign funds had come into their, 
country at campaign time 
from several sources. 
Christian Democrate, then 
at the , end of six years in 
power under .. President, 
Eduardo Frei, admitted that: 
their party had been Sup-
ported by, Christian Demo:; 
-cratic parties in Germany and. 
Italy. The conservative Na--
tional, Party claimed that the 
left had received funds from 
Communist and Socialist par-, 
ties abroad. 
An executive of an Amen-
can tipper company in Santi-
egg. said ,privately that his 
company had contributed cam-
paign funds to non-leftist can-
didates in the campaign just 
ended. 
There was little evidence to 
connect the CIA with , Al-
lende's political opposition un-
til the disclosure in 1972 that 
the ITT conglomerate had of-
for the' halving and for the 
complete elimination of the 
Administration's request for 
more than $20-million in mill-, 
tary aid and training for Chile. 
[Washington columnist Jack , 
Anderson and later brought 
out a comic book version of 
the ITT conspiracy. - 
According to the transcript, 
of Colby's testimony cited bY' 
Thep. Michael Harrington (D-, 
Mass.) in his request for a con-
gressional investigation of 
CIA involvement in Chile; $5 
million for "politiqal destabili-
zation efforts" and $500,000 
for opposition politicians had 
',been authorzed between Al-, 
lende's election and 1972. In 
, Chile, rumors that CIA funds 
were being channeled to, the 
opposition grew that year. ? ? , 
! After .the nationalization' of 
American copper companies, 
large Chilean companies and, 
banks, Allende's economic poi-
ides began affecting the mid-,1

keepers and truck owners, 
then bureaucrats and profes-
sional men reacted with the 
first of two waves of ? strikes 
that were to spread civil un-
rest and economic disorder' 
through the country. 
The strike leaders denied, 
then, and -again during the 
strikes that preceded Al-
lende's downfall last year, act 
cusations from the left that 
they were being financed, by 
the CIA. However, ,this year, 
one of the men involved in or-
ganizing both series of strikes 
indicated . that. CIA funds, had 
been availqble.. ,

the shopkeepers' group 
through ttite 1972 and -,.1973 
strikes. 
"Friends I had from other 
organizations came back from 
abroad and asked us if we had 
got our share," he added. 
"They said the money had 
been allocated by the CIA for 
all the unions in the strike, 
and some of it should have 
gone to us."

Secretary of State Henry ' 
A. 1Cissinger presided over 
every meeting of the "40 
Committee" when the con- ? 
overt arm of the National Se-
curity Council authorized 
expenditure of millions of . 
dollars from 1970 to 1973 
against the election and 
rule of Chile's late Marxist . 
president Salvador Allende, 
U.S. officials said today. , 
;Kissinger was President 
Nikon's national security 
adviser in the period from ? 
1969 until late summer 1973 
when the "40" Committee"-
anthorized funds for indi-
miduals, anti-Allende politi-
cal; parties and news media 
inChile, these officials said. 
ram 1964 until 1973, the 
kn?tal authorization for 
clandestine operations 
4gainst the Marxist leader 
and his coalition of parties 
Was more than $8 Million. 
_,? 
:""He chaired every meet-
s 
ing:of the committee from 
the moment he came to 
town," an official said, add-
ing that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency did nothing ino 
Chile that the "40 Commit- i 
tee'.' had not authorized. 
:Spokesmen for Kissinger, ' 
who became secretary of 
skate last September'26 just 
15:days after the Chilean 
thilitary overthrew Allende, 
said the secretary . was 
aWare of the new disci?. 
shres but no comment was 
einected until today.. 
;THE INFORMED 
sources available to the . 
Star-News said not all of the 
mbney authorized for 
eimenditurc was used. The 
funds used to support anti-
Allende politicians, press 
and radio during the presi-
dential election of 1970, the 
congressional bi-election of 
1972 and to "destabilize" 
the Allende regime were cut 
off when it appeared in mid-
1973 that a military coup 
d'etat was imminent. 
These sources claimed 
that the CIN and the money 
made available to it played 
no role in supporting the 
armed forces uprising on 
Sept. 11, 1973, in which Al-
lende allegedly committed 
suicide when his La Moneda 
palace was attacked by the 
military rebels. Kissinger 
was testifying at his confir-
mation hearing before the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
,Committee at the height of 
the Sept. 11 fighting before 
collapse of the Allende gov-
ernment. . 
The anti-Allende deci-
sions Of the "40 Committee" 
and the CIA's role in carry-
ing them out were disclosed 
by CIA Director William E. 
Colby in secret testimony 
before the House Armed 
Services Subcommittee on 
Intelligence last April 22. 
The tenor of Colby's 'testi-
mony, made public over the 
weekend by the New York 
Times and Washington 
Post, was that the "40 Corn-
orriittee" targeted the funds 
.to prevent Allende's elec-
tion in 1964 and 1970 and to 
'destabilize" his govern-
ment after 1970.

of the money went to

FROM OUR SPAIN CORRESPONDENT 
If it's a really diiTerent holiday you. are 
looking for this summer, try the north-

'For the big news there. inGeneral Franco's 
native Galicia. is of wolves. Since the 
beginning of July, Galleito villagers have 
shot about 40 of them. Every day brings 
fresh accounts of sheep, calves and dogs 
being devoured and farmers chased up 
trees. The papers tell of panic and even 
"psychosis" in some areas. 
Zoologists are baffled. It's against all 
the rules, they say, for wolves to approach 
human settlements in summer. Perhaps, 
say local farmers, a new wolf generation 
is emerging that doesn't respect rules. 
Some people suspect a publicity stunt 
for one of those English horror-films. 
Strangely, no one has yet blamed the . ? 
Frei in 1964, the campaign 
of conservative National 
Party leader Arturo Ales-
sandri in 1970 and subse-
quent "destabilization" ef-
forts. Frei won the 1964 
? campaign but Allende led a 
three-man race in 1970 with 
less than two percentage 
points, or 36 percent of the 
vote, over Allessandri. 
Subsequently, Allende was. 
named president by the Chi-
lean Congress in a runoff 
vote in which the CIA funds 
? were liberally employed 
among Chilean politicians 
and press and radio outlets. 
MANY DETAILS of 
Colby's testimony appear in 
a letter written by Rep. 
Michael J. Harrington, D-
Mass., to House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee chairman 
Thomas E. Morgan, D-Pa. 
Harrington'S letter appears 
for further hearings on the 
CIA role against Allende. 
CIA spokesmen' said the 
agency had nothing to do 
with the revolution. 
But Colby's candid testi-
mony to the House commit-
tee was taking place last 
April while the Senate For-
eign Relations subcommit-
tee on multinational corpo-
rations was hearing sworn 
declarations from U.S. offi-
cials that Washington's 1970 
election policy in Chile was 
one of non-intervention. 
Both former Ambassador 
Edwin M. Korry and Assist-
ant Secretary of State 
Charles A. Meyer swore 
that the United States did 
nothing to pressure politi-
cians or buy anti-Allende 
votes. The Senate hearing 
brought testimony that the 
CIA .with a mysterious sea-wolf?the 
3,000-ton yacht Apollo. which potters 
around the 'coasts of Spain, Portugal and' 
Morocco heavily laden with cpmmunica-
tions.gadgetry. It flies a Panamanian flag 
and belongs to something called ? the 
OperatioaTransport Corporation. 
The Apollo was anchored off Lisbon 
during Portugal's coup in April, and sub-
sequently the liberal Portuguese weekly 
Expresso alleged that the yacht was in the 
service of the CIA. The Spanish monarch-
ist daily ABC then revealed -that the 
Spaniards have been watching the boat 
closely since 1969, when it allegedly 
strayed into Spanish "naval waters". 
souler Spanish paper repo:led that the 
Apollo called at a part in A id.ulusL the 
day after Admiral Carrero Blanco was 
assassinated. It coupled this with the 
coincidental and unconfirmed information 
that Spanish security men had discovered 
lien ei 
oyes 
'International Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. and the CIA 
discussed plans for expendi-
ture of $I million in the 1970 
election but denials that the 
plan was ever carried out. 
' The general posture of 
the State Department in the 
? 1969-1973 period was that it 
'would be better for the 
United States to adopt a 
hands-off attitude toward 
Chile on the theory that Al-
lende and his Marxist coali-
tion would be so destructive 
of the national economy as 
to preclude any chance of 
another electoral victory 
there. Kissinger was quoted 
in this period as observing 
ironically that, "Chile is a 
dagger pointed at the heart 
of Antarctica." - 
KISSINGER testified at 
his confirmation hearing 
'that the CIA had nothing to 
do with the coup last Sep-
tember. Other sources inde-
pendent of Kissinger have 
supported the claim that the 
Coup was launched by the 
Chilean military without 
cooperation or prior knowl-
edge of the U.S. govern-
ment or the CIA. 
But before the coup, offi-
cials say there was a strong 
,division between Kissinger 
' in the White House and the 
? , State Department on what 
ought to be done about 
Chile. 
?,Kissinger was pbrtrayea.

VE NEW YORK TIMES, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1974 
Hearings Urged on C.1 .A.' s Role in Chile! 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
' speeiaito The New York Times 
'BEVERLY, Mass., Sept. 
Representative Michael J. Har-
rington called ioday for full-
scale public 'hearings into the 
central intelligence agency's 
clandestine operations against 
the Government of President 
Salvador Allende Gossens of 
Chile. 
In an interview at his home 
here, Mr. Harrington said he 
would formally request the 
House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee, of which he is a member, 
to surnmon Secretary of State 
Kissinger and William E. Colby, 
Director of Central Intelligence, 
to testify about the Chilean 
policy of the United States. 
The New York Times reported 
today that Mr. Colby told a 
House.committee in April that 
the C.I.A. was Authorized to 
spend more than $8-million 
clandestinely from 1970 to 1973 
in an effort to make it impos-
sible for President Allende to 
govern. The Allende Govern-
ment was overthrown in a vio-
lent military coup on Sept. 11, 
.1973, in which the Chilean 
leader died. . ? 
' Kissinger's Kole 
In calling ?for hearings, Mr.. 
Harrington declared that one I 
reason senior officials in Con-
gress were reluctant to investi-I 
gate Chilean policy was what i 
he termed a "disinclination" to: 
turn up facts that might reflect, 
adversely on Mr. Kissinger. 
"Without knowing anything 
at all about Mr. Kissinger's role 
in all of this," Mr. Harrington 
said, "Congress is hesitating 
because of fear that they'll run 
into Kissinger." 
"It's 'obvious to me," he 
added, "that the role played by 
Kissinger is going to be of 
significance in the evaluation 
of how the policy toward Chile 
evolved. But there's a disin-
clination in Congress to even 
get into some areas that might 
peripherally damage or embar-
rass Kissinger." 
In his testimony before a 
House subcommittee on intelli-
gence last April 22, Mr. Colby 
noted that all of the C.I.A.'s 
efforts against President Al-
lende were directly *approved 
by the 40 committee, a? high-
level intelligence review com-
mittee that has been headed by 
Mr.. Kissinger since the begin-
?;ning of the Nixon Administra-
tion in early 1969. 
"We're not going to undo 
what happened in Chile," Mr. 
Harrington said today, "but we 
must examine the role of -the 
intelligence community in for-
eign policy.. 
"When you look at the Colby 
testimony, you'll see that the 
notion of Congressional over-
sight of the C.I.A. is passive, 
bystandish, totally ineffective." 
Mr. Harrington's public call 
today for hearings was his lat-
est in a series of attempts, 
'most of them in private, to 
force senior Members of, the 
Senate and House to begin a 
review of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency's Chilian policy. 
? The C.I.A. report published 
today was based in part on a 
'confidential seven-page letter 
Mr. _Harrington wrote in mid-
July to Representative Thomas 
E. Morgan, chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee, in which Mr. Colby's testi-
mony was summarized. The 
Times received a copy of the 
letter from an outside source. 
Mr. Harrington said today 
that he had sent a similar let-
ter to Senator 3. W. ,Fulbright, 
chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In his letter to Mr. Morgan, 
Mr. Harrington complained that 
he had discussed Mr. Colby's 
testimony with other members 
of the committee and con-
cluded that there would be no 
,"further investigations or hear-
ings into the broader policy 
questions that such activities 
!pose," 
So far, Mr. Harrington said 
;today, Mr. Morgan has refused 
to permit such hearings, argu-
ing that the Foreign Affairs 
Committee does not have the 
authority to pursue questions 
of C.I.A. activities. . 
"Kissinger and colhy should 
testify," Mr. Haaington main-
tained. "It's just inane to sug-
gest that a foreign affairs com-
mittee has no authority to 
;conduct such hearings." 
Mr. Harrington refused to 
characterize Mr. Fulbright's re-
sponse to his letter, but a Sen-
ate source said later tbday that 
the Arkansas Democrat had 
told the Congressman that he 
could see "no useful purpose" 
in reopening the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee hearings into 
Chile. 
"What this really means," 
the Senate source said, "is that 
he doesn't want to take Kis-
singer on head on because it 
could mean exposing the fact 
that Kissinger himself was the 
man who controlled and direct-
ed the policy of using covert 
action to make it impossible 
for Allende to govern." 
. Mr. Harrington, a liberal 
Democrat who was first elected 
to Congrks in 1969, praised 
Mr. Colby's testimony as "The 
most direct, unambiguous and 
to the point I've ever seen." 
He was permitted to review 
the still classified 48-page Chil-
ean transcript in June by Rep-
resentative Lucien M. Nedzi, 
chairman of the House Armed 
Services subcomthittee on in-
telligence. 
Mr. Harrington recalled to-
day that his initial reaction 
after reaclIng the account was 
one of ."profound shock." 
"I did not expect to see the 
docunientation of theories I 
hadn't held mystelf," he said. 
"I'd never subscribed to the 
conspiracy theories' about the 
United States' involvement in 
the disintegration of the Al-
lende Government." 
"Colby's testimony may have 
been matter-of-fact," Mr. Har-
rington added, "but it also was 
almost clinical?as if you had 
a well-trained surgeon called 
in to describe procedures. You 
didn't get the feeling that then, 
was any element of right or 
wrong that .went into the deci-
sions about what to do."

Star-News Staff Writer 
Sen. Frank Church, chair-
man of the Foreign Rela-
tions subcommittee on mul-
tinational corporations, is 
expected to reopen hearings 
on U.S. clandestine opera-
tions in Chile following dis-
closure that the so-called 
"40 Committee" of the Na-
tional Security Council 
authorized expenditure of 
millions of dollars against 
the late Marxist Salvador 
Allende between 1964 and 
1973. 
Church is expected by 
Capitol Hill sources to-con-
fer with other subcommit-
tee members and staff to 
decide what to do about dis-
crepancies in the testimony 
given before several com-
mittees on Chile by officials 
of the State Department 
and the CIA. 
One Senate source said, 
"Someone obviously has 
been lying about the U.S. 
role in Chile." Several offi-
cials indicated Church is 
virtually certain to order an 
immediate investigation by 
the subcommittee staff and 
follow that up by reopening 
the hearings. Church could 
not be reached for com-
ment. 
CIA DIRECTOR William 
E. Colby testified last April 
that The "40 Committee," 
chaired by Henry A. Kiss-
inger, who is now secretary 
of state; authorized expen-
diture of nearly .$11 million 
by the CIA to subsidize 
*news media and politicians 
against Allende in 1964 and 
again in the 1970 election 
period to bar his ascenden-
cy to the presidency. 
Colby also testified in se-
cret session before a House 
Armed Services Committee 
that funds were authorized 
as late as the summer of 
1973 to "destabilize" the re-
gime of Allende. 
But at the same time last 
April, then-Asst. Secretary 
of State for Inter-American 
Affairs Charles A. Meyer , 
told the Church subcommit-
tee under oath that the: 
4 
United States- pursued a 
policy of nonintervention in 
Chilean affairs during the 
-Allende period. His succes-
sor, Jack B. Kubisch, now 
ambassador to Greece, and 
Deputy Asst. Secretary 
Harry Shlaudeman gave 
similar testimony to House 
committees. 
(An official familiar with 
Meyer's testimony told 'the 
Star-News the former 
assistant secretary attend- - 
ed some meetings of the "40 
Committee!' but that the 
State Department's repre-
sentative was U. Alexis 
Johnson. This official said, 
Meyer gave "scrupulously 
honest" answers at the 
Church subcormnittee hear-
ings but was not asked 
questipns that would have 
required replies acknowl-
edging what the United 
States was doing- in Chile in 
the 1970 electoral period. 
Neither did he volunteer 
information which would 
have brought the matter to 
light. 
(The U.S. funds were 
used to support anti-Allende 
political ,parties and the. 
-anti-Mlende newspaper, El 
Mercurio; But Myer was 
,not asked specifically aboixf-
'these, enterprises, the offi-
cial , said. Meyer's state-
ment that the United States 
"bought no votes, ftuided no 
candidates and promoted no 
coups" was literally accu-
.rate.) 
KISSINGER'S only 
known testimony on inter-
vention in Chile was given 
before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee last 
September during his con-
firmation hearings. He 
denied that the United 
States played any role in 
the coup d'etat of last Sept. 
11 but apparently was not 
asked about previous covert 
activities against Allende. 
However, U.S. sources said 
'yesterday Kissinger pre-
sided over every meeting of

tion yesterday as to wheth-
er Kissinger saw any 
inconsistency in his role as

mittee" and as secretary of

eign policy. Anderson gave 
reporters a list of the mem- I 
bership of the "40 Commit-
tee" and said that all deci- ' 
sions of the committee-are 
unanimous. Further, he 
said,. all "40 Committee"

WASHINGTON POST 
10 September 1974 
By Laurence Stern., 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
The State Department 
found itself in the center of a 
growing congressional, furor 
yesterday over the disclosure 
that some $11 million in U.S. 
funds had been authorized for 
covert political action against 
the late Chilean president, 
Salvador Allende. ? In the face of new 'charges 
;that it misled Congress on the 
Issue of U.S: intervention in 
Chile, a State Department 
spokesman yesterday stood by 
sworn testimony of officials 
on Capitol Hill that . the 
United States pursued a policy 
of non-intervention during the 
Allende period. . 
The new round of contro-
versy over U.S. policy on 
Chile was triggered by the dis-
closure Sunday that CIA Di"-
rector William E. Colby se-

. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
.(I)-Mass.), chairman of a Sen-1 
ate Refugee sttbcommittee 
which is investigating human 
rights violations in Chile, said 
yesterday that the disclosure. 
of CIA funding of Allende's. 
opposition "represents. not 
only a flagrant violation -Of 
our alleged policy of non-inter-
vention in Chilean affairs but 
also an appalling lack of forth-
rightneSs-with the Congress." 
He noted that covert politi; 
eal funding, such as was ac-, 
knowledge d by Colby,' "has 
been denied time and time 
again by high officials of the 
Nixon and now Ford adminis-. ? 
tration." 
Kennedy called for full con,' 
gressional investigation of the 
Aiscrepancies in the official' 
versions of what the United' 
States did in Chile during the 
Allende period. 
Jerome Levinson, counsel 
for the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee's multina-i 
tional corporations suhcorn--. 
mittee, said "there is no doubt. 
that we were misled" by State 
Department witnesses who 
testified last year that the 
United States had not Under-' 
taken covert activities against 
Allende. 
Levinson said he will raise 
the issue of whether the sub-1

The former Assistant Secre-
tary of State for Inter-Ameri-
can Affairs, Charles A. Meyer, 
gave sworn testimony to the 
subcommittee March 29, 1973, 
that "the policy of the govern-
ment ... was that there would 
be no intervention in the polit-

financed no candidates, no po-
litical parties...." ? ? ? j 
Last June 12 Acting Assist-
ant Secretary of State Harry 
Shlaudeman told a House For-
eign Affairs subcommittee-1 
"Despite pressures to the con-
trary the ,U.S. , government' 
adhered to a policy of non-in-
tervention in Chile's affairs, 
during the Allende period.1 
That policy remains in force 
today. . . ." 
When pressed by Rep. Don-
ald M. Fraser (D-Minn.) On 
whether "you are prepared to, 
day to deny an assertion that ! 
the U.S. funneled money co-! 
vertly to opposition parties 
following the 1970 election in 
Chile," Shlaudeman respond-
ed: "I am .not . . ." ' 
Fraser, chairman of a House 
Foreign Affairs subcommittee 
on international organizations, 
charged yesterday that "the 
executive branch had deceived 
the Congress as well as the 
public with respect to its in-
volvement in the overthrow of 
the Allende regime." 
Yesterday State Department 
spokesman Robert Anderson 
said that "we stand by the 
statements that have .been 
made in the past." He declined. 
to confirm or deny the report ; 
of Colby's testimony published 
Sunday', in The Washington 
Post. 
Secretary of State Henry A.' 
Kissinger similarly declined 
yesterday through a spokes-
man to respond to Colby's tes-
timony, which was recounted 
in a confidential letter from 
Rep. Michael Harrington (D-
Mass.) to House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee ? Chairman 
Thomas E. Morgan (D-Pa.) ap-
pealing for further congres-
sional inquiry into covert op-
erations in Chile. 
Kissinger was chairman of a, 
meeting of the "Forty Com-
mittee" on June 27, 1970 when 
the question of covert political 
action against Allende was 
taken up. Kissinger, according 
to records of. the proceeding, 
favored a limited and thor-
oughly concealed program of 
intervention. 
5 
cording to sources with access ; 
to inter-departmental records 
of the deliberations, opposed 
CIA intervention in the Al-
lende election but abandoned 
its opposition when President 
Nixon ratified a limited- 'pro-' 
gram oh, intervention for. 
which some $350,000 to $400,-
000 was authorized by the 
Forty.,Committee. 
Kissinger was suoted in 
Minutes of the June 27 top-se-
cret meeting at the White 
House as having said: "I don't 
see. why we need to Stand by 
and watch a country go Com-
munist due to the irresponsi-
bility of its own people." 
A spokesman for the Secre, 
tary said yesterday that Mr. 
Kissinger had no.. recollection 
of having made Such an obser-
vation and would not corn-, 
ment on his role in the delib-I 
erations. 
Colby's closed testimony to' 
the-House Armed- Service sub-, 
committee, as recounted in: 
the "Harrington letter, was that 
the CIA's role in the1970 Chi-
lean election- was that of al 
"spoiler" engaged in ."generali 
attempts to politically destabi-
lize the country_and discredit 
Allende to improve the likeli-
hood that an opposition candi-
date would win." 
The Forty Coininittee, which' 
is an inter-departmental White 
,House panel supervising all 
:U.S. covert operations, author-
ized a steady, outpouring of 
funds into Chile:through indi-
viduals, political parties and 
' news media through --Latin 
; American: and European chan-
nels during the anti-Allende 
effort, .according2,to the. Sum-

Kissinger' had, on various 
1 occisions,- expressed personal 
;reservations about-the emer-
gence of the Allende govern 
ment, which was committed to 
I a program of nationalization 
and incorbe redistribution. 
After Allende's popular 
election in September, 1970, 
but before the congressional 
run-off, Kissinger told a group 
of editors at the White House 
that "it is fairly easy 'for one 
to predict that if Allende wins, 
there is a good chance that he 
will establish over a period of 
years some sort of Communist 
government ... 
"So I don't think we should 
delude ourselves that an Al-
lende takeover in Chile would 
not present massive problems 
for us, and for democratic 
forces and pro-U.S. forces in

But Kissinger added that

NEW YORK TIMES 
10 September 1974 
State Department Backs Reports of a Hands-Off Policy 
- 
? By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times 
? WASHINGTON, Sept. 9?In 
a dispute that could lead to 
further hearings, the State Det 
partment declared ,today that 
it was stahding by the testi-
mony of senior officials who 
previously had asserted at 
Congressional hearings that 
the United States had not in-
tervened in the internal affairs 
of Chile after the election of 
President Salvador Allende 
Gossens. 
The challenged testimony 
was officially endorsed by the 
State Department spokesman, 
Robert Anderson, at ?a news 
briefing. His statement came 
two days after it was reported 
that the Central Intelligence 
Agency had been authorized to I 
spend more than $8-million 
from 1970 to 1973 in an effort 
to make it impossible for Presi-
dent Allende to' govern. The 
Allende Government was over-
thrown last September in a 
military coup d'etat.. 
In 
In the last two days, a 
Massachusetts Representative 
and a Senate aide have attacked 
the, credibility of' testimony 
given under oath by Charles 
A. Meyer, former Assistant 
Secretary of State; EdWard M. 
Kerry, former Ambassador to 
Chile, and Harry W. Shlaude-
man, Deputy Assistant Secre-
tary of State. 
Mr. Meyer and Mr. Korry 
both maintained at a Senate 
Foreign Relations subcommit-
tee hearing last year into the 
International Telephone S: Tele-
graph Company's involvement 
in Chile that the Nixon Ad-
ministration had scrupulously 
adhered to a policy of noninter-
vention. Mr. Shlaudeman simi-
larly told a House Foreign 
ticular moment now that mat-
ters have reached this particu-
lar point." 
It was during this period 
:that the CIA and 'Interna-
tional- Telephone and Tele-
graph Co. sought actively to 
Undermine Alleficle's prospects 
for election, according to testi-
mony that emerged last year 
before the Senate Foreign Rel-
ations multinational subcom-
mittee and most recently cor-
roborated in far greater detail 
by CIA Director Colby. 
? Harrington, whose letter re-
vived the controversy over 
U.S. policy in Chile, said he 
would renew his requests to 
Morgan and other 'congres-
sional chairmen for a full in-
-quiry into the extent of CIA 
intervention against Allende's 
elected government. 
"I strongly support the 
broad initiatives of the Nixon 
and Kissinger foreign policy," 
he said. "But I do not think 
we should tolerate the stand-
ard of international conduct 
we displayed in Chile whether 
It was approved by Henry Kis-
singer or anyone else." 
?? 
Affairs subcommittee in June 
;that the United States "had 
Inothing to do with the political 
'destabilization in Chile." ? 
I Jerome .L. Levinson, chief 
counsel of the Senate Subcom-
mittee an Multinational Cor-
porations, which conducted the 
I.T.T. hearings, last' week ac-
cused Mr. Meyer and Mr. Korry 
of having deliberately deceived 
the Senate. Representative Mi-
chael J. Harrington, a Democra-
tic member of the House Fo-
reign Affairs Committee, 
charged that Mr. Shlaudeman 
was evading questions and, in 
effect, dissembling by refusing 
to testify about C.I.A. activities 
against the Allende. Govern-
ment. 
Asked about those criticisms 
today, Mr. Anderson said, 
."With regard to the testimony 
that was given on the Hill by 
Mr. Shlaudeman and Mr. Meyer 
and Others, we stand by that." 
"I realize there have been al-
legations to the contrary," 
Mr. Anderson added, "and if 
any such allegations are pre-
sented, obviously we wil be 
very pleased to review the 
testimony. But we are unaware 
?of any mistatements by the of-
ficers that you referred to." 
Mr. Levinson, reached later 
tqclay in his Senate office, as-
serted that he would "stand on 
what I said." 
New Hearings Possible , 
"A reading of the record by 
any fair-minded person has to 
lead one to the conclusion that 
they were not candid with the 
subcommittee," he said. 
"The words used by Mr. 
Meyer and Mr. Korry were! 
artful in terms of dodging, butl 
NEW YORK TIMES 
11 September 1974 
in substance and spirit 'the in-
tent was to deceive." . 
The subcommittee counsel 
said he was planning to confer 
tomorrow with Senator Frank 
;Church, chairman .of the 
'subcommittee, to determine 
whether further hearings would 
,be necessary. Mr. Church, who 
is up. for re-election this fall, 
was said to be campaigning in 
Idaho today and could not be 
reached for comment. 
In testimony before the 
Churclh subcommittee last year; 
Mr. Meyer and Mr. Korry re-
peatedly asserted that the 
'United States policy was one 
of nonintervention, although 
both. men claimed executive 
privilege in refusing to discuss 
confidential State Department 
and White House communica-
tions. 
Mr. Korry, who was Ambas-
sador at the time 'Dr. 'Allende 
won the presidency in 1970, 
testifiecl, as follows in response 
to a question from Mr. Levin-
son about his instructions; 
"It was Obvious from the his-
torical record that we-did not 
act in any manner that 2 re-
flected a hard line;' that the 
United States had maintained 
the most total hands-off the 
military policy from 1969 to 
i1971 conceivable; that - the 
lUnited States did not seek to 
pressure, subvert, influence a 
single member of the Chilean 
Congress at any time in the 
entire four years of my stay." 
However, according to still-
secret testimony supplied for 
Congress, earlier this year by 
William E. Colby, Director of 
Central Intelligence, the United 
States authorized $1.-million in 
clandestine funds in 1969 and 
oil Chile 
1970 in an attempt to keep Dr. 
Allende from winning the gen-
eral elections, and then spent 
an additional $350,000 in the 
fall of 1970 in an attempt to 
bribe members of the Chilean 
iCongress not to ratify his-elec-
tion. 
1_ Mr. Meyer, who was in 
'charge of Latin-American 
laffairs in the State Department 
'at the time of the coup d'etat, 
testifiedsimilarly  a few days 
ilater that "we were ieligiously 
'and scrupulously adhering to 
the, policy of. the Government 
of ,the United States ... . of non-
intervention. We bought ho 
votes, we funded no candidates, 
we promoted no coups." 
Mr. Korry and Mr. Meyefl 
'could not be reached for com-
ment today. 
Mr. Shlaudeman, while re-
'fusing to discuss C.I.A. activi-
ties in public testimony, also 
emphasized. the United States's 
"policy of nonintervention" 
during his appearance June 12 
'before the House Foreign Af-
fairs Subcommittee on Inter-
American Affairs. 
, In that testimony, Mr. Shlau-
deman 'quoted Secretary of 
State Kissinger as having de-
clared That "we prefer demo-
cratic-governments land attempt 
to exercise our influence to 
ithat end; 'but we also know we 
Icannot impose our political and 
legal structures on others." 
Mr. Shlaudeman, who spent 
four years in Chile before being 
reassigned to Washington last 
year, said "I certainly do" late 
this . afternoon when asked 
whether he..stood by his HouiZ 
Jestimony, 
1Censored Matter in ook About 
Said to I lave Related Chile Activities, 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York,Thpes 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 ? 
The Central Intelligence 
'Agency, citing national secur-
ity, censored the first prioved 
account of some of the agency's 
clandestine activities against 
President Salvadore Allende 
Gossens of Chile from a re-
cently published expose of- the 
intelligence establishment, 
well-informed sources said to-
day. 
The sources said that the 
book, "The C.I.A. and the Cult 
of Intelligence," written by two 
former Government intelligence 
officials, initially included a 
detailed description of the in-
ternal debates in 1970. before 
the Nixon Administration re-
portedly tried covertly to pre-
vent Mr. Allende's victory in 
the Chilean national elections 
of September, 1970. 
After a ? lengthy battle in 
Federal Courts, over prior cen-
sorship, the 434-page book was 
?? ? ? 
published in June by Alfred A. 
Knopf with blank space where 
168 passages were deleted. 
Much of ,the chapter dealing 
with Chile, titled "the Clandes-
tine theory", was heavily cen-
sored in that manner. . 
The C.I.A. had argued that 
those delitions and 177 other 
passages it unsuccessfully 
sought to censor would "cause 
grave and irreparable damage 
to the U.S." if published. 
As initially written, the 
sources said, the book's chap-
ter on Chile began With the 
following quote from Henry 
Kissinger, who was then serv-
ing as adviser on national se-
curity to President Richard M. 
Nixon: 
"I don't see why we need 
to stand by and watch a coun-
try go -Communist due to the 
irresponsibility of its own peo-
ple." 
According to the book Mr. 
Kissinger made the coniment 
while chairman of a meeting 
of the secret "40 Committee," 
the high-level review panel that 
oversees and ? authorizes clan-
destine C.I.A. a7ctivities. The-
meeting took plate on June 27, 
1970, according to the sciurces, 
a few months before the Marx-
ist leader won the Presidential ? 
election ? 
Thus far Secretary of State 
Kissinger has refused to com-
ment publicly on the reports 
published Sunday that the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, acting 
at the specific direction of the 
Nixon Administration, was au-
thorized to spend more than 
SS-million between 1970 and 
1973 in an effort to make it 
impossible for President Al-
lende to govern. The Allende 
Government was overthrown 
last September in a military 
coup d'etat in which the Chile-
an leader died. 
Shortly after the coup, Mr. 
Kissinger told the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee that 
"the C.I.A. had nothing to do 
with the coup to the best of 
my knowledge and belief." Oth-
er Government officials, in their

appearances before Congres-
sional committees, have gone 
further, insisting that the Ad-
ministration followed a policy 
of nonintervention toward the 
Allende regime. 
Mr. Kissinger has been de-
scribed by a number of officials t 
with first-hand knowledge as; 
having been among those most. 
alarmed in the Nixon Adminis-
tration about Mr. Allende's rise 
:to power. - 
At a background meeting with 
newsmen in Chicago on Sept. 
16, 1970, shortly after the elec-
tion of Mr. Allende, Mr. Kis-
singer declared that "an Allende 
take-over in Chile would present 
massive problems for us, and 
indeed ?to the whole Western 
Hemisphere. 
If the Chilean Congress were 
to ratify the election, Mr. Kis-
singer added, "in a major Latin 
American ?country you would 
have a Communist government, 
joining, for example, Argentina, 
ikhich is already deeply divided 
along a long frontier, joining 
Peru, which has already been 
heading in directions that have 
been difficult to deal with, and 
? joining Bolivia, which has also 
gone in a more left, anti-U. S. 
direction." 
'A Close Look' 
He told the newsmen then: 
"We are taking a close look at 
the situation. It is not one in 
which our capacity for influ-
ence is very great.'; 
? According to still-classified 
House testimony last April by 
the Director of Central Intelli-
gence William E. Colby, the in-
telligence agency was author-
ized by the 40 Committee to 
spend $500,000 in 1970 to head 
? off Mr. Allende's popular elec-
? tion, and was later provided 
' with $350,000 to bribe members 
of the Chilean Congress who 
nonetheless voted in October to 
ratify the election. 
A number of officials cau-
tioned in interviews today that 
the C.I.A.'s efforts against Mr. 
Allende were?as one source 
put it ?"much more passive 
than you'd think" ? from the 
published newspaper accounts. 
"We were just trying to bail 
out people who were under the 
gun from Allende and his sup-
porters," one., well-informed 
source said. 
Most Backed Frei 
Most of those who were 
aided, the source added, had 
been supporters of the former 
President, Eduardo Frei Mon-
talva, who had received heavy 
C.I.A. subsidies while running 
for office in 1964 against Mr. 
Allende. 
"Don't forget," the source 
added, "the whole idea in the 
nineteen sixties was what we 
called 'nation building' and it 
worked. Frei would have won 
re-election easily," 
"It's a shame their Constitu-
tion prevented his re-election," 
the source added. Under Chil-
ean law, Mr. Frei could not be 
a candidate for re-election in 
1970. 
According to another well-
informed source who received 
"The C.I.A. and the Cult of In-
telligence" before it ApprOnt 
sored, a somewhat similar

2 High Aides Testified 
It was the Idaho Democrat's 
first public comment on the 
subject since it was reported 
Sunday that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency had been secret-
ly authorized to spend more 
than $8-million between 1970 
and 1973 in a covert attempt 
to make it impossible for Presi-
dent Salvtdor. Allende Gossens 
to govern in Chile. 
Mr. Church is chairman of 
the Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee on Multinational 
Corporations, which held highly 
publicizzed hearing last year 
into the International Tele-
phone & Telegraph Company's 
attempts .to urge United States 
intervention against the Allende 
regime. Mr. -i..;,11ende was over-
thrown by a, military junta in 
a bloody coup d'etat one year 
ago today. 91 
During those- hearings, the 
State Department officials, 
Charles A. Meyer, former As-
sistant Secretary of State for 
Latin-American Affairs, and 
Edward M. Korry, a former 
Ambassador to Chile, testified 
that the United States had 
maintained a policy of nonin-
tervention toward Chile. 
The two officials also refused 
on a number of occasions during 
their testimony to answer spe-
i ic.ques ions about whatey 
said were privileged communi-
cations on United States policy 
toward Dr. Allende. 
?Mr. Church, who returned 
late yesterday from a lengthy 
campaign trip to Idaho, said he 
had authorized the subcommit-
tee staff to review testimony of 
Government witnesses who 
knew of the intelligence 
agency's cundestine activities. 
Ifothe staff review determines 
that there were contradictions 
in their testimony, the Senator 
said, ."in my judgment the ac-
tion that would be called for 
would be to refer the testimony 
to the ,Justice Departthent for 
investigation of possible prejury. 
That's the reason we swear 
in witnesses," he said. ? 
Details Given by Colby-
To aid in the staff review, Mr. 
Church said, he will formally 
(request a copy of the testimony 
on the agency's Chilean involve-
ment given to a House of Rep-
resentatives Armed Seryices 
Intelligence Subcommittee in 
April by William E. Colby, Di-
rector of Central Intelligence. 
Government ,officiais have con-
firmed that the still-secret testi-
mony ? includes a detailed dis-
cussion of the C.I.A.'s, goals and 
strategy in alloting the  mil-
lion cash payments. 
"Art from the question Of 
whether perjury was commit-
ted in a legal sense," Mr. 
Church added, "there's no 
question but what the com-
mittee was given to believe 
that our policy was one of 
nonintervention.'  
"This is clearly what they 
[the witnesses] wantsd us to 
believe, everi?though the truth 
was a very different matter," 
he said. 
'Vietnam Syndrome' Seen 
Ivir. Church, a liberal .whO 
was lane of the early critics of 
the Vietnam w,ar, characterized 
the misleading testimony as 
"part of the Vietnam syn-
drome." 
"There's become a pattern 
of deceiving the Congress that 
I think began cropping .up dur-
ing the Vietnaiwavar," he. said," 
It became a habit with' testi-
mony on all sensitive matters. 
If so' it's a habit the Congress 
is going to have to break." 
Along with the study of pos-
sible perjury, Mr. Church said 
he would formally, request the 
full Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, headed by Senator 
i 
J. W. Fulbright, now n China, 
to review "the propriety" of 
clandestine activities against 
constitutionally elected leaders 
such as Mr. Allende. . 
account of the decision to in-
tervene in Chile was presented 
the two authors, Victor Mar-
chetti, a former C.I.A. official 
and John D. Marks, a former 
State Department intelligence 
analyst. 
The C.I.A. later censored a 
part of the book in which, a 
source said, the C.I.A. was de-
picted as having been divided 
about the proposals to invest 
funds secretly, against Mr. Al-
lende. Officials at C.I.A. head-
quartets. were said by Mr. Mar-
chetti and Mr. Marks to, be con-
cerned because of the possibili-
ty' -that a sudden spurt -in 
spending againft Mr. Allende 
'would be traceable to. Wash-
ington. 
In addition, the source said, 
the original Marchetti-Marks 
manuscript described what was 
depicted as a serious dispute 
over the Chilean policy be-
tween Edward M. Korry; who 
served as Ambassador to Chile 
from 1967 until 1971, and 
Charles A. Meyer, a former As-
sistant Secretary of State for 
Latin America Affairs. The 
book depicted Mr. Korry as 
having been concerned that he 
would be considered after Mr. 
Allende's election as the am-
bassador who permitted Chile 
to be taken over by a Castro-
type figure, the source added. 
" Mr. Meyer, an official with 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., in Chi-
cago, could not be reached to-
day for comment, 
Mr. Korry, contacted today 
at his home in Briarcliff Manor, 
N. Y., declared that he was 
standing by his testimony last 
year to a Senate subcommittee 
in which he stated that the 
United States maintained a poi; 
icy, of nonintervention toward 
the Allende Government. 
"I'm not ducking anybody on 
this," Mr. Korry said. "I stand 
on all the statements I have 
given." He added that he had, 
I sent a lengthy letter to The 
New York Times explaining his 
position and said he would pre-
fer not to comment further 
pending receipt of the letter. 
Although Mr. Kissinger has 
not spoken publicly on the 
Chilean issue, he did authorize 
to newsmen yesterday the fact 
that the 40 Committee only act-
ed upon the unanimous approv-
al of its five members. 
They include Mr. Kissinger, 
the Central Intelligence Direc-
tor, the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, the Deputy Sec-

Chilean enera s unfazed by report of CIA 
.aict hi Allende ouster 
But disclosure causes furore in Washington 
? By James Nelson Goodsell 
Latin America correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
One year after seizing Power, 
Chile's military leaders have settled 
In for a long stay. 
But they celebrate their first an-
niversary in office Sept. 11 amid a 
sudden mushrooming of evidence that 
the United States Central Intelligence 
Agency, contrary to previous denials, 
spent millions of dollars from 1970 to 
1973 to "destabilize" the government 
they ousted. 
? One of the reasons they cited for the 
overthrow of President Salvador Al-
lende Gossens was the escalating 
political and economic chaos in Chile 
that Dr. Allende seemed unable to 
cope with. 
Now, it appears that at least part of 
that chaos was sponsored by the CIA. 
AuthoritatiOn reported 
CIA director William Colby, in 
testimony to a House subcommittee, 
'reportedly confirmed that his agency 
had been authorized to spend as much 
as $8 million in an effort to make it 
impossible for Dr. Allende to govern. 
The Colby testimony went counter 
.to sworn testimony of senior State 
Department officials, and spokesman 
Robert Anderson reiterated Tuesday 
denials that the department was in-
volved in attempts to subvert the 
Allende regime. But there have been 
no denials of CIA involvement 
Suspicions of such involvement 
have made the rounds over the years. 
Although the Colby testimony made 
hardly a ripple in Chile after its 
disclosure Sunday, it is causing. a 
furor in Washington. 
There is a feeling that the testimony 
may only be the tip of the iceberg ? 
that more disclosures will be forth-
coming and that they may well impli-
cate a variety of Nixon adminis-
tration officials. 
Already, there is question over 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kis-
singer's role in the CIA activities. As 
a key member of the National Secu-
rity Council and the head of its "Forty 
Committee," he apparently played a 
role in approving the use of funds for 
the "destabilization" program in 
Chile. 
? 
Yet, in various statements, Dr. 
Kissinger has over the years been 
quoted as saying, in connection with 
Chile, that "we prefer democratic 
governments and attempt to exercise 
our influence to that end; but we also 
know we cannot impose our political 
and legal structures on others." 
It is precisely this point that is put 
in doubt by the disclosures of CIA 
Involvement in Chile. ? 
Until the Colby testimony was dis-
closed over the weekend, the only 
confirmed anti-Allende activity by 
Washington was a United States-
sponsored credit squeeze on the part 
of both Washington and international 
and hemisphere lending agencies. 
That squeeze made it hard for Dr. 
Allende's Marxist-leaning govern-
ment to obtain credit. But in a way, 
Washington could argue effectively 
that credits to Chile had dropped 
significantly in the last two years of 
the government. of Eduardo Frei 
Montalva, which immediately. pre-
ceded that of Dr. Allende, due to a 
feelinenri the part of President Frei 
and the international lenders that: 
Chile needed to expend already 
granted credits and begin repay-
ments before a large new influx of 
credit was granted. . 
The Colby disclosures came in a 
confidential seven-page letter from 
Rep. ,Michael J. Harrington (D) of 
Massachusetts asking further con-
gressional hearings on the CIA's role 
In the Sept. 11, 1973, military coup that 
toppled Dr. Allende's government. 
. That coup ended Dr. Allende's ef-
forts to nudge Chile along the road to 
socialism and also ended Chile's long 
tradition of democratic government. 
Moreover, it was accompanied by a 
massive roundup of Allende suppor-
ters, escalating reports of the murder 
of thousands of Chileans, and imposi-
tion of a broad military dictatorship. 
On the eve of the first anniversary. 
of the military take-over, for ex-
ample, Amnesty International, the 
London-based human rights organiza-
tion, alleged that widespread torture 
and executions were continuing in 
? Chile. 
"The death roll of victims is un-
precedented in recent Latin Amer-
ican history,'! the . organization-
8 
charged. Moreover,it said, "there is 
little .indication that the situation is 
; 
Improving or that a return to normal-
I- ity is intended." 
Amnesty ? International estimated 
that between 8,000 and 10,000 political ? 
prisoners were still being detained 
without trial in Chile. It added that 
tthey represented every sector of 
Society .from former Allende '-min?e 
isters to ,,doctors, lawyers, trade 
unionists, and actors, ? 
Worldwide reaction to events in. 
Chile, as mirrored in the Amnesty - 
International report, has been largely . 
negative, prompting the military 
leaders headed by President Augusto 
Pinochet Ugarte to claim that a leftist 
public opinion campaign_ has been 
mounted against Chile. ' ? 
But General Pinochet and his fellow 
military officers have indicated that i 
they are worried about their image.. 
And it is reported that the .Chilean. 
Government has hired .the J. Walter. 
Thompson agency In New York to 
start a public relations campaign 
designed to Improve Chile's image. ? 
That image may be hard to im-
prove, however, until the military 
relax some of the curbs placed on? 
Chile and Chileans in thepast year ? 
dissolution of Congress, ban on Marx-
ist parties and the shutting down of all 
'other political activity, the censorship 
of the press, and the abrogation of 
many civil rights.

conference of former' 
agents, government officials 
and journalists on the sub-

in covert action funds were

Studies, will subject Colby 
to one of the most informed 
and critical audiences to 
which he has been so jar ex-
posed. 
? 
Covert operations are car-
ried out under general p01-

Colby is a member of the, 
powerful but informal' com-
mittee which meets under 
the auspices of the White 
House. 
In recent statements the. 
CIA director has empha-
sized the agency's subordi-
nate role to the White 
House and the senior policy, 
group whose name, until 
last year, was never in print 
and unknown to members of. 
the 'agency's oversight com-
mittees on Capitol Hill: , 
The existence of the Forty 
Committee surfaced in con-' 
nee :on with the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee's 
Multinational Subcommittee 
in connection with the role 
of the CIA and the Interna-
tional Telephone and Tel 
graph .Corp. in Chile. 
Aside from the Chile case, 
The revelations about the CIA's 
.activities in Chile under the 
Allende regime will come as no 
surprise to the. many leftists and 
nationalists all over the world for 
whom -the role of " imperialism " 
in Allende's downfall was always 
a foregone conclusion. But they 
are a bitter draught for those ?of 
us who cling to the notion of the 
"free world", and who still re-
gard the United States as an 
irreplaceable ally ? sometimes 
clumsy, often misunderstood, but 
fundamentally honourable in its 
conduct of international affairs. 
Must it be believed? Union, 
tunately? it seems that there is 
little alternative. The story ap-
pears in both the New York 
Timess and the Washington Post, 
? and has already been confirmed 
by Representative Michael Har-
.rington who has read the 'Secret 
testimony of the CIA director Mr 
Colby, and on whose letter to the 
chairman of the House foreign 
affairs committee the original 
story was based. 
The question posed is not that 
of the merits of the Allende 
regime, which were on the whole 
outweighed by its demerits. Nor 
is it the much more debatable 
question whether those demerits 
not 'even whether the CIA's 
activities' were a determining 
factor in bringing about 
Allende's downfall.. Very prob-
ably: they were not. The govern-
ment's exaltation of the class 
struggle, its repeated circumven-
tion or defiance of parliament 
and. the courts, its connivance at 
the arms procurement and train-
ing activities of its supporters, 
its attempt to politicize the high 
command of the armed fortes?
these things against a 'back-
ground of three-figure inflation 
produced by its economic policies 
were probably bound to provoke 
a military response of some kind. 
If United States policy did 
contribute to Allende's downfall, 
it did so more effectively by 
blocking loans from the Inter-
American Development Bank, the 
World Bank and the Export-
Import Bank in reprisal for 
Chile's failure to compensate the 
Anaconda and Kennecott copper 
companies for the nationalization 
of their major mines. This 
certainly . accentuated Allende's 
economic problems, though it 
was by no means their sole cause. 
But one is not obliged to lend 
money to a regime that one dis-
likes, and if shortage of foreign 
?

WASHINGTON STAR 
12 September 1974 
By Jeremiah O'Leary 
Star-News Staff Writer 
Rep. Michael J. Harring-
ton, D-Mass., has charged 
that CIA activities in Chile 
against the government of 
President Salvadore Al-
lende were viewed by the ' 
'agency as a "prototype or 
laboratory experim-ent" to 
test techniques .of heavy 
financial investment to dis-
credit and bring down a 
government. 
The charge is contained 
in a letter to Chairman J. 
William Fulbright of the? 
Senate Foreign Relations 
committee two months ago. 
and which was released 
today by Harrington. 
In a press conference 
? Harrington made public ex-
changes or correspondence 
between himself, Fulbright 
and other members of Con-
gress about his concern 
over activities of CIA and 
the U.S. Treasur/Depart-
meat in Chile and the "quite 
limited" congressional re-
view of CIA activities. Har-
rington charged these 
reviews are perfunctory 
and come after the fact. 
? IN HIS LETTER to Ful-
bright, Harrington de-
scribed how the "40 Com-
mittee" headed by Henry A. 
Kissinger authorized expen-
diture of $11 million from 
1962 to 1973 to help prevent 
the election of Allende. He 
said CIA Director William

intention was to

government so as to pre-

Harrington wrote that, 
"funding was provided to 
individuals, political parties 
and media outlets in Chile 
through channels in other 
countries and in both Latin 
America a- nd Europe. Mr. 
Colby's description of these 
operations was direct, 
though not to the point of 
identifying actual contacts 
and conduits."

viewed as that of the "spoil-

of Allende, $5 million was 
authorized by the 40 com-

tion efforts from 1971 to 
1973. An additional $1.5 mil-
lion was spent for the 1973

tions. Some of these funds

his differences with the 
United States. These and 
other related activities sug-

ed from its proper role of 
intelligence gathering and; 
instead, participated in for-
mulation of policies and 
events both in the United 
States and Chile which it 
was supposed to objectively, 
analyze and report." 
Fulbright responded on 
July 26, with a letter to Har-
rington in which the Arkan-

shared Harrington's frus-
tration. 
"This has been going on-
in places other than Chile

it came to power. _ 
WASHINGTON POST 
11 September 1974 
In public testimony, State 
Department officials repeat-
edly have denied any Ameri-
can involvement in the over-
throw of Dr. Allende. ? 
In a letter to Senator J .W. 
Fulbrighti (D., Ark.), chair-
man of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, released at the 
press conference, Mr. Harring-
ton said that the Senate panel 
! should study the Possibility of

Ihe said, "for the Congress to 
:acquiesce in State Department 
officials' coming before con-
gressional committees and 
making statements, which, if 
not outright lies, are at least 
evasions of the truth." 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy 
(D., Mass.) said at least three 
times in the last year State De-
partment officials made "mis-
leading and 'deceptive" state-
ments to Congress about the 
American role in Chile, it was 
Chile and Cuba 
T' 
UNITED STATES has consistently denied using 
the CIA to fight leftist Salvador Allende in Chile: 
Yet, it now turns out, CIA director William E. Colby told 
a House committee last April that: The CIA gave $3 mil-
lion to the Allende political opposition in 19M and $500,-
000 more to "anti-Allende forces" in 1969. It authorized 
$350,000 to bribe the Chilean congress against him in 
IWO, *the year he won. It contributed $5 million for 
"more destabilization efforts" in 1971-73 and $1.5 million 
in by-elections in 1973. In August of that year, it author-
ized $1 million for "further political. destabilization ac-
tivities."' A coup ousted him, and he 'was killed, a year 
ago today. 
The Colby revelations do not answer once and for all 
the question Of whether, as-the Latin left already..be, 
Heves, the United States destroyed Allende; some part 
of his difficulties were of his own making. Nor do the 
'revelations demonstrate that the CIA had a direct hand 
in the coup. They prove beyond dispute,-however, that 
the United States acted in a' way to aggravate Mr. Al-
lende's problems, and played into the hands of those 
who made the coup. We did so, ?moreover, deliberately: 
According to Mr. Colby, the anti-Allende acts were not 
the work of a mindless uncontrolled agency but of a CIA 
operating at the instructions of the appropriate White 
House review panel, the "FortyCommittee," headed by 
Henry Kissinger. 
Dr. Kissinger and' President Nixon, one gathers, had 
decided there were to be "no more Cubas": no more 
Marxist states in the western hemisphere. Any means, 
apparently, would do. Would it not be better, Dr. Kissin-

In a letter to Dr. Kissinger, 
Senator Kennedy described the 
statements as "contrary to my 
understanding of the dual re-

!President in the conduct of U.S. 
foreign relations." 
The Colby disclosures were 
the highlight of the opening of a 
conference on covert activitiesi

Center for National Security, 
Studies. 1 
Senator Phillip A. Hait (D.,,! 
Mich.) opened the conferencel 
yesterday by urging Congress to 
explore the CIA role in Chile. 
' "We haven't done a damn 
thing . . . to prevent the Presi-
dent from waging secret wars," 
Senator Hart said. He said the 
Colby testimony "has more pro-
found implications for our for-
.eign policy than many .interna

has shown interest."

of State a year ago, to take the CIA out of such 
- clandestine efforts as overturning Latin governments?. 
"There are certain types of these activities, 'difficult to 
describe here," the Meretary-designate replied, "that it 
would be dangerous to abolish." 
' This information comes to light now through the sur-
-
' facing of a confidential letter from Rep. Michael Har-
rington (D-Mass.) to House Foreign Affairs Committee/ 
Chairman Thomas E. Morgan (D-Pa.), in. which 1?117. Har-, 
?/ 
rington asks for a deeper investigation. Dr. Morgan, like 
his Senate counterpart, J. William Tulbright (D-Ark.), 
has been reluctant to press such' a probe. But it is laugh-
able for Cengress to assert a larger foreign-policy role 
if it is to shy away from this outrageous instance of 
hemispheric realpolitik. Last year, for instance, the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on mul-
tinational corporations investigated charges that in 1970 
ITT had sought to induce the CIA to block Allende. The 
subcommittee found that the CIA had not followed ITrs 
bidding.- But now it turns out that?before, during and 
after the ITT episode?the CIA was intervening in Chile-
an politics. 
Since the 1960s, the United States lias- used its influ-
ence to keep Cuba a hemispheric pariah. And why? 
A principal stated reason has been Cuba's ostensible 
support of subversion in Latin America: putting guer-
rillas ashore here and there, sounding the revolutionary 
trumpet, and the like. But whatever Cuba has allegedly 
done in the past is peanuts next to what the .United 
States has admittedly done in Chile. To bar Cuba from 
hemispheric society on the basis of a test we fail our-
? selves is absurd. . , ?

LONDON TIMES 
11 September 1974 
Gung-ho 
Victor Marchetti was an officer' 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency for 14 years, and a book; 
of which he is co-author, The 
CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, 
is a cause celebre in the Ameri-
can courts. Because the courts 
ruled that Marchetti was still ' 
bound by the oath of secrecy - 
he made when he joined the CIA 
in 1955, the book has been pub-
lished with about 5 per cent of 
its contents missing because of 
168 deletions which the CIA still 
insist upon. 
Marchetti was on a 24-hour 
visit to London yesterday. It is 
his first travel abroad since he 
left the Agency. "I knew the 
CIA would do anything they 
could to discredit me when I 
surfaced so I had to be purer 
than the driven snow. I have 
been followed, my telephone has I 
been tapped, my mail has been 
tampered with, and there have 
,been certain efforts toward en-
trapment. Foreigners have been 
put in my path, whom I have 
?had to take care not to get in-
volved with." 
' Marchetti does not believe the 
CIA masterminded the deaths 
of John Kennedy or Martin 
Luther King, and says he has 
no first-hand knowledge of any 
assassination attempts, though, 
he has heard rumours. "During 
training we were told that any-
thing like that we-ild have to be 
approved at the highest level, 
and it would be a black mark 
against you. You would have 
to be a pretty lousy case officer 
if you could not find any way 
of terminating your agent with-
out !tilling him." 
Marchetti says he never liked 
? his job much. I always thought 
it Was basically sort of silly. I 
could never quite get with the 
gung-ho aspects of it. When I did 
training they were very strong 
on paramilitary stuff as well? as 
standard trade craft like how to 
? open letters indetectably and 
how to plant bugs. I did not like 
a lot of the people I met." 
Honesty is not a CIA charac-
teristic. "They denied being in-
volved in Chile, but it is now 
revealed that they did pour 
' millions of dollars in to prevent 
Allende coming to power and 
? 
then to destabilize his govern-
ment. They consistently denied 
being involved in Greece, but 
Greece is a major station for 
many area programmes and they 
clearly backed' the junta. Now 
they are moving assets out of 
Athens and on to Teheran where 
they have a safer station. The 
ambassador is the former 
director of the CIA, and the 
Shah owes his throne to the 
CIA." 
PHS 
ChTISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR ? 
11 SEP 1974 ? 
CIA and Chile 
Now the facts are coming to 
light. The Central Intelligence 
Agency was not the innocent by-
stander in Chile that the United 
States Government tried to imply 
it was at the time of the overthrow 
of Salvador Allende. 
The CIA, it turns out, engaged 
for years in clandestine activities 
against the late Chilean Presi-
dent. CIA director William Colby 
acknowledged in secret testimony 
to the Congress that some $8 
million had been authorized by a 
high-level intelligence -committee 
headed by Henry Kissinger to 
"destabilize" Allende's Marxist 
government and bring about its 
downfall after1970. 
The disclosures are shotking 
and dictate the urgent need for a 
public scrutiny of national secu-
rity policies, a reform of CIA 
functions, and a system of strict 
accountability for CIA actions. 
They also point again to the decep-
tion practiced by previous admin-
istrations. 
The State Denartment sticks by 
its guns. It stated this week it 
backs the testimony of high offi-
cials who previously told Congress 
that the U.S. had not intervened in 
the domestic affairs of Chile after 
Allende's election. ' 
Clearly the full story has yet to 
be told. In light of the developing 
dispute we favor full-scale public 
hearings into the CIA's role in 
Chile, as called for by Congress-
man Michael Harrington. 
? This is not the first time the CIA 
has been involved in questionable 
covert operations against foreign 
states. Its record includes the 
aborted Bay of Pigs invasion, the 
secret war in Laos, and efforts to 
overthrow governments in Iran 
and Guatemala. More recently, on 
the domestic front, it furnished 
the White House "plumbers"-with 
technical aid and a psychiatric 
profile of Daniel Ellsberg ? acts 
that violated its mandate. 
The record is disturbing. 
However distasteful, clandes-, 
tine operations sometimes are 
necessary. If a foreign power, for 
instance, is engaged in activities : 
in a country that could impair 
American interests, it stands to1 
reason the U.S. must know what it 
is up to. But gathering informa-
tion and exposing Co? ?unist sub- ? 
versipn, say, are one thing. At- i 
? tempts to undermine or overthrow 
legitimate gos;ernments are quite ? 
another. 
A distressing aspect of all this is! 
the double standard which the 
U.S. has set for its international 
conduct. It apparently is per- , 
missible for the CIA to maneuver 
against local governments which' 
Washington does not like ? this is 
deemed in the national interest. 
But when the U.S. declines to use 
its influence to dissuade repres-
sive regimes from antidemocratic 
excesses ? as in South Korea or 
Greece ? this is justified as "non-
interference" in another country's 
internal affairs. 
If the CIA is permitted to abet 
the disintegration of constitu-
tionally elected governments ? 
however unpalatable their ideo-
logy ? does not the U.S. lose its 
moral authority to condemn sim-
ilar subversive action by a Com-
munist power?, 
The Allende regime was hardly 
a model for Latin America. But 
the late President aid carry on his 
Marxist experiment within the,. 
constitutional framework. if '-
Washington chcise not tiS render 
help ? except to the Chilean 
military ? that at least was an 
overt, if debatable, position. 
But by colluding in the effort to 
undermine the Chilean Govern-
ment by covert means, Washing-
ton has only helped destroy the 
credibility of the argument that 
Communists should participate in 
the democratic process rather 
than seek power through violent 
means.

NEM 
Secret War on Chile 
'IN THE NATION - 
By Tom Wicker 
On the very day that President Ford 
extended preventive pardon to Richard 
Nixon, another high crime of the Nixon, 
?Administration was being disclosed in 
The New York Times. Public outrage 
because of the pardon must not be 
allowed to obscure this sordid story 
of indefensible American ,intervention. 
in the internal affairs of Chile, in the 
years just before the violent over-
throw of the Allende Government anti 
the death of President Salvador Al-
lende Gossens. 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
appears to have been a principal force 
in this covert intervention, and is be-
.ing charged once again with not hav-
ing told the whole truth to a. Senate 
committee. Demands are being heard 
for a reopening of the hearings which 
recommended his confirmation as Sec-
zeta ry. . 
? The Times story, by Seymour Hersh, 
was based on a letter from Repre-
sentative Michael Harrington of Mas-
sachusetts to Chairman Thomas E. 
Morgan of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee. The Harrington letter gave 
an? account, from memory, of testi-
mony to a House Armed Services sub-
comrhittee by William E. Colby, the 
director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
Mr. Harrington said he had twice 
read a transcript of the Colby testi-
mony. As he described it to Mr: 
Morgan, Mr. Colby said that the Nixon 
Administration had authorized about 
$8 million to be spent Overtly to 
make it impossible for President Al-
lende to, govern. Specifically, $500,000 
was authorized in both 1969 and 1970 
to help Mr. Allende's election oppo-
nents, and $350,000 was later au-
thorized for bribing members of the 
Chilean Congress to vote against rati,7 
fying Mr. Alleride's election. " 
Later $5 million was authorized for 
clandestine "destabilization" efforts in 
Chile; and in 1973, $1.5 million was 
provided to help anti-Allende candi-
dates in municipal elections. The' au-
thorizing body for a.11 this C.I:A. ac-
tivity was the so-balled "40 Committee" 
of the Nixon Administrationa- com-
mittee chaired by Henry Kissinger. 
But Mr. Kissinger told the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee during his 
confirmation hearings that "the C.I.A. 
had nothing to do with the coup, to 
the best of my knowledge and belief." 
While that may have been true in the 
narrowest sense, it was at best one .of 
those torturous non-lies in which gov-
ernments specialize and at worst a 
concealment of the true nature of U.S. 
policy toward the Allende Government 
.and the scope of American activities 
to undermine that Government. 
. ? 
Similarly, Edward M. Korry, ambas-
.sador to Chile during most of the,period 
in question, denied under oath to ?a 
? Senate subcommittee that there had 
been American attempts to "pressure, 
subvert, influence a single member of 
the Chilean Congress.' Charles A. 
Meyer, a former Assistant Secretary 
of State for Latin-American affairs, 
also swore that the United States had 
scrupulously followed a policy of non-. 
intervention in Chile. 
No wonder, then, that Senator Frank 
Church, to whose, subcommittee this 
sworn testimony was offered, was re-
ported to be outraged upon learning 
of the Colby testimony. He has prop-
erly raised not only the possibility of 
perjury charges but the question. of 
comprehensive hearings by the full 
Foreign Relations Committee on the 
? intervention in Chile. 
If such hearings are held, or if Mr. ? 
Kissinger's confirmation hearings? 
should be reopened?as they already 
have been oxide, to inquire into charges 
that he did not tell the whole truth" , 
abotit wiretaps on reporters and some 
of his associates?the inquiry should 
Rress much further than, the candor of 
official testimony, important as that 
question is. . 
But as One Government :official 
? pointed out to Mr. Hersh, if .covert ac-
tivities against another country are au-
thorized, Gosiernment officials?some-
times 'including Secretaries of State 
and Presidents?have to lie about 
them. Lies 'are part of the business. 
The real questions are whether this 
supposedly peace-roving and demo. 
cratic nation has any legal or moral 
right to conduct covert operations 
abroad, and whether any Administra-
tion of either party has the constitu-
tional authority to order taxpayers' 
money spent for clandestine warfare. 
against the legitimate government of 
a sovereign country. , 
These questions are long overdue for 
full and ppen debate; the Colby testi-
mony, for example, said the first -in-
tervention against Mr. Allende was 
Ordered by Lyndon Johnson in 1964? 
Congress, the press, Presidential .can-
didates ? all have consistently shied 
away from this subject. Supposed , 
liberals have pled the supposed need , 
to be "hard-nosed.' The real need is, 
to face the fact that gangster schemes 
of bribery, violence and even assasSin?
ation are being carried out, in the 
name of the great American people. 
The C.I.A. may be only an instru- ? 
ment, but it seems to have its own 
sinister vitality. The Chilean efforts, 
in fact, were authorized by the lineal 
descendent of a ?body set up by the 
Kennedy Administration to "control" 
the C.I.A. Isn't it clear at last that 
such "control" can be. achieved only 
by a Government with the political wilt, 
to cut the C.I.A. in half, or kill it al-
together?

CONCERN BY INDIA 
ON C.I.A. RELATED 
t By SEYMOUR M. HERSH , 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12?
Daniel P. Moynihan, ambassa-
dor to India, has priyately 
? warned Secretary of State Kis-
singer that recent reports of 
Central Intelligence Agency 
? activities in Chile have con-
firmed Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi's "worst suspicions and 
genuine fears" about American 
policy toward India. 
In a stinging rebuke of such 
s? clandestine activities, Mr. 
Moynihan noted in a confiden-
that his embassy formally de-
nied last year to the Indian 
Government that the United 
States had intervened against 
the Marxist President of Chile, 
? Salvador Allende Gossens. Mr. 
Allende died in a bloody coup 
d'etat last September.' 
Writing of Mrs. Gandhi, Mr. 
Moynihan said: 
''Her concern is whether the 
-United States accepts the In-
dian. regime. She is not. sure 
but that we would be content 
to sea _others like her over-
thrown. She knows full well 
that we have done our share 
and more of. bloody and dis-
honorable deeds." 
Not Worried About Ouster 
The ambassador said Mrs. 
Gandhi was not worried about 
being overthrown, and added: 
"It is precisely because she 
Is not innocent, not squeamish 
and not a moralizer that .her 
concern about American inten-
tions is real and immediate. 
"And of course the news 
from the United States, as 
printed in the Indian press, re-
- peatedly confirms her .worst 
suspicions and genuine fears. 
"Nothing will change her un-
less she is satisfied that the 
United States. acceptS her In-
dia. She does noto. now think 
we do. She thinks, we are 
profoundly* selfish and cynical 
counter-revolutionary power." 
Because of. that belief, Mr. 
Moynihan noted, "she will aci 
cordingly proceed to develop 
nuclear weapons and a missile 
delivery system preaching non-
violence all the way" 
State Department officials 
said that the cablegram had 
been personally re.A.;iewed by 
Mr. Kissinger, but, his reaction 
could not be learned. 
. There was no official com-
ment from the State Depart-
ment about the ambassador's 
Cable. One well-informed offi-
cial acknowledged that Mr. 
dignant about the C.I.A.'s 
ac-
tivities in Chile. - 
"Pat's always indignant," the 
official added. "He write beau-
tifully and his cables are a de-
light to read, but he's always 
indignant.", 
Other officials said that, as 
far as they knew, Mr. Moyni-
han was still in good standing 
with the Ford Administration.

WASHINGTON POST 
13 Sept ember 19714
Stephen S. Rosenfeld 
the: CIA and Kissinger 
To go barking after the CIA because 
of its secret operations in Chile is be-
side the point. The agency, in subvert-
ing the late Socialist President. Salva-
dor Allende, was carrying out estab-
lished national policy ? White House 
policy. The CIA's director, William 
Colby, who was in the position of re-
porting to Congress about actions 
taken under earlier (Erectors, deserves 
praise for his candor. 
The real need is to fathom why 
Henry Kissinger, then (1970-73) Mr. 
Nixon's national security adviser, felt 
it was essential to get rid of one partic-
ular leader of a country which, by its 
region, size and general importance, 
plays almost no part in the global bal-
ance of power, on which Kissinger's 
strategy supposedly is based. 
Interestingly, Allende and Chile are 
not mentioned once in the absorbing 
new book, "Kissinger," by Bernard and 
.Marvin Kalb. The only public clue to 
his thinking is pretty insubstantial. An 
Allende "takeover," Kissinger said in 
1970 of Allende's electoral victory, 
could produce over time'sorne sort of, _ 
Communist government" which could 
pose "massive problems for is, and for 
democratic forces and pro-U.S. forces 
An Latin America." . 
What were those "massive prob-
lems" which the United States set out 
to help diter by covert means? 
?No doubt Kissinger and Nixon want-
ed, if posible, to limit leftist move-
ments throughout Latin America: "No 
more Cubes." But in view of Washing-
ton's moves then toward Moscow, and 
its tentative move now toward Ha-
vana, this hardly seems' an adequate 
rationale. ? 
e Nor can a very persuasive case be 
. Made that the defense of the United 
States' then-embattled corporate inter-
ests in Chile ? and by extension, else-
Democrat whose concern over 
Chile policy led to the C.I.A. 
disclosures, urged at a news 
conference that Mr. Kissinger 
publicly be called upon by 
Congress to aceount or that 
,policy. He said that if the 
agency ?did not cease its clan-
destine activtties, it might 
jeopardize all of its overt in-
telligence-gathering work. 
cSenator Edward M. Ken-
nedy, Democrat of Massachu-
setts, made public a letter to 
Mr. iKssinger in which he 
sought an explanation for the 
? legal basis of the agency's in-
volvement in Chile as well as 
an explanation of why State 
Department ' officials misled 
Congress during sworn testi-
mony about the United States 
policy toward Cuba. 
William E. Colby, director 
of the C.I.A., testified in secret 
about the Chile operations be-
fore the Senate Armed Serv-
ices subcommittee on intelli-
gence. The hearing was led by 
Senator John C. Stennis, Dem-
ocrat of Mississippi and chair-
where in the third world ? required 
measures so extreme. You have to be a 
Marxist, or to think Kissinger and 
Nixon were pretty stupid, to believe 
that was a dominant factor. 
For what it's worth, I suspect Kis-
singer feared that the example of a 
successful popular front government 
in Chile?Communists and Socialists 
working together ? might have a con-
tagious effect in France and Italy and 
other places where, in the 1970s. popu-
lar fronts have a real chance of com-
ing to power. Kissinger voiced this 
fear in discussing his Chile policy pri-
vately at the time. 
The election of a Socialist-Communist 
coalition in Chile . had, after all, 
aroused global attention. .Communist 
parties were widely being made re-
spectable, in part by the example of 
Richard Nixon in dealing with Moscow 
and Peking. Their "natural" political 
partners were and are the democratic 
socialist parties of the left. It was not 
far-fetched ? not then, not now ? to 
imagine popular fronts taking power 
and, degree by degree, removing their 
countries from the "West," as the area 
of postwar American dominance is 
commonly known. 
It is suggestive that CIA Director 
Colbyapparently ranked the Chile op-
eration in importance with postwar 
Greece and Guatemala and described 
it as a "prototype" for bringing for-
eign governments down with money. 
In postwar Greece, the United States 
helped Athens defeat a Communist in-
surgency launched across a national' 
frontier. In Guatemala in 1954, the 
CIA sponsored a military coup against 
a Communist government. In Chile it 
provided financial support to help 
local elements thwart an elected Marx-
ist who was expected to take Chile to-
ward communism by a parliamentary 
route. 
man of the full committee. 
alA two-day conference on 
"the C.I.A. and covert actions" 
opened in a Senate hearing 
room, with Senator Philip A. 
?Hart, Democrat of Michigan, 
declaring that if Congress did 
not fully investigate the 
agency's role in Chile, "it will 
be sending the executive 
branch a clear signal that it is 
not really serious about reas-
serting all its powers and its 
right to participate in the 
foreign policy area." 
Adverse Effect Is Seen 
Mrs. Ghandi's anger and, 
fears, as reported by Mr. May-' 
nihan, could have an adverse 
effect on the continuing United 
States attempt to improve rela-
tions with India in the after-
math of Mr. Kissinger's tilt to-, 
Kissinger, using wit as a cloak, has 
quipped that Chile is "a dagger 
pointed at the heart. of Antarctica." 
His implication: How_can anyone think 
he was uptight about Chile? But pera 
haps he was uptight about Chile. ? 
Temperamentally, what Kissinger 
seems to fear most in the current in-
ternational scene is the flux, the un-" 
tertainty, the difficulty of convincing 
the American public to deal with fhter-' 
national challenges less evident ? but 
in his mind, hardly less ominous ? 
than military attack. 
Kissinger is a child of Weimal 
Germany: He has seen democracy de 
stroyed. He has some of the European 
Intellectual's characteristic ambiva. 
lence about popular democracy, 631 
whose putative weaknesses he at 
tempts to compensate by diplomatic 
manipulation, elitism, secrecy, per 
sonal virtuosity. This is of a piece with 
his scarcely concealed contempt fo, 
Europe's cravenness ? an attitude al 
which the public saw traces after flu 
Mideast war last year. 
It is the conventional wisdom thai 
Vietnam taught the United States that 
it could no longer play th. 
"policeman" of the world. But perhapi 
it taught Kissinger, whose view of his 
tory is long and dark and extendy 
much beyond Vietnam, that the UniW 
States must play the policeman in 
particular way ? a way that fends ofi 
feared foreign dangers but does Dui 
bring down the domestie 
wrath on the government's or one'l 
own head. ? 
There is something undeniably val 
iant about Kissinger's purposes, but 
there can be something undeniably el 
cious about his means. Is there m 
other way for the values and the into, 
,ests of the- United States to thrive?, 
_ . 
? 
ward Pakistan. in the 1971 
India-Pakistan war. ? 
The Secretary of State was 
known to be planning a visit 
to' India next, month and was 
expected to set up a number of 
joint United States-Indian com-
missions to work out economic 
and technical aid agreements. 
Mr. Moynihan reported that!

One of the Senate's most 
senior congressional over-
seers of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency's operations 
said yesterday that he was 
not informed of the extent 
of U.S. covert political op-
erations in Chile. 
Sen. Stuart Symington (D-
Mo.) made this admission in 
a telephone interview after 
CIA Director William E. 
Colby was called into a two-
hour executive session of 
the Senate Armed Services. 
intelligence subcommittee in 
the aftermath of disclosures 
Sunday that $11 million in 
covert action funds had been 
targeted against the late 
Chilean president, Salvador 
Allende. 
"You can say that I was 
surprised," said Symington, 
a loyal supporter_ of the 
agency in the past. 
Symington's surprise, it 
was understood, was shared 
by Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman oJhn 
C. Stennis (D-Miss.\. who 
also presides over the CIA 
oversightisubcommittee. 
Symington's statement se-
riouslY clouds the credibility 
of the oft-repeated assertion 
by Colby and other top CIA 
officials that the agency's 
congressional oversight com-
mittees have been fully 
briefed on all major covert 
programs carried out by the 
agency tinder the authority 
of the National Security 
Council. 
- The disclosure . of secret 
funding_ for anti-Allende ac-
tivities, made by 'Colby in 
executive testimony to a 
House Armed Services intel-
ligence subcommittee last 
:April 22, was also in direct

mony by high-ranking State ?

WASHINGTON POST 
1.1-i September 19714
By Laurence Stern 
.-Washington Post &elf Writer . 
Central ? Intelligence' 
,Agency Director William E. 
Colby stepped coolly into a 
public confrontation yester-
day over his agency's covert. 
activities in Chile, took the 
boos and hisses 4ith equan-
imity, and gave little in re-
turn. n - 
? Appearing, in a- crowded 
Capitol Hill hearing which 
was heavy in political thea-
ter but short in substance, 
Colby declined to discuss 
publicly details of the re-
ported $11 -million in secret 
U.S. activities targeted 
against the late Chilean 
President Salvador Allende 
before and .after he came to 
power. ? 
He did not deny the re-
ports, which stemmed from 
secret testimony he gave a I 
House subcommittee last 
April 22. There'was only the 
most oblique hint of confir-
mation when he deplored.. 
the leak of his testimony as 
raising the "dilemma of how 
we can provide Congress del-. 
icate information without . 
adverse effects." 
Colby reiterated his long- , 
standing position that "the 
CIA had no connection with; 
the military coup [in Chile] ' 
in 1973."- He acknowledged, ? 
however, that "we did look 
forward to a change in. 
government" in the .1976 ? 
elections. 
. Colby weathered with im-
.perturbabilitY the cross-ex-
,amination of -congressional* 
questioners,. ? the needling 
and oratory of Pentagon Pa-. 
pers martyr Daniel Ellsberg 
and heckling inquiries from 
the floor. 
, "How many people have 
you killed?" someone 
shouted from the audience. 
Colby launched into a calm 
and numbing eXposition of 
the Phoenix program in Vi-
etnam, which he directed 
and which has become a fo-
tus of public criticism of his 
tenure as head of the U.S.. 
*pacification team there be-
tween 1968 and 1971. 
. Colby's chief interrogator on 
the Chile question was Rep. 
Michael Harrington (D.Mass.). 
who inadvertently touched off 
the controversy in a confiden-
tial letter td House Foreign 
Affairs Committee chairman 
face of "a new threat that 
developed in the world." - 
lie also defended his role as 
director of the so-called Phoe-
nix program in Vietnam, a 
pacification campaign that 
ranged from economic develop-
ment to assassination.. 
Rep." Thomas Morgan (D-Pa.) 
detailing Colby's April 22 
testimony on secret CIA ac-
tivities there. 
Colby told Harrington 
that the CIA had briefed its, 
congressional oversight .sub-' 
committees on all major co-; 
vert activities undertaken: 
abroad. He said also that he 
would discuss details only 
"before the appropriate sub-
committees." 
Making the case for re-
spectability of covert opera-
tions, Colby cited participa-
tion of feminist Gloria 
helm' in CIA subsidized 
youth festival activities dur-: 
ing the late 1960s. He re-
cited a published testimon-
ial by Ms. Steinheim that. 
she and -fellow participants 
were free to say, what they 
pleased during their travels. 
? The forum before which, 
Colby spoke was a confer-, 
ence on "the, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Covert 
Action" sponsored by the 
Center.for National Security, 
Studies. Participants in-
cluded former national secu-
rity officials, ex-CIA agents, 
intelligence scholars ? and. 
journalists. 
In his prepared statdment; 
Colby took note of proposals 
that the CIA abandon its 
covert action programs car-
'red out by the directorate 
for clandestine services, col-
loquially known as the "De-
partment of Dirty Tricks." 
"This is a legitimate ques-
tion," Colby said. " In 
light of current American . 
policy, as I have indicated, it 
would not have a major im-
pact on our current activi-
ties or the current security 
of the United States." This 
-was a strong hint that coy-
-ert operatilins abroad have 
been reduced to a neglible 
level. 
But, the CIA director 
added, "a sovereign nation 
must look ahead to changing 
circumstances. I can envis-
age situations in which the 
United States might well 
need to conduct covert ac-. 
bon in the face of some new 
threat that developed in the 
world." 
But it was the consensus 
of most of the panelists, as 
stated yesterday by Herbert 
Scoville ? Jr., former CIA 
deputy director for science 
and technology,-that covert 
operations consistently 
"interfere with legitimate 
intelligence collection" by 
the agency. He urged that 
the function, if it were nec-
essary at all, should be spun 
off to a separate agency. 
Other ' participants, Ells-
berg and former National, 
roverrPorRerease--2ooi/08/08-TCIA--RDP77-00432R0001130340007-3-
n r nts Chile, 
Security' Council staffer 
Morton Halperin, objected 
on grounds that the covert 
prograins abroad institution-
alize illegal. actions against 
foreign governments or po-' 
litical -movements. Author 
David, Wise also. objected 
that rtlie secret- activities 
also required *a policy of 
"plausible deniability" on 
the part of U,Sf. L officials 
when, pnblicly questioned. 
about thein. 2 
Colby told Sen: Janne.
Abourezk (D-S.D.), chairman: 
of yeSterday's session, that 
he :has proscribed the' 
phrase "plausible denial" 
.from use at CIA headquar-
ters. 
"I do not- feel that I can 
tell the American people an 
untruth," said the CIA di-
rector, his face composed 
behind neutral-shaded shell 
eyeglasses as guffaws ech-
oed through the hearing 
chamber. 
When Abourezk asked. 
Colby about an article ap-
pearing in last Sunday edi-
tion of The Washington Post 
alluding to a $350,000 Na-
tional Security Council au-
thorization for -bribery of 
the Chilean Congress in 
1970, Colby responded: 
"Those are details I'm dot 
going to talk about." 
Asked whether his agency 
undertakes action abroad 
which would be deemed 
criminal in the United 
'States,-; Colby said quietly, 
"Of course. Espionage is a, 
crime in the Unites States." 
16 
Colby was 'also pressed on - - 
whether he could provide 
assurances that corporations 
- controlled by Viice Presiden-
tial nominee Nelson A. 
Rockfeller , and his family 
, would not be used as CIA 
"covers" in the future. "This 
would not be a useful sub- . 
'ject for Me. to discuss," he' 
answered. - ? - 
The major piece of thea-
.ter was provided by Ells-
, berg, who ;announced to 
ColbyC that he had. just. 
learned from testimony 
gathered by Sen.. Howard H. 
Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) that CIA 
. officials had evidence?long 
before they admitted it?of 
the burglary of his psychia-
trist's office. 
"You have much to an-, 
swer for," Ellsbeig said in' 
Ihis peroration. "Not very , 
much to mc very little." 
Colby answered with the 
only touch of heat he 
brought to the room. He 
challenged Ellsberg to sup-
port his accusation that "I. 
do not support the constitu-
tion and, do not understand 
"I understand ? it," said 
Colby to Ellsberg, "as well 
,,as you-do." 
- As yesterday's, session 
, wound to its cloke a young 
woman in a red dress leaped 
to her feet and shouted; 
"You are not only a liar, you. 
are a Nazi; teo." Colby peer-
ed back expressionlessly and 
replied, "I deny that,"

C.I.A. Ch.i.f Says Covert 
? By SEYMOUR M. HERSH_ 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, ? Sept. 13?
William E. Colby,' Director of 
Central Intelligence, said today 
that there Would be no "major 
impact" on-the nation's security 
if the United States ceased' all 
cloak - and - dagger operations 
against ? foreign countries. 
"The .current status of the 
world is such that we do not 
appear to be threatened at this 
time," Mr. Colby told a con-
ference on the Central Intelli-
gence . Agency and covert 
activity. "The Capitol will still 
;stand whether ?any particular 
!action does or ? does not take 
place." 
' .'The C.I.A. director ? spent 
more than three hours making 
a speech and answering often; 
hostile questonS from the panel-
ists and audience at the two-
day conference, sponsored byl 
the newly formed Center for 
National Security Studies. 
?, Against Curtailment 
. He made it clear, both in his 
prepared address and during' 
the question-and-answer ses-
sion, that he did npt wish to 
see the agency's clandestine op-
erations curtailed. Those op-
erations, officially known as 
covert actions, have been the, 
focus of dispute this week in 
Congress because of the dis-
elosude that the C.I.A. was au-
thorized to spend more than 
$8-million..from 1970 to 1973 
in an effort to make it difficult 
for President Salvador Allende 
Gossens of Chile to govern. 
More than $7-million of the 
authorized funds was spent. 
"I think it would be mistaken 
to deprive our nation ?of the 
possibility of some moderate 
overt action response to a 
foreign problem and leave us 
with nothing between a diplo-
matic protest and sending in 
the Marines," Mr. Colby said 
in his prepared address. 
Activities 
Aren't Vitali 
Later, in response to a ques-
tion Mr. Colby declared that 
"these days, "in view of the 
world situation and our poli-
cies, we're not spending much 
effOrt" on cladestine activities. 
"We're keeping our powder 
and musket dry," he said. 
I Mr. Colby's statements ac-
knowledging that clandestine 
'operations were not vital, to 
the nation's ? security did not 
iseem to indicate, any impending 
!change in the Ford Administra-
tion's approach to such activi-
ties. The C.I.A. director was ap-
parently giving a candid assess-
ment of the value of such ac-
tivities?as viewed by him to-
day. 
' When a panelist, Richard J. 
'Barnet, author and former Ken-
nedy Administration aide, asked 
whether he could envision any 
national security threats that 
would justify covert activity in 
Latin America', Asia or Africa, 
Mr. Colby said,. "There are 
some, yes." , ? ? ' 
"By security - of the United 
States," he repeated, "I do not' 
mean that the Capitol will fall 
by night. There are certain 
things that today are not an 
immediate danger to the United 
States but could become so." 
Discussing Chile, Mr. Colby 
again denied that the C.I.A. 
played any direct role in the 
overthrow of the latE,President 
Allende. "We :did. look forward 
to a change in government," he 
said to caustic laughter from 
the 'crowded Senate hearing 
room, "but by elections in 1976." 
Although he had announced 
that he would not discuss any 
specific details concerning the 
C.I.A.'s clandestine involvement 
in Chile, Mr. 'Colby all but spe-
cifically confirmed that the 
agency had been heavily in-
volved. 
Insisting that Congress had 
been kept informed about the 
clandestine activities there, Mr. 
Colby declared, "I can't sasS1 
that every doliar the C.I.A.]

?I. ? 
- Dirty Tricks In Chile 
I spent in Chile was individually 
approved [by intelligence com-
mittees], but there was a series 
of discussions." 
He took note of a letter, pub-
lished last week, describing the 
agency's activities in Chile be-
tween 1964 and 1.973 that had 
been written earlier this year 
by Rerpresentative Michael S. 
Harrington. Democrat of Massa-
chusetts. "At various times dur-
ing that period." Mr. Colby said, 
"the maior steps were brought 
to the attention of the chair-
man or various. members of : 
Ithose committees." 
1 His account of the congres-
sional overview was challenged 
by Mr. Harrington and another 
member of Congress attending! 
the conference, Senator James, 
Abourezk, Democrat of South! 
Dakota. Mr. Abourezk ques-1 
tioned whether the C.I.A. 'wasl 
providing up-to-date briefings 
about current clandestine op-
erations to the Congress; Mr. 
Harrington urged a broader, 
and more critical, Congressional 
overview of CiI.A. activities. 
In an obvious rebuke to those 
who advocated more C.I.A. 
disclosure to Congressional. 
committees, Mr. Colby com-
plained that what he termed 
"the leak" about the 'Chilean, 
involvement "raises the dilem-
ma of how we're going to 
supply the Congress with such 
delicate information without its 
disclosure." - 
"This is a matter, of course,: 
for, the Congress to decide,!'; 
he added. 
Throughout his long appear-, 
ance today, Mr. Colby expressed: 
little emotion and remained 
calm, even .when confronted 
with personal denunciations and 
accusations that he had .lied. 
The sharpest response from the 
audience came during a series 
of question's about his participa-
tion in the Vietnam pacification 
program and his direct role with 
Operation Phoenix, a C.I.A.-
involved program designed ."to 
, ? According to apparently well-founded 
reports, Central Intelligence Agency 
Director Williiiii?Colbr-has-'-privately 
,told a Congressional committee that the 
Nixon Administration authorized more 
than $8 million for clandestine disrup-
tion of the Allende regime in Chile be-
tween 1970 and 1973. These operations, 
designed to "destabilize" that country 
and make it ipipossible for Allende to 
roof out the Vietcong infra-' 
structure" that has been widely 
Criticized. It has been charged 
that the program resulted in the 
deaths of more than 20,000: 
Vietnamese. 
"How many did you 
one youth shouted from the au-
dience. ? . 
' "I didn't kill arisc," Mr. Colby 
'responded. 
? At one point, panelist Daniel 
Ellsberg, who 'has said he was 
responsible for turning over the 
Pentagon Papers to the press 
. ? 
in 1971, delivered a lengthy 
summary of the G.I.A.'s involve-
ment in Watergate, provoking 
:an exchange with Mr. Colby 
that 'provided no new informa-
tion about the known involve-
ment of the agency in the 
!break-in at the office of Dr. 
'Ellsberg's Psychiatrist. 
' Earlier, in response to a ques-
tion from Dr. Ellsberg, Mr. Col-
by had .acknowledged that .the 
.C.I.A. may have' had advance 
linformation about the impend-
ling, coup d'etat in Chile that 
was not forwarded .to the Al.
Government. 
Mr. Colby,. who had agreed 
to attend the, two-day confer-
ence before the press .dis-
closures of the covert activities 
in Chile, pointedly noted in his 
prepared remarks that such ac-
tivities were conducted "only 
when specitically authorized by 
the National Security Council.'" 
"Thus," he 'added, 
vert actions reflect national 
policy." 
A number of high officials 
have told The New York Times t 
this week that much of the 
impetus for the 'clandestine 
policy against the Allende Gov-
ernment was ? supplied by Sec-
retary of State Kissinger, who 
was serving as former Presi-
dent Nivon's national security 
adviser in 1970.

Allende's Fall, 
By Laurence R. Birns 
The disclosure that the United 
States had directly participated in the 
economic and political undermining of 
the Government of President Salvador 
Allende GossenS of Chile between 1970 
and -1973 is only part of the dismal 
tale of what took place between Wash-
ington and Santiago during the three 
years he held office. 
Viewed in its entirety, this tale re-
veals the poverty of this nation's Latin-
American policy, the staggering im-
morality of the policy's architects and 
the ineffectuality and irrelevance of 
most scholars, journalists and Congres-
sional leaders, whose professional obli-
&lion it was to oversee executive 
policies toward Chile during this 
period. 
' Now we know that William E. Colby, 
the Director of Central Intelligence, in 
secret testimony last April, told Con-
gress that the Nixon Administration 
had authorized more than $8- million 
'for covert Central Intelligence Agency 
activities between 1970 and 1973 in - 
an effort to make it impossible for 
Dr. Allende to govern. - 
? Those of us w'ho had watched 
United States policy at the time felt 
in' our bones that this country was 
intent on establishing the climate for 
the 'overthrow of the democratically 
elected President?Dr. Allende died in 
a violent coup d'etat Sept. 11, 1973?
but we lacked the proof. Our dilemma 
was plain in that we did not have the 
data to support our instincts, when 
such evidence would have been of 
most use in attempting, if futilely, to 
influence Washington's policy. But we 
knew that the workings of what we 
considered Washington's invisible gov-
ernment would -be revealed only long 
after the events had become the raw 
material for footnotes in history books 
and the people involved had minced 
off to some new assignment. ? 
Still, in spite of our incredulity, of 
our.skepticism, we were reluctant to 
believe that the former Ambassador 
to Chile, Edward M. Kerry; the former 
Assistant Secretary of State for Latin-
-American Affairs,. Charles A. Meyer; 
and our respected Secretary of State, 
Henry A. Kissinger, would practice 
such professional duplicity and such 
public deception. 
After all, they Were as one in re-
peatedly saying that the United States 
bad played no role in the violent endhi 
ing of Chile's constitutional regime or 
had not carried out any other previous 
form of intervention, and when they 
did hint at the truth in Congressional 
inquiries after the coup they were 
always heard in the secrecy of execu-
tive session, as if the public was too 
immature to know, or the officials too 
embarrassed to tell. 
Even before this, it was known that 
this nation had maintained a calcu-
lated campaign to strangle Chile 
economically. Richard M. Nixon as 
President, and his Treasury Secretary 
at the time, John B. Connally, had in 
1971 initiated a policy of economic 
a shil:igton's Push 
denial in United States lending agen-
cies, as well as in the regional and 
international aid organizations, and 
Chile became a fiscally besieged island. 
This was done though international 
law (that historic handmaiden of the 
Western trading nations) had not been 
fully served in that Chilean adminis-
trative procedures had not been ex-
hausted when the United States policy 
of retribution for the legal nationali-
zation of Kennecott Copper Corpora-
? 
tion's mines had begun. 
. Leading United States apologists of 
the fall of the Allende Government 
previously have tended to give, an 
economic justification for it. The sce-
nario was a rather plain one. The eco-
nomic policies of the President, a 
Marxist, polarized the population. The 
opposition political parties. that sup-
ported the coup did so when Dr. 
Allende closed the political road. In 
any event, Dr. Allende was a minority 
President and did not have the neces-
sary consensus to undertake such radi-
cal changes. Thus, it was not United 
States policy that cut Dr. Allende off, 
from the possibilities of surviving, but 
rather the result of his own haphazard 
Jdomestic policies. 
The apologists neglected to men-
tion that only once in this century 
has Chile had a majority President?
from 1964 to 1970?and that some 
two-thirds of the population had 
voted in 1970 for candidates espousing 
policies .of nationalization and reform. 
The apologists' view was upheld by. 
? Prof. P. N. Rosenstein-Rodan, director 
of the Center for Latin American De-
velopment Studies of Boston Univer-
sity, in a lengthy contribution to this 
newspaper recently in which he as-
serted that "Allende died not because 
he was a socialist, but because he was 
an incompetent." 
But apparently now, in his view, 
things have improved. Dr. Rosenstein-
Roden stated in a report to an agency 
for the Alliance for Progress, Chile 
has a "strong and intelligent" eco-
nomic policy and a "Jean Monnet" 
,directing it. This, as the people starve., 
'Professor Rosenstein-Rodan has had 
little to say about the civic decencies 
that Dr. Allende had strived to main-
tain,.. which the military now has 
cruelly destroyed. or the contribution, 
that the Opposition Christian Demo-
cratic party had made to the "polari-
zation" and !'chaos" of Chile's national 
life. He thinks of himself as dispas-
sionate, but by his choice of themes, 
elimination of untidy evidence and 
priorities, he is ideological to the 
marrow. 
For a host of other academics, edi-
torial writers and some leading United 
States intellectuals, such as Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr., the thin reed of their 
case that Dr. Allende had brought 
"it" upon himself has all but vanished 
in the disclosure of the C.I.A.'s role. 
It would be more accurate to have 
said that it was the intent of our 
nation's policy to bring "it" upon 
him because our goal was to "de-
,stabilize" Chile by pouring millions 
of dollars into' vulnerable corners of 
that nation's national life, not to heal 
but, to. kill. , , 
111 
Americans who earlier in the year 
witnessed the effects of the United 
States national truckers' strike and 
the breakdown of petroleum supplies 
in our own nation could well imagine 
the frailties of the infinitely weaker 
economy of the intended victim. 
It would seem that Dr. Allende's 
sole crime was that he felt that for-
eign control of Chilean copper re-
,sources was intolerable, just as Mr. 
Nixon felt that the United States 
could not allow a continuing. depend-
ence on feign oil supplies. ' ? 
For Chile, the United States Govern-
ment had two possible roads to travel: 
cne of correct diplomatic relations 
(perhaps even favoredlreatment, since 
Chile's was one of the few remaining 
representative governments- in the re-
gion) er political chicanery. Regret-
,tably,./Vir. Kissinger, a recipient of the 
Nobel Peace Prize, systematically 
chose the latter?a course that helped 
to bring on a brutal military take-
over that cost thousands of lives, with 
Chile now being dragged into the 
Stone Age: 
Present conditions in Chile have 
been carefully noted by a number of 
impartial investigative teams that have 
traveled to that nation, as well as by 
repeated utterances of church groups 
inside, and outside Chile. The jails are 
crammed with political prisoners, mili-
tary law operates and the civil courts 
are defunct, total press censorship 
exists, the political parties of all per-
suasions are banished, and trade un-
ion activity has been terminated. The 
nation is now a barrack, and freedom 
of expression has been sent to the 
wall. 
During his administration, Dr. Al-
lende was scrupulously correct in 
.maintaining unimpaired, under un-
relieved internal and external pres-
sure, all the nation's institutions. Not 
a single political prisoner !could be 
found in jail, not a single newspaper 
was censored by the civilian authori-
ties and opposition'-political parties 
could rage at will against the Govbrn-
ment. 
Why does Mr. 'Kissinger prefer tile_ 
present over the past? Chile now over 
Chile then? Why was this clever and 
capable man so simplistic ip conceiv-
ing of Chile as an allegedly "Commu-
nist" nation that must be suborned 
and so sophisticated in treating with 
such self-identified- Communist na-
tions as China, the Soviet Union and, 
most recently, East Germany? 
In retrospect, his sins are more than 
the lies and deceptions; he has tra-
duced the meager remains of our in-
ternational reputation and the honor 
of this nation by espousing a plan of 
action that was not only vulgarly 
cruel, but amateurishly and patently 
ineffective given the current state of 
Chile's economy. 
If, in the recent chaotic past, he 
felt nfoved to offer the nation his 
resignation on an issue of personal 
honor in the Watergate wiretap affair, 
surely our nation has the obligation 
to solicit and, if refused, to demand 
his resignation 'over this far more

The' 
Disclbsure that the Central Intelligence: Ageney ,au-
thorized more than $8 million for Covert activities aimed? 
first at preventing Salvador,Allende's election as-Presi 
dent of Chile and then at "destabilizing". his Marxist 
Government Would be appalling enough by itself. It is 
doubly.so when stacked against flat denials of any such' 
United States intervention or policy to intervene, some 
of it in sworn testimony before committees of Congress, 
bY former 'and present Government officials. ? 
?, In secret testimony before a House subcommittee last'. 
April, C.I.A. Director William E. Colby said his ageney 
:authorized $500,000 to aid Dr. Allende's opponents in the' 
.1970 election; $350,000 to bribe. Chilean legislators to 
.vote against him when the election was thrown into the 
? Congress, and $6.5 million -:for subsequent "destabilize-. 
tion" activities and for helping anti-Allende candidates' 
'in the 1971 municipal elections. : . 
This conflicts directly with testimony before a ?Senate' 
[ Foreign Relations subcommittee by former AmbassadOr, 
Edward- M. Korry that i.`the' United States .did not -Seek 
?to- pressure, subvert, influence a single member of -thec 
? Chilean Congress" during his four years.in Chile, and:by, 
. former Assistant Secretary of State Charles "A.' Meyer 
-that "we bought no votes; we funded ifei candidates, We 
promoted no COdps." 
. , . 
..During .part of the period when . yr: Colby sAys. the 
...C.I.A. was financing "destabilizing" activities; Ambassa7 
? dor Korry says-the was carrying on secret negotiations 
? with President Allende; looking toward uninterrupted 
. American cOoperation and financial aid, provided Chile 
did not act with undue hostility toward the United States. 
'These efforts, he says, were undermined by extremists 
in Dr. Allende's popular Unity coalition. . 
Are we to-believe that Ambassador Korry and the State 
?Departtnent were endeavoring to stabilize Dr: Allende's 
Government while the C.I.A. was frying to "destabilize"-
it?-Could the American Ainbassador. in.Santiago and the 
sobering matter of not only attempting 
to bribe Chile's democratically elected 
Congress tO withhold ratification of 
? Dr. Allende's taking office, and foment-
ing civic disorder, but denying it in 
sworn testimony as well. If a resigna-
tion is not forthcoming, an honorable 
United States Congress must move to 
impeach. 
America and certain Americans bear 
a heavy hand in the unjustified tor-
ment that has been visited upon Chile. 
That lovely little land and its good 
people deserved a more benign fate, 
and, for that matter, so did we. ? 
Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs' 
have been ignorant of what the C.I.A. was -doing---or 
was the C.I.A. in truth a law unto itself? 
And What of the role of Henry A. Kissinger in this 
sordid affair? Throughout the period he 'headed the 
so-called Forty Committee which supervises C.I.A. oper-
ations ?and, according to Mr. Colby, approved in advance 
'the 'coVert ?activities in-Chile: Yet, Mr. -Korry says that-ow 
-a trip to Washington in 1971 he got approval from both 
Mr. Kissinger at the National Security Council and Sec-
retary of State William P. Rogers for his proposal of 
cooperation with Chile in a compensated take-over of 
American copper interests. Mr.- Kissinger told the Senate 
Foreign Relations Commiteee that "to the best of my 
knowledge, and belief," the C.I.A. "had nothing to do" 
with the military coup that overthrew Dr,Allende. 
, ? * ? ? * ? 
It is riowup to President Ford to find out who is 
actually in charge of United States foreign. policy in 
sensitive areas of the world, and, whether anyone in 
fact controls the operations of the C.I.A. 
''Of far greater importance than the bizarre spectacle 
.of. two United States agencies trying simultaneously 
to stabilize and .destabilize" an elected Government is 
that fact that in inadequately controlled C.I.A. badly 
, served the American national interest by its dirty work 
in Chile. It matters not that the Soviet Union does far 
worse, that Fidel. Castro intervened' far more out-'. 
?rageously in Chile than did the United States, or that 
extremists in Dr. Allende's camp would ,in any even4 
. have destroyed the Chilean democracy on their own. 
Clearly, the so-called C.I.A. "oversight" committees in 
Senate and House are failing to do their job. Representa-

17 September 1974 
Perjury Inquiry Urged on Chile Dafa. 
Panel Gets Report , 
By Laurence Stern ? 
. Washington Post Staff Writer 
? A Senate staff report recommends 
that a ,perjury investigation be initi-
ated against former Central Intelli-
gence Agency Director Richard M. 
Helms and accuses Secretary of State' 
Henry A. Kissinger of having "de-
.ceived" the Senate Foreign Relations ? 
Committee in sworn testimony. 
The report, which centers on testi-
mony given by high-ranking officials 
on U.S covert intervention in Chile's 
internal political affairs, also recom-
mends perjury and contempt investi-
gations of three other government wit-
nesses in the Chile inquiry. 
Prepared by Jerome Levinson, chief 
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Subcommittee on Multinational 
Corporations, the confidential report 
will be taken up for possible action to-
day at an executive session of the 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
? ? The committee has the option of 
e'hdorsing or rejecting the report in 
whole or in part. 
. The targets- of the proposed investi-
gations are former Assistant Secretary, 
t-of State for Inter-American Affairs 
, Charles E. Meyer, former U.S. Am-
bassador to Chile' Edward Korry, and, 
William Brae, former chief of the 
CIA's Latin American Division. 
The report, submitted to subcom-
mittee chairman Sen. Frank Church 
(D-Idaho) and Sen. Clifford P. Case 
.(R-N.J.), also asks that the record of 
Kissinger's confirmation hearing be 
reopened in public .session to question 
the secretary on the "rationale" for 
U.S. covert political actions in Chile 
after 1969. 
It further recommended that Kis-
'singer be asked to testify generally on 
U.S. policy toward "duly elected gov-
ernments which may be anticipated 
not to follow policies to the liking 
of the United States." 
The staff recommendations 
reflected rising concern in 
Congress over major discrepan-
cies in the sivorn testimony of 
high State Department wit-
nesses and the disclosure af 
'secret 'testimony last A pri1,22 
by CIA Director' William E. 
ColbY that the agency'spent $3 
million in Chile to foil the late 
Salvadore Allende's candidacy 
in 1964 and SII million attempt-
ing to block his election and 
undermine, his government af-
ter 1969. ? 
The report cites previously 
secret testimony by Kissinger, 
'delivered at an executive ses-
sion of his confirmation hear-
ing on Sept. 17, 1973, minimiz-
ing the rele of the CIA in the 
1970 Allende election, 
It quotes Kissinger as 
saying: 
? "The CIA was heavily in-
volved in 1964 in the election, 
was in a very minor way in-
volved in the 1970 election and 
since then we have absolutely 
stayed wt13', from any coups. 
Our efforts in Chile were to' 
strengthen the democratic po-
litical parties and give them a 
?A0pfove4-F 
basis for winning the ,election 
in 1976, which we expressed 
our hope , was .that Allende 
could be defeated In a free 
democratic election." 
At the time Kissinger gave 
his testimony, the report 
noted, "the Forty Committee 
[the National Securitye Coun-
cil's senior covert \ action 
panel]. had already authorized 
the expenditure of . . . 
lion for' the purpose of desta-
bilizing the Allende govern-
ment.so as to precipitate its 
downfall." 
. Only a month before, Kis-
singer testified, the report fur-
-ther noted, the Forty Commit-
tee--which he' chaired?au7 
thoriZed the expenditure of $r 
million of this amount for 
"further political destabiliza-
tion." 
The basis for these assers'. 
tions was the Colby testimony 
as recounted by Rep. Michael 
Harrington (D-Mass.), 'a mem-
ber of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. The CIA's 
only comment on the Harring-
ton disclosure was to question 
whether Colby has used the, 
word "destabilization" in his 
April 22 testimony to a Ilbuse*. 
CIA oversight committee 
chaired, by Rep. Lucien Nedzi-
(D-Mich.). 
Colby's only 'personal com-
ment on the Harrington report 
was that he would neither con-
firm nor deny its authenticity 
since it was given in executive 
session. Last Friday Colby' 
commented that the disclosure 
of his testimony through a 
confidential letter by Harring-
ton to his chairman, ? Rep. 
Thomas Morgan (D-Pa.) raised 
questions about the ability of 
government witnesses to Jes-
tify on "delicate" matters. 
The report described as 
"disingenuous" Kissinger's tes-
timony that since 1970 "we 
have absolutely stayed away 
' from any coups" in Chile. Kis-
singer, wrbte Levinson, "must 
have known that expending, 
funds for the express purpose 
of creating political destabili-
zation had to enhance the pos-
sibility, indeed the probability, 
of the. coup which, in fact, 
took place." 
In the case of Helins, the re. 
port cited an exchange be.' 
tween the former CIA direstor 
and one of his leading senato-
lila]. defenders, Stuart Symingr, 
ton (D-Mo.). during an execu-
tive hearing on the Helms 
? nomination as ambassador to 
Iran, on Feb. 7, 1973. . 
Symington: Did you have 
any money passed to the oppo-
nents of Allende? 
Helms: No, sir. 
. Symington: So_ that the sto-
ries that you were involved in 
that are wrong entirely? , 
? Helms: Yes sir 
But Colby's testimony, as re-
ported in the Harrington let-
ter, ? was that the CIA ex-
pended $500,000 in 1969 . to have not."

during the 1970 election $500,- '-
000 was given to opposition 
party personnel. After .the 
Sept. 4 popular .election in 
which Allende won a plurality, 
the account continued, $350,-
000 was authorized "to bribe 
the Chilean Congress" in an 
effort to "overturn" the re-
sults of the popular election in 
an' ensuing congressional run-
off. - 
The staff report alluded, for 
'the first time, to the existence 
of a National Security Council 
Decision Memorandum prior 
to Allende's el,ction which 
served as the 'umbrella" under 
'which the Forty Committee au-
thorized clandestine activities 
designed to ' destabilize the 
Allende government. 
Such a policy document 
would-have- been drafted tin-
der the direction of Kissinger 
who also chaired the Forty 
Committee meetings at which 
the anti-Allende aCtion pro-
grams were authorized. -  
The report was also critical 
of Assistant Secretary of the 
Treasury for International Af-
fairs John .111. Hennessy, who 
assisted in coordinating U.S. 
economic :policy toward the 
Allende government that 
leaned heavily toward with-
drawal of lines= of credit by 
such international lending 
bodies as the World Bank,'In-
ter-Americatis = ? Development 
Bank and Export-Import Bank_ 
Hennessy, said the Levinson 
report, "either perjured him-
self or seriously misled the 
subcommittee in stating that 
the primary consideration in 
U.S. economic policy toward 
the Allende government was 
Chile's credit-worthiness." ? 
Broe, the CIA's highest-
ranking operative for Latin 
America. was quoted in the re-
port as having testified that t : 
there Was no U.S. policy Win-
tervene in the 1970 Chilean 
election. Broe's answers, 
ever, are "technically shy Oi 
perjury," 'the.report,, 
cbn-
eluded, though they were 
"intended to convey the im-
pression of a policy..of non?in-
terverithan." ? 
The testimony of Nathaniel 
Davis, U.S. ambassador , to 
Chile during last year's anti-
Allende coup, conformed? to 
?the "overall pattern of State 
Department witnesses dissem-, 
bling and deceiving the com-
mittee and subcommittee with 
respect to the true scope .of 
U.S. government activities de-
signed to undermine the Al-
lende regime," the Levinson 
report added; No action, how-
ever, was recommended 
against Davis. 
Kissinger, and Meyer were 
not available for comment.

AGAII\ ST UDR 
DEFENDED BY FORD 
Asserts Activities in Chile 
. Were 'in Best Interests' 
of Chileans and U.S. 
" By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times 
- WASHINGTON, Sept. 16?
President Ford strongly defend-
ted tonight the clandestine use 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency to assist anti-Allende 
forces in Chile, but he denied 
that the United States Govern-
!rnent had any involvement in 
ithe bloody coup there last year. 
The President, in his news 
'Conference, contended that the 
C.J.A. activities were authorized 
because "there was an effort 
being made by the Government 
of Salvador Allende to destroy? 
opposition news media and to 
destroy opposition political 
parties." He said this was some-
thing all governments did and 
he defended it in principle. 
Earlier, The New York Times 
learned that the staff of a Sen-
ate Foreign Relations subcom-
mittee -had recommended that 
charges' of contempt of Con-
gress be placed against Richard 
Helms, former Director of Cen-
tral. Intelligence, and three 
'retired Nixon Administration 
officials on the ground of mis-
leading -testimony oh the .clan-
destine attivities in Chile. 
'Certain Actions' Cited 
Mr. Ford's statements on 
Chile were the firSt by a high 
Administration, official since 
newspaper reports a week ago 
that the C.I.A. was authorized 
to spend more than $8-million 
from 1970 to 1973 to make it 
impossible for President Salva-
dor Allende Gossens of Chile to 
govern. - 
1. Asked .about those reports, 
the President made what 
'amounted to a broad defense 
of such clandestine operations. 
"Our Government, like other 
governments, does take certain 
actions in the intelligence field 
to help implement foreign pol,, 
iicy and protect national secu-
rity," Mr. Ford said. [Ques-
tion 7, Page 22.] 
He added that he had been 
"reliably" informed that "Com-
munist nations spend vastly 
.more money than we do for the 
'same kind of purpose." 
The C.I.A. etfort in Chile, the 
President said, "was made in 
this case to help and assist the 
preservation of opposition 
newspapers and electronic me-
dia and to preserve opOPP601V 
political Parties."' ' ? ?'' 
"I think this Is in the best 
interests of the people in Chile 
and certainly in our best in-
terest," he added. 
. .Mr. Ford's account of the 
type and purpose of the inter-
vention in- Chile differed in 
part, at least, with that ? pro-
vided to Congress last April by 
William E. Colby, the present 
head of the C.I.A. . 
? Mr. Colby testified that 
$350,000 was authorized by, 
the 40 Committe ,the secret' 
high-level intelligence review 
panel headed by Secretary of 
State Kissinger, to bribe mem-
bers of the Chilean Parliament 
, in late 1970, shortly before the 
Mr. Al-
Parliament ratified 
. . 
lende's election. ? - 
The report by the staff of a 
Senate subcommitte' report in-
volved a different aspect of the 
. dispute over Chile?allegations 
that high-ranking officials of 
the Nixon Administration de-
liberately misled- the Senate. 
, The sources said that, be-
sides Mr. Helms, the report 
cited Charles A. Meyer, former. 
Assistant Secretary of State for 
Inter-American Affairs, Edward 
M. Korry, Ambassador to Chile 
from 1957 to 1971, and William 
V. Broe, former director of 
clandestine activities for the 
Central Intelligence Agency in 
Latin America. 
Mr. Helms, Mr. Meyer and 
John M. Hennessy, former As-
sistant Secretary of the Treas-
ury for International Affairs, 
the report said, might have 
committed perjury in testimony 
before the Subcommittee on 
Multinational Corporations in 
the spring of 1973. 
None of the men named in 
the. subcommittee report couldi 
be reached immediately for 
comment. 
In his news conference to-
night, President Ford defended 
the Nixon Administration's de-
cision to intervene clandestine-
ly in 1970 in Chile, declaring 
that the newly elected MarXist 
Government there made an "ef-
fort to destroy ethe opposition 
media and to destroy opposition 
political parties." 
Such intervention was needed, 
Mr. Ford said, because the Corn-
munist nations spend vast 
amdunts of money" in similar 
activities. 
The staff report, written' by 
-Jerome I. Levinson, chief coun-
sel of the subcommittee, was 
prepared last week at the re-
quest of Senator Frank Chtirch, 
Democrat of Idaho; who is 
chairman of the subcommittee. 
Details of Mr. Levinson's re-
port, which was distributed to 
subcommittee members over the 
weekend, were provided to The 
New York Times .by a Senator's 
office. 
At issue is the discrepancy 
between the testimony pre-
sented to the subcommittee' 
last year about the clandestine 
role of the C.I.A. in Chile and 
recent news reports indicating 
that the intelligence agency 
had been authorized to spend 
more than $8-million from 
1970 to 1973 in a covert at-
tempt to make it impossible 
for the Chilean President, Sal-
vador Allende Gossens, to

' In' additioh, sourees said, the' 
subcommittee staff report' 
cited Mr. Hennessey's sworn 
testimony that the Nixon Ad-
ministration's economic sanc-
tions against Chile were based 
exclusively on lower credit 
rating after Dr. Allende's elec-
tion. It was reported yester-
day that Secretary of State 
Kissinger, then President Nix-
on's adviser for national se-
curity affairs, had personally 
headed an interagency panel 
that decided shortly after Dr: 
Allende's election in 1970 to 
attempt to cut off all economic 
aid and international credits. 
The allegations against the 
five Nixon Administration of fi-, ? 
cials stem from their testimony 
at highly " publicized hearings 
into a reported attempt by offi-
cials of the International Tele- ? 
phone & Telegraph"Company to 
seek to interfer in Chile's do-
mestic politics. 
Mr. Korry and Mr. Meyer 
both .testified that the United 
States had continued its policy 
of nonintervention toward Chile 
'after Dr. Allende's elections. It 
was that testimony, sources' 
said, that led to the staff rec-
ommendation that contempt and' 
?in the case of Mr. Meyer?
possible perjury charges be 
considered. 
The testimony that led to the 
recommendation that Mr. Helms 
be charged with contempt and 
possibly perjury and Mr. Broe 
with contempt was apparently 
provided to the subcommittee 
at classified briefings, sources 
said. ? 
Mr. Church, in an interview 
last week, said he had author-
ized a staff review to determine 
if the. testimony should. be 
turned over to the Justice De-
partment for possible prose-
cution. 
The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee has scheduled a 
closed executive session tomor-
row to discuss, among other 
matters, what to do about ap-
parently misleading testimony 
provided to the Church sub-
committee. 
In an interview, Senator 
Clifford P. Case, Republican of 
New Jersey and a ranking mi-
nority member of the commit-
tee; declared, "There'll be a 
serious question as to what the 
committee. ought to do." 
Mr. Case refused to discuss 
specifically his personal reac-
tion to the staff report. 
"I certainly will press for ap-
propriate action," he said. "No 
. matter what, if a guy is caught 
lying to a Congressional heak, 
ing, there has to be some kind 
of action." 
Other Foreign Relations Com-
mittee sources said, however, 
that it was unlikely that the 
full committee would immedi-
ately agree to press for con-i 
tenipt of Congress or perjury 
citations against the witnesses., 
Far more important, the sourceg 
said, will be an attempt to de.t<

ministration influenced the yeti.: 
ous officials, including yire 
Helms, to he less than candid.

Special to 'rat Sine York Times 
WASHINGTON, Sept. P7--
The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, amid Congressional 
protests, over President Ford's 
defense of clandestine intelli-
gence operations, today author-
ized its staff to study available 
evidence that official testimony 
had been Misleading about the 
Central Intelligence Agency's 
involvement in Chile. 
Committee sources later eau-
' tioned that the Senators' deci-
sion, announced by Chairman 
J. W. Fulbright, Democrat of 
Arkansas, called only for a nee-
iiminary "pulling together'; of 
:testimony and not yet a full-
, fledged investigation into the 
t foreign policy of the Nixon 
:Administration. 
. "This is a very old problem," 
',Senator Fulbright told reporters 
after the long closed-door corn-
- mittee Meeting this morning. 
"The involvement of the C.LA. 
in other countries has been well-
, known for years. There's not 
much news in that" 
"In my view," he added, "it's 
:very q :estionable practice to go 
;beyond the collection of intelli-
gence. I personally have always 
thought they should be confined 
!". to intelligence gathering." 
'Outrage' Over Reports 
Some Senators later sug-
gested that the committee's 
reluctance to, proceed more 
'directly stemmed from 'what 
was depicted as' "outrage" 
over the publication ,today in 
,The New York Times and The 
:Washington Post of the gist of 
private subcommittee staff 
report recommending possible 
perjury and contempt-of-Con-
gress charges against five,gov-
ernment officials as failing to 
testify. .fully about the C.I.A. 
role in Chile. e. ? 
The staff report, prepared by 
Jeftime I. Levinson, chief 
-cotinsel. of the Subcommittee 
on Multinational! Corporations, 
was rejected today:. 
"The commotion over the 
leaks almost wiped the whole 
thing off .but they are going 
eahead," one source who at-
, tended the committee ? meeting 
said later. 
The disagreement inside the 
.committee over how to proceed 
with the inquiry was made 
clear, by Senator Frank 
Church, Democrat of Idaho 
and chairman of the Subcom-
mittee on the Multinational 
Corporations, which heard the 
apparently misleading testi-
mony during hearings into the 
International Telephone & Tele-
graph/ Corporation's involve-
ment in Chile in early 1973. 
"Our policy in Chile was un-
savory and unprincipled," Mr. 
Church told reporters today. 
"It can't possibly be justified 
unless 'we take the view that 
our methods and objectives are 
the same

Fulbright Noncommittal 
? Mr. Fulbright was noncom-
mittal, however, when asked 
whether he expected the staff 
investigation to lead to a re-
view of the Nixon Administra-
tion's foreign policies as well 
as the involvement of Secre-
tary of State Kissinger in the 
? Chilean decision-making, 
In his staff report, Mr. Levin-
son ? recommended that the 
Senate co.mm4ttee reopen Vst 
confirmation -hearings on Mr.; 
Kissinger, saying he "deceived" 
the committee about Chile. 
"We'll have to wait for the 
-report," Mr. Fulbright said. "I 
don't know. whether we should 
have further hearings or not." 
Mr. Fulbright, who reported-
ly has -been offered the am-
bassadorship to Britain after 
he leaves the Senate, depicted 
the publication of the Levinson 
report as "regrettable" and 
added that "the staff has no 
business tputtink out tem-
randa of that sort." 
A similar view was expressed 
by Senator Claiborne Pell, 
Democrat of Rhode Island, as 
he left the , closed hearing. 
Asked whether there was corn. 
itnittee concern over the C.I.A. 
involvement in Chile, Mr. Pell 
said that "the concern was 
more that statements . should, 
be made by Senators, and not 
by, staff." ? 
Committee sources said that 
the staff of the Foreign Reis-, 
tions Committee, directed byt 
Pat. M. Holt, was requested tot 
complete it preliminary review1 
of the veidence by next week. 
These persons said that the new 
study would incorporate sorne, 
of the findings of the Levinson 
report. ? 
. " Mr. Levinson, in his memo-
randum, called for possible per-
jury and contempt of Congress 
proceedings against Richard .

tral Intelligence, William V. 
Broe, a former C.I.A. official, 
Charles A. Korry, who was Am-
bassador to Chile from 1967 
to 1971. 
By Joseph C. Harsch 
Three recent events in the news 
suggest fairly strongly that the role of 
the Central Intelligence Agency needs 
some pretty serious rethinking. 
First was the discovery that Presi-
dent Nixon attempted N#ith some 
preliminary and partial success to 
use the CIA for domestic partisan 
political ends. We trust this will not 
'happen again soon, but it is un-
thinkable that the CIA should become 
an instrument of domestic faction-
alism. More,.eafeguards? are,, desir-
able. 
Second is the strong 'suspicion that 
the CIA gave too much comfort for far 
too long to the now thoroughly dis: 
credited former regime of the colo-
nels in Athens. That regime caused a 
lot of trouble. The worst thing it did 
was to unleash the coup d'etat on 
Cyprus against Archbishop Makarios 
which brought down his regime, un-
leashed a wave of terror, brought in a. 
massive Turkish Army to Cyprus, and 
undid a generation of patient effort to 
produce peaceful coexistence be-
tween Greeks and Turks on Cyprus. 
The national interests of the United 
? Slates in the eastern Mediterranean 
are best served by good relations 
between Greeks and Turks. Anything 
that embitters rather than improves 
Greek-Turkish relations deserves the 
United States. Insofar as the CIA 
supported and encouraged the colo-
nels it injured the best interests of its 
own country. The evidence seems 
pretty clear that the colonels did get 
some CIA aid. The whole matter 
ought to be brought into the open as a 
first step toward changes which can 
prevent a repetition el such counter-
productive activity. 
Third, the evidence is now impres-
sive that the CIA sought deliberately 
to prevent Salvador Allende from 
becoming President of Chile and 
when he did, in 1970, spent more 
money in an attempt to "destabilize" 
that regime. 
The official policy of the Govern-
ment of the United States toward the 
Allende regime was one of tolerance 
and noninterference. The State De-
partment insists 'that it refrained 
from any interference in Chile's inter-
nal affairs which, so far as the State 
Department itself is concerned, may 
well be true. The State Department 
isn't supposed to know what the 
covert side of CIA is up to. Sometimes 
It actually doesn't, although Henry 
.Kissinger, then at the White House, 
sat on a special subcommittee of the 
National Security Council which ap-
proved the project of "destabilizing" . 
the Allende experiment in Chile. 
The point here is that the bringing 
down of the Allende regime was, an 
act of clandestine war against a 
theoretically friendly government. It 
was authorized covertly by a covert 
branch of the executive establish-
ment. This infringed upon the eon-
stitutional right of the Congress to 
declare war. It was the waging . of 
covert and undeclared war by a 
branch of the government which has 
no constitutional right to do such 
things. ? 
Granted the Soviets do precisely 
such things. And it often boomerangs 
against them. 
The lesson surely is that bringing 
down a supposedly friendly govern-
ment is much too serious a business to 
be entrusted to clandestine operatois. 
If the Congress chooses to declare 
war on a foreign country, it then 
becomes the duty of the executive 
establishment to implement that pol-
icy. But it's time to get the initiative 
in such matters back into the public 
domain. 
Perhaps it did seem desirable back 
In 1964 to try to keep Senor Allende out 
of office in Chile. And undoubtedly it 
seemed desirable to a- lot of people in 
high places in Washington to keep him 
out of office in 1970. And after 1970 
many wanted to see his experiment 
ended as quickly as possible. But he 
was installed as President by con-
stitutional means. He was forced out 
of office in a bloody revolution which ? 
has put a military dictatorship into 
the most democratic and formerly 
most prosperous country in South 
America. . 
The results of clandestine inter* 
ference in the internal-affairs of Chile - 
would certainly seem to suggest that 
this is a poor way of doing the national 
business. 
The'IA has had an excellent 
record in gathering and weighing 
intelligence about other countries in 
the world. Its record of clandestine 
activities has been marked by less 
success, the Bay of Pigs being the 
classic example. Covert subversion is 
a highly dubious activity. If it must be 
done, surely it must be more subject 
to congressional supervision and con-
trol than in the past.

? whether the five are. really 
In ?? touch with 'American 
public opinion, and 'whether 
Congress should., not have 
tighter reins on their covert

As a consequence of the 40

large sums of Central Intelli-
?geece . Agency money were 
petered vainly into Chile to? 
'avert the election of leftist 
Salvador Allende. That money 
was followed In later-years by 
even larger sums to "destab-
ilize" the Chilean economy 
and topple The Allende re-
gime. 
With the Chilean military 
uprising in 1973 and Dr. Allen-
de's violent death, the policy 
ultimately succeeded. 
But it has produced in re-
cent days several develop-
ments certain to provoke a 
new national debate on the 
Dr., Kissinger himself.

.; 0' Destroyed what Was left 
of the belief that at least a 
few members of ? Congress, 
have knowledge of and a veto 
?over the Cloak-and-dagger as-. 
pects of the CIA. 
"The CIA is the tool of the 
President and it works today 
for Kissinger," according to 
one government source. 
The history of the U.S. gov-
ernment's Chilean adventure 
dates to 1964 when Dr. Allen-' 
de, a proclaimed Marxist, 
first sought the presidency. 
CIA funds helped his Chris-
tian Democratic opponent, 
Eduardo Frei, capture the 
presidency that year. 
But Mr. Frei could not suc-
ceed himself and the Allende 
threat was seen by Washing-
ton as greater than ever. This 
time even more money was 
funneled by CIA into anti-Al-
lende effort.? . . 
In all, according to secret 
testimony April 22 by the 
CIA director, William E. 
Colby, as revealed by Repre-
sentative Michael J. Harring: 
ton (D., Mass.) the agency 
pumped $11 million into 
anti-Allende efforts in Chile 
between 1964 and 1973. It 
was spent as follows: 
? About $500,000 was ad-
vanced in 1963 to help Chilean 
individuals and organizations 
gear up to oppose Dr. Al-
lende the next year. 
? Another $500,000 went to 
opposition party personnel 
during the 1970 campaign. 
? Following Dr. Allende's 
election, $5 Million was 
authorized to disrupt the 
Chilean economy from 1971 
Schlaudeman told a closed 
to 1973; and $1.5 million _ 
1973. Some of 'these funds 
helped finance an influential 
Chilean newspaper. 
e Finally, in August, 1973, 
just one month before Presi-
dent Allende's downfall, an-
other $1 million was author-
ized to press home the effort 
to wreck the Chilean econ-
omy, already in trouble be-
cause of Dr. Allende's own 
misguided policies. 
In each case, the effort 
and the expenditure were ape 
proved by the 40 Committee, 
or by the same committee 
operating under an alias. 
"No more mysterious 
group exists within the gov-
ernment than the 40 Commit-
' tee," David Wise, a journal-
ist who has long been a 
student of the .U.S. intellig-
ence community, said. 
"Its operations are so se-
cret that in an appearance 
before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, CIA_ 
Director Colby was even re- . 
luctant to identify the chair- - 
man." ? ? 
The Bay of Pigs invasion 
attempt, the U-2 overflights 
of the Soviet Union the ov-
erthrow of the Arbenz gov-
ernment in Guatemala?each 
of these was a CIA covert 
operation approved by the 40 
Committee,' or its predeces-
sors; 
In most cases, it appears, 
Congress was kept in the 
dark, at least until after the 
operations were completed, 
and sometimes beyond that. 
The Chilean intervention is 
an example of how this 
blindfolding of Congress 
works. 
On March 29 this year, 
Charles A. Meyers, the 
former assistant. secretary of 
state for Latin American af-
fairs, told a Senate subcom-
mittee that "the policy of the 
government .. . was that 
there would be no interven-
tion in the political affairs of 
Chile ... We financed no 
candidates, no political par-
ties ..." 
As late as June 12?two 
months after Mr. Colby's se-
er e t admission?Harry 
Schlaudeman, No. 2 person 
in the American Embassy in 
Chile from 1969 to 1973, den-
ied that any such U.S. effort 
was made. 
"There was no funding, of, 
that I am quite sure," Mr. 
more was spent to influence hearing of the House Foreign 
ezae.
? in.., :0  
" Mr. Colby emphasizes 
when questioned that . the 
agency makes full secret re-
ports to the "appropriate" 
congressional committees, 
the so-called CIA "over-. 
sight" subcommittees of the 
House and Senate. 
-But what they are told, 
according to a? former top; 
official of the CIA,. depends 
on what questions they ask 
?and frequently they do not 
ask the right questions. 
"The CIA deals with Con-
gress in the way that Con-
gress requests it to," the 
? official, who requested anon-
ymity, said "Often they don't 
, know enough to ask the right 
? guestions. But it's their 
fault." 
Among the subjects- that 
have esaped close congres-
:sional questioning has been 
the operations of the 40 Corn-
; mittee. ? 
? Despite its anonymity, the 
committee appears to have 
existed since before 1954, 
I-under several different 
names.. 
. The names have been deli-
' brately designed to provide 
no clue as to its function. Its 
, members communicate 
mostly by word of ',mouth, 
with little paperwork 'and a 
staff of one man, believed to 
be a CIA employee. 
"You can look all you want 
but you won't find any docu-. 
; ment with the title '40 Com-
mittee' on it," a former in-
? 
telligence officer said. "It's 
like,' officially. 'at least, it 
didn't exist." ? 4

refer to a National Security 
Council directive No. 40. , 
Dr. Kissinger, as national 
security adviser, took charge' 
of the 40 Committee under 
President Nixon and retains 
the chairmanship today. 
The other members are 
Gen. George S. Brown,

chiefs of staff; William P.

tary of defense; Joseph J.

. Mr. Colby's membership, 
according to critics, is the 
classic story of the "fox in 
the chicken coop"?the CIA 
director, in effect sitting in 
judgment on plans and pro-
posals of .his own agency. 
? At times, other officials 
have sat in; John N. Mitch-
ell, as Mr. Nixon's attorney 
general, was a 40 Committee 
member, and there is some 
dispute over whether the late 
Robert F. Kennedy, in his.. 
turn as attorney general, 
also was a member. 
It is believed that Mr. Nix-
on's controversial assistants, 
H. R. Haldeman and John D. 
Ehrlichman, also attended 
meetings, but evidently not 
as members. 
? Each 40 Committee, ac-
cording to past and present 
intelligence officers, has 
tended to become an exten-
v sion of the chairman chiefly 
.because he alone has access 
directly to the President. 
V Dr. Kissinger has come to 
.dominate the 40 Committee 
and to an extent some intel-
ligence specialists here be-
lieve is dangerous. 
In the past, for -example, 
the 40 Committee met 
weekly, but as Dr. Kissin-
ger's own responsibilities 
have expanded, he has con-
vened the committee less 
frequently,, intelligence spe-
cialists here say. 
Much of the time, accord-
ing' to several sources, Dr. 
Kissinger merely confers 
with the other members by 
telephone, dealing with them 
individually rather than as a 
group, and passing on to the 
President the consensus that 
he alone has had a, real?and 
in fashioning. ' 
The result, according to 
specialists who have served 
in both the CIA and State 
Department, has been to 
concentrate decision-making 
in fewer hands, mostly Dr. 
Kissinger's hands. 
'A lot of the consultation 
and argument that went on 
is missing now," one official 
said. 
The controversy over Dr. 
Kissinger's role extends ? to 
the Chilean adventure and 
who really initiated it. 
The CIA clearly has taken 
most of the heat to date, but 
at least one official highly 
placed in the State Depart-
ment from 1970 to 1973, the 
years of the most ambitious 
WASHINGTON STAR 
17 September 1974 
? 
William F. neklier. 
Two questions have been 
'raised on the CIA-in-Chile 
front. The first is whether I 
State Department officials de-' 
ceived congressional,commit-
tees by reporting that the 
United States government had 
'taken no action to frustrate 
the inauguratibn or success of 
Salvador Allende as president 
of Chile.-The second is wheth-
er the United States govern-
ment should have done so. , 
Needless to say the second ' 
question, which is more impor-
tant than the first, is receiving 
practically no attention. The 
first absorbs the front page. 
FRANKLY, I DO NOT know 
what is the correct prescrip-
tion for State Department offi-
cials appearing before con-
gressional committees that 
ask deeply sensitive questions. 
The routine answer is to 
demur, on the grounds of 
executive privilege. But that 
privilege, as we all know, is in 
high disrepute -these days, so 
that-congressional interroga-
tors tend to press on, where 
yesterday, they'd have let 
things lie. 
How, for instance, would 
anti-Allende effort, believes 
the "CIA may be getting a 
bum rap." 
The idea for intervention, 
he- said, appears to have 
come from' the White House 
?"from Nixon to Kissinger." 
It was then farmed out to 
the CIA to develop a plan 
and provide funds and routed 
routinely back to the 40 Com-
mittee, where Dr. Kissinger, 
as chairman, approved what 
may have been his own plan, 
this source said. 
The agenda of the 40 Com-
mittee includes some of the 
most delicate foreign policy 
decisions of the government. 
Besides the CIA's covert pro-
jects, it also reviews and 
approves monthly a joint re-
connaissance schedule that 
involves, among other things, 
the use of spy satellites ar-
ound the world. 
Outside the intelligence 
community there is criticism 
of the secrecy that shrouds 
the CIA and hands over its 
operation to a non-elected 
elite such as ,the 40 Commit-
tee. 
But within the intelligence 
community here?people 
sympathetic to the need for 
e CIA 
you, if you served 'as an 
ambassador, say, to Hitler's 
Germany, and you were collu-
sively intriguing with the 
resistance moverpent, answer 
such a ? question as: "Mr. 
Ambassador, is the State De-
partment engaged in any con-
tacts whatever with the oppo-
sition to the official 
government of the Third 
Reich?" You could "No" 
?.which would be a lie. You 
could .say: "Yes",? which 
would be the truth, and would 
blow the operation. Or you 
could say: "I can't discuss 
that." 
In which case the press ---
yes, the press, because as we 
have just seen with the sup-
posedly secret testimony of 
CIA chief William Colby be-
fore a congressional commit-
tet, in due course we all end 
up reading what he said ? is 
invited to draw inferences, 
namely that in fact you are in 
touch with the resistance. 
To this dilemma there is no 
easy solution. 
BUT RETURNING now to 
Chile. It is alleged that the 
CIA was authorized by the 
clandestine policy alterna-
tives in a divided world?the 
concern is that there is not 
enough control of the CIA by 
institutions such as the 40 
Committee. 
For example, Victor Mar-
chetti and John D. Marks, 
,former U.S. intelligence offi-
cers and authors of "The 
CIA and the Cult of Intellig-
ence," maintain thet covert 
operations account for only 
$440 million of ,CIA's esti-
mated budget of more than 
$750 million a year. The ac-
tual figures are a closely 
held secret. 
By far the larger, more 
important operation?world-
wide espionage?is subject to 
no review by the 40 Conunit-
tee. 
This is true even if the 
espionage involves an opera-
tion as sensitive as hiring a 
key official of a foreign vov-
ernment?as has been done 
in Latin America, at the risk 
of a serious diplomatic inci-
dent. 
Even covert operation ap-
proved by the 40 Committee 
have some history of gener-
ating capers never envi,-
sioned by the 40 Committee. 
The Soviet sugar case is an 
example. 
d Allende 
Nixon administration to spend ? 
up to $8 million over a three-
year period to prevent if possi-' 
,ble, and if not possible then to 
frustrate, the government of 
Salvador Allende. This is ac-
cepted prima facie as appall-
ing. 
One wonders: what in the 
world is the Central Intelli-
gence Agency supposed-to do? - 
We have been formally com-
mitted since the days of Presi-
dent Monroe to the doctrine' 
that no foreign country would 
be permitted to colonize a 
country in the Western Hemi-
sphere. Granted, we backed 
away from that doctrine pari 
passu with our retreat from 
the Bay of Pigs. But the alto-
gether official rhetoric of the 
United States in?its dealings 
with Latin America has been 
to incline towards freedom 
and sovereignty. 
The assertion that Allende 
was "democratically" elected, 
and that therefore we had no 
business opposing him, begs 
questions procedural and sub-
stantive. 
For one thing, Allende's per-
centage of the vote was less 
than Sen. Goldwater's in 1964. 
But more important. Allende 
24 
was the outspoken friend of 
socialist tyranny, and the no-
tion that we should deny to his 
opponents such help as we 
gave them suggests that the 
United States should be totally 
indifferent to the growth with-
in Latin America of a govern-
ment dominated by a man 
whose idol was Fidel Castro. . 
? 
IT MAY BE that interfer-
ence of any.kipd in the affairs/ 
,of another country s'ilduld be 
discouraged. But is it reallir a' 
. purely Chilean "affair" if it is 
contemplated that hundreds of 
millions of dollars of American 
investments are to be confis-
cated?,. Is it purely a Chilean 
affairif the country becomes a 
base for revolutionary activi-
ties against its neighbors?. . 
Are we in fact prepared to 
retreat so completely from 
the inaugural ideal of John F. 
Kennedy ("We shall pay any 
price, bear any burden, meet 
any hardship, support any 
friend, oppose any foe, in 
order to assure the survival 
and the success of liberty 
. . .") as to stop any clandes-
tine effort to help our friends 
in other countries to help 
themselves?

LONDON SUNDAY TIMES 
15 Sep 1974 
_ . 
By Henry Brandon 
hey. grilled the ?.IA 
Washington 
THE Director Of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, William 
Celby, proved yesterday that in ! 
his days as an undercover agent 
he had learnt how to survive 
alone in hostile territory. He 
spoke at a conference on the CIA 
and covert activities, hosted on 
Capitol Hill by Senators Edward 
Brooke (Republican, Massachu-
setts) and Phillip Hart (Demo-
crat, Michigan): it was as if 
General' Sir Walter Walker had 
come to address a TUC meeting. 
Mr Colby faced a hostile panel 
of well-known critics of the CIA, 
Including seven former members 
of the agency like Daniel 
Ellsberg, and also an obviously 
hostile, audience that consisted 
mostly of 300 yoring "new Left" 
CIA-haters. Ile not only defended 
the CIA's role, after two days 
of speeches by critics, but also 
sought to promote a legislative 
proposal for. the equivalent of an ; 
official secrets act to protect; 
"good secrets." 
Questions about the CIA's 
activities in the overthrow of the! 
Allende regime in Chile, which 
surfaced as the result of a con-
gressional "leak," 'Mr Colby 
fended off by saying that he 
would answer them only in execu-
've session of the appropriate 
?-zressional committees. How. 
'he claimed that the CIA's 
aments in covert action are 
ken only as directed by 
-onal Security Council and 
Colby: survival lesson 
that "they are frankly and. regu-
larly reported to the appropriate 
committees, and they require only 
a small proportion of our effort 
and time." 
When Mr Colby said the CIA 
had no connection with the mili-
tary coup that overthrew Allende, 
but that agency "looked forward 
to a change in the government 
there by democratic means," the 
generally good-natured audience 
broke into laughter. He added 
that he had reread his secret 
testimony of last April which 
leaked out here earlier in the 
' week, and found that he had not 
, used the phrase "destabilise-the 
Allende government' which he 
was quoted as having used in 
describing the application of 
clandestine funds that had been 
authorised by the Forty Com-
mittee " of the Natfonal Security 
Council. 
;. . 
When asked how miz,ch specific 
NEW YORK POST 
10 Sept. 1974 
z 
information Congress is given 
about covert actions, Mr Colby 
said it was " made aware at 
appropriate times of various 
major actions," and when asked 
whether the American ambas-
sadors in Chile were kept 
informed of covert activities, 
there, he replied that such in-
formation is primarly given to 
) the Under Secretary of State and 
that ambassadors are informed 
on a "need-to-know basis." ? 
He refused to say whether those 
ambassadors to Chile who had 
testified before Congress that the 
US to their knowledge, main-
tained a -" hands-of" policy had 
lied. He , insisted, however, that 
all major efforts and money spent 
in Chile were known, to several 
committees of Congress and that 
therefore the CIA, in the end, re-
mains accountable to the voters. 
Asked whether there would 
now be a conflict of interest 
between Vice-President Nelson 
Rockefeller and his enterprises 
in Latin America?which the 
questioner claimed had been used 
as cover for intelligence opera-
tions?Mr. Colby, who always 
maintained a truly stiff upper 
lip however insulting or indis-
creet the question, replied that 
this was. " No useful subject for 
discussion." 
To a question about whether 
the CIA intended to intervene 
to prevent Greece from leaving 
NATO Mr Colby replied that 
I Greece's action had no immediate 
! adverse effect on the security of 
the US and furthermore that

ist in covert CIA operations, explained 
that they had been approved by an in-

he had to endure some strong 
language?such as being called

That, is hard to understand, 'even 
though the Secretary has been' treated

to be appropriate subjects for U. S.-

The issue is not whether the Allende 
regime was beyond reproach; it is, 
among other things, whether we have 
a double standard under which freely-

covert sabotage while despotisms are 
considered beyond even moral remon-

NEW YORK TIMES 
15 September 1974 
KISSINGER CALLED 
CHILE STRATEGIST 
By SEYMOUR M. HERSH 
Special to The New York Times, 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14?
Secretary of State Kissinger 
personally. 'directed a tar-reach-
ing Nixon \Administration pro-
gram designed to curtail ecot 
'nomic aid and .credits to Chile 
after:the election of .Pretideht 
Salvador Allende 'Cesspits ,in 
1970, well-informed , Govern-
ment sources said today. , 
These sources said that after 
the election of Dr. Allende, Mr. 
!Kissinger, who was then serv-
ing as 'President Nixon's ad-
viser on national security, took 
charge of a series of weekly-
interagency 'meetings at which 
Administration officials worked 
out a policy of economic sane-
tins?or "retaliation," as one 
source put it?against Chile. 
Covert C.I.A. Activities 
, The Nixon, Administration re-
peatedly denied that there was 
any overt program of economic 
,sanctions against Chile, public-
ly stating that the Chilean Gov-
ernment's inability to gct loans 
and 'credits after Dr. Allende'S 
election was a reflection 'of its 
poor credit risk: 
, There was no immediate:, 
comment from Mr. Kissinger.: 
The Secretary of State -has 
been under increasing criticism 
from Congress since it was 
revealed last ,week that the 
United States' had authorized 
more than $8-million for clan-
destine activities by the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency against 
the Allende Government, from 
1970 to 1973. The 'funds . were 
approved bY,the 40 Committee, 
-
a high-level panel headed by 
Mr. Kissinger that is in charge 
of overseeing the C.I.A.'s'cov-
ert activities*. 
Although he is Secretary of 
State, Mr. Kissinger remains 
as President Ford's ? national 
security adviser and thus still 
heads the 40 Commitee. 
The sources emphasized that 
Mr. Kissinger's economic ac-
tivities against the Allende 
Government were distinct from 
his inVolvement in clandestine 
C.I.A. operations, although 
both programs were controlled 
by him with great secrecy. 
Mr. Kissing,er's decision to 
become personally involved in 
the economic reprisals against 
the Chilean Government; an-
.gered a number of high-level 
State Department officials, 
who considered his action to 
be a sign of mistrust toward 
the department, the sources 
said. 
"The whole purpose of the 
? 
Colby is described 'as testifying that, after 'Al-
lende took office, the 'CIA Was authorized to spend 
$5'milliim for "destabilizatiOn:efforts7and support, 
for anti-Allende forces. . "! .; 
Allende's Communist-SOcialist government com-
mitted so many blunders on its own that the mili-
tary coup in' September, 1973, was probably inevi-. 
table, even if the CIA's clandestine anti-Allende. 
campaign had never taken place. ? 
It seems 'self-evident, however, that the United " 
States has no right to interfere in the 'politics of a 
democratic country, .even if there is reason to fear 
that the election of, a given leader will be injurious, 
to U.S., interests. 
Even more worrisome is the possibility that.re-
sponsible officials deliberately misled Congress in 
earlier public hearings on the matter. 
Sen. Frank Church (D-Ida.), chairman of a Senate 
subcommittee that held hearings on possible CIA. 
invOlvement in Chile, has properly announced that 
if a review of .the testimony indicates that.-Con- ? 
gress..was lied to. he will refer the matter to the 
Justice Department for possible perjury prosecu-
tions. 
As the Idaho senator said, the habit of deceiving 
Congress on sensitive foreign policy issues cropped' 
up during the Vietnam war. And if it's still going 
on, "It's a habit the Congress is going ,to have to 
break." 
meetings hi the first couple 
of months after the election 
was to insure that the various 
aid agencies and lending agen-
cies were rejiggered to make 
sure that [Allende] wasn't to 
get a penny," said one well-
informed source. 
Over the next two years, the 
Chilean Government was de-
nied dozens of loans by the 
World Bank, a multinational 
loan agency over whose activ-
ity the United States has vir-
tual veto power, and by the 
Export-Import Bank, a United 
States Government agency. In 
addition, Chile's short-term line 
of credit with private banks 
fell from $220-million in 1971 
to less than S40-million a year 
.later. 
In a speech on Dec. 4, 1972, 
to the United Nations, Dr. Al-
lende complained of "large-
scale external pressure to cut 
us off from the world, to 
strangle our economy and par-
alyze our trade in our principal 
export, copper, and to deprive 
us of access to sources of in-
ternational ? financing." The 
Allende Government was over-
thrown in a bloody coup d'etat 
10 months later in which the 
Chilean leader died. 
The most explicit Adminis-
tration denial of such economic 
pressure came *during hearings 
last year on Chile before a Sen-
ate Foreign Relations subcom-
mittee, in which John M. Hen-
nessy, then an Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury for 
International Affairs, had the 
'following exchange with Sen-
ator Frank Church, Democrat 
of Idaho, the subcommittee 
chairman: 
Senator Church: "So the po-
sition of our Government on 
the state of the economy in 
Chile was such that Chile was 
not credit-worthy, and that no 
further loans should be made 
owing to,the general condition 
of the economy. Is that . cor-
xect?" 
ifermesy: "That is correct?' 
'? A number of sources charac-
terized the Nixon 'Administra-
' tion's curtailment of credit and 
? aid to Chile as a." political deci-
,aion that was initiated shortly 
after Dr. Allende fdrntally took 
office in November, 1970. 
"There was a range of alter-
natives being considered,". one 
? source reealled. "The options 
ranged from a marine-type. in-
vastion to massive infusions of 
money. When Allende became 
President, everybody breathed 
a sigh of relief because we 
hadn't done anything." 
'Once he was President, then 
there was set in motion a care-
fully planned program led by 
Kissinger," the source added. 
"He personally chaired?for 
maybe as long as 10 or 12 
weeks?a working staff group 
dealing with economic sanc-
tions. It was our understanding 
that the President was extreme-
ly concerned about Allende and 
Henry was showing him that he 
was on top of it."

sources include former Nixon

formation was supplied by Con-

had access to all of the sworn

The sources said that the

?Pentagon and the Treasury De-
partment as well as Mr. Kissin-

issued.

Wider Abuses than Chile

Secretary of State for Inter-
American Affairs. But, the 
sources said, the Assistant Sec-
retary at that time, Charles A. 
MeYer, had fallen into disfavor 
with ?the White House because 
of his resistance at meetings of 
the 40 Committee to some o 
the clandestine C.I.A. activities 
authorized against the Allende 
Government: 
"It was a big blow to the 
State Department," another 
source said. "It was a Kissin, 
ger group. 
"It stuck in my mind because 
Kissinger, in affect, became a 
Chilean desk officer," the, 
source added. "He made sure 
that policy. was made in the 
way he and the President 
wanted. it." 
The fuss over the role of the 
?Central Intelligence Agency 
in Chile is not really about 
that agency or that country. 
It emerges chiefly from a 
deep general suspieion of the 
instruments of national secur-
ity. If he truly wants to heal 
the country, President Ford 
will have to go out of his way 
to assuage this suspicion. 
Two major questions ought 
to be asked at all times about 
the CIA. The first engages 
the role of the agency in mak-
ing and unmaking foreign 
governments by the black arts 
of sabotage and subversion. 
That issue seems to be cen-
tral to the present stir? over 
Chile. The case grew out of a 
letter written by Representa-
tive Michael J. Harrington 
(D., Mass.) and leaked to the 
press. The letter purported to 
summarize testimony to a 
House subcommittee by Wil-
liam E. Colby, director of the 
t7A. 
According to the letter, Mr. 
Colby testified that the agen-
cy spent $8 million between 
1970 and 1973 to help the op-
position to the Popular Front 
government of President Sal-
vador Allende. ?The letter 
said the funds were used in 
order to achieve the "de-
-stabilization" of the regime. 
The implication was that the 
? CIA arranged the coun that 
overthrew Dr. Allende last 
year. 
In fact the word "destabili-
zation" was not used by Mr. 
Colby in his testimony. It is 
hardly thinkable that so small 
a sum?for $8 million is vir-
tually nothing in the modern 
intelligence game?could have 
caused the fall of the Chilean 
government. 
President Ford said at his the mgration of the CIA and tral Intelligence; John M. Hen-
news conference what AfftrotimitYtarrffialtaaste alk01.108/005:sCIA-RDKIT00432 
in-ormed sources also say? security policy. partment official, two former 
that the money was used only 
to sustain democratic news-
papers and political leaders. 
It is as clear as it can ever NEW YORK TIMES 
be in this sort of murky 19 September 1974 
business that the CIA did not 
play a significant role in the FORD TO BRIEF FIVE 
Chilean coup. 
The second big question 
turns on the: responsiveness 
of the CIA to the elected lead- 0 \I C.I.A. ACTIVITIES 
ership in the White House 
and Congress. Everybody 
agrees that in Chile the CIA 
was obedient to the wishes 
of the Nixon administration. 
What is in doubt is the 
question of keeping Congress 
informed. Several high offi-
cials?including the Secretary 
of State, Henry A. Kissinger, 
and former CIA director, 
Richard Helms ? denied in 
testimony be!ore various ele-
ments of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee that the 
United States had fomented 
the Chilean. coup. 
Technically, those state-
ments appear to have been 
accurate. Moreover, it is tra-
ditional that black-bag opera-
tions of the agency are not 
revealed to the regular legis-
lative committees of Con-
gress but to a special watch-
dog committee. 
Even if they did not tell 
the strict truth about such 
operations to the Foreign 
Relations Committee, in other 
words, Dr. Kissinger and Mr. 
Helms and the others were 
operating within established 
guidelines. 
However, if the particulars 
of the Chilean case do not 
justify the fuss, the general 
atmosphere of the oast few 
years does. Throughout the 
Vietnam war. Congress and 
much of the country were 
systematically deceived- about 
Over and over again in the 
Watergate case, President 
Nixon and those around him 
invoked the term "national 
security" as the justification 
for covering up common 
crimes. 
Many intelligent and well-
meaning people have come to 
believe that the whole appa-
ratus of national security is 
bogus?a cover for something 
illegitimate and improper. 
That is why the apparent im-
proprieties of the CIA in Chile 
have excited such attention. 
? If President Ford is to end 
what he has called the long 
national nightmare, he will 
have to sof.en tnese feelings. 
Unfortunately, he seems not 
to understand the depths of 
the doubts about national 
security. Thus when ques-
tioned about Chile at his news 
conference Monday night, he 
gave a national security re-
sponse straight out of the 
1950's: "Our government, like 
other governments, does take 
certain actions in the intelli-

Secretary of State Kissinger an-
nounced today that he and

ate leaders tomorrow on the 
scope of the Central Intelligence 
Agency's covert operations. 
, "We will put it before them

it returned here from New

dressed the United Nations. 
Administration officials said 
that the President had decided 
to brief the Congressional lead-
ers after his strong defense of 
all C.I.A. covert activities in

night. The President publicly 
confirmed then that the agency 
had been involved in clandestine 
efforts in Chile, but he de-
picted them as having been 
aimed only at aiding newspaper 
and politicians opposing Presi-
dent Salvador Allende Gossens, 
who, Mr. Ford said, was at-
tempting to suppress criticism.

realize that the opposition to 
Vietnam rested on deep gen-
eral doubts about national 
security actions?not on the 
relatively trivial issue of the 
draft dodgers. ? 
The point of all this is that 
the country is seriously and 
deeply divided on fundament-
al issues of national security. 
President Ford is going to 
have to take account of those 
divisions. He will have to try

his two predecessors did,

WASHINGTON POST 
.2.9 September 1974 
:Rowland Evans 'and Robert Novak 
issinger or Schlesin 
a. 
? 
In affirming on Tuesday that Henry 
':"Kissinger would still wear two hats as 
'both Secretary of State and director of 
the National Security Council (NSC), 
:President Ford was postponing the ul-
timate choice between Kissinger and 
Secretary of Defense James Schle-
:,singer. 
-Although Mr. Ford denied published 
?reports that his transition team recom-
mended that Mr. Kissinger 'be stripped 
,of his NSC hat, the President did not 
.divulge 'confidential recommendations 
from intimate advisers. They had been 
urging the appointment el a new NSC 
.director, ending Kissinger 'e unprece-
dented control over global policy and 
perhaps even reducing him to roughly 
,the same level as Schlesinger. Accord-
ingly, these same adviser's believed 
.(perhaps hoped) that cutting Kissinger 
down to human size would result in his 
jibrupt resignation. 
This showdown has been postponed, 
but there seems little chance that Kis-
singer and Schlesinger can coexist In 
.the Ford administration into next sum-
mer. Furthermore, 'despite Tuesday's 
?zaisurance from the President, Ford in-
lidert believe it is SchleSibger rather 
than Kissinger who may ultimately 
? survive. ? - 
Even if they agreed on policy, con-
lrontation between Kissinger and 
$chlesinger would have been inevita-
ble. Never before have two such bril-
liant intellectuals simultaneously held 
the Cabinet portfolios for state and de-
iense. "Here are two egomaniacs," con-
tends one high official who knows 
them both well. Two smart egomani 
rete, which *makes it worse.', t 
7 But the fact is that they most cer-
tainly do not agree. Schlesinger be-
? lieves Kissinger's detente diplomacy 
concedes too much to Moscow on all 
fronts?SALT, mutual force reduc-
tions, 'the 'European Security Treaty. 
Contending that detente is not so frag-
ile a flower, he would take a much 
. harder' bargaining line. ' 
It was therefore predictable that 
Schlesinger would grow restive with 
total domination of national security 
policy by Kissinger, wearing both his 
NSC and State Department hats. But 
President Nixon, obsessed by Water-
gate, never even approached the prob-
lem. Kissinger reigned supreme.

firm that supremacy, As Vice presi-
newed his call today for more 
effective control over the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency after a 
series of hearings that ended to-
da" before his inter-American 
affairs subcommittee of the 
House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee. Mr. Fascell said he was 
"deeply distressed" that he and 
his colleagues had not been 
fully informed of the agency's 
activities in testimony given 
earlier this year by William E. 
-Colby. the Director of Central 
Intelligence. 
dent, -Mr. Ford sought a personal rela-
-tionship with Kissinger while privately 
expressing doubts that the pipe-smok-
ing, donnish Schlesinger could sell de-
fense budgets on Capitol Hill. Gen. Al-
exairder Haig, Kissinger's old deputy 
temporarily kept on as chief of staff 
by President Ford, felt that diplomatic 
strategy in negotiating with Moscow 
was no business of the Secretary of. 
Defense.. . 
The impression of Schlesinger's im-
pending doom was confirmed ?by Mr. 
Ford's first weeks in office. Intimates 
reported him displeased by Schlesing-
er's professorial style of exposition. 
White House staff papers gave the 
President the totally erroneous impres-
sion that the Pentagon -brass distrusted 
Schlesinger because he had never 
wbrn the uniform. The President Was 
not happy about Schlesinger's publicly 
revealing his precautions against a mil-
itary takeover during the Nixon-Ford 
transition. 
But within the ,past week or so, the 
climate has changed. Key Ford aides 
now defend Schlesinger and urge his 
retention. His position is certainly not 
hurt at the White House by Halg's im-
minent departure. Moreover, Schle-
'singer's friends have this long-range 
view: Mr. Eord is essentially a congres-
sional barghiner without Nixon's Wil-
sonian ?world vision; as such, he in 
time will be attracted by Schlesinger's 
insistence on tit-for-tat bargains with

THE CBA AHD THE CULT OF 
INTELLIGENCE 
By Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks. 
Alfred A. Knopf; London: JOnathan 
Cape. 419 pages. ?3.95. 
The recent revelations that the CIA 
spent large sums of money between 
1970 and 1973 in efforts to overthrow 
the Allende government in Chile will 
not have come as a surprise to those 
few people who followed the events 
there with care and patience. In addi-
tion to these specialists, there is a huge 
number of casual readers who might 
have been surprised if. they had not 
read, or heard about, this recent popular 
account of some of the cIA's activities, 
written by a veteran of 14 years' service 
in the agency in association with a 
former member of the American foreign 
service. 
Published in July in the United States 
this book has already had consider-
able influence. It has provoked a major 
court decision on the right of American 
government agencies to withhold 
information, and it has been largely 
responsible for. the Administration's 
asking for new legislation to tighten up 
and clarify laws covering not only the 
security of information but also means 
of enforcing them in cases where 
individuals such as Daniel Ellsberg and 
?it must be added?Messrs Marks 
the Kremlin. " 
Finally, Kissinger's perceived indis-
pensability has been sharply eroded by 
the Cyprus crisis and the Chilean reve-
lations. Newsmen last Tuesday morn-
ing were stunned when told by Rep. 
Albert Quie of Minnesota, a close con-
gressional ally of Mr. Ford's, that Kis-
singer should go. But Quie's view is in-
creasingly prevalent in congressional 
\ cloakrooms.- Accusations that he mas-
terminded Central Intelligence Agency 
Intervention in Chile has energized bit-
ter, simultaneous campaigns against 
him from both left and right. 
Preoccupied by the Nixon pardon 
and Vietnam amnesty, Mr. Ford has 
not addressed the important disagree-
ments over detente policy between 
Kissinger and Schlesinger. Nor does 
he have to decide between them imme-
diately. 
But following the Chilean revela-
tions, Ford insiders began urging that 
Kissinger's authority be diluted by the 
appointment of a new NSC director. 
The threat to Kissinger's supremacy 
posed by this recommendation was un-
settling, obviously to President Ford 
and less obviously even to some offi-
cials who disagree with Kissinger on 
policy. Contending that there is no al-
ternative to Kissinger as possible Mid-
eastern peacekeeper in the coming 
months, they want the status quo re-
tained. 
Even some of these officials, how-
ever, believe the long-term coexistence 
of Kissinger and Schlesinger is impos-
sible. Within no more than six months, 
they believe, the President must 
choose between them. While it would 
not have been credible just a month 
ago, ,it is by no means certain today 
that the choice will be Henry Kis-
singer. 
1974. Field Enterprises. Us. 
and Marchetti themselves ' see fit to 
make public information that they have 
agreed to keep secret. 
But the book was not written so much 
about the system of classifying informa-
tion as about an issue that is funda-
mental to the intelligence establishment 
of the United .States: that the CIA,. 
originally established 'to co-ordinate the 
intelligence ' activities of the. various 
branches Of govefnment?the State 
Department, military services, FBI, 
National Sectirity. Agency (NSA) and 
the rest?his been forced ont- of this 
role, and has concentrated on its 
mission of clandestine operations, and 
that such operations- have included 
unethical meddling in the affairs of 
foreign governments. 
This charge is true. The so-called 
intelligence community is huge and com-
partmented and not well managed. 
In fact, according to the authors, it is 
hardly managed at all. They also make 
the fair point that the NSA's com-
munications interceptors and code-
breakers and the mammoth Defense 
Intelligence Agency have most of the 
money and power and- that neither 
wishes to be co-ordinated by the CIA, 
whose political machinations abroad 
are well known and well documented. 
Having made this point early on, the 
authors suggest in the last chapter 
that the cure can be found in separating 
the co-ordinating functions of the CIA

from operations. This makes good senie. 
Between, however, the initial exposi-
tion of the problem and the proposed 
cure, the book is a rambling and dis-
jointed account of some of the CIA's 
clandestine adventures and a lot of 
boring material about internal organisa-
tion, policies and procedures. It is not 
a history of the CIA. The authors would 
be the first to confirm this, as they con-
sistently make the point that the CIA 
and the whole American intelligence 
community are so compartmented that 
no one knows what is going on, and 
that, in effect, a lot of time is spent 
rediscovering the wheel. Although 
the individual accounts of clandestine 
operations are sometimes interesting, 
there is not much here which is really 
new: the Bay of Pigs (the war which 
was the undoing of Allen Dulles, 
arguably the best director the CIA ever 
had), Air America and the secret war 
in Laos, Che Guevara in Bolivia and the 
attempt to overthrow Sukarno are all 
rehashed at length. 
The most intriguing parts?and the 
main feature of the book?are the 
deletions ordered by a federal court 
judge (identified by the word "delete" 
-and a gap in the page the size of the 
deleted material) and the words that 
the CIA asked to have deleted but 
which the authors refused to delete 
and which are ndw printed in bold-face 
type. Although it initially gives the 
reader a sense of being in on something 
novel to read these bold-type sentences, 
not much is given away here, either. In 
fact, one is left with a sense of incred-
ulity that there could have been any 
dispute at all over many of them. Surely, 
one hopes, there is more substance to 
the passages that the judge deleted. Or 
could the whole thing be a gigantic CIA 
hoax designed to get Congress to 
tighten up the security laws? Unlikely as 
this may seem, if one believes even a 
fraction of the escapades and hare-
brained ideas the book attributes to the 
CIA's clandestine branch, such an 
operation is not entirely incredible. 
This is not the best book written about 
the CIA; but, because of its legal and 
legislative ramifications, it could turn 
out to be the most important one. ?

The CIA: Chile and elsewhere 
By Charles W. Yost 
New York 
Is it not high time that the United 
States Government, Congress, and 
people drew some operative con-
clusions from the repeated and ern-
- be -...rassing public predicamente in 
Wach the CIA has involved them over 
the past 15 years? ? 
The most recent debate on the 
subject arises from the avowal by the 
director of the agency that it did 
expend considerable sums in Chile to 
prevent Allende's accession to power 
and, after, he had nevertheless ac-
ceded, to weaken or undermine him. 
I have not had an opportunity to 
examine the record sufficiently to 
judge whether, as claimed, other 
witnesses misled congressional com-
mittees on this point, though there 
certainly is prima facie evidence that 
they were not wholly candid. I should 
myself, however, support the U.S. 
Government's contention that, what-
ever the CIA may or may not have 
-done in Chile, it did not "overthrow" 
Allende. 
Allende was overthrown by Chil-
eans. He never at any time had the 
support of the majority of the people. 
EL: was overthrown because he and 
his more radical adherents alienated, 
frightened, and ultimately radi-
calized in the opposite sense the 
uneonverted majority, particularly 
its Most powerful element, the mill-
tary. 
It is necessary to make this point in 
order to clarify the broad issue ? 
whether admitted CIA activities in 
Chile, even if they played no substan-
tial part in the overthrow of Allende, 
were in the national interest of the 
U.S. I would argue that they were not. 
American and other Western 
spokesmen have for the past half 
century been pointing out that, while 
the Marxist revolutions in the Soviet 
Union and elsewhere were no doubt 
directed to noble ends, the atrocious 
means so often employed grossly 
distorted and even vitiated those 
ends. Yet since the onset of the cold 
wal the U.S. has takena leaf out of the 
Communist book .and, too often re-
. ? sorted to means so shabby 'we dare 
not avow them. In the long run this 
does not pay. 
Ignoble means debase and demoral-
ize the actors, corrupt and brutalize 
those acted upon and, in so doing, 
transform and disintegrate the end 
itself. This is as true for democrats as 
for Communists. 
The consequence of a quarter cen-
, tury of "dirty tricks" by the CIA, that 
? is, the U.S. Government, has been to 
make .the agency throughout the 
world a symbol for unscrupulous 
Intervention in other people's internal 
affairs and hence often to undermine, 
rather than to serve, the objectives of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
We see how it is almost universally 
believed in Greece that the CIA 
inspired the July 15 oaup in Cyprus 
which set in train the -subsequent 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-3 
disasters. I believe this is a mistaken 
judgment, because , upsetting the 
status quo was so obviously counter to 
U.S. interest. But? the fact it is 
plausible to suppose that the CIA 
might have inspired the coup if it had 
been in the U.S. interest lends color to 
the accusation. 
A New York Times story last week 
quotes a telegram from the U.S. ? 
Ambassador inDelhi to the effect that 
the recent revelations about CIA 
activities in Chile have confirmed the 
worst suspicions of the Indians about 
that agency and caused Indira Gandhi 
to wonder whether the Indian Govern- ? 
ment may not be the next target for" 
elimination. This is hardly the image 
of its foreign policy and practice the 
U.S. Government should wish to see 
widely held around the world. ? ? 
Supporters of "CIA activities of this 
kind think of themselves as "hard-
nosed" realists. The Bay of Pigs is 
one instructive example and Gordon' 
Liddy's little operation at Watergate 
is another. ? 
The fact is the "dirty tricks" con-
. 
ducted by agents of the U.S. Govern-
ment very rarely serve the national 
interest of the United States, even if 
one interprets these interests in 
strictly "cold-war" terms. Ex-
perience has shown that they cannot 
be adequately "controlled" within the 
executive branch, because it is so 
often the controllers, as in the case of 
the Bay of Pigs and perhaps of Chile, 
whose perceptions and judgments are . 
at fault. 
Vietnam has tragically demonstra-
ted the limitation on the "capacity of 
the U.S. to determine the structure of 
an alien society even by a massive 
injection* of armed force. How much 
less likely that America could hope to 
do so by clandestine operations. The 
U.S. can, no doubt, occasionally con-
tribute to the rise or fall of a particu-
lar government orpolitician, but over 
the longer 'run.' indigenous forces, 
which it canriot 'control, will deter-
mine whether this superficial change 
has any lasting effect. 
In referring at a public ?rneeting in 
Washington last week to proposals 
'that CIA abandon its covert action 
programs, director William Colby 
said: "In light of current American 
policy, it would not have a major 
impact on our current activities or the 
current security of the United 
States." 
? While the triple use of the word 
"current" is ominous, this statement 
is mildly reassuring. It is to be hoped 
that the President and Secretary of 
State will be persuaded that, in the, 
broader perspective, these "dirty 
tricks" do more harm than good to the 
national security and should be 
phased out. 
The author of this article writes 
from a background of 40 years as 
a United States diplomat.

press lately. Here a longti e capital 
newsman and seasoned observer of! Els 
Intelligence and 'dirty tricks agency 
comments on how the spy agency c uld

enjamin Welles 
Special to The Christian Science Monitor 
Washington 
The spies may not all be in from the cold ? but 
the canaries are' starting to sing. 
The trickle of critical "exposes" about the 
Central Intelligence Agency by ex-employees or? 
associates is becoming a flood. Each book seems to 
generate another, as America's spies go public for 
the good of their souls, their pocketbooks, or both. ? 
In recent years ? apart from Wise and Ross's 
"The Invisible Empire," an excellent journalistic 
work ? there have appeared Patrick MacGarvey's 
"CIA: The Myth and the Madness," J. Fletcher 
Prouty's "The Secret Team," and Alfred McCoy's 
?,''The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia." 
Just out is "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" 
'by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks, the most 
? authoritative to date. Now looming over the horizon 
is still another expose; this one planned by Philip 
,B. F. Agee,, who spent many years under-cover in 
Latin America until in 1969 he quit the CIA, 
apparently much disillusioned, to retire to En-
gland. His British?publishers, Penguin, are said to 
have been asked to cut several passages by British 
? intelligence ? working, presumably; at the behest 
of their American counterparts. 
"This publicity is unprecedented," said an 
intelligence specialist here. "The CIA seems unable 
to hold cover on anything these days. It must really 
be bothering them." 
So it appears. Six months ago the new CIA 
director William F. Colby, a trim ex-Princetonian 
? with a quarter-century experience in clandestine 
operations, sent up for White House approval draft 
amendments to the 1947 National Security Act 
,(which created the CIA). If passed by Congress ? 
which now seems increasingly unlikely in today's 
reaction to Watergate ? the legislation would 
impose 10-year jail terms and.. $10,000 fines on 
anyone violating what the CIA calls "secrecy." 
Exposes preferred to denials 
Under Mr. Colby's proposals all book, magazine, 
newspaper, radio, and television exposure of the 
CIA or its sister intelligence agencies could be 
'blocked or litigated to death. That is, all but what 
the CIA wants put out, such as pictures of Director 
and Mrs. Colby on the recent cover, of a nationally 
syndicated Sunday supplement. 
In an article inside, Mr. Colby explained how he 
was refurbishing the CIA's 'image, especially by 
gutting back on "dirty tricks" overseas. Indepen-
dent and authoritative reports suggest that if dirty 
tricks abroad are diminishing; the CIA itself is not. 
At this moment it is expanding its overseas 
operations, especially in politically wobbly Portu-
gal and Spain, and currently pressing the State 
Department for more "cover slots" (embassy jobs 
that provide a legitimate diplomatic cover for CIA 
agents). t 
The Agency's bid for censorship power came to 
*light in June, when the agency unsuccessfully 
sought court orders that would. virtually have 
gutted the Marchetti-Marks book prior to publica-
tion. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Rich-
mond, Va., threw out all but a handful of CIA-
demanded deletions and let the book be published 
by Alfred A. Knopf, lee. But the CIA's struggle to 
control everything written about it continues. 
The struggle points up increasing skepticism in 
Washington over official declarAtions of what is 
legitimate "national security" ? as distinct from 
what is merely convenient secrecy to cover up 
government blundering or illegality. 
In this climate of skepticism, especially among 
young Americans, the nation seems avid for 
exposes of the CIA and of other government 
intelligence agencies: Defense Department in-
telligence, the code-cracking National Security 
Agency, the spy satellite National Reconnaissance 
Office. Wary of what their leaders tell them, many' 
Americans seem to be finding the confessions of the 
spy masters credible and far more interesting than 
official denials. 
What has gone wrong? Two of the many potential 
criticisms of the CIA come principally to mind. 
First, the agency has undoubtedly been damaged 
,by revelations in the Watergate hearings of its 
pliant obedience to White House orders of question-
able legality and morality. Second, there is mount-
ing concern about the CIA's ' size, cost, and 
:contribution to the nation's higher interest. 
? It is not without significance that the ,ultra-
suspicious Nixon administration placed under 
former CIA director Richard M. Helms two 
successive deputies ? Gen. Robert Cushman, 
,U.S.M.C., and Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, U.S. Army 
, ? each of whom had been personally attached to 
Mr. Nixon when he Was Vice-President. Their 
political loyalty to Mr. Nixon was unquestioned. 
It was General Cushman 1,,vho;, on John Ehrlich-, 
man's telephoned instruction in 1971, made avail-
able to E. Howard Hunt the false'wigsand other spy 
claptrap used for the burglary of Dr. Daniel 
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office. It was Mr. 14elms, 
himself, who ordered CIA taiieS 'and memoranda 
destroyed one week after receiving a request from 
Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield (D) of 
Montana in January, 1973, that all "evidentiary 
materials" of possible usefulness to th6 Watergate, 
Investigation be preserved. 
"The nation must to a degree take it on faith,", 
Mr. Helms told the American Society of Newspaper 
Editors in 1971 "that we,' too, are honorable men 
devoted to her service." 
Sen. Howard H. Baker (R) of Tennessee, deputy 
chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, 
raised, in' a 43-page report recently issued, many 
disturbing questions indicating CIA involvement in 
?a wide range of domestic skullduggery ? in flat 
violation of Congress's intent in 1947 when it 
created the CIA for overseas spying and strong-
arm activities and specifically barred it from such 
actions inside the U.S. 
Over the years successive presidents seem to 
have flouted Congress's ban and have begun using 
.the CIA for domestic political purposes through' a 
series of top-secret (even from Congress) National ' 
Security Council Intelligence directives. Only the 
President and a handful of top aides, including the 
-Approved -For-Re1ease-2001/08/08 CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-1 
Appi-oved For Release 2001/08/08: CIA-RDP77-00432R0001003400073 
? Director of Central Intelligence, ever see these. 
Defense lawyers for Bernard Barker and Eu-
genio Martinez, two of the CIA-subsidized "bur-
glars" caught and sentenced in the Watergate 
affair and subsequently charged also with having 
participated in the Ensberg 'break-in, have de-
manded CIA files. They claim that these will show 
"compelling parallels" between the Watergate, 
Ellsberg, and "previous" operations. 
This reference to "previous" actions suggest to 
CIA-watchers here the curious break-ins, still 
officially "unresolved" by the FBI or any other 
U.S. law enforcement agency, at Chilean diplo-
matic premises in Washington and New York in 
1971 and 1972. At that time the Nixon administration 
was at serious odds with the then leftist Chilean 
government headed by Salvador Allende Gossens. 
More important than the CIA's unquestioning 
'obedience to questionable White House directives 
on Watergate, however, is the larger question: How 
well is the CIA serving the true national interest? 
The U.S. unquestionably needs swift intelligence. 
Does it get it from the CIA? 
Marchetti and Marks, in their book, make a 
strong case for reorganizing the agency. With its 
$750 million annual budget and its 16,000 employees' 
it is supposed to, but cannot possibly ride herd on all 
the other intelligence agencies in the federal 
government. 
The CIA director, with sub-cabinet rank and that 
$750 million budget, cannot and does not control the 
intelligence operations of the Defense Department, 
.whose Secretary has full cabinet rank and an 
annual budget exceeding $80 billion. As one recent 
'Defense Secretary told this writer, "If Helms had 
ever come to my office and told me how to spend 
my intelligence funds I'd have told him to get. 
out

out of here!' ? 
Presidential directives and Mr. Colby's: asser-
tions notwithstanding, the CIA spends about 12 
cents of the .annual U.S. intelligence dollar ($750 
million out of $6 billion). So .long as the Pentagon 
?controls the spending of 80 percent ($4 billion out of 
the total $6 billion) it will rule the roost. Power in 
Washington means control of "resources" ? and ? 
compared with the Pentagon's the CIA's are 
limited. . 
The CIA at the start had a real function. In 1948, 
at the beginning of the Cold War, President Truman 
needed a "strong arm" group to spy on and counter 
Soviet machinations in war-shattered Western 
Europe, Greece, Iran, Korea, and elsewhere. He 
selected a former OSS man, Frank G. Wisner, and 
told him to create such a group and to report 
directly and solely to Secretary of State Marshall 
and Defense Secretary Forrestal. ? ', 
Mr. Wisner's team, code-named the OPC (Office 
iof Policy Coordination), unquestionably helped the 
'visible 'NATO forces block Soviet ambitions in 
Western Europe through a combination of brains, 
? 
brawn, and enormous secret slush funds. 
During the Korean war, however, Mr. Wiener's 
clandestine operators were merged with the fast- ? 
expanding CIA, and, ever. since Allen Dulles 
became CIA chief in 1952,. the mystique of "covert" 
action has dominated the agency. Successive 
directors ? Dulles, McCone, Helms, now Colby ?? 
have tended to favor the agency's clandestine 
action role rather than that eriginally foreseen by 
Congress, namely that of objective intelligence 
evaluation. 
. Even today two-thirds of its employees (about 
10,000) and half its budget (about $375 million) 
belong to the clandestine side of the house. 
And what are the "operators" doing? In the 1960s 
they ran secret air forces in the Congo, a secret' 
army of 30,000 anti.Communist guerrillas in Laos, 
otherwise took the field with questionable efficacy 
in Cambodia and Vietnam. But now, with the U.S. 
leaving Indo-China, what is their function? "Buy-

ing" Third World politicians? Subsidizing news-
papers and trade unions in Latin America, Africa 
and Asia? If so, under what rules and what 
watchdog? 
The U.S. needs intelligence on troop deployments 
and missile developments in the U.S.S.R. and 
'China, its only potential military rivals. But spy 
,satellites and electronic interception already pro-
;vide 98 percent of such information. Human agents 
are supposed to discern an enemy's intentions as ! 
distinct from his capabilities. 
But since the ,Russians detected Col. Oleg ' 
Penkovsky spying for the British and the Amer- , 
icans and shot him in 1962, intelligence experts 
concede that the CIA has derived virtually nothing 
of national importance from spies in the Commu-
nist world. What it gets principally is information 
passed on by Communist-bloc politicians, much of , 
which is gossip and hearsay. ? 
Bureaucratic momentum carries the CIA along, 
senior senators and congressmen who have the ., 
power to impose reforms have neither the time to 
probe nor the inclination. There are no votes or 
campaign contributions here; it is ea?ier to look the 
other way. 
"Control" over the CIA, which the agency touts 
endlessly in self-justification, is a fiction. The CIA 
is the President's secret arm, and no President 
inheriting such awesome power is likely to give it 
Watchdog panel recommended 
Only he and his intimate aides can find out what it 
is doing, and so long as the CIA follows their orders 
? rightly or wrongly ? the nation and Congress 
will remain essentially in the dark. 
The PFIAB (President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board), a watchdog panel of 12 or more 
distinguished citizens, spends two days a month in ? 
Washington purportedly examining CIA and other 
intelligence agency functions; far too little to know: 
the facts. The OMB (Office of Manageinent and, 
Budget) reviews the CIA's secret yearly budget, ? 
but OMB is the President's instrument. 
True "control" over the CIA cculd nonetheless be 
assured by creating an independent panel of, say, 6 
to 12 retired judges plus academics, industrialists, 
scientists, and such consumers of intelligence 
material as ambassadors, generals and admirals, 
preferably. recently retired, too. The key word here 
would be "independent." 
Such men, free from. bureaucratic loyalties and 
'from all ambition but service to their country, 'could 
hew through agency propaganila to the .sinew of - 
national usefulness. It could be done, if any current 
or future president wanted it done.. , - 
In six Months to a year such a group would know 
what to recommend: scrapping or keeping various 
functions. Certainly the CIA's intelligence eval-
.. 
uation function is vital. So is counterespionage, a-
highly subtle technique ? which the FBI performs 
at home ? but which CIA experts perform abroad 
in close liaison with friendly intelligence services. 
A case might be made for continuing and 
expanding. CIA research and development ? 
especially to help monitor SALT or other dis-
armament agreements on which world peace may 
largely depend if the "balance of terror" is slowly 
dismantled. 
But what seems long overdue is a ruthless 
pruning of the clandestine services now in their 26th 
year: overstaffed, overfunded, and increasingly 
out of tune with America's mood. 
Only the President of the U.S., in the last resort, s 
can remold the CIA. He can abuse it, as Mr. Nixon 
did in the Watergate and Ellsberg cases, or he can 
use it as Congress intended and as the national 
interest demands: a supreme tribunal sifting 
through the oceans of intelligence that lap the 
shores of the U.S. daily and then passing the 
conclusions to the decisionmakers.

minority Government. The 
clandestine activities, Mr. Xis-I 
singer said, were not aimed at 
subverting that Government. 
Among those heavily sub-
sidized, the sources said, 
were the organizers of a na-
tionwide truck? strike that 
lasted 26 days in the fall of 
1972, ?seriously disrupting 
Chile's economy and provoking 
the first of a series of labor 
crisis for President Allende. 
?Direct subsidies, the souces 
said, also were provided for a 
strike of middle-class shop-
keeprs and a taxi strike, 
A gives it to B and C and D," 
the official said, "in a sense 
it's true that D got it but the 
question is?did we give it to 
A knowing that D woald get 
it?" 
The official added htat it was 
"awfully hard" to maintain con-' 
trol over local field operatives, 
particularly when large sums 
of cash were involved.; 
A number of sources also ex-
plained that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, by using the 
Chilean black market, was able 
to increase the basic buying 
power of the $7-million esti-
mated to have spent on clandes-
tine efforts between 1970 and 
1973; The unofficial exchange 
rate, sources said, was as much 
as 800 per cent higher than the 
official rate, indicating that the 
C.I.A.'s cash could have had a 
local impact of more than $40-
million. , 
Informers Inside Parties 
The sources depicted the gen-
eral involvement of the intel-
ligence agency with the labor 
unions and trade groups as part 
of a broad effort to infiltrate 
all areas of Chile's govern-
mental and political life. The 
sources said that by the end 
of the Allende period, the agen-
cy had agents and informers in 
among others, that disrupted every major, party making up 
the capital city of Santiago in Mr. Allende s Popular Unity

concluded, made a violent 
overthrow inevitable.

readily acknowledging the in- 
be-
ing made by the Allende Gel,- 
the major revolutionary group 
outside the Allende coalition.

! In fact, The Times's sources 
32 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDF'77-00432R000100340007-3 
agreed, less than half the 
money made available for clan-
destine activities in Chile was 
provided for the direct support 
of the allegedly threatened 
politicians, newspapers apd 
radio-television stations 're-
ferrerd to by Mr. Ford.' 
Official Defends Activities 
One official, .with first-hand 
knowledge of the decision-mak-
ing on Chile, strongly defended, 
the intelligence agency's in-.volvement with trade unions 
and organized strikes. 
. "Of course, the agency tries 
to support the people who be-
lieve in its aim," he said. "In-
the taxicab driver strike, our 
goal is to make sure that he 
[the driver on strike] is not go-
ing to fold. The strike money 
was used to supply subsistence 
for people who believed in what 
you do." 
"You've got to understand 
what was going on," the offi-
cial added. 
"The intelligence reports 
coming to us were frightening. 
Allende would send Popular 
Unity representatives into a 
business and 'claim that the 
worker were complaining about 
high profits." , 
"Then they'd take over the 
books and raise the taxes 50 
per cent," be said. "It was a 
very brutal policy." 
? "So our idea was to prevent 
this from working and money 
was the way to go," the offie 
.cial said. "What we really were 
doing was supporting a civilian 
resistance movement against 
an arbitrary Government. Our 
target was the middle-class 
groups who were working 
against Allende." ? 
"The whole point of this is 
that covert action provides a 
1 per cent impetus for some-
thing that the people want any-
way," he said. "In a civilized 
country, the C.I.A. can only 
make a marginal input. It takes 
a lot of money and?this is 
most important?you don't do 
it unless you're told to [by high-
er authority in Washington]." 
Aid to Publicize Unrest 
Some financial support for 
newpaper and radio stations 
was needed in Chile, the official 
explained, because "it wouldn't 
have been goo dto have strikes 
if nobody knows about it." 
Most of the funds invested 
for propaganda purposes, the 
official said, went to El Mer-
curio, the main opposition news-
paper in Chile. "It was the 
only serious political force 
among the newspapers and 
television stations there," he 
said. 
"As long as you don't make 
it sound like we were trying 
to start a coup, it'll be all 
right," the official added. 
."You've got to understand 
that he [Allende] was taxing 
them (the middle-class] to 
death." 
The official noted that the 
policy toward Chile, author-
ized by the 40 Committee, had 
been the subject of intense de-
bate in the Nixon Administra-
tion. One concern, he said, was 
that intervention Would serve 
to polarize further the classes 
in Chile. "And if Allende de-
cided to bear down and de-
stroy the middle class," thei 
['afield added, "some of us 
thought it might restilt in a 
dictatorship of ? the left or the 
right?and that wasn't' such a 
good idea." .? 
Military Coup Unexpected 
The -official described the 
Administration's policy in Chile 
as a failure. "We were ? not 
looking for a military take-
over," he declared.. 
A different opinion about the 
ultimate goals of the Admini-
stration's policy was provided 
in an interview by a source who 
served a number of years in 
Chile. 
"The people within the Em-
bassy, "felt that they were 
engaged in. a kind of warfare," 
"people either were with you or 
against you when it came to 
Allende." 
"There were a lot of people in 
Santiago on the far right who 
were essentially dedicating their 
lives to the overthrow of Al-
lende-Lit was like a holy war," 
the source said. "These people 
were increasingly seen at the 
mbassy in 1972 and 1973." 
At the time, he added, "just 
putting some resources at their 
disposal alone would be 
enough." 
In testimony Monday before 
a House subcommittee investi-
gating the activities in Chile, 
Richard R. Fagen, a professor 
,who did reseach in Chile in 
. 1972 and 1973, said he had been 
approached by an American 
Embassy official in Santiago 
and utged to aid in covert gath-
ering of information on left-
? wing groups. ? 
Mr. Fagen, who teaches po-
litical science at Stanford Uni-
versity, testified that the re-
quest had been coupled with an 
offer to help him exchange per-
sonal money "through the black 
market channeli used by the 
? embassy." ' 
All of the sources interviewed 
by The Times insisted that the 
policies regarding the clandes-
tine financing of trade groups 
and unions had been established 
? and approved by the 40 Com-
mittee. 
-Edward M. Korry and. Na-
thaniel? M. Davis, successive 
ambassadors to Chile during 
the Allende regime, freqUefitly 
reported to Mr. Kissinger, then 
former President Nixon's na-
tional security adviser, through 
confidential channels, the 
sources said. Reports with less 
sensitive information were for-
warded through the normal 
State Department channels to 
Washington, the sources said. 
They added that most, if not 
all, of the C.I.A.'s direct strike 
subsidies' for unions and trade 
groups weer initiated in 1972, 
afte Mr. Davis, a specialist on 
Eastern Europe, was assigned 
as Ambassador. 
A number of sources further 
told The Times that Mr. Colby, 
contrary to many published ac-
counts, had fully briefed two 
Congressional subcommittees 
about the intelligence agency's 
financing of union and trade 
? groups during the Allende re-
gime. 
During those briefings, which 
were before the Senate Foreign 
Affairs Subcommittee on West-
ern Hemisphere Affairs and the 
!House Armed Services Subcom-
lmittee on Intelligence, Mr. Col-
ApProved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-3 
iby sought to emphasize, the 
'sources said, that the C.I.A. 
'began to pull back on its clan-
destine commitments in Chile 
!late in the spring of 1973, when 
there were almost weekly re-
ports of an impending coup. 
Link to Military Severed 
At one point in the spring, 
the sources said, the agency 
did formally break its direct re-
lations with the Chilean milltary, which was known to be 
plotting against President Al-
lende. Although direct contact 
was eliminated,, the sources 
said, the agency continued to 
maintain a liaison role for .in-
telligencey purposes. 
There was concern in the 
C.I.A. a reliable source said, 
:about "getting involved with 
'people who were shorter-term 
'people than we were." 
i "Our goals were longer term," 
Ihe said, in an allusion to the 
,official Ford Administration po-
sition now that the agency's 
'objective had been to prevent 
the possible establishenent of a 
, - 
;one-party Government by Mr. 
lAllende. 
Questions about the United 
States' clandestine role in pro-
moting the 1973 truck strike 
have repeatedly been raised by 
supporters of President Allende, 
who lose his life in the eoup:' 
e In an interview in Mexico 
,City last year, Mr. Allende's 
widow, Hortensia Bussi de Al-
lende, charged that the United 
'States "had a great responsi-
bility in what happened." 
She asserted that the truck 
strike, which involved about 
50,000 workers, had, been fi-
nanced by American money. 
"What were they living on if 
they were not working?" she 
asked. "They had to be fi-
nanced from outside." 
In August, 1973, & news-
paper in Santiago, Ultima Rota, 
accused the United States of 
NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1974 
having financed both the truck 
strike in the fall of 1972 and a 
strike then in progress. Mr. 
Davis, then the Ambassador, 
refused to comment. 
After the coup, the State De-
partment formally denied any 
financial involvement in the 
1973 truck strike or the other 
work stoppages and protests 
in Chile, declaring that "such 
suggestions are absurd." 
Jack B. Kubisch, then As..
sistant Secretary of State for 
Inter-American Affairs, refused 
Ito answer in public when 
queried about such financing, 
during 3 House hearing after 
the Allende coup. 
C.I.A.'s Covert Role: Ford's Defense Runs Against Current 
Trend 
By CLIFTON DANIEL 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 ?I 
President Ford helped revive al 
dying issue last night. That is-
sue was whether it was proper 
for a democracy, using its in-
telligence agencies to intervene 
in the internal af-
fairs of other coun-
News tries. 
Analysis Mr. Ford, at a 
news conference, 
seemed to answer 
the question affirmatively. He 
acknowledged that the United 
States had made an effort to 
preserve an .opposition press 
and opposition political parties 
in Chile during the rule of a 
Marxist President, Salvador Al-
lende Gossens, ?who died in a 
military coup in September, 
1973. 
President Ford justified the 
effort, which was made during 
the Nixon Administration, by 
saying that it was "in the best 
interest of the people of Chile, 
and certainly in our best 
interest." 
"I am reliably informed," 
Mr. Ford said, "that Commu-
nist nations spend vastly more 
money than we do for the same 
kind of purpose." 
His response was presumably 
considered in advance- He had 
every reason to expect a ques-
tion on the subject because of 
the recent disclosure that the 
Nixon Administration author-
ized the Central Intelligence 
Agency to spend $8-million on 
covert activities in Chile be-
tween 1970 and 1973. 
Indeed, Mr. Ford may have 
had the help of those who au-
thorized those expenditures in 
framing his reply. In any event, 
he chose to defend the behavi-
or of the old Administration 
rather than chart a new policy 
for his own. 
His response was presumably 
considered in advance. He had 
every reason to expect a ques-
tion on the subject. Last week 
it was disclosed that the Nixon 
Administration lied authorized 
the Central Intelligence Agency 
to spend $8-million on covert 
activities in Chile between 1970 
and 1973. Those activities were 
approved by the so-called 40 
Committe, whose chairman was 
and is Secretary of Steee Kis-
singer. Appro 
Mr. Ford possibly may have 
had the help of those who 
authorized those expenditures 
in framing his reply. In any 
event, the President chose to 
defend the behavior of the old 
Administration rather than 
chart a new policy for his own. 
Cold-War Rhetoric Seen 
Another kind of reply was 
possible. The President might 
have said that he was not re-
sponsible for past activities of 
the C.I.A., but would be re-
sponsible for its future behav-
ior, and would accordingly re-
view its policies and plans: 
He did promise to meet with 
the Congressional committees 
that review the covert, actions 
of the agency td see whether 
they might want to change the 
review process. Those commit-
tees, however, are not noted in 
? Washington for vigor and skep-
ticism. 
Mr. Ford himself was a mem-
ber of one of them for nitre 
years when he was a Repre-
sentative from Michigan. 
? His reversion last night to 
the reason and rhetoric of the 
cold war, however mildly ex-
pressed, led to speculation 
that his mind was still set in 
that mold. 
"If it was good enough for 
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy,. 
Johnson and Nixon, then it's 
good enough for Ford," one of 
the President's friends re-
marked today. 
"That's the way he thinks." 
Even in an Administration 
that has been dedicated to 
openness and candor, President 
Ford was judged in Washington 
to have spoken with remark-
able frankness. 
"It is the first time in my 
memory that a President has 
come out flatly and said, 'We 
do it, the other side does it, 
and we do it," said Prof. Rich-
ard N. Gardner, a specialist in 
international law at Columbia 
University, speaking from New 
York. 
Secret C.I.A. operations such 
as the overthrow of Premier 
Mohammed Mossadegh of Iran 
in 1953 and President Jacobo 
Arbenz Guzman of Guatemala 
in 1954, the Bay of Pigs inva-
sion of Cuba in 1961 and later 
operations in Laos have been 
identified when they became 
e tuo_bia kncli notorious to be Lone 
e.~ e ease 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-3 
33 
However, none has ever been 
acknowledged as readily and 
fully as the Chile operation, al-
though the acknowledgment 
was low-keyed. 
It came, oddly, when such ac-
tivities seemed to be going out 
of style. Eighteen months ago 
the Nixon Administration let it 
be known that the clandestine 
operations of the CIA; were 
being curtailed. 
-M1 Just last week, William E. 
Colby, Director of Central Intel-
ligence, said it was "clear that 
American policy today is differ-
ent from when it was confront-
ing worldwide Communist sub-
version in the nineteen fifties 
or Communist insurgency in 
the ninetee sixties." 
"As a result," Mr. Colby told 
the Fud for 'Peace conference 
ill Washington, "C.I.A.'s in-
volvement in covert action is 
very small indeed." 
Abandoning covert action en-
tirely "would not have a major 
impact on our current activities 
or the current security of the 
United States," Mr. Colby ack-
nowledged. 
However, the capacity for 
Such action may be needed in 
case of some new threat, he ad-
ded, and it would be a mistake 
to "leave us with nothing be-
tween a diplomatic protest and 
sending the Marines." - 
There was a conspicuous dif-
ference in tone between Mr. 
Colby and President Ford, his 
new boss, but both seemed to 
take it for granted that the 
United States had the right to 
intervene in the affairs of 'other 
countries in its own interest. 
When Mr. Ford was asked 
what international law gave the 
United States the right to "des-
tabilize the constitutionally 
elected government of another 
country,' the President de-
clined to talk about law, but 
said, "it's a recognized fact 
that historically, as well as pre-
sently, such actions are taken 
'in the best interests of the 
countries involved." 
I Commenting on that, Senator' 
Frank Church, Democrat of Ida-
ho, who is a high-ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, said today: 
"It seems he declared that the 
!United States-respects no law 
lother than the lawof the jungle 
in its dealings . with foreign 
countries. He equates us with 
the Russians. I thought there 
wes a difference, and the differ-
ence is What it's all about."

in the Congo in 1964?are provided 
by a ' private ' arms dealer. The: 
largest such dealer in the United 
States is the International -Arma-
ment ? Corporation, or Interarmco, 
which has its main .office and some 
warehouses on the waterfront in 
Alexandria, Virginia. Advertising 
:that it specialises in arms for law-
enforcement agencies, the corpor-
ation hasmutlets in Manchester in 
England, Monte Carlo; Singapore, 
Pretoria, and several Latin Ameri-
can cities. Interarmco was founded 
in 1953 by Samuel Cummings, a 
CIA officer during the Korean War. 
Although it is now a truly private 
corporation; it still maintains close 
ties with the CIA. 
Direct CIA ownership of Radio 
.Free Europe and Radio Liberty, 
and direct involvement in Inter-
armco, are largely past history 
now.. Nevertheless, the Agency is 
. still very much involved in the pro-
, prietary business. 
Incredible as it may seem, the., 
1CIA. is the owner of one of the 
biggest?if not the biggest?fleets ? 
of ' commercial ' airplanes in the. 
world. Agency proprietaries in-
dude Air America, Air Asia, Civil ? 
Air Transport, Rocky Mountain 
?Air, Southern Air Transport, ? ? ? 
and several-other air charter corn-. 
panies around the world. 
Air America was set up in thel 
late 1950s to 'accommodate the. 
Agency's rapidly growing opera-
tions in South-east Asia. As US 
involvement deepened in that part. 
of the world, other Government 
agencies also turned to Air: 
America to transport their people 
and supplies. In fact, Air America 
was able to generate so muth busi-
ness in South-east Asia that eventu-
ally other American airlines took. 
note of the profits to be made. 
One private company, Conti-
nental Airlines, made a successful 
moye in the mid-1960s to take some 
of the market away from ? Air 
America. Pierre Salinger, who be-
came an officer of Continental after 
his years as President Kennedy's 
press secretary, led Continental's 
. fight to gain its share of the lucra-
tive Southeast Asian ousiness. 
Rather than face the possibility 
of unwanted publicity the CIA 
permitted Continental to move 
into Laos, where since the late 
1960s it has flown charter flights 
worth millions of dollars annually. 
And Continental's best customer is 
the CIA itself. 
, 
But even with Continental flying 
in Laos, the Agency was able to 
keep most of the flights for its own 
Air America which, before the 
flying 
ceasefire in Vietnam, was 
125 planes of its own, with roughly 
one of 
anking 
40 more on lease. It was 
America's largest airlines, r 
just behind National in the total 
hat the 
number of planes. Now t 
US military forces have withdrawn; 
from the Vietnamese theatre, the 
role of maintaining a significant 
American influence has reverted 
d ? Air. 
largely to the CIA?an 
America is finding its services

bership of Communist 
and Hungary, has signed a c

port its supervision of the Vietnam 
ceasefire. . 
? 
? 
and eventually halted during the 
1960s, this airline was reduced in 
size to a few planes, helicopters, 
and a supply; of spare parts. Still, 
up to the late 1960s, it flew 
charters for the Nepalese Govern-
ment and private organisations in 
,the area. 
34 
Perhaps the CIA's most out-of-
the-way proprietary was located in 
Katmandu, Nepal. It was estab-
lished to provide air support for 
Agency-financed and directed 
tribesmen who were operating in. 
Chinese-controlled Tibet. As the 
Tibetan operations were cut back 
The CIA's Planning- Program-
ming, :ind Budgeting Stafj back in, 
Largiey, Virginia, believed that the 
ahline's usefulness as an Agency 
asset had passed, and the decision. 
was made to sell' it off. 
But for the CIA to sell a pro-
prietary is a very difficult process. 
The Agency feels- that it must 
maintain the secrecy of its covert 
,involvement, no matter how moot 
or insignificant the secrecy, and 
it does not want to be identified in 
any way, either before or after the 
actual transaction. - 
Although the boards of directors 
of the air proprietaries are studded 
with the names of eminently 
respectable business leaders and 
financiers, the companies' opera-
tions were actually for i long 
time in the hands of one rather 
singular man, George Doole, 
Until . his retirement in 1971; 
Doole's official titles were presi-
dent of the Pacific Corporation and 
chief executive of Air America and 
Air Asia; it was under his leader-
ship that the CIA air proprietaries 
blossomed. 
? Doole was known to his col.' 
leagues in the, Agency as a superb 
businessman. He had a talent for 
expanding ? his airlines and for. 
making them, functionally if not 
formally, into profit-making con-
cerns.. In fact, his proprietaries 
pr3ved something of an embar-
Tassment to the Agency because 
of their profitability:. 
Doole's empire- Was fornially 
placed under the CIA's Directorate 
of 'Support on the ? Agency's 
organisation chart, although many 
of its operations were superVised.-
by the Clandestine Services. But 
. so little was known inside CIA 
headquarters about the air pro- ? 
prietaries, which employed almost 
as many people as the Agency 
itself (18,000), that in 1965 a CIA, 
'officer with extensive Clandestine 
Services experience was assigned to 
make a study of their operations 
Or the Agency's top officials. 
This officer spent the better part 
of a year trying to assemble the 
relevant data, and became increas-
ingly frustrated as he proceeded., 
He found that the various pro-
prietaries were constantly trading, 
leasing, and selling aircraft to each 
other; that the tail numbers of 
many planes were regularly 
changed; and that the mixture of ? 
profit-making and covert flight 
made accounting almost impos-
sible. lie finally put up a huge map

Finally, Richard Helms, then 
Deputy Director, was invited to see 
the snap and he briefed on the 
complexity of the airlines. A wit-, 
ness described Helms as being 
'aghast.' 
?  
- In 1968, the ? CIA's Executive. 
Committee for Air met to deal with 
a request from George Doole for 
several million dollars to:: 
' modernise ' Southern Air Trans-' 
port. Doole's justification for he't 
money was that every major air-
line in the world was using jets, 
ow: 
ye' 
aid 
and that Southern needed to foil 
suit if it were to continue to Ii 
its cover.' Additionally Doole s 
that Southern should have equip-
he 
ment as effective as possible in t , 
event the Agency had to call on 
tin 
he: 
;ti-
ge 
tin 
it for future contingencies in La . 
America. 
? Previous to Doole's request, t 
Agency's Board of National Fan 
mates had prepared a long-ra 
assessment of events in La 
America. This estimate bad been 
approved by the Director and sent 
to the President at the White House
el-
ateedhe. 
as the official analysis of the int 
ligence community. The esti 
m 
:strongly implied . that co u 
ntin 
open US intervention in t 
internal affairs of Latin American 
nations would only make matters , 
worse and further damage the 
ArperiCan image. in that region. 
? 
. At 1 he meeting, Doole Was asked 
if he thought expai- ding Southern's ? 
capabilities for future interven-
tions in Latin America conformed 
with the conclusions of the esti-
mate.' Doole remained silent, but 
a Clandestine Services officer 
Working in paramilitary affairs 
replied that the estimate might 
well have been a- correct appraisal 
of the. Latin American situation, 
but that non-intervention, would 
not necessarily become official 
American policy. The Clandestine 
Services man pointed out that over 
the years there had been other 
developments in Latin America-L-
in countries such as Guatemala and' 
,the Dominican Republic?where 
the Agency had been called on by 
the White House to take action - 
against existing political trends;:: 
and that the Director (and the 
Clandestine Services and Doole)' 
also had a responsibility to be 
-ready for the worst contingencies. 
In working to strengthen South-
ern Air Transport and his other 
proprietaries, Doole and the Clan-
destine Services were following 
one of the basic maxims of covert 
"action: Build assets now for future 
contingencies. It proved to be 
persuasive strategy, as the Director 
personally ? approved Doole's ? 
.request and Southern received its 
several million dollars for jets. 
So if the US government decides 
.to intervene covertly in the 
internal affairs of a Latin Ameri-
can country, Doole's planes will be. 
available to support the operation.

? ? 
.?00000000 000, OOOOOO 
THE sarise technological explosion 
which has affected nearly every 
other aspect of modern life has also 
,drastically changed the intelligence 
trade. 
A report on-clandestine activities 
in Latin America during the 1960s 
by the CIA Inspector General, for 
example, revealed that a good part 
of the intelligence collected by the 
Agency in that region ? came from 
audio devices. In quite a few of the 
Latin nations., the report noted, the 
CIA was regularly intercepting the 
telephone conversations of import-
ant officials and had managed to 
place bugs in the homes of many. 
key personnel, up to and including, 
' cabinet ministers. In some coun-
tries allied to the US, the 
Agency shares in the informa-
tion acquired from audio surveil-
lance conducted by the host intel-
ligence service, which often 
-receives technical assistance from' 
the CIA. for this very purpose?
and may be penetrated by the CIA 
,in the process. ? 
The .Agency's successes with' 
? -bugs and taps have usually been 
'limited to the non-Communist ? 
countries, where relatively lax in-. 
ternal security systems do not deny: 
CIA op-orations the freedom of, 
movement necessary to installing 
eavesdropping devices. . 
In technical espionage, 
America's first experience came in' 
the form of radio intercepts and 
code-breaking. In 1952 the Presi-
dent, by secret executive order, 
established the National Security, ? 
Agency (NSA) to interceptand de-
cipher the communications of both 
the nation's enemies and its friends 
and to ensure that US codes were 
? secure from similar eavesdropping.' 
The NSA, though placed under the 
control of the Defence Department, 
soon established an independent 
bureaucratic identity of its oWn?
and at present has a huge budget 
? ,of well over a billion dollars 'per 
annum and a work-force of some 
25,000. 
Although the NSA engineered. 
? 
_ . 
some success against the Eastern 
-European countries and Commun-
ist China in its early days, for at 
least the last 15 years it has been 
completely unable to break into the 
high-grade cipher system and codes . 
of these nations. Against such 
major targets, the NSA has been 
reduced to reading comparatively 
unimportant communications be-
tween low-level military compon-
ents and the equally inconsequent-
ial routine exchanges between low-
grade bureaucrats and economic 
planners. This is far short of learn-
ing, the Soviet Union's or China's' 
,most vital secrets. . 
  0-000 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? o 
As with so many other parts of-
the American intelligence appara-
tus, the NSA has had considerably 
more success operating against the 
Third World countries and even 
Rektaties200008,i081traniiRDFMLIO 
35 
what is reportedly the largest hank' 
of computers in the world and thou-
sands of cryptanalysts, the NSA has 
had little trouble with the codes 
and ciphers of these nations. ' 
  ? ? ? ? ? ? - 
, 
Sometimes the Agency may' con 
,cluct a physical attack on another 
country's communications systeni 
a clandestine operation to steal a? 
tcode book or cipher system, the, 
suborning of a communications 
clerk, or the planting of an audio. 
device in an embassy radio room. 
Within the CIA's Clandestine Ser-, 
vices, a special, unit of Foreign 
Intelligence (espionage) Staff 
specialises in these attacks. 
Numerous foreign embassies in 
Washington are already wiretap-
ped, but by the FBI. This wiretap 
programme, like some of the NSA' 
intercept operations, also provides; 
information about Americans. in' 
co-operation w,ith the Chesapeake 
and Potomac Telephone Company: 
(a Bell subsidiary), FBI agents re-
gularly monitor the phones in the 
offices of all Communist Govern-
ments represented in Washington; 
on occasion, the embassies of vari-
ous non-Communist countries have 
their phones tapped, especially 
When their nations are engaged in. 
negotiations with the US Govern-. 
ment or when important develop-
ment? are taking place in these 
? Countries. ? 
And it is not only foreign em-': 
bassies which are .kept under' 
surveillance. The State Depart-
ment long ago recognised that its 
most secret cables are not secure 
from CIA inspection by setting up 
special communications channels 
which supposedly cannot be deci-
phered by the CIA. 
When, in 1968, the Ambassador' 
to Iran, Armin Meyer, ran into 
trouble with the CIA station chief 
in Teheran, Meyer switched his'' 
communications with the State 
Department in Washington to one 
of these secure 'channels. But the 
CIA had none the less figured out 
'a way to intercept his cables and! 
the replies he received from Wash.'. 
ington; and the CIA Director 
received a' copy of. each intercep-
tion. Written on top of every cable 
was a warning that the contents.. 
should be-kept especially confiden---
tial, because the State Department: 
:was unaware that the CIA had a 
copy. 
American embassies abroad have 
suffered, of course, from bugging. 
But today the likelihood of the 
KGB eavesdropping' on the activi-
ties in an embassy code room is ex-
.tremely remote. Most State Depart-
ment communications overseas are 
handled by the CIA. The machines 
and other equipment are cushioned 
and covered to mute the sounds 
emanating from them. The rooms 
themselves are encased in lead and 
rest on huge springs that further 
,reduce the internal noise. Re- : 
sembling large camping-trailers, 
the code rooms now are normally 
located deep in the concrete base-
ments of embassy buildings. Access 
? to them by sound-sensitive devices 
is, for all practical purposes, un-
'possible. 
- The official justification for all 
the technology--the wiretaps and 
audio devices, and satellite flights

-protect the national security of the 
U.S. Sometimes, the machinery is 
justified. One of the finest hours 
for the CIA and the intelligence. 
Community was produced ? by. the. 
:Cuban .missile crisis; although the' 
last National Intelligence Estimate, 
prepared by the CIA a little over 
a month before President Kennedy , 
Went on nationwide television to 
,announce the Cuban 'quarantine,' 
..declared that it was unlikely that 
:the Soviets would install nuclear-, 
_tipped missiles on the island. The 
,fact, remains: that the CIA and the 
?other intelligence agencies did dis, 
;cover?from 02 spy planes; and: 
-communications intercepts ? the 
missiles in time for the President 
to take action, and they presented 
the facts to Kennedy with no policy 
.recommendations or slanting which 
Icould have limited his options. 
,This was- how. the intelligence pro-
? cess was supposed to work. 
The basic 'reason that the *CIA 
, analysts were able to monitor the 
Soviet arms build-up more closely 
than the other intelligence agen-
cies, which had essentially the 
same information available, was 
the more refined technique that the 
, CIA had developed, including a 
special analytical tool known as 
crate-ology '?a unique method Of 
,determining the contents of the. 
large crates carried on the decks 
of the Soviet ships delivering arms. 
With a high degree of accuracy, 
the specialists' could look at aerial 
photographs of tese boxes, add. 
'information about the ship's em-
barkation point and Soviet military 
.production schedules and deduce 
what the crates contained. 
More often, though, besides' 
'supplying information, the CIA has 
profound effect on the actual' 
planning and carrying out of 
American foreign policy. Even the' 
. White House has not 'imposed close 
controrof the Agency. One eXecu'?;? 
tive organisation set up to control 
,it is the 40 Committee. The ubiqui-
tous Dr Kissinger chairs this com-
mittee, just as he heads the three' 
other principal ',White .Ilous, 
. panels which supervise the intelli-4 
"gence community. The committee' 
is supposed to meet once a week, 
but its non-CIA members from the 
State Department and the Penta-
gon have so many responsibilities 
in, . their own departments that 
meetings are frequently cancelled. 
? - Nor is the 40 Committee an 
effective watchdog when it does 
lineet. According to one veteran 
.intelligence official, it 'was like a 
bunch of schoolboys. They would 
_listen and their eyes would bug 
out. I always used to say that I 
could get $5 million out of the 4Q 
Committee for a covert operation 
?faster than I could get 'money for 
.a typewriter out of the ordinary 
'bureaucracy.' 
The 40 Committee fails to keep 
close watch on secret reconnais-
sance -activities, is ineffective in 
monitoring the CIA's covert activi, 
ties, and is totally in the dark On 
? classical espionage -operations. 
,President Nixon and especially 
Henry Kissinger Were unquestion-
ably.:aware of its shortcomings and 
did little to change things. 
Ear' 'six six years it was Nixon and 
Kissinger who ultimately deter-
mined_ how the CIA operated, and 
if -they did not want to imposn 
closer control, then the form of 
any control mechanism was mean-
? ingless. The fact remains that both 
men believed in the need for the 
VS to use clandestine methods and 
dirty tricks ' in dealing with other 
;countries,' 'and the level and types 
of' such operations obviously co-
incided With their views of bow 
America's 'Secret foreign -policy 
should be carried out. ? 
. . 
? 
As lortg as-the CIA remairi; the' 
President's loyal and personal tool 
to be used around the world at his , 
and his top adviser's discretion, no 
President is likely, barring strong, 
unforeseen pressure, to insist that' 
:the Agency's operations be brought 
iiinder- closer, outSide 
ClifigieSsional oversight has'b'eeri 
generally, limited to voting the 
CIA more than enough money for 
its needs, without seriously 
questioning how the funds would 
be spent. - 
To be sure, four separate sub-
committees of the House and Sen-
ate Armed Services committees 
were responsible for monitoring 
the CIA, but their supervision was 
minimal or non-existent. ' 
. ? 
SO the time has come, in our 
,view, to demysticise the .intelli-
gence profession, to disabuse 
people of the idea that clandestine , 
agents somehow make the world 
a safer place to live in, that exces-
sive secrecy is necessary to protect 
the national security. 
These notions simply are not 
true. The CIA and other intelli-
gence agencies have merely used 
them to build their own covert' 
empire. 
? The US intelligence community 
performs a vital service in keeping 
track of and analysing the military 
capability and strengths of the 
Soviet Union and China, but its 
other functions?the CIA's dirty 
tricks and classical espionage?are 
a liability for the country, on both 
practical and moral grounds. 
The best solution would 'be not 
simply to separate the Clandestine 
Services from the rest of the CIA, 
but to abolish them completely. 
This would deprive the Govern-
ment of-its arsenal of dirty tricks, 
but the republic could easily sus-
tain ttl-le loss?and be better for it,

Several things about this 
dimmed the glamour of the

'For one thing, the 150-ki1oton 
ceiling on the size of tests 
exceeded anything either gov-
ernment might be expected to 
test in the near future. Dr. 
Kissinger conceded that the 
ceiling? was directed at "the' 
next generation of weapons." 
For another, it became quite 
clear that Congress and the 
public might not take kindly to 
Moscow's popping off so-called 
peaceful nuclear explosions 
while the U.S. sat and watched. 
A nuclear explosion is a nu-
clear explosion, with potential 
'military application no matter 
what it is called, by all ac-
counts. Although Moscow indi-
cated it would permit outsiders 
to observe the tests, Soviet 
willingness to allow any real 
monitoring was regarded as at 
best doubtful. 
The result has been that the 
underground test agreement 
has been shelved without going 
to Congress pending agreement 
on so-called peaceful explo-
sions. That agreement, in most 
observers' 'views, will be a 
long time coming. 
Mr. Nixon left his greatest 
gap in his explanation of the 
state of negotiations on offen-
sive rockets and warheads. In-
stead of bringing a new agree-
ment to' succeed the five-year 
accord of 1972 "significantly 
closer," as he said, the discus-
sions in effect left deadlock. 
The underlying reason is ob-
vious. Offensive weapons are 
now more than ever the ulti-
mate determinant of the stra-
tegic balance. The interim 
agreement of 1972 left Moscow 
with the prospect of superior-
ity in numbers of rockets and 
power of warheads. It left the 
U.S. with a lead in technology 
and above all in numbers of 
warheads?the multiple inde-
pendently targeted re-entry ve-
hicles, or MIRV's?to be 
placed on each rocket. 
What had. become clear be-
fore the summit, and was rein-

viet Union had no intention of 
frog the current impasse, and 
try to head off the arms race 
at some greater order of mag-
nitude. 
At his briefings in Moscow 
Dr. Kissinger agonized over 
the consequences of failure. 
Given the prospects of Soviet 
MIRV deployment, he said, the 
two nations had only 18 months 
to two 'years to impose controls 
before the arms race degener-
ated into an unmanageable in-
terplay of increasing numbers. 
"And one of the questions 
which we have to ask our-
selves as a country is what in 
the name of God is strategic 
superiority? What is the sit.' 
nificance of it, politically, mili-
tarily, operationally, at these 
levels of numbers? What do 
you do with it?" 
The answers at home vary 
enormously. Finding something 
approaching a consensus is an 
essential first step toward 
dealing with Soviet intransig-
ence. At the moment a consen-
sus, seems especially remote. 
Former Senator Eugene J. 
McCarthy, who says he may 
run for President Again, sug-
gests the U.S. could initiate 
safely some "limited acts of. 
unilateral restraint" to tempt 
the Russians. Adm. Elmo R. 
Zumwalt, the former .chief of 
naval -operations, warns that 
the Soviet Union is nearing a 
significant margin of strategic. 
superiority and that detente is 
merely "a central element of. 
the Soviet political offensive.--
The admiral wants to expand 
weapons programs, not cut 
them back. 
Senator Henry M Jackson 
(D., Wash.), a yotential presi-
dential candidate, who is hr, 
creasingly powerful in stra-
tegic affairs, is one who be-
lieves Dr. Kissinger is danger-
ously resolved to reach agree-
ment for its own sake. The 
senator would link American 
trade concessions and the ex-
port of technology to the Rus-
sians to rigidly specified stra-
tegic compromose on their 
part. 
"With any future SALT 
agreement I think we should 
take a very firm stand," he 
says. "We should not subsidize 
their military-industrial com-
plex into the 1980's with a 
highly destabilizing effect on 
world peace." 
? In Senator' Jackson's view

plied."In fact, he soya, "you 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-3 
'can have a good detente or a 
bad one, and my judgment up ' 
to now is obvious; it's a bad 
one." 
Even within the executive 
branch . there are substantial 
though still vaguely defined 
differences. Dr. Kissinger 
clearly favors linkage in the 
general sense of weaving a 
skein of economic, political, 
and military agreements. But 
he also appears to believe that 
agreements feed upon each 
other and grow, and thus he 
will settle for less than the 
? hard, fixed terms demanded 
by Senator Jackson. 
Precise balance 
The Secretary of State's 
counterpart in the Defense De-
partment. James R. Schlesin-
ger, appears to come down 
more closely to the Jackson 
view, at least on the arms 
limitation talks alone. 
From what is known of his I 
differences with Dr. Kissinger, 
the Secretary of Defense de-
mands precision in the balance 
of forces. Lacing it, he is Inc-
lined. toward achange in nu-
clear targeting strategy, a po-
sition with possibly more polit-
ical than military - conse-
quences. 
For almost a decade, the 
avowed strategic policy of the 
United States has been "mu-
tual assured destruction." It 
recognized that neither nuclear 
power would be allowed by the 
other to achieve decisive nu-
clear scperiority. Therefore, 
by this concept, each need 
maintain ? only that power ne-
'cessary to discourage a nu-
clear attack, and each would 
do so by holding cities and 
populations hostage. to a retal-
iatory strike. 
If the prevalent interpreta-
tion of Mr. Schlesinger's views 
is correct, The U.S. is moving 
to target, more of the Soviet 
weapons system directly, mi-
te grounds that Moscow, by 
'insisting on strategic superior-
ity, is seeking the power of 
, nuclear blackmail. Targeting 
never has been totally selec-
tive, of course, and the politi-
cal perception of change?both 
at home and in Moscow?may 
be as important as the reality. 
arying judgmentsa 
azthese varying judgments all 
contribute to uncertainty about 
how the U.S. will proceed whn 
SALT II gets down to subst-
ance. They all are held by one 
constituency or another. 
Senator Jackson's view is 
especially important, repre-
senting not only his own con-
siderable power, but also the 
dominant view of Congress, 
which historically favors majpr 
weapons programs. ? 
In the' wake of .the first round 
of the arms talks against any, 
treaty that leaves the U.S. in a 
Position of strategic "inferior-
ity." To the extent that the 
administration challenges that 
congressional sentiment, the 
eventual results of the second 
round will face rough going on 
Capitol Hill. 
Outside the government] 
there are grave doubts about 
the arms limitation talks from 
a quite different perspective. 
Their most measured presenta-
tion comes from many of the 
so-called defense intellectuals, 
teachers and former officials 
whose dedication to arms con-
tool is passionate. In ' their 
judgment, limited agreements 
in one area of arms control 
unhappily have tended to 
speed up competition in others. 
"Exacerbating factor" 
"It can be plausibly 
argued," says George Ra-
thjens, professor of political 
science at Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, "that con-
tinuing negotiation ... may 
be an exacerbating factor in, 
the Soviet-American arms' 
competition ... Under the cir-
cumstances, a question must 
be raised as to whether con-
tinuing With SALT is .desira-
ble." . , 
He 'in ade his Point in the 
publication Arms Control 
Today before Mr. Nixon left 
office. But he says he sees no 
reason to change it now. 
"I don't see any chance of 
the Soviets coming around un-
less we take a very tough line 
on linkage," he says. "We 
would have to be very tough inl 
factoring in trade and technol-
ogy and I don't think this fits 
the mood of Congress, the 
White House or the Depart-
ment of Defense." 
The judgment of Ray S. 
Cline, former deputy director 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, comes closer to that 
of Senator Jackson. "My con-
cern," he says, "is that in our 
eagerness to make progress in 
detent we have allowed our 
central strategic interests to 
erode. mainly in Western Eu-
rope and japan." 
Mr. Cline, now director of 
studies at the Georgetown Cen-
ter for Strategic and Interna-
tional Studies, believes Dr. 
Kissinger erred in the judg-
ment that Moscow's need for 
technology and trade could be 
exploited to American benefit. 
.I.Attle practical effect 
, "I'm sure they feel in the 
light of the world economic 
situation that time is on their 
side and they might not have 
to make any concessions at 
all," he says. "I've not seen

cow might also deploy at least

? Reappraisals of record 
Figures like these also have 
caused some reappraisals of 
the past 'record. In A recent 
study Mr. Rathjens, Abram 
Chayes of Harvard University, 
and J.P. Ruina, professor AT' 
M.I.T. and formerly a govern.' 
ment adviser on nuclear wea-
pons, worred that some agree-
ments merery had forced de-
velopment into other areas. 
But politically, they concluded, 
the exercises had been useful. 
"Even the least important of 
the efforts has served to bring 
the superpowers together at ? 
times when communications 
were difficult ..." they wrote. 
"Moreover," the several arms' 
control efforts may actually' 
have operated to some degree 
as vehicles for bringing about' 
change." 
Time has shown that nations 
can ? tolerate a high degree of 
raw inferiority in simple Mili-
tary terms, as long as they 
can convince an opponent that 
attack would bring unaccepta-
ble retaliation. 
Will to act

development (if doing so) 
would limit them and benefit 
us." - 
Moscow, Mr. Cline says, is 
"feeling us out. And perhaps 
we ought to feel ourselves out 
for a while. A year ago I 
favored some rather strong 
self-limiting offer on deploy-
ment of MIR, but now ran 
more inclined to think we 
would just hurt ourselves."-. 
Underscores the estent to 
which the current state of the 
strategic arms talks grows out 
of previous agreements. It also 
demonstrates once again how 
closely linked the arms nego-
tiations are to the overall pat-
tern of political and economic 
relations. , 
It has become more and 
more apparent that the pattern 
of agreements, while creating 
an atmosphere of controls, has 
had little practical effect in 
reducing the arms race. The 
limited tedst ban treaty of 1963 
had the eminently desirable 
effect of ending nuclear pollu-
tion in, the air by the great 
powers. 
Credible balance 
It -also was thought that lim-
iting tests would prevent the 
deployment of bigger warheads 
becuase nations would not 
commit untested devices. But 
, now there is some uneasy re-
trospective thought that the 
restriction may have contrib-
uted to the U.S. and Soviet 
decisions to develop MIRV's?
using smaller, already tested 
warheads. . And MIRV, of 
course, is now, the main prob-
lem. 
Other weaknesses in pre-
vious* agreements are appar-
ent: The nations that might 
have been expected to go nu-
clear simply refused to sign_ 
the nonproliferation and test 
ban agreements. Thus China 
and France?and now ,India?
continue to test in the open 
air. 
The interim limitations on 
offensive rockets imposed by 
the 1972 agreements were tai-
lored to what the U.S. and 
U.S.R. already had planned for 
the five-year period. They left 
a credible balance of U.S. so-
phistication in MIRV's and 
submarine missiles against 
numbers of Soviet rockets and 
mightier warheads. But Mos-
cow moved faster than the 
Americans had estimatedgl 
they could, and now the first

By 
S eeai to The New 
More than 20 Senator s plan to 
seek Senate approval tomor-
row of an amendment urging 
President Ford to cut off mili-
tary aid to Turkey because of 
what they describe as the il-
legal use of United States 
equipment during Cyprus 
crisis. 
In advance of the effort to 
attach a sense-of-the-Congress 
resolution to the pending Ex-
port-Import Bank Act, Mr. Ford 
hasbeen urged by Secretary of 
3160GOffiainger to continue the 
Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100340007-3 
aid program on policy grounds, 
even if the law could be inter-
preted to mean that aid should 
be suspended, State Department 
officials said. 
Mr. Kissinger's position, ar-
rived. at after a long legal and 
policy review at the State De-
partment, is that a cut in aid 
to Turkey might ruin chances 
for persuading -the Turks to 
make compromises in the Cy-
prus dispute, and would raise 
long-term questions for other 
countries about the value of 
accepting United States aid. 
Amendment Not Binding 
The sponsors of the amend-
ment, led by Senators Thomas 
F. Eagleton, Democrat of Mis-
souri, and Adlai E. Stevenson 
3d, Democrat of Illinois, believe 
they will receive overwhelming 
support for their measure, 
which would not be binding on 
President Ford. 
-Moreover, the Senators said 
that the amendment would 
probably be dropped in confer-
ence with the House because 
the House version of the Ex-
port-Import Act does not con-
tain such an amendment and 
would probably be ruled by the 
House as not germane to the 
legislation. 
But the Senators, who repre-
sent a broad spectrum of politi-
cal views, have been angered 
by what they regard as stalling 
tactics by the State Department 
in refusing . to acknowledge 
publicly legal questions in-
volved in the continuing aid 
to Turkey. 
They are seeking the vote as 
an expression of their concern, 
a Senate aide said. 
The dispute stems from the 
military action by the Turkish 
forces last mrenth to increase 
the territory they occupy in 
Cyprus, reported now to be 
about 40 per cent of the island. 
Mr. Eagleton, in a statement 
earlier this month, called on 
. Mr. Ford to suspend aid to 
Turkey because sections of 
foreign assistance and military 
sales acts ruled out military 
aid if a country used United 
States-supplied equipment for 
purposes other than those 
specified. He said that Turkey's 
military intervention in Cyprus 
could not be justified. 
U. S. Security Is Key Issue 
State Department lawyers, 
according to department offi-
cials, reported after long analy-
sis of the laws, that the mili-
tary aid could be continued if 
the President ?used a waiver 
authority, and asserted that 
such aid was in the national 
security interests of the United 
States. 
But Mr. Kissinger, after read-
ing the opinions, decided that 
the broad policy intention of 
foreign aid was to strengthen 
United States security and that 
any decision now on the aid 
issue would be a setback to 
efforts for Cyprus peace talks. 
If the United States an-
nounced that such aid was in 
the national interest, this would 
only further infuriate the 
Greeks, Mr. Kissinger believes. 
if it cut the aid, the Turks 
would be angered. 
A policy of saying nothing 
was decided upon.

NATIONAL REVIEW 
13 SEPT 1974 
IFN ROUTE to the airport, to 
/ cover the arrival of left wing 
firebrand Andreas Papandreou, son of 
the former prime minister George Pap-
andreou, I watched a mob of young 
men burn an American-built car despite 
the protests of its owner, a Greek. This 
was just one of many such anti-Ameri-
can acts in the fortnight following the 
Cyprus fighting. A sampling: Item. The 
beating of three Sudanese, who had 
been taken for American Negroes. The 
left wing paper Athinaiki, reporting the 
incident, said the people were right to 
beat up "anyone resembling an Ameri-
can." Item. Dave Tonge, the BBC's 
man in Greece, thrusting a mike into 
a crowd of rampaging Papandreou 
youths and urging them to yell "Kis-
singer murderer" for the audience back 
in Britain. Item. Stories in the leftist 
press urging taxi drivers not to pick up 
Americans, instructing the state-con-
trolled radio no't to play American 
music, inciting mobs to destroy Ameri-
can property, attack American depend-
ents. Item. Avgi, the Communist daily, 
saying flat otit that former strongmen 
George Papadopoulos and Demetrios 
Ioannidis were paid agents of the CIA 
and that Kissinger personally ordered 
Ioannidis to kill Makarios. Item. On 
the day after the murder of U.S. Am-
bassador Rodger Davies in Nicosia, 
Apogevmatini, the largest afternoon 
paper in Athens, reporting that a U.S. 
Marine guard had caused the riot and 
subsequent death of the Ambassador 
by 'provoking the crowd with taunts 
and finally by shooting at it." 
Now the case of Apogevmatini is 
particularly interesting, and illustrative 
of the Greek press. Until very recently 
it was very pro-American; until July 
23 it was an ardent supporter of the 
military regime. The flipflop came over-
night. One day it was extolling the 
Americans, the next it was explaining 
in great detail how Henry Kissinger 
had plotted to start a war between the 
two communities on Cyprus in order to 
effect a partition of the island that 
would net the U.S. ? two bases on 
Cyprus, one on the Turkish and one 
on the Greek side. 
The wave of anti-Americanism 
fanned by the domestic press was made 
easier by something we Greeks. call 
filotitno. The closest English word to 
fi/otimo is pride, but the word means 
more. It can be used in Greek to mean 
pride in a job well done, but also when 
one is lying in order to save face.

LETTER FROM ATHENS 
? 
The Anti-American Campaign 
TAKI THEODORACOPULOS. 
On the surface there was little for 
the Greeks to be ashamed of in the 
conduct of the Greek Cypriots, 
who defended themselves courageously 
against overwhelming odds: they were 
fighting off Phantom jets and tanks 
with World War II?vintage rifles. 
Rather than swallow this defeat and 
explain the failure of the government 
to aid the Cypriots, all sorts of alter-
native explanations were advanced: the 
U.S. Sixth Fleet prevented Greek troop-
ships from leaving for Cyprus; Greece 
was told she would have to hilt both 
Turkey and the United States if she 
moved to help the Cypriots; Henry 
Kissinger is a murderer; etc. 
And to make the story even more 
persuasive and the U.S. even more 
villainous, it turned out suddenly that 
it was. the Americans, not the junta 
that had kept the brave people of 
Greece captive for seven long years 
when, in fact?except for certain ele-
ments among the bourgeoisie and the 
intellectuals?there had been little or 
no overt resistance to the Colonels. 
The government of Constantine 
Karamanlis calls itself a government 
of national salvation and encompasses 
all political factions except the Com-
munists and, at least at this writing, 
Andreas Papandreou himself, although 
five members of his party are in the 
cabinet. Papandreou, who rushed back 
to Greece from Canada where he had 
been teaching in a university for some 
years, has failed to give his followers 
direction. He has concentrated his 
vitriol in attacks on the Karamanlis 
government as a puppet of the United 
States,. CIA, NATO, imperialism, Kiss-
inger, whatever. But he has offered the 
country no alternative. Despite his vac-
illation, Papandreou is believed to have 
the support of about 10 per cent of the 
population, mainly because of his 
father's name. The late George Pap-
andreou, head of the Center Union 
Party, was a great orator, a consum-
mate politician, a demagogue. 
Caught in the virulent anti-Ameri-
canism that Papandreou and everyone 
else is exploiting, has been U.S. Am 
bassador to Athens Henry Tasca, wh 
was recalled a week ago: Tasca denies 
published stories that he had worked 
to bolster the regimes first of the 
colonels and then of the generals, and. 
says he has the, cables to prove it. 
"When history is written," he told me, 
"I will be exonerated from the charges 
against me." If he was such a supporter 
of the military, he asks, how come that 
on the day that General Ioannidis 
stepped down five dissideat- politicians, 
including Evangelos Averoff, the de-
fense minister, called on him to con-
gratulate him for his efforts in behalf 
of Greek freedom? Averoff, incidental-
ly, says there is no truth in the reports 
that the ouster of Archbishop Makarios 
was engineered by the United States. 
Ioannidis decided on that step alone, 
he says, and when the Americans found , 
out what he was up to, they did their 
best to dissuade him. 
THE DANGER now is that the Com-
munists and the leftists may try to 
move out the street mobs against the 
Karamanlis government. Karamanlis 
himself, as wise as he is Courageous, is 
trying not to be stampeded. He has 
stood up against pressures to go to war 
with Turkey... He has promised elec-
tions within two to six months. He. has 
managed to dismantle most of the in-
frastructure of. the military government, 
quietly and efficiently. He seems ready 
to negotiate with Turkey not only over 
Cyprus but also over the disputed 
Aegean oil rights. Biut in order to take 
the steam out of the mounting cam-
paign against America and NATO he 
took Greece out of the NATO alliance. 
The American bases ?in Greece re-
main in danger as Karamanlis?the 
only leader capable of neutralizing the 
Communists?is jockeyed by popular 
outcry into anti-American positions. 0

NEW YORK TIMES

Democracy in Trouble 
By James Reston 
DUBLIN?A political journey across 
Western Europe these days is a de-
pressing and expensive business. Infla-
tion has produced doubt and anxiety 
about the institutions of liberal democ-
racy. Not since World War II have the 
free nations been so dependent on one 
another?so much at the mercy of 
events beyond their borders?or at the 
same .time so stubbornly nationalistic 
and preoccupied with their own in-
ternal struggles. 
Ireland is only the most 'dramatic 
and tragic symbol of this narrow and 
separatist mood. Geographically and 
economically, it is bound, north and 
south, and linked to Britain and 
Europe, but it is also separated by his-
tory and religion. And the crowning 
paradox: It is engaged in a religious 
war among unbelievers, tyrannized by 
a minority of extremists on both sides. 
Two Powerful but contradictory 
forces seem to be in conflict in Europe 
today. Its old empires are gone. Sepa-
rated one nation from another, it is 
weak. Divided within each nation, it ia 
weaker still. But united, it has the 
people, brains, and resources to stand 
in the forefront of the corning age 
alongside the United States, the Soviet 
Union and the emerging power of 
China and Latin America. 
This, hbwever, is not the way 
Europe is going today. Looking from 
west to east, Ireland is hating the 
British Army in Ulster, but fearing 
that the withdrawal of that army for 
financial reasons in London, might 
lead to a disastrous civil War. 
Portugal is finally abolishing her 
African empire, but she is run by a 
weak and distracted government and 
confronted by a well organized Com-
munist party. 
Spain is also trying to make the 
transition from the authoritarian gov-
ernment of General Francisco Franco 
to a monarchy?also opposed by a 
strong Communist party, which has 
kept its organization and discipline 
ever since the Civil War of the Thir-
ties. 
?France, almost by accident and the 
shrewdness of Valery Giscard d'Es-
taing, just missed a popular front gov-
ernment of Socialists and Communists 
under Francois Mitterrand, but it will 
take all of Mr. Giscrd d'Estaing's 
intelligence and style to establish the 
peaceful revolution of reform he has 
proclaimed. 
Italy is broke and in such a political 
tangle that even political leaders in 
Germany and France now suggest that 
maybe a coalition government in 
Rome, including the Communists, 
might not be a bad idea. 
Greece has made such a mess of 
things that she has come to the Verge 
DUBLIN 
of war with Turkey over Cyprus, and, 
like France, she has pulled her troops 
out of the NATO alliance. 
Meanwhile, Marshal Tito in Yugo-
slavia, the stabilizing influence ?be-
tween East and West in the Balkans, 
is coming to the end of his days. The 
last of the old generation of World 
War II leaders?Mao Tse-tung and 
Chou En-lai in China, Franco in 
Spain, Chaing Kai-shek in Taiwan,, 
.Haile Selassie in Ethiopia?are all on 
their way out. 
Accordingly, the question is what 
the new leaders of the world?Presi-
dent Ford in Washington, President 
Giscard d'Estaing in Paris, Chancellor? 
Schmidt in Bonn, Premier Tanaka in 
Japan, and Prime Minister Wilson or. 
Edward Heath in Britain?will do ? 
about this critical transitional period 
in world history. 
For the moment, they are doing very 
little about it. Like the Irish, they are 
preoccupied with the narrow and im-
mediate political and economic prob-
lems at home, and the more they try 
to solve world problems by national 
political tactics, the deeper they get 
into trouble. 7. 
Fortunately, in Europe there is an-
other force at work in the universities, 
in the newspapers and particularly 
among the rising young generation. 
The teachers, the reporters and the 
students are more mobile now than 
ever before. They see a different com-
ing age. They talk not about separa-
tion of the nations and generations 
but about integration. 
Even some politicians in Europe are 
beginning to think beyond the divi-
sions of the present to the possibility 
of unity in the future. Mr. Giscard 
d'Estaing in France and Mr. Schmidt 
in Germany are searching for new 
answers to new economic and political. 
problems. The Republic of Ireland, for - 
example, has a brilliant young foreign 
secretary, Garret Fitzgerald, who is 
risking his political position by argu-
ing publicly for a unified Ireland. . 
"I believe the tithe has come," he 
wrote, "for all Irish politicians who 
genuinely believe in a united Ireland, 
so organized that people from both 
communities will feel equally' at home 
within it, to speak out and to lead the 
people of Ireland towards this goal. 
We may find that some of our people 
reject this lead, and that in the process 
? existing political structures become 
cracked or even shattered; this is the 
price -we shall have to pay if called 
upon to do so." 
In the short run the ctutlook in Eu-
rope is bleak, but there is a rising new 
generation and it is beginning to em-
phasize not separation but integration.

hen Italy's 
Communists 
ule, They 
o It Right 
BY PAW. HOFMANN 
BOLOGNA?The Italian Communist party, which 
has renewed its effort to become part of the national 
governing coalition, could produce substantial evi-
dence that when it gets a Mandate it knows what-to 
do with it. This ancient city is the center of the 
region called Emilia-Romagna, and the elected Com-
munist officials who run both city and region do it 
more efficiently and less corruptly than officials in 
most of the rest of the nation. 
Bologna was extolled as "la Fascistissima" (the 
Most Fascist) by Mussolini, who was born in the 
nearby Romagna area. But since the collapse of 
Fascism at the end of World War II, Bologna has had 
Communist mayors. 
Emilia-Romagna is one oi Italy's 20 units of lim-
ited selfgovernment. With a population of I.5-million, 
Emilia-Romagna is the largest Communist-run terri-
tory in Europe outside the Soviet bloc. Many of its 
inhabitants and other Italians have the impression 
today that the "Red Region" is on its way to becom-
ing a state within the state. 
This is clue in part to continuous close cooperation 
between the local Communist party apparatus and 
the new regional authorities. Emilia-Romagna seems 
also to be developing its own foreign policy, sending 
delegations to Socialist countries and playing host to 
prominent leftwingers from all over the world. 
A Curb on Immigration ' 
Bologna itself has g population of fewer .than 
600,000. The municipal 'authorities are discouraging 
immigration because they think further growth would 
impair the quality of its life. The historic center of 
Bologna, with its archways and well:restored palaces 
and churches, is a model of urban upkeep. The streets 
are better swept and the transit system works better 
than those of most Italian cities. 
Bologna's citizens can get the many certificates 
that Italian bureaucracy recittires from a computer-
ized system at some handy 'Little City Hall." The 
leftwing city fathers see to it that new zoning regu-
lations and other community affairs are discussed 
by the people in neighborhood meetings, as if to say, 
see how democratic we are? 
In these grassroot consultations, Communist of-
ficials usually show great competence and a degre 
of flexibility. They yield on local issues, like neigh-
borhood renewal whenever they sense they have a 
majority against them. 
While Bologna looks outwardly well-scrubbed, it 
has also been remarkably free so .far of the city hall 
scandals that occur in other Italian centers. Critics 
of the local government blame it for packing the city 
and regional administrations with Communist party 
members, and for wasting funds on prestige proj-
ects. None of Italy's 19 other regions publishes so 
much self-congratulatory literature as does Erniaa-
.Romagna. 
Industrialists, business owners and. other well-
heeled Bolognesi have long learned that it pays to 
maintain good relations with the Communist rulers,

Newsday Special Correspondent 
t Vientiane, Laos?The onset of peace in Laos has 
not ended Central Intelligence Agency .involvement 
inkhis country's internal affairs. 
? After running a so-called secret war for nearly .a 
deade, CIA personnel have turned to a new field 
here: civic action. They. are using programs of the 
U.S. Agency for International Development as a 
coier for their covert operations. An influx of CIA 
fufads earlier this year, according to reliable sources, 
wris responsible for the implementation of several ma-
jot civic programs in northern Laos, where Moo hill 
tribesmen *are. concentrated. 
tri Those tribesmen formed the bulk of a lough guer, 
rah army that was paid, trained, .supplied and ad-. 
vised by CIA paramilitary personnel. By sponsoring 
civic action programs for Meos, the agency retains in-
fltience over an important segment of the populace in 
a Strategic area of Laos. 
The tribeSmen's leader. is .Gen. Vang Pao, Vol110' 
reaps substantial financial benefits from the civic pro-
grams. With CIA assistance; the flamboyant Gen. 
Vang Pao has become chicken farmer yang Pao; the 
transformation took place at Long Cheng, . the Mao 
leader's long-time base and the . former CIA field 
headquarters. ? ? 
:Once dominated by the rattle of gunfire and the 
roar of American aircraft, Long Cheng now is noisy 
with the sound of cackling chickens. An initial CIA 
expenditure of more than $25,000 started operations.? 
on; Yang Pao's poultry farm, where -some 2;500 chick-
ens are housed and raised -prior -to being sold in a 
nearby Market serving several thousand Meos. 
Sources dose to the project estimate that -Vang 
Pao makes about $1,000 monthly profit from hi.s. 
chicken sales (the average per Capita income in Laos 
is about $60 a year). His customers also benefit, how-
ever, because CIA-sponsored chickens are sold at be-
law-normal rates.' 
Aside from chicken-raising, other CIA-funded 
civic projects in Laos include a cattle breeding pro-
gram and the establishment of farm supply centers 
that provide agricultural' commodities for' Moo farm-
ers at reduced' price. The ? projects' total costs, accord-
ing to knowledgeable sourceS, have exceeded $100,-
000. 
. *The projects are administered by the Agricultural 
Development Organization, nominally under Laotian 
.government control but dependent upon American 
funds. When U.S. budgetary cutbacks threatened to, 
eliminate or curtail ADO operations, sources report, 
an infusion of CIA money in February put the, orga-
nization back in business. 
? 
Six American agricultural experts presently super-
tvi 
utse 
vise ADO projects; all six reportedly are' genuine civic 
action workers, not CIA operatives., "These men are 
my employes in the purest sense," said Charles 
Mann, 'director of USAID in Laos. "They have no 
other professional concerns." When asked about the 
source of ADO's funds, however, Mann replied, "no , 
corrunent.", ? 
The American' agricultural experts prefer to ig-
nore the source of their. programs' funds. "I'm not 
happy about where- that money comes 'from," one.: 
said, "but I am concerned, with civic development, 
and I care a great deal about the Meos. The source of 
our funds, and the motives behind -them, mean less. 
to me than what we are doing for these people." 
Another American worker, close to Yang Pao, also 
is willing -to overlook the substantial prcrfits compiled 
by the Moo chieftain; who runs' northern Laos like 
a feudal lord.. 
"Art, first this bothered. me," he said, "but after a 
while you come to realize that this is the system?and 
it works. Vang Pao can be called a dictator, but he is 
basically a benevolent one, and his profits are not ex-
cessive by local standards." 
Less willing to overlook CIA involvement 'in Laos, 
however, is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, (D-Mass.), 
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on refugees. 
Long opposed to the agency's- use of humanitarian 
programs OS a "cover," Kennedie recently declared 
that the CIA's present effort 'raises.. troubling .ques-
tions over, the course of U.S.' policy toward Leos." 
He said: "Despite our c.ountry'.s general 
support for the, cease-fire-agreement, and the new gov-
ernment, several indiotators suggest that the intent of 
some .of .our remaining presence in Laos can only help 
?to perpetuate old relationships and the division of . 
that country." ? 
There were 216 Al-her:can military men serving in 
Laos as Army and Air Fore," attaches at the time of 
the osnsa-fire in February, 1973. Now there report-
edly arc about 30: The U.S. has cut back becaire the

"If the government would

woman, who was holding her

coast. Her home is, now in

go back. 
"If we went back, the gov-

antee us that there wouldn't 
be any arrests and that we 
wouldn't be disturbed by gov-
ernment soldiers," said the 
first woman. ? ? 
"No more shooting at us and 
capturing us," put in a man. 
Asked if they meant they 
didn't care whether they lived 
under government or Commu-
nist ? control, the group of 
about 50 refugees gathered 
around said, "Right, right," 
they just wanted to go home. 
An old man recalled how, 
long ago, they left home. "The 
Americans used helicopters, 
and they forced us on hoard," 
he said. "We went with just, 
our bare hands, couldn't carry; 
any kind of property with us." 
The people said they had 
been flown to the refugee 
camp where they still live in ;

has been heavy there for the 
past month as Communist 
forces press down to the coast 
from ? their mountain base 
areas. 
. For the first year or so, the 
.people said, they had U.S. and 
government assistance. But 
that stopped and they had to 
support themselves by buying 
tea from mountain tribesmen 
and selling it in city markets. 
The current fighting has 
made this impossible, and now 
they said they would like to go 
home, where they could farm. 
There were no government 
officials around during the in-. 
terview, which may account 
I for the unusual candor. Usu-
ally officials are present and 
one can never be sure how 
much refugees' anti-Commu-
nist statements are affected 
by this presence. In some 
cases people voice genuine 
anti-Communist sentiments 
even when officials are not 
present. 
Another example of people 
wanting to return to areas not 
not controlled by the govern-
ment is the village of Heap-
hung, near the beach three 
:miles southwest of Danang. 
"There are a thousand veo-
!pie in my village and 90 per 
. cent of them are pro-Viet-
, cong," said the young village 
chief dejectedly. 
He was interviewed in Dan-
ang, where he lives because it 
is too insecure in the village 
for him to spend nights there. 
He goes to the "village office 
every other .day, sharing the? 
dangerous job with other vil-
lage officials who also live in 
IDanang. 
The chief, Nguyen Mui, 29, 
said he was dejected because 
; one-day last month, 80 fami-
lies -in the village tore down 
their houses and carted them 
.to rebuild in a nearby Viet-

said, that they would prefer .to

CHRISTIAN CTENCE MONITOR 
10 Sentember 1974 - 
Conservative priests blast 
c.rruption in Thieu regime 
. By Daniel Sonitierland 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Saigon 
A number of conservative Roman 
Catholic priests have strongly at-. 
tacked President 'rhieu's government 
lately for massive corruption among 
officials and military men. 
They contend that unless Mr. Thieu 
reforms his government, he doesn't 
stand a chance *against the Commu-
nists. 
Three hundred priests, many of 
them refugees from the Communist 
? North, have banded together to make 
sure that their voices are heard. A few 
months ago, they decided to go public 
and issue a manifesto "against con 
ruption, injustice, and social deca-
dence." 
The priests claim to have the 
? support of some of South Vietnam's 
Roman Catholic bishops, but decline 
to reveal the names of any high-level 
supporters in the Catholic hierarchy. 
Catholics make up only about 10 
percent of South Vietnam's popu-
lation but they wield influence far out 
of proportion to their numbers. Presi-
dent Thieu is a...Catholic by con-
version. 
In their manifesto, the dissident 
priests declared that power and lead-
ership in South Vietnam are "for the 
' most part . . . based on corruption. 
"Under the protection of influential 
Officials, narcotics dealers, gang-
sters, gamblers, prostitutes, and 
? smugglers have become a true men-
ace to a society, plagued with purse-
snatching, fraud, rape, and other 
. unthinkable crimes," said the mani-
festo. "Few people feel . themselves 
safe." 
Corruption is not the priests' only 
theme. They have also been protest-
ing against restrictions on the free-
dom of speech in South Vietnam. In 
their manifesto, they point out that 
under the Thieu government "help-
-:less citizens may be accused of 
assisting or conniving with the Corn-
:munists, while others who utter any 
, unpleasant truth about the adminis-
tration may be charged with 'weak-
ening the fighting spirit of the armed 
,forces.' " 
7 None of the accusations is particu-
lary new. Corruption and injustice 
have been the targets of countless 
protesters throughout the long Viet-
nam war. But it is unusual for so 
many conservative priests to be going 
on the attack in such a vocal way. 
Recently two of the leaders among 
the group of 300 issued a statement in 
which they referred to the Thieu 
government as an "oppressive and 
traitorous regime." These were 
strong words indeed. 
_ The two priests urged the Catholic 
leadership in South Vietnam to dis-
? associate itself from the Thieu gov-
ernment and to stop accepting favors 
from the government. 
. The chief motivation of the 300 
priests seems to be, quite simply, fear 
of a Communist take-over. Left-lean-
ing Vietnamese priests often say that. 
a coalition government which In.
eludes the Communists .but excludes . 
President Thieu is the only solution ? 
for South Vietnam. But the conserva-
tive priests do not advocate that kind 
of compromise ? not yet anyway. 
Many remain as hawkish as they ever 
were. But they fear that corruption 
will sabotage the chances of any anti- ? 
Communist regime surviving in South 
Vietnam. ? - 
Regimes compared 
"It was corruption that led to the 
downfall of the Chiang Kai-shek gov-
ernment in China," said one of the 
priests who signed the manifesto. 
The priest, who happens to be an 
ailmirer of the late President Ngo 
Dinh Diem, declared that corruption 
now is "100 times worse" than it was 
under the Diem regime. 
The priest asked that his name not 
be published, because he feared retal-
iation. from the Thieu government. 
But at the same time he said that he 
doubted Mr. Thieu would take strong 
action against any of the 300 priests 
who signed the manifesto. 
"I do not think that Thieu would 
dare act like President Park Chung 
Hee [of Korea]," the priest said, 
referring to the arrests of Christian 
dissidents in South Korea. 
"Thieu is not strong like Park," he 
said. Mr. Thieu has given little in-
dication so far of what his attitude is 
toward the priests who are demand-
ing an end to corruption. 
But he is not likely to be happy with . 
their criticism because, as one Viet- , 
namese Catholic put it: "If the left-
wing priests talk about corruption, 
Thieu can Always say that their 
criticism is exaggerated. But what 
does he say when the right-wing 
priests start talking about it?"

'THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 1974 
Did the Chilean Press Need CIA Help? 
By EVERETT C. MARTIN 
In his press conference this week Presi-
dent Ford was asked about recent disclo-
sures that the Central Intelligence Agency 
was authorized to spend some 59 million to 
"destabilize" the government of Chile's 
:Marxist  President Salvador Allende. The 
President admitted that the CIA gave sup-
poi, presumably in the form of money, to 
opposition news media and political parties. 
? Specifically, the President said: "In a 
period of time, three or four years ago, 
there was an effort being made by the Al-
lende government to destroy opposition 
news media, both the writing press as well 
as the electronic press. And to destroy op-
position political parties. 
"And the effort that was made in this 
case was to help and assist the preserva-
tion of opposition newspapers and elec-
tronic media and to preserve opposition 
political parties." ' 
, He concluded: "I think this is in the best 
interest of the people of Chile and certainly 
in our best interest." 
This interference in the internal affairs 
of another nation is a staggering admission 
for the President to make, and his conclu-
sion is, at the very best, questionable. , 
There isn't any doubt, however, that the 
opposition news media had been pushed to 
the wall by the Marxists. The President's 
statement gives part of the explanation of 
how it managed to survive at all. 
, Except for a very few cases, Chile's 
news media have always been wildly parti-
san in political matters. News stories gen-
? erally were polemics and thoroughly unre-
liable as sources of balanced, accurate in-
formation. To read the government and op-
position press on any given day was like 
reading about events in two different coun-
tries. The result was that most readers 
bought the paper that said what they 
wanted to hear; there was none of the 
cross-fertilization of ideas that might take 
the heat out of an issue. 
Where opposition newspapers and mag-
azines were concerned, the Allende forces 
' did very little overtly to curtail their right 
to print what they wanted. But the evi-
dence indicates a clear attempt to strangle, 
them economically by cutting off their rev-
enue. 
The Chilean government and state-
owned industries were the largest single 
group of advertisers. It wasn't surprising 
in such a polarized situation that they 
stopped advertising in opposition media. 
As the Marxists through one means or an-
other took control of the banks and private 
industry, government hold over advertis-
ing became overwhelming. The, wor'sening 
economic situation and scarcities exacer-
bated the situation until publications ap-
peared with virtually no visible means of 
support. 
Then there was the Marxist attempt to. 
take over the paper company, known fa-, 
miliarly as the Papelera, that -supplied 
65% of the newsprint. Failing in an effort 
'to buy the firm's shares and to agitate the 
61,000 workers to?seize the plants, the gov-
ernment tried to force it into bankruptcy, 
which means automatic government con-
trol. Denied anything but insignificant 
price increases at a time when costs were 
tripling, Papelera was soon losing thou-
sands of dollars a day. Only 'when chaos 
threatened as crowds took to the streets 
supporting the company did the govern-
ment back off in a moment of political 
compromise. 
Newspapers in smaller towns came 
under more direct attack than the big dai-
lies of Santiago. An editor's life was 
threatened in Rancagua by mobs of leftists, 
and workers seized control of papers in 
other cities. In Talca after workers seized 
the paper, the supreme court ruled it was 
Illegal; but the government refused to obey 
the court order to end the occupation. "It's 
not 'socially possible to obey the court," a 
Socialist Party member reasoned at the 
time. 
But newspapers actually reach rela-
tively few people in Chile. Much more im-
portant as a mass media is the radio, and 
closures of radio stations by the Allende 
government got to be a common occur-
rence. 
Once a Santiago station was closed be-
cause it reported that two miners were 
shot tO?death during a copper strike. The 
report was slightly wrong. Only one miner 
died; the other was critically wounded. 
For this, the government declared the sta-
tion had endangered national security. The 
supreme court again ordered the station 
reopened; but the government minister in-
volved refused. The court then ordered his 
arrest, and the Marxists countered with a 
threat to start impeachment proceedings 
against the entire court for upholding bour-
geois laws against the will of the people. 
Government television and radio sta-
tions, on the other hand, once caused riot-
ing in the streets with a false report that 
rightwing forces were about to attack the 
army. This abuse went unpunished. 
Television was another area where the 
? government's actions were overt. ' 
The University of Chile had a station in 
Santiago that was staffed entirely with ex-
treme leftists broadcasting pure Marxist 
propaganda. The student body voted over-
whelmingly in a referendum to expell the 
leftists and Change to. a neutral format; 
but when the schoo"s administration, 
148 
which was bound by law to obey the refer- ? 
endum, tried to take control, the leftists re-
jected them by force. 
The police wouldn't act, and President , 
Allende ordered university officials to con-
tinue the Marxists on the payroll. Then the 
school tried to set up a second station, but 
the police raided it and smashed the equip-
ment. 
The Catholic University ran into similar 
repression when it tried to set up a second 
,channel to serve the southern city of Con-
cepcion with a format that attempted to be 
non-partisan. 
At first the government claimed that 
the station's signal would interfere with 
radio reception at the Concepcion airport, 
which was patently 'not the case. The. uni-
versity -defiantly went ahead with its 
plans; so the government set up jamming 
equipment to interrupt its programs. In, 
the ensuing controversy, the priest who 
ran the university's television network was 
even held in jail for a short period. 
It was genuinely a question how long 
some elements of Chile's opposition media 
could hold out as tha pressure against it 
mounted near the end of the Allende ad-
ministration. It might be easy to rational-
ize why the CIA thought it should step in. 
with support money. It is something that 
no doubt we shall eventually learn we are 
doing in other countries. But does that jus-
tify such intervention in Chile's internal af-
fairs? 
And was it even necessary?' 
The opposition forces demonstrated 
time and again through various by-elec-
tions and the 1973 congressional elections 
that they were the majority. It seems a 
kind of arrogance for Washington planners 
to think that the Chilean majority would 
let its protesting voice disappear entirely 
from print. and from the airwaves even if 
established, publication's and stations col-
lapsed by the dozens., 
One might also- ask where is the 'CIA's 
concern for an opposition press in Chile 
now that the military junta which deposed 
the Allende government has effectively si-
lenced all opposition? , 
Fortunately, no disclosures so far indi-
cate that the U.S. government was in-
volved in the actual coup against the Al-
lende government, but the records should 
be laid bare to make sure. 
In the Chilean case, President .Allende's 
own actions in subverting the democracy, 
in smuggling arms from Cuba to set up a 
clandestine army and in wrecking the coun-
try's economy were more than adequate to 
"destabilize" his government. 
But what if it had turned out differ-
ently? What if he hadn't done those self-de-
structive things and finally through pro-
gressive programs had earned the alle-
gianea of a majority of Chileans? How 
then could President Ford claim that the

THE ECONOMIST SEPTEMBER 14, 1974 
The Pinochet way 
Was the Chile disaster inevitable? Probably. Is it 
permanent? Not necessarily' 
What has happened in Chile since Salvador Allende was 
overthrown a year ago this week is a lesson in the way 
soldiers who believe they are the saviours of their country 
find themselves becoming dictators. President Pinochet 
has promised to release some political detainees, and the 
"state of internal war" was lifted on Wednesday, but there 
are few guarantees of political freedom under the stern 
provisions of the state of siege that is still being enforced 
in Chile. The political parties have been banned or sus-
pended; the press?once the most outspoken in Latin 
America?is muzzled by military censors; and there are 
few indications that the junta has any thought of restoring 
the parliamentary system in a form western democrats 
would recognise. 
Some of the officers who stand behind President Pino-
chet maintain that censorship, arbitrary detention, trial 
by court martial and the rest of the paraphernalia of re-
pression were necessary because the country was in a state 
of civil war. But for a powerful faction within the junta the 
argument runs deeper: the country must be "cleansed" 
of old-style politics so that a new, and permanent, authori-
tarian system can emerge. These men are not like Turkey's 
generals in 1960. They do not see their job as the laying 
down of neW political rules so that a multi-party system 
can take over again from them later on. They appear to be 
working towards a no-party system. 
The repression in Chile is documented in a new 80-page 
report published by Amnesty International this week. 
Some of its evidence is dubious?including a Newsweek 
report published in October last year that was later shown 
to be fallacious, and a number of quotations from anony-
mous foreigners now outside Chile. But the rest of the re-
port is one of Amnesty's more credible documents, and 
builds up a damaging case for the junta to Answer. The 
problem is not so much the abuse of law as the absence of 
law. There is no appeal against the verdict of military tri-
bunals, no respect for habeas corpus, and the lack of cen-
tral control makes it possible for provincial garrisons or 
military intelligence services to deal with opponents as they 
see fit without consulting a higher authority. The result, 
in the first month after the coup, was a series of prisoners 
shot "while trying to escape" or just disappearing without 
trace. Amnesty suggests a figure of 7,000 for the number 
of political prisoners today; as many people may have 
died. It is also fairly plain that the use of torture has been 
widespread, although (as Amnesty concedes) the junta 
now seems to be trying to stop it. Neither the torture nor 
the "unofficial" executions can be justified even if one 
accepts the junta's thesis that the left in Chile is secretly 
planning a violent uprising?and since there has not been 
a single guerrilla incident of any importance since the 
immediate aftermath of the coup, that is no longer easy to 
swallow. 
These things gave the British Government its reason

despised by the entire demo-
for instructing Britain's ambassador in Chile not to attend 
the junta's anniversary celebrations on Wednesday, even 
though that gesture would have looked a lot more plausible 
if British ambassadors did not turn up at similar occasions 
when other governments congratulate themselves on far 
bloodier conquests of power. But historians, as distinct 
from politicians out to score a point, will still want to make 
two observations about what has happened in Chile. 
The first is that it was the marxist left, not the armed 
forces, that broke down Chile's democratic institutions. 
Before Allende was overthrown he had been censured by a 
vote of almost two to one in the lower house of Chile's 
parliament for violating the country's constitution. It was 
Allende's own left-wing supporters who had set up para-
military groups and drawn up their plans, almost certainly 
with his knowledge, to seize total power. The junta is 
caught up in a series of events that was begun by the 
Allende regime. That cannot excuse its excesses, but it does 
help to explain them. The alternative to -the Pinochet 
regime was not democracy for Chile: it was the imposition 
of a totalitarianism of the left. 
The surviving corners of freedom 
The other point is about what sort of government it is that 
now runs Chile. Its enemies like to call it a totalitarian 
regime, but it is not. The word totalitarian was coined to 
apply to those governments?most notably the communist 
ones?which set out to bring almost every aspect of life 
under the control of the ruling party. The junta in Chile is 
not quite like that. Its government is an authoritarian one, 
and a very tough specimen of the breed, but it has not 
sought to impose its ideas on the totality -of public life. 
Politics have been abolished, but men can still pursue 
their economic activities with a certain degree of inde-
pendence; there remains a good deal of freedom in the 
world of culture and religion; people still have the right to 
travel in and out of the country. These things matter, be-
cause they mean that some centres of power and influence 
and independent opinion can still. exist outside the reach of 
the government's arm. Such a. country is not a totali-
tarian one, because the rudiments of pluralism survive. 
The distinction is important for Chile. The corners or 
freedom that can still be found even within an authoritarian 
state give men the possibility to recover the other freedoms 
they have lost. These fragments of freedom tend to expand 
as the regime gains more confidence in itself; there is less 
intrusion into people's lives in Spain today than there was 
20 years ago?or than there is in Chile now. There is more 
hope of recovering political freedom than there is in a 
totalitarian regime where one centre of power commands 
everything. The Chileans are not one of the world's more 
repressible peoples. Those members of the present junta 
who believe they can stamp their ideas on Chile forever will 
discover that.
