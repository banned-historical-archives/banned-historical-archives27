 China: Agreeing ~o Disagree
 [As the People's Republic celeb iteb its 25th
 year, China's leaders were looking backward as
 well as forward. Much of the media debate of the
 current political campaign has been conducted
 using historical analogy, particularly the failure of
 progressive forces to hold sway after the death of
 the  first  Chin  emperor.  The  current  pre-
 occupation is, of course, over the succession to
 the Mao "dynasty," and this concern was clearly
 evident in National Day events, which attempted
 to project an image of unity and stability.
 All active Politburo members except Mao
 made public appearances, and Premier Chou left
 the hospital briefly to make a ringing address to
 over 4,000 cheering celebrants. The enthusiastic
 reception accorded Chou highlights the sense of
 relief obviously felt by most Chinese as a result of
 the  apparent  improvement  in  the  Premier's
 health. But even the rehabilitation of a number of
 government bureaucrats, military men, and pro-
 vincial leaders could not dispel the underlying
 sense of unease, as if the final act of a drama was
 being played out with the audience still in doubt
 as to the ending. A joint editorial, broadcast on
 the eve of National Day, set the tone. While
 promising that the campaign to criticize Con-
 fucius would continue   for a long time,'the
 emphasis was on study rather than criticism, and
 the message was unity.
 The appearance list was unusually long and
 complete.  All  government  ministers appeared
 except the public security boss-who may well be
 dead-and the Central Committee list included
 several provincial military leaders who had been
 under heavy attack. Party vice chairman Li Te-
 sheng showed up in his provincial home, although
 it was not possible to determine if he retains all
 his jobs since leaders there were not identified by
 title.  Even the first secretary of Shansi, who
 seemed politically dead after a play written in his
 province was branded a "poisonous weed," was
 on  hand. The continued survival of so many
 leaders makes it difficult to identify any high-
 ranking officials who have fallen as a result of the
 anti-Lin,  anti-Confucius  campaign--now  more
 than a year old-and raises the possibility that any
 purge now will be limited in the face of leadership
 uncertainties precipitated by Chou's illness.
 It is possible that the spirit of compromise
 extends to the long-delayed meeting of the Na-
 tional People's Congress, which may be in train
 again after a number of false starts. The congress
 would approve a new state constitution and a
 slate of government ministers, and could provide
 a forum to announce appointments to several
 vacant military leadership posts. The joint edi-
 torial failed to mention the NPC, however, which
 is probably a negative sign.
 But behind the facade of unity, the maneu-
 vering for position goes on. In the weeks just
 before National Day, Madame Mao was in the
 spotlight. A series of poems praising an ancient
 empress who ruled China for over 20 years after
 her husband died thrust Chiang Ching's succession
 ambitions clearly to the  fore. Typically, this
 initiative did not go unanswered, and after the
 noise  from  the fireworks dies away and the
 clean-up crews finish their tasks, China's modern
 mandarins will resume their efforts to shape the
 new dynastic leadership.

 Argentina: Anti-sub~versi n Laws
 President Peron was able to push a sweeping
 anti-subversion bill through the congress after a
 bitter debate last week, but it aroused suspicion
 among opposition legislators, who charged that its
 vaguely worded provisions could be used to stifle
 democratic freedoms.
 The bill gives the government broad new
 powers, including the right to imprison accom-
 plices of guerrillas, recalcitrant strikers, and news-
 men who report subversive activities. Foreign cor-
 respondents could be vulnerable.  In the past,
 selected newsmen have been invited to secret
 press conferences held by leaders of extremist
 groups.  The government has condemned this
 practice, claiming that it supports the terrorists'
 psychological efforts to undermine government
 authority. Although the interior minister testified
 before congress that the new law would not result
 in any infringement on the news media, the gov-
 ernment is unlikely to back away from its ap-
 parent plan to impose a news blackout on guer-
 rilla and terrorist activities.
 The killing spree went on unabated this
 week, claiming the lives of former Chilean army
 commander General Carlos Prats and his wife.
 Prats had been living quietly in Buenos Aires since
 he resigned from the Allende government last
 year, and the identity of his killers has not been
 established.
 Meanwhile, a string of terrorist attacks on
 Argentine army officers heightened frustration
 among the military, which is still committed to
 operate within the constitutional framework. The
 People's Revolutionary Army recently swore to
 make "indiscriminate reprisals" against the army
 for the "execution" of 14 guerrillas captured last
 month, and this may elicit tougher action from
 the military. Army commander General Anaya,
 for example, has vowed that the army would use
 "all its power" to destroy the terrorists. F
 SECRET
 The army has been generally reluctant to
 become  totally  involved  in  counterterrorism,
 partly out of a desire to shed the unpopular image
 it acquired during the period of military rule from
 1966 to 1973, and partly from an awareness of
 the likely negative political reaction if harsh secu-
 rity measures are taken. Nevertheless, the military
 may find itself with little option except to move
 more forcefully against the widening terrorist of-
 fensive.
 The growing wave of violence is also being
 fostered by right-wing death squads, which are
 stepping  up  action  against  leftist  politicians,
 entertainers, and academicians. The self-styled
 Argentine  Anticommunist      Alliance
 -has 25X1
 taken credit for the killing of at least six persons
 and is adding new victims daily to its "death list."
 Many of those targeted have gone into hiding or
 have left the country.

 CYPRUS: SETTLEMENT  VERSHAD WED
 Diplomatic efforts to move toward a nego-
 tiated settlement of the Cyprus problem were
 overshadowed this week by political develop-
 ments  in  Athens,  Ankara,  and  Nicosia. The
 Karamanlis government in Greece continued to
 move toward the holding of elections, despite
 some faint rumblings in the military. In Ankara,
 the task of forming a new government was given
 to opposition leader Demirel after Prime Minister
 Ecevit failed twice to organize a new coalition. In
 Nicosia, Acting Cypriot President Clerides' threat
 to resign has at least temporarily stalled the talks
 he had been conducting with Turkish Cypriot
 leader Denktash.
 Greek political parties have stepped up their
 activities in anticipation of parliamentary elec-
 tions. These are now scheduled to be held on
 November 17 and will be followed within 45 days
 by a referendum on the future of the monarchy.
 The present government will resign next week and
 will be replaced by a caretaker government under
 Prime Minister Karamanlis.
 A military move against Karamanlis at this
 time would  probably  be unsuccessful, largely
 because the army is not united. Moreover, many
 rightists, including army officers, realize that they
 stand to gain if elections are held before the left
 has been able to organize an effective opposition-
 The feuding Communists have managed to
 pull together a limited program of electoral co-
 operation. The Moscow-backed Greek Communist
 Party  and  the  United  Democratic  Left have
 agreed to coordinate activity, but for the election
 only; a dissident Communist Party faction has
 also worked out a loose arrangement with the
 United Democratic Left.
 The  US         embassy  reports  that Andreas
 Papandreou's  Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement
 has gotten off to a slow start. He is reportedly not
 getting the backing of the liberals of the Center
 Union, but drawing support only from urban
 youth and students.
 Several new political groups have emerged. A
 group of prominent political personalities, all rela-
 tively young and nearly all associated with resist-
 ance to the former junta, have announced the
 formation of a left-of-center movement called
 "New  Political  Forces." Minister of  Industry
 Protopapas has formed a group called the Social-
 ist Democratic Union. On the right, former min-

 Prime Minister                   Karamanlis  is  apparently
 having  problems  getting his New                       Democracy
 Party off the ground. He is trying to attract new
 personalities, particularly  liberals and                  uncom-
 mitted youth. To do this, he will have to drop
 from his candidates list at least 50 former key
 party supporters of his old  National                     Radical
 Union.
 Acting Cypriot President Clerides' threat to
 resign reportedly reflects his concern that Athens'
 ambiguous  position  toward  him--along                      with
 Makarios' machinations and announced intention
 to return to the island-had seriously impaired his
 ability to negotiate with the Turkish Cypriots.
 Moreover, he felt that the situation was making it
 increasingly difficult for him to govern the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is divided along pro-
 and anti-Makarios lines. Clerides' move was appar-
 ently prompted by the acceleration of the cam-
 paign to bring back Makarios, which is led mainly
 by leftist forces but is also favored by other
 groups. Makarios supporters staged a mass rally in
 Limassol on September 29.
 Clerides' well-orchestrated threat to resign
 seemed to be designed to force a clarification of
 his position and to recoup his waning su port. If
 so, it certainly worked
 Should Clerides succeed in securing pledges
 of support from a substantial segment of the
 Greek Cypriot factions, along with a stronger
 public  statement of support  from the Arch-
 bishop--he apparently considers Makarios' initial
 statement inadequate-he would probably con-
 sent to remain in his position.
 Despite his misgivings, Clerides continued his
 discussions with Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash
 on September 30. The two agreed to resume the
 exchange of prisoners, which was suspended last
 week because of a delay in the return to Cyprus
 of Greeks held prisoner in Turkey. Moreover, the
 Turks had been reluctant to free the increasing
 number of Greek Cypriot prisoners who wanted
 to return to their villages in the Turkish-occupied
 sector of the island. The two men reaffirmed in
 their talks that prisoners would be released where
 they wished. Arrangements were also made for
 the return of Greek Cypriots held in Turkey. At
 Clerides' request, however, a date for another
 meeting was not set, apparently because Clerides
 was considering resigning.
 Prime Minister Ecevit of Turkey was the
 political  leader who benefited most from the
 fighting on Cyprus, but he seems to have over-
 played his hand in resigning and trying to force
 new elections. Because Ecevit's party is the only
 one that stands to gain considerably from early
 elections, the other parties have balked at giving
 him the necessary support in parliament on this
 issue.
 The Democratic Party refused to join a coali-
 tion with Ecevit's Republican People's Party be-
 cause the offer was conditioned on an agreement
 to hold elections before the end of the year.
 Ecevit then offered to defer the elections until
 next spring, but he was again rebuffed by the
 Democrats.  As  a  result,  President  Koruturk
 turned to Justice Party leader Demirel to try to
 form a new government.
 Demirel will attempt to form a right-of-
 center coalition that will include the Democrats
 and Ecevit's former coalition partner, the Na-
 tional Salvation Party. Such a coalition will be
 extremely difficult to put together, however, in
 view of the deep personal animosities between
 Demirel and the Democratic Party leaders. The
 Democratic Party was formed in 1970 by dis-
 sident Justice Party members whom Demirel had
 broken with and had expelled from the party.
 Ecevit  believes that  Demirel  will  fail to
 organize a new government and that the President
 will then give him another chance. In this case,
 Ecevit hopes that the Democratic Party will be
 more amenable to joining him in a coalition since
 it will be clear that a rightist coalition cannot be
 formed.

 Arias
 SPAIN: RIGHTISTS SPEAKING OUT
 Qv(p -
 IControversy e  Pri l)e  Minister Arias'
 modest liberalization program is likely to require
 Franco's intervention. At the same time, the
 moderate governmental image that Arias wants to
 project is further threatened by the government's
 decision to let a military court try eight Basques
 charged with a terrorist bombing in Madrid.
 An editorial on September 26 in a prom-
 inent ultra-rightist weekly magazine warned Arias
 that the kind of democracy he has advocated
 could lead to a "field of corpses." The writer
 asserted that rightists wanted nothing to do with
 Arias' policies and could not cooperate with him
 "even in the opposition."
 The warning follows an interview with Arias
 published on September 11 in which the Prime
 Minister stated that he intends to work for
 democratization of the regime as he promised last
 February. Arias said he hoped that a government
 bill on a key provision--establishment of political
 associations-would be ready before the end of
 the year. Rightists oppose this move because they
 fear the associations will become political parties.
 Arias denied that rightist resistance was holding
 back liberalization moves.
 Political observers assumed at the time of
 publication that Arias' interview had advance ap-
 proval from Franco, who had resumed his duties
 as chief of state the week before
 Franco has made no move to disassociate himself
 from Arias' position. Following the right-wing
 attack, moreover, two prominent Madrid dailies
 strongly defended the Prime Minister's policy.
 Arias is evidently prepared to face rightist disap-
 proval  of his program,  but  Franco's attitude
 would  cause  him  to  reconsider.  The  noisy
 demonstrations by rightists in May 1973 protest-
 ing the leniency of the authorities toward ter-
 rorist groups may have been a factor in the cab-
 inet reshuffle the following month when some
 ministers favoring liberalization were dropped.
 The government is concerned about security
 following  the  terror-bombing  in  Madrid  on
 September 13 in which 11 people were killed and
 scores wounded. The bombing was apparently
 aimed at killing security police who frequent the
 area but hit innocent bystanders instead. The
 government's decision to have a military court try
 the eight Basques charged with the bombing may
 create problems for Madrid, if it turns into a
 replay of the trial of 16 Basque terrorists in
 Burgos in 1970. That trial created strains among
 Spanish  moderates  and  conservatives  as  to
 whether  the  convicted  terrorists should  be
 granted leniency, as well as considerable foreign
 criticism of a military court's trying civilians.
 Franco eventually eased the earlier con-
 troversy by permitting the death penalty to be
 invoked but then commuting the sentences. In
 the latest incident, the Spanish press is giving
 heavy coverage to the police investigation and to
 the quick arrest of the eight suspects. They have
 been linked to the Basque Fatherland and Liberty
 group better known as ETA, and to the Spanish
 Communist Party.

 PORTUGAL: LEFTISTS WIN UPPER HAND
 30 - ~5
 Leftist forces emerged on to this week in a
 power struggle that culminated in the replace-
 ment of President Spinola by the armed forces
 chief of staff, General Costa Gomes. In an impres-
 sive display of strength and cohesiveness, the left
 won a clear tactical victory over rightist elements.
 Political tensions remain high, however, and pros-
 pects for an  orderly campaign leading to elec-
 tions next March are considerably reduced.
 The struggle was initiated on September 28
 when the Armed Forces Movement-dominated
 by young, left-leaning officers-forced President
 Spinola to cancel a political rally that had been
 billed as a pro-Spinola demonstration by Portu-
 gal's "silent majority."
 The movement and virtually all left-of-center
 forces regarded the rally as the first step by the
 political  right to regain the upper hand.  For
 several months, Spinola had been engaged in a
 contest for power with the Armed Forces Move-
 ment, though their differences were seldom made
 public. It was clear, however, that the movement
 was impatient with Spinola's generally moderate
 approach to domestic problems and with the
 gradual pace of decolonization that he advocated.
 The final break between Spinola and the left
 came after a truce was announced on September
 29. Young officers in the Armed Forces Move-
 ment then proceeded to press for the resignations
 of three conservative supporters of Spinola on the
 Junta of National Salvation, the seven-man mili-
 tary ruling body over which the President pre-
 sides. After yielding to the ouster of his sup-
 porters, the President was more isolated than over
 and was compelled to resign. In his resignation
 speech, he bitterly denounced "the emergence of
 a generalized climate of anarchy."
 With Spinola gone, the locus of power in
 Portugal now lies with the Armed Forces Move-
 ment,  although  it probably represents only a
 small percentage of the officer corps. The exact
 composition of the movement is uncertain, but it
 appears to include some Communists. In any case,
 the events of the weekend reflected a close coor-
 dination between the movement and the Portu-
 guese Communist Party. Between them, their con-
 trol of the situation was so complete that for all
 practical purposes the country was, and is, in
 their hands. The movement's decisions will be
 implemented  by an administration headed by
 Prime Minister Goncalves.
 The new president, General Costa Gomes, is
 a long-time ally of Spinola and is of the same
 ideological cast, but he is more patient about
 opposing points of view and more amenable to
 compromise. The presidency may be shorn of
 many of its powers, however, and the occupant of
 the office is in danger of becoming a figurehead.
 There is some doubt that Costa Gomes can keep
 the upper hand.
 With power now almost exclusively in the
 hands of the left, both the armed forces and the
 government are taking pains to disprove Spinola's
 assertion that Portugal is heading toward anarchy.
 The rightists are lying low for the present, handi-
 capped by a lack of organization.
 To assuage the concerns of the US, President
 Costa Gomes has reaffirmed Portugal's NATO
 ties, its wish for close relations with the US, and
 its desire for closer association between Portugal
 and the EC. Prospects for Portugal's continuing
 close relations with the US may be less promising,
 however, if Prime Minister Goncalves and the
 movement achieve unchallenged power.
 Portugal's  future  political  orientation
 depends  in  large  part  on  the armed forces.
 Whether the armed forces swing behind one side
 or develop conflicting loyalties will be a critical
 factor in deciding if there will be a relatively
 orderly  implementation   of decolonization and
 democracy,  a predominantly rightist or leftist
 regime, or civil war.

 EUROCURRENCY RE YCLING MAY DECLINE
 5- a J _5-J
 The Eurocurrenc market has so far been
 the dominant vehicle for recycling surplus oil
 revenues, but this may soon change. Several fac-
 tors are working to  induce oil producers in-
 creasingly to bypass the Eurocurrency market
 either in favor of New York or of more direct
 loans to other major oil-consuming countries.
 The pressures on the Eurocurrency  iarket
 are already reflected in the fact that the oil ex-
 porters are paid less than market rates for their
 short-term deposits and that the borrowing coun-
 tries have had to pay increasingly higher rates for
 loans. These forces should intensify in the next
 few months because oil producers will have more
 funds to place, as their net foreign exchange
 receipts in the second half of 1974 will be nearly
 double those of the first half. Moreover, many
 borrowers are reaching the limits of their credit
 lines and will be forced to pay even higher rates
 or not be given credit at all.
 The  increasing  problem  of  matching the
 supply of oil producers' funds with oil consumers'
 demands for loans will force both sides to seek
 new places to recycle oil mone.
 Borrowers, such as
 Italy, have had to bypass London recently be-
 cause they do not meet the necessary credit
 standards.

 Italian political leaders kept  ublic7debate
 on the back burner while President Leone was in
 the US last week on a state visit.
 the smallest of the three parties in his
 cabinet--the  Social  Democrats-threatened     to
 withdraw from the coalition over differences with
 the Socialist Party.
 Social   Democratic  leader  Mario   Tanassi
 charged that Socialist insistence on changes in the
 government's austerity program, together with
 their proposals for closer relations with the Com-
 munists, had made it impossible for the coalition
 parties  to  continue to  cooperate effectively.
 Tanassi said that the only solution was for Presi-
 dent Leone to call new elections since parlia-
 mentary arithmetic does not now permit a work-
 able  non-Communist                      majority  without  the
 Socialists.
 The  Social  Democrats said    they   would
 decide at a central committee meeting on October
 8 whether to follow through with their threat.
 There were signs, however, that the Social Demo-
 crats would be overtaken by events. The Socialists
 responded harshly to Tanassi's blast
 Even if the Social Democrats do bring down
 the government, they are unlikely to persuade
 President Leone to call new parliamentary elec-
 tions. Sentiment  is running against this alter-
 native, not only because it failed to solve any
 problems when last tried in 1972, but also be-
 cause the Socialists and Communists stand the
 best chance of scoring gains if elections are held
 now. Most political leaders would prefer to study
 the outcome of the regional elections set for this
 spring before risking a national contest.
 The main reason why the Socialists have
 drawn so much fire from the other coalition
 parties is their own threat to drop out of the
 coalition unless it approves the Socialist-proposed
 changes in the government's economic program.
 The Socialists--backed by their allies in organized
 labor-want additional spending on social pro-     25X1
 grams and public works, more credit for small-
 and medium-sized businesses, and other measures
 to avoid  the increased unemployment that is
 expected to develop as the austerity program
 takes hold.
 The Socialists can also be expected to lobby
 within the coalition for several other demands
 recently advanced by the labor federation that
 represents most of Italy's major unions. These
 include:
 ? Increases in wage adjustments that are
 automatically linked to price increases.
 ? Retroactive application of the increases
 in price-related wage adjustments that would
 provide a small lump sum payment to each
 worker.
 ? Linkage of some pension payments to
 wage developments.
 ? Additional  public  investment  in  the
 south and in the construction industry.
 ? Rollbacks of recent increases in elec-
 tricity and urban transportation rates.
 Implementation of many of the steps pro-
 posed by the Socialists and labor would scuttle
 the government's austerity program and doom
 prospects for a permanent improvement in the
 balance of payments. The wage proposals alone
 would add over $1 billion to the country's annual
 wage bill, reducing by at least a fifth the income
 the government had hoped to drain from house-
 holds through its fiscal measures.
 While tension increases within the governing
 coalition, the Italian Communists are keeping up
 the pressure for a direct voice in national deci-
 sion-making.  Negotiations on  labor's demands

 may provide another opportunity for the Com-
 munists to reinforce their claim that the country's
 problems cannot be solved without Communist
 assistance. The Communists exert strong influ-
 ence within the labor movement, and they will
 take much of the credit if talks among labor,
 management, and government officials produce a
 settlement acceptable to all sides.
 At the same time, the Communists are trying
 to draw the Christian Democrats into collabora-
 tion at the local government level. In their boldest
 move so far, the Communist mayor of Bologna--
 the political capital of the Communists' so-called
 "Red  Belt"  in north-central  Italy-invited the
 Christian Democrats to join his administration
 and suggested that they reciprocate in localities
 where Christian Democrats hold the balance of
 power.
 HUNGARY-USSR: A VOTE Jar's CONFIDENCE
 VHun arian
 g     party -moss Ka     six-day visit to
 the USSR ended with strong indications that he
 had bought Moscow's endorsement at the cost of
 greater orthodoxy and  closer coordination of
 Hungarian policies with the Kremlin.
 Throughout the visit, Soviet and Hungarian
 media--especially the  latter-stressed the close
 relationship between Kadar and Brezhnev. The
 effusive Soviet endorsements leave little room for
 any domestic forces to challenge Kadar on the
 grounds that Moscow lacks confidence in him.
 The price for this reaffirmation of Brezh-
 nev's support appears to have been high. Kadar, in
 signing the party and state communique, com-
 mitted Budapest to deeper involvement in eco-
 nomic integration, more joint economic planning,
 and  increased  ''joint  work"  on  ideological
 matters. There is also to be more extensive coor-
 dination of foreign policies, both bilaterally and
 within the Warsaw Pact. In addition, Brezhnev
 made it plain in several speeches that he expects
 to have more influence than in the past in prep-
 arations for the Hungarians' 11th party congress
 next spring.
 Kadar's public statements were almost com-
 pletely void of reference to Hungary's special
 interests. Instead, he drummed constantly on the
 themes of increasing cooperation with Moscow
 and the dangers of "deviationists" in the Commu-
 nist movement. Kadar also took the lead in ad-
 vancing yet another call for a consultative meet-
 ing of European Communist parties, now set for
 October 16-18 in Warsaw.
 Kadar will certainly try to see to it that his
 regime fulfills whatever commitments he made.
 Subservience to Moscow's foreign policy is old
 hat in Budapest. He will, however, face severe
 difficulties if the Soviets decide to take a direct
 hand in such delicate matters as Hungarian eco-
 nomic problems or try to meddle in the sophisti-
 cated give-and-take that Kadar maintains with
 Hungarian intellectuals.
 The Hungarian delegation-minus Kadar and
 his wife, who stayed on in Moscow for a vaca-
 tion-returned home to a full turnout of the lead-
 ership. Such public displays of unity may become
 commonplace, but the behind-the-scene struggles
 will continue between liberals, who are now at
 bay, and conservatives, who still look to the party
 congress as a good opportunity to undermine

 USSR - EASTERN EUROPE: GRAN PROSPECTS
 cThe USSR and Eastern Europe are expected
 to have good but not record grain crops this year.
 The harvest in both areas should largely cover
 domestic needs, so major imports from the West
 will not be necessary.
 USSR-The 1974 Soviet grain crop will probably
 be about 198 million tons-short of the official
 goal of 206 million tons but still the second
 largest grain crop in Soviet history. At the end of
 June, it appeared likely that the goal would be
 achieved, but the weather took a turn for the
 worse in July. In the west, heavy rains flattened
 the plants and hindered the harvest, while hot and
 dry weather destroyed some 8 million tons of
 grain-primarily wheat.
 The USSR will need 200 to 210 million tons
 of grain to cover domestic requirements and
 normal export commitments in fiscal 1975. Since
 20 to 30 million tons, were carried over from the
 record harvest of last year, a crop of 198 million
 tons should be sufficient to make large-scale grain
 imports unnecessary. The sharp drop in grain
 purchases and a return to the normal level of
 Drying wheat near Krasnodar, USSR
 grain exports will re-establish the Soviets as net
 exporters of grain.
 So far this year, the Soviets have bought
 only small quantities of grain. Most of the 1
 million tons of corn and wheat scheduled for
 delivery in fiscal  1975 are leftovers from old
 contracts with the US. A small amount of corn
 was  recently  purchased from Argentina. The
 Soviets can use the imports to offset shortages in
 certain kinds of grain. The corn will help feed the
 growing  livestock  herds,  while            the  imported
 wheat may be used for bread if the milling quality

 of both the wheat crop this year and the grain in
 storage is poor.
 Eastern Europe-The 1974 East European
 grain crop will probably amount to 71 million
 tons--2.5 million tons below the record set last
 year. Although record crops were harvested in
 East  Germany  and  Czechoslovakia,  Poland's
 crop-normally about 30 percent of the East
 European total---flirted with disaster throughout
 the growing season. Nevertheless,  Poland still
 managed to harvest about 20.5 million tons of
 grain, only 6 percent below the record set last
 year. Crop results were also mixed in the southern
 countries. Hungary had a bumper harvest, but
 Bulgaria  failed to improve over the past two
 years, and Romania had its second poor harvest in
 a row.
 Last European grain imports in fiscal 1975
 will probably reach 9 million tons, a million more
 than the previous year. The USSR will probably
 supply 4.5 million tons, mostly wheat. Based on
 past trading patterns, the East Europeans will
 look to the US for 2 to 2.5 million tons of grain,
 mostly corn, while seeking the balance from other
 Western sources.
 The northern countries will  account for
 almost all of the imports. East German and Czech
 requirements are likely to be about 3.5 and 1.5
 million tons, respectively. Poland will probably
 buy slightly more than 3 million tons. Each of
 these countries could reduce grain imports by
 purchasing other feeds, such as oilcake and meal,
 or by cutting livestock goals.
 Romania has already received $31 million
 from  the  Commodity  Credit  Corporation  to
 purchase US grain in fiscal 1975 and asked for
 additional credits. Nevertheless, Bucharest will be
 able to export some 600,000 tons of grain,
 mostly wheat, slightly less than in fiscal 1974.

 wheat; Hungarian grain exports may go as high as

 POLISH LEADER VISITS US
 LPolish party boss' dward 'Gierek starts a
 week-long official visit to the US on October 8
 that will mark a high point in postwar US-Polish
 relations. He will be the first Communist party
 leader to consult with President Ford and the first
 Polish leader since World War I Ito pay an official
 visit to the US.
 Gierek will lead a political and economic
 delegation and will bring along a flock of media
 representatives. The group will spend two days in
 Washington before Gierek addresses the UN Gen-
 eral Assembly in New York. He then will make a
 short tour of the US, including visits to coal
 mines in Pittsburgh and oil refineries in Houston.
 Although no major agreements are expected
 to be signed, Gierek views the visit as a milestone
 in his efforts to expand relations with the West.
 He would like to see a sharp expansion of the
 bilateral  economic, commercial, and scientific
 projects initiated when former president Nixon
 stopped in Warsaw  in 1972 on  his return from
 Moscow. Gierek recognizes that most Poles have
 friendly feelings toward the US. He hopes that
 the visit-already the subject of considerable pub-
 licity in Poland-will increase his stature at home
 and will also enhance Poland's international pres-
 tige. One prominent Polish editor recently told a
 US diplomat in Warsaw that there would be so
 much favorable coverage that the US would look
 like "one of our socialist brothers."
 While in the US, Gierek will serve not only
 as a spokesman for specific Polish interests, but
 will also convey his country's stand on inter-
 national issues, especially European security. In
 doing so, he can be expected to stay close to the
 Soviet  line. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko
 stopped in Warsaw earlier this week on his way
 home from the US and undoubtedly brought
 Gierek up to date on Moscow's views on major
 East-West issues.
 Gierek comes to Washington with a solid
 base of achievements in domestic policies and
 with his own leadership position unchallenged.
 Since becoming party chief, he has worked hard
 to improve the country's economic situation. He
 has sought to streamline an inefficient economic
 bureaucracy and to modernize Polish industry. At
 the same time, he has tried to meet rising con-
 sumer  demands.  Wages,  pensions,  and  social
 benefits for workers and peasants have risen sig-
 nificantly during the last four years. The Polish
 economy still faces some potentially serious prob-
 lems,  including  inflationary  pressures and the
 need to repay Western credits that will soon begin
 to fall due. At least in the short run, however, the
 Gierek regime seems capable of meeting these
 challenges.

 EGYPT: PEACETIME CABINET
 -President Sadat l`st1week to ,   the long-
 awa(ted step of relinquishing his wartime post of
 prime minister, a move meant as a further af-
 firmation of Egypt's intention to proceed with
 postwar reconstruction. Sadat formally gave way
 to  First  Deputy  Prime  Minister Abd al-Aziz
 Hijazi, who has been performing the duties of
 prime minister for some months.
 Hijazi's elevation comes at a time of in-
 creasing                        domestic criticism  of economic  mis-
 management by the government, and the now
 Prime Minister moved swiftly to reorganize the
 cabinet to signal a new effort to alleviate problem
 areas in the economy. Hijazi created two new
 cabinet posts,  both concerned with economic
 planning, and replaced four ministers whose per-
 formance had recently come under fire. The other
 31 cabinet members are holdovers.
 The new post of minister of state for eco-
 nomic  cooperation  gives cabinet  rank  to the
 former Agency for Arab and International Eco-
 nomic Cooperation, which was created earlier this
 year to coordinate foreign investment in Egypt.
 Another new minister of state, handling "coordi-
 nation and control," will apparently attempt to
 centralize and streamline the implementation of
 economic planning now wallowing in a welter of
 overlapping  and  uncoordinated  government
 organizations.
 Hijazi named new men to head the ministries
 of health, agriculture, industry, and supply, in an
 apparent effort to speed economic development
 or at least to acknowledge consumer complaints
 in these areas. Industrial revitalization is a key
 element of the government's plan, as is an im-
 provement in the clogged internal distribution
 system. The recent rise in consumer discontent
 over commodity shortages has been attributable
 in large measure to the inadequacy of the dis-
 tribution system.
 Hijazi and Sadat have been attempting to cut
 through the red tape that has long slowed the
 working  of  the  government. The overstaffed
 bureaucracy is as prominent and immovable a
 Hijazi
 feature of the Egyptian scene as the pyramids,
 and neither Sadat.nor his ministers have been able
 to vitalize the system or overcome its vested resis-
 tance  to                                                                                      streamlining  and  liberalizing  the
 economy.
 Sadat reaffirmed his commitment to eco-
 nomic changes in his Nasir Day address last week-
 end to a joint session of the Egyptian parliament
 and the Arab Socialist Union-Egypt's only polit-
 ical party. In a bow to the government's de-
 tractors, he acknowledged  the  right of party
 members to criticize the actions of government
 officials, including himself. Sadat made it clear,
 however, that he was determined to remain in
 charge and  that the scope  for  criticism  was
 limited.
 Sadat's  speech also  included  an effusive
 reference to the Palestine Liberation Organization
 as the  "living embodiment" of the    Palestine
 people.   He  stressed  that  a solution to the

 Palestinian question is more important than either
 the recovery of the Sinai or the Golan Heights.
 In addition, replying for the first time in
 public to the new US criticism of the oil pro-
 ducers, Sadat said that "those who invented the
 law of supply and demand have no right to com-
 plain when the law works against their interest."
 Sadat probably calculated that anything less than
 a spirited defense of the Arab oil producers on
 the price issue would only invite another round of
 attacks on him by Arab militants and risk jeop-
 ardizing support from the Arab conservatives for
 his efforts to spur further movement on peace
 NIGERIA: MILITARY TO STAY
 tGeneral  Gowon  QarIked  Nigeria's  14th
 independence anniversary this week with a speech
 in which he reneged on his earlier promise to
 restore civilian rule by 1976 and continued the
 eight-year-old ban on political activities. His an-
 nouncement confirms the resolve of the country's
 military leaders to control the pace and direction
 of domestic political evolution for as long as they
 deem necessary.
 Gowon did not rule out an eventual transfer
 of power to civilians, but maintained it could
 come only when there is no threat to stability and
 after a "self-sustaining system" to ensure stability
 has been  worked  out.  Gowon's statement in
 effect acknowledged that the military has made
 little headway in implementing the nine-point
 program to prepare Nigeria for civil rule, which he
 had announced four years ago. The decision also
 reflects the military leaders' concern over the
 recent resurfacing of Nigeria's deep-seated tribal
 and regional animosities because of controversy
 over the provisional results of the census last year.
 Intensified infighting among old guard politicians
 and their supporters in anticipation of an early
 lifting of the ban on politics was another factor.
 In an effort to neutralize anticipated criti-
 cism ot: the deferral of civilian rule, Gowon said
 he    would  establish  representative  advisory
 councils at both the federal and state levels. He
 also claimed progress was being made toward
 preparing a new constitution as well as a new
 formula for allocating national revenues, and he
 promised a stronger effort to combat corruption,
 implying  thereby  the  military's  continuing
 commitment to the nine-point program.
 More concrete gestures were reserved for
 two  of  the  more  important  interest groups.
 Gowon announced that, early next year, he plans
 to replace present cabinet heads and state military
 governors with other army and police officers and
 some civilians, a move that will open slots for
 grumbling  middle-grade  military  officers  and
 presumably also weed out a few of the officials
 tainted  with  corruption. To  restless workers,
 Gowon held out the prospect of a general pay
 raise at the end of the year.
 On two key points, Gowon was notably
 vague. He delayed a final decision on what to do
 about the controversial census figures----essential
 to implementing other parts of the nine-point
 program---until the end of the year. He said that
 the creation of additional states remained a pri-
 ority, but offered no further details on this tick-
 lish subject.
 The- reaction to the military's backtracking
 on civilian rule is likely to be mixed. Some Ni-
 gerians will welcome the decision as the best way
 to avoid a return to the divisive tribal politics that
 led to two coups in 1966 and civil war a year
 later. Gowon's announcement will not sit well
 with others, notably intellectuals, students, and
 former politicians. Over the short term, however,
 the army can probably contain any unrest that

 CAMBODIA: BREATHING EASIER
 C37 - 10
 \Phnom Penh's ensions eased this week as
 government employees and  military personnel
 received the increased pay provided by the eco-
 nomic reform package introduced last month. But
 relief for the government may be short lived. Pay
 envelopes this week were particularly fat because
 they contained  a lump-sum salary adjustment
 retroactive to September 1. By mid-month, con-
 sumers will face the impact of sharply increased
 prices allowed by the reforms.
 Meanwhile, the government has attempted
 to forestall any backlash from its recent dissolu-
 tion of the teachers' association by announcing
 the formation of a new teachers' organization
 under government sponsorship. Leftist teachers
 are continuing their anti-government activities,
 however, and have issued statements scoring the
 police raid on their headquarters and the sub-
 sequent arrest of two teachers. Student activists
 are keeping uncharacteristically quiet, but they
 presumably  are still  planning anti-government
 demonstrations.
 Although  preparations for the credentials
 battle at the UN General Assembly are still top
 priority on the diplomatic front, Phnom Penh and
 its international backers are marshaling forces for
 an anticipated challenge at the 18th UNESCO

 Government officials will stake the defense

 jOn October 5, the Thai  ational Assembly
 votes on the third and final reading of the draft
 constitution. It is an essential first step in Thai-
 land's effort to create a constitutional govern-
 ment, an undertaking triggered by the collapse of
 the Thanom military regime last October.
 The odds overwhelmingly favor passage of
 the draft despite vocal opposition from leftist
 groups and student activists. The Thai police are
 bracing themselves for the possibility of student-
 instigated violence  in an attempt to mar the
 proceedings.  Such opposition,  however,  is at
 strong variance with the mood of the country,
 which if anything looks upon the promulgation of
 a liberal, democratic constitution as a means of
 solving Thailand's political, social, and economic
 problems.
 Bangkok's outward appearance of calm on
 the eve of the assembly's vote belies an undercur-
 rent of tension that could make for an unstable
 political situation. According to press reports,
 Prime Minister Sanya, citing his poor health, has
 temporarily turned over the duties of his office to
 deputy prime minister Prakop. While the 67-year-
 old professor's health is indeed shaky, there is
 evidence that the timing of his decision to take
 leave from office was prompted more by political
 considerations. During the past week Sanya has
 been buffeted by strong criticism from all quar-
 ters, including his own cabinet, for his inability to
 get tough with student radicals who have man-
 aged to keep the political situation stirred up.
 The prospect of student demonstrations dur-
 ing the assembly deliberations on October 5 could
 also complicate  the political situation. While
 moderate university students have decided not to
 stage violent protests against the draft constitu-
 tion, their more militant leadership is attempting
 to get enough students into the streets to spark a
 confrontation with the police. While it seems
 doubtful that the militants will attract much stu-
 dent support-two key university groups have an-
 nounced they will refrain from any protests at
 this time-the fact that the police and army seem
 to be looking for the slightest excuse to crack
 down on student demonstrators raises the poten-
 tial for trouble.
 Whether or not the students go on the
 rampage, the erosion of Sanya's popularity in
 recent weeks suggests that he may continue to
 stay on the sidelines until the draft constitution is
 promulgated,  possibly on October 8. At that
 time, he may choose to resign citing the comple-
 tion of the task set before him when he took
 office one year ago-the drafting of a new con-
 stitution-and turn over his responsibilities for-
 mally to his deputy Prakop. Since general elec-
 tions are scheduled for February 1, it is presum-
 ably a solution that would be acceptable to most

 CHINA-PHILIPPINES: I  PROVING  ELATIONS
 C3 -- ie(.)
 The extraordinary reception accorded  to
 Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos during her
 September 20-29 visit to China appears to have
 set the stage for improved relations between the
 two countries.  Mrs. Marcos was favored with
 separate meetings with Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 and with hospitalized Premier Chou En-lai. Ex-
 cluding earlier sessions with US officials, Mao's
 meeting with Mrs. Marcos marks the only time in
 recent years that the Chairman has seen an emis-
 sary of a government with which Peking has no
 official ties.
 By their extraordinary treatment of Mrs.
 Marcos, the Chinese have shown that they will
 keep the pressure on for early diplomatic rela-
 tions. Manila has apparently already begun ex-
 ploring some of the issues that could come up
 during such negotiations. For example, the Philip-
 pines sent a representative to Taipei earlier this
 year to advise the Nationalists that Manila was
 considering ways of improving its relations with
 Peking. Manila undoubtedly will seek to deter-
 mine the status of Malaysia's relations with Tai-
 wan following its recognition of Peking earlier in
 the year.
 There were signs, however, that President
 Marcos, despite his own statements that eventual
 diplomatic recognition was inevitable, was not
 fully pleased with press speculation that Mrs.
 Marcos' trip implied immediate recognition of
 Pekin
 The joint trade
 agreement announced during Mrs. Marcos' visit
 reportedly provides for the sale of an unspecified
 amount of Chinese petroleum to the Philippines.
 Manila agreed to sell sugar, wood products, and
 other items to the Chinese. Details of the agree-
 ment are to be worked out when a Philippine
 trade delegation visits China later this year.
 Although Peking clearly would like to see
 early recognition, Manila's close relationship with
 Taiwan is only one of the problems that the
 Philippines must deal with first. The overseas Chi-
 nese                 community  in  the  Philippines, although
 much smaller than in Malaysia, has a great deal of
 economic influence and is-at least on the sur-
 face-largely pro-Taipei. In addition, the Philip-
 pines has from time to time publicly accused
 Peking of supporting the communist insurgency
 in northern Luzon. Also, President Marcos has
 often said that he would recognize the Soviet
 Union and China simultaneously, and there has
 been little progress in Soviet-Philippines relations
 in recent months.
 None of these issues, however, presents in-
 surmountable  problems in Manila. Marcos sig-
 naled how he will probably deal with one of them
 in a speech on September 20 when he said that a
 "distinction" must be made between communist
 insurgency at home and the Communist govern-
 ments that are trying to make a contribution to
 "cooperation among nations," an apparent at-
 tempt to play down Manila's charge that China
 was supporting the insurgents. President Marcos
 has probably concluded that, despite his inclina-
 tion for a measured approach to problems of this
 magnitude, the time has come to accelerate the
 pace  of  developing  Sino-Philippines  relations.
 THE KOREAN QUESTION AT THE UN

 The annual maneuvering at the UN on the
 Korean question, for many years one of the most
 contentious issues before that forum, is under
 way again. With detente increasing over the past
 several years, all of the major powers have acted    25X1
 with a common interest to preserve stability on
 the Korean Peninsula. This year, although events
 are not entirely in the hands of the major powers,
 the UN's handling of the problem will provide
 another measure of how well detente is working.
 Pyongyang's backers, consisting of the major
 Communist states and a growing number of Third
 World nations, have introduced a resolution that
 is-compared with earlier years-relatively mild.
 Its call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops in
 South Korea "under the flag of the United Na-

 US forces might remain under some bilateral ar-
 rangement.  Recent  statements  from  North
 Korean President Kim II-sung also suggest that

 Pyongyang's major objective this year is to end
 the UN role in Korea and that the question of US
 troops might be taken up later. The Pyongyang
 side probably took much of the harsh invective
 out of its latest resolution in an effort to win
 broader support, a tactic that appears to be hav-
 ing only limited success so far.
 The  main  thrust of a  counterproposal-
 sponsored by the US, Japan, and other supporters
 of Seoul-is a call for a renewal of meaningful
 dialogue between North and South Korea. The
 proposal maintains that any changes in security
 arrangements affecting the peninsula must be de-
 cided by the Security Council, which originally
 committed the UN to a role in Korea, and the
 two Korean sides. This would have the effect of
 removing the question from the General Assem-
 bly, where pro-Pyongyang forces have consid-
 erable strength.
 Acrimonious debate and a vote on a more
 strongly worded resolution attacking the US and
 UN roles in South Korea was averted last year
 after intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations in-
 volving the major powers. A compromise was
 achieved   under  which  Pyongyang's  backers
 dropped their demands that US forces withdraw
 and Seoul's supporters dropped their proposal
 that both Koreas join the UN; Seoul had pressed
 for  the  two-Koreas  concept,  but Pyongyang
 strongly opposed it. Additionally, the UN politi-
 cal apparatus in Korea was quietly phased out and
 the assembly adopted a consensus urging Seoul
 and Pyongyang to resume the halting dialogue
 that seemed so promising in 1971-72.
 Even if a hostile resolution recommending
 the withdrawal of foreign troops from South
 Korea were passed this year, US forces would be
 under no legal injunction to withdraw. The dam-
 age would be political and psychological. But
 unless Pyongyang's Third World backers gain un-
 expected  momentum,  this  seems unlikely to
 happen. While sharp debate in the General Assem-
 bly in November and the passage of a hostile
 Korean resolution cannot be ruled out, it appears
 now that the pro-Seoul resolution has a better
 chance of success and, even more likely, that
 another compromise will be worked out.
 The Chinese are concerned-as they were last
 year-that a divisive UN debate on the Korean
 question would not be to their advantage. Peking
 appears to be wary of any formula that might
 lead to a confrontation between the two Koreas
 or that could create a military vacuum in South
 Korea that could be filled by the Soviet Union or
 a rearmed Japan. Although Peking has maintained
 its firm public support of the North Korean posi-
 tion at the UN, there are indications that China's
 chief objective is to assure continued stability on
 the Korean Peninsula.
 The Chinese propaganda position is influ-
 enced both by the need to show "principled sup-
 port" for its allies and by a desire to deny the
 Soviets the opportunity to pose as Pyongyang's
 only reliable supporter.
 Chinese  UN  Ambassador  Huang  Hua's
 speech at the UN on September 19 reflects these
 concerns. Huang said it was "imperative'' that US
 "interference" be ended  and  that US troops
 ''under the UN flag" withdraw. As with previous
 official statements on the question, Huang's re-
 marks display Chinese support and sympathy for
 Pyongyang's position while clearly emphasizing
 termination of the UN role, rather than complete
 and rapid US military withdrawal.
 The Soviets would probably also be satisfied
 with a compromise solution. They have given
 unenthusiastic backing to Pyongyang's cause in
 the current General Assembly session and have
 not appeared anxious to press North Korea's case
 against US troops in the South lest this introduce
 another thorny question into the Washington-
 Moscow dialogue.

 CASTRO SPEAKS ON FOREIGN POLICY
 C ~    G
 /With  ~natCods/~ads and Pell and a large US
 press delegation in Havana at the time, Fidel
 Castro delivered one of his most comprehensive
 foreign policy addresses in over a year at a rally
 on September 28. Speaking from what appeared
 to  be a carefully prepared  text, Castro was
 broadly critical of the US, but he refrained from
 the sweeping denunciations and personal attacks
 on US leaders that were common in his speeches
 until a year or so ago. His principal focus was on
 Latin America, and once again he called for the
 creation of a new regional organization-without
 US participation-to replace the OAS.
 Castro strongly criticized covert US efforts
 in support of Chilean groups that opposed former
 president Allende. He denounced this "blatant
 interference in Chile's domestic affairs" as the
 latest on the "long list of acts of aggression'' by
 the US against Latin America. He did not accuse
 the US of complicity in the Chilean coup, how-
 ever, merely stating that "the CIA clearly played
 a decisive role in the creation of the conditions
 and preparation of the groundwork" that led to
 it. Though many Latin American leftists have
 loudly accused the US of engineering the coup,
 Castro has adhered to his own interpretation of
 events since September 1973 when he first dis-
 cussed Allende's fall.
 Castro reserved his strongest criticism for the
 OAS. Indignantly, he denounced that body for
 ignoring  US "intervention" in the hemisphere
 while upholding for ten years the economic and
 political sanctions that were imposed on his gov-
 ernment because it had engaged in subversion.
 Mindful that OAS members are scheduled to vote
 on the continuation of the sanctions next month
 in Ecuador, he endeavored to portray his regime
 as the aggrieved victim of aggression and to place
 the US on the docket instead. Without naming
 them, Castro condemned that minority of Latin
 American  governments that he considers "ac-
 complices" of "US aggression," seeming to blame
 them more than the US for perpetuating inter-
 American problems and divisions. Once again, he
 implicitly ruled out the possibility that Cuba
 would rejoin the OAS or restore ties with certain

 governments, even though he probably is confi-
 dent that the sanctions will soon be lifted and
 that a number of countries will seek to renew
 relations with Cuba.
 Castro spoke at length about international
 energy  issues.  He  supported  Venezuela  and
 Ecuador--the two Latin American members of
 OPEC-and criticized recent US policy statements
 on the pricing of petroleum. He blamed the US
 for aggravating inflation and monetary problems
 around the world, and proclaimed the right of
 less-developed countries to form cartels. He bal-
 anced these remarks, however, with a plea to
 oil-producing countries to "adopt the struggle of
 the underdeveloped world.." His effusive praise of
 the government of Venezuela and its nationalistic
 resources policies probably reflects his hopes of
 gaining access to Venezuelan oil, credits, and in-
 vestments once relations are restored. He men-
 tioned the USSR only once.
 Throughout the 50-minute speech, Castro
 eschewed the strident language and emotional
 tone that characterized many of his foreign policy
 addresses in previous years. His critiques of CIA
 activities in Chile and of US energy policy were
 no stronger than those by numerous other Latin
 American leaders. The Cuban Premier restated his
 willingness to begin discussions on normalizing
 relations with the US once the "economic block-
 ade" is lifted.
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: THE KIDNAPING
 Terrorists who k'ddn'aped al US embassy offi-
 cial               on  September 27  in Santo Domingo un-
 expectedly ran into a stone wall in trying to
 exchange her and several other hostages for a
 $1-million ransom, the release of 37 political
 prisoners, and safe conduct out of the country.
 President Balaguer gave in to terrorist de-
 mands in  1970 when kidnapers grabbed a US
 military attache and went into hiding. They won
 the release of 40 political prisoners in exchange
 for the attache's life. This time, however, Bala-
 guer is in a stronger position, since the terrorists'
 decision to hole up in the Venezuelan consulate
 allowed Dominican security forces to surround
 the building. Balaguer offered the six terrorists
 only their lives in return for the hostages' free-
 dom. Convinced that he was not negotiating with
 a suicide squad, Balaguer gambled that no harm
 would come to the hostages and that he would
 win out in the end.
 At first, Balaguer allowed food and drink to
 be delivered regularly to the consulate but after a
 week of waiting, his patience appeared to be
 wearing thin and he moved to hasten an end to
 the kidnaping by restricting deliveries.
 Meanwhile, the terrorists suffered an addi-
 tional setback on the political front when leftists,
 from  moderates  to  extremists,  publicly  dis-
 sociated themselves from the kidnaping
 To repudiate the kid-
 naping, the moderates urged their members who
 were in jail not to accept freedom should the
 government give in to the terrorists. Eleven well-

 VENEZUELA: RIDING THE CREST
 11'7
 ~fter six monthscslpresident,  arlos Andres
 Perez remains the unchallenged master of the
 local political scene and is emerging as a hemi-
 sphere and world figure.
 Swept into office with a massive popular
 vote and with his Democratic Action Party in
 control of both houses of congress, Perez im-
 mediately began to reshape the country's econ-
 omy.  Through tactical skill and manipulation of
 public opinion,  Perez obtained from congress
 extraordinary powers to rule by decree, for one
 year beginning last May, with respect to almost all
 important economic and financial matters.
 Since then, Perez has concentrated on im-
 plementing his economic policies and generating
 sufficient public understanding and support to
 silence conservative business critics who claimed
 he was moving too fast and too soon. At the same
 time, as a sop to the left, Perez has pressed his
 intention to take over the US iron-ore concessions
 before the end of the year and to nationalize US
 and other foreign petroleum concessions in 1975.
 During these months, Venezuela.has emerged as a
 financial power to be reckoned with. By the end
 of 1974, for example, its oil revenues alone will
 total almost $10 billion. Venezuela is now at-
 tempting to expand its leadership role in Latin
 America by such means as establishing a Vene-
 zuelan Investment Fund to channel some of its oil
 wealth into overseas projects.
 Perez'  popularity  with  the  Venezuelan
 people has been solidified by his aggressive de-
 fense of Venezuela's right to set its own petro-
 leum pricing policy regardless of sharp criticism
 from the US. Although Perez reportedly hopes
 that current differences with the US can be
 settled in an amicable fashion and that relations
 will  continue to  be cordial, he is not above
 orchestrating public opinion to justify or defend
 his administration's present and future petroleum
 policy.
 At home, Perez' policies have largely suc-
 ceeded in nullifying domestic opposition from
 left and right. With the economy growing and
 money pouring into the national treasury faster
 than it can be spent, the politically negligible
 right is more concerned with conserving and even
 increasing its stake in the economy. The largest
 opposition political organization in the country,
 the Social Christian Party of former president
 Caldera, is still in shock from its disastrous elec-
 tion defeat last December, although attempting
 slowly and painfully to pull itself together. It is
 attacking Perez and his party for the govern-
 ment's handling of the economy, especially the
 rising cost of living and an inflationary rate that
 this year may exceed 15-20 percent. The buoyant
 economy and such populist measures as a work
 stability law, across-the-board wage increases, and
 price freezes have muted the effectiveness of

 much of this criticism by the Social Christian and
 other political parties.
 The  Venezuelan  military, the traditional
 locus of political power, seems generally content
 with Perez, although there is some unhappiness
 with his reported failure to keep politics out of
 promotion and assignment policies. In any event,
 Perez has moved rapidly since his inauguration to
 edge out holdovers from the previous administra-
 tion and to ensure that major commands are
 staffed by men personally loyal to him.
 While Perez' power and popularity remain
 very high, there are several political and economic
 problems that could cause trouble in the coming
 months if they are not soon remedied. Among
 these is the great popular expectation that his
 economic policies have caused. If his administra-
 tion is unable to deliver on its promises, Perez will
 surely face a serious ebbing of popular support.
 There is also an increasing demand that the gov-
 ernment  spend  more  of  its oil  revenues on
 domestic projects, a move that would only fuel
 the inflationary spiral that the government is at-
 tempting to curb.
 Notwithstanding the fact that Perez is riding
 high, and his party is sharing in the reflected
 glory, there is evidence of some dissension and
 unhappiness within the Democratic Action Party
 over Perez' style of governing. Many of the party
 regulars feel ignored, shunted aside, and disdained
 by the President and his small clique of advisers.
 Attempts to get Perez to remove some of the
 more objectionable members of this coterie have
 been unavailing and perhaps have even further
 isolated Perez from party leaders. Nevertheless,
 they are in no position to challenge the President.
 Several party leaders already are jockeying for
 position for the party's presidential nomination in
 1978, and support from Perez will be a valuable
 asset. At this time, none of the potential nom-
 inees appears willing to sacrifice that advantage
 by  staging  an  open  revolt  against  his  pol-
 BOLIVIA: PRE-ELECTION MANEUVE,fiS
 (J 12 --- - ~ , )
 President Banzer is equivocating on his deci-
 sion not to seek another term. He also appears
 intent on obstructing preparations by the opposi-
 tion for the national elections he has called for
 next year.
 In July, following an attempt by junior mili-
 tary officers to oust him, Banzer promised to
 hold elections in 1975 and appointed a commis-
 sion to study electoral reforms. Although the
 commission has done nothing noteworthy thus
 far, pressure from political and military leaders
 has induced Banzer to move the election date
 forward from October to June.
 Initially, Banzer had said that he would not
 be a candidate, but last week, when the leader of
 a peasant group pledged his support, Banzer an-
 nounced that he had changed his mind. The Presi-
 dent's announcement, which came after all major
 political leaders had expressed their wish to see
 Banzer leave office, sparked public objections and
 reportedly antagonized a group of military of-
 ficers led by the retired army chief of staff Gen-
 eral  Eladio Sanchez. The  President has since
 thrown Sanchez out of the country, claiming that
 he was preparing to overthrow the government.
 Banzer is also trying to keep Bolivia's major
 political party, the National Revolutionary Move-
 ment, in a weakened state by ensuring the elec-
 tion of Ruben Julio, an undistinguished party
 hack- as the movement's chieftain.
 Because Banzer has lost most of his former
 supporters, it is unlikely that he could obtain the

 military figure who has the approval of most
 army leaders.
