 OSTA RICAN CONFERENCE SHOWS
 SUPPORT FOR ACTIO--~ O ISO-
 LATE COMMUNES  !CUBA
 (Mr. ROGERS of        asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and
 extend his remarks.)
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
 er, the conference of Central American
 leaders meeting with the President and
 congressional representatives recently in
 San Jose, Costa Rica, has produced
 evidence that a firm basis for hemi-
 spheric isolation of Communist Cuba not
 only exists, but cries for leadership and
 action.
 The exuberance and warmth which our
 President and delegation received in
 Costa Rica dramatically proves that the
 hopes and aspirations of  our Latin
 neighbors are riding with the United
 States, a fact which is given additional
 credence by the unanimous  support
 which this Nation received in the Organ-
 ization of American States last October
 during the Cuban missile crisis.
 But the Communists are organizing
 rapidly in Latin America, ironically they
 plan to convene ir. Brazil shortly, a coun-
 try which is at this moment pleading for
 U.S. financial aid.  In the face of this
 threat to the freedom of this hemisphere,
 we cannot withhold a solution to the
 Cuban problem.
 As the President has now stated, our
 immediate policy is the isolation of Cuba.
 It is gratifying to see that one of the
 topics discussed at Costa Rica included
 measures I have long recommended as
 necessary to place Cuba in solitary con-
 finement-namely the ban on movement
 of Castro agents and propaganda, and
 the restriction of Cuban Government
 funds.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge that the United
 States assume the first step of leader-
 ship by closing U.S. ports to nations
 which engage in sea trade with Cuba,
 then make the following proposals to
 the OAS for adoption by the nations of
 this hemisphere:
 First, close hemispheric seaports to
 nations engaged in sea trade with Cuba,
 Second, close hemispheric airports to
 airlines flying into Cuba,
 Third, ban movement of Castro agents
 and  propaganda  throughout  Latin
 America,
 Fourth, ban relay of unofficial tele-
 communications messages to and from
 Cuba, and
 Fifth, freeze Cuban Government funds
 now on deposit in Latin American finan-
 cial institutions.
 Mr. Speaker, adoption of this plan by
 the Organization of American States
 would effectively place Cuba in solitary
 confinement.  Isolatiortd of Cuba is now
 a matter of official U.S. policy, and the
 above steps are our only immediate re-
 course to the Cuban problem short of an
 act of war.
 If we are serious about fighting com-
 munism in this hemisphere, we will act
 quickly in the coming days with a con-
 centrated,  hard-driving  campaign to
 place the policy of isolating Cuba into
 practice.
 ADJOURNMENT OVER
 Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Speaker,  I ask
 unanimous consent that when the House
 adjourns today it adjourn to meet on
 Thursday next.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentle-
 man from Louisiana?
 There was no objection.
 SPECIAL ORDERS TRANSFERRED
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, I further
 ask unanimous consent that all special
 orders heretofore entered into for to-
 morrow and Wednesday be carried over
 until Thursday next.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentleman
 from Louisiana?
 Mr. HALLECK.  Mr. Speaker, reserv-
 ing the right to object, would those that
 were scheduled for tomorrow come first
 then on Thursday?
 Mr. BOGGS.  That would be my un-
 derstanding, Mr. Speaker.
 Mr. HALLECK.  I withdraw my reser-
 vation of objection, Mr. Speaker.
 Mr. HARVEY of Indiana.  Mr. Speak-
 er, further reserving the right to object,
 might I inquire of the majority whip
 whether his request was to the effect
 that all special orders for today and
 tomorrow go over?
 Mr. BOGGS.  Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
 tleman will yield, the request is for those
 special orders for Tuesday and Wednes-
 day.
 Mr. HARVEY of Indiana.  Mr. Speak-
 er, I withdraw my reservation.
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Is there
 objection to the request of the gentleman
 from Louisiana?
 There was no objection.
 PROTECTION OF THE VICE PRESI-
 DENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 (Mr. McCORMACK (at the request of
 Mr. BoGGs) was given permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. McCORMACK.  Mr. Speaker, I
 take this time to inform the House that
 I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. James
 J. Rowley, Chief, U.S. Secret Service,
 relative to the protection of the Vice
 President of the United States.
 The letter follows:

 The Honorable Joins W. MCCORMACK,

 request for my comments on the remarks
 yesterday by Congressman SILVIO O. CoNTE.
 regarding the Secret Service's appropriation
 request for additional staff to carry out its
 responsibilities under present law which calls
 for the protection of the Vice President, may
 I say that a number of questions were raised
 that need clarification.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                      4601
 Irregardless, the State Department will
 loan Brazil the money she requested.
 While we heard anguished cries from
 the Brazilian Government when the
 State Department announced Commu-
 nist infiltration of Brazil, it has yet to
 refute these charges.
 As far as I am concerned, Brazil
 should not get a plugged nickel from the
 United States.
 Despite this heartbreaking disaster there
 was no anguished cry for aid from Washing-
 ton or the State capitol at Columbus.  True,
 the refinements of Federal aid had not been
 thought of then, but Congress was only too
 happy to logroll a hodgepodge of river and
 harbor bills to relieve localities of the costs
 of local improvements.  Instead of calling
 on the logrollers, the thoroughly drenched
 Miami Valley citizens took the quaint stand
 that control of the river was their job, and
 not a legitimate burden on the taxpayers of
 Montana or New York.
 All they asked from the lawgivers at Co-
 lumbus was permission to form the conserv-
 ancy district, with power to levy taxes for
 the purpose of keeping the rivers from their
 doors and barnyards.  That permission was
 granted by the State legislature.  No appeal
 of any kind went to Washington, and the
 only entrance of the National Government
 came when a Federal district court ruled
 that the United States had no objection.
 The district issued almost $34 million in
 bonds.  Proceeds were used for construction
 of dams and channel regulation, and that
 ended the floods for the Miami Valley.  In
 this engineering project there were no extras
 such as hydroelectric power, swanky fishing
 and recreation resorts or resettlement proj-
 ects.  Flood control was what the Miami
 Valley people paid their money for and
 flood control is what they got.
 Today, as the district prepares to levy the
 final assessment for retirement of the last
 bonds, the flood-free communities, farms,
 and individuals of the Miami Valley are
 pretty proud of their accomplishment.  It's
 theirs and they paid for it without outside
 help, advice, second guessing or the nostrums
 of the District of Columbia school of medi-
 cine.  Equally pleasing to most is the fact
 that the district provided no plum tree for
 anxious jobseekers.  Only 56 persons are em-
 ployed on the entire project, hardly enough
 to staff the public relations offce of almost
 any Washington bureau you pare to name.
 COMMUNISM IS NV NEGOTIABLE
 (Mr. STINSON asked and was given
 permission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD, and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. STINSON. Mr. Speaker, many of
 the citizens in this ? country will argue
 Communism is not negotiable, The reason
 for saying this is not political but philo-
 sophical.  Despite the new""nice guy" mask
 Khrushchev is wearing, he is still a Com-
 munist.  As such, he will be content with
 but one objective: mastery of the entire
 world.  He has told us this, he has set about
 scientifically and methodically to prove it.
 Cuba is just one more step along the way.
 Communism understands but one law:
 force.  And brute force is not negotiable.
 Force   is  only countered  by  counterforce.
 The brief blockade was a beautiful exam-
 ple of this simple fact.
 We have been told that we must not
 "fear to negotiate."  Where communism is
 concerned, dare we make such a statement?
 It might be good rhetoric-but what about
 the logic?  It would seem that in dealing
 with Khrushchev, negotiation ought to be
 our greatest fear.  If Cuba has not taught
 us this, it has taught us nothing.
 Our verbal threats against Russia's pres-
 ence 90 miles off the Florida coast are be-
 ginning to sound about as dangerous as the
 "do that again and I'll spank" of an in-
 dulgent mother to her spoiled child.
 Soviet presence on the island of Cuba can-
 not  be tolerated.   Everybody  in the free
 world agrees to this.  This presence cannot
 effectively and completely be removed by
 mere negotiation. Recent history attests to
 that.
 An editorial in this week's issue of Life
 magazine outlines some excellent steps that
 could be taken to rid ourselves of Castro's
 so-called defensive Russian army.
 While the Life editorial's specific recom-
 mendations may not be in every instance as
 carefully conceived or outlined as those of
 a military strategist, still the principle upon
 which they are based is absolutely correct.
 The editorial rightly contends that "It is
 time for deeds as well as negotiations * *

 YUGOSLAV MILITARY ATTENDING
 ARMY COMMAND AND GENERAL,
 STAFF   COLLEGE   AT   FORT
 LEAVENWORTH, KANS.
 (Mr. WYMAN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. WYMAN.  Mr. Speaker, I wonder
 if our citizens know that a uniformed
 military officer from Communist Yugo-
 slavia attends the regular Army Com-
 mand and General Staff College at Fort
 Leavenworth, Kans.  I wonder if they
 know that no less than four general of-
 ficers of the Yugoslav Army are gradu-
 ates of our top staff college.  I wonder
 if they know that clearance for this must
 come from the White House. I wonder
 if they know that this has been happen-
 ing for some years.
 Mr. Speaker, what goes on here? Even
 the most uninformed among our citi-
 zenry knows that such military men
 have sworn allegiance to a Communist
 flag; that everything they learn at our
 General Staff College goesright back to
 Communists; that Yugoslayia is in close
 military" liaison with the Soviet general
 staff.                    -
 Whether or not attendance at clas-
 sified classes is barred to these men, the
 vast military knowledge they gain in a
 full course at Fort Leavenworth is un-
 deniable.  It is the sheerest lunacy to
 condone educating Communists about
 the operations of our general staff on the
 theory that it encourages splinter groups
 within the Soviet periphery.
 I believe that we should investigate so
 that we can know just who cleared this
 assignment in this administration as
 well as under whose individual direction
 and initiative this sorry practice was in-
 itiated years ago.  It is not the Army's
 fault.  Orders for such inanity come
 from on high, not from the Army, of -
 that we can be certain.
 This is further glaring evidence that
 the present administration does not un-
 derstand that all genuine Communists
 are deadly serious in their fanatical de-
 sire to destroy the United States.  This
 is so whether they are Russian Commu-
 nists or Chinese Communists or Yugo-
 slav Communists. One does not appease
 a rattlesnake by inviting him into his
 house.      -

 to vote. Large wheat farmers would be
 eligible to vote on election day auto-
 matically without previously signifying
 their Intentions to do so.
 Is it consistent for the administration
 to protest the inability of some citizens
 to vote in general elections due to un-
 necessary and  discriminatory  voting
 regulations and then to arbitrarily place
 such regulations in the paths of the
 Nation's small wheat farmers to keep
 them from voting in a referendum?
 March 25
 and as a consequence they will probably
 not look upon it with favor, that the
 powers that be do not want them to
 vote and this accounts for these addi-
 tional and burdensome regulations being
 placed upon them.  It also could be
 argued that a 7-day open season on our
 15-acre farmers who do sign up will be
 needed in order to launch an all-out,
 concentrated attack upon them in the
 hope of convincing them to vote right.
 If this is the case, someone has mis-
 judged these farmers as they do not
 succumb to badgering and cajoling.
 Whatever the reason for this proposed
 regulation, it is not sufficient to warrant
 such rank discrimination among the
 wheat producers of America.  I there-
 fore, urge you, Mr. Secretary, in fairness
 to these small wheat farmers, not to
 put this proposed regulation Into effect.
 THE NEW FRONTIER
 (Mr. BECKER asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute.)
 Mr. BECKER.  Mr. Speaker, after
 reading the President's speech made at
 Chicago on Saturday, I am wondering
 when he is going to stop his changing
 moods and let the American people know
 when and where he expects to find the
 New Frontier. On Saturday he said that
 perhaps if we do not have a tax reduc-
 tion we may not have a recession, but
 here he changed his mood. He went on
 to say:
 But. If we do not have tax reduction our
 unemployment may go from 8 to 7 percent.
 In the campaign in 1960 President
 Kennedy promised he was going to end
 unemployment, but I say seriously that
 in his changing moods and changing
 everybody know what the New Frontier
 is and whether he ever expects to find
 it.  His changing mood is giving the
 American people and business the jitters.
 Perhaps if he stopped changing his posi-
 tion so frequently, business could settle
 down, expand, and be in a position to put
 more people to work and end the rise in
 unemployment.
 CAN WE CUT FEDERAL EXPENDI-
 TURES IN YOUR DISTRICT?
 (Mr. JOELSON asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. JOELSON. Mr. Speaker, we have
 been hearing much talk about the need
 for reducing Federal expenditures for
 years, but getting very little action.
 Although the talk still continues, the
 fact remains that in fiscal 1963, out of a
 total Federal budget of $94 billion, the
 following  appropriations  were  passed
 unanimously: About $50 billion for na-
 tional defense, $51/2 billion for veterans'
 benefits, and $31/2 billion for space ex-
 ploration.                                                                                                            These items, together- with
 interest on thenational debt which is a
 fixed charge, account for approximately
 75 cents out of every tax dollar.
 Because of the unanimity with which
 these appropriations were endorsed by
 Why double standards for our Ameri-
 can wheat producers, Mr. Freeman?  Is
 it necessary to make first- and second
 class citizens out of our wheat farmers
 in order to make your supply-manage-
 ment theory work? If so, this is another
 good reason why your supply-manage-
 ment approach for agriculture should
 not be adopted.
 What is the real reason for this pre-

 farmers, Mr. Freeman?  You cannot
 argue that you need this information In
 order to ascertain who these 15-acre
 farmers are as your county committees
 already have this information, It can-
 not be argued that a farmer could not

 It could, however, be argued that since

 my colleagues, those who are calling for
 decreased spending evidently want cuts
 to be made in the appropriations which
 consume the remaining 25 cents out of
 every tax dollar.
 Since each Congressman knows his
 own district the best, I would appreciate
 hearing from each of my colleagues
 about his suggestions for cutting down
 on Federal spending in his own district.
 As a member of the Appropriations Com-
 mittee, I would be pleased to total the
 suggested amounts and pass the infor-
 mation along to my chairmafi.
 If a flood control or land reclamation
 project which is scheduled for construc-
 tion in a Representative's district is con-
 sidered unnecessary by him, I would
 appreciate hearing from him about it.
 Likewise, those of my colleagues who
 object to their districts receiving area
 redevelopment funds  or moneys for
 their local schools under the aid to fed-
 erally impacted areas legislation should
 not hesitate to let me know about it.
 Those of my colleagues from farm
 areas should feel free to tell me how
 much less they want spent in` their own
 districts for price supports, and those
 who represent urban districts should
 similarly advise how much less they
 wish their districts to receive for urban
 renewal.
 Does any Congressman wish to file
 objection to the spending of money in
 his district under the Federal road pro-
 gram?  If so, just let me know.  For
 that matter, I should also like to hear
 from anyone who disssents from the ex-
 penditure of Federal funds in his area
 for hospitals under the Hill-Burton Act.
 Naturally, I should also welcome any
 information from anyone who would like
 a large defense contract terminated in
 his district.
 When I total all the response, I shall
 announce the result.  I doubt that I
 shall require an adding machine.
 WASTING MONEY
 (Mr. JONES of Missouri asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr. JONES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker,
 as a member of the Subcommittee on
 Printing of the Committee on House Ad-
 ministration, I have been advised that a
 number of bills will be considered to-
 morrow.  This has reminded me of a
 wasteful practice that has gone on for
 years and which is proposed to be per-
 petuated in another way. I am referring
 to the printing of calendars which are
 distributed to the Members.  Now that
 is a small item and I will probably be
 branded as a nitpicker.  But we are
 spending $27,473 a year to print calen-
 dars to be distributed to the Members,
 and each one of us gets 10 of these
 calendars and more if we request them.
 To me. that is an utter waste of money
 and I intend to try to stop it. If there
 are others who concur in my views with
 respect to this, I would appreciate it if
 they would so inform the Subcommittee
 on Printing stating that they do not
 endorse this waste of money. With mil-
 lions of calendars of every conceivable
 size and design being distributed by all
 types of businesses as well as individuals,
 I cannot believe that anyone is being
 denied, a free calendar; and for that rea-
 son can see no reason why the Congress
 should approve this waste of money.
 This is just one of many small ways in
 which Members of Congress can effect
 small savings, which total a substantial
 sum.  The greatest good that can come
 from' this action of discontinuing this
 practice is that it would indicate Con-
 gress desire to practice economy-and
 once we make the start, I believe it will
 result in greater and substantial savings.
 REPUBLICAN BUDGET HYPOCRISY
 (Mr. HOLIFIELD asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. HOLIFIELD.  Mr. Speaker, the
 partisan statements of Republican lead-
 ers in reference to the President's tax
 reduction and budget proposals border on
 political hypocrisy.
 They have apparently forgotten, in
 their zeal to discredit the Democratic
 program, that the largest peacetime
 deficit in history occurred during a Re-
 publican administration in 1959 and
 totaled $12.427 billion.
 They have apparently forgotten that
 the cumulative deficit during the Eisen-
 hower Republican administration was
 $21.953 billion.
 They criticize the President's efforts to
 stimulate the economy with a tax reduc-
 tion at a time when a deficit will occur.
 I would call their attention to the year
 1954-during the Republican adminis-
 tration-when there were tax reductions
 totaling an estimated $7.4 billion.  This
 came at a time when it was obvious there
 would be a deficit, and there was a
 deficit.
 The tax reduction included removal of
 excess profits tax, reductions in individ-
 ual income taxes, reduction in excise
 taxes, and revisions of the Federal Rev-
 enue Code.
 The Republican leadership now takes
 the position that tax reduction in the
 face of a deficit is an unpardonable
 financial sin.
 But in 1954, when the economy was
 lagging, the Republicans turned to tax
 reduction and the economy showed a
 substantial upswing.  With the healthier
 economy, the Republicans were able to
 achieve surpluses.
 The Republican leadership questions
 an increase in the national debt ceiling.
 Yet during the Republican administra-
 tion the debt ceiling was increased for
 fiscal 1955, for 1958, for 1959, and 1960.
 So it is apparent that the criticism of
 the Republican leadership stems' from
 sheer partisan politics.  When a Repub-
 lican President called for tax reduction,
 an increase in the debt ceiling, and a
 deficit budget, this was acceptable, even
 praised.
 But when the Democratic administra-
 tion in office attempts to stimulate a
 lagging economy and increase Federal
 revenues looking toward ultimate bal-
 ancing of the budget, then-in the Re-
 publican view-an outrageous financial
 crime is being committed.
 The facts are that we are falling $30
 to $40 billion short of our potential in
 national output, $18 to $20 billion short
 in wages and salaries, and $7 to $8 billion
 in business profits.  We have an unem-
 ployment rate of more than 6 percent
 and persistent, large budget deficits.
 Failure to act now to stimulate the
 economy is inviting another recession.
 Our high tax rates are repressive.  A
 tax reduction is needed urgently.
 Certainly our expenditures should be
 carefully studied.  They have been care-
 fully studied.  Some reductions are be-
 ing made. But to achieve the sort of
 budget reduction the Republicans advo-
 cate would seriously hamper our defense
 efforts-because that is where the bulk
 of the budgetary increases have been.
 The best way to balance the budget is
 to balance the economy. The increased
 economic activity from a tax rate will
 produce more revenues which can and
 will be used to achieve a balanced Fed-
 eral budget.
 The Republican leadership would do
 well to lend its support to a sensible
 economic program of this kind, rather
 than devoting its time to irresponsible
 sniping for political purposes.
 AREA REDEVELOPMENT
 AMENDMENTS
 (Mr. PURCELL asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. PURCELL.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 introduced a bill today to amend the
 Area Redevelopment Act to correct what
 I believe to be a serious inadequacy in
 this legislation.
 The bill provides that the Secretary
 of Commerce shall include in his stand-
 ards for designation of counties under
 this act, standards based on the migra-
 tion out of the county.
 The present law provides that this
 shall be one of the things considered in
 formulating the standards.  But it is
 very necessary to make counties eligible
 on this basis alone if we are to stem the
 tide of migration to already overcrowded
 metropolitan areas.
 The many communities which are
 losing population today because of a lack
 of jobs would like to be able to retain
 the young people who are leaving today.
 With just a little help, such as assist-
 ance through the Area Redevelopment
 Act, these communities could establish
 new industry and provide new jobs for
 these young people.
 The figures on unemployment and in-
 come do not show these counties to be
 within the standards adopted by the Sec-
 retary of Commerce for designation un-
 der this law.  However, the fact is that
 many of these counties which are rapidly
 losing population are in very  serious
 trouble.  What has happened is that,
 instead of hanging on, these people who
 have lost jobs have moved out of the
 county. Those who had businesses have
 shut them down and gone elsewhere,

 usually to work for someone else rather
 than open a new business.
 The net effect has been that the un-
 employment rate and the income rate In
 the counties do not reflect the total sit-
 uation.  Those who are unemployed
 show up on the rolls of a big metro-
 politan city. They show up on the wel-
 fare rolls of these cities. The effect Is
 the same on the national economic pic-
 ture.  The people are still unemployed.
 The county still is deteriorating from
 lack of industry and employment oppor-
 tunity. And we are now doing nothing
 about it.
 The expansion of this program, Mr.
 Speaker, as proposed in the bill I have
 introduced today, will have an immedi-
 ate stimulating effect on the economy of
 many rural areas across our land just
 because of the existence of this provi-
 sion.  The effect when the provision is
 Implemented with proper funds and ad-
 ministrative action would be tremen-
 dous.
 When people want to help themselves,
 I feel we should assist them In this effort.
 That is the purpose of this bill.  I hope
 my colleagues will give it their prompt

 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. AL-
 BUT).                   Under previous order of the
 House, the gentleman from Florida [Mr.
 CRAMER] is recognized for 30 minutes.
 (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. CRAMER.  Mr. Speaker, I along
 with other Members of this House of
 Representatives had the privilege over
 the weekend of visiting Guantanamo
 Bay, the American military base in Cuba.
 I do not want to make that particular
 visit the principal subject of my re-
 marks, but it does have a relationship to
 the subject which I do want to discuss
 rather briefly and 'that is the question of
 'the proposed foreign aid to B     ,par-
 ticularly in view of the annou~hent
 which we see on the UPI ticker just to-
 day, to the effect-it has been known be-
 fore of course, but the number of coun-
 tries attending has not been known-the
 fact that the Communist-inspired Con-
 tinental Congress of Solidarity With
 Cuba meets In Rio de Janeiro the 28th of
 this month, Thursday of this week, and
 who is going to be in attendance-78
 countries have decided to attend at this
 meeting which is commonly known as a
 meeting for the purpose of ultra liberals
 and some Communists to carve out a
 solidarity with Cuba-that means Com-
 munist Cuba program. Included in these
 78 countries are Cuba itself, Russia and
 Red China, and a number of other coun-
 tries are to be involved including many
 in  this hemisphere.   Representatives
 from 78 countries are attending. Despite
 this and other evidence of the growth of
 communism In Brazil as even stated by
 the State Department Itself in Brazilian
 Ambassador Gordon's testimony before
 the Belden subcommittee to the effect in
 Brazil the Government has been infil-
 trated with Communists, the student
 movement has been infiltrated with Com-
 munists as well as the labor union
 movement.
 Of course. there was an effort by the
 State Department to claim that this
 testimony which appears in the record
 of the hearings before the Subcommit-
 tee on Inter-American Affairs was taken
 out of the context and did not really
 mean what it says. Anybody who reads
 it will note that it is very clearly stated
 that there has been Communist Infiltra-
 tion in the Government, in union move-
 ments, and In student groups-on page
 247 of the hearings I quote "The prin-
 cipal field of Infiltration and influence
 is in the labor unions. In the Govern-
 ment staff there has been infiltration.
 The student movement in another ma-
 jor area of penetration with the Na-
 tional Student Union now being domi-
 nated by Communists."
 What does all this amount to?  And
 I am going to take a few minutes to re-
 view the extent of Communist infiltra-
 tion and buildup in Brazil. As a matter
 of fact, the fearless reporter who had
 the intestinal fortitude to state the facts
 of what is going on in Brazil was just
 recently declared to be persona non
 grata by the Government because he
 had the Intestinal fortitude to put in the
 record for all to read the story of the
 Communist buildup in Brazil.  I am
 sure most of you have read that article
 by Mr. Stein with regard to the amaz-
 ing Communist buildup in Brazil which
 is, I believe, self-explanatory. I include
 the article at the close of my remarks.
 Here is what happened, for Instance, in
 Costa Rica during the visit of the Presi-
 dent on March 20 with regard to our
 policy in giving foreign aid to these
 Latin American countries who still rec-
 ognize and do business with Castro's
 Cuba and who do not do all they can
 to oppose Communist subversion within
 their countries, but, as a mater of fact,
 in some instances are even encourag-
 ing it.
 Here Is what one Costa Rican student
 stated at the time of this visit at the
 University of Costa Rica:
 It is foolish for you Americans to give
 money  to  corrupt,  oligarchy-controlled
 Latin American governments without su-
 pervising the expenditure of every dollar.
 You're throwing money down the drain,
 and In the end you'll lose both the money
 and the country.  And you shouldn't make
 an exception of our own Government, how-
 ever advanced it might be.
 These were students in a university
 In a country with a long history of
 democracy and social progress, condi-
 tions lacking in most Latin American
 countries.  This was the advice of stu-
 dents given to reporters at the time of
 the President's visit at the Costa Rican
 Conference on March 20, 1963.  Good
 advice, I believe, but advice which we
 are not heeding these days.
 Who is going to be in attendance at
 this conference in Rio, in a country to
 whose Government we are proposing to
 March 25
 give $55 million of a $11/2 billion program
 for the purpose of building up the econ-
 omy of Brazil so she can continue to
 trade with Soviet Russia?  I under-
 stand, although it has not been officially
 announced at the movement, by the wire
 services, that the President is expected
 to make a pronouncement concerning
 it sometime today that this $55 mil-
 lion to Brazil has been agreed to as the
 first Installment despite the fact the
 Government of Brazil refuses to con-
 demn this conference, as a matter of
 fact Is going to let It go on in Rio de
 Janeiro, is weakening in its opposition to
 communism,  Is  doing business with
 Russia,  and  continues  to  recognize
 Castro.
 Who are some of the Brazilians who
 are going to be in attendance at this
 conference? I think this indicates the
 extent of the infiltration of communism
 in the country.  Who are some of the
 Brazilians who are going to be in attend-
 ance at this Red continental congress?
 There is going to be Luis Carlos
 Prestes, Secretary General of the Bra-
 zilian Communist Party.  Another is
 General Lutz Gonzaga de Oliveira Lelte,
 president of the Brailian Association of
 Reserve Officers; and Francisco Juliao,
 a federal deputy and founder-president
 of the Castroist Peasants League.
 Dante Pelicani, president of the Na-
 tional Federation of Industrial Workers,
 and Almino Afonso, Minister of Labor in
 President Goulart's Cabinet and leader
 of Goulart's Brazilian Labor Party in
 the Federal Chamber.
 Clodsmith Riani, a Labor Ministry
 functionary and chief of labor's general
 strike command.  Mario Shemberg, a
 well known Sao Paulo physicist, and Rob-
 erto Morena, who, according to Lacerda,
 served as a political commissar with the
 Communist forces in the Spanish civil
 war.
 Where did this list come from? This
 list came from a list of those expected to
 be In attendance, taken from the lug-
 gage of Luis Carlos Prestes, secretary
 general of the outlawed Brazilian Com-
 munist Party, as he departed recently on
 a trip to Havana, Prague,, and Moscow.
 It was taken from his luggage by Carlos
 Lacerda of the city where the convention
 Is going to be held; namely, Rio de Janei-
 ro. His public security officers were the
 ones who got possession of these docu-
 ments. No one has denied them. There
 is not any question but what in all prob-
 ability these persons named are not only
 going to attend but It also gives best evi-
 dence of their background and their
 inclination.
 Many of them are very substantial
 people in the Goulart government. How
 could these people maintain these posi-
 tions under the Brazilian Government
 setup if the President did not agree to
 their receiving these positions, because
 the appointive power in Brazil is with
 the Executive, not even subject to con-
 firmation by the legislative branch.
 So these people are in the government
 at least by sufferance of the President
 himself.
 I am not going to read in detail, but
 I have in my possession a document that

 reviews the history of the buildup of the
 Communist Party and of Communist
 subversive activities in Brazil, starting
 back in April of 1960, when Francisco
 Juliao, whose name I just mentioned,
 and Santos Morais, accompanied the
 Brazilian presidential candidate on his
 visit to Cuba in April 1960,
 During that visit, Juliao and Morais
 had a personal meeting with Fidel Castro
 in which they requested Castro's finan-
 cial support for the Peasants Leagues.
 Castro studied the request, and after
 consultation with Che Guevara, he in-
 formed Juliao that his decision was to
 not support the leagues, a decision that
 was due in great extent, to the observa-
 tion made by Guevara that there was no
 existing proof that these leagues were
 organized.
 In November 1960, Juliao made a visit
 to Red China, where he again requested
 financial assistance, this time from the
 Communist Chinese government. - Juliao
 obtained the promise of financial help
 which would have to be channeled
 through the Castro government.
 The reason I am spreading this infor-
 mation on the RECORD is I believe our
 Government should seriously reconsider
 any approval of a loan to Brazil until
 Brazil shows its ability to clean out the
 Communists that are known to have in-
 filtrated the Brazilian Government, and
 insist that Brazil withdraw recognition
 of Castro's Communist government and
 stop doing business with him and to side
 with the forces of freedom-having op-
 posed the United States at Punte del
 Este and during the quarantine refus-
 ing to join it.
 I made a similar request that related
 to Mexico the other day. Until Mexico
 stops permitting the inflow of persons for
 subversive purposes-including U.S. citi-
 zens-through the open door of subver-
 sion out of Mexico City and the Cuban
 Embassy, we should not give it any aid.
 Even the CIA Director himself Admitted
 there were individuals going to Cuba for
 training purposes in 1962, at which time
 I brought out the fact, that there were
 some 73 Americans as well going down
 there in violation of the U.S. laws-and
 unprosecuted.     -
 After a strong protest, that aid should
 be withdrawn from Mexico until this
 open door is closed.
 Mr. GROSS.  Mr.. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER? I yield to the gentle-
 man from Iowa.
 dime as long as this meeting is in the
 works.
 Mr. CRAMER.  I thank the gentle-
 man.  Of course, he is an authority on
 this subject, being a member of the Sel-
 den subcommittee, at least to that ex-
 tent, and I am glad that he placed on the
 RECORD the fact that assurances were
 made to that committee. This is some-
 thing I did not have knowledge of my-
 self, that Brazil did make assurances
 that this congress would not be held,
 which obviously seems to me to be a con-
 dition precedent in Alliance for Progress
 funds being seriously negotiated at this
 time. And, I will say to the gentleman
 further that I called the State Depart-
 ment, Mr. Moscoso's office, and I in-
 quired in regard to the Alliance for Prog-
 ress funds and I tried to get some infor-
 mation even in regard to what requests
 had been made, and that was denied me.
 As to the conditions that were being con-
 sidered, they would not even discuss that.
 I said, "Are you going to attempt to gain
 assurances that if they get this money,
 they are going to fight communism in-
 stead of permitting it to grow in that
 country, as part of the policy of the
 United States, and what should be the
 basic policy of our Alliance for Progress
 funds" and I was denied any information
 of any kind at that time and have re-
 ceived none subsequently.
 So, far as the buildup is concerned, I
 could quote, for instance, from the
 Worker, the Communist newspaper in
 this country, on Sunday, March 17. And
 that happened. to be the very weekend
 that I was asking for this information,
 the very weekend that the State Depart-
 ment was trying to expunge from the offi-
 cial records of the Selden committee the
 testimony of its own Ambassador to Bra-
 zil to the effect that there was infiltra-
 tion in the Government, in the unions,
 in the student movement. Here is what
 the Worker said on that very Sunday,
 March 17, when the papers reported
 the fact that the State Department did
 not mean what it said. This is a report
 by Art Shields:
 Brazil Communist Party's strength doubles
 in 2 years, says Carlos Prestes.
 The very man I was just referring to
 who is going to this Rio conference:
 Big changes are coming in Brazil, and the
 Brazilian Communist Party is much in this
 changing picture.
 Its strength h?s doubled since 1960, says
 Luis  Carlos  Prestes,  the  party's  general-
 secretary.
 "The influence of the Communist Party
 and other democratic groups is rising in the
 ranks of the Brazilian Army," said Prestes,
 who used to be an army colonel himself.
 Further quoting from the article:
 The big job internationally is to win so-
 cialism with the least sacrifices.  "But social-
 ism" he said, "cannot be prevented."  He
 proudly declared, "We Brazilians are fighting
 to become the second people in Latin Amer-
 ica to open the door to socialism."
 This was the very day the State De-
 partment was trying to expunge from
 the records of the Congress its own
 testimony with respect to the Commu-
 nist buildup in Brazil:,
 Mr.  ROGERS  of  Colorado.  Mr.
 Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER.  Yes, I yield 'to the
 gentleman from Colorado.
 Mr.  ROGERS of  Colorado.  Do I
 understand that the gentleman made a
 request of the State Department to give
 the gentleman information as to the
 amount of money we have spent in
 Brazil in this Alliance for Progress
 program?
 Mr. CRAMER.  No; that information
 is readily available to everyone, includ-
 ing the gentleman from Florida, and
 the gentleman from Florida is well
 aware of it.  What I asked for was how
 much they are now negotiating for; how
 much have they requested?  The news
 reports vary as to the amount of money
 involved.
 I was told that I could not get this in-
 formation-that I was not entitled to
 it-and they would not discuss what the
 Brazilian Finance Minister asked for.
 Mr. ROGERS of Colorado. If the gen-
 tleman will yield further, how long ago
 was that request denied to the gentle-
 man?
 Mr. CRAMER.  That was on Satur-
 day, March 16, 1963, the very day before
 this Worker article came out.
 Mr. ROGERS of Colorado.  The rea-
 son I ask this is the fact that I have a
 constituent who is interested in the
 amount of money being proposed that
 we spend in Brazil.  He asked me that
 question in a letter.
 Has the gentleman from Florida any
 information or is the gentleman going to
 place i the RECORD the amount of mon-
 ey t1 6-7,V,-                                                                                                  spent heretofore in
 Brazil .j
 Mr. CRAMER.  I will say to the gen-
 tleman from Colorado if the gentleman
 will look at 'my remarks of March 18,
 1963, page 4189, the gentleman will see
 that information, indicating that some
 $450 million to date. is to be repaid by
 Brazil, and they are asking for forgive-
 ness on that. He is asking, according to
 the press, for release of $84 million to
 the $553 million U.S. aid which was giv-
 en to Brazil since 1951. And according
 to today's report, $55 million more is
 requested as the first of three yearly
 amounts.
 Mr. ROGERS of Colorado.  If the
 gentleman will yield further, when the
 gentleman discussed with them the ques-
 tion of the request that had been made,
 did they give the gentleman any sub-
 stantial reasons why they would not give
 the gentleman the information?
 Mr. CRAMER. They said negotiations
 were underway and that they had-no in-
 Mr. GROSS.  I thank the gentleman    They say in the last 2 years that the

 the life of me I cannot understand how
 this Government can seriously consider.
 giving one thin dime to Brazil under the
 circumstances that exist.  The Finance
 Minister of Brazil and the Ambassador of
 that Government in Washington told our
 subcommittee that Brazil would not hold
 the Continental Congress for Cuban Soli-
 darity or whatever the specific title of
 that meeting, the Communist meeting in
 support of Cuba.  But now the meeting
 is to be held, apparently, with the sanc-
 tion of the Government of Brazil, and
 2 years ago to 600,000 today.
 Further quoting from the article:
 The movement for peace, which is the
 party's central issue, has made great ad-
 vances.
 I met Prestos when he talked to a group
 of correspondents during a short visit to
 Moscow.
 Further quoting from the article:
 Prestes gave us many details of the rising
 strength of the people's forces.  Thus the
 Communist Party's ties with the militant
 working class of Brazil have grown much
 stronger since the late 1950's.
 The student movement is rapidly growing.

 lieve the people of this country are en-

 these circurmstances.
 Mr. GROSS.  I will say to the gentle-

 of the Brazilians is the round figure of
 $500 million-one-half billion dollars.
 That is what they want.
 Mr.    ROGERS  of  Colorado,  Mr.
 Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. CRAMER.  I yield to the gentle-
 man from Colorado.
 Mr. ROGERS of Colorado.  Do I un-
 derstand from testimony which is avail-
 able that the asking price now by Brazil
 is that they want one-half billion dollars
 for next year?
 Mr. GROSS.  The gentleman will have
 to take my word for that.
 Mr. ROGERS of Colorado.  Oh; sure-
 ly.
 Mr. GROSS.  The asking price, the
 Brazilian asking price, is in round fig-
 ures $500 million.  This Is on top of, as
 I understand it, somewhere near $1.5
 billion already made available to Brazil in
 various financing deals.  And from the
 $500 million there would be a refinanc-
 Ing, as I understand it, of payments to
 Soviet-bloc countries of certain short-
 term credits that are due or very shortly
 coming due. In other words, they would
 like to obtain money from U.S. taxpay-
 ers to refinance their obligations to the
 Soviet-bloc  countries,  among  other
 things.
 This is a rather complicated thing, but
 it boils down to the asking from this
 country in various ways of refinancing,
 new money, and so on and so forth, ap-
 proximately one-half billion dollars.
 Mr. CRAMER.  To substantiate what
 the gentleman from Iowa says on trade
 with Russia as part of the Brazilian deal
 it was reported from Rio de Janerio in
 the press that just before Dantas, the
 Finance Secretary, came to this coun-
 try to negotiate as follows:   -
 Brazil is about to sign a long-term $160
 million-a-year trade agreement with the
 Russians as part of a 8-year plan the United
 States would be asked to help finance.
 Martin who not too long ago stated in
 hearings before our own subcommittee
 of the Committee on Agriculture that
 he had proceeded to carry out one pro-
 gram, having to do with Brazil, by the
 way, without any regard to the wishes
 of the Congress or even, for that matter,
 taking the trouble to bring the matter
 to the attention of his superiors as un-
 der the law he was supposed to do.
 Mr. CRAMER.  I thank the gentle-
 man. I believe that the American peo-
 ple are entitled to this information.
 That Is why I requested it, as well as be-
 cause of my concern over the statement
 of the Department of State Itself to the
 effect that Communist infiltration in
 Brazil had reached what I would call
 serious proportions and still existed,
 which is found in the record of the hear-
 ings of the Selden Committee.
 Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of
 talk about training schools for subver-
 sives in Cuba, by Castro and the Com-
 munists.  This report which I am plac-
 ing in the RECORD gives an example in
 very specific detail of how these schools
 are carried on. how the students are
 brought in, and even names some of the
 students. They follow up their activi-
 ties in Brazil, after their training.
 For instance, from July 28 to August
 20, a total of 52 Latin Americans at-
 tended the guerrilla warfare instruction
 course. Besides the 12 Brazilian stu-
 dents from the Peasants Leagues there
 were 12 Venezuelans, 17 Argentines, 6
 Paraguayans and 5 Panamanians.
 This was away back In 1991. The prin-
 cipal Brazilians taking the course were
 the same men who later directed the de-
 velopment of the guerrilla movement of
 the leagues in Brazil.  They were, for
 instance :
 Clodomir de los Santos Morals, ex-
 Deputy of the state of Pernambuco,
 member of the Communist Party of Bra
 zil (PCB) and the principal aide of
 Francisco Julien.
 Joaquin Ferreira, member of the Com-
 munist Party and ex-Economist of the
 "SUDENE," a state organization for the
 so-called development of Northeast Bra-
 zil, under the direction of Celso Fur-
 tado.

 youth sector of the Communist Party
 and law student in Pernambuco.

 secretaries of the state committee of

 Guillermo Franco was in charge of the
 course.  The holding of this guerrilla
 course was carefully  disguised, even
 within Cuba. The "students of guerrilla
 tactics" were presented officially as dele-
 gates to the 26th of July anniversary fes-
 tivities and after that date as visitors
 and tourists. This was the second course
 of this nature under the patronage of .
 the Cubans, the first having been held
 in May 1#61.
 These instructions included daily rifle
 practice, guerrilla maneuvers simulated
 In the mountains of Los Organos, the
 handling and identifications of weapons
 and  ideological  indoctrination.  The
 "students" were instructed in the dis-

 various Americah firearms, including
 models M-1 and M-3, Garand, and
 Hotchkiss and Browning machineguns.-
 The instruction was limited to American
 weapons, according to explanations of
 the instructor, because they, as guer-
 rillas, should capture and use the arms
 of the enemy.  They were familiarized
 with the manufacture of "Molotov cock-
 tails" and the M-26 incendiary bomb.
 The instructor explained that this bomb
 has been perfected by the Guevara to
 be shot from a rifle.
 Some theoretical classrooms were operat-
 ing                                                                                           In Granja del Pueblo Hermance $Aiz
 [Satz Brothers People Farm] under the di-
 rection of  Major  Franco,  where the "stu-
 dents" attended classes.  Franco, a very close
 confidential friend of Fidel Castro, also held
 the position of paymaster, handing out funds
 for the occasional expenses of the "students."
 These latter were constantly reminded that
 a good revolutionary must be well indoctri-
 nated In the Marxist-Leninist theories.  Be-
 sides Major Franco, the following members
 of the Cuban Revolutionary Army acted'as
 instructors: Rolando Lazaro Requeljo, An-
 tonio Reins Jimenez, and Teodoro Braunn.
 The Panamanians, under the direction of
 Jorge Ferreira, were subjected to a special
 rigorous course.
 It goes on to describe the balance of
 the course and how they were hidden
 in the hotel and were taken out on-!a
 1-day basis for the trip, so It would not
 appear they were other than tourists:
 The majority of the trained guerrillas re-

 August 20, 1961, arriving on the 21st or 22d.
 The plane that was to take the Brazilians,
 Argentines, and Paraguayans  were over-
 fined, because some visitors-not "guerrilla
 students'"-also had taken passage on that
 plane.  For this reason, those who had less
 urgent needs to return remained another 2
 days In Havana, as tourists, leaving on a
 second Cuban plane on August 22.  This
 plane also transported the Uruguayan dele-
 gation.                                                                                                   The plane returned via Port of
 Spain, reaching S&o Paulo on August 23.
 The Brazilians who landed on this occasion
 were arrested by the police, charged with
 carrying subversive propaganda.  But they
 were set free, together with the propaganda,
 on the same day.                -

 There were only 16 Communists in the
 Federal Legislature at the time the Party
 was outlawed in 1948.  Sr. Prestes, then a

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                March S-5
 No one in Brazil could hope to mount a
 successful  coup without  control  of the
 armed forces.
 The Communists know this.  Leftwing
 nationalist officers also appear to realize it.
 . Hence, both groups are courting the non-
 commissioned officers.
 Sr. Juliao flatly stated recently that "we
 expect to carry out our revolution with the
 help of the sergeants in the armed forces."
 BRASS
 The  importance of the  noncoms as an
 emerging new power within the armed forces
 was stressed recently by thepresence of high
 brass sitting down front at a noncommis-
 sioned officers meeting.
 On   hand  were: Admiral  Pedro  Araujo
 Suzan, navy minister; Brig. Reynaldo de
 Carvalho, air minister; Gen. Osvtno Ferreira
 Alves, first army commander; Admiral Can-
 dido Aragao, marine corps commander.
 The generals applauded political speeches
 by noncoms who criticized Congress and the
 courts.  The military code actually prohibits
 any person in uniform from making political
 statements.
 All the ofcezs present were leftwing na-
 tionalist supporters  of President  Goulart.
 Fellow officers call Admiral Arsgao'a Com-
 munist while General Alves proclaimed at a
 public gathering that he and fellow traveling
 Labor Minister Afonso "have the same ide-
 ology."
 Several sergeants were elected last October
 to  state  assemblies  with  nationalist  and
 Communist backing and one was sent to the

 BEAMLIAN ENVOY  GIVING EXPLANATION
 Brazil's Ambassador Roberto Campos today
 said his hour-long talk with Under Secre-

 "helped to clarify unwarranted misunder-
 standings" of a U.S. charge that Communists
 had infiltrated the governm*nt of President
 Joao Goulart.
 But the Brazilian envy Sternly warned
 that "one should be extr'mely careful In

 treatment from Communist Yugoslavia
 and Poland and require that the prod-
 ucts of these countries be dutiable at the
 same full duty rates as the other Com-
 munist countries.  Although this is a
 matter of principle more than anything
 else, I want the House to understand
 that It is not just a demand for action
 based on legality alone, but that the
 factual situation is such that serious in-
 jury Is being caused to domestio indus-
 tries because of the failure of the Presi-
 dent to act in accordance with the
 explicit requirement of the statute.
 There are two rolled zinc plants in In-
 diana.  One is located in Greencastle
 and the other In Muncie.  These plants
 manufacture zinc sheet and zinc strip.
 There Is substantial production of zinc
 strip by these plants. Formerly there
 was substantial production of zinc sheet
 but imports now have ruined the zinc
 sheet business in this country.  In 1962
 more than half of the Imports of zinc
 sheet were of Yugoslavian origin. These
 foreign zinc sheet imports had an av-
 erage declared foreign value in 1962 of
 only 12.1 cents per pound-less than the
 price which my constituents must pay
 for the metal from which to manufac-
 ture zinc strip and zinc sheet.  In 1952
 imports of zinc sheet represented a
 quantity equivalent to only 1 percent of
 domestic Industry production. For 1962
 zinc sheet imports represented a quan-
 tity equivalent to 48 percent of domestic
 industry production.  I am presenting
 zinc sheet Import statistics and not zinc
 strip import statistics because the Bu-
 reau of the Census only collects data on
 zinc sheet imports.  Zinc strip imports
 are in a category with a number of other
 products  even     though  Interestingly
 enough, zinc strip production is many
 times that of zinc sheet.
 Employees in rolled zinc plants in my
 State, I am pleased to say, are well paid.
 Their wages are more than eight times
 the wages paid in metal industries In
 Communist Yugoslavia.  With a situa-
 Under the circumstances, I ask you,
 why does not the President act? Even if
 the law were discretionary and he only
 had authority to act to assist an Ameri-
 can industry confronted with ruinous
 import competitidn from Communist
 Yugoslavia, you would think he would
 act. But this is not a discretionary mat-
 ter.  The law clearly requires that the
 President shall take this action. He has
 not acted, and he has given no indication
 of when he is going to act. This is one
 of the greatest affronts Congress has
 ever received from a President. A law is
 passed which the President signs, and
 then he does not act as the law specifi-
 cally provides that he shall act.
 New, let us be completely fair about
 the matter and see if there is any basis
 for the President failing to act. In 1951
 in the Trade Agreements Extension Act
 the same language was used to require
 the President to withdraw most-f avored-
 nation treatment from countries which
 are members of the world Communist
 movement.  This involved 13 countries
 and yet President Truman was able to
 complete action and issue the necessary
 directives within 2 months-August 3,
 1951, Proclamation No. 2935, 16 Federal,
 Register 7635, and 16 Federal Register
 7637.  You  see,  most-favored-nation
 treatment was not withdrawn from Yu-
 goslavia and Poland at that time because
 it was determined that these countries,
 while Communist countries, were not
 members of the world Communist move-
 ment but Instead, so-called independent
 Communist countries-an interesting re-
 finement and'-distinction.
 Because of this distinction and the fact
 that most-favored-nation treatment was
 not withdrawn from Yugoslavia and Po-
 land under the 1951 act, it was necessary
 to include an additional provision in the
 1962 act which directed that most-
 faltored-nation treatment be withdrawn
 from any Communist country irrespec-
 tive of whether or not the country is a
 member of the world Communist move-
 ment.
 Five months have now elapsed since
 the effective date of the law. Only two
 countries are involved and yet the Presi-
 dent has not acted.  President Truman
 was able to withdraw most-favored-na-
