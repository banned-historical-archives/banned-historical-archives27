 Near East and
 South Asia Review
 Saudi Arabia and the Yemens:
 Riyadh's Little Nightmare
 The coup in South Yemen in early January and
 resulting pressure on President Salih in neighboring
 North Yemen have heightened Saudi Arabia's
 longstanding concerns about instability and Soviet
 influence along its southeastern border. This problem
 comes at a time when Riyadh is preoccupied with
 potentially threatening developments in the Iran-Iraq
 war and uncertainty in the world oil market. After
 remaining cool toward the new South Yemeni leaders
 in the early weeks after the coup, the Saudis are now
 moving to improve ties. They probably judge that at
 least correct relations with Aden and the possibility of
 future Saudi aid will ensure against South Yemeni
 pressure on Saudi Arabia's southern flank and reduce
 the chances that Aden will meddle in Oman or North
 Yemen. Riyadh is uneasy about South Yemen's
 intentions, particularly since Moscow's influence in
 Aden apparently remains strong, and the Saudis will
 be ready to offer low-key support to any viable
 opposition willing to challenge the new regime.
 Normalizing Relations With Aden
 Embassy reporting in mid-April indicated that the
 Saudi Government will soon return its Ambassador to
 South Yemen to monitor developments in Aden.
 hostile riven by longstanding border disputes,
 ideological and tribal rivalries, and significant inroads
 by Moscow in both countries since the early 1970s.
 The Saudis fear that instability in either country
 could work against their interests. The importance
 Riyadh gives the Yemens is underscored by the fact
 that Saudi policy toward these two countries is
 developed and implemented by a special committee
 under the direction of Defense Minister Sultan for the
 approval of King Fahd.
 Relations with South Yemen deteriorated
 significantly after the border war between the
 Yemens in 1979, which the Saudis saw as evidence of
 indirect Soviet pressure on North Yemen. Diplomatic
 relations and Saudi cash assistance to South Yemen
 evaporated and did not change significantly until
 1985 when Saudi Foreign Minister Saud visited in
 April and the Saudis committed $30 million in aid for
 a port project in Aden. Although Riyadh believed
 President Hasani was less ideological and more
 willing to improve relations with moderate Arab
 states than other senior South Yemeni leaders,
 Embassy reporting after Sa`ud's visit indicates
 Riyadh feared that more radical, pro-Soviet elements
 were gaining strength and that the potential for
 Riyadh sees little to be
 gained from continuing efforts to isolate the new
 South Yemeni leadership as long as there is no serious
 threat from internal or exiled opposition elements.
 The Saudis announced their intention at the mid-
 March meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council after
 Oman urged the GCC states to normalize relations
 with the new leaders to encourage moderation in
 Aden.
 A Long History of Trouble
 Saudi relations with both North and South Yemen
 have traditionally been uneasy and sometimes
 serious instability was growing.
 Relations with North Yemen have been plagued by
 overlapping territorial claims, Saudi efforts to
 influence North Yemeni policy, and Sanaa's irritation
 with its financial dependence on Riyadh. The Saudi's
 sizable annual subventions to the North Yemeni
 Government-probably more than $200 million a
 year-and worker remittances from the nearly

 1 million North Yemeni workers in the kingdom have
 helped Riyadh manipulate North Yemeni politics to
 Saudi advantage. They also have helped limit Sanaa's
 ties to Moscow and strengthened internal stability in
 North Yemen. Recent oil discoveries probably will
 complicate the relationship, holding out the prospect
 that North Yemen will be less of a drain on the Saudi
 pocketbook but also less accommodating to Saudi
 Saudi Reaction to the Coup in South Yemen
 The initial Saudi response to the ouster of South
 Yemeni President Hasani was confined largely to
 helping North Yemeni President Salih provide
 support to Hasani's exile forces and not moving
 toward accommodation with South Yemen's new
 hardline leaders.
 Saudi King Fahd sent senior officials to
 Sanaa several times in the confusing weeks following
 the shootout in South Yemen.l
 In addition, Riyadh stepped up support to President
 Salih to stiffen his backbone and strengthen North
 Yemen against possible military or political spillover
 from the trouble in Aden.
 At
 eas some o   e military aid provided was probably
 intended to strengthen the North Yemeni military.
 The Saudis were unwilling to risk more direct military
 involvement to support Hasani or influence events
 inside South Yemen.
 Riyadh initially offered diplomatic support to Hasani
 to legitimize his claim to leadership and prevent the
 new South Yemeni leaders from winning diplomatic
 recognition from other countries. According to the US
 Embassy, the Saudis received an envoy from Hasani
 with considerable publicity and supported him
 publicly in the Saudi press. They also urged Hasani to
 send emissaries to other states in the region to seek
 support.
 Riyadh also deflected efforts by the new South
 Yemeni leaders to open a dialogue,
 Pulling Back From Hasani
 Riyadh now sees little possibility that Hasani can
 regain control or even mount an effective opposition.
 According to US officials, the Saudi Government is
 unwilling to provide significant aid to Hasani unless
 he can demonstrate that he has enough support inside
 South Yemen to lead a viable opposition. They are
 skeptical, moreover, that he can or even will lead such
 an effort, and the Embassy reports that they are not
 likely to fund a South Yemeni government in exile.
 Saudi willingness to reduce their support for Hasani
 probably was accelerated by suspicions that North
 Yemeni President Salih was beginning to hed a his
 bets.

 China's Evolving Strategy
 in India and Pakistan
 Since the change of leadership in India in October
 1984, China has intensified its efforts to seek a
 rapprochement with New Delhi. Weakening Soviet
 influence in India and tempering tensions between
 India and Pakistan are China's primary goals.
 Beijing's actions have established a basis, we believe,
 for gradual improvement in Sino-Indian relations.
 However, we do not expect early resolution of the
 border issue-the most serious problem dividing the
 two countries. To reassure Pakistan that progress with
 India will not come at Islamabad's expense, China
 will continue to demonstrate its friendship and its
 support for Pakistan's security.
 ? Yao invited Rajiv to visit China-an invitation
 Premier Zhao Ziyang extended again at the United
 Nations last October.
 ? China gave in to India's demand that they negotiate
 a border settlement sector by sector, paving the way
 for the first substantive discussion since the talks
 be an in 1981
 ? Last year Beijing pushed for a trade agreement to
 increase Sino-Indian trade by working for a more
 balanced exchange of goods.
 China's Response to the Leadership Change in India
 China first sought to improve relations with the Desai
 government of India in 1977, hoping that the Janata
 Party, which had not received Soviet support in the
 election, would be more open to Chinese overtures.
 Beijing's efforts, however, were not successful with
 either Desai or his successor, Indira Gandhi.
 Longstanding conflicting political interests as well as
 differences over the disputed border proved to be key
 stumblingblocks.
 After Rajiv Gandhi's succession, Beijing saw a new
 opportunity to improve Sino-Indian relations.
 Chinese leaders
 initially regarded Rajiv Gandhi as more moderate
 than his mother. They believed he would gradually
 move India away from the Soviet Union and adopt a
 more conciliatory attitude toward both the West and
 China.
 To encourage this shift, Chinese leaders have made
 several overtures during the past 18 months:
 ? China sent ahigh-level delegation led by Vice
 Premier Yao Yilin to Indira Gandhi's funeral,
 signaling the importance of Sino-Indian relations to
 Beijing.
 ? China proposed that India reopen its consulates in
 Lhasa and Shanghai in return for the reopening of
 Chinese offices in Bombay and Calcutta.
 China's efforts have met with limited success. India
 dropped its demand that the border issue be resolved
 before addressing other matters and signed an
 agreement with Beijing last November calling for
 growth in bilateral trade from $46.7 million in 1984
 to $100-160 million in 1986. At the border talks last
 year, the two countries reached agreement on such
 issues as compensation for goods confiscated during
 Differences over the border issue are as intractable as
 ever, reflecting the underlying distrust that exists
 between the two nations. According to the US
 Embassy in New Delhi, China had expected India to
 make concessions in the eastern sector in return for
 Beijing's earlier agreement to address the border
 question sector by sector as New Delhi wished. Indian
 Foreign Ministry officials claimed, however, that the
 Chinese changed the rules by proposing mutual
 concessions as the basis for sector-by-sector

 A decade q/'good relations between China and India
 came to an end in 1959 as disagreement over the
 delineation ctJ'their 3,380-kilometer common border
 erupted in clashes between Chinese and Indian border
 patrols. China had built two roads across Indian
 territory in Aksai Chin to supply Chinese troops
 stationed in Tibet. As the Tibetan rebellion jiared
 and the Dalai Lama fled to India, Aksai Chin
 assumed greater strategic importance to Beijing.
 To resolve the growing dispute over this area, Prime
 Minister Zhou Enlai q,~ered in 1959 to recognize
 India's claim to disputed territory along the eastern
 border-demarcated by the McMahon Line, imposed
 on China in 1914 by the British-in exchange for
 Aksai Chin. Nehru rejected the idea and in 1961
 ordered the Indian Army to move forward into Aksai
 Chin and the territory just north of the McMahon
 Line, triggering increasing border clashes. The
 following year China launched afull-scale attack,
 overrunning poorly equipped Indian forces in both the
 eastern and western border sectors. One month later
 Beijing declared a unilateral cease-fire and
 consolidated its hold over Aksai Chin and adjacent
 negotiations. As a result, a stalemate has developed,
 with China maintaining that, as long as India refuses
 to make concessions in the east, the Chinese will
 concede nothing in the west. Furthermore, according
 to foreign affairs officials of both countries, China
 refused to discuss its borders with Sikkim, which
 Beijing does not recognize as part of India, or with
 Kashmir, which Chinese Foreign Ministry officials
 say must be decided first between India and Pakistan.
 Following this refusal, China upset India by agreeing
 to discuss the Xinjiang-Kashmir border with
 Pakistan. India protested a meeting in February 1986
 of the Sino-Pakistani Joint Boundary Inspection
 Commission, claiming that China has no boundary
 with Pakistan since the territory in question is Indian.
 According to Chinese Foreign Ministry officials,
 portions of the border but withdrew north oj" the
 McMahon Line. Since then China has gradually
 reduced its forces along the Sino-Indian frontier, and
 the border has been quiet since Beijing and New
 Delhi initiated a rapprochement in 1976.
 China and India began border negotiations in
 December 1981. No progress was made during the
 first three rounds of negotiations as the two sides put
 forward incompatible proposals. India advocated a
 sector-by-sector approach, while China again put
 forward Zhou's suggestion of a territorial swap.
 Beijing finally acquiesced to India's demand at the
 .fifth round in 1984 on condition that the final
 agreement be comprehensive. That opened the way
 for a substantive discussion of their conflicting claims
 in the eastern sector at the sixth round of talks in
 November 1985. A stalemate immediately developed,
 however, when India rebuffed a Chinese proposal of
 mutual concessions in the eastern sector.
 Negotiations will probably be held later this year,
 although a date has not been set. We do not expect
 significant progress at the next round of border talks.
 Beijing has told New Delhi that China considers any
 resolution in its border discussions with Pakistan to be
 "temporary" and will discuss the matter with both
 India and Pakistan once they have resolved the
 Kashmir dispute.
 Problems with the border issue may slow progress in
 other areas. Rajiv Gandhi has dropped hints in the
 Indian press, for example, that he will not schedule a
 visit to China until there is a significant breakthrough
 in bilateral relations-by which, we believe, he means
 Chinese concessions on the border. New Delhi also
 has indicated it would prefer to see movement on the
 border issue, according to the US Embassy in New
 Delhi, before considering the reopening of consulates.

 Secret
 New Delhi's View of Sino-Indian Relations
 New Delhi is pleased that Sino-Indian relations have
 gradually improved since 1980. New Delhi, in its
 view, has taken several steps-initiating border talks
 with Beijing, improving relations with Washington,
 and purchasing West European arms-to put
 distance between itself'and the Soviet Union and
 provide an opening to Beijing. Indira Gandhi took the
 first steps toward China out of pique with the Soviet
 policy in flfghanistan and with what she considered
 unacceptable meddling by Moscow in Indian politics.
 As the new head of the Nonaligned Movement, she
 also wished to correct the perception that India was a
 Soviet proxy.
 Rajiv Gandhi has changed the style but not the
 substance oJlndianloreign policy-including Sino-
 Indian relations. He was pleased with his meeting
 with Premier Zhao before the UN General Assembly
 meeting in October 1985, and senior Indian o,~cials
 characterized the atmosphere at the latest round of
 border talks as "the best ever."His conciliatory
 personal style has raised expectations in Beijing and
 led to improved relations with Washington and
 China probably is disappointed that Sino-Indian
 relations are moving forward so slowly. Beijing,
 however, appears pleased with Gandhi's efforts to
 improve India's relations with Pakistan, although
 Chinese officials have expressed dismay over New
 Delhi's recent toughening of its position on Kashmir.
 For example, a People's Daily article last year called
 the "moderating tendency" between New Delhi and
 Islamabad "gratifying." Chinese leaders were
 probably also heartened by Gandhi's carefully
 couched, but independent stand on foreign policy
 issues during his visit to Moscow last May. While
 moderating his language for the joint communique,
 Gandhi reiterated at a press conference in Moscow
 Indira Gandhi's position on Afghanistan that all
 outside powers should stop interfering. According to
 the US Embassy in New Delhi, the Indian Prime
 Minister also ignored Gorbachev's effort to promote
 the Brezhnev proposal for an Asian collective security
 Gandhi's hopes for Sino-Indian relations are
 tempered by the longstanding Indian distrust of
 China. New Delhi's suspicions stemlrom Beijing s
 supportlor Pakistan's nuclear and military
 programs, the Chinese invasion ollndia in 1962, and
 India's perception that China, Pakistan, and the
 United States together havelrequentlyfrustrated
 what it views as its legitimate ambitions in South
 Asia.
 Gandhi is in no hurry to achieve a breakthrough in
 Sino-Indian relations. Ultimately he hopes to work
 with China as an equal. Although Gandhi continues
 to move India into a position he views as more
 equidistant between the superpowers, he wants to
 determine the pace of those moves and will avoid
 ejlorts by Beijing to hurry the process. Moreover,
 Gandhi probably judges that improving relations with
 China will bring India Jew tangible economic.
 advantages. New Delhi does not view China as a
 potential source of high technology. Moreover, India
 sees China as a rival in the competition for
 concessionary loans and in export markets, not a
 potential trading partner.
 Sino-Pakistani Relations-Still Pivotal
 Beijing continues to regard Pakistan as the linchpin of
 its policy in South Asia and is determined to bolster,
 as best it can, Pakistan's ability to resist Soviet
 intimidation. In addition to political support and
 occasional economic assistance, China has supplied
 military equipment to Pakistan. We estimate that
 Beijing made a commitment to sell Pakistan more
 than $400 million worth of aircraft, boats, and
 assorted armament from 1980 to 1985.
 We believe Beijing's efforts to improve relations with
 New Delhi might cause Islamabad to worry about
 China's commitment to Pakistan's security. Any
 reduction in Chinese military assistance, however,
 probably reflects the growth of Islamabad's access to,
 and preference for, more sophisticated US weapon
 arrangement.

 systems rather than any holding back on Beijing's
 part. For example,
 Pakistan is considering reneging on an agreement
 reached in principle with China last year to purchase
 160 Chinese fighter aircraft modified with US
 avionics and engines. The Pakistani Air Force believes
 these Chinese aircraft-after modification-could
 cost more than the more desirable US F-20 fighters.
 China, for its part, has sought to reassure Pakistan of
 its continued commitment to provide arms.
 To allay Pakistan's fears, Beijing has promoted an
 exchange of high-level political and military visits this
 past year:
 ? In March, Chinese President Li Xiannian stopped in
 Karachi on his return to Beijing from a tour of
 several South Asian and African countries.
 Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq and Foreign
 Minister Yaqub Khan met with Li.
 ? Pakistan's Prime Minister Junejo traveled to China
 last November-his first foreign trip-where he
 met with Deng Xiaoping, Premier Zhao Ziyang,
 and President Li Xiannian. According to the US
 Embassy in Islamabad, the Chinese expressed
 support for Pakistan's stand on Afghanistan-that
 is, the issue should be resolved on the basis of the
 unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces.
 ? Last summer, Chinese Defense Minister Zhang
 Aiping visited Pakistan to discuss arms shipments
 and the military-political situation in South and
 Southwest Asia with President Zia, Foreign
 Minister Yaqub Khan, and Secretary General of
 Defense Rahimuddin Khan. This was the first time
 a Chinese defense minister had traveled to Pakistan.
 In addition, in December 1985, Pakistan received the
 first visit by the Chinese Navy to a foreign port since
 1949. This naval tour, which included port calls in Sri
 Lanka and Bangladesh, symbolized the close military
 as well as political relationship between China and
 Pakistan. China was also probably sending a message
 25X1
 to India
 25X1
 (that Beijing's desire for
 improved relations with New Delhi would not lessen
 its commitment to Pakistan's security.
 Prospects: Ahead Slowly
 We believe China will continue to press for better
 relations with India, but dramatic improvements are
 unlikely. China would like to see a Gandhi visit this
 year as a gesture of India's good faith, but, if Rajiv
 continues to insist on significant progress in the
 border negotiations first, such a visit is unlikely soon.
 China, meanwhile, will probably watch Gandhi
 closely during Soviet leader Gorbachev's visit to
 India, planned for later this year, looking for signs of
 change in India's attitude toward Moscow that it
 could exploit. Otherwise, the Chinese are likely to
 continue to urge Pakistan to resist Soviet pressures to
 deal directly with the Kabul government and to
 provide political and security support-in the form of
 economic and military aid-to buttress Pakistani
 security. China also will continue to encourage India
 and Pakistan to take steps to reduce tensions, making
 it easier for Beijing to mend its relationship with New
 Delhi while maintaining good relations with
 Islamabad.

 Nuclear Proliferation in
 South Asia: Implications for
 the United States
 Nuclear proliferation in South Asia will have
 profoundly disturbing implications for US security
 policy. Nuclear weapons in the hands of India and
 Pakistan would create the danger that a conventional
 war in the subcontinent could escalate to a nuclear
 war. Nuclear conflict in the subcontinent could spread
 to neighboring areas in the Middle East, draw in
 nuclear powers such as China or the Soviet Union,
 and even provoke a global crisis between the United
 States and the USSR.
 Apart from heightening the risks of nuclear war,
 nuclear proliferation in South Asia will endanger US
 security interests and increase the costs of
 maintaining US foreign and security policy objectives
 by:
 ? Injecting destabilizing factors into the US-Soviet
 strategic balance in the Indian Ocean region.
 ? Increasing the irritants, impediments, and
 uncertainties in US political and security
 relationships with key powers in the subcontinent
 and adjacent regions.
 ? Raising the costs to the United States of supporting
 effective diplomatic, political, and military options
 in response to regional conflict contingencies.
 ? Presenting new opportunities to the Soviet Union for
 direct military intervention and for the extension of
 its political and military influence in the region.
 ? Increasing the risks and multiplying the avenues for
 the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities to the
 Middle East and Southeast Asia, with destabilizing
 consequences in these regions.
 ? Endangering the effectiveness of the
 nonproliferation regime and damaging the
 credibility of global nonproliferation objectives.
 Factors in the Strategic Balance
 The strategic location of India and Pakistan makes
 conflict between them a matter of great sensitivity.
 Both are neighbors of China and near neighbors of the
 Soviet Union and the Middle Eastern oil states. India
 and, to a lesser extent, Pakistan could affect the
 pattern of superpower naval deployments in the
 Indian Ocean in a regional crisis or conflict.
 The nuclearization of India and Pakistan and the
 increased proliferation risks in adjacent regions are
 likely, over the long run, to damage the US position
 relatively more than the Soviet position in the regional
 balance of power because of the relatively greater
 likelihood for Soviet gain and US loss from situations
 of regional instability. Many pro-Western states, out
 of deepening anxieties or sense of alarm, may shed
 traditional inhibitions and become receptive to Soviet
 security support.
 Because the United States has to project power over a
 greater distance to maintain its position in the
 regional balance, its ability to conduct military
 operations will be more vulnerable to the effects of
 regional proliferation. As a result of nuclear risks,
 regional states may be intimidated, or at least more
 inhibited, from close military cooperation with the
 United States, including granting US access to
 facilities or territories for regional contingencies.
 Moreover, nuclear weapons in the hands of regional
 powers will increase the chance that US military
 forces or facilities in the region will be put at risk.
 Regional efforts to control nuclear weapons
 proliferation may affect US interests more than they
 do Soviet interests. Local states may be inclined, for
 instance, to support "nuclear-weapons-free zone"
 (NFZ) proposals designed to exclude the nuclear-
 capable forces of external powers. India and Pakistan
 as proliferating powers may be inclined to promote
 maritime NFZ concepts to restrict the size or
 movement of superpower naval forces in the Indian
 Ocean.

 Secret
 Most Soviet strategic and nuclear options in the
 region would remain essentially intact because such
 proposals would not affect Soviet ground and air
 forces in the southern USSR that are adjacent to the
 region. It is even likely that the USSR could
 genuinely support and politically exploit such
 proposals, currying local favor to the disadvantage of
 the United States.
 Political Relationships
 Many of the existing tensions and rivalries between
 regional powers will be intensified, new lines of
 conflict will emerge, and political and military
 instability in the region will be compounded. Progress
 in resolving the Indo-Pakistani rivalry in South Asia,
 and the Arab-Israeli, intra-Arab, and Islamic
 sectarian conflicts in the Middle East, will be much
 more difficult to achieve. Under these conditions the
 chances of resort to nuclear terrorism by local groups
 or organizations, and even by certain regional states,
 may increase geometrically.
 The increased anxieties of local states that feel
 threatened by Indian and Pakistani possession of
 nuclear weapons or by the prospect of their further
 spread in the adjacent regions will put greater
 demands on the United States (and on the Soviet
 Union) for security assistance. The United States will
 come under greater pressure to choose sides and give
 up some of its freedom of maneuver. This could make
 it more difficult for the United States to maintain its
 position in the US-Soviet regional balance.
 Nuclear proliferation could provoke stronger security
 ties between China and Pakistan and between India
 and the USSR as each country seeks to enhance its
 strategic partnerships against its principal rivals. This
 might entail Chinese support of the Pakistani 'nuclear
 program to tie down Indian military assets locally as
 much as possible. But it could also lead to Soviet
 support of the Indian nuclear program in return for
 India directing its longer range capabilities against
 Chinese rather than Soviet targets. These links would
 make it easier for nuclear conflict in the subcontinent
 to spread or escalate to the global level.
 Less likely, but a plausible alternative, would be for
 nuclear capabilities in South Asia to stimulate
 stronger Chinese efforts to achieve a rapprochement
 with the USSR to limit the dangers posed by an Indo-
 Soviet nuclear encirclement. Moscow might even find
 itself simultaneously courted by both India and
 China. In this case, the USSR might be able to
 assume the role of the principal outside factor in the
 Asian regional balance.
 Dangers of Soviet Military Intervention
 The nuclearization of the subcontinent will increase
 the chances of Soviet military intervention in the
 region. The pattern of Indo-Soviet arms transfer and
 security relations since the mid-1950s coupled with
 the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan indicate that the
 USSR is becoming more deeply involved in South
 Asian political and military affairs and is increasingly
 willing to apply military force. Nuclearization of the
 subcontinent will increase Soviet incentives to attempt
 to control the direction and pace of Indian and
 Pakistani military efforts and to shape security
 conditions in the region.
 The chances of direct Soviet military intervention in
 an Indo-Pakistani war increase if both states have
 nuclear weapons, especially if India appeals for Soviet
 military assistance to forestall an expected Pakistani
 nuclear strike. The Soviet temptation to intervene
 militarily could be reduced by strong opposition from
 a nuclear-armed India backed by credible
 demonstration of Indian willingness to engage Soviet
 military forces should they move into the subcontinent
 against India's will.
 The nuclearization of the subcontinent will increase
 Soviet incentives and also open Soviet opportunities
 for indirect intervention in peacetime. Moscow may
 hope, when circumstances allow, to mediate between
 India and Pakistan to expand influence in both
 countries simultaneously. In peacetime, Soviet efforts
 to "ride both horses" could lead to a more aggressive
 program of military arms deliveries both to Pakistan
 and India. The quantity and quality of Soviet arms
 transfers to Pakistan need not be the same as for India
 to be attractive to Islamabad.

 Secret
 The Soviets could also try to take advantage of Indian
 and Pakistani incentives to procure technically
 demanding and costly delivery systems, time-urgent
 warning systems, physical security measures, and
 suitable command and control systems for
 modernizing their nuclear forces. Provided discreetly,
 such assistance would be hard to distinguish from
 conventional military assistance. It would also lead to
 close defense production cooperation and could lead to
 intelligence and military cooperation and increased
 Soviet access to local military facilities.
 In the event of an Indo-Pakistani war, it is
 conceivable that Moscow would consider introducing
 limited forces of its own-probably on the side of
 India, but possibly on both sides-to deter either side
 from using nuclear weapons. Soviet pilots and
 technicians, for instance, could be stationed in
 sensitive military facilities to help man airborne and
 ground-based early warning systems, but with the
 implicit mission of restraining host state decisions to
 use nuclear weapons.
 Potential for US-Soviet Confrontation
 The increased probability of Soviet intervention in
 wartime in a nuclear South Asia implies increased
 risks of US-Soviet military confrontation. Although
 the United States and the USSR have increasingly
 sophisticated means of avoiding accidental military
 confrontations, the unpredictable behavior of other
 actors in the region---combined with local possession
 of nuclear weapons--could severely burden
 superpower crisis management capabilities. The risks
 of US-Soviet confrontation as a result of warfare in a
 nuclearized subcontinent would be greatly
 compounded, for example, by concurrent crises or
 outbreaks of major regional conflicts in the Persian
 Gulf, the Middle East, or Southeast Asia.
 Constraints and Opportunities for US Policy
 US influence over India and Pakistan to reduce the
 risks of outbreak of war or a nuclear conflict will be
 more difficult to exert after India and Pakistan have
 become nuclear armed. There will be new
 opportunities to exercise influence because of the
 reality of nuclear risks, the likelihood of felt needs on
 both sides to avoid nuclear conflict, and technical
 deficiencies that may be alleviated by help from
 external sources. There would be incentives in India
 and Pakistan (and perhaps also in China) to negotiate
 bilateral understandings with adversaries that would
 reduce the possibility of war because of misperception
 and miscalculation.
 The likelihood of Soviet exploitation of rival Indo-
 Pakistani procurement efforts that result from
 nuclear-armed conditions in the subcontinent will
 present special challenges for US policymaking. A
 nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India could
 be a matter of discussion between the United States
 and the Soviet Union on how best to assure that local
 nuclear incidents will not be misunderstood by either
 superpower as an action instigated or initiated by the
 other superpower.

 India:
 Pugjab Water-Sharing Issue
 Sharpens Sikh Dispute
 Allocation of river water from Punjab is an
 intractable but little-noticed issue in Sikh differences
 with New Delhi and neighboring Hindu majority
 states. Moreover, the predominantly moderate Sikh
 Akali Dal political party that controls the Punjab
 state government is concerned it could lose the
 support of Sikh farmers, dependent on irrigation from
 Punjab's rivers for their livelihood, to extremist Sikh
 elements if it fails to secure sufficient water resources.
 Meanwhile, the neighboring states of Haryana and
 Rajasthan, which are largely Hindu, have demanded
 that New Delhi protect their share of water drawn
 from Punjab's rivers.
 Punjab: Water Needs on the Rise
 Because Punjab is dependent on agriculture, the
 water-sharing issue is vital. Farming accounts for
 45 percent of the state's revenue and employs about
 65 percent of the population. As a result of extensive
 irrigation, approximately 83 percent of the state's
 land area is under cultivation. Three main rivers-the
 Sutlej, the Beas, and the Ravi-flow through the
 western part of the state, and underground water is
 also an important source of irrigation.
 Punjab's growing water requirements are making it
 reluctant to share its river water with more arid
 neighboring states. Punjab farmers fear that too much
 water will be siphoned from the state by two large
 irrigation projects-the 1,000-kilometer Rajasthan
 canal and the 70-kilometer Sutlej-Yamuna Link
 (SYL) canal-being constructed by the neighboring
 states and central government and that a decline in
 agricultural production will result in some parts of
 Punjab.
 9 meters between 1975 and 1984, according to press
 reports. We estimate declining ground water is
 threatening about one-quarter of Punjab's
 cultivated area.
 ? Efforts to boost output and farm income by
 employing multiple cropping and crop
 diversification techniques are increasing the
 demand for irrigation in Punjab.
 ? Canal construction will result in the loss of fertile
 land. For example, the SYL canal runs through
 some of Punjab's most fertile territory. Despite
 receiving compensation, farmers are seldom able to
 purchase new farms because of the scarcity of good
 land.
 ? Leakages from canals passing through Punjab are
 likely to result in the loss of additional land in
 cultivation. About 62 percent of the water carried
 by canal is lost through leakages that cause
 waterlogging and result in saline soil, according to
 the press.'
 Neighbor States Experience Water Shortages
 The neighboring predominantly Hindu states of
 Haryana and Rajasthan claim that, because they have
 limited water resources, the Punjabi river waters must
 be shared to meet their needs. In contrast to Punjab,
 Rajasthan has no perennial rivers, and Haryana has
 only one, the Yamuna, along its eastern border.
 Like Punjab, Haryana is heavily dependent on
 agriculture. Farming accounts for over 50 percent of
 the state's revenue and over 65 percent of its
 Additional factors reinforce the reluctance of
 Punjab's farmers to share their water resources:
 ? Punjab's excessive reliance on tube well irrigation
 has depleted ground water resources, prompting
 farmer demands for access to more river water. In
 some areas of Punjab the water table has declined
 ' Water losses from unlined channels amount to about 17 percent
 from main canals and their branches, 8 percent from distributaries,
 20 percent from water courses, and, because of evaporation, about
 17 percent in the field itself, according to the Indian press.

 employment. Haryana, however, does not have
 sufficient ground water or surface water available to
 sustain its extensive canal system, used to irrigate
 over 63 percent of its cultivated land. Attempts to
 increase agricultural output combined with the state's
 sometimes erratic rainfall have prompted Haryana
 authorities to urge New Delhi to double their share of
 Punjab's Ravi-Bess river system to 40 percent of the
 water available, according to press reports.
 Rajasthan is even more desperate than Haryana for
 additional water supplies. About a third of the state is
 desert. Rainfall is erratic, resulting in drought
 conditions approximately once every three years in its
 eastern region and once every two years in the western
 region. The state's rivers and underground water
 supplies are estimated to be meager.
 Boosting Rajasthan's agricultural output will depend
 on securing irrigation sources from outside the state-
 including Punjab. The Rajasthan canal, one of the
 most ambitious construction projects in the region, is
 designed to bring water from Punjab through
 Haryana and eventually to Rajasthan. Rajasthan
 officials claim that access to Punjabi river waters is a
 matter of life and death.
 New Delhi: Caught in the Middle
 New Delhi has appointed athree-man tribunal to
 apportion the waters. The tribunal's decision is due in
 late June and will be binding, according to Gandhi's
 public statements.
 The government, however, faces critical hurdles in the
 settlement of this issue. The tribunal will determine
 the distribution based on the amount of water used by
 the states on 1 July 1985. Each of the three states has
 accused the others of submitting falsified figures on
 water usage, according to the press.
 Because Punjab's farmers are predominantly Sikh
 and Haryana and Rajasthan farmers are Hindu, the
 religious factor complicates the already politicized
 water-sharing issue. If the tribunal decides in favor of
 Punjab, the Hindus in neighboring states will
 probably perceive Prime Minister Gandhi as giving in
 to Sikh demands. A decision in favor of Punjab's
 neighboring states will alienate Sikh farmers, who
 constitute the power base for the moderate Punjab
 government. Should the Sikh farmers view New
 Delhi's policies as threatening their livelihood, they
 could well swing their support to extremist Sikh
 organizations, bring down the provincial government,
 and leave Delhi with a major security problem.
 Outlook
 The tribunal probably will reallocate the waters in
 favor of Punjab but compensate Haryana and
 Rajasthan with financial aid. Such a decision would
 minimize extremist gains among moderate Sikh
 farmers. The financial aid to Haryana and Rajasthan
 would have to be generous to avoid the loss of support
 for the Congress Party.

 from Indian-backed candidates and banned opposition
 parties eager for reform, but the fragmented
 opposition appears unable to mount a sustained
 campaign against the monarchy. Despite a series of
 bombings in Nepal last June, antimonarchy
 extremists based in India have shown no signs of using
 the election as a rallying point for future terrorist
 action, and election violence is unlikely to go beyond
 thuggery among rival candidates. Still, the election
 will probably increase India's influence in Nepal.
 independent political backing could win the Prime
 Minister's post against Birendra's wishes by forcing
 the King to bow to popular pressure. Moreover,
 irendra
 believes an independent political figure in the
 Assembly would invite Indian or Chinese backing,
 posing a threat to the monarchy and Nepalese
 sovereignty.
 The National Assembly is the only sanctioned forum
 for antigovernment dissent and is a magnet for
 Nepal's fragmented opposition. To spur reform some
 members of banned political parties are willing to
 renounce their formal party affiliation to gain an
 Assembly seat. We believe politicians within the
 nonparty system consider an Assembly seat the best
 way to gain access to the palace and also necessary for
 Nepalese Politics
 Nepal is a constitutional monarchy with all
 significant political power exercised by the throne. A
 140-member National Assembly-the Rastriya
 Panchayat-is elected every five years from which the
 King appoints a Prime Minister and a Cabinet. The
 Constitution permits the King to nominate
 28 members to the Assembly, a provision granting
 him an automatic core of support. The remaining
 112 candidates are elected independently from
 75 districts. Political parties are banned, making
 caste, financial resources, and ethnic on i' g n key
 determinants of a candidate's success.
 The Assembly election is the centerpiece of royally
 sanctioned political reform in Nepal. The Assembly is
 an important forum linking the King and key palace
 advisers to the concerns of the Nepalese electorate.
 Representatives to the National Assembly, however,
 cannot block political initiatives from the palace and
 perform only routine legislative functions at the
 behest of the King.
 The US Embassy in Kathmandu reports Birendra
 fears any strong Assembly member building an
 independent popular base. An Assembly member with
 building popular opposition to the King.
 The Banned Parties
 Banned political parties are struggling to retain their
 membership and political relevance in Nepal's
 nonparty system. A referendum sponsored by King
 Birendra in 1980 rejected opposition demands for
 legalization of political parties.
 Press and Embassy reporting indicates the banned
 Nepali Congress Party (NCP) is the strongest member
 of Nepal's weak opposition and represents the only
 serious threat to the monarchy. The NCP claims to be
 the majority party of Nepal and is the only party to
 have formed a government during Nepal's brief
 experiment in 1959 with multiparty democracy. The
 party has built a national network but has split into
 three factions and, despite two decades of protest, has
 been unable to force King Birendra to lift his ban. For
 Birendra, the NCP's rhetoric is little more than an
 unwelcome reminder of his refusal to speed up
 political reform in Nepal.

 The Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) is very small
 and does not represent a viable political alternative.
 the CPN-though
 arxist in ideology-is strongly nationalist and not
 responsive to either Moscow or Beijing. We believe
 there is little public sympathy for Communism as an
 ideology, especially in the conservative, tradition-
 bound countryside where most Nepalese live. The
 CPN's only access to political power in Nepal has
 come through fielding candidates with no formal
 party affiliation for election to the National
 Assembly.
 Birendra's Election Strategy
 The Assembly election will serve as the first test in
 five years of Nepalese support for Birendra's nonparty
 system, and,                             palace
 and government officials want the election to appear
 representative of all Nepalese political interests.
 Birendra is eager for opposition participation and a
 heavy voter turnout to mute calls at home and abroad
 for more rapid political liberalization. Although
 Birendra would welcome participation by NCP
 members, he is unwilling to ease his ban on political
 parties and will accept only NCP candidates who
 swear allegiance to the nonparty system.
 Birendra will also try to use the election to consolidate
 his power. Birendra established a special election fund
 to provide as much as $24,000 each to selected
 Assembly candidates
 As the wealthiest backer of candidates, Birendra is
 well positioned to develop his core of support in the
 Nonetheless, Birendra's tightly held election fund
 suggests he is reluctant to share patronage with other
 members of the royal family who might try to develop
 their own followings in the Assembly.
 Birendra's heavyhanded efforts to control the election
 have run into trouble
 Birendra's candidates could face an uphill battle
 against candidates. backed by India, the NCP, or the
 Communists, but we believe the Kin  has the
 resources           to raise
 enough money for his candidates to counter outside
 support.

 In our view, opposition leaders will find

 undermine some of Birendra's support in urban areas.
 A government decision to devalue the Nepalese rupee
 last November may hurt promonarchy candidates.
 The devaluation sparked sharp price rises on Nepal's
 consumer goods-principally imported from India-
 and led to widespread but ineffective strikes organized
 by the NCP. The US Embassy in Kathmandu reports
 the most rapid price rises and public protests had
 subsided by the end of February, suggesting
 Birendra's candidates may be able to sidestep the
 issue during the election.

 The Role of Outsiders
 The election is giving New Delhi new opportunities to
 expand its already considerable influence in Nepal.
 the growing influence
 of former Prime Minister S. B. Thapa-New Delhi's
 principal advocate in Nepal-since 1980 has greatly
 increased Indian influence in Nepalese politics. Senior
 politicians believe 45 to 65 Assembly candidates are
 pro-Indian and will receive funds from Thapa or
 directly from New Delhi. Birendra would be reluctant
 to appoint Thapa prime minister, but New Delhi
 probably hopes the King will be forced to elevate
 Thapa if he and his candidates win broad support in
 the election.

 secret
 The strength of Thapa and his following has fueled
 longstanding palace fears of Indian subversion.
 Birendra has
 appointed teams of palace observers to collect
 information on all candidates for the National
 Assembly. The King is particularly eager for
 information on leftist candidates-most of whom are
 strongest in the Terai-whom he suspects are likely to
 receive New Delhi's backing. Birendra has also
 ordered his observers to make public speeches calling
 for voter patriotism and loyalty to the monarchy-a
 move designed to tap strong nationalist sentiment
 among rural Nepalese.
 New Delhi's activities are causing concern in Beijing,
 underscoring Nepal's role as a buffer between the
 regional powers.
 China most likely views former
 Prime Minister Thapa not only as a vehicle of Indian
 interests in Nepal but also as a potential successor to
 Birendra should the monarchy fall.
 Outlook
 The most important result of the election is likely to
 be the enhancement of New Delhi's political influence
 in Nepal. New Delhi's financial backing of Thapa and
 his proteges could lead to a Thapa victory. In such a
 case, Birendra would have little choice but to share
 more power with Thapa, giving India greater
 influence in Nepalese internal affairs.
 A Thapa victory would also provide Birendra with a
 strong endorsement of Nepal's nonparty system.
 Although Thapa's Indian ties are a threat to Birendra,
 his willingness to seek election on the King's terms
 lends legitimacy to the nonparty system. His victory
 would demonstrate the system's ability to incorporate
 opponents of the King and help vindicate Birendra's
 claim that no immediate liberalization is necessary.
 Over the long term, Birendra may have to choose
 between preserving a nonparty system that gives New
 Delhi a foothold in Nepal or risking political
 liberalization.
 The failure of King Birendra to include the NCP in
 the election will most likely intensify opposition
 demands for political reform. Although some young
 members of the NCP may choose to participate in the
 election on Birendra's terms, we doubt this will be
 enough to mute the NCP's demands for its return to
 Nepal's political mainstream. The NCP and
 Communist factions are likely to organize strikes and
 further agitate as the election draws near. In our view,
 however, the King has adequate support among
 Nepalese-even in the Terai-to thwart attempts at
 widespread disruption.
