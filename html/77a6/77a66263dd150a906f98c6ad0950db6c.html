 Key Judgments      One of the most troublesome side effects of China's five-year experiment
 Information available with economic reform has been Beijing's perception that it has lost control

 extended debate within the party in 1981 and 1982 over the need for
 reform versus the need for tighter central planning. Proponents of reform
 prevailed, in part by advocating the use of fiscal and monetary tools to con-
 trol aggregate demand.
 Beijing has been forced to make major institutional changes to facilitate
 the use of fiscal and monetary policy. The moves have enabled the
 government to restore a measure of control over the economy and, hence,
 are partially responsible for Beijing's recent decision to push ahead with
 new economic reforms. In the wake of new efforts to decentralize
 decisionmaking authority, we expect several fiscal and monetary tools to
 become even more important over the next few years:
 ? Bonds and foreign borrowing to finance budget deficits.
 ? Major experimentation with new taxes and changing tax rates.
 ? Establishment of a competitive banking system and increased reliance on
 bank loans instead of budgetary allotments.
 ? Active control of the money supply, probably by the newly established
 Central Bank Council.
 Several of China's top leaders-including Politburo members Zhao
 Ziyang, Hu Yaobang, and Wan Li-have staked their careers on resolving
 China's economic problems. Although the reforms they promoted helped
 improve overall economic performance somewhat, serious problems re-
 main. Much of the waste and inefficiency still present in the industrial
 sector stems from China's irrational price system, and demand-
 management tools are particularly unsuited for dealing with price prob-
 lems. Because conservative critics are quick to attack shortcomings, the
 leadership is under pressure either to achieve improved results or abandon
 the controversial reforms. If Beijing continues to eschew major price
 reform, we believe it could become disenchanted with the results of
 industrial reform and may be forced-perhaps as early as 1986-to resume
 tighter central control.

 China: Turning to
 Fiscal and Monetary
 Policy F---]
 Since the watershed Third Plenum of the 11th Cen-
 tral Committee in 1978, China has been involved in
 an unprecedented experiment with economic reform.
 In an effort to eliminate the tremendous waste and
 inefficiency that characterized the economy since the
 1950s, Beijing began to push decisionmaking author-
 ity-once reserved for central planners-to local en-
 terprises. It also promoted competition and loosened
 control to stimulate profit-oriented performance. The
 experiments, though limited, represent a major turn-
 around for what had been one of the world's most
 tightly controlled, egalitarian economies
 would enable them to assert direct control over aggre-
 gate demand' and avoid a recurrence of the economic
 disasters that had plagued the Kuomintang regime.
 Under that regime, sharp increases in consumer and
 investor spending-fueled by the printing of money to
 cover government spending-sparked a period of hy-
 perinflation. To avoid this and all other cyclical
 fluctuations in economic activity, a tightly controlled
 system was designed:
 ? Private enterprises were controlled, then turned into
 state-owned units.
 Although the devolution of decisionmaking authority
 spurred productivity-at least in agriculture-it also
 left Beijing with sharply diminished control over
 macroeconomic behavior. Consumer and investor de-
 mand spurted, straining raw material and energy
 supplies and putting strong upward pressure on prices.
 Fierce competition in the foreign trade sector also
 created damaging price pressures. Faced with drop-
 ping the reforms or finding other control mechanisms,
 Beijing began adopting variations of fiscal and mone-
 tary policies used in the West.
 This paper briefly describes the tightly controlled,
 centrally planned economy that Deng Xiaoping and
 his fellow pragmatists inherited, shows the degree of
 control that was lost when reforms were introduced,
 and highlights the fiscal and monetary measures
 taken to reassert control. The paper also assesses the
 preliminary results of monetary and fiscal policies, as
 well as some remaining problems that are not resolv-
 able using monetary and fiscal policy.
 Direct Control-The Legacy of Mao
 The Chinese Communists spent much of their first
 few years in power systematically dismantling the
 existing market-oriented system and replacing it with
 a planned economy modeled after that of the Soviet
 Union. Chinese economists hoped that central plan-
 ning, aside from meeting their ideological needs,
 ? Land was redistributed, then collectivized in 1955-
 56, then communes formed in 1958.
 ? Prices were rigidly fixed (producer goods artificially
 high, consumer goods low) to promote industrial
 production and to prevent inflation.
 ? The currency (renminbi) was made inconvertible,
 and the Ministry of Foreign Trade monopolized all
 imports and exports to insulate China from fluctua-
 tions in aggregate demand caused by international
 trade.
 ? Investment was incorporated into the planning proc-
 ess, with the state determining both the quantity
 and direction of most investment.
 ' Aggregate demand refers to the total demand for goods and
 services produced in a given economy. In simple mathematical
 terms, the equation most often used to express aggregate demand is:
 Y = C + I + G + (X - M). That is, aggregate demand for a coun-
 try's total output (Y) can be broken into four component parts:
 consumption (C), investment (I), government expenditure (G), and
 net foreign trade-exports (X) minus imports (M). For a market
 economy, C, I, X, and M are commonly regarded as subject to the
 whims of private behavior; only G is under direct government
 control. For a planned economy, the state monopolizes virtually all
 industrial, commercial, and financial activity. Only C is considered

 ? The use of cash was restricted. Enterprises were
 forced to conduct most of their business through
 account transfers at state banks.
 ? Private consumption was regulated by wage and
 price controls, commodity-rationing schemes and
 forced savings, and denial of consumer credit. Infla-
 tionary pressures showed up not as higher official
 prices, but as longer queues.
 Inefficiency-The Iron Rice Bowl
 Although the economy recovered sharply and per-
 formed well during the early stages of Communist
 rule, major problems began to surface in the late
 1950s and worsened throughout the following two
 decades. When Beijing abandoned market pricing and
 assumed the job of allocating resources, it introduced
 tremendous inefficiencies. Resources began to move
 where they were directed, not where they were need-
 ed. Political clout-not efficiency-determined the
 direction of flow. The government's emphasis on
 increasing output at all costs led firms to produce
 large quantities of unwanted, unusable goods. Maoist
 egalitarian principles prevented factory managers
 from rewarding quality work or firing unproductive
 labor. Because factories were required to pay the
 salaries of employees they laid off, few workers were
 let go under any circumstance. This "iron rice
 bowl"-guaranteed income and employment regard-
 less of performance-has been the factor most often
 cited to explain the waste and inefficiency that has
 become inherent in the Chinese system. The leftist
 leadership under Mao viewed these economic prob-
 lems as necessary, acceptable costs of ideological
 purity.
 Economic Reforms: Efficiency at a Price
 As Deng Xiaoping and his pragmatic followers con-
 solidated their power, it became increasingly clear
 that one of their top priorities would be to attack this
 inefficiency. Since 1978 they have introduced a series
 of "economic reforms," the basic thrust of which has
 been to decentralize decisionmaking authority, giving
 local government and enterprise managers greater
 autonomy, but also making them responsible for
 profits and losses. Rather than a comprehensive pro-
 gram carried out in stages, the reforms came as a
 series of groping experiments. Various proposals have
 been implemented, sometimes nationwide, sometimes
 The Bonus System: Trial-and-Error Reform
 The implementation of the bonus system serves as a
 useful example of Beijing's groping approach to
 economic reform. In 1979, in an effort to spur
 productivity, Beijing gave enterprise managers au-
 thority to distribute bonuses to their workforce.
 Instead of using the bonus system to reward meritori-
 ous performance and enhance incentives, however,
 managers-many of whom achieved their positions
 during the Cultural Revolution as a result of their
 political orthodoxy-distributed bonuses in egalitar-
 ian fashion, across the board. Xinhua complained
 that in 1981, even after some factories were closed
 down, their unemployed workers continued to draw
 their full wages and bonuses. The result of this
 misuse of bonuses was constant or even declining
 productivity and sharp upward pressure on prices.
 Beijing responded in 1982 by curbing the amount of
 retained earnings available for bonuses and by issu-
 ing orders that payments were not to exceed produc-
 tivity gains. This year, however, provincial authori-
 ties successfully pressured Beijing into allowing
 enterprises more autonomy. Rather than setting up-
 per limits on bonuses, Beijing now applies a progres-
 sive tax on these payments. There is no penalty for a
 yearend bonus amounting to less than two and a half
 months' wages. Enterprises awarding bonuses larger
 than the equivalent of six months' wages, however,
 will be required to pay four times that amount in
 taxes
 only regionally. Where a specific reform was deemed
 effective, it was widely promoted. Where Beijing
 believed a reform created more problems, it was
 curbed.
 Although the reform program remains controversial,
 almost all sectors of the economy have been affected:
 ? Agriculture. Over three-fourths of the land is now
 under effective control-though not legal owner-
 ship-of peasant households.'

 ? Industry. Enterprises that formerly remitted all but
 a small share of their profits now retain a much
 larger share, which, with limitations, they may use
 to pay bonuses, fund welfare programs, or invest in
 new facilities.
 ? Finance. Provincial governments now have greater
 discretion in spending locally generated revenues.
 ? Commerce. Free markets have reappeared with
 official blessing, and enterprises are permitted to
 sell some of their products outside the government-
 run commercial system.
 ? Banking. Loans are gradually replacing government
 grants as sources of fixed and working capital.
 ? Foreign Trade. Beijing has allowed some provincial-
 and municipal-level organizations to conduct their
 own trade and has established four special economic
 zones with freedom to trade and accept foreign
 investment.'
 ? Private enterprise. Individuals may now establish
 small businesses employing up to five "helpers or
 apprentices."
 Losing Control-Reform's Weak Link
 By reintroducing competition and profit-maximizing
 behavior-crushing the iron rice bowl-Beijing hoped
 to capture the efficiency of the marketplace while
 retaining the benefits of planning. In the agricultural
 sector, at least, the results have been satisfactory (see
 table 1). For example, the combined effect of higher
 farm prices, increased individual incentives, and good
 weather boosted the value of agricultural output at an
 average annual rate of nearly 8 percent during 1979-
 83. With each step forward in reform, however,
 Beijing gave up another element of control over
 investment and foreign trade decisions and thus
 opened the door to potentially damaging fluctuations
 in aggregate demand. The problem was exacerbated
 by the indiscriminate payment of bonuses and in-
 creased procurement prices for agricultural products,
 both of which pumped cash into the household sector.
 The increased household income gave Beijing further
 cause for concern about rising consumer demand.
 ' Although Beijing has made several attempts over the past two
 years to recentralize trade, it still exerts much less control than it

 (1974-78)   (1979-83)
 a Prereform data are averages for 1965-78, reform-era data are for
 1978-82.
 Evidence of Beijing's gradual diminution of control
 was most clearly reflected in investment trends (see
 figure 1). In 1978, nearly 85 percent of total invest-
 ment in capital construction was funded through the
 state budget, but that share fell to less than 50 percent
 in 1982. The bulk of extrabudgetary investment came
 from local governments and enterprises using retained
 earnings or funds borrowed from banks. The initial
 1982 plan called for a 10-percent reduction in total
 capital construction investment; yearend results
 showed instead a 25-percent increase to 55.6 billion
 yuan. More than 28 billion yuan came through extra-
 budgetary avenues, a 45-percent increase over 1981.
 The projects that local enterprises financed out of
 extrabudgetary investment siphoned off construction
 materials such as cement, steel, and glass that the
 government needed to carry out work on priority
 infrastructure projects. And once completed, many of
 these locally financed projects began competing for
 raw materials needed by larger, more efficient state-
 run enterprises.
 Burgeoning budget deficits were further evidence of
 Beijing's problems with control. After registering

 small surpluses in 1977 and 1978, expenditures ex-
 ceeded revenues by a record 21 billion yuan in 1979.'
 Although Beijing was able to reduce the size of
 succeeding deficits, the budget remained in the red a
 total of 28 billion yuan between 1979 and 1982.
 Subsidies jumped an estimated 390 percent between
 1978 and 1982 as Beijing boosted agricultural pro-
 curement prices (in an effort to improve rural living
 standards) while holding the line on retail food prices
 (to avoid cutting into urban consumption). By 1982,
 government subsidies outweighed capital construction
 as a share of the total budget.
 `The figures given in this paper have been modified by the IMF to
 meet standard Western accounting practices and hence differ from
 official Chinese statistics. Beijing includes domestic and foreign
 borrowing as revenue items, while Western practice is to exclude
 them from budgetary calculations and consider them, instead, as
 means of financing a given deficit. On the expenditure side, Chinese
 Revenue shortfalls increased the deficit. Enterprises,
 exercising their decisionmaking authority, found ways
 to avoid remitting profits to the government by over-
 stating costs, giving across-the-board wage bonuses,
 and understating actual revenues. The drop in net
 profit remittances from state enterprises was unex-
 pectedly sharp, from over 51 percent of total revenue
 in 1978, to only 29 percent in 1982.
 In the foreign trade sector, Beijing saw its control
 wane because of reform. Provincial and municipal
 authorities engaged in open bidding wars for foreign
 business. Hard currency losses from the price compe-
 tition were large, perhaps as much as $1 billion in
 1981 alone. The Ministry of Foreign Trade watched
 from the sideline as its newly adopted policy of

 avoiding duplicate purchases of expensive Western
 equipment-by acquiring the technology and repro-
 ducing it domestically-was ignored by enthusiastic
 local traders. Instead, under the reforms, several
 enterprises willingly laid out the foreign exchange
 necessary to acquire the equipment directly from the
 West. Hence, Beijing began to see inventories build in
 distinctive cyclical pattern of rapid advance and
 measured retrenchment.'
 its own machine tool industry.
 The unanticipated surge in aggregate demand put
 strong upward pressure on prices. Official prices in
 China are generally allowed to rise only 2 to 3 percent
 per year to bolster Beijing's claim of no inflation, but
 evidence suggests that, in fact, rates were much
 higher after reform. For example, late last year
 ing black market" was evidence of China's suppressed
 inflation. Moreover, Guangdong Province published
 figures that, though undoubtedly understating the
 level of inflation, probably give an accurate indication
 of the trends. The provincial paper reported that
 commodity prices rose at annual rates of 3, 8.5, and
 2.3 percent in 1980, 1981, and 1982, respectively. The
 pressure prompted Beijing to issue "Provisional Regu-
 lations Governing Price Control" in August 1982. The
 regulations restated which product prices were still
 subject to strict state control and set the limits on
 fluctuations for most other prices. In May 1983 a
 circular reemphasized the main theme of price con-
 trol, while in mid-1983 new sanctions were issued
 against unauthorized price increases.
 Although some reform economists had foreseen the
 development of such problems and had advocated
 simultaneous adoption of new tools to control aggre-
 gate demand, the regime was hesitant, largely for
 political reasons. On the one hand, the reforms had
 not proved their economic value decisively, and plan-
 ners were concerned about introducing too much
 change too fast. On the other hand, a fierce debate
 was raging within the party during 1981-82 over the
 need for reform versus the need for tighter control
 over economic behavior. Party conservatives, led by
 Chen Yun, favored a more comprehensive planning
 process and somewhat less reliance on the market as
 means to reassert economic control. The pragmatists,
 on the other hand, advocated an expansion of the
 reforms. At times, this debate brought reform nearly
 to a standstill and gave Chinese economic policy a
 Gradually, the reformers were able to convince the
 rest of the leadership that fiscal and monetary policies
 as practiced in the West offered improved control over
 macroeconomic behavior without cutting gains in
 productivity.
 A Shortage of Demand-Management Tools
 The use of demand-management tools posed two
 major obstacles for the reformers. In the first place,
 lack of experience meant Beijing had no idea how
 sensitive aggregate demand would be to various fiscal
 and monetary instruments. More importantly, most
 instruments commonly used for demand-management
 in market economies were not even available to
 Chinese planners in the early 1980s.
 The principal weapons of discretionary fiscal policy
 are government expenditure and tax rates. In China,
 though, government spending was viewed as only one
 part of the overall economic plan. Hence, government
 expenditure by itself was not viewed as a tool to
 mitigate unemployment or price pressures. Nor could
 Beijing rely on tax policy as even a long-term fiscal
 instrument. Until 1982, state enterprises remitted
 virtually all their profits to either central or local
 governments.'
 Beijing did have some success in the 1950s using
 government bonds to ease aggregate demand pres-
 sures. When China entered the Korean war in 1950, it
 issued 250 million yuan in war bonds to dampen
 consumer demand in the wake of sharp increases in
 government spending. "Economic construction
 bonds"-2.5 billion yuan worth-served the same
 purpose between 1954 and 1958, offsetting a sharp

 purchases were to be voluntary, in practice the party

 The fact that Chinese workers viewed bonds as just
 another tax was probably the major reason Beijing
 abandoned their use in 1958.
 Not one of the traditional monetary tools available to
 market economies-direct control of money in circu-
 lation, manipulation of reserve requirements, or
 changing interest rates-was available to Chinese
 policymakers. The volume of currency in circulation
 was a reflection of the plan. Hence, monetary policy
 was passive in the sense that it was not altered to
 offset fluctuations in aggregate demand. Money in
 circulation depended heavily on the government's
 policy toward households-the only sector relying
 heavily on cash to carry out day-to-day transactions.
 Increases in wages, bonuses, or purchases of products
 from the household sector all increased the amount of
 currency in circulation. Periodic campaigns to encour-
 age savings reversed the flow.' All, however, were to a

 also capable of altering the amount of currency in circulation. The
 former has, periodically, been a major concern for policymakers.
 large degree determined at the time of the plan and
 not altered to meet cyclical fluctuations.
 The rapid growth of currency in circulation at the
 outset of the reform movement-26 percent in 1979
 and 29 percent in 1980-reflected changing govern-
 ment priorities rather than an expansive monetary
 policy. The decision to improve the lot of the Chinese
 consumer by increasing agricultural procurement
 prices and urban wages contributed to sizable budget
 deficits, which in those years were financed by the
 People's Bank of China. The substantial injections of
 currency into the economy were not fully offset by
 withdrawal of currency through sales of commodities
 by state commercial departments, inflows into savings
 deposits, service trade income, agricultural credit
 repayments, or income from taxation.
 Nor were banking authorities able to control credit
 expansion. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76),
 China's banking system was reduced to little more
 than a cashier/ accountant for the Ministry of Fi-
 nance. Budgetary allocations were deposited in state
 banks and funds drawn as required. Even when
 credits demanded were above planned levels, it was
 generally true that well-explained applications for
 credit-short or long term-were always accepted.
 The only major check on the amount an enterprise
 could borrow has been the stigma of not meeting the
 exact terms of the plan.
 Interest rates, like most official prices in China, went
 almost unchanged from 1965 to 1978. Even if they
 had fluctuated with world rates, however, their im-
 pact on borrowing-and hence on aggregate de-
 mand-would probably have been negligible. The
 restrictive power of rising interest rates stems from
 the additional costs that these rates impose on borrow-
 ing enterprises. In China, the influence of subsidies,
 easy access to credit, and the central government's
 emphasis on output almost regardless of cost all
 ensure that-in a financial sense-true investment
 failure is rare. Higher interest rates also do little to
 encourage industrial savings. Chinese firms generally
 believe it is more important to expand capacity, even
 at a lower rate of return, than to earn interest on
 savings deposits.

 Wage and price controls played an important role in
 regulating aggregate demand during the past two
 decades. These controls were directed at the rural and
 urban household sectors. One of Beijing's major con-
 cerns has been that a sudden increase in consumer
 spending would drive domestic prices upward. By
 holding agricultural prices relatively constant from
 the 1950s to the late 1970s, Beijing prevented surges
 in the amount of currency circulating in rural sectors
 and, hence, was able to curb excess demand. Wage
 controls did the same in urban areas. The controls
 were a major factor in holding the line against
 inflation. When Beijing opted in 1979 and 1980 to
 relax wage and price controls in an effort to improve
 consumer welfare, it gave up, temporarily, one of its
 most effective demand-management tools
 At the outset of the reform movement, Beijing at-
 tempted to control aggregate demand using the only
 powerful fiscal tool in its arsenal-government spend-
 . ing. Government investment in capital construction
 was held flat in 1979 and then slashed 17 percent in
 1980 and 28 percent the following year in an attempt
 to curb mounting inflationary pressure. Defense ex-
 penditures-after rising sharply in 1979 to finance
 the war with Vietnam-were also cut in 1980 and
 1981. Beijing attempted to use moral suasion-
 threats against disobedient enterprises-to curb ex-
 trabudgetary expenditure by domestic firms. Govern-
 ment threats proved fairly successful in 1979, proba-
 bly because local enterprises were unsure how hard
 Beijing might respond to disobedience. But when it
 became clear that the government was anxious to
 move ahead with reform and would not clamp down,
 extrabudgetary investment doubled to about 20 billion
 yuan in 1980 and 1981, then hit 28 billion yuan in
 1982.
 Beijing also used control over the foreign trade sector
 to reduce potential capital outlays and hence lessen
 pressure on aggregate demand. In 1979 and again in
 1981, Chinese officials refused to approve billions of
 dollars worth of turnkey plant contracts that its
 foreign trade corporations had signed with Western
 firms. Part of the motivation for the suspensions was
 to ease mounting balance-of-payments problems, but
 Beijing was also attempting to reduce domestic budg-
 et outlays. For each dollar spent on imported equip-
 ment, Beijing claimed that it had to lay out approxi-
 mately 4 yuan (the equivalent of US $2) for
 infrastructure projects, wages, and other local costs.
 By refusing to honor the import contracts immediate-
 ly, Beijing postponed capital expenditures of more
 than 10 billion yuan.
 The attempt to relieve pressure by cutting back
 government investment proved less than totally effec-
 tive. In the first place, reductions were offset by other
 government outlays. Subsidies, for example, rose 21.6
 billion yuan between 1979 and 1982, more than
 offsetting the 21.2-billion-yuan decline in government
 spending for capital construction. Furthermore, by
 withdrawing resources from much-needed infrastruc-
 ture projects, government investment cutbacks may
 have adversely affected China's future growth poten-
 tial. The share of total expenditure allocated to key
 projects dropped from 42 percent in 1978 to 30
 percent in 1982.
 Recognizing the deficiencies in its initial attempts at
 demand-management, Beijing tried other fiscal meas-
 ures. In 1981, Beijing returned to the practice of
 issuing government bonds. It sold nearly 5 billion
 yuan in treasury bonds to state and collectively owned
 units almost entirely on an involuntary basis. As they
 had in the 1950s, the bonds once again proved useful
 fiscal tools for slowing aggregate demand. With the
 funds siphoned from enterprises, the government cov-
 ered a portion of its ongoing budget deficits without
 resorting to inflationary printing of money. At the
 same time, the bonds crowded out extrabudgetary
 investment that almost certainly would have occurred
 had the enterprises been allowed to retain their full
 profits. More recently, Beijing also used the bonds to
 help curb increasing consumer demand. About half of
 the 4 billion yuan in bonds issued in 1982 and again in
 1983 went to individuals and half to organizations.
 The former, purchase of which is voluntary, carry an
 8-percent annual interest rate; the latter, only 4
 percent.'
 BAs in the 1950s, Beijing has again taken pains to emphasize that
 the bonds are to be issued on a voluntary basis. Nevertheless,
 considerable pressure sometimes goes into these "voluntary" pur-

 By far the most difficult fiscal reform attempted was
 replacing the system of profit remittances with a
 system of profit taxation. The new program was
 designed to raise government revenue, to put more
 pressure on losing enterprises by ending automatic
 subsidies, and to encourage other enterprises to earn
 higher profits on the understanding that these would
 be shared with the tax authorities rather than confis-
 cated. China introduced a nationwide, eight-tier tax
 structure in June 1983. Small enterprises with annual
 income of less than 300 yuan were taxed at 7 percent,
 while large and medium-sized state enterprises (those
 with annual incomes in excess of 80,000 yuan) fell
 into the highest bracket and were taxed at 55 percent
 of profit. A special "adjustment tax" was also levied
 to tax away special advantages that certain enter-
 prises enjoyed as a result of irrational prices, new
 technology, location advantages, and so on. Any profit
 the state deemed as a windfall-not directly attribut-
 able to efficient operation-was subjected to the
 higher tax. Beijing intends to phase out this adjust-
 ment tax over time, but at present it has cut retained
 earnings to the point that, according to a recent
 Chinese publication, state enterprises remitted 83
 percent of total profits to taxes in 1983.9
 More recently, the state has decided to increase its
 share of the pie by introducing other taxes. In October
 1983, Beijing levied a 10-percent tax on extrabudg-
 etary capital construction expenditures. The tax is
 intended to discourage unwanted investment and, at
 the same time, to help finance the central govern-
 ment's major infrastructure projects. Other taxes
 being tried experimentally include taxes on fixed
 assets and circulating capital and on value added in
 production. Surcharges have been levied against in-
 ventories to discourage the production of unwanted
 merchandise. A user tax on crude oil was introduced
 in July 1982 to encourage enterprises to burn coal.F_
 Revenue collection has also been strengthened. An
 Office of General Financial Inspection was estab-
 lished in mid-1983 to audit units nationwide and
 crack down on tax fraud. By early 1984, more than
 190,000 auditors had been mobilized to spot-check a
 9 During 1979-82, when selected regions were experimenting with
 tax reform without an adjustment factor, the Chinese reported that
 some enterprises retained as much as 70 percent of profits. Beijing
 was clearly unwilling to give enterprises this much latitude over
 third of the nation's enterprises and establishments.
 Violations amounting to 3.5 billion yuan were discov-
 ered, 1.9 billion of which were owed to the state. F_
 Although still in its early stages, the tax reform
 program is already creating problems. In an effort to
 increase its revenues, the steepest adjustment tax has
 been applied to the most profitable enterprises-a
 practice Beijing refers to as "whipping the fast ox."
 As a result, some firms now retain less than 5 percent
 of total profits, making it difficult for them to award
 bonuses or to acquire needed technology. The firms
 probably benefiting most from the new system are the
 few that remain outside it. The Ministry of Metallur-
 gy, which has been allowed to set its own guidelines,
 adopted a "profit responsibility system," where each
 factory remits a fixed quota to the state and retains
 the remainder as its profits. Some firms reportedly
 retain as much as 80 percent of profits under this
 system.
 Making Monetary Policy an Option
 Banking
 Perhaps the most convincing evidence of China's
 willingness to experiment with market-oriented
 demand-management tools has been its reform of the
 banking system. Although use of fiscal tools required
 innovative policy moves, monetary reform involved
 major institutional rebuilding. Over the past four
 years, Beijing has been setting up a network of
 commercial and industrial banks to relieve the Peo-
 ple's Bank of China (PBOC) of the burden of exercis-
 ing financial supervision over all public enterprises:
 ? On 1 January 1984, all commercial banking respon-
 sibilities were taken from the PBOC, which is now
 to function solely as a central bank, formulating and
 carrying out overall monetary policy.
 ? Commercial banking functions previously carried
 out by the PBOC have been delegated to the newly
 formed Industrial and Commercial Bank.

 Secret
 ? The Agricultural Bank-formally reestablished in
 February 1979 after a 10-year hiatus-now serves
 as the main channel for both state investment and
 credits to agriculture as well as for collection of
 revenue in the countryside.
 ? The Construction Bank has been placed under joint
 supervision of the Ministry of Finance and PBOC,
 and is charged with supervising construction
 investment.
 ? A Central Bank Council-made up of executives
 from all the banks-has recently been formed to
 discuss important national financial policy questions
 (see figure 2).
 The long-term goal of banking reform is to set up
 institutions that eventually will be capable of pursuing
 an active monetary policy. Monetary authorities un-
 der such a system could cut back lending when
 aggregate demand is considered too strong and could
 make additional loans when demand is weak. The
 monetary authority itself would determine the course
 that aggregate demand would take. At present, banks
 are forced to lend to almost every enterprise that
 demonstrates a need for funds to meet planned pro-
 duction. In the future, Beijing wants the banking
 system to assist in the drive for efficiency by making
 loans on the basis of profitability.
 Interest rates
 Beijing has also attempted to make greater use of
 interest rates to influence microeconomic decision-
 making. To encourage savings and reduce the amount
 of cash in the hands of consumers, interest rates paid
 on deposits have been raised three times since 1978.
 New types of deposits have been created, broadening
 the range of financial assets available. In 1982,
 enterprises and organizations were for the first time
 permitted to hold time deposits, which earn higher
 interest. Perhaps the most important adjustment,
 however, was the general increase in interest rates on
 loans, implemented in January 1982. The standard
 rate on circulating capital loans was raised from 5.04
 percent a year to 7.2 percent. Certain other loan
 interest rates were raised even more. These adjust-
 ments have made the structure of interest rates more
 rational and hence are beginning to make Chinese
 borrowers and lenders more aware of the true cost of
 Despite these major changes, the PBOC continues to
 have little independent control over economic activity.
 Branch banks-bowing to pressure from local au-
 thorities-still tend to supply credit according to
 enterprise needs, even when those needs exceed plan.
 Higher interest rates, imposed on borrowing for extra-
 budgetary investment, are beginning to influence de-
 mand, but the central bank's ability to control excess
 expenditure is still largely indirect. When a local
 unit's demand for funds becomes excessive, the bank,
 rather than refusing to disburse the loan, attempts to
 correct the situation by notifying the government
 organizations directly responsible for the units where
 the deviation occurs. The reforms have, however,
 given the monetary authorities more influence over
 the mobilization of savings. Households have appar-
 ently responded well to both higher interest rates and
 the improved service offered by local banks.
 The experiment with fiscal and monetary policies
 deserves at least partial credit for curbing aggregate
 demand pressures that had built up between 1979 and
 1981. After increases in the supply of currency in
 1979 and 1980 that exceeded the rise in retail sales by
 a large margin, there was a return to near balance in
 1981 and 1982. Currency in circulation rose only 14.5
 percent in 1981 and 10.9 percent in 1982, while retail
 sales showed gains of 9.8 and 9.4 percent, respective-
 ly. Reduced government spending and the sale of
 treasury bonds enabled Beijing to avoid monetizing
 large amounts of domestic debt. The budget deficits
 for the two years, though large by Chinese standards
 at about 6 billion yuan in 1981 and 7 billion in 1982,
 remained well below the 1979 and 1980 deficits of 21
 billion yuan and 15 billion yuan, respectively. Tighter
 control of wages and bonuses plus, in 1982, stable
 procurement prices for agricultural goods were the
 most important contributors on the monetary side to
 reducing aggregate demand pressure.

 The evidence for 1983 suggests that, although Beijing
 continued to see some success in its demand-manage-
 ment efforts, problems have persisted. China's new
 tax and banking policies, combined with government
 exhortation, finally affected enterprise investment;
 extrabudgetary investment in capital construction fell
 13 percent from the record 1982 level. But the budget
 deficit widened in 1983 to probably about 10 billion
 yuan. And because the People's Bank financed the
 increase, the amount of currency in circulation
 showed a sharp 21-percent rise. The rise in currency
 in circulation was the first economic problem that
 state councilor Song Ping highlighted in his address in
 May before the National People's Congress (NPC).

 Secret
 Beijing remains concerned that, as the reforms pro-
 ceed, aggregate demand will become increasingly
 difficult to control. Nevertheless, Chinese leaders
 reemphasized their commitment to reform at the
 NPC. Hence, we expect fiscal and monetary tools to
 become increasingly important supplements to Chi-
 na's combined planned/market economy over the next
 few years
 On the fiscal side, the government is unlikely to
 return to the cutbacks in its own investment program
 that were imposed in 1980 and 1981. Recognition of
 the importance of the key infrastructure projects to
 economic development ensures increases in govern-
 ment expenditure over the next few years. The share
 of total investment going to the energy and transpor-
 tation sectors jumped from 28 percent in 1982 to 38
 percent last year, and will probably exceed 40 percent
 in 1984. Large domestic budget deficits-similar to
 those of 1979 and 1980-will be avoided by boosting
 tax revenues through tough enforcement of existing
 policies first but also through tax hikes if necessary.
 The government appears prepared, however, to con-
 tinue to operate somewhat in the red, at least for the
 next few years. Because Beijing considers inflows
 from treasury bonds and from foreign borrowing as
 part of revenue rather than debt, it is also probable
 that these borrowing practices will continue.
 The most obvious areas for continued fiscal experi-
 mentation relate to tax policy. The concept of making
 individual enterprises accountable for their profits
 and losses is central to the reform movement. Substi-
 tuting taxes for profit remittances is the only way to
 harmonize the enterprises' needs for autonomy and
 the government's need for funds to finance public
 projects. We expect to see major alterations in the tax
 rates over the next few years. Beijing will probably
 use the tax structure to penalize industries it deems
 weak or undesirable and to reward those it favors. F_
 In many ways, China's economic system is well suited
 for monetary policy. In Western economies, a multi-
 tude of constantly changing financial instruments
 make control of the money supply difficult, but
 Beijing has relatively few instruments for borrowing
 or lending. Then too, although China's banking sys-
 tem is less homogeneous than it was five years ago, it
 retains many of the characteristics of a monobank.
 The monetary authority should be able to exert
 significant control over the entire banking system. As
 a result, we believe Beijing will move ahead with
 monetary reform.
 The banking system will probably play a much larger
 role in financing future investment. Interest rates will
 probably be raised again this year, and preferential
 rates may be offered for priority sectors of the
 economy. We do not know what degree of autonomy
 may be wielded by the new Industrial and Commer-
 cial Bank, but we expect that, over the short term at
 least, it will continue to function under the close
 supervision of the PBOC
 Although the application of monetary and fiscal
 policy has given Beijing a modicum of control over the
 economy that was seriously lacking in 1979-81, the
 government is clearly looking for more. China's lead-
 ership took significant risks in scrapping the system
 built up over the past 30 years. Several members of
 the party's reform wing-such as General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang, Premier Zhao Ziyang, and Vice Pre-
 mier Wan Li-have staked their careers on the
 successful resolution of China's economic problems.
 Clearly they are expecting the entire experiment to
 create a more vibrant, efficient economy. Much of the
 remaining waste and inefficiency, however, stem from
 China's irrational price system.'?
 Macroeconomic demand-management tools are par-
 ticularly ill suited for dealing with relative price
 problems. Restrictive fiscal and monetary policies
 operate by forcing firms in all sectors to scale back
 operations. The most efficient firms maintain reason-
 able profits even in a tight market, while the least
 profitable enterprises suffer or are driven out of
 business. In China, however, profits bear no relation-
 ship to efficiency or demand. Firms producing goods
 '? An irrational price is one that fails to reflect supply and demand
 in an economy. When Chinese prices were fixed in the early 1950s,
 it is reasonable to assume that they reflected relative scarcities at
 the time. In the subsequent three decades, however, Beijing made
 no attempt to maintain market balance in its infrequent price
 adjustments. The existence of long queues, black markets, and
 complex rationing schemes is a reflection of the irrational price

 whose prices have been set high may show substantial
 profits despite inefficient operations even in a market
 depressed by tight fiscal or monetary policies. (In
 some cases these firms even produce goods that the
 government has extreme difficulty marketing, either
 because of low quality or lack of demand.) Conversely,
 an efficient firm that uses raw materials priced
 artificially high may suffer losses in a tight market.
 Under these conditions, restrictive fiscal or monetary
 policy could seriously damage China's best run indus-
 tries. Moreover, the incentive for an inefficient firm to
 streamline operations is low, and neither the reforms
 nor demand-management tools offer much hope for
 change.
 Recognizing these weaknesses, China's leading econo-
 mists have had some success pushing the government
 toward price reform. Last year, prices on more than
 500 minor consumer items were allowed to vary
 depending on local conditions. In addition, peasants
 were given increasing latitude to negotiate prices for
 their surplus agricultural and sideline products.
 The question of major price reform, however, remains
 among the most contentious economic issues within
 China's top echelons.
 Deng publicly criticized  u Yaobang last
 summer for circulating-and apparently supporting-
 a research paper calling for a radical restructuring of
 the price mechanism. State President Li Xiannian
 also denounced the paper, calling it antistate and
 antiparty. These political and ideological concerns
 have been reinforced by practical problems involving
 price reform. Over the past few years, even rumors of
 pending price adjustments for major commodities
 have caused widespread panic buying among China's
 shortage-conscious population. Several major indus-
 tries and their supporting state council bureaucracies
 have also resisted major price reforms because of the
 impact the reforms will probably have on these firms'
 irrationally high profit margins.
 The long-term success of monetary and fiscal policy-
 and for that matter the entire economic reform
 program-hinges on price reform. If, over the next
 few years, Beijing is able to couple its economic
 experiment with major price reform, sizable gains are
 possible. If Beijing continues to resist major price
 adjustment, however, waste, inefficiency, and eco-
 nomic crime will remain. Because the reform policies
 remain controversial, and conservative critics tend to
 attack shortcomings quickly, the longer that major
 economic problems persist, the more frustrated re-
 formers will become. Failure to come to grips with
 price reform will, at a minimum, perpetuate the cycle
 of reform and retrenchment and could precipitate-
 perhaps as early as 1986-the discarding of some
 economic reforms in favor of more direct control.
