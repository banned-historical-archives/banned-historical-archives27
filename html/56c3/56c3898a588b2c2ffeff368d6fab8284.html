 China's Response to Gorbachev's Speech
 Summary
 We  believe China           will  seize  the  opportunity  presented  by
 Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech to push for further Soviet concessions, to
 increase Chinese leverage with the United States, to explore ways to
 reduce the Soviet threat to China, and to sow concern in Hanoi about the
 reliability of Soviet support.  Domestically, Deng may see an opportunity
 to set the course for China's relations with the USSR before he hands over
 power to his successors, leaving them free to focus on the reform
 program.
 In  our  judgment,  China  has  not  changed  its  fundamental
 assessment of the  Soviet threat--nor is  it even  reevaluating  it.  By
 publicly calling for Soviet concessions on Cambodia, Beijing has placed a
 constraint on how far it can go with Moscow and tried to reassure
 Washington.  In responding to Gorbachev, we believe Beijing will attempt
 to probe for and encourage additional concessions from Moscow without
 alarming the United States and China's Asian friends or allowing Moscow
 to exploit a Sino-Soviet dialogue to enhance Soviet leverage in the

 triangle.  In keeping with its "independent foreign policy," moreover, China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both
 Soviet and US actions.
 At the ninth round of bilateral normalization talks that began in
 Beijing on 6 October, we believe Beijing, in addition to pressing on
 Afghanistan and Cambodia, is pushing Moscow to:
 ? Withdraw the majority of Soviet troops from
 Mongolia..
 ? Pull back troops from its border with China.
 ? Reduce SS-20s deployed in the Soviet Far East.
 ? Curtail reconnaissance flights against China
 through North Korean airspace.
 ? Relinquish Chimnaya/Heixiazi Island across from
 Khabarovsk.
 In our judgment, significant Soviet concessions in at least one area
 could  induce  China  to  make  one  or  more  of  the  following
 counter-concessions:
 *Conclude a mutual nonaggression pact with Mongolia.
 ? Agree to confidence-building gestures along its northern border.
 ? Set dates for foreign ministerial talks.
 ? Increase working-level exchanges and consultations.
 In fact, the Chinese have already agreed in principle to resume
 border talks suspended since 1978 and last month allowed visiting Soviet
 First Deputy Premier Talyzin to meet with Premier Zhao Ziyang.
 We believe the Chinese will continue to rebuff Soviet efforts to
 reestablish party ties and will not agree to a summit between Gorbachev
 and either preeminent Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping or General Secretary
 Hu Yaobang prior to significant Soviet concessions on Cambodia. China is
 in the process of normalizing party relations with Eastern Europe--a move
 apparently sanctioned by Moscow in the hope of facilitating possible
 normalization  of  Sino-Soviet  party  ties  later--to  promote  Chinese
 influence in the region at Moscow's expense.       The Chinese also will
 continue to expand defense and economic ties with the United States.

 Beijing's Soviet Policy on the Eve of Gorbachev's Speech
 In the months preceding Gorbachev's speech on 28 July, the Chinese increasingly
 exhibited signs of frustration with Moscow's refusal to follow up its smooth rhetoric
 with concessions on any of what China calls the "three obstacles" to improved relations:
 Soviet  support  for  Vietnam's  occupation  of  Cambodia,  the  Soviet  presence  in
 Afghanistan, and the deployment of Soviet troops in Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet
 border. Beijing last year tried to encourage Gorbachev to reassess Moscow's hardline
 policies toward China's security concerns by agreeing--without corresponding Soviet
 concessions--to resume long-suspended trade union and parliamentary relations and to
 exchange visits by their foreign ministers in 1986.  We believe these moves were also
 designed to increase Beijing's leverage with Washington.
 Moscow's  continued  intransigence  at  the   last  three  biannual  Sino-Soviet
 consultations and its blatant efforts to exploit the impression of improved Sino-Soviet
 ties to enhance its position vis-a-vis Washington, however, caused Beijing to brand
 Gorbachev's foreign policy as meaningless "smile diplomacy" and to back away from the
 exchange of foreign ministers.  We believe Beijing chilled political relations for two
 reasons.  First, the Chinese wanted to remind Moscow that the Soviets must address at
 least one of the "three obstacles" if gradual normalization of relations were to continue.
 At the same time, the Chinese sought to reassure the United States, Thailand, Pakistan,
 and others that China remained committed to resisting the security threat posed by the
 USSR and its Asian allies.
 Indeed, Soviet military developments prior to Gorbachev's speech did little to
 persuade Beijing that Moscow had altered its long-term strategy of encircling China.

 Gorbachev's Proposals
 In his speech given in Vladivostok on 28 July, Gorbachev made the
 following new proposals concerning China:
 ? The Soviet Union will withdraw six regiments from Afghanistan by
 year's end.
 ? Moscow is ready to discuss "concrete steps" to reduce land forces
 along the Sino-Soviet border.
 ? Soviet and Mongolian leaders are examining the removal of a
 "substantial part" of what we believe to be approximately 60,000
 Soviet troops in Mongolia.
 ? The Soviet Union and China could cooperate in space exploration.
 Gorbachev once again:
 ? Proposed bilateral discussions "any time, and at any level"
 on improving relations.
 ? Suggested the official boundary on the Amur River might pass
 along the main shipping channel instead of the Chinese bank.
 (Although this is the first time Moscow has publicly proposed
 this boundary formula, the Soviets did so privately as early
 as 1964.)
 ? Resurrected his call last year for a Helsinki-style Asian
 security conference.
 ? Reiterated Soviet willingness to establish a rail link between
 Soviet Kazakhstan and Chinese Xinjiang.
 ? Endorsed already-begun bilateral negotiations to jointly develop
 the Amur River Basin.

 Factors Governing China's Response
 statements by senior Chinese officials indicate that Beijing
 sees   Gorbachev's   proposals    as   failing   to   address   China's   top   security
 concerns--Vietnam's efforts to expand its influence at China's expense and Soviet
 efforts to encircle China militarily.  Chinese strategic thinkers have also stressed in
 private conversations with Americans that China's assessment of the Soviet threat has
 not changed.
 Nonetheless, we believe China has compelling reasons to begin a dialogue with
 Moscow on Gorbachev's proposals.       In our judgment, Beijing believes further marginal
 improvements in Sino-Soviet relations would:
 ? Buy time for China to modernize its forces along the border.  Beijing is in the
 process of implementing a new defense strategy that it believes requires at least
 a decade of reduced tensions to become completely credible.
 ? Stimulate competition between Moscow and Washington to woo Beijing.
 ? Increase tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations, a major Chinese goal, by playing
 on Hanoi's fear of being sold out by Moscow.  Vietnam periodically dispatches
 delegations to Moscow to seek reassurances of Soviet support.
 ? Assist domestic political goals.
 At the  same time, Beijing  is well aware that too positive a response to
 Gorbachev's  proposals could jeopardize its access to US, Japanese, and Western
 European advanced technology, investment, trade, and defense cooperation--major
 Chinese political goals.  Nor does Beijing want to signal its friends and enemies in
 Southeast  and   South  Asia  that it might reconsider its stand on Cambodia  and
 Afghanistan. Therefore, we believe China will attempt to:
 ? Encourage Soviet flexibility while continuing to criticize on the three obstacles
 and other security issues.
 ? Probe for major Soviet concessions on the three obstacles and China's northern
 boundary.
 ? Reassure Washington of China's pro-Western tilt, but implicitly try to exploit its
 option of playing the "Soviet card" to extract concessions from the United States
 on Taiwan or other bilateral issues such as trade and technology transfers.
 ? Reduce Moscow's ability to play the "China card" against Washington.
 ? Keep Thailand and Pakistan from wavering on Cambodia and Afghanistan.

 Domestic Fallout from the Gorbachev Speech
 Deng and his reform allies can gain in two areas from some further
 relaxation in Sino-Soviet relations, in our view.  First, any reduction in tensions
 tends to benefit China's economic modernization program. Second, progress on
 the issue should smooth the transition to power for Deng's successors.
 We believe Deng has designed many of China's foreign policy initiatives,
 most notably closer relations with the West, to support his economic reforms.
 Consequently, although he distrusts the Soviets, Deng would probably be willing
 to be more flexible if he believes he can win real Soviet concessions that can
 help his modernization goals.  Avoidance of border tensions allows a more
 measured pace of military modernization and frees transport, manpower, and
 other resources.  Deng may also hope to expand exports of goods China cannot
 trade elsewhere and gain further Soviet assistance in modernizing Soviet-built
 factories.
 On the political front, Deng may see an opportunity to set China's Soviet
 policy before he hands power over to his successors. We believe that Deng has
 kept foreign policy issues closely under his own control, relying on his personal
 prestige and influence to manage this sensitive area.  Deng's successors will
 not have his personal clout and therefore might be more vulnerable to groups
 that either have a different foreign policy orientation or seek to exploit foreign
 affairs for domestic political ends.  The more Deng can stabilize relations with
 Moscow and win agreement on how to proceed, the more likely we believe his
 successors will be able to carry on the reform program with a minimum of
 distraction.
 In our estimation, Deng's conservative opponents, who argued last year
 for a more flexible approach to the Soviets, cannot capitalize politically on
 Gorbachev's initiatives.  We believe that recent political developments have
 greatly weakened the conservatives--especially those at the top--and have
 made it increasingly unlikely that the conservatives will be able to challenge
 Deng.   In any case, it is our judgment that the conservatives are suspicious of
 both the United States and the Soviet Union. Thus, while there is some support
 among the conservatives for more distant relations with Washington, we also
 see very little active pressure for closer political relations with Moscow.

 Possible Chinese Responses
 We believe the Chinese will use scheduled contacts over the next several weeks
 to seek further indications of Soviet intentions, but the ninth round of vice foreign
 ministerial normalization talks in Beijing that began on 6 October provides the best
 venue to engage the Soviets in a meaningful dialogue on Gorbachev's proposals.
 Outlined below is our speculation about what the Chinese may be saying and why. 7
 Security issues.  Remarks by Chinese strategic thinkers support our judgment
 that China is not satisfied with Gorbachev's implicit pledge to freeze the number of
 SS-20s in the Far East or his explicit promise not to relocate in the region any SS-20s
 that might be removed from Europe. We believe the Chinese are pressing for their total
 withdrawal.   China proably is also protesting overflights of North Korea by Soviet
 reconnaissance planes targeting the Chinese coast, Moscow's expansion of its Pacific
 fleet, and the upgrading of Soviet airpower in the Far East.
 We nevertheless believe that the Chinese view Gorbachev's offer to withdraw
 troops from Mongolia and the Sino-Soviet border as an important unilateral gesture.  If
 the Soviets commit themselves to withdraw one or more of their      divisions in
 Mongolia--a move that would not jeopardize Soviet or Mongolian security--Beijing
 could reciprocate in a number of ways without compromising its own security. Chinese
 options include:
 ? Announcing the "deactivation" of the
 Field Army Opposite Mongolia
 ? Agreeing to warn each other of military exercises or major troop movements
 near the Sino-Mongolian border.
 ? Pulling back tank regiments from selected border defense divisions along the
 Mongolian frontier.
 If the Soviets go beyond a token withdrawal and pull back most if not all of their forces
 from Mongolia, we believe the Chinese would be willing to go further, perhaps signing a
 friendship treaty with Mongolia renouncing any claim to Mongolian territory and serve
 as a de facto mutual nonaggression pact--something the Soviets have been seeking.
 We believe a Soviet proposal to negotiate some sort of demilitarized zone along
 the Sino-Soviet border would be far less attractive to China than deactivation of Soviet
 divisions.  Beijing has always expressed greater concern about the number of Soviet
 divisions in the Far East than about their proximity to the Chinese border.  Nonetheless,
 if the Soviets offered to pull back all regular ground units 30 kilometers from the border,
 China, in our judgment, could respond by transfering northern border security duties
 from the PLA to the Peo le's Armed Police.

 Expanded Political Contacts
 China's cautious response to Gorbachev's initiative comes amidst a flurry
 of high-level exchanges with the Soviet Union and Mongolia that we believe is
 a combination of earlier scheduling, Chinese interest in Gorbachev's proposals,
 and Moscow's desire to portray Sino-Soviet relations as improving:
 ? Soviet First Deputy Premier Arkhipov arrived in China for
 "acupuncture treatment" on the eve of Gorbachev's speech
 and met with Vice Premiers Li Peng, Wan Li, and Yao Yilin
 before returning to Moscow on 26 August. According to a
 Western press account, Arkhipov presented the Chinese
 with an advance copy of the speech.
 ? Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuging proceeded with
 a long-scheduled trip to Mongolia--the highest-level
 Chinese visit to that country in over 20 years--which
 culminated in the signing of a consular treaty on
 9 August. This treaty is consistent with similar
 agreements Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian signed in Berlin
 and Budapest in late spring, but takes on added signifi-
 cance because it follows on the heels of Gorbachev's
 Mongolian overture, which the two sides also discussed.
 ? Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong began a two-week visit to
 Moscow 17 August, the first such mayoral visit since
 the 1950s.
 ? Soviet Deputy Premier and Alternate Politburo member
 Talyzin, accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister
 Rogachev, visited China in early September as Yao's
 guest. Talyzin also was received by Premier Zhao
 Ziyang and left Beijing with a new consular agreement
 and an accord to expand ties between Soviet and Chinese
 state planning commissions. According to a Soviet
 diplomat in Beijing, the Chinese in early May pushed
 for the visit of a deputy premier to reciprocate
 for Yao's visit in July 1985. Talyzin's visit was
 in response to this, but its timing nevertheless
 fortuitously strengthened the impression of improved
 ties following Gorbachev's speech.
 ? Wu and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze held
 the third annual Sino-Soviet foreign ministerial
 meeting at the opening of the UNGA in September.
 They agreed in principle to resume border talks
 next year, but did not schedule reciprocal visits.

 ? President Li Xiannian hosted Polish leader Wojciech
 Jaruzelski for a 3-day working visit to Beijing in
 late September. Jaruzelski also met with Deng Xiaoping,
 Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang, and Zhao. Li, Hu,
 and Zhao accepted invitations to visit Poland and Li
 invited Jaruzelski to make an official visit to China,
 but the two sides stopped short of announcing a full
 normalization of party ties.
 ? Hu and Li will host an official visit to China by East
 German General Secretary and President Honecker in late
 October. Honecker's and Jaruzelski's visits to China--
 the first such trips in many years by Soviet bloc party
 leaders other than Romania's Ceaucescu--and the progress
 toward normalization of party ties most likely signal similar
 developments with other East European Communist parties.
 Beijing sees these visits as leading to increased Chinese
 influence in East Europe, but Jaruzelski's and Honecker's
 party position and the certainty that Moscow has approved
 their trips nonetheless give the visits a Sino-Soviet
 focus as well.
 ? Rogachev is now is Beijing as head of the Soviet delegation to
 the ninth round of Sino-Soviet vice ministerial normalization
 talks.
 Boundary Talks.  Wu and Sherarduadze announced at their UNGA meeting in
 September that China and the USSR next year will reopen formal border negotiations,
 which broke down in 1978 after Beijing publicly insisted on Soviet withdrawal from
 disputed areas and added a new demand that Moscow reduce its forces along the
 Sino-Soviet border to the level of Khrushchev's time.  Gorbachev's hint that Moscow
 would     accept the deepest  channel  (thalweg)  of the Amur River as the  line  of
 demarcation holds out the promise that China would exercise sovereignty over most of
 the disputed islands in the river.  Ownership of Chimnaya (Heixiazi) Island opposite
 Khabarovsk, however, is likely to be a sticking point, and any negotiations on the border
 are likely to be protracted as both parties weigh the impact on disputes with other
 nations.
 Amur River Basin and Railway Cooperation.  China earlier this year reopened to
 Soviet shipping the port of Tongjiang on the Songhua River near the Amur, and we
 believe the two sides will sign an agreement on use of the basin based on their recent
 expert-level  negotiations.   China  has  announced  that  it  plans  to  extend  the
 Harbin-Longzhen railway 240 kilometers to Aihui on the Amur River and might cooperate

 kilometers to the single-track Lanzhou-Urumqi  railway, extending  it to within 80
 kilometers of the Soviet railway terminus at Druzhba.  We would not be surprised if
 Beijing accelerated its construction schedule and agreed to connect the two railways as
 a sign of goodwill to Moscow.
 Areas Where Beijing is Unlikely to Accommodate Moscow
 Beijing has stated it will not compromise with Moscow on Afghanistan and
 Cambodia,  and  we  believe  China  will  hold  significant  improvements  in  political
 relations--such as party ties and a Deng/Hu-Gorbachev summit--hostage to meaningful
 Soviet movement on these "obstacles."     In an interview with Mike Wallace of "60
 Minutes" in early September, Deng offered to travel to Moscow to meet with Gorbachev
 if--but   only if--the Soviets withdraw their support for Vietnam's  occupation       of
 Cambodia.
 China probably calculates that even the hint of China's flexibility on these issues
 would greatly harm its credibility with the United States, and such Asian friends as
 Pakistan and Thailand.  Moreover, we believe the Chinese will attempt to assuage their
 friends'  natural suspicions  of any  Sino-Soviet  border agreement,  and may     couple
 progress in one area with stepped-up criticism of Soviet activity elsewhere, especially
 Cambodia and Afghanistan.  We expect the Chinese to reject Gorbachev's proposed
 Asian security conference, as they have in the past.  Beijing also will not, in our view,
 agree to forswear the option of strategic cooperation with Washington against Moscow.
 Finally, Beijing's pride in its own space-launch capabilities most likely will keep
 China from taking Gorbachev up on his offer to join the ranks of Mongolia, Cuba, and
 various East European satellites as a junior partner in the Soviet space program.  The
 Chinese, moreover, have already expressed interest in a US invitation to participate in a
 future space shuttle mission.
 Positive Signals China Can Send in Other Areas
 Even if the Chinese rule out concessions specifically linked to Gorbachev's
 proposals on the grounds that Gorbachev merely responded to earlier Chinese gestures,
 they could nevertheless reward Gorbachev and encourage further Soviet concessions in
 other ways. Possible moves might include:
 ? Increasing consultations between working-level officials on international issues,
 including relations with the United States.
 ? Regularly exchanging views (but not intelligence) between think tank experts on
 economic development and foreign policy issues.  '
 ? Proceeding with the exchange of foreign ministerial visits.
 ? Exchanging visits by editors of Pravda and People's Daily.

 Without significant progress on Cambodia, however, we believe the Chinese will
 not agree to a summit between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping or Hu Yaobang.  Such a
 move would be too close to a resumption of party ties, which Beijing probably believes
 would  give  the  Soviets  excessive  leverage  within  the  strategic  triangle  while
 undermining China's credibility as an independent actor in both the West and in the
 Third World.
 Outlook for the Remainder of 1986
 We expect the Chinese to try to use Gorbachev's initiative to encourage US
 concessions on Taiwan, trade, and technology transfer. But Chinese officials in private
 probably will take pains to reassure the United States and others of China's continued
 goodwill.  Beijing, in our judgment, will exploit the "coincidental" timing of Defense
 Secretary Weinberger's and Rogachev's visits and the fact that US Navy warships in
 November will make their first port call to China to press the Soviets for concessions on
 Chinese security concerns and to balance any improvements in relations with Moscow.
 China will also closely monitor developments in US-USSR relations as a possible
 full-blown Reagan-Gorbachev summit approaches, out of concern that Beijing may be
 caught behind the curve.  Finally, in keeping with its "independent foreign policy," China
 will continue to send mixed signals in its press commentary on both Soviet and US
 actions.
