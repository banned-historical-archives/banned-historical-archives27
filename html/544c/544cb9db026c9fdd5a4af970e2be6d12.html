 [Article:   "Correctly Understand the Spirit of the Third Plenary Session As Well
 As the Line, the Programs and the Policies of the Party Is  the  Emphasis of a
 Speech Given at the Military Region Political Work Conference by Political Commissar
 Xiang Zhonghua [0686 0112 5478]"]
 [Text]  What is the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, and what is the line, the
 programs, and the policies of the party?  Are the programs and policies put forward
 in the Central Work Conference convened not long ago synonymous with the spirit of
 the Third Plenary Session?  What is it that stands in the way of some of the
 comrades in correctly understanding the line, the programs and the policies since
 the Third Plenary Session?  How can the vague understanding and erroneous ideas
 of some cadres and soldiers toward the party line, programs, and policies be
 correctly dealt with?  For those in military units whose understanding of these
 problems is not too profound or not too clear, Xiang Zhonghua, political commissar
 of the military region, provided a systematic explanation in a speech he gave at
 the Military Region Political Work Conference.
 The Spirit of the Third Plenary Session and a Series of Programs, Policies and
 Major Policy Decisions Since the Third Plenary Session
 What is the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee,
 and what is included in the Party's line, programs, and policies since the Third
 Plenary Session?  Political Commissar Xiang said in his speech that the line,
 programs and policies established by the Third Plenary Session differ entirely
 from the line, programs, and policies of the "Great Cultural Revolution."  The
 Third Plenary Session revived the fundamental principles of Marxism and Mao Zedong
 Thought, provided for emancipation of thought, using one's brains, seeking for
 truth in facts, and looking ahead united as one, which may be said to be an over-
 all guiding program for seeking truth in facts and correcting leftist errors.  This,
 then, is the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of which we so often speak.   Under
 the guidance of this overall policy, the Third Plenary Session, the Fourth Plenary
 Session, the Fifth Plenary Session, the Second Central Work Conference, and other
 major conferences further delineated the party's political line, ideological line,
 and organizational line, and put forward a series of programs, policies and major
 policy decisions.   Those of relative special consequence included the following:
 (1) arrived at the strategic policy decision of shifting the focus of work of the
 entire party to the building of the four modernizations, and established a political

 line for mobilizing the people of the entire nation to carry out the four moderniza-
 tions with one heart and one mind;  (2) exposed and criticized the concept of two
 "whatevers," and established the Marxist ideological line of seeking truth in facts;
 (3) proposed the strengthening and improvement of party leadership, formulated
 "Various Regulations on Political Life Within the Party," perfected central leader-
 ship organizations, and established the party's organizational line; (4) made a
 factual analysis of China's class situation in the wake of completion of socialist
 reform of ownership of the means of production, determining that an exploiting
 class no longer exists in China, that the class struggle continues to exist, but
 that it has ceased to be the result of major contradictions in China's society,
 and deciding to have no further political campaigns, to correctly handle contra-
 dictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and
 to unify the maximum number of the masses to carry out the four modernizations
 program; (5) examined and resolved some major problems left over from history and
 some questions of merits and demerits, and rights and wrongs of some major leaders,
 with rehabilitation including the "Tiananmen Incident," and the unjust, false, and
 misjudged cases involving major wrongs against comrades Liu Shaoqi and Peng Dehuai,
 proposing a program for realizing national stability and unity; (6) provided for
 establishment of a legal system with a high degree of socialist democracy and
 consummate socialism, promulgated a series of laws, and brought to trial the Lin
 Biao, Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique;  (7) proposed and began an all around
 summarization of the lessons of experience of socialist revolution and socialist
 construction since the founding of the People's Republic, including a correct eval-
 uation of Comrade Mao Zadong's merits and demerits, noting that Comrade Mao Zedong's
 merits were of primary importance while his demerits were of secondary importance,
 and that the tests of experience have attested to the correctness of Mao Zedong
 Thought, which continues to be the guiding thought of our party; (8) reiterated
 that realization of China's four modernizations would require adherence to four
 ideological and political principles; (9) proposed action to reform the party's
 and the state's leadership systems to solve real existing evils of life-long leader-
 ship cadre tenure, and an excessive centralization of authority; (10) proposed that
 while adhering to the socialist road, that cadres gradually come to be younger,
 better educated, and specialized; (11) put forward a program for the "readjustment,
 consolidation, restructuring, and improvement" of the national economy, institution
 of reform of the national economic structure and management system, and full arousal
 of initiative in the central government, all provinces, municipalities, and enter-
 prises;  (12) put forward a series of policies and measures for development of agri-
 cultural production, readjusted agricultural policies in terms of prices, revenues,
 credit, procurement of agriculture byproducts, and forms of management; stressed
 respect for the self-determination of production teams, and development of diversi-
 fication through adaptation of general methods to specific circumstances; estab-
 lished and improved upon various forms of a system of responsibility for production,
 expanding limitations on private plots, family sideline occupations and county fair
 trade; (13) institution of economic policies opening up foreign trade, allowing
 independent action while retaining the initiative in one's own hands, and practicing
 self-reliance; (14) provided for further economic readjustment and further political
 stability as the only correct programs.  Additionally, under the guidance of the
 overall guiding thought, the CCP Central Committee also readjusted and formulated
 policies pertaining to intellectuals, policies pertaining to education, policies
 pertaining to literature and art, policies pertaining to races, policies pertaining
 to a united front, foreign policies, etc.  Political Commissar Xiang noted that

 experience has shown that this series of programs and policies entirely accord with
 China's circumstances and have been fully supported by the masses of people.  The
 huge changes and progress made in China during the past 2 years, and the presently
 very good political and economic situation are the result of implementation of the
 line, programs, and policies since the Third Plenary Session.
 The Spirit of the Present Central Work Conference and the Overall Guiding Thought
 of the Third Plenary Session Are Synonymous
 While studying the spirit of the Central Work Conference, some cadres and soldiers
 supposed that Central Work Conference changes in programs of the Third Plenary
 Session amounted to correction of "deviations" of some policies since the Third
 Plenary Session.  How should this question be viewed?  Political commissar Xiang
 noted in this speech that it is necessary to affirm, first of all, that since the
 time of the Third Plenary Session up until the present, there have been no changes
 in the overall guiding thought of the party's seeking truth in facts, and thoroughly
 correcting leftist errors.  Beginning with the realities of the state of the nation,
 and hidden dangers currently existing in the economy, this Central Work Conference
 decided on further readjustment of the national economy, deciding to get rid of
 tentative plans and subjectively high criteria not geared to actual circumstances,
 so that the country's economy can gradually divest itself of the fetters of leftist
 mistakes, and take the path of steady and healthy development.  This is precisely
 what the guiding thought of the Third Plenary Session sought to accomplish, and it
 is also a continuation of the policy of "readjustment, consolidation, restructuring,
 and improvement."  However, as with everything where changes occur in development,
 programs and policies since the Third Plenary Session have, in the course of their
 implementation, been subject to enrichment, to perfection, and to development.
 Nothing is immutable.  We cannot use a static concept to view changes in policies.
 He said that since the Third Plenary Session, party programs and policies have
 developed, first of all, under constant eradication of various disturbances.  These
 included the disturbance of the two "whatevers," the disturbance of the liberaliza-
 tion trend of thought, and the sabotage of elements who crave nothing short of
 nationwide chaos.  It was the elimination of these "leftist" right disturbances
 that tested the correctness of the programs of the Third Plenary Session, and
 enriched and developed the actual content of the Third Plenary Session's programs.
 Acting in accordance with current realities, and while emphasizing the surmounting
 of leftist mistakes, this Central Work Conference, pointed to real planning weak-
 nesses, conducted necessary criticism and struggle against tendencies to cancel out
 or oppose the party leadership, and struck firm blows against anti-party and anti-
 socialist activities and against criminal activities.  This was only as it should
 be.   This not only signifies no change in the programs of the Third Plenary Session,
 but also happens to support, as well, the Third Plenary Session's principle of
 seeking truth in facts, and supports the direction and objectives set by the Third
 Plenary Session.   Second, as a result of changes in development of the objective
 situation, the party's policies also require commensurate readjustment and augmen-
 tation.
 The Third Plenary Session's two documents on the development of agriculture, for
 example, have been shown to be effective in practice.   But faced with a developing
 situation, the Central Committee last year additionally issued document number 75
 proposing various forms of a system of responsibility for production, and giving

 further impetus to the development of agriculture.  Such readjustment and augmen-
 tation of policies both accords with realities and maintains the continuity and
 unity of policies, which is entirely in keeping with the programs of the Third
 Plenary Session.  Third, in order to correct work faults, some changes were neces-
 sary in actual policies and measures.  Communists are not gods without any mistakes
 in their work.  This further economic readjustment was decided upon only after
 having recognized faults in economic work during the first 2 years after smashing
 the "gang of four," and before and after the Third Plenary Session and after having
 found the crux of the problem.  In other words, to suppose that today's specific
 policies are in all respects the same and not the slightest bit changed from the
 policies formulated at the time of the Third Plenary Session is not, in fact, the
 case.  However, if upon seeing some change and development, one supposes a c'ldnge
 from the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, that is not in accordance with the
 facts either.
 Correct Erroneous Ideology and Correctly Understand and Implement the Party's Line,
 Programs, and Policies
 Why is it that some comrades are unable to properly understand the line, the programs,
 and the policies of the Third Plenary Session?  Political Commissar Xiang said, I
 agree with the views of many comrades at this political work conference.  Looked
 at in terms of ideological understanding, there are two principal impediments:  One
 is the effects of the erroneous leftist ideology.  For the past 20 years, the mis-
 takes our party has made have been largely "leftist" mistakes.  For a long time,
 all of us have lived and worked under the guidance of "leftist" ideology, and have
 studied and propagandized what is embodied in "leftism" as the correct line.  To
 one degree or another, "leftist" ideology has left an imprint in our brains.  Now,
 some comrades are still filled with misgivings and vacillate in indecision about
 the Third Plenary Session as the result of the mischief caused by the "leftist"
 thing.  For example, as soon as a shift in work emphasis comes up, some comrades
 suppose abandonment of class struggle is meant; as soon as talk turns to emancipa-
 tion of the mentality, they suppose this means the four fundamental principles are
 not wanted; and as soon as the need for adequate appraisal of the effects of leftist
 ideology is raised, eradication of the influence of "leftist" mistakes remains an
 arduous task.  Then there is capitalist liberalism, anarchy, and extremism.  This
 is a very powerful centrifugal force and a corrodent.  Today there actually exists
 in the armed forces a minority of people who are wavering politically about the
 four fundamental principles, and who ideologically believe in "everyman for himself
 and the devil take the hindmost," and "money is omnipotent," and such capitalist
 articles of faith.   Organizationally, they want only democracy and freedom rather
 than organizational discipline, and some have even progressed to opportunism and
 profiteering, corruption and larceny, and smuggling of people out of the country.
 Such people must inevitably be ideologically incompatible with the party line, its
 programs, and policies, and their actions must inevitably encroach upon the welfare
 of the majority of people, and cannot be countenanced by party discipline, military
 discipline, and the laws of the land.  Commissar Xiang noted that those two
 erroneous ideologies differ in outward form, and they likewise impede our true
 understanding and implementation of the line, programs, and policies of the party.
 We must vigorously correct them.

 Keep On Enlightening Programs and Guiding Cadres and Soldiers in Solving Ideological
 Problems
 How can the muddled understanding and erroneous ideology toward the party's line,
 its programs and policies that is reflected by some cadres and soldiers be given
 help?  Commissar Xiang said that the proper way should be to keep up enlightenment
 about policies, persevere in "three not-ism," let everyone speak what is on his
 mind and speak what is in his heart, after which he should be led through a point
 by point solution to problems.  When it comes to ideological understanding, people
 cannot be gagged, cannot be coerced, and can even less be "scared into submission."
 Nowadays some comrades pit political conformity against democratic expression, and
 dare not express doubts that are in their minds.  It should be realized that ideo-
 logical conformity is the foundation for political conformity, and so it is neces-
 sary to place principal efforts on raising the consciousnesses of cadres and
 soldiers, and then to do a good job of political ideology.   Commissar Xiang noted
 that gathering from currently reported circumstances, the problems with most
 comrades are problems of ideological understanding, and those who stand in a posi-
 tion of opposition to the party's line, programs, and policies are extremely few.
 We must strictly distinguish problems of ideological understanding from political
 problems, and unite maintenance of unanimity with the CCP Central Committee and

 IMPORTANCE OF COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE DISCUSSED
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 7 Jan 81 p 4
 [Article:  "Important Significance of China's Institution of a System of Compulsory
 Military Service"]
 [Excerpt]  China's Current Military Service System
 With the founding of the Chinese People's Republic, our army was the national
 armed force.  Internally it was responsible for consolidation of the dictatorship
 of the proletariat, for consolidation of the fruits of victory of the people's
 revolution, and for suppressing resistance by all counterrevolutionary elements.
 Externally, it was responsible for defense against imperialist aggression and
 subversion, for safeguarding the socialist revolution and socialist construction,
 for protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation, and for
 maintaining wprld peace.  Its new duties were at once both formidable and
 glorious, requiring that we have not only a powerful army, but also a powerful
 air force and navy, and requiring not only that we have powerful forces on duty,
 but also powerful forces in reserve.  However, because of the lack of a fixed
 period of recruitment and a retirement system, a voluntary military service system
 could not meet the requirements of the new era. Since we had built a nation for
 the people, everyone had responsibility for safeguarding his own country, and
 everyone should take up this responsibility for safeguarding the motherland.
 Therefore, when the Chinese People's Republic was founded, it was decided "to
 make ready for the institution of a system of compulsory military service at the
 proper time."  At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress on
 30 July 1955, the "Military Service Law of the Chinese People's Republic" was
 discussed, promulgated, and put into effect on the same day by the chairman of
 the Chinese People's Republic.  The "Military Service Law of the Chinese People's
 Republic" was a law for the performance of military service under which the
 Chinese people could consolidate their own national defense and safeguard their
 own welfare.  It stipulated that all citizens fully 18 years of age have a duty
 to perform military service.  Beginning in 1955, China instituted compulsory
 military service.  The First Session of the Fifth National People's Congress
 Standing Committee held on 5 March 1978 discussed and approved "Decisions of
 Problems in the Military Service System" put forward by the State Council,
 deciding to change China's compulsory military service system into a combined
 compulsory and volunteer military service system for longterm service in the
 armed forces.  This is China's existing military service system.

 The main substance of the compulsory military system are as follows:   (1) "All
 male citizens of the Chinese People's Republic who are a full 18 years of age,
 regardless of national origins, race, occupation, social background, religious
 beliefs or extent of education, are liable for compulsory military service in
 accordance with this law."  (2)  The stipulated periods of active military
 service are as follows:  army, 3 years; air force, 4 years; navy, 5 years.
 Also stipulated is that some specialist mainstay cadres become volunteers with a
 15 to 20 year period of active duty.  It is further stipulated that when some
 troops have completed their full period of service, they may continue on active
 duty for an additional period, depending on the needs of the service and their
 personal wishes.  The period of extended service shall be a minimum of 1 year.
 (3)  It is stipulated that the fixed period for call-up nationwide shall be
 annually from 1 November to the end of February the following year.  The required
 numbers of people to be called up and methods of call-up shall be stipulated by
 the State Council on the basis of circumstances during the current year.
 (4)  Military people are citizens with full rights.   They have the rights and
 duties of citizens stipulated in the constitution of the Chinese People's Republic.
 Military persons on active duty and their dependents shall be given preferential
 treatment by the state.
 Why Institute a System of Compulsory Military Service
 In the 20-odd years during which a system of compulsory military service has been
 in effect in China, experience has shown that under prevailing conditions in China,
 institution of a system of compulsory military service holds numerous advantages
 and very great significance:
 1.  Institution of a system of compulsory military service is for the purposes
 of allowing Chinese youth opportunity to realize their desire to protect the
 country and for everybody fairly and sensibly to undertake military duties.
 Ours is a country that belongs to the people themselves.  The people are the
 masters of the country, and the security of the country depends on defense by
 the people as a whole.  However, would it be workable for everyone to be a
 soldier?  No.  Our military personnel meet a fixed numerical quota, and were
 this numerical quota to be exceeded, both the state and the people would bear
 an unconscionally heavy burden.  There are also certain requirements for being
 a soldier, and if one does not meet these requirements, it would impair fulfill-
 ment of missions.                  Consequently, from among the large numbers of youths who
 annually rush to register, the state can select only a relatively\few outstanding
 ones to enter military service.  Each year a group is inducted, and a group is
 retired, so that the broad masses of youths who meet age requirements have oppor-
 tunity to perform their duty.   This way is both relatively fair and also rela-
 tively sensible. During the period of service, one can both perform one's duty
 and learn military techniques, improve ideological consciousness and cultural
 levels, and be severely tempered by life in the armed forces.
 2.  Compulsory military service can accumulate for the country large numbers of
 reservists who have undergone training, assuring that such war suddenly break
 out, our military forces could steadily enlarge and replenish soldiers with the
 elements of training.  There are numerous points of difference between modern
 warfare and the warfare of the past.  One is the large scale and the suddenness

 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
 of the outbreak of fighting, frequently requiring mobilization of several million
 in the armed forces.  Without a large number of reservists, victory in war would
 be difficult to attain.  Second is the suddenness of modern warfare, with
 hostilities breaking out at once, possibly on any given morning.  Unless one is
 able to assure rapid mobilization of a large number of trained troops, the country
 may suffer severe destruction, and great losses of people's lives and property may
 ensue.  Third is the large-scale use of all kinds of modern new weapons and equip-
 ment, and scientific techniques, things such as new types of aircraft, large guns,
 tanks, naval vessels, military electronic technology, rocket technlogy, laser
 technology, etc.  Unless advance training has been given the troops, once war
 breaks out, it is not possible to master well the use of advanced weapons and
 technical equipment.  In order to meet these characteristics of modern warfare,
 we must have planned accumulation of large numbers of troops who have underL,one
 training.  With compulsory military service, call-ups at fixed times and retire-
 ments at fixed times permit annual induction of a certain number of youths into
 the armed forces where they are given military and political training and readied
 for combat.  Annually, as well, a group of strenuously trained warriors who have
 completed their periods of military service, retire from active service to become
 national reservists.  In the more than 20 years since institution of compulsory
 military service, China has accumulated rather abundant reservists.  When needed
 by the country, these reservists can be sent in an endless stream as replacements
 in military units or be rapidly organized into newly created combat units and
 local military forces; so that aggressors will sink in a boundless ocean of
 people's war.  For example, during the period of self-defense counterattack on
 the Sino-Vietnam border, in order to respond to the call of the motherland for
 call-up of forces in wartime, and to assure full strength of units, in Yulin
 Prefecture in Guangxi Province alone, 4.267 retired servicemen below 25 years
 of age registered for induction, permitting units to replenish their strength at
 once, increase their combat capabilities, and assure completion of combat missions.
 3.  The system of compulsory military service can also save manpower and material
 resources in normal times for use in strengthening the building of the national
 economy.  China today is still rather poor, and its economy is insufficiently well
 developed.  We want to hasten the speed of economic construction, and make China
 a modern agricultural, industrial power with modern national defense, and modern
 science and technology in this century.  This is a glorious mission that history
 has bestowed upon us.  Military expenditures are a very large figure.  Military
 personnel mostly do not create material wealth for society, but rather consume
 material wealth.  If the amount is excessive and military expenditures too great,
 this holds back the building of the national economy.  Therefore, we must correctly
 handle the relationship between the buildup in national defense and the buildup of
 the economy,  whereby the number of people in the armed forces are at the optimum
 level so that military spending as a proportion of national disbursements is kept
 in proper balance.  Institution of a system of compulsory military service is a
 fine way of achieving this.  This is because, when the country has such a system,
 in normal times it can maintain the number of troops at a relatively low level
 and conserve a certain amount of military expenditures.  In this way the country
 can use the manpower, material and financial resources thus saved in building the
 economy to hasten the pace of the four modernizations construction, so as to
 realize the four modernizations at an early time.

 In summary, a system of compulsory military service not only enhances China's
 defense force needs, but also enhances needs for construction of the national
 economy.  It also accords with the longterm interests of the country and the
 people, and accords with the present interests of the country and the people.
 Thus, it may be said that a system of compulsory military service is commensurate
 with the advanced and sensible system of military service of China's current situ-
 ation, and thus it has been warmly supported by people of all races throughout the
 country.

 JOINT REGULAR FORCES - MILITIA DEFENSE EPISODE RELATED
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 5 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by Li Sugui [2621 5685 63111 and Guo Delong [6753 1795 78931:  "Joint
 Army-Civilian Efforts To Safeguard Power Station"]
 [Text]  A winter night with a cold wind blowing and silence everywhere.  In a
 grassy thicket of a salient along the Guangxi frontier, more than 10 pairs of eyes
 flash, keeping watch on everything along the border.  This is a concealed joint
 military-civilian unit sent out by the militia battalion of the Jiebang Brigade,
 Longbang Commune and the 5th Company of a certain unit of the Guangxi Border
 Defense carrying out a combat mission to counter a sabotage plot by Vietnamese
 agents.  By now they have been in concealment positions for seven dawns, and they
 are preparing to pass their eighth night here.
 Eight days ago, our guards discovered frequent border activities by Vietnamese
 secret service units who were vainly attempting to sabotage the Naxi hydroelectric
 power station on the border.  This hydropower station supplies electricity to
 border defense sentry posts, and meets the needs for electricity in production and
 daily life of more than 30 communes and brigades and mining areas.  How can the
 enemy be permitted to sabotage it!  The 5th Company immediately worked out a combat
 plan with the militia battalion of the Jiebang Brigade for joint military-civilian
 defense of the hydropower station.
 It is dead of night and it has just begun to rain, dropping temperatures suddenly.
 Lying concealed in the cold wet grassy thicket, mosquitoes and bugs biting, the
 rain is soaking and it is extremely hard to bear.  However, they continue to hold
 fast to their concealed position, waiting silently for the arrival of the "unhurried
 guest."  Suddenly, a short burst of machinegun fire is heard from the enemy's
 position.  The enemy fires a burst of tracers in the direction of our concealed
 position.  Our concealed personnel have seen through the enemy's probing trick
 and continue to wait quietly.  Presently, as expected, from the enemy position
 comes the sound of light footsteps.  From 40 meters away from our concealed posi-
 tion, three scoundrels carrying satchel charges grope along stealthily in the
 direction of the border hydropower station.  Our concealed unit suddenly closes
 the net, encircling them.
 Upon discovering that our side has been strongly fortified, the cunning enemy
 explodes their satchel charges for cover and flee helter-skelter from the border
 area.  The Vietnamese invaders carefully planned plot has been thoroughly smashed.

 USE OF EXISTING WEAPONS, DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ONES STRESSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 3 Jun 79 p 2
 [Article by Hao Sheng [6787 6115]:  "Atomic Bombs Should Be Made, But Hand Grenades
 Should Not Be Tossed Aside"]
 [Text]  A combat training section chief who fought in the Self-defense Counterattack
 Operation said it this way:  "In this fight, hand grenades and satchel charges were
 used to good effect, but proportionately speaking, what killed and wounded the enemy
 most was the various kinds of guns and automatic weapons."  Therefore, he concluded,
 "attention to armaments, doing a good job of training, and keeping ones eyes only
 on hand grenades will not do; it is necessary to look ahead."
 Hand grenades have their place.  Without going into the war years of the past, they
 demonstrated their power in the recent Sino-Vietnamese border self-defense counter-
 attack operations.  It would not be fair to ignore the function of hand grenades.
 However, hand grenades are only hand grenades after all, and to exaggerate their
 power would be improper as well.
 While basing onself on what one has, look toward developments.  Our armed forces
 are presently in a period of historical transition of millet plus infantry rifles,
 and aircraft plus large guns to conventional weapons plus special weapons.  Our
 method is:  thorough training in the weapons we possess, study of science and
 culture, and further combine men and weapons in order to create conditions for
 mastery of newer equipment.  If we simply grumble about the modernization of arms
 and equipment and put aside existing arms and equipment and not train with them, or
 if we do not study the modern military science that faces us, when the enemy comes
 what weapons will be used to annihilate him?  When new equipment comes into our
 hands, what skills will we possess to put them to use?
 If one bases himself on the equipment in his possession on the one hand while
 hastening the modernization of weapons and equipment on the other, will that render
 him unable to make a decision?  It will not.  The relationship between the two is
 one of particular things improving as the general situation improves.  In handling
 the development of weapons and equipment, the proper attitude should be firm con-
 viction that victory is entirely attainable through the use of weapons and
 equipment in ones pos::assion, while resolving gradually to improve weapons and
 equipment, steadily modernizing them.  To use a common saying to express the idea:
 Atomic bombs should be made, but hand grenades should not be tossed aside.

 NEED FOR MORE STUDY OF TACTICS STRESSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Jul 79 p 1
 [Article:  "Be a Qualified Commander"]
 [Text]  People praise Comrade Shan Da [1472 1129] as "a truly outstanding commander
 and a qualified commander."  Comrade Shan Da deserves such praise.
 An outstanding and qualified commander must possess at least two qualities:
 resourcefulness and courage.  Resourcefulness and courage on the battlefield are
 qualities discussed in ancient and modern times in both China and abroad.  Sun Zi
 placed resourcefulness and courage as the two major attributes to be cultivated by
 commanders.  The "Book of History" said, "When a person is valiant and clever, he
 may act," placing resourcefulness.and courage on an equal plain.  Marx and Engles
 said, "There are two kinds of bravery:  surpassing bravery, and bravery lacking in
 intelligence."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 6, p 359), which more
 clearly emphasizes the unity of resourcefulness and courage.  To possess courage
 without resourcefulness is to be a clumsy, death-defying bungler, which we do not
 need.  To possess courage without resourcefulness, when the guns sound, one will be
 at a loss about what to do.  Naturally, if one cannot put his resourcefulness to
 use, he will sustain defeat.  Only with a combination of courage and resourcefulness
 can one command forces, overcome the enemy, and attain victory.   Shan Da advanced
 bravely, charged and shattered the enemy's positions, judged the hour and sized
 up the situation, and acted flexibly just as a commander possessed of resourceful-
 ness and courage should.  Troops have heartfelt confidence in such a commander and
 will resolutely obey his commands and listen to his directions with heartfelt
 admiration.  Thus it becomes possible to have confidence from top to bottom, to be
 of one heart and one mind, and to march together to win victory in battle.
 Courage is one thing and resourcefulness is another.  Put the two together and
 only then is victory possible.  For many years Lin Biao and the "gang of four"
 made a mess of this truth.  They.distorted the spirit of bravery, threw tactical
 thinking into confusion, and "criticized" the accurate saying that a "superbly
 skilled person has great courage."  This was extremely damagining to the training
 of our cadres, particularly to improving command skills within the armed forces.
 One may often hear the following said among some grassroots level cadres:  "When
 we're fighting, if superiors want us to attack, we attack; if they want us to
 defend, we defend.  All we have to do is obey orders and listen to commands."  By

 this is meant that command is a matter for higher authority, and that it is only
 .listening to commands that is one's responsibility.  These comrades forget that it
 is the job of commanders to command.  On the battlefield, commanders.at all
 echelons have their individual command position, command requirements, command
 responsibilities, and scope of command.  "Ingenuity in application is a matter for
 the person taking action."  In the application of tactics, each echelon has its
 own ingenious ways.  If one is not versed in the command techniques of one's own
 echelon, when higher authorities orders that you attack, you will be unable to
 strike with irresistable force, and if they order you to defend, you will be hard
 put to really hold fast.   For units as large as regiments or armies, when commands
 are bad, the mission cannot be accomplished.  In the person. of a commander, issuing
 commands and receiving commands have always been closely related.  If you cannot
 command, you may not be able to follow commands reliably, either, and may become
 like a storeyed house built on a sandy beach.  When superior authority commanded
 Shan Da to lead a dagger platoon in an attack on certain high ground, had he not
 understood the command or blindly issued a command, the high ground would not have
 been taken and the combat intentions of superior authority would not be fulfilled.
 In that case, no matter          steadfastly he "listened to commands," would become
 a hollow phrase, would it not?
 Cadre training is the key point, but after many years of saying this, it is still
 Just a point without being the key point.  There is a tendency in this that is
 deserving of attention, namely supposijg that techniques are firm guidance but
 that tactics are soft guidance, and consequently emphasizing techniques while
 slighting tactics.  Techniques are the foundation for tactics.  When Shan Da was
 on the battlefield, because he was able to fire rocket launchers, was able to use
 walkie-talkies, and could sight targets for the artillery, he was able to handle
 tactical command with ease and proficiency.  In this sense, emphasis on technique
 cannot be considered wrong.  Tactics are the assurance that techniques will play
 their full role.  During this combat, use of small groups against dispersed forces
 and the searching out of forces in concealment demonstrated the power of correct
 utilization and variation of tactics.  Unless tactics have a built in system for
 changing as the enemy changes, or changing ahead of the enemy, then even though
 one may be superior in rifles and guns, not all of them may be able to be used,
 coordination may be bad, and one may mistakenly injure one's own troops,  There-
 fore, to slight tactics is unreasonable.  As far as our own commanders are concerned,
 a general knowledge of all kinds of weapons, their requirements for use, and their
 combat capabilities is essential, but the key still lies in the study of tactics
 and striving to master command techniques for one's own echelon of organization.
 If one were to say soldiers are "courageous and technical," then commanders must
 be "courageous and tactical."  The problem now is that leadership comrades in some
 units are a little "partial."  They are interested only in things such as the number
 of points or the number of meters, but are unable to become interested in the
 tactical training of cadres.  Some feel that "the study of formations is not
 agreeable, and the study of tactics is not something people are good at."  Under
 the influence of such a mentality, even if some tactical training is given, it is,
 "the squads attack bim bam; platoons attack for 5 minutes; companies attack in a
 big uproar."  Quality is not high.  A rapid end to this state of affairs may be
 said to be an urgent matter of the moment in the reform of training.
 Insufficient attention to the study of strategy and tactics, and insufficient
 attention to improving the standards for command are related to the failure of

 some of our comrades to divorce themselves from the fetters of a single branch of
 service mental concept, and accustomed attitudes.  Fighting armies are presently in
 a historical  stage of change from single branches of service to combined forces.
 As both the enemy and our own weapons and equipment develop,  there will be great
 changes, as well, in the style of warfare.  In order to adapt to these changes,
 troop training and combat must see great changes.  When tables of equipment,
 education, training, and command organization are shown to be unsuitable, and when
 new problems appear, they must be rapidly studied and solved.  When we speak of
 being a qualified commander, their term "qualified" means a process of constantly
 moving forward as circumstances change.  Those formerly qualified for combat command
 may be still qualified for combat command today, or they may not be qualified.  Those
 who went through the recent self-defense counterattack combat can see this problem
 very.clearly can't they?  At the 1975 enlarged Military Affairs Committee meeting,
 deputy chairman Deng Xiaoping spoke very descriptively:  To be a company cotm_iander
 today is not the same as being a company commander in the past.  The company
 commander of the past would pick up his Mauser pistol and 'charge'!  It's not that
 easy now, and it is different than it used to be.  The company commander's needs
 for information are much greater than formerly.  When war breaks out and you have
 several tanks and an artillery company attached to your unit, how will you command
 them!  The talk here is about a company commander, and the question is to a company
 commander. But it would also not hurt for our battalion commanders, regimental
 commanders, or even our divisional or army commanders to ask themselves:  Are my
 commanders qualified or not?  When a new war comes, what kind of an answer will I
 be able to give?

 ALL FLEETS CONDUCT TRAINING FOR SENIOR HEADQUARTERS OFFICERS
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 18 Sep  79 p 1
 [Article by Correspondent Luo Tongsong [5012 0681 26461:  "Navy Intensifies
 Headquarters Training for All Echelons of Senior Officers To Meet Requirements of
 Modern Naval War and To Increase Organization and Command Capabilities"]
 [Text]  Recently the navy conducted an examination and summarization of this year's
 headquarters training for senior officers, and set forth the future direction and
 -requirements of training.
 During recent years substantial transfers of personnel in combat units of various
 naval forces have taken place, and some staff officers are not well-versed in
 wartime command work.  In a situation of constant development of naval techniques
 and equipment, in particular, in which electronic confrontation has become a major
 technique of naval war, and in which guided missiles are gradually becoming major
 strike weapons, greater demands are placed on headquarters work.  Not only to staff
 personnel urgently require improvement of their professional abilities, but even
 those staff personnel in position for a rather long period of time who possess
 rather strong professional skills also require constant understanding of new cir-
 cumstances and study of new problems in order to meet the requirements of modern
 naval war.
 Beginning this year, senior officers and leadership organizations in the navy will
 devote strict attention to senior officer headquarters training.  Navy leadership
 organizations have set up professional military training units for the participation
 of senior naval officers and large unit leadership comrades for the purpose of
 exploring the characteristics of future naval combat, as well as the guiding combat
 mentality and the tactical and strategic principles for our own.forces.  As of now,
 10 courses have been set up requiring 72 hours of study.  Headquarters is operating
 three staff officer training classes for the study of general information about
 naval branches, navigation, and staff functions.  During August, two. short training
 courses were organized on the subject of "Military Applications of Overall Planning
 Methods" in which more than 300 professional cadres were training.  At the instiga-
 tion of naval leadership organizations, all fleets, bases, detachments, and garrison
 districts are also giving serious attention to senior officers headquarters training.
 During the first half of the year, units above the division level in the North Sea
 Fleet ran a total of 10 staff training courses.  The South China Sea Fleet organized
 headquarters at 311 echelons on several occasions for chart exercises.  The East

 China Sea Fleet convened leadership cadre exercise meetings for above division level
 in which exercise experiences were summarized and exchanged and chart work done.
 Units at certain bases of the East China Sea Fleet organized staff personnel for
 group training more than 40 times, with more than 1,430 people participating in
 the training.
 In the course of the senior officer headquarters training, each echelon was at some
 pains to closely approximate actual combat.  Some units combined the characteristics
 of their naval area with tasks handed them by superior authorities to conduct
 diligent study and exercise training.  Some units organized airmen, submarines,
 destroyers, guided missile boats, and other surface craft to participate in
 combined exercises to train combat units under various complex circumstances,
 and to put into practice organizational and command capabilities.
 In the course of training, all units also lay great stress on major training points.
 The number one characteristic of modern naval warfare is speed.  "Targeting,"
 "calculating," and "commanding" must be done quickly and accurately.  This is a
 masterly skill that staff personnel must prepare.  In the training process for each
 unit, staff personnel were required quickly, accurately, and in a minimum amount
 of time to plot the foe's position relative to our own.  Some units also required
 rapidly calculating the time, direction, and speed of attack of four or five assault
 groups.
 The serious attention given senior officer headquarters training by the navy made
 all echelons of headquarters and staff personnel well-versed in combat operations,
 and increased their combat professional levels.  A certain base made spot examina-
 tion of the chief and deputy chief of staff, and of 35 section chiefs and staff
 personnel of a division level unit in which the problem was attack on an enemy
 cruiser formation.  Examination results showed overall evaluation of proficiency at
 better than good.  Some comrades said that the correlation of the enemy situation
 and repeated exercises gave training a quality of realism.  A month's concentrated
 training was better than a year's ordinary professional study.

 CONSCRIPTS EXHORTED TO SACRIFICE INDIVIDUAL WELFARE TO REVOLUTION
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 11 Jan 81 p 4
 [Article: "Wholeheartedly Fulfill the Glorious Obligation of Defending the
 Motherland"]
 [Text]  The responsibilities we shoulder are lofty; the obligations to the mother-
 land that we fulfill are glorious, and both the motherland and the people hold
 extremely great expectations of us.  Consequently, we must overcome impure motives
 for entering military service, establish a correct attitude of military service,
 and wholeheartedly fulfill the glorious obligation of defending the motherland.
 In order to defend the motherland, comrades consciously submit to the needs of the
 motherland, coming from everywhere including cities, rural villages, industrial
 plants, and schools to join the armed forces.  Some comrades give up opportunities
 to go into industrial plants or attend university, and some give up substantial
 wage income and comfortable living conditions to enter military units to fulfill
 obligations amply demonstrating a patriotic awareness, which is praiseworthy.
 However, as the result of a lack of awareness on the part of some of our comrades
 about becoming soldiers to fulfill obligations, after they become soldiers, they
 frequently are unable to handle the interrelationship between individual welfare
 and fulfillment of obligations to the people, and feel they have suffered as a
 result of being a soldier.  Everyone knows that certain rights and certain obliga-
 tions are mutually complementary.  If in earlier times the people of the entire
 country had not undertaken and obligation to resist the Japanese and fight the
 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, what right would the people have today to be masters in
 their own house.  Unless we undertake our obligation to defend the motherland
 today and safeguard the four modernizations, what right will we have in future to
 enjoy the well-being of a "comfortable family?"  In taking responsibility for the
 defense of our motherland and the obligation to safeguard the four modernizations,
 our armed forces are representing the fundamental welfare of the working people,
 which ramifies to the well-being of posterity. Consequently, from the day that we
 become soldiers, we should unconditionally subordinate our individual welfares
 to the welfare of the revolution.  During Spring and Autumn Times, Sima Rangju, a
 general, said:  "When you receive orders, forget your families; when you face
 military regimentation forget your relatives, and when you feel anxious at the
 sound of the rolling battle drums, forget your own safety."  If the ancients could
 be this way about the country, we should be possessed of an even greater spirit
 of self-sacrifice.

 Establish a Concept of Fulfilling Obligations to the Country and Overcome Impure
 Motivations for Entering Military Service
 Some comrades enter military service to find individual opportunities for them-
 selves.  Their way of thinking is, "First year as a soldier, second year in the
 party, and third year get a discharge and enter a plant."  Otherwise they think
 of driving motor vehilcles, becoming a health worker, or learning a.technique of
 some kind to catch hold of an "iron ricebowl."  Thus, they become soldiers, not
 to fulfill obligations, but rather to parlay their situation into going into a
 .city to find a job.  Comrades should think that every year the armed forces call
 up large numbers of youths from rural villages to enter military service, while
 at the same time a large number of old soldiers retire.  In the current situation
 in which China's productivity is fairly backward, if everyone goes into the city
 or goes into an industrial plant, how much of an increase of people eating
 commodity grain will occur in the cities?  How can the country stand it?  Unless
 rural youths return to rural villages, on whom will the modernization of agricul-
 ture depend for its fulfillment?  If everybody in the armed forces would like to
 do technical work, who will do the non-technical work, and how will combat and
 other tasks be completed?  Therefore, when we become soldiers, we must establish
 a concept of fulfillment of obligations, and not have as our goal the finding of
 opportunities for ourselves.  Our "opportunity" lies not in going into cities but
 in. remaining in rural villages, and neither does it lie in becoming an industrial
 worker, but rather in becoming a commune member.  Even less does it lie in doing
 some particular work, but rather in making a contribution to the modernization
 of the country no matter what work we may do.  Some comrades have the right idea
 when they say that revolutionary work contains all trades and professions, each
 possessing its own leading authority, and each having a future.  So long as during
 our period of military service we strive to learn the skill of serving the people
 and improve our competence, no matter where we may go in the future, there will
 be bright prospects.  When productivity decreases, family economic income must
 inevitably decrease as well, and livelihood becomes somewhat impaired.  However,
 the more wealthy the country becomes, and the more the four modernizations develop,
 the more our personal welfare can be realized.  One cannot suppose on this account
 that to become a soldier is to get the worst of things.  Combat hero Liang Yingrui
 [2733 5391 38431 said it well:  "Without trees, where would fruit come from, and
 without a country, where would the family come from?"  We often speak of "protec-
 ting the family and defending the country."
 This concisely and clearly explains the inevitable relationship between protecting
 ..the country and protecting the family.  When we become a soldier today it is not
 just to protect the millions upon millions of parents, brothers, and sisters, it
 is also for the purpose of protecting one's own parents, brothers and sisters.
 ,It is not only to protect the families of others, but also to protect one's own
 family..  In this sense, how can we get the worst of things when we become soldiers?'
 If one says that we get the worst of things when we become soldiers, the tens of
 thousands of martyrs who heroically sacrificed their lives got even more of the
 worst of things, did they?  When Dong Cunrui [5516 1317 38431, Huang Jiguang
 [7806 4949 03421, Luo Guangxie [5012 0342 36101, Yu Qingyang [0060 1987 71221,.
 Liang Yingrui [2733 5391 38431, and Li Chengwen [2621 2052 24291 sacrificed
 themselves to the common good, they had no thought of getting the worst of things
 as individuals.  Quite the contrary; they were fully prepared mentally for

 individual sacrifice.  After they had sacrificed themselves for the motherland and
 for the people, the families of numerous martyrs sent the younger brothers and
 younger sisters of the martyrs to military units to take up the arms left by the
 martyrs. If one says that to be a soldier is to get the worst of things, why then
 did they keep on taking the worst of things and go looking for the worst of things?
 On the contrary, they not only had no sense of getting the worst of things, but
 felt exalted.   We should learn from the revolutionary martyrs, and correctly
 handle the relationship between the welfare of the revolution and personal welfare.
 We should also realize that the party and government as well as the broad masses
 of people are exceptionally solicitous about the livelihood of the families of
 soldiers, have taken a series of measures, and have exerted very great efforts
 to look after them and give them preferential treatment.  After rural villages
 implemented the party's economic policies and instituted systems of responsibility
 for production, the CCP Central Committee and government departments at all
 echelons adapted to the new situation, adopting various measures to assure that
 the livelihood of dependents of military martyrs would be no longer than that of
 local commune members at the medium level.  The "CCP Central Committee Decisions
 on Some Questions Concerning the Acceleration of Agricultural Development" clearly
 stipulated that once rural villages have instituted systems of responsibility for
 production, "as the collective economy develops, collective welfare endeavors.
 should gradually be undertaken whereby the old and the infirm, orphans and widows,
 disabled commune members, and disabled military men, and the families of martyrs
 receive greater assurance of their livelihoods."  Each province, municipality and
 autonomous regions has done a lot of work in the implementation of party policies
 on special care for disabled servicemen, and for family members of revolutionary
 martyrs and servicemen.  At the Third Session of the Fifth National People's
 Congress, numerous delegates referred to the issue of supporting the armed forces
 and giving special care to their dependents.  In the course of discussions, some
 made speeches saying that "effective measures should be taken to resolve hardships
 in the families of soldiers, and that just as during the period of the Red Army,
 the livelihood of the families of soldiers should be no lower than it had been
 before the soldier entered the armed forces."  In actual fact, every jurisdiction
 is in process of implementating special care policies in accordance with instruc-
 tions from the Central Committee.  Some of our military units have also received
 numerous notices in the mail of preferential workpoints and cash assistance.  Of
 course, the families of some comrades continue to suffer hardships in their lives
 and we should believe that on this issue the party and the government will gradu-
 ally help find solutions.
 Some urban comrades who entered military service had formerly intended to enter
 university or take up an occupation.  Now they have answered the call to enter
 the armed forces.  Their thoughts had been "first to college and then to work,
 but never becoming a soldier."  They regarded soldiering as a course of last
 resort, and this view is also a wrong one.  Unless it is corrected, it may easily
 produce an attitude of simply muddling through in one way or another for the three
 years of service, or may even produce a mercenary mentality.  Going to college
 and taking up an occupation are all very well and good, of course.  There is
 nothing wrong with them, and they are neither higher nor lower than becoming a
 soldier.  When the npriod of service for comrades has been completed, they may
 still take up occupations, and if conditions permit, they may go to college, too.

 The question is now that they are soldiers, is that worse than going to college
 or taking up an occupation.  We say that being a soldier is the fulfillment of an
 obligation and not the selection of a profession. It is different from taking up
 an occupation or going to college.  The people of the motherland have confidence
 in us, and have handed us the guns.  It is incumbent upon us earnestly and
 conscientiously to fulfill our obligation and take up the heavy burden the people
 have given us.  This glorious position also provides us a fine opportunity to
 temper ourselves..  After several years of tempering, improvement in our ideol-
 ogical consciousness, further strengthening of our will, and increase in our
 cultural knowledge and some specialized knowledge will create better conditions
 for our future employment.  If you lackadaisically muddle through a few years in
 the armed forces, neither striving to learn nor assiduously tempering yourself,
 but rather throwing your youth away for nothing, without making any progress so
 that you possess no skills to take up future employment, you can only blame your
 own incorrect attitude.
 Still other comrades figure that they will first become soldiers when they go into
 the armed forces, and then become cadres with some official position, figuring
 that this is fulfillment of their obligations as soldiers.  Nowadays, in order to
 improve the military and political quality of cadres, our armed forces have changed
 the system of selecting cadres directly from among company level soldiers, requir-
 ing that they undergo training in military schools.  Some cadres that their desire
 to be a cadre is a good one, and that all they have to do is strive to learn
 military matters, politics and culture and meet other requirements.  Then after
 testing  shows them qualified, they will be able to enter a military school for
 further  preparation and become a cadre.  But this is a matter of future develop-
 ment.  For the moment, most important is fulfillment of obligations, and being a
 good soldier.  This is to say that conscripts do not necessarily have no chance
 of entering military schools for study to become cadres, but neither does it mean
 that you will be promoted to cadre simply because you have become a soldier.
 If one holds to the idea of becoming a soldier in order to become a cadre, it may
 be very difficult for one to become an "official," because if you are thinking only
 of yourself, and calculating everything in terms of becoming an official, you
 cannot consciously fulfill your obligations.  And if you cannot do a good job of
 being a compulsory soldier, how can you expect to be a cadre?
 Still other comrades have rather simple ideas.  They are not concerned with working
 or not working, or whether they have a lot of money or little; all they care about
 is traveling around, seeing everything possible, and hoping with all their hearts
 to go to a large city.  This is, in fact, unrealistic.  Where military forces are
 garrisoned, and the duties they perform are the result of consideration of the
 overall situation and the needs for combat preparedness.  When we become soldiers,
 we may possibly go to a bustling city, or possibly to somewhat out-of-the-way rural
 village, or possibly to an uninhabited island or border area.  None of this can
 be changed to suit our individual wills.  It must also be realized at the same
 time that we are carrying out lofty and glorious responsibilities, and we cannot
 think only of light tasks, but rather must be mentally prepared to sweat a great
 deal and suffer hardships.  For future combat, it is necessary as well to prepare
 to shed blood in resolute fulfillment of the heavy trust of the people of the
 motherland.  Being a soldier cannot be regarded as something that is nice and
 relaxed and a lot of fun.  Of course, depending on mission requirements, movement
 to a new place to do guard duty or undergo training, with a chance to see the

 beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, may also expand one's horizons.
 But the "horizon" of hoping to be sent to a large city, is too narrow a one.
 Strictly Require Oneself To Be an Outstanding Conscript
 It is by no means strange that among comrades who strictly require themselves to
 be outstanding draftees that there is this or that kind of petty concern.  Before
 they have understood the meaning of fulfilling their obligations as soldiers,  it
 is difficult for some comrades not to have this or that idea.  But once we under-
 stand the rationale for fulfillment of obligations as soldiers, we should rid
 ourselves of those petty concerns, and earnestly fulfill our obligations as fully
 as possible.  It must be acknowledged that in the fulfillment of obligations as
 soldiers, some matters of individual welfare must be temporarily shelved.
 In terms of the immediate, one might say this is a hardship.  But hardhip of this
 kind is for the fundamental welfare of the people, and is entirely appropriate.
 The loftiness of responsibility and the glory of duty of a people's soldier lie
 precisely in making this kind of sacrifice.  Moreover, every youth of age must
 encounter a similar problem.  In long range terms, fulfillment of obligations as
 a soldier, safeguarding the security of the motherland, and defending the building
 of the four modernizations is, at once, also safeguarding the peaceful work of
 one's own parents, brothers and sisters.  Is it not true that our generation is
 able to grow up in health because during the past more than 20 years group after
 group of youths became soldiers and carried out their obligations, guaranteeing
 the security of the motherland and creating for us a peaceful environment in which
 smooth growth was possible?  Today when we fulfill our obligations, the young
 children also benefit.  As far as our working people are concerned, if we depart
 from the security of the country, the independence of our people and the prosperity
 of the motherland, there will be no individual or family well-being, and that will
 indeed be great suffering.  Furthermore, we should also realize that even though
 everyone fulfills obligations, the government still gives our families needed
 material care and glorious political treatment.  For comrades, all clothing, food
 and housing needs are provided for, for some better than before they became
 soldiers.  During their period of military service, comrades can also become
 steeled, can study various techniques, and can increase their knowledge, creating
 valuable conditions for their future growth.  We must not overlook this, being
 concerned only with hardships and not about benefits.
 In summary, we must combine individual welfare and the overall welfare, and unify
 immediate welfare and the longterm welfare, bearing firmly in mind the great trust
 of the motherland and the people, never forgetting that one is a glorious soldier
 of the people being tempered in the great furnace of the revolution, fulfilling
 one's duty and fulfilling one's responsibilities in standing guard and of doing
 sentry duty for the motherland, and fulfilling the various missions that the
 party and the people have handed us.   In launching a movement for striving to be
 an outstanding conscript, some military units proposed the following requirements
 for evaluating and comparing outstanding conscripts:   (1)  content to serve with
 correct handling of the relationship between individual welfare and the welfare of
 the revolution; (2) resolute implementation of the party line, programs, and
 policies, and the orders of superior authority; (3) satisfactory completion of
 education and training assignments; (4) good workstyle, discipline, and moral

 qualities; (5) respect for leaders, concern for comrades, and a spirit of fraternal
 unity.  Each and every comrade can use this to place severe requirements on himself
 to become an outstanding military conscript.
 Glory will forever belong to the soldiers of the people who contributed their
 youth to safeguarding the motherland and defending the four modernizations.

 BUILDING OF REAR AREA LOGISTICS DEFENSE FORCES DISCUSSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Jul  79 p 3
 [Article by Chen Yazhou [7115 0068 5297] and Liu,Shengjun [0491.0524.0193]:  "An
 Imperative Action; Several Views on Strengthening of Logistics Defense Forces"]
 [Text]  Victory in war depends on consolidation of the rear, and in modern warfare
 in particular, reliance on the rear is even greater.   Therefore, when waging war,
 both sides emphasize destruction of the opponent's logistics potential and supply
 .to the front as a major target of attack.  In World War II, one of the major
 reasons for Germany's defeat was that its rear was not consolidated.  The German
 force's battle line was wide and long, and the rear areas were weakly defended
 with no attention being given to their defense.  The Soviet forces used.this weak-
 ness of the German forces, to organize various kinds of small force units to attack
 the German force's rear supply lines, finally making it impossible for German army
 logistics to continue to support the war, and being wiped out in the end.  Apart
 from the political reasons for Napoleon's defeat on his distant march into Russia,
 another reason was a lack of precautionary defense of his supply lines, which
 consequently sustained attack and destruction at the hands of the Russian forces.
 From this may be seen that in order to take full and timely advantage of the role
 of various supply techniques and combat materials in modern warfare, and to assure
 uninterrupted supply to combat forces by rear area supply, a rather strong
 logistics defense force is needed.
 How can logistics defense forces be strengthened.  A look at the situation of
 China's forces today shows only four ways of doing the job:
 Building a logistics defense unit.   From the time of founding up until the present
 time, China's armed forces have never had a specialized logistics defense unit.
 Along with the need to modernize China's armed forces will come security functions,
 personnel assignments and an organizational structure on behalf of logistics in
 the armed forces.  Today when we propose the establishment of defense units,
 platoons, and organizations within the table of organization of logistics, it is
 because of the changes in our own forces and the situation existing in the armed
 forces of numerous countries.  The United States armed forces, for example, give
 serious attention to strengthening of logistics defense forces.  The United States
 Army National Guard established the 139 Rear Area Combat Center in Raleigh, North
 Carolina in 1973.  It was organized from among toops of the 30th Armored infantry

 Division.  United States Army regulations provide that every military commander and
 every support group commander in an army combat zone shall have a rear area combat
 center.  When the army is fighting independently, it is required that two rear area
 combat centers be organized.                Each combat center will have 17 officers and 50
 enlisted men who have undergone specialized training to be divided into five units.
 Combat logistics units shall be composed of specialists from different branches of
 services and will be responsible for guarding and carrying out rear area defense
 tasks, including intelligence, communications, anti-airdrop, anti-airraid, engineers,
 military police, "three defenses" and disassembly of explosive devices.  Each unit
 can control from two to four rear area guard platoons.  Battalion level and bri-
 gade level rear area guard platoons may coordinate discussion of guard matters
 with reserve units close by the rear area logistical units.  When enemy attack or
 infiltration is on a large scale to the extent that logistics defense platoons
 lose their capability to guard, combat units may be dispatched to take up specially
 prescribed guard duties in order to assure smooth execution of rear area logistics
 security work.  Division level rear area defense measures and their methods of
 execution are identical with those of the battalion and brigade levels.
 The American army's National Guard rear area logistics combat center method is.
 deserving of our study and consideration.  Can units at the army level and above in
 our armed forces establish a rear area logistics defense combat command?  Is it
 possible under such a command to establish highly. mobile forces, platoons, and
 organizations composed of various branches of service?  During war time, these
 forces and field combat forces attached to rear areas, local forces, and militia
 could jointly decide rear defense plans, or else units and organizations sub-
 ordinate to the command could take direct responsibility for organizing and
 directing units and militia attached to them in rear areas for unified deployment
 and use.  All echelons of rear area logistics below the army level, could, depending
 on circumstances, organize a corresponding number of defense units such as a combat
 logistics regiment (or battalion) by a field combat army, divisional organization
 of a combat logistics battalion (or company), and organization by regiment of a
 combat logistics company (or platoon).  These units would be the main force of
 logistics defense at each echelon, and these main forces would play a major role
 in organizing, at their own echelon, logistics personnel and attached local
 militia to conduct various security and defense duties for logistics.
 Armed rear area logistics personnel.  Under modern warfare conditions, use of
 advanced weapons and equipment to arm rear area logistics personnel to increase
 logistic's forces (platoon) self-defense capabilities, is a matter to which
 numerous countries are giving extremely close attention.  During recent years,
 the Soviet armed forces have not only armed their rear area logistics forces.
 with relatively advanced logistics security techniques and equipment, but have
 also required that each logistics person be equipped with one or two types of
 combat weapons.  The Soviety navy has also established a naval combat logistics
 defense support squadron able to operate several thousand nautical miles away from
 its bases.  Therefore, perfection of defense combat equipment for rear area logis-
 tics personnel is necessary to meet the combat needs of our armed forces' logistics.
 Analyzed in terms of realities in our armed forces' logistics forces (platoons),
 drivers, repair personnel, sanitation personnel, cooks and provisioners, maintenance
 personnel and communications personnel could all be equipped  with light weapons,

 one to each person being best.  Some logistics units (platoons) might also be
 equipped with anti-aircraft machineguns, or rocket launchers and such heavy weapons
 or new weapons.  In the course of the recent self-defense counterattack against
 Vietnam, a motorcar unit equipped with several anti-aircraft machineguns could
 handle small groups of attacking enemy.  Now, if equipped with a certain number of
 weapons and given appropriate combat training when other specialized training is
 given them, our railroad troops, engineers, and linemen could become a strong
 logistics defense force.
 Intensification of defensive combat training of logistics personnel.  On the basis
 of the foregoing, specialized training and rear area logistics defense tactical
 training for rear area logistics forces (or platoons) is very necessary.
 Depending on the work to be done by rear area logistics units, while undergoing
 rear area logistics tactical and technical training rear area logistics defense
 forces should undergo diversified special knowledge training, and while undergoing
 specialized training, logistics personnel should undergo military training in
 which each person should be required to thoroughly master his own weapon and be
 able to use terrain features in defensive combat.  Logistics personnel training and
 defense forces training should have a different emphasis, and content of training,
 courses, and times should be of suitable proportions.
 Organizing Militia to Do Defense Work.   Countless times during the revolutionary
 war and during the more recent defensive counterattack combat against Vietnam,
 militia have supported the front lines and guarded the rear, making great contribu-
 tions in both and demonstrating the great power of people's war.  However, because
 modern wars of the future will be conducted in three dimensions with battlefield
 conditions being complex and ever changing, for militia to undertake the arduous
 task of defending rear area logistics, they must be thoroughly organized and
 rationally used.  The main matters that must be given attention are as follows:
 (1)  When militia participate in wartime rear area logistics defense, they.must
 be organized sufficiently well in advance with emergency training being given them
 on top of their regular training, so that they will understand their duties, and
 be familiar with the organizational structure and personnel.  Under ordinary cir-
 cumstances, militia should not be permitted to carry out their duties alone.  The
 militia organization also should not be made large, for when the military organ-
 izations become large, it presents a large target and becomes prone to enemy
 attack.  Most militia organizations should consist of small platoons exercising;
 their duties.  These small platoons should operate in conjunction with defense
 forces or be organized and led by persons from main force units.  All militia
 platoons should operate under the overall organization and command of rear area
 logistics defense units, platoons (or teams).
 (2)   Participation of militia in defense work should be permitted only after
 selection.  Depending on the quality of military and political training and the
 health of common militiamen and grassroots cadre militiamen, militia platoons or
 teams should be organized to undertake different kinds of defense tasks.  Militia
 platoons (or teams) with fairly strong combat capabilities should accompany main
 force units in defense of rear area logistics bases, communications hubs, important

 bridges, and such major rear area installations.  At the same time some mainstay
 militia can be organized to work with defense forces in being responsible for
 surrounding and annihilating enemy spies and enemy airborne troops in rear areas.
 (3) Under modern warfare conditions, militia accompanying rear area logistic
 defense forces should be fully armed and should enjoy the same emoluments as
 on-duty troops.  All fully armed militia should be thoroughly organized and rigor-
 ously trained so that these mainstay militia are thoroughly familiar with their own
 weapons, and possess specialized knowledge of a. series of defense matters such as
 standing guard, doing sentry duty, and being on the alert to act as a mobile,
 capable and vigorous defense force possessed of great combat strength.

 "General Staff, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department
 Promulgate Army Boat Regulations.  General Logistics Department    Run Short
 Training Classes for Boat Unit Leadership Cadres, and    Study Measures for
 Putting Regulations Into Full Effect"]
 [Text]  In order to accord with the shift in the Party's work focus and build an
 army boat unit compatible with the needs of combat forces in island, border
 defense, and internal waterway areas, the General Staff, the General Political
 Department, and the General Logistics Department have recently promulgated the
 "Chinese People's Liberation Army Army Boat Regulations."
 Army boat units will conduct communications and tranportation, reconnaissance and
 patrols, combat training, and special operational tasks from Heilongjiang in the
 north to the vast coastal areas and territorial seas of South China Sea islands...
 It will be a major force in carrying out various kinds of marine security for the
 army and the airforce.  Because of the development and renewal of equipment of the
 army boat units, the "Army Boat Management System" promulgated by the General
 Logistics Department in 1960 is no longer suitable.  Following investigation and
 study by the three departments, summarization of 30 years of practical experiences
 by army boat units, and absorption of advanced experiences of the navy and other
 technical branches of service, the "Chinese People's Liberation Army Army boat
 Regulations" were promulgated.
 The "Regulations" continue and carry forward the fine tradition and work style of
 our armed forces, carry out and strengthen combat preparation and war preparedness
 programs, and are a fine charter for the building of boat forces.  In issuing the
 notice about the "Regulations," the three departments strongly noted that "this
 regulation is the foundation of technical security for army and airforce boat
 units to manage, conduct military training, organize and deploy, dispatch and use."
 In order to rapidly implement the "Regulations," between 1 July and 19 August
 the General Logistics Department ran two short training classes for boat unit
 leadership cadres.  Comrades involved in the training conscientiously studied
 the "Regulations."  Everyone said that the "Regulations" reflect the objective

 laws of boat equipment, are rules for instituting scientific utilization and
 management, and are a set of rules and regulations for the various activities of
 boat units.  With them, we have grounds for taking action; work has standards, and
 combat has objectives.  The short training class also took account of the work
 needs of leadership cadres in studying "Regulations on Avoidance of Collision ,H
 formulation and approval of navigation plans, and such special knowledge.  Boat
 units from Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shenyang military forces gave separate briefings
 on training experiences in guarding against typhoons and fighting typhoons, three
 defenses, and navigation in fog.
 As a result of their study of the "Regulations," everybody realized more clearly
 the position and function of army boat units, and had an increased sense of respons-
 ibility.  All large units also made concentrated study of ways to carry out the
 "Regulations."  Some units are preparing this year to group train all cadres, and
 some are preparing to train only half at first.  Next year, all army boat units
 will carry out the "Regulations" to the full.

 GOOD CARE OF HORSES STRESSED PENDING ABILITY TO REARM WITH MODERN EQUIPMENT
 Guangzhou ZHANSHI BAO in Chinese 11 Mar 81 p 2
 [Article:  "Work Concerning Military Horses Cannot Be Neglected"]
 [Text]  It is said nowadays that the armed forces will be mechanized and modernized,
 so mules and horses have become an antiquated means of transportation with little
 use.   Consequently, in some units, mules and horses have not been a matter of con-
 cern for a long time; their feeding and care has been careless, and they are with-
 out shelter and lack fodder.  The incidence of sickness is also comparatively high,
 resulting in a large number of deaths or early retirements from service, with great
 losses both for our combat preparations and our economy.
 Do mules. and horses still have any function in modern warfare?  A look at the self-
 defense counterattack against Vietnam provides the answer.  In this combat, which
 lasted only 28 days and penetrated 80-odd kilometers into Vieti}am,.in addition to
 the use of military horses directly involved in combat with combattant units, a
 large number of civilian horses were used to support the front, transporting
 material for units.   For some units, goods transported by military horses amounted
 to more than one-third the total amount of goods transported.  During fighting in
 the direction of Caobinh, in particular, as our forces advanced to the Banong area,
 the enemy put up a life and death struggle, suddenly dynamiting the dam of a reser-
 voir and sending a torrent of water to cover the highways.  Motor vehicles could
 not pass, and under these circumstances, commanders actively organized mules and
 horses for transport, actually transporting case after case of war material to the
 front lines to assure victory in the battle.  These facts strongly attest to tie
 continuing important function and position of mules and horses in modern warfare.
 Considering that any future war in our region will be in mountains, hills, and
 forest areas, and be limited by the topography and the roads, in situations where
 transportation of materials by motor vehicles would be very difficult, in order to
 maintain the mobility of forces and supply logistical materials, it would be
 necessary to make the most of the role of mules and horses.  As Deputy Chairman Ye
 Jianying said:   "In future wars, both plains and mountain areas will be battle-
 fields, but in holding out for long periods of time, mountain areas will be impor-
 tant.  Consequently, mules and horses cannot be neglected.                  Motor vehicles, mules
 and horses are two legs to walk on."
 Additionally, it is necessary to realize that China is still very poor, and that
 science and technology is not developed.  In order to further readjust the national
 economy, it is not possible to allocate more funds to replace the equipment of the

 armed forces.  Therefore, a process will be required to mechanize and modernize
 China's armed forces.  We must base ourselves upon the use of inferior equipment
 to win victory over enemies with superior equipment.  Mules and horses continue to
 be a major combat force and cannot be suddenly abolished.  In the case of the two
 super powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, despite their possession
 of the world's most advanced transportation equipment, for the defense of their
 own soil, they still maintain a certain number of military horses.  Therefore, we
 must keep our eyes on the overall situation on the one hand, think of the future,
 and actively improve upon our antiquated weapons and equipment.  On the other hand,
 it is also necessary to face current realities and do a better job of military
 horse work.  Every echelon of leadership should take this task firmly in hand,
 place it on their agendas, discuss it several times each year, make all out efforts
 several times each year, build up a corps of military pack train drivers, intensify
 training with military horses, be conscientious about prevention and treatment of
 military horse illnesses, do a good job of military horse material supply, and
 assure that every military horse is plump and sturdy, able to pack supplies and
 fit to travel.  In this way, when fighting breaks out, victory will be more secure.
