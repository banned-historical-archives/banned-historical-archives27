STATI NTL 
A historian whose 'chronicle of AnteritIlfIrst intelligence 
organization has just been published thinks the Vietnam con-
? Hid has distorted the role of intelligence in the war and cast 
/ 
ihe.Central Intelligence Agericy in a false role. 
. The historian,- IL Harris Smith, is on the faculty at UC 
'Berkeley, and he worked for a time in the CIA during the John-
son administration. His book, "OSS: The ?Secret History of 
- America's First Central Intelligence Agency," has just been re.-
leased. 
? In an interview, Smith 'said the CIA has borne the brunt of 
the blame for? the agony of American involvement In Indochina 
and has been cast as the bogeyrhan in the Vietnamese intrigue. 
"I think there are surely things wrong with the CIA, but 
. most of the blame for what's gone wrong in Vietnam falls to 
/the White house,'' said Smith. The author also said that the 
CIA. counseled against the Cambodian invasion ordered bY-
President Nixon two years ago, and warned repeatedly that 
bombing North Vietnam would be largely ineffective. 
The intelligence agency, said Smith, even informed the 
White House that. no American prisoners were present in the 
camp at Son Tay, North Vietnam, before anabortive American 
raid on the camp resulted in the embarrassment of failing to 
free any U.S. captives despite Serious risk to the raiding 
? forces. - .? ? 
"I think -that for the last three years we've seen a lot of 
. CIA intelligenee that has been disregarded by the White 
? House," Smith charged. The 28-year-old author left the CIA "as. 
' did many people. like me," because of disaffection with the ear-
]y phases of the massive Johnson escalation of the Vietnam 
war. . . 
. "Seeing your advice disregarded is just one of the frustra-
tions of intelligence work," Smith said. 
? In. researching his tale of the organization of the Office of 
' Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II, Smith said he 
' uncovered documents in the Stanford University library which 
still bore the "top secret" stamp. For that reason, the author 
. said, his reservations about the federal government's 'classifi-
cation system have been intensified. - 
"My feeling is that I wrote a book based on still-classified 
documents, even if they were -30 years old," Smith said. "The 
fact is that we have too much cla.ssilication." 
I. Smith said he has offered to testify for the defense in the 
espionage trial of Daniel Ellsberg, who supplied copies of the 
"Pentagon Papers" to the New York Times. 
"I knew people at the CIA who thought he ?(Ellsberg) was 
a great defense .analyst," said Smith. 
- "Leaking information is such a common practice," the au-
thor went on, "If you're high enough, you can do it with im-
punity. If you're low enough?like Ellsberg?you had better 
look out. ? 
. "There are things that should be kept- 'secret. But from 
'.-- ? -- ? -?- _ - ???? . 
what I've seen of the Pentagon papers, there's nothing in them 
to worry about."' ? 
Smith's hook, which was turned down by four publishers 
before being- accepted by the University of California Press, 
tells the story of the sometimes serious but often comical ef-
forts of Gen. William "Wild Bill" Donovan to organize the OSS. 
One anecdote in the work details the waste which occurrod 
early in the OSS program because the agency was not HA:rifted 
to account fol much of its budget of several- hundred million 
dollars. . ? - 
, One such inciden't, the book recalls, involved Donovan's ef-
forts to place an agent on an isolated island to which there was 
no steamship or airplane service. In the end, a freighter was 
bought for "several million dollars," but Donovan's operatives 
-subsequently realized that sending a whole ship to land one 
agent would seem, to say the least, conspicuous. The plan was 
scrapped, but the OSS lost track of the ship and no use was 
ever made of it.

/ The CIA has reported to President Nixon in 
,/ Peking that, as we withdraw our troops, the 
Red forces.are moving over Southeast Asia like 
termites on a log. The current alarm concerns 
Cambodia, Thailand and Burma, all three. 
Cambodia is only the size of Oklahoma but it 
has 6.7 million people. The President's Vietnam 
pull-out was threatened b.? '30000 North Viet-
namese in Cambodia. Our incursion into Cam-
bodia was a spoiling action covering our rear 
guard in Vietnam. But since then the keystone 
of the Nixon policy Vietnamization ? was 
tested by the Vietnamese Army's protectionary 
assault into Cambodia. And, as a demonstra-
tion to support the hope of Vietnamization, it 
was tragically unpromising. 
The CIA advised the President that the 
disintegration heightens. The Cambodian Army 
has only 35,000 men. Phnom Penh, the capital 
is Cut off, of course, except for a single uncer-
tain road, but the Reds have now finished for-
tifying even fabulous Angkor Wat and com-
pletley control strategic Tonle Sap, the great 
lake of Cambodia. Premier Lon Nol is pressed 
toward a cease-fire. ? 
THAILAND BORDERS on Cambodia; it 
stands between Cambodia, Laos and Burma. 
The Siamese (34.7 million people) call their 
? country Muang Thai, meaning Land of the Free 
People. 
It has always been fiercely independent. In 
fact, Thailand is the only nation in the entire 
area that never has been ruled by a foreign 
power. , 
But the CIA has notified Mr. Nixon that Thai 
Army Commanding Gen. Prapas Charusathien 
reports that liis units have intercepted Red 
Chinese and North Vietnamese soldiers cross-
ing into Thailand's Sisaket and Surin prov-
inces, 250 miles northeast of Bangkok. General 
Charusathien has .only a 141,500-man force to 
meet this expansion. 
U. S. AMBASSADOR TO CAMBODIA 
Emory C. Swank, in turn, apprised of this, is 
urging General Charusathien to add an army of 
ethnic Cambodians to meet Man Tse-tung and 
Chou eri-lai's expansion. 
? Burma, about the size of Texas, has a long 
common border with Thailand on Burma's 
Shan states. But Burma (27 million people), 
fabled in Kipling's verses, is as different from 
Thailand as day and night. The home cotintry 
of vacillating, mercurial former United NatiOns 
Secretary General U Thant, Burma is one of 
Southeast Asia's most inaccessible and 
mysterious countries 
Its actual name is the Pyee-Daung-lu 
Myanma Nainggan-Daw Union of Burma. The 
country is utterly provincial, totally fatalistic 
and unalterable Burmese. Neutralism, which 
likewise mesmerizes U Thant, is a fixation and 
isolationism a creed. ? ? 
BURMA CHIEF OF STATE Gen. No Win, 
60, his lidded eyes as rich as jade in a face as 
pale as bread and a man as wily and suspicious 
as U Thant himself, once told me in Mandalay, 
"Only Buddha can help anyone." And, not sur-
prisingly, Burma's Marxist economy - ap-
proaches absolute thrombosis. 
Burma has a wild, mountainous 1,200-Mile 
frontier ? a third as long as our Canadian 
border ? with Red China. Its armed forces 
total 137,500 men ? 6,500 of them ia a .com-
pletely meaningless Air Force. ? 
The CIA reported to President Nixon In 
Peking'that 20,000 China-a Fined insurgents 'are 
now battling these forces. They are in a Major 
engagement near Lashio, close to Red China's 
border. And, . reported the CIA, 3,000 North

that they can wait until Ne Win dies or ,Is 
booted out, as he booted out predecessor U Nu, 
and .then Red China will be sucked into Burnia

ecepti n on 
By Jack Anderson 
A secret exchange between 
Washington and Phnom Penh 
reveals that officials aren't 
telling the truth about the 
U.S. role in Cambodia. 
Because of congressional 
hostility, the Nixon adminis-
tration has pretended to take 
no active part in raising funds 
from other nations to support 
the tottering regime of Cam-
bodian strongman Lon Nol. 
The secret cables show, how-
ever, that the U.S. not only is 
bringing political pressure on 
other governments to con-
tribute to Lon Nol but has ac-
'Wally prepared a solicitation 
letter for Lon Nol's signature. 
Apparently, U.S. policymak-
ers don't trust the Cambodian 
leader to write his own letters 
on such a delicate matter. The 
appeal was supposed to be ad-
dressed "on a personal basis" 
to other heads of state who 
might have a little cash to 
spare for Cambodian aid. 
spread Incompetence and cor-
ruption throughout his govern-
ment. 
Compulsive Womanizer 
Even some of the able men 
under him were characterized 
respectively, as "an inveterate 
gambler," "a compulsive 
womanizer" and as a leader 
whose "personal authority is 
diluted by a tendency toward 
financial corruption." ? 
American Ambassador 
Emory Swank, in one secret 
report, criticized "Lon Nol's 
haphazard, out-of-channel and 
ill-coordinated conduct of mili-
tary operations." The result is 
that Communist hit-and-run 
harassing operations have de-
veloped?apparently much to 
the Viet Cong's surprise ? 
into a serious military treat to 
the Cambodian capital. 
Similar reports about some 
of South Vietnam's earlier po-
litical corruption and military 
bungling were kept secret 
from the American people. If 
the truth had been known in 
time, the U.S. might have been 
spared some of the lives and 
resources that have gone down 
the drain in Vietnam. 
Congressmen have balked at 
financing Lon Nol because of 
the dismaying similarity be-
tween his regime and some of 
the corrupt, floundering South 
Vietnamese regimes that have 
cost the American taxpayers a 
fortune. 
In an earlier column, we 
quoted from secret dispatches 
?that described Lon Nol as "a 
i'sick man, both physically and 
.pentally" and told of wide-
ole in C 
raise exchange support funds' 
for Cambodia. 
Cambodia "has undertaken 
to do its own representations 
to elicit donors for the ESF," a 
State Department spokesman 
told us blandly. 
Secret Instructions 
But secret instructions were 
cabled to the American Em-
bassy in Phnom Penh, declar-
ing: "We believe political ap-
proach necessary lest finance

opposed new aid programs, ar-

Better Deal 
for Service Spooks? 
WHITE HOUSE SOURCES tell The 
JOURNAL that the intelligence reor-
- ganjzation announced last month by the 
President means a better deal, not less 
authority?as the country's press has 
been reporting?for members of the 
defense intelligence Community. 
Among the specifics cited: ? 
o More "supergrades" (GS-16 to 
GS-18 civilian billets) for Defense Intel-
ligence Agency. 
o Assignment of top-caliber military 
personnel to DIA (which in past years 
has had trouble getting the most quali-
fied Military personnel assigned to it 
and proper recognition for their work in 
intelligence fields); 
o Better promotion opportunities 
for intelligence.znalysts (who in the past 
? have seldom been able to advance to top 
:.management levels without first break-
ing out into administrative posts that 
make little use of their analytical capa-
bilities). 
any 
STATINTLtook almost 10 months for the papers 
needed to justify the single high-level 
slot to filter through lower echelon 
administrative channels in the Pentagon 
before they could be forwarded, with a 
"strong endorsement" from Deputy De-
fense Secretary David Packard, to the 
Civil Service Commission. 
Ironically, just one day after The 
JOURNAL was told of the White 
House's determination to help get the 
billet approved, it was learned that the 
Civil Service Commission had neverthe-
less denied the request. Instead, it of-
fered DIA a choice of having an addi-
tional GS-17 slot or of having a Public. 
Law 313 post (which would require that 
DIA first recruit an individual highly 
qualified enough to justify the appoint-
ment). 
DIA's supergrade structure, neverthe-
less, is going to improve dramatically. 
For at least three years, the agency has 
been authorized only 15 supergrades, 
but will get 24 more under a. plan just 
endorsed by Dr. Albert C. Hall, DoD's ? 
new Assistant Secretary for Intelligenc.e. 
The posts are known to he endorsed 
strongly by both Defense Secretary Mel-
vin Laird and Deputy Defense Secretary ? 
David Packard, and apparently enjoy 
strong backing from the White House. as. 
well. 
By going from 15 to a tOtal of 39 
supergrade billets, DIA will be able not 
only to recruit higher caliber civilian 
personnel .but to promote more of its 
own qualified analysts into these covet-
ed, higher paying posts. 
Pres Misses the Point 
Press reporis on the intelligence reor-
ganization convey. a much different pic-
ture than the above highlights and White: 
House sources suggest. In a 22 Novem, 
ber feature, U.S. News & World Report 
noted in a lead paragraph that "The 
' Pentagon appears to be a loser in the. 
latest reshuffle." Deputy Defense Secre-, 
tary David Packard is probably the man 
most responsible for such interpreta-
tions. In a 4 November meeting with 
Pentagon reporters, just one day before 
the White House announced that CIA 
Director Richard Helms was being given 
new, community-wide responsibilities 
with authority over all intelligence bud-
gets, Packard said: "There have been 
people thinking if we just had someone 
over in the White House to ride herd on 
this overall intelligence that things 
would be improved. I don't really sup-
port that view. ... I think if anything 
we need ?a little less coordination from 
that point than more ...." ? 
The White House's determination to 
make the,defense intelligence field more 
well as civil-

STATI NTL 
This las point stems from a major 
White House concern with the nation's 
-intelligence product: "95% of the em-
phasis has been on collection', only 5% 
on analysis and production," as one 
White House staffer describes it. Yet 
good analysfs,.he points out, have faced 
major hurdles in getting recognition and 
advancement. Moreover, they have been 
"overwhelmed" by the amount of raw 
data collected by their counterparts in 
the more glamorous, more powerful, 
and better rewarded collection fields. 
The supergrade problem has been of 
special concern td the White House. A 
high Administration official, who asked 
not to be named, told The JOURNAL 
that the "White House [has] pledged to 
get Civil Service Commission ppi-oval" 
f6r- a GS-18 billet which had been 
urgently requested by DIA Director 
LGen Donal.d V. Bennett. Bennett, he 
said, first requested the billet more than 
a year ago. Even though DIA has not. 
? 0 LI 1" . Outgunned Spies 
A QUICK JOURNAL SURVEY of government-wide supergrade authorizations shows 
clearly that the Service side of the intelligence community, and DIA in particular, has 
been "low man on the supergrade totem pole" and makes clear why the White *House 
Intelligence reorganization is aimed, in part at least, at giving Service "spooks" better 
recognition and more attractive career opportunities. Here are typical (in some cases, 
ludicrous) comparisons that can be drawn from Part II of the Appendix to the Fiscal 
Year 19 72 Budget of the United States, a 1,112-page tome which gives, by federal 
agency, a detailed schedule of all permanent Civil Service positions: 
O DIA has 3,088 Civil Service employees, but only 15 supergrades?roughly one for 
every 200 spooks. 
o DoD's Office of Civil Defense has 721 Civil Service personnel, but 27 supergrades?
one for every 27 employees, a ratio eight-to-one better than DIA's. 
O The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with only 776 civil servants, 
has 36 supergrades'?one out of every 22, nine times better than DIA. The Peace Corps 
also outguns DIA nine to one, with 52 Foreign Service billets in the GS-16 to GS-18 
salary brackets for only 1,188 permanent federal positions. 
O The National Security Council staff has a 23-to-one advantage, 73 staffers and nine 
supergrade (or higher) billets. Even NSC's one-to-nine supergrade-to-staff ratio, however, 
pales by comparison with the President's Office of Science and Technology, which has 23 
superposts but only 60 people! ? 
Here's how the supergrade-to-people bean count for key federal agencies compares 
with DIA's (where authorized, executive level 1 through V posts are included in 
supergrade count):

to personnel increases alone. Although 
this year's aid program for Cambodia 
calls for $211 million in military aid, $110 
million in economic assistance and $20 
million in agricultural commodities for 
a- total of $341 mllion--a net increase of 
$59 million over last year?the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff apparently want another 
$52 million for military a-id. 
According to a story in the New York 
Times October 13, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff have designed a costly program of 
"pacification" and other "unconventional 
warfare" for Cambodia, as well as ways to 
get more money to implement it than 
? Congress is willing to authorize. 
According to the Times, the Joint 
Chiefs have devised a battle plan to out-

this report the Chiefs'offered four differ-
ent ways of generating?on the sly?the 
additional $52 million they want: 
The first way would be simply to transfer 
$5'2 minion from the economic aid program . 
to military spending, whtch can be done later

would be to use the economic aid fund for the 
purchase Of all "common use" items such as 
trucks and jeeps, which have military kIS well 
as civilian value, thus freeing other mili-
tary funds. 
A third way would be to Increase procure.., 
Mont for the United States Army by $52 mil-
lion and give the materiel to the Cambod-
ians, for "repayment" later. The fourth way 
would be to make some exceptions In De-
