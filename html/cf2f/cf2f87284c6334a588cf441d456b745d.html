DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Communist China: A communique issued by the Chinese 
Communist party central committee on 26 August discloses 
Peiping's decision to "readjust" significantly downward China's 
four main production targets for 1959�coal, steel, grain, and 
cotton. The Chinese admit gross "over-assessment" of agri-
cultural production in 1958�grain and cotton output claims are 
reduced drastically. The readjustment of targets represents 
a setback for the prestige of Mao Tse-tung and those of his 
lieutenants, including Liu Shao-chi, who had encouraged the 
most extravagant expectations of rapid economic development. 
The call by the leadership for further intensive effort on the 
economic front indicates that there is to be no relaxation of 
"leap forward" pressures on the masses. 
(Page 1) (Chart) 
USSR: Soviet naval forces have concluded the large-scale 
combined air/surface/submarine exercise in the Norwegian Sea 
which began 11-12 August. Four cruiser-destroyer groups and 
a large number of submarines�probably over forty--participated 
in one of the largest Soviet out-of-area exercises yet noted. Nu-
merous, BADGER jet medium bomber aircraft also took part, 
with a high of 13 sorties scheduled during one 24-hour period. 
Most of the participating units were from the Northern Fleet, 
but one group of surface ships and two submarines from the 
Baltic Fleet were involved. Exercises of this typed defense of 
the seaward approaches to the Murman coast, are usually con-
ducted twice a year. The I

agreement providing for the extension of a $35,000,000 long-
term Soviet credit. The official communique stated the credit 
will be used to purchase Soviet equipment for developing in-
dustry and agriculture and for building roads. Moscow can 
also be expected to attempt to exploit Guinea's need for tech-
nicians and specialists. Guinea has recently announced that 
it presently is drafting a national plan for economic develop-
ment which, while emphasizing agriculture, also calls for an 
expansion of industry. Until the conclusion of this agreement, 
bloc economic activity in Guinea, with the exception of a Czech 
arms gift,  had been limited to the development of closer trade 
relations. Page 3)

Watch Committee conclusion--Laos: Laotian Government 
forces have redeployed combat units in northern Laos in an at-
tempt to meet the threat posed by insurgent elements, but as 
yet no significant military actions have taken place. Dissident 
activity with probable North Vietnamese support and guidance 
continues in the northern and, to a lesser extent, in the central 
and north-central provinces. The North Vietnamese, by provid-
ing guidance and logistic assistance to the dissident elements in 
Laos, have the capability of intensifying operations through these 
elements, which, if they see government resistance weakening, 
may extend the scope of their military operations to include the 
greater portion, if not all, of the country.

Communist China Cuts Back 1959 Targets  
The communique issued on 26 August by the Chinese Com-
munist party, following its eighth plenary session at Lushan 
during the first two weeks in August, discloses Peiping's deci-
sion to "readjust" significantly downward China's four main 
production targets for 1959--coal, steel, grain, and cotton. 
The new grain and cotton targets are only half the original 
goals, and those for steel and coal are significantly reduced. 
The Chinese admit to gross "over-assessment" of their 
agricultural production in 1958. Exaggerated reports from 
statistical units, together with hasty harvesting and storage 
due to inadequate labor, resulted in verification of only 
250,000,000 tons of grain (375,000,000 tons had been claimed) 
and 2,100,000 tons of cotton (3,350,000 tons had been claimed). 
The back-yard steel program was in effect conceded to be un-
successful. Output by local furnaces is no longer to be included 
in the national plan, and local efforts toward that end are to be 
subordinated to other economic activities. 
The communique confirms earlier indications that the slo-
gans "great leap forward" and "leap forward" have been rede-
fined in much more modest terms. The Second Five-Year Plan 
targets proposed in 1956, previously set aside as too conserva-
tive, have been revived as realistic goals for 1959 which can be 
overfulfilled by sustained maximum effort. 
An accompanying resolution reaffirms that significant 
changes have taken place in the organization and operation of 
the communes during the months of "tidying up." It emphasizes, 
however, the superior qualities of the communes as an eco-
nomic organization. 
Chinese Communist leaders have not all been committed to 
the same degree to the original concept of the "great leap for-
ward." Those whose prestige has seemed most heavily committed

are Mao Tse-tung; Liu Shao-chi, the second-ranking leader; 
Teng Hsiao-ping, the party's secretary general; and Tan 
Chen-lin, the secretariat's specialist in agriculture. These 
men played the leading roles in exhorting the "leap" and in 
threatening those opposed to a headlong course. Party lead-
ers who had seemed to have reservations about the "leap" 
were senior administrators and economic specialists, pos-
sibly including Premier Chou En-lai. 
Mao appears still to dominate the party; the communiqu�
notes that the party plenum was held under Mao's "guidance," 
and it concludes by urging the party and people to unite under 
Mao's leadership. It is not yet clear whether Mao intends to 
fix any blame for the leap's shortfall on other party leaders 
rather than low-level cadres.

Soviet Economic Aid to Guinea  
Moscow, in a move designed to strengthen its relations 
with Conakry as well as to enhance the bloc's position in West 
Africa, concluded an economic aid agreement with Guinea on 
24 August. According to TASS, the Soviet $35,000,000 long-
term, low-interest credit is to cover the cost of economic and 
technical assistance to Guinea for constructing industrial enter-
prises, developing agriculture, and building roads. Moscow, 
in keeping with its economic aid policy in the underdeveloped 
areas, presumably will accept partial, if not complete, repay-
ment for its aid in the form of Guinean commodities. 
Guinea has recently announced that it is drafting a national 
plan for economic development which, while emphasizing agri-
culture, evidently also will provide for the expansion of its 
nascent industry. The aid agreement will provide Moscow 
with an opportunity to exploit GUinda's need for qualified tech-
nicians and specialists. The bloc, furthermore, may have of-
fered to guide Conakry in efforts to develop the industrial sector. 
The Soviet aid program was agreed upon during the good-will 
visit to the USSR of a Guinean government delegation which left 
for home after a stay of about ten days. Since Guinea achieved 
its independence last year, bloc economic activity--with the ex-
ception of a Czech arms gift this spring--has been essentially 
limited to attempts to develop trade relations. There are, how-
ever, at least 30 bloc specialists, mostly Czechs, providing 
technical assistance on public works projects being carried out 
by the Guinean Ministry of Interior. In addition, there are re-
portedly a few Czech officers working with the army.

India Adopts Hands-Off Policy on UN Consideration of Tibet 
C_Indian officials, in response to a request for guidarice  
from the Dalai Lama on an appeal to the UN, informed his 
advisers on 22 August that India would neither support nor 
interfere with any action on the Tibetan question in the UN. 
The Tibetans were told that New Delhi could not advise the 
Dalai Lama on the public appeal he plans to make soon, 
since it conflicts with India's recognition of Tibet as part of 
Communist China. The Indian officials also suggested that 
the Dalai Lama in future make his decisions independently 
and act in his own interest without seeking clearance from 
New Delhi. This position, which is in sharp contrast to the 
Indian Government's earlier desire to restrict the Dalai 
Lama's political activities, was explained as being necessary 
to protect Indian interests but was interpreted by the Tibet-
ans as tacit encouragement of their resort to UN acticrinq 
Ll_5;rime Minister Nehru also indicated to the American 
charg�n 20 August that he planned no definite move to op-
pose UN consideration of the Tibet issue, but he reiterated 
his view that UN discussion could not lead to any useful ac-
tion on the matter. Nehru, apparently disillusioned with 
Peiping, implied that his government would maintain a cor-
rect attitude toward the Chinese Communists at the interna-
tional level, but would be less cooperative toward them than 
in the pasq 
ajespite Nehru's unwillingness to support the Tibetans in 
the UN, the Dalai Lama has been invited to make an official 
visit to New Delhi and has been given travel clearance for 
several Tibetan delegations to travel abroad for publicity 
purposes. From 28 to 31 August, the Dalai Lama's brother 
and chief adviser will visit Manila, where he probably will 
explore the possibility of Philippine sponsorship of a request 
for UN discussion of Tibet. Talks with officials of South Viet-
nam, Nationalist China, and Australia are also planned. There 
is a possibility that some Latin American country may be will-
ing to initiate such a  request and to organize support among 
other UN members.]

III. THE WEST 
Influential West Germans Urging Adenauer to Improve 
Relations With Warsaw 
&est Germany's leading publisher, Axel Springer, is 
urging Chancellor Adenauer to make some dramatic ges-
ture of friendship toward Warsaw on 1 September, the 20th 
anniversary of the German invasion of Poland. Springer's 
idea is that a declaration of German-Polish friendship could 
ease the way toward establishment of diplomatic relations. 
Poland has recently been irritated by German plans to in-
clude prominent refugee leaders in the German delegation 
to the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in WarsaW.J 
(Vice Chancellor Erhard, Bundestag President Gersten-
maier, and Minister for All-German Affairs Lemmer are 
reported to support Springer's efforts. Foreign Minister 
Brentano and Press Chief von Echardt have also backed 
such a move in discussions with Adenauerj 
be chancellor reportedly has promised Springer to 
deal with Polish-German relations in a speech about 1 Sep-
tember, but he will probably not go beyond a declaration of 
friendship and a promise not to use force in settling the 
boundary question. While Adenauer agrees some under-
standing must be reached with the Poles, he does not intend 
to take steps toward formalizing relations until after the 
1961 elections. Pe fears that establishment of diplomatic 
relations, implying renunciation of the German eastern 
territories as the Poles demand, would alienate 6,000,000 
refugee and expellee voters. During the Geneva conference, 
refugee leaders in the Christian Democratic Union were in-
strumental in killing Foreign Minister Brentano's proposal  
for a German-Polish nonaggression pactV

Of French Community  
De Gaulle plans to propose soon that Algeria become a mem-
ber of the French Community, according to remarks made by 
Deputy Premier Jacques Soustelle on 18 August to an Algerian 
who formerly served as secretary of state for Algerian affairs 
in the French cabinet. During his visit to Algeria, the French 
President is expected to sound out key French Army elements, 
whom he has previously felt it necessary to reassure as to his  
intentions, 
 if the FLN has not ac-
cepted De Gaulle's standing offer to negotiate a cease-fire be-
fore the French Community executive council meets on 10 Sep-
tember, De Gaulle will ask the council to propose that Algeria 
become a membei, 
Several previous suggestions that an Algerian solution be 
sou within the Community framework have been made by 
various French officials and other political leaders. De Gaulle, 
in his early public discussions concerning the Community, re--
served a "choice place" for Algeria. The conflicting demands 
of the key elements involved in the Algerian problem indicate, 
however, that a satisfactory "Community solution" will be dif-
ficult to achieve without considerable "give" on all sidesV 
ake French Army and nationalists in France adamantly op-
pose any form of Algerian independence. The European settlers 
in Algeria hope to maintain their privileges by total integration 
of Algeria with France. FLN leaders have recently indicated 
some opposition to Community membership and probably would 
not accept it without at least some recognition of their right to 
independence. A further complication stems from disagree-
ments among the African members of the Community over the  
extent of their association with Fran.s.F)
