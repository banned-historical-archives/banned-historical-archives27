 The campaign to send etlucateo youths to lie rural areas has been intensified
 this year after a sharp cutback in 1972, A provincial official announced In March
 that "one or two nfillion" yours ; rrti plc will be rusticated, compared with four
 hundred thousand last year.                                                     25X1
 a central directive issued last December, which
 reportedly suspended the recruitment of new factory workers. If this is correct,
 young people already in the countryside who had hoped for reassignment to urban
 factories and middle school graduates who now have no other employment pros-
 pects would swell the number of young people assigned to rural areas.
 Some letters claim that the freeze on factory hiring is for three years, i.e., the
 remainder of the current five-year plan (1971.75). The current plan may have been
 revised to put even greater emphasis on agriculture inn the wake of lust year's
 disappointing harvest. In any case, the increased down-to-the-countryside program
 probably stems in part from economic considerations and may be an attempt to
 boost agricultural output by providing extra manpower for projects such as water
 conservancy.
 Rustication of educated youth has had deep political as well as economic roots.
 It Is consistent with Mao's long-standing belief that life ,nd work among the peasants
 creates a healthy political attitude. Since the Cultural Revolution, rustication has
 been used as much to indoctrinate and disciplh' a youth as to provide assistance for
 rural areas.
 The controversy among the top leadership stirred up by the renewed program
 seems to be linked to the still unresolved Lin Piao affair. In December, Lin was
 attacked for the first time as an "ultra-rightist," on grounds that he allegedly
 opposed ntsttration and other policies in vogue during and immediately after the
 Cultural Revolution. Also in Decenmber, the media began to tout "new things"-
 rustication and other Cultural Revolution programs-in a leftist-ins ired campaign to
 preserve at least some aspects of the Cultural Revolution.                        25X1

 ilroadenhi Contacts with US Oil 1 irms
 Peking is developing a broad range of contacts Willi US oil firths and compatlicx
 supplying services and equipment to the oil industry. The following received invita-
 tions to the Canton trade fair that opened on I5 April:
 .-at least four oil companies- ('ontincntal Oil,1:sso, Mobil, and Caltex,
 -US Stcr,l, reportedly beca'-sc of Chinese interest in its oil-well supply
 division, which markets complete oil rigs for on-shore -al off-shore use;
 -Baker Oil Tools, t- firm that specialize% in tubular steel for drilling
 equipment.
 In addition:
 -a delegation from a Canadian subsidiary of Ures-:?r Industries. a US firm
 that produces petroleum exploration equipment, k now in China;
 a major US firm en,,aged in engineering and design of refining processes
 will send a delegation to China in May,
 -representatives of Standard oil of Ohio (SO11lO) reportedly have al-
 ready visited China in connection with the approved sale by a Japanese
 company of a petrochemical plant using SOHIO processes;
 --China reportedly has requested several US oil equipment firms to quote
 prices on marine systems, drilling equipment, and a floating drilling
 platform.
 All of the known contacts appear directed toward ;.cquiring US equipment and
 technology, with emphasis on off-shore exploration anal petrochemical refining
 processes. The inclusion of four oil-producing companies also    vi des an oppor-
 tunity for the development of trade in oil or chemicals.                      5X1

 More l r:ii sfcrs In the Provinces
 Since the Lin 1'iau.) affair in September 1971, a number of tnp?r:utking military
 officials in the provinces have beets purged or have simply dropped from public view.
 Now, steps are being taken to fill the void, 1'ckir,g apparently feels that in the
 interest of over-all stability each province should have a clearly designated head,
 even If that person Is only the "principal responsible person," The s-tuation in the
 provinces contrasts with that in Peking, where the important party and army posts
 held by Lin and several other central military leaders purged along with him remain
 vacant.
 The new lincitp in the fractious province of Kwcichow was revealed on 16
 April. The "principal responsible person" there is U Jui?lin, an army veteran from
 neighboring Yunnan. Lu is the third military chief' to be transferred to Kwcichow
 since the start of the Cultural Revolution                                  .,
 In Ituna n the new man?on-the scene is party veteran Chang PIng?hua. ('11,111

 These latest lateral transfers follow a pattern that has been in evidence since the
 start of the Cultural Revolution. After Icade,'s have been purged in one province.
 Peking has usually moved in new leaders from outside (oo;asionally they were
 brought up from within the local hierarchy). Before Lin's demise in 1971, these
 lateral moves almost invariably involved military professionals. Of late, however,
 some vctctan civilian officials, like Chan' Ping-hua, are being used as trouble
 shooters, presumably assigned the ntissi,   if restoring order and harmony and
 ensuring compliance with orders from Jie center. Tit: use of these civilian officials is
 in keeping with Peking's avowed intention of gradually restoring the balance
 between civilian and military authority in China.
 Many of China's provincial elite. whether military or civilian, are still being
 asked to implement what often appear to be conflicting directives from Peking.
 Moreover, they are sometimes pl. ced in tight spots. For example, Chang Ping?hua
 will not only have to mend fences with local military leaders, who will regard his
 appointment as an effort to dilute their authority, but also with leftist forces in the
 province who were instrumental in ousting him and his supporters in the first place,
 Chang's authority is circumscribed by the fact that Hunan's nominal first secretary.

 Moderate reactions to ctmteniious Issues cmpiiayize Peking's strong interest in
 normalizing relations with former adversaries and In tlel'using Indochina as a con trot-
 ling Issue In Asian affairs,
 China's interest in maintaining movement toward Sino?Indian rapprochement
 was clearly deni-tinstratetl by Its mild reaction to India's intervention In Sikkim.
 Chinese press reports have been sparse and without an authoritative stamp. The press
 has criticized India's Intervention and New Delhi's "unequal" treaty with Sikkim;
 there has been no reference to Chinese interests. despite Peking's sensitivity to
 developments on its Illmalayan frontier.
 In Soutbeast Asia, China has Ignored Thailand's involvement in Laos :is the
 pace of Sino-Thai normalization has quickened. An authoritative commentary in
 People's Daily said nothing of Thai involvement, leaving it to a China-based Thai
 insurgent radio to support an earlier Lao Communist complaint about Bangkok's
 role. Peking has been influenced by knoarfcdge that the Thai fbrcign office is
 considering trade ties with China and adjustments in Bangkok's relations with
 Taipei.
 Nowhere has Peking's turn toward in dcration been more evident that in its
 treatment of Indochina. Since President Nixon's China trip, Peking's statements have
 been less biting in tone and more sparing of US actions and motives in Indochina
 than commentary from the Indochinese Communists. Peking's latest statements
 appear even more shaded on the side of moderation and flexibility than high-level
 Chinese commentary a few weeks ago. APeople's Daily- editorial on 25 April used a
 softer formulation than in the past in expressing Peking's terms for a Cambodian
 settienient, Several  times recently authoritative Chinese commentaries have
 addressed the question of "foreign" involvement in Laos and Cambodia in a way

 a
 China's appearance at the I.'CAI-'li meeting In Tokyo gave Peking an oppor-
 tunity to advance the interests of the smaller Asian Communist regimes and to
 expound on population policy, economic self-reliance, cooperatlon, and aid, The
 Chinese generally stayed in the background, keeping an eye on their own policy
 needs as well as on issues appealing to the Third World,
 In his opening statement, China's chief delegate An Chili-yuan claimed that
 Prince Sihanouk's exile regime, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South
 Vietnam, and North Korea ought to be in ECAFE. In the early days of the session,
 the Chinese delegate emphasized the point by walking out during speeches by
 Cambodian, South Korean, and South Vietnamese representatives, but later the
 Chinese dropped the dramatics and remained at the meetings.
 The Chinese statement on birth control, it sensitive subject in Peking, i'lustrated
 the difficulty of reconciling the hard realities of population pressure with Marxist
 theory that the masses are the motive force of history and economic development,
 The Chinese, conceding that some problems may arise as the population increases,
 described China's policy as "population increase in a planned way." They also
 indicated that they were willing to learn from the experiences of other nations. (For

 Gclcevernca In Pekin
 Mexican PresiO:nt i?cheverria's five-day visit to China ended 24 April on a high
 note. '1'hc Mexican leader received a promise that Peking would sign Protocol II of
 the Treaty of" I'Iatelolco banning nuclear weapons from Latin America.'rhe Chinese
 used the visit to polish their image as a champion of third World Interests.
 'I'lic decision to sign the protocol was in line with Chinese assurances to Mexico
 last Pali that Peking would not introduce nuclear weapons into Latin America, The
 Chinese made it clear, however, that they were still opposed to passages in the
 protocol that endorse the nwiear non-proliferation and partial test-ban treaties, By
 agreeing to sign, the Chinese not only pleased Echeverria, but stole a propaganda
 march on the USSR, now the only nuclear power that has not subscribed or
 promised to subscribe to the agreement.
 The two sides signed a $40 million trade agreement that will run for a year. The
 Chinese endorsed President 13cheverria's concept or a charter of economic rights and
 duties of' states and reiterated their support for a 200-mile limit for maritime
 ^:onomic rights. As dressing on the cake, the two countries agreed to undertake
 cultural, scientific, and technical exchanges during 1973-74.
 The Chinese followed their standard routine for high level guests in entertaining
 Echeverria-a gala welcome, a meeting with Mao and talks with Chou, and a short
 tour of other parts of the country. Public comments imply that both sides attach
 considerable symbolic importance to this visit, the first to China by a Latin
 American chief of state. The Chinese and their guest played heavily on Third World
 themes--the encouragement of economic nationalism and opposition tosu,,erpower
 hegemony and spheres of interest, but neither the US nor the USSR was specifically
 attacked. The Chinese doubtless hope that Echeverria's visit will live new impetus to
 their lagging campaign to expand relations with Latin America.

 C'hina's Researchers Reorganized
 ('Itina's science and technology organizations underwent a major shakeup
 during the Cultural Revolution at all levels and in bode the civil and military science
 structure. Scientific organizations were reduced in size, merged, or abolished. The
 objective, if there was one, was to put national research under provincial and
 municipal administration so that the needs of local industry could be served more
 effectively. The changes emphasized the importance of applied research and the
 integration of resc.arclt with industrial production. The result was excessive decen-
 tralization, dc-emphasis of basic research, and an erosion of professionalism in the
 administration of scientific activity.
 To correct these imbalances, readjustments are slowly being made, The State
 Scientific and Technological Committee of the State Council was abolished and
 replaced in part by the Science and Education Group, which was first noted its May
 1971. The committee's functions were distributed among this new "group," the
 Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the National Defense Science and Technology
 C'ommitte,e. The "group" may be an interim organization, but it is now responsible
 for civilian research and development planning, relations with foreign scientific
 communities, and sctentilie and technical education.
 A related development was the reappearance, after a long eclipse, of the State
 Science and Technology Association. Before the Cultural Revolution, the association
 was an influential advisory organization concerned with coordinating scientific and
 technological activities and promulgating scientific knowledge, but it is now mainly
 a front organization for foreign scientific contacts. The Chinese have equated the
 association with the US Committee on Scholarly Communication with the Peoples
 Republic of'China--a non-government body active in promoting better relations with
 China. The association's sponsorship of conferences and journals has not resumed,
 but technical societies and scientific publications are slowly reappearing.
 The Chinese Academy of Sciences has undergone major changes. Only a dozen
 of the mo,'e basic institutes, such as the Institutes of Physics and Mathematics, are
 administered by the academy from the center. Many applied research institutes have
 been placed under the direct control of provincial or municipal science and tech-
 nology bureaus. The academy still has some control over the plans and resources of
 these institutes, even though some of them have been placed entirely under the
 Ministry of National Defense and other ministries. The Academy of Medic . Sci-
 ences, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and numerous other industrial research
 academics have been similarly reorganized.
 Major organizational changes affecting science have apparently taken place
 within the Ministry of National Defens too, but the nature of these changes is not
 clear. The National Defense Science and Technology Committee appears to be intact

 more direct military control.
 The problems involved In finding it p-oper balance between basic and applied
 research have not been folly resolved, While there has been it reallocation of
 resources between military and civilian research, the extent is not known, In some
 respects, the mechanisms for exchanging scientific and technical information have
 been nffcctcd adversely, but in general the redirection of the efforts of many
 scientists and technicians toward amilied   ?s?        led to technical advances in
 Chinn's industries.

 I.radershlp Notes
 Since his tehabiliNI tfoil on 12 April, former party secretary-general 'l cnr!
 Ilsfao-ping has been fairly active not as active as China's busiest vice-premier, Li
 Iisie--?nic.n, but certainly inure `o than the three other telunbilitated vice-premiers.
 Ile was on his own on 20 April when lie escorted Mexican President FF,ehcvcrria to a
 commune outside l'eking, but his other appearances have been at the side of LI
 Ilsicn-111e11. 'feng's rehabilitation is reported to be the subject or study sessions
 suggesting that the      '.ip is trying to explain its Implications, Some Chinese
 officials in Hong Kong   .aid to view the rehabilitation as encouragement to other
 disgraced cadres, but an article In Red Flag was less reassuring, It offered veteran
 cadre-: official forgiveness, but made no reference to their returning to active duty.
 This may Indicate that sonic leaden oppose 't'ang's new role,
 Also in the limelight of late has been Clnon Fn-tai's wife, Teng Ying-chiao. She
 has been elevated in official 1`stings to a group of leaders just below Politburo level,
 and has made several public appearances. Her recent visibility may be the result of
 her prominent rule in the Women's Frrlcration. a mass organization being rebuilt at
 the lower levels. The organization has yet to be officially rc-established at the
 national level, but Teng, one of its vice-chairmmen, was Identified in this post a year
 ago. She and Mao's wife. Chiang Ching, arc China's most prominent women, but the
 two rarely appear together. Mme. Mao has not been seen since 12 March.
 On 21 April, Shanghai's thl:d-ranking party leader, Wang Hung-wen, was named
 head of the Shanghai branch of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, another
 mass organization in the process of being rebuilt. Weng is sometimes in Shanghai and
 sometimes i,, Peking, where he heads the list of central leaders just below the
 Politburo, his new Shanghai post may be a clue to his role at the center; it is
 possible that Wang is a leader of the national trade union organixasion.
 Wang Hai-jung, who is alleged to be Mao's niece, may have missed out on a
 promotion. As a deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol Department, she
 could move into the directorship now that the former director has been reassigned
 to the Liaison Office in Washington. The new US team in Peking has rioted.
 however, that another deputy director is the "acting" protocol chief. Because of her
 rumored tics to Mao, many have interpreted Wang's role in the leadership as stand-in
 for the chairman. In fact, it was Wang who escorted Teng Hsiao-ping at his coming
 out on the 12th, a move interpreted by some as a sin that  ? o Personally

 Ill late 1972 and early 1973, the ('hinese launched a drive of unprrcedenicd
 scope to import scientific knowledge and advanced industrial technology from Japan
 and the West. In the first four mont!is of 1973, the Chinless purchased almost S3()0
 million in whole pctrtic'hcntical plants front Japan. West t'.uruhc, and the United
 States. Chinese purchases of plants and technology will total over S i billion if all
 deals currently tinder discussion are completed,
 The largest sum put into whole-plant purchases from Japan at'd the Wcst In any
 previous year was S9S million In I90. China first bought entire plants from the
 non-('ontnttrnist worid in 11963. and it increased such purchases yearly until 1965.
 The importation of Western technology came under strong attack during the
 Cultural Revo otion. however, and purchases fell to S3  million In 196(,. Very few
 plants were purchased between 1967 and January 1973,
 This year's large increase in plant purchases has been facilitated by China's
 willingness to finance many of them through five-year credits, A further increase in
 plant purchases in future years might require the use of longer term financing, and
 European businessmen in Peking have said the Chincsc have expressed a willingness
 to accept ten-year terms. While it has accepted five-year credits both before and
 since the Cultural Revolution, China has. never accepted a ten-year loan from a
 non4"onununist country.
