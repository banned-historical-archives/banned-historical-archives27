 Alignments Among Chinese Communist Leaders
 This study is a working paper.  Attempting briefly to
 explain the functions of the principal organs of the Chinese
 Communist Party and government, it offers some preliminary
 conjectures as to alignments among the Chinese Communist
 leaders who occupy the key positions in those bodies.  The
 study considers centers of power apart from Mao Tse-tung,
 and discusses alignments in terms of four hypothetical
 groups:   an "organizational" group around Liu Shao-chi, an
 "administrative" group around Chou En-tai, a "military" group
 around Peng Te-huai, and a "police" group of party police
 and public security figures.   (The last page of the study
 is a graphic presentation of the discussion in these terms).
 The views expressed herein are tentative, and the study may
 be useful only as an indication of the intelligence gaps
 which must be filled before any such analysis can be firmly
 founded.
 This study, reflecting information received through 7
 June 1957,  includes material from the Department   f State
 (BI OLI   OIR
 from O/RR and other components of CIA.

 ALIGN'di:NTS A`dONG CIIINESE CO11'MIJNTST LEADERS
 C.,)ncept of Alignments ...............................Par.  1-3
 The concept of alignments refers to associations among
 Chinese Communist leaders which have been sufficiently close
 a?r.d lasting to suggest that a given individual is  a  friend,
 a patron or a protege of another individual.   Personal rela-
 tionships have long been important in Chinese politics,                            and
 probably still are.   There is enough material at hand on the
 careers of Chinese Communist leaders to support some prelimi-
 nary speculation as to current alignments.
 Mao's Predominance ..................................Par.  4-5
 Mao Tse-tung clearly continues predominant in the Chinese
 Communist Party,  due to his prestige,  his positions,  and the
 presence in top party and government posts of more of his
 proteges than of any other party leader.   Mao's four top
 1i.eutenants are Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai  (both proteges
 of Ma.o),  Chen'. Yun  (apparently a Mao-Chou protege),  and Teng
 llsia.o-ping  (apparently a Mao-Liu protege).   These five per-
 sons--plus a sixth nominal leader--make up the CCP polit-
 buro's standing committee,  the core of party power.   Of the
 other 18 members of the politburo,  which displays a variety
 of talents,    11 seem wholly or in large part proteges of
 Mao.
 Liu and Chou ........................................Par. 6-8
 Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai seem to qualify as centers
 of  power in addition to Mao,  and they may already be some-
 what in competition with each other.   Liu's position appears
 to be the stronger, for several reasons.   Two other polit-
 buro members,  Teng Hsiao-ping and  Peng Chen,  can be tenta-
 tively aligned with Liu; these three may be the core of an
 "organizational" group drawing its strength from the party
 structure.    Four politburo members, only one of whom (Chen
 Yun) seems as important as either Teng or Peng,  can be tenta-
 tively aligned with Chou;   these     five   may be the core of
 an "administrative" group with strength primarily in the
 government,

 O ilor Conl:e.rs o f Power ..................... :........ Par.  9-12
 Chen 'Yun may conceivably lie the con tar of an "economists"
 including politburo members Li Fu-chun,  Po 1--po,     arid
 Li fl .yen-nien.   For the  time being,  however, Chen and Li  Fu-
 chun are considered  as  followers of Chou En-l.al,  and Po and
 Li  I lien-nien are not aligned with anyone.   A third center  of
 power-?-?in addition  to Liu and Chou--appears to be Pang To-
 the dominant                              figure in a "military" group.   Tentatively
 re;rarded as  a  fourth center is an unidentified leader,  pos-
 sibly politburo member Kang Sheng,  of a "police" group com-
 p:rised of party police and public security figures.   Four
 ether politburo members--Lo Jung-huan,  long concerned with
 oolit:Leal control of the military, Ulanfu, boss of Inner
 Mongolia, and propagandists Lu Ting-i and Chan Po-ta.--would
 perhaps be major assets to any group contending for power,
 and cannot be aligned with any group.
 The Party Secretariat .............................Par.  13-15
 Live Shao-chi and Tong Hsiao-ping of the politburo's
 standing committee probably have the largest roles in direct-
 ing  the very important work of the party secretariat,  which
 among other things directs and co-ordinates the work of the
 party's central departments and committees.   Teng Hsiao-ping
 and Peng Chen are the two ranking members of the secretariat,
 thus making a formidable combination of the three key figures
 of the conjectured "organizational" group.   Three other mem-
 bers of the secretariat are aligned with the "organizational"
 group,  one with Chou's "administrative" group,  and  on.  with
 Peng Te?-huai's  "military" group,  while three are not aligned.
 The Party's Central Departments and Committees.... Par.    16-24
 The central control commission is probably of little
 importance. The organization department,  perhaps still very
 important,  is believed to be directed by one or more members
 of the "organizational" group.   The social affairs  (party
 police) department,  perhaps still of equal importance,  is
 presumed to be directed by members of the "police" group.
 The important departments of propaganda and rural work are
 dominated by leaders who cannot be aligned with anyone ex-
 cept Mao.   The director's of the industrial work department
 cannot be aligned with anyone.   Most of the directors of
 the united front work department are aligned with Chou En-
 lai.                 Most of the central commit tees, in general of less im-
 portance than the departments, are directed by persons not
 yet identified.   The current posts of several party leaders
 have not been identified.

 'Col)   Offices   of the Government ..................... Par. 25-31
 Mao Tsu?-tung': office of chairman of the regime is one
 of much prestige but  little p99wer.   The NPC standing com-
 mittee is potentially an important body,  but has not seemed
 so to date.   The principal organ of   the government has
 clearly been Chou En-lai's State Council.   While Chou has
 probably not decided unilaterally upon his v:' ce premiers,
 three of the nine important figures of this "inner cabinet"--
 Chen Yun,  Li Fu--shun and Chen I--,4re regarded as Chou's fol-
 lowers.   Only one,  Ter; IIsi-,i.o-ping,                      is aligned with the "or-
 ganizational" group, and only one,  Peng Tc-huai, with the
 "military" group. Four-??-Li Hsien-nier-, Po I--po, Teng Tzu-
 hui and Ulanfu? -are not aligned.   Of the three less important
 vice premiers, one is aligned with Chou and two are not
 aligned.
 Staff Offices and Subordinate Ministries .......... Par.  32-40
 The State Council's eight staff offices direct the work
 of 40 of the 42 ministries.   Lo Jul.-thing's first staff   of-
 fice (security and related matters) and its important Minis-
 try of Public Security are dominated by possible members of
 a "police" group.   Lin Feng, director of the second staff
 office  (education and culture),  may be with the "organiza-
 tional" group.   Po I-po's third staff office (heavy industry),
 Chia To-fu's fourth staff office  (labor and light industry),
 Li Hsien-nien's fifth staff office  (fin,ance,  currency and
 trade), Wang Shou-tao's sixth staff office (transport and
 communications), and Teng Tzu-hui's seventh staff office
 (agriculture and conservation) a:e all headed by persons who
 cannot be aligned with any of the conjectured groups.   The
 same is true of most of the 30 or more economic ministries
 subordinate to those five staff offices, although six of
 the ministers are aligned with the "organizational" group
 and two with the "military" group.   (Many of the directors
 of those five staff offices and their friends and proteges
 in the subordinate ministries could plausibly be aligned
 with an "economists" group not now regarded as being as im-
 portant as the other conjectured groups discussed herein).
 Li Wei-han's eighth staff office (miscellaneous affairs) is
 :iominated by possible followers of Chcu En-lai;  one of the
 two commissions with which it may be concerned is headed by
 "organizational" figures, and the other by unaligned persons.
 The Major Commissions ................................Par. 41
 The four economic commissions and the one scientific
 commission subordinate to the State Council appear to be

 Knpocial-purpose bodies which out across  tho lines of responsi-
 bility and the functions                    c.f the stall offi.ce:es.   Thos state  N
 planning commission  (i;)ng -.i range planning) is headed by Li Fu-
 chun,  aligned with Chou En.-_;ai,  although two of                    Li's deputies
 may belong with the "organizational" group.   The national
 economic commission  (annual planning) is headed by the un-
 al igneci Po .I-po,  whose denu lies likewise cannot be aligned
 (except two with Po himself). '  The national 'technological com-
 mission          (technological development) is headed by a possible
 protege of Po.   The nationa   cornstr-uction commission  (co-ordi-
 nation of construction) is headed by persons who cannot be
 aligned.   The scientific planning commission is headed (per-
 haps nominally) by a probable friend of Chou's.
 The Ministry of Foreign Af~?airs ......................Par.  42
 The Ministry of Foreign Aff:a:iz,s, subordinate directly
 to the State Council, seems to be Chou's own show.   He him-
 self is the minister and all of his deputies appear to be
 his followers and proteges.
 The Ministry of National Defense ..................Par.   43-48
 The Ministry of National Defe;~se is the only other minis-
 try not subordinate to any stiff office.   Peng Te-huai as
 minister is believed to have authority over all of the mili-
 tary activities, including operations, of all arms of the
 service.   Peng's hand shows more clearly than that of any
 other party leader in appointments  '1_1-0  top posts in the mili-
 tary establishment.     Of  the seven or eight deputy ministers,
 three or tour have ba:n closely associated with Peng.  Al-
 though the chief of staff,  Su 'itu,  cannot be aligned with
 Peng,  four of Su's six deputies have seemed close to Peng.
 One deputy C/S, not primarily a military man, appears to be-
 long with the "police" group.   At least one of the directors
 of the armed forces' central departments may be a protege
 of Peng, while another may be a "police" figure.   At least
 two of the armed forces' headquarters are commanded by
 peisons who have seemed close to Peng, whereas one is com-
 manded by a person aligned with the "administrative" group
 and another by a possible "police" figure.   The current
 posts of many onetime military leaders are not known.

 1.          The concept of a.li~;.me:nts, as used in this paper,  refers
 to associations between Chinese Communist leaders which have
 been sufficiently close and lasting  to  suggest that a given
 individual is a personal   friend, ,a patron,,  or a protege or
 follower, of another individual.     This concert is not so
 sharp as that of factionalism, which implies a disciplined
 striving toward persona  or po'lit.i.ca. objectives in  con-
 scious opposition to other groups or to the party as a
 whole.   Alignments reflect an earlier stage of development
 than factionalism.
 2.          There is disagreement not only about the existing patterns
 of alignments among Chinese Communist leaders,  but even as
 to whether it is worth while to attempt to discover such pat-
 terns in the Chinese or any other Communist party.   Some ob-
 servers believe that alignments are of little or no importance,
 as they change too rapidly in practice.   While this view can-
 not be dismissed,  it appears to derive from observation pri-
 marily of the Soviet party.   This paper proceeds from the
 contrary view that the evolution of the CCP under Mao has
 permitted the development of stable associations much more
 than did the evolution of the CPSU under Stalin.  Moreover,
 personal relations have been a powerful factor in Chinese
 politics throughout history, and the Communists, while prob-
 ably reducing the strength of this factor, do not appear to
 have eliminated it.   No doubt alignments change over the
 years; for this reason if no other it has been impossible to
 accept in their entirety the views--as to alignments--of Chang
 Kuo-tao, the  onetime member of the CCP politburo who left
 the party in 1938; even if Chang  were entirely right as of
 1938, it is not credible that the patterns would persist un-
 changed until 1953.   It may be that some :alignments change
 more or less rapidly in the course of policy disputes; for
 example, Teng Tzu-hui, director of the party's rural work
 department, seems to have been treated shabbily by Mao Tse-
 tung during and since the 1955 dispute on the speed of
 agricultural. socialization, and Teng's allegiance may now
 lie elsewhere.   There is also the possibility of very rapid
 changes in allegiances, at an advanced phase of any contest
 for the succession, in a general rush to join the winning
 side; but such a stage of development--.that of simple oppor-
 tunism, or struggle for survival--is later than that with
 which this paper is concerned.   This preliminary inquiry is
 interested in those alignments which may develop into fac-
 tionalism in any maneuvering for the succession, and which
 thus may be of considerable importance in determining which
 is the winning side.

 3.    The tentat l.ve viows on alit;raments rxoress d In this
 paper are based on sever.a'l, consideration;;. Of some impor-
 tance are an individual's early associ:Ltion;,  the persons
 with whom he grow up,  with whom he studied,  xn  China  or
 abroad,  and with whom he worked  Ln  the o:a ly  years of the
 Chinese Communist movement.   Of greater  importance, in most
 cases, would seem 'to be tha record o.C his n:trty, military and
 government posts,  where that record offers some clue as his
 patrons and proteges.   Of eiu:).l importance are his writings,
 his reported speeches and conversa'tiens,  and    (in some fortu-
 nate instances) his observed behavior.                          Conjectures so   de-
 rived may of course be mistaken in any given                             instance, even
 where the record is substantial.   1-4oreover,  the conjectures
 offered in this pager have been made before receipt of de-
 tailed biographies of several hundred key figures in the
 CCP, material which will certainly illuminate this area and
 compel changes in these conjectures.
 4.    Mao Tse-tung clearly continues p:redominant in the Chi-
 nose  Communist Party,  due to his presti ge,  his positions,  and
 the p.rese7-ce in the top party and government posts of more of
 his protcg,~; than is the case with any other party leader.
 Mao himself is chairman of the central  committee and of its
 politburo, and is the sen.io.r.' member of the stand-
 ing committee, which has no o'fi.cers and is apparently to
 constitute the center of a "collective leadership" when Mao
 leaves the scene.   At  the CCP's eighth congress last September,
 the central committee and politburo were given four vice chair-
 man:                  Liu Shaft-chi,  Chou En-lai, Chu Te and Chen Yun--four
 longtime  lieutenants of Mao who in re;~ent years have been de-
 scribed as Mao's  "close comzr,a.des-in-.arms" and consistently
 ranked in that order.   Ma.o,  those four,,  and fast-rising Teng
 Hsiao-ping, secretary general  of  the central  committee,  be-
 came                  the politburo's standing commi .tee,  which seems the core
 of party power by virtue of    its  authority to act for the
 politburo between its meetings.    Of' these five lieutenants,
 the old military leader Chu To ha.s long seemed unimportant,'
 useful to the party only as  a figurehead chairman of the gov-
 ernment if Mao predeceases him or steps down.    The  other four
 seem genuinely the' .fvixr 1;op leader- of the party, after Mao.
 Of these four,,  Liu and Chou have ciearly been  ' proteges of
 ~dao,  owing their rise  no_'e to Ma.?o than to :.Leone else;  Chen
 Yun seems to have been brought along by both     Mao and Chou,  and
 Teng Hsiao-ping seems to have been a protege of both Mao and
 Liu.                                                      ..

 "all  the work of the party,,, most importantly,  that of formu-
 lating basic policies for the party and regime and of making
 appointments to key posts in the party and regime.   It seems
 improbable that  the politburo's role is simply that of en-
 dorsing decisions already made by the standing committee;
 Mao appears to have assembled a variety of genuine talents
 (in addition to rewarding some old comrades),  with a view to
 genuine discussions of policy.   On the other hand, due to
 Mao's prescige and the domination of the politburo by his
 proteges,  it seems highly probable that Mao's will on major
 matters finally prevails.  Mao as the leader--still a
 considerable distance from his lieutenants--presides over:
 Liu bhao-chi  (his favorite lieutenant), Teng Tysiao-ping and
 Peng Chen,  a trio believed to be concerned primarily with
 party affairs; Chou En-lai and Chen run,  concerned primarily
 with government work as premier and senior vice premier;
 Chou again and alternate (nonvoting) member Chang Wen-tien,
 responsible for foreign affairs as minister and senior
 deputy; Chen Yun again, Li Fu-churl,  Li Hsien-nien, and al-
 ternate member Po I-po, the four leading figures in economic
 affairs; Peng Te-huai,  the regime's top-ranking active mili?-
 tai   leader; Chu Te, once commander of the armed forces, and
 Lin Piao,  Chen I,  Liu Po-cheng and Ho Lung,  the other four
 (besides Peng Te...huai) of the five principal field commanders
 of the old days, who probably advise on military matters;
 Lo Jung-huan, possibly still'responsible in part for politi-
 cal controlof.the military; Tung Pi-wu, concerned with super-
 visory and disciplinary questions; alternate members Lu Ting-i
 and Cx,en Po-ta, concerned with propaganda and theory; alter-
 nate member Ulanfu, boss of Inner Mongolia and a spokesman
 for minority nationalities' affairs; alternate member Kang
 Sheng, possibly responsible in part for the party's secret
 police; and Lin Po-chu, oldest of the party elders.   Six of
 these persons seem to be of much less importance than the
 others:  Chu Te, Lin Po-chu and Tung Pi-wu (all past 70);
 Lire Piao, once Mao's favorite military leader, but who has
 been very sick for years and is apparently confined to an
 East China sanitarium most of the time;  and Liu Po-cheng and
 Ho Lung, no longer active as military leaders and apparently
 playing small roles in the party and government.  Of these
 22 members and alternate members of the politburo (in addi-
 tion to Mao), 15 seem to be wholly or in large part proteges
 of Mao:   the top five members after Mao---Liu,  Chou,  Chu Te,
 Chen Yun and Teng Bsiao-ping--bath Lins,  both Pengs, the
 other two Chens,  Tung,  Lo,  Lu,  and Kang.   No doubt Mao's ap-
 proval was required for the membership of the other seven
 leaders who cannot readily be aligned with Mao.

 ~.          Mao's predominance being eviden-c,  there is the more  in-
 teresting; question of actual or poten'.iai centers of power
 apart from P,iao,  and oi' primary or secondary allegiance  (after
 ;.Iao) to such persons by other party leaders,  a question which
 might prove of groat  importance  if  Ma..) were no longer holding
 the top leadership  cor;ather.   The two leaders who seem to
 most observers
 pr:inclpally to qualify are Liu Shao-chi and
 Chou En-lai.   They appear to be the persons of greatest
 stature after Mao in the Chinese Communist movement,  -to have
 played and to play still   the loading roles in operating the
 party (Liu) aril  the government (Chou), and to be the most
 likely to have acquired strong personal followings in their
 many years as Mao's top two lieutenants.   There is nogood evi-
 dence to support rumor's that their relations are unfriendly.
 However, they do seem to be different and possibly uncongenial
 types;  there have been fragmentary indications that their
 roles, while generally complementary, have in part conflicted;
 and there has been  a  somewhat difierent emphasis in their
 pronouncements on certain questions of policy which perhaps
 cannot be attributed simply to their differing roles.   Liu's
 positior appears to be stronger than Chou's.   Liu has been
 the party's second-ranking leader since at least 1945, he
 has spent many more of the past 20 years at the center of
 party power than has Chou,  he has probably been the principal
 overseer of party affairs for the past 15 years, he is ap-
 parently Mao's choice to be the leading figure in a post-Mao
 collegium  (like Khrushchev in the Soviet party),  and there
 are many more of his apparent pro'tegas than of Chou's in
 key party posts.
 7.          Two leaders at the politburo level,  Teng Hsiao-ping
 and Peng Chen, can- be tent.tively, not confidently, aligned
 with Liu Shao-chi.  Teng was associated in his early years
 with Chou En-lai,  and became an imvort.a.ct figure in the years
 after Mao Tse-tung established his icadership of the move-
 ment                        (in  1935). Teng 1 -.As again been  tiss.ociated with. Chou
 in recent years as one of his vice premiers,  but Teng has
 been important primarily as a party leader in posts subordi-
 nate to Liu Shao-chi,  posts which Liu probably had the initi-
 ative in filling.   Teng was  the party's chief in 'the South-
 west, and since 1954 he Las beF,n secretary general of the
 central committee and one of the di.: ect.ors (if not the
 principal director) of ocgar i.za.tioral. work at the center, of
 the party apparatus. It w,.s Teng who gave the central com-
 mittee's report on the Kac,--S.ao case (a factional challenge
 to the party leadership) in  1955,  and Tong gave one of the
 two principal reports on party affairs ;Liu gave 'the other)

 at the eighth party congress last  fall,  a .report .in which
 Tend; praised Liu personally;  Tong was at th t time named  the
 ranking member of the new secretariat.    Pong Chen's major
 posts in recent years have also been those in which he has
 been subordinate    to  Lies,   u and c~, som'' if not all of whin''
 ho was probably named   by Liu (or' by Mao and Liu together).
 Pen-, was the party's chief in M-anchuri.,a after World War II
 (then the most important regional post),  and  in 1949 m.ived
 to Peiping to become secretary of the CCP municipal com-
 mittee there; since 1951 he has been concurrent)  mayor, and
 the two posts may give him something close to physical con-
 trol of Peiping;  since 1954 he has been L. s's deputy on the
 NPC standing committee which supervises Chou's state council.
 Peng has been active in lia,son with other Communist parties,
 and has almost certainly played,  with Tong Hsiao-ping,  some
 role in the party's organizational work; at the eighth con-
 gress he was named the second-ranking member (immediately
 below Teng) on the new secretariat.
 8.         There are three full members of the politburo--Chen Yun,
 Li Fu-chun and Chen I?-- and one alternate member,  Chang Wen-
 tien, whose records give  as good grounds for aligning them
 with Chou En-1.ai as those of Teng and Peng do for aligning
 those two with Liu.   Chen fun was early associated with
 Chou,  became a party Reader under Mao,  and was apparently
 closely associated with Mao and Liu until 19.49.  Since that
 time,  however,  he has seemed much closer to Chou,first as
 one of his deputy premiers and, since 1954, as senior deputy.
 Li Fu-chun, with a similar history, has had particularly
 closeassociation with Chou in recent ;;oars as a vice premier
 and chairman of the state planning commission.   Chang Kub-tao
 is confident that Li is a follower of Chou,  and has said that
 Liu Shao-chi used to dislike Li.   Chen I also was early as-
 sociated with Chou, then rose under Mao as a military leader
 and seemed to be Mao's protege, but  in  recent years has
 again appeared close to Chou as a vice Premier a d Chou's
 principal utility man;                                        described       25X1
 Chen as Chou's closest friend.   Chang Wen-tiers has been as-
 sociated with both Liu and Chou, but Liu is said (by Chang
 Kuo-tao) to have intensely disliked Chang, whereas in re-
 cent years Chang has been Chou's senior deputy in the
 ministry of foreign affairs.   However,  even if all four of
 these persons are indeed followers of Chou's:only one of
 them--Chen Yun.-seems to be as important a figure as the two
 leaders--Teng Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen--tentatively aligned
 with Liu.

 9.  It  nay be   that Chen Yun,  the party 's.:foremost figure
 in economic matters, is himself a center of power, and that
 some if not all of the other leaders it economic matters at
 the politburo level are his followers.   A good case could be
 made for aligning Li Fu-chun with Chen,  as the two have
 worked closely for most of the past 20 years in the party's
 organization department (before Liu Shao.-ch:i moved to the
 center),  in an economic department of the party,  in the
 Manchurian bureau, and in the  major economic organs of the
 government.   The careers of the other two economists among
 politburo members,  Li Hsien-nien and Po I-po, have suggested
 closer association with Liu Shao-chi than with Chen Yun; but
 Po since 1949 and Li since 1954 have been importa.nt principal-
 ly as the directors of economic organs under Chen Yun.   In
 any case, it is perhaps incorrect to regard any group of
 economic leaders as an actual or potential center of power,
 in view of their lack of control over the party apparatus
 or police or military organs; they may constitute a center
 of influence rather than of power,  as persons of great im-
 portance to the party but not of much consequence in a con-
 test for Me succession.
 10.         Politburo member Peng Te-huai seems to qualify as a
 center of power because of his apparent domination of the
 military establishment.   He appears to have been almost
 entirely a proteg6 of Mao; Chang Kuo-tao reports him as
 having had poor or indifferent relations with all the other
 senior military leaders,  and as having no close  relations
 with political leaders.   There is nothing in Peng's record
 since Chang's time to provide grounds for aligning Peng
 with anyone but Mao.
 11.    The only other politburo member who appears to be
 i in that
 actual or possible center of power is Kang Sheng, Kang may still have a major role in the party's  9 secret
 police.   Kang was reportedly aligned wi'tthe      ition against Mao before 1935,  but ose under Maomande orfac-
 many years ;until perhaps 1949) headed the party's social
 affairs (secret police) department.   The director of this
 department has not been identified since 1949, and Kang may
 again be the or a director. As  with. Peng Te-hua.i, there is
 nothing in Kang's record which would make plausible an
 alignment of him with anyone except  M.o.   His current status
 is cloudy, as he was demoted at the eighth congress from
 full to alternate member of the politburo and has since
 appeared only to make a minor address at a propaganda con-
 ference.

 13.          The old secretariat of the ccrtrai cam;ni':?:ee exceeded
 its constitutional powers and bac;,~.me  ir:  effect- the polit-
 buro's standing committee and the setter of power in the
 party.   At the eighth congress  the five members of the old
 secretariat, plus Tong lisia?o-ping,  became officially the
 standing committee of the politburo (see Paragraph 4).
 The new secretariat  is  e xoec.ted  to confine itself more
 closely t       its   cc :statt:.ti.)r.ai very important one--
 of o.t tenclin.g to the dally w;,;; k of the con :ral committee--
 that is,  transmit ticg .politburo decisions tr)  the central de-
 p^.-r'tments a;---d regional organs,                formulating measures for im-
 )lc;nentation of those decisions,  and directing and co-ordi-
 nating the work of the pa:rty a.npar'atus.            The secretariat is
 directed in th.s work by the politburo's standing committee,
 probably in largess pa::,:- by Liu Sl,ao ^l:1, and Te;, f: Hsiao-ping
 (as Mao has seemed increasingly to delegate responsibility,
 Chou   is very busy with  the govei,nment, Chu Te is in all
 probability incompetent,  and Chen Yun's duties appear to lie
 primarily in the g.overnmert).     In any sassy  the two ranking
 members of the se ;'retta_rlat  are Tong Hsia?o -ping and Peng Chen.
 It  is evident that .ar: alliance between Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 lisiao-ping on the standing committee,  and Terg again and
 Pen g Chen on the secretariat, would constitute a formidable
 combination in any struggle for power. The ten members of
 the secrp` aria-t seem well qualified by backg?. ound,  and well
 placed in other party and govern ,1er:t posts,  for their various
 duties.   Tong Hsiao?-.ding's background.--as a longtime politi-
 cal officer,  a regional party chief,  and more recently an or-
 ganization specialist at the center                    (while concurrently a
 vice premier) is the model for members of the secretariat.

 to Tong's.   These  are:    Pc111;Chen,  concurrently vice-chairman

 Shao-chi;  Tan Chen-.1. in,  who may have concurrently a post in
 one of  the party's major central departments;  Tan Chong,  con-
 currently deputy minister of defense and director of the
 PI,A's political    :department; IIuang Ko-cheng,  apparently much
 more tL ml. l.i Lary clan than the others, concurrently senior
 deputy minister of defense; Li 1Isue11-feng, concurrently di-
 rector of the party's industrial work department;  Liu Lan -tao,
 concurrently senior deputy director of the party's control
 commission; and Yang Shang-kun,  concurrently director of the
 CCP central committee's general office.  Wang Chia-hsiang's
 background Is similar in part, as he has had some concern
 with political control of the military in the past and was
 once a member of the secretariat,  but in recent years Wang
 has been more concerned with propaganda and foreign affairs;
 he is concurrently a deputy foreign minister and active in
 liaison with other Communist parties.   Hu Chiao-mu, with a
 background entirely in propaganda work,  is deputy director
 of the party's propaganda department.   Some of the first
 seven persons named have probably been directing the party's
 organization department since the fall of Jao Shu-shih in
 1954.   Two other important organs of the party--the social
 affairs (police) departmeir  and the rural work department--
 should logically be represented on the secretariat, which
 has connections with all other of the most important organs
 of the party and government.   However, no member of the
 secretariat is known to be connected with the police, and
 none is known to have a background in agricultural work.
 14.         The two ranking members of the secretariat, Teng Hsiao-
 ping and Peng Chen, have been tentatively aligned with Liu
 Shao-chi  (see Paragraph 7d).   Of the remaining eight full and
 alternate members, three--Tan Chen-lin, Liu Lan-tao and Yang
 Shang-kun--have been close to Teng Hsiao-ping in recent years
 as deputies to the secretary general.   It is not known
 whether they retain these titles in the new secretariat.   Two
 of the three,  Liu and Yang, are said by Chang Kuo-tao to have
 been close to Liu Shao-chi in the past, whereas Tan apparent-
 ly rose as a protege of Mao's.   Another member, Li Hsueh-feng,
 may owe his rise in part to Liu Shao-chi, but has been as-
 sociated with many other leaders,  including member Tan Cheng.
 Tan Cheng began as a protege of Mao, but in recent years
 has seemed closest to politburo member Lo Jung-huan.   Wang
 Chia-hsiang, for several years Tan Cheng's boss in the PLA's
 political department,  in recent years has been closely

 tari :ll;  of  which Tong is the ranking Member.                              As noted above,
 th.ree:.e of the five deputy secretaries general as of fall 195(3--
 Tan Chen-lin,  Liu Lan?-tao and Yang Shang-Run--are included
 in  the now secretariat, with or without their f._rnler titles.
 A fourth, Ma Ming-fang,  is a deputy director of the organiza-
 tion department and a member of the party's control commission.
 The fifth,  :lung Jen--chlung,  As perhaps the best possibility
 to be still a de' uuty secretary general  (and perhaps the only
 one),  as  he was identified as such during the eighth congress
 and is the only one of the former five not known to have any
 other major post in the party.   Ma's past posts as a regional
 leader and current posts at the center of the apparatus sug-
 [rest that he has been a protege of both Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Ilsia.o.-ping.   Sung has been a lieutenant of Ten;' IIsiao-ping's
 for many years.   Thus all five of these onetime deputy secre-
 taries general appear to belong                          in a Liu  Shao-chi/Tong Hsiao-
 pi ng/Peng Chen or a Liu/Teno grouping,  which might bey desig-
 nated an "organizational" group.
 16.         Among the central committee's central departments and
 committees,  the body with the largest known membership and
 most imposing title,  the central control commission,  appears
 to be of comparatively l4.ttle importance.   Headed by old
 Tung Pi-wu,  it is a diciplinary organ to "examine and deal
 with" individual violations of the constitution,  party dis-
 cipline and ethics,  and state laws.   The commission is  not
 empowered, however, to take action against members of the
 CCP central committee, who occupy most key positions in the
 party and govern-enzt.   The commission includes Only a few
 persons of significance,  and  in most cases the importance
 of  these persons appears to derive not from their posts on
 the commission but from their other posts:   Liu Lan-tao of
 the secretariat,  Hsiao Hu.a of the PLA's major departments,
 minister of supervision Chien Ying, Ma Ming-fang of the par-
 ty's organization department,  and procurator-general Chang

 ;supreme court and procuratorato,  the political and cadres  de-
 part:n;ent::n of the PLA,  and  the ministry of supervision.   No
 one hand or combination of hands   is  apparent  in appointments
 to this body.
 17.         The current status of the party's organization depart-
 ment is uncertain.   It is believed to have once been the most
 powerful of the central departments, with control over the
 assignments and discipline of all party personnel except
 the  top leadc,rship.  The importance of this department in the
 past is reflected in the current composition of the party
 politburo.   Of the 11 full members of the politburo still re-
 garded  as major figures,  seven are known or believed to have
 directed the work of this department at some time in 'their
 careers--Mao, Chou, Chen Yun and Li Fu-chun, all before 1946,
 and Litz,  Tong Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen in recent years.   The
 organization department was presumably shaken by the purge
 in 1954 of `.ts then director,  Jao Shu-shah, and some of its
 major functions may have been transferred to the secretariat
 (as in the Soviet party and some others) or to other central
 organs.    The only officers of this department identified in
 the past two years are deputy directors Ma Ming-fang  (June
 1.956) and An Tzu-wen (November 1955).  Three of the leading
 suspects for the post of director of the organization depart-
 ment are members of the secretariat:   Tang, Peng, and Tan
 Chen-lin.   The other two current suspects are the two depu-
 ties, Ma and An, either of whom might have been elevated.
 All  five of these persons are regarded as belonging in an
 ",-,rganizational" grouping around Liu Shao-chi and Teng
 Hs .a?.,-ping.
 18.         The propaganda department has long been accepted as the
 core of 'party activity in the realm of information, education,
 indoctrination and cultural work, including the interpreta-
 tion of doctrinal pronouncements by party leaders.  This de-
 partment shows Mao Tse-tung's hand more clearly than that
 of anyone else.   The department's director, Lu Ting-i, and
 two of the deputy directors,Chen Po-ta and Hu Chiao-mu,
 have been spokesmen for Mao and apparently his proteges for
 many years.  A fourth deputy, Chang Chi-chun, has long been
 a lieutenant of Teng Hsiao-ping.   The fifth,  Chou Yang, can-
 not be aligned with anyone.
 19.         The united front work department is generally believed to
 have had important functions in the past as a link between the

 many party leaders,  perhaps most am:i.ab.ly with Chou Ln-lai.
 Two of the deputy direr Lots,  Chang Chili-?i and Ilsu `1'i-hs.in,
 appear to be Lis own proteges,  and are in the state council's
 eightlc staf C  office which Li heads and which has a similar
 area of concern.   One deputy,  Liao Cheng-chili,  may be a
 protege o-~ Liu Shao-chi,  and another,  Ilse Ping,  may be a
 protege of Chou En-lai.    The records of the other four dep-
 uties do not support even a conjecture.
 20.          The rural work department of the central committee has
 apparently been concerned with helping to formulate the par-
 ty's agricultural policy and to supervise its implementation.
 Tong Tzu-hui is still the director of this department, despite
 his statement that he had been partly responsible for the
 conservative line in socialization of agriculture which was
 personally reversed by Mao in 1955.   Tong's known deputies
 are Liao Lu.-yen and Chen Chen -j en . Sometimes reported as
 a deputy is Chen Po-ta,  Mao's spokesman in the 1955 turnabout,
 although this would be a unique instance of a politburo
 member in a party post subordinate to a nonmember.   Teng, as-
 sociated with most of the party's top leaders at one                         time or
 another, has been regarded as Mao's own choice to head the
 rural work department.   However,  Teng would seem to have
 grounds for resenting his role as the scapegoat in the 1955
 affair and his failure to be elevated to the politburo in
 1956,  as his line on the speed of socialization did not dif-
 fer greatly from  that of other party leaders who went on re-
 cord.,                      and,  in fact, was closer to Mao's final line than were
 statements by many others  (notably Liu Shao-chi).   Chen Po-ta
 (see Paragraph 18)  and Chen Cheng-jen have both seemed to be
 Mao's proteges. Liao Lu-yen seems to he Teng's own protege.
 Both Chen Cheng-jen and Liao have been with Teng for years,
 in the rural work department and in the state council's
 seventh staff office (agriculture and conservation).
 21.          The industrial work department apparently directs and
 supervises some part of the work of party organs in state-owned
 industrial enterprises;  the scope of its authority is not
 clear, and it is not known whether this department has any
 role in formulating policy.  This department's director, Li
 Iisueh-feng, a member of the secretariat, has a background of
 organizational work and of association with party leaders such

 LoJung-huan  (Politburo),  'I'an Cherig
 (Secretariat)  and 'l'ent
 Tv,u-hui  (rural  work department),  but  cannot be aligned with
 anyone.   His only known deputy is Li     Li-san,  whose allegiance
 may be still prim-p.l-,,;;  Hsi Fu--;jen,  onetLine organi:!,ak;ion director in
 the  Inner Mongolian subbcr'eau;  Li                    onetime secro-
 1.:u y al  the Sungkiang committee;  Li  Cho-;jan,  long with Kao
 Kang in the, No,:rthe.ast,  who apparently survived Kao's fall.;
 L.A. Meng-ling, onetime secretary of the Kirin commitl:ee;  Wang
 Kuo-chuan,  onetime secretary of the Jehol committee; Chao
 I--min, with a background in propaganda work, possibly now
 with the propaganda departm.;nt; and Li Chi?-hsir,     labor
 lo2der.
 The structure of power in the go:errarent  is p:'obably of
 much less importance  than the structure of :owe.  in the par-
 ty.                 All. major policies of the government are believed to
 originate in the party politb ro or its standing committee,
 the government is designed as an instrument of the party's
 will,  and the reliability of this instrument seems to be
 assured by the :installation of nar.ty leaders in almost all
 key posts,  by the interlocking of party organs with the
 state machinery,  and by the work of party cells?--transmi.s-
 s:i.s,n,                        interpretation, supervision--in all parts of the gov-
 ernment.   However, the importance of some Chinese Communist
 leaders  (e.g.,  Chou En-lai,  Chen Yun,  Peng To-huai) appears
 to derive primarily from their roles in the government rather
 than in the party;  in other words,  it is believed that their
 influence in party councils is based mainly on their skill
 and prestige as operators of the government machinery,  and
 that their personal followings have largely been acquired
 in the years of such operation.   Moreover,  the possibility
 is not dismissed that a leader of some critical part of the
 government machinery  (e.g.,  Peng Te-huai as minister of de-
 fense or Lo Jui-ching as minister of public security) could
 make common cause with the directors of certain party organs
 and bring the weight of his sector to bear in a struggle for
 the succession.   Finally, relationships among officials of
 the  government illuminate relations among those who are con-
 currently party leaders,  including those  (e.g.,  Liu Shao-chi,
 Teng Hsiao-ping,  Peng Chen) whose importance derives largely
 or almost entirely from their roles in the party organization.
 The chairman  (Ma,o) of the People's Republic of China has
 broad appointive and executive powers,  but most of these are
 procedural and require concurrence by the National People's
 Congress  (meeting annually) or its standing committee.   The
 chairman has power to convene the Supreme State Conference
 (of government leaders) and the National Defense Council (of
 military leaders),  but the former appears to be simply a
 vehicle for making policy decisions public and the latter

 .~;eams at inu-st an advisory body.   The chairman does  not con-
 trol. the machinery o V government,  i . e. ,  the NPC standing
 committee,  the State Council  (the center of government power),
 and the mina,;t.ries and commissions.   The off tce of chairman
 is  thus one of much prestige but little poe;er,  and will  be
 of no importance If vice-chairman Chu Te Gucccc!ds Mao in it.
 M: o's staff office director as of 1955, Chang Ching-wu, may
 or may not still have this post concurrently with his post
 in Tibet;  no successor has been identified in either post.
 27.         The NPC standing committee  (79 persons), a body similar
 to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in the USSR,  "jointly
 _-xercises" with the PRC chaff-man the powers and functions
 of the head of state.   It is empowered to interpret laws,
 issue decrees, ratify treaties, declare war, proclaim mar-
 tial law and order mobilization.   It appoints or removes, on
 the premier':  recommendation, vice premiers, ministers and
 heads of commissions, and has the power to appoint or dis-
 miss on its own initiative a number of other government
 officials of lesser importance. It is also empowered to
 "supervise" the State Council and to annul decisions Of) the
 State Council and its subordinate bodies which contravene
 the Constitution,  laws and decrees.   The NPC standing com-
 :nittce  (meeting about twice a month) has in fact been exercis-
 ing its formal powers.   However, its legislative activity
 has appeared to follow previous action by the State Council,
 and there is no clear instance in which the standing com-
 mittee has exercis'?d its veto power over the State Council.
 Moreover,  its important personnel actions have almost cer-
 tainly been determined by those party organs concerned with
 assignments.   In sum,  the NPC standing committee is poten-
 tially an important body which could come into collision
 with the State Council,  but it has not seemed important to
 date and there is n-.i good evidence of conflict.
 28.         Whereas two politburo members (Mao and Chu) are chair-
 man and vice chairman of the regime,  three others occupy top
 posts in the NPC standing committee.   Liu Shao-chi is the
 chairman, and Peng Chen, tentatively aligned with Liu, is a
 vice chairman and the secretary general.   Lo .Jung-huan,
 aligned with Mao,  is also a vice chairman.   Another vice
 chairman is Li Wei-han, not a politburo member, who may be
 closest to Chou En-lai.   The other two Communist vice chair-
 man need not be considered,as Lin Po-chu is too old and Sai
 Fu-ting is almost always at his post in Sinkiang.

 1 J.          The NPC standing cp,r,m.l ttue also supervises the Work or
 t.wa much less important bodies than the  Late  Council,  these
 he+ing the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
 Procuratcrat.e.   As  the .regime sloes not operate on the prin-
 ciple of separation of powers,  the court Is merely an arm of
 tiio administration,  handling serious criminal and civil
 cases and  (with the Ministry of Justice) directing and super-
 vising the work of lesser courts.   The current president of
 the court is politburo member Tung Pi-we.,  an old comrade
 of Man who has a similar post of some prestige but, probably
 slight importance as head of the party's control commission.
 The procuratorate may be of somewhat greater significance
 than  the court,  as it has supervisory jurisdiction over gov-
 ernment organs and personnel below the level of the State
 Council,  and works with the ministries of Public Security
 and Supervision in the "suppression of counterrevolutionaries"
 and the prosecution of erring officials.  The chief pro-
 curator is central committee member Chang Ting-cheng, who
 apparently began as a protegs of Mao but his been more close-
 ly associated with other party leaders such as Tan Chen-lin
 and Teng Tzu-hui.
 30.         The principal organ of the government has clearly been
 Chou En-lai's State Council (cabinet), the "highest admini-
 strative organ of the state," a body similar to the USSR's
 Council of Ministers.   It drafts laws for the NPC standing
 committee to approve, it formulates administrative measures
 and issues administrative decisions and decrees, and directs
 and co-ordinates the work of 50 ministries and commissions
 as well as all local governments.   The State Council is com-
 posed of the premier (Chou), named by the PRC chairman and
 appointed by the NPC standing committee  (which cannot re-
 move the premier); the vice premiers  (currently l2, 10
 of them politburo members) and the secretary general, all
 nominated by the premier and appointed (and removed) by the
 NFC standing committee; and the ministers and heads of com-
 missions, all nominated by the premier and appointed (and
 removed) by the NPC standing committee.   This body is sup-
 posed to meet in plenary session once a month.  However,
 there is a sort of standing committee or "inner cabinet" com-
 prised of Chou and his 12 vice premiers and possibly the
 secretary general, which is probably in session much of the
 time,  although not at full strength,  as some members are ab-
 sent much or most of the time.
 31.          It seems almost certain that Chou En-lai has not decided
 unilaterally upon his vice premiers,   but that these appoint-
 ments                      instead represent decisions by the par--y politburo

 only one reg;ulvr member,  Liu Po-cheng,  and four alternates,
 Chang Wen-t ien,   Lu 'rang-i,  Chen Po-ta and Kang Shong.) This
 "inner cabinet" is comprised of :   senior vice premier Chen
 Yt.z.n,  the -top economic co-ordinator and perhaps the nearest
 thing to Chou as a general talent in government operations;
 Teng Ilsiao-ping,  presumably concerned with the party organi-
 zation in the government;  Peng Te-huai,  the regime's top
 military man; Li Fu-chun and Po I-po, the principal economic
 planners;  Li Hsien-nien,  in recent years a specialist in fi-
 nance and trade; Tong Tzu-hui (non-politburo), a specialist
 in agriculture; Chen I, a utility man for Chou in foreign
 affairs; Ulanfu, who spends much of his time in Inner Mon-
 golia;  and,  as less important figures,  Lin Piao,  sick and
 out of Peiping, Ho Lung and Nieh Jung-then (the latter non-
 politburo), who seem to be used for small jobs, and possibly
 Secretary General Hsi Chung-hsun  (neither a politburo member
 nor a vice premier),  who see:is to be a housekeeper.   The
 nine important figures of the "inner cabinet"  (in addition
 to Chou) have been discussed in Paragraphs 7-12; Chen Yur.,
 Li Fu-chun and Chen I have been tentatively aligned with
 Chou En-tai,  Teng Hsiao-ping with Liu Shao-chi, Peng Te-huai
 with his own "military" group,  and  Li Hsien-nien,  Po I-po,
 Tong Tzu-hui and Ulanfu with no one.
 32.         The premier, vice premiers and secretary general work
 through the premier's office,  the secretariat and eight staff
 offices.   The premier's office and secretariat, headed by
 minor figures,  protegds of Chou and IIsi Chung-hsun,  are re-
 sponsible for various aspects of administration and perhaps
 for liaison with provincial and local governments.     The more
 important staff offices, two headed by politburo members and
 the other six by full members of the central committee, di-
 rect and co-ordinate  the  work  of 40 of the 42 ministries
 and possibly some of the eight commissions, and link the
 government machinery with the appropriate central departments
 of the party.  The known or apparent areas of concern of the
 staff offices, and their directors, are:   first, internal
 security and related judicial matters,  to Jui-ching;  second,
 education and culture, Line Feng; third, heavy industry,
 Po I-po; fourth, labor and light industry, Chia To-fu; fifth,
 finance, currency and trade, Li Hsien-nien; sixth, transport

 dOUbt:Cu't  that Chou alone selects the (1irect.ors of  ;ta.Cf of-
 fices.   However,  Chou may well have a larger voice                            than  any
 one e. .r. in appointments t-) the staff offices.   Four of                 these
 eight directors have been discussed earlier:           Po                    I-po,  I_,i
 Ilsicn?-n Len and Tend; Tzu-hui cannot be aligned      with anyone,
 whereas Li Wei -han  (di.rectoxr of the united front work depart-
 ment)  has perhaps been closest to Chou En-lai.                             As for the
 other four:   Lo Jui-ching, who is also minister of public
 security and commander and political officer of public securi-
 ty forces in                    the PLA,  '.as seemed to be a Mao proteg4 through-
 out his career,  but may also have close ct:)nnections with
 party police figures such as hang Sheng and Li         Ko-nung;  Lin
 Feng,  who has no known major post in the party at this time,
 has a background as a regional leader and organizational
 specialist which would justify a tentative alignment of Lin
 with Liu Shao-chi and/ or Peng Chen;  both Chia To-fu and
 Wang  Shou-tao have apparently been associated with Liu Shao-
 chi during their careers,  but neither can be aligned ,.,,i?th
 him or any other leader. The Pnown deputy directors of these
 eight staff offices seem in all cases to be party leathers
 of less importance that the directors, although .f rther in-
 fornlation may not support that view.   These deputies in some
 cases, particularly in the third, seventh and eighth staff
 offices,  seem to be proteges of the directors.
 33.          Lo Jui-ching's first staff office directs the work of
 the ministries of  Public  Security,  Supervision,  J!'stice,
 and Interior.   Much of the most important of these is the
 Ministry of Public Security,  an overt police agency headed
 by Lo himself, which is the center of the nation-wide police
 system reaching down to the village and bloc, and which also
 controls penal labor.   The work of the staff office and of
 this key ministry is almost certainly co-ordinated with the
 work of the social affairs (covert police) department of
 the party.   Lo's senior deputy in the staff office,  Wu Te-
 feng,  has spent much of his career with the social -affairs
 department,      and five of Lo's eight deputies in the ministry
 (Chen Lung,    Chou Hsing,  Wang Tung-hsing,  Hsu Chien-kuo and
 Wang Chin-hsiang) have reportedly worked in that department
 in the past,   Some of these persons probably have posts in
 the social affairs department concurrently.   The staff office
 and ministry may work with the party's organization depart-
 ment as well.   Another deputy in the staff office,  Chu Chi-wen,
 has a background primarily in organizational work; the back-
 ground Df the third deputy,  Chang Chih-hsing,                           is not known.

 of ..lustice,   nominally under a non-Comnmunist female,  super-
 vises  judicial departments of provincial  and local govern-
 ments and is involved in action against  "counterrevolu-
 tionaries" and  tonpolitical offenders.       The real. director
 of this ministry is probably deputy minister Chen Yang-shan,
 who has a. background in public security work.   The Ministry
 of  Interior, nominally headed by party elder Hsieh Chueh?-
 tsai,  now 76,  has been concerned with veterans' affairs,
 disaster relief, mobilization of labor for public works, and
 various lesser matters.  As noted ; bot'e,  Lo Jui-ching has
 apparently been a Mao protege but may be close to some of
 the secret police leaders,  as may be WYu Te-feng of the staff

 Chien Ying nor Chen Yang-shan can be aligned, and the real

 ministries of Culture,  Education,  Higher Education and Public
 Health, as well as the regime's official news agency and the

 sports commission.   The Ministry of Culture, the governmental
 counterpart of the party's propaganda department, is nominally
 headed by a non-Communist; which of his deputies is the real
 director is not known.   The same is true of the Ministry of
 Education.   This ministry and the Ministry of Higher Education,
 under central  committee member Yang Hsiu-feng,  between them
 exercise governmental controls over the entire educational
 system.   The Ministry of Higher Education appears also to
 contro . the assignments of college graduates, and presumably
 works closely with the bureau (once ministry) of personnel,
 which recruits and trains government personnel and may be
 subordinate to this second staff office.   The Ministry of
 Public Health, nominally headed by a non-Communist woman,
 plans and directs programs to improve health, sanitation and
 medical facilities,  and to promote birth control; the real
 directors of the ministry  -e unknown.   The physical culture

 concerned merely with popularizing athletics.   Lin Feng,  di-
 rector of the staff office, has a background primarily in
 organizational and secondarily in propaganda work, and may

 cerned with small electrical equipment (consumer goods such
 as household appliances).   The ministries of Power Equipment
 Industry and Electric Power Industry,  headed by central com-
 mittee alternate members Chang Lin-chin and Liu Lan-po,  ap-
 pear to be :,esponsibl.e respectively for plants malting power
 and medical equipment and for the construction of power fa-
 cilities and the operation of certain power transmission net-
 works.  (A State Council directive of 1955 indicated that  the
 Ministry of Electric Power Industry was subordinate to the
 sixth staff office,  and it may be still;  however,  If  is be-
 lieved that the lines of command change,                           and this ministry
 seems to fit better under this third staff office).      The
 Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, under central committee
 alternate member Wang Ho-shou,  concurrently chairman of the
 national construction commission,  has bureaus concerned with
 ferrous and nonferrous metals, with a special bureau for the
 Anshan complex in Manchuria;  this ministry may be responsible
 for extraction of ferrous and nonferrous minerals.  The Minis-
 try of Geology,  nominally headed by non-Communist Li Ssu-kuang
 (perhaps really headed by deputy minister Liu Chieh, who is
 a deputy director of this third staff office), conducts long-
 range surveys and guides the short-range surveys of individual
 ministries, but probably does not handle the actual exploita-
 tion of resources.   The Ministries of Petroleum  Industry and
 Coal  Industry,  headed respectively by Li Chu-kuei and central
 committee member Chen Yu, are responsible for the production
 of oil and coal.    The Ministry of Building Materials In-
 dustry, under Lai Chi-fa,  is responsible for the production
