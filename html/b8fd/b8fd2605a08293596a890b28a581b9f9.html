 Secret
 The Israeli bombing of the PLO Headquarters in Tunis on 1 October and the US
 interception of the Achille Lauro hijackers will even more closely identify the
 United States and Israel as a common foe in the view of Middle Eastern terrorists.
 As a result, we can expect attacks against US targets by Middle Eastern groups
 that previously limited themselves to targeting Israeli or Jewish interests.
 While Iran has not been directly implicated in any terrorist attacks during the past
 six months, Iranian-backed groups have remained active, and elements of the
 Iranian regime have conducted operational planning.
 Radical Lebanese Shias have exacted the highest price to US interests from
 terrorist actions anywhere in the world. The apparent murder of US hostage
 William Buckley by his Hizballah captors-ostensibly in retaliation for the Israeli
 airstrike on Tunis-may demonstrate their frustration at their inability to secure
 the release of Shia prisoners still held in Kuwait.
 Hizballah
 Hizballah will remain a potent threat to US and Israeli interests in Lebanon, the
 Persian Gulf, and even Europe. The group may well carry out its threat to murder
 its other American hostages. Even without that threat, all remaining US citizens
 and the Israeli presence in the south remain vulnerable to terrorist attack. In
 addition, radical Shias have demonstrated an increased capability to strike in the
 Persian Gulf countries, particularly in Kuwait. The United States has a heavy
 economic, diplomatic, and military presence in the Gulf, and US personnel and
 facilities in the region remain vulnerable. In Europe, the plan to strike the US
 Embassy in Rome last November indicates the potential for Iranian-supported
 operatives there.
 Palestinian Groups
 Palestinian groups are likely to launch retaliatory attacks against US and Israeli
 interests. PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat probably will have to cope with increasing
 demands from the PLO Executive Committee to retaliate against the United
 States. Fatah hardliners have long advocated a more militant posture, and they are
 now in a stronger position to press Arafat to approve more frequent and
 spectacular terrorist attacks.
 Palestinian leaders have grown increasingly frustrated with what they view as
 Washington's unquestioned support for Israel. The PLO may soon conclude that
 the only way to keep attention on its grievances with Israel-and demonstrate its
 capability as a national liberation movement-is to step up operations against
 Israel and to attack Israel's prime benefactor, the United States.

 Secret
 Arafat probably will sanction an increase in attacks on Israeli interests worldwide
 in an effort to preserve Fatah unity. He may continue to resist pressure for attacks
 against US interests-in an effort to avoid further loss of international
 credibility-but he may not discourage freelance operations by PLO splinter
 groups.
 Some Palestinian groups may be planning attacks to obtain the freedom of the four
 men who took over the Achille Lauro. Abu Abbas, leader of the Palestinian faction
 responsible for the Achille Lauro hijacking, stated that efforts would be
 undertaken to free the hijackers. The PLO representative in West Germany
 predicted that an American or Italian airplane would be hijacked during October
 or that another American would be killed to force the release of the hijackers.
 Libya
 Libya's primary targets continue to be Libyan exiles and the Governments of
 Egypt, Tunisia, Chad, and Zaire. Although Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhafi
 may continue to avoid targeting US personnel or facilities out of fear of retaliation,
 he may be willing to work through surrogates to hit US targets if he feels the
 potential benefits outweigh the risk of discovery. Qadhafi might be tempted to
 attack the United States in countries where he believes he could exploit a surge of
 anti-US sentiment-such as Sudan or Tunisia.
 Libya has already sponsored terrorist attacks against Tunisian interests this year,
 and strong US support for President Bourguiba against the Libyans has made the
 United States a potential target. Zaire, whose President Mobutu has close ties
 both to the United States and Israel, remains a third-echelon target for anti-US
 attacks.
 Israel's reputation for swift and successful retribution strongly discourages
 Qadhafi from targeting that nation's interests. Should operational ties between
 Libya and radical Palestinian groups become closer, however, Libya may consider
 using Palestinian surrogates to hit Israeli targets.
 Syria
 Syria has acted as a patron and director of international terrorism, rather than as a
 direct practitioner, during the past two years. Damascus will encourage attacks by
 groups it supports if such attacks serve Syrian interests and Damascus's hand can
 be concealed. Among the groups likely to be encouraged by the Syrians are the
 anti-Arafat Palestinians and the Syrian Socialist National Party (SSNP). The
 Syrians will make every effort to retard progress in the peace process, using
 terrorist attacks to keep the level of antagonism high among Israel, Jordan, and
 the pro-Arafat Palestinians. Moreover, Damascus will continue its efforts to make
 the Israeli presence in south Lebanon as costly as possible. It is providing logistic
 support and encouragement to the SSNP's car bomb campaign against the Israeli
 armed forces and their allies in the Army of South Lebanon, for example.

 Secret
 Middle Easterners have already increased their attacks against Israel outside of
 their home region, chiefly in Europe. Israeli and Jewish targets have been hit six
 times in the first six months of 1985-twice the 1984 rate. Both the Achille Lauro
 hijacking and the murders of three Israelis at a yacht club in Cyprus on 25
 September indicate this trend will continue.
 The United States has already been threatened, along with Israel, since the ship
 hijacking. Two Palestinians were arrested in Rome on 15 October carrying
 explosives they said they intended to use against Israel and the United States. In
 addition, an unknown caller made a bomb threat against the US section of
 Sigonella Airbase in Sicily on 15 October.
 US and Israeli interests could also be targeted by indigenous West European
 terrorist groups. Some of these groups attacked Israeli targets "in solidarity" with
 Middle Easterners following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

 Highlights
 Threats to US Interests
 The US interception of the Achille Lauro hijackers has significantly increased the
 terrorist threat to US and NATO interests in Italy. In recent weeks, US facilities
 have been the targets of bomb threats and surveillance activity by Middle Eastern
 individuals. The indigenous Red Brigades terrorist group announced on 18
 October that it too would protest the US action by attacking NATO targets. ~~ 25X1
 Brigades and other indigenous Italian terrorist groups.
 US and NATO facilities located in Italy remain vulnerable to surreptitious entry
 and auto bombings, as indicated by the increasing number of military uniforms
 and base passes either lost or stolen in recent months. We believe the long-term
 threat posed by Palestinian and other Middle Eastern terrorist groups to US
 interests in Italy is likely to continue and overshadow that posed by the Red
 movement.
 Communist Combatant Cells Broaden Target Spectrum
 On 19 October the Combatant Communist Cells (CCC) bombed a Belgian armed
 forces information office. In claiming responsibility for the attack, the group
 announced the opening of a "second front" called the "Pierre Akkerman
 campaign" against bourgeois militarism and pacifism. Akkerman was a Belgian
 Communist killed in the Spanish Civil War in 1937. This was followed on 20
 October-the day of a national antimissile demonstration in Brussels-by an
 apparent CCC bombing of the vehicle and home of the president of the antinuclear
 protests.
 In its 19 October communique, the group declared that its "second front" is
 directed against mass public demonstrations protesting missile deployment, which
 it terms the "usual, useless, ineffective petit bourgeois sterile actions." The
 antipacifist attack could have been the work of a dissident faction within the
 group, or the first of several operations timed to coincide with the antimissile
 of Belgian society and reduce its potential pool of recruits.
 If the CCC is now targeting the pacifist movement-which might have provided it
 with allies and supporters-it is likely to further isolate itself from leftist segments
 operations. It has also bombed domestic political targets.
 The attack against the pacifist leader marks the CCC's second change in targeting
 recently, and the fourth in less than a year. In early October, it announced the
 beginning of a "Karl Marx" anticapitalist campaign. The group emerged in
 October 1984 and attacked mainly NATO and defense-related targets in its initial

 Abu Nidal Said Planning Terrorist Attacks
 Seven members of the radical Palestinian terrorist group Abu Nidal reportedly are
 planning to carry out terrorist operations against Turkish security forces. The
 attacks apparently are intended to retaliate for Turkish successes against the
 group following the assassination on 24 July of a Jordanian diplomat. The Abu
 Nidal Group claimed responsibility for the incident under the name Black

 accordingly. Another possible scenario involves the bombings of densely populated
 areas. Authorities have enhanced security at the more likely targets and have
 Kuwaiti interests as their primary target and have instructed their personnel
 no casualties in any of the attacks.
 Five Bombings in Six Days by Action Directe
 In its busiest week this year, the leftwing terrorist group this October bombed
 targets to protest South Africa's apartheid system and the activities of the rightist
 National Front Party-accused by Action Directe and others of racism. Two
 bombs severely damaged buildings housing the state-run radio and television
 stations in Paris on 14 October. On 16 October, in Marseille, the group bombed
 the offices of Securite et Liberte, an organization related to the National Front,
 and on 17 October it attacked the offices of the French broadcasting authority. On
 19 October the group bombed a French airline doing business with South Africa to
 protest the execution of black poet Benjamin Moloise on the same day. There were

 These bombings were carried out by the "Symbolic Wing" of Action Directe and
 may portend additional attacks against targets related to the rightist party or
 South Africa. The "Symbolic Wing" previously bombed four French companies
 with business interests in South Africa on 5 September. A second hardline

 for the death of the Beit Shemesh couple.
 Palestinian Terrorist Cell Smashed
 Israeli security forces in a firefight wiped out a five-man Palestinian terrorist cell
 operating near Hebron. Four of the terrorists were killed and one was wounded in
 the Israeli ambush. The cell was allegedly responsible for killing five Israelis and
 wounding 18 others over the past year and a half, including murdering a couple
 near Beit Shemesh on 2 October. An Israeli official said the group began its
 activities independently and subsequently established links to the PLO in Jordan.
 Fatah Force 17-Arafat's personal bodyguard-reportedly claimed responsibility
 the SSNP militia's participation in the recent fighting in Tripoli.
 Wave of Attacks on SSNP Centers and Officials
 Between 1 and 3 October, five attacks occurred against facilities and personnel of
 the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) in Beirut. One bomb exploded near the
 SSNP main offices, another was thrown near the offices of the party's magazine,
 and a third was defused near an SSNP local office. Assailants also tossed a
 grenade at the home of a party official and fired rockets at the home of the SSNP
 military commander. The attacks caused no casualties and only minor damage.
 The Arab Struggle Organization and Islamic Jihad both claimed responsibility for
 three of the incidents. In addition, a third group calling itself "Beirut's Free
 Revolution," claimed credit for one of the other attacks. The attacks, however,
 probably were conducted by the Islamic Unification Movement in retaliation for
 Damascus. Neither device exploded, however.
 Bombs Linked to Fighting in Lebanon
 A bomb exploded in a shop on the ground floor of a hotel near Martyrs' Square in
 Damascus on 25 September, killing an unknown number of persons. Four days
 earlier, two car bombs were discovered at two different locations in downtown
 militia forces attacking Sunni Muslim units in Tripoli, Lebanon.
 Syrian officials strongly suspect that either members of the Islamic Unification
 Movement (IUM) or pro-Arafat Palestinians planted the bombs. The IUM, which
 is supported by pro-Arafat Palestinians, has been under attack by Syrian-backed
 forces during recent fighting in Tripoli, Lebanon. One of these groups probably is
 using the recent bombings to pressure Damascus to end its support for Lebanese

 and other locations in Kuwait in December 1983.
 Dawa Party Terrorism Reemerges
 Iraqi security forces on 13 October engaged in a daylong firefight with an
 undetermined number of Dawa (Islamic Call) Party members in Al-Juzani, a small
 village on the east side of the Tigris River
 The deployment of an entire brigade of Iraqi security forces may indicate that the
 Dawa group numbered more than the 100 officially estimated by Baghdad. On the
 same day, Iraqi security forces intercepted five Dawa Party members in
 Ridhwaniyz, killing three. These incidents were the first inside Iraq since April
 1983 involving the Dawa Party. Dawa Party members bombed the US Embassy
 Kuwaiti leaders.
 Continued Likelihood of Terrorist Attacks
 Iranian-backed Shia terrorists are still planning to launch attacks against Kuwaiti
 and US interests                                        . Iranian-
 backed Dawa Party members, teamed up with Lebanese Hizballah, reportedly
 intend to attack Kuwaiti or US interests in Kuwait-possibly the Kuwaiti ruling
 family or the US Embassy. The Hizballah members reportedly left Beirut on 27
 September. Meanwhile, Kuwaiti authorities have identified four individuals in
 Cyprus planning to hijack a Kuwaiti or American civilian airliner in the name of
 the Islamic Jihad Organization. These Iranian-sponsored attacks appear intended
 to intimidate Kuwait into ending its support for Iraq, obtain the release of the 17
 members of the Dawa Party imprisoned in Kuwait, and perhaps remove key

 The group probably wanted to erode public confidence in the president by

 Fatah's Security and
 Intelligence Organizations:
 Operational Capabilities
 Israel has charged the Western Sector and Force 17,
 two of Fatah's key security organizations, with
 responsibility for recent increased terrorist activity in
 the West Bank. Israel states-and we believe that
 mounting evidence tends to support Tel Aviv's
 claims-that Force 17 was responsible for the killing
 on 25 September of three Israeli yachtsmen at
 Larnaca, Cyprus. Both Force 17 and the Western
 Sector have main offices in Amman and would be
 major targets should Israel carry out its threat to
 bomb PLO facilities in Jordan.
 Fatah's Security Apparatus
 Fatah began training selected officers for its security
 apparatus in 1968 to provide operational intelligence
 and military support for guerrilla attacks in Israel. By
 1970-71, Fatah's intelligence service had developed
 into an elaborate structure. During the early 1970s,
 whenever Fatah engaged in international terrorism, it
 used the covert Black September Organization (BSO),
 which gained its greatest notoriety by killing Israeli
 athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and taking
 over the Saudi Embassy in Sudan in 1973, killing the
 US Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission. The
 BSO has been dormant since 1974, following
 widespread opposition from senior and middle-level
 Fatah officials, including Arafat, to the BSO's
 international operations. Although former BSO leader
 Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad) has tried to revive the
 organization,                    he has not
 found many takers. During its most active period in
 the early 1970s, the BSO was believed to have
 approximately 300 operatives.
 Although Fatah's exodus from Lebanon in 1982-83
 and the dispersal of the PLO Fatah leadership have
 disrupted some Fatah command and control
 capabilities, we believe Fatah maintains a fairly
 competent operational ability to collect intelligence
 and mount operations against its enemies.
 judgments are based on what we know of Fatah's
 operational performance and what we can surmise
 from recent Fatah-inspired operations against Israel
 and Syria. Several groups within Fatah's security and
 intelligence apparatus-the Western Sector, Force
 17, and the United Security Organization-are
 specifically assigned the responsibility of carrying out
 military operations in Israel and the Occupied
 Territories and, more recently, reprisals against
 Damascus for attacks by Syrian-supported
 Palestinians on pro-Arafat Palestinians and
 Jordanians.
 Arafat maintains control over the various leaders of
 the security groups by cultivating the internal rivalry
 and jockeying for power that exists among his
 subordinates who head these organizations. Arafat's
 style of management may contribute to a lack of
 cohesion in the security organizations, but it also
 promotes competition among them to claim
 responsibility for certain operations. In some cases
 this practice has led to exaggerated or false claims.
 We believe that such rivalries probably have been a
 factor in the recently increased Fatah-directed
 terrorism against Israelis on the West Bank.           125X1
 The Organizations
 Western Sector. The Western Sector, led by Deputy
 Commander Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad), is the
 Fatah body primarily responsible for military
 operations in Israel and the Occupied Territories.
 Several "committees" located in the West Bank are
 responsible for recruiting operatives and maintaining
 specific underground networks. We have no specific
 information about the methods or effectiveness of the
 committees but judge they would have little trouble
 finding eager recruits among young West Bank
 Palestinians impatient with political solutions

 Israel charges that the Western Sector's increased
 presence in Jordan is directly responsible for recent
 terrorist attacks inside Israel and the Occupied
 Territories. Abu Jihad has taken credit for two
 abortive seaborne attacks the Israelis stopped last
 March and April. Abu Jihad has also claimed his
 group was responsible for two attacks in August on
 Israeli citizens living in the West Bank in which one
 tendency to claim credit for independent operations
 undertaken by West Bank Palestinians.
 In spite of what we believe to be stringent Jordanian
 efforts to monitor the activities of the Western Sector,
 it is possible that Sector operatives may have
 prompted recent attacks. Israel's release last May of
 1,150 Palestinian prisoners, including some 600 that
 Israel allowed to stay in the West Bank, may have
 contributed to recent attacks by supplying
 experienced manpower.
 Abu Jihad has been made fully aware of the penalties
 the Sector faces if it is caught planning or attempting
 cross-border operations against Israel from Jordan.
 We believe Amman will be more emphatic in warning
 Arafat that any efforts to conduct or plan terrorist
 operations from Jordanian soil will result in the
 immediate expulsion of PLO leaders.
 United Security Organization (USO). Controlled by
 the PLO but staffed primarily with Fatah personnel,
 the USO appears to be responsible for collecting
 intelligence in Europe and the Middle East and may
 be responsible for running the PLO's more "sensitive"
 operations against anti-Arafat Palestinians. The
 status and duties of the USO have evolved largely
 from the influence of its head, senior PLO Fatah
 official Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad). Abu Iyad's BSO
 terrorist heritage, a legend that he has neither
 encouraged nor dispelled, may color some of the
 information about him and the USO.
 Abu Iyad's headquarters are in Tunis, but most
 operational activities appear to be run from the USO
 office in East Berlin, which was opened in May 1983.
 that office is
 responsible for rebuilding an infrastructure to prepare
 for terrorist activities in Western Europe and to
 protect Fatah/PLO interests and personnel from
 hostile terrorist activity mounted by Israel or by
 radical Palestinian groups supported by Syria. Abu
 Iyad may have smaller offices in Algeria and Eastern
 Europe (possibly Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, or
 Czechoslovakia).
 USO in Amman where security officials meet to
 coordinate their work. We have no further
 information on the plans and activities of the Amman
 USO office and believe that its purpose is more for
 prestige than operational use. In early 1982, the USO
 had a military headquarters in the Beirut area, which
 we assume closed when Arafat departed Lebanon.
 Arafat transferred some of the
 duties from Fatah's Central Security Organization to
 the USO following the assassination of PLO
 Executive Committee member Fahd Qawasmah the
 month before by Syrian-sponsored radical
 Palestinians. The added duties included some
 operations outside Israel and the Occupied Territories
 as well as additional security functions in Tunis,
 Amman, and the Gulf states. Arafat probably
 intended this shift to unify Fatah's efforts at
 launching a retaliatory campaign against Damascus,
 as Abu Iyad is the senior security official for the PLO

 Outlook
 Arafat's security chiefs will press for reprisals against
 Israel's airstrike on PLO headquarters. Stronger
 warnings by King Hussein against conducting
 terrorist operations from Jordan may cause Arafat to
 urge restraint until Fatah operatives can carry out an
 operation against Israeli targets that cannot be traced
 to Fatah operatives in Jordan.
 Looking ahead, Arafat cannot, and will not, renounce
 terrorism and still retain leadership over the PLO and
 the loyalty of Fatah members, his first priority. In our
 judgment, Fatah operatives would be quite capable of
 carrying out acts of terrorism against what Fatah
 considered hostile international interests, including
 those of the United States.

 South Korea: Security Preparations
 for the 1988 Olympics
 South Korea is now addressing the special security
 requirements associated with its role as host of the
 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olympics.
 Although it is too early to expect specific threat
 information, Seoul has already begun to broaden its
 security focus from primarily intercepting North
 Korean espionage agents to dealing with attacks by
 any foreign terrorists intent on disrupting the games.
 Immediately after Seoul won the competition for the
 Olympic site, President Chun Doo Hwan established
 a legal and administrative framework to coordinate
 security preparations. Early attention has focused on
 preparing the large and otherwise well-trained police
 force and Army to deal with terrorist tactics and
 hostage situations-areas in which Seoul has had
 limited experience. The current divisions and
 competition among the security services, however,
 suggest that bureaucratic wrangling could hamper
 decisionmaking if a crisis were to arise at the
 Olympics. So could potential political infighting as
 the games approach in 1988-a time frame that
 coincides with Chun's decision to step down and
 transfer power to an as yet undetermined successor.
 Counterterrorism Policymaking
 South Korea has had 30 years of experience in dealing
 with the threat posed by North Korean agents and
 infiltrators, but its officials believe that hosting the
 1988 Summer Olympic Games-which probably will
 attract close to 30,000 participants and over 350,000
 visitors-requires a specially focused security effort.
 To start the process, President Chun Doo Hwan
 issued Presidential Order No. 47 in early 1982,
 creating the National Antiterrorism Planning
 Committee. Chaired by the Prime Minister, the
 committee meets on an ad hoc basis and includes the
 Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs, National
 Defense, and Transportation, as well as the Director
 of the National Security Planning Agency (NSP) and
 the chief of South Korea's Customs Administration.
 The National Executive Committee for
 Antiterrorism, which in effect serves as a working
 group, is subordinate to this national committee.F
 These committees are responsible for police planning
 and working-level coordination, but the NSP, as the
 principal civilian intelligence and security
 organization, retains overall responsibility for
 antiterrorist activities and for ensuring that other
 government agencies fulfill their specific
 counterterrorism responsipiliies. To do so, the NSP

 The primary operational or "on-the-street"
 responsibility for dealing with security threats rests
 with the Home Ministry and its associated Korean
 National Police. The Ministry maintains a team of
 hostage negotiators and provides command and
 control for the KNP's 100-man commando unit. The
 police commandos form an assault unit to be used
 only inside South Korea upon the order of the
 President. The unit is authorized to draw on regular
 police and combat police forces for additional support.

 The second operational arm of the government is the
 Special Warfare Command (SWC) under the
 Ministry of National Defense. It is responsible for
 responding to terrorist incidents overseas-these
 troops so far have not been actually deployed

 attacks. The Defense Ministry has formed a

 seven 1,800-man commando brigades. The
 Counterterrorist Group is composed of 140 men and
 can be augmented as needed by men from the SWC

 The military and police counterterrorist commandos
 are proficient in traditional martial arts and have
 received airborne, ranger, sniper, demolitions, and
 specialized assault training. Most KNP commandos
 have been recruited from military explosive ordnance
 disposal and special forces units and trained at the
 Special Warfare Training Center near Yongin, about
 25 miles south of Seoul. The center also has facilities
 for teaching various types of airborne operations.
 In 1983 South Korea began adding counterterrorist

 counterterrorist skills.

 Germany's elite commando unit was to train six
 South Korean counterterrorist commandos for a two-
 month period this summer. We do not know whether
 this training actually occurred.
 Security Organizations
 In addition to these specialized units, Seoul has other
 longstanding organizations that will also play roles in
 Olympic security. These include:
 ? The Presidential Security Force (PSF), which
 protects President Chun, his family, and his
 residence, the Blue House. It could be used to
 provide VIP protection and might be augmented by
 police commando units.
 ? The Defense Security Command (DSC), which is
 under the nominal control of the Defense Ministry,
 reports directly to President Chun. It watches senior
 military leaders, monitors student dissidents, and
 keeps track of other persons who might threaten the
 South Korean Government.
 Protection against seaborne infiltration and entries
 through airports are the responsibilities of other units.
 Presidential Order No. 47 charges the Port and
 Harbor Security Measures Working-Level
 Consultative Council with providing protection
 against surreptitious infiltration into the country.

 threat comes from agents who might enter the

 Seoul not only capitalizes on the average
 South Korean's strong anti-Communism but also
 advertises the methods used by spies and saboteurs,
 gives rewards for information leading to the arrest of
 agents, and harshly punishes anyone who harbors
 infiltrators. Moreover, since many assumed agents are
 native-born South Koreans or have been in place for

 Seoul. Although there were no reported problems in
 this effort, difficulties were evident in the
 coordination of both President Chun's trip to Japan in
 September 1984 and the return of Kim Dae Jung to
 Korea in February 1985. Events at Kim Dae Jung's
 homecoming, in particular, point to some of the major
 challenges Seoul must tackle.
 Three issues, in our view, are especially important.
 First, the South Koreans are conditioned to react to
 security incidents with a rapid military or
 paramilitary response. This predisposition makes the
 escalation to tougher steps attractive and easy when
 an incident unfolds unexpectedly, such as when Kim
 Dae Jung did not follow the prearranged scenario for
 his deplaning at Kimp'o Airport. That incident also
 seemed to reveal the typical South Korean perspective
 that regards a tough government posture as an
 implicit affirmation of control over political and
 security developments. In the Kim case, as well as the
 more recent USIS sit-in, Seoul clearly regarded US
 calls for restraint as threats to its image as a
 government in control.
 Second, concerns about international reaction, which
 further complicated the treatment of Kim, will come
 into play in any incident associated with the Asian
 Games or the Olympics that involves non-Korean
 victims or perpetrators. South Korean security
 services do not normally accord high priority to
 Foreign Ministry interests, either in bureaucratic
 forums or during security incidents. To operate
 effectively in the environment surrounding the
 international games, the security services will have to
 exercise patience, diplomacy, and restraint,
 controlling their instincts to deal with problems in the
 most expeditious way possible.
 Finally, the successful handling of any security
 incident will require improvements in coordination
 and cooperation among the many bureaucracies
 involved, a challenge that goes beyond the mere
 establishment of a complex management
 superstructure. Responsibility for handling Kim Dae
 Jung at the airport was split between the two vice
 directors of the NSP
 . President Chun has
 since explicitly charged NSP Director Chang Se
 Dong with responsibility for security concerns
 associated with the Asian Games and the Olympics.
 Director Chang already appears to be consolidating
 responsibility for Asian Games security within the
 NSP's First Bureau.
 The Political Imponderables
 South Korea's domestic political situation probably
 will affect security provisions for the Olympics.
 President Chun has pledged to step down when his
 term expires in 1988, and pressures are building for
 him to begin taking positive steps toward political
 modernization.
 If Chun attempts to prolong his term of office or
 otherwise disappoints public expectations, the security
 services could well become preoccupied with the
 resultant fallout and the probable widespread
 domestic dissent. At the very least, in a confused
 domestic situation, coordination among the services

 would deteriorate as each attempted to influence
 events. Interservice rivalries could intensify if the
 military felt forced to take a hand in the succession by
 backing one of the candidates. Even if the transfer of
 power is smooth, we see some complications for
 Olympic security. At the very least, South Korea's
 new leader would probably name new men to key
 positions in the security services.

 Chronology of Terrorism-1985
 Below are described noteworthy foreign and international events involving
 terrorists, or the use of terrorist tactics, which have occurred or come to light
 since our last issue. In some cases, the perpetrators and their motivations may not
 be known. Events and developments that have already been described elsewhere in
 this publication are not included.
 11 September             Sri Lanka: Bomb destroys offices of assistant government agent in northern town.
 Later the same day, unidentified persons set fire to other buildings in the same
 complex. No group has claimed credit, but Tamil separatist guerrillas are the most
 likely culprits.
 14 September             Saudi Arabia: Truck attempts to crash into industrial pipeline in Jubail. The
 truck stopped short of its target and authorities arrested four Lebanese Shia and
 the Filipino driver.
 24 September             Japan: Homemade rockets fired at Narita Airport. Four of the five truck-mounted
 projectiles were launched successfully, but caused no injuries or damage. An
 anonymous caller later claimed credit in the name of the Revolutionary Workers
 Party Hazama Faction, but truck mounted flame and rocket launchers have been
 the trademarks of another group, Chukaku-ha (Nucleus Faction).
 25 September             Italy: Bomb explodes in British Airways office in Rome, injuring 15 persons. An
 Arab arrested fleeing the scene later claimed to be a member of the Revolutionary
 Organization of Socialist Muslims. He has been identified as the man who threw a
 grenade at the Jordanian airline office in Athens last March.
 Late September           West Bank: Israeli authorities arrest eight members of Fatah terrorist cell in
 Bethlehem area. The group reportedly was responsible for two previous West Bank
