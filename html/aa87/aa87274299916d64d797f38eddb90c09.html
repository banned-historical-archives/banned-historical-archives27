IRAN-IRAQ 
The Iraqi ground and air offensive 
that began last month has dealt a seri-
ous blow to the rebel Kurdish forces, 
but deep penetrations into Kurdish-held 
territory by the Iraqi army have prompted 
increased intervention by Iran. 
Iraq has now committed over half its army, 
some 50,000 men, to the campaign against the Kurds. 
This force has made progress toward its two major 
objectives: splitting the Kurdish forces so that 
they can be dealt with piecemeal, and cutting off 
supplies from Iran. 
Last month, the Iraqis drove a wedge between 
Kurdish units in the north and those in the north-
east. As part of their strategy to establish a 
fortified line parallel to the Iranian border, the 
Iraqis also cut a main supply route from Iran. 
The Kurds' strategy has been to stage delaying 
actions along the front, while maintaining harass-
ing attacks in the rear of the main battle areas.  
25X1 
 //If the Kurdish military posi-
tion continues to deteriorate, however, they will 
require not only more arms from Iran but also 
greater direct support by Iranian forces. 
The main Iranian supply point now has been 
moved to Piran Shahr, some ten miles inside Iran.. . 
Two villages nearTiran Shahr were struck yesterday 
by Iraqi SU-r7 fighter-bombers. Press reports from 
Tehran claim that 15 people .were killed. The air 
attack probably was not just an attempt to disrupt 
Kurdish supply lines but also a warning to Iran. 
Tehran has submitted a complaint to the UN 
Security Council about this and other similar in-
cidents and may even make some military response. 
After some border incidents last month, the Shah 
ordered his troops to retaliate for any. Iraqi vio-
lation of Iranian territory.

CHINA 
Press reports from Peking Thursday 
night alleging a sudden downturn in the 
health of Chou En-Zai were exaggerated 
because they were based largely on inac-
curate information. Vice Premier Teng 
Hsiao-ping did tell the visiting US del-
egation, however, that the Premier's con-
dition has deteriorated since last July, 
when Chou received Senator Jackson in a 
hospital room. 
Teng has been standing in for Chou over the 
last few months, and there is little reason to doubt 
his statement on the Premier's health. Chou has 
been out of public view for five weeks. On Wednes-
day, he was absent for the first time from a meeting 
between Mao Tse-tung and a visiting head of state 
(in Wednesday's case, the President of Togo). 
Although they are not trying to conceal Chou's 
illness, Chinese officials seem anxious to avoid 
alarming the populace over the Premier's condition. 
Earlier this week the official party newspaper 
carried a message from the Togolese President wish-
ing Chou a speedy recovery. In addition, the media 
have carried a number of messages, signed by Chou, 
to foreign governments; this seems to be part of an 
effort to convey the impression that the Premier is 
still functioning.

CYPRUS 
Greek Cypriot leader Clerides report-
edly believes that conditions are nearly 
ripe for him to enter into political talks 
and that the Greek government will support 
most of his conditions for negotiation. 
Clerides is said to be prepared to agree 
to the Turkish demand for a federated state, 
provided the Turks: 
--Pull back from a section of Famagusta and per-
mit Greek Cypriot refugees to return there. 
--Withdraw from some of the other territory they 
now hold and agree that the final boundary is 
negotiable. 
7-Withdraw a portion of their mainland troops 
now and announce their intent to consider addi-
tional troop withdrawals later. 
derides met yesterday with the Turkish Cypriot 
leader, Rauf Denktash, and the two set up arrange-
ments for the relief of prisoners and detainees on 
both sides. Priority will be given to the sick and 
wounded, as well as to those under 18 years of age 
and those over 50. The two leaders also agreed to 
exchange lists of missing persons and attempt to 
trace them. In compliance with .the Geneva convention, 
they agreed to forward lists of prisoners and.de-
tainees to the International Red Cross. 
According to the US embassy in Nicosia, senior 
UN officials.are.hopeful that-Clerides and Denktah. 
will begin to examine political questions after agree-
ing on humanitarian and relief matters. If repre-
sentatives of Greece and Turkey can be brought .into_ 
the talks at that stage, UN officials. .hope that it 
may be possible .within a month to formulate the out-
lines of an overall solution, which could then be . 
ratified at a reconvened Geneva conference. 
The agreements on humanitarian problems came 
after a comprehensive.survey,of conditions on the 
island compiled by representatives of the Red Cross. 
The report concludes that the Turks have failed to 
meet even the minimum requirements of the Geneva.con-
vention. It notes that the 20,000-25,000 Greek 
?Cypriots in Turkish-controlled areas have almost no 
freedom of movement and lack food and medical atten-
tion. Most of the 35,000-40,000 Turkish Cypriots in 
predominatly Greek areas were found to be leading 
reasonably normal lives.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
SOUTH VIETNAM 
Battlefield action has lessened 
throughout the country during the past 
few days, but substantial fighting prob-
ably still lies ahead in September. 
The focus of Communist attacks remains in the 
northern provinces where North Vietnamese troops are 
concentrating on government positions south of Hue. 
Although this area has been the scene of repeated 
and somewhat inconclusive combat since last spring, 
the government commander in Military Region 1 is 
concerned that the North Vietnamese may try to make 
a major push toward Hue. He has brought up addi-
tional forces from Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces 
as a reserve. 
The communists may have sought to force just 
such a shift of government forces. The government 
units involved in the shift had been on operations 
designed to recover ground lost earlier to the enemy 
in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. With their logistic 
position substantially improved since the cease-
fire, the communists may attempt such whipsaw efforts 
against the government with greater frequency and 
impact. 
To the South  
North and west of Saigon, a new round of com-
munist attacks is still expected in September after 
the completion of current communist supply opera-
tions and troop repositioning. Government positions 
near Tay Ninh City and northwest of Bien Hoa City  
are likely targets.( 
The communist strategy in the Tay Ninh area 
appears to be to gain new footholds relatively close 
to the city and along the key logistic routes from 
Saigon. The communists would then be in a position 
during their next military campaign to bring sub-
stantial pressure on the relatively populous areas 
that lie near the roads, extending through Tay Ninh 
Province.

The Weather Factor 
As always in Vietnam the weather is an impor-
tant factor in determining both the level and aoca-, 
tion of military action. Heavy rains .are under way
in the central highlands and will start soon along 
the northern coast. On the coast, this period ini-
tially favors the communists because the cloudy 
conditions hamper government air operations but do 
not deter ground action until the rains intensify. 
In the southern half of the country, where weather 
conditions will soon begin to favor air operations 
and troop movements, the government's capabilities 
will gradually improve.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
OAS 
Early removal of OAS sanctions against 
Cuba, probably at an inter-American for-
eign ministers meeting at Quito on Novem-
ber 11, is foreseen by Latin American gov-
ernments on both sides of the issue. 
Panama's recent resumption of relations with 
Cuba brought to seven the number of OAS members 
that now have diplomatic ties with Cuba. This de-
fiance of the Rio Treaty, under which the sanctions 
were imposed, has heightened concern for the con-
tinued integrity and effectiveness of the OAS. 
Even governments still hostile to the Castro regime 
now believe continuation of the sanctions policy 
could destroy the OAS. 
A contributing factor is the widespread Latin 
sensitivity about outside interference in matters 
of national policy, which leaves the anti-Castro 
forces somewhat chagrined at obstructing sister 
republics that want to open the door to Cuba. Gov-
ernmental changes in Washington, moreover, have 
increased concern that the US will alter its Cuban 
policy and leave the anti-Castro governments dip-
lomatically isolated. 
The sponsors of the resolution to review the 
sanctions policy have been careful to couch it in 
terms of a changed world situation and a spirit 
of detente. They recognize a continuing difference 
of opinion within the OAS regarding the Cuban sub-
versive threat. For this reason, as well as to 
avoid provoking Castro, they hope to refrain from 
any discussion of whether Havana is continuing to 
export revolution. Using the co-existence argu-
ment, the sponsors are confident that they can 
secure the necessary two-thirds majority vote of 
the 23 members. They expect that a number of the 
governments once constituting a blocking one third 
plus one (Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, and the US) will now abstain. 
The Castro regime sees no benefit in a reacti-
vation of its suspended OAS membership and, despite 
Castro's stated interest in reconciliation with the 
US, the Cubans want no part of the OAS. They reject 
it as a tool of the US for dictating to Latin Amer-
ica and will continue to work toward its destruction. 
They would prefer to secure further diplomatic rec-
ognition in defiance of standing OAS sanctions and 
thus weaken the organization.

ARAB OIL PRODUCERS 
An oil transport company owned jointly 
by the Arab oil producing nations is re-
portedly requesting bids on six new tankers 
worth about $165 million. These ships will 
further efforts of the oil producers to 
become more involved in the total range of 
oil-related business and industry. 
By the end of the decade, the transport company 
plans to acquire a 10-million-ton fleet, costing 
about $2 billion. This fleet together with the pro-
spective national fleets of the Arab countries would 
total about 20 million tons. The ships would be able 
to carry about 2 million barrels per day on the Per-
sian Gulf - Rotterdam route. 
For purposes of comparison, the world tanker 
fleet by the end of the decade probably will exceed 
400 million tons. Arab oil production in the early 
1980s could range between 15 and 25 million barrels 
per day.

ZAIRE-PORTUGAL-ANGOLA 
A meeting between Zairian President 
Mobutu and Portuguese President Spinola 
that was postponed late last month is now 
? set to take place in the Cape Verde Is-
lands on September 14. 
The Portuguese ambassador to the UN is "vir-
tually certain" that the meeting will be attended 
by Holden Roberto, leader of the Zairian-based Na-
tional Front for the Liberation of Angola, and by 
the leader of the smallest of the three Angolan 
nationalist organizations. According to the ambas-
sador, the Portuguese hope to persuade the other 
major rebel group, the Popular Movement for the Lib-
eration of Angola, to attend the meeting. 
The Angolan liberation movements are long-stand-
ing and bitter rivals, and in recent years have been 
seriously weakened by organizational problems of in-
ternal feuding. The Portuguese apparently hope that 
Mobutu can influence them to reconcile their differ-
ences and negotiate for the territory's independence. 
Mobutu, a principal supporter of Angolan liberation, 
is determined that an independent Angola be governed 
by leaders friendly to Zaire. He will attempt to 
convince the Portuguese that Holden Roberto is the 
dominant nationalist figure in Angola.

SOUTH KOREA - JAPAN 
The  raid yesterday 
morning on the Japanese embassy in Seoul by 
a group of South Korean youths and a large 
demonstration there today are only the most 
dramatic of a series of developments that 
have intensified strains between the two 
countries. 
Japanese Foreign Minister Kimura's initial re-
sponse to the attempted assassination of President 
Pak on August 15 was viewed in Seoul as unsympathetic. 
Over the past week, Kimura has become the focus of 
South Korean anger because of other statements which 
Seoul believes cast doubt on Japan's commitment to 
the security of South Korea and, more important, on 
the continuing primacy of the South in Japan's policy 
toward the two Koreas. 
Seoul is pressing hard for redress from Japan 
in the form of public statements and diplomatic ac-
tions, including an expression of policy from Prime 
Minister Tanaka himself before he leaves late next 
week to visit Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the US, 
where he will meet with you on September 21. 
Further Strains in the Offing  
A Japanese Socialist Party delegation which ar-
rived in Pyongyang on September 5 can be expected to 
provide loud support for the North Korean cause. 
There is also an anti-Pak campaign under way in Japan 
which is pointed toward a massive leftist rally in 
Tokyo on September 19. The South Koreans will find 
still further fault with Japan on October 2 when a 
high-level North Korean delegation arrives for a 
meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the first 
time North Korea has participated in the work of that 
body.

IRAQ, IRAN, AND THE KURDS 
Although Iraqi forces have made gains 
over recent weeks, Baghdad will probably 
not be able to destroy Kurdish forces be-
fore late October, when bad weather will 
ground Iraqi aircraft and halt mechanized 
military operations. The Kurds' ability 
to withstand the Iraqi drive hinges in 
large part on the Shah's willingness to 
do whatever is necessary to keep the dis-
sident movement alive. If the Kurds' mil-
itary position continues to deteriorate, 
they will require not only stepped-up de-
liveries of arms from Iran, but possibly 
more direct involvement by Iranian forces. 
Despite the recent setbacks, Kurdish morale 
appears good. There are more volunteers ready to 
join the Kurds than there are weapons to supply 
them. Reports from Kurdistan indicate that the 
rebels are more unified than ever; large numbers 
of educated Kurds, who in the past have been cool 
to Barzani's conservative leadership, are now re-
ported to be joining rebel forces. 
Later this year the Kurds may be able to re-
take some of the positions they have lost recently, 
but they will need more equipment in order to hold 
them next summer. Even with poor equipment, the 
Kurds are likely to fight on. They fought the last 
war against the Iraqis in 1970 despite severe sup-
ply deficiencies. 
The Iranian Role  
For some time Iran has provided the Kurds with 
equipment, munitions, and military advisers. It 
also provides food, medicine, and money, and main-
tains refugee camps for Kurds who flee the fighting. 
Tehran admits only to providing humanitarian aid. 
According to the Iranians, the current fighting 
has pushed the refugee total over 70,000. 
Iraq's recent successes have prompted the 
Kurds to ask for increased support, and Tehran has 
made a positive but limited response. Iranian army 
and gendarmerie units along  the border have been 
reinforced/ and used in show-of-
force maneuvers\

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Of greater significance, however, was the move-
ment last month of Iranian artillery to the border 
where, for the first time, it was used to support 
a Kurdish counterattack against Iraqi armor in the  
Qalat Dizah area.  
The Shah's Options  
Unless the Shah reverses himself, the likeli-
hood of direct clashes between Iraq and Iran in-
creases as Baghdad's troops push closer to the bor-
der. The Shah might deepen Iran's involvement if 
he concludes that this is the only alternative to a 
crushing defeat of the Kurds. The use of Iranian 
artillery represents a step in that direction and 
shows that the Shah considers continued Kurdish re-
sistance important enough to justify a more direct 
Iranian role. The Iranians, of course, will do their 
best to ensure that this military aid remains un-
provable in international forums. 
Barring a sudden collapse of the Kurdish re-
sistance, Iran's most likely course is to intensify 
what it is already doing. It could increase artil-
lery support from Iranian territory, provide heavier 
and more sophisticated weapons, and even stage diver-
sionary border incidents farther south to draw off 
Iraqi forces. Border violations such as the Iraqi 
bombing yesterday of two Iranian villages near Piran 
Shahr--the main supply depot for the Kurds--could be 
used by Tehran to justify launching a limited mili-
tary action along the border. The Shah might also 
agree to send more Iranian personnel in mufti to 
help the Kurds. 
Open intervention by Iranian ground forces seems 
unlikely. This would force Arab governments, recently 
courted by Iran, to choose between it and Iraq--a 
fellow Arab state. It also would undermine Iran's 
efforts to strengthen ties with neighbors who al-
ready are apprehensive about its growing military 
power. 
Bilateral Relations  
The Shah believes his interests are well served 
by Baghdad's preoccupation with the Kurdish problem 
and by Iraq's isolation in the Arab world. He there-
fore wishes to keep Kurdish resistance alive, and 
shows little interest in a rapprochement with Iraq, 
with whom he has long been at odds.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The Iranians believe the greatest threat to 
their goals in the Persian Gulf is the growth of 
radicalism, and Iraq is seen as its chief sponsor. 
The Kurdish rebellion puts domestic political strains 
on the Baghdad regime, drains resources, and inhibits 
Iraqi efforts to sponsor subversion against the Shah 
and other traditional Gulf rulers. 
Iraq, on the other hand, is under pressure from 
several Arab countries to seek an accommodation with 
Iran as a prerequisite for resolving the Kurdish 
problem. Moreover, domestic political divisions have 
been deepened as a result of the current fighting 
and threaten the stability of the Iraqi regime. 
There have been some signs over recent months 
that the Iraqis were seeking rapprochement with Iran. 
Baghdad took the lead, for example, in starting pre-
liminary bilateral talks on a range of outstanding 
issues, including border demarcation, in Istanbul 
last month. After two weeks, however, the meetings 
ended with not much sign of progress. 
Baghdad's View' 
We do not know whether the Iraqi air strike near 
Piran Shahr signals a radical change in Baghdad's 
policy. The bombing was apparently intended in part 
as a warning to the Shah against stepping up deliver-
ies of military equipment to the Kurds and against 
increased involvement of the Iranian army on the 
?side of the rebels. The strikes indicate that the 
Iraqis are probably prepared to use air power against 
Iranian artillery, mortar and anti-tank units along 
the border suspected by Baghdad of having given fire 
support to the Kurds. 
The Iraqis are aware of the risks incurred in 
carrying out air strikes against Iranian territory. 
With a large part of their ground forces tied down 
against the Kurds, the Iraqis are not able to engage 
in major ground actions against Iran. Hence, Baghdad 
will seek to avoid an outright military confrontation. 
Implications for Iraq  
The unending war with the Kurds could become an 
increasingly onerous political liability for the re-
gime. If the army gets bogged down later this year, 
political infighting could grow in Baghdad. There 
could be an open power struggle at the top between 
President Bakr and Baath Party strongman Tikriti, 
who have been at odds for some time. Other possibil-
ities include a move against the two leaders by Baath

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Party critics with army support, or an independent 
move by the army. In the past two months, there have 
been signs of increasing military dissatisfaction 
with the prolonged, inconclusive war. 
Tikriti put his reputation on the line when the 
fighting began in March by promising the Baath Party 
that the war would be over in September, but his 
position remains strong. He controls the party secu-
rity apparatus, which gives him early warning of po-
tential troublemakers both within the party and the 
army. 
Even if the Iraqi regime were overthrown, there 
probably would be no sudden shifts in domestic or 
foreign policy--except perhaps for the handling of 
the Kurdish question. The Iraqis are so heavily 
dependent on the Soviet Union for deliveries of 
sophisticated weaponry that any regime that takes 
power is unlikely to loosen ties with Moscow. 
Soviet Stakes 
Moscow's interest in protecting and improving 
its position in Iraq has led it to become deeply in-
volved in supporting Baghdad against the Kurds, de-
spite significant misgivings about Iraqi policy. 
Soviet military assistance and advice have played a 
major role in the successes the Iraqi military has  
achieved. r 
_// During the past ten days, Soviet air 
transports have apparently delivered sorely needed 
arms to Iraq. 
The Soviets are concerned that Iranian involve-
ment will lead to increased Iraqi demands for support, 
and eventually endanger Soviet-Iranian relations. 
Soviet support for Iraq has impeded Moscow's attempts 
to improve ties to Tehran.
