 The doming Crisis in
 Size-Up by Top. Government Analysts
 A crunch in Russia in the early '80s ... pressure on
 oil supplies if Mideast peace negotiations falter ...
 no end to Chinese-Soviet conflict.
 These are among the principal conclusions that
 emerge from In-depth interviews with a body of
 Administration specialists whose job it Is to analyze
 the vast flow of information pouring Into Washington
 from trouble spots around the world.
 The assessments of these specialists daily go to
 President Carter and his principal advisers as the
 basis for foreign-policy decisions.
 A team of the magazine's editors questioned the
 analysts on the most critical international Issues
 facing the U.S. today. What follows are their views
 on a wide! range of international problems that are of
 direct concern to Americans.
 Where is the Soviet Union heading now-into a crisis or a
 time of greater stability?
 If our projections are right and if actuarial tables can be
 relied upon, two developments are likely to coincide in the
 Soviet Union in the first half of the 1980s: an energy and
 economic crunch and an overhaul of the top leadership.
 You now have a kind of gold-watch leadership-a leader-
 ship at the end of its tenure. It has not had a record
 distinguished by innovation in domestic policy. And it is not
 one that you would expect to produce radical reforms to
 ameliorate acute problems shaping up in five or six years.
 We discern no evidence that the Soviets are beginning to
 undertake the costly measures-political and economic-
 that. are needed to cope with the crunch we see coming up in
 the early '80s-for example, in energy. Now, it may be that
 the leadership has long been aware of what lies ahead and
 has a certain confidence that the country can muddle
 through-that they will be able to get through this rough
 period ahead with measures that are not highly disruptive.
 Another possibility is that we see things that they do not
 yet see clearly. If that is true, then there is a much greater
 potential for radical changes in Soviet policy. That is why we
 are watching as carefully as we can for evidence of how the
 Soviets perceive their economic situation in the early '80s. It
 is terribly important in analyzing what to expect when the
 crunch comes.
 A worst-case scenario goes like this: The leadership in
 power today is unwilling or unable to take the long, lead-
 time measures to cope with the economic situation that we
 see coming up in the early '80s. Then the succession occurs,
 with none of the necessary hard decisions having been made.
 The succession brings into power a leadership that may
 have a better appreciation of the problem but is even less
 capable of dealing with it because it is preoccupied for five
 years sorting themselves out and establishing who has the
 real clout. In that situation, you could expect a very sharp
 struggle over the allocation of resources and immobilism
 when it comes to introducing major reforms in the Soviet
 system to cope with their economic problems. That is the
 worst case from the Soviet viewpoint.
 What's the basis of the projection of an economic crunch
 Already, economic growth is slowing down markedly. In
 the '60s, Soviet growth averaged 5 per cent if you use
 Western concepts of national income. In the first half of the
 '70s, growth averaged 4.9 per cent, and this year we expect
 less than 3'/a per cent. We expect the slowdown to continue
 In the past, the problem could be attributed to agriculture,
 which caused cyclical swings. The leadership could blame
 the weather. You recall how, when there was a bad harvest
 ,
 Khrushchev complained that "God has done it to us again."
 But now a lot of underlying, long-range trends are catching
 up with the Soviets that have nothing to do with weather,

 What are these adverse long-range trends?
 prediction that Soviet oil production will start declin nn
 etween now an the early 1980s. Today, the Soviet Union is
 a net exporter, delivering 1.1 million barrels daily to Eastern
 Europe-at well below the world market price-and another
 300,000 barrels to other Communist countries. Exports to
 Eastern Europe are supposed to increase to 1.6 million
 barrels by 1980.
 If you take our middle projection of Soviet oil production
 between now and 1985-neither the most optimistic nor the
 most pessimistic-then Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
 together will be in the market for 2.7 million barrels daily.
 Aside from footing the greatly increased bill for oil imports
 on that scale, they have three options. One is to mount a
 typical, all-out Bolshevik-fashion campaign, which might
 enable them to achieve 5 per cent conservation while
 maintaining economic growth at the assumed rate of 3 to 4
 per cent. A second option is to let the economic growth rate
 drop to 2'/a or even 2 per cent while pushing for coal,
 nuclear energy and other oil substitutes.  .

 won't kick in. That's one anecdote. We just see the tip of the
 iceberg in this area.
 What is your assessment of Moscow's attitude toward
 Euro-Communism? Do the Soviets see this movement as an
 asset or a liability?
 It's a real dilemma for them. They're pulled in several
 directions simultaneously, and that's not a sham.
 They welcome in a general way a leftist tendency in
 Western Europe because it has some potential long-term
 payoffs for the Soviets. But, on the other hand, they are
 dealing with heterodox Communist parties, and the degree
 of control that they will be able to exercise over these parties
 is uncertain at best.
 Also uncertain is the impact on foreign policy-say, in
 France-of a left coalition running French affairs. After all,
 the Soviets have done fairly well in dealing with anti-
 Communist French governments since De Gaulle. There are
 rumors that they would prefer to have Giscard d'Estaing
 returned to power rather than see a victory for the Union of
 the Left, including the Communists. That might have an
 additional side benefit of teaching the French Communist
 Party a lesson about defying Moscow.
 Furthermore, the Soviets obviously are im-
 pressed by the fact that Euro-Communism has
 certain infectious potential for Eastern Europe
 and perhaps even for the Soviet Union in the
 long run.
 In other words, the Soviets are truly and
 genuinely ambivalent about Euro-Communism.
 i  ?-uumng to the Mideast: Is Egyptian President
 Sadat's dramatic bid for a peace settlement with
 'Israel in part a result of Arab military weakness?
 Basically the military balance is very much in
 Israel's favor and likely to remain so at least
 over the next five years. This is due to a
 combination of two factors.
 First is the tremendous improvement in Isra-
 el's military capabilities since the 1973 war,
 partly as a result of the receipt of massive
 amounts of U.S. equipment, including sophisti-
 cated weapons. In addition, Israel has expanded
 of equipment, but basically these are going into storage.
 Practical logistical difficulties make it doubtful that those
 stocks could be made available to the confrontation states in
 a timely fashion. Also, Libya's dispute with Egypt has re-
 duced the likelihood, in the near term at least, that she
 would be much disposed to assist the Egyptians.
 It would be a mistake to assume that all of this means that
 the Arabs have no military options. As in '73, they have the
 capability to initiate a new war in the hope that they would
 impose heavy losses on Israel and that pressures of the
 international community would bring the hostilities to a
 quick end before the Arabs were defeated. They would hope
 that they would achieve benefits in the ensuing negotiating
 process.
 Is either side in this conflict likely to resort to nuclear war
 in the foreseeable future?
 Given the Israelis' current military capability, there should
 be no impulse or need for them to move to the use of nuclear
 weapons.
 Israel should be able to win the next war in a relatively
 short period of time-although in the end that will depend
 on the fortunes of battle. If for some reason the Israelis were
 not achieving as quick or clean a victory as they would like,
 the pressure on them would not be so much to look for
 nuclear weapons. Rather, they would have to decide wheth-

 In the case of Syria, the involvement in Lebanon has had a
 major impact on her military capabilities. Syria's posture in
 the Golan Heights is the weakest since 73 because about a
 quarter of her combat-maneuver brigades are committed to
 Lebanon.
 Saudi Arabia has never been a major military factor, nor
 has Jordan, for that matter. Iraqis the one Arab state that has
 made major--in.deed, impressive-improvements in military
 capabilities since '73. The forces that Iraq could dispatch to
 the Golan Heights in the event of renewed hostilities would
 be significantly larger than they were in the last war but still
 not enough to reverse Israeli military superiority.
 Libya, of course, has been busily accumulating huge stocks weapons, economic support and diplomatic support. Tryinfr

 But it is misleading to pose the question in terns of overt
 pressure being brought to bear on Israel. The fact is that any
 Israeli leader would have to look down the road and ask
 whether the course he was pursuing was going to alienate

 Soviet Union or the U.S. But we see no amelioration of the
 Sino-Soviet conflict when it comes to the larger issues, such
 as the territorial questions and border confrontations. We
 don't find anybody who sees a reconciliation in the offing.
 Will the Chinese be pushed closer to the Soviets by failure
 of the U.S. to resolve the Taiwan issue and normalize
 relations with Peking?
 That question should be considered in terms of the Chi-
 nese perception of the United States. To them, our position
 in the world as an offset to the Soviet Union is much more
 important than their interpretation of movement on the
 Taiwan issue.
