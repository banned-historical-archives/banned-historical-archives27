Foreword 
What is commonly referred to as the Indonesian 
coup is more properly called "The 30 September Movement," 
the name the conspirators themselves gave their movement. 
In this paper, the term "Indonesian coup" is used inter-
changeably with "The 30 September Movement," mainly for 
the sake of variety. It is technically correct to refer 
to the events in Indonesia as a "coup" in the literal 
sense of the word, meaning "a sudden, forceful stroke in 
politics." To the extent that the word has been accepted 
in common usage to mean "the sudden and forcible overthrow 
of the government," however, it may be misleading. For 
it now seems clear that the Indonesian coup was not a move 
to overthrow Sukarno and/or the established government of 
Indonesia. Essentially, it was a purge of the Army lead-
ership, which was intended to bring about certain changes 
in the composition-of the cabinet. In this sense, it is 
more correct to refer to the 30 September Movement as a 
purge, rather than a coup. 
A word should also be said about the organization 
of the paper. It is divided into four main sections. 
The first one treats the actual events of the coup ondl 
October; the second one traces the movements of the key 
figures in the coup up to the time of their capture or, 
in the case of Sukarno, up to March 1966, when he lost 
de facto control of the government to Gen. Suharto, who 
assumed full responsibility for restoring law and order; 
the third one discusses the planning for the coup that 
vos done in the one month of September 1965; and the last 
one, perhaps the most important one, reviews the events 
leading up to the coup, including the decision to stage 
the coup. 
This organization was chosen for several reasons. 
First of all, there was the consideration of the evidence 
itself. For the most part, the matters that are discussed 
in the first two sections are matters of established fact; 
in other words, they are part of the record against which 
we must examine the words and testimony of the various 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
-individuals who were involved in the coup. Our knowledge 
of the conspiracy behind the events, which is the subject 
of the third section of the paper, comes entirely from 
�the interrogation of the people involved in the conspiracy. 
Naturally, this kind of evidence must be considered in a 
slightly different light than the evidence that is pre-
sented in the first two sections. The reader is in a 
better position to make his own judgment, based on the 
evidence, if he has a clear understanding of the kind of 
evidence that is involved. 
The matters that are discussed in the fourth section 
are much more matters of judgment. The coup can only be 
understood, of course, against the background of Indonesian 
politics in 1965. Many of the events that form that back-
ground are open to varying interpretation, however. Again, 
the reader is in a better position to evaluate those events 
if he can view them from the vantage point of hindsight, 
as it were, with the events of the coup clearly drawn in 
his mind. The one difficulty with the arrangement of the 
paper, with the events of the coup at the beginning, is 
the possibility of its creating the false impression that 
the coup was a distinct occurrence, which can be treated 
apart from the rest of the Indonesian political scene. 4 
Of course, it can not. It should be viewed as the culmina-
tion of many events over the.years. 
There has been a deliberate effort in telling the 
story of the coup to present the evidence in as straight-
forward a manner as possible, to let the facts speak for 
themselves. The purpose of this has been to allow the 
reader to make his own conclusions as he goes along. A 
final section at the end of the paper summarizes the con-
clusions of the author. 
All the events that are discussed in the paper, 
including the events of the coup itself and the major 
events leading up to the coup, are presented in chrono-
logical order in the Chronology of Events. Also included 
in the Appendix is a brief-discussion of the validity of 
the Army interrogation reports as evidence.

Preface 
On 14 September 1965 Indonesian Army Intelligence, 
of which General Parman was the chief, presented a detailed 
report on the internal security situation to the Army Chief 
of Staff, General Yani. The report summarized all informa-
tion known about the activities of the Indonesian Communist 
Party (PKI) as of that date. In particular, it mentioned a 
report of a plan to assassinate the army's top leadership, 
giving a list of the Army generals who were to be killed. 
In conclusion, it stated the Army Intelligence judgment that 
"something was going to happen." 
At first, General Parman had been reluctant to 
accept the judgment of his staff. He was more conserva-
tive on the question; in the end, however, he agreed to 
take the case to General Yani. Yani, in turn, pretented 
the report to President Sukarno, laying particular stress 
on the "assassination list," which included the names 
of three generals--Suharto, Mursjid, and Sukenulo--in 
addition to the seven generals who were later t be the 
target of the Indonesian coup of 30 September. 
The report mentioned September 18 as the date4of 
the planned attack, and, on that evening, the army took 
special security precautions; but nothing happened. After 
that, Yani apparently did not take the report seriously. 
and no special precautions were observed. 
Late in September the former military attache in 
Peking, Brig. Gen. Sudono, told Maj. Gen. M.T. Harjono, 
a subsequent victim of the coup, that he had learned that 
a number of Army generals would be abducted within a few 
days. Although General Harjono did not believe the in-
formation, he decided to call a staff meeting at Army 
headquarters on 30 September since General Sudono was so 
obviously in earnest. Apparently, PKI intelligence learned 
about this meeting but drew the wrong conclusions as to 
the subject under such high-level discussion. At the meet-
ing, General Sudono reportedly became "the butt of laughter" 
of everyone present.

Yet, within a matter of hours of the staff meeting 
at Army headquarters, exactly what General Sudono said 
he had heard would happen "within a few days" happened 
that very night. That the Army was totally unprepared 
for an attack from its political enemies was the most 
obvious feature of the Indonesian coup. In one night 
alone, the army was to suffer the staggering loss of 
six of its most senior generals. Never before, in any 
of the great wars, have six generals been lost in a single 
night.

The Coup 
At approximately 0400 hours on the morning of 1 
October 1965 the leaders of the 30 September Movement 
launched their surprise attack on the Army leadership in 
the form of simultaneous raids on the homes of seven gen-
erals. In a matter of hours, the military action in-
volved in the coup was over; besides the raids, it in-
volved only the securing of a few vital objectives--the 
Presidential Palace in Djakarta, the radio station of 
Radio Indonesia, the central telecommunications build-
ing, and an airbase just outside Djakarta. These purely 
military aspects of the coup are by now fairly clear. Thus, 
in beginning with a reconstruction-of the military opera-
tion of the coup itself, we can establish certain neces-
sary facts about the coup before discussing what we do 
and do not know for sure about the planning of thek,coup. 
The Kidnapping of the Generals 
The staging ground for the attack was an abandoned 
rubber plantation that was within the confines of Lubang 
Buaja, a small village or hamlet on the outskirts of Halim 
Air Force Base, about seven miles from the Presidential 
Palace in Djakarta. Reached by another road than the main 
approach to the airbase, Lubang Buaja was a remote area 
that could easily be sealed off for purposes of security.* 
*In the tightly structured organization of local govern-
ment in Indonesia, Lubang Buaja is properly referred to 
as a Kompung or "hamlet," which is smaller than a "village" 
or "town" or "city." It is the lowest level of local gov-
ernment in Indonesia. Usually, a Kompung is set apart 
by a fence that encloses the whole area of the Kompung. 
In the case of Lubang Buaja, the only road into the Kom-
pung runs parallel to the road into Halim Air Force Base 
from the main Bogor-Djakarta Highway. A security guard 
on this road can guarantee the security of the whole area. 
(See map of "Djakarta and Vicinity.") The literal meaning 
of the name "Lubang Buaja" is "Crocodile's Hole," which 
suggests that the area was once a swamp land.

Early on the morning of 1 October, at about 0400 
hours while it was still dark, some 10-15 trucks and 
buses left Lubang Buaja and began a 30-minute drive into 
Djakarta. The assortment of vehicles--all of which be-
longed to the Air Force--carried 4 fully-armed companies 
of troops: one company from the special Tjakrabirawa 
Palace Guard that guarded President Sukarno, one company 
from the 454th battalion of Central Java, one company 
from the 530th battalion of East Java, and one company 
of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Territorial Command. 
In view of the persistent belief that some civilians, 
namely Communist party members and sympathizers, particip-
ated in the kidnapping raids on the generals' homes, it 
1-iou1d be 'emphasized that only regular military officers 
and men wearing army uniforms, were actually involved. 
The troops were under the command of Marine Lt. Dul Arief, 
a direct subordinate of Col. Untung, one of the three 
battalion Commanders of the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard 
and the chosen leader for the coup. 
As it neared the residential area in which the top 
Army leaders lived, the caravan of trucks broke up into 
seven separate raiding parties destined for seven differ-
ent targets, the homes of seven of the Army's senior gen-
erals.* A force of one fully-armed platoon was assigned' 
to handle each of the following five generals: General 
Suprapto, General Harjono, General Parman, General Pand-
jaitan, and General Sutojo. Special forces of one fully-
armed company each were assigned to the homes of Minister/ 
Coordinator of Defense Nasution and Army Minister/Commander 
Yani, respectively. Contrary to widespread belief, the 
*All of the generals except Gen. Pandjaitan lived in 
an elite residential section of Djakarta called Menteng. 
Before the caravan of trucks reached this section of town, 
one or two of the trucks must have turned off in the 
direction of Kebajoran, where Gen. Pandjaitan lived. As 
they approached the Menteng area, the others broke up 
into six separate raiding parties destined for the homes 
of the six other Army generals.

coup leaders had not included General Suharto, a former 
commander of the Central Java Territorial Division (the 
Diponegoro Division) and the then chief of the army's 
strategic reserve force (KOSTRAD), with headquarters in 
Djakarta, in the list of generals to be eliminated as 
the top leadership of the army. The error of not seizing 
Suharto, known as a strong and capable officer but ob-
viously underestimated and not foreseen to be the man 
who would quickly and effectively take command of the 
situation in the crisis hours of the coup was certainly 
a major error of the coup planners. It was an e:ror in 
the planning of the coup, not in its execution. Euharto 
did not escape from would-be kidnappers, as did Nasution. 
No effort was ever made to capture him. 
At the various target homes, the attacking parties 
followed the same general tactics. One-third of the 
force stood guard on the streets around the house, tone-
third surrounded the house itself, and one-third entered 
the house to bring out the victim. A member of the Tjak-
rabirawa Palace Guard told each general that he was 
wanted by Sukarno at the Palace immediately. It is clear 
from the reports of the kidnapping oi Harjono and Pandjai7an, 
that they. at least, suspected that they were being ar-
rested on orders of the Palace. Harjono even went soi 
far as to cry out that he was about to be. murdered. When 
he resisted further, he was, in fact, the first general 
shot that morning. A little later, General Pandjaitan 
was also shot and killed resisting capture. Generals 
Suprapto, Sutojo, and Parman, quickly overpowered, blind-
folded, with their hands tied behind their barks, were 
forcibly pushed into the waiting trucks and rushed back 
to Lubang Buaja.* 
Meanwhile, the larger raiding parties were hand-
ling what was expected to be a more difficult assignment 
--the capture of Generals Yani and Nasution--whose homes

attacking troops managed to engage the guards in conver-
sation, telling them that they had an urgent message for 
Yani from the President. Seeing their Tjakrabirawa uni-
forms, the guards apparently suspected nothing until the 
invading group was near enough to overpower and disarm 
them. Yani himself does not seem to have doubted the 
story that Sukarno wanted to see him at once. He merely 
asked for time to bathe and dress. However, when he was 
told that there was not time for that, he apparently be-
came angry and struck one of the men. Thereupon, they 
opened fire on him. Like the others, his body was car-
ried out of the house, put aboard a truck, and taken back 
to Lubang Buaja. 
The attack on General Nasution's house was on the 
largest scale of all, altogether, about one hundred men 
were involved. That General Nasution--who was in tile 
house at the time--could have escaped from such an ambush, 
with 60-70 soldiers surrounding his home and another 20-
30 searching the house, seems almost unbelievable. It 
was one of those twists of fate that all but re-shape 
history. The one and only failure in the execution of 
the coup, it was to prove nothing less than a major 
disaster for the coup leaders. 4 
In part, it was due to mistaken identity. Awakened 
by the commotion outside, the Nasutions had quickly de-
termined that someone was trying to kidnap General Nasu-
tion. They locked the door to their first-floor bedroom 
and, while the troops outside were still struggling with 
the door, Mrs. Nasution quickly led her husband through 
the next room, down a corridor and out a side entrance 
near the wall adjoining the residence of the Iraqi Ambas-
sador. In Nasution's own words: 
I climbed the wall and from the top of the wall 
I first saw that my daughter Irma had been shot 
in the back. I was going to come back to face 
the soldiers that had done it, but my wife 
prevented me, imploring me to save myself.

It later was determined that my house was 
closely surrounded. The person guarding the 
wall was only a few meters away, but I was 
protected from his view by a dense growth 
of vegetation near the wall. At the moment 
I jumped from the wall I was fired at by the 
Tjakrabirawa troops who were guarding the 
side of the house, but...none of their bul-
lets struck me. I heard the men who were 
shooting say something like, 'Someone 
escaped at this side. He wasn't hit.' 
After jumping from the wall I hid behind a 
water barrel in the yard of the Iraqi ambas-
sador's house.* While hiding there I thought 
to myself, 'Why is the Tjakrabirawa staging 
this raid and trying to kill me? The Tjak-
rabirawa is the palace honor guard of the 
President. ...Perhaps the President has listened 
to slander and ordered the Tjakrabirawa troops 
*In jumping the wall between his house and that of 
the Iraqi ambassador next door, Nasution broke his ankle. 
To some degree, his broken ankle was probably responsible 
for his removal from the scene in the days immediately 
after the coup. Of course, the tragic death of his 
daughter as a result of the wounds she received during 
the raid on Nasution's home on the morning of 1 October 
was the main thing that preoccupied Nasution for weeks 
after the coup. The picture of Nasution hobbling around 
on crutches at the funeral of the slain generals on 5 
October and the funeral of his own daughter several days 
later will probably never be forgotten by most Indonesians.

to shoot me in my own house without a hear-
ing!' I knew that I repeatedly had been 
slandered in untrue reports received by the 
President. 
I thought of trying to get to the house of 
Deputy Prime Minister Leimena, which was 
nearby (across the street from the house 
where I was hiding). I believed that he 
would not betray me if I asked for help in 
contacting the President and asking why � 
the Palace had ordered the Tjakrabirawa 
troops to shoot me in my own house. I gave 
up this idea after considering that I would 
have to go out on Teuku Umar Street to 
reach Pak Leimena's house. I knew that the 
street certainly would be controlled by the 
Tjakrabirawa. I decided to remain hidden 
and wait for morning and the chance that 
help would come from my own troops. 
...Prior to the 1 October 1965 incident I 
had not received at my house, in either an 
official or unofficial capacity, reports 
or information that an incident of this 
type would occur...My escape was not due to 
any foreknowledge I had of the (coup) plans. 
It was due solely to the assistance and pro-
tection of Almighty God and the help of my 
wife that I escaped abduction and murder. 
t. 
Inside Nasution's house, confusion reigned. Clutch-
ing her bleeding child in her arms, Mrs. Nasution hurried 
to the telephone to call a doctor. A few moments later, 
she was not prevented from driving away from the house 
with her wounded daughter and a servant to the Army Hospi-
tal. Meanwhile, the soldiers continued to search the 
large house. By this time, Nasntion's adjutant, Lt. 
Pierre Tendean, a man of the same general build and ap-
pearance as Nasution, though much younger, had had time 
to put on his chief's uniform-jacket and cap. He went 
out to the front pavilion to meet the attackers. The 
detail commander said: "General Nasution?" Tendean

replied with a curt "Yes. What is it?" He was immedi-
ately overpowered and bundled into a truck, and the con-
voy set off for Lubang Buaja. It was just 5:00 a.m. 
There is one final detail about the kidnapping 
raids that should be clarified because of the persistent 
confusion on the point. It concerns the supposed attack 
on Deputy Prime Minister Leimena's house. When the raid-
ing party arrived at General Nasution's home, the troops 
first moved to disarm any armed guards (assigned to the 
homes of certain government officials) on the street. 
It so happened that Leimena's house, two doors down and 
across the street from Nasution's home, had a three-man 
guard in recognition of his status of Second Deputy Prime 
Minister. One of the guards came down the street and 
was shot by mistake. His was the only death other than 
those of the generals and Lt. Tendean to result from the 
coup action in Djakarta that day. No attempt was made 
to enter Leimena's-house or to trouble him further. The 
only objective was to prevent the guards at his house 
from coming to the rescue of Nasution. No doubt, because 
of the death of the policeman guarding Leimena's house 
the incident received immediate and perhaps greater at-
tention than some of the other raids on the generals' 
homes. It was assumed that Leimena had been a major 
target of the coup. In fact, the targets were the seven 
army generals; no one else. The killing of Leimena's 
guard was purely accidental. 
Suharto Takes Command of the Army 
Besides the heroism of Lt. Tendean in posing as 
General Nasution, thereby helping to save the life of 
his chief at the loss of his own, and the calm presence 
of mind of Mrs. Nasution in a crisis situation, it was 
the quick thinking of another member of the Nasution 
household that frustrated the coup plans for a fait 
accompli--the elimination of the top army leadership--

before the.army could react to the first staggering blow. 
Namdan, an aide of Nasution, contacted the Djakarta gar-
rison commander Major General Umar Wirahadikusumah, on 
the special KOTI communication system, sometime around 
0515 hours. General Umar went directly to Nasution's house, 
arriving there about 0530 hours; shortly thereafter, five 
tanks he had ordered also arrived. As the vehicles of 
the raiding party had been seen to at off in the direction 
of Bogor, General Umar ordered a pursuit by the tanks in 
tbat direction. The effort was not successful, however, 
as the tanks were unable to catch sight of any of the 
fleeing trucks or buses. 
Nasution, still in hiding next door in the yard 
of the Iraqi Ambassador's house, heard the commotion of 
the arrival of the men and tanks under General Umar, but 
uncertain as to who it was, he dared not come out of hid-
ing. Not until about 0630 hours when he saw Col, Hidajat 
Wirasondjaja, the commander of the headquarters detach-
ment of the Armed Forces Staff, near the wall did he ven-
ture to reveal himself to anyone. The colonel, one of 
Nasution's adjutants, and his brother-in-law accompanied 
Nasution, concealed on the floor of the car, to a safe 
place not far from KOSTRAD headquarters. 
.4 
General Suharto has given a detailed account of 
how he first learned about the raids that morning and 
what actions he took as the senior surviving general of 
the army (except for Nasution, whose whereabouts were 
still unknown). About 0530 hours, a neighbor of Suharto 
arrived at the General's home to inform him that shoot-
ing had been heard down the street. (Suharto was head 
of the neighborhood association that was concerned with 
law and order in the neighborhood; members were respon-
sible for reporting anything unusual that they saw or 
heard to the head of the association.) Shortly there-
after, Suharto received a message from General Umar that 
a number of Army generals had been abducted by unknown 
parties. There was no information of the fate of the 
generals, and it was incorrectly reported that Deputy 
Prime Minister Leimena had also been taken. 
-8-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Suharto did not hesitate. In his own words: 
I concluded that the leadership (of the Army) 
was paralyzed. I knew that without leader-
ship things would become even more confused. 
I was the senior officer in the Army after the 
Commander'.of the Army (Yani) and was ordinarily 
designated to represent him when he went 
abroad...I decided without hesitation that 
I would take over the leadership of the Army 
until something was learned of the fate of its 
commander. 
As my driver had not yet arrived, I drove a 
jeep to KOSTRAD headquarters myself, arriving 
there between 0630 and 0700 hours....Soon 
General Umar arrived and was able to provide 
clearer information as to what had happened... 
He said that he had gone to several of the 
generals' homes ' and then to the Palace but 
was unable to meet with the President. He 
did see General Supardjo at the Palace, how-
ever, which surprised me, since I dia not 
know he was in Djakarta.* 
I told General Umar that I was taking over 
the leadership of the Army; he agreed. I 
issued my first order to him, which was that 
all troops be placed on stand-by but Lhat 
they not be allowed to go out except on my 
orders. This was done because we did not 
know who was friend and foe...and we wanted 
to avoid shooting until we knew. 
*As Commander of the 4th Combat Command of KOSRAD in 
West Borneo, General Supardjo should have been at his 
post near Manggaian in West Borneo. Suharto would have 
known that he was in Djakarta if he had been there for 
proper reasons--either official or personal. His presen,!,'! 
in the capital, unknown to Suharto, was thus immediately 
suspicious.

The Show of Force in Djakarta 
Simultaneously with the raids on the homes of the 
generals, the coup forces had fanned out in the center 
of Djakarta, seizing control of the most important instal-
lations, above all the Palace and the radio station.* The 
troops used in this phase of the coup were those of the 
454th Battalion and the 530th Battalion minus the one 
company from each that had been sent on the raiding mis-
sions. The two battalions mustered about 1,000 men each. 
As in the case of the army units assigned to kidnap the 
generals, these troops were dressed in regular army uni-
form and armed. There were no civilians, armed or unarmed, 
among them, as far as we know. 
By 0600 hours component units of these two batta-
lions were stationed at different points around Merdeka 
Square, in front of the Presidential Palace, and around 
the radio station. General Umar had seen the troops on 
his drive to KOSTRAD headquarters to report to General 
Suharto. He was able to identify them as elements of 
the 454th and 530th battalions, which had arrived in 
Djakarta only two days previously to take part in the 
Armed Forces Day parade on 5 October. Since Suharto kne* 
that these troops were to have taken part in a rehearsal 
for the parade that very morning and thus should not 
have been where they were, he could calculate that he 
*The location of the Palace, the radio station, the 
telecommunications building, and the railroad station 
around one large square, Merdeka Square, in the center 
of Djakarta made it a relatively easy military operation 
to seize control of these vital objectives of any coup 
attempt. In this sense, Djakarta was the ideal city for 
a coup. All of the coup forces, except those involved 
in the raids on the generals' homes, were concentrated 
aibund Merdeka Square. (See the insert of Merdeka Square 
on the map of Djakarta and vicinity.)

was dealing with an enemy that had control of at least 
two main battalions of the Indonesian Army and at least 
part of the inter-service Tjakrabirawa unit that was 
Sukarno's special guard. What was unclear was just who 
was giving the orders to these units. 
The Central Command in Djakarta  
Although Suharto did not know it, the Central Com-
mand of the coup had established itself in the Aerial 
Survey Office building, next to the PENAS film studio, 
on the main road from Djakarta to Bogor. Situated near 
the juncture of the Djakarta-Bogor Highway and the road 
into Halim, the Aerial Survey office was only a few miles 
from Suharto's KOSTRAD headquarters. The five men who 
comprised the Command had been there most of the night, 
having moved there-from Lubang Buaja where the3 had in-
spected the troops sometime around midnight.* Of these 
five men Suharto would have been personally acquainted 
with three of them--the three who were in the military. 
He would never have heard of the other two--the two 
civilians in the group. 
1. Lt. Col. Untung, aged 40, was a battalion com-
mander of the special Tjakrabirawa Honor Guard that guarcEd 
President Sukarno. Newly appointed to the .job, he had 
commanded the 454th Battalion of the Diponegoro 
(the Central Java Territorial Division) until a few montl-!.. 
before the coup. Although limited in some respects and 
politically naive, he was well-thought of as a military 
officer and was considered to be on his way up in the 
Army. 
*One of the men who composed the Central Command, Air 
Force Major Sujono, had not arrived at the Aerial Survey 
Office until 0630 hours; the others had come several 
hours earlier, as soon as they had completed their re-
view of the troops at Lubang Buaja.

2. Air Force Yajor Sujono, aged 45, was Regimental 
Commander, Air Base Defense Troops (PPP) in command of 
the troops that were assigned to guard Halim Air Force 
.Base, a major air base some seven miles distant from 
Djakarta. 
3. Col. Latief was Commander of the 1st Infantry 
Brigade of the 5th Territorial Command, a post which in-
volved control of a number of the mobile battalions in 
Djakarta. 
4. Sjam, aged 42, was a man whose true identity 
-was known to only a very few people. The military of-
ficers involved in the coup knew him only as Sjam--one 
of his several aliases. They all accepted the fact that 
he spoke for the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), with-
out asking too many questions. Actually, they seem to 
have had some idea (whether they knew for sure or notL 
that he represented Aidit, the Chairman of the PKI per-
sonally.* 
Sjam's true identity and function in the PKI or-
ganization have now been clearly established. (It must 
be remembered that we now know more about the secret 
party organization of the PKI before the coup than we 4 
have ever known about most other Communist parties. Be-
fore the coup, only a few of the most trusted members 
of the PKI itself would have known of the secret organi-
zation Sjam headed, and even fewer would have known the 
identity of the man who ran the organization.) Sjam's 
real namewas Kamarusaman Bin Achmad Mubaidah, and he was 
*At his trial, Untung testified: "It is true that Sjam 
stated that he was a friend of Aidit; on one occasion, 
he said he was a messenger from Aidit, who had ordered 
him to attend the meetings in order to be in on the plan-
ning of the 30 September Movement. Whether this happened 
to be true or not, I did not know. My understanding was 
That he was simply from the PKI." Apparently, Sujono and 
Latief and the others had the same vague understanding 
of who Sjam really was.

the Chief of the Special Bureau of the PKI--the clandestine 
arm of the PKI. Established as a special apparatus for 
handling those matters that could not be accomplished 
through the overt PKI organization, the Special Bureau 
was primarily concerned with military matters, in par-
ticular PKI penetration of the Indonesian military organi-
zation. Among those in the military whom the Special 
Bureau -managed" were Air Force Chief of Staff Omar Dani, 
Brig. General Supardjo, Col. Untung, Col. Latief, and 
Air Force Major Sujono.* (Apparently, Sjam personally 
"managed" Brig. Gen. Supardjo, while the others were 
"managed" by subordinates of his in the Special Bureau.) 
In its operations, the Bureau was apparently entirely free 
of the control of the politburo and maintained direct 
contact only with Aidit. 
5. Pono, whose real name was Marsudidjojo, was 
a subordinate of Sjam as the second-ranking membert,of the 
PKI's Special Bureau. His job was to "manage" PKI con-
tacts in the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Territorial 
Command (Latief's brigade), the PPP units guarding Air 
Force installations (Maj. Sujono's regiment), the Tjak-
rabirawa Palace Guard, and the Djakarta Military Police. 
*These men were not necessarily Communist (in the sense 
of being Communist party members) because they had regular 
contacts with important PKI persons connected with the 
Special Bureau. They all deny being Communists and that 
may well be true, although it is also possible that one 
or two--like Dani or Supardjo or Untung--were "sleepers." 
There are some reports that Untung and Dani were secret 
party members, but there is no convincing evidence that 
this was true. Certainly, they were pro-Communist, and, 
being sympathetic to the party and its aims, they were 
able to be used by the PKI for ,its own purposes. The PKI 
"managed" them in the sense' of directing their thinking 
and their actions along certain lines. In carrying out 
� the coup under PKI direction, they were in fact agents 
of the PKI, whether they chose to look at it that way or 
not.

Pono personally "managed" both Latief and Sujono.* 
In addition to the five men of the Central Command 
whom we know were at the Aerial Survey Office Building 
from the early morning hours, General Supardjo arrived 
there abodt 0400 hours while it was still dark; he, too, 
had visited Lubang Buaja earlier in the night. As com-
mander of the 4th Combat Command of KOSTRAD in West 
Borneo, General Supardjo should have been at his post 
near Manggaion in West Borneo. He had no official reason 
to be in Djakarta, and he had not reported his presence 
there to Army Commander Yani or KOSTRAD Commander Suharto. 
As we shall see later, only a few persons--int.luding 
President Sukarno and Chief of the Air Force Dani--knew 
that he had arrived in Djakarta on 28 September, osten-
sibly to visit his sick daughter. In connection with 
events on the morning of 1 October, he had been given 
the assignment of contacting the President, with the 
purpose of informing him of the action that had been 
carried out against the generals and/or taking him to 
Halim Air Force Base, where a safe place had been prepared 
4 
*The third-ranking member of the Special Bureau--Walujo 
(whose real name is Subono) had the assignment of "manag-
ing" pici contacts in the Air Force (excluding the Air 
Force PPP troops that guarded Air Force installations) 
and the Palace Guard. Thus, he was the PKI contact man 
for Omar Dani, Untung, General Pranoto, and others. He 
was not a member of the five-man Central Command of the 
coup, however; in fact, he is not known to have played 
any role in the coup or in the planning for it; his only 
known involvement was his presence at the 29 September 
meeting of the Central Command that was concerned with 
last-minute preparations for the coup. 
Since Walujo had been Untung's contact man from the 
Special Bureau, Untung had not met either Sjam or Pono 
before September 1965, when the planning for the coup got 
underway. He seems to have appreciated the fact that 
these men were all close associates of Aidit, however. 
At his trial, he stated that Pono was ''also a buddy of 
Aidit, just as Sjam was."

for him. There is reason to think that Supardjo actually 
intended to accompany Sukarno to Halim, although the coup 
leaders have preferred to explain Supardjo's mission as 
simply that of informing the President of the coup action 
that morning. 
Originally, Police Commissioner Anwas and Air Force 
Col. Heru were to accompany Supardjo in the party to in-
form Sukarno, and they were to await word from Lubang 
Buaja that all the generals had been taken captive. How-
ever, Anwas did not arrive at the Aerial Survey Office 
and, for some reason, Supardjo left before the Central 
Command had received a report from Lubang Buaja.* The 
commanders of the 454th and 530th battalions--Major Su-
kirno of the 454th and Major Bambang Supeno of the 530th--
had just arrived at the Aerial Survey Office to report 
on the successful securing of the Palace and the radio 
station, and it was decided that they would go wit!? Gen-
eral Supardjo and Col. Heru to see Sukarno. The delega-
tion arrived at the Palace around 0630 hours. 
It is important to an understanding of Sukarno's 
actions that day, as well as to an understanding of the 
source of the conflicting reports that all of the generals 
had or had not been captured, that one keep in mind Uhat 
Supardjo left on his mission to the Palace under the im-
pression that the kidnapping raids had indeed been a suc-
cess. He was not to learn otherwise until some hours 
later, when he finally arrived back at Halim Air Force 
Base and after he had seen Sukarno. 
*In commenting on the change of plans, Supardjo has 
said simply: "It was decided to bring the President after 
the report that General Parman had been secured was re-
ceived"--without explaining why it was decided not to 
wait for word about the other generals. Obviously, the 
coup group was confident of success. And it may be that 
time was pressing, and they were anxious to have Sukarno 
safely in their custody.

Sukarno Hears the News 
The exact whereabouts of President Sukarno and his 
-actions on the day of the coup have been fairly well estab-
lished by a variety of sources. On the evening of 30 
September, Sukarno had addressed the National Conference 
of Technicians at the Senajan Sports Stadium in Djakarta. 
Apparently, he returned to the palace sometime around 
2300 hours. Shortly after that, he suddenly left again 
to spend the night at his wife Dewi's home, accompanied 
011y b} his personal bodyguard. According to Dewi, Sukarno 
',leas furious upon arriving at her house to find that she 
had not yet returned home from a party at the Hotel Indo-
nesia. He sent a message for her to return home immedi-
ately. 
Sukarno spent the night at Devi's house, arisiqg 
early in the morning as was his custom. It seems quite 
clear that he fully expected to be back at the Palace be-
fore anyone might want to see him that morning. At 0600 
hours, he was enroute to the Palace when he received a 
report on the car radio (on the Tjakrabirawa radio com-
munication system) that shooting had occurred at the homes 
of General Nasution, Dr. Leimena, and General Pandjaitaa. 
Apparently, only the one personal bodyguard who had ac-
companied Sukarno to Devi's house the night before knew 
where he was. Neither Col. Saelan, deputy commander of 
the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, nor Capt. Suwarno, 
company commander of Battalion I of the Tjakrabirawa, who 
were on duty at the Palace that morning had been able to 
locate him earlier, around 0530 hours, when they first 
received a report from Chief of Police Sumirat about the 
kidnappings. It might seem that Sukarno had deliberately 
put himself out of touch with the rest of the government 
machinery in order to protect his options as events de-
veloped--assuming that he knew beforehand of the coup 
plans. At other times of crisis in the past, it had been 
characteristic of him to disappear from the scene and 
remain incommunicado at some unknown hiding place until 
the situation cleared. In this case, however, he defi-
nitely seems to have been on his way to the Palace and 
would have been there in time to receive Supardjo if 
-16-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
everything had gone according to plan. Certainly, Supardjo 
and the other coup leaders expected to find him there. 
Col. Saelan and Capt. Suwarno had first looked for 
Sukarno at the home of Harjati, another of his wives. 
Not finding him there, they had finally succeeded in con-
tacting the President on the car radio. Having learned 
from Chief of Police Sumirat that the Palace was surrounded 
by unidentified troops, Saelan ordered the presidential 
party not to enter the Palace but to proceed to Harjati's 
home in Grogol. By the time Sukarno arrived there, Saelan 
had received a later report that General Nasution had 
escaped his abductors, that the general's aide had been 
abducted, and that his daughter had been wounded. Saelan 
reported the news to the President as soon as he came 
inside Harjati's house. 
That Sukarno first learned the true story of the 
raid on Nasution's.home--before Supardjo (who was then 
at the Palace) heard the news and before Untung and the 
rest of the Central Command at the Aerial Survey learned 
the true facts and, apparently, even before those at 
Lubang Buaja recognized the mistaken identity of Lt. 
Tendean, certainly before those at Halim Air Force Base 
were informed--is a crucial fact about the coup that.thas 
never been mentioned in any account of the coup. It 
gave Sukarno an advantage of time that the leaders of 
the coup did not have in considering their course of 
action in the light of the unexpected escape of Nasution. 
After Sukarno received Saelan's report, he is re-
ported to have said that it came as an "absolute surprise" 
to him. It is unclear whether he meant the news of the 
action taken against the generals or the news of Nasution's 
escape. He then asked Saelan: "What will you do with 
me?" 
On the grounds that Devi's house, Harjati's house 
and the Palace were not safe, Sukarno made the decision 
himself to go to Halim Air Force Base, where he would be 
near an airfield in case of an emergency. Preceded by 
an escort, the President and his entourage were driven 
to Halim, arriving there about 0930 hours. He was welcomed 
at the air base's Operations Command Center by the Ministel/ 
-17-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Commander of the Air Force, Omar Dani, who seemed to be 
expecting him. 
There is an unaccounted-for period of almost three 
hours from the time that Sukarno arrived at Harjati's 
house to the time that he must have left for Halim to 
arrive there at approximately 0930 hours. Apparently, 
he was at Harjati's house the whole time. He may have 
been awaiting word on the fate of Nasution. Sometime 
after 0630 hours, Lt Col. Ebram, the head of the Tjak-
rabirawa intelligence section, and several of his men 
arrived at Nasution's house on the orders of the Presi-
dent, they said, to ask about the whereabouts and safety 
of General Nasution. No doubt. Sukarno did order such 
an independent check on the report that Nasution had 
escaped. Col. Ebram was the head escort of the Presi-
dential party on the trip to Halim, so he was clearly 
acting on behalf of Sukarno that morning. He was unaOle 
to establish the truth regarding Nasution's whereabouts. 
The Murder of the Generals 
As already suggested, the Central Command at the' 
Aerial Survey Office had not heard the news of Nasution's 
escape. As a matter of fact, they did not learn about 
the unexpected turn of events until they had disbanded 
the Command Center at the Aerial Survey office and moved 
back to Halim Air Force Base. 
Around 0800 hours, Lt. Dul Arief, who had been in 
command of the troops on the raids to the generals' homes, 
arrived at the Aerial Survey Office to report to Untung 
and Latief in person on the success of his mission. He 
had just come from Lubang Buaja where he had discharged 
his final duty in turning over the generals to lir Force 
Major Gatot Sukrisno, who had been designated to receive 
them there. As of that moment, it is clear that Arief 
did not realize the error of the mistaken identity of Lt. 
Tendean. He reported that four generals (supposing one 
to be General Nasution) had been captured alive and three 
had been killed in the process of capturing them.

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
As to the fate of the generals at Lubang Buaja, 
they were taken inside a tent as each arrived on separate 
trucks at slightly different times. A reliable witness 
to the scene has described events as follows: 
When I entered the tent I saw 7 men treated as 
prisoners (he must not have realized that three 
were already dead) who were in a sad condition. 
Some lay on their backs, soiled and bloody, 
and two sat down, their hands bound and eyes 
covered with a red cloth. I heard a member 
of the Tjakrabirawa say: 'Yani has already 
been killed.' An officer of the Tjakrabirawa 
with the name Dul Ariel on his uniform was 
(issuing orders). 
The tent was near a small house with an old 
well close to the kitchen of the house. Att. 
about half past six in the morning I saw some 
civilians crowd around the old well scream-
ing 'Crush the unbelievers.' I saw then how 
the persons who had been lying on their backs 
were carried out of the tent and thrown into 
the well. This was followed by a burst of 
fire from an automatic weapon aimed into the 
well by a member of the Air Force who had two 
white stripes on his shoulders. Then a hand-
cuffed prisoner was taken to the wel:. His 
eyes were covered before he was thrown head-
first into the well, followed by a burst of 
rifle fire. 
I was afraid. Then a soldier of the Tjakra-
birawa came over to me and said 'You need not 
be afraid. This killing takes place on the 
orders of the President because these people 
are members of the Council of Generals and 
wanted to kill the President on Armed Forces 
Day. We are killing them therefore before 
they can kill the President. You know that 
it is the task of the Tjakrabirawa to protect 
the President.'

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624

I saw how the last prisoner was dragged to the 
edge of the well, but I could not see his face 
clearly, as it was scratched and soiled with 
blood. He was thrown into the well like the 
others. The civilians piled litter and leaves 
in the well. and I saw how a helicopter hovered 
above us, apparently to watch the people work-
ing around the well. I could not see who was 
in the helicopter. 
The initial Army accounts of the killing of the 
generals placed great emphasis on the alleged torture 
and mutilation of the generals by the civilians mentioned 
above, who were Communist youth and women in military 
training at Lubang Buaja. This theme found lurid elabora-
tion in many instances. Without doubt, these stories 
suffered from severe inflation. All of the victims 
except possibly Lt. Tendean were shot without any hint 
of torture or mutilation. Lt. Tendean may have received 
several blows from rifle butts before he was shot. There 
was none of the ghastly mutilation of the bodies that 
was recounted in the press, however. For the death of 
the generals and the actual circumstances of the deaths, 
the military officers at Lubang Buaja--and they alone--
must bear the responsibility, it would seem. There is 
no convincing evidence that the PKI civilians who were 
at Lubang Buaja for military training (and who were armed 
by the Air Force later that morning to serve as "reserve 
troops" for the coup) played any significant role in the 
murders--except as witnesses to the scene.* 
*The "confessions" of the members of the PKI youth 
and women's organizations that were implicated in the as-
sassinations leave the impression that they were little 
aware of what was happening and that they might have been 
used unwittingly. Their accounts of the murder scene 
differ markedly, so that it is difficult to put much 
faith, in any of their stories. No doubt many of the "con-
fessions" were contrived by the army. In other cases, 
some of the people interrogated may have been in shock 
at seeing the murders and, later, they were unable to 
recall precisely what they had witnessed.

The Coup is Proclaimed 
At precisely the moment that the generals were 
meeting death at Lubang Baaja, an impatient Captain Suradi 
was waving a pistol at the announcer of Radio Indonesia 
who was reading the morning news broadcast. With some 
20 of his men standing guard outside the building, the 
captain, who -was acting as commander of the troops dis-
patched to secure the Palace, the radio station, and the 
telecommunications building, had forced his way into the 
broadcasting room and threatened the station manager and 
the announcer if they refused to read a statement over 
the radio that he wanted broadcast. They agreed to read 
it at the end of the first news report of the day. And 
so at 0710 hours the official announcement of the coup 
was broadcast to the nation. 
In announcing the fact that a movement "directed 
against the generals who are members of the Council of 
Generals" had taken place that morning, the statement 
repeatedly stressed that the action was purely and simply 
an internal Army affair. Untung, as commander of the 
movement, assumed full responsibility for what he called 
"preventive action against a plot by the Generals' Coun-
cil, a CIA-sponsored subversive movement...which planned 
to stage a coup on 5 October." The generals involved 
were said to have been arrested, and President Sukarno 
and "a number of other public figures who would have 
been targets of the Council of Generals" were said to be 
"safely under the protection of the 30 September Move-
ment."* 
*It is to be remembered that at 0710 hours, when this 
announcement was made that Sukarno was under "the safe 
protection of the 30 September Movement," the President 
was still at Harjati's house, and the coup group had not 
yet made contact with him. Under these circumstances, 
it was a remarkably confident assertion to make unless 
the coup leaders had some prearranged understanding with 
Sukarno that he would be taken to some agreed upon place 
at a certain time that morning. 
-21-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The announcement was notable for the absence of 
the usual perfunctory praise of Sukarno; his name was 
scarcely mentioned except for the fact that he had been 
taken to a safe place. It was almost inconceivable that 
'anyone staging a coup in Indonesia in 1965 would not have 
tried to make use of Sukarno's authority to swing public 
support behind their movement. Regardless of the facts, 
one would have expected the coup leaders to make a public 
statement claiming that they were acting on orders from 
Sukarno, to protect Sukarno from his enemies, to safe-
guard the Indonesian revolution. The fact that Sukarno 
was mentioned only as being "under the protection of the 
30 September Movement" created a vague impression that 
the coup might be anti-Sukarno. The only other credible 
explanation, if this was not the case, ..was that the con-
spirators felt that it would look better if Sukarno were 
not directly associated with the removal of the Generals 
but were to emerge later to give his blessing to the qpup. 
In this case, one could hypothesize that Sukarno must 
have held out the promise of making a subsequent broad-
cast announcing his endorsement of the coup; either that, 
or the coup group must have felt absolutely confident 
that Sukarno would endorse their movement after the fact, 
even if he had not given his approval beforehand. 
The Central Command Moves to Halim 
The radio announcement was made at a time when the 
leaders of the 30 September Movement thought their move-
ment had succeeded. Shortly afterwards, around 0900 hours, 
the Central Command moved from the Aerial Survey Office 
in Djakarta to Halim Air Force Base. This was not a re-
treat; it was a move planned in advance as the coup moved 
into the political stage after the initial military action. 
Sukarno, Commander of the Air Force Dani and a yet unmen-
tioned but important figure in the coup--D.N. Aidit, chair-
man of the PKI--were already there or on the way. 
The principals were not together in one location 
at Halim; they were at three different places, all within 
a distance of less than one mile of each other. Couriers 
-22-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
were sent back and forth with important communications; 
for instance, General Supardjo served as the main liaison 
between the President and the Central Command of Untung, 
Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono. As far as we know, Sukarno 
never had any direct contact with any of these five men 
in connection with the coup, either before the coup, the 
day of the coup, or after the coup. He was in the company 
of Dani and Supardjo, mainly, while he was at Halim. 
Similarly, Aidit remained apart from the men actually 
directing the coup. He communicated with the Central 
Command only by courier and apparently with Sukarno and 
Dani not at all. Still, he was near enough to be in 
close touch with events as they developed, should his 
lieutenants Sjam and Pono need his advice 
Major Sujono had personally brought Aidit to 
Halim, picking him up at his home around 0200 hours that 
morning. He had made the arrangements himself for the 
use of the home of one of the enlisted men on the iyase; 
Aidit and his two bodyguards spent the day there. Dani 
appears to have spent the night at Halim's Command Opera-
tions office, which included sleeping accommodations for 
the senior Air Force Command Staff. It probably would 
not have seemed extraordinary for Dani to sleep there. 
He, too, stayed in the one place the whole day of th(2; 
coup. Sukarno came directly there when he arrived at the 
base. 
The Central Command of the coup was installed in 
the home of Air Force Sergeant Sujatno, an aide of Major 
Sujono. Sergeant Sujatno had spent the whole day of the 
30th as well as that night at the Aerial Survey Office, 
on a "stand by" order from Major Sujono. � *On the 
Morning of the 1st Sujono reportedly asked him 
if he could use his house at Halim Air Force Base for a 
while as his office. Sujatno drove ahead to get things 
ready for Sujono. Soon, Latief, Untung, Sjam, Pono and 
Sujono arrived. Sujatno's description of the five men 
while they were at his house seems worth quoting, as it 
gives the flavor of the day at the Central Command. 
-23-

I was ordered by Sujono to get something to 
eat for these gentlemen. So we sat down and 
had some rice and SOME meat side dishes. When 
I went to get the rice in my room, I noticed 
that someone was sleeping in my bed.... It was 
Col. Latief. 
We sat eating for about an hour, and then 
Sujono called me and handed me an envelope, 
saying that I should take it to Capt. Suradi, 
who was supposed to be at Radio Republic... 
(When I got back) I was ordered to cook up 
some more rice. So I did. I noticed at this 
time that Untung had been seated in the back 
of the room, and neither changed his place 
nor said anything. There were two civilians 
*there and I asked Sujono about them, and he 
answered that I didn't need to know. 
Then, after I had cooked enough rice for them, 
I was ordered by Sujono to take a sealed 
envelope to Air Sergeant Suwadi's place, 
which was located within the complex. When 
I got there, someone met me at the door; I 
learned later from Sujono that the man was 
Aidit. I had to wait three or four minutes 
there, and then I was given a small envelope 
containing a reply and was ordered to deliver 
it. Aidit gave me the envelope; he was wear-
ing glasses.

General Supardjo had arrived back at Halim only 
a little while after Untung and Latief and the others. 
He came from the Palace by helicopter. (Omar Dani had 
sent the helivopter from Halim to pick up Supardjo after 
word had been received that the President was not at the 
Palace.) Dani is reported to have welcomed Supardjo 
with the exclamation "Success:'' Then he explained that 
Sukarno would soon arrive at the air base. Since it 
would still be a little while before he could report to 
the President, Supardjo asked Dani for permission to 
meet with the leaders of the .oup at Sgt Sujatno's house 
-24-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
in order to obtain the latest information on the develop-
ment of the coup from the Central Command. Sgt. Sujatno 
has confirmed that Supardjo came to his home soon after 
the other coup leaders arrived and that he joined them 
at the first meal served that morning. There is no in-
formation as to what was discussed, but presumably the 
formation of the Revolutionary Council was one of the 
topics. General S.Ipardjo signed the Decree establish-
ing the Revolutionary Council while he was at Sgt. Sujat-
no's house with the Central Command at this time. 
The New Order is Announced 
The Decree was one of three important orders is-
sued by the Central Command that morning: Decree No. 1, 
which was signed by Untung, Supardjo, and Air Force 
Colonel Heru, concerned the formation of the Revoltition-
w ary Council; Decision No. 1, which was signed by Untung 
only, listed the members of the new council; and Deci-
sion No. 2, which was also signed only by Untung, con-
cerned ranks and promotions in the military. Untung has 
said that it was approximately 1000 hours when he signed 
the Decree and about 1100 hours when he signed DecisWns 
No. 1 and 2. This would check perfectly with the time, 
as best we can calculate it, that Supardjo was at the 
Central Command. We know that he arrived there after 
Untung and the others did, around 0930 hours; he and 
Untung could well have signed the Decree at just about 
1000 hours, as Untung claims. At 1100, when Untung is 
supposed to have signed the Decisions, Supardjo had left 
the Central Command and was with the President.* 
*There seems to have been a two-hour delay in the case 
of both the Decree and the Decisions between the time 
that the orders were signed and the time they were first 
broadcast on the radio. The apparent disagreement be-
tween various sources on the matter of the timing of the 
broadcasts would seem to result from the fact that the 
(footnote continued on page 26) 
-25-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The point to be emphasized in connection with the 
timing of these orders is that they were signed before  
Untung and the rest of the Central Command learned of 
Nasution's escape though they were broadcast after they 
had finally received an accurate report. Untung seems 
to have made no attempt to stop the broadcasts after he 
realized that Nasution had actually escaped, but perhaps 
there would not have been time to do it, or he may have 
*.oht that it was already too late to stop them. 
The importance of settling the matter of the time 
that these orders were signed and then broadcast lies in 
the fact that it argues against the thesis that the Decree 
establishing the Revolutionary Council was an ad hoc deci-
sion of the Central Command, a last desperate effort of 
a failing movement. It has been argued that the coup lead-
ers were obviously improvising at this point in the un-
foreseen situation of having missed one of the prime tar-
gets of the coup and having failed to get the public dnp-
port of Sukarno for their undertaking. In support of this 
hypothesis, it is argued that the rather peculiar assort-
ment of names on the Revolutionary Council could only 
reflect an extemporaneous selection; furthermore, there 
is the established fact that many, if not most, of the 
persons on the Revolutionary Council had not been consulted 
ahead of time. The argument simply does not stand up in 
the face of what is known to have been the time sequence 
of the orders. Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence 
that the Revolutionary Council was always part of PKI plan-
ning for the coup, even if some of the major participants 
(footnote continued from page 25) 
orders were re-broadcast at regular intervals after they 
were first announced. Thus, Decree No. 1 was first broad-
cast at 1200 and again at 1300 and 1400 and 1430 hours. 
Untung heard the 1200 broadcast but Sukarno didn't hear 
the news broadcast about the Revolutionary Council until 
1430 hours. The so-called Decisions were first announced 
at the 1300 hours broadcast.

of the coup (such as Sukarno perhaps) were unaware of its 
full implications.* From the beginning, the coup leaders 
were prepared to announce the formation of the Revolution-
ary Council as an element of the coup; they did so, very 
much according to plan, at a time when they still thought 
everything else had gone pretty much according to plan. 
Sjam is reported to have brought the original copy 
of Decree No. 1 out of his briefcase at Sgt. Sujatno's 
house. According to Untung, "we took turns reading it, 
first myself, then Supardjo, and then Lt. Col..Heru. 
Then we signed it.. .I was (already) acquainted with the 
contents and purport of the decree." 
The purpose of the Decree was to eliminate 
the Generals' Council from the Dwikora Cabinet. 
We didn't mean to eliminate Sukarno from the 
cabinet. We intended that Sukarno would ap-
point a new cabinet, but the Decree said 
that the Revolutionary Council would appoint 
it. 
The precise formulation contained in the Decree was as 
follows: 
.With the collapse of state power into the 
hands of the Indonesian Revolutionary Coun-
cil, the Dwikora Cabinet is considered to 
be decommissioned. Until a new cabinet is 
formed by the Indonesian Revolutionary Coun-
cil, the former Ministers are authorized to 
conduct routine business, to maintain peace 
and security within their respective depart-
ments, but are prohibited from appointing 
new officials or taking any actions of con-
sequence. 
*The evidence as far as Sukarno's knowledge of the 
Revolutionary Council is concerned is contradictory. 
- For a fuller discussion of this point, see p. 91.

For the time being, the Indonesian Revolu-
tionary Council will be the locus of all 
authority of the Republic of Indonesia... 
As agencies of the Indonesian Revolution-
ary Council, provincial revolutionary 
councils will be formed, as well as regency 
revolutionary councils, district revolu-
tionary councils, and village revolutionary 
councils, with the councils consisting of 
both civilian and military personnel who 
support the 30 September Movement unreserv-
edly. 
At the least, the statement is ambiguous. There is ab-
solutely no mention of Sukarno in any context--a most 
curious omission. The office of the Presidency is not 
even mentioned. It is left entirely to one's own inter-
pretation whether there would be any change in the ofice, 
either in the person holding the office or the power of 
the office itself. 
With the announcement of Decision No. 1 of the 30 
September Movement, it was clear that Sukarno was not a 
member of the Revolutionary Council, whether it was pre-
sumed that he would continue as President or not. Untung 
was to serve as Chairman of the Council, and General 
Supardjo, Air Force Col. Heru, Navy Col. Sunardi, and 
Police Commissioner Anwas were to be the vice-chairmen. 
Omar Dani, Air Force Major Sujono, and Col. Latief were 
among the other 40 members. Thus, with the exception of 
Sukarno and Aidit and Aidit's two high-level agents, Sjam 
and Pono, all of the major participants of the coup who 
were at Halim were included as members of the Council. 
The coup group may well have intended.that Sukarno's 
authority remain as before in the new government but may 
have had special reasons for not wanting to mention his 
name in connection with the coup. 'As we will see later, 
this was probably the explanation for the curious omis-
sion of any reference to Sukarno in the Decree. It may 
not have occurred to them that their declaration might 
be construed .as being aimed at the President rather than 
simply at the cabinet. Under the circumstances, however, 
-28-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of its being absolutely routine to praise Sukarno at length 
at every occasion, the failure to make any reference what-
soever to the President was quite likely to be interpreted 
as an indication of anti-Sukarno motives. The Decree 
seemed to convey the impression that the President had 
been put aside. 
It is possible, of course, that the coup leaders 
did not intend that Sukarno continue as President, with 
undiminished powers. If so, the PKI must have been plan-
ning a double-cross of the President and some of the mili-
tary leaders involved in the coup who clearly believed 
that they were acting in support of Sukarno. (This point 
is examined later, in connection with the testimony of 
various individuals who were involved in the planning of 
the coup.) From the point of view of the PKI, the Revolu-
tionary Council would have been the perfect Nasakom Cabinet 
that the party had long been pressuring Sukarno to form.* 
On the face of it, its membership was representativle of 
the major power groups in Indonesia. Almost half of the 
45 members were government officials, a few of them high-
level, like Foreign Minister Subandrio and Deputy Prime 
Minister Leimena. Among the leading political figures 
were the top party leaders, either the chairman or the 
secretary-general, of the seven major non-Communist ppli-
tical parties. There was no Communist party leader of 
equivalent status; of the five known Communists on the 
Council, three were lesser known members of the PK1 Cen-
tral Committee. In the case of the military, which com-
posed the other half of the Council, there had obviously 
been the same deliberate effort to have all four of 
donesia's armed services--the army, navy, air force, and 
*As the most immediate goal in its long-range plan to 
seize power peacefully, the PKI was demanding equal repre-
sentation with the Nationalist and Religious parties in 
Indonesia in a so-called "Nasakom" cabinet. The word 
"Nasakom" was a word coined from the first letters of the. 
Indonesian words NASionalis (nationalist), Agama (religious), 
and KOMunis (Communist). 
-29-

police--represented. Among the Army officers included 
were 6 Generals �of the Army, one of them being Gen. Umar 
Wirahadikusumah, the Commander of the Djakarta area who 
had been first on the scene at Nasution's home, after 
the raid on his house. Gen. Umar was one of the many 
Council members who have categorically denied knowing any-
thing about the Revolutionary Council before they heard 
their names read off on the radio as members of the 
Council. A high-level PKI official has said that even 
the PKI members on the Council were not informed ahead 
of time nor was their approval requested. 
Actually, the Revolutionary Council was the per-
fect Communist front organization. With only one-ninth 
of its membership known to be Communist, it included as 
many well-known anti-Communists as Communists and pro-
Communists together. From what was generally known at 
the time about its various members, therefore, Communist 
control of the group was not readily apparent. However, 
there was a group of middle-level military officers who 
were almost inconspicuous among the list of well-known 
figures; this group held the balance of power on the 
Council. Practically nothing was known about these men, 
especially their politics. Few people outside the In-
donesian military had ever heard of Untung or Heru or , 
Sundardi or Sujono or Latief. It might be assumed that 
they were anti-Communist like the majority of the Indon-
esian military. Who would have suspected that they were 
so totally under PKI influence, even if not Communist 
party members, that they were prepared to do the party's 
bidding, even to the point of conspiring to murder the 
top Army leadership? 
President Sukarno at Halim 
Soon after signing the Decree establishing the 
Revolutionary Council, General Supardjo left the Central 
Command at Sgt. .Sujatno's house and went back to Halim's 
Operations Command Center, where'the President had arrived 
at about 0930 hours. Sukarno had received 
a general report from Omar Dani but was awaiting a detailed 
report from General Supardjo on the events of the day. 
-30-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Supardjo's much-delayed meeting with the President, 
which finally took place about 1030 hours, has been the 
subject of conflicting stories, many of them pure specula-
tion, no doubt. It would certainly be a major factor in 
determining the role of Sukarno in the coup if we knew 
for sure what transpired at the meeting. According to 
Untung (whose testimony on the coup seems to provide the 
most reliable and complete story of events), after General 
Supardjo reported on the coup and the kidnapping of the 
Generals, Sukarno asked two questions: (1) if it was 
true that General Nasution had been captured, and (2) why 
was Untung leading the movement. Supardjo replied that 
it was true that Nasution had been captured and that Untung 
assumed the leadership because "he was the one consider-
ed most appropriate by the comrades." Some reports have 
claimed that Sukarno also asked Supardjo where Untung 
was, but apparently it was General Sabur, the Commander 
of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard and Untung's0m-
mediate superior, who had come to Halim at Sukarno's call, 
who asked Supardjo that question later in the day.* Ac-
cording to the most well-known version of the Sukarno-
Supardjo meeting (the official Army version), Sukarno is 
reported to have patted Supardjo on the back and said in 
Dutch: "Good job." Although it is quite believable--and 
it may well be true--that he did this, it can not be troved. 
Supardjo denies it and Untung is not known to have com-
mented on it. Similarly, there is disagreement as to 
whether or not Sukarno said to Supardjo: "Now, then, I 
shall take over the leadership and appoint another Com-
mander-in-Chief." Untung has denied that Sukarnc said 
*Apparently, General Sabur arrived at Halim while 
Supardjo was talking to the President. Once at Halim, 
General Sabur stayed close to Sukarno, accompanying him 
to Air Commodore Susanto's house (which was on the base) 
when the Presidential party moved there from Operations 
Command soon after 1200 hours. General Sabur remained 
with Sukarno all afternoon and finally accompanied him 
to the Presidential Palace at Bogor that evening after 
the collapse of the coup. 
-31-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
anything about taking over the leadership. Apparently, 
the subject of the new Commander-in-Chief of the Army did 
come up, because Supardjo asked that he be given an op-
portunity to consult with his "comrades" on the matter. 
The President answered: "Yes, all right, but return im-
mediately." 
For a second time that morning, Supardjo went to 
the Central Command at Sgt. Sujatno's house and briefed 
Untung, Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono on the results of 
the meeting with the President. After conferring, they 
decided to recommend to Sukarno that he appoint Maj. 
_General Pranoto, then third assistant to Army Chief of 
Staff Yani, as the new Commander of the Army.* 
*General Pranoto had succeeded General Suharto as Com-
mander of the Diponegoro (Central Java) Territorial Divi-
sion. Apparently, Nasution had been responsible for his 
removal as Commander before his normal tour of duty in 
that command was up. During his years as commander of 
the Diponegoro Division, he is reported to have done noth-
ing to obstruct Communist influence in the military. ' 
At the time of the coup, Pranoto was director of per-
sonnel for the Army, which meant that he had authority 
in the crucial matter of military assignments. From the 
point of view of the PKI, he was ideally placed to serve 
the party's interests. Since the coup, it has been re-
vealed that Pranoto was a "contact" of the PKI Special 
Bureau, just like Untung, Latief, Sujono, Supardjo, and 
Dani. He and Latief were both "managed" by Pono, the 
number two man in the Special Bureau and one of the cen-
tral figures in the coup. Pranoto was known to be a 
close friend of Dani. It was rumored that his relations 
with Suharto were very cool, for personal as well as 
political reasons. In Pranoto, the PKI and Sukarno would 
have had a Commander of the Army as responsive to their 
wishes as Dani was as Commander of the Air Force.

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Apparently, the Central Command still had no defi-
nite information that Nasution had escaped,. although by 
this time they seem to have been alerted to the possibility 
of this having happened. At both the Central Command and 
Operations Command there was general confusion and uncer-
tainty as to what really had happened, as conflicting 
reports began to be received. 
When Supardjo re-appeared at Operations Command, 
the possibility that General Nasution had eluded his cap-
tors was beginning to be seriously considered 'as more 
and more reports confirmed Sukarno's first information 
on the subject. For a matter of some hours now the Presi-
dent had been in doubt. As early as 0630 hours he had 
received a report from Col. Saelan that Nasution had 
escaped. Since that time, he had been trying to verify 
that report. He had sent Col. Ebram to Nasution's house 
to check out the information, but the Colonel had ten 
unable to learn anything definite about Nasution's where-
abouts. General Supardjo had assured him that reports 
of Nasution's escape were not true, but soon thereafter 
Gen. Sabur arrived at Halim to tell him just the opposite. 
It is difficult to establish just when Sukarno 
finally was convinced by the reports that Nasution had, 
escaped. As long as he continued to receive conflict-
ing reports--which was all morning long and into the 
afternoon--he may simply not have known what to believe. 
In that case, he--and the rest of the coup group--may 
have made some of the important decisions of the day in 
a state of uncertainty, not knowing for sure what had 
occurred at Nasution's home but aware of the difference 
it made to their planning whether Nasution had escaped 
or not. 
At their second meeting of the day, which took 
place as soon as Supardjo returned to Operations Command 
following his conference with the coup leaders on the 
matter of the appointment of a new Army commander, Sukarno 
and Supardjo discussed the report that Nasution had 
escaped. According to Supardjo, the President said to 
him: "It is Nekolim that will benefit. Yes, in a 
-33-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
revolution, such things will happen, and when they do 
it is Nekolim that benefits."* Again according to Su-
pardjoiSukarno asked his advice about what to do now. 
Supardjo replied: "It depends on Bapak (Indonesian word 
'for "father" which was commonly used to refer to Sukarno). 
I have two battalions that are at the President's dis-
posal." Apparently, Sukarno did not make a decision at 
that moment. 
It seems that Nasution's escape--or the possibility 
of it--had a profound effect on the President. If it 
was not the main reason, it was certainly a contributing 
factor in his final decision to stop the movement. We 
can only speculate.as to the main factor influencing 
Sukarno's decision. It may have been the failure of the 
coup to capture Nasution and realization that the coup 
plans had seriously gone awry. Or it may have been his 
shock and disapproval over certain aspects of the actlion, 
such as the murder of the generals, which he may not have 
anticipated. Or it may have been his concern that Suharto 
had rallied the army to oppose the coup in a way never 
anticipated by the coup leaders. 
Apparently, Sukarno was very much concerned to 
learn that two battalions of the RPKAD, the paracommando 
units of the Army under the command of Col. Sarwo Edhy, 
had arrived in Djakarta and were waiting further orders 
from Suharto. These two paratroop battalions, which had 
been stationed just outside the city, had been scheduled 
to depart for North Borneo several days before the coup. 
Unknown to Sukarno, their departure had been delayed be-
cause of some confusion over transportation. Quite pos-
sibly, the coup plans had taken into account the fact 
that the paratroopers would have departed for Borneo by 
the time of the coup; apparently, no one had checked to 
see whether they had actually departed on schedule. 
Sukarno is reported to have shown great interest in the 
Nekolim was an acronym for NEokolonialisme-KOLonialisme-
IMperialisme, the three evil isms according to Sukarno. 
-34-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
RPKAD on the morning of the coup. According to a very 
reliable source, he protested to Supardjo at one point: 
"You told me the RPKAD would not be in Djakarta." Supard-
jo is reported to have assured Sukarno that it made no 
difference to the coup plans. 
However, around 1200 hours, Sukarno called Supardjo 
in to tell him of his decision to stop the movement. Ac-
cording to Supardjo, the President asked him to talte care 
to prevent further bloodshed. Supardjo said that he and 
the two battalion commanders would see to this. Then, 
according to Supardjo, the President said: "If you can't 
stop the movement, you'll be butchered." In the official 
Army version of events, Sukarno is reported to have said: 
"Be careful. If you can't stop the-movement, I'm the 
butcher." 
If Sukarno ever had any intention of makingta pub-
lic statement in support of the coup--as the coup leaders 
have intimated that he did--he had apparently given up 
all thought of it now. From the moment that he issued 
the order to stop the movement, his main concern was 
clearly to dissociate himself from it; he would hardly 
have considered anything that would implicate him further. 
4 
At this point, President Sukarno left the Opera-
tions Command Center and moved to the nearby home of Air 
Commodore Susanto. Earlier that morning, Major Sujono 
had personally informed Susanto that his house would be 
occupied by the President at 0800 hours. (This would tend 
to confirm other indications we have that the coup lead-
ers definitely expected Sukarno to join them at the air 
base that morning, either on his own initiative according 
to a prearranged plan or as a hostage of the coup group.) 
Apparently, Sujono had thought that Sukarno would go 
directly to Susanto's house when he arrived at Halim. 
Sukarno had asked to go to Operations Command first, how-
ever, possibly because he wanted to see Omar Dani. 
Sukarno was to spend all afternoon at the home of 
Susanto; he was there until about 2030 hours when he 
finally left Halim to go to Bogor Palace. Amazing as it 
might seem under the circumstances he apparently spent 
-35-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
a good part of his time there just resting and sleeping 
--and listening to the radio. He was at Susanto's house 
when he heard the radio broadcast about the Revolution-
ary Council. According to some reports, the President 
was surprised to learn about the establishment of such 
a Council. After the coup, he was quoted as saying that 
he disapproved of the Revolutionary Council; but, if that 
was true, he took no action whatsoever at the time to do 
anything about it. 
And the explanation for this would seem not to 
have been that he was a prisoner or virtual prisoner of 
the coup group and therefore not able to influence the 
course of events at Halim. On the contrary, Sukarno 
seems to have been very much his own free agent from the 
time that he went to Halim at his own initiative to the 
moment that he decided to leave for Bogor, several hours 
after Leimena and others at the airbase had first urgeO 
him to depart.* His complete independence of .action that 
day was certainly clear from the fact that he sent his 
own emissaries back and forth from Halim all afternoon. 
It was from one of these emissaries that Gen. Suharto at 
KOSTRAD headquarters first learned that Sukarno was at 
Halim. Sukarno sent a courier to Nasution as well as 
*After the coup, Sukarno repeatedly emphasized his 
"freedom of action" throughout the day at Halim and the 
fact that he had gone there in the first place of his 
own free will to avoid the threat of "undesirable events" 
in Djakarta and to be near an airplane in case of emerg-
ency. It seems that he said this to prevent the Army 
from using his supposed "arrest" by the coup group and 
"vicious PKI elements" to destroy the PKI. He was con-
cerned at all costs not to allow the Army to make it look 
as though the already implicated PKI had taken action 
against the President rather than against the Council 
of Generals. Despite his particular motives for stres-
sing the point after the coup, it seems that he was not 
distorting history at all by emphasizing that he was not 
a-prisoner of anybody while he was at Halim. 
-36-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Suharto asking them both to come to Halim. Couriers dis-
patched by Sukarno were also in touch with Gen. Sabur, 
Commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, Deputy 
Prime Minister Leimena, Gen. Pranoto, Navy Commander 
Martadinata, and Police Commander Sutjipto. The message 
was the same in every case, that Sukarno wanted to see 
these men at Halim immediately.* Clearly, Sukarno was 
under no restraint from the coup leaders in communicating 
with people outside Halim Air Force Base. 
One of his most trusted and loyal advisers--First 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Subandrio--
with whom Sukarno was also now anxious to confer, was not 
in Djakarta at the time. He had left town on the morn-
ing of the 29th, along with twelve other ministers of 
the cabinet, for an official inspection tour of Sumatra. 
(No specific reason for the trip was ever given.) On the 
*Apparently, Martadinata, Sutjipto, and Leimena checked 
first with Suharto before deciding to go to Halim. As 
we shall see, Leimena delivered a message to Sukarno from 
Suharto that the President should be out of Halim byt1630 
hours, as Suharto was considering attacking the airbase 
if the coup forces had not surrendered by then. Leimena 
and Gen. Sabur were the only two men of those contacted 
by Sukarno who went to Halim. Suharto refused to allow 
Pranoto, Martadinata, and Sutjipto to go, on the grounds 
that the Army "had already lost enough generals." It is 
not clear whether Sabur asked Suharto's approval, first, 
as Leimena did, or whether he went on his own, as soon 
as he received Sukarno's summons; most likely, it was the 
latter. It is surprising that Sabur was not with Sukarno 
when the President went out to Halim in the morning. As 
Commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, he was 
usually with Sukarno whenever he went anywhere. The where-
abouts of Gen. Sabur had been one of the questions that 
everyone had been asking all morning. Where was President 
Sukarno? Where was Gen. Sabur? And why was he not at 
Halim if Sukarno was there? 
-37-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
afternoon of the 1st, when Sukarno suddenly had need of 
his confidant, Subandrio was in Medan. Sukarno ordered 
his own Presidential jet airplane, which was normally 
kept at Halim Air Force Base instead of Djakarta's com-
mercial airport for reasons of security, to fly up to 
Medan to pick up Subandrio.* The President may have been 
in communication with Subandrio earlier in the morning 
to tell him of the news of the coup, but this is not 
certain. There is still some confusion about the first 
communication Subandrio received about the coup. Ac-
cording to one story, he received a written note from a 
courier who said he was acting on instructions of the PKI 
representative in the North Sumatran National Front; this 
was about 1000 hours. Apparently, he was not informed 
that Sukarno's personal plane was on its way up to Medan 
to get 'him; he does not seem to have realized that until 
the plane was already there. Sukarno probably did not 
think of sending a plane for Subandrio until the earlyi. 
afternoon, when events made Subandrio's presence at Halim 
suddenly very important to him. 
Sukarno's independence of action at Halim extended 
to the use of the coup-controlled radio to broadcast a - 
Presidential statement to the nation. For everyone listen-
ing to the radio that morning the most puzzling phenomenon 
of the day must have been the fact that the President did 
not speak. The original Untung.announcement had strongly 
suggested that he would soon appear and explain to the 
nation what was going on; but he did not. Finally, at 
1330 hours, an announcement was read over the radio that 
"Sukarno was alive, safe, in good health, and still in 
control of the state and the revolution. It was explained 
that the announcement was made on the authority of General 
Sabur, the commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential 
*It is unclear precisely when the Presidential plane 
left Halim; no one seems to have taken note of the time 
that they heard a plane overhead,'as they did later that 
evening when two planes departed Halim--one carrying Aidit 
and the other Dani--and a third plane landed (it was 
Sukarno's jet returning from Medan). 
-38-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Guard. Later, it was announced that Sukarno had tempor-
arily taken ever the leadership of the armed forces and 
that he had appointed General Pranoto as the "caretaker" 
commander of the army "to carry out the day-to-day busi-
ness of the army."* 
In hindsight, the statement authorized by the Presi-
dent and issued in the name of Gen. Sabur seems to have 
been a move by Sukarno to dissociate himself from a fail-
ing movement. It may not have seemed that way at the time, 
however. Certainly, it was not the strong public endorse-
ment of the coup by Sukarno that the coup leaders evidently 
expected him to make. The President carefully avoided 
committing himself on the coup. It might be presumed, 
however, that he was in agreement with what had been done 
since he did not condemn the action taken against the 
generals that morning. Moreover, in appointing General 
Pranoto as the "caretaker" commander of the army, he 
definitely was acting in the interests of the coup leaders. 
*In the opinion of some observers, Sukarno's appoint-
ment of a "caretaker" commander of the army suggests 4 
that he had definite information that the generals were 
dead. At the time, only the leaders of the coup and 
those directly involved in the killing of the generals 
knew this for sure. Sukarno could only have gotten this 
information from the coup leaders themselves. Suharto 
and the rest of the world, still in doubt about the fate 
of the generals, were quick to seize upon the announce-
ment of Pranoto's appointment as an indication that Sukarno 
had inside information on what had happened to the generals; 
the announcement seemed to confirm their worst fears that 
the generals were already dead. In Sukarno's defense, 
however, it seems that this is not conclusive evidence. 
The President might have appointed a "caretaker" command-
er of the army if he thought that the generals had simply 
been kidnapped and were being held some place. The "care-
taker" commander would be just that; he would take charge 
of the army temporarily, until there was definite word 
about the generals.

The one thing that seemed clear from he announcement 
was that Sukarno was not a prisoner of events. The fact 
that it was an announcement from the President, issued 
with the authority of his trusted security chief, and 
not an "Untung" announcement seemed to indicate that 
Sukarno was not the victim of any sort of coup attempt. 
But though the statement seemed to imply that 
Sukarno approved of the coup, that was not enough to save 
it. At a time when a public endorsement by Sukarno--and 
only that--might well have turned the tide in its favor, 
Sukarno refused to commit himself on the coup explicitly, 
publicly. It is quite clear now that the coup leaders 
felt themselves betrayed by the President, whether they 
had good reason to expect a public statement of support 
from the President or not. Col. Latief is reported to 
have been "very aggressive" in urging General Supardjo 
"to force Sukarno to give his blessings to the movemer�t." 
He indicated that Supardjo should threaten Sukarno if he 
refused. It is clear that he had a radio broadcast by 
Sukarno in mind, as Latief is quoted as saying "Bring 
a tape recorder, so that Sukarno's voice can be taped 
and broadcast," Major Supeno, Commander of the 530th 
battalion, who heard the conversation, drew the conclu-
sion that there was a possibility that Sukarno would be., 
killed if he resisted their pressure. Although it was 
obviously a mistaken judgment, it suggests the amount of 
pressure the coup leaders tried to exert on Sukarno to 
get him to make a public statement of support. At this 
point, however. Sukarno was not about to be found support-
ing a dying movement. He was maneuvering to preserve 
his independence of action whatever the outcome of the 
coup; in the statement broadcast over the radio he hoped 
to re-assert his own authority over the situation without 
committing himself on the events of the past several hours. 
This was, Of course, the turning point of the coup. 
The coup leaders had tried and failed to get Sukarno's 
support at a crucial stage, when their coup plans had 
seriously gone awry with the escape of one of the prime 
targets of the coup and when their last hope lay with 
Sukarno.

Dani Seals His Fate 
Two hours after Sukarno had studiously avoided 
committing himself in public and after the coup was all 
but lost, it was announced over the radio that Air Force 
Chief Dani had pledged the support of the air force to 
the coup. This had been made official in an order-of-
the-day signed by Dani himself.* The explanation for 
what would seem to have been an incredibly poorly timed 
decision on Dani's part was that he had drafted the order 
early in the morning--when he apparently felt so sure 
things were going well that he was willing to commit the 
entire air force organization to the coup--but it was 
not broadcast until that afternoon. - Dani has given the 
following account of his actions that morning: 
I awoke (he had spent the night at Operation� 
Command) at .about 0600, bathed, etc.. till 0630. 
At 0710 I heard the radio news broadcast which 
mentioned the kidnapping of the army generals. 
Between 0730 and 0800 I received a telephone 
call from Major Suparto who said: 'Bapak 
(the President) will be taken to Halim.' I 
wanted to pick him up but Major Suparto would 4 
not allow me. I called Major Sujono to take 
care of the President's security because the 
President was entering Halim. I remained at 
the Operations Command office and did not go 
outside. I then drafted the concept of my 
Standing Order. My custom in drafting an 
order was to draft points. I gave these 
points to Major Willyarto so that they could 
be refined before the order was sent to the 
Department of the Air Force. I told Major 
Willyarto not to broadcast the order yet. 
*Dani's statement appeared in Harlan Rakjat on 2 October, 
but it was announced over the radio before that, on the 
- afternoon of 1 October. It was dated 0930 hours, 1 October 
-41-

(Later) I accompanied the President to the 
house of Commodore Susanto for a rest. He 
ordered the summoning of the Navy and Police 
Force commanders. (After conferring with 
them) he decided to issue a statement. I 
then ordered Major Willyarto: 'My state-
ment may be issued. I need not examine it 
first.'* 
After stating that the coup action had been taken to safe-
guard the revolution and the president against "CIA sub-
version," Dani's order pledged that the air force would 
"always and continuously support and uphold any progres-
sive revolutionary movement and combat any action which 
endangers the Indonesian revolution." With the broad-
cast of the order, Dani's fate was all-but sealed. His 
complicity in the coup was now documented; he could never 
hope to disclaim any involvement as Sukarno had left self
-
self the option of doing. 
Suharto: The Making of a Hero 
It must be remembered that people who had any idea of 
what was going on during the period of Untung's dominance 
were very few. They were nearly all at Halim or KOSTRAD 
headquarters in Djakarta; the few others who were not 
--such as the emissaries going back and forth between the 
two places and the military negotiators whom Suharto sent 
*Dani may have been under the impression that Sukarno 
intended to issue a statement of support for the coup 
rather than the noncommital statement about his still 
being "in control of the state and the revolution." It 
seems that Dani would not have issued his order-of-the-
day pledging the support of the Air Force to the coup 
if he had not thought that Sukarno's statement would 
also commit the President to the 'side of the coup.

to confer with the troops surrounding the Palace and the 
radio station--were not discussing things with the general 
public. 
To the ordinary citizen, things probably seemed 
pretty much as usual. Except for the fact that the tele-
phones were not working, business went on as usual. Only 
a few blocks away from Merdeka Square, one would have 
been unaware of the events taking place a short distance 
away. The streets of Djakarta were not guarded, and no 
curfew or state of emergency was declared. (The next day, 
a curfew was imposed.) One could move around the city 
freely. When the coup was first announced on the radio, 
most of Djakarta's government workers had already arrived 
at their offices. They put in a normal working day. It 
was noted that PKI headquarters was open, as usual; employees 
had been seen coming to work at the normal time. Contrary 
to some reports, the office had not been open all qght. 
Even at Halim Air Force Base, the momentous events 
of the day might have gone unnoticed to an outside observer. 
The principal figures of the coup were quietly secured 
in three inconspicuous homes of air force personnel who 
lived on the base; besides these three homes, only one 
other building was being used by the coup forces--the4 
Operations Command Center, which was normally the center 
of activity on the base. The troops available to the coup 
which were not stationed around Merdeka Square in Djakarta 
were gathered at Lubang Buaja, out of sight of the main 
part of the air base. 
Around Merdeka Square, however, it was a different 
story. Troops were stationed all around the Square. 
Machine guns were set up in front of the U.S. Embassy and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the radio 
station and the telecommunications building, all of which 
fronted on the Square. All the main arteries into the 
square were sealed off, including the railroad station, 
which meant that traffic in the whole area was blocked 
off. Thus, in spite of the heavy concentration of troops 
and the presence of machine guns and other military equip-
ment, there was an almost eerie quietness about everything. 
One could sense the tension in the atmosphere, but on the 
-43-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
surface everything was calm, abnormally calm. American 
observers who watched the events of the day from the win-
dows of the U.S. Embassy, which had a view across Merdeka 
Square in the direction of the Palace, described it as 
"the spookiest day" of their lives. They, like most people. 
had little idea what was going on. Since the telephones 
whren't working, it was impossible to get news as to what 
was happening in other parts of the city. 
As one looked at Merdeka Square, the scene was one 
of seeming inactivity. The only noticeable activity, as 
the afternoon wore on, was that of emissaries and the of-
ficers from KOSTRAD who shuttled back and forth across 
the square; conferring with the commanders of the armed 
units in front of the Palace and radio station.* Suharto 
had taen care to avoid hasty action. With two battalions 
in revolt, stationed just across Merdeka Square from KOSTRAD 
headquarters, he had a potentially explosive situation on 
his hands. He was concerned above all else to prevent 
bloodshed. His strategy would be to try to talk the forces 
surrounding the Palace into surrender. It was a strategy 
of bluff, threat, negotiation, and cajolement--in the tradi-
tional Javanese manner. 
As his first move, Suharto had tried to contact g 
the commanders of the other three armed services to explain 
his strategy to them. He won assurances of help from 
both the naval command and the police force. However, he 
was never able to make contact with Air Force Chief Dani; 
as he later explained: 
*Merdeka Square is too large actually to see across 
it. On its long side, it is about half a mile 1onV. It 
is a huge grassy expanse, with trees that obstruct one's 
vision across it. As mentioned earlier, the location of 
the Palace, Army Headquarters, KOSTRAD Headquarters, 
Gambir Railroad Station, the U.S. Embassy, the telecom-
munications building, the Ministry of Defense, and the 
radio station around this one main square in the center 
of Djakarta makes it a rather unique setup for seizing 
power. All of the vital objectives of a coup attempt are 
right there.

Difficulty was experienced in attempting to 
contact the Air Force. I sent liaison officers 
to Halim...but things did not go as smoothly 
as they had with the Navy and police. They 
had assigned liaison officers to KOSTRAD to 
facilitate communication, but it was not so 
easy to establish coordination with the Armed 
Force. 
Suharto had received an early report that Dani had been 
abducted along with the generals, but about 0800 hours 
he received definite information that this was not true, 
that Dani had been "saved" by his own men, who had picked 
him up at his home about 0200 or 0300 hours and taken him 
somewhere. At this point, Suharto seems to have been more 
confused than suspicious about Dani's whereabouts and 
the reasons for the difficulty in establishing contact 
with the Air Force command. Naturally, he became sy.spi-
cious of the role of the Air Force in the coup when he 
realized that Halim was being used by the Coup forces as 
their center of operations, but apparently it was only 
after Dani's order-of-the-day was broadcast (around 1530 
hours) that he finally accepted the fact of Dani's com-
plicity in the coup. As he said later: 
...Then, Dani made the announcement support-
ing the coup. First the leader of the Air 
Force had been 'saved' before the movement 
had been launched, then it had been difficult 
to achieve coordination with the Air Force, 
and lastly the statement of support had 
been issued. Even a fool could see that 
the Air Force had to be grouped with the foe. 
With pledges of support from the Navy and the police, 
and the run-a-round from the Air Force, Suharto set about - 
the business of winning over the troops of the two battalions 
that were acting on the orders of Untung and associates. 
To help him in the task he assembled various officers who 
had friends in the two battalions or who had commanded 
them at one time or another. One of these was General 
Basukhi Rachmat, the commander of the East Java Terri-
torial Division, who was in Djakarta to brief General 
-45-

Yani on Communist strength in the military in East Java. 
(He had conferred with Yani at the latter's home late 
on the evening of the 30th, just a few hours before Yani 
. was shot and killed in his home.) 
Suharto was able to discover that whereas the com-
ponent units of the 454th and the 530th battalions were 
stationed at different key points around Merdeka Square, 
the commanders of the units themselves--Major Sukirno 
of the 454th and Major Bambang Supeno of the 530th�were 
inside the Palace. (It will be remembered that the two 
commanders had reported to the Central Command at the 
Aerial Survey Office after the troops under their command 
had taken up positions in front of the Palace; from there, 
they had gone with Gen. Supardjo to the Palace to report 
to Sukarno.) Suharto sent special emissaries to the deputy 
battalion commanders and the company commanders left in 
charge. To their astonishment, the rebel troops snaliped 
smartly to attention and saluted as they approached to 
confer with the officers in charge. This was an indica-
tion that at least the ordinary soldiers were confused, 
with no clear idea whom they were serving. The deputy 
battalion commanders told Suharto's emissaries that they 
were there to protect President Sukarno from a coup by 
the Generals' Council. 
Eventually, Suharto himself met with the deputy 
commanders. He assured them that there was no generals' 
coup, that they had simply been tricked into believing 
that when in fact they were being used to protect the 
activities of a coup movement. He explained that the 
Revolutionary Council had suspended the cabinet and 
Sukarno's name was not on the Revolutionary Council. 
Finally, he warned them that if they did not go back and 
collect their men and report to him at KOSTRAD headquart-
ers, he'd be "forced to take drastic action." Within 
about two hours, the 530th Battalion had assembled, 
boarded trucks, and reported to KOSTRAD. With the 454th 
Battalion, Suharto was not so successful. Just as the 
deputy commander was passing on to his colleagues the 
story that Suharto had told him, the battalion commander 
.returned, resumed control, and kept his men working in 
the service of the coup.

At this juncture, the Presidential couriers from 
Halim began to arrive in Djakarta. Apparently, they had 
no trouble in persuading Deputy Prime Minister Leimena 
to go to Halim since the President wanted to confer with 
him there. They also contacted Gen. Umar and Gen Pranoto, 
but Gen. Umar, at least, referred them to Suharto, saying 
that he was acting only on Suharto's orders. The couriers 
then moved on to KOSTRAD headquarters to ask Suharto to 
send Pranoto and Umar to Halim. 
The arrival of the Presi4ntial couriers at KOSTRAD 
headquarters (shortly after noon) and the exchange of 
messages that they delivered was to prove a turning point 
of the coup. Up to this point, Suharto did not know where 
Sukarno was, although it seemed clear that he was not in 
the Palace. Now he realized that the President was at 
Halim, but obviously not there as a prisoner in any strict 
sense, since he had the liberty to send messengerstinto 
the city. His relationship to Untung was ambiguous, but 
the possibility that Sukarno was involved in the kidnapping 
of the generals was now wide open.* 
*According to one source, Suharto's first thought4 
about Sukarno had been that he was dead. Early in the 
morning, as events started to unfold and there was no 
word from Sukarno, Suharto is reported to have figured 
that the coup leaders had learned of the President's 
death and moved quickly to neutralize the Army in the 
struggle for power that was expected after Sukarno's 
death. After Untung's announcement of a provisional 
government, Suharto was in touch with the Sultan of 
Jogjakarta, with whom he discussed the idea of the 
Sultan's going to Bandung to set up a rival government 
there. The Sultan is reported to have advised Suharto 
against this idea until they had more definite informa-
tion on Sukarno. The Sultan apparently had a feeling 
that Sukarno just might be involved in the coup; he 
told Suharto that "the whole thing sounds like Sukarno 
to me." He realized that it would be a mistake to 
announce the formation of a rival government that might 
later seem to have been a move against Sukarno. After 
the coup, the President could have used this as 
(footnote continued on page 48) 
-47-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Suharto decided to send one person--Deputy Prime 
Minister Leimena--to Halim to negotiate with the President. 
He refused to allow Gen. Umar and Gem Pranoto and the 
others whom Sukarno had asked to see to go there, on the 
-grounds that "we have already lost enough generals." 
Actually, Leimena delivered an ultimatum to Sukarno from 
Suharto. Suharto told the President to leave the airbase 
h. 160 hours; if he didn't, the Army would attack Halim.* 
If the couriers gave Gen. Suharto the crucial in-
formation that he needed to take full command of the 
situation, their errand was of equal moment to Sukarno. 
When they returned to Halim with Suharto's flat refusal 
to allow Pranoto or Umar to confer with the President, 
Sukarno realized that Suharto had not -only declared 
against the conspirators but had effectively neutralized 
all the high army officers who might be used to cover up 
the Untung coup. No doubt to his shrewd eye, the sitsp-
tion seemed already hopeless.** It is in the light of 
(footnote continued from page 47) 
evidence that the Army was in fact plotting his overthrow. 
From this point on, Suharto is reported to have acted on 
the assumption that Sukarno might be involved in the cout. 
When he learned later in the day that the President was 
at Halim, he had very definite reason to suspect his in-
volvement. 
*As we shall see, Sukarno did not leave Halim by 1630 
hours and Suharto did not open fire on the airbase, as he 
had threatened. He decided to wait a little longer, in 
the hope of avoiding a direct fight with Sukarno. In the 
end, Leimena was successful in persuading the President 
to go to Bogor. He was the one who talked Sukarno out 
of going to Central Java which Aidit and the other PKI 
leaders were trying to persuade Sukarno to do. 
**An indication of Sukarno's appreciation of the change 
in the balance of forces in the mid-afternoon was the 
"rescuing" of his children from the Palace, where they 
had beOp all day. At about 1600 hours, the children were 
brought out to Halim and from there flown to Bandung, 
out of harm's way. It is clear that Sukarno felt at this 
point that the.Palace would not stay much longer in Un-
tung's hands and the children had to be removed before 
the Army took over there.

the information gained by Sukarno upon the return of the 
couriers that we must understand his decision to announce 
over the radio that he was "well and safe and still in 
control of the state and the revolution"--an announcement 
that seemed to be a move by Sukarno to dissociate himself 
from a failing movement. 
Meanwhile, Suharto had taken advantage of the new 
information that he had acquired to make one final attempt 
to break up the troop formations outside the radio station 
and the telecommunications building. This time he gave 
the 454th Battalion an ultimatum: either it must evacuate 
its positions by 2000 hours or he would blast it out with 
his own guns and troops.* Suharto was still very much 
concerned to avoid bloodshed. By 1800 hours, however, 
he had his troops in offensive position, ready to assault 
the radio station and telecommunications building. 
However, the attack was not necessary. In no mood 
to fight, the rebels quietly withdrew and moved out by 
truck in the direction of Halim; Suharto did nothing to 
hinder their orderly withdrawal. He was only too happy 
to have the center of the city cleared of Coup forces 
without violence. 
*Actually, Suharto was not in a position of overwhelm-
ing military strength in threatening the coup forces in 
Djakarta with an ultimatum. As one of his first moves 
after assuming command of the army, he had called up from 
its base about 15 miles outside Djakarta the crack para-
commando unit (RPKAD) led by Col. Sarwo Edhy. Together 
with a battalion of the Siliwangi (West Java) Division 
that was already in the capital for the Armed Forces Day 
parade on 5 October, the RPKAD units were the only troops 
that he had available at his disposal in Djakarta. He 
couldn't have taken the Palace or the radio station and 
the telecommunications building in the morning or even 
in the early afternoon. Only after the 530th Battalion 
withdrew, late in the afternoon, was he in a position to 
threaten the 454th Battalion, the sole remaining coup for.' 
in the city.

As the withdrawal of these troops proceeded, how-
ever, a new armed force appeared on the scene. Armed 
Communist youths suddenly emerged at the south end of 
Merdeka Square, having come from the direction of Halim, 
it seemed. To their obvious surprise, they were abruptly 
disarmed and arrested by Suharto's forces. They surrend-
ered without a fight. Under interrogation, the Communist 
youths admitted that air force officers at Halim had is-
sued them the weapons with which they were armed and had 
ordered them into the city.* 
This development in the coup has been the subject 
of much distortion. At the time, the presence of such 
armed and undisciplined elenents in the center of the city 
was the cause for genuine alarm on the part of Suharto, 
to whom.it seemed that the PKI and its front groups had 
resorted to arms. More violent events, possibly a general 
attack, in Djakarta or elsewhere, could be expected. Euch 
speculation, based on the involvement of a considerable 
number of Communist youths in a disorganized and pointless 
entry into Djakarta in the late hours of the coup, may 
have been responsible, in part, for the exaggerated reports 
of PKI involvement in the military events of the coup. 
As noted earlier, armed PKI civilians were incorrectly 
--but persistently--reported to have participated in the' 
raids on the generals' homes; they were also supposed to 
have been included among the troops guarding the Palace 
and radio station. When Suharto's forces finally occupied 
the radio station and telecommunications building, they 
apparently did find some of these Communist youth elements 
inside; but they had only just arrived on the scene. It 
is now an established fact that the Communist front groups 
that were armed by the coup leaders as a kind of "reserve 
*Estimates of the numbers of Communist volunteers who 
were sent from Halim into Djakarta vary considerably, 
with some estimates as high as 3,000. We are inclined 
to think that the reports of there being around 3,000 
are exaggerated, although this is the figure most often 
reported. Apparently, not all of the Communist youths 
were armed.

force" were not sent from Halim into Djakarta until late 
in the afternoon. They had played no role in the coup 
up to that point--except as witnesses to the murder scene 
at Lubang Buaja, where they had spent the whole morning 
and most of the afternoon. 
Early that morning, a certain Major Sukrisno of* 
the Air Force whom Major Sujono had personally recruited 
for the special coup assignment of commander of these 
"reserve troops" at Lubang Buaja, had received his orders 
from Sujono to "get weapons from the Air Force ammunition 
depot at Mampang Crossroads" (which was the headquarters 
of the Regional Air Force Command for the Greater Djakarta 
area). Sukrisno was informed that "His Excellency the 
Minister/Chief of Staff of the Air Force (Dani) has in-
formed the Chief of Staff of the Regional Air Command of 
this matter; if he is not there and time is pressing, 
then the ammunition depot there can be broken intol.. A 
vehicle for this purpose will be waiting at the 3rd light 
pole of the Djakarta Bypass." Estimates of the number 
of weapons taken from the Mampang depot and distributed 
to members of Communist front organizations that morning 
range from 300 to 10,000 with 3,000 probably being the 
best estimate. The weapons were all small arms of C9inese 
origin, with the "Chung" trademark stamped on them. The 
Indonesian army was known not to have any weapons of that 
type. There is absolutely no doubt that the arms were 
the property of the Indonesian Air Force. 
We have reliable information that the military 
leaders of the coup--particularly Untung--had strong 
reservations about using the Communist volunteer troops 
in the military operation of the coup. Untung has testi-
fied:

I had not given permission for the use of 
the People's Youth groups (in the raids 
on the generals' homes). My reasons had 
nothing at all to do with the battle ex-
perience and ability of the troops, but 
rather with discipline. If the militarily 
undisciplined and inexperienced troops of 
tht People's Youth were used, a situation 
could develop during the military action 
in which these forces would not obey the 
orders given by the leaders. Whereas what 
we required at the time was a discipline 
dedicated to the carrying out of orders. 
That is why I rejected the idea of using 
the People's Youth. 
As we shall see later, it was the plan of the coup leaders 
to arm these volunteer troops with the thought of using 
them as a "reserve force" to guard Halim Air Force Base. 
However, when Suharto showed energetic opposition to the 
coup, never expected by the leaders of the coup, and when 
Sukarno failed them in their hour of need, panic appar-
ently struck the people at Halim. The handling of defense 
and logistics had proved completely inadquate. Air Force 
units promised had not shown up and neither had a cavalry 
unit. The coup leaders were desperately short of rein-
forcements for the units guarding the Palace and the 
radio station; these units had been on duty since early 
morning, and, among other things they had not eaten all 
day. The hundreds of Communist youth volunteers who 
-52-

awaited orders at Lubang Buaja were neither well trained 
nor experienced and thus were totally unprepared to confront 
army units of proven capability; but it was decided to 
send them into Djakarta anyway, as the only reinforce-
ments available. They were instructed in the use of the 
secret password with which they could identify themselves 
to the coup forces guarding the Palace and radio station. 
When they arrived in Djakarta at Merdeka Square, they 
confidently called out this password; but instead of the 
counter-password, they were greeted with pointed weapons 
and swiftly put under arrest by Suharto's forces. Un-
known to them, the rebel army units previously in the area 
had quietly evacuated to Halim. 
By 2000 hours Suharto was in control of the whole 
downtown area around Merdeka Square. Soon thereafter, 
the radio station broadcast an announcement that it 
had been liberated from counterrevolutionary contrcil by 
the armed forces loyal to Suharto. An official Army an-
nouncement then explained that the coup was definitely 
a counterrevolutionary action, that a number of army 
generals had been kidnapped and the radio station il-
legally occupied, that Suharto had temporarily taken over 
leadership of the army and was now in full control of 
the situation, and that both Sukarno and Nasution were' 
safe. 
At about this time Suharto received a second com-
munication from Sukarno, who asked for a clarification 
of the situation. Suharto sent back the message that 
Sukarno "must move from Halim." Because of the dangei 
of more nonmilitary forces being armed by the Air Force 
and sent into Djakarta from Halim, Suharto had decided 
that he must establish control over the air base that 
night. He said that he would wait for confirmation that 
Sukarno had departed before attacking the base. 
The Collapse of The Coup 
Back at Halim, Sukarno was torn with indecision, 
- as he received conflicting advice from his advisers. By 
-53-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
then, the coup leaders were in a state of desperate gloom 
and making plans to flee. Dani and others urged the Presi-
dent to fly with them to Madiun in Central Java, where 
they could establish a second front. Apparently, Sukarno 
-seriously considered doing this. There is good evidence 
that Aidit fully expected Sukarno to join him when he 
made arrangements for a plane to fly him out of Halim. 
At the last moment, however, Sukarno was talked out of 
the plan. Deputy Prime Minister Leimena, who had been 
summoned to Halim by Sukarno and who had stayed close 
to the President all afternoon, seems to have been pri-
marily responsible for changing Sukarno's mind. He 
argued that Sukarno ought to disentangle himself from 
-the coup and go straight to his palace at Bogor, where 
he normally went every Friday afternoon (and it was then 
Friday evening) to spend the week-end. It is not known 
what words of wifely advice Sukarno may have received 
from Dewi on the matter. She hurried out to Halim byt. 
car and talked with him shortly before he left Halim.* 
*Apparently, Sukarno had left a note for Dewi when he 
left her home early that morning. In it he is reported 
to have said that he had received information from several 
persons about "things that had occurred in the Army thed 
preceeding night." He explained that "the men who were 
carrying out this so-called revolution intended to safe-
guard Bapak and did not intend to oppose him," so Dewi 
should not worry because "Bapak was safe." 
Later, Dewi made the following comments about her 
meeting with Sukarno at Halim that evening: "As regards 
the conversation between Bapak and myself at that time, 
I asked Bapak what he knew about the things that had hap-
pened. Bapak said, as I recall, that there were several 
generals in the Army who wanted to try to stage a coup 
against Bapak and that several other men had learned of 
this before they could do so and had taken action to 
safeguard Bapak. Gen. Pandjaitan and another general (I 
florget whether it was Gen. Harjono or Gen. Parman) re-
sistei arrest and a fight occurred and they were killed." 
. Dewi appears to have been completely unsuspecting of 
any important event in the offing, before the coup. If 
Sukarno did know of the plans for the coup beforehand, 
(footnote continued on page 55) 
-54-

Afterwards, she returned to her home in Djakarta; he 
went on to Bogor, his week-end home which he shared with 
his second wife Hartini. 
Suharto wanted to be very sure that Sukarno was 
safely out of Halim before he ordered any offensive 
action against the base; he recognized the grave conse-
quences of anything happening to the President which 
might be considered his responsibility. At about 2200 
hours he received a long distance call from Bogor saying 
that Sukarno had arrived there. Suharto ordered Col. 
Alex, who was in Bogor, to check out this information 
personally. He found Sukarno in the Palace. 
With the sure knowledge that Sukarno was no longer 
at Halim, Suharto began his move against the last strong-
hold of those forces. He selected the RPKAD paracommando 
unit led by Col. Sarwo Edhy to spearhead the attack on 
Halim. He ordered them to infiltrate the base undef cover 
of darkness and not to shoot unless fired upon. Through-
out the night, the paracommandos quietly surrounded the 
base and infiltrated its perimeter. The only shooting 
incident took place around midnight; Suharto's antiair-
craft units opened fire on an incoming plane, which they 
thought might be bringing supplies to the rebels. It was 
Sukarno's own jet airplane that had been sent up to Medan 
to bring back Subandrio. Subandrio had decided not to 
return to Djakarta, 
(footnote continued from page 54) 
he apparently did not say anything about them to her. 
After the coup, she seemed slow to realize that he might 
have approved of the action taken against the generals 
(she may still not believe that he did); for a long while, 
she seemed honestly not to understand why he did not 
take firm action against those responsible for the mur-
ders. About two weeks after the coup, when Dani and his 
family were living in the Palace under Sukarno's protec-
tion, she is reported to have remarked privately that she 
could not understand why Sukarno was protecting Dani as 
"everyone knows" that he was implicated in the coup. 
-55-

however, so he was not on the plane. It managed to land 
safely without being hit. 
About an hour and a half later (around 0130 hours 
on the morning of the 2nd), another plane was heard over-
head. It was definitely identified by several witnesses 
at the time as a plane of the Indonesian Air Force, but 
only a very few people would have known of its secret 
mission, Just before midnight, General Supardjo, who 
was still acting as the chief liaison between the Central 
Command of the coup at Sgt. Sujatno's house and Dani at 
Halim's Operations Command Center and Aidit at Sgt. Suwadi's 
house, arrived at the Operations Command Center and spoke 
to Dani about an urgent request from Aidit for the use 
of an Air Force planeto fly him to Jogjakarta that even-
ing. Dani immediately arranged for a plane. Col. Latief, 
who happened to be out searching for Maj. Sujono and Sjam 
at the time, actually saw the plane take off; he was told 
that Aidit and his two bodyguards were being flown out 
,to Jogjakarta; he later reported this to Untung when he 
returned to Sgt. Sujatno's house. According to one story 
(told by the sister of the pilot of the plane), Aidit was 
obviously furious about something; at one point, he re-
portedly threw his coat on the ground and stamped on it. 
This story, which may or may not be true, fits nicely � 
with other information we have about Aidit's state of 
mind that evening. Apparently, he was furious at Sukarno, 
who by then had left Halim and was at Bogor. He may have 
had some reason for thinking that Sukarno would accompany 
him to Central Java; as noted earlier, Sukarno seems to 
have considered this seriously and only at the last moment 
to have changed his mind. If Aidit had earlier felt be-
trayed by the President when he failed to make a public 
statement of support for the coup, his sense of outrage 
and betrayal must have been all the more acute when he 
realized that Sukarno had again changed his mind and was 
not going with him. Later, Aidit is reported to have 
said that it was Sukarno who ordered him to flee to Central 
Java and that he was to find a safe hiding place for the 
-56-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
President there.* It is possible that Aidit still had 
some hope of Sukarno eventually joining him in Central 
Java when he left Halim, but he had already lost his best 
chance for success in establishing some kind of a second 
front in Central Java, which we know that Sjam and Pono 
--and presumably Aidit--were arguing for during those 
last desperate hours at Halim--when he failed to convince 
Sukarno to go with him then.** 
Dani fled soon after Aidit. He and Air Commodore 
Leo Wattimena left together on a C-130 Hercules aircraft 
of the Indonesian Air Force. Some five hours later, they 
finally landed at Iswahjudi Air Force Base in Madiun; 
for most of that time, they had been flying around aim-
lessly, as the pilot monitored the security situation at 
Halim and other airbases. 
The Central Command of Untung, Sujono, Latief, 
Sjam, and Pono was now in utter despair. Apparentty, the 
original coup plans had not provided for this particular 
contingency, and Untung and the others seem to have been 
*When Aidit arrived in Semarang on the morning of 
2 October to confer with PKI leaders Lukman and Sakirman 
after the collapse of the coup, he is reported to have 
told them that the purpose of his coming to Central Java 
was "to prepare conditions for moving Sukarno to Jogjakarta." 
Apparently, there was also another occassion on which he 
referred to Sukarno's plans to join him in Central Java; he 
indicated that the President had been the one to suggest the 
idea. 
**Apparently, Aidit and Sjam and Pono had no success 
in convincing Untung and the other military leaders of 
the coup of the possibility of establishing a second front 
in Central Java. According to Untung's testimony in 
court, "Sjam proposed that a follow-up movement be launch-
ed. We made no reply to Sjam's proposal. In general, 
our thinking was very much influenced by the unsuccess-
ful Pasupati Movement (the operation to kidnap the seven 
generals)." 
�57�
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
at a complee loss as to what to do under the circumstances. 
Various sources have reported Untung as being "almost in 
a daze" or "bewildered" or "just sitting around, not doing 
anything." Even Sjam reportedly became confused and seemed 
.unsure what to do; he didn't have the ready answers to 
Untung's questions that Untung had come to expect from 
him. It is not clear what contact Sjam may have had with 
Aidit during those last hours at Halim; it is possible 
tr;at he acted pretty much on his own. 
In part, the lack of decisive leadership from the 
military leaders of the coup can be explained by their 
state of absolute exhaustion after the strain of the day 
and the lack of sleep. But it also strongly suggests 
that they were not really used to making the crucial deci-
sions on matters of such importance. It was almost as 
if they expected someone to tell them what to do in the 
situation. As we shall see later, this was exactly what 
had been the case with respect to Untung, Latief, and 
Sujono. .;Sjam had made all the important decisions, cer-
tainly all the political decisions, relating to the plan-
ning of the coup and he had always decided everything with 
the utmost confidence and assurance. It was not clear 
to Untung and the others whether he made certain decisions 
on his own or whether he checked everything out with Aidit, 
but they felt reasonably sure that Aidit at least knew 
and approved of the main lines of the coup planning. The 
fact that Sjam did not take the same control of the situa-
tion on the evening of the 1st that he had earlier in the 
planning of the coup suggests that either he did really 
panic as his plans for a coup blew up in his face or he 
was not prepared to make the decisions involved without 
first checking with Aidit and there was neither the time 
nor the opportunity for the two men to coordinate a whole 
new plan of action in keeping with the fast-changing cir-
cumstances of the day. Probably, it was a little bit of 
both. Certainly, communications between Aidit and Sjam, 
as the day wore on, were not very frequent, if they oc-
curred at all. There is nothing to indicate that Siam 
knew ahead of time of Aidit's decision to fly to Central 
Java; it appears that he learned of it when Col. Latief 
returned to the Central Command and reported it to Untung 
and the others there. It is somewhat surprising that 
-58-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Sjam did not go with Aidit that night to Jogjakarta. They 
may have had some understanding, however. that Aidit would 
go to Central Java to try to keep the situation there in 
hand while Sjam would stay in Djakarta to help manage 
things there. 
In any case, Sjam left Halim, sometime in the early 
morning of 2 October, in the company of Gen. Supardjo. 
They made their way on foot to the home of a PKI member 
in Djakarta, where they spent that day and night together. 
The next day they went their separate ways. Untung and 
Latief left Halim together, about the same time. For at 
least a week, they stayed together, travelling around the 
environs of Djakarta but apparently not going into the 
city. Sujono seems to have stayed at Sgt. Sujatno's 
house that first night. It would have been natural for 
him to be at Halim, since (before the coup) he was the 
Commander of the Air Force troops assigned to the defense 
of the base. 
At dawn, when Col. Edhy's paratroopers rushed the 
airbase, the leaders of the coup had scattered. Many of 
the troops of the 454th Battalion, which had been evacu-
ated to Halim after its earlier guard duty at the Palace, 
had wandered off during the night.* Those who were ltft 
*From the interrogation reports of the soldiers of the 
454th who left their posts that night at Halim, it seems 
that they had no clear idea of where they were going or 
how they were going to get there. But they now realized 
that they had been tricked into believing that the: were 
defending Sukarno against a coup attempt whereas in fact 
they had been used to defend a coup action. Some had some 
vague idea of returning to their post in Central Java 
but no idea how they would get there; others talked of 
turning themselves in. When Suharto the next day announced 
a general amnesty to all those soldiers involved in the 
coup who promptly turned themselves in, they did just 
that. Thus, none of them got very far from Halim that 
night, before turning around and going back into Djakarta 
to report to KOSTRAD headquarters.

put up practically no resistance. By 0610 hours, Suharto 
had taken Halim--without the loss of a single man. 
Reflections  of the Coup Throughout Indonesia 
As there is a great deal of confusion about events 
connected with the 30 September Movement that occurred 
outside Djakarta. it is important to clarify just what 
hdppEned in cities like Semarang, Jogjakarta, and Solo, 
which followed Djakarta's lead in establishing Revolution-
ary Councils.ds called for in the Decree of the 30 Septem-
ber Movement broadcast from Djakarta at mid-day on 1 October. 
In the three key cities of Central Java, there oc-
curred the same basic pattern of military action followed 
by 4 public statement of support for Ontung's movement 
and an ;announcement of the formation of a Revolutionary 
rouncil. Very shortly after the Untung announcement on 
the radio, Col. Suherman,. Chief of Army Intelligence for 
.Untung had been an intimate confidant of Suherman 
when the latler was Battalion Commander and Untung a 
Company Commander in the Central Java Territorial Divi-
sion. On the two trips that Untung made to Semarang 
after he was transferred to Djakarta in May 1965, he had 
stayed at Suherman's house. Thus, he had last seen Suher-
man about a month and a half before the coup. On the 
second trip in August, he had stopped off in Srondol, 
staying at the home of Major Sukirno, who had succeeded 
Untung as Commander of the 454th Battalion, In his testi-
mony at Untung's trial, Sukrisno stated that there had 
been no discussion of a coup on that occasion. No doubt, 
Sukrisno was telling the truth. Untung himself was not 
brought into the planning for the coup until early Septem-
ber. Most likely, Untung and Suherman never discussed 
the mat:er of the coup, either. Suherman's activities 
on behalf of the coup were almost certainly arranged by 
.the regional bureau of the PKI Special Bureau in Semarang. 
There is no evidence that any of the military officers

Central Java, stationed in Semarang, acting in close col-
laboration with Col. Marjono, chief of personnel, and Lt. 
Col. Sastrodibroto, bureau chief for civil-military rela-
tions, seized control of the Divisional headquarters and 
placed the Commander of the Central Java Division, Gen. 
Surjosumpeno, under arrest.* Sometime around mid-morning, 
Suherman occupied the studio of Radio Indonesia in Semarang 
to broadcast two important announcements: one, that he 
had taken over command of the division and, two, that a 
Revolutionary Council in Central Java had been formed in 
accordance with the Decree of the 30 September Movement. 
Subsequent to the radio announcement from Djakarta, 
a Major Muljono stationed in Jogjakarta went to see his 
commanding officer, Col, Katamso, to urge him to accept 
the Untung proclamation and declare the Jogjakarta Com-
mand behind it. When Katamso stalled, Muljono sent a 
squad of men loyal to him to arrest Katamso and thl.deputy 
commander, Lt. Col. Sugijono.** The two men were taken

coup with military officers in other cities. The PKIt 
Special Bureau would have handled such matters as coordinat-
ing events in Semarang or Jogjakarta or Solo with those 
in Djakarta. 
*Surjosumpeno was able to trick the young officers who 
guarded him into leaving him alone long enough to allow 
him to make his escape from the Divisional Headquarters. 
From there he fled southwards out of Semarang to Magelang, 
where he contacted local military officers. Widespread 
reports that he was one of the victims of the 30 Septem-
ber Movement were not true. 
**Apparently, the troops that were sent to arrest Kat-
amso first looked for him at his home before they went 
to the district military headquarters where they found 
him. The story was spread that, not finding him at home, 
they murdered his wife and 8 children ("brutally chopping 
them to bits"). Again, there was no truth to the story, 
although it is still widely believed, no doubt because 
it has been repeated so often. Katamso and Sugijono were 
killed, however; they were the only victims of the 30 
September Movement in Central Java.

to the army barracks three miles outside Jogjakarta and 
held there all day. Muljono then ordered his troops to 
surround the palace complex of the Sultan of Jogjakarta, 
who happened to be out of town at the time. He also 
seizea the Jogjakarta Radio Station. At 2000 hours Radio 
Indonesia in Jogjakarta began broadcasting support for 
Untung's coup in Djakarta, which was itself now in the 
last stages of collapse. 
Sometime in the afternoon of 1 October, the newly 
appointed commander of the Solo (Surakarta) military 
district, Lt. Col. Ezy Suharto, together with his chief 
-of staff and a brigade commander under him, were put un-
der arrest by a certain Major Iskandar., after they had 
delayed in giving support to Untung's movement. At 1800 
hours, some two hours before Jogjakarta, Radio Indonesia 
in Solo put out a statement on the formation of a 
Revolutionary Council for Solo on the model of the L 
Central Revolutionary Council announced by Untung. This 
initial statement was issued by the Communist mayor of 
Solo, Utomo Ramelan, whom the top leaders of the PKI 
(Aidit, Lukman, and Sakirman) would visit the very next 
day for high-level discussions of PKI policy in the after-
math of the coup's failure. 
Nothing of the sort that happened in Semarang, 
Jogjakarta, and Solo happened anywhere else in Java, 
not even in East Java, where there were many powerful 
centers of Communist strength. According to one uncon-
firmed report, the Governor of Bali is reported to have 
made some statement about the formation of a Revolution-
ary Council for Bali, but nothing more came of it, if in 
fact he ever made such a statement. There was much con-
cern at the time about Sumatra, where the PKI was thought 
to have an impressive capability for paramilitary-type 
activities that could create widespread civil disorder. 
The leftist Governor of North Sumatra, Army General Ulung 
Sitepu, is known to have sent a cable to Djakarta con-
gratulating Untung on his "move to save the Republic" and 
pledging the full support of North Sumatra to the 30

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
September Movement.* But otherwise, there was no observ-
able response from Sumatra to events in Djakarta. The 
city of Medan was quiet; no unusual activity by any group 
was noted at any time after the news from Djakarta was 
first received. There was no evidence of any unusual mili-
tary action in Surabaya, either. In the days after the 
coup, certain wall posters that appeared in Surabaya sup-
porting the coup were suspected to be the work of the PKI; 
otherwise, there was no known PKI activity in support of 
the coup anywhere in Sumatra. Between 2-12 October, about 
150 PKI leaders, plus many ordinary members of the party 
from all areas of Sumatra, went into hiding in the jungle 
mountain areas of North Sumatra, at various prearranged 
locations. It was presumed that they were organizing them-
selves into a para-military force for an all-out showdown 
with the army, but no such showdown ever materialized. 
In keeping with Aidit's policy, they had simply gone into 
hiding until the situation cleared. They never challenged 
the army in any resort to armed force. Several hundred 
of them were finally captured by the army, having put up 
almost no resistance--which was the story of the PKI sur-
render to the army all over Indonesia after the coup. 
But on the day of 1 October, the prospect of mili-
tary opposition from the supporters of the 30 Septemter 
Movement in Central Java and other areas outside Djakarta 
seemed quite real to Suharto. Around 2000-2100 hours, 
messages began to be received in Djakarta from Central 
Java that the radio station in Jogjakarta and Semaral:g 
were in rebel hands. Once Sukarno decided to go to Bog(); 
rather than Central Java, Suharto was free to consider 
his move against the rebel strongholds in Central Java 
without the concern for the President's safety which had 
*On 8 October, after the collapse of the coup, Gov. 
Ulung Sitepu and his wife fled Medan, taking all their 
personal valuables with them. They were reported to have 
gone to the Kabandjahe area where he had a strong left-
ist following. 
-63-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
influenced his decision not to attack Halim until he was 
sure that Sukarno had left the airbase. Suharto's strategy 
of winning over the forces loyal to Untung in Central Java 
was very much the same strategy he had used against the 
troops acting under the orders of the coup leaders in 
Djakarta. He began with what was to prove a long series 
of appeals and countermanding of orders over the military 
telex system and the radio. In a radiogram to Central 
Java he explicitly disavowed Col. Suherman's order to all 
commanders within the Central Java Territorial Division; 
as a former commander of that Division, he was undoubtedly 
hoping to rally loyalties to himself. In the meantime, 
he ordered army units in Central Java to be placed on 24-
hour combat readiness to resist any seizures of govern-
ment authority by the revolutionary councils; otherwise, 
they werenot to take any precipitate action that might 
lead to a civil war.* 
By late afternOon on 1 October the staff officers 
of the Central Java Territorial Command had decided with-
out reservation against the rebel forces of Untung and 
Col. Suherman. The reason that some of the troops appar-
ently hesitated in following the lead of the officers 
was their uncertainty as to Sukarno's position on the 
coup. At the height of the coup fortunes on 1 October, 
the troops of the rebels were estimated to have the 
strength of only one battalion; during the next two days, 
these forces gradually melted away, much as the troops 
of the 530th and 454th battalions deserted the cause of 
the coup in Djakarta and went. over to the side of Suharto. 
*There was never any plan for the use of West Javanese 
or any other non-Central Javanese forces against the rebels. 
Central Java Divisional Commander Surjosumpeno, who had 
escaped from the rebel officers who had put him under 
arrest, felt assured that he could deal with the situa-
tion, and Suharto thought he should be given the chance 
to do so. 
-64-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Semarang was the first of the rebel cities to fall. 
The troops of Suherman had been hearing on the radio about 
the failure of Untungls coup in Djakarta. Suherman's 
authority dwindled rapidly after that. Division Commander 
Surjosumpeno had brought loyal troops to the outskirts 
of Semarang. After "Suharto-Style" negotiations with some 
of the rebel officers, the troops were largely won over. 
On the morning of 2 October, Surjosumpeno re-occupied 
Semarang without a shot being fired. Suherman, Marjono, 
and Sastrodibroto fled with a handful of troops still 
loyal to them.* 
Surjosumpeno began sending tank and paratroop units 
to Jogjakarta and Solo to try to win back the loyalty of 
individual units there. Some crucial battalions were won 
over, but the two cities were still in rebel hands that 
afternoon when the afternoon editions of the newspapers 
in the two cities came out. That afternoon a large demon-
stration supporting Untung's coup took place in the main 
part of Jogjakarta. The major PKI mass organizations were 
restrained from action, but the local Communist youth 
group was conspicious along with other youth groups of 
the other political parties. Apparently Muljono was able 
to influence the Communist youth more than the PKI lead-
ership. Their participation in the demonstration wa.6 to 
prove very damaging to the PKI's effort to claim complete 
non-involvement in the coup. The only bloodshed of the 
coup in Central Java occurred that same afternoon in 
Jogjakarta. Katomso and Sugijono were removed from their 
temporary place of incarceration and taken out of town 
and shot. 
In Solo also, the pro-coup tide was still strong 
on 2 October. Placards indicating support for Untung 
were plastered all over the city. Groups of Communist

vnith wandered about in a vaguely threatening way; almost 
e%eryone else kept off the streets. 
Late in the day of the 2nd, there were signs that 
the tide had begun to change. At 0130 hours on the 3rd, 
Sukarno made his radio broadcast to the nation, and this 
was relayed to Jogjakarta and Solo. Anti-Untung placards 
oegah To appear. By 4 October, the radio stations in 
.ities were in the hands of Surjosumpeno's men, and 
local military commanders arrested by the coup group were 
released unharmed. The situation remained tense but calm 
with both pro-coup and anti-coup groups unwilling to start 
_anything. As we shall see later, Aidit and other top PKI 
leaders were able to move about the city of Solo openly, 
even though it was militarily in Surjosumpeno's hands. 
By the morning of 5 October overt military resist-
ance to Surjosumpeno had ceased throughout Central Ja0a. 
Aside from the murders of the two Jogjakarta army chiefs, 
there had been an astonishing lack of violence. Cities 
and loyalties had changed hands silently and peacefully. 
It had been a game of bluff and counter-bluff, threat and 
counter-threat, appeal and counter-appeal. 
The Coup de Grace for the PKI 
In Djakarta, the outcome of the coup had not hung 
in the balance even the short period of 2-3 days as it 
had in Central Java. By the end of the day on 1 October, 
the coup forces had fled in defeat and Suharto was in full 
control of the situation. Untung had not held the city 
long enough for any sort of mass demonstration of support 
--either spontaneous or otherwise--to materialize. Had 
there been plans for a demonstration, like the one in 
Jogjakarta, for 2 October or the days following, it would 
naturally have been called off in the hopeless situation 
of the utter collapse of the coup. Thus, there never was 
the spectacle of groups of Communists and other leftists 
out on the streets of Djakarta in support of the coup--as 
there was'in Jogjakarta and Solo.

In view of this, one important development of 2 
October is all the more intriguing and mystifying. It 
is the editorial that appeared in the PKI newspaper Harian  
Rakjat, published in Djakarta on the morning of 2 October. 
In its banner headline, Harlan Rakjat claimed that Untung 
had saved President Sukarno from a coup of the generals' 
council. Accompanying the headlines was a crude cartoon, 
showing a mighty fist, labeled 'the 30 September Movement', 
smashing into the face of an Indonesian general. The 
general's pockets were stuffed with money; he had dollar 
signs for epaulettes; his shoulder badges showed him to 
be a member of the Council of Generals; and his cap was 
stamped with CIA; propping him up was a particularly un-
pleasant-looking Uncle Sam. Next to the cartoon, on the 
front page, was a brief editorial, only 202 words in length, 
which condemned the Generals' Council and called Untung's 
action "a patriotic and revolutionary measure." Although 
it claimed that the "nature of the action was an igternal 
army matter," the editorial expressed the thought that 
"the sympathy and support of the people" ought certainly 
to be for the coup.* On the whole, it was a rather cautious 
editorial, but this was really beside the point; the dam-
age had already been done simply by going on record in 
support of the coup. In but 202 ill-advised words, which 
gave the coup the PKI's public endorsement, Harian Rakjat 
had provided the army with the documentary justification 
for the PKI's own obliteration. 
*The PKI was shrewd in deceiving the public into think-
ing that the 30 September Movement was nothing more than 
an internal problem of the Army. The coup had been de-
liberately staged to look that way, for instance, in the 
selection of Untung as the nominal leader of the coup. 
His first public proclamation of the coup emphasized the 
point that the coup was an internal matter within the 
army. The Harian Rakjat editorial simply picked up the 
theme that had already been decided on as the cover story 
for the coup. It proved to be a convincing cover story 
that was accepted by many people at the time.

In keeping with the paper's normal publishing 
routine, the 2 October morning edition was probably set 
and printed late the previous afternoon.* At that time, 
events seemed to be going well enough for the coup forces 
that the newspaper's editors would have felt confidence 
enough in expressing such an opinion. As far as the tim-
ing is concerned, they could have been reacting to events 
as they happened, but it seems clear that they were actu-
ally prepared for events to the extent of having the edi-
torial ready for publication before 1 October. It is 
doubtful that the editors would have taken a stand on a 
matter of such importance except on the direct orders of 
the Politburo--or Aidit himself--which would almost have 
to have been agreed upon before the coup. The editorial 
reflects a cautious-but-positive attitude which would 
have appealed to Aidit and suggests that he may even 
have written it himself. For these reasons, which can 
be deduced from the editorial as it appeared and whentit 
appeared, it would seem that the PKI must have had fore-
knowledge of the coup. Considering all the other evid-
ence we have that the PKI not only had foreknowledge of 
the coup but was deeply involved in planning the affair, 
it is obvious that the editorial was part of the planning 
from the beginning. The editorial stressed the point 
that the coup was purely an internal army affair which 
*Apparently, the 2 October edition of Harlan Rakjat  
was on the newstands at the regular time on the morning 
of 2 October, which suggests that it was printed as usual 
the afternoon before. One other newspaper that appeared 
on 2 October--Suluh Indonesia--was published later than 
usual that day. Although it was stated that it was due 
to "technical difficulties", obviously, it was due to the 
coup. Suluh Indonesia's reaction to the coop ifi interest-
ing. It headlined its support and that of the PNI for 
Sukarno and denied knowing anything about the presence 
of PNI people on Untung's revolutionary council. In this 
way, it avoided taking a direct stand on the coup, in 
contrast to the stand taken by Harian Rakjat. 
-68-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
was the same point that Untung made in his first public 
announcement of the coup. Obviously, this was the story 
invented by the PKI to cover up PKI involvement in the 
coup. The editorial in Harian Rakjat was simply part of 
PKI planning ahead of time to have it accepted as the real 
explanation for the coup. 
There is still the unanswered question of why the 
PKI leaders who were responsible for Harian Rakjat did 
not stop its distribution early on the morning of 2 October 
when they must have realized that the coup had failed 
miserably. Though the newspaper would have been printed 
and ready for distribution, they could certainly have pre-
vented its circulation. The fact that they did not was 
probably because they were acting on previous instructions 
from Aidit or the Politburo and they were not prepared 
to do anything different without new instructions on the 
matter. In the confusion of the moment, Aidit obviously 
did not have the time or the opportunity to contact the 
editors of Harian Rakjat, if the matter of the editorial 
even occurred to him. He was totally occupied at the time 
with more important matters, such as trying to get Sukarno 
to go with him to Central Java--and when that failed, with 
the matter of his own flight to Central Java, his personal 
safety, and his urgent need to contact Lukman and other 
top PKI leaders to decide on party policy in the emergency 
situation of the coup's collapse. 
Whatever the reason, the publication of the 2 Octo,.. 
edition of Harian Rakjat with its editorial endorsing the 
coup was an act of political suicide. In this instance, 
the practice of democratic centralism within the party, 
which normally gave the party a certain strength because 
of its ability to react quickly to change (since it was 
totally responsive to the will of the central leadership), 
worked against the party, since various leadership levels 
within the party waited for orders from above instead of 
acting on their own according to their own best judgment 
of the situation. When the chain of command\broke down 
--as it did on the night of 1 October--the party was all 
but paralyzed and suddenly made very vulnerable to attack.

The Postlude 
The Indonesian coup of September 1965 may well 
prove to be one of the most significant events of the 
post-war period. The political repercussions of the coup 
have not only changed the whole course of Indonesian 
history but they have had a profound effect on the world 
political scene, especially that of Southeast Asia. 
In the three years since the coup we have seen in 
Indonesia (1) a massive purge of the Communist party 
organization in which thousands of people lost their 
lives in one of the ghastliest and most concentrated 
bloodlettings of current times,* (2) the toppling of 
President Sukarno, who before the coup had the stature 
of a demigod on the Indonesian scene, and (3) a compApte 
turnabontt in the country's international alignment--
from that of being one of Communist China's closest 
allies in growing estrangement from the rest of the 
world and one of the harshest critics of the West to 
a new posture of being a friend of the West, seeking 
the goodwill of all other nations of the world except 
Communist China. These developments have al/ come about 
as a direct result of the coup. In a sense, they are 
really part of the story of the coup. But since each is 
also a story in itself and since this paper is intended 
to focus on the coup itself, they will not be treated in 
detail. Only those post-coup developments that seem to 
shed more light on the actions or intentions or sympathie= 
of the main actors in the coup will be included in this 
brief postscript to the coup. 
*Estimates of the number of people killed in Indonesia 
in the anti-PKI bloodbath after the coup range from 87,000, 
the official Indonesian government estimate, to 500,000. 
The figure of 87,000, which is the figure the official 
commission appointed by Sukarno to investigate the anti-PKI 
massacres accepted as the best estimate of the number of 
people killed, is probably too low. The U.S. Embassy esti-
mated the figure to be closer to 250,000. It would be a 
Mistake to put too much faith in any of the various esti-
mates. It was impossible, even at the time, to get occur-ate 
figures of the number of people killed in one neighborhood.

As with the actual events of the coup, which were 
treated in the preceding section, the post-coup development 
discussed in this section are, for the most, matters of 
established fact; they are part of the record against 
which we must examine the words and testimony of various 
individuals as to their role in the coup. 
The Central Command in Hiding 
The five men who composed the Central Command of 
the coup, who had emerged from obscurity to play the main 
role in a drama of unforeseen consequence, disappeared 
from the scene altogether as quickly as they had first 
appeared. After midnight on the 1st of October, they 
played no further part in influencing the course of events. 
They were hunted men, the object of an immediate apd un-
relenting search by the Army for all those responsible 
for .the coup. Their-one and only concern became that of 
self-preservation. They were constantly on the move, and, 
(footnote continued from page 70 ) 
Since it wasn't safe to travel around in Indonesia in those 
days, many areas were never visited by anyone interested in 
determining the number of people killed. Thus, there never 
was--and never will be--a reliable figure of the numbers 
dead as a result of the Indonesian coup. Undoubtedly, vast 
numbers were killed. The killings in Java alone put the 
Mau Mau massacres and the killings in the Congo in the 
shadow, although the latter got much more publicity. In 
terms of the numbers killed, the anti-PKI massacres in 
Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 
20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930's, 
the Nazi mass. murders during the Second World War, and the 
Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950's. In this regard, the 
Indonesian coup is certainly one of the most significant 
events of the 20th century, far more significant than many 
other events that have received much greater publicity.

as the army search for them intensified, it became harder 
and harder for them to find safe places to hide; when , 
they did, they were virtually confined to that place, day 
in and day out. General Supardjo, who evaded capture 
-longer than any of the other military officers involved in 
the coup (he was finally arrested in February 1967), has 
described the torture of his life as a fugitive for almost 
one and one-half years. During the whole time, he found 
only two or three occasions to communicate with former 
coup associates who were also in hiding. 
Sjam came to the house twice but didn't stay 
there. Apparently he was dodging raids and 
discussing the security of various people. I 
didn't have any discussions with him. 
I moved around to various houses in Djakarta. 
I changed identity cards. I practically nevert 
went out. I was introduced as a relative of my 
various hosts. During all that time I never 
left Djakarta. People with whom I lived financed 
me. Once, for a period of one month, I ate nothing 
but rice and slept on the floor on a mat and an 
old pillow. 
Once I was able to send a message to my family 
in Bandung; they replied only that they were all 
right. I never saw them. 
For nine days after the coup, Untung and Latief 
travelled around the countryside outside Djakarta. The 
next d,ly Latief was arrested in his wife's home in Dja-
karta. Untung headed for Central Java. Two days later, 
*Apparently, Latief was shot in both legs before he was 
captured. An infection is reported to have developed, re-
sulting in the amputation of both legs. Although there has 
never been any confirmation of �this, it is interesting that 
Latief never appeared at any of the court trials. He was 
not given a trial like Untung, Dani, Subandrio, Sudisman, 
Sjam, and the others, and his testimony at other trials, 
such as Untung's trial, was written testimony. There has 
been no reliable report on his physical condition from 
one who has seen him in prison. He may still be alive, out 
it is thought that he was probably one of the four military 
leaders of the coup (one of whom was Untung) who were exe-
cuted in December 1967.

he was recognized by two soldiers (though he was wearing 
civilian clothes) as he rode on a public bus which was 
on its way to his home town, and he too was arrested. 
He has described his travels after the coup: 
From the time that I left Lubang Buaja up to 
11 October I remained out of Djakarta, but I 
kept going around and around between Polonia, 
Djatinegara, and Utan Kaju together with Col. 
Latief.* On 10 October Col. Latief requested 
that he and I split up and thus I split from 
Col. Latief, and on 11 October I and Damiri 
left Djatinegara for Krawang and then went 
directly to Tjikampek where we spent the night. 
Between 12-13 October I went to Central Java 
but on 13 October I was arrested by the Tegal 
Branch of HANSIP in Tegal . . . and taken to 
Bandung . . . and from there by armored car t. 
to Djakarta, where I have been under interrogation 
According to one account of Untung's capture, which is prob-
ably apocryphal, the first words that Untung spoke after he 
was taken into custody were "That fellow Bung Karno (Sukarno) 
has let me down."** 
Air Force Major Sujono was captured next, sometime 
around 15 October, though the circumstances of his arrest 
are not as well known. After these early arrests of 
three of the five men comprising the Central Command, 
it was almost a year and a half before the Army captured 
General Supardjo. He has commented as follows on his 
activities during that time: 
Sjam and I left Lubang Buaja and headed south 
toward the highway. I was wearing civilian 
*Polonia, Djatinegara, and Utan Kaju are suburbs of

in the area between Djakarta and Halim for over a week 
after the coup.

clothes. We boarded a small bus headed for 
Djakarta. We got off at the Tjitjih building 
and Sjam took me up an alley to a house behind 
the building. There Sjam and I separated. I 
had hoped that Sjam would take me to Sukarno 
so that things could be settled further. 
I was transferred to another house. The house 
probably belonged to one of the two civilians 
who were at the Central Command. 
I still had the letter from the President*.... 
My conversations with Marto Suwandi (in whose 
house Supardjo lived for a while) dealt mainly 
with my efforts to meet with Sukarno. My only 
intention was to discuss the follow-up to the 
dispersal of the troops , since I had been given 
the assignment (by the President) of dissolving 
the troops of the 30 September Movement. How-
ever, it was impossible to meet with Sukarno. 
I wrote a letter to the President saying that 
Sukarno's order had been carried out and the 
troops dispersed and explaining that this move-
ment was not solely of a military nature since 
many of the people were involved. I asked the 
President to make a radio announcement which 
would allow me to meet safely with him. I 
gave it to another man, but there was no reply. 
I was considering being dropped pear the palace 
and working my way in, but Suwandi didn't agree. 
No answer ever came from the palace. 
I wrote letters to the commander of KOSTRAD and 
the Army caretaker commander saying that I had 
not been consulted about the inclusion of my

signed order which Sukarno is reported to have given Supardjo 
on the dispersing of the troops after the decision to stop 
the 30 September Movement had been made.

name on the list of members of the Revolutionary 
Council and that it should be stricken from the list. 
I was convinced that the situation would get better. 
I depended completely on the President. 
Once in mid-September 1966, Sudisman (the PKI leader) 
came to Suwandi's house. We talked about the security 
problem. They wanted to stay at Suwandi's house 
because this house seemed to be the safest, but I 
refused them. We also talked about the coup. Sudisman 
said the failure of the coup was due to the rashness of 
Aidit and his followers. I told him the problem was 
one of exploiting victory. It should not have been 
stopped when Sukarno so ordered. The Central Command 
lacked military technique. There was no unity of 
command, what with Untung, Sjam, and the others; and 
logistics were disorganized. We did not disst,iss the 
matter of rebuilding the PKI. I have never been a 
member of the PKI. The inclusion of my name (in the 
Revolutionary Council) was their doing. 
Supardjo's capture led to the arrest of Sjam in early 
March 1967 in Tjimahi, West Java, a small town near Bandung. 
On PKI orders, Sjam had left Djakarta within a week of' the 
coup and taken refuge in Bandung; he had left there for Tjimha 
only two days before his capture. During the months in hiding, 
he had been able to contact the new PKI leadership in Djakarta 
only three times--at the end of 1966, in January 1967, and in 
February 1967--if we are to believe Sjam's own testimony on 
these matters (and this writer at least, is prepared to accept 
Sjam's statements in this regard, for the reasons given on 
pages 311-316*). In mid-1966 Sjam had learned of the party 
leadership's decision to dissolve the Special Bureau, which he 
had headed, and transfer its functions to the West Java Greater 
Regional Committee. In reply to an inquiry regarding his status, 
he was informed that he was released from all responsibilities 
as Chief of the Old Special Bureau; it was emphasized that his 
safety was a matter of continuing concern to the party leader-
ship. In his last communication with the party leadership, 
Sjam forwarded certain suggestions he had on the new organiza-
tion of the party to the PKI leaders in Djakarta. 
*In addition to the general comments .on the validity of 
interrogation reports as evidence that are made in the Appen-
dix (pp. 311-316), there are one or two particular comments that 
should be made in the case of Sjam. Once the Army got Sjam to

As is well known, the complete reorganization of 
the party on a new covert basis had been forced upon the 
party after the virtual obliteration of its former overt 
leadership by the army after the coup. By the time Sjam 
was arrested in March 1967, four of the five members of 
the Standing Council of the Politburo and six of the ten 
members of the full Politburo had been killed. Njono, 
the Chief of the Greater Djakarta Committee of the PKI 
and a member of the Politburo who, as we shall see, was 
directly involved in the coup (he was in charge of PKI 
"operational-technical" preparations for the coup, such 
as the arrangements for the training of a PKI reserve 
-force to be used in the coup) had been the first impor-
tant Communist leader to be arrested after the coup. He 
had not gone into hiding immediately after the failure 
of the coup as the other PKI leaders had done, but had 
continued to show up every day at the party headquarters 
in Djakarta. His capture on 5 October 1965 preceded title 
arrests even of the military officers who had been the 
nominal leaders of the coup. In February 1966, Njono 
was the first tried in court and sentenced to death for 
his involvement in the coup. 
(footnote continued from page 75) 
talk, it seems that he was almost anxious to tell everything 
that he knew about the coup--almost out of a sense of pride, 
it seems. At his trial, he actually boasted that he was 
"the brains behind the 30 September Movement." Whatever 
his motivation, he was the most cooperative of witnesses 
and his testimony has been well borne out by tbe testimony 
of other people involved in the coup. One independent fact 
that seems to confirm the reliability of his testimony is 
the fact that he was denounced as a traitor by the PKI after 
his capture and interrogation by the Army. According to 
reliable sources, PKI party members were informed of Sjam's 
treason to the party at secret party meetings in late 1967. 
Those who could be compromised by Sjam were warned to take 
special precautions since it would have to be assumed that 
he had told the Army everything that he knew about the coup 
and the secret operations of the PKI.

The main blow to the PKI was, of course, the arrest 
and execution of Aidit, which came fairly early in the 
course of arrests made by the Army of PKI leaders--on 
22 November 1965. Soon after that, Lukman and Njoto, 
the number two and number three men in the PKI leadership, 
were killed escaping capture. Sudisman, the fourth-ranking 
leader of the PKI, was captured by the army, tried in court, 
and sentenced to death. Sakirman, the fifth member of the 
Standing Council of the Politburo, was killed later that 
same year, in November 1966. 
Aidit's Last Days  
Aidit's capture and summary execution--on 22 November 
1965--by paracommando units of the Army under General Sarwo 
Edhy climaxed weeks of search-and-destroy operation p against 
the Communist3in Central Java after the coup. This opera-
tion alone was enough to make national heroes of the 
paracommandos who organized the raids on the homes of 
known Communists throughout the area, leading finally to 
the arrest of Aidit in Sambeng Gede, a small town near 
Semarang in Central Java. Aidit's travels after the coup 
up to his death are a fascinating story and are also of 
considerable interest to anyone studying the coup. 
About two hours after he left Halim by plane, Aidit 
arrived in Jogjakarta, sometime around 0400 hours on the 
morning of 2 October. From there, he was driven by a 
certain Air Force Major Sudarjo to the home of Sutrisno, 
an important local PKI leader. Aidit is reported to have 
warned Sutrisno to call off any demonstrations he might 
have planned and at all costs not to allow the PKI to be 
.provoked into violent action. He said that the PKI 
should indicate complete, unconditional support for any 
policies the President might announce. 
Aidit left Jogjakarta for Semarang almost immedi-
ately, travelling in a black Fiat 1300 seda, dressed as 
a Moslem in a sarong and black pitji (hat). At 0800 hours 
*Aidit was disguised as a religious teacher with a sarong 
wound around his waist, a white shirt with short sleeves, and 
dark glasses. He had abandoned the white suit with the 
three gold stars, the uniform used by cabinet ministers, 
which he apparently loved to wear.

he arrived at number 14 Dempo Street in Semarang, which 
was the home of an important PKI leader who was responsible 
for all of Central Java. His objective was to contact 
Lukman and Sakirman, the number two and number five men 
in the party hierarchy, whom he knew to be staying at that 
house. (Aidit himself had ordered Lukman and Sakirman to 
go to Semarang just before the coup so that they would be 
safely out of Djakarta and in a position to influence events 
in Central Java; they had left Djakarta by car on the evening 
of 28 September and arrived in Semarang the next day around 
noon.) Soon after Aidit arrived at the designated house 
in Semarang, so too did Sujono Atmo, the Acting Governor 
of Central Java, a known Communist sympathizer whose posi-
tion would allow him to do much to keep the overall situation 
in control. Sujono Atmo joined in the.. discussions between 
Aidit, Lukman, and Sakirman. After about an hour, all four 
set off in the direction of Solo (Surakarta) in Sujono Atmois 
official limousine. They stopped only once in Bojolai.i, 
for an hour, to brief a prominent local PKI official. 
Once in Solo, they went straight to the home-,of;Com-
munist Mayor Utomo Ramelan. Presumably lengthy discussions 
were held with Ramelan along the same lines as those Aidit 
had had with other PKI officials that day. That evening 
the Commander of the Panasan airbase just outside Solo was 
summoned to Ramelan's home. He came, but apparently not 
without some misgivings--as by now the PKI was under general 
suspicion for its role in the coup. In the course of the 
evening's discussion, Aidit reportedly requested the use 
of a plane to fly to Bali. Lieutenant Colonel Sujoto 
refused, on the excuse that none was available. He did 
promise to deliver a letter to Sukarno for Aidit; but the 
following morning--perhaps influenced by Sukarno's radio 
broadcast early on the morning of 3 October--he appears 
to have decided that it would be best not to associate 
further with Aidit, and he returned the letter to him. 
Aidit was busy in Solo the next day and the days 
following that. He toured the villages of Baki, Sewu, 
and Djagalan, all situated around Solo, and he may have 
travelled as far as Madiun and Kediri to visit other 
centers of PKI strength. In every place, he told the 
people who assembled to hear him that there must be no

demonstration of support for the coup; and in none of the 
places he visited was there ever any movement or activity 
or demonstration on behalf of the coup. He was obviously 
completely successful in getting the people to follow his 
policy--a policy of wait and see. A tense and watchful 
stillness reigned everywhere, but there was no sign of 
PKI activity anywhere. 
Sometime before 5 October, Aidit presumably drafted 
the statement that was issued on the morning of the 5th 
by the PKI information bureau in Djakarta. The statement 
was the strongest denial of PKI participation in the coup 
that the party was ever to claim. It stated explicitly 
that the PKI was not involved in the coup, that the coup 
leaders had not requested the approval of party members 
whose names werelincluded in the revolutionary council; 
that the coup was purely an internal affair of the army. 
Besides the obvious intent to dissociate the PKI frpm the 
coup, the statement was intended to strengthen Sukarno's 
hand in settling the matter, rather than the Army; the 
PKI had good reason to fear that the Army would use the 
coup to gain the upper hand against Sukarno. After all, 
if the coup was strictly an internal army matter, as the 
PKI claimed, it was logical for the Army to insist on its 
own right to settle the matter. Aidit wanted the coup 
accepted, on the one hand, as an internal army affair in 
which the PKI had played absolutely no part and, on the 
other, as a political matter which only the President 
could solve. The 5 October PKI statement expressed the 
full support of the party for whatever political settle-
ment Sukarno announced. It is interesting to note him 
similar this statement was to Aidit's instructions to 
Sutrisno and other PKI officials with whom he talked in 
Semarang and Solo. The same points *ere also stressed 
in a letter he is reported to have written to the East 
Java Regional Committee on 2 October--all of which sug-
gests that the 5 October PKI statement was also drafted 
by Aidit. In essence, it was the message that he carried 
to the PKI wherever he travelled after the coup.

On 4 October Djakarta Radio had broadcast the news 
that there would be a plenary session of the Cabinet at 
the palace in Bogor on 6 October, which all Ministers 
were urgently requested to attend. It was decided that 
Aidit and Lukman would both attend. Early on the morning 
of 5 October Lukman set off for Djakarta in his own of-
ficial limousine. Stopping only in Pemalang near Brebes 
to talk to local PKI cadres, he reached Djakarta about 
1530 hours that same day. The next morning he proceded 
to Bogor, where he made his last public appearance. 
It is unclear why Aidit did not also travel to 
Djakarta by car (possibly it was for security reasons). 
In any case, he was apparently determined to make the 
trip by plane; but once again he was frustrated in his 
travel plans. On 4 October he urged Mayor Utomo Ramelan 
to go with him to visit the commander of Panasan airbase 
again. Once again Colonel Sujoto refused to give hint, 
an airplane to go to Djakarta to attend the cabinet meet-
ing. About 1500 hours the next afternoon (5 October) 
Aidit and Ramelan made a last forlorn appearance at 
Panasan; but Sujoto found new reasons for being unco-
operative. Aidit and Ramelan left the base soon after-
wards, and Aidit at least was never seen in public again. 
For six weeks Aidit lived in hiding'in Central 
Java, moving around between Solo and Semarang. If he 
ever had any serious thought of fleeing Indonesia or 
escaping to a more remote area of the country--some 
sources claim that he thought of going to Bali, among 
other places--he did not get very far. In Central Java, 
which was the area where the PKI had its greatest strength, 
Aidit had a rather remarkable defense organization. 
Trained and armed workers of the PKI and its youth orga-
nizations formed a kind of private army whose special 
duty it was to provide complete safety for Aidit. There 
was an elaborate warning sytem to signal the arrival of 
outsiders in the town in which Aidit was hiding. Thus, 
he always had time to escape when army units appeared on 
the scene to raid the homes in a certain district.

The story of Aidit's capture provides a fascinating 
story in the literature of successful intelligence oper-
ations. It involves an agent of the Indonesian army 
intelligence service who managed to penetrate Aidit's 
.:lose circle of bodyguards. After several incidents which 
were calculated to win Aidit's complete confidence, "Agent 
II" at one point had Aidit hiding in his own home. In a plan 
that Aidit was working on at the time of his capture--a 
plan of escape to Djakarta in which Aidit was to don 
an air force uniform with complete identification letters 
and be driven to Djakarta in a Russian-built jeep of the 
Air Force--"Agent H" was to be his sole companion on 
the trip. At the last moment, however, Aidit apparently 
became suspicious. 
Suddenly, he asked the unsuspecting 'Agent 11' to 
take him back to Sambeng Gede where he had been 
hiding safely and receiving extraordinary protec-
tion from his followers working for the railroad 
that had a depot in the neighborhood. 'Agent H' 
could not refuse without causing greater sugpicion 
. . . The slyness and fine strategy of 'Agett H' 
had lured Aidit out of this beloved hiding place. 
He had moved to H's house which he had thought 
safer, but he was now full of suspicions. 'Agent 
H' had made it easier to catch Aidit. 
At 2000 hours in the evening of 22'November the biggest 
military contingent ever used in a raid on Communist homes 
entered Sambeng Gede. Every house was searched. 
Aidit was found hiding in the house of one 
Hardjo-Sumartono in a secret room of only one 
yard width. It was entered by a small door 
from the dining room. A cabinet stood in front 
of the door and hid it completely. Before the 
soldiers reached the house they had to pass the 
railroad depot with workers faithful to Aidit. 
They blew the whistle of a locomotive to give 
Aidit time to get into his hiding place should 
he be outside the secret room. 
But inside Hardjo-Sumartono's house, the soldiets noticed 
a pair of sandals beside the dining room cabinet. They 
moved the cabinet, and out crawled D. N. Aidit.

Various documents have been presented which pur-
port to be Aidit's interrogation report; but they all 
appear suspect. It is extremely doubtful that Aidit 
would have "confessed" to any of the things mentioned in 
the reports. A rather lengthy "self-criticism" of PKI 
strategy at the time of the coup--which was first published 
in the Japanese press and attributed to Aidit--is more obvi-
ously faked. It is not at all Aidit's style, nor is it 
his thinking. There is no convincing evidence that Aidit 
submitted to interrogation or signed anything during the 
time he was held prisoner by the army.* Probably within a 
matter of hours--of a day, at the longest--he was executed 
by shooting. The army has never given any of the details 
of Aidit's death or burial, which might have been used by 
those wanting to make a martyr out of him. 
The only document of those purportedly written by 
Aidit after the coup that does appear genuine is a leiter 
from Aidit to Sukarno, written in Solo on 2 October (it 
will be remembered that Aidit asked Lieutenant Colonel 
Sujoto to deliver a letter to Sukarno that evening). It 
is not clear exactly how Aidit finally managed to have 
it delivered to Sukarno, but apparently the President 
received it on 6 October. Lukman could have brought it. 
with him when he returned to Djakarta, after having been 
with Aidit in Central Java; he saw Sukarno at the cabinet 
meeting at Bogor on the morning of 6 October. In the 
letter, Aidit notes that he is in good health and then 
goes on to describe the coup as an internal army affair 
in which the PKI should not meddle (although he states 
his approval of such a "cleaning of the revolutionary 
apparatus" and his condemnation of the General's Council). 
He then recommends to Sukarno that he issue a presidential 
directive along the following lines: 
*A PKI member who was a companion of Aidit in hiding was 
later interrogated by the Army. He is the source of much 
of the information on Aidit after the coup, such as the 
report that Aidit received a communication from Sukarno 
around the middle of November (discussed on the following 
page). Apparently, some of the information that this 
source provided was, either deliberately or not, but in 
any case, wrongly attributed to Aidit himself. At a ple�ry 
meeting of the cabinet in Bogor on 15 January 1966, Sukarno 
officially denied the validity of reports dealing with 
the interrogation of Aidit, 
-82-

1. The settlement of the problem of the 
30 September Movement lies solely in 
the hands of the President. 
2. Calm is required to reach a settlement. 
3. All instruments of the revolution, particu-
larly the armed forces and political 
organizations, and the press and radio 
should operate as they did before the 
30 September Movement. 
4. Security problems should be turned over 
to the police. 
5. Mutual faultfinding and the making of 
charges and counter-charges should be 
forbidden. 
The specific points are interesting inasmuch as they are 
precisely the lines of action Sukarno tried to follow 
after the coup. In almost every respect, they are com-
pletely contrary to the program of action urged on the 
President by the army. 
According to a PKI member who was Aidit's com-
panion in hiding and who was later interrogated by the 
Army, President Sukarno answered Aidit's letter via a 
courier in mid-November. Sukarno is reported to have 
told Aidit that he was not yet able to make the kind of 
speech Aidit recommended, that he was only able to make 
speeches of a general nature. He said that he was "trying 
to change the thinking of the commanders so that they will 
think about something else besides the 30 September Move-
ment." Sukarno is also reported to have told Aidit that 
he should not remain in Solo any longer: "Leave there 
quickly and try as hard as you can to get back to Djakarta. 
A pickup would encounter technical difficulties." 
No other source has reported that Sukarno sent a 
reply to Aidit's letter, so the information is unconfirmed. 
However, it is quite possibly true. We know that just 
-83-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
before his capture (which would have been just after he 
received Sukarno's communication) Aidit was working on 
a plan that would enable him to travel to Djakarta. This 
suggests that he was following Sukarno's advice soon after 
he received it. If it is true that Sukarno advised Aidit 
to "get back to Djakarta," it suggests that -Sukarno may 
have had some idea of offering him Presidential protection, 
such as he offered Dani in allowing him to live at the 
palace after the coup, or of providing him a means of 
escape from Indonesia, which he also provided Dani and 
which Aidit was unable to arrange himself. Otherwise, it 
seems that Aidit would have been much safer in Central Java 
-than in Djakarta. 
Dani Under Sukarno's Protection 
Before we look at Sukarno's actions after the coup, 
there is one other important participant in events at Halim--
Air Force Chief of Staff Dani--whose actions after the coup 
are of interest in connection with the coup. When President 
Sukarno rejected Dani's request that they leave Halim and 
go together to Madiun, Dani was forced to go on without him. 
After he landed at Iswahjudi Air Force Base in Madiun, some-
time around 0600 hours on the morning of the. 2nd, he gave 
a briefing to the officers on duty there, at which he is 
known to have said that the President was at Halim almpst 
all day, the day before, and that he (Sukarno) had rer.:eiv, 
a report on the coup from General Supardjo personally, whotA--
Dani added--Sukarno patted on the back when he finished 
giving the report. That afternoon Dani flew back to Semplak 
Air Force Base in Bogor, with the obvious intention of re-
joining Sukarno, who was at his week-.end retreat at the 
palace there. At a second briefing session for Air Force 
officers at Semplak, Dani refused to explain the whole 
incident of the coup because, he said, "it would bring in 
the name of the President."* 
*Two weeks later, Dani is reported to have called a meet-
ing of Air Force officers and told them not to mention the 
President's name in connection withthe events that occurrEd 
(footnote continued on page 85 ) 
-84-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 000186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Dani stayed close to the President for many days. 
He and his family moved into the palace at Bogor and 
lived there with Sukarno until October 13th, when Sukarno 
finally moved back to Djakarta. Even after that, Dani 
continued to accept Sukarno's protection by staying on 
in the palace at Bogor. On 19 October Sukarno arranged 
for Dani to use his own private airplane to fly to Phnom 
Penh, where he and his family lived in exile for six months, 
in personal safety, which even Sukarno could not guarantee 
in Indonesia, considering the mood of revenge of the Army 
toward those involved in the coup. Sukarno had seemed to 
yield to Army pressure in removing Dani as Chief of the 
Air Force, but obviously he was not concerned with the 
justice of punishing those responsible for the death of 
the Army generals, as he made an outrage of any sense of 
justice in the matter by immediately appointing Dani to 
a new official position as a civilian--that of Minister 
(footnote continued from page 84) 
at Halim on 1 October. Actually Dani had been the 
one to talk most about Sukarno's presence at Halim 
that day. None of the other important participants in 
the coup, who were also at Halim, had so casually--and 
so unnecessarily--bandied about the name of the President 
in connection with events at the airbase. Aidit, 
Untung, Supardjo, Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono are 
not known to have made any reference to the fact that 
Sukarno was there to anybody (until some of them were 
forced to discuss various facts about the coup under 
interrogation by the army, after they were captured). 
Meanwhile, Dani had made several intriguing references 
to the President in different briefings to Air Force 
officers. He must have realized his error in doing 
this and tried to undo the damage caused by it by 
later ordering the Air Force not ever to mention Su-
karno's name in connection with events at Halim on 
1 October. 
-85-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of Aviation--a job that provided an official excuse for 
leaving the country.* 
It is not clear why Dani finally agreed to return 
to Indonesia in April 1966, when it seemed virtually 
certain that he would only be tried and convicted for his 
obvious involvement in the coup. Suharto's people are 
known to have been in contact with him in both Paris and 
Phnom Penh and to have urged him to return to give a full 
account of what he knew about the coup. In letters ex-
changed with General Suharto, Dani apparently gave the 
Army reason to think that he had information implicating 
President 3ukarno in the planning of the coup. Either the 
Army or Dani may have suggested some kind of a deal which 
promised Dani a certain immunity if he told his story to 
the authorities; there is nothing to substantiate this, 
however.** Whatever the explanation, he voluntarily 
returned to Indonesia and, immediately upon his returni, 
was placed in custody by the Indonesian Army and later 
tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. His testimony 
in court made none of the sensational revelations about 
Sukarno that many people expected; instead, the case cen-
tered very much around his own role in the affair.*** 
*When Dani left Indonesia in October, it was reported' 
in the press that he was leaving on an aircraft procurement 
mission, the first stop of which would be Phnom Penh. 
Later, in December, when he made a quidk trip to Par, 
the same reason was given. Yet, in fact, he conducted no 
such business in either place. In Paris, the Indonesian 
Embassy personnel would have nothing to do with him; 
although he claimed to be on an official mission on orders 
from the President. 
**According to several reports, Dani consented to return 
to Indonesia after receiving assurances from the Army that 
he would not be prosecuted if he testified in court against 
Sukarno. 
***In this connection, it is interesting to note that 
Dani's leggthy testimony at the Sukrisno trial in July 1966 
was never released to the press. Presumably, it implicated 
Sukarno in the coup. 
-86-

There were several good reasons why Suharto may not have 
wanted to turn Dani's trial into a trial against Sukarno. 
At that point in time, he was primarily interested in 
putting the blame on the PKI for the coup. He could af-
ford to wait on the matter of Sukarno. He copld always 
threaten (and later did threaten) to use Dani as a wit-
ness against Sukarno in a public trial of the President 
and in this way force concessions from Sukarno without 
ever having to disclose Sukarno's involvement in the coup 
in a trial. With the death of Aidit, Dani may have been 
the only person who knew the full story of Sukarno's in-
volvement in the coup. As long as Sukarno lives, it 
would seem that Suharto might want to keep Dani alive--as 
a potential witness. It is interesting to note that, 
as yet, he has not been executed, though he is under 
sentence of death. 
1. 
Sukarno in a Losing Cause 
As.for Sukarno's actions after the coup, leaving 
aside for the moment the question of his involvement be-
forehand,* one can say nothing less than that they com-
mitted him to the side of the coup. Everything he did, 
or said after the coup was in the interest of quieting 
the national furor raised over the generals' deaths, pro-
tecting those involved in the coup, and restoring the 
political situation to that existing before the coup. 
Colonel Sarwo Edhy was the first Army commander 
to meet with Sukarno after the coup. On the morning of 
2 October he went to Bogor to confer with the President. 
He asked Sukarno about the fate of the generals. After 
*The question of Sukarno's involvement in the planning 
of the coup is discussed in the last section of this 
paper which deals with events leading up to the coup, in-
cluding the decision to stage the coup. 
-87-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
a moment's pause, Sukarno replied that this was a common 
matter in a revolution. Colonel Edhy reported this to 
Nasution as soon as he left the Palace. It was this com-
ment of Sukarno that Nasution was referring to in his 
speech of 20 February 1967: 
Is it proper and acceptable for a healthy 
mind to view the 30 September affair, which 
shook the foundations of the life and liveli-
hood of the people and the state, as nothing 
more than 'a ripple in the ocean of the revo-
lution'? 
At a meeting with the armed forces commanders,* 
which he called later that same afternoon at Bogor Palace 
Sukarno rejected various suggestions for firm measures 
against the Communists and other persons involved in the 
coup; he insisted that such questions be left to him for 
resolution. When Suharto asked him just what measures 
he was going to take, Sukarno replied- 'Don't be stub-
born. Leave the political settlement to me ' Suharto 
asked: "What about our missing generals? Sukarno re-
plied: "See, you are too stubborn. Leave it to me." 
During the meeting, he turned to General Ad:Jie and said 
"I have not appointed you to command the army because ytSu 
are too stubborn and too much known as an anti-communist." 
The generals left the meeting depressed and dissatisfied 
but acquiescing to Sukarno. 
*Present at the meeting were Sukarno, Deputy Prime 
Minister Leimena, Dani, Suharto, Army General Adjie, 
Pranoto, General Sabur, Police Commander Sutjipto, Navy 
Commander Martadinata, Air Force Commander Sri Muljono 
Herlambang, and several other army officers. According 
to what is probably an apocryphal story, Suharto is re-
ported to have confronted Dani at the meeting. Holding 
up a Chung rifle (Chinese-made rifle) that the Communist 
volunteers had in their possession when they were dis-
armed by the army on the day of the coup, he demanded to 
know: "Where did this come from?-
-88-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In a brief speech broadcast from Bogor Palace on 
the morning of 3 October, President Sukarno labelled as 
untrue the charge made by Suharto in his radio broadcast 
on the evening of 1 October that the Air Force was in-
volved in the 30 September Movement. He called for the 
immediate establishment of an atmosphere of calm and 
order, in which the Army and the Air Force would not be 
set against each other. In his appeal for continued 
unity, he emphasized the need for bolstering the anti-
Nekolim spirit--a bogus issue that he was again and again 
to insert into the settlement of the coup. It was strik-
ing that there was no word of regret for what had happened 
to the generals and no indication that the government 
would take any action against those responsible for their 
deaths and no word of appreciation for Suharto and the 
forces under him who had moved to reestablish the govern-
ment's authority. There was no call to the PKI front 
groups to surrender their arms--in fact, no reference to 
the PKI at all. It was the beginning of a contest of 
wills, with Sukarno trying desperately to create the im-
pression that the political situation had not changed as 
a result of the coup and the Army insisting that every-
thing had changed. 
The Army was quite understandably outraged by 4 
Sukarno's refusal to honor the dead generals on the day 
of their state funeral on Armed Forces Day (October 5th), 
a day which originally had been planned as a national 
celebration but which was now proclaimed to be a day of 
official mourning. Sukarno did not attend the funeral 
services. He added insult to injury, as far as the Army 
was concerned, in designating Subandrio to represent him. 
In this instance, perhaps for the first time, he offended 
the conscience of the whole nation. The solemn funeral 
procession through the center of Djakarta was watched by 
thousands of silent onlookers who lined the streets ten 
deep and by many thousands more watching on television. 
The night before, film clips of the exhumation of the 
bodies from the hasty grave at Lubang Buaja, which Suharto 
had personally witnessed, had been shown on T.V., with 
a short statement by Suharto about "the cruel murders of 
our generals who were innocent." The next day, the nation 
was still reeling in a state of deep emotional shock.

the night of 30 September-1 October. The poignant scene 
of Mrs. Nasution carrying her daughter to the grave touched 
the hearts of millions of people around the world. Expres-
sions of sympathy were received by the family from the 
high and the low in Indonesia, from the leaders as well 
as private citizens of many other countries, but not from 
Sukarno. Sometime later, Sukarno is reported to have 
summoned the Nasutions to the Palace. _Dewi reportedly 
broke into tears when she saw "the sadness on Mrs. Nasu-
tion's face."* On this occasion, Sukarno uttered the 
only words of compassion for the Nasutions that he ist. 
ever known to have expressed. 
*According to one story, Dewi turned to Sukarno and said: 
"Bapak, why don't you punish those communists who can do 
such brutal things to people like this?" Sukarno told her: 
You don't understand these matters. They are more complicated 
than a woman can understand."

Because of the critical condition of his daughter 
that morning, Nasution had not been present at the cabinet 
meeting called by Sukarno at Bogor at 1000 hours on 6 
October. Dani and Subandrio, both of whom were now liv-
ing at the Palace at Bogor, attended, staying close to 
Sukarno throughout the four-hour meeting. Njoto and 
Lukman of the PKI were also there, but not Aidit.* 
Sukarno delivered a brief description of events of the 
week, along with an exhortation that the people's fears 
and resentments must be calmed. In the course of his 
recital of events, he did condemn the savage killings 
--for the first time--and he said that he did not sanction 
the Revolutionary Council "since only the President can 
dissolve the Cabinet." His remarks suggested that these 
were the only two things about the coup that he had not 
approved--the murdering of the generals and the establish-
ment of the Revolutionary Council with the announcement 
that the Dwikora Cabinet was dissolved He propose0 that 
all newspapers, including the PKI's Harian Rakjat, now 
be allowed to resume publication. (The military refused 
to permit this.) 
*After the cabinet meeting, Njoto and Lukman are re-
ported to have talked in private with Sukarno, who urged 
the PKI to remain calm. Sukarno promised to take action 
within a week to protect the party. Njoto and Lukman 
are reported to have asked Sukarno not to appoint Suharto 
as the new army commander since Suharto was known to be 
anti-PKI. Sukarno said that he would take care of this 
matter also. On 9 October, when still the PKI had received 
no decision from Sukarno and there had been no abeyance 
in the Army's campaign against the party, Njoto and Luk-
man went to Bogor again to see the President. This time, 
however, they were not allowed to see him nor were they 
permitted to deliver a letter they had prepared for him 
asking for his decision. For a long time after that, the 
PKI waited patiently for the protection that Sukarno had 
promised the party. But this time, Sukarno was not able 
to save the PKI.

Subandrio was the chief spokesman at the cabinet 
meeting; he argued at length that the events of the past 
week suggested to him that a U.S. and British invasion 
of Indonesia was imminent and, thus, Indonesians should 
avoid "intra-familial squabbling." Several other ministers 
gave their opinion. Then Sukarno spoke again, telling 
of past attempts on his life and his ability always to 
forgive and not be vengeful (he compared himself to the 
prophet Mohammed who, in the course of much experience, 
had never given precedence to revenge). He said he al-
ways thought only of the revolution and how to safeguard 
it-and never of himself or of taking revenge on his enemies; 
this he said, was what Indonesians should do now.* The 
cabinet meeting ended with a moment of silence for Indo-
nesia's dead heroes. 
In public, Sukarno did not condemn the killing of 
the generals, as he had at least done in private at lqbe 
cabinet meeting. In connection with the matter of the 
killings, he sought by every means he could to discredit 
the official Army version of just how the generals had 
been killed. The following incident is a good illustra-
tion of his persistent efforts after the coup to tone 
down the atrocity stories that were being told about the 
death of the generals. Major General Sutjipto claimed ' 
to have been shocked by a conversation he had with the 
President two weeks after the coup. According to Sutjipto, 
Sukarno complained about the exaggerated press coverage 
*President Sukarno made his concern for the revolution 
the primary subject of his public remarks after the coup, 
in an obvious effort to direct attention away from the 
events of 1 October to the ongoing revolution, which re-
quired the unified efforts of all Indonesians under his 
leadership. Thus, in his speech of 23 October 1965, he 
said; "It is not a matter of myself: It is not the 
matter of the generals: It is not the matter of the 
hundreds of Pemuda Rakjat members who have been killed: 
It is none of these things: It is the matter of the 
revolution: The revolution must go on:" 
-92-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of the generals' murders. He said that the three generals 
still alive when they reached Lubang Buaja had been executed 
"in an orderly and graceful manner by the decision of a 
kind of people's court." According to Sukarno, the gen-
erals were blindfolded before being shot and the execution-
ers "apologized first" before killing them. It was almost 
as if Sukarno was trying to give a certain legality to 
the proceedings at Lubang Buaja that morning. General 
Sutjipto would probably have accused Sukarno of telling 
a deliberate lie about the circumstances of the generals' 
deaths, since he (Sutjipto) was probably convinced of 
the truth of some of the wilder stories of atrocities at 
Lubang.Buaja. Actually, as suggested earlier, Sukarno's 
version of what happened at Lubang Buaja may have been 
a rather accurate description of events--though his pur-
pose in insisting on his version was obviously not just 
to establish the truth. The incident definitely suggests 
that Sukarno had his own sources of information on Ievents 
at Lubang Buaja (presumably, the coup leaders themselves) 
and was not convinced by the army version of events. 
After Sukarno told General Sutjipto that the reports of 
PKI cruelties published in the newspapers were untrue 
and that General Suprapto, Sutojo, and Parman were shot 
"at the �decision of a kind of people's court at Lubang 
Buaja," General Sutjipto asked the President where he' got 
this information. Sukarno is reported to have tried to 
avoid the question, saying that General Sutjipto should 
not be so emotional. 
On other occasions Sukarno tried to belittle the 
fact of the generals' murder. In the course of an inter-
view in early 1966, he was asked about the coup. He passed 
off the question with the comment that he didn't know why 
there was so much interest in the coup, since it only 
involved the murder of six generals, compared to the 
slaughter of thousands of Communists in the horrible after-
math of the coup. He went on to say that he thought that 
"those people instigating the anti-PKI massacres, namely, 
the Army and the CIA, ought to be brought to trial." On 
this and other occasions, Sukarno never showed any parti-
cular sympathy for the martyred generals. 
-93-

Moreover, in the three years since the coup, Sukarno 
has never sought to change the initial impression he gave 
of his attitude towards the 30 September Movement. He 
has never said that the coup was counter-revolutionary; 
in fact, he has never suggested that the 30 September Move-
ment was carrying out a coup at all. Although the guilt 
of the PKI in planning the coup has long since been estab-
lished, he has refused to place the blame on the PK1. 
His speeches have continued to favor the PKI, which he 
has praised as the party that has suffered the most casu-
alties and displayed the most merit in the Indonesian 
revolution. For months after the coup he resisted mount-
ing pressure in favor of banning the PKI; since its dis-
solution by Suharto, he has regretted the action. 
In the months following the coup, Sukarno made 
several brave, but as it turned out, futile attempts to 
restore the balance of power to its pre-coup status quo. 
Perhaps the most striking thing about his major political 
moves after the coup was their demonstration of his utter 
contempt for Nasution and his basic hostility toward the 
army. If it was not completely clear before the coup, 
his post-coup politics certainly made it unmistakably 
clear that he was quite prepared to take the most obvious 
and drastic steps--without any pretense what_soever--to " 
eliminate the army as a serious contender for power. That 
he might have been involved in an attempt to eliminate 
the top leadership of the army in the way of the 30 Septem-
ber Movement is not at all out of keeping with tte trend 
of his politics before the coup and especially after the 
coup. Sukarno acted absolutely contrary to Nasution's 
recommendations on the matter of a Presidential Order re-
establishing law and order and upholding justice after 
the coup. His Presidential Order of 21 October was modeled 
closely after the six-point recommendation of Aidit for 
a political settlement of the coup; it altogether ignored 
Nasution's five main proposals, including One for estab-
lishing a special tribunal to 'hear testimony on the events 
of the coup and the activities of those involved in it. 
When in February 1966 Sukarno finally announced his long-
awaited "political solution" to the coup, it was nothing 
Jess than a direct challenge to Nasution and the Army. 
In a bold move to restore the pre-coup Nasakom cabinet 
-94-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
(in which all major political parties including the Com-
munist Party were represented), Sukarno announced the 
formation of a new cabinet on 21 February, which was al-
most identical to the old cabinet except for the absence 
of four names: Aidit and Njoto of the PKI (who were dead), 
Admiral Martadinata, a strong supporter of Nasution and 
Suharto, and--Nasution. If the President would dare to 
dismiss Nasution in February 1966, when the latter had 
the sympathy and respect of a whole nation after the tragic 
events that had befallen his family and his associates 
as a result of the 30 September MoVement, how much more 
likely would he have been to eliminate him from the scene 
four months earlier? 
As is well known, Sukarno's challenge to the Army 
and to Nasution did not go unanswered.* This time, real-
izing full well that it was Sukarno or the Army--since 
*Many people thought that Nasution would react to his 
dismissal from the cabinet by taking power forcibly. 
But if they did, they were sadly disappointed; for he 
did not react in any such way. He seemed almost not-to 
react at all; he just seemed to accept his dismissal, 
without one word of protest. As he confided to friends 
later, All I could think about at the time was my 
daughter and the sadness of my wife." 
But if he was still in a state of shock and unable 
to react to the momentous events on the political scene, 
there were other leaders in the Army and other people in 
Indonesia--namely, the students--who reacted strongly 
to Nasution's dismissal. A new force in Indonesian poli-
tics had been born in January 1966 with the first of many 
student demonstrations against Sukarno; in March, there 
were more demonstrations against the dropping of Nasution 
and Martadinata from the cabinet and the inclusion of 
Subandrio and Dani in it. It is difficult to say who led 
whom, whether it was a case of the Army leading the stud-
ents or vice versa. It is a fact that elements of the 
RPKAD, dressed in civilian clothes, took the lead in many 
of the student demonstrations. On the other hand, the 
Army would probably not have moved against Sukarno with 
the courage that it did if the students had not provided 
support and encouragement. It was clearly a case of the 
Army and the students reinforcing one another.

Sukarno was now obviously the sworn enemy of the Army--
the Army leadership decided to do what it had never 
really done before--fight back against Sukarno. The out-
come of that struggle is now well known. In March 1967, 
'one year after Sukarno defied the Army by dropping Nasu-
tion from the cabinet, the Army finally won the battle, 
when Sukarno was forced to surrender all his powers as 
President of Indonesia.* 
- *In March 1966, there was a dramatic confrontation 
between Sukarno and the Army. At the first meeting of 
the newly appointed cabinet on 11 March, Sukarno and 
Subandrio received word that it looked as though the Army 
was about to move against the Palace. At the time, the 
Palace, which was where the cabinet was meeting, was un-
der a virtual state of seige. The Army had surrounded 
the place to block the entry of the cabinet members into 
the Palace for the cabinet meeting. The meeting had gone 
on as scheduled only because Sukarno arranged to have the 
cabinet members flown in by helicopter. In the midst of 
the meeting, Sukarno and Subandrio received a message 
that prompted them to leave the meeting at that very mordent, 
so promptly, in fact, that Subandrio is reported to have 
left his shoes behind. As they drove out of Djakarta on 
their way to Bogor, there was a dramatic confrontation 
between the RPKAD and the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard. For 
a moment, it looked as though there would be an armed 
clash, but this was averted when the RPKAD allowed Sukarno 
to pass. 
A week later, the Army took force into its own hands 
On 18 March, a number of cabinet members, including Suban-
drio, were arrested on Army orders. Sukarno held out an-
other whole year. Considering the odds that were against 
him, it was a remarkable performance. But, in the end, 
he was finally forced to surrender his powers as President 
of Indonesia in March 1967.

power after the coup, see Indonesian Upheaval by John 
Hughes, David McKay Company, Inc., 1967.

The Conspiracy 
Two years after the coup, only two of the twenty-
or-so persons who figured most prominently in the coup 
and probably together knew the whole story of the coup 
are still alive today and have not been interrogated by 
the Indonesian Army. Those two are Sukarno and Pono, 
the latter of whom is still at large, having managed to 
escape capture by the Army longer than any of the others. 
Aidit, Lukman, and Njoto of the PKI were killed resist-
ing capture or soon afterward, before they could be in-
terrogated. The principal military figures in the coup 
--Untung, Latief, Sujono, Supardjo, and Dani--and the 
following PKI officials--Njono, Sudisman, Pens Pardede, 
and Sjam--plus former foreign minister Subandrio were 
arrested and interrogated at length before being tried 
for treason and sentenced to death.* 
*In September 1968, President Suharto admitted for 
the first time that Untung and three other military lead-
ers of the coup had been executed in Deci-mber 1967. ,It 
seems certain that Sujono was one of the three besides 
Untung, as there were reports at the time that he and 
Untung had been executed together. Probably, Latief was 
one of the other two who were executed. 
On 2 October 1968 President Suharto turned down tie 
clemency appeals of nine other accused conspirators in 
the coup. Among those denied clemency were Sudisman, 
Njono, Supardjo, and Sjam, all of whom were under sentence 
of death. Njono and Sudisman were promptly executed on 
29 October. As of mid-November, Sjam and Supardjo were 
not known for sure to have been executed, but it is 
expected that they will be soon, if the have not been 
already. 
If it is true that Sujono and Latief were two of the 
three military leaders of the coup executed at the same 
time as Untung, that would leave only Dani and Pono (who 
has not yet been captured) alive of the principal figures 
(footnote continued on page 98) 
-97-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In addition to these principals in the coup, hun-
dreds of other persons have been arrested and interrogated 
in connection with the coup. Some, like Lt. Dul Arieff 
.who was in command of the troops sent to kidnap the gen-
erals, and Major Bambang Supeno and Major Sukirno, the Com-
manding Officers of the 530th and 454th Battalions, who 
were held responsible for their actions in the coup, have 
received prison sentences. Others, like Sgt. Sujatno, 
whose home on Halim Air Force Base was used by the Central 
Command, and other of the military officers and men who 
fought on the side of the coup but who did so under false 
impressions created by their superior officers, have been 
relieved of any responsibility in the matter; they have 
provided valuable information about the leaders of the 
coup, their activities before the coup; and their actions 
on 1 October. In addition, there were witnesses to the 
scene--such as the family members of the generals at home 
on the night of 30 September-1 October and the witnesses 
to the murder scene at Lubang Buaja later that morning 
and witnesses to the later travels of Aidit and others. 
All these and countless other people who might have known 
something about PKI planning and activities before the 
coup or something about the thinking and/or actions of 
men like Untung or Sujono before the coup have also been 
exhaustively interrogated by the Army. Probably, by now 
the Indonesian Army knows everything that it will ever 
know about the 30 September Movement. It is not likely 
that Sukarno will ever tell what he knows. Certain things 
(footnote continued from page 97) 
in the coup. There is good reason for Suharto to want 
to keep Dani alive so long as there is any chance of 
Sukarno's ever being tried for his role in the coup. 
(According to the latest reports, Suharto has ordered 
an interrogation of Sukarno to begin in early 1969.) 
Dani and Subandrio are probably the only two people who 
know the full story of Sukarno's involvement in the coup, 
except, of course, for Aidit, who is dead. As mentioned 
previously, Dani is reported to have implicated the Presi-
dent in the planning of the coup in secret testimony he 
gave the Army after he turned himself in to the Army. 
Both Dani and Subandrio are under sentence of death; both 
have appealed to President Suharto for clemency. So far 
as we know, Suharto has taken no action on their clemency 
pleas. 
-98-

about the coup--such as Sukarno's and Aidit's precise 
roles in the coup and Dani's relations with both of them--
will probably never be known for sure. But it has been 
the history of conspiracies, especially those involving 
persons in high office, that certain facts have remained 
unproven and thus always open to some doubt. 
As good a history of the Indonesian coup of 30 
September 1965 as could ever be written could probably 
be written at this time, some three years after the 
event--if one had access to all the information that the 
Indonesian Army has. Obviously, no one outside of a few 
persons in the Indonesian Army has seen all the evidence; 
but enough has become available during the past three 
years that we can feel reasonably sure that we have not 
only the main facts about the coup as it occurred on 1 Octo-
ber; but also most, if not all, of what is known about the 
conspiracy behind the events of that day. Of courste, the 
information about the conspiracy is based entirely on the 
interrogation of the people involved in the conspiracy, in 
contrast to our knowledge of the events of the coup itself 
and the days immediately following, which comes from a 
great variety of sources. Naturally, this kind of evi-
dence must be considered in a slightly different light 
than the evidence that was presented in the first two' 
sections of this paper dealing with the coup and the events 
afterward. For a fuller discussion of the validity of the 
evidence that is presented in this third section of the 
paper, we refer the reader to the discussion of the interro-
gation reports that is included in. the Appendix.*

The Role of the PK1 Spe.Aal Bureau 
The actual planning for the coup was started and 
finishfd in the one month of September 1965 in the course 
of se.en or eight meetings, which were held late in the 
evening either at the homesof Capt. Wahjudi, Col. Latief, 
oi Sjam, or at Lubang Buaja. Altogether, eleven persons 
were involved in these meetings: Sjam, Pono, Untung, 
Latief, Sujono, Capt. Wahjuci, Major Agus Sigit, Gen. 
Supardjo, Walujo, and two unidentified women. Not all were 
present at every meeting; the last four persons .named at-
tcaded only one meeting, that of 29 September, Only Sjam, 
Untung, and Latief attended every meeting. 
As of the beginning of September 1965, Untung, the 
Commander of the 1st Battalion of the Tjakarabirawa Presi-
dential Guard, Latief, the Commander of the 1st Infantry 
Brigade of the Djakarta Command, and Sujono, Regimental 
Commander of the Halim Air Force Base Defense Troops, all 
stationed in Djakarta, had never met one another. They 
had something very much in common, however, which was soon 
to bring them into a fateful alliance. They each had for 
some time been having regular contacts with highly-placed 
PKI agents, who were none other than the second and third 
men in charge of the PKI's super-secret Special Bureau, 
charged with infiltrating the military organization. In 
the case of Latief and Sujono, their PKI contact man--or 
"pembina" as they called him--was a man called Pono; in 
the case of Untung, it was a certain Walujo. 
These two men are now known to have been the close 
associates of a third man--a man called Sjam--another deep-
cover PKI agent, who was a close friend and trusted as-
sociate of Aidit in the inner circle of the PKI leadership. 
Sjam had joined the PKI in 1948, having known Aidit for 
several years before that. When Aidit was arrested in 
1948 upon his return from China, Sjam is supposed to have 
"assisted him greatly" while he was in prison. For a num-
ber of years, he was head of the Ship and Dock Workers 
Union, an affiliate of the PKI national front organization 
for trade unions. It is not clear when he was elected to 
the Central Committee of the party, but about 1960 he became 
-100-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
a member of the Organization Department of the Central Com-
mittee which was headed by Aidit himself.* In November 
1964, Sjam was given the special assignment of heading a 
new covert organization that was set up directly under 
Aidit anddharged with carrying out special duties (mainly 
covert operations) such as infiltrating the armed services. 
Even the existence of the Special Bureau was a secret with-
in the PKI; it is not exactly clear who, besides Aidit, 
knew anything about it. One would think that the four other 
members of the Standing Council of the Politburo (Lukman, 
Njoto, Sudisman, and Sakirma4 must have known, but, judging 
from his interrogation report, Sudisman did not. Neither 
Njono, a member of the Politburo, nor Pens Pardede, a 
member of the central committee and a candidate member of 
the Politburo, appears to have had specific knowledge of 
the Special Bureau.** 
*Before the Special Bureau was set up as an autonomous 
organization that was completely free of the control of 
the central committee or the politburo, with absolute 
authority over its own organization, administration, per-
sonnel, logistics, etc., the Organization Department of 
the Central Committee directed all illegal activities of 
the PKI. After the formation of the Special Bureau, in-
filtration- of the armed forces which had been carried on 
by the Organization Department was transferred to tte 
Bureau. Infiltration of government organs, political par-
ties, and mass organizations vas still conducted by the 
Organization Department, %inch Hutapea headed after 1965. 
**Actually, it is not too surprising that Njono and Pens 
Pardede and even Sudisman, a member of the Standing Coun-
cil of the Politburo, did not know about the Special Bureau. 
According to Communist Chinese'doctrine-on the "Coordination of 
the Legal and Illegal Struggle"; 
The very existence of a secret or covert com-
munist organization must be unknown, its per-
sonnel must be unknown as Communists, its 
work carried on in complete anonymity. It 
is unknown not only to hostile security

Siam himself has provided the fullest account of 
the organization and functions of the PKI Special Bureau. 
Under interrogation by the Army in mid-1967, he stated 
the following: 
The Special Bureau was the Party's special 
apparatus which handled special affairs, 
namely work which could not be accomplished 
through the other overt apparatus, primarily 
in the military field and other fields which 
had to be undertaiten clandestinely. 
The Central Special Bureau was the special 
apparatus of Comrade Chairman of the CC/PK1,

The leadership of the Central Special Bureau 
consisted of the following; [the names of 
persons involved in the coup have been under-
lined for emphasis] 
1. Kamarusaman (Sjam)-whose duty was to co-
ordinate the work of the entire bureau, 
both central and regional offices; in 
addition, to assist in the management 
of Special Bureau contacts within and 
outside the Armed Forces. [In this con-
nection, Sjam stated; 'I directly handled 
(cultivated, managed) the following Armed 
Forces members; Gen. Supardjo, Major 
Suganda, Col. Sidik, Capt. Sumedi, Col. 
Mustofa, Col. Pasha (who never executed 
the Party tasks given him), and others 
whom I cannot remember. I also directlyl 
managed non-military government officials; 
among them Djunta Suwardi of the Customs 
and Excises Office, who was a sympathizer 
but not a party member.'] 
2. Marsudidjojo (Pono)-the second in command 
whose job was to manage PKI cells* within 
*"Cells" may not be the best translation of the word 
used by Sjam. These were not Communist party cells in 
the ordinary- sense of the word. The way the word is 
used in connection with the operations of the Special 
Bureau, it refers to the officers in a particular mili-
tary unit who were being "managed" by the same 'manager" 
or "organizer" from the Special Bureau; most often, they 
were not Communist party members but Communist sympathizers. 
In this sense, Col. Latief, Major Sigit, Captain Suradi 
and Captain Wahjudi composed a "cell" within the First In-
fantry Brigade; in other words, they were the men from 
the First Infantry Brigade with whom Pono had succeeded 
in establishing regular contact. In theory, at least, 
there was supposed to be no horizontal contact between

the First Infantry Brigade of KODAM V, 
consisting of Col. Latief, Major  Sigit, 
Capt. Suradi, and Capt. Wahjudi; the Air 
Force Defense Troops, consisting of 
Major Sujono, Capt. Gatot and others; 
the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard, consist-
ing of Marj. Slamet among others; the Army 
Department, including Gen. Pranoto among 
others; KODAM V Military Police; and the 
police force (not: yet set up). 
3. Stibono (Walujo)-the third man in command 
whose assignment concerned finances as 
well as the cultivation of party cells 
in the Air Force, consisting-of Air 
Marshal Omar Dani, Air Commodore Siswadi, 
Col. Heru Atmodjo, and others; and the 
(footnote continued from page 103) 
members of the same cell. They did not meet together, 
as a group, with their "manager", as members of the 
same Communist party cell in any Communist party or-
ganization attend regular meetings of the cell. There 
was only a vertical relationship between these men 
and their manager. In short, it was more of an intel-
ligence organization than an extension of the Communist 
party organization.

Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard, consisting of 
Col. Untung, Lt. Col. Ali Ebram, 1st Lt. 
Dul Arief, and others. 
4. Two other members of the Central Special 
Bureau worked in the field of management 
training within the special bureau and 
also managed Party members within the 
Navy. A sixth was assigned to the secre-
tariat of the Special Bureau (admin, 
documentation, etc.) as his basic task 
while he also managed party members and 
sympathizers in private business and govern-
ment in Djakarta. The seventh member of 
the Central Special Bureau worked in the 
general field of providing information 
on youth, worker, peasant movements, etc. 
5. There were also five staff members assist-
ing the Central Special Bureau as medical 
officers, messengers, etc. 
Under the Central Bureau, there were 10 regional 
Special Bureaus, one for: the Djakarta Raya 
area, West Java, Central Java, Bali, South 
Kalimantan, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, South 
Sumatra, Riau, and the South Celebes. 
According to Sjam, the Special Bureau was "charged 
with the task of preparing for armed struggle," which was 
not the official policy of the PKI at the time. Aidit seems 
definitely to have been opposed to the adoption of a mili-
tant line on revolutionary armed struggle in Indonesia; 
as long as things were going so well for the PKI under 
Sukarno's protection, he believed that the best policy 
for the PKI was one of strong support for Sukarno, the 
renunciation of force as the way to gain power in Indonesia, 
and the espousal of the peaceful, parliamentary road to 
"socialism." Sjam himself may have favored a more militant 
domestic policy. After the coup, he is known to have argued 
in favor of armed struggle by the PKI against the Army. 
His position as chief of the Special Bureau in charge of 
-105-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
covert activities (including preparations for armed strug-
gle) also suggests a natural inclination in that direction.* 
Despite Aidit's preference for legal struggle over 
armed struggle--at least, so long as Sukarno lived--he 
might be considered to have made one concession to the argu-
ment for armed struggle in late 1964, when he set up the 
Special Bureau as the special covert apparatus of the 
party charged with the task of preparing for armed strug-
gle, in addition to its other covert duties. He was look-
ing ahead to the time when Sukarno would no longer be around 
to balance the PKI against the Army; some kind of a show-
down with the Army seemed almost inevitable after Sukarno's 
death. 
.It does not seem to have been Aidit's policy to arm 
PKI party members (which would have involved the covert 
shipment of relatively large quantities of arms to the PKI 
from abroad); instead, he seems to have settled on a policy 
of PKI infiltration and subversion of the Armed Forces. 
Rather than train and arm his own armed force, pretty much 
from the beginning, he seems to have concentrated his ef-
forts on subverting the Indonesian military. To this end, 
his main targets within the military seem to have been 
middle-grade officers in positions of command. If the 
PKI could win the loyalty of these officers, he figured 
that he could count althe men under their command to fol-
low their orders; in a showdown with the army, these units 
would defect to the side of the PKI. 
The extent of PKI penetration of the military was 
certainly never realized by the army leadership before the 
coup; it clearly came as a surprise and a shock to Nasution 
and Suharto and the other army generals after the coup 
*In 1962 Sjam visited Communist China, North Vietnam, 
and North Korea for the purpose of studying -people's revo-
lutionary warfare." He received special intelligence 
training in the preparation and activation of armed rebel-
lion.

when they learned about the operations of the PKI and 
the Special Bureau from the confessions of Untung, Latief, 
Sjam, and others. The extent of the penetration was 
shockingly evident in one fact that was revealed--that 
Sjam himself had acted as a double agent in pretending 
to be an informer for the Djakarta Military Command. 
From 1955 until the outbreak of the 30 September Move-
ment, he had passed reports on the PKI and other poli-
tical parties to the Army, in the process of which he 
had gained information on such things as the organiza-
tional structure and personnel of the Djakarta Command 
and other Army offices, the political views of Army of-
ficers, and the political analysis of the Army. Sjam 
claims that he learned about the Generals' Council in 
this way. 
PKI Recruitment of the Military Officers 
t. 
As noted above and also made clear from the dates 
of Sjam's early activities as a double agent. the PKI pro-
gram of infiltration in the armed services pre-dated the 
formation of the Special Bureau. We have good evidence 
that the party was active along these lines in the early 
1950's and thereafter, although its activities were no 
doubt very much stepped up after 1964, when all illegal 
operations of the PKI in the Armed Forces were transferred 
from the Organizational Department of the Central Commit-
tee to the Special Bureau under Sjam. Untung, for instance, 
was first recruited by the PKI sometime around 1950. 
At the tilre he was stationed in Solo, and it was there 
that he met two PKI cadres named Sudarmo and Slamet. 
Prior to that, he had had no direct contact with the 
party, although he was known to have Communist sympathies 
and to have fought on the side of the Cdmmunists in the 
Madiun uprising of 1948. From 1950 until January 1965, 
when he was transferred to Djakarta, Untung had regular 
meetings with Sudarmo and Slamet. Very shortly after he 
arrived in Djakarta, he was contacted by another pm mem-
ber--named Walujo--in very much the same way that he had 
first met Sudarmo and Slamet in Solo. Since he had moved 
to Djakarta, he now came under the direct management of 
-107-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the Central Special Bureau of the PKI; his new contact 
man, Walujo, was none other than the #3 man in charge 
of PKI illegal activities in the Armed Services. 
Under interrogation by the Army, Untung later de-
scribed his meetings with Walujo in Djakarta. He said 
that they usually took place at-the Officers' Mess during 
his off-duty hours "in an atmosphere of secrecy." The 
subjects discussed were normally the political situation 
and the concepts and speeches of Sukarno. As Walujo de-
scribed the political situation to Untung, the "implemen-
tation of Sukarno's concepts--such as Nasakom and the 
5th force--was impossible because of the Armed Forces, 
which were against these concepts." In their discussions, 
Walujo repeatedly referred to the high standard of living 
of the senior Army generals who were "against Sukarno." 
Untung has said: 
All the time I was in Djakarta and meeting 
with Walujo, my promoter in ideology, he 
always provided me with indoctrination re-
garding the economic difficulties of soldiers 
nowadays and the fact that there was no 
longer any loyalty to the Generals from 
their subordinates, which in my view was 
true; he also provided me with information 
on the existence of the Generals' Council, 
which was also mentioned to us later during 
our meetings with Sjam. 
There can be no doubt that these meetings had a 
profound effect on Untung. He has been described by one 
source who knew him well as "a simple man, dedicated to 
Sukarno but politically naive. He could easily be in-
fluenced by others." Another has described him as being 
of "unimpressive intellect, fanatically devoted to Sukarno." 
He was a rigid Moslem who "deplored luxury and depravity 
and resented the high life and immorality of some of the 
senior generals. He was not a clever man." "He was physi-
cally but not 'intellectually impressive" according to an-
other. The PKI had obviously picked their man well. Un-
tung would be amenable to their control; and now, with 
-108-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
his transfer to Djakarta and his new assignment as bat-
talion commander of the Tjakrabirawa Presidential Guard, 
he was particularly well-placed, from the point of view 
of the PKI.* 
*After the Madiun uprising of 1948, in which Untung 
fought on the side of the Communists, his military career 
was in eclipse for a period of years. In the West Irian 
Campaign of May 1962, however, he distinguished himself 
as commander of one of the two companies of the 454th 
Battalion ,that were air-dropped into Irian. As the hero 
of the campaign, he was soon promoted from captain to 
major, and from then on, his career was on the upgrade 
He was appointed commander of the 454th Battalion and, 
a few months before the coup, was given the prestigious 
assignment of battalion commander in the Tjakrabirawa 
Palace Guard. Only 40 years old in 1965, Untung had a 
promising future in the Army at the time of the coup. 
On 19 February 1963, on his return from Irian, Untung 
was presented with a medal by President Sukarno. The 
scene was the lawn of Merdeka Palace in the presence of 
the diplomatic corps and high government officials. The 
major was clad for the occasion in battle dress; behind 
him in similar array stood five companies from the guer-
rilla force. Following Untung's report, Sukarno pinned 
medals on his chest and those of his associate guerr:lia 
leaders, amidst applause from the assembled public. A 
few days later, Sukarno entertained the heroes with "an 
evening of merriment." 
An Indonesian reporter who interviewed Untung shortly 
after his return from West Irian was struck by Untung's 
"display of sincere emotion." Asked to comment on his 
memories of his service as an Irian paracommando, Untung 
"assumed a sad expression and replied, his voice choked 
with emotion"; 
Yes, the name Gunung Ginopa (a town in West 
Irian) has been a beacon flashing to our 
souls every second. Gunung Ginopa is the 
symbol of our sacrifice, the symbol of ex-
treme loyalty and of suffering not easily

The Planning of the Coup 
Untung's activities on behalf of the coup began 
on 4 September 1965--less than a month before the event. 
On that day, in the course of a regular meeting with 
Untung, Walujo mentioned that he wanted Untung to meet 
a certain Col. Latief, Major Sujono, and Captain Wahjudi. 
He said that he would make arrangements to introduce Un-
tung to them.

forgotten. We have immortalized Gunung Ginopa 
as the name of the Heroes' Cemetery there. 
Thirty-five of our people lie there, forever... 
our comrades from the same unit...our comrades 
who dropped from the same airplane. 
A quite different picture of Untung was given by a 
lieutenant who served under him in the Irian campaign. 
According to the lieutenant, Untung was very ambitious. 
When he was about to be dropped into Irian he was still 
a captain but was given the local rank of major for the 
occasion; he refused to jump until he had been given 
the insignia of his new rank, and so another major gave 
his up for Untung. According to Untung's fellow officer, 
Untung was known as an atheist, a loner, and cruel. On 
landing in Irian he abandoned one of his men in the jungle 
because he was disabled, on the argument that it was 
better one should die than that all should be placed in 
difficulty. Although he prevented his men from picking 
up transitor radios while in Irian, he himself brought 
back several, which he got by blackmailing some Chinese. 
Presumably, the truth about Untung's character lies 
somewhere between these two extremes. One thing that 
seems clear is that he tended to be rather puritanical 
and strict with his men. 
-110-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
On the same day, Col. Latief--who had been having 
regular meetings with another deep-cover PKI agent who 
was Walujo's immediate superior as the #2 man in the 
Special Bureau, a man whom Latief knew only as Pono--was 
approached by his contact man on the same matter. As 
Latief has described it: 
Around the beginning of September on a day 
and date which I have forgotten,* Pono 
(whom I had already met) arrived at my 
house with another person, whom he identi-
fied only as Sjam. During this meeting, 
Pono told me that within a few days there 
would be a meeting of several comrades 
from the military at the house of Captain 
Wahjudi. During this meeting, Pono did 
not talk much but said that in two days 
I would be picked up and brought to the 
house of Capt. Wahjudi, while Sjam at 
that time did not say a word. 
*Although Latief says that Sjam and Pono came to 
his home "around the beginning of September on a day 
and date which I have forgotten," he then goes on to 
describe what happened "two days later." The events 
that he describes are known to have occurred on 6 
September, which would date his first meeting with 
Sjam on 4 September.

The First  Meeting:  The Participants Meet  
Two days later, thE first "get-acquainted" meeting 
of the men who were to plan and lead the 30 September Move-
ment was held at Capt. Wahjudi'S home late on the evening 
of 6 September 1965.* Presumably, the othertmen had been 
informed of the meeting in much the same way that Untung 
And Latief had been told. Around 2000 hours, Pono arrived 
at Latief's house and invited him to go with him to Wah-
judi's home. Latief recalled that 
we arrived at Capt. Wahjudi's.home together, 
around 2030. There I found Lt. Col. Untung, 
Air Force Major Sujono, Infantry Major Agus 
Sigit, Wahjudi, Pono, and Sjam.- All seven 
of us entered the dining room, and after we 
spt down all the doors were closed. Then 
Pono introduced Sjam to us all; he said: 
'Comrades, Mr. Sjam is a comrade of ours who 
will join us and lead further discussions.' 
Then Sjam took over the meeting, and the 
first thing that he mentioned was the.Gen-
erals' Council. Perhaps he did this to 
attract our attention. He spoke as follows: 
'At the present time the ekisting Generals' 
Council is sabotaging the concepts of the 
great leader of the revolution...If the Presi-
dent should become ill, there is a great 
possibility that the generals will take over 
the government. If this haribens, of course, 
the situation would become Worse and they would 
destroy the PKI and other prtigressive parties. 
Thus at the present time we must as quickly as 
possible to set up or plan a new government 
through establishing a revolutionary council 
*At his trial, Untung was asked why the first meeting 
was held at Wahjudi's house and not at his house. Untung 
replied: "the reason for that was that the appointed 
place for the meeting had to guarantee a maximum of security 
and could not be a place where there v)ere' a lot of people 
around." 
-112-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
which will be supported by the progressive 
and revolutionary parties and mass organi-
zations.' 
After having heard the remarks of Sjam, 
there was a reaction on our part and 
because the meeting was not very well 
regulated, questions arose all at once 
which more or less centered on the revo-
lutionary council and how it would be 
set up. Sjam answered; 'you need not 
know that. Everything'will be regulated.' 
Then we asked who the leaders of this 
council would be and Sjam said we would 
find out later. 
Because it was very late and we began chatting 
among ourselves, it was planned for us to L 
meet again three days later. 
Wahjudi, Untung, and Sujono have given their own 
accounts of the first meeting of the coup group on 6 Septem-
ber, which all tend to confirm the essential truth of 
Latief's recollection of the event. Only Wahjudi fails 
to note the presence there of one of the other six men 
(he forgets Sujono); otherwise, there is complete agree-
ment as to who was there. Wahjudi"s account is the most 
amusing of all in his profession of great surprise when 
these men suddenly arrived at his home for a meeting he 
claims he knew nothing about in advance; 
At the time I did not actually know that a 
meeting was to be held, but then Col. Latief 
arrived with two men, and then some other 
persons arrived, and then they began to dis-
cuss things in the house. Untung and Major 
Sigit, Col. Latief and Sjam and Pono were 
there. I did not know who they were, but 
I only recognized that they were civilians. 
As far as the meeting at my home was con-
cerned, I did not consider it a meeting 
because there was no leader, and hence it 
-113-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
only seemed to be a kind of get-together. 
It was then explained by Sjam that the meet-
ing was taking place at a critical and im-
portant time in view of the fact that there 
was conflict among the different groups in 
the country. He said that we should safe-
guard the revolution and protect Sukarno. 
But if Wahjudi's protests seem a bit disingenuous,they 
may not be altogether misleading. For some reason that 
is not altogether clear, Wahjudi does seem to have dis-
appointed Sjam and Pono in their plans for him to play 
an active role in the coup. After the first two meetings 
that were held at his home, he did not attend any of the 
later meetings; needless to say, the meetings were held 
elsewhere. According to Sujono, Sjam brought up the sub-
ject of Wahjudi at the meeting on 23 September when he 
informed the group that Wahjudi would no longer be conling 
to the meetings. 
We heard a discussion between Latief and Sjam 
to the effect that we should simply do with-
out Captain Wahjudi. Later on I asked about 
Capt. Wahjudi, and Latief replied that he had 
failed to show up at several meetings and so 
we would no longer count on his attendance at 
the meetings. Sjam offered the explanation 
that Capt. Wahjudi could possibly have been 
detained because of family affairs. After 
that, we didn't ask any more questions about 
it. 
In the meantime, Major Sigit also said that 
he would not be able to participate in this 
action. He only said that 'circumstances' did 
not permit his taking part. 
Wahjudi has had only the following to say about his with-
drawal from the coup group: 
One day Untung approached me at my home to 
invite me to another meeting, but I was busy 
with the affairs of the battalion and I 
never attended a meeting after that. 
-114-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
It may be that family problems or the pressure of work made 
it difficult or impossible for Wahjudi to attend the meet-
ings without arousing suspicion. (At least, on one occa-
sion, Untung was unable to attend a scheduled meeting be-
cause his duties in the Palace Guard kept him elsewhere, 
so the meeting was postponed.) It is more likely, how-
ever, that Wahjudi had reservations about becoming involved 
in any such plot as Sjam and the others were contemplating. 
He may not have been as convinced as Untung and Latief and 
the others of the existence of the Generals' Council and 
its plans for a coup and, thus, the need for a countercoup 
or, if he was, not so willing to assume the risks of being 
a part of it. It is interesting that he took no steps to 
notify the authorities of the plotting under way, however. 
We just do not know enough about Wahjudi or his political 
views to explain all his actions; and the same is true for 
Major Sigit, who also withdrew from the coup group before 
the planning for the coup was well underway. BothImen 
were subordinates of Col. Latief in the First Infantry 
Brigade and both were members of the same "PKI cell" as 
Latief, which meant that they all had Pono as their "manager" 
from the PKI. Obviously, Sjam and Pono thought they could 
be persuaded to play an active role in the coup or they 
would not have brought them together with the others at 
the first meeting on 6 September; but in this case, they 
seem to have been wrong in thinking they had that much con-
trol over Wahjudi and Sigit. 
After the first meeting on 61September, Untung seen--
to have been totally convinced that the Army leadership 
was planning a coup, though Sjam had presented him no 
factual proof of this; he was also persuaded that Sukarno 
health was failing. At his trial, he said that "it was 
on the basis of these considerations that I swiftly or-
ganized meetings with other officers in order to effect 
an offensive to block the Generals' Council.. .Naturally 
I did not report this to my Commander." On 7 September 
he is known to have summoned one of his company commanders 
in the 1st Battalion of the Tjakrabirawa Regiment--Lt. 
Dul Arief, who was later to be given command of the troops 
charged with the kidnapping of the generals--to his bedroom 
in the Army barracks, where the following conversation is 
purported to have taken place: 
-115-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Untung: How many men, who can be put in 
action, have you? 
Dul Arief: Approximately, one company. 
Untung: Have you understood my question? 
Dul Arief: Yes, I have. I know something about 
this, as I have already been told 
by,my organiser. 
Until we had the full picture of the organization and opera-
tion of the Special Bureau that Sjam provided after his 
capture, we could not have appreciated the relationship 
between Untung and Dul Arief. Of the 9 men whom Sjam named 
as among those whom Walujo "managed" in the Air Force and 
the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard, Untung and Dul Arief were 
two of the three men he listed from the Tjakrabirawa guard. 
In other word, they were members of the same "cell", in 
the sense that the Special Bureau used this word to refer 
to the various individuals who had been recruited from a 
particular unit of the Indonesian military; all the members 
of a "cell" would have the same "manager" from the PKI, 
in this case, Walujo. If Dul Arief referred to Walujo as 
"my organizer" in the above conversation with Untung (as 
Untung claims he did), this would suggest that they both 
must have had some knowledge of the other one's contacts 
with the PKI, even if they did not realize that they both 
had the same PKI "manager." Although there was supposed 
to be no contact between the members of a Special Bureau 
"cell" within a certain military unit, the individuals 
concerned may at least have had some idea who the other 
PKI contacts were. Or it may be that Walujo had gotten 
in touch with Dul Arief shortly before 7 September, as he 
had with Untung on 4 September, and that he had told Dul 
Arief that he would soon be contacted by Untung on a mat-
ter of utmost importance on which Dul Arief should cooper-
ate fully with Untung. Dul Arief's answer to Untung's 
question, above, that he understood exactly what Untung 
meant because "I have already been told something about 
this by my organizer" strongly suggests that Walujo had 
recently contacted him for this purpose. Since it is clear 
that Sjam and Pono and Walujo were responsible for bringing 
-116-

together the military officers who were involved in the 
highest level of military planning for the coup, beginning 
with the meeting on 6 September, it is perfectly reason-
able to assume that they set up most, if not all, of the 
contacts between these military leaders and the men under 
them who would play a subordinate role in the coup. If 
one compares a list of the military officers involved in 
the coup with the list of PKI contacts in the military who 
were being "managed" by the Special Bureau,. the Similarity 
is striking. Obviously, the Special Bureau was behind the 
planning for the coup; for the most part, the people in 
volved in the coup were "assets" of the Special Bureau in 
the military whom the PKI had been "cultivating" for years 
for just such a military operation. 
The Second Meeting: Sjam Takes Charge 
t. 
The meeting of the coup group that was held on 6 
September was a prototype of those that followed through-
out the month. The same five people�Sjam, Pono, Untung, 
Latief, and Sujono--were almost always present; Sjam pre-
sided at every meeting and was always in charge. He pro-
nounced the party's'political analysis of every political 
matter and handed down its decisions as directives to the 
officers, brusquely overriding all questions and objections. 
As the month passed and the discussions concentrated more 
on military planning, he retreated somewhat from the center 
of the stage in allowing the military officers to make more 
of the purely military decisions in preparation for the 
final moment, when the shooting was about to begin, when 
he would withdraw altogether to the sidelines and leave 
them to face the shock of the day. In the last days, the 
meetings were transferred to Lubang Buaja and Col. Latief 
was in control tr all practical purposes, as it became a 
matter of assembling and organizing troops into units, check-
ing equipment, etc. 
After the first meeting on 6 September, a second meet-
ing was held in Capt. Wahjudi's home on 9 September. ,Again, 
it was held late in the evening-'around'220.0-hours:--ind was 
attended by the same seven people who were present at the 
-117-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
first meeting. As Latief remembered it, the discussion 
centered on the Revolutionary Council. The officers 
wanted to know exactly who would be on the Council, but 
Sjam brushed aside their questions with the persistent 
reply: "You comrades need not get excited; every thing 
has already been ta-en care of, so we can all be quiet 
now." Latief's answer to an interrogator's question 
about his attitude toward Sjam's authoritative way of 
handling everything at this meeting is of interest: 
Question: Why did you and your comrades in 
that second meeting not show any reaction in 
hearing Sjam say that everything would be 
taken care of, as though his words were un-
changeable? Who did you think-was deciding 
things as stated by Sjam? Were they decided 
by Aidit himself through Sjam or by Sjam him-
self? 
Latief: Sjam was not speaking at this meet-
ing on his own authority but in behalf of 
his superior, and in this regard Sjam was a 
delegate from the PKI Central Committee (CC/PKI). 
Although Sjam did not say who issued these 
instructions to him, I, as. a sympathizer of 
the PKI, am convinced that the one who regulated 
the words of Sjam was comrade Aidit.* 
*Whether or not Sjam referred to Aidit by name or other-
wise indicated that he got his orders from Aidit is a point 
on which there seems to be some disagreement in the inter-
rogation reports of Latief, Sujono, and Untung. Latief 
indicates that Sjam never said anything about the orders 
coming from Aidit though he (Latief) was sure that they 
did. Sujono remembered one time when Sjam referred to 
"the Chairman;" it was then that Sujono realized that 
Sjam represented the PKI (at first, he thought he was a 
member of the military). At his trial, Untung testified 
that Sjam stated that he was a friend of Aidit and. on 
knother occasion, a messenger from Aidit. Untung was not

Question: (Although you believed that Aidit 
was the one making the decisions), did you hesi-
tate regarding the setting up of the Revolu-
tionary Council? 
Latief: Indeed so. I hesitated regarding the 
setting up of the Revolutionary Council because 
each time I asked Sjam about this I never got 
a definite answer as though this thing were 
top secret. 
Question: If th's is so, from the first and 
second meetings you could tell that this was 
a very grave plan and you were hesitant on 
every matter put before you: Why did you not 
(footnote continued from page 118) 
necessarily concerned to quote Sjath'S precise words, how-
ever; he was simply answering a question as to whether or 
not Sjam indicated that he spoke for Aidit. Sjam himself 
might have referred to Aidit as "the Chairman". 
In his official report on the Indonesian coup, General 
Suharto indicated that Sjam was explicit in telling the 
military officers that all the planning for the coup was 
being done by Aidit: 
At every meeting Untung and his comrades always 
inquired from Sjam whether the entire plan for 
the coup was known and approved by Aidit. Sjam 
replied: 'Every plan connected with the coup 
has already been approved; moreover Aidit al-
ways inquires about the attitudes of each indi-
vidual at the meetings.' 
Suharto was making explicit what was undoubtedly true--that 
Sjam did report to Aidit on the meetings and did receive 
his orders directly from Aidit. But it is doubtful that 
Sjam made the statement attributed to him by Suharto; he 
would have been more discreet than that; furthermore, none 
of the interrogation reports (that we have seen) mention 
any such statement.

withdraw from this plan? Was there no desire 
on your part to destroy this plan by report-
ing it to the Commander in Chief of KODAM V? 
Latief: For the sake of the interests of .the 
PKI to which I am sympathetic, I did not report 
this matter to the Commander in Chief. 
The interrogator asked Untung a similar question about his 
uncritical acceptance of everything Sjam said: 
Question: You act as though all the provisions 
were issued by Sjam and were swallowed without 
any reaction or questioning as to why they were 
so, despite the fact that what Sjam issued was 
not acceptable to your thinking: Why was this? 
Untung: I can reply to this as follows: In 
fact we as military members, both I myself, Col. 
Latief and Maj. Sujono, who attended that meet-
ing, had placed our complete confidence in 
Sjam as a representative of the Party with 
which we were tied in closely in ideology, 
namely, the Indonesian Communist Party. 
The Third Meeting: The Question of Troops and the Role 
of Sukarno 
After the meeting on 9 September, the third meet-
ing of the coup group was held on 13 September at 2130 hours 
at Col. Latiefs home. Latief explained the change in the 
meeting place, as follows: 
At first, it was proposed to hold this meet-
ing at Capt. Wahjudi's house again, but be-
cause there had been several meetings there, 
it was requested that the next meeting be 
held in my house, although in fact this was 
not too tactical because I usually have many 
guests and I have a large family. But Siam 
instructed that it be held at my house. 
-120-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The major topic of discussion at the third meeting was the 
question of troops. Apparently, each man, in turn, gave 
his estimate of the number of men from his respective unit 
that he could make available to the coup. Sujono's pledge 
of a trained force of some 3-4,000 people was particularly 
noteworthy. He was referring to 3-4,000 Communist volun-
teers--young men and women from the Communist youth and 
women's organizations--who had just completed a short 
course of a week's duration in military training at Lubang 
Buaja conducted in great secrecy by Sujono himself. [We 
will have more to Say about this particular force and the 
secret training program at Lubang Buaja later.] After Sujono, 
Latief and Untung gave their estimates of the number of 
troops available from their units. Thereupon, a heated 
exchange between Sjam and Major Sigit is reported to have 
taken place as to whether or not a force of this size was 
sufficient to start a movement.* The incident was another 
good illustration of Sjam's absolute unwillingness to 
tolerate disagreement or doubt. He is reported to have 
become very angry and to have ended the exchange with the 
retort: "Bung, we also are military people and we can 
decide military matters." According to Latief, "the meet-
ing then skipped to other matters to calm everyone down." 
At this point, the crucial matter of the role of Sukarno 
in the coup was raised for the first time, in a question 
by one of the military officers. Sjam reportedly replied 
that "the great leader of the revolution has his own role 
also. The Bung will later on obtain a separate settlement." 
*This incident underscores some of the doubts that Major 
Sigit apparently felt about the coup plans. We know of 
another occasion, too, when he expressed doubts about cer-
tain other features of the coup planning. After the second 
meeting of the group on 9 September, he is reported to have 
approached Col. Latief at the Infantry Brigade headquart-
ers and to have asked Latief what he thought about the whole 
idea of the Revolutionary Council and specifically the idea 
of making Untung the chairman. He asked Latief: "Do you 
think he is willing and capable of leading the Revolution-
ary Council and facing the major parties and mass organiza-
tions? Do you know why he was selected to be chairman?" 
Latief said that he had brought up this matter with Sjam 
but had never obtained an answer. 
-121-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Latief says that everyone present concluded from that 
"that no matter what happens, the President must play a 
role. With this view, which we all had, Sjam was silent 
and gave no reaction at all and owing to the fact that it 
was very late, the meeting was closed at this point." 
The Fourth Meeting: The Question of the Generals and  
the Choice of a Leader 
Sjam and Pono had requested that the next meeting 
oe held at Latief's home again, and so six days later, on 
19 September, Untung, Latief, Sujono, Sjam, and Pono met 
there at 1700 hours for their fourth meeting together. 
The group was now down to five people, with the defection 
of Major Sigit and Capt. Wahjudi from the group; from now 
on, these five men would meet together every other day 
until just before the coup, when they would bring other 
people into their discussions at the last moment to brief 
them on their respective assignments in the coup. In the 
Interval of six days before the last meeting and this one 
on the 19th, Untung had been in touch with Maj. Sukirno, 
the Commander of the 454th Battaion Of the Central Java 
Division, stationed in SOmarang. Apparently, Untung had 
gone to Central Java for the express purpose of meeting 
Sukirno; the two men had met in Untung's home in Tjidurian 
on the morning of 15 September. Untung must have explained 
something of his plans to Sukirno, for he obtained Sukirno's 
assurance that he could use the troops of the 454th Battalion, 
which would be in Djakarta towards the end of the month 
for the Armed Forces Day parade on 5 October. Maj. Sukirno 
informed Untung that the 530th Battalion of the East Java 
Division was also scheduled to take part in the parade and 
presumably would be arriving in Djakarta about the same 
time as the 454th Battalion, around the 25th or 26th of 
September. Untung reported his conversation with Sukirno 
to Sjam and the others at Latief's home on the evening of 
the 19th. He.also informed the group of the preparations 
that Lt. Dul Arief of the Tjakrabirawa was making to have 
the troops of the Tjakrabirawa ready for their kidnapping 
assignments. This led into a discussion of the target of 
_these raids; namely, the specific generals on the list to 
be kidnapped. 
-122-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
As Untung explained it, Sjam made the initial sug-
gestion of each name and then there was a general discus-
sion of that particular general; in every case, the group 
agreed with Sjam on the seven names he proposed. 
Untung: As to the suggestion of the names of 
the generals who had to be 'secured,' 
this was done jointly but preceded 
by a proposal of Sjam. For instance, 
as to Gen. Nasution, in general, 
we were all of the same idea. But 
the proposal came from Sjam. The 
same for Gen. Yani, Parman, Harjono, 
Sutojo, Pandjaitan, and Suprapto. 
Altogether, there were seven people 
included. 
Question: What was the opinion of the planners 
of the 30 September Movement as to 
other generals in the Army, Air Force, 
Navy, and Police Force? 
Untung: In this case, everything was based 
on the information that_ the seven 
generals belonged to the Council of' 
Generals who were to stage a coup. 
At the meeting on 19 September Sjam 
said that according to the last 
information he had, Gen. Yani had 
urged Gen. Nasution to immediately 
realize the Coup, but Gen. Nasution 
could not approve of this action. 
He said that Gen. Yani was already 
making preparations.* Thus, based 
*Untung explained that Sjam said that "Gen. Yani had made 
ready -two Saracen armored cars on Djalan Daksa as part 
of his preparations for a coup." After an investigation, 
it turned out that the two Saracens were made ready by 
Gen. Yani, Gen. Muskita, and Gen. Ginting "in order to 
escape should something happen." 
-123-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
on the information Sjam had, it 
was considered necessary to im-
mediately 'secure' the generals. 
Untung's testimony reinforces the observation made earlier 
on the basis of the military raids on the various generals' 
homes on 1 October that General Suharto was not a target 
of the 30 September Movement. Contrary to widespread 
belief, he did not escape capture in some near-miraculous 
way as Nasution did; no effort was ever made to get him. 
The other interesting point in Untung's testimony is his 
explanation of Sjam's way of obtaining agreement from the 
military officers on various points that he obviously had 
already decided--such as precisely which generals would 
be eliminated. 
It is of interest to look into the matter of just 
what Sjam and the others intended with respect to the 
generals--whether they intended from the beginning to 
kill the generals or to arrest them (on charges of plot-
ting against the government) and hold them incommunicado 
until the coup was a fait accompli,. or whether they had 
no clear idea what they would do with them since it de-
pended on whether they were captured dead or alive.* At 
his trial, Sjam insisted that it was not the plan of the 
PKI to kill the generals. When asked why it was that the 
generals were killed, he responded: "We simply lost our 
senses." 
Untung has said that Sjam always used the Indonesian 
word "mengamankan"--which means "to secure or render harm-
less"--in speaking of the action to be taken against the 
*Just what the PKI intended and what Sukarno may have 
Intended to be done with the generals are two different 
questions. There is a good deal more ambiguity about 
what Sukarno intended and what he may have thought the 
PKI intended than there is about what the PKI intended 
itself. Sukarno's thinking in the matter is discussed 
later in the paper. 
-124-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
generals. Apparently, he never spelled out exactly what 
he meant by this and the military officers never ques-
tioned him closely. They must have felt reasonably sure 
that they knew what he meant, and the indications are that 
they accepted the fact that he meant that the generals 
would be killed.* During their interrogation, none of 
the military officers involved in the coup claimed that 
they were shocked or even surprised by the murder of the 
generals, although Sujono, in the process of disclaiming 
any responsibility for the decision to kill the generals, 
does make it look as though he was not exactly sure what 
was to be done with them. After Lt. Dul Arief turned the 
generals over to Air Force Major Gatot Sukrisno at Lubang 
Buaja, Sukrisno immediately reported to Sujono; Sujono 
claims that he sent a courier to the Central Command, 
which was still at the Aerial Survey Office in Djakarta, 
to request orders, which he insisted be in writing. The 
order came back, signed by Latief, that the generals who 
were still alive should be "disposed of" immediately.** 
If Sujono's story is true, it suggests that he did 
not have standing orders to kill the generals as soon as 
they were brought to Lubang Buaja; but this would probably 
have been the case even if the coup leaders had planned 
to kill the generals from the beginning. On such an-
*During his interrogation, Latief was asked if he ap-
proved the murder/kidnapping of the generals. He answer-
ed; "We approved of the murder of the generals because 
we were forced to do so by the PKI." 
It is interesting to note that Latief did not use the 
word "kill" or something like it--like "shoot" or "execute"--
but instead said that the generals should be "disposed of." 
It was really no more direct a way of saying that the gen-
erals should be killed than to say that the generals should 
be "rendered harmless" as Sjam had explained the action 
to be taken against the generals. Yet, Sujono was obviously 
in no doubt what "to dispose of" meant. 
-125-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
important matter, Sujono would probably have been instructed 
to report to the Central Command when the various raiding 
parties arrived back at Lubang Buaja with the generals; 
the final order to kill the generals would not be given 
until the Central Command knew for sure whether or not 
all the generals had been captured and whether dead or 
alive. It is interesting to speculate just what Sjam 
and the others would have ordered Sujono to do with the 
generals had they realized at that moment that Nasution 
had not been captured. Actually, at that point, they 
were committed to killing the generals who were still 
alive, since three of the generals had already been killed 
resisting capture. No matter what they intended with 
respect to the generals, they obviously had to be pre-
pared for the eventuality that some of the generals would 
be killed in the process of capturing them. As mentioned 
earlier, the order to the officers in charge of the kid-
napping missions had been to bring back the generals "(dead 
or alive." Gatot Sukrisno, the commander of the volunteer 
forces at Lubang Buaja, testified at Untung's trial that 
Latief told him and the other officers involved in the 
raid on the generals' homes that "it was advisable that 
the generals not be shot in their homes but rather gotten 
rid of at some other place." 
The other main topic--besides the generals who 
were to be eliminated in the coup--that was discussed 
at the secret meeting of 19 September was the choice of 
a leader for the 30 September Movement, which was still 
unnamed at this point (as we shall see later, Sjam gave 
the movement its official name of 'the 30 September Move-
ment' at a later meeting of the group on 29 September). 
In response to a question about the need for a leader 
when the movement announced itself later on, Sjam 
broke the news that Untung would be the leader of the 
over-all movement." Apparently, no one was more sur-
prised than Untung. He says that he immediately ques-
tioned Sjam as to why he had been selected. Sjam re-
plied: "because you are not known here and are rela-
tively new and because you are the personal bodyguard 
of the President." Apparently, both Sujono and Latief--as 
well as Untung--had reservations about this decision. Later, 
-126-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Untung and Sujono are reported to have approached Sjam to-
gether to ask if it would be better if "a higher ranking 
officer and a more appropriate officer be selected to head 
this movement." Sjam closed the subject--as he was wont 
to close all matters of controversy--with the firm opinion 
that "it is better if Untung heads the movanent for the 
reasons I have mentioned."* 
At the end of the meeting, the military officers 
asked Sjam about the political support for the coup. He 
replied that there should be no anxiety on that score: 
What is of primary importance is whether 
the plans for the kidnapping of the generals are 
successfully carried out. Should they suc-
ceed, then automatically all the political 
and mass organizations and the parties will 
support us, that is the PKI and all its polt.-
tical and mass organizations and sympathizers, 
the PNI and its political and mass organiza-
tions and sympathizers and other parties which 
presently join us in activities in all fields. 
In regard to political preparations in areas outside Djakarta: 
� 
The Regions have made preparations earlier 
than we and the Regions are meatay waiting 
*The tact that Untung was a battalion commander in the 
Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard was doubtlessly a consideration 
in the PKI's selection of him as the leader of the 30 
September Movement. It would naturally be assumed that 
any action he would take would be in defense of the Presi-
dent; thus the fact that he was leading the 30 September 
Movement would be taken as an indication that at least 
the coup was pro-Sukarno. This was obviously not the main 
reason why the PKI chose Untung as the leader of the coup, 
however; a much more important consideration was the fact 
that Untung could be trusted completely to follow PKI orders. 
Sjam would never have admitted this to the other military 
officers involved in the coup, of course. 
-127-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
for the results of our movement in Djakarta. 
The areas already prepared are Bandung, 
Central and East Java. 
Sjam's comments on the mobilization of political support 
for the coup are of special interest as an indication of 
the preparations that the PKI was making along this line 
in advance of the coup. With the premature collapse of 
the coup, nothing of this sort ever materialized; the lack 
of any observable response from the PKI (except its edi-
torial in Harian Rakjat on the morning of 2 October) to 
_events in Djakarta on 1 October was particularly mystify-
ing at the time. If the PKI had engineered the coup or 
was in any way involved in it or merely sympathetic to it, 
why had it failed to mount an all-out propaganda campaign 
in support of it? Certainly, it was not because it was 
unable to do so. In comparison with other parties, the 
PKI was unique in its ability to mobilize public opintion 
in Indonesia; within a matter of hours, it could mount A 
propaganda campaign in support of any policy, complete 
with mass demonstrations of support involving thousands 
of people, public statements of support from leaders in 
all fields, and all kinds of editorial comment in the 
PKI-controlled mass media. The absence of all these normal 
signs of PKI support for the coup prompted some observers 
to conclude that the PKI obviously was not involved in the 
coup; they could not reconcile the party's willingness to 
risk an action like the 30 September Movement with its 
failure to undertake an all-out push, especially when the 
missing element was support in the propaganda field. We 
now know, of course, that the fact that the PKI did not 
stage an impressive show of public support for the coup 
was not because it was not involved in the coup or some-
how caught off-guard by the timing of the coup or not 
sympathetic to it--indeed just the opposite was true. At 
the same time, the fact that it had been very much involved 
in the planning for the coup and yet had failed to follow 
through with a propaganda offensive was not because it had 
not considered this in its over-all planning for the coup. 
The fact of the matter was that the PKI had made the most 
careful plans for the mobilization of political support 
after the coup, but had called off these plans at the last 
moment when the coup ran afoul and the party realized that 
-128-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 000186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
it would not have Sukarno's support for an action that 
had been badly bungled. 
We still do not know much about the PKI prepara-
tions in the political field. Sjam never discussed them 
with the military officers, who are our main source of 
information on the planning of the coup. We do know, 
however, that it was Aidit's plan to send the top lead-
ers of the PKI to various cities throughout the country 
a day or so before the coup; they would personally co-
ordinate political activities in the various areas. 
(Lukman and Sakirman were sent to Semarang in Central 
Java and Pens Pardede to Medan in Sumatra, for instance.) 
Aidit had obviously given much thought to the matter of 
political support for the coup. This was one matter that 
could not be arranged for completely ahead of time, be-
cause of the need for secrecy. Too many people would be 
involved to bring them into the coup planning. Aidtit 
had done everything that he could in the way of planning 
the PKI political response and still keeping it a secret. 
He had briefed his key lieutenants in detail on what 
should be done; they would have the responsibility of 
coordinating PKI activities after the coup. Obviously, 
he considered it a matter of the utmost importance or 
he would not have assigned his key men to the job. 
Having sought to reassure the military officers 
that the matter of political support for the coup had 
been taken care of by others and they should have no 
worries along this line, Sjam pressed one final point 
on the meeting of 19 September--namely, the need to im-
plement the coup as soon as possible. Untung agreed 
but said that it would be necessary to wait at least 
until the end of the month, when the troops of the 454th 
and 530th Battalions would arrive in Djakarta. From 
this point on, Sjam's pressure on the military for haste 
and Untung's concern for adequate military preparations 
would be the underlying currents at every meeting of the 
coup planners.

ihe Fiftn Meeting: The Question of Arms and An Important 
Newcomer to the Group 
It was decided that the next meeting would be held 
on 21 September at Sjam's house; however, due to a mis-
understanding regarding transportation, the meeting was 
postponed until 23 September. According to Untung, the 
fifth meeting on the 23rd was not really an official meet-
ing of the group but more of an "informal discussion," 
because Sujono was unable to be there. This was the 
first meeting of the coup group that began as early as 
.1630 hours, and Sujono had been called to a meeting with 
the Minister of the Air Force (Dani) at the same hour. 
Nothing more is known about the alleged meeting between 
Sujono and Dani, but Untung's mention of it is very in-
teresting; if true, it could be of some significance. 
Only four days earlier, Dani had returned to Indonesia 
from a secret mission he had made to Communist China on 
the direct orders of President Sukarno. Besides Dani 
and Sukarno, only two other persons knew of Dani's mis-
sion--Subandrio and Aidit. The Indonesian army was not 
informed of the trip and was not to learn anything about 
it until after the coup. 
The whole story behind Dani's trip to China will 
probably never be known; but the following facts have been 
established with reasonable certainty. Dahl arrived in 
Peking on 16 September aboard an Indonesian Air Force 
jet and stayed there three days, returning to Indonesia 
on the same plane on 19 September. Upon his return, he 
reported on the results of his mission, first, to Suban-
drio and, then, to President Sukarno. (He reported to 
the President while they were attending the wedding of 
Dr. Ruslan Abdulgani's daughter on 21 September.) He 
never submitted a report to the armed forces leadership 
or to the Minister Coordinator for Defense and Security 
(Nasution), who would normally have been informed about 
such a matter. The trip was kept a secret from Nasution 
and the Army leadership until well after the coup, and 
presumably Sukarno intended that it always be kept a 
secret. At Dani's and Subandrio's trials, however, it 
-130-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
was revealed that Sukarno had sent Dani to Peking in mid-
September to make the final arrangements for a shipment 
of Chinese arms to Indonesia that Chou En-lai had first 
mentioned to the Indonesians some nine months earlier.* 
In Peking, Dani is known to have had a private meeting 
with Chou, with whom, among other things, he is reported 
to have discussed the shipment of 100,000 small arms to 
Indonesia. 
Thus, it would seem that a deal between Sukarno 
and the Chinese involving the shipment of 100,000 small 
arms from Communist China to Indonesia was in the process 
of being negotiated, if it had not already been concluded, 
at the time of the Indonesian coup. It had been negoti-
ated at the very highest levels, by Sukarno and his per-
sonal representative, Dani, on the Indonesian side and 
by Chou En-lai himself on the Chinese side. It was ob-
viously intended to be kept very secret; as we havv seen, 
only four persons in the Indonesian government knew any-
thing about it. (It is interesting in this regard that 
Dani was one of the four persons. It shows the closeness 
of his relationship with Sukarno, which would seem to be 
a very important factor in understanding his role in the 
coup. In this case, he was in the select company of Aidit 
and Subandrio; on this basis, the three of them might 
well be considered to have been Sukarno's most trusted 
confidants.) 
The precise connection, if there was any, between 
Sukarno's arms deal with the Chinese and the coup is not 
so easily established. It seems that Chou's offer of 
*According to Subandrio's interrogation report, Chou 
En-lai offered to provide Indonesia "with 100,000 pieces 
of light arms free of charge for the purpose of equipping 
the fifth force" in January 1965, when Subandrio was in 
Peking for talks with the Chinese leaders. 
-131-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
weapons to Sukarno--an offer that was first made in Jan-
uary 1965�was in connection with Sukarno's plans for a 
"fifth force" in Indonesia.* The issue of the "fifth 
force" was one of the most controversial issues of the 
day. The military, that is all the leaders of the armed 
services with the exception of Dani, were strongly op-
posed to the idea. The PKI was very much in favor of it 
for the obvious reason that it provided an excuse for 
arming peasants and workers sympathetic to the PKI. They 
always presented the idea in different forms, of course. 
In public, they spoke of the "fifth force" only in terms 
of national defense in combatting the raids on Indonesia 
from Malaysia; they would hardly have mentioned the other 
reason they had for wanting a "fifth force." 
So anxious were the Chinese for Sukarno to provide 
the PKI with an excuse for developing an armed capability 
that they were quite likely to have offered to supply the 
arms that would be required--as an added inducement for 
Sukarno to agree to the idea of a "fifth force." It would 
seem to have been the case that the C!linese had agreed 
to supply arms to Sukarno on a covert basis with the "fifth 
force" in mind; there is nothing to indicate that they 
knew of the coup planning and were sending arms to Indo-
nesia with that specific purpose in mind. On the other. 
hand, it can not be ruled out. 
As far as Sukarno was concerned, he could have 
sent Dani to Peking to arrange for the shipment of Chinese 
arms to Indonesia, also with the thought that they would 
be used to train and equip a "fifth force." Or he could 
have sent Dani there to arrange for an immediate shipment 
*By "fifth force" Sukarno meant a kind of militia along 
the lines of the Chinese "people's militia." It would be 
a trained and armed body of citizens--both peasants and 
workers�who would constitute a fifth force in addition 
to the army, navy, air force, and police; in times of na-
tional emergency, it would serve as a special defense 
force in support of the other four services. 
-132-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of arms, with the thought that they would be used in the 
coup (assuming of course, that he knew of the coup plans). 
The timing of Dani's secret trip, less than two weeks be-
fore the coup, does suggest that it was somehow connected 
with the coup. Assuming that Sukarno did know of the coup 
planning and was trying to arrange for an immediate ship-
ment of arms to Indonesia, it does not necessarily follow 
that he informed the Chinese of his reasons for wanting 
the arms immediately. 
To get back to Sujono and the others who were active-
ly planning for the coup, it is possible that Dani called 
Sujono to a meeting on the afternoon of 23 September to 
inform him of the availability of Chinese arms for the 
coup--although this is pure speculation. However, it 
will be remembered that it was Sujono who made the arrange-
ments to get the Air Force arms that were stored in'the 
Mampong ammunition depot on the night of the coup; will 
also be remembered that these were Chinese arms. It is 
not at all clear when these arms were received in Indonesia. 
It is possible that some of them were received just before 
the coup, in other words, after Dani's trip to China; on 
the other hand, covert shipments of Chinese arms to Indo-
nesia are known to have been received in Indonesia before 
then.* So it is impossible to tie the Chinese arms used 
in the coup to Dani's trip to China conclusively, though 
the presupposition is strong that they were somehow linked. 
Similarly, it is impossible to say for sure that Dani's 
meeting with Sujono on 23 September was in connection with 
the coup, though there is reason to suspect that it was. 
*The covert shipment of Communist Chinese arms to In-
donesia before the coup is discussed in much greater detail 
in Section IV, pp. 171-173. Suffice it to say at this 
point that the Chinese are known to have been shipping 
arms to Indonesia. All of the arms in question appear 
to have entered Indonesia through the harbor at Djakarta: 
they were stored in nearby Air Force depots. There is 
no evidence that any of the arms were turned over to the 
PKI before the coup. Apparently, it was Sukarno, rather 
than the PKI, who had negotiated a secret arms deal with 
the Chinese. There is no good evidence that the PKI was 
receiving secret deliveries of Chinese arms at all, cer-
tainly not in any sizeable quantity.

With Sujono absent, the meeting of the coup group 
at Sam's house on 23 September was attended only by Sjam, 
Pono, Untung, and Latief. As Untung remembered it, the 
main topic of discussion was the troops that would be avail-
ab:te ro the coup forces. Pono informed the group that 
II:ere was no longer any doubt about the 530th battalion; 
the troops of that battalion, as well as the 454th, had 
uefinitely been committed to the side of the coup. Pono 
also indicated that armored support, consisting of about 
30 armored cars from the ...:Cavalry, would be coming from 
Bandung, although the commander of the cavalry unit was 
still uncertain. Untung pressed him for a more definite 
answer as to who would lead the unit and how many tanks 
would be involved. With his good commanding sense, Untung 
had immediately sensed the importance-of an armored unit; 
his concern that it should be definitely committed to the 
coup forces was to run like a thread through all the later 
meetings of the cogpgroup. Again and again he wouldtpress 
for news of it and a-pledge that he could count on it. 
His uneasiness was to prove very well-founded; the vital 
tank unit that Sjam and Pono had talked so much about never 
did show up on the day of the coup. 
Besides his report on 'the troops and armored units 
that would be available, Pono had some other interesting 
news to tell Untung and Latief at their meeting on 23 
September. He informed them that a new member would soon 
be joining their discussions--no less a figure than General 
Supardjo, who would be coming from West Borneo, where he 
was serving as Commander of the 4th Combat Command engaged 
in "confrontation with Malaysia. It was no accident or 
chance that Supardjo just happened,to'be. coming to Djakarta 
at this time. It was all part of Sjam's planning from the 
beginning. The reason that Supardjo was involved in the 
coup was precisely the same reason that Untung, Latief, 
Sujono, and the others became involved; he was a PKI sym-
pathizer who was being "managed" by the Special Bureau of 
the PKI and could be counted on to serve the will of the 
party. Supardjo was actually the prize "asset" of the PKI 
in the Indonesian military. Probably because of his rank, 
-134-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
he was personally "managed" by the chief of the PKI Special 
Bureau--Sjam himself. How far back his secret contacts 
with the PKI went is not clear. We only know that for a 
matter of months, perhaps a year or more, he was in regular 
contact with Sjani. (Presumably, he was in and out of Djakarta 
often enough, in connection with his assignment as Commander 
of the 4th Combat Command, that he could have managed to 
see Sjam fairly regularly.) We do not know anything about 
Supardjo's actual recruitment for the coup, not even whether 
he was contacted in West Borneo or when he was in Djakarta 
for a visit. Presumably, he was kept informed of the coup 
planning during those last weeks before the coup when he 
was still in West Borneo. Although he was to play an im-
portant part in the last minute preparations for the coup 
and a major role in the actual events of the coup on 1 October, 
he could not have come to Djakarta much ahead of the event 
without arousing suspicion. (His arrival in Djakarta on 
28 September was kept secret until the day of the qoup). 
Apparently, it was arranged between Supardjo and the PKI 
that he would receive an emergency telegram in West Borneo 
to come to Djakarta because his daughter was sick; this 
would be the signal that the coup was about to begin. 
Supardjo received the telegram on 28 September; he flew 
to Djakarta that same day. Had his daughter really been 
sick, he would have had no reason not to notify the auth-
orities of this fact and request leave to visit her in 
Djakarta; on the contrary, he left his post in West Borneo 
without even notifying the Army leadership that he was 
leaving. He was in Djakarta a full two days before Suhar:_ 
or Nasution learned--by chance--that he was there. (It 
will be remembered that Gen. Umar reported to Suharto that 
he had seen Gen. Supardjo at the Palace on the morning of 
the coup.) Had he had proper reasons for being there--either 
official or nonofficial�he would not have made such an 
obvious effort to keep his presence there a secret. In 
short, there can be no doubt that he came to Djakarta for 
reasons connected with the coup; and no other reason. The 
fact that Pono mentioned that Supardjo would be coming to 
Djakarta soon during the meeting of the coup group on 23 
September makes it clear that the PKI arranged everything 
connected with his arrival in Djakarta to take part in the 
coup.

The Sixth Meeting: The Training of the Volunteers and 
A Promise from the Cavalry 
After meeting on 23 September, the .next time that 
Sjam, Pono, Untung, Latief, and Sujono met together was 
on the 25th, once again at Sjam's house, around 1700 hours. 
Sjam was obviously getting impatient to move; he announced 
that the movement would have to be touched off within the 
next few days, sometime before the end of the month, or 
it would be too late. (Although he always attributed his 
sense of urgency to the likelihood of a coup by the Gen-
erals' Council, he was probably more concerned about the 
possibility of his own coup plans becoming known than the 
possibility of the Generals seizing the initiative.) Un-
der pressure from Sjam to begin the movement, Untung was 
still concerned about the two things that had all along 
been the big question marks as far as the military plkan-
ning for the coup was concerned: the armored troops and 
the volunteer troops that were receiving a short course 
in military training at Lubang Buaja in preparation for 
the coup. At this point, it would probably be well to 
clarify certain facts about these volunteer troops about 
which there has been a good deal of confusion. 
On 11 September 1965, a small staff of Air Force 
officers. with Major Sujono in charge, began a secret 
military training course for Communist volunteers at 
Lubang Buaja. In the three weeks before the coup, some 
4,000 members of the Communist youth (Pemuda Rakjat) and 
women's (Gerwani) organizations received a week's mili-
tary training and political indoctrination. It would 
have been most improbable that such a training program 
could or would have been conducted at Lubang Buaja, so 
close to Halim Air Force Base, which Dani visited regu-
larly, without his knowledge and/or approval. For one 
thing, Sujono would have to have accounted for his time, 
since apparently he was involved full-time in the instruc. 
tion of the volunteers. Actually, Dani had admitted that 
he knew that the training was going on though he has denied 
that he gave the order for it. In a rather tortured and 
obviously insincere explanation, he has said: 
-136-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
I never issued an order to Major Sujono to 
train the people at Lubang Buaja. At one 
point I heard that the training was not going 
too well so I ordered Commodore Dewanto to 
correct it. ...When the first class (of 
volunteers) was almost over, I was asked to 
speak at the closing ceremony. 
Sujono's testimony contradicts Dani's on this point; he 
has said that he was acting on the direct orders of Dani. 
As for Sukarno, he never expressed the least sur-
prise after the coup when it was discovered that Communist 
party members and sympathizers had received secret mili-
tary training at Lubang Buaja during the month of September. 
Dani's obvious knowledge of the fact that Lubang Buaja 
was being used as a secret training base would also seem 
to implicate Sukarno. Dani is not likely to have 4come 
involved in the training, as he obviously was if he spoke 
at the closing ceremony, unless he was sure that Sukarno 
knew and approved of it. In short, both Dani and Sukarno 
must have known what was going on. Whether they actually 
ordered the training as part of a long-range plan to 
create a "fifth force" or the more immediate purpose of 
the coup or whether it was more a question of their being 
informed of the coup preparations that were underway by 
other people is not so clear. 
There is no doubt that the training itself was 
part of the preparations for the coup. The timing of 
the training is convincing evidence in itself. The 
first course began within a few days of the first meet-
ing of the coup group on 6 September. The fact that 
Sujono was put in charge of the training program is 
further evidence; he was, of course, deeply involved in 
the planning for the coup at the time. At the meetings 
with Sjam, he regularly reported on the progress of the 
training of the volunteer forces as part of the military 
planning for the coup. Finally, there is the fact that 
the volunteer forces were involved in the events of the 
coup on 1 October. For these reasons, it seems to us 
that the training of Communist party members and sympathiz-
ers at Lubang Buaja during the three-week period before 
-137-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the coup when all the other preparations for the coup 
were underway must have been part of the coup prepara-
tions.* All the talk about a "fifth force" by those in-
volved in the coup may have been intended, in part, as 
a cover for the training of troops for the coup. If the 
training had been discovered before the coup, it would 
almost certainly have been represented as training for 
the "fifth force." After the coup, Dani seems to have 
resorted to the same cover story in his explanation of 
the training that was underway at Lubang Buaja. 
The nature of the training given to the PKI volun-
teers, the selection of the volunteers themselves, and 
the choice of the training site all tend to support the 
conclusion that the training was a crash training pro-
gram of auxiliary troops for the coup. The site of the 
training was the place where the murder of the generals 
took place on 1 October (although it was within the five-
kilometer zone of responsibility of Halim Air Force Base, 
it was generally considered to be part of the town of 
Lubang Buaja. The tent in which the generals were kept 
was within a few yards of the public kitchen which the 
volunteers used.) 
*The testimony of Pens Pardede, the PKI leader, is 
interesting in this regard. Although he was a member 
of the Politburo, he was apparently not privy to the 
plans that were being made for the coup. During his in-
terrogation, he stated: 
Lightning [fast] training was being given 
to the Pemuda Rakjat (PKI youth organization) 
and the Gerwani (PKI women's organization) by 
Air Force officers. When I asked one member 
of the Pemuda Rakjat, because I wanted to know, 
he replied in an unconcerned way that the 
training was for the defense of the airbase. 
But I at that time presumed that the Pemuda 
Rakjat and the Gerwani were being trained in 
connection with the coming coup. 
-138-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The PKI had managed the whole business of recruit-
ing the volunteers. According to his own confession, 
Njono, the Chief of the Greater Djakarta Committee of the 
PKI, was put in charge et all the "operational-technical 
preparations for the coup, including the contacting, co-
ordinating and then activating of the PKI reserve forces 
for a rush training course at Lubang Buaja." On 8 Septem-
ber secret instructions issued in the name of the party 
central leadership were received by the various party or-
ganizations in the Greater Djakarta area, explaining that 
a special military training course would begin on 11 Sep-
tember. The training would be conducted by the Indonesian 
Air Force. Each subsection committee of the party was 
to select 10 trainees, each branch committee of the PKI 
youth organization, 6 trainees, and each branch committee 
of the women's organization, 2 trainees.* The volunteers 
were ordered to report to the air force camp at Halim at 
1430 hours on 11 September; they would be housed in the 
barracks at the camp. 
*The greater Djakarta area committee of the PKI com-
prised about 50 subsection committees, so there should 
have been about 500 volunteers from the party, if each 
subsection committee had been successful in getting 10 
volunteers. The volunteers from the Communist women's 
and youth organizations were in addition to these 500. 
The first group of volunteers, which included both PKI 
party members and members of the Communist youth and 
women's organization, who received a seven-day military 
training course from 11-18 September, is reported to 
have included 1,200 volunteers. 
-139-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Various sources have reported that the PKI had 
plans for the military training of approximately 4,000 
men and women. Apparently, these plans were largely 
fulfilled, although it meant that there was only time 
for "lightning training" since the training course had 
to be kept to a week if 2-3 training courses were to be 
scheduled before the coup. The first group of 1,200 
volunteers completed a week's training course on 18 
September, a second class of 1,500 trainees finished on 
25 September; and another class of 1,500 arrived at 
Lubang Buaja on the afternoon of 28 September for a 
third training course that was interrupted by the coup 
itself.* As we shall see later, the final decision of 
the coup leaders to start their movement on the 30th 
was made on the 28th, the day that the third training 
course began. In the two days remaining before the 
coup, Sujono gave the third group of volunteers an even 
more accelerated course in basic military training L 
than the other volunteers had received. Even with two 
days' training, it was thought that they would--in 
Sujono's words--"give a push to the movement against 
the Generals' Council." 
*The number of volunteers involved in the program 
seems fairly well established. Several sources have 
reported the same figures given above as the attendance 
at the various courses. In his interrogation, Latief 
said that Sujono reported to the coup group at one of 
their meetings that he had trained between 3-4,000 
Communist youth and women and other PKI sympathizers 
at Lubang Buaja. 
-140-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The military exercises at Lubang Buaja were conducted 
in the strictest secrecy. According to one participant, 
the volunteers were told that anyone daring to betray the 
secret would be shot. The Air Force officers who conducted 
the training--who were all officers of the Air Force defense 
command that was assigned to guard Halim Air Force Base 
(Sujono's regiment), not officers of the so-called Air Force 
Quick Action Command or regular Air Force as we think of 
it--obviously did not reveal their true identities. Major 
Sujono was known as Major Djojo and Major Katuk used the 
name of Lt. Col. Imam. Virtually all of the volunteers 
interrogated after the coup mention these two names as the 
names of the officers in charge of the training. Besides 
the small staff of officers, there were perhaps an equal 
number of enlisted men who led the drill exercises. Train-
ing.was given in weapons, defense, and guerrilla warfare, 
and thre was political indoctrination in PKI ideology, 
Marxism, et. alia. 
At the meeting on 25 September, Sujono reported on 
the preparations that were going on at Lubang Buaja. While 
those preparations were progressing nicely, he was less 
reassuring about the matter of the armored troops. It was 
still not clear how many troops would be available and who 
the cavalry commander would be. The same tensions tat 
had been discernible at earlier meetings were even clearer 
at this one. Untung was obviously growing more and more 
nervous about the matter of armored support; he indicated 
that he was not prepared to proceed with the plans for the 
coup until he was absolutely certain about the cavalry. 
Sjam, on the other hand, was getting more and more impatien+ 
He informed Untung and the other military officers that 
there could not be any question of a delay past the end 
of the month; the movement would have to be touched off 
before 30 September. At this meeting on the 25th, he tenta-
tively set the date for the coup for 29 September. Accord-
ing to Untung, however, this was not definitely agreed 
upon by everyone at the meeting, because "we had not met 
the troops of the 454th and 530th battalions and were not 
assured of armored support." But although Untung may not 
have felt definitely committed to a deadline of 30 Septem-
ber or 29 September and may still have felt that the 
-141-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
timing of the coup would have to be determined by the mili-
tary officers who were responsible for the military success 
of the coup, he was being overtaken by the rush of events 
that waL taking place on a schedule which called for a 
coup on the 29th or 30th. It could almost have been fore-
seen at this point that in the end he would be swept up 
in the momentum of events and plunged into a venture that 
he had grave misgivings about--at least, from the military 
point of View. 
After the meeting on 25 September, Untung was able 
to satisfy some of his doubts about the 454th and the 530th 
_battalions. He went straight from the meeting to Gambir 
Station in Djakarta to check on the arrival of the two 
battalions. They had not arrived then; but later in the 
evening after he had returned to the barracks, he happened 
to see the 454th arriving at the barracks. He immediately 
made contact with the battalion commander, Major SukiTpo; 
and arranged for someone from the battalion to meet with 
him in the morning. Capt. Kuntjoro, the deputy commander, 
kept the appointment; but since the 530th had not yet ar-
rived in Djakarta, Untung and Kuntjoro decided to meet 
again at 1400 hours the next afternoon (27 September) with 
the commander of the 530th. After that meeting on the 27th, 
Untung was assured of the participation of the two battalions 
in the coup. His subordinate in the Tjakrabirawa Guard, 
Lt. Dul Arief, who had been put in charge of the operation 
to seize the generals, was present at the meeting to dis-
cuss the involvement of one company from each battalion 
in the PASOPATI troops under his command.* After their 
*PASOPATI was the codeword for the troops under Dul 
Arief's command that composed the raiding parties on the 
generals' homes; BIMASAKTI was the codeword for the troops 
under Capt. Suradi's command that were to secure the Pre-
sidential Palace, radio station, and communications build-
ing; and PRINGGODANI was the codeword for the troops under 
Major Gatot Sukrisno's command that were to defend Halim 
Air Force Base.

Ngadino of the 454th and Capt. Suradi of the 5301.h for a 
review tour of Lubang Buaja. 
The Seventh Meeting: The Decision on D Day 
After the tour, there was a meeting at Sjam's house 
at 1900 hours that evening; it was the seventh time that 
Sjam and Pono had met together with the military officers 
who would soon be left alone to shoulder the responsibility 
for the coup as its nominal leaders. At the meeting, Untung 
discussed the review that the officers mentioned above had 
made of the base at Lubang Buaja that afternoon. It was 
decided that the PASOPATI troops which would be involved 
in the raids on the generals' homes would start those raids 
from Lubang Buaja. There was another discussion ot the 
matter of the cavalry, which was still not settled. Appar-
ently, it was the feeling of the meeting that D Day could 
not possibly be set for the 29th, which was then only two 
days away. It was decided that the group would meet again 
on that date for one last review of the pIan before 
was put into effect. 
.1 
Just when the decision was made to start the Move-
ment on the night of 30 September-1 October is one oi the 
most crucial questions about the Indonesian coup, It has 
a major bearing on one's whole explanation of the coup. 
For instance, the thesis that the coup was a contingency 
plan of the PKI in the event of Sukarno's death or incap-
acitation that was put into effect prematurely because the 
PKI thought that Sukarno was seriously ill, perhaps dying, 
after word was received that he had faltered during his 
speech to the 3rd Congress of .the CGMI on the evening of 
29 September., hinges largely on the question of whether 
the decision to go was or was not taken before the 29th. 
Since the evidence is that the decision was made on the 
28th, it would seem that the theory that the coup was 
-143-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
triggered by something that occurred on the 29th, namely, 
the fact that Sukarno seemed to falter and need assistance 
in the midst of delivering a speech, must be discounted. 
On the afternoon of the 28th, Untung is reported 
to have informed Lt. Dul Arief that D Day was still not 
known but that he should await orders after the 29th. It 
would seem from this and other evidence that the military 
leaders of the coup were informed of the decision on D Day 
on the 29th. There is general agreement between the in-
terrogation reports of Untung, Sujono, Latief, and Supardjo 
that Sjam "issued the order that D Day would be the fol-
-lowing evening" at the last meeting of the coup group, 
which took place at Sjam's house on 29 September around 
2400 hours. The next morning, Untung informed Dul Arief 
that "the event would take place that evening." 
Though the military leaders were informed of the 
decision on the timing of the coup on the 29th, the deci-
sion seems to have been made on the 28th, by Aidit himself. 
That afternoon Aidit is known to have had a very long ses-
sion of almost 5 hours with Lukman, the number 2 man in 
the party, and Sakirman, a member of the CC/PKI; immediately 
afterward, Lukman and Sakirman left Djakarta by car for 
Semarang, where they waited for two days for the coup to 
begin.* Presumably, Aidit was giving them their last in-
structions before the coup 
*Lukman and Sakirman left Djakarta in Lukman's official 
car; they arrived in Semarang on the morning of 29 September 
and went straight to the house of an important PKI leader. 
According to several sources, they were visibly in a high 
state of nervousness. Apparently, they spent most of the 
day sitting around a transistor radio in the living room. 
The next morning they got up early to listen to the first 
news broadcast of the day. As the day went by, they grew 
more and more nervous. Lukman ordered his chauffeur to 
change the registration plates on his car and to take away 
the flag pole placed in the middle of the bumper. They 
stayed up late that night listening to the radio, but the

-144-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Within a short time of Lukman and Sakirman's depar-
ture from Djakarta, Anwar Sanusi and Nursukud of the CC/PKI 
were also on their way to different parts of the country; 
by the time of the coup, they would be in the Celebes and 
Sumber, respectively. The fact that these PKI leaders whom 
(footnote continued from page 144) 
news they were waiting to hear never was announced; finally, 
they went to bed. The next morning they heard Idntung's 
announcement on the radio while they were having breakfast; 
reportedly, everyone in the house was ecstatic. Soon after-
ward, Lukman and Sakirman moved to another house in Semarang 
where they spent the day and night of 1 October. 
The next morning Aidit came to that house and together 
they all left for Solo. Apparently, Lukman a9d Sakir-
man were quite surprised to see Aidit in Semarang. ' (This 
would seem to indicate that Aidit planned to remain in 
Djakarta if all had gone well with the coup. No doubt, he 
would have wanted to be close to Sukarno, especially if 
the President had Made some kind of formal statement en-
dorsing the coup.) Apparently, Lukman and Sakirman were 
confused about what had happened in Djakarta. Aidit re-
ported everything that had occurred, including Nasution's 
escape, and explained his purpose in coming to Central Java 
as that of preparing things for the arrival of Sukarno in 
Jogjakarta. 
An interesting sidelight to the story of the coup is 
the fact that Sakirman aid General Parman, one of the vic-
tims of the coup, were brothers--one, a high-level offi-
cial in the Communist party, and the other, a senior 
general in the Indonesian army and a staunch anti-Commun-
ist. Whether or not Sakirman realized ahead of time that 
his brother would be one of the generals killed in the 
coup 'is not clear; he may not have. After the coup, he 
seems to have been very much affected by his brother's 
death and full of regret about the coup. When Aidit saw 
him for the first time after the coup, that morning in 
Semarang, he is reported to have immediately offered 
Sakirman his "apologies and regret" on the death of his 
brother. 
-145-

Aidit had designated to coordinate party activities in 
crucial areas of the country after the coup left Djakarta 
on the evening of 28 September and/or the morning of 29 
September is not in itself conclusive evidence that the 
decision to start the movement on the night of 30 Septem-
ber-1 October had necessarily been taken by then; Aidit 
could have ordered Lukman and Sakirman and the others to 
Semarang and the other cities on the 28th with no definite 
idea of when the coup would begin other than that it would 
be within the next 2-3 days or so. However, it strongly 
suggests that Aidit had in fact decided on a definite date. 
According to Njono's confession, it was definitely Aidit 
who fixed D-Day for 1 October at 0400. All we can say for 
certain is that the decision was made sometime before the 
evening of 29 September, when it was communicated to the 
military leaders, that is, sometime between the evening 
of 27 September and the evening of 29 September. That 
leaves 28 September as the most likely time, especially 
since what we know of Aidit's own activities that last week 
in September also seems to suggest that the final decision 
was made on the 28th, when he is known to have had lengthy 
consultations with Lukman, the number 2 man in the party. 
After their meeting, there was a flurry of activity on 
the part of Aidit and the other PKI leaders that is sug-
gestive of the last minute preparations that would follow 
a definite decision to go ahead with the coup on the 30th.* 
Supardjo's arrival in Djakarta on 28 September at 
the PKI's call would seem to be another indication that 
the date for the coup had been decided by the 28th. As 
*As a sidelight to Aidit's activities the last two or 
three days before the coup, there is the fact that his 
wife returned to Indonesia from a year's study in North 
Korea on 27 September. Aidit and the children are report-
ed to have met her at the airport in Djakarta on the evening 
of the 27th. Thus, she was out of the country until three 
days before the coup. It seems most unlikely that she 
would have known about the coup planning before she returned

noted earlier, Supardjo was summoned from West Borneo by 
a prearranged signal that the coup was about to begin 
--namely, a telegram that his daughter was sick and he 
should come to Djakarta immediately; presumably, either 
Aidit or Sjam sent the telegram. In any case, Supardjo 
received it in the early afternoon of 28 September and 
left immediately for Djakarta. Arriving there later that 
same afternoon, he went first to his own home in Sunter 
and then directly to Sjam's house. In his own words: 
That afternoon I checked first at Sjam's house. 
I met him there and talked with him. Evidence 
regarding a council of generals obviously 
(footnote continued from page 146) 
to Indonesia. She claims not to have known about the coup 
at all. After her arrest by the Army after the coup, she 
told the Army interrogators that "prior to the coup I had 
not heard anything about the coup, nor were any insinua-
tions made." She said that she went to bed at 2000 hours 
on the night of 30 September and "heard about the coup 
the following morning over the radio and was shocked:" 
Some people have argued that Aidit would not have 
had his wife return to Indonesia if he had known that 
there was going to be a coup and, thus, he must not 
have known or been involved in the coup planning. This 
seems a ridiculous argument. Obviously, Aidit was confi-
dent of success and would bave seen no danger in Mrs. 
Aidit's returning to Indonesia just before the coup. 
Secondly, he would not have wanted to change her travel 
plans lest it arouse suspicion. It is an open question 
whether he told her about the coup after she got home. 
The very next day after her return, he made the final 
decision on the timing of the coup. 
-147-

existed, for example, the troop concentrations 
in Senajan and also the extraordinary activity 
that was taking place with the arrival of Army 
personnel in Djakarta. 
On the morning of the 29th I saw Dani. I gave 
him news from Sjam...I asked him what would 
happen if there was a coup and then I suggested 
that we go first with a countercoup. 
Supardjo's meeting with Dani on-the morning of 29 
September is obviously a very significant meeting in con-
nection with the coup. There is no evidence that Dani and 
Supardjo were more than acquainted with one another; cer-
tainly, they were not good friends and had had no regular 
contacts with one another. Thus, there was absolutely no 
reason for Supardjo to have reported to Dani as Commander-
in-Chief of the Air Force, except in connection with the 
coup. It must be remembered that he did not report to 
General Yani or Suharto or General Umar or any other of 
his commanding officers in the Army who should normally 
have been informed of his presence in Djakarta; indeed, 
he made every effort to keep his presence in Djakarta a 
secret from the Army. 
What Dani and Supardjo actually discussed at their 
meeting on 29 September is one of those things we will 
probably never know for sure about the Indonesian coup--just 
as we will probably never know for sure what Dani and 
Sukarno talked about when they met together privately that 
same morning. Obviously, it would tell us a lot about the 
coup, particularly about Sukarno's and Danl.'s roles in it, 
if we knew. It can only be presumed that Supardjo was 
informing Dani that the coup was about to take place; Sjam 
may well have told Supardjo the exact date that was set 
and Supardjo may have informed Dani of this, so that Dani 
could check it out with Sukarno. It is a well established 
fact that Dani was with the President early on the morning of 
the 29th, and the circumstances of their meeting leave no 
14S-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
doubt that it was a matter of great urgency and secrecy. 
Sukarno received Dani in his bedroom in the palace ahead 
of the other people who were waiting outside for their 
scheduled appointments with the President. This fact 
alone shows the access which Dani had to the President; 
it also suggests that Sukarno probably, knew what Dani had 
to discuss. In his interrogation, Dani explained the 
subject of their conversation as follows: 
I reported to the Pxesident that there was a 
group within the army which was dissatisfied 
with the Army leadership and which intended 
to make some changes. I said that I had heard 
about this from Gen. Supardjo. The President 
ordered me to meet him in Bogor on 3 October 
at 1000 hours together with Gene/al Supardjo. 
Upon reaching home, I sent a communication 
to Air Commodore Wattimena to summon General 
Supardjo because he had been summoned by theL 
President to appear on 3 October. At that 
moment General Supardjo arrived and so I sub-
mitted tu him the President's summons... .The 
next time I met Gen. Supardjo was at Halim on 
1 October. 
As noted before, Dani was often evasive in his testimony 
after the coup. One has the feelIng tnat he was certainly_ 
not telling the whole truth about has conversation with 
Sukarno on the 29th. He was not too likely to come right 
out and admit that his purpose in seeing Sukarno that morn-
ing was to convey a message to him from Aidit and Sjam, 
via Supardjo, that the coup would take place on the night 
of the 30th. Instead, he would certainly try to phrase 
it in such a way that it would look as though he had been 
concerned to warn the Presider:: about something� that he 
had just learned from General Supardo, that the troops 
under his command were restless and seemed about to take 
some kind of action. Actually, it would not have been too 
far from the truth to say that he lepol-ted to the President 
"that there was a group within the army which was dissatis-
fied with the Army leadership and intended to make some 
changes;" it would just not have been the whole truth. 
-149-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The matter of Dani's and Supardjo's scheduled appoint-
ment with Sukarno on 3 October is ambiguous. If Sukarno 
did in fact ask Dani and Supardjo to come to Bogor at 1000 
hours on the 3rd, it could have been for one of several 
different reasons. On the one hand, it could have been 
to receive the congratulations of the President for the 
part they were to play in the coup. On the other hand, 
it could have been for further discussions of the matter 
that Dani had raised with the President--namely, the like-
lihood of a coup or some other action against the top Army 
command from within the Army. If Sukarno had really been 
concerned about this possibility, however, it does not 
seem that he would have waited five days to explore the 
matter further with Dani and Supardjo. It is interesting 
that the President apparently just assumed that Supardjo 
would still be in Djakarta on the 3rd, although he must 
have known that Supardjo was away from his command in West 
Borneo without the knowledge or permission of his superiors 
in the Army. In the Army's eyes, Sukarno was definitely 
guilty of conspiring to keep Supardjo's presence in Djakarta 
a secret. In his speech of 12 February 1967 indicting 
Sukarno for his role in the coup, General Nasution made 
quite a point of the fact that Sukarno was one of the few 
people who knew that Supardjo was in Djakarta for reasons 
connected with the coup and yet he did not report this to 
the army. If the President expected to meet Supardjo on 
3 October, as he told Dani, he either expected Supardjo's 
presence in Djakarta to have become known and justified 
(as it would have been if the coup had been a success) or 
he expected to meet with him secretly. As it is highly 
unlikely that Supardjo could have come to the Palace in 
Bogor without being noticed, the fact that Sukarno made 
plans to receive him there on 3 October would seem to in-
dicate that Sukarno definitely thought that the coup would 
be a fait accompli by then. 
There were, of course, many ways that Aidit and Sjam 
could have communicated their decision on the timing of 
the coup to Sukarno. Dani's meeting with Sukarno on the 
morning of the 29th was just one possibility. According 
to one unconfirmed source, Aidit met with Subandrio that 
Same morning; there is no information as to what was dis-
cussed, but Subandrio could certainly have been trusted 
-159-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
to relay a message to the President.* Aidit was in the 
company of Sukarno himself later in the evening of 29 
September. They both addressed a meeting of university 
students in Djakarta. Although Aidit was not scheduled to 
speak, Sukarno is reported to have closed his speech with 
the words "Now we must hear from Aidit." In a short ex-
temporaneous speech, the PKI chairman explained that "the 
*The subject of Subandrio's involvement in the coup is 
discussed in the following section of the paper, which is 
concerned with events leading up to the decision on the 
part of the coup leaders to take violent action against 
the army leadership. Suffice it to say here that whereas 
Subandrio obviously knew about the plans for the coup, 
he was not actually involved in the planning and he did 
not participate in any way in the events of the coup it-
self. He was not even in Djakarta at the time; he had 
left town on the 29th in the company of NJOLO of the PKI 
and several other cabinet ministers on a speaking tour 
of North Sumatra. They had just arrived in Medan on the 
morning of 1 October when news of the coup was received 
there. On the eve of his departure, Subandrio is known 
to have conferred at length with Sukarno; the next morn-
ing he became very active, meeting with various cabinet 
ministers, including Aidit. Whether or not the coup was 
discussed at any of these meetings is unknown, but it 
probably was. On the night of 28 September. Sukarno 
would not yet seem to have known that the coup was defi-
nitely planned for the night of 30 September-1 October, 
so he could hardly have forewarned Subandrio of the pre-
cise time. However, they both must have known that it 
would be soon, most probably before Subandrio returned 
to Djakarta from his tour. Under the circumstances, they 
probably discussed what Subandrio should do when he re-
ceived word of the coup. On the morning of 29 September, 
Aidit would have known that the coup would take place 
the following night, so he could have told Subandrio then. 
Subandrio was obviously not surprised when ne received 
the news of the coup on the morning of 1 October. 
-151-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624

PKI had become great, precisely because it dared to do and 
to act; it was always prepared to act to implement its 
conclusions arrived at creatively." These words take on 
special meaning, in hindsight, when one realizes that they 
were spoken by a man who had the night before taken the 
fateful decision to alter the balance of power in Indonesia 
by violent means and that at that very moment preparations 
were well underway for the movement to start about the same 
time the following night. We will probably never know 
whether Aidit and Sukarno had the occasion for any private 
communication that evening. 
-The Eighth Meeting: The Order To Go 
At about the same time, however, the people who were 
responsible for the actual details of the coup were meet-
ing at another place in secret. It was the eighth--and 
last--meeting of the coup group. Once again, they met at 
Sjam's house; but this time there were four newcomers to 
the group, two whom Untung knew and two whom he did not, 
the first two being Gen. Supardjo and Walujo, Untung's PKI 
"contact" man from the Special Bureau, and the other two 
being two women whose identity remains unknown to this day. 
(Presumably, they were members of the Communist women's 
organization. the Gerwani, which was involved in the train-
ing exercises at Lubang Buaja, but this is not at all cer-
tain.) 
At this late date, the matter of the armored troops 
was still not solved and Untung was still worrying about 
it; it was the'first subject raised at the meeting. Ap-
parently. Latief had checked :he armored troops that had 
arrived in Djakarta for the Armed Forces Day celebration 
on 5 October, and a certain Lt. Susilo whom Sjam and Pono 
had said would be among tne troops was not there. It was 
hard to convince Pono that this could be so; he kept in-
sisting that the lieutenant just "had to be there" because 
it had been "arranged by a comrade in Bandung." (From this, 
it would appear that it was the fault of the PKI official 
in Bandung that the armor. that Sjam and Pono kept promising 
Untung never materialized; they too had been misled in 
-152-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
believing that everything had been taken care of.)* Ac-
cording to Untung, he asked Pono how they could possibly 
proceed with such vague assurances of armored support and 
no definite information that it was available.** Sjam 
was obviously not prepared to let the matter of the armor 
interfere with the orders he had from Aidit to begin the 
movement the next night. Under the circumstances, he was 
forced to overrule Untung on the one military question 
that uad been of prime importance to Untung and the other 
military leaders--the need for armored support. Sjam 
answered Untung that "as long as the PASOPATI troops were 
successful in their mission, the movement could go ahead 
without the cavalry." 
*Although it would seem that Sjam and Pono really 
believed that the Special Bureau in Bandung had made-the 
necessary arrangements to have armored support for the 
coup, it is possible that they were deceiving Untung on 
this point. They knew that he considered the Cavalry 
essential to the coup plans. They may have let him think 
that everything had been taken care of, right up to the 
last moment, when it was too late for him to back out 
of the coup or argue for a delay. He did not realize 
that the Cavalry would not be committed to the coup un-
til late on the 29th, less than 24 hours before the coup 
was scheduled to begin. 
**In his interrogation report, Latief also indicated 
that he had serious reservations about going ahead with 
the movement when it became "obvious that there were no 
tanks." He said: "In view of this situation I became 
hesitant regarding the movement and I said to Sjam that 
this was no game, this was a big thing." 
-153-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
At this point, Latief is reported to have asked 
Sjam about the plans after the generals had been "disposed 
of." Sjam replied that "after Phase I is completed, then 
we will send a delegation to the President."* In answer 
to Latief's question 'Who would be in the delegation?' 
*Sjam's comments about the delegation that would go 
to Sukarno are interesting, first of all, because that is 
precisely the plan that was followed. [It will be remem-
bered that Supardjo was the head of the delegation that 
went to the palace around 0600 hours on the 1st.] Nothing 
else was ever mentioned by Sjam or the other people at 
the September meetings as a follow-up plan to the kid-
napping missions; apparently, nothing else was planned. 
This is one of the best indications we have that the 
action that was planned as 'The 30 September Movement' 
consisted of the arrest and murder of the seven Army 
generals and a certain planned response from Sukarno; 
other than that, the only thing that was planned was the 
mass political support that, together with Sukarno's 
blessing, would have seemed almost certain to carry the 
day for the coup. 
-1S4-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Sjam replied "You will know this later." Thereupon, he 
issued the order that D day would be the following evening 
and the movement would be called the '30 September Move-
ment.'* 
It is of interest why the night of 30 September-
1 October was chosen as the time for the coup and why the 
movement was called "The 30 September Movement," when 
actually it got underway in the early mornihg hours of 
1 October and was proclaimed to the world on 1 October.** 
The most commonly heard explanation of the timing of the 
coup--that the 30th of September was not really chosen 
by the coup leaders as the ideal time for their coup but 
was thrust upon them by outside events, namely, the sud-
den turn for the worse (or what seemed like a sudden turn 
for the worse) in Sukarno's condition--has already been 
discussed and dismissed as the likely explanation. Some 
of the other explanations that have been offered include 
the following: 
It is possible that the reason the 30th of 
September was chosen is simply that it happen-
ed to be the night when Untung himself was 
on night-duty at the palace and could act 
with maximum freedom. Or because it was a 
Thursday night, a time when, in universal 
Javanese belief, magical forces are abroad 
*Later, when he was questioned about Sjam's announce-
ment of this decision, Latief told his army interrogators: 
"I asked Sjam if this was the decision of the CC/PKI and 
Aidit; if this was the case, we would accept it because 
it was the party speaking, despite the fact that we had 
a great many questions." 
**Sukarno was the only person to refer to the coup as 
the 1 October Movement. He used the Indonesian word 
"Gestok," meaning 1 October. The Army had invented an 
. ingenious acronym--Gestapu--from the Indonesian words for 
s "30 September Movement"--"Gerakan September Tija Puluh." 
They were using the word, with all its Nazi -Connotations, 
as the official name of the coup. Sukarno obviously was 
hoping to have "Gestok" accepted in place of "Gestapu". 
It never was. The word "Gestapu" will be forever associ-
ated with the Indonesian coup. 
-155-

and spiritual strength and support are most 
readily obtained. Malam Djumat begins at 
sundown on 30 September and continues until 
the new day breaks on 1 October. It is a 
night for melekan, the practice of staying up 
all night in prayer and meditation. We know 
that the night of the coup Mrs. Yani and 
General and Mrs. Parman were engaged in 
melekan. Thus, the 30th of September would 
have its own esoteric significance, indicat-
ing the moment of inspiration. 
Actually, none of these explanations is particularly con-
vincing. Untung was not on duty at the palace during the 
night of 30 September-1 October; he was expected to report 
for duty sometime around 0700-0800 the next morning. A 
little while before he was due to report, he simply called 
up and said that he would be late that morning. Thug, it 
really made no difference whether he was or was not on 
duty with the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard at the time of the 
coup. The particular associations which the 30th of Sept-
ember might have had for Untung and some of the other 
military leaders who were inclined toward mysticism would 
certainly not have been a major consideration with Aidit 
or Sjam or any of the other PKI leaders; and, if one thing 
is clear, it is that it was Aidit and the PKI who were 
responsible for the timing of the coup, certainly not Untung, 
who had reasons for wanting to delay. 
There was probably no special reason why the 30th 
of September was chosen as the date for the coup. As we 
have seen, Sjam had originally set the 29th as the date 
but had relaxed the deadline when Untung and the others 
convinced him that preparations could not possibly be com-
pleted by then. Apparently, Aidit and Sjam were determined 
that there should be no delay past the end of the month, 
however. September 30th was the last day they would con-
sider. Exactly why they felt that it was a matter of such 
urgency is not completely clear�whether it was because 
they genuinely feared some action by the Generals' Council 
on or before Armed Forces Day on 5 October or because they 
-156-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
were concerned about the security of their own plans, 
which by then involved a larger number of persons than 
could be counted on to keep the secret.* 
As for the decision to call the movement "The 30 
September Movement," Sjam probably thought of the move-
ment as beginning on the 30th, even though the actual raids 
on the generals' homes were not made until the early morn-
ing hours of the 1st. The troops were assembled at Halim 
that evening, and by midnight everything was ready to go. 
Aidit and Sjam may have had one definite reason for not 
wanting to call the movement "The 1 October Movement;" that 
is the association.of the date with Communist China's Na-
tional Day. It would have been assumed that the PKI was 
behind a coup in Indonesia that was named after the Great 
October Revolution in China. As it-was, the timing of the 
coup on 1 October was probably an unfortunate thing for 
the PKI; it suggested a certain connection betweent.the 
Chinese and the coup in Indonesia which, regardless of 
whether it was true or not, was used to discredit both 
the CCP and the PKI in Indonesia after the coup. The idea 
that "The 30 September Movement" was named for the day 
that the decision was actually taken to go ahead with the 
coup, as some observers have suggested, is not supported 
by the evidence, which leaves no doubt that the final deci-
sion was made at least a day or two before that. 
The Last-Minute PKI Preparations 
After the military leaders of the coup received the 
order from Sjam at the last meeting of the coup group on 
29 September that the movement, now officially called the 
*In the following section of the paper, which centers 
around the decision to stage the coup and the events lead-
ing up to that decision, Aidit's thinking with respect to 
the Generals' Council is examined in much greater detail.

30 September Movement, would begin the following evening, 
the word was quickly passed around town to the various 
people involved in the plot. For the next twenty-four 
hours, they would be engaged in frantic, last-minute pre-
parations that were somehow kept secret despite the 
flurry of activity. Njono, the Chief of the Greater 
Djakarta Committee of the PKI who was the PKI man in 
charge of the "operational-technical preparations" for 
the coup, including the organizing of a reserve force 
of PKI volunteers, who had been staying at Lubang Buaja 
with the volunteers, was notified of the decision about 
D-Day sometime around 1700 hours on 29 September, via a 
-PKI courier who was sent out to Halim. He immediately 
alerted the PKI organization for the Djakarta area. 
Sometime around midnight, the 5 PKI command posts in 
the city were issued orders to contact the party's 
"special security force" (TIK) members, which was what the 
volunteers who had received military training at Lubang 
Buaja were called; they were told to report to the command 
post headquarters "immediately." According to one source, 
the TIK troops were told that they might be away from home 
for a long period; they were instructed to bring only the 
clothing they had on, as they would be issued uniforms and 
weapons when they arrived at Lubang Buaja.* Several Air 
Force trucks were seen at one of the command headquarters 
that night, and it is believed that they were used to 
transport the troops to Lubang Buaja. At Lubang Buaja, 
*The volunteers who were interrogated by the Army after 
the coup gave very much the same story as to when and where 
they received the arms they used in the coup. Around noon 
on the 30th they were gathered together at Lubang Buaja 
and given firearms with the strict instructions "to pro-
tect the region, to suspect even their friends, and to shoot 
anyone attempting to flee." One volunteer recalled that 
"he and other youths were taken by bus to Lubang Buaja 
during the night of the 29th-30th and at 1400 hours the 
next day they received weapons and military clothing with 
the instruction to be on their guard against military 
activities in the area."

the volunteer troops joined the 1,500 volunteers who had 
arrived there the day before to begin their week of mili-
tary training in the 3rd training course to be conducted 
by the Air Force since 11 September. 
At Njono's order, the Djakarta PKI command posts 
advised the various field posts under their jurisdiction 
to be alert for action within the next 24 hours. Party 
members were instructed to give no assistance to military 
units unless the units were accompanied by known Party 
officials; if the military personnel were vouched for by 
PKI officials, the local field posts were to feed, shelter, 
and assist them in any way that was needed. 
Apparently, the party leaders received special brief-
ings, conducted by Sudisman himself; at the central commit-
tee office in Djakarta on the 29th. According to the in-
terrogation of PKI/CC member Suwardiningsih, SudisRan ex-
plained that senior officers in the Army would soon pre-
empt the coup of the Generals' Council and would establish 
a Revolutionary Council which the PKI would support. Suwardin 
ingsih was instructed to repeat the oral briefing to the 
Palembang Greater Regional Committee in South Sumatra;* 
*On 1 October, Suwardiningsih heard Untung's radio an-
nouncement. Using the name of Mrs. Sukono, she left Djak-
arta by plane at 1100 hours that morning and arrived in 
Palembang at 1230 hours. Her task was to deliver the oral 
instructions given her by Sudisman to the Palembang Regional 
Committee (CDB). At the Palembang CDB office, she met and 
discussed the situation with the CDB leadership. After 
she had delivered the instructions from Sudisman, she dis-
cussed the means for delivering these instructions down-
ward, how to muster broad support for the coup from the 
mass organizations, political parties, and important offi-
cials in Palembang, and how to undertake a broad campaign 
in the form of wall writing, pasting of placards, posters, 
etc. In the hope of getting the national front regional 
executive board to support the movement, she got the Palem-
bang CDB to issue a statement in support of the coup in 
(footnote continued on page 158) 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
presumably, she was one of several envoys of the CC/PKI 
sent by Sudisman to the various regional committees of the 
PKI for the purpose of mobilizing and leading the PKI pro-
gram in support of the coup. 
Some of the more important PKI leaders, like Pens 
Pardede, who were members of the Central Committee and 
Secretariat, had been briefed on the coup several days 
earlier. On 26 September, the members of the Secretariat, 
which Sudisman headed, were informed that a coup would 
take place sometime before 5-6 October, but no definite 
date was set. Sudisman explained that "since this action 
is to be purely a military one, our workers must carry out 
their work as normal. However, it is possible that the 
action may not succeed and therefore our personnel must 
be scattered, some in Djakarta and the rest in the regions." 
He asked Pens Pardede, who was present at the-meeting, 
if he had any preference as to where he would like to go; 
at his own request, Pardede was assigned to Medan. He was 
told to await later instructions when he would be informed 
of the exact date of the coup; he should be prepared to 
leave immediately after receiving that information. Ap-
parently, Pardede was informed of the decision on the tim-
ing of the coup on the 29th; he left Djakarta about 24 
hours later, in the early morning hours of the 1st, when 
the coup was just getting underway. Apparently he was 
surprised to discover, upon stopping by the ,CC/PKI: head-
quarters on the morning of the 30th, that the word about 
the coup had filtered down to the level of the ordinary 
(footnote continued from page 157)' 
its name. Altogether, Suwardiningsih held 4 meetings with 
the Palembang CDB leadership, on 1 October, 3 October, 
5 October, and 6 October. At the latter meetings they dis-
cussed the security measures taken by the state against 
the CDB office following the collapse of the coup; these 
included the seizure of all the CDB office equipment. At 
.the last meeting, Suwardiningsih warned her comrades to 
exercise great care and not to be disheartened by the wave 
of terror that was being organized against the PKI.

party workers, so quick had been the operation to inform 
party members of the secret undertaking in the offing. 
In-Pardede's own words; 
On 30 September at about 1100 I went to the 
office of the CC/PKI in Djakarta to pick up a 
handbag in order to leave on my "go-to-the-
people" trip. Upon arriving at the office 
the comrade who gave me the pouch by the name 
of Nurali, the deputy chief of staff of the 
CC/PKI secretariat, said to me 'When are you 
leaving?' I replied 'tomorrow, very early.' 
Then he said 'perhaps you will not be able 
to leave, because later on tonight the anti-
generals people will play their game.' He 
meant that they would stage a coup. I then 
asked 'Where did you hear this from?' He 
replied 'from Ngatman, whom I know as a membler 
of the Djakarta veterans executive board. 
I then said 'Report this to Sudisman.' He 
said 'Ahn, Bung Disman certainly already knows.' 
'Even so, let him know,' I said further. I 
didn't quite believe hearing this from a 
staff member, who in my thinking would not 
know anything about this....I continued to 
make preparations for the party's assignment 
to go to Medan; I left my house at 0200 on 
1 October. 
The Last-Minute Military Preparations  
With the PKI organization in Djakarta alerted to a 
coup within the next 24 hours and with envoys of the PKI/CC 
on their way to the regions to explain the coup, when it 
happened, to the people in the areas, a special briefing 
of the military commanders of the various units involved 
in the coup was held at Lubang Buaja around mid-day on the 
30th. Apparently, Latief was originally scheduled to 
give the briefing but for some reason he was unable to be 
there and so Dul Arief, the commander of the PASOPATI 
- troops which were charged with the kidnapping of the Army 
-161-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
generals, gave the briefing; neither Untung nor Sujono was 
present. Dul Arief explaindd the organization of the coup 
forces into three commands; The Kidnapping and Attacking 
Command (PASOPATI) under his leadership, the City Control 
Command (BIMASAKTI) under Capt. Suradi, and the Base Com-
mand (PRINGGODANI) under Major Gatot Sukrisno; the three 
commands would be responsible to a Central Command. He 
then explained the respective assignments of the command-
ers at the briefing. Lubang Buaja was to be "the main 
center of preparation, meaning that the troops participat-
ing in the coup would depart from there and return there." 
According to Ngadimo, one of the Company commanders from 
the 530th battalion, who was at the briefing, Dul Arief 
"essentially told the commanders to carry out their duties 
effectively and, if there was any opposition, to meet it 
with force." At the end of the briefing, he asked Ngadimo 
to explain the tactics to be used in the capture of the 
generals; Ngadimo elaborated the plan of attack that was 
used at each of the generals' homes: that of having one 
contingent of troops surround the house and another patrol 
the streets outside, while the third contingent went inside 
the house to bring the general out. 
We know very little about the activities of the coup 
leaders during the day of the 30th. Presumably, the mili-
tary officers were engaged in their regular military duties. 
Their activities in connection with the coup during the 
whole month of September had been pretty much limited to 
the evening hours, so as not to arouse suspicion by their 
being absent from work. No doubt, they would have been 
particularly careful the day before the coup to do nothing 
that was out of the ordinary and likely to attract any at-
tention. Sujono spent the day as he had spent the last 
three weeks�training the Communist volunteers at Halim. 
As far as is known, Untung and Latief were pefforming their 
normal duties with the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard and the 
1st Infantry Brigade, respectively. We have no reports on 
what Aidit, Sjam, Supardjo--or Sukarno and Dani--did during 
the day. There may well have been some kind of communica-
tion between them, perhaps even a meeting between certain 
of them, which would be of considerable interest in con-
nection with the coup; but there is no evidence of any.

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In the late afternoon, Sujono is known to have at-
tended to one matter of considerable importance to the coup: 
arranging for a safe place for the VIPs who were to be safe-
guarded at Halim. The duty was referred to as the VIP 
Security Command, and Sujono had been appointed commander 
of the VIP Security Command. Apparently, his orders were 
that the following persons were to be safeguarded at Halim: 
Sukarno, Subandrio, Aidit, All Sastroamidjojo, and Njoto.* 
On the afternoon of the 30th, Sujono is reported to have 
asked his aide, Sgt. Sujatno, "to look for a place where 
certain officials could be safeguarded." According to his 
own testimony, the officials he had in mind were Subandrio, 
Aidit, Ali Sastroamidjojo, and Njoto; he intended to find 
a place for Sukarno himself.** 
Apparently, Sujono was also in charge of the arrange-
ments for the use of the Aerial Survey Office in Djakarta 
as the Central Command headquarters of the coup. Me went 
*Obviously, these plans were made befcmait was known 
that Subandrio would be out of town at the time of the 
coup. If he had been in Djakarta, he would alnost certainly 
have gone to Halim, as both Sukarno and Aidit did. 
**Apparently, Sujono did not decide on a place, for 
Sukarno until the morning of the 1st. At 0530 hours on 
the 1st, he is reported to have gone to the home of Com-
modore Susanto which was located at Halim Air Force Base. 
It was decided than that Sukarno would come to Susanto's 
home when he arrived at the airbase later that morning. 
At 0600 hours, Sujono is reported to have stopped at the 
Operations Command Center at Halim to tell Dani, via his 
adjutant, that the President would arrive at Halim between 
0800 and 0900 hours and would be brought to Susanto's 
house. At 0630 hours, Sujono went back to the Aerial 
Survey Office building in Djakarta where Untung, Latief, 
Sjam, and Pono had established the Central Command. 
-163-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
to the Aerial Survey Office himself, sometime around 1730 
hours on the 30th, but apparently he was not successful 
in negotiating its use by the coup group the following day. 
He then asked Air Force Col. Herd, who must have had bet-
ter connections with the office, to arrange the matter. 
After Heru made the arrangements, he went to the Aerial 
Survey Office to prepare the building to serve as the coup 
headquarters. 
Sujono was occupied with a nu... oi other important 
errands during the evening and night of the 30th, such 
as checking on the supply of Air Force weapons for the 
volunteers and transporting Aidit to Halim. But somehow, 
he managed to squeeze in a review of the troops at Lubang 
-Buaja. The review had been scheduled for around midnight, 
and we know that Untung, Latief. Sjam,_Pono, and General 
Supardjo arrived there about 2230 hours;* Sujono and . 
Major Sukirno, the Commander of the 454th Battalion got 
there an hour or so later. The troops themselves had �been 
assembling at Lubang Buaja since early evening. Several 
of the units had been in a drill that afternoon in rehearsal 
of the military parade that was planned for Armed Forces 
bay on 5 October; Suharto himself had reviewed the drill 
only a matter of hours before these same troops were in-
volved in the coup action.** The troops had only just 
*Untung had gone to Sjam's house around 2100 hours. 
Apparently, it was arranged that the coup group would meet 
there because according to Untung, "the leadership party 
consisting of myself, Gen. Supardjo, Col. Latief, Sjam, 
and Pono went out to the Base in a civilian Toyota Jeep 
which belonged to Col. Latief and a Mazda which belonged 
to Sjam. Lubang Buaja was quite busy with troop prepara-
tions." 
**Somehow, the fact that he had reviewed the troops of 
the 454th the afternoon before the coup made it come as 
an even greater surprise to Suharto that they could have 
been involved in a coup against the Army Command that very 
-164-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
returned to the barracks from the day's duty when they 
were ordered to Lubang Buaja.* Thus, there had been no 
suspicious movement of troops during the daylight hours, 
just as there had been no unusual activity on the part 
of the military officers involved in the coup during the 
day. 
After their review of the troops at Lubang Buaja, 
the leaders of the coup were apparently satisfied that 
everything was ready for the operation to begin--although 
they were not totally happy with the preparations that had 
been made. At Lubang Buaja, they had received a last-
minute disappointment in discovering that "the prepara-
tions promisel !by Sujono--namely, the arranging for a 
unit of the Air Force Quick Action (PGT) troops--had not 
been made." It was suggested that the PGT troops be re-
placed "by a platoon of troops from the masses (i.e. the 
Communist volunteers) under the leadership of Capt. Gatot." 
However, Col. Latief and Untung rejected this becaue "the 
troops could not be guaranteed"--in Untung's words. (This 
is another indication that the coup leaders never intended 
the Communist volunteers to play a role in the operation 
to seize the generals or surround the palace and radio 
station; they thought of them as a reserve force in the 
*Apparently, the staging ground for the regular mili-
tary troops involved in the coup was a little removed 
from the training site of the Communist volunteers, even 
though they were both at Lubang Buaja; so the two groups 
were never in close proximity. This would seem to be the 
explanation for the vagueness of many of the regular mili-
tary men involved in the coup on the question of the part 
played by the Communist volunteers in the coup. It will 
be remembered that the volunteers were not involved in 
any of the raids on the generals' homes or the operation 
to neutralize the palace and the radio station; they ap-
peared on the scene in Djakarta much later in the day, 
when the silent struggle for Djakarta was almost over 
and the city back in the hands of Suharto and the Army. 
-165-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624

defense of Halim only--and possibly, later, as a spearhead 
for the political mass action program that was planned in 
support of the coup, if all had gone according to plan.) 
According to Untung: 
it was rather disappointing that the prepara-
tions of Maj. Sujono were not too good. When 
Lt, Dul Arief reported to me that the PGT 
troops were not there, I told him to regulate 
the PASOPATI assignments with less personnel 
since one target was missing, namely, General 
Sukendro,* Then, Lt. Dul Arief gave a final 
briefing. After the briefing was over, at 
0130 hours on 1 October, the PASOPATI troops 
pulled out towards their targets, with the 
stipulation that D hour was 0500 hours. The 
leaders, namely I myself, Gen. Supardjo, Col. 
Latief, Sjam, and Pono went to the first head-1. 
quarters in the Aerial Survey Office Building. 
We arrived there about 0200 hours. 
As mentioned earlier, the great majority of the troops 
involved in the coup action seem to have had no real under-
standing of the drama in which they played a part. They 
were given only the one briefing by Dul Arief shortly be-
lore they departed on their mission into Djakarta. .As he 
explained it, the Generals' Council was going to stage a 
coup against Sukarno; as members of the Tjakrabirawa Palace 
Guard and other units loyal to Sukarno, they had been 
called upon "to effect the personal security and safety 
of the President." Sukarno was reported to be in "great 
danger" and the palace about to be "attacked." Dul Arief 
may have mentioned something about some kidnappings that 
were planned; if not, some of the troops must have learned 
about them from some other source. After the coup, a 
*As noted earlier, Gen. Sukendro was in China at 
the time of the coup. Had he been in Djakarta, there would 
hive been eight generals--rather tharnseven--as the targets 
of the 30 September Movement. 
-166-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
number of them confessed to having known that "some people 
were to be kidnapped although it was not known who." It 
is doubtful that the commanders could have gotten the men 
to follow them, if they had known who the victims of the 
kidnappings would be. This was kept a secret--until the 
very moment when the trucks carrying the PASOPATI troops 
stopped in front of the generals' homes. The troops sent 
to surround the palace were similarly tricked into believ-
ing that they were going to guard the President who was 
supposed to be in the palace. Just as Aidit and the PKI 
had calculated, the men had simply followed the orders 
of the commanders; the PKI had been right in thinking 
that all the party had to do was to win the loyalty of 
the commanders. 
At the very moment when his strategy for the coup 
seemed about to be vindicated, Aidit was being escorted 
to Halim by one of the military commanders whose loyalty 
he had won. According to Sujono, Supardjo ordered him 
to pick up Aidit around 0130 hours on the 1st. It is 
not clear whether Sujono met Aidit at Sjam's house or 
the house of a certain Soegito; there are conflicting 
stories. Aidit definitely was accompanied by two body-
guards, who stayed with him the whole day of the 1st 
while he was at Halim, and who accompanied him on the, 
plane on his flight from Halim to Jogjakarta on the morn-
ing of the 2nd. According to Sujono again, Supardjo 
asked him to report to Aidit that there had been no 
change as far as D-hour was concerned; it was still 
planned for 0500 hours. 
I recall that at the time Aidit asked: 'Where 
will I be taken?' I told him that he would 
be taken to Halim directly, and then he ques-
tioned me further, asking about 'whose place,' 
and I replied that it would be the home of 
one of my subordinates. He then asked me if 
the house was very far from the air base and 
I answered that it was two-and-a-half kilo-
meters. Then he asked if Supardjo, Latief, 
-161-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
and Untung were at the Command Center. I 
said that as far as I could tell they had 
not yet had time to arrive at the Aerial 
Survey Office....Then we went to Halim. 
After we arrived there, I reported to 
Supardjo that Aidit had arrived at the 
designated security locatiOn.. 
Soon after he reported to Supardjo at the Aerial 
Survey 'Office, Sujonowas off again to Halim, again on the 
orders of Supardjo, to make arrangements for Sukarno's 
Stay at Halim. 
I got in touch with Commodore Susanto, who 
indicated his readiness and willingness (to 
have Sukarno spend the day at his home). I 
reported this to Dani, who was at the Opera-
tions Command Center at Halim. Dani orOpred 
me to be sure that effective securities were 
taken with regard to the protection of the 
President. I then returned to the Aerial 
Survey office, at a little past 0630 hours. 
As I arrived, I noticed Gen. Supardjo, Major 
Bambang of the 530th and Major Sukirno of 
the 454th, and Lt. Col. Heru, all dressed -in 
full military attire. When I asked them 
where they were going, they said they were 
going to the President's Palace. 
It was not long after this that I received 
a report from Major Gatot Sukrisno, the com-
mander of the troops guarding Halim, verifying 
that the generals had been turned over to 
him and asking what should be done with the 
ones who were still alive. Latief ordered me 
to answer the inquiry in writing, with the 
words 'By the order of the Chief of Staff of 
the Command Center, the ones remaining alive 
should be done away with.' 
The order had been given. The 30 September Move-
tent ,was a fact: '

The Prelude 
The evidence is overwhelming that the PKI planned 
the 30 September Movement in every detail. It decided 
who would lead the movement, what military units would 
be involved in the operation, which generals of the Army 
would be killed, when the coup would take place, what 
VIPs would be safeguarded at Halim, and how the political 
campaign in support of the coup would be managed after-
wards. That it got others to execute the deed does not 
change the fact that it was primarily responsible for the 
whole affair. If we accept this as a fact, proven beyond 
any reasonable doubt, we have still to explain it, in the 
light of certain other things we know to be true about 
the Indonesian scene at the time of the coup. For in-
stance, why should the PKI, a party which for fifteen years 
had adhered consistently to a policy of peaceful, cpnsti-
tutional struggle and which by that struggle had advanced 
to a position closer to the seat of power than any other 
free world Communist party, suddenly have decided to risk 
everything on a military coup? 
Probably the first thing to be established in seek-
ing the answer to that question is whether or not there 
had been any change--which might not have been recognized 
at the time--in the PKI's thinking on the matter of proper 
tactics for the party to follow on the domestic scene. 
It would seem that there either had to be some basic 
change in the thinking of the leadership, particularly 
Aidit, or else there had to be extenuating circumstances 
that suddenly made the PKI act contrary to its own estab-
lished policy. 
PKI Domestic Policy 
Ever since D.N. Aidit, in the aftermath of the 
Madiun Rebellion of 1948, began picking up the pieces of 
- a shattered PKI, the party's policy had been one of peaceful, 
constitutional activity and close cooperation with those 
political groups and forces in the new republic which might 
acquiesce in such collaboration. At the time, such a policy 
had seemed essential to the bare survival of the party,

to say nothing of its regrowth. As the years passed, it 
proved a remarkably successful policy in terms of the 
advances made in PKI membership, mass following, and 
political influence.* As Sukarno found the party an 
increasingly useful balancing force to the Army, which 
represented the most serious threat to his leadership, 
the PKI reaped the greatest advantage of all from its 
policy of collaborating with the '"nationalist-bourgeoisie" 
in its winning of the President as its great benefactor. 
With Sukarno's protection and encouragement, the PKI actually 
became the predominant party in Indonesia; by 1960 it could 
be said it was "directing the whole course of Indonesian 
politics." Adam Malik, the present Foreign Minister of 
Indonesia has analyzed its success; "-it was due not so much 
to any majority that it possessed or might possibly gain, 
but to the protective hand of Sukarno. Mainly because of 
this, the PKI, a minority, assumed the quality of a majority." 
In the situation of Indonesia's headlong slide towards 
the left, with Sukarno and the PKI in the4ead, the time 
seemed near at hand when the Communists would take over 
control, of the country--either with the passing of Sukarno 
from thq scene, or possibly before that. Most observers in 
the West conceded this.** The Soviets and the Chinese seem 
*Aidit built the PKI from a party of less than 10,000 
members in 1951 into the third largest Communist party in tne 
world (behind the CCP and the CPSU) and the largest party 
outside the bloc. Party membership was over 2,000,000 in 
1963 and over 3,000,000 in 1965. On the Indonesian scene, 
the PKI was not only the largest party in terms of membersrir, 
but it was the best organized and most dynamic political 
entity in the country. 
**By 1964, it was the reasonable conclusion of all Indo-
nesian experts that Indonesia would soon become a Communist 
state. Guy Pauker, writing in November 1964, was of the 
opinion that "even if the Communists ghould lose Sukarno as 
a protector, it seems doubtful that other national leaders 
would emerge in the near future capable of t'allying Indone-
sia's dispersed and demoralizedrahtiCCommunitt'forces. 
Furthermore, these forces would lack the ruthlessness that 
made it possible for the Nazis to suppress the Communist 
Party of Germany a few weeks after the elections of 
5 March 1933, in which the latter won 5 million votes or 
almost 13 percent of the total."

to have been reasonably confident of it. Indonesians 
seemed resigned to it.* Certainly, the PKI had good 
reason to believe it. 
On the basis of these acamplishments, the do?-
mestic policies of the PKI could only have been judged 
an unqualified success. Aidit himself was probably 
more confident than ever of the correctness of the PKI 
line, which was closely associated with him personally 
He had been the one to formulate the strategy of the 
"united front and the party's growth" which had been 
the party strategy since 1951; before that, the party 
had been engaged in an underground struggle (1926-45) 
and then the struggle against the Dutch (1945-51); it 
had no history or experience in the kind of "peaceful 
tactics" that Aidit mapped out for the party as the road 
to power in an Indonesia under Sukarno. 
Although Aidit seems to have enjoyed considerable 
support within the PKI leadership on domestic policy, 
presumably some of the leaders felt more strongly in 
favor of these policies than others. While there was 
no public airing of the differences within the party 
and all the PKI leaders gave the same party line in any 
public: discussion of an issue, domestic or international, 
there does seem to have been some differences in emphasis 
between the speeches of Aidit and Njoto..* For instance, on 
the theme of "armed struggle" versus "peaceful transition 
to socialism" as the correct road for the PKI in Indonesia, 
Njoto!s: speeches emphasized the armed struggle_going. 
on in other places, such as Cuba,afid;Algeria._ .(See,.Njoto's 
speech of 6 February 1963.) While Aidit could be ex-
pected tompport these revolutionary movements, his 
speeches concentrated on the struggle in Indonesia and 
the particular tactics of the PKI in that struggle. Ae - 
the success of these tactics became more and more obvious, 
Aidit spoke with greater and greater conviction and an 
increasing note of authority about the PKI's contribution 
(and implicitly, his own contribution) to Marxist theory 
on the assumption of power; it became a predominant theme 
in his speeches. On 12 October 1964 he answered a series 
of questions on the PKI and the Indonesian revolution with 
the unprecedented claim that: 
*Iw,Indonesia, just before the coup, overt anti-communism 
had become virtually a crime; even the military paid lip 
service to the huge PKI-sponsored rallies. Everything rein-
forced the idea that the PKI would take over after Sukarno died. 
-171-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Among the world communist parties the PKI is the one 
that has the most authority to talk about the 'peaceful  
transition' toward socialism, because the PKI takes part 
in both the central and local governments and it has the 
actual potential to carry out its policies. 
The rapid development of the PKI is a result of its 
correct policy, a policy of resolute opposition to 
imperialism and the establishment of a National Front 
in Indonesia....It is because of this correct political 
and organizational line that the PKI has now become a 
party with a membership of over 3 million, while in 
1951 it had only 8,000 members. (Emphasis added) 
As long as Aidit had been Chairman of the PKI, the party had 
rejected the Chinese model of violent -agrarian revolution as 
impractical in Indonesian conditions. Right up to the time 
of the coup, there was no sign that it had changed it views 
.on the subject. 
It hardly seems necessary to point out that Aidit 
obviously considered his policy of "peaceful transition to 
socialism" only as a means to an end. As a Communist, he 
was certainly not opposed to armed struggle or violence; 
he just did not consider it the best policy for the PKI at 
that time. That he adthitted the'possibility of the PKI's 
resorting to armed struggle sometime in the future was made 
clear in a private conversation he had with Phillip Abbott 
Luce, a member of the U.S. Progressive Labor Party and a 
Castro sympathizer, who met Aidit in Cuba in July 1963 
they were both attending Cuba's 26 July National Day celt�
brations. In his book The New Left (1966) Luce writes: 
One evening I spent nearly two hours in a private con-
versation with Aidit, who told me that the PKI was con-
temptuous7of the CPUSA. The PKI was only using the 
democratic process in Indonesia to the advantage of the 
Communists. He assured me that as soon as it appeared 
as if the Communists were beginning to lose in the bid 
for power, they would institute a guerrilla war and 
topple the government. 
No driubt, if Aidit had ever become convinced that the Commu-
nists were losing out in the struggle.for power, he,would 
have opted for armed struggle. However, the possibility uf 
this happening must have seemed very remote to him in 1963, 
*Indonesian Ambassador Ratnam, who knew Aidit well, described 
(footnote continued on page 173.) 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
when he made the above statement to Phillip Abbott Luce; 
and in 1964 and 1965 it would have seemed remoter still. 
With each passing day, it looked more and more as though 
Indonesia was about to fall into the hands of the Communists. 
The PKI's Armed Capability 
If Aidit had been seriously concerned about the 
possibility of the PKI having to resort to armed force, 
it seems that he would have done more to develop an armed 
capability for the PKI. Just what capability the PKI 
actually had for armed struggle is still open to some ques-
tion. There are a number of reports that the Chinese were 
shipping arms to the PKI. According to these reports, 
the arms were being off-loaded at several different places 
along the coast of Java and Sumatra and were being stored 
in PKI "safe" places nearby. Despite the persistence of 
such reports, there is no convincing evidence that they 
were true. No great store of PKI arms has ever been 
found, before or after the coup. (The few caches of arms 
that the Indonesian Army is reported to have discovered 
at various outlying locat.lons along the coast, which are 
probably the basis for the reports of Chinese arms being 
shipped to the PKI, have never been definitely linked to 
the PKI.) It is almost unbelievable that PKI stores of 
arms could have remained a secret after the coup, when 
thousands of party members were interrogated by the Army. 
Nor is it likely that hidden supplies of arms would not 
have been used by the PKI against the Army during those 
days of the Army's mass repression of the party, but the 
fact is that the Communists did not fight back and were 
not armed to resist the Army. So, in conclusion, the PKI 
does not seem to have brought a supply of arms and ammuni-
tion into Indonesia over the years or over a period of 
several months before the coup, as has been reported again 
and again in connection with the coup. The charge has 
been made and repeated so often that it is sometimes dif-
ficult to establish the source of the reports; but they 
would all seem to be without foundation.

him as "a dedicated Communist, a witty conversationalist, 
and absolutely ruthless"; "he would have sacrificed any 
friend on the spot."

In part, the explanation for the persistent but 
apparently erroneous reports of Chinese arms being shipped 
to the PKI is that these reports have been confused with 
other reports, which do seem to be true, of Chinese arms 
"being included in shipments of Chinese materials for Sukar-
no's CONEFO complex in Djakarta. Apparently, some Chinese 
arms were definitely discovered in crates marked "Construc-
tion materials--CONEFO"; all of the crates in question 
came into Indonesia through the Djakarta harbor. Accord-
ing to several reliable sources, Sukarno had issued an 
order that the shipments of materials for CONEFO be moved 
directly from the harbor to the CONEFO construction site; 
they were not to go through the usual customs inspection 
and processing. It was explained that this was to avoid 
unnecessary delay, and it was known that Sukarno was in 
a great hurry to finish the CONEFO project. With the 
revelation that covert shipments of arms were included 
in the shipment of building materials, however, it seems 
clear, in hindsight, that Sukarno was actually making the 
necessary arrangements to protect the delivery of Chinese 
arms that were being shipped to Indonesia secretly. Ob-
viously, he had negotiated a secret arms deal with the 
Chinese. As we have already seen, the Chinese arms that 
were being received in Djakarta were being stored in Air 
Force depots in and around the city. So, the reports that 
Chinese arms were being shipped into Indonesia were true. 
But it was Sukarno, not the PKI, who was receiving the 
arms. They might or might not have been used by the PKI 
and others in training for the "fifth force," if that prd-
gram had gotten underway. Before it did, they were used 
in the coup--by the PKI volunteer troops that had received 
a quick course in military training for the specific pur-
poses of the coup. It was the Air Force, not the PKI, 
that made the arms available to the volunteer troops. 
Besides the matter of arms, there is the question 
of military training that the PKI might have been giving party 
members. Prior to the start of the special military train-
ing course at Lubang Buaja, which was given to some 4,0016 
volunteers from the PKI for the particular purposes of the 
coup, the last three weeks before the coup, party members 
are not known to have received military training in Indone-
Sia. Apparently, lectures in military theory and strategy 
were given at the higher party school, bit only the lead-
ership levels of the party atteAded these courses and 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
actual military training was not involved. The only 
military training that ordinary party members are known 
to have received was a course in "military tactics and 
the art of revolution" that the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCP) gave selected foreign Communists at a school near 
Kunming, China. We have inadequate information as to the 
number of Indonesians who might have attended this school 
but it was certainly a very small number in relation to 
the membership of the PKI.* 
In conclusion, then, the PKI had no significant 
capability of its own for armed action as late as November 
1964, when Aidit founded the Special Bureaunto prepare for 
armed struggle;" certainly, any armed capability that it 
had was far less than was generally thought at the time, 
when there were constant rumors of Chinese shipments of arms 
to the PKI and military training that was supposedly being 
given to PKI party members. Probably the main reason why 
Aidit had decided against a policy of training alid arming 
the PKI (which would have involved the covert shipment of 
relatively large quantities of arms from Communist China) 
was that he was unwilling to take the risks involved in 
such a program. If it became known (and it would have been 
very hard to keep it a secret) that the PKI was actively 
preparing for armed struggle, it would have vitiattd his 
whole effort over the past 15 years to create just the 
opposite image of the PKI--as a party that operated entirely 
within the legal political system of the country. He was 
obviously concernec: not to risk anything that would seri-
ously compromise the PKI's policy of peaceful transition 
to socialism," which he considered the key to the PKI's 
success during the past 15 years and its best hope of 
winning power in the future. 
The PKI's Covert Apparatus  
With this reason for not wanting to get the PKI 
involved in the illegal business of secreting arms into 
*According to one member of the PKI youth organization 
who admitted to having received pare-military training in 
China, approximately 300 Indonesians were at the same 
military training school near Kunming in October 1965.

Indonesia or in a military training program on a mass 
scale, Aidit had made no effort to provide the PKI with its 
own armed force. Yet, because he could not definitely 
rule out the possibility of the PKI's having to resort to 
armed force sometime in the future, if things suddenly 
changed for the worse, he seems to have been concerned to 
develop some kind of covert apparatus, distinct from the 
overt apparatus of the party, which could be assigned the 
task of preparing for armed struggle, should that ever 
become necessary. 
In late 1964, he seems to have followed the Chinese 
Communist prescription for an "illegal shadow organization" 
separate from the legal, overt Communist party in setting up 
a new covert organization within the PKI, whose special 
purpose it would be to prepare for armed struggle. It was 
a "secret, revolutionary organization," in the sense that 
the Chinese use the term to refer to the illegal, secret 
party organization that directs the illegal struggle that 
is carried out independently of the legal struggle: 
Illegal struggle refers to the status of 
the strugglers, not to the nature of the 
techniques emploTTa. The illegal, secret 
party is not simply a party which has been ' 
banned by the law or which has made the 
decision to engage in armed insurrection. 
Such a party is a known party--its leaders 
and members are identified even though they 
may be in hiding or in a jungle insurgent 
camp. The very existence of the secret 
party is unknown, its personnel are unknown 
as Communists, its work is carried on in 
complete anonymity. It is unknown not 
only to hostile security forces and the 
general public--it::is unknown even to all 
except a few of the overt party. The 
cadres of this party are not in hiding--
on the contrary they are living open, 
normal lives in the community. It is 
their status as members of a secret, rev-
olutionary organization, dedicated to the 
violent overthrow of the regime, which is 
Illegal. 
-176-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The new organization--called the Special Bureau�was a 
completely autonomous organization within the PKI, answer-
able only to Aidit. It had absolute authority over its 
own organization, administration, personnel, logistics, 
and everything else. Not only was it completely free of 
the control of the central committee and the politburo, 
but the members of the central committee and the politburo 
were not even informed of its existence, must less of the 
identity of its members. This was in keeping with Chinese 
Communist doctrine: 
Only the center of the secret party had any 
contact whatever with any element of the 
legal party. Only the topmost leadership 
of the legal party knows of even the existence 
of the secret party much less the identities 
of its members,and even this topmost leader-
ship knows the identity only of the secret L 
center. 
It is not clear who, besides Aidit, knew anything about 
the Special Bureau. PKI leader Njono insisted in his in-
terrogation that "knowledge of the party's secret organi-
zation was held exclusively by Party Chairman Aidit." It 
seems fairly clear that neither Njono nor Pens Pard4de, 
both of them politburo members, had any specific knowledge 
of the Special Bureau; apparently, Sudisman and Sakirman, 
members of the five-man Standing Council of the Politburo, 
were not informed either. Lukman and Njoto, the other 
two members of the Standing Council along with Aidit, 
would seem to be the only ones who might have known, 
though there is nothing to indicate that even they did. 
This is one of those points that we may never know for 
sure; there may be only one man alive today who knows 
the answer�Sjam.* 
In its organization, as well as its discipline, 
the Special Bureau followed the Chinese prescription. 
There was a Central Special Bureau and 10 regional Special 
Bureaus; horizontal relations among the regions bureaus 
were not permitted. Again, this was in keeping with 
Chinese doctrine that: 
*As noted previously, President Suharto has denied 
Sjam's appeal for clemency, and it is expected that his 
death sentence will be executed shortly. There are un-
confirmed reports that he has already been executed. 
-177-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
there must be no lateral communication 
between parallel units of the secret party, 
not only at the cell level, but all*the 
way to the top. Only one person in a 
subordinate unit is to be known to the 
next higher unit. Any coordination of 
activity must be done by vertical communi-
cation up to and down from the center. 
The following Chinese discussion of the role of the 
individual member of an illegal Communist party could almost 
have been written about Sjam, Pono, Walujo, and the other 
_members of the Special Bureau and the work they were doing 
to subvert the Indonesian Army: 
The illegal party member must make friends 
on a wide scale--people who respect him, 
have faith in him and in the end will fol;pw 
his leadership . . . He must also be a dili-
gent student of his surroundings, both 
physical and social. He must be aware of 
the contradictions in society. He must 
seek out those elements in the community 
who have grievances against the regime, 
such as army officers who resent political  
control, waste of money and military  
inefficiency, or religious leaders who 
find the society increasingly immoral and 
profligate, or peasants who suffer from 
neglect of their needs. 
(Emphasis added) 
The illegal party worker is obviously primarily concerned to 
establish himself in his profession and in the community at 
large as a person whom others admire and respect and whose 
lead they will follow. He is not necessarily concerned to 
convert others to Communism; in fact, he may not even reveal 
himself as a Communist. He is simply interested in estab-
lishingisome sort of control over certain key people, who, 
for one reason or another, are in a position to influence 
events in a way favorable to the communists. 
From a variety of sources, we now have a fairly clear 
picture of the operations of the Special Bureau. The most 
striking thing about those Bureau operations is that, with 
few exceptions, they were all concentrated in the military 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
field--which was not exactly according to Chinese Communist 
doctrine on the subject. The Chinese model calls for infil-
tration of the entire fabric of society� the illegal party 
organization is not usually so totally directed toward the 
military. Obviously, Aidit and Sjam felt no great concern 
about the PKI's strength vis-a-vis- the other political 
parties or in the mass organizations or among the peasants 
or in the government, et alia. In concentrating their 
covert activities so completely on the military, they were 
obviously concerned about just one thing: the threat too 
the PKI from the military. 
In the case of the military, priority would obviously 
be given to winning the loyalty of the men in command 
positions. If the PKI could win their loyalty, it could 
count on the men under their command to follow their orders; 
in a showdown with the army these units would defect to 
the side of the PKI. There can be no doubt that the whole 
operation of the Special Bureau was aimed at the officers 
in just such key positions. One can go down the list of 
military officials "managed" by the PKI Special Bureau, 
and almost without exception, they held some command post, 
either a company command or command of a battalil5n or a 
special unit like the Special Defense Force at Halim Air 
Force Base or, even, a command like the 4th Combat Command 
of KOSTRAD in West Borneo, which General Supardjo held. 
Dani was almost a special case as Commander of the entire 
Air Force; with him, the PKI had penetrated right to the 
top of the Indonesian military comman& 
Itmust be remembered that the Special Bureau had 
been organized less than a year before it was given the 
job of planning the military operation of the'30 September 
Movement.' By the time of the coup, the Central Bureau, 
which managed contacts in Djakarta only, had established 
a pattern of regular contacts with over 40 officials, most 
of them military officials but a few of them non-military 
government officials, in Djakarta. We have no way of 
estimating the number of people who were being "managed" 
by the ten regional bureaus. Sjam himself did not know 
them all, since "it was the right of each regional bureau 
to conceal this information;" he could remember the names 
-179-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of only 12 of the regional "contacts" but he indicated 
that there were "many others."* 
*New information indicates that PKI contacts in the 
military may have been even more widespread than we first 
thought on the basis of Sjam's testimony. From the in-
terrogation of Sjam, Untung, Latief, and the other mili-
tary officers involved in the planning for the coup in 
Djakarta, we have a fairly good picture of the operations 
of the Central Special Bureau in Djakarta, but we are 
just beginning to get some picture 0f the extent of the 
Special Bureau operations in Central and West Java, where 
there were regional bureaus of the Special Bureau. We 
still have no information on the role of the Special 
Bureau in events in Semarang, Jogjakarta, and Solo or the 
day of the coup, but presumably Col. Suherman, Major 
Muljono, and Major Iskandar, who followed Untung's lead 
in establishing Revolutionary Councils in these three 
cities, were "contacts" of the Special Bureau, just like 
Untung, Latief, Sujono, Dani, and Supardjo. It seems 
that the Special Bureau must have been responsible for 
coordinating events in these cities with those in Djakarta. 
In late July 1968, the Indonesian Army was shocked 
to learn the extent of PKI penetration in the KODAM VI 
Military Region Command of the Siliwangi (West Java) Divi-
sion of the Army, which was believed to be one of the Army - 
most reliable units. The deputy commander of KODAM NI 
(Col. Djukardi Sastradiwiria) was arrested in July on 
suspicion of involvement with the PKI. His testimony is 
a good example of recent information we have received 
on PKI operations in West Java. Djukardi told of being 
introduced to Sjam around 1953-54. He said that Sjam ex-
plained to him that he was a member of the PKI Malam 
(Night) and that, in contrast to the PKI Siang (Day) whose 
members were overt, PKI Malam members were secret and 
compartmented from each other. Djukardi was in regular 
contact with Sjam until 1958 or 1959. After this he was 
visited by a man named Rachmat, who had a letter of intro-
duction from Sjam. According to Djukardi, Rachmat con-
tacted him in August 1965 and told him about Sukarno's 
(footnote continued on page 181) 
-180-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
By late 1965, the PKI had made a good beginning in 
subverting crucial elements in the military, and it had 
plans for extending its operations in this field and in 
supporting fields, such as the police field. Given a 
few more years, it might well have managed to subvert 
enough military officers to make it a real contest between 
the anti-Communists and the pro-Communists in the mili-
tary. As it was, by late 1965, even though it was not 
in a position where it would have wanted to risk a general 
test of strength with the military, it was in a position 
where it could at least contemplate carrying out a limited 
military operation--such as the kidnapping of a number of 
Army generals and the seizure of a few key installations 
in Djakarta. A practical measure of the military strength 
(footnote continued from page 180) 
illness and about the plan of the Council of Generals to 
seize political power. Rachmat asked him to make mili-
tary preparations within the KODAM VI Area Command to 
anticipate the generals' coup. In early September 1965, 
Rachmat and Djukardi are supposed to have met with Sjam 
and Supardjo in Bandung to discuss the plans for the.dcoup. 
Later in September, they met with other military officers 
in KODAM VI to discuss the kidnapping or killing of senior 
Siliwangi Division officers. When, according to Djukardi, 
he declined to take command of the KODAM VI coup forces, 
Rachmat said he 'would take command himself. Djukardi 
gave the names of at least 16 other officers in KODAM VI 
whom he knew to be contacts of Rachmat. 
This is about the best evidence we have that the 
Special Bureau planned kidnapping/murders of senior Army 
officers in other cities than Djakarta. The similarity 
between the KODAM VI coup planning and the action taken 
by Col. Suherman, Major Muljono, and Major Iskandar against 
senior officers of the Diponegoro (Central Java) Division 
makes it clear that the Special Bureau organized events 
in Semarang, Jogjakarta, and Solo just as it planned and 
organized the kidnapping/murders of the Army generals in 
Djakarta.

of the PKI in late 1965 would actually be the 30 September 
Movement. It seems that almost all the resources of the 
Special Bureau were involved in the coup. We know that 
Aidit was concerned to commit the maximum number of troops 
at his disposal to the coup action, even to the extent 
of rushing the training of some 4,000 volunteer troops 
as an auxiliary force; most of the known "contacts" of 
the Special Bureau played some role in the coup. In 
short, the coup was the supreme military effort that the 
PKI was capable of at that time. It bespeaks both the 
success of the Special Bureau's program of subversion in 
the Armed Forces that the PKI could even bring off such 
a thing as the kidnapping of the Army.s whole top command 
and also the general state of unpreparedness of the PKI 
at the time for an all-out challenge from the military. 
In summary--Aidit had all along tended to belittle 
the chance of a military challenge of the P1(1. Arounq 
1964, however, he apparently began to take the possibility 
of a showdown with the army a little more seriously, as 
Sukarno's death or disability began to seem like a distinct 
possibility before the PKI could assume power. By the 
time of the coup, he had made a good beginning in his plan 
to subvert the Indonesian military as the preferable way 
for the PKI to acquire some capability for armed struggle, 
without the risks involved in a program to train and equip 
PKI party members. 
PKI Policy Toward Sukarno 
There is one other aspect of the PKI domestic 
policy that should be mentioned before we look at the 
PKI in the context of the Indonesian political scene in 
the months just before the coup. That is its general 
policy toward Sukarno. Aidit's policy toward the Presi-
dent was almost certainly a crucial factor in the PKI's 
involvement in the coup. 
.  � Although there seems to have been no serious dis-
agreement within the party over Aidit's general line on 
"peaceful transition to socialism," there does seem to 
-182-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
have been some dissension over elements of that policy, 
such as the degree to which the PKI should subordinate 
its interests to those of Sukarno. No one, including 
the militants, would have argued in favor of a major 
challenge to Sukarno; it was obvious that his policies, 
both domestically and internationally, for the most part, 
favored PKI interests; the longer he lasted as President, 
the better were the party's chances of assuming power 
without a major struggle. It was generally agreed that 
the best hope of the PKI lay in the careful and loyal 
implementation of his policies. According to �one reli-
able and knowledgable source, 
Aidit maintains his position by virtue of his 
being the party's principal point of contact 
with Sukarno and the fact that the party's 
strategy, at this time at least, is to support 
Sukarno. 
As a way of ingratiating the PKI with Sukarno, the 
Indonesian Communists had adopted a deliberate "tactic 
of flattery" toward the President. They studied his words 
and his doctrines and his aspirations for Indonesia with 
the same diligence that they studied Communist writings. 
The speeches of Aidit and the other PKI leaders were-el-
ways generously adorned with quotations from the "Great 
Leader of the Revolution." In treating Sukarno's formu-
lations with quasi-theological reverence and in making 
him the object of their "cult of personality," the Com-
munists were not only appealing to Sukarno's boundless 
vanity but at the same time reinforcing the image of 
themselves as his true disciples and therefore his most 
deserving political heirs.* 
*Sukarno never stated publicly:that he viewed the P1(1 
as his heir, but this image was gradually built up through 
- the subtle interplay between the President and the Com-
munists. 
-183-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
To be sure, Sukarno was not ungrateful. On 23 
May 1965, at the 45th anniversary celebrations of the 
PKI, he acknowledged the party's unswerving support. He 
participated in the elaborate anniversary ceremony, ex-
changing compliments with the PKI leaders. In his speech 
on the occasion, he said that the PKI was truly his "best 
disciple," that "Indonesia could never emerge as a 
major power without the help of the Communists." 
I embrace the PKI, because it is a revolu-
tionary force. PKI go forward. PKI never 
retreat. PKI grow. PKI be strong. Onward. 
Aidit, in particular, sang the wisdom and glory 
of President Sukarno louder and more unequivocably than 
any other Indonesian political leader. In an interview 
in March 1965, he said: 
The President is my teacher, my leader. 
He is a great patriot. He is fighting 
against imperialism more than the leaders 
of socialist countries. The other parties 
in Indonesia meet him often. But the PKI 
is mentally closer to the President. 
Apparently, some of the more militant leaders of the PKI 
had certain doubts about the wisdom of the party's support-
ing the President to the extent that Aidit was carrying 
the policy. They were reportedly disturbed at the con-
tradiction between party strength and party subservience 
to Sukarno. 
At the time of the coup, Aidit probably had more 
influence on Sukarno than any other person. More than 
ever before, he was pushing Sukarno on matters of vital 
interest to the PKI--like the "fifth force" and the 
-184-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
"troika" idea and the idea of a NASAKOM cabinet.* Of 
the two men, however, Sukarno still had the upper hand. 
For the time being, Aidit was willing to accept that; he 
would go along with whatever Sukarno decided, expecting 
to gain the upper hand that way. 
Even if Sukarno's decisions went against the 
PKI--such as Sukarno's deciding to give only 
four posts to the Communists in a cabinet of 
75 or his refusing to arm 10 million peasants--
Aidit took them in great good humor, never 
*By 1965, the PKI had made a Nasakom cabinet a virtual 
demand of the party; it was the furthest they had ever 
gone in pressing their own objectives on the President. 
In the spring of that year, they began to press other 
demands--one that would have imposed a "troika" policy 
on the chiefs of staff of the armed forces and another, 
the 'fifth force" concept, that would have placed small 
arms in the hands of Communist party members. Aidit's 
"troika" proposal envisaged a policymaking board composed 
of nationalist, religious, and, of course, Communist-repre-
sentatives at the various command levels, from the chief 
of staff to the lowest level of command. When General 
Yani heard of Aidit's "troika" proposal, he went person-
ally to the President to protest the idea. He is reported 
to have told Sukarno; "I am a Nasakomist, and my Nasakom-
ism is the same as yours. There is no need to introduce 
Nasakom into the armed forces. The elements of Nasakom 
are already present with each member of the armed forces. 
The Indonesian armed forces have had the Nasakom idea 
from their beginning." Sukarno and the PKI later made 
fun of the Army's so-called "Nasakom spirit" in little 
songs and verses that became rather well known at the 
time. Everyone knew that the Army was doing what it could 
to resist the idea of Nasakom councils in the Army although 
it made a pretense of supporting Sukarno's idea of Nasakom 
in general.

openly doubting or criticising Sukarno's 
verdict...It must have been highly reassur-
ing for Sukarno to hear from Aidit (in his 
interview in March 1965) that 'many think 
I can influence the President. He is not 
influenced by anybody.' These are exactly 
the words President Sukarno liked to hear. 
T:lere were supposedly three people who knew how to flatter 
Sukarno to get their way. One was Aidit. One was Suban-
drio. And the third was his wife Devi. 
Background to a Coup: September 1964-March 1965 
The process of eliminating all effective opposi-
tion to Sukarno and his policies, which had been the main 
political trend in Indonesia over the years, was greatly 
accelerated during the fall and winter 1964-65. Appar-
ently aware of his declining health and afraid that gradual 
evolution would not result in the fulfillment of his 
grand design for Indonesia, Sukarno seems to have decided. 
sometime around the fall of 1964 to speed up the process 
of neutralizing or liquidating all independent power 
centers obstructing his purposes. Assisting him in this 
task was the PKI, first and foremost, but also the In-
donesian Air Force under Dani, first Deputy Prime Minister 
Subandrio, a host of Communist sympathizers, and an in-
creasing number of opportunists who climbed on the band-
wagon as soon as it got rolling. 
The process of eliminating the opposition proceded 
by stages. After a first move by Sukarno to remove or 
reduce the opposition from a certain quarter, the PKI 
would immediately move in with a vicious anti-America 
campaign designed to link the opposition within Indonesia 
with the "foreign enemy." Sukarno would then accuse the 
opposition of treason to the Indonesian revolution and 
have its leaders removed from Office and their party 
organization and publications banned.

After the rumors about. Sukarno's failing kidney 
became current in the fall of 1964, a movement supported 
from behind the scenes by Third Deputy Prime Minister 
Chaerul Saleh and supported openly by Minister of Trade 
Adam laiik began a major polemic with the PKI. Upon 
Sukarno's return from overseas in the late fall, he 
promptly banned the BPS, or the ''Body to Support Sukarno-
ism' ds the movement was called. This was the start of 
a serles of bannings and purges in 1965, each of which 
strengthened the status and power of the PKI as well as 
of Sukarno. 
On 8 January, after withdrawing from the United 
Nations, Sukarno banned the Murba Party, which had obvi-
ously been involved with the BPS, although Sukarno had 
not attempted to link the two when he first moved against 
the BPS,' On 24 February, following a dramatically 
*Apparently, both Subandrio and the PKI were shocked 
by Sukarno's decision to withdraw Indonesia from the 
United Nations and his boldness in banning the Murba 
Party. According to a reliable source, "Sukarno's im-
pulsive decision (re Indonesia's withdrawal from the 
U.N.) horrified even his friend and straightman Suban-
drio, who, as Foreign Minister, had to carry out the 
order. He delayed the formal letter of withdrawal for 
three weeks before he signed it, hoping that the Bung 
would change his mind. Subandrio told officials at the 
Foreign Ministry that the decision had been 'too whimsi-
cal.' PKI leader Lukman is reported to have told a 
group of leaders of PKI-controlled front groups in Solo 
that the top PKI leadership was 'taken aback' by President 
Sukarno's daring in pulling out of the U.N.; he said that 
it was far more daring than the PKI leadership had expected. 
He said the PKI leadership was also "surprised by Sukar-
no's show of guts in banning the Murba Party." Accord-
ing to Lukman, the complete eradication of the Murba Party 
was the top priority task of the PKI throughout Indonesia. 
He claimed that Sukarno had warned PNI and NU leaders 
that if they did not purge their parties of counter-revolu-
tionary elements he would also ban their parties. Because 
of these "progressive policies of the President, the PKI 
intended to increase its support of Sukarno, according 
to Lukman.

heightened anti-American campaign in Djakarta, Sukarno 
banned the newspapers which had supported the BPS, which 
he characterized as a CIA plot to "kill Sukarnoism and 
Sukarno." (The bans of these newspapers gave the PKI 
'complete control of the informational field.) A few days 
after the banning of these papers, he ordered the retool-
ing of the '45 Generation, another political vehicle of 
Chaerul Saleh which also had widespread connections among 
government and military officials. In April, a predomin-
antly PKI governing board was installed in the new board 
of governors of the '45 Generation organization. Murba 
Party members Saleh and Malik were effectively "re-tooled" 
by losing control of most of their operational governmental 
responsibilities. In September, Sukarno announced that 
the '45 Generation was completely under his control; 
Chaerul Saleh publicly begged for forgiveness. 
Following the banning of the BPS press, a numbdr 
of new Moslem newspapers suddenly appeared in Djakarta 
which, although initially treading gingerly on PKI toes, 
gave promise of eventually replacing the BPS papers in 
attacking the PKI. Sukarno moved promptly to neutralize 
this new threat. In a series of decisions, the Moslem 
organizations were placed under the supervision of Suban-
drio. Thus, the Moslem-PKI issue had been dampened down' 
by September, although there were still isolated incidents 
of violence between the two groups.* Now Sukarno could 
concentrate his attack on the two most important citadels 
of anti-PKI power--the PNI right-wing and the Army lead-
ership. 
*The Moslem issue was by no means settled. Certain 
of the more docile Moslem organizations were behaving them-
selves, but the HMI (the organization of Moslem Univer-
sity students) was still active. As noted above, there 
were several incidents of violence between the Moslems 
and the PKI in 1965. If most of the Moslem organizations 
had been intimidated by Sukarno, some, like the HMI, 
were far from dead.

For several years the President had been working 
to convert the PNI into a virtual mirror of the PKI in 
terms of its espousal of pro-Communist positions and at-
titudes. Although the party had gone along with the 
general pro-Communist orientation of the government, 
there had been considerable foot-dragging on the part 
of a small group of moderates in the leadership, such 
as First Chairman Nardi and Central Java Chairman 
Hadisubeno. Opposing this group of moderates was the 
pro-Communist PNI Secretary General Surachman, who had 
the backing of All Sastroamidjojo and other central board 
members. In March 1965, Sukarno stepped up his campaign 
to "re-tool" the PNI to the point where it was obvious 
that purges would soon occur. Addressing an extraordin-
ary meeting of the PNI in Djakarta on 25 and 26 March, 
he Claimed that "recent events" had cleared the road for 
the socialist stage of the Indonesian revolution;* he 
called unequivocally for the ouster of "false Marhaenists" 
from the PNI, whom he identified implicitly as anti 
*It was Sukarno, rather than the PKI, that was pushing 
the idea that Indonesia was about to enter the sociaList 
stage in the spring of 1965. Apparently, the PKI was not 
happy with the various statements that Sukarno was making 
to this effect--such as the speech that he made to the 
Provisional People's Consultative Congress (MPRS) on 11 
April. Apparently, the party had two main objections. 
According to PKI theory, there should be a "strong, co-
hesive government-acknowledged force to guide Indonesia 
into the socialist stage," In the view of the PKI, only 
the PKI could act as such a force. Yet, in reality, the 
only strong cohesive force in Indonesia in 1965 was the 
army; which the PKI obviously considered the wrong vehicle 
for leading Indonesia into the socialist stage. The 
second objection was that, according to PKI theory, In-
donesia could pass into its socialist stage of develop-
ment only after the national democratic stage had been 
completed. According to the PKI, this was not the case 
in Indonesia in 1965.

Communists. On 4 May, the first "false Marhaenist" was 
ousted; a special meeting of the PNI central board re-
moved Hadisubeno from control of the Central JAva PNI. 
At the PNI anniversary celebration on 26 July, Sukarno 
spoke again of Indonesia's entry into the "socialist 
stage;" this time he implied that the entry might neces-
sarily be a violent one.* Once again, he called for the 
ouster of "false Marhaenists" from the PNI. About ten 
days later, a specially-convened meeting of the PNI 
leadership council officially purged Hardi and his fol-
lowers from the party and gradually thereafter replaced 
them with either pro-Communist or Communist sympathizers.** 
The PNI had-all but collapsed as a political force cap-
able of resisting Sukarno. Only the Army remained. 
For a long While, the Army had been experiencing 
increasing concern over the political situation, especi-
ally the situation in Central Java; where the PKI had( 
its greatest strength_ Some of the generals, alarmed by 
the increasing ascendancy of the PKI in Central Java, 
are known to have felt that the tide was turning against 
the Army in Indonesia as a whole. In January, General 
Yani and a group of his most trusted advisers in the Army 
*In this speech on the occasion of the PNI 38th anni-
versary celebration, Sukarno publicly identified himself 
with the 1926 PKI revolt. He said that the PKI had been 
right to try to seize power violently, even though it had 
not succeeded at the time. He implied that the entry 
into the socialist stage in Indonesia might be violent. 
Apparently, even the PKI was shocked by Sukarno's espousal 
of the violent entry into socialism. The party had been 
espousing the peaceful transition to socialism. Actu-
ally, as noted before, the PKI had not been pushing the 
idea of Indonesia's entry into socialism, certainly not 
the way Sukarno was.

in 1965, the "false Marhaenists" who were purged from

opposition to President Suharto today.

began to meet together informally to discuss the deteriorat-
ing political situation and what the Army should do about 
it. The group, known as the "brain-trust," included four 
other generals, besides Yani: Gen. Suprapto, Gen. Harjono, 
Gen. Parman, and Gen. Sukendro. Contrary to widespread 
belief, Gen. Sutojo and Gen. Pandjaitan, who were also 
victims of the Indonesian coup along with Yani, Suprapto, 
Harjono, and Parman, were not members of the "brsin-trust." 
They were close friends of�Yini and were generally con-
sidered to be among "Yani's boys" in the Army, but they 
were not part of the group that began to meet together 
regularly, in secret, in January to discuss political mat-
ters pertaining to the Army.* 
Around the same time that Gen. Yani and a group 
of his most trusted advisers in the Army began to meet 
together for secret discussions of the political situa-
tion, the Army was presented with a proposal from the PKI 
which represented the most serious challenge it had' yet 
*This group of five generals which began to meet to-
gether regularly in January 1965 to discuss political 
problems affecting the Army was, almost certainly, the 
group that the PKI was warning Sukarno about. Aidit re-
ferred to the group as the "Generals' Council." There 
was another organization in the army that was also known 
as the Generals' Council, which was concerned solely with 
the matter of promotions and appointments. Gen. Yani and 
the Army tried to divert attention away from the group 
of generals who were meeting together informally by bring-
ing up the subject of this other organization that was 
also called the Generals' Council. It obviously had 
nothing to do with the group of generals, known within 
the army as Yani's "braintrust," who were meeting to dis-
cuss political matters. 
All of the generals who were included in the "brain-
trust" or "Generals' Council", as Aidit referred to it, 
were victims of the 30 September Movement, except for Gen. 
Sukendro, who was in Communist China on the day of the 
coup.

faced. In late January, it was revealed that Aidit had 
requested Sukarno to arm peasants and workers as a special 
defense force or "people's militiav--the so-called "fifth 
force."* The PKI and Communist China were to keep up the 
pressure on Sukarno on the matter of the "fifth force" 
all during the spring and summer of 1965; Sukarno himself 
was to remain uncommitted on this issue. However, in 
April, he took a definite step in the direction of under-
mining the Army as an independent political force. At 
a special meeting of the military commanders that month, 
he ordered the Army to get into step with the revolution 
and revise its defense thinking in keeping with his own 
thinking of Nekolim (Sukarno's word for "imperialist" 
nations, particularly the U.S. and U.K.), rather than 
Communist China, as the main enemy of Indonesia. 
Many of the Army's senior officers are known to 
have been deeply concerned about these .new orders, whl�ch 
they believed opened the way for the disintegration of 
the Army's strong anti-Communist posture. They were very 
much aware of the fact that Air Force Commander Dani had 
sold out to Sukarno and the PKI and was actively assist-
ing in the campaign against the Army. The Army held a 
series of conferences to "turn the wheel toward the left" 
as Sukarno demanded, but behind the scenes Yani and a fey 
other senior generals in the Army were meeting in secret 
to discuss ways of resisting Sukarno's moves to destroy 
the Army as a political force opposed to the radical move-
ment to the left. It is clear that the Army was on the 
defensive and was reacting to initiatives by Sukarno and 
the PKI. There is no evidence that the Army was planning 
anything more than countermeasures to resist Sukarno and 
the PKI's bold new moves to crush it. 
*Sukarno was actually the first to use the term "fifth 
force." Aidit had spoken of "arming workers and peasants" 
in presenting the idea in the first place. After Sukarno 
originated the name "fifth force," everyone called it 
that. 
-192-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In early May, Sukarno ordered the newly created 
National Defense Institute placed under civilian control 
and the introduction of a number of pro-Communist courses 
in the curriculum. A few days later, he made another 
proposal that would all but have destroyed the /Willy as 
a political as well as an anti-Communist force. He pro-
posed that Nasakom advisory councils (in which the PKI 
would have been represented along with the other parties) 
should be formed to advise military commanders at all 
levels, from the top echelon down to the military districts. 
The PKI obviously had in mind a political commissar system 
similar to that of Communist China. Sukarno himself cited 
the example of Communist China in discussing the idea for 
Nasakom advisory councils in the Army. Probably even more 
than the "fifth force," the political commissar system 
as proposed by the PKI would have destroyed the Army as 
an independent power in Indonesia. The generals were 
determinedly against the idea. Although they were aforced 
to mouth support for it, they had successfully resisted 
implementation of any such political commissar system in 
the Army up to the time of the coup. 
As of early August 1965, then, Sukarno's balance 
sheet showed a mixed picture. On the one hand, he had 
crushed the Saleh forces and removed the anti-Communtpt 
strength in the PNI, and he had neutralized the Moslems, 
making it possible to crush them at a later date. But 
the Army had held. He may well have decided that unless 
there was a change in the Army .leadership the Army was 
not likely to give in on the matter of the "fifth force" 
and the even more controversial matter of introducing 
Nasakom councils in the command structure of the Army. 
In other words, he may have begun to think of purging 
the Army leadership, as he had purged the PNI leadership. 
The Gilchrist Letter 
In late May 1965, President Sukarno had a dramatic 
confrontation with Army Commander Yani over two issues; 
one of them, the Generals' Council and the other, the 
Gilchrist Letter. Since the story of the Gilchrist Letter 
-193-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
is of interest in connection with the coup, it may be well 
to discuss it before taking up in detail the Generals' 
Council. 
Sukarno is reported to have called in Gen. Yani 
and the commanders of the other armed services, as well 
as Defense Minister Nasution, to discuss the Gilchrist 
Letter the very same day that Subandrio first showed the 
letter to the President. That was the 26th of May 1965. 
According to Subandrio, the letter had been mailed to 
him at his home address in an envelope bearing a Djakarta 
postmark but no return address. A covering letter, which 
was unsigned, explained that the letter had been found 
in the home of Billy Palmer, an American businessman, 
whose house had been raided by the Pia. (The raid on 
Palmer's home had been well publicized in the Indonesian 
press.) In other words, the covering letter implied 
that the Gilchrist Letter had been furnished to Subandrio 
by the PKI. 
The Gilchrist Letter purported to be a letter written 
by Sir Andrew Gilchrist, the British Ambassador to Indon-
esia, in March 1965. According to Subandrio, it was a 
letter that Ambatsador Gilchrist sent to the British Foreign 
Office, reporting on a discussion with the U.S Ambassador 
to Indonesia concerning U.S. and British plans for sub-
version and overthrow of the Indonesian government in 
collusion with Indonesian military leaders. In the letter, 
Gilchrist was alleged to have referred to "our local Army 
friends." 
According to his testimony in court, Subandrio 
ordered the BPI, Indonesia's intelligence organization 
which he headed, to check out the authenticity of the 
document. He was told that both the handwriting and the 
form of the letter were the same as that of other docu-
ments taken from the British Embassy at the time of the 
burning of the Embassy about eight months earlier. 
Subandrio claimed that he was convinced by this report 
of the authenticity of the document and, he gave the 
letter to the President on 26 May 1965. 
-194-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Sukarno appeared to be genuinely alarmed by the 
Gilchrist Letter. His haste in calling in the commanders 
of the armed services and the Minister of Defense to dis-
cuss the document would seem to indicate that he was in-
clined to accept the letter as authentic; either that, 
or he was deliberately creating that impression. At the 
meeting with Sukarno on 26 May, Army Commander Yani is 
reported to have denied the allegations made in the 
letter. He told Sukarno that Generals Parman and Sukendro 
were the only Army generals who maintained close liaison 
with the British and Americans and only because this was 
their assignment. Either Sukarno pretended not to be, 
or he was not, convinced by Yani's explanation. One or 
two days later, he raised the subject of the Gilchrist 
Letter again at a meeting of KODAM commanders. Several 
weeks later, he gave the go-ahead to Subandrio to announce 
the existence of the document as proof of U.S. and British 
plotting against Indonesia. The circumstances of the 
announcement were .planned to attract world-wide att6-
tion. Apparently, Subandrio planned to announce the dis-
covery of the Gilchrist Letter at the Afro-Asian Confer-
ence in Algiers. When the conference was postponed at 
the last minute, he called a press conference in Cairo, 
just prior to returning home to Indonesia, to make the 
dramatic announcement. The fact that the press confer-
ence was held in Cairo attracted international attention, 
much more so than if Subandrio had made the announcement 
in Indonesia. 
No doubt, at that point in time, Sukarno was pre-
disposed to think the worst of both the U.S. and the 
British. He may really have believed that Britain and 
the United States were in collusion with the Indonesian 
military in plotting his overthrow. Ever since the PRRI-
Permesta rebellion in the outer islands in 1956-61, in 
which the U.S. and Britain had been involved, he had been 
deeply suspicious of the U.S.; and of the C.I.A., in par-
ticular. By the summer of 1965, when the West Irian is-
sue had been settled in his favor, Sukarno had transferred 
the full fury of his anti-Dutch complex to the U.S. and 
Britain. In the situation of growing tension between 
him and the Army, he might easily have been persuaded 
of the danger of a coup by a Generals' Council, probably 
in foreign pay.

Regardless of what Sukarno really thought--or knew--
about the Gilchrist Letter, it is now widely accepted as 
fact that the Gilchrist Letter was a forgery--and a bad 
one, at that. Ambassador Gilchrist and the British govern-
ment have both denied knowing anything about such a letter. 
British and U.S. officials were never shown a copy of the 
letter that Subandrio said was the Gilchrist Letter, but 
Indonesian Army officers examined it carefully and con-
cluded, without any doubt, that it was forged. The hand-
writing in the margin, supposed to be that of the Ambas-
sador, did not match his handwriting; nor was it his style 
of writing. Probably the most convincing evidence that 
the letter was a forgery is the absurdity that Ambassador 
Gilchrist would discuss such a matter as U.S. and British 
plans to overthrow the Indonesian Government in an uncoded 
letter to the Foreign Office. Equally absurd is the idea 
that the letter would ever find its way into Billy Palmer's 
house, if it were authentic. (He was an obvious target 
for the PKI and the BPI, because of his way of life and 
temperament, to play the role of the "enemy agent.") More-
over, it is highly unlikely that the British would have 
been involved in anything as out of context with their 
policy at the time as a_plan to overthrow the Indonesian 
Government; at the time the U.K. was withdrawing from 
Southeast Asia and reducing drastically its role and com-
mitments in the area. There is still another point--namely, 
that it was also totally out of character for the Indonesian 
Army to have been plotting the overthrow of Sukarno at 
that point in time. The Army was much too divided and 
on the defensive to have been planning such a move. 
The question immediately arises: who forged the 
Gilchrist Letter? Three prime suspects immediately come 
to mind: Subandrio, Aidit, and the Chinese. All three 
would have had the same motive in wanting to convince 
Sukarno that the generals were plotting against him. 
The motive, of course, would have been to get Sukarno 
to take firm action against the generals, who represented 
the main threat to both Subandrio and the PKI in the 
struggle for power after Sukarno. The Chinese had a vested 
interest in promoting the interests, first of all, of the 
PKI and, secondly, of Subandrio, over the military in 
Indonesia. 
-196-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Sukarno must also be considered among the suspects 
who had both the motive and the capability for forging 
such a document. (Presumably, Sukarno would have used 
Subandrio and the BPI to forge any document that he wanted 
forged.) If Sukarno had any thought of moving against 
the Army, as he had moved against the BPS and the Murba 
Party and the PNI, he would have had a definite motive 
in wanting to establish a case against the Army; the Gil-
christ Letter could always be used as evidence of Army 
plotting against Sukarno and Army intrigue with foreign 
enemies of the Indonesian state. 
In the three years since the coup, no evidence 
has come to light as to who forged the letter. In the 
interrogations after the coup, no attempt was ever made 
--as far as we know--to question people on this particular 
point. Why the Army did not pursue the matter is not 
clear. Unless it was not sure that it had convincihg 
proof that the document was a forgery, it seems that the 
only reason it would have had for not wanting to pursue 
the matter further would be the possibility of involving 
Sukarno. Certainly, the Army was interested above all 
else in establishing that there was no truth to the reports 
that it was plotting the overthrow of Sukarno in collusion 
with the U.S. and the U.K. To this end, it had every 
reason for wanting to discredit the Gilchrist Letter, as 
evidence to the contrary. Under the circumstances, it 
is surprising that more of an effort was not made to im-
plicate Aidit, or Subandrio, or the Chinese in the forgery, 
when a good circumstantial case could have been made 
against all three.* At the time (i.e. in 1966), the Army 
*It is interesting that the Army never tried to make 
a strong case for the Chinese having forged the Gilchrist 
Letter, though it tried in every other way to implicate 
the Chinese in the coup. If it were proved that the 
Chinese forged the letter, they would have to be judged 
to have played a significant role in bringing about the 
events that led to the coup, whether or not they were 
directly involved in the planning of the coup.

was concentrating on PKI involvement in the coup. For 
very good reasons, it was being very circumspect on the 
matter of Sukarno's involvement in the coup. When it did 
.discuss the subject, it was usually in reference to Sukar-
no's actions on the day of the coup and his actions after-
wards in support of the coup. Despite evidence that 
Sukarno must have had foreknowledge of the coup and must 
have approved of the coup plans, the Army never went so 
far as to suggest that Sukarno set the stage for the move 
against the generals by fabricating evidence against the 
Army. 
If Sukarno was responsible for the Gilchrist Letter, 
any or all three of the other suspects--Subandrio, Aidit, 
or the Chinese--could have been involved along with him. 
They may have suggested the idea to him and then become 
involved in a plot with him in forging the Gilchrist 
Letter, or they may have been used by Sukarno in a scbeme 
of his own making. 
The evidence as to who forged the Gilchrist Letter 
is simply not conclusive. It does not support narrowing 
the alternatives further. However, if we had to say which 
of the alternatives seems most likely, we would guess .4 
Subandrio. At least the weight of the evidence points 
to Subandrio and the BPI as having been responsible for 
the actual forging of the document. Whether the BPI had 
Sukarno's approval for the operation of whether Subandrio 
was carrying out what was Sukarno's idea to begin with 
is unclear. We suspect that the operation had Sukarno's 
approval. 
The Generals' Council 
The first reports concerning a Generals' Council 
were received about the same time in May that Subandrio 
claims to have received the Gilchrist letter in the mail 
at his home. In this instance, Subandrio first received 
the report�that a Generals' Council existed in the Army 
.(1 that it was going to stage a coup because of the 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
generals' dissatisfaction with Sukarno's policies--from 
the chief of staff of the BPI.* Apparently, the BPI had 
*It should be made clear that the reports about a 
Generals' Council specifically claimed that the generals 
were planning a coup. As already explained, the reports 
were true insofar as they referred to a "Generals' Coun-
cil" that was meeting in secret to discuss political 
matters. The reports obviously referred to the group 
of five generals .(Yani, Suprapto, Harjono, Parman, and 
Sukendro) who began to meet together informally in Janu-
ary to discuss the Army's response to Sukarno's new 
initiatives to crush it. The reports were wrong, how-
ever, in suggesting that the generals were planning a 
coup against Sukarno. At least, there is nothing that 
makes us think that the Generals had any such plan; the 
evidence is to the contrary. 
Apparently, the first reports about a Generals' Coun-
cil were vague as to the timing of the coup that the gen-
erals were alleged to be planning. In late August and 
September, however, the date 5 October began to be men-
tioned. In the last weeks before the coup, this date was 
mentioned more and more often in connection with the al-
leged plans for a generals' coup. Apparently, there was 
no more justification to the reports that the generals 
were planning a coup on 5 October than the fact that it 
was Armed Forces Day, which gave the Army an obvious ex-
cuse for bringing large numbers of troops to Djakarta for 
the Armed Forces Day Parade. If the Army had been plan-
ning a coup on 5 October, only 5 days later than the coup 
that actually materialized, the preparations would have 
to have been well advanced by 1 October, and it seems 
that it would have been impossible to keep the fact of 
such preparations a secret so long. Absolutely no evid-
ence has ever come to light, however, of there having been 
any such preparations. Apparently, Sukarno and the PKI 
were concerned that the Army might be planning a coup on 
5 October, however. That seems to have been a definite 
factor in Aidit's decision to stage the coup no later

received information to this effect from three or four 
different sources, most of whom seem to have had some 
affiliation with the PKI. According to Subandrio, neither 
he nor his chief of staff made an effort to check the 
validity of the information. 
Subandrio himself seems to have been rather dubious 
about these reports, at least at first. During his trial, 
the following exchange took place: 
Question: What was your logical conclu-
sion, after hearing of the existence of 
the Council of Generals? 
Subandrio: I considered it only as a 
'whispering campaign.' Also, it re-
garded a domestic matter, and the BPI 
was not concerned with domestic matters. 
Question: Did Aidit ever ask you about 
the Council of Generals?

than 30 September. Of course, there is the possibility 
that the coup leaders made up the story that the generals 
were going to stage a coup on 5 October as a pretext for 
urging haste on Untung and the other military leaders, 
who were concerned about certain military details of the 
coup plot and were offering resistance to Sjam's pres-
sure for immediate action.

Subandrio: Yes, at the meeting about 
economic affairs in June 1965, and I 
replied that he must be careful about 
'whispering campaigns.' Also Yani, 
Sukarno, and Aidit discussed the 
Council of Generals; on this occasion, 
Aidit only laughed about it. 
Question: Did you ever give the BPI 
any instruction about the Council of 
Generals? 
Subandrio: No, sir. 
Question: When the President was ill, 
after 4th August, you telephoned General 
Djuhartono and you told him 'Don't join 
the whispering campaign about the replace-
ment of the President, don't join the 
Council of Generals'. 
Subandrio: Yes, sir. I did so, but 
that was only a casual joke between 
Djuhartono and me, as usual. 
L. 
Subandrio was quite clear on the point that the BPI never 
had any proof of the existence of the Generals' Council. 
The BPI did not forward its reports concerning a 
Generals' Council to the Defense and Security Staff or 
to the chiefs of any of the armed forces. Presumably, 
Subandrio briefed Sukarno, although we have no informa-
tion as to exactly when and from whom Sukarno first heard 
about the Generals' Council.* It is clear, however, that 
� 
*Since the coup, Nasution has claimed that General 
Pranoto told Sukarno about the existence of a Generals' 
Council. It is not clear whether Nasution meant that

about a Generals' Council or whether he was one of the

he had already been informed about the reports when Aidit 
raised the subject of the Generals' Council with him some-
time around mid-May. Apparently, Aidit had been briefed 
by the chief of staff of the BPI, as Subandrio had. At 
*least, he claimed that he had obtained his information 
from Police Brig. General Sutarto, chief of staff of the 
BPI, when he mentioned the reports about the Generals' 
Council to a meeting of the Politburo in May. Aidit told 
the Politburo that the Gilchrist letter tended to confirm 
the reports about the Council of Generals. 
Aidit is reported to have raised the subject of 
the Generals' Council with the President sometime in 
mid-May when he and Njoto were with Sukarno at the Palace. 
The exact occasion is not known, but it must have been 
sometime before 26 May, when Sukarno called in the military

persons who discussed the subject with Sukarno. It would 
be interesting to know just what Pranoto told the Presi-
dent. He was not a member of Gen. Yani's "brain trust" 
which was meeting in secret to plan the Army's response 
to Sukarno's newest initiatives to destroy it as a poli-
tical force; therefore, he would not have known the de-
tails of the Army's thinking. He could well have learned 
of the secret meetings of Yani and the other generals, 
however, and it is quite believable that he would have 
told Sukarno. His appointment by Sukarno as caretaker 
of the army after the coup may have stemmed from his 
service to Sukarno in telling him of the meetings of the 
Generals' Council.

commanders to confront them with the reports about a 
Generals' Council and the discovery of the Gilchrist 
letter.* 
At the meeting on 26 May, General Yani is reported 
to have replied to Sukarno's direct questioning on the 
matter of the Generals' Council. He told the President 
that there was an organization within the Army known as 
the Generals' Council but that it was solely concerned 
with the matter of promotions and appointments. Yani 
was referring to the council that had been established 
in 1956 for the purpose of advising the army commander 
t. 
*In a statement given under oath on 16 September 1966 
Sukarno stated that it was not until the beginning of 
September 1965 that he learned about the existence of the 
Council of Generals. "I asked Army Commander Yani about 
this council of generals after hearing of it at the 
beginning of September." As General Nasution has said, 
the President's oath was obviously "spurious." There is 
the report of Aidit's having raised the subject of the 
Generals' Council with Sukarno sometime soon after he 
(Aidit) had received a report on the subject from Police 
Brig. General Sutarto, the chief of the staff of the BPI, 
in early May. Sukarno obviously knew what Aidit was 
referring to; presumably, Subandrio had already informed 
the President about the reports concerning a Generals' 
Council. In any case, Sukarno certainly knew about the 
reports by 26 May 1965, when he called in the military 
commanders and questioned them about both the Generals' 
Council and the Gilchrist Letter. This meeting has been 
described by several sources--including Subandrio, who 
was there. Sukarno's statement, under oath, that it was 
not until the beginning of September that he learned 
about the Generals' Council, is simply not true.

on promotions and assignments.* Yani was obviously evad-
ing the issue by bringing up the subject of the promotions 
and review board. Sukarno was obviously referring to a 
completely different group; namely, the group of generals, 
known within the army as Yani's "brain trust," who had 
been meeting together regularly in secret since January 
to discuss political matters.** 
*There was an organization in the Army that was called 
_the Generals' Council that was responsible for reviewing 
promotions and assignments in the Army. Originally called 
the Gatot Commission, it had become known as the Generals' 
Council by the time its membership was revised in 1962. 
Originally composed of six officers, it had grown to some 
40 members in 1965, only 25 of whom were active at a L 
time. At the time of the coup, the chairman and vice 
chairman of the council were Gen. Sudirman and Gen. Suharto, 
respectively. This council had absolutely nothing to do 
with the other group within the Army that was referred 
to by the PKI as the "Generals' Council", namely the group 
of Yani and four of his most senior advisers in the Army 
who were meeting together to discuss political matters. 
None of the generals killed in the coup were on the pro-
motions and review board known as the Generals' Council. 
All of the generals in the other group were victims of 
the coup except for Gen. Sukendro. 
**In hindsight, it seems that Yani did not handle things 
as well as he might have. He did little to reassure 
Sukarno that the Army had absolutely no thought of Staging 
a coup against him. He was obviously evasive on the mat-
ter of the Generals' Council, which probably only increased 
Sukarno's suspicions. It might have been better for him 
to admit the existence of the "Generals' Council" and 
simply explain that a group of generals had been meeting 
together with him to discuss certain problems of concern 
to the Army but that they certainly had never discussed 
anything pertaining to a coup. Yani was inclined to laugh 
off Sukarno's warnings. As we shall see, on a later oc-
casion, Sukarno was to point his finger directly at Yani 
(footnote continued on page 205)

As noted earlier, it appears that Sukarno and 
Aidit reacted with considerably greater alarm to the 
reports about a Generals' Council than did Subandrio. 
At least, this is the impression that one gets from 
Subandrio's testimony at his trial, and there are one or 
two other facts that tend to support this impression. 
Although Subandrio obviously knew about the planning for 
the coup that was started in late August and continued 
all through the month of September, he does not seem to 
have been directly involved in any of the planning and 
was not even in Djakarta to participate in the events

(footnote continued from page 204) 
and accuse him in public of "blocking the Revolutionf 
of blocking me." He warned Yani that "the people will 
crlish you." Yani is reported to have laughed. Appar-
ently, he made no effort after this and other similar 
incidents to reassure Sukarno that he was not against 
the President. Just before the coup, Sukarno is re-
ported to have summoned Nasution and Yani to ask them 
once again about the reports about a "Generals' Council." 
He told Yani and Nasution that he had new information 
that several high-ranking generals were cooperating in 
an attempt to overthrow the government. Once again, Yani 
avoided a direct answer on the question of the "Generals' 
Council." He is reported to have countered with the 
charge that it was the PKI, not the Army, that seemed to 
be preparing for a coup. Apparently, he promised Sukarno 
that he would check into the matter and give him a report 
within several days. At the time of the coup, however, 
he had not reported back to the President. 
-235-

of the coup on 1 October.* He certainly was not essential 
to the coup plans. It may be that he never was convinced 
about the Generals' Council and its supposed planning for 
Sukarno's overthrow and that he was, therefore, not as 
'enthusiastic about the idea of the coup or perhaps not 
as confident of its success as Aidit and presumably Sukar-
no.** 
As for Aidit's reaction to the reports about a 
Generals' Council in May and June 1965, it is clear that 
he did not disparage the reports, as Subandrio may have 
*As has been noted before. Subandrio seems to have 
deliberately planned to be away from Djakarta at the time 
of the coup. He left town on the 29th, the same day that 
he is reported to have met with Aidit in the morning. 
On the morning of 29 September, Aidit would have known 
that the coup would take place the following night (he 
had made the final decision on D-Day the day before), 
so he could have told Subandrio then. Under the circum-
stances, it would be surprising if Subandrio had not 
known when he left town that the coup would be staged 
the next night. 
**Subandrio is by nature a cautious man, certainly 
much more so than Sukarno. He may well have had some 
premonition that the coup might fail. Aside from its 
chances for success, he may also have had some reason to 
be less than enthusiastic about the whole idea of the 
coup to begin with. He didn't have the backing of an 
organized political force the way Sukarno had the PNI, 
Aidit had the PKI, and Nasution and Yani had the Army. 
His power derived solely from Sukarno. His personal posi-
tion was better served by a continuation of the existing 
domestic power balance than by any attempt to upset the 
balance between the PKI and the Army, as the coup would 
have done, in favor of the PKI. Subandrio may well have 
viewed Aidit as his chief rival for influence with Sukar-
no and his chief contender for power after Sukarno. Thus. 
he may not have been altogether happy about the idea of 
removing the top leadership of the Army, which represented 
the main balancing force to the PKI.

done. Whether he believed them or not, he would have had 
his own reasons for wanting others, particularly Sukarno, 
to believe them. His actions were certainly calculated 
to give the reports maximum exposure. One of the first 
things he seems to have done was to make sure that Sukarno 
had heard about the Generals' Council. Soon thereafter, 
he reported the information that he had obtained from the 
BPI to the PKI Politburo. Reports about the Generals' 
Council filtered down through the PKI organization all 
during the summer. There is no doubt that the PKI as an 
organization played a major role in spreading the rumor 
about a Generals' Council and its alleged planning for 
a coup, whether or not it was responsible for starting 
the rumor. 
There is still the question of whether or not 
Aidit believed the reports about the Generals' Council 
--and the related question of whether or not he and the 
PKI were responsible, in any way, for starting the Irumor. 
Apparently the original reports that the BPI received in 
early May 1965 about a Generals Council came from per-
sons associated with the PKI. It is not clear whether 
(1) these reports were plants of a PKI covert operation 
or (2) whether the PKI was used by someone else who wanted 
to spread the rumor that the Generals' Council was plot-
ting the overthrow of Sukarno, or (3) whether the reports 
were not a deliberate plant by anyone at all but origin-
ated with several different sources who may have been 
PKI party members or Communist sympathizers but who were 
acting on their own in reporting certain information that 
they had heard, namely, that a group of generals was meet-
ing in secret to discuss plans to overthrow 
Sukarno. There is no evidence that the PKI was guilty 
of a deliberate lie in starting the rumor that the Generals' 
Council was plotting the overthrow of Sukarno; .but, on the 
other hand, there is nothing that rules this out as a 
possibility. The PKI party members and the military of-
ficers involved in the coup, who were interrogated after 
the coup, all seem to have believed the reports about the 
Generals' Council and its alleged planning for a coup; 
there is no suggestion in any of their testimony that the 
PKI simply made up the story of the Generals' Council. 
The military officers received their information on the 
-207-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Generals' Council from Sjam and other members of the PKI 
Special Bureau; they accepted his word on this, as on all 
other matters. In the case of the PKI, the word came 
down from the top; the reports about the Generals Council 
had the authorization of the Politburo, of Aidit himself, 
who claimed that he had received the information from the 
BPI. Politburo members like Sudisman and Sakirman and 
Niono, who were interrogated after the coup, seem to have 
accepted Aidit's word completely; they do not seem to 
have suspected him--even in hindsight--of having tricked 
them into believing something that he knew to be untrue. 
The one person who might have known if Aidit had not really 
believed the reports about the Generals' Council�and 
would almost certainly have known if the story about the 
Generals' Council had been a PKI covert operation to begin 
with--was Sjam. As far as we know, he has never given 
any indication that either was the case. 
In general, we are inclined to think that Aidit 
probably was not responsible for starting the rumor about 
the Generals'-tZuncil--though we would not altogether 
rule out the possibility that he was. As to whether he 
believed the reports, we are inclined to think that he 
probably did. Although Aidit may well have exaggerated 
his own fears of a Generals' coup, especially to Sukarno, 
whom he would certainly have wanted to convince of the 
threat from the Army, it seems that in the end he too 
was convinced by the reports of military planning for the 
coup. One reason for thinking that he was not as con-
vinced, at first, as he was later to become, is the 
fact that he left Indonesia in early July for an extended 
trip abroad. He almost certainly would not have gone 
if he had feared an imminent coup. On the other hand, 
he was apparently concerned enough to ask Sjam before he 
left Indonesia to develop some kind of a plan of opera-
tions against the Generals' Council, which he had decided 
was the "focus of anti-PKI activities in the army." The 
fact that Aidit ordered him to develop such a plan in 
May 1965, within a matter of two or three weeks of learn-
ing of the Generals' Council, was revealed by Sjam himself, 
under interrogation by the Army.

The PKI's 45th Anniversary 
One of the major political events in Indonesia 
in 1965 took place in May, soon after Sukarno, Subandrio, 
and Aidit first heard the reports about a Generals' Coun-
cil and just a few days before Sukarno summoned the mili-
tary commanders to the Palace to confront them with the 
reports about the Council and the discovery of the Gil-
christ Letter. The event was the 45th anniversary of 
the PKI which was celebrated with impressive ceremony 
over a period of four days, from 23-26 May.* The import-
ance of the event as far as the coup is concerned is 
simply what it reveals about Sukarno's relationship with 
the PKI at the time. At the mass rally on 23 May, Presi-
dent Sukarno extolled the PKI, and Aidit personally, in 
the most effusive terms that he had ever used in public 
in praise of any political party in Indonesia: 
Do you know what Dipa Nusantara (Aidit's

capital. The Air Force dropped leaflets over Djakarta 
extolling the PKI anniversary. Sukarno and Aidit were 
the principal speakers at the rally. On 26 May, the PKI

head of the high-level Chinese delegation which also in-
cluded Liu Ning-yi, was the principal speaker.

million persons, with 3 million youths. 
Why has the PKI become this kind of 
party? It is because the PKI has consist-
ently been a progressive revolutionary 
party. There is no doubt, brothers, 
that the Indonesian revolution cannot be 
completed if all progressive revolution-
ary forces are not unified into one force. 
I embrace the PKI. 
At the PKI Congress, I said: 'PKI go on-
ward!' Now I say: PKI, go onward, on-
ward, onward; never retreat! Brothers, 
this is my message at this 45th anniver-
sary rally of the PKI. I wish the PKI 
long life. Onward, onward, onward. 
Should my kinsmen and my brothers (the 
PKI) ever die, it would be like my own 
death. 
Aidit repaid Sukarno's compliment three days later, in 
his speech at the pm reception of 26 May: 
At the mass rally on 23 May Bung Karno 
gave a high evaluation of the work and 
role of the PKI. We express our profound-
est thanks for this evaluation. We are 
determined to develop the PKI in conformity 
with Bung Karno's speech which, among 
other things, said that the PKI was an 
indispensable element in the effort to com-
plete the revolution and expressed the 
hope that the PKI will continue to be 
strong and to flourish. 
The PKI's 45th anniversary celebration epitomized 
Sukarno's almost complete identification with Aidit, and 
vice versa. Sukarno had not only lent his own prestige 
to the affair but he had made available the considerable 
resources of the Indonesian government in providing the 
facilities at the large Senajan Stadium in Djakarta and 
free government transportation for the large number of 
participants; moreover, he had allowed the erection of

large PKI displays throughout the city. He must also 
have been responsible for the Air Force planes that 
participated in the affair by dropping leaflets over the 
city of Djakarta in honor of the PKI anniversary. The 
participation of Sukarno and the PKI and the Air Force 
together in a major political event honoring the PKI was 
particularly interesting, because four months later, they 
would be involved. together in another event of far greater 
significance. 
Aidit's Last Trip Abroad 
About a month after the triumph of the PKI 45th 
anniversary celebration, Aidit left Indonesia on an ex-
tended visit to Moscow and Peking. He was out of the 
country for six of the twelve weeks immediately preced-
ing the Indonesian coup. As it was, his trip was cut 
short by an urgent summons from Sukarno to return home. 
Aidit left Djakarta on 26 June as a member of the ln-
donesan delegation, which also included Subandrio, to 
the Afro-Asian conference that was sCheduled to be held 
in Algiers beginning on 29 June.* It will be remembered 
that Subandrio was in Cairo, on his way home from the-
stillborn Algiers Conference, when he made the announce-
ment about the Gilchrist letter. Aidit went on to Moscow 
from Cairo, arriving there on 7 July. 
Apparently, Aidit's visit to Moscow was arranged 
only shortly before he left Indonesia. The new Soviet 
ambassador to Djakarta, M.D. Sytenko, paid a visit to 
Aidit on 23 June, at which time he is reported to have

extended the invitation to Aidit to head a PKI delegation 
to the Soviet Union. Aidit seems to have accepted the 
invitation on the spot. There is some indication that 
he had been seeking an opportunity to hold talks with 
the CPSU leaders. The Soviet delegation to the PKI an-
niversary celebrations in late May may have reported on 
PKI receptivity to a Soviet initiative. On 16 June Aidit 
indicated quite clearly that he would accept an invitation 
to visit Moscow when he received a Pravda journalist in 
his office and told him that the PKI was considering send-
ing a delegation to the Soviet Union on a long-standing 
Soviet invitation.* 
The day after it was announced_(on the 23rd) that 
a PKI delegation, headed by Aidit, would be going to 
Moscow for talks with the Soviet leaders--which came as 
a surprise to a great many people--Aidit met with the 
Chinese charge in Djakarta. Apparently, the Chineselhad 
been taken by surprise by the news of the forthcoming 
CPSU-PKI talks. They would, of course, have been very 
much opposed to the idea. If Aidit had decided to have 
talks with the CPSU leaders against their wishes, they

but not at the time of the Moscow Conference. Thus, no

the Soviet invitation on 23 June after the Soviets had 
received a clear indication from Aidit, presumably in 
May when the Soviet delegation was in Djakarta for the 
PKI anniversary celebrations, that he was ready to ac-
cept an invitation to visit Moscow then. Aidit was 
referring to the original Soviet invitation in December 
.1964 when he said that he was accepting a "long-standing 
_Soviet invitation." 
-212-

would certainly have wanted him to stop over in Peking 
for talks with them after his consultations in Moscow. 
The Chinese must have decided to invite Aidit to visit 
China as soon as they learned that he would be going to 
the Soviet Union; presumably, that was the purpose of 
his meeting with the Chinese charge on 24 June. Thus, 
his trip to Communist China, like his trip to the Soviet 
Union, was arranged only a day or so before he left In-
donesia to attend the ill-fated Afro-Asian Conference. 
In Moscow 
Little is known about Aidit's talks with the CPSU 
leaders in Moscow and virtually nothing about his talks 
in China. He is reported to have carried a letter to 
Kosygin from President Sukarno urging the Soviet ptemier 
not to persist in his efforts to have the Soviet Union 
attend the Afro-Asian conference, now re-scheduled for 
November. Apparently Aidit indicated his full support of 
Sukarno's position against Soviet participation in the 
conference to Kosygin personally. Later, he is reported 
to have raised the subject again with Suslov, with whom 
he had an acrimonious exchange on 28 July. 
After the coup, PKI party members were briefed on 
the results of Aidit's visit to Moscow, including his 
meeting with Suslov. According to the PKI briefing, 
Suslov requested an immediate appointment with Aidit as 
soon as he arrived in Moscow on 7 July, but Aidit refused. 
After he had made several tours of Moscow and Uzbekistan 
and a side-trip to Bucharest to attend the Ninth Congress 
of the Rumanian party on 21 July, Aidit finally agreed 
to meet with Suslov on 28 July. Although the PKI probably 
provided a somewhat slanted version of their meeting, it 
is clear from it and other sources that the meeting was 
far from satisfactory. Aidit is reported to have accused 
the Soviets of splitting the international Communist move-
ment in seeking a conflict with Albania (and, by implica-
tion, China); he called on the Soviets to practice self-
criticism in this matter. Suslov blamed Albania for the 
split and accused the PKI of meddling in internal Soviet 
-213-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
problems. Aidit countered by accusing the Soviets of 
theddling in PKI affairs, in making secret contact with 
Murba party leaders who were working to destroy the PKI, 
.and also of meddling in the internal affairs of the Jap-
anese Communist Party (he asked Suslov why the Soviets 
had supported Shiga's anti-party group that had been ex-
pelled from the JCP). Finally, Aidit presented the PKI 
position that it is impossible to build real Communism 
while there is still imperialism in the world--an attack 
on the Soviet program for building Communism in the Soviet 
Union. 
At the conclusion of Aidit's stay in the Soviet 
Union, the only official notice that the Soviets took of 
the CPSU-PKI discussions was a terse announcement in 
Pravda on 1 August that there had been an "exchange of 
views between Aidit and Brezhnev, Suslov, and Ponomarev 
on the international situation, on the international Com-
munist movement, and on questions of interparty relations". 
The fact that Pravda did not choose to characterize 
either the talks or the atmosphere in which they took 
place is a good indication that arguments did in fact 
take place and that relations between the two parties 
remained cool, although not openly hostile. 
Itseems that Aidit gave absolutely no indication 
of the approaching crisis in Indonesia in his talks with 
the Soviet leaders in July. Even if the PKI had been 
contemplating a coup, it seems unlikely that he would 
have trusted the CPSU with the details--even the knowledge--
of its planning. Apparently, Aidit did not even discuss 
the threat posed by the Indonesian army with the Soviet 
leaders; there is nothing to indicate that he ever men-
tioned the reports about the Generals' Council. In fact, 
there is nothing to indicate that he and the Soviet lead-
ers discussed PKI domestic policy at all. All the reports 
about their talks, including the Pravda comment, mentioned 
only international matters as having been discussed. 
-214-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Aidit is reported to have made one statement in 
Moscow that has--incorrectly, it seems--been interpreted 
as a reference to the coup or, at least, to PKI domestic 
policy. He is reported to have said something along the 
lines that the PKI following of the Soviet line would be 
tantamount to giving up the struggle in Indonesia." 
After the coup, the Soviets made quite a point of this 
particular statetent of Aidit, with the obvious intention 
of implying that as of July Aidit had plans for the vio-
lent overthrow of the Indonesian government. However, 
since the PKI was at the time pursuing a domestic line 
that was completely consistent with Soviet advice to 
Communists in "national democratic states," it seems 
quite clear that Aidit was not referring to PKI domestic 
tactics. It is much more likely that he was referring 
to the general Soviet policy towards the West--or the U.S., 
in particular. It was these policies of the Soviet Union 
that Aidit considered "revisionist." It would makq.sense 
that he would characterize them as "tantamount to giving 
up the revolutionary struggle." He would not have described 
the Soviet line on "peaceful transition to socialism," 
which was the line that the PKI was following domestically, 
in such terms. 
In the official Soviet report on the Indonesian coup 
that was given to the CPSU Congress in late March 1966, it 
was claimed that the Soviets had warned Aidit before the 
coup that the PKI was not putting up a strong enough struggle 
in the economic field, that should a political crisis arise, 
the PKI could lose its ties with the people because it had 
not done more to solve the land problem, correct the labor 
laws, and improve education. Aidit was criticized for 
"believing that all that was required was for the PKI to 
support Sukarno and it would be guaranteed success in 
taking power." Whether this was an accurate description of-
what the Soviets told Aidit or a disingenuous ex-post facto  
reading of the mistake Aidit made in relying too much on 
Sukarno can not be definitely determined. There are other 
charges in the Soviet report--such as the explanation 
given for the coup that "the PKI went over entirely to the 
Chinese line and Aidit concluded that the PKI had everything 
necessary to take power in Indonesia"--that would clearly 
seem to be self-serving distortions of the truth; they 
-215-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
suggest that the Soviets were probably also distorting 
the truth on the matter of what they told Aidit before 
the coup. Even if we accept the Soviet claim that they 
. warned the PKI against placing too much reliance on 
Sukarno, particularly in the economic field, it is not 
at all clear from the Soviet report to the CPSU Congress 
whether this was discussed during Aidit's last visit in 
Moscow, just before the coup or sometime earlier. In 
view of the vagueness about the timing and the fact that 
no other report of Aidit's discussions with the.Soviet 
leaders in July 1965 mentions this subject as having been 
discussed, we are skeptical of the Soviets having issued 
any such timely warning to the PKI just before the coup. 
In Peking  
Aidit was in Communist China only a few days, com-
pared with nearly a month in the Soviet Union. As noted 
earlier, there is no information available on his talks 
with the Chinese leaders other than the official Chinese 
announcement of the talks. According to NCNA, CCP-PKI 
talks were held on 3 and 4 August. Chou En-lai, Teng 
Hsiao-ping, Peng Chen, and Kang Sheng participated on the 
Chinese side. The three PKI/CC members--Karel Supit, 
Ruslan Kamaludin, and Nungtjik--who traveled to Peking 
with Aidit were present on the Indonesian side, along with 
Aidit and Adjitorop, the PKI Politburo member who had been 
staying in Peking for some time. (He is still in Peking, 
baying refused to return to Indonesia after the coup.) 
NCNA recorded that the talks were held in "a cordial and 
friendly atmosphere." 
The two sides fully exchanged views on the 
current international situation, questions 
concerning the international Communist move-
ment, and other matters of common interest 
to both parties. The two sides had a com-
plete unanimity of position and views on 
all these questions.

On the morning of 5 August, Aidit and the other members 
of the PKI delegation are reported to have had a "cordial 
conversation" with Mao himself. Later that evening, Mao 
is reported to have given a banquet in honor of the In-
donesian visitors. 
Our lack of information about Aidit's visit to China 
in early August 1965 is probably the most crucial gap in 
our knowledge of the events leading up to the Indonesian 
coup. As far as we know, the PKI did not brief party members, 
either before or after the coup, on Aidit's talks with 
Chinese leaders, as it did on his talks with the Soviet 
leaders, in July. It seems that Aidit would have reported 
on his talks with the Chinese, just as he did on his talks 
with the Soviets, if the talks had been innocuous. The 
fact that he apparently did not suggests that the talks were 
sensitive, that they may even have involved the coup. 
Any discussion that Aidit might have had with Mao or 
the other Chinese leaders about a coup in Indonesia would 
certainly have been held in the greatest secrecy; only a few 
persons would have known of it. It is obviously in the 
Chinese interest to keep anything like this that might be used 
to prove Chinese involvement in the planning of the coup a 
secret. It is unlikely that Aidit would have told anyone 
outside of the Standing Council of the PKI Politburo and Sjam 
about any conversation that he might have had with the Chinese 
about PKI planning for a coup. The only member of the Stand-
ing Council to be captured alive after the coup and interro-
gated by the Army before being sentenced to death--Sudisman--
threw absolutely no light on the subject, probably because he 
did not know. To our knowledge, Sjam was never questioned on 
this particular point.* 
*In the only reference to the Chinese at his trial, Sjam 
was asked about the connection between the PKI Special Bureau 
and the Chinese intelligence organization. He replied emphati-
cally that that there was "absolutely no connection whatsoever," 
at which point he launched into a lengthy discourse on the inde-
_pendence of the pm. The implication of his remarks was that 
the CCP was not informed about the Special Bureau operations 
- in Indonesia, and that he and Aidit were solely responsible for 
all decisions regarding the Special Bureau and that they were 
not in the habit of consulting the Chinese or any other foreign - 
Communist party about its operations. 
-217-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In any case, it seems that Aidit could not have 
discussed the specifics of the coup as it materialized 
on 1 October. Although Sjam may have been working on a 
plan while Aidit was abroad, most of the planning for the 
coup seems to have been done after Aidit returned home 
in early August. Aidit almost certainly did not have a 
definite plan in mind before he left Indonesia. As men-
tioned earlier, he does not seem to have felt any sense 
of urgency about the Generals' Council and its planning 
for a coup at the beginning of the summer--or he would 
certainly not have stayed away from Indonesia so long. 
The great �sense of urgency that he apparently came to 
leel in August and September seems to have been present 
only after his return to Indonesia. 
If one thing seems clear, it is that the decision 
to stage this coup was not made before early August. 
Something seems to have happened around the beginninglof 
August that drastically changed Aidit's mood and immedi-
ately prompted him to begin active preparations for a 
coup. There would seem to be two main possibilities, 
judging from everything that we know that occurred that 
first week in August. Either (a) Aidit was influenced 
by the Chinese while he was in Peking that week, in 
which case he could be presumed to have hurried home to. 
Indonesia to carry out the coup on Chinese instructions, 
or (b) he was influenced by someone or something that 
happened in Indonesia that he learned about as soon as 
he returned home; possibly, it was the reason for his 
returning home. 
Because of the timing of Aidit's visit to China 
and the start of PKI preparations for the coup almost im-
mediately upon his return from China, a case can be made 
on the basis of circumstantial evidence that the Chinese 
must have inspired the Indonesian coup. The theory can 
not be disproved on the basis of what we know about Aidit's 
talks with the Chinese leaders, as we have seen. We would 
not rule it out as a possibility, therefore, until we have 
more definite information. However, we are not convinced 
that the Chinese played any such direct role in the planning. 
-213-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of the coup, first of all, because there is no good evi-
dence that they did, except for the timing of Aidit's trip, 
and secondly, because there would seem to be a better ex-
planation for others having inspired the coup. 
From the Chinese point of view, what the PKI did 
on the night of 30 September was to commit itself not to 
an "armed struggle" on the CCP model (protracted warfare 
waged in the countryside by an armed force totally con-
trolled by the party) but rather to an urban putsch, some-
thing the CCP is not known ever to have sponsored abroad. 
This might not have mattered so much to the Chinese if 
they thought the chances for success favorable to the PKI 
and the risks acceptable. Certainly, they would have 
welcomed a successful purge of the anti-Communist army 
leadership in Indonesia. However, in this case, the PKI 
was risking its very existence in carrying out an action 
over which it did not have complete control, an actiqp 
which, in the last analysis, was completely dependent on 
Sukarno. The PKI was acting in concert with Sukarno, if 
not in subordination to him, at the mercy of his decisions 
and, as it turned out, of his betrayal. It is quite pos-
sible that the CCP trusted Sukarno so much (which is the 
great mistake that the PKI made) or was so impressed with 
the need for action--because of the imminent danger of-
Sukarno's death or an army coup or both--that it minimized 
or failed to realize the risk of Sukarno's backing out 
on a coup after the PKI had committed itself. The PKI 
made this mistake. 
Since the coup, the Chinese have Very definitely 
tried to convey the impression that the PKI acted con-
trary to Chinese doctrine in "assuming a position subor-
dinate to the national bourgeoisie." They have suggested 
that the "mistakes of one kind or another" that the PKI 
made were due to the party's failure to apply closely 
enough Mao's principles "for dealing with domestic counter-
revolutionaries"and for launching a new type bourgeois 
democratic revolution. There was only one report at the 
time that implied that the Chinese would not have approved 
PKI participation in an action like the 30 September Move-
ment; according to a rumor circulating in Peking in October 1965, 
-219-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Mao Tse-tung, upon hearing the news of the coup in Indonesia, 
immediately cabled the PKI with an "order" to call the whole 
thing off, thereby creating confusion in the PKI ranks. Sev-
eral months later, Chou En-lai also implied that the CCP 
advised the PKI against the coup--or at least that it would 
have advised the PKI that way if its advice had been solicited. 
In 1966 Chou is reported to have commented that the downfall 
of the PKI resulted from its failure to adhere to basic princi-
ples and its refusal to accept advice (presumably CCP advice). 
Unfortunately, all of these statements and rumors constitute 
a self-serving position which the Chinese would be likely to 
adopt whether or not they had previously approved what was 
"attempted on 30 September. 
For all these reasons, a direct Chinese role in the 
Indonesian coup must be considered unproven. The timing of 
Aidit's last visit with the Chinese leaders in Peking. is not 
in itself conclusive evidence that the Chinese either knew 
of the PKI planning for a coup or, further, that they might 
have suggested the idea to Aidit in the first place. 
Sukarno's Illness  
The most significant development that first week in 
August, aside from Aidit's visit to China, was Sukarno's 
illness, which was thought at the time to be very serious 
and which almost certainly played an important role in the 
events leading up to the coup. 
The facts about Sukarno's illness are now fairly well 
established. He suddenly became ill on the evening of 3 August. 
According to one report, he "collapsed" in the presence of 
several palace officials. Sukarno told the doctor who was 
immediately summoned to his bedside that he felt considerable 
chest pain which had seemed to come in three separate attacks 
lasting three to five minutes. He was given an electrocardio-
gram that evening and another on 4 August after two more 
recurrences of the chest pain. When these showed no evidence 
of coronary thrombosis, physicians treating the President 
concluded that "he had had five attacks of coronary insuffi-
ciency but no coronary infarct." 
-220-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
It is not clear whether there were any particular 
signs that Sukarno's kidney condition had suddenly be-
come critical.* There was one report that his blood urea 
nitrogen was elevated. However, in chronic renal disease, 
this would not be unusual; it would be significant only 
if it were elevated over its usual level, and we have 
no information on that. If there had been an abrupt 
change in Sukarno's kidney condition, presumably his 
doctors would have put him on dialysis or at least on a 
stringent diet; apparently, nothing of this sort was 
done. Thus, it would seem that there was no significant 
change in his kidney condition. In hindsight, it is 
clear that the President did not have uremic poisoning, 
which probably would have been fatal in his case and 
certainly would have required a longer convalescence than 
his illness took.. But at the time, there was cause for 
worry. It is understandable that Sukarno's doctors should 
immediately have gotten in touch with the Viennese kidney 
specialist, Dr. Fellinger, who had treated Sukarno Ipre-
viously. They are reported to have sent him a cable ad-
vising him of the illness and seeking his opinion. 
Besides his history of kidney disease, Sukarno 
was known to have moderate hypertension which was aggra-
vated at times of stress. The combination of impaired 
renal function and hypertension could give rise to a 
*As was well known, Sukarno suffered from chronic 
kidney disease, having lost the use of one kidney because 
of kidney stones and having been advised repeatedly by 
his doctors that the other one should be operated on 
for the removal of a large stone in it. Sukarno had 
never agreed to an operation, however. Because of a 
soothsayer's prediction that "he would die under the 
knife," he has an obsessive fear of surgery. 
-221-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
number of complications that might suddenly cause death 
at any time. (On the other hand, one can live for years 
with this condition.) Under the circumstances, it is 
quite understandable that Sukarno's doctors (including 
the Chinese doctors who were summoned from Peking to 
treat him) came to the conclusion that Sukarno was suf-
fering from some serious complication brought on by his 
kidney problem, even though there were none of the usual 
signs of kidney involvement. 
The possibility of Sukarno's illness being nothing 
more than the flu was considered at the time. Nasution, 
for one, considered it a good possibility. All the report-
ed symptoms of the illness--the sudden onset, the vomiting, 
the aches and pains, and the general state of exhaustion--
plus the complete recovery within a matter of a few days 
are compatible with a diagnosis of a severe attack of 
influenza. During the first two weeks in August, many 
cases of viral infection were reported in Djakarta, with 
symptoms similar to those of Sukarno. Thus, we would not 
rule out the possibility that the President's illness was 
some kind of viral gastroenteritis, totally unrelated to 
his kidney disease. 
Apparently, Sukarno was bedridden for several days. 
He cancelled a speech that had been scheduled for 4 August. 
He was still in bed on 6 August but was reported to be 
up and working on 9 August. To cover his illness, the 
story was given out that he was working on the speech 
that he was to give on 17 August. 
There was little public knowledge of the fact that 
Sukarno was sick. However, political and military leaders 
who knew of Sukarno's illness were following the situation 
-222-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
closely and, as was to be expected, were engaging in 
various speculations. It was natural that they should 
prepare for the eventuality that the illness was serious. 
The fact that Sukarno's doctors and the palace coterie 
were keeping the nature of the illness so close that 
even Sukarno's ministerial advisers were unable to learn 
the cause or seriousness only contributed to the sense 
of alarm. (Apparently, Nasution learned about Sukarno's 
illness from a conversation with the wife of one of 
Sukarno's doctors.) 
Sukarno himself appears to have been genuinely 
alarmed. One suspects that it was his own concern--as 
much as the concern of his doctors--that his illness was 
serious that prompted him to keep the fact of his illness 
a secret from the public. The main reason, however, for 
thinking that Sukarno was extremely worried is the fact 
that he called Aidit home from abroad. 
An Urgent Suthmons to Aidit 
There is no doubt that it was a message from 
Sukarno, not a summons from the other PKI leaders at., 
home as was originally reported, that brought Aidit back 
to Indonesia. 
Apparently, Sukarno was not willing to wait even 
a day or two to see whether his condition improved before 
he called Aidit home. It is not clear whether Aidit re-
ceived Sukarno's telegram on the 4th or 5th of August; 
the only thing that is clear is that it was sometime be-
fore the morning of the 6th, when he departed Peking in 
a hurry. It is unlikely that Aidit would have delayed 
even as long as a day in returning home, so the presump-
tion is that he received the message on the 5th, or pos-
sibly early in the morning of the 6th. The Chinese press 
reported that he left "by special plane," which would 
indicate that the Chinese immediately made a plane avail-
able to Aidit for his emergency trip home.

It seems that Aidit may actually have been planning 
to leave Peking on the 6th or the 7th or shortly there-
after. On 5 August, he had met with Mao and been enter-
tained by him at a banquet that evening; this is usually 
.the wind-up of a visit of an important dignitary to China 
for talks with the Chinese leaders. Of course, the Chi-
nese could have scheduled the meeting with Mao and given 
Aidit a farewell banquet on the 5th when they learned 
that he would be leaving prematurely the next day. In 
any case, Aidit had plans to go on to North Vietnam for 
talks with the North Vietnamese leaders; he was clearly 
not planning to return to Indonesia directly. After he 
left on a special plane for Djakarta, the rest of the PKI 
-delegation that had been with him in Moscow and Peking 
flew on to Hanoi on 7 August. Karel Supit took over as 
head of the delegation. 
Aidit arrived in Djakarta on 7 August, in the com-
pany of two Chinese medical specialists whom Sukarno lad 
instructed Aidit to bring with him to treat his kidney 
condition. (This is the best indication we have that 
Sukarno himself thought that his illness was a flare-up 
of his kidney condition.) Presumably, Aidit and the doc-
tors hurried to the palace to see Sukarno, although we 
have no reporting on this. Sukarno may still have been 
in bed on the 7th. All we know is that he was out of bed 
on the 9th and apparently well enough to drive to Bogor 
Palace. (He returned to Djakarta on the 10th.) On the 
morning of 9 August, Aidit is known to have traveled to 
Bogor, accompanied by the two Chinese Communist doctors. 
Sukarno's Indonesian doctors were also summoned to Bogor 
that morning to examine Sukarno. It would seem that 
there was a medical consultation of all the doctors on 
the President's illness. 
By the 9th, Sukarno was probably pretty well re-
covered. '1 A week later, he delivered his traditional 
National Day speech in the normal rousing Sukarno style. 
There is no indication that he was less than his usual 
ebullient self at any time after this up to the time of 
the coup. In fact, as we shall see, he played a very 
active role in the events of the next several months. 
He does not seem to have suffered any lasting effects from 
his illness of early August. 
-224-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
But if Sukarno was safely over this particular at-
tack, the Chinese doctors seem to have been of the opinion 
that a recurrence would either paralyze or kill him. And, 
apparently, they expected a recurrence toz.come soon. At 
least, that was the gist of Aidit's report to the Polit-
buro which was based on the Chinese doctors' conclusions. 
Aidit reported that the doctors "were very pessimistic 
regarding Sukarno's health and tended to believe that he 
would die or become unable to rule within a short time." 
The Chinese doctors must have thought that Sukarno's ill-
ness was related to his kidney problem, or something equally 
serious. 
The PKI in a State of Panic 
The PKI obviously felt that it had inside informa-
tion on the state of the President's health.* Aidit seems 
to have accepted the Chinese doctors' conclusions completely. 
His reports to the Politburo were based on these conclu-
sions; the serious state of the President's health was 
accepted at all levels of the party. In mid-August, the 
PKI began to make contingency plans in the event of Sukarno's 
*The PKI s direct access to the Chinese doctors put 
the party in the position of having more valid grounds 
for concern about the President's health than existed in 
.non-party circles. The question that inevitably arises 
is whether the doctors were acting on Peking's instruc-
tions in giving the PKI an unduly pessimistic report on 
Sukarno's health. In other words, did the Chinese take 
advantage of the situation to frighten the, PKI into ac-
tion? 7There is no evidence to prove the case either way, 
but we are not inclined to believe in the theory of a 
doctors' plot. First of all, it seems likely that the 
Chinese doctors really were convinced of the seriousness 
�of Sukarno's illness; there was good reason to be. Second-
ly, there is no reason to think that the Chinese were 
anxious to pressure the PKI into precipitate action. 
-225-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624

death. On 13 August, the Greater Djakarta Committee (CDR) 
of the PKI sent special instructions to its 50 subsection 
committees on the "preparations that were to be made in 
anticipation of the possible death or incapacitation of 
Sukarno and repressive measures by the Army at that time." 
It was explained that the Army knew about Sukarno's 
precarious health and was making plans to seize power 
upon his death. 
From this and other PKI briefings to party members 
in August and September, it would seem that the PKI really 
thought that the Army would move against it as soon as 
the PKI was without Sukarno's protection. Since Sukarno's 
death was considered an imminent possibility, the PKI was 
faced with the immediate prospect of-having to defend it-
self against the Army. Aidit was under no illusions as 
to the PKI's chances in a military showdown with the Army. 
In some PKI documents, the view was expressed that the 
Army would probably be in control in the immediate post-
Sukarno period. That the party felt very much on the 
defensive was indicated in the 13 August instructions 
to the party subsections in Djakarta to remove all party 
documents, particularly cadres and membership lists, from 
homes and offices and to hide them elsewhere. Later in 
the month, party members were ordered to hide any part 
documents or Marxist-Leninist books in their personal 
possession; if necessary, they were to burn them. In 
another instruction, party members were told to locate 
homes that might be used as hideouts for party officials. 
(The homes had to be located in crowded areas, away from 
main roads, and have several means of entry.) The in-
formation that we have on these party briefings in August 
and September, as well as other reporting on the PKI, 
clearly indicates that the PKI was increasingly concerned 
with three things during the weeks immediately preceding 
the coup: (1) the possible sudden deterioration of 
Sukarno's heath, (2) possible Army action against the 
PKI, and (3) the general unreadiness of PKI cadres for 
the future struggle.

thc iotithuro 
The general political situation and the subject of 
the President's health were discussed at a PKI Politburo 
meeting sometime around mid-August, although the dates of 
this and another Politburo meeting at which the actual 
decision committing the PKI to the coup was taken are some-
what less than certain. Sakirman, Njono, and Pardede, all 
of whom were at the meeting, have given differing dates. 
Njono spoke of "an expanded session of the Politburo around 
the end of July" and another meeting of the Politburo" on 
28 August." Obviously, the first meeting could not have 
been in July since Njono makes it clear that Aidit took 
the lead in the discussions and the-PKI Chairman was out 
of the country from 26 June until 7 August. Taking into 
consideration both facts--(1) that Aidit was at the meeting 
and (2) that Njono remembered it as having been held 
"around the end of July," it seems a reasonable conlusion 
that the meeting was held soon after Aidit returned to 
Indonesia. Sakirman gave 13 August as the date, and 
Pardede mentioned 15 August. One reason for thinking 
that the meeting may have been held on 13 August is the 
fact that the Greater Djakarta Committee of the PKI is 
known to have issued the party instructions referred /o 
above on 13 August. It seems quite likely that these in-
structions were issued as adirect result of the Politburo 
deliberations. 
Besides the following members of the Politburo--
Aidit, Lukman, Njoto, Sudisman, Sakirman, Njono, Anwar 
Sanusi, Pardede, and Suwandi--the secretaries of the West 
Java and East Java Committees of the PKI are known to have 
attended the expanded session of the Politburo. (The 
secretary of the Central Java Committee could not attend 
because of illness.) According to Njono, the meeting was 
"of an informative character; no decisions were made." 
Aidit gave information on the President's illness, 
on the impatience of progressive officers in the 
military with the so-called council of generals, 
and the plans of the generals' council for a coup. 
-227-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In Sakirman's words: 
Sukarno's illness was discussed and also 
certain military and political questions 
that arose in connection with Sukarno's 
illness. It was concluded that should the 
President die the leadership of the MPRS 
would replacp Sukarno temporarily while the 
possibility also existed that the political 
parties would scramble to seize power and 
certainly the Armed Forces would not remain 
quiet but would seize upon this opportunity 
to take over state power. It was also con-
cluded that within the Armed Forces, especi-
ally the Army, there had arisen severe anta-
gonism between the Generals (the term 'Gen-
erals' Council' was not used a.,t this time) 
under the leadership of Nasution and Yani, 
on the one side, and the middle grade offic-
ers and subordinates, on the other. It was 
concluded that the PKI must support the group 
within the Armed Forces that opposed the gen-
erals. The names of the officers who opposed 
the generals were not mentioned.* 
The PKI decision to launch the 30 September Move-
ment seems to have been taken at a second Politburo meet-
ing in late August, although again the dates are uncertain. 
In his testimony in court, SaKirman gave 10 September as 
the date of the meeting, but this seems unlikely inasmuch 
as active preparations for the coup were already underway 
*Peris Pardede confirmed this last point of Sakirman. 
According to Pardede, neither Aidit nor anyone else ever 
told the Politburo the names of the military officers 
who would stage the coup. This is a good example of the 
compartmentalization of information within the PKI as 
far as the coup was concerned. 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
by then. (It will be remembered that Untung and the 
other military officers were brought into the conspiracy 
on 4 September:) Njono's recollection of the meeting 
as having been on 28 August seems more reasonable.* 
Whatever the exact date of the meeting, the Politburo 
clearly approved the decision to launch the 30 September 
Movement. This is particularly noteworthy in that the 
Special Bureau normally took its orders directly from 
Aidit; not only was it completely free of the control 
of the Politburo, but the Politburo was not even kept 
informed of its operations. In a matter as important 
as this, however, Aidit seems to have felt the neces-
sity of securing Politburo approval. With its approval, 
he was prepared to turn the whole matter of the planning 
and execution of the coup over to the Special Bureau. 
The various accounts of the Politburo meeting on 
28 August are in basic agreement as to what transpired 
at the meeting. All are agreed that Aidit took the lead 
in the discussions, as he had done at the first meeting 
on 13 August. The burden of his argument was that (1) 
the state of the President's health was serious; if he had 
another attack he would probably die or be paralyzed; 
(2) a Council of Generals existed in the Army that was. 
discussing Sukarno's health and making plans for action 
in the event of his death.** In Aidit's words, the 
It is an interesting coincidence that the decision 
on D Day seems to have been made on the 28th of September, 
exactly a month to the day after the Politburo is report-
ed to have made the decision to start preparations for 
a coup. 
**Apparently, Aidit was the source of all the informa-
tion given the Politburo on the President's health. His 
information on Sukarno's illness came from the Chinese 
doctors; he seems to have accepted their conclusions com-
pletely--and, in turn, the other Politburo members seem 
to have accepted his word on this and the matter of the 
Generals' Council without question. 
-229-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
question was whether the PKI should wait until the Presi-
dent died and find itself suddenly attacked (because the 
generals would almost certainly know of Sukarno's death 
before the PKI did) or whether the party should anticipate 
the Army's action and attack first? As one participant 
quoted Aidit, "Shall we jump first or wait to be jumped? 
I (Aidit) am more inclined toward moving first." 
Apparently, Aidit convinced the whole Politburo 
of the need for prompt action. It is unclear whether a 
vote was taken or whether it was simply the consensus 
of the meeting that the PKI should begin to make its own 
plans for a coup. According to Sakirman, 
it was concluded that the situation had 
heightened considerably and that the PKI 
could not remain silent. The PKI had to 
act first or be acted upon. According to 
experience, he who acts second cannot 
achieve victory; he who acts first shall 
win. 
According to Njono, 
It was established that subsequently the 
President would give his approval to these 
military operations as a matter of course. 
This was because the facts on the Council 
of Generals were in the hands of Sukarno, 
according to what Aidit said. 
Special attention was given to certain other 
individuals, including Subandrio. It was 
established that aubandrio would adapt him-
self to the policy of the President. 
The various sources are agreed on another important 
point--that along with the decision to launch a military 
movement there was a definite decision on the political 
movement that would be launched in support of the military 
movement. Njono explained that the meeting agreed "to 
-230-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
launch a movement to foil the so-called coup of the coun-
cil of generals and subsequently to set up a council of 
the revolution to replace the Dwikora cabinet." Sakirman's 
testimony supports this: 
It was concluded that-in addition to the mili-
tary movement there had to be a political 
movement. The military and political move-
ments were to be led directly by the PKI and 
aimed at (1) supporting resistance against 
the generals and (2) setting up the Revolu-
tionary Council which would replace the Cabinet. 
Of the two movements, the military movement 
would come first; this was what was later 
called the 30 September Movement. 
During the meeting, I (Sakirman) proposed that 
another course be followed; namel:, that t. 
there should be deliberation among the poli-
tical parties, the armed forces. and Sukarno.* 
*It is not exactly clear what Sakirman meant by "deli-
beration among the political parties. the armed forces, 
and Sukarno." Presumably, he meant that this should take 
place after the military operation of the coup was a fait 
accompli (i.e. after the generals had been removed from 
the scene). In other words, he seems to have been propo-
ing political discussions between the political parties. 
the armed forces, and Sukarno as the means for arriving 
at a political solution to the coup. Aidit, on the other 
hand, had a very definite idea of the political solution 
that was acceptable to the PKI--namely, the replacement 
of the Dwikora cabinet by a Revolutionary Council whose 
members the PKI would select as representative of all the 
major political parties, including the Communists. Aidit 
was prepared to take action along these lines, by simply 
announcing the formation of the Revolutionary Council, 
without consulting any of the other parties. 
Sakirman's claim to having made an alternative pro-
posal to the course followed by the PKI in setting up 
(footnote continued on page 232) 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
It was explained that Subandrio, Dani, Marta-
dinata, Surachman and others would sit on 
the Revolutionary Council. The complete 
list of names would be worked out later by 
Aidit, Njoto, and Lukman. My proposal was 
not accepted; Aidit and Lukman provided 
reasons for rejecting it. 
From both Sakirman's and Njono's account of the Politburo 
meeting, it is clear that the Revolutionary Council was 
included in the earliest planning of the PKI for the coup, 
that it was in fact agreed upon by the Politburo itself. 
Other facts�such as the fact that Untung and the other 
military leaders apparently had nothing_whatever'to do 
with the formation of the Revolutionary Council except 
to sign the Decree that Sjam gave them to sign on the 
morning of 1 October--suggest that the PKI was responsi-
ble for the Revolutionary Council.* The information Oat 
we have on the proceedings of the Politburo meeting makes 
it clear beyond any doubt that the Revolutionary Council 
was central to PKI planning for the coup from the begin-
ning; in fact, the replacement of the Dwikora Cabinet by 
(footnote continued from page 231) 
the Revolutionary Council is the only hint we have of 
there having been any disagreement within the Politburo 
on the subject of the coup. It is possible that Sakirman 
was somewhat exaggerating his differences with Aidit in 
an obvious attempt to exonerate himself of responsibility 
for the coup. After the coup, he seems honestly to have 
regretted the whole affair, for very personal reasons, 
namely, the fact that his brother (General Parman) was 
one of the victims of the coup. He may not have realized 
that Gen. Parman would be killed. 
*At his trial, Sudisman admitted that the PKI had 
drafted Untung's "first announcement" and "the Decree" 
establishing the Revolutionary Council. It had also 
picked the members of the Revolutionary Council which 
Was intended to reflect "a broad coalition of people who 
had endorsed Nasakom." 
-232-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the Revolutionary Council was the main political aim of 
the coup to be realized after the military objective of 
eliminating the top Army command had been realized. 
Njono's and Sakirman's accounts of the Politburo 
meeting also help to clear up another matter, namely, 
the role that the PKI intended the Revolutionary Council 
to play in the government after the coup. There was con-
siderable confusion about this at the time, because of 
the wording of the Decree, which failed to mention Sukarno 
or the office of the Presidency or the cabinet. It is 
clear from Njono's and Sakirman's testimony that the 
Revolutionary Council was intended to replace the Dwikora 
Cabinet. There was no intent on the part of the PKI to 
do away with Sukarno; he was definitely to continue as 
President--with all the same powers. Neither the office 
of the Presidency nor the role of the cabinet in the 
government would have been changed as a direct resqlt of 
the coup. All that the coup would have changed wagethe 
composition of the cabinet. From the point of view of 
the PKI, the Revolutionary Council would have been the 
perfect Nasakom cabinet that the party had been long de-
manding:* 
*In his testimony in court, Sjam denied that the coup 
was to be followed by the establishment of a Communist 
government. He asserted that the Revolutionary Council 
would have formed a "Nasakom coalition government slate 
to present to Sukarno." When the judge tried to imply 
that Sukarno would not have accepted such a coalition 
cabinet, Sjam snapped back: "We knew he would approve:" 
Politburo member Sudisman's testimony on the matter 
of the Revolutionary Council supports Sjam. He described 
the Revolutionary Council as "a broad coalition of people 
who had endorsed Nasakom," He made it clear that the 
Revolutionary Council was intended to serve "as the supreme 
organ of the state faithfully implementing the policies 
of Bung Karno." The plan was to replace the Dwikora 
cabinet with the new Nasakom cabinet led by the PKI. The 
coup was not a Communist revolution; it was intended only 
to "change the Dwikora cabinet and its program." However, 
in the long run, the coup was viewed as "another step on 
the road to a 'Peoples' Democracy' and finally to 'Communism.'" 
233-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
It seems clear that none of the military details 
of the coup were discussed at the Politburo meeting. It 
was agreed that the Politburo would handle the political 
matters involved in the coup and "all the preparations 
.for the military movement would be turned over to Aidit." 
Apparently, it was well understood that Aidit had his 
own special apparatus within the party for handling 
covert operations, especially operations involving the 
military; it was assumed that both the planning and 
execution of the military operation of the coup would 
be entrusted to that secret organization. The Politburo 
had to take Aidit's word on the capability of that or-
ganization for planning an operation like the 30 September 
Movement; obviously, the Special Bureau had never been 
involved in an operation of this magnitude before. 
As the final conclusion of the meeting, it was 
decided that "no matter what happened, whether the PKI 
acted first or was acted upon, members of the party 1.ad-
ership should go to the regions and wait for instructions 
from the party leadership." 
According to Pens Pardede, there were only the 
two Politburo discussions of the coup. Pardede himself 
was to hear nothing more about the coup until two or 
three days before it occurred when he was briefed on his 
own role in it (he was to go to Medan to coordinate PKI 
activities in support of the coup in North Sumatra). 
Pardede testified that he had assumed all the while that 
preparations were going ahead under the direction of 
Aidit and the Special Bureau (he did not know the name 
of the Special Bureau but he knew of its existence) but 
he was not privy to the planning that was underway. 
At best, it was only a week or so between the 
Politburo decision "to launch a movement to foil the so-
called coup of the generals' council" and the start of 
active preparations for the coup with the first of Sjam's 
meetings with Untung and the other military officers. 
Obviously, Aidit and Sjam were not disposed to waste any 
time. It does not seem to have taken them long to work 
out the actual plan for the coup. It will be remembered 
that Aidit had asked Sjam to develop some kind of a plan 
-234-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of operations against the Generals' Council in May 1965, 
just before he left for Moscow. Presumably, Sjam had 
been working on a plan during the summer while Aidit was 
away. There is nothing to indicate that either he or 
Aidit was thinking in terms of the elimination of the 
generals at that time, however. The idea of a military 
coup against the generals seems to have crystallized in 
August, after AidAt's return to Indonesia. Thus, it 
seems that the actual planning for the coup was probably 
done the last week or two in August. Perhaps, as he 
claims, Sjam deserves the credit for having planned the 
Indonesian coup. Since his capture, he has admitted--in 
fact, boasted--that he was "the brains behind the 30 
September Movement."* Just what contribution Aidit made 
to the planning is unclear; certainly, he approved all 
the plans. 
Sukarno Recovered...and with Aidit 
While the Politburo was discussing the political 
crisis arising from Sukarno's illness, the health of the 
President gradually improved. Actually, Sukarno seems 
to have been sick only about a week; by the 9th of Auflust 
he was apparently almost completely recovered. It was 
another week before he appeared in public, however. It 
was widely speculated that he would be unable to participate 
*As a witness at Sudisman's trial, Sjam was asked by 
the judges: "Who was really responsible for the coup?" 
"I was," he said proudly. This was the only point of his 
testimony that was not confirmed by Sudisman, who immedi-
ately objected. He said that he and Sjam were both carry-
ing out Aidit's orders. "I (Sudisman), as a ranking party 
leader along with Aidit, Lukman, and Njoto, bore full re-
sponsibility." Sjam immediately denied that Sudisman was 
a party leader at the same level as Aidit, Lukman, and 
Njoto. Reportedly the court was amused by the display 
of rivalry between the PKI leaders. 
-23S-

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
in the National Day celebrations marking the 20th anniver-
sary of Indonesia's independence, but this was disproved 
when the President appeared on 17 August, apparently in 
his customary good health, to deliver a rousing Sukarno 
.speech. This did not make the PKI pull back. As we have 
seen, it was ten days later, at a Politburo meeting, that 
the final decision on the coup was taken. 
Sukarno's activities the last two months before 
the coup are a matter of great interest. Obviously, they 
hold the answer to what is probably the most important 
question about the Indonesian coup that remains unresolved 
today: the question of Sukarno's involvement in the plan-
-fling of the coup.* Unfortunately, not too much is known 
about Sukarno's activities those last two months before 
the coup, at least not too much that can be connected with 
the coup. 
In early August, when Sukarno was suddenly taken 
ill, it will be remembered that he summoned Aidit home 
from Peking. The PKI leader was one of the few persons 
who saw Sukarno while he was sick. All during August and 
September, Sukarno and Aidit were in constant contact. 
There were numerous official occasions which brought them 
together; on these occasions, there was almost always an 
opportunity for talk in private.** Aidit and Sukarno saw 
*By 'involvement' is meant the whole range of possi-
bilities from Sukarno's not having been involved at all, 
even to the extent of his having foreknowledge of what 
the PKI was planning, to the possibility that he knew and 
approved PKI plans for a coup, to the possibility that 
the idea of the coup was his to begin with and Aidit and 
the PKI were doing his will in carrying out a purge of 
the Army that both Sukarno and the PKI stood to profit from. 
**One such official occasion was the occasion of Sukar-
no's presenting Aidit with the order of the Mahaputra Star. 
The ceremony took place in the state palace on 13 September. 
The decoration of Aidit was reported to be for his accomplish-
ment -in obtaining additional credits and a supply of arms

each other at social occasions, too. Aidit was often in-
vited to the Palace in the evenings. Besides the times 
that Aidit and the President were reported to have met in 
private, there were probably many other meetings that went 
unreported. In short, Aidit had ready access to Sukarno 
just before the c9up. They could eaSily have discussed 
the matter of the coup. If Sukarno ever discussed the 
coup with anyone. it would certainly have been with Aidit. 
(He may also have-discussed it with Dani and Subandrio.) 
Although he could easily have done so, and there is good 
reason to think that he did, it should be emphasized that 
there is no evidence that Sukarno ever discussed the mat-
ter of the coup with Aidit--other than the fact that Aidit 
and Sjam both implied that he had in certain references 
to Sukarno in connection with the coup.* 
"Sukarno Against the Generals' Council  
During the six weeks that Aidit had been out of the 
country, Sukarno had apparently become increasingly alarmed 
by the rumors about a Generals' Council and its alleged 
plotting for a coup. Since May, when he had first heard 
the reports about the Generals' Council, he had continued 
to receive other reports from the PKI and the BPI to the 
effect that the generals were plotting his overthrow. 
Aidit had mentioned these reports to a meeting of the 
Politburo in May, before he left for Moscow. While he

mobile brigade. It was thought at the time that the an-
nouncement of the arms shipment was an attempt to explain 
the shipment of arms that had already been received in 
Indonesia from China. The incident is interesting as an 
illustration of Sukarno's close identification with Aidit 
just before the coup. In late May Sukarno had lent his 
prestige to the celebration of the PKI's 45th anniversary; 
in mid-September, he conferred a state honor on the Com-
munist party leader. 
*Aidit implied that he had talked with Sukarno when he 
told the Politburo that the President would give his ap-
proval to the coup "as a matter of course." He said that 
he knew this "because the facts on the Generals' Council 
are in the hands of Sukarno." Sjam reportedly told Untung. 
Latief, and Sujono (at their third meeting) that "the great 
leader of the revolution has his own role (in the coup). _ 
The Bung will later on obtain a separate settlerent."

was out of the country, knowledge of the existence of the 
Generals Council and the rumor that it was preparing for a 
coup had spread throughout the PKI organization. More than 
anyone else, the PKI was responsible for spreading the 
rumor; by the end of the summer, it was heard everywhere 
in Djakarta. By late August or early September, the 
Generals' Council had become an open secret. 
As mentionea earlier, Sukarno had tended to place 
full trust in the information supplied him by the PKI, and 
of course, the BPI. In this instance, he would have been 
predisposed to believe what the PKI was telling him; namely, 
that a group of generals in the Army was "out to get him;" 
apparently, this time, he became convinced of it. Of course, 
it is impossible to know for sure whether Sukarno really  
believed that the generals were plotting a coup or whether 
he just pretended to believe it--as a pretext for a coup of 
his own making. All that can be said for sure is that he 
acted as though he believed it. After the coup, he said 
in public that he believed it, but he might have said that, 
whether or not it was true, to justify the coup. A more 
convincing performance was his direct confrontation with 
Nasution shortly after the coup, when he charged Nasution 
with complicity in the Generals' Council. Nasution grimly 
denied it. Then Sukarno said: "But you were aware of a 
plan by Yani and his men to take power from me." Nasution 
denied this, too. Sukarno lost his temper and said: "You 
are lying. You must have known." Nasution then replied: 
"Bapak, false accusations are even worse than murder." 
(The reference was to Nasution's belief that Sukarno had 
been responsible for the murder of the generals.) On this 
and other occasions, Sukarno seemed truly incredulous that 
the Army had not really been plotting his ouster.* 
*Apparently, Nasution himself had the impression that 
Sukarno believed the reports about the Generals' Council. 
In his speech of 20 February 1967 indicting Sukarno for his 
role in the coup, Nasution had the following to say about 
his meeting with the President in November 1965: 
General Suharto reported to me that slanders about 
me were reaching the President. On the general's 
initiative I met with the President in November 
in an attempt to lay to rest the slander that I

Shortly before the coup, around 20 September, Sukarno 
is reported to have summoned Nasution and Yani and asked 
them about the -reports about the Generals' Council, which 
he had asked them about at least once before, on 26 May, 
at the meeting of military commanders at which he first 
raised the subject of the Generals' Council and the Gilchrist 
Letter. On the latter occasion, Sukarno is reported to have 
told Nasution and Yani that he had new information that sev-
eral high-ranking-generals were cooperating in an attempt to 
overthrow the government.* When Nasution and Yani asked for 
(footnote continued from page 238) 
was involved in the attempt to assassinate the 
President, and so on. I received the impression 
that the President still was mot convinced that 
the story about a council of generals was a 
slander and that he still entertained doubts 
about several generals. 
Therefore, with the agreement of the commanders 
of the four services, I appointed the Odang 
Committee to investigate the truth of the 
matter. The committee found absolutely no 
evidence that the council of generals was 
planning a coup as has been announced. This 
was reported to the President. There is no 
doubt that the President received information 
that led him to suspect the Army, and during 
the incident (the 30 September Movement) he 
retained his suspicions and placed the most 
trust in Supardjo and his followers. This is 
proven by his own statement and by his letters 
to Dewi on 1 and 2 October. The letter of 1 
October said that Sukarno had received informa-
tion from several persons about things that had 
7.occurred in the Army. It said that the men who 
were carrying out this so-called revolution in-
tended to safeguard Bapak and did not intend to 
oppose him, so Dewi should not worry because 
Bapak was safe. 
*According to a reliable source, the PKI told Sukarno in 
mid-August that the Generals group was planning a coup for 
5 October (Armed Forces Day). When Sukarno later learned 
that an unusual number of army generals and troops were to 
(footnote continued on page 240) 
-239-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the names of the generals, Sukarno refused to divulge them. 
Apparently, Yani and Nasution avoided a direct answer on 
the question of the Generals' Council. Instead they coun-
tered with the charge that it was the PKI that seemed to be 
preparing for a coup. In support of their argument, they 
presented Sukarno with a report on recent PKI activities, 
which showed a definite increase in violence on the part of 
the PKI. It is unclear whether Yani and Nasution showed 
Sukarno the Army report on the PKI on the same occasion that 
Sukarno confronted them on the question of the Generals' 
Council. There may have been two different meetings. 
A conversation that Sukarno is reported to have had 
with General Adjie in July is about the best evidence we 
have that Sukarno was genuinely concerned about the possi-
bility of an Army coup. The conversation is even more 
interesting in connection with the question of Sukarno's 
involvement in the coup. According to an unconfirmed 
report, Adjie, the pro-Sukarno but anti-Communist commander 
of the Army in West Java, was approached by Sukarno in 
July with the report that Yani and other senior generals 
were plotting a coup against him. Sukarno is reported to 
have promised Adjie that he could have Yani's job as 
Commander-in-chief of the Army if Adjie helped to preserve 
order during the trying period after Yani and the other 
generals were arrested. There was no mention of PKI in-
volvement or of any intention to assassinate the generals. 
According to the report, Adjie agreed, and the deal was 
settled when Sukarno bestowed a medal on Adjie and singled 
out the West Java Division of the Army for praise in his 
National Day speech on 17 August. For his part, Adjie made 
a public statement that he would obey only orders from 
(footnote continued from page 239) 
be in Djakarta for the Armed Forces Day Parade, he became 
concerned. Around 20 September, the PKI reported to 
Sukarno :that these army units were being issued a double 
issue of ammunition. According to the source, this 
convinced Sukarno that the generals were planning a coup 
and he agreed with the PKI that counterplans should be 
made. 
-240-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Sukarno, no matter what happened.* 
The Month of September k Flurry of Speeches 
With the exception of Adjie, the Army generals came 
under strong attack from Sukarno in his National Day speech 
of 17 August. In the context of the speech, it was obvious 
that he meant the generals when he said: 
Those who were progressive yesterday are 
possibly retrogressive, anti-progressive today. 
.Those who were revoluticnary yesterday are 
possibly counter-revolutionary today. Those 
who were radical yesterday are possibly soft 
and resistless today . . . Even if you were 
formerly a.-bald-headed general in 1945, if 
you split the revolutionary national unity 
today, if you are an enemy of the main 
pillars of the revolution today, then you 
have become a force of reactionon. 
The speech was the first in a series of fiery speeches by 
Sukarno in August and September that contained the same 
violent condemnation of the army leaders. Usually, the 
phrase "capitalist bureaucrats" was used, but that de-
ceived no one. In the tortuous phraseology of Indonesian 
politics, everybody knew that "capitalist bureaucrats" 
meant the army generals who were blocking the Communists' 
and apparently the President's way. 
*According to the source of the report on the Sukarno-
Adjie conversation, the deal Sukarno made with Adjie explaiLiz 
why Untung and the PKI thought they could hold Djakarta 
with only a few battalions. They were confident that Adjie 
would not order the Siliwangi troops under his command 
against the coup forces. Apparently, it was not Adjie 
who ordered the Siliwangi troops into Djakarta on the 
morning of the coup but a subordinate commander whose unit 
was already in Djakarta. Adjie didn't move even after he 
heard the radio announcement about the revolutionary 
council. On 2 October, Suharto is reported to have con-
tacted him and ordered him to bring troops to Djakarta, 
but Adjie refused until he contacted Sukarno. Apparently, 
when Adjie learned that the PKI was involved in the coup 
and heard that the generals had:been killed, he backed 
out on _Sukarno and finally moved his forces against the 
coup.. He behaved weakly after that, as far as the Army 
was concerned, in not taking a strong stand against 
Sukarno, however.

On 1 September, Sukarno spoke at a police "Revolu-
tionary Doctrine" rally. At one point in his speech, he 
looked directly at the four service commanders sitting 
in the front row and in dolce voce addressed each one in 
turn. To Dani, he said that the Air Force was a good 
revolutionary-force, because it was studying Marxism-
Leninism (a reference to Dani's introduction of courses 
in Marxism-Leninism-in the Air Force). To Martadinata, he 
said that the Navy was a revolutionary force now, although 
it had been in "some trouble" earlier in the year. To 
Police CoMmander Sutjipto he said that the police force 
would soon be a revolutionary force because of its new 
-"Revolutionary Doctrine" program. To Yani, he said: "But, 
the Army is NOT a revolutionary force. It is still blocking 
me. I will use my charismatic power and turn the people 
against you. The people will crush you." Yani is reported 
to have laughed. 
The next day, Subandrio took up Sukarno's theme. 
On 2 September, he told an audience in Menado: "If the 
leadership in Indonesia is in the hands of corruptors, 
the people have the right to take over from them. Power 
must be in the hands of the people, and it is you who will 
determine the destruction of the corruptors." On 9 September, 
he urged a student gathering to "smash �the exploiters and 
capitalist bureaucrats, annihilate the pilferers of the 
state's wealth." On 21 September, Subandrio told another 
audience that the Indonesian revolution had given birth to 
a lot of heroes, but that some of these heroes had now 
turned into traitors. These "heroes-turned-traitors" had 
not been strong enough to face the trials of the present 
era. On 25 September, Subandrio announced that an opera-
tion to eliminate the "capitalist bureaucrats" was imminent. 
Sukarno probably gave more speeches the last month 
before the coup than he gave in any other month as Presi-
dent. As the time for the coup drew near, he was averaging 
four or five speeches a week. One of the most significant 
was his speech to the PSII Congress in early September, 
in which he spoke of the "five generations of Indonesian 
revolutionaries." Once again, as he had done in his speech 
at the PNI anniversary celebration on 26 July, he publicly 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
identified himself with the 1926 PKI revolt, or what he 
labelled the second generation of Indonesia revolutionaries. 
Historians had always identified Sukarno with the "third 
generation," which formed the nucleus of the PNI, the 
political party that Sukarno founded. There is no evidence 
that he was ever involved with the Communists in the 1926 
revolt. Yet, in his speech to the PSII Congress, Sukarno 
asserted: 
I was always a member of the second generation. 
After the 1926 revolt, when the PKI leaders 
were in jail, they smuggled letters to me, 
urging me to carry on the struggle (against 
the Dutch) . . . . The third generation . . . 
I was never one of them. They were revision-
ists, collaborationists . . . You can't do 
anything gradually. You have to seize power 
by force. 
Sukarno's commitment to the PKI had never been so strong. 
It had reached the point where he was prepared to re-write 
history--to make it look as though he had always been 
committed to the PKI and its espousal of the violent seizure 
of power. His reason for emphasizing the violent seizure 
of power was obviously connected with Indonesia's entry 
into socialism, a theme which he kept emphasizing in his 
speeches all during September. It was clear that he thought 
of Indonesia's entry into the socialist stage as imminent. 
It was not a question of the future. It was now. 
The PKI through its mass media, was giving maximum 
play to Sukarno's every statement during August and Septem-
ber. Under interrogation, PKI Politburo member Sakirman 
later spoke of the propaganda campaign that the PKI mounted 
in the weeks before the coup, which he described as the 
work of "readying the masses" for the coup. 
*According to Sukarno, the five generations were: (1) 
the Sarekat Islam, the nationalist movement in the early 
1920's, (2) the 1926 PKI revolt, (3) the Algemene Studie 
Group, which formed the nucleus of the PNI, with which 
Sukarno is usually identified, (4) the '45 Generation, 
which got independence from the Dutch, and (:) the con-
temporary revolutionary movement.

In waiting for the date for launching the coup, 
party agitation and propaganda was stepped up 
considerably and directed towards the basic 
target, namely, exposing the bureaucratic 
capitalists. There was also propaganda aimed 
at exposing the activities of the Armed Forces 
Leadership. Propaganda was launched in the 
form of rumor campaigns that the generals under 
the leadership of Nasution and Yani were going 
to stage a coup against Sukarno and the cabinet 
and would kick out the leadership of the PKI. 
In an editorial in Harian Rakjat on 4 September, the PKI 
accused the Army of "spreading a campaign that the PKI 
intends to organize a coup, whereas in fact they are the 
ones preparing for a coup. The baby will be born for sure." 
The metaphor of the baby was to appear again in several 
of Aidit's speeches during September, for instance his 
speech to a meeting of women volunteers of the Ministry 
of Information on 9 September. 
We struggle for something that must be born, 
and we, the revolutionaries, are.the midwives 
of a child of the new society. The child will 
definitely be born, and we, the revolutionaries, 
are taking care that it is safely delivered 
and will quickly grow up. 
It seems that Aidit was alluding to the "birth- of socialism 
in Indonesia; the "new baby" was the "new socialist society' 
that was soon to be proclaimed; the 30 September Movement 
would guarantee the "safe delivery" of the "baby." At the 
time, the meaning of the metaphor was not exactly clear. 
The "baby" was generally interpreted to mean the "fifth 
force." In hindsight, however, it seems clear that Aidit 
was thinking:in much broader terms than just the "fifth 
-244-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
force." He was apparently alluding to something that 
Sukarno was being much more explicit about in his speeches 
at the time--namely, Indonesia's entry into the socialist 
stage.* 
Around mid-September, Aidit and the PKI began to make 
allusions in public to the event that would signal Indonesia's 
entry into the spcialist stage; namely, the 30 September 
Movement. It was not clear at the time, of course, but it 
seems clear now that this was the event that was thought of 
as guaranteeing the "safe delivery of the child"--in the 
esoteric language of the PKI. In the following remarks 
addressed to a meeting of the National Council of the All-
Indonesia Federation of Labor Organizations (SOBSI) on 
15 September, there seems to be no question but that Aidit 
was referring to the coup, which was already well into 
the planning stage: 
The most important thing now is the manner in 
which we can excise the cancer, i.e., the 
'city aevils' from tie society's body. 
If we wish our Revolution to develop healthily, 
we must eliminate the economic dynasty, bureau-
cratism, and 'city devils' from the whole 
political and economic state machinery. 
*On 30 September, only hours before the coup, PKI leader 
Anwar Sanusi addressed a meeting of the State Bank of Indo-
nesia; in the course of his speech, he used the same metaphor 
of the "baby" that Aidit used in his speech on 9 September: 
We are now in the situation where our country 
is expecting a child. The midwife is ready with 
all her instruments necessary for the safe 
delivery of the child, which was expected for 
a long time . . . There is a handful of 'devils' 
who thneaten the safety of the country and the 
child to be born. The midwife, therefore, first 
should drive these devils away. 
-215-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Regional organizations are ready to launch 
an attack against the 'city devils'. 
On 27 September, Aidit addressed a meeting of the Associa-
tion of Indonesian Students (IPPI): 
We shall not surrender our fate to the 
'city devils,' but will crush and defeat 
them. 
On the 30th, an editorial in Harian Rakjat was more ex-
plicit in calling for the execution of the 'city devils': 
Embezzling the country's wealth, the 'city 
devils' have evil political intentions towards 
the Government and the revolution. They should 
be publicly executed. The question is only 
to implement it. The just demands of the 
people will certainly be successful. 
In his last public speech before the coup, Aidit said that 
"Communist students should be daring to think and daring 
to act. Act, act. act. Act daringly, daringly, and once 
more daringly." The next day, as the coup forces were 
preparing to act that very evening, Anwar Sanusi made the 
last PKI public statement before the coup: 
We are now in the situation where our country 
is expecting a child. The midwife is ready 
with all her instruments necessary for the 
safe delivery of the child, which was expected 
for a long time. 
During those last weeks in September, both Aidit 
and Sukarno conveyed a great sense of urgency. One or 
the other was speaking almost every day, it seemed. .There 
was a feeling of suppressed excitement in all their speecn-
es. From their speeches and from the press and from 
the many posters that were being put up all over the city 
one definitely got the feeling that something important 
was about to happen--although no one seemed to know just 
what. One could sense the tension in the atmosphere. 
-246-

The mood in Djakarta could probably best be described 
as one of nervous expectation. 
In hindsight, it seems more than a coincidence that 
so many non-communist officials were away from Djakarta 
at the time of the coup.* Either Sukarno or Subandrio 
could easily have arranged for the many Indonesian 
delegations to be-out of town on official business. 
*At the time of the coup, there were no fewer than 12 
different Indonesian delegations in Communist China. The 
four most important and by far the largest were: (1) a 
delegation of the Indonesian Provisional People's Consul-
tative Congress (MPRS), which was comprised of Chaerul 
Saleh, the Chairman of the MPRS, and Ali Sastroamidjojo 
and Wilujo Puspojudo, vice chairmen of the MPRS, and a 
score of other government ministers including Surjadi, 
the Minister of the State Budget, A. Sukendro, Minister 
of State, and M. Jusuf, Minister of Light Industry; (2) a 
58-member delegation of the Indonesian National Defense 
Institute, led by Major Gen. Wilujo Puspojudo, President 
of the Indonesian National Defense Institute; (3) a 61-
member delegation of the Air Force Staff Academy led by 
Air Commodore Sri Bimo Ariotedjo; and a small delegation 
of the Indonesian Cooperation Parliament led by Subamia 
Deputy Speaker. All four delegations were received by 
Mao on 30 September; that evening, the MPRS delegation had 
a farewell banquet. It appears that the delegation may 
have been planning to leave Peking just about the time 
that the news of the coup in Indonesia was received in 
China. Chou En-lai is reported to have broken the news 
to Chaerul Saleh and Ali Sastroamidjojo and Wilujo Puspo-
judo on the morning of 1 October. The MPRS delegation 
may have been uncertain what to do under the circumstances. 
It stayed in Peking another three days before leaving on 
a tour of south China, arriving home on 7 October. 
Besides an official delegation from the PKI, there 
were at least six other leftist delegations from Indonesia 
invited to attend China's National Day celebrations on 1 
October. There was a 3-member delegation of the Indonesian 
Antara News Agency, a 4-member delegation of the All-Indo-
nesian Central Organ of Trade Unions, a 14-member delega-
tion of the Indonesian Journalists' Association, a 9-mem-
ber delegation of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, 
(footnote continued on page 248) 
-247-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
In the situation of having an unprecedented number 
of non-Communist government cfficials absent from the coun-
try, there was the equally unusual situation of having 
all the important PKI leaders in Indonesia,* a very unusual 
situation considering their regular and frequent travel 
to China, the USSR, and other places. Aidit himself had 
refused an invitation to attend Communist China's National 
Day celebrations on 1 October. Normally, one would- have 
expected the PKI to send an impressive delegation, includ-
ing someone with Politburo rank. On this occasion, however, 
(footnote continued from page 247) 
a 4-member delegation of the Indonesian Scientists' Associa-
tion,-and a small Indonesian Moslem delegation. There was 
also a 3-member delegation from the Indonesian Party (Par-
tindo) led by Hadji Winoto Danuasmere, Chairman of the 
Central Committee of the party and a 7-member higher educa-
tion delegation led by Sharif Thajeb, Minister of Higher 
Education, who arrived in Peking on 30 September. 
As one can see, there were a large number of Indonesian 
cabinet ministers in Communist China on the day of the 
-coup. � Deputy Prime Minister Subandrio had not left the 
country but he had conveniently arranged to be out of 
Djakarta. Together with 12 other cabinet ministers, he 
had left on a tour of Sumatra on 29-September. On 25 
September, when the official announcement of his planned 
visit to Sumatra was made, it seemed that Subandrio was 
at pains to give specific reasons for his trip and to point 
out that his visit to Sumatra had been ordered by President 
Sukarno. It had not been normal practice in the past for 
Ministers at Subandrio's level to go into a long explana-
tion of the reason for making a routine visit anywhere in 
Indonesia. It was almost as if Subandrio was preparing 
an alibi for himself. 
*The one notable exception was Adjitorop, who had been 
in Communist China most of the summer and early fall of 
1965. He is still in China, having chosen not to go back 
to Indonesia after the coup. 
-248-

Aidit sent a 10-man delegation, the highest-ranking mem-
ber of which was Sidik Kertapati, a not very well known 
member of the Central Committee. It is almost an obvious 
conclusion that Aidit was influenced by considerations 
arising from the coup in wanting to have all the Politburo 
members in Indonesia around the end of September.* 
There were two people who actually had plans to 
be out of the country in September who changed those plans 
to remain in Indonesia. One was Aidit and the other was 
Sukarno. Aidit had been expected to leave with Chaerul 
Saleh and the MPRS group which arrived in China on 27 
September. At the last moment, as the delegation was 
boarding the plane for China, Aidit announced at the air-
port that he was not going. 
President Sukarno had made plans to travel to 
Vienna in early September for a medical check-up, after 
his recent illness, by:the Austrian kidney specialist 
Dr. Fellinger, who had treated Sukarno previously. In 
late August, hoWever, Sukarno cancelled his travel plans, 
claiming that internal :political developments would not 
permit him to be absent from the country. The fact that 
he apparently considered it impossible to leave the country 
in September--the month that the planning for the coup 
was done--and the timing of his decision to cancel his 
trip, which coincides with the approximate timing of the 
decision to stage the coup, raise the possibility that 
the coup was somehow tied in with his decision to cancel 
his visit to Vienna. It suggests that the President at 
least knew about the coup plans ahead of time. 
*Presumably, the PKI gave the Chinese some explana-
tion for their sending such a low level delegation to the 
1 October National Day celebration. They could probably 
have come up with a satisfactory explanation without tell-
ing the Chinese about the coup, but it does suggest that 
the Chinese were informed about the coup. There are other 
things that suggest that the Chinese were not informed, 
however, so it should not be taken as conclusive evidence.

The Evidence Against Sukarno  
Certainly, the people involved in the planning of the 
coup were led to believe that the President knew and ap-
proved of the coup planning. As noted earlier, Aidit im-
plied as much when he told the Politburo that "the Presi-
dent would give his approval to the military operations 
(of the coup) as a matter of course." At the third meet-
ing of the coup group on 13 September, it will be remembered 
that Sjam told Untung and the others that "the great lead-
er of the revolution has his own role (in the coup). The 
Bung will later on obtain a separate settlement." Accord-
ing to Latief, everyone presentcbncluded from that "that 
no matter what happened the President would play a role." 
All the military officers involved in the coup seem: to 
have been under the very definite impression that Sukarno 
had given his blessing to the coup. At the trial of former 
first lieutenant Ngadimp, it was brought out that Ngadimp: 
told several persons before the coup "that the idea of the 
Revolutionary Council had been created by Aidit and that 
the President had given it his blessing in the presence 
of Subandrio." Apparently, Ngadimo got his information 
from Untung. He testified in court: 
My activities (on behalf of the coup) began 
after I met with Lt. Col. Untung in front of 
the Tjakrabirawa complex on Djalan Tanah 
Abang II. He told me that there was a Coun-
cil of Generals that was going to stage a 
coup against the Palace and that the Palace 
was going to establish a Revolutionary Coun-
cil to counterbalance the Council of Generals. 
The motive for my activities was that I felt 
proud to be able to serve the President. 
Untung, Latief, Sujono, Dani, and Sjam are all re-
ported to have implicated Sukarno in the planning of the 
coup in the course of their secret interrogation by the 
Army. Under direct questioning by Suharto, Latief is 
reported to have said that "Sukarno gave the coup, in-
cluding the murder of the generals, his support from the 
-250-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
beginning."* As noted previously, Sjam definitely im-
plied that the President had previous knowledge of the 
coup when he answered a question about the President and 
the Revolutionary Council with the retort: "We knew he 
would approve:" Other PKI officials have indicated that 
the PKI definitely expected the President to make a state-
ment in support of the coup. 
We do not have exact information as to what Sujono 
and Dani and others may have told their Army interroga-
tors regarding Sukarno's role in the coup. In the case 
of Dani, there are reliable reports that he gave the Army 
"documents and statements, containing allegations, and 
possibly proof, that the man who gave the order for the 
implementation of the 30 September 1965 coup, including 
the murder of the generals, was President Sukarno himself." 
Except for one letter which Dani is supposed to have 
written to Suharto, in which he reportedly stated that 
"neither he nor any Air Force components inv017ed in the 
30 September affair undertook any actions that were not 
directly ordered by the Supreme Commander (President 
Sukarno) himself," we have no information what these 
"documents and statements" are.** To the surprise of 
*After his capture, Latief was questioned by Suharto 
himself. In the course of the interrogation, which was 
tape-recorded, Latief made the statement quoted above. 
Suharto is reported to have sent Sukarno a copy of the 
tape. He sent it via Brig-Gen. Sutjipto, since Sukarno 
refused to see him personally. 
**In the letter to Suharto, written while he was in 
hiding in Cambodia after the coup, Dani reportedly ex-
pressed a desire to clear himself and the Air Force of 
any taint of complicity in plotting the coup and request-
ed permission to return to Djakarta to stand trial in 
order to exonerate himself and the Air Force. The letter 
indicated that Dan's defense at such a trial would be 
that he acted only on the order of Sukarno. Dani obviously 
did not foresee the possibility that the Army would want 
(footnote continued on page 252) 
-251-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
many people who expected Dani to implicate Sukarno in 
his testimony in court, his trial produced no sensation-
al revelations about the role of Sukarno in the coup. 
The Army obviously intended, at least at that stage in 
its struggle against Sukarno and the PKI, to put the 
blame for the 30 September Movement entirely on the PKI; 
(footnote continued from page 251) 
to preserve some of Sukarno's prestige as the first Presi-
dent and great national leader of Indonesia even while 
it was engaged in destroying him as a political force, 
and consequently would not admit evidence of Sukarno's 
complicity in the coup in court. If the Army had wanted 
to defame Sukarno completely, Dani would have been very 
useful indeed. He was useful to the Army, as it was. 
The Army was able to use him to bring pressure on Sukarno 
by threatening to have Dani tell the whole story of the 
coup. Dani's deal with the Army was nowhere near as 
helpful to him. The line of defense that he had planned 
to use--that he had simply been following orders from 
Sukarno�got him nowhere. It seems that he may have been 
forbidden from mentioning the name of Sukarno in court. 
Without mentioning him by name, it was perfectly clear 
who Dani's defense attorney meant though,. when he asked: 
"Is it just that this man be convicted for following 
orders, while his superior, whoipve the orders, is never 
brought to trial?" 
Suharto is reported to have used Dani's letter of 17 
February 1966 to unite the chiefs of the armed services 
and various key subordinate military units behind him in 
his dealings_with Sukarno. With his position thus further 
strengthened, he was able to bring sufficient pressure 
to bear on the President to obtain the President's dele-
gation of authority on 11 March 1966. 
-252-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the attack on Sukarno would come later and in a much dif-
ferent form.* Not only in Dani's trial but in all the 
others, there seems to have been a deliberate effort to 
stay clear of the subject of Sukarno's involvement in the 
coup. Whenever the testimony of witnesses put the finger 
on Sukarno as having prior knowledge of the coup, this 
was not carried in press accounts of the proceedings.** 
It is worth noting that both the Soviets and the 
Chinese have made private statements that indicate that 
they believe Sukarno vas involved in the planning of th 
Coup. At the 23rd CPSU Congress, there was an official 
report on the Indonesian coup, in which the point 
*In the case of Sukarno, the Army tried to destroy hir 
politically tithout discrediting him completely, a con-
sideration they did not have to worry about in the case 
of the PKI. The public charges that have been made against 
Sukarno concern his activities on the day of the coup and 
his efforts after the coup to nrotect those involved in 
the coup and to restore the political situation to that 
existing before the coup, just as though nothing had hap-
pened. Sukarno's role in the planning of the coun is 
still a sensitive subject, which is not discussed publicly 
in Indonesia. However, very recent information indicates 
that President Suharto may now be prepared to press charges 
against Sukarno for his role in the coup. In ,rid-Novem-
ber 1968, Suharto is reported to have ordered an exhaustive 
interrogation of former President Sukarno prior to bring-
ing him to trial in mid-1969. Presumably, the Army has 
new and very good evidence of Sukarno's involvement in the 
planning of the coup or it would not take this drastic 
and unexpected step. 
**The evidence which came out of the early trials of 
Njono and others which pointed a finger at Sukarno re-
portedly made the President furious. At a private meet-
ing with Suharto at the Palace on 17 February 1966, Sukarno 
ordered that his name be kept out�of all testimony being 
taken.by the special military court trying the leaders 
of the 30 September Movement. Sukarno wanted no repeti-
tion of the incident in which Sujono mentioned Sukarno's 
name in connection with the plans to house and safeguard 
Sukarno, Aidit, and Subandrio at Halim Air Force Base 
during the critical hours of the coup. 
-253 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
was made that the Chinese had apparently urged Aidit to 
seize power on the assumption that Sukarno was dying. 
In their propaganda, the Soviets had encouraged the view 
that the Chinese had instigated the coup; they had not 
admitted PKI involvement, however. They managed to do 
this by quoting either the PKI cover story that the coup 
was simply "an internal Army affair" or later statements 
by the PKI denying any involvement in the coup. 
Reactionary forces (in Indonesia) have in-
tensified their anticommunist campaign on 
the pretext that the PKI was involved in 
the 30 September Movement. The accusation 
was denied by the PKI in a statement issued 
on 7 October. 
(Commentary by a former Soviet 
correspondent in Indonesia 
broadcast over Moscow Radio, 
29 October 1965) 
The second important point that was made in the official 
party report to the CPSU Congress that had not appeared 
in Soviet propaganda concerned Sukarno. 
The problem was further deepened by the fact 
that Sukarno himself knew, prior to the 
crisis, that the Communists were trying to 
seize power and he was not opposed to it. 
Sukarno may have had a deal with the Communist 
Party of China that in exchange for certain 
areas in which to carry out A-bomb tests, 
the Chinese would devise a way of doing away 
with Sukarno's army. Sukarno's line was 
clearly Chinese insofar as foreign policy was 
concerned, but it was also clearly Chinese 
insofar as his attitude to revolution was 
concerned, which was a 'Putsch' ideology. 
The Chinese, in private, have also indicated that 
they believe Sukarno knew and approved of the planning 
for the coup. At least, they have said this to visiting 
Communists from Europe. In public, they have not gone 
so far as the Albanians, who are usually considered to 
-254-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
speak for the Chinese on matters of controversy between 
the USSR and China. A lengthy Zen  i I Popullit article 
of 12 May 1966, analyzing the failings of the PKI, warned 
that the,PKI's error lay in putting "too much faith in 
the political strength of Sukarno...whose authority and 
prestige did not lie on any solid base." The implication 
was that Sukarno had misled the PKI on the coup. Exiled 
leaders of the PKI now living in China, such as Adjitorop. 
have made a similar charge. In a 3 November 1966 speech 
to the Albanian party congress, Adjitorop reviewed his 
party's past mistakes and spelled out the lessons that 
had been learned from the "temporary setback to the 
revolutionary movement." The PKI's fundamental error, 
according to Adjitorop, was that it allowed "the pro-
letariat (the PKI) to assume a position subordinate to 
the national bourgeoisie (Sukarno)." Again, the criti-
cism was made in the context of the coup. 
If we are to admit as evidence the opinion of 
others who are in a much better position to know the 
full story of the Indonesian coup, we must certainly 
say something about the military and other informed 
opinion in Indonesia today. According to the most reli-
able sources, many of the senior military leaders and 
government officials in Indonesia have expressed their 
own personal opinion, in private--which they would never 
admit in public--that Sukarno Was behind the 30 September 
Movement from the beginning. Some attribute he planning 
of the coup to Sukarno; others acknowledge that he at 
least knew and approved of the coup planning. Nasution 
and Suharto have said this in private. So have many, many 
others. About as far as an Indonesian will go in discus-
sing the subject with a foreigner is illustrated in tne 
following conversation between a high Indonesian military 
official and an American reporter in early 1966. The 
Indonesian official is reported to have asked: "Do you 
think Dani would have risked his career if a certain 
-255-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
very high-level person had not been aware of the coup?" 
The American replied: "No. I imagine Subandrio knew." 
The Indonesian said: ."No. Not Subandrio. Someone much 
higher. Do you think Dani would have done it if only 
Subandrio knew?" The Indonesian was obviously implying 
that Sukarno must have given the coup his blessing or 
Dani would never have become involved in it. 
Apparently, the Indonesian government is now con-
sidering bringing Sukarno to trial. The Army must feel 
that it has definite proof of Sukarno's involvement in 
the coup--not just his involvement on the day of the coup 
and afterwards, but his involvement in the planning of 
the coup--to contemplate such a move. In October 1968, 
Sukarno was moved from Bogor, where he had been under 
virtual house arrest, to Djakarta for interrogation by 
the Army. Suharto is reported to have ordered an exhaus-
tive interrogation of Sukarno, prior to bringing him to 
trial in mid-1969. 
No doubt, the Army has a lot more evidence of 
Sukarno's involvement in the coup than it has admitted. 
As far as we know, the only concrete evidence to link 
Sukarno with the planning of the coup consists of (1) a 
secret meeting with Dani on 29 September, eight days 
after Dani reported to the President on the secret mis-
sion he made to Communist China from 16-19 September on 
Sukarno's direct orders, (2) several meetings with Aidit 
the last week in September, and (3) a conversation with 
Brig. Gen. Sugandhi on 30 September. 
It will be remembered that Dani was in China for 
three days in mid-September on a secret mission that only 
Sukarno, Aidit, and Subandrio knew about at the time. 
Although he could have gone to China for a number of 
reasons--such as to arrange for the shipment of Chinese 
-256-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
arms to Indonesia or the purchase of airplanes for the 
Indonesian Air Force or the exchange of information in 
the atomic energy field (all of which were reported to 
have been under discussion by the two governments)--he 
may well have gone in connection with the coup. We 
. simply do not know the real purpose of Dani's trip to 
China. In any case, he reported on the results of his 
trip, first, to Subandrio and, then. to Sukarno on 21 
September. Eight days later, on the morning of 29 
September, he met with the President again, in private. 
The circumstances of tneir meeting leave no doubt that 
it was a matter of great urgency and secrecy. Sukarno 
is reported to have received Dani in his bedroom in the 
palace in Djakarta around 0900 hours, ahead of several 
other important people who had scheduled appointments 
with the President that morning and were waiting to see 
him. Dani had just come from a meeting with General 
Supardjo, who had arrived in Djakarta from West Borneo 
the previous afternoon. Supardjo is reported to have 
given Dani "news from Slam," with whom Supardio had been 
in contact almost as soon as he arrived in Djakarta. 
According to Dani, the "news" concerned "a group within 
the army which was dissatisfied with the Arms, leadership 
and which intended to make some changes." Sukarno is 
reported to have asked Dani to meet with him again at the 
palace in Bogor (where Sukarno normally spent nis week-
ends) the following Sunday, October 3rd, at 1000 hours. 
He was to bring Gen. Supardjo with him. After this brief 
meeting with Sukarno, Dani reportedly hurried from the 
palace to report to Gen. Supardjo -on the conversation 
with the President. It was Dani's second meeting with 
-257-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Supardjo that morning. The next time he was to see 
Supardjo was at Halim on the morning of 1 October.* 
As mentioned earlier, Dani's meeting with Sukarno 
on the morning of 29 September is a very significant meet-
ing in connection with the coup. It would tell us a lot 
about the coup, particularly about Sukarno's and Dani's 
role in it, if we knew exactly what the two men talked 
about when they met together privately in the palace that 
morning. It is probably one of those things about the 
Indonesian coup that we will never know for sure, however. 
It can only be presumed that the meeting was concerned 
with the arrangements for the coup. The timing of it, 
on the morning of 29 September, suggests that Dani was 
actually informing Sukarno of the exact date that had 
been set for the coup. The decision to stage the coup 
on the night of 30 September had just been made the 
night before (on the 28th). According to Dani, he told 
the President "that there was a group within the army 
which was dissatisfied with the Army leadership which 
intended to make some changes." The thing that Sukarno 
must have been waiting to hear--and the thing that Dani 
probably told him--was when "the group within the army 
that was dissatisfied with the army leadership intended 
to make some changes." 
One thing that is clear that Sukarno learned from 
the meeting with Dani was that Supardjo had arrived in 
Djakarta from West Borneo--which was a secret from the 
Army. In his speech of 12 February 1967 indicting Sukarno 
for his role in the coup, General Nasution made quite a 
point --)f the fact that Sukarno was one of the few people 
who knew that Supardjo was in Djakarta. In the Army's 
eyes, Sukarno was definitely guilty of conspiring to keep 
this a secret from the Army. Sukarno must have known 
that Supardjo was away from his command in West Borneo 
*It will be remembered that Supardjo would have had 
absolutely no reason to report to Dani as Minister/Com-
mander of the Air Force, except in connection with the 
coup. As a gBneral in the Army, he would have reported 
to Yani or Suharto or some other commanding officer in 
the Army. 
Approved

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
without the knowledge or permission of his superiors in 
the Army. It seems almost unbelievable that tie should 
not have known the real reason for Supardjo's being in 
Djakarta. Certainly, he does not seem to have expressed 
the least surprise when Dani told him of seeing Supardjo 
that morning. He even made plans to receive Supardjo at 
the palace on 3 October. Obviously. he expected Supzrdjo 
to be in Djakarta for several days. at least until 3 
October. As it is highly unlikely that Supardjo could 
have come to the palace in Boor wit:;out being noticed, 
the fact that Sukarno made pinn to receive him there 
3 October would seem to indica-L.) that he expected Supardjo' 
presence in Djakarta to become known by then. This sug-
gests that he expected the coup to.be a fait accompli by 
then. He could hardly have known this if Dani had not 
told him. After all, the decision on D-Day had only been 
made the night before, by Aidit himself apparently; 
Sukarno could not have learned of it much in advance of 
his meeting with Danl.. It appears that Dani must have 
been the one to communicate Aidit's decision on the tim-
ing of tne coup to the President. In short, Dani's meet-
ing with Sukarno on the morning of 29 September is strong. 
though circumstantial, evidence that Sukarno nad fore-
knowledge of the coup, that he had very precise kuowiedge. 
in fact, of the date that the coup was planneo for. 
There were other ways, of course, that Aidit and 
Sjam could have communicated their decision on the timing 
of the coup to Sukarno, although Dani does seem col have 
been the obvious choice of an intermediary. Of all the 
people directly involved in the coup, he was the only 
one high enough in rank to have ready access to the Presi-
dent who was not openly associated with the PKI. The 
fact of his meeting with Sukarno would not seem in the 
least unusual; there would be no reason to attach any 
particular significance to it. Furthermore, there would 
be no reason to suspect PKI involvement on the part of 
Dani. It would have been out of the question for Sukarno 
to have had any contact with the military officers who 
were to lead the movement, such as General Supardjo or 
Untung, as this would have compromised the President com-
pletely. The same arOment would apply to Sjam and Pono, 
the deep-cover PKI agents who were on the Central Command 
-259-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of the coup. That leaves Aidit. Unquestionably, there 
would have been plenty of opportunity for Aidit to have 
discussed the coup with Sukarno; they saw each other re-
gularly. During that last week in September, they were 
reported to have been together on several occasions. 
Even on those occasions when other people were present, 
there was usually an opportunity for private conversa-
tion. The last time that Aidit saw Sukarno before the 
coup (which was to prove to be the last time that the 
two men saw each other before Aidit's death) was on the 
evening of 29 September when they both addressed a meet-
ing of the national association of university students 
-(the CGMI) at the Sports Stadium in Djakarta. Aidit was 
not scheduled to speak, but Sukarno is reported to have 
closed his speech with the words "Now.We must hear from 
Aidit." In a'.shOrt extemporaneous speech, the PKI chair-
man explained that "the PKI had become great, precisely 
because it dared to act." We will probably never know 
whether Aidit and Sukarno had the opportunity for any 
private communication that evening. 
One thing happened during Sukarno's speech that 
evening that should be mentioned, mainly because of the 
attention it has received in connection with the coup. 
After he had been speaking about five minutes, Sukarno 
quite abruptly left the stage and disappeared from sight. 
Some observers say he seemed to falter. After a period 
of time--and there is disagreement over the length of 
time, with estim4tes ranging from 5 minutes to an hour--
he reappeared and continued to give a normal rousing 
Sukarno speech, It was speculated at the time that he 
had gone into a private room to get an injection or other 
medicine from his accompanying doctor; but there is noth-
ing to substantiate such speculation. The only report 
we have from someone who claims to have seen Sukarno 
during the time that he disappeared from public view 
stated that he was seen conferring with military officers. 
One of the most persistent theories about the coup 
is that it was a premature move on the part of the Com-
munists that was triggered Vy the President's faltering 
during his speech to the CGMI Congress. According to this 
theory, word of Sukarno's "collapse" at the Sports Stadium 
-260-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
was flashed to the Communists. who, acting on the mistaken 
assumption that he was dying, made a hasty decision to 
seize control. fearing otherwise that the army would move 
against the PKI as soon as Sukarno died. In support of 
this theory, it was reported that Aidit was seen leaving 
the Sports Stadium early, almost as soon as he finished 
his speech, presumably, on his way to brief the Politburo 
on the evening's happening. 
In the light of later evidence, this theory simply 
does not stand up. By the evening of 29 September, the 
coup preparations were much too far advanced to have been 
triggered by anything that happened then. There is good 
evidence that the decision to stage the coup had been 
taken at least twenty-four hours earlier. It is unlikely 
that the party would have moved on the assumption that 
Sukarno was dying, anyway. Acting too soon on the belief 
that Sukarno was not going to last long had been fatal 
to many another political group in Indonesia. The Com-
munists would not have been likely to move until they knew 
for sure that the President was in extremis. 
Since Sukarno has not died and there are no signs 
that he suffered a collapse (other than a political one) 
in the immediate postcoup period, there is absolutely 
nothing to substantiate the speculation that he suffered 
a collapse at the CGMI Congress on the night of 29 September. 
What is quite possible is that he was called off the stage, 
either to be given some message or to be asked for instruc-
tions, possibly in connection with the events of the comin 
day. We have no further information as to who the mili-
tary officers he was seen conferring with might have been. 
The possibility must also be 'considered that 'Sukarno 
staged the whole incident to make it look as though he 
had suddenly been taken sick. We know that on the night 
of 29 September. Sjam and Pono were meeting with Untung 
and the other military leaders of the coup. It had already 
been decided by Aidit that the coup would begin the fol-
lowing evening, though as yet the decision had not been 
communicated to the military leaders. Supardjo had been 
-261-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
summoned to Djakarta from West Borneo; everything was in 
readiness�as far as the PKI was concerned. But not as 
far as Untung and Latief were concerned. They were not 
prepared to consider going on with the plans for the coup, 
until the matter of the Cavalry was definitely settled. 
At this point, Sjam and Pono undoubtedly realized that 
there would be no armored support. They were not prepared 
to let this, or any other matter, stand in the way of the 
coup, however, which Aidit had ordered to begin the fol-
lowing night. They would naturally look for some new 
compelling reason to present to the military officers for 
going on with the oup. It may well have occurred to 
_them that if Sukarno were suddenly to be taken sick again, 
they could use this as a pretext for moving immediately 
against the Army, before it could move-against the PKI. 
Assuming that Sukarno.knew of the coup plans, he. tight 
well have cooperated with the PKI in providing this os-
tensible excuse for the PKI to move against the Army. 
Since Sjam's meeting with the military leaders was later 
in the evening than Sukarno's address to the CGMI Con-
gress, Sjam could easily have brought the news of Sukarno's 
faltering in the middle of his speech to the military 
officers. It would have had a dramatic effect on Untung 
and Latief and the others. 
The next day, 30 September, Sukarno had a conver-
sation with Brig. Gen. Sugandhi which, because it is well 
documented, is one of the most convincing pieces of evid-
ence that (1) Sukarno knew in advance that a PKI coup 
would take place, (2) that he was given some understand-
ing of what the coup involved, and (3) that he agreed 
to the plan. In order to appreciate the significance of 
the Sugandhi-Sukarno conversation, it is necessary to know 
something of its background, in the nature of two earlier 
conversations of Gen. Sugandhi on 27 September, one with 
-252-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
PKI Politburo member Sudisman and the other with PKI Chair-
man Aidit. 
On 27 September, Sugandhi had the following con-
versation with Sudisman: 
Sugandhi: Man (abbreviation for Sudisman), 
what is going on with all these 
preparations and digging of wells 
in the villages? 
Sudisman: Why don't you just join us? 
Sugandhi: That is impossible:, Man. I 
cannot possibly join the PKI, 
because I am a religious person. 
Sudisman: If you do not want to, it is 
because you have been listening 
too much to Nasution. 
Sugandhi: No, it is not a matter of listen-
ing too much to him, it is a matter 
of ideology. If you continue 
with your plan, you will be crushed 
and destroyed. 
Sudisman: No, that is impossible. We will 
have the initiative. Whoever 
begins and strikes the first blow 
will win. Have trust in us. We 
have made thorough calculations. 
Shortly afterward, on the same day, Sugandhi had 
this conversation with Aidit: 
Aidit: 
Have you talked with Sudisman. 
We will start in a short time, 
in two or three days. Bung 
Karno [Sukarno] knows all this. 
It would be better for you if 
you join us.

Sugandhi: Sudisman already talked to me, 
but I do not want to join the 
PKI. The PKI wants to stage a 
coup. I have my own doctrine, 
the Soldier's Oath. 
Aidit: Bung, do not say 'coup.' That 
is an evil word. The PKI is 
going to improve the revolution 
which is being subverted by the 
council of generals. We will 
start within two to three days. 
Will you join us or not? I have 
already informed Bung Karno about 
all this. 
Three days later, on 30 September, Sugandhi is 
reported to have had the following conversation with 
Sukarno in the President's bedroom in the palace. 
Sugandhi: The PKI is going to stage a coup. 
Do you know about this? I have 
been contacted by Sudisman and 
Aidit themselves. 
Sukarno: Don't be a communist-phobe. Don't 
you know about the existence of 
the council of generals? Don't you 
know that these generals are hope-
less? Be careful when you talk. 
Sugandhi: If there are hopeless generals, 
why don't you just dismiss them? 
Isn't that your authority? There 
is no council of generals. There 
is a Rank and Post Review Council. 
It is an evaluation council to 
assist the army minister/commander 
to evaluate colonels who are to be 
promoted to generals, and not for 
any other purpose.

Sukarno: 
Sugandhi: 
Sukarno: 
Sugandhi: 
Sukarno: 
Don't you interfere. Shut up. 
you must have been listening too 
much to Nasution. 
It is true, Bapak. There is no 
council of generals. Pak Yani said 
so himself and declared to Bapak 
that there was no Council of 
Generals. Isn't Yani a man who 
is loyal to you, somebody who may 
be called your right hand? . 
Don't talk too much. Don't meddle. 
Don't you know that according to 
Thomas Tonly in a revolution a 
father can eat his own children? 
Don't you know? 
If that is the case, you must have 
joined the PKI. 
Shut up, or I will slap you till 
you faint. Go home, and be careful. 
On the basis of Gen. Sugandhi's reported conversations 
with Sudisman, Aidit, and Sukarno, Nasution stated un-
equivocably, in public, on 13 February 1967 that "the 
President gave the coup his blessing and assistance." He 
cited a 19 January 1967 central investigation team report 
stressing "the importance and the validity of the Sukarno-
Sugandhi conversation of 30 September as proof of the 
President's advance knowledge and involvement in the 30 
September affair."

Conclusions 
Although the Indonesian coup, as it was carried 
out, was in every respect the planning of the PKI, 
other people besides the Communists were involved in the 
plot to eliminate the top Army ),eadership. The evidence 
in the case of all but one or two of the people involved 
in the coup is sufficiently clear-cut to justify a rather 
definite judgment of their respective roles in the coup. 
The most important question about the Indonesian coup 
that remains open to some doubt on the basis of the 
evidence that is available is the question of Sukarno's 
role in the coup. Our judgment of his role and that of 
Subandrio must necessarily remain somewhat tentative, 
until there is more evidence on the subject. 
The PKI -- The central role of the PKI in planning 
the coup has been well established. The evidence is over-
whelming that the PKI made all the major decisions, in-
cluding who would lead the movement, what military units 
would be involved in the operatkon, when the coup would 
take place, how the political campaign in support of the 
coup would be managed, and what changes in the government 
would be made as a result of the coltp. Aidit himself 
made the more important decisions, such as when the coup 
would take place and who would be on the Revolutionary 
Council, which was intended to replace the Dwikora Cabinet. 
Sjam, the chief of the PKI Special Bureau, to whom Aidit 
entrusted the detailed planning for the coup, seems to 
have made most of the other decisions, subject, of course, 
to Aiditts approval. 
After securing Politburo approval for the PKI to 
begin making preparations for a coup in late August 1965, 
Aidit turned the whole matter of the planning and execu-
tion of the coup over to the Special Bureau, the secret 
organization within the PKI that had been established in 
late 1964 to direct PKI covert activities. Apparently, 
only a very few people in the Politburo even knew of the 
existence of the Special Bureau; it is not at all clear 
-266-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
whether anyone besides Aidit knew the identity of the man 
who headed the organization. He had been one of Aidit's 
closest personal friends before Aidit persuaded him to 
join the PKI in 1948. Aidit probably trusted Sjam as much 
or more than any other PKI leader. There is no doubt 
that Sjam's loyalties were, first and foremost, to Aidit. 
In the Special Bureau, with Sjam as its chief, Aidit had, 
in effect, his own special apparatus within the party for 
handling "sensitive matters." Completely free of the 
control of the central committee and the Politburo, the 
Bureau operated as a completely autonomous organization 
within the PKI, answerable only to Aidit. 
According to Sjam, the Special Bureau was "charged 
with the task of preparing for armed struggle," which was 
not the official policy of the PKI at the time. As long 
as things were going well for the PKI under Sukarno's 
protection, Aidit believed that the best policy fort the 
PKI was one of strong ::-.i.nuncia-
tion of force as the way to gain power in Indonesia, and 
the espousal of the peaceful, parliamentary road to "social-
ism." Yet, because he could not definitely rule out the 
possibility of the PKI's having to resort to armed force 
some time in the future, if things suddenly changed for 
the worse, he seems to have been concerned to develop, 
some kind of covert apparatus, distinct from the overt 
apparatus of the party, which could be assigned the task 
of preparing for armed struggle, should that ever become 
necessary. Because of the risks involved in arming and 
training PKI party members--which, if it became known, 
would have vitiated Aidit's whole effort over the years 
to create just the opposite image of the PKI as a. party 
that operated entirely within the legal political system 
of the country--Aidit preferred a policy of PKI infiltra-
tion and subversion of the Indonesian armed forces. 
Rather than train and arm a PKI armed force, pretty much 
from the beginning, the Special Bureau would concentrate 
its efforts on subverting the Indonesian military. 
The extent of PKI penetration of the military waz: 
.-certainly never realized by the army leadership before 
the coup; it clearly came as a surprise and a shock to 
Nasution ard Suharto and the other army generals aftrr 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the coup when they learned about the operations of the 
PKI and the Special Bureau from the confessions of the 
military officers involved in the coup. The extent of 
the penetration was shockingly evident in one fact that 
was revealed--that Sjam himself had acted as a double 
agent in pretending to be an informer for the Djakarta 
Military Command. By the time of the coup, the Special 
Bureau had established a pattern of regular contacts 
with perhaps a hundred or more military officers who, 
because they were well placed in positions of command 
over a much larger number of troops, put the PKI in the 
position of being able to command a sizeable military 
force. Although it could not have hoped to withstand an 
all-out attack from the military, the PKI was in a posi-
tion where it could at least contemplate carrying out 
a limited military operation--such as the kidnapping of 
a number of Army generals and the seizure of a few key 
installations in Djakarta. A practical measure of tile 
military strength of the PKI in late 1965 would actually 
be the 30 September Movement. It seems that all or almost 
all the resources of the Special Bureau were involved in 
the coup. We know that Aidit was concerned to commit the 
maximum number of troops at his disposal to the coup 
action, even to the point of rushing the training of 
some 4,000 Communist volunteers as an auxiliary force. � 
In short, the coup was the supreme military effort that 
the PKI was capable of at the time. 
The Special Bureau was the obvious organization 
within the PKI to plan an action like the 30 September 
Movement. First of all, it had "contacts" in the mili-
tary who could be counted on to carry out the party's 
will in staging a coup. Secondly, and just as important, 
the military officers who were under the control of the 
Special Bureau were not openly identified with the PKI, 
which meant that the role of the PKI in the coup could 
be obscured and the coup made to appear an internal Army 
affair. Aidit seems to have felt strongly that the coup 
should be handled entirely within the Indonesian military. 
Unfortunately for the PKI, a last-minute decision to use 
the Communist volunteers, who had been armed and trained 
by the coup leaders as an auxiliary force, compromised 
-Aidit's and Sjam's planning to avoid direct PKI involvement 
-268-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
in the coup. It was never intended that these volunteers 
play a role in the military operation of the coup; they 
were thought of as a "reserve force" in the defense of 
Halim Air Force Base, which was selected to serve as the 
command center for the coup. However, in the late hours 
of the coup, when the coup was all but lost, they were 
sent into Djakarta in a last desperate move by the coup 
leaders. They staged a dramatic--but pointless and totally 
disorganized--entry into Djakarta, only to be promptly 
disarmed by Suharto's forces. Except for the presence 
of these armed Communist volunteers and the failure of 
the PKI to stop publication of an editorial, which had 
obviously been written in advance of the coup for publi-
cation the morning after the coup, the PKI might well 
have concealed its involvement in the coup, at least at 
the time. As it was, the arrival of armed Communist ele-
ments on the scene in the late hours of the coup created 
the false impression that armed Communist civiliansLhad 
been involved in the raids on the generals' homes, a 
false impression that contributed significantly to the 
immediate, violent reaction against the PKI. The 2 October 
Harlan Rakjat editorial endorsing the coup was another 
disaster for the PKI; it provided the documentary justi-
fication for the PKI's own obliteration after the coup. 
As for the PKI, the fact that it got others to 
execute the deed does not change the fact that it was in 
every way responsible for the planning of the Indonesian 
coup. After the coup, Aidit was attacked by the militant 
wing of the surviving PKI organization for having bypassed 
the PKI party organization in his planning of the coup. 
This is not completely true, in that he got Politburo 
approval for the PKI to begin making plans for a coup 
and top party leaders were given specific roles to play 
in the coup--for instance, Njono, the Chief of the Greater 
Djakarta Committee of the PKI, was in charge of the 
"operational-technical" preparations for the coup, includ-
ing the recruiting of the PKI volunteer troops, and Lnkman, 
Sakirman, Pardede, Sanusi, and Narsukud were given the 
assignment of coordinating party activities in different 
parts of the country after the coup. Because of the need 
for secrecy, even these top officials of the PKI were not 
briefed on their assignments more than a day or so in 
-269-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
advance of the coup. Except for these top leaders, the 
PKI as an organization was not informed about the coup 
ahead of time. In this sense, Aidit's critics within the 
party were right in accusing him of bypassing the party. 
The coup was essentially an operation of the Special 
Bureau. The PKI was no less responsible because the 
Special Bureau planned the coup, of course, than it would 
have been if the overt party organization had managed the 
whole affair. 
The military leaders: Untung, Sujono, Latief,  
and Supardjo -- The military was only the executive arm 
of a coup that was masterminded by the PKI. Untung and 
the other military leaders were little more than dupes 
of the PKI. Long accustomed to following the PKI line 
on political matters, they were easily convinced by the 
PKI of the necessity of taking action against the Army 
leadership. 
None of the military leaders of the coup were 
Communist, in the sense of being Communist party members. 
Some were known to be pro-Communist; a few, like Untung, 
had openly supported Communist causes in the past. But, 
in the main, they were not known for their political 
views; most often, they were described as "apolitical" 
or "politically naive." They seemed much more interested 
in their military careers than in politics, and, in every 
case, they had promising careers ahead of them. Untung 
was actually something of a national hero after the West 
Irian Campaign; te had been decorated by President Sukarno 
himself. In 1965, his career was definitely on the way 
up, after the temporary setback it had suffered as a re-
sult of his involvement in the Communist uprising of 1948. 
Only a few months before the coup he had been promoted 
from Battalion Commander in the Central Java Division of 
the Army to Commander of the 1st Battalion of the Tjak-
rabirawa Honor Guard that guarded the President. 
The military leaders of the coup do not seem to 
have been personally acquainted with one another before 
September 1965. They had one thing in common, however, 
.that was to bring them together in a fateful alliance. 
For some time each had been having regular contacts with 
-270-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
highly-placed PKI agents. In the case of Untung, his 
PKI contact was a man called Walujo; in the case of 
Latief and Sujono, it was a certain Pono; in the case 
of Supardjo, it was Sjam himself. Although Untung and 
the other military leaders did not know the true identit-
ties of the men they called Sjam, Pono, and Walujo and 
certainly did not appreciate the fact that they were the 
three top men in the PKI Special Bureau, they all seem 
to have accepted the fact that they spoke for the PKI. 
Actually, they seem to have had some idea that they re-
presented Aidit personally. 
Untung, Sujono, and Latief were introduced to one 
another by Sjam and Pono at a meeting on 6 September 1965. 
During the month of September, the group of five men met 
together a total of eight times, usually late at night 
at the homes of either Col. Latief or Sjam. The planning 
for the Indonesian coup was started and finished ii the 
one month of September, in the course of these eight meet-
ings. 
Sjam presided at every meeting. There is no ques-
tion that he was always in charge. At the early meetings, 
he presented the PKI's analysis of the political situa-
tion and cited the need for action. The military leaders 
seem to have accepted his word on the existence of a Gen-
erals' Council in the Army and its alleged planning for 
a coup to overthrow Sukarno. Convinced that they were 
acting to protect Sukarno, they allowed themselves to be 
used by the PKI in carrying out a coup of the PKI's making. 
As the month wore on and the discussions centered more 
and more on the military planning for the coup, Sjam re-
treated somewhat from the center of the stage and allowed 
the military officers to make some of the purely military 
decisions--in preparation for the final moment, when he 
would withdraw altogether to the sidelines and leave the 
military leaders to face the shock of the coup. 
During the course of the meetings, Sjam had men-
tioned that one other person would be joining the coup 
group at a later date. He was Gen. Supardjo, Commander 
of the 4th Combat Command in West Borneo. The reason 
that Supardjo became involved in the coup was precisely 
-271-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the same reason that Untung, Latief, Sujono, and the 
others became involved; he was a PKI sympathizer who was 
being 'managed" by the Special Bureau and could be counted 
on to carry out the will of the party. Supardjo was 
actually the prize "asset" of the PKI in the Indonesian 
military. Probably because of his rank, he was personally 
"managed" by the chief of the PKI Special Bureau--Sjam 
himself. He was in and out of Djakarta often enough, 
in connection with his assignment as Commander of the 
4th Combat Command, that he could have managed to see 
Sjam fairly regularly. Presumably, he was kept informed 
of the coup planning during those last weeks before the 
coup when he was still in West Borneo. On 28 September 
he received a prearranged signal that he should come to 
Djakarta immediately; he arrived late in the afternoon 
that same day and went immediately to Sjam's house. During 
theinext two days, he was actively involved in all the 
last-minute preparations for the coup. He joined thet. 
other military leaders at the last meeting of the coup 
group on 29 September. On the day of the coup, he acted 
as the chief liaison between the coup leaders and Presi-
dent Sukarno. 
Dani -- Omar Dani, the Minister/Commander of the 
Air Force, who was obviously involved along with the Com-
munists in the plot to eliminate the top Army leadership, 
is a special case among the military officers who were 
involved in the coup. Like Untung and the others, he had 
for some time been having secret contacts with representa-
tives of the PKI Special Bureau. His contact man was 
Walujo, the same man who "managed" Untung and Gen. Pranoto, 
the latter of whom Sukarno appointed "caretaker" commander 
of the Army, vice Gen. Yani, who was one of the victims 
of the coup. As Commander of the Air Force, Dani �was the 
highest-placed "contact" of the PKI in the military. He 
was far too senior to be considered in the same group 
with Untung and Lntief, or even Supardjo. He never met 
together with them in the planning sessions for the coup. 
Thus, he was not a member of the so-called Central Command 
of the coup, as the five-man group (plus Supardjo) was 
called. 
-272-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 000186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Although he had assumed an increasingly leftist 
position after 1962, when he was appointed Minister/Com-
mander of the Air Force, Dani was not a Communist. It 
would not even be accurate to describe him as of leftist 
conviction. Apparently he had no strong political con- � 
victions of his own. After a year of pilot training at 
Bakersfield in California during 1950-51, he was regarded 
as an anti-Communist with a strongly expressed preference 
for U.S. technology and equipment over Soviet technology. 
Yet-, within a few years, he was espousing the Communist 
line and setting up Marxism study courses within the Air 
Force. Dani was, above all else, an opportunist, as 
Ruth McVey described him, "a man out for the main chance... 
which he perceived not unbrightly to lie with Sukarno 
and the PKI." Slim, handsome, sporting a clipped mustache 
and wearing his cap at a dashing angle, he looked more 
like the matinee idol than the air force chief. He was 
vain, ambitious, completely pliable, and, most of all, 
susceptible to flattery. Needless to say, he did not 
lack for the latter from the Communists. They knew well 
how'to exploit an ambitious man like Dani. 
It was to Sukarno, not the Communists, that Dnni 
owed his appointment as Commander of the Air Force. He 
had been hand-picked by the President to lead the Air 
Force in 1962, when the former Commander of the Air Force 
was r9lieved, under pressure from the Army and Navy, for 
supposed Air Force "negligence" in an incident involving 
the death of a Navy Admiral. The succession of Dani to 
the post of Air Force Commander scarcely improved the 
situation from the point of view of the Army and Navy. 
Although intelligent' and well trained for the operational 
leadership of the Air Force, Dani was obviously given the 
job for other reasons. With his weak character and lack 
of a strong personal following in the Air Force, he would 
be totally dependent on the President for his position 
and therefore amenable to Sukarno's wishes. Under 
his leadership, the Air Force made a series of advances 
to the "left," always on Sukarno's initiative. At the 
time of the coup, it was the only one of the four services 
that was prepared to accept the idea of Nasakom Councils 
within the Armed Forces; it was giving strong public approval 
to the idea of the fifth force, at a time when both the 
-273-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Army and the Navy were fighting it determinedly. The 
contrast between the Army and Navy's reaction to Presi-
dential pushing on these matters and Dani's ready acquiesc-
ence on all matters could hardly have been more striking. 
It was no secret that Nasution and Yani and the other Army 
leaders had little use for Dani, but that mattered little 
to Dani so long as he had the backing and protection of 
Sukarno. He was receiving all that he wanted--in the way 
of a gorgeous lakeside home, luxury automobiles, and 
access to the palace social life--from Sukarno. Certainly, 
Sukarno was happy with Danl.. He referred to the Air Force, 
under Dani's leadership. as "his sweetheart." 
It is true that the Air Force had some reason to 
be jealous of the Army, which got nearly two-thirds of 
the annual military budget while the Air Force ranked 
last among the four services in receiving less than 10% 
of all military expenditures. Apparently, the Air Force 
considered itself discriminated against in the matter of 
promotions, as well as the allocation of foreign aid. 
Many of its officers are reported to have resented the 
superior position and prestige of the army. However, 
Dani himself, as we have seen, had no personal cause for 
grievance along these lines. It is highly unlikely that 
he would have joined a conspiracy against the Army generals 
because of inter-service rivalry of this kind. Nor is 
it likely that he would have acted out of any strong poli-
tical mdtivation of his own. There would seem to be only 
one good reason why Dani would have become involved in 
anything as dangerous as a coup--namely, that he kLe.., tha' 
Sukarno knew and approved of the coup plans. It wouA 
have been totally out of character for him to have risked 
his life and his career, otherwise. As long as the coup 
had Sukarno's blessing, there was no risk for him. In 
fact, not to have supported the coup, in those circumst-
ances, would have been more risky. Dani's involvement 
in the coup, as much as anything else, argues for Sukarno's 
having been involved; it is one of the most convincing 
reasons for thinking that Sukarno must have known and ap-
proved of the coup plans. Dani was not someone who would 
in any event have been expected to act without the Presi-
dent. 
-274-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Whereas it can be argued that the PKI could easily 
have convinced Untung and Latief and the other military 
leaders of the coup that Sukarno knew about the coup plans,, 
whether he did or not. Dani is not likely to have taken 
anyone's word--either Sjam's or Aidit's--when he could 
so easily have checked the matter out with Sukarno him-
self. He was in constant contact with Sukarno all during 
the period just before the coup. In fact, he seems to 
have been in the very select company of Subandrio and 
Aidit as one of Sukarno's most trusted confidants. Only 
two weeks before the coup, he made a secret trip to Com-
munist China on the direct orders of Sukarno. Besides 
the President and Dani, only two other people in the In-
donesian government knew about Dani's secret mission 
--Subandrio and Aidit. Although he could have gone to 
China for a number of reasons, the timing of the trip 
suggests that it was in connection with the coup. Appar-
ently, Sukarno was in the process of negotiating a secret 
arms deal with the Chinese. Assuming that he knew about 
the coup planning, he may have sent Dani to China to ar-
range for an immediate shipment of arms, with the thought 
that they would be used in the coup. (This is not to sug-
gest that he informed the Chinese of his reason for want-
ing the arms immediately.) It is interesting to note that 
soon after he returned to Indonesia, Dani had a meeting 
with Air Force Major Sujono, who was deeply involved in 
the soup planning; among other things, he was in charge 
of the secret military training that the Air Force was 
giving the Communist volunteers at Lubang Buaja. On the 
day of the coup, it was Sujono who procured the arms from 
the Air Force depots; they happened to be Chinese arms. 
Dani is implicated in the planning of the coup by 
one other important piece of evidence. On the morning of 
29 September, he is known to have conferred with Gen. 
Supardjo, one of the PKI's contacts in the military who 
was to play a major role in the coup. Actually, he saw 
Supardjo twice that morning, once before and once after 
he talked with Sukarno. Supardjo is reported to have given 
Dani "news from Sjam." After the meeting with Supardjo, 
Dani went to the palace, where he conferred in private 
with the President for several minutes. The circumstances 
of the meeting leave no doubt that it was a matter of 
-275-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
great urgency and secrecy. After this brief meeting with 
Sukarno, Dani hurried from the palace to report to Gen.. 
Supardjo on the conversation with the President. We know 
that the decision to stage the coup on the night of 30 
September was taken by Aidit on the night of the 28th, 
the very evening before Sjam told Supardjo the news that 
Supardjo obviously thought important enough to tell Dani 
right away and Dani felt obliged to tell Sukarno immediately. 
It appears that Dani must have been the one to communicate 
Aidite_s decision on the timing of the coup to Sukarno. 
Although there were other ways that Aidit and Sjam could 
have communicated with the President, Dani does seem to 
have been the obvious choice of an intermediary. Of all 
the people directly involved in the coup, he was the only 
one high enough in rank to have ready access to the Presi-
dent who was not openly associated with the PKI. 
Dani's actions on the day of the coup leave abso-
lutely no doubt that he had foreknowledge of the event and 
lent it his full support from the beginning. He left his 
home soon after midnight on the night of the 30th to go to 
Halim Air Force Base, where arrangements had already been 
made for his and Aidit's "safe protection" during the 
critical hours of the coup. He was at the Operations 
Command Center there when Sukarno arrived the next morn-
ing and was the first to report to the President on the 
progress. of the coup. Early in the morning, he drafted 
an orderiof-the-day pledging the support of the air force 
to the coup. With the broadcast of the order later that 
day, Dani's fate was all but sealed. His complicity in 
the coup, like that of the PKI, was now documented. He 
could never hope to disclaim any involvement in the coup, 
as Sukarno was to leave himself the option of doing. 
Subandrio--- Subandrio's role in the coup is, in 
many respects, the most surprising and the most difficult 
to explain. It seems that he definitely knew about 
the coup planning, that he had precise knowledge, in fact, 
of the details of the planning such as when the coup would 
take place. However, he does not seem to have been in-
volved in the actual planning and he was not even in Djakarta 
on the day of the coup to participate in the events of 
the coup.

Apparently, the military leaders of the coup got 
the definite impression from Sjam that Sukarno, Subandrio, 
and Dani all knew about the coup planning. There is goo0 
reason to thihk that Subandrio did. First of all, we knOw 
that he knew about Dani's secret trip to China in mid-
September, which is presumed to have involved the prepara-
tions for the coup. After the coup, Gen. Sukendro remembered 
a discussion he had with Subandrio on 17 September which, 
in hindsight, convinced him that Subandrio knew about the 
coup.- Subandrio asked his opinion of a number of top 
Indonesian army generals, most of whom were later killed 
in the coup. Subandrio said that he thought all these 
generals were much too'interested in politics and could 
no longer be relied upon as good army officers. He des-
cribed only one general--Gen. Mursjid--as a general who 
"did his job as a military man and didn't get involved in 
politics." Gen. Mursjid was not a victim of the coup. 
On the morning of 29 September, the same morning 
that Dani saw Sukarno on a matter of great urgency, which 
is thought to have been the occasion of Dani's telling 
Sukarno of Aidit's decision on the timing of the coup, 
Aidit is reported to have met with Subandrio. There is 
no information as to what was discussed, but it is a good 
bet that Aidit told Subandrio of the final decision he had 
made the night before to stage the coup on the 30th. After 
his meeting with Aidit, Subandrio is reported to have be-
come ve/J31 busy, meeting with several other cabinet ministers. 
Later that day, he left on a speaking tour of North Sumatra. 
When the official announcement of his planned visit 
to Sumatra was made on 25 September, it seemed that Suban-
drio was at pains to give specific reasons for his trip 
and to point out that it had been ordered by President 
Sukarno. It had not been normal practice in the past for 
ministers at Subandrio's level to go into a long expana-
tion of the reasons for making a routine visit anywhere 
in Indonesia; it was almost as if Subandrio was preparing 
an alibi. 
Just why Subandrio, who obviously knew about the 
coup plans, should have planned to be away from Djakarta 
on the day of the coup is not exactly clear. One somehow 
-277-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
gets the feeling that he was not as enthusiastic about 
the idea of the coup or perhaps not as confident of its 
success as Aidit, and presumably Sukarno. Certainly, 
Subandrio was a much more cautious man, by nature, than 
Sukarno; he may well have had some premonition that the 
coup might fail. Aside from its chances for success, he 
may not have been altogether happy about the whole idea 
of eliminating the top leadership of the Army, which 
represented the main balanting.force to the PKI. He 
didn't have tie backing of any political party, the way 
Sukarno had the PNI, Aidit had the PKI, and Nasution and 
Yani had the Army. is power derived solely from Sukarno. 
He may well have figured that his own power position was 
better served by a continuation Of the status quo than by 
any sudden upset of the balance between the PKI and the 
Army, which the coup would have accomplished, in favor of 
the PKI. 
In any case, Subandrio was obviously not considered 
essential to the coup plans, apparently either by Sukarno 
or the PKI. One would not have expected the PKI to give 
Subandrio a majorrole to play in any coup of PKI making. 
He was, after all, Aidit's chief rival for influence with 
Sukarno and a major contender for power after Sukarno. The 
PKI could hardly exert the control over him that it could 
over Dani and the other military leaders involved in the 
coup. 
1 
As for Sukarno's feelings about Subandrio's par-
ticipation in the coup, assuming of course that the Presi-
dent knew about the coup plans, it should be mentioned 
that Subandrio's stock with the President was reported to 
be at a low ebb during the summer and fall of 1965, as 
a result of the Afro-Asian Conference fiasco. Apparently, 
Subandrio's intelligence organization had painted A glow-
ing picture of the prospects of the Afro-Asian Copierence, 
from Indonesia's point of view, particularly th9..prospects 
for Indonesia's keeping Malaysia out of the conference 
and the prospects for Indonesia's emerging as one of the 
leading nations at the conference. After the postpone-
ment of the conference, Sukarno was reported to be very 
unhappy about the poor intelligence assessment he had 
hePn c:ivn. There were r.lther t!.-i hn1:1Z" hc,(:mtri;

Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
his own power base. Whatever truth there may have been 
to these reports, Sukarno was obviously anxious to have 
the benefit of Subandrio's counsel when things suddenly 
began to go badly for the coup on the afternoon of 1 
October. He sent an urgent message to Subandrio: "Objec-
tive not achieved. Return immediately." He even sent his 
Presidential plane to Medan to bring Subandrio home. 
Subandrio had not seemed in the least surprised 
when he first received the news of the coup on 1 October. 
According to a member in his entourage, he acted "as if 
nothing had happened." Obviously, he was in no hurry to 
return to Djakarta. He was quoted as saying that "nothing 
urgent" called him, so he would "wait to see how events 
turned out." He manifested no particular worry or anxiety. 
In response to Sukarno's urgent summons home, he calmly 
decided to continue his tour of Sumatra. On 2 October, 
he is reported to have received a message from Deputy 
Prime Minister Leimena also requesting him to return to 
Djakarta. Again, he is reported to have commented: "Why 
must I go? Let Leimena settle this mess himself: The 
President is still there." Finally, on 3 October, he 
returned to Djakarta, going straight from the airport to 
Bogor to see the President. 
At his trial, Subandrio repeatedly stated his in-
nocence of any complicity in the coup. The trial certainly 
cannot be said to have established his guilt. He was con-
victed of other crimes against the state, having nothing 
to do with the coup. Thus, his involvement in the coup 
must be considered unproven. It seems clear that he knew 
about the planning for the coup, but he does not seem to 
have played any part, either in its planning or execution. 
In fact, he seems to have taken great pains to avoid be-
coming involved, no doubt because he knew that it would be 
assumed that he had been involved and he seems to have had 
some fears that it might not succeed. 
Sukarno -- Probably the most crucial question about 
the Indonesian coup concerns the role of Sukarno in the 
coup. It is one question about which there will probably 
always be a certain amount of doubt. But it has always 
been the history of conspiracies, especially those 
-279-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
involving persons in high office, that certain facts have 
never been known for sure. The Indonesian coup is no 
exception. 
It is quite clear, first of all, that Sukarno's 
sympathies were with the coup, if only from his actions 
after the coup. Everything that he did or said after the 
coup was in the interest of quieting the national furor 
raised over the generals' deaths, protecting those in-
volved in the coup, and restoring the political situation 
to that existing before the coup. In the years since the 
coup, Sukarno has never sought to change the initial im-
pression that he gave of his attitude towards the coup. 
He has never said that the coup was counter-revolution-
ary; in fact, he has never suggested that the 30 September 
Movement was carrying out a coup at all. Although the 
guilt of the PKI in planning the coup has long since been 
established, he has refused to place the blame on the PKI. 
For many months after the coup, he tried to resist the 
efforts to crush the PKI, which he continued to praise 
as the party that had suffered the most casualities and 
displayed the most merit in the Indonesian revolution. 
From his actions on the day of the coup it seems 
clear that Sukarno at least knew about the coup plans 
ahead of time. There is the well established fact that he 
left a note for his wife Devi when he left her home early 
on the illorning of the coup. He had already left Devi's 
house and was on his way to the palace when he was first 
notified by the Tjakrabirawa Palace Guard of the attack 
on the generals' homes. He would have had no way of know-
ing of the coup events before he left, unless he had prior 
knowledge of the coup. In the note, he explained that 
"the men who were carrying out this so-called revolution 
intended to safeguard Bapak (Sukarno) and did not intend 
to oppose him." He assured Devi that "Bapak was safe." 
Sukarno does not seem to have been either shocked 
or surprised by the news of the coup. He is not known 
to have asked any questions about the kidnapping of the 
generals, a most abnormal reaction to hearing such news 
for the first time. The only thing that seemed to interest 
_ 0 _ 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
him was the report that Gen. Nasution had escaped. He 
was obviously very much concerned to learn the truth 
about Nasution. His first comment upon hearing of Nasu-
tion's escape had been: "This comes as an absolute sur-
prise. What will you do with me?" Sukarno was not in 
the habit of asking other people "What will you do with 
me?" It suggests that he suddenly felt very much on the 
defensive, as though he %assumed that the Army would know 
that he had been involved in the generals' kidnapping. 
It-could hardly have been a coincidence that Sukarno 
decided to go to Halim Air Force Base, which was serving 
as the coup headquarters. We know that the coup leaders 
were expecting him to arrive there around 0800-0900 hours; 
Sujono had made arrangements for the President to spend 
the day at Commodore Susanto's house on the airbase. 
Sukarno did not disappoint them. He arrived there around 
0930 hours--at his own initiative and of his own free will. 
He spent the entire day of the coup at Halim, along with 
Aidit and Dani and Untung and Sjam and the others. Al-
though he did not see Aidit or Sjam or Untung, who were 
at different locations on the airbase, he conferred often 
with Supardjo, who acted as courier between Aidit and the 
Central Command and Sukarno and Dani. He was with Dani at 
the Operations Command Center all morning; in the afternoon, 
he was at Commodore Susanto's house, where he is reported 
to haNe spent most of the afternoon "resting and sleeping," 
amazing as that might seem under the circumstances. He 
did not leave the airbase until late in the evening, after 
all hope for the coup was gone. 
In no sense was Sukarno a prisoner of the coup group 
while he was at Halim. On the contrary, he seems to have 
been very much his own free agent from the time that he 
went to Halim at his own initiative to the moment that:he 
decided to leave for Bogor. His complete independence of 
action was clear from the fact that he sent his own emis-
saries back and forth from Halim into Djakarta all day long. 
He was also free to use the coup-controlled radio to broad-
cast a Presidential statement to the nation. 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
The success of the whole coup depended on the public 
statement that Sukarno was expected to make. There is abso-
lutely no question that the coup leaders fully expected the - 
President to make a statement in support of the coup. His 
endorsement of the coup was the one strategic calculation 
that made sense of the coup. The military odds against the 
success of Untung's move on 1 October were overwhelming. 
Aidit, with his relatively good sense of the military, would 
never have risked such odds. Clearly, the President was 
the essential factor in the calculation; his endorsement 
would have been enough to guarantee the success of the coup. 
If the coup leaders made one serious miscalculation, 
it was in thinking that they could count on Sukarno, in a 
critis, if anything went wrong. Actually, they seem never 
to have considered the possibility of anything going wrong, 
such as their failing to capture all the generals, and the 
effect that it would have on Sukarno. At other times of 
national crisis, such as at the time of Indonesia's Inde-
pendence, Sukarno had displayed a conspicuous lack of 
courage. The coup leaders had failed to plan for just 
such a thing happening again. 
It is difficult to know just what influenced Sukarno 
to back out on the coup on the afternoon of 1 October. 
Certainly, Nasution's escape was one factor. Sukarno was 
alertedlto the possibility that Nasution had escaped very 
early in the morning, several hours before the coup leaders 
at Halim Air Force Base received information that led them 
to suspect the reports they had received that all the gen-
erals had been captured. Sukarno spent the entire morning 
trying to check out the reports that Nasution had escaped. 
He kept receiving conflicting information. Thus, he was 
forced to make many of the major decisions Of the day in 
a state of uncertainty, not knowing for sure whether Nasu-
tion had escaped or not. The whole effect seems to have 
been to throw him off-balance. It was not that Nasution's 
escape was all that disastrous for the coup. It is doubt-
ful that Sukarno would have considered it a major disaster 
and that he would have decided to call off the coup simply 
because of it. 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
According to one theory, it was the murder of the 
generals that caused Sukarno to pull back. There is a 
great difference of opinion as to whether or not Sukarno 
knew that the generals would be killed, assuming of course 
that he knew and approved of the plans to arrest the gen-
erals. The main reason for thinking that he would never 
have approved the murder of the generals is that it was 
not his style of dealing with political opponents. The 
prisons in Indonesia were full of Sukarno's political 
opponents, but he had never executed anyone for political 
reasons, and that included several people convicted of 
trying to assassinate him. If Sukarno was-surprised and/or 
shocked by. the murder of the generals, he certainly never 
showed it, either on the day of the coup or afterwards. 
In fact, his whole attitude towards the murder of the gen-
erals was one of unbelievable callousness. That, as much 
as anything else he did or said after the coup, turned the 
Army and the nation against him. 
Probably the main factor influencing Sukarno to call 
off the movement was the unexpected recovery of the Army from 
the stunning loss of six of its top generals. Here again, 
Nasution's escape was not the crucial factor. It was Gen. 
Suharto, not Nasution, who was the hero of the day, in 
rallying the armed forces against the coup. It could never 
have been foreseen that Suharto, known as a strong and 
capable officer but obviously underestimated as a leader, 
would so quickly and effectively take command of the Army 
in a crisis situation. It was his rallying of the Army 
against the coup that seems to have frightened Sukarno most. 
As mentioned above, the President had never been known for 
his physical courage. When it looked as though the Army 
was about to attack Halim Air Force Base, Sukarno appar-
ently lost his nerve. He decided against making the public 
statement in support of the coup that he had obviously 
intended to make; he finally decided to stop the movement 
altogether; he called in Supardjo to tell him of his deci-
sion. 
It is quite clear now that the coup leaders felt them-
selves betrayed by the President. It is debatable whether 
the coup would have succeeded or failed if Sukarno had not 
backed out on the coup. Quite clearly, the coup leaders 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
had miscalculated on one thing: the reaction of the Army 
to the loss of its top command. That miscalculation was 
not necessarily a fatal one, however. If Sukarno had not 
deserted the coup but had spoken out in defense of the 
action taken against the generals, as was planned, it is 
not at all certain that Suharto would have Stood up to 
the President. Sukarno could probably have carried the 
day for the coup, even though the Army was not in the 
leaderless, paralyzed state that the coup planners had 
figured it would be. Thus, it seems that the coup was 
probably a good bet to succeed--if everything had gone 
according to plan. Actually, not everything had to go 
according to plan. Neither the mistake in not capturing 
Nasution nor the miscalculation of the Army's response 
were crucial. The crucial factor was Sukarno. The suc-
cess of the coup depended on him. When the cow leaders 
failed to get his support, their cause suddenly became hope-
less. Their fatal mistake had been to trust everything 
to Sukarno. 
It is interesting to speculate just why the PKI 
should have risked everything on a coup of PKI making 
which, in the last analysis, depended on Sukarno, not 
the PKI. Almost certainly, Aidit would not have risked 
an action like the 30 September Movement without Sukarno's 
express approval beforehand. As we have seen, there is 
good evidence that the President was informed about the 
coup plans ahead of time. Although he may not have known 
all the details (for instance, he seems to have beeli 
surprised that Untung was chosen to lead the movement), 
he obviously knew a lot about the plans, including what 
was expected of him. He had a specific role to play in 
the coup, which had been planned well in advance; the PKI 
seems to have been in no doubt that he would do exactly 
what was expected of him. 
Aidit's supreme confidence in Sukarno's commitment 
to the coup may well have been based on more than Sukarno's 
approval of PKI plans for a coup; Aidit may actually have 
been convinced that he was carrying out a coup on Sukarno's 
behalf. A purge of the Army leadership, which is what the 
Indonesian coup intended, was absolutely in keeping with 
-284-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the direction of Sukarno's policies in 1965. In a series 
of bold moves against the opposition in late 1964 and early 
1965, he had succeeded in eliminating all effective centers 
of opposition, except the Army. In April 1965, he had 
begun to move against the Army; in the spring and summer, . 
he was able to push through several reforms that had the 
effect of undermining the Army as an independent political 
force. However, the Army had stood firm against two pro-
posals that would all but have destroyed it as an 
independent power in Indonesia; the "fifth force" concept 
and the political commissar system, which both Sukarno and 
the PKI were pressing on the Army. Sukarno may well have 
decided that unless there was a change in the Army leader-
ship the Army was not likely to give in on the matter of 
the "fifth force" and the even more controversial matter 
of introducing Nasakom councils in the command structure 
of the Army. In other words, he may have begun to think 
of purging the Army leadership, as he had purged the PNI 
leadership. 
There is some evidence that Sukarno actually went 
to the lengths of fabricating evidence that could be used 
against the Army in justifying a move against the generals. 
It has never been proved who forged the Gilchrist Letter, 
which was used by Sukarno as evidence of Army plotting 
against the government and Army intrigue with foreign 
enemies of the Indonesian state. However, the weight of 
the evidence points to Subandrio and his intelligence 
organization, the BPI, as having been responsible for the 
forgery; almost certainly, such an operation would have 
had Sukarno's approval. It is possible that Sukarno and 
the BPI were also responsible for the stories about a 
Generals' Council and its alleged plotting for a coup. 
The original report about the Generals' Council originated 
with the BPI. 
There was enough truth to the reports about a Gen-
erals' Council, however, that one must also leave open 
the possibility that Sukarno really believed the reports 
that the generals were plotting his overthrow. Since 
January 1965, Gen. Yani and four of his most trusted 
advisers in the Army had been meeting together in secret 
-285-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
to discuss ways of resisting Sukarno's moves to destroy 
the Army as a political force opposed to the radical 
movement to the left. Thus, the reports about the 
existence of a Generals' Council were true. However, 
there seems to have been no truth to the reports that 
the generals were planning a coup; there is no evidence 
that they were planning anything more than defensive 
measures to resist the efforts of Sukarno and the PKI 
to neutralize the Army as a political factor. 
As one might expect, there is little in the way of 
concrete evidence to link Sukarno with the planning of 
the coup. About the only evidence that there is consists 
of (1) a conversation of Sukarno with Gen. Adjie in July 
1965 in which Sukarno in reported to have promised Adjie 
that he could have Yani's job as Commander of the Army if 
he helped preserve order "during the trying period after 
Yani and the other generals in the Army were arrested," 
(2) the secret meeting of Sukarno with Dani on the morn-
ing of 29 September, which is thought to have been the 
occasion of Dani's telling Sukarno of Aidit's decision to 
stage the coup on 30 September, (3) several meetings of 
Sukarno with Aidit the last week in September, and (4) a 
conversation of Sukarno with Gen. Sugandhi on 30 September, 
in which Sugandhi asked the President directly if it was 
true, as Aidit had told him, that Sukarno knew about the 
plans of the PKI to stage a coup; Sukarno told Sugandhi 
not to interfere too much, to "go home and be careful." 
On the basis of Gen. Sugandhi's conversation with Sukarno, 
Nasution stated unequivocably, in public, on 13 February 
1967 that "the President gave the coup his blessing and 
assistance." Because the conversation is well documented, 
it is probably the most convincing piece of evidence that 
(1) Sukarno knew in advance that a PKI coup would take 
place, (2) that he was given some understanding of what 
the coup involved, and (3) that he agreed to the Plan.

Chinese Involvement -- At the time of the coup, many 
people--including most of the Communist leaders around the 
world--leaped to the conclusion that the Chinese must have 
been directly involved in the planning of the Indonesian 
coup. After years of patient tactics, owing little to 
Maoist precept, the PKI had seemed close to taking power; 
suddenly, its leaders had apparently been persuaded by 
Mao to risk all and lose all in a return to violence. 
There are certain inescapable facts that suggest 
that the Chinese were at least aware of PKI planning for 
a coup, though the evidence is all circumstantial. There 
is the fact that the decision to stage the coup was taken 
within a few days of Aidit's having talked with the Chinese 
leaders in Peking and Sukarno's having talked with the 
Chinese Foreign Minister (Chen Yi) in Djakarta. There is 
the fact that Sukarno sent Air Force Commander Dani on a 
secret mission to Communist China in mid-September to ar-
range for the immediate shipment of a quantity of small 
arms that the Chinese had promised to send Sukarno. Whether 
or mot the Chinese were informed of the reason for Sukarno's 
wanting the arms immediately is uncertain. Whether or not 
any of the arms shipments that Dani discussed with the 
Chinese officials arrived in Indonesia before the coup is 
also uncertain. However, the Chinese are known to have 
sent arms to Indonesia prior to September. Some Chinese 
arms, whether they were those sent before or during the 
months of September, were used in the coup--by the PKI 
volunteer troops that had received a quick course in mili-
tary training for the specific purpose of the coup. 
There is one other fact that suggests that the 
Chinese were informed about the coup planning in Indonesia. 
Normally, the PKI would be expected to send an impressive 
delegation, including someone of Politburo rank, to the 
National Day Celebrations in China on 1 October. On the 
occasion of National Day 1965, however, Aidit sent a 10-man 
delegation, the highest-ranking member of which was Sidik 
Kertapati, a not very well known member of the Central 
Committee. He was obviously influenced by considerations 
arising from the coup in wanting to have all PKI Politburo 
members in Indonesia around the end of September. Presumably, 
the PKI gave the Chinese some explanation for their sending 
-287-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
such a low level delegation. They could probably have 
come up with a satisfactory explanation without telling 
the Chinese about the coup, but it does suggest that the 
Chinese were informed about it. 
There is no doubt that the Chinese encouraged the 
PKI in the direction which finally led to the Indonesian 
coup. We know that they were privately urging other Asian 
Communist parties in the fall of 1965 to undertake certain 
preparations for armed struggle, such as the establishment 
of a covert .apparatus that would be trained and ready to 
engage in specific acts of violence at any time. It seems 
likely that the Chinese had influenced Aidit to set up the 
Special Bureau in November 1964; they probably had a fairly 
good idea of the capabilities of the Special Bureau for 
organizing an action like the 30 September movement. The 
Chinese would almost certainly have approved the PKI plans 
for the coup, especially as it was planned to have Sukarno's 
endorsement. It may be argued that the coup was more of 
an urban putsch than the kind of rural-based armed take-
over of power that the Chinese advocate, and that consequ-
ently it was not the kind of action that the CCP would have 
recommended to the PKI. Actually, however, the coup was 
never thought of as a move to seize power from Sukarno. 
It was a purge of the top Army leadership, with which the 
Chinese presumably would be very much in sympathy. If the 
CCP had had any qualms at all, it might have been on the 
questiodlof how far Sukarno was to be trusted by the PKI. 
Chinese support of the coup was, of course, made 
very clear after the coup. The Chinese leaders are reported 
to have received the news of the coup with "obvious glee;" 
they were reportedly "very smug" in reporting the news to 
the various Indonesian delegations visiting in Peking at 
the time. (The fact that they mentioned the names of the 
generals who had been "captured"--and included Nasution 
among them--before the identities of the missing generals 
had been clearly established and announced over the Indo-
nesian radio has been cited as an indication that the Chi-
nese were aware of the plot in advance and thought from 
early reports that it had been completely successful.) 
When later news was received that the coup was a failure, 
Peking's short-lived exuberance quickly turned to gloom

and the Chinese maintained a discreet silence on the subject 
of the Indonesian coup for many days. In all of their 
actions after the coup--such as the famous flag incident, 
in which the Chinese refused to honor �the Indonesian govern-
ment's request that all foreign embassies in Djakarta fly 
their flags at half mast in honor of the dead generals--the 
Chinese were absolutely unequivocal in their support of 
the coup, even though it was by then a hopeless cause and 
their continued support of it only contributed to the 
worsening of Chinese relations with the new Indonesian 
government. 
In summary, although the Chinese may have been aware 
of the coup plans and certainly very much in sympathy with 
them, there is no evidence that the Chinese masterminded 
the Indonesian coup. On the contrary, the evidence is that 
the planning of the coup was done by Aidit and Sjam. It 
would seem unlikely, in fact, that the Chinese were informed 
of specific details of the coup planning, such as the timing 
of the coup. There probably was not the time or the op-
portunity to inform the Chinese of the date set for the coup 
without risk to the secrecy of the plans. The final deci-
sion on the timing seems to have been made by Aidit on the 
evening of the 28th and communicated to the military lead-
ers of the coup the next day, only a little more than 24 
hours before the start of the coup. It is questionable 
that Aidit would have told the Chinese the exact timing 
of thelcoup, anyway, for security and other reasons. There 
is some indication that the Chinese were actually caught 
by surprise on the day of the coup. Mao made some remarks 
to a group of visiting Indonesian officials on 30 September 
that it seems he would not have made if he had known that 
the coup would be staged that very might, since, under the 
circumstances, his remarks could be taken to imply Chinese 
foreknowledge of the coup. 
On the matter of Chinese involvement, the evidence 
is simply not conclusive, much less so than it is on other 
aspects of the coup. This ambiguity is unlikely to change 
unless and until information is obtained on Aidit's conver-
sations with the Chinese in Peking in early August 1965 
or on Dani's secret negotiations with the Chinese in Septem-
ber.

APPENDIX II 
SOME COMMENTS ON THE INTERROGATION REPORTS 
Since our knowledge of the coup preparations that 
were being made in late August and September 1965 comes 
mainly from the confessions and interrogation reports of 
those involved, it seems appropriate to say a few words 
regarding the validity of such evidence. We have been 
able to see a good number of the interrogation reports, 
but by no means all of them. In most cases, we have the 
reports of several days of interrogation of a certain 
individual, but not his whole interrogation report; in 
the case of a few important people, we have no report at 
all of their interrogation. In both cases, however, we 
have the public testimony of the individual in question, 
either as a witness or the defendent in a case in court. 
The importance of the fact that the interrogation 
reports are the official reports of the Army and not a 
specibl version of the reports prepared for release out-
side the Indonesian Government is that the Army is not 
suspected of having edited or otherwise changed them in 
any way for any special purpose of its own. (It is inter-
esting to compare the interrogation reports with later 
statements made by the Army about the confessions of cer-
tain key figures in the coup; naturally, the Army choose 
to emphasize certain points made in the course of the 
interrogation and play down others). The interrogation 
reports themselves are convincing proof that they have 
not been fabricated, in part or in whole. There are dif-
ferences on a number of points--such as dates of meetings, 
persons attending, matters discussed, and precise wording 
of quotes from Aidit, etc. If these were fabricated state-
ments, put in the mouths of the accused, one would expect 
-311-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
much less disagreement between them than actually exists; 
certainly, the more troubling discrepancies would have 
been reconciled. Moreover, if one assumed that the army 
was primarily interested in implicating the PKI (which 
was obvious in its selection of certain points from the 
interrogation reports for public circulation), one would 
expect much stronger evidence of PKI involvement than is 
presented in some instances. A few witnesses were less 
than positive about PKI participation. They "believed" 
certain people who were at meetings and directing discus-
sions were PKI members; they were not sure. If the army 
was out to build an airtight case against the PKI, it is 
not likely that such loopholes would have been left. Fin-
ally, there.is the fact that some persons implicated in 
the coup were interrogated by the police and others by 
naval and air force personnel; the army was not in charge 
of all the interrogation. For instance, PKI leader Njono 
was interrogated by a colonel of the Indonesian Army in 
Djakarta, but Paris Pardede, another important PKI leader, 
was interrogated by an officer of the regional police in 
Medati; North Sumatra, where he was captured and, after 
interrogation, executed. Air Force Major Sujono was 
interrogated in Djakarta by a team of police, army, navy, 
and air force representatives. It does not seem likely 
that interviews by different interrogators and services 
could have been carried out as part of a carefullyccon-
structed fabrication. 
A 
If we accept the fact that the interrogation reports 
are verbatim transcripts of the actual interrogation of 
various people in connection with the 30 September Move-
ment, there is still the question of the validity of such 
evidence. It is certainly true that evidence obtained from 
men under duress, either physical or mental, as these men 
certainly were, must be accepted with some reservation. 
It is always possible that the person under interrogation 
will sometimes say whatever he thinks the interrogators 
want him to say in order to end the ordeal of interroga-
tion. This could not possibly have accounted for the 
striking similarity in the stories told by Untung, Latief, 
Sujono, and Supardjo, however. They all told basically 
the same story of regular meetings (beginning around 6 
September 1965 and continuing right up to the night before 
-312-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the coup) with a mysterious figure "Sjam", who started 
the discussions with an explanation of the Generals' Coun-
cil and its plans for a military coup and, consequently, 
the urgent need to prepare for a countercoup. Sjam is 
always reported to have led the discussions, which in- � 
creasingly centered on military preparations for the count-
ercoup; he is consistently reported to have told the group 
not to be concerned with the political ramifications of 
their action, as that had been taken care of by others. 
It would have been all but impossible for the Indonesian 
Army to have included Sjam as a significant figure in a 
fictitious account of the coup preparations, when his 
identity and function were not even known within the PKI, 
much less to the army, prior to his arrest in March 1967 
on the basis of descriptions of him in the interrogation 
reports. 
There is always the possthility that the major 
participants in the coup might have agreed ahead of time 
on a cover story to be used later in the event that the 
coup failed. However, everything indicates that the plan-
ning for theocoup was not as thorough as all that. Other, 
much more important things were not well prepared for. 
There are a number of facts that suggest that the plotters 
were remarkably confident of success; apparently, they 
never considered the possibility of'failure--witness the 
obvious lack of advance planning as to what to do (not just 
say) 1if the coup failed. Untung, Latief, Sujono, and 
Supardjo have all stated that there was no contingency 
planning for a second attack in case the first move was 
less than successful; they have all remarked that Sjam 
only kept assuring them of success. Furthermore, if their 
stories about the September meetings with Sjam and the 
last minute preparations at Halim had all been made up, 
they could never have been so detailed. Even in the de-
tails, they reinforce one another; the differences are 
not so much contradictions as inconsistencies due to per-
sonal differences in sensitivity to detail, ability to 
recollect, and, probably in some measure, to willingness 
to be completely forthright. 
To be sure, one has to be discriminating in choosing 
what to believe and what not to believe in the testimony 
Approved for for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
of each individual and whamto believe and whomnot to believe 
when their testimony differs. After a while, one gets a 
definite feeling for the people being interrogated and the 
reliability of certain testimony vs. other testimony; for 
instance, Untung's testimony vs. that of Dani or Sujono.. 
The latter two were obviously devious in answering some 
questions; their testimony is sometimes illogical. Sujono 
again and again tries to put the blame on someone else for 
decisions he clearly seems to have made himself. At Untung's 
trial, Untung directly challenged parts of his testimony. 
Where there As no other supporting evidence we would defini-
tely tend to accept Untung's version over Sujono's. Most 
often, Untung seems to have the clearest memory of events 
and to have paid the closest attention to detail, for in-
stance, the exact time that he issued a certain order or 
signed the various Decrees. His account usually checks out 
well with other facts that are known to be true--for in-
stance, the time that the decrees were first read over the 
radio or the timing of the attacks on the generals' homes, 
etc. And then there is the difference in motivation (other 
than coercion) of the different men in confessing to their 
activities in the coup. After the coup, Untung seems gen-
uinely to have regretted his actions on behalf of the 30 
September Movement and to have been willing to confess the 
whole truth as best he remembered it. At the end of his 
interrogation, he had the following words to say: 
Everything that I have stated is true and 
if necessary I am willing to swear to the 
truth of my statements. Everything that I 
have said to this interrogator is all that 
I can remember; perhaps I have forgotten 
some things, but this is not due to any 
deliberate deviation on my part but rather 
it is due exclusively to a lapse of memory 
of the matter. I would like to state from 
my heart that I truly regret everything 
that occurred on 1 October because I had no 
knowledge at all nor was I informed either 
by the military which took part in the move-
ment or by the PKI which planned the entire 
movement the cruel tragedy that would occur 
-314-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
and thus this was beyond my humanity. I once 
again state that I truly regret what has hap-
pened. 
None of the other coup leaders expressed any such feelings 
of remorse over what they had done. As we shall see later, 
Untung seems really to have believed in the existence of 
the Generals' Council and its plans to stage a coup against 
Sukarno. After the coup, he apparently realized that the 
generals never had any such plans to overthrow Sukarno 
and that he had been tricked by the PKI into believing 
this. Apparently, he also felt that he had been let down 
by Sjam and the others who planned the coup; all the as-
surances he had received of adequate military strength, 
of support from certain army and air force units that 
never materialized, and of logistical preparations had 
proved to be false. In the interrogation reports of some 
PKI members one can detect a similar distinct feeling of 
betrayal by the party leaders, particularly Aidit. It 
is perhaps understandable that out of deep bitterness these 
people should tell the whole story of the coup as they 
remembered it. Other people would obviously have quite 
different feelings and motivation. Some--like Dani or 
Subandrio and possibly Sjam--who presumably knew more than 
Untung or Latief or Sujono about who was really behind the 
coup and who would presumably still want to protect those 
persons, would obviously be less forthcoming than Untung 
in teiling all that they knew. Their answers to questions 
regarding Sukarno's involvement, for instance, might ne 
deliberately misleading, while on other matters their testi 
mony might be more reliable. Where interrogation reports 
are the main source of information, there will obviously 
be matters of judgment such as these, in accepting one 
person's testimony over another's or a certain part of the 
testimony but not all of it. 
In conclusion, although there are certain difficul-
ties in piecing together the whole story of the conspiracy 
that lay behind the events of 1 October--considering the 
fact that the coup preparations were a well kept secret 
all during the time they were in progress and there is no 
independent reporting to confirm or deny what is really 
the only important source of our information on the subject, 
-315-
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
Approved for Release: 2023/01/23 C00186624 
the word of the conspirators themselves--there is good rea-
son to think that we do now know the essential truth about 
those preparations. Although it is not and never will be 
a matter of proven fact--in the way that the events of 
1 October and the days following can be established as 
fact--the true story of the conspiracy behind the coup 
seems to us to have been established beyond any reasonable 
doubt in the confessions of those involved in the con-
spiracy.
