 The author recommends the study of the theories
 to understand their essential meaning, but
 that those theories must be applied to the Chinese revolutionary
 movement and, from that application, methods must be deduced for
 the solution of the theoretical and strategic problems of the Chi-
 nese.
 It is interesting to note that only Marx, Lenin, and Mao are
 cited as authorities in doctrinal theories and principles, iand nference that

 they are the responsibility of the people to be carried out by thought-provoking
 and self _awakening methods.
 Self-education and self-criticism by the people is in accord with the the-

 We must not choose at random those problems which either are irrelevant

 For the same reason, it is profitable to suggest that our cadres, which
 have wider experience, study the revolutionary policies at various stages and
 analyze their experience at the time they began their studies of the theories
 of Marx and Lenin. It was by following such a procedure of assigned study
 that the first stage of our study plan achieved some progress.  Such an ap-
 proach of bringing study closer to reality can be applied to most areas, whe-
 ther the people there are just starting or whether they are already engaged
 in the study of the theories of Marx and Lenin.  However, what we have achieved
 so far is only elementary knowledge.  It would be a mistake to stop making fur-
 ther efforts.
 The purpose of studying the theories of Marx and Lenin is not to memorize
 the revolutionary principles and use them as substitutes for old ideas.  Rather,
 it is to understand the propositions, principles, and methods of approach of
 the theories of Marx and Lenin and apply them in developing a theory of Chinese
 revolution and in guiding the strategy of the revolution.  These principles also
 serve as guiding principles in work and study.   In other words, we should ana-

 The theories of Marx and Lenin are nothing but a body of sound principles
 derived objectively from existing reality.  Relating theory to practice means one the    eeusefof deduction of a guidey uropractice,condtheoother. tIn studying
 and d the use of that theory to gu .

 attitude we are studying the theories of Marx and Lenin.  We must apply these

 "We must analyze the real 'circumstances beyond the boundary of our dis-

 Having such an attitude, let us examine our achievement of the past year.

 goal.  What we now have achieved in our first step will be completely wasted
 if it is not followed by advanced study
 In this connection, we would like briefly to discuss the Rectification
 Movement.  The purpose of the present Rectification Movement is to correct
 the fallacious bureaucracy and high-handedness which are widespread among
 cadres and party members in general?  Such erroneous attitudes are in direct
 opposi,ion to the theories of Marx and Lenin because people who commit such
 mistakes are separating theory from reality, thus getting away from the masses.

 Instead of closely studying the living conditions of the masses wtohdiscovernded
 general principles as guides for action, they  rea: the people
 and arbitrary methods,.
 To get rid of bureaucracy and high-handedness, it then becomes ecessaryd
 to assign the cadres and party members in. gener.a._ to study party
 conduct self-criticism, to analyze the actual      attances surrounding tthe he
 people and themselves, to grasp the problems involved, and to use them as rules of conduct.  Therefore, the pur-

 of studying, one must always bear in mind the principles of Mao Tse-tung, the

 political platform of new China, and the various tacks facing us.
 However, this is not to say that a mere perusal of the 12 assigned books
 means that one has mastered the theories of Marx and Lenin.       A correct atti-

 To those who really know how to get the essimeaningafromnthe theories
 of Marx and Lenin, such questions do not arise, because

 those who are merely spectators in learning.   Certainly they can get only a
 negative answer to the questions they ask,  These people take an unyyeldingiat-

 Navy.  The Army and Navy representatives told the members of the Social Demo-

 thing was ready for action, they were awaiting further instructions from the
 party.  After being silent for a moment, the party members replied that they
 could not solve the problem of the rebellion unless a special meeting was held
 to discuss the whole matter.  The Navy representatives said that they were ready
 for action, but that they would certainly fail if they did not obtain approval
 and instructions from the Social Democratic Party,  After the representatives

 much harm to those students who are just beginning to study the elementary
 k_icz of Marx and Lenin.  But the habit of looking for ready formulas in
 can be a great handicap to the advanced students wno are exyC,t=a to ap-
 books s can `~
 ply these theories to practical problems,   Unless such an attitude is corrected,
 we cannot take a step forward.
 In the second place, we should emphasize self-instruction and not rely on
 meetings, discussions, informal talks, and lectures as the preferred method of
 studying the theories of Marx and Lenin. The essence of these theories can
 never be found in verbal forms or grasped through casual talk.  It may only be
 learned by hard study, by contemplation on the part of each indivalistudlnt,
 and by referring to reality.   Only through such intensive study, idu          roach
 conducted, could we ever understand the attitudes, views, and methods of approach
 which were so successfully used by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in analyzing
 various problems.

 There is not a Marxist in history whose success did not depend on self-
 instruction rather than group discussion, meetings, and lectures.  The empha-
 sis                        on self-instruction does not necessarily imply that we are getting away and
 condit from the practticasecludel                  fr mn he massesionands astthe old
 equally wrong
 saying g goes, "shut our ears to things beyond the window, and study whole-
 heartedly the books by great men."
 We must establish a suitably close relationship between our studies of
 the theories of Marx and Lenin and our observation of actual problems and the
 life of the people.  This is essential to the mastery of the theories of Marx
 and Lenin.   It is because we expect to apply our knowledge to actual problems
 that we must put greater emphasis on individual study and investigation.   Of
 rmal
 course, it is still indispensable to make judicious  Semeetings, iinfo nn hardly
 talks, and lectures.  But unless we study very hard uy ourselves awcan be able
 make the theories of Marx and Lenin our own, or we may, perhaps, merely
 to recite passages without knowing their essence
 There is no definite method of study.  It all depends on the ability and
 experience of the individual.   The emphasis on self-instruction applies pri-
 marily to advanced students, especially those who have finished reading the
 12 books.  For those whose level of understanding is still low, it is desir-
 able that they be taught several elementary books in class.   It is still nec-
 essary to use group meetings, discussion, and self-criticism in the training
 classes where thought indoctrination is only beginning.  However, we ought to
 consider it our essential job to stimulate independent thinking and self-
 instruction among the beginners.  We should give them enough time to do their
 own study.   Indeed, what we oppose is the practice of filling the schedule
 with lectures and meetings as is done in some places, or spending  -.2 hours
 daily in discussion or in talks which have nothing to do with study, because,
 in such cases, virtually no time is left for the students
 mto do ethod.? t eiriownan
 studying.    Let us ask ourselves, is this a proper study
 be called a "method" at all).  Can we hope to achieve anything from such a
 method?
 Self-instruction requires competent leadership and proper organization.
 Schools and government organizations in the various areas should devise meas-
 ures to give proper assistance to those advanced students who have finished
 reading the 12 assigned books.  Such assistance would consist, for instance,
 of arrangements facilitating the students' own studies, allowing them suffi-
 cient time for such studies.  We may use other methods to teach the beginners,
 based on our past experience, but it is desirable to set up lecture classes
 if possible.  In short, we should correct the erroneous attitude of replacing
