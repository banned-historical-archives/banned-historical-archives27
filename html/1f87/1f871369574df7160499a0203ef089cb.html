Israel: Shamir at Midterm 
In November 1987, Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir 
reached the midpoint of his 25-month term as Prime 
Minister. In his first year he has achieved some 
notable personal political successes, suffered few 
outright failures, and narrowed the gap between 
Likud and the Labor Party in polls for next year's 
Knesset election. Most important, he has consolidated 
his position as Likud's leader and successfully blocked 
proposals for an international conference on Arab-
Israeli peace. Shamir's single major defeat was the 
cancellation in late August of the Lavi fighter plane 
project, a program he had supported. 
Master in His Own House 
In 1987, Shamir took advantage of the power of the 
incumbency and consolidated his position through 
quiet but persistent maneuvering in Likud's ranks. 
Viewed as a weak, transitional leader, Shamir has 
long faced challenges from party rivals David Levi 
and Ariel Sharon. Shamir was the victor at the 1987 
convention of Herut?the predominant faction in 
Likud?and for the first time established himself as 
the undisputed party leader. If, as expected, he seeks 
to lead Likud's list for the Knesset election in 
November 1988, he is likely to win. The chances that 
Levi or Sharon will mount a serious challenge against 
him in 1988 have decreased in the past year. 
Herut's convention in March 1987 was a major 
victory for Shamir. He was selected by acclamation as 
party chairman, a post that was vacant since Likud 
founder Menachem Begin retired from active political 
life in September 1983. The election of Shamir's 
chosen successor, Moshe Arens, as head of Likud's 
powerful secretariat was another victory for the Prime 
Minister. Shamir's most persistent rival, Sephardi 
populist David Levi, eked out a narrow victory in the 
contest for deputy party chairman, but his small 
1 
margin against a weak challenger was viewed widely 
in the party as a major setback and a symbolic victory 
for Shamir, according to US diplomats in Tel Aviv. 
Since the convention, Levi has lowered his political 
profile. According to US Embassy reporting, he 
recognizes that his chances of taking on Shamir 
successfully are poor. 
Shamir's most important gain at the Herut conclave 
was probably the convention's decision to declare all 
its delegates as the new Herut Central Committee. 
Convention results suggest that Shamir controlled the 
largest single bloc of delegates. The new Central 
Committee will decide the candidates and their 
ranking for Herut's Knesset list next year. 
Shamir has improved his standing in Herut by not 
allowing his party rivals to outflank him on the major 
issues dividing Labor and Likud. Shamir opposes an 
international conference on Middle Eastern peace. 
His firm stand against the proposal served to burnish 
his credentials with Likud and its allies on the right. 
Shamir succeeded in portraying himself as the 
protector of "Judea, Samaria, and even Jerusalem," 
according to US diplomats in Tel Aviv. He also 
presented Labor Party leader Peres's promotion of the 
conference idea as a thinly veiled and opportunistic 
attempt to break the National Unity government and 
move to an early election. 
Winning Through Obstruction 
Shamir largely held his fire as then Prime Minister 
Peres pressed for an international conference during 
the first half of the National Unity government. 
Shamir apparently did not want to risk splitting the

Secret 
government and losing his turn as prime minister by 
fighting a proposal that had made little practical 
progress. Soon after becoming Prime Minister, 
Shamir began to take a more aggressive stance 
against the conference proposal. When Peres finally 
sought a showdown in Israel's 10-man "inner 
cabinet," Shamir rallied sufficient support to force 
Peres to shelve his plan to hold a vote on the issue. 
Shamir has succeeded in turning the debate on the 
peace process from the conference proposal to 
alternative frameworks centered on direct Arab-
Israeli peace talks unencumbered by superpower 
involvement and on functional autonomy rather than 
territorial compromise. 
Shamir is convinced that an international conference 
would lead to unbearable pressure on Israel to make 
major territorial concessions on the West Bank, Gaza 
Strip, and Golan Heights. Peres declared in May 
1987 that he would seek government approval for a 
conference, believing that international sponsorship 
was the only way Jordan's King Hussein could be 
enticed into negotiations with Israel. Peres hoped to 
win the support of at least one Likud member in the 
inner cabinet, which is split evenly between the two 
major parties. But Shamir intensified his rhetoric 
against an international conference?making it an 
idea that Likud members could support only at the 
risk of political suicide. Peres, recognizing defeat, 
backed down and did not even call for a formal vote in 
the inner cabinet. 
Peres compounded his error by openly seeking an 
early election, stating that the National Unity 
government should not continue if it was deadlocked 
on so important an issue as the peace conference. 
Once again Shamir outmaneuvered Peres, lining up 
sufficient support in the Knesset to block Labor's 
early election bid. Peres for the second time in a 
month was forced to back down in defeat and 
embarrassment on a major issue. Recognizing defeat, 
he refrained from submitting an early election bill for 
a formal Knesset vote. 
According to US diplomats in Tel Aviv, Shamir has 
benefited from the public's perception that the 
economy has stabilized. Moderate inflation?which at 
Secret 
15 to 20 percent for 1987 looks good compared with 
the triple-digit inflation three years ago?works to the 
political advantage of the incumbent. Shamir's gains 
from economic stability will probably be marginal. He 
is widely seen as disengaged from economic policy 
making and unwilling to lobby for further economic 
reforms, such as easing the burden of Israel's tax 
system to place the economy on a long-term growth 
track. Successive Likud Finance Ministers Modai and 
Nissim, and Peres, who was a proponent of the July 
1985 economic stabilization program, have garnered 
most of the credit for Israel's economic turnaround. 
Shamir runs a risk of being blamed for any economic 
downturn during the remainder of his term. 
Likud Loses Lavi 
Until almost the end, the long Israeli debate over 
whether to continue developing the Lavi fighter plane 
was conducted on the basis of merit, not partisan 
politics. The final Cabinet vote on Lavi split almost 
entirely along party lines?Likud for, Labor against. 
US Embassy reporting suggests that Shamir was not 
committed to Lavi, realizing the economic, 
diplomatic, and military risks inherent in its 
continuation. Shamir remained undecided on the Lavi 
until almost the final vote, and some Shamir aides 
told US diplomats that he would vote for the program 
only if he was confident that there were enough 
opposition votes to kill it. Despite his doubts about the 
Lavi, polls demonstrate that Israelis perceive the 
plane's cancellation as a Likud?and hence Shamir?
defeat. 
Lack of Leadership 
Shamir's most persistent problem in his first year as 
Prime Minister has been his normally low-key, 
leadership. His agenda has been largely 
negative and reactive?against an international 
conference, against Lavi cancellation, and against an 
early election. He has not proposed many new ideas, 
sticking in the peace process debate to a watered-
down version of autonomy that was rejected several 
years ago as a nonstarter and insisting on direct Arab-
Israeli peace talks without superpower interference.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/10/03: CIA-RDP05502029R000300980002-5 
US diplomats in Tel Aviv believe that Shamir's style 
is to avoid flashy and uncertain initiatives. In our 
assessment, his main goal is to finish his term as 
Prime Minister. 
Walking a Thin Line 
Since the beginning of the National Unity 
government, Shamir has adhered faithfully to the 
coalition agreement on settlements, which allowed for 
only six new communities in the occupied territories. 
Since becoming Prime Minister, Shamir has come 
under increasing pressure from prosettlement activists 
in Likud and other right wing parties to establish more 
settlements. Shamir has resisted such pressure, 
realizing that Labor would not tolerate the 
establishment of more than the communities allowed 
under the coalition agreement. 
Prosettlement forces?especially the rightwing 
Tehiya Party?are likely to increase their demands 
for additional settlements in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip during the next year. Shamir is caught in a 
dangerous crosscurrent. If he accedes to prosettlement 
demands, he risks forcing Labor to end the National 
Unity government, increasing the chances of an early 
election, and curtailing his term as Prime Minister. If 
he continues to resist new settlements, Shamir risks 
pressing some Likud voters to move further to the 
right into the ranks of Tehiya and Rabbi Meir 
Reverse Blank 3 
Secret 
Kahane's Kakh Party. Shamir is likely to hold the line 
on new settlements, trying to convince activists that 
limited funds make it more important to strengthen 
existing settlements. 
Outlook 
Shamir can take encouragement from Likud's 
improving status in public opinion polls in recent 
months. After trailing Labor before the rotation in 
October 1986 by as many as 10 seats, Likud recently 
has narrowed the gap to just a few. Polls in June and 
September 1987 showed that Likud, together with 
Tehiya, would almost equal Labor and its allies if a 
new election was held. Such an outcome could make 
another National Unity government the most likely 
result of next year's election. Israeli polls traditionally 
have overestimated Labor support and undervalued 
Likud's backing. Barring unforeseen developments or 
a reemergence of Likud leadership squabbles, Shamir 
will head into next year's election in better shape than

Israel?Western Europe: 
Forei7 Relations Report 
Card 
Strengthening ties to Western Europe is a crucial 
Israeli foreign policy goal. Israeli political standing in 
Western Europe suffered markedly in the early 1980s 
because of Israel's invasion of Lebanon. It has 
improved since the formation of the National Unity 
government in 1984. Although the Israeli leadership 
does not perceive Western Europe as a primary 
participant in Middle Eastern issues, Tel Aviv seeks 
European political support for Israeli positions on 
Middle Eastern peace. 
Beyond political interests, Tel Aviv is pursuing 
entrance to the European Economic Community and 
maintains a wide range of military sales and service 
contracts in Western Europe. Tel Aviv hopes to 
expand military deals with NATO countries, 
particularly after the cancellation of the Lavi fighter 
aircraft project. 
Impact of the National Unity Government 
Before the formation of the National Unity 
government in 1984, Israelis perceived relations with 
Western Europe to be at a dangerously low level, 
according to US Embassy reporting. The Israeli 
invasion of Lebanon in 1982?which most European 
states vociferously opposed?sharply increased 
tensions between the Israeli forces and West 
European troops serving in the UN Forces in 
Lebanon. Rightwing Likud Prime Ministers 
Menachem Begin (1977-83) and Yitzhak Shamir 
(1983-84) further rankled West Europeans with their 
staunch adherence to Likud's hardline platform on 
Arab-Israeli issues, particularly the adamant refusal 
to consider territorial compromise in the occupied 
territories. 
The upturn in relations began with the establishment 
of Israel's National Unity government. When the 
1984 national election failed to yield a clear victor, 
the two major parties--Labor and Likud?were 
forced to share political leadership. As Prime Minister 
for the first half of the 50-month term, Labor leader 
Peres improved the diplomatic climate with Western 
5 
Europe through more flexible peace policies and 
softer rhetoric. Peres tried to reinvigorate the stalled 
Arab-Israeli peace process, holding highly publicized 
meetings with Egyptian President Mubarak and 
Moroccan King Hassan and underscoring his party's 
endorsement of territorial compromise to resolve the 
disposition of the West Bank and Gaza. In this 
context, he proposed the concept of an international 
Middle Eastern peace conference, which after opening 
ceremonies would break down into autonomous Arab-
Israeli working groups for conducting direct 
negotiations. Frequent visits to Western Europe to 
garner support for his conference proposal enhanced 
his reputation as a diplomat and statesman. 
Tel Aviv points to a series of exchanges at senior 
levels and several bilateral agreements as proof of the 
improvement in Israeli?West European relations since 
the establishment of the National Unity government. 
According to US Embassy reporting, Tel Aviv 
concedes that progress in relations with some West 
European states is more modest than with others. In 
addition to the warm receptions Peres received in 
Western Europe, developments since 1984 that have 
contributed to improved Israeli-West European 
relations include: 
? Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 1985. 
? Establishment of official relations with Spain in 
1986. 
? Increased trade and tourism with Greece. 
? The successful visits to Israel by Western European 
leaders, such as West Germany's Chancellor Kohl 
and Britain's Prime Minister Thatcher. 
? The visit by the Finnish Foreign Minister in 1986 
and new bilateral agreements intensifying cultural 
exchanges and trade. 
West European Role in Middle Eastern Peace 
Although Peres sees Western Europe's role in the 
Middle East as secondary to that of the United States, 
he has proved more willing than Shamir to consider a

Secret 
supplementary role for Western Europe in regional 
diplomacy. As Foreign Minister since he switched 
jobs with Shamir in October 1986, Peres has actively 
sought European support for his international 
conference proposal. He has visited several West 
European capitals?including London, Paris, and 
Bonn?to meet with senior leaders and enlist their 
backing to maximize the pressure on Shamir to accept 
an international conclave. 
Peres has been successful in winning European 
support?particularly from Britain and West 
Germany, which have pressed Shamir through 
diplomatic channels and publicly announced support 
for Peres's conference proposal. Shamir?backed by 
hardliners in his party?adamantly and publicly 
rejects Peres's idea. Shamir has long advocated direct 
negotiations with Jordan and has stated repeatedly his 
opposition to participation by the superpowers in a 
Middle Eastern peace conference for fear that they  
will force Israel to give up the West Bank 
Military Sales and Service Contracts 
Israel is interested in expanding its access to the 
military sales and service market in NATO countries. 
Israel has established a wide range of contacts in 
Western Europe?including excellent bilateral 
military relations with West Germany, Spain, and 
Switzerland. Nevertheless, Israel cannot bid on many 
projects because operational readiness concerns have 
led to contract clauses limiting work on NATO 
hardware to the Western European theater. The 
Israelis have partly circumvented this restriction by 
establishing subsidiaries of Israeli companies in 
Western Europe, but the type of major contracts 
Israel envisions?such as servicing US helicopters and 
aircraft engines deployed  in Western Europe?would 
have to be done in Israel 
The recent cancellation of Israel's Lavi fighter 
aircraft program has intensified Tel Aviv's effort to 
obtain service and sales contracts in Western Europe. 
Defense Minister Rabin's economic adviser recently 
told US Embassy officials that Israel Aircraft 
Industries needed $240 million annually in new 
business to replace work related to the Lavi, and that 
Israel expected the United States to help it win new 
contracts in Europe. Israel particularly wants US 
Secret 
assistance in securing contracts to upgrade Turkey's 
F-4 fighter aircraft fleet and in ensuring greater 
Israeli participation in maintaining and coproducing 
parts and ammunition for NATO aircraft 
In addition to strict contract clauses limiting Israeli 
access to European military contracts, Israeli firms 
face an uphill battle competing with much larger and 
better developed West European and US companies. 
Tel Aviv has made important inroads in several 
European states. Israel and West Germany are 
cooperating closely in the development of armor-
piercing tank ammunition, and Israel currently sells 
large amounts of 105mm ammunition to the West 
Germans. The Swiss have examined Israeli 
miniaturized remotely piloted vehicles and may 
purchase some in the near future. The Israeli firm 
Soltam recently began joint production of mortars 
with Tampella in Finland to facilitate international 
sales of this weapon 
Challenge of the European Economic Community 
Tel Aviv has devoted special attention to expanding 
its export markets in the European Economic 
Community, which collectively is Israel's most 
important trading partner. Foreign Minister Peres has 
expressed concern about Israel's chronic and growing 
trade deficit with the Community. By July the 
shortfall had jumped 45 percent over last year to $2 
billion. To correct the imbalance, Peres has pressed 
the Europeans for larger export quotas, increased 
financial assistance, and expanded trade opportunities 
in high-technology areas. 
Israel is especially concerned about the adverse 
impact that the Community's admission in 1986 of 
Portugal and Spain?competitors in agricultural 
products?will have on Israeli agricultural exports. 
Although the Community has provided some 
protection for Israeli citrus exports, Tel Aviv fears 
intense competition from Spain will erode its market 
share in Europe through the advantage of Community 
price guarantees and other subsidies

Israel's desire for improved access has been further 
complicated by West European attempts to press Tel 
Aviv to allow West Bank exporters to sell directly to 
European markets. In discussions held in October 
1987, the European Community commissioner made 
clear to Shamir that Israeli refusal to permit direct 
Palestinian sales in Western Europe would block 
passage of a pending Israeli?European Community 
trade protocol. On a positive note, the commissioner 
assured the Israelis that Palestinian exports to 
Western Europe would not count against their own 
quotas. A follow-up European Community delegation 
is scheduled to meet soon with Israeli and Palestinian 
representatives in Tel Aviv. 
Israeli expertise and experience in the high-
technology area is highly coveted by the Europeans. 
The Community recently made $63 million available 
for loans to small and medium-size Israeli industrial 
firms to encourage high-technology exports, according 
to press reports. Spain has signed a protocol with Tel 
Aviv providing for cooperation in industrial 
technology development 
Outlook 
Despite the improvement in relations with most 
European states since the early 1980s, Israelis 
acknowledge limits in this rapprochement with 
Western Europe. West European views on the Arab-
Israeli conflict often hinder Israeli efforts to deepen 
bilateral relations. Israelis believe the West European 
states generally endorse pro-Arab positions on peace 
issues?particularly major Israeli territorial 
concessions on the West Bank and a central role for 
the PLO 
Reverse Blank 7 
Secret 
Israel opposes continued European arms sales to Arab 
states formally in a state of war with Israel. But Israel 
has little leverage to pry West European countries?
such as Britain and France?from historical ties and 
lucrative arms sales in the region. Although Israeli 
lobbying against such sales has been restrained in 
recent years, the prospect of increased sales to Jordan 
and Saudi Arabia by West European countries will 
probably become a more contentious issue in 
Israeli?West European relations. 
The stalemate between Peres and Shamir over an 
international Middle Eastern peace conference 
probably will cloud further major improvements in 
relations with Western Europe. Should Labor win the 
1988 national election with a sufficient plurality to 
form a government, Peres as Prime Minister would be 
unrestricted by coalition compromises, and relations 
with Western Europe probably would improve. A 
Likud victory, on the other hand, would produce a 
nationalistic government whose hardline views would 25X1 
quickly strain relations with Western Euro e and 
return them to the chilly days before 1984.

Jordan: Fundamentalist Groups 
and Strategies 
although Islamic 
fundamentalist groups do not threaten the monarchy, 
previous estimates have significantly understated 
their strength. Fundamentalists are active and 
'represented in all sectors of Jordanian society, 
including universities, trade unions, and professional 
associations. They have been successful in 
parliamentary elections and have a small but 
prominent bloc of six delegates in that 60- member 
body. The Muslim Brotherhood?the largest and only 
legal fundamentalist organization in Jordan?has 
made major strides in penetrating some government 
ministries. It has established a small network of 
schools, social service facilities, and youth programs 
to aid its missionary work among the population. 
younger Jordanians 
and Palestinians may be turning to more radical 
fundamentalist organizations?particularly the 
Islamic Liberation Party, which has substantially 
25X1 increased its membership despite its illegal status. 
Background 
25X1 King Hussein has long recognized the threat to his 
regime from Islamic activity and has tried to co-opt 
traditional fundamentalist elements.  
25X1 
Friday sermons by all Muslim preachers?
including those affiliated with the Muslim 
Brotherhood?must be approved in advance by the 
Ministry of Islamic Affairs, which also registers 
religious figures. The government has been quick to 
suppress Islamic groups that depart from 
governmentally sanctioned Islam, particularly groups 
with antimonarchical tendencies 
 The largest is the 
Islamic Liberation Party, which espouses the violent 
overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. 
this group is increasing its 
membership because it offers a new channel of 
9 
expression for young Jordanians and Palestinians 
unsettled by the country's stagnating economy and 
the poor job prospects. The US Embassy notes that 
fundamentalists have been especially successful in the 
poorer urban neighborhoods in Amman, the northern 
city of Irbid, and other towns where there is a 
significant gap between the rich and poor. The 
Embassy also reports a discernible rise in Islamic 
activity on campuses in recent years, noting that 
fundamentalists are drawing support by exploiting 
student grievances. Fundamentalists played an 
important role in the Yarmuk University riots in 
1986, in which three students were killed in 
confrontations with government forces. 25X1

King Hussein does not appear to consider the 
fundamentalists a threat to the monarchy, although 
he recently dampened their parliamentary prospects.

According to the US Embassy, the Brotherhood has 
worked effectively to increase its membership and to 
penetrate government ministries, including the 
Ministries of Education, Islamic Affairs, and Youth. 
Programs and social services provided by these 
ministries facilitate contacts between Brotherhood 
supporters and the general public, which aid the 
Brotherhood's recruitment efforts. 
Consequently, the Brotherhood is becoming more 
prominent. The Brotherhood is focusing its activities 
on developing a system of schools, social service 
facilities, and youth programs to bring people into 
contact with the organization. The Embassy reports 
that particular emphasis is being placed on programs 
for youth, which combine sports with prayer and 
religious instruction under the supervision of 
Brotherhood members. 
The Islamic Liberation Party 
The Islamic Liberation Party is banned because it 
advocates the violent overthrow of the Hashemite  
monarchy. 
 If 
discovered by Jordanian authorities, the US Embassy 
reports that members are subject to rigorous 
surveillance by the General Intelligence Directorate 
and may be detained for questioning and imprisoned 
for up to several years. 
The party recently has become more active in 
disseminating literature, although its capability in this 
area is limited. During the Muslim feast of Id al-
Adha last August, the 
party distributed leaflets critical of the Jordanian 
regime. In addition, Jordanian police were recently 
ordered to arrest several party members for 
antiregime activities. 
Outlook 
We believe that fundamentalism in Jordan will 
grow?particularly while Jordan's economy continues 
to stagnate?but it will not be a near-term threat to 
the King. Hussein's security services can contain the 
activities of the clandestine groups, and we believe 
they will continue to do so. 
To monitor future candidates for parliament and 
restrict fundamentalist participants, a new election 
law requires potential candidates to submit their 
names to the Ministr of Interior for a royal to run 
for office,

Syria-USSR: Strategic Ties 
Overshadow Economic 
Differences 
The recent Soviet delivery to Syria of the advanced 
MIG-29 fighter aircraft underscores Moscow's 
commitment to support its most important ally in the 
Middle East. But Moscow's delay in delivering the 
aircraft and the steady decrease in other arms 
shipments into 1987 highlight the problems that 
trouble this relationship. Moscow is seeking Syrian 
cooperation on regional political matters, moderation 
of Syria's offensive military posture against Israel, 
and improved Syrian arms accounting and financial 
management. Moscow's tougher stance does not mean 
weaker relations. The Soviets are committed to 
maintaining and upgrading Syrian military 
capabilities. Although Syria's payment record with 
the Soviets probably will not improve in the future, 
economic differences will remain secondary to both 
countries' need for strategic cooperation 
Massive Syrian Debt 
The Syria-USSR arms relationship is the most 
prominent aspect of their bilateral ties. Moscow has 
delivered about $14.5 billion in military equipment 
since 1980, and Soviet arms make up more than 90 
percent of the Syrian order of battle. Syria's military 
debt has ballooned, even though the Soviets probably 
have delivered some arms free of charge or as a  
partial grant in the 1980s.  
 Syria's military and 
civilian debt to the USSR exceeds $10 billion. We 
estimate the debt is about $13 billion. 
The growth in Syrian debt to the USSR is paralleled 
by a steady decline in Syria's foreign exchange 
earnings. Export proceeds fell sharply last year with 
the decline in oil prices, and expatriate remittances 
have fallen almost 70 percent since 1981 to $183 
million last year. Official transfers of hard currency, 
almost all from Saudi Arabia, have dwindled 61 
percent since 198I?to $669 million in 1986. We 
estimate Syria's current account deficit exceeded 
$550 million last year, with little prospect for a 
turnaround. 
11 
Trends in Syrian-Soviet Military Trade 
Syria has completed the enormous military buildup 
initiated following its losses in Lebanon during 1982. 
It is upgrading the quality of its equipment inventory 
and needs a large amount of materiel to sustain its 
forces. By early 1986 the flow of Soviet arms 
shipments had slowed to a trickle as compared with 
earlier years. Soviet military deliveries in 1986 
totaled $624 million, with deliveries confined mostly 
to spare parts and ammunition. We suspect that the 
hiatus was due to the completion of certain contracts 
and Damascus's inability to pay for and absorb new 
weapons. Following successful financial talks during 
Assad 's visit to Moscow in April 1987, we believe 25X1 
that Syria and the USSR cleared the way or a 
substantial increase in arms deliveries. 
25X1 
25X1 
Since the April visit, Soviet arms deliveries have 
increased. Deliveries for 1987 total more than $1.2 
billion, reflecting the shipment of 21 MIG-29 aircraft 
since last July. Moscow recently delivered to Syria 
20 SA-2 launchers, 38 self-propelled howitzers, and 
multiple rocket launchers, 
In addition to weapons purchases, the two countries 
have extensive military trade involving aircraft 
maintenance and repairs, technical assistance, and 
training. These transactions are financed by letters of 
credit payable in dollars. Many transactions involve 
shipping equipment back to the USSR for overhaul. 
Damascus must pay for these overhauls before 
Moscow will return the equipment to Syria, and 
Moscow often holds up delivery to force Syrian 
payment. For example, upon completing an overhaul 
on a military aircraft last winter, the Soviets refused 
to release the plane until Damascus paid the 
relatively small fee for the service.

Moscow recognizes that Syria's military debt to the 
USSR outstrips Damascus's ability to pay. On the 
basis of terms common in Soviet arms contracts, our 
analysis indicates that Syrian obligations falling due 
in 1987 would total more than $1.3 billion. We 
suspect, however, that special payment agreements 
negotiated over the past five years have reduced 
current obligations by about half. Regardless of the 
actual debt, we believe that Damascus has made only 
token payments on arms deliveries since 1982, 
confining payments primarily to downpayments, 
service contracts, spare parts, and technical 
assistance: 
? Our analysis indicates that Syria's cash payments to 
the USSR may have been less than $75 million

Although 
these measures will marginally relieve financial 
pressures for Damascus, debt relief mainly represents 
Moscow's recognition of Syria's virtual bankruptcy 
and dim economic prospects. 
Debt rescheduling does not eliminate near-term 
financial pressures between the two countries, and 
Damascus is finding even minor payments to the 
Soviets onerous. Syria is required to pay 
immediately?in dollars?for some military 
equipment, and we believe that some debts arising 
from Soviet economic assistance were excluded from 
the rescheduling. Moscow is pressing Damascus to 
make payments on nonrescheduled debts, 
denominated primarily in rubles, totaling the 
equivalent of more than $250 million 
Moscow Emphasizing Efficiency 
Syria's chronic financial problems have led to deeper 
Soviet interest in Syria's military procurement and  
financial management. 
13 
Syria has extensive economic relations with the 
USSR. Moscow has concentrated economic 
assistance on infrastructure projects and trade 
credits, with over $1.1 billion extended since 1981. 
Soviet assistance programs are facilitated by about 
1,000 economic advisers and technicians. 
Trade. 'Syrian civilian trade with the USSR is high, 
over $600 million in trade turnover in 1986, 
according to official Soviet statistics. Syria sells 45 
percent of its exports to Communist countries, and 
the USSR is the largest buyer of Syrian textiles, raw 
cotton, and consumer goods. Syria's civilian imports 
from the USSR?primarily machinery?make up 
about 10 percent of total imports. Syria has 
increasingly turned to Soviet and East European 
suppliers as commercial relations with the West have 
deteriorated. 
Electricity. The USSR constructed the massive 800 
MW Euphrates hydroelectric project in northern 
Syria during the mid-1970s and is planning to build 
another 64 MW hydroelectric plant downstream. 
Power generation from the Euphrates has been 
disappointing in recent years because of reduced 
waterflow and chronic technical problems. 
Hydroelectric production fell 31 percent between 
1982 and 1985. Moscow will help build the 400 MW 
Tishrin power station outside Damascus, although 
construction has not begun 
Industry. Soviet involvement in Syrian industry is 
concentrated in the oil sector. The Soviets have 
assisted the Syrian Petroleum Company in 
developing and operating Syria's older northeastern 
oilfields, which produce about 150,000 barrels per 
day of heavy crude oil. The Soviets have also 
brokered Syrian crude oil and product exports and 
are involved in natural gas development in Syria. In 
other sectors, the Soviets have promised to assist 
Syria in phosphate refining, irrigation projects, and 
food processing.

these imports threatens the armed forces' operational  
readiness. 
Outlook 
Despite recent Soviet initiatives toward other states in 
the region, Syria will remain Moscow's most 
important ally in the Middle East and receive military 
Reverse Blank 15 
and economic aid commensurate with this status. In 
our opinion, Moscow does not intend to support 
Assad's offensive concept of strategic parity, but the 
Soviets probably will help Syria keep rough 
technological pace with Israel. Although Moscow is 
troubled by Syrian difficulties in paying for military 
imports, Damascus will make little effort to boost 
payments to the Soviets. An increase in Syria's 
foreign exchange earnings will probably be devoted to 
importing essential items?such as wheat and flour?
and reducing arrearages to Western creditors. 
Damascus will count on Moscow's strategic concerns 
to override their differences and sustain the military 
relationship.

Syria's Fledgling Submarine 
Force 
Syria's three Romeo class diesel submarines?
although obsolete?provide Syria with new 
capabilities. The intelligence gathering, minelaying, 
commando insertion and over-the-horizon targeting?
capabilities are offset by the age of the submarines 
and Syria's lack of experience in submarine warfare. 
The Syrians have so far used the Romeos for crew 
training?maneuvering drills and torpedo firing?and 
as targets in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises. 
the Soviets delivered one Whiskey class 
power barge in 1985. This auxiliary generator vessel 
functions as a battery-charging station for submarines 
and cannot traverse under its own power. The 
submarines are based at Tartus, subordinate to the 
56th Coastal Defense Brigade, which controls Syria's 
southern coastal sector. 
Training Accomplished 
The Romeos have undergone three phases of 
training?routine maneuvering drills, ASW training, 
and torpedo firing?since their arrival. The 
submarine training area is offshore from Tartus. 
The Syrians began conducting routine maneuvering 
drills with the Romeos in spring 1986. 
17 
Secret 
Antisubmarine Warfare Capability 
Syria's acquisition of the Romeo has reduced its 
dependence on visiting Soviet submarines for use as 
targets during ASW training.' Syria uses the Romeos 
primarily as targets for their patrol boats and MI-14 
(Haze) helicopters that participate in the exercises. 
The exercises, while designed more to aid helicopter 
and surface ship crews, give submarine crews a 
chance to practice evasive tactics. 
The Syrian Navy's increased emphasis on ASW 
training?even during the fuel shortages caused by 
the current economic crisis?and its lack of training 
outside Syrian coastal waters, underscore the 
country's growing concern  with protecting its  
coastline from the Israelis, 
Threat to Israel 
Syria's Romeo submarines pose only a marginal 
threat to the Israelis. Any advantages?minelaying, 
commando insertion, and over-the-horizon 
targeting?that the Romeos provide the Syrian Navy 
are more than offset by the maintenance problems 
associated with older Soviet submarines, Syria's lack 
of experience in submarine warfare, and inadequate 
crew capabilities confronting the Syrian Navy. 
Potential Advantages. The Romeos' current training 
activities suggest that the Syrians hope to use the 
submarines for intelligence collection off the Israeli 
' Soviet Foxtrot or Tango class submarines regularly visit Tartus for 
30-day port calls. These port calls are for submarine maintenance 
as well as rest and relaxation for the crews. The Soviets maintain an 
Amur class submarine tender at Tartus to provide maintenance for 
the submarines.

Romeo class submarine 
coast, probably against the major 3ort and naval base 
at Haifa. This would resemble Eg:ipt's use of at least 
three of its submarines during the 1973 Arab-Israeli 
war. 
The Romeo's torpedo tubes providu the Syrians with a 
minelaying capability minesweeping is a major 
shortcoming of the Israeli navy. Tie Israelis in 
September discovered several mincs, similar to those 
being used in the Persian Gulf, off the southern coast 
of Lebanon, reinforcing the threat that mines pose to 
Israeli operations. The mines were probably laid by 
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard contingent in 
Lebanon. Syrian use of the subma -ines' minelaying 
capability would pose a severe thrc at to Israeli ports. 
Israel has no minesweepers, and submarines would be 
a particularly effective way of plarting mines, given 
the difficulty of detecting submarines in the 
Mediterranean environment.' 
The Romeos could be used in commando insertion 
and especially in over-the-horizon argeting against 
shipping, although no Syrian inten:ion to do so is 
evident. The Romeos could carry commandos to any 
part of the Israeli coast. The commandos would have 
to disembark on the surface, howeN er, rendering them 
vulnerable to Israel's strong coastal defense systems. 
" The Mediterranean basin is a congested rr ilitary and commerical 
environment in which it is difficult to distin:;uish among the 
numerous rebounding sound waves. The det:ction of sound waves is 
critical to effective antisubmarine warfare, ind a diesel-powered 
submarine operating under battery power is exiremelv hard to track 
in this environment 
Secret 
Problems. Insufficient maintenance, submarine 
warfare experience, and crew capability make it 
unlikely that the Syrian Navy could use its Romeos to 
their full potential. Moreover, the Romeo is over 25 
years old, and other nations--notably Algeria. Libya, 
and India?have experienced severe problems with 
old Soviet submarines. Such problems greatly reduce 
the threat posed to the Israelis by the Syrian 
submarines. 
Historically, the Syrian Navy has been a neglected 
part of Syria's military and only recently has received 
greater attention because of increased emphasis on 
coastal defense. We expect that Syrian progress in 
overcoming past neglect and developing experienced 
crews will be slow. The Syrians are far less 
experienced in submarine warfare than the Israelis, 
who have possessed their Gal class submarines for 15 
years.

Secret 
Are They a Steppingstone? 
We believe the acquisition of the Romeos, although a 
boost to the Syrian Navy, represents only a transition 
in the development of a submarine force. 
The Foxtrot and Kilo classes?especially the Kilo?
are more modern and would increase the Syrian naval 
threat to Israel. The Kilo is much quieter than the 
Romeo and Foxtrot and is equipped with more 
advanced weapon systems?such as wire-guided 
torpedos and better sonar, capable of detecting 
submarines over a longer distance and wider range of 
frequencies. 
We believe the Israeli navy could cope with any 
Romeos or newer submarines that the Syrians might 
acquire. Israel's planned acquisition of advanced 
submarines and corvettes over the next decade will 
make it even more difficult for Syria to catch up to 
Israel's submarine warfare experience and skill.

Soviet, Cuban, and East European 
Support to the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Army 
The Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
receives most of its foreign assistance from Ethiopia, 
but the Ethiopian assistance, in our view, is heavily 
dependent on materiel supplied to Addis Ababa by 
the Soviet Union. It is augmented by support from 
Cuba and some East European countries. The Soviets 
provide arms and ammunition to the Ethiopians who 
transfer the equipment to the insurgents. Soviet 
advisers in the Gambela region of Ethiopia?the hub 
of SPLA training and logistic activities?do not 
supervise or support SPLA training directly, but 
Cuban advisers in Gambela assist Ethiopian military 
personnel in the training of SPLA troops. Havana also 
provides SPLA cadres with military training in Cuba 
and aids SPLA medical, communications, and 
propaganda efforts. Some East European countries 
provide arms, ammunition, and specialized training to 
the SPLA 
We believe the rebels 
are responsible for training their forces inside Sudan. 
Foreign military advisers probably avoid support to 
the SPLA inside Sudan to reduce the possibility of 
capture?either dead or alive?by government forces, 
which would jeopardize plausible denial. 
In our view, foreign military support contributes 
significantly to the insurgents' military effectiveness. 
In addition, Communist military training of SPLA 
members probably increases the number of Marxists 
within the movement. Training programs for SPLA 
troops in Cuba and Eastern Europe probably include 
intense political indoctrination, and some will return 
home to indoctrinate other SPLA members. 
Soviet Assistance 
We believe the bulk of equipment given to the SPLA 
comes from Soviet-stocked Ethiopian inventories.  
The Soviet Union may use intermediaries to supply 
weapons to the SPLA. In January 1987, the Soviets 
paid India hard currency to supply and ship to 
Ethiopia older surplus arms? including rifles, pistols, 
handgrenades, mortars, artillery pieces, and 
ammunition. The Ethiopeans then provided the  
weapons to the SPLA  
The Soviets probably maintain limited contacts with 
SPLA officials in Addis Ababa. 
Cuban Support 
Ethiopia provides most of the military training given 
to SPLA recruits in Ethiopia, but Cuba also provides 
advisory assistance

Cuba is probably advanced or specialized  
Havana also provides military training to SPLA 
troops in Cuba.  
? Senior SPLA officers generally are selected for 
training abroad, 
? A high-level SPLA official said in August 1987 that 
1,200 SPLA cadres have been trained or are being 
trained by the Cubans, with a "second wave" of 
cadres to be sent, according to the US Embassy in 
Addis Ababa. 
Cuba probably provides some materiel assistance to 
the SPLA, but we believe that most of the arms and 
ammunition given to the insurgents comes from 
Ethiopian inventories. 
Havana is also contributing to the SPLA's 
propaganda effort.

Effects of Foreign Military Assistance 
In our view, foreign military assistance has 
significantly contributed to the SPLA's military 
effectiveness. Although the insurgency probably 
would continue without external support given 
fundamental southern political grievances against the 
government in Khartoum, we believe the conflict's 
intensity would be appreciably lower 
We continue to believe that the SPLA under Garang's 
leadership has a loosely defined socialist political 
agenda. Over the long term, however, continued 
foreign training and political indoctrination of SPLA 
cadres could nurture a Marxist bloc within the SPLA. 
This group could effectively challenge Garang's 
leadership or force him to adopt a more radical leftist 
political agenda. 
 Ethiopia and the Soviet Union are concerned that 
the SPLA might turn to the West if it became more  
autonomous.

Egypt: Courting Ethio la?
At Least for Now 
Egyptian policymakers are increasing emphasis on 
improving relations with Ethiopia. After decades of 
acrimonious relations dating back to the days of Nasir 
and Haile Selassie, the Egyptians recently have 
engineered a series of high-level contacts to improve 
the bilateral atmosphere and engage Ethiopian 
leaders on issues of mutual concern. Substantive 
achievements, however, have been minimal and are 
likely to fall short of Cairo's expectations. 
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Berhanu's official visit to 
Cairo last January?the first by a policy-level 
Ethiopian since the 1974 revolution?was viewed by 
Egyptians as an important signal of Ethiopian 
willingness to improve relations, despite the absence 
of results. Since then, Ethiopian President Mengistu 
has paid an official visit to Cairo (April 1987), and 
Egyptian President Mubarak has journeyed twice to 
Addis Ababa to meet with Mengistu during the 
Organization of African Unity summit meeting (July) 
and Ethiopia's Republic Day celebrations 
(September). 
Although the atmosphere has been generally positive, 
President Mubarak appears to be seeking more than 
his Ethiopian counterpart is willing to deliver. A few 
minor trade and technical agreements have been 
signed, but several had been on the books?and 
ignored?for years. Despite Egypt's eagerness for 
better ties, President Mengistu appears intent on 
extracting substantive offers from Mubarak without 
offering anything in return. In particular Ethiopia 
seems determined to drag its feet on the issues of 
greatest Egyptian concern?the Nile and Sudan. 
Egyptian Interests 
Recent Egyptian overtures toward Ethiopia reflect 
growing frustration in Cairo with the political turmoil 
and vacillating leadership in Sudan and an awareness 
that Addis Ababa holds the key to progress on Egypt's 
two most pressing regional concerns. 
25 
The Nile. Egyptian officials believe Ethiopia's use of 
water from the Nile?Egypt's lifeline?will be a key 
issue for the next two decades 
Ethiopia controls the headwaters of 
the Blue Nile, which supplies over 80 percent of 
Egypt's water, and Cairo feels profoundly threatened 
by occasional reports that Addis Ababa is planning 
upstream dam projects. 
Sudan. Cairo is concerned with stability in war-torn 
Sudan and seeks Ethiopian help in arranging a 
rapprochement between the Sudanese Government 
and Ethiopian-backed rebel forces led by Col. John 
Garang, A peaceful 
resolution to differences between Ethiopia and Sudan 
could eliminate external support for the insurgency 
and enable Egypt's southern neighbor to focus on 
pressing internal political and economic problems. For 
Egypt, an end to the insurgency would permit 
construction to resume on the 425-kilometer Jonglei 
canal in southern Sudan, which is designed to increase 
waterflow in the White Nile. 
Egypt seeks to wean Mengistu from his Soviet patrons 
and prod him toward a more independent foreign 
policy. 
Cairo is using its overtures to Addis Ababa?a Soviet 
ally?as evidence to counter Soviet complaints that 
Egypt is interested only in supporting US positions on 
international issues, 
The Sudan Factor 
Mubarak's most immediate purpose in mending 
fences with Mengistu is to put pressure on Sudanese 
Prime Minister Sadiq al Mahdi to begin dealing

constructively with Sudan's problems. Mubarak's 
courtship of Ethiopia has intensified as his distrust of 
Sadiq has deepened over the past few months.  
Mubarak as Peacemaker? 
To help restore Egyptian influence in Khartoum and 
bring Sudanese policy into line with Egyptian 
objectives, Mubarak is attempting to play the role of 
regional peacemaker by getting himself invited to 
mediate between Addis Ababa and Khartoum,  
Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan remain 
strained. Addis Ababa is the main benefactor of 
Col. John Garang's Sudanese People's Liberation 
Army in its insurgency against the Khartoum 
government, and it is fueling the war by giving the 
rebels access to bases, financial aid, logistic support, 
training, and materiel, 
The Ethiopians have no incentive 
to stop backing the Sudanese insurgents as long as 
Khartoum supports Ethiopian dissident groups from 
Eritrea and provides safehaven to their leaders. 
A peacemaking role would help Egypt project its 
influence in Sub-Saharan Africa?a key foreign 
policy objective for the past several years since Egypt 
was formally ostracized from the Arab world after 
signing the Camp David accord. Reporting from the 
US Embassy in Cairo suggests, however, that 
Mubarak's aims in this instance are modest. Egypt 
wants to get the talks started but apparently has not 
devised a subsequent strategy. 
Mubarak has virtually no leverage over either Sudan 
or Ethiopia, and we believe the distrust between all 
Secret 
three parties is certain to doom his efforts, at least in 
the near term: 
? Neither Mengistu nor Sadiq wants Mubarak to 
mediate, 
Mengistu fears such involvement would increase 
Egyptian influence in Sudan. 
? In our view, neither Sadiq nor Mengistu believes a 
bilateral meeting between them would settle  
Ethiopian-Sudanese differences. 
? Both Mubarak and Mengistu appear to be joining 
against Sadiq to insist that he make the first moves 
toward peace, 
This collaboration is certain to discourage 
initiatives from Khartoum. 
Outlook: Too Many Obstacles to Progress 
Prospects for improvement in Egyptian-Ethiopian ties 
appear to be as limited as Mengistu's goals for the 
relationship. The long legacy of coolness will be 
difficult to overcome. By responding to Egypt's 
courtship, Mengistu may have realized his most 
immediate aim?a partial reversal of Addis Ababa's 
increasing isolation in the region?
Despite the improved atmosphere, 
little of substance has come out of bilateral contacts

beyond minor trade and technical agreements, which 
appear unlikely to be fulfilled. 
More important, Mengistu seems unwilling to offer 
anything beyond vague promises on the Nile and 
Sudan. Addis Ababa will brush aside Egyptian 
invitations to join the multilateral Undugu group of 
Nile Basin countries, viewing it as a veiled front for 
Egyptian and Zairian political aspirations and of no 
benefit to Ethiopia.' Because Ethiopia is the most 
important upstream Nile state, Addis Ababa believes 
it would be in a weak negotiating position on major 
water issues at Undugu meetings and would bear the

Egypt, for its part, appears unwilling to change 
dramatically its policy of support for Eritrean 
insurgents?a longstanding Ethiopian demand. The 
' Undugu (Swahili for brotherhood) is a loose grouping of Nile 
Valley countries and others that benefit indirectly from the river, 
including Egypt, Sudan, Uganda, Zaire, Rwanda, Kenya,

North Yemeni-Libyan 
Relations: A Tactical 
Rapprochement 
The warming trend in North Yemeni-Libyan 
relations appears to be based primarily on tactical 
considerations. From the perspective of North 
Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih, Libyan 
military and economic assistance has provided the 
beleaguered North Yemeni Government a much 
needed shot in the arm. Libyan leader Qadhafi's 
interest in the relationship is to reduce his isolation, 
gain support for Libya's war with Chad, and 
undermine US influence in the region. Salih is 
concerned about US and Western reactions to his 
flirtation with Tripoli, but he apparently has decided 
that the tangible benefits of closer ties outweigh the 
political costs. In our judgment, relations will improve 
in the near term, but the longer term outlook will be 
troubled by recurring political differences and the 
volatility of Qadhafi's foreign policy. 
North Yemen is caught between the conflicting 
interests of the United States?on which it relies to 
balance Soviet and Saudi influence in North 
Yemen?and Libya, from which it receives needed 
economic assistance and military cooperation. Salih 
does not want to offend the United States and 
generally tries to minimize his relationship with 
Qahdafi. But Salih is obligated to Qadhafi for his 
assistance and will respond to Libyan requests, 
sometimes at the expense of US interests. 
The value President Salih places on his relationship 
with Libya was demonstrated by his emphasis on 
Libyan matters in September, during talks with the 
US delegation to North Yemen's National Day 
celebrations, which were partly financed by Libya. 
Over the past year Tripoli's assistance has been one of 
the few bright spots for Salih's regime: 
? Unable to secure Saudi backing for his policy 
toward Aden, Salih accepted a Libyan offer to 
provide economic and military support for the more 
than 30,000 exiles who fled to North Yemen with 
deposed South Yemeni President Ali Nasir after the 
coup in Aden in January 1986. 
29 
A Case Study in North Yemeni-Libyan Relations 
North Yemen's handling of the Libyan-sponsored 
assassination attempt against an American employee 
of the US Embassy in Sanaa in April 1986 
exemplifies how Sanaa manages its relations with 
Tripoli. Less than a week after the US air raid on 
Tripoli, the US Embassy in Sanaa reported that 
unknown assailants opened fire on a US diplomatic 
vehicle driven by a US Embassy communicator. The 
communicator sustained three bullet wounds in the 
head and shoulder. 
According to the Embassy, the North Yemenis 
suspected Libyan complicity in the attack. 
within a week, North 
Yemeni security arrested a Lebanese Shia whom they 
suspected of organizing the attack.  
Members of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine were also detained 
under suspicion of carrying out the attack. Despite 
repeated attempts by the US Embassy to obtain the 
facts of the case, the North Yemenis refused to 
confirm Libyan involvement and tried to place the 
blame for the attack on agents of the South Yemeni 
Government. North Yemeni officials promised the US 
Ambassador to increase security for all US officials 
and their dependents. 
Meanwhile, Salih dispatched his Foreign Minister to 
Tripoli to confront the Libyans.

Secret 
? Tripoli helped to fill the gap when Riyadh failed to 
deliver promised economic assistance and cut oil 
shipments to force Salih to negotiate contentious 
border issues. Libya is providing North Yemen with 
at least 15,000 barrels of oil per day?
approximately half its domestic requirement?
with Scud tactical 
missiles and SA-6 surface-to-air missiles after the 
Soviets rebuffed Sanaa's request for advanced 
weapon systems late last year. At least 200 North 
Yemeni troops are in Libya receiving training on 
these systems, which Sanaa expects to receive 
within six months 
North Yemeni Motivations: A Quick Fix 
In our judgment, Salih believes that Libyan economic 
and military aid?in the absence of Saudi economic 
assistance and declining US aid?has played a pivotal 
role in shoring up the troubled Sanaa government. 
Salih's inability to satisfy popular expectations raised 
by the prospects of oil revenues or to resolve North 
Yemen's troubled relations with its neighbors and the 
USSR has begun to alienate key constituencies, such 
as the military and the tribes. Libyan military 
assistance has helped to satisfy Salih's critics within 
the defense establishment 
Salih's relations with Libya have helped to further his 
limited arms diversification program designed to 
reduce North Yemen's dependence on direct Soviet 
military assistance and advisers. Libya has been 
Salih's only significant source of arms outside the 
Soviet Union since the civil war in South Yemen in 
January 1986. 
From North Yemen's perspective, Salih's 
reciprocation for Libyan aid has been relatively 
modest. Salih has: 
? Provided limited military and diplomatic support to 
Libya's campaign in Chad. 
Secret 
25X1 
Apparently at 
Qadhafi's request, Salih has raised with US and 
French officials the issue of their countries' support 
for Chad, urging them to rein in President Habre. 
? Approached the United States and Iraq on Tripoli's 
behalf with offers to mediate their differences with 
Libya. 
? Apparently agreed to act as middleman for Libyan 
arms purchases. 
? Allowed the Libyans to meet with representatives of 
African dissident groups on North Yemeni soil. 
? Mediated between Libya and Egypt over the return 
of a Libyan C-130 transport aircraft and its crew 
after the pilot and copilot defected in early 1987. 
Libyan Motivations: Increased Influence 
Libyan leader Qadhafi's interest in North Yemen 
dovetails with broader policy objectives in the Arab 
world. Qadhafi's repeated attempts since June 1986 to 
mediate the repatriation of the South Yemeni exiles 
in North Yemen reflect his desire to reduce his 
isolation and gain a leadership role in the Arab world. 
His provision of arms to the exiles and economic and 
military assistance to North Yemen is part of an 
effort to gain leverage with both parties. Qadhafi 
almost certainly hopes to use this leverage to draw 
North Yemen away from the United States. He 
probably is attracted by North Yemen's proximity to 
Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, and Somalia, periodic targets 
of Libyan subversion. 
The North Yemeni?Libya relationship has provided 
important opportunities for Qadhafi: 
? Salih's visit to Libya in the summer of 1986, the 
first by a head of state following the US airstrike in 
April, helped ease Qadhafi's concern about 
international isolation.

Secret 
? North Yemeni support for his war with Chad will 
ease the combat burden on Libyan forces and 
possibly reduce domestic political pressures. 
? Visits to North Yemen by low-level Libyan officials 
and representatives of the revolutionary 
committees?one of Qadhafi's key domestic support 
groups?provide a safety valve against domestic 
discontent by giving the Libyan Government the 
appearance of acceptance in the Arab world. 
? Yemeni intercession with Baghdad probably was a 
factor in the restoration of Libyan-Iraqi relations 
last month 
In Qadhafi's view, the military and economic aid 
provided to Sanaa is a low-cost way of obtaining 
Yemeni support. The tanks and other military 
equipment given by Tripoli constitute only a small 
fraction of Libya's inventory. Even the provision of a 
limited number of Scud surface-to-surface missiles 
will not diminish Libyan military capabilities. Libyan 
economic and technical aid, particularly oil, is 
affordable?the Libyan oil industry is operating at 
less than full capacity. 
Prospects for the Relationship 
The short-term prospects for the relationship between 
North Yemen and Libya appear to be good. Inside 
North Yemen the impetus for pursuing the 
relationship comes from Salih, and there is no  
evidence of leadership discord on this issue.  
The outlook for the long-term relationship is less 
positive. North Yemeni-Libyan relations traditionally 
have been characterized by deep mistrust, and, 
despite the upswing in bilateral activity, considerable 
mutual suspicion is evident. Salih suspects that 
Qadhafi will back North Yemeni dissidents, 
particularly the Nasirist-oriented 13 June movement 
to which Qadhafi has close ties. Moreover, Qadhafi 
may worry that North Yemen will use Tripoli to get 
assistance but will suspend political support for 
Tripoli's foreign policy 
Secret 
We believe that Salih is aware of the risks he faces in 
dealing with Qadhafi. Tripoli has a history of 
meddling in North Yemen's internal affairs, including 
support for coup attempts in 1978 and 1982 and 
substantial backing for the South Yemeni?sponsored 
National Democratic Front insurgency from 1979 to 
1982. 
In our judgment, Salih cannot satisfy the mercurial 
Libyan leader indefinitely. Salih's efforts to placate 
Qadhafi last month by sending several hundred South 
Yemeni military exiles to Tripoli appear to have been 
inadequate. 
In addition, Salih's relationship with Libya 
undoubtedly will cause him further problems with 
Saudi Arabia. According to the US Embassy in 
Riyadh, the Saudis have expressed displeasure over 
the improvement in North Yemeni?Libyan ties, citing 
it as a factor in their growing irritation with Salih. 
In response to these and other concerns, Salih has 
tried to limit the Libyan role in his country. Salih has 
refused Libyan offers to deploy a training brigade to  
North Yemen. 
Implications for the United States 
Salih will seek to assure Washington that his 
relationship with Libya will not harm US interests. 
Nonetheless, Salih is likely to weigh US aid and 
support against that from Libya and conclude that the 
Libyan connection offers more tangible benefits. To

Secret 
Threat to US Security 
Threats to US security are unlikely to increase 
dramatically because of closer ties between Libya 
and North Yemen. Despite the Libyan-sponsored 
shooting of a US Embassy employee in Sanaa in the 
immediate aftermath of the US airstrike in April 
1986, Libya is unlikely to use North Yemen as a  
venue for attacks on US personnel and facilities. 
The 
difficult operating environment and minimal anti-US 
sentiment prevent Libya from implementing its 
preferred course of action?exploiting domestic 
radicals to promote attacks on US interests. 
Furthermore, North Yemen will carefully monitor its 
relations with Libya to ensure that Tripoli?
emboldened by its closer relationship with Sanaa?
will not be tempted to resume meddling in domestic 
Yemeni affairs or to conduct operations against its  
enemies on North Yemeni soil. 
demonstrate his evenhandedness, Salih can be 
expected to offer to mediate between Washington and 
Tripoli. 
Over the longer term, US?North Yemeni ties will not 
suffer serious dislocation, if only because Salih 
recognizes the value of US economic and oil 
development aid and limited military assistance. His 
relationship with the United States will seem even 
more valuable as his association with Qadhafi loses its 
luster. Salih will appreciate the role the United States 
plays as a counterweight to the Soviet presence in 
North Yemen and as a sympathetic voice in dealings 
with the Saudis.

The Maghreb: Travels Through 
the Bled 1 
The strongest impression of the Bled is the 
unfavorable contrast of Algeria's agriculture with 
that of Morocco and Tunisia.' In our view, the 
problems result mainly from a lack of adequate 
economic incentives for individuals to produce 
efficiently. We believe Algeria's problems in the rural 
sector present a long-term threat to the country's 
stability.

on the smaller farms. There are ample roads to move 
produce, but road quality varies widely. Traffic?even 
on the main highways of each country?is congested 
with farm vehicles and livestock. 
A Closer Look

Secret 
Only in Algeria Do the Fish Die of Old Age 
The official exchange rate?about 5 dinars to the 
dollar?is artificially high and leads to many efforts 
to obtain hard currency. For example, Algerian 
fishermen often officially report small catches of  fish  
despite the abundance of fish in Algerian waters. 
far more fish are caught than are 
reported, but the fishermen sell them at sea to 
Europeans for hard currency. Algerians note with 
tongue in cheek that, since the fish are not caught, 
many must die of old age. They add that neighboring 
countries that have fewer trade restrictions do not 
have such long-lived fish. Further, hotels in Algiers 
that are frequented by foreigners often will not accept 
payment in Algerian money?hard currency must be 
used. The Soviet Embassy and Consulate are 
required to pay their telephone bills in dollars 
because rubles are not considered hard currency.

strong economic incentive to work hard. In contrast, 
agriculture in Tunisia and Morocco is mainly in 
private hands, and owners have much more incentive. 
Lack of incentive appears to have caused Algerian 
farmers not to use productive techniques that are

Secret 
The Broader Ramifications 
Socialized agriculture has converted Algeria from a 
net food exporter at independence to a country that 
imports about 60 percent of its food. Domestically 
produced food is high priced?
watermelons cost more than twice the US price, and 
meat cost about $22 a kilogram. Flowers and luxur 
food items not available in Algeria but 
frequently in Tunisia and Morocco. Although 
no starvation or severe malnutrition, the high cost of 
living and shortages almost certainly contribute to a 
budding security problem in the Algerian countryside. 
For example  
dozens of people occupying moderate-size apartments, 
and garbage-strewn streets. 
the high frequency of robbery on the 
trains. US diplomats in Oran report a growing danger 
of highway robbery on the heights above Oran and 
Mers el Kebir. Gangs of youths have been known to 
steal everything from motorists, including the clothes 
they were wearing. 
Declining standards of living in rural areas have 
contributed to a flow of people into the cities. About 
60 percent of Algeria's population live in cities, and 
the rate of urbanization is above 5 percent per year?
both the highest figures in the Maghreb. Conditions 
in the cities are deteriorating as a result of high rural-
to-urban migration. Oran, the second largest city and 
once the most European, is a case in point. After 
independence, the government greatly reduced rent in 
buildings that had been owned by Europeans and 
placed almost no restrictions on the number of people 
that could move in. Nearly three decades of rent 
control have resulted in the "ruralization" of the city, 
including a noticeable deterioration of buildings, 
37 
former peasants in an apartment building 
kept roosters and chickens in their apartments for 
food. 
The Slow Pace of Reform 
Algerian President Bendjedid appears determined to 
correct rural economic problems by breaking up state 
farms and promoting private farming. In our view, 
when private farms are established and allowed to 
compete freely, productivity will increase. Progress 
will be slow because Bendjedid is meeting serious 
resistance in the ruling party and the bureaucracy. 
We believe the slow pace and incomplete nature of the 
reforms will contribute to the failure of many of the 
first private farms. For example, one family of 
entrepreneurs is eager to launch a 
poultry farm. Although the ownership will be private, 
the farm cannot compete effectively with state 
enterprises. All equipment and supplies must be 
bought from state monopolies and all products sold at 
prices set by the state. 
For the short term, most Algerians are likely to view 
the state as a source of economic frustration. 
Algerians with money to spend often find nothing 
suitable to buy in Algeria and prefer to shop in 
Tunisia or Morocco. On their way home they are 
frequently stopped at roadblocks where the police 
perform customs duties.

Iraq: Impressions of 
Al Basrah 
The Decline of a Great City 
Our guide, a native of Al Basrah, regaled us with 
stories of his home city's past glories. He claimed that 
Al Basrah had been Iraq's most important city in 
recent times, larger than Baghdad and more 
cosmopolitan. Baghdad had always been isolated from 
foreign influences, while Al Basrah had been Iraq's 
window to the world. He pointed out one massive new 
industrial installation after another, all built before 
the war and intended to give the Al Basrah region a 
great industrial future. None were in use. 
We entered the city at a portentous moment. On 29 
August, the Iraqis resumed their airstrikes against 
targets in the Persian Gulf for the first time since the 
middle of July. There had been much speculation over 
the Iranian response to this resumed campaign?in 
particular whether the Iranians would launch missile 
attacks against Baghdad. Instead, the Iranians 
responded with heavy shelling of Al Basrah and its 
environs. 
We found ourselves caught in the middle of this 
barrage. We were told that on the previous two days 
1,356 shells had hit the city-39 people had died and 
200 were injured on 2 September. The reason for the 
high number of casualties, we were informed, was 
targeting of the city's new residential areas. For the 
first time, Iranian shells had fallen much further to 
the west, especially northwest of Al Basrah. Although 
the central city had been almost abandoned earlier in 
the year, most resisdents of the sprawling 
northwestern suburbs had remained, hoping that they 
were beyond range. Beginning on 1 September, their 
hopes proved to be wrong. 
' This article is based on a dispatch from the US Embassy in 
Baghdad describing a visit to Al Basrah in early September by two 
US Government officials and their assessment of the effects of the 
Iran-Iraq war on Iraq's once leading port and second largest city, 
with a population of about 450,000. 
39 
The Hospital: Impassive Faces and Death 
The bloody impact of the previous two days' shelling 
was evident in our first stop, Al Basrah's Republican 
Hospital. As we entered the sprawling, dilapidated 
hospital compound, a corpse was casually being 
wheeled out into the hot sun by an impassive young 
woman. We were escorted into two of the hospital's 
main wards. One was for women and children, and 
one was for men. Each had about 35 beds with victims 
from the previous two days. There was an element of 
theater in our visit, as we were closely pursued by a 
television cameraman. The wounds, however, were 
real, and the accompanying doctors insisted on 
showing us every detail. Most of the patients had 
shrapnel wounds in their legs or arms, broken bones, 
or abdominal injuries caused by shrapnel and 
concussion. There was little anger or emotion in their 
faces. Most patients seemed passive and fatalistic. 
Some spoke matter-of-factly about the simultaneous 
death of a wife, child, or grandparent, as if it were a 
daily and expected occurrence. 
The medical care was adequate under the 
circumstances. The doctors were articulate and 
seemed competent. The sheets, however, were dirty 
and sometimes bloody. Cats wandered around, and 
the wards were full of flies. There was an obvious lack 
of staff, and the doctors explained that most of the so-
called nurses were local female volunteers. One young 
doctor claimed he and his family had been assigned to 
this hospital at the beginning of the war, although he 
and his faimily reside in Baghdad. He had been 
unable to obtain reassignment. There was a lack of 
privacy for the patients, who obviously could not 
prevent our intrusion. They were under instructions to 
respond to our questions, and their responses had 
much the same ring. When the bombs fell, they had 
been minding their business, sitting in their houses, or 
walking to their cars.

Secret 
As we left the hospital, a car careened up with its 
windows blown out. A woman in black painfully 
emerged from the passenger side, evidently injured. 
We learned that injured persons typically have to find 
their way to the hospitals, either driving themselves or 
relying on their neighbors for transportation. Many 
people have to wait hours before getting to the 
hospital. There is no system to check for injured 
people after shells fall. (Looting has been heavy in Al 
Basrah, some of it by soldiers. Civil defense units have 
become leery of searching bombed areas for fear of 
being accused of looting.) 
A Deserted City 
After leaving the hospital, we drove straight across 
town to the Shatt al Arab near the Sheraton Hotel. 
This distance of about 3 kilometers was almost 
deserted. It is obvious that Al Basra has become a 
ghost town, especially the section near the Corniche. 
There was no traffic on the streets, except a few 
scurrying military vehicles. There was none of the 
usual evidence of human habitation, such as children 
playing in the streets, clothes hanging out to dry, 
merchants in small shops, women huddled with 
women, or men chatting. 
There was some destruction in the central city but not 
as much as one would expect. We passed a large 
mosque and a church, both of which had been shelled 
the previous day, but this was not obvious until it had 
been pointed out. The Sheraton, on the Corniche, was 
also a surprise. The hotel had a fair number of holes 
in it, but there was no major destruction evident. 
Much of the destruction did not result from the war?
as is typical of Iraqi cities. The authorities have 
intentionally destroyed many of the city's mud and 
lattice-work houses to rebuild them in modern 
cement. The destruction, which has been carried 
much further in other Iraqi cities, has been frozen in 
Al Basrah. Most of the new cement structures have 
yet to be constructed. On the other hand, we noticed 
numerous holes and pitting, the obvious result of 
shelling. 
Secret 
When we stopped at the Corniche, there was a lull in 
the shelling. Soldiers behind sandbags along the 
Corniche had been lying down in the heat of the day 
and roused themselves from their torpor. The 
Corniche was lined with date palms. Across the Shatt 
the palm groves showed few signs of destruction?
although we knew that the eastern part of the city 
must be in worse shape than the western part. Except 
for the quiet and the fact that some of the ships in the 
Shatt were upturned and sunken, Al Basrah still had 
the appearance of a great port. There are large 
numbers of oceangoing vessels trapped at the quays 
that have been there throughout the war. 
The Shelling Gets Too Near 
We sped from the Corniche northwest through the 
deserted city. Distant shelling could be heard, 
mounting in frequency. We passed ship after ship 
moored along the old quays. We stopped at the only 
functioning hotel, the Shatt at Arab Hotel, which also 
serves as the airline terminal for the Al Basrah 
airport. We toured the hotel, where we had 
reservations for the night, and observed a board 
displaying the photographs of dead soldiers who had 
served in the airport unit. 
We lunched at the Navy Club, a modern building 
extending over the Shatt with an impressive view of 
the ships trapped in port. The club had taken no direct 
hits, but two military vehicles in the parking lot had 
been hit on the previous day, we were told. The 
shelling became increasingly frequent at two- to five-
minute intervals and came closer to our location. 
Midway through the lunch a couple of shells landed 
near enough to rattle the windows of the club and 
nearly lifted us out of our seats. We made clear that 
we had no desire to leave directly for Baghdad, but 
our entreaties to return to the center of the city fell on 
deaf ears. We spent the night at the home of our guide 
about 25 kilometers west of Al Basrah.

Ash Shariqah: Iran's Trojan Horse 
in the United Arab Emirates 
Although many of the seven emirates in the United

Shariqah?the third largest emirate?is most 
vulnerable to Iranian pressure and sabotage. The 
ruler's close personal ties to Tehran, Ash Shariqah's

Moreover, there are 3,000 to 4,000 Iranian Shias 
resident in the Emirate. Tehran has tried to exploit 
this relationship over the years to increase its foothold 
in the Persian Gulf. Concern among UAE leaders 
over close ties between Ash Shariqah and Iran was an 
underlying factor in the attempted coup last June. 
Security Threat 
Iran is Ash Shariqah's principal security threat. 
Natives of the Emirate have always been wary of 
Iranian intentions, and the Iranian occupation of Abu 
Musa Island in 1971?an island claimed by both?
typified, in Ash Shariqah's view, Tehran's aggressive 
policy toward the emirate. Since then, Iran has 
demonstrated little willingness to respect the emirate's 
sovereignty. Most recently, Iran disregarded its 
promise not to use Abu Musa for military purposes, 
launching helicopters and small boat attacks from 
there on shipping in the southern Gulf. According to 
the US Embassy, in mid-October Iran delivered 
additional military equipment to Abu  Musa, 
including tanks and possibly artillery. 
Although Ash Shariqah's resident Iranian population 
does not constitute a direct threat, it provides 
substantial cover for Iranian-sponsored activities. 
41 
pro-
Iranian sentiment appears to be increasing in Ash 
Shariqah's eight Shia husayniyyas?gathering places 
for informal religious discussions. Several 
husayniyyas are highly politicized, and virtually every 
sermon is supportive of Iran. 
local security services were especially concerned that 
Iranian activists at the husayniyyas would incite 
demonstrations during the celebrations of Muharram 
last September. The US Embassy reports that, 
although Ash Shariqah's policy has been to avoid 
promoting husayniyyas, the government has tolerated 
their presence as a way to channel the activities of the 
Shia religious community. 
Ash Shariqah, with its permeable borders and 
inadequate security forces, is ill equipped to cope with 
the Iranian threat. Although the emirate maintains a 
1,600-man military force, it depends heavily on the 
Abu Dhabi- controlled federal security apparatus for 
protection against external aggression and subversion. 
According to the US Embassy, senior emirate 
officials assert that Abu Dhabi does not provide Ash 
Shariqah with adequate resources to deal with threats 
to its security. For example, it had to rely on Dubayy's 
police force to identify and surveil Iranians suspected 
of subversive activities in 1985. But Dubayy's force at 
times is overburdened with its own concerns and is not 
a reliable source of protection for Ash Shariqah.

Economic Ties 
Since 1974 Ash Shariqah and Iran have shared the 
revenues from the Mubarak oilfield adjacent to Abu 
Musa Island. Ash Shariqah has retained 
responsibility for operating the field and for all 
decisionmaking. The US Embassy reports that the 
emirate coordinates major decisions with a group of 
Iranian technical experts and probably defers to 
Iranian views on production policy. Mubarak

production peaked about 10 years ago at 65,000 
barrels per day. Current output is about 5,000 barrels 
per day. 
Over the past year Iran has taken steps to regularize 
its contacts with Ash Shariqah over the Mubarak 
oilfield. According to the US Embassy, Tehran 
maintained a permanent group of technical experts 
who dealt routinely with Ash Shariqah before the 
Irani-an revolution. Last March, Ash Shariqah and 
Iran agreed to establish a permanent committee to 
collaborate on technical and policy matters affecting 
oil and  gas production in the fields near Abu Musa 
Island. 
Iran's renewed interest may be partly related to the 
discovery of a large gas condensate reservoir beneath 
the Mubarak oilfield early this year, according to the 
US Embassy. The Iranians have not been pleased 
with Ash Shariqah's tendency to pump oil too fast?
depleting reservoir pressure?or to overproduce the 
field. Moreover, the Iranians believe that Ash 
Shariqah's development of this new discovery is 
cutting into their profits. By setting up a permanent 
committee, Tehran probably hopes to get greater 
control over the new discovery before Ash  Shariqah 
squanders its wealth. 
Ash Shariqah and Iran have additional economic ties 
apart from the shared Mubarak oilfield. The 
emirate's primary export market is jran, with exports 
totaling at least $50 million in 1986;Trade is handled 
almost exclusively by dhows that sail between Ash 
Shariqah and Bandar-e Abbas. The emirate places 
virtually no restrictions on nonmilitary goods to Iran, 
These dhows carry 
mainly foodstuffs and consumer goods?items that 
command high prices in Iran because they are in short 
supply. Occasionally cars or light trucks have been 
seen on the docks, according to the US Embassy. Ash 
Shariqah also serves as an important airlink to Iran, 
particularly in cargo service, with two passenger and 
four cargo flights weekly. 
In addition, Iran maintains several business 
establishments that facilitate Tehran's overseas 
activities and its acquisition of much needed technical 
equipment and foreign currency, according to US 
Secret 
Embassy reporting. Iran's national oil company 
maintains a small equipment purchasing office in Ash 
Shariqah that is staffed by Iranian Government 
officials. Two of Iran's larger commercial banks, 
Bank Melli and Bank Saderat Iran, have offices in  
Ash Shariqah. 
Palace Connections 
Shaykh Sultan bin Muhammad al-Qasimi, ruler of 
Ash Shariqah, has carried his emirate's close 
relationship with Iran beyond what mere pragmatism 
requires, according to the US Embassy. Known as the 
maverick among UAE leaders, Sultan has fancied 
himself a close friend of Iran and even tried to 
represent himself as one who could negotiate with 
Iran to help end the Iran-Iraq war. He planned a trip 
to Iran in 1986 for that purpose, which for an 
unknown reason never took place. UAE watchers 
suspect that Federation President Zayid strongly 
reminded Sultan that such efforts should come from 
the President's office only. 
Sultan's ties to Iran have created concern among the 
UAE leadership and probably were an important 
factor behind the attempted coup in June. The US 
Embassy reports that Abd al Aziz al-Qasimi?
Sultan's older brother who attempted the coup on 17 
June?believes Iran's long-term policy has been to 
penetrate the UAE through Ash Shariqah, and 
Tehran has chosen his brother Sultan as their 
surrogate. Rumors have circulated in the UAE that 
Sultan had developed direct links to senior Iranian 
officials without federal approval and that Zayid 
strongly disapproved such contacts. Abd al Aziz also 
alleged to US Embassy officials that indications of 
Sultan's favor for the Iranians included: 
? Sultan tried to ignore and then hide the arms cache 
and terrorist cells that were discovered in Ash 
Shariqah in 1985.

Secret 
? Sultan has not insisted that Iran abide by its 
promise not to use Abu Musa Island, allowing Iran 
unbridled access to the island. 
? Two Iranian banks suddenly and inexplicably 
waived at least $17 million of a $50 million loan 
made to the emirate government this year. 
? Sultan secretly gave $600,000 to support a local 
Shia husayniyya and may have tacitly approved the 
visit of a mullah from Tehran to preside over 
religious ceremonies during Muharram without 
formally being invited by the Shia community or  
cleared by the emirate's security authorities. 
Iran tried to manipulate the attempted coup to 
preserve Sultan's position, 
Tehran reacted 
quickly when Abd al Aziz attempted to oust Sultan by 
issuing an official statement backing Sultan. The US 
Embassy reports that Iranian officials worked behind 
the scenes to bolster Sultan during his temporary exile 
in Dubayy and offered to mobilize its forces on Abu 
Musa in support of Sultan. We believe Iran saw in 
Abd al Aziz a decidedly less friendly figure and 
believed that as ruler he would deal more firmly with 
Iran and Ash Shariqah's security weaknesses. Tehran 
probably calculated that the replacement of Sultan, 
who has frosty relations with Zayid, would undermine 
it's strategy of playing Ash Shariqah and Dubayy 
against Abu Dhabi and the other emirates, hindering 
UAE solidarity toward Iran. 
The power-sharing arrangements that have been 
worked out between the brothers as a result of the 
coup attempt are partly intended to check Iranian 
efforts to court Ash Shariqah and in particular 
Sultan. Abd al Aziz has been appointed Crown Prince 
and deputy to his brother as well as deputy chairman 
of a newly formed executive council to govern the 
emirate. 
Zayid, who allegedly backed Abd al Aziz in his coup 
attempt, was instrumental in setting up the power-
sharing arrangements designed to enlarge Abd al 
Aziz's role in policymaking. Zayid probably hoped 
43 
that Abd al Aziz's anti-Iranian sentiments would 
serve as a check on Sultan's friendship with Iran. 
Implications 
Iran's use of Abu Musa Island for military purposes 
will continue to be a major source of friction between 
Iran and Ash Shariqah, but this is unlikely to disrupt 
relations. The US Embassy reports that, although 
Ash Shariqah has never agreed to Iran's military use 
of the island, emirate officials believe they are 
powerless to challenge Iran's presence there. 
Nonetheless, according to the US Embassy, after the 
Iranian military buildup in October, the Amiri Guard 
commander warned Iranian diplomatic officials to 
refrain from meddling in the emirate's affairs on the 
island and threatened to close Iranian establishments 
in Ash Shariqah and call in US forces to oust the 
Iranians from Abu Musa. Despite these warnings, 
Ash Shariqah would prefer to ignore Iranian activities 
on the island, especially if Iran refrains from attacks 
along the coast. 
Ash Shariqah's inability to control Iranian activities 
on Abu Musa will increase interemirate tensions that 
are running high over how to deal with Iranian 
aggression in the region. Faced with an increasingly 
hostile Iran, UAE leaders, particularly those in Abu 
Dhabi, are likely to press Ash Shariqah to take a 
tougher position with the Iranians. Emirate leaders, 
however, will be eager to maintain their lucrative ties 
to Iran and will advocate accommodationist policies. 
Ash Shariqah's meager military and security 
capabilities as well as its sizable native Shia and 
Iranian population will prevent emirate leaders from 
taking actions that might provoke the Iranians. Iran 
probably has sufficient access to Ash Shariqah's Shia 
community to carry out subversive activity at 
Tehran's discretion.

Despite Ash Shariqah's shared interests with Iran, the 
emirate is unlikely to change its pro-Iraqi stance in 
the war or its support for the federation. Emirate 
leaders, including Sultan, are not naive about Iranian 
motives in the region and are aware that shared 
economic interests do not offer much protection 
against Iranian aggression. Moreover, the political, 
security, and economic benefits of the federation are 
far too important for Ash Shariqah to jeopardize by 
straying too far from the federation's policy toward 
Iran.

Middle East and South Asia: 
An Overview of Tax Systems 
Tax systems in Middle Eastern and South Asian 
countries are primarily used to raise revenue for 
short-term budget expenditures.' They generally fail 
to contribute to implementation of long-term policies 
in such areas as industrial development, income 
redistribution, housing, and education. Taxes are 
rarely used as a fiscal policy tool, as in Western 
countries, to influence the growth of the economy. 
Governments in the region often implement tax 
policies that are publicly acceptable but do not make 
economic sense. Moreover, tax evasion is rampant, 
and enforcement of tax laws is lax. We believe efforts 
to reform tax systems--as in Israel, Egypt, and 
Pakistan?will remain politically sensitive and hinder 
the raising of revenue. 
Most governments in the region use a mixture of 
direct and indirect taxes to raise revenue. They rely 
primarily on indirect taxes which constitute over 60 
percent of tax revenue in most countries. 
Governments throughout the region generally impose 
direct taxes that are progressive?taxing those with 
the ability to pay. Direct and indirect taxes typically 
raise less than half the total domestic revenue?
particularly in the Persian Gulf states. The difference 
is made up primarily by investment income, royalties, 
and profits from state-owned industries. 
Regional Differences 
The states of North Africa and the eastern 
Mediterranean levy a wide variety of direct and 
indirect taxes.' Customs duties, excise taxes, and 
licenses and fees provide the bulk of domestic tax 
revenues?almost 50 percent in Jordan, for example. 
Other indirect taxes used by these states include 
value-added taxes, turnover taxes, user fees, 
production and consumption taxes, and taxes on travel 
'Information on tax rates, tax revenue, and government budgeting 
mechanisms are for many countries poor. In addition, it is difficult 
to track government expenditures and the effects the expenditures 
have on capital formation, development, and modernization. 
These states include Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia Libya, Egypt, 
Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.

Secret 
and luxury items. Direct taxes in these states typically 
do not raise much revenue, largely because of evasion 
and difficulty of administration. In Egypt and Jordan, 
for example, personal and corporate income taxes 
contribute less than 15 percent of tax revenue and do 
little to improve social services or redistribute income, 
according to diplomatic reporting. 
Some countries impose taxes on an ad hoc basis to 
meet revenue shortfalls. Libya, for example, has 
imposed a "jihad tax"-3 percent of each person's 
salary is deducted for the Islamic Call Society's  
"Jihad Fund"-
In addition, the Libyan Government has imposed new 
taxes to finance its Great Manmade River Project. 
We believe that these measures will become 
permanent fixtures of the tax system.

25X1 
In the Arab Peninsula and Persian Gulf states, which 
collect most of their revenue from oil production and 
royalties from government-owned enterprises, direct 
taxes?such as taxes on property or wealth, corporate 
income or profit, and inheritance?raise only minimal 
revenue.' The main indirect taxes used by these states 
are customs duties, excise taxes, and licenses and fees. 
Like direct taxes, they generally do not raise 
substantial revenue and do little to affect economic 25X1 
growth. Customs duties and excise taxes are used to 
protect newly established domestic industries. The 
Gulf Cooperation Council recommends three tariff 
levels, but each country is free to decide its tariff rate. 
In Saudi Arabia, for instance, the general tariff was 
increased in 1985 to 7 percent, but several items enter 
duty free. 25X1 
In the Persian Gulf, reduced oil revenues in recent 
years have caused some governments to try to improve 
budget revenue and minimize the effects of the

Taxes Used in the Middle East and South Asia 
Direct taxes. The main direct taxes are the personal 
income tax, corporate income tax property or wealth 
tax, and oil taxes and royalties. Other direct taxes, 
less frequently implemented, are zakat?a general 
Islamic wealth tax to be used for the poor and 
needy?and taxes on inheritance, capital gains, and 
land revenue. 
Advantages: Rates generally are progressive, taxing 
those with the ability to pay. 
Disadvantages: Cuts back savings, real investment, 
and development. Politically difficult to increase 
because of political strength of the rich. Easy to 
evade. Numerous loopholes and exemptions often 
limit effectiveness. Raises little revenue because of 
the limited incomes of the poor. Difficult to 
implement because of high illiteracy rates and 
administrative difficulties in taxing large numbers of 
people. 
Indirect taxes. The main indirect taxes are customs 
duties, excise taxes, value added taxes, licenses and 
fees, and taxes on consumption, sales, travel, and 
luxury items. 
Advantages: Easier to administer and enforce 
because of fewer complicated tax forms and the 
smaller number of taxpayers (producers, wholesalers, 
and retailers). Often raise more revenue than direct 
taxes because the activity being taxed is more 
accessible?receipts from imports, exports, sales, and 
fees versus individual and corporate incomes, which 
probably are more easily concealed. May be used 
under the infant industry argument?new domestic 
industries need protection from established foreign 
competitors. Consumption or sales taxes?collected 
by retailers and then given to the government?allow 
the government to reach the typically large, 
subsistence population. May have a lower political 
cost because the distribution of the tax burden is 
unclear. Indirect taxes may conserve foreign 
exchange by restricting imports of luxury goods?
taxing those with the ability to pay. 
Disadvantages: Inability to reach high concentrations 
of income and wealth as effectively as direct taxes. 
Customs duties may become protectionist and distort 
domestic production by sustaining inefficient 
industries or fostering black-market activities. Some 
indirect taxes?customs duties and excise and sales 
taxes?are regressive and hurt the poorer segments of 
society. 
recession on domestic businesses. For example, 
Bahrain has raised fees for business licenses and other 
government services, and Oman has raised user fees 
for government services. Financially troubled firms in 
Saudi Arabia may be exempted from paying zakat, 
equal to 20 percent of their profits, if they can provide 
proof of their difficulties, according to the US 
Embassy in Riyadh. 
Direct taxes in South Asian countries provide 
relatively little revenue.' Pakistan and India, with

20 percent of tax revenue through direct taxation, 
according to diplomatic reporting. Several countries 
do not tax agricultural income, primarily because of 
the political clout of large landowners, leaving a large

Like the Arab states, South Asian countries rely 
heavily on indirect taxation?especially customs

have value-added taxes on certain commodities. 
India's modified value-added tax scheme?introduced 
in 1986?covers almost the entire industrial sector 
with the exception of textiles, tobacco, and petroleum, 
according to the US Embassy in New Delhi. 
South Asian governments have used a variety of tax 
measures to help make up for budget shortfalls or to 
pay for unexpected expenses: 
? India imposed a 5-percent surcharge on taxable 
income and corporate profits above $3,845 for fiscal 
year 1988/89 to raise $420 million for damages 
from this summer's drought, according to the local 
press. In addition, temporary surcharges were 
placed on customs duties and domestic air and rail 
fares. 
? Bangladesh, to raise money to import food and to 
repair and rehabilitate areas damaged by the recent 
flood, imposed a 6-percent income tax surcharge 
and 5-percent excise duty on cinemas, hotels, 
restaurants, and soft drinks. 
? Nepal began advance collections of 1987-88 
business taxes to meet 1986-87 budget demands, 
Tax Avoidance and Evasion 
Tax avoidance and evasion, while difficult to quantify, 
are widespread in the Middle East and South Asia. A 
shortage of trained personnel, such as accountants 
and customs officials, and the inability of 
governments to register taxpayers?local vendors as 
well as the general population?are contributing 
factors. In addition, individuals and businesses often 
are not attuned to paying taxes or the need to do so. In 
some countries this attitude is a reaction to the 
countries' colonial history. Taxes were regarded as an 
instrument of colonial power and, therefore, a 
legitimate object of evasion. 
Tax policies in the region?as in most developed and 
developing countries?often contain loopholes, and 
potential revenue slips through the cracks. For 
example, although Morocco's tax system snares most 
salaried employees and foreign companies, local 
businesses have developed tax avoidance to a fine art, 
Secret 
according to the US Embassy in Rabat. The local 
businessmen invest heavily in the agricultural sector 
because of tax exemptions on agricultural income 
until the year 2000. 
Prospects for Reform 
Tax increases and reforms are politically sensitive in 
the Middle East and South Asia, just like in many 
other regions. Proposed tax increases in Pakistan, for 
example, touched off rioting in Punjab Province in 
June 1987. Most government leaders in the region 
have tried to increase tax collection by removing tax 
and tariff exemptions. Such moves are frequently 
resisted by businesses?which would lose the financial 
benefit of the exemptions on imported capital goods, 
tax exemptions on profits, and/or rebates on interest 
rates?and corrupt bureaucrats who would lose 
opportunities for personal enrichment 
The countries of the Middle East and South Asia tend 
to alter tax rates rather than enforce the tax laws 
already in place or simplify administrative processes. 
Several countries are taking steps to revise their tax 
systems: 
? Tunisia's reform measures call for a single, 
comprehensive income tax to replace separate tax 
regimes for salaried employees, self-employed 
persons, and semiskilled industrial workers. In 
addition, the government is reducing tariffs and 
liberalizing import measures and exchange rates to 
make the industrial sector more competitive, 
according to diplomatic reporting. 
? Israel's committee on tax reform is seeking to 
improve the tax return filing system. Only 350,000 
workers?out of 1.6 million?file tax returns, 
according to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Indian-US High-Technology 
Cooperation 
Indian Prime Minister Gandhi's visit to Washington 
in October marked progress in Indo-US cooperation 
in several high-technology fields. New Delhi decided 
to purchase a US supercomputer and arranged a US 
launch of its fourth communications satellite just 
before the visit and signed a cooperation agreement on 
the Light Combat Aircraft after the visit. Gandhi has 
won support for his efforts to improve bilateral 
relations from India's business and scientific elites 
and many of the urban middle class who share his 
enthusiasm for more advanced technology. Gandhi 
has lowered his public profile on the acquisition of 
advanced technology, however, as his political 
opponents increasingly challenge his efforts. They 
claim he is pursuing this interest at the expense of 
Indians who are suffering in the drought and living in 
rural poverty. 
Differences over the emphasis given to transferring 
versus protecting US technology will disturb efforts to 
cooperate. New Delhi views Washington's stringent 
interpretation of the Memorandum of Understanding 
on technology transfer as frustrating India's national 
ambitions. US concerns about the potential dual use 
and diversion of sophisticated technology may 
constrict the flow of US technology and prompt New 
Delhi to turn to alternative suppliers of technology,  
 New Delhi has not been 
enthusiastic about Moscow's proffers favors in the 
high-technology area. 
Technology Diversion 
Gandhi believes that the Memorandum of 
Understanding is a key element in New Delhi's plans 
for technological progress and economic development 
over the next decade, 
He has said repeatedly that rapid 
improvement in productivity requires imported 
technology. Some of his advisers believe the 
memorandum will help New Delhi modernize the 
military by expanding access to US technology. 
Others caution that the memorandum might place the 
Secret 
United States in a position to dictate the scope and 
pace of Indian technological progress and economic 
development. These officials complain about US 
controls and are inclined to recommend purchases of 
comparable non-US equipment from other developed 
countries to avoid what they see as unjustified 
restrictions and ingrained US suspicions about Indian 
trustworthiness. 
Both the Indian Government and private industry are 
concerned about protecting Western technology and 
equipment to retain access to future developments. 
During 1987, New Delhi has warned US officials not 
to sell to certain firms it suspects of working for the 
Soviets. The Indians, even with the best of intentions, 
cannot foreclose Soviet collection efforts or prevent 
diversion. We can confirm transfers of controlled US 
dual-use technology?mainly computer-related 
items?by Indian firms and individuals over a period 
of 10 years. Non-Indian firms, 
have used Indian businesses as a conduit for 
transferring technology and equipment goods and  
software to the USSR and Eastern Europe.

Light Combat Aircraft 
Gandhi has lowered the political barrier to defense 
cooperation with the United States with his signing of 
the agreement on the light combat aircraft and the 
statement in the joint communique at the end of his 
visit welcoming further cooperation. He is confronting 
the leftist political opposition within his 
administration that questions the reliability of the 
United States as a supplier and US intentions to use 
high technology to control New Delhi. Nonetheless,

hardware and other technological support. 
New Delhi is making headway toward producing the 
light combat aircraft which is intended to modernize 
India's aircraft industry, provide its Air Force with a 
near state-of-the-art fighter, and reduce dependence 
on Soviet combat aircraft. New Delhi has purchased 
11 General Electric F404J engines for use in the 
construction and testing of the prototype aircraft and 
has a long shopping list of US subsystems. The US 
Embassy reports General Electric believes it can 
interest the Indians in its radar. 
We expect Gandhi will shop around for military 
technology and equipment for the light combat 
aircraft. New Delhi has awarded the design contract 
this year to Dassault of France and is shopping in 
Western Europe for advanced technology. New Delhi 
has not sought assistance from the Soviets for the 
program. Moscow has offered 50 additional MIG-29s 
as an alternative to the aircraft. New Delhi agreed 
this year to buy the MIGs but has not slowed work on 
the light combat aircraft project. 
Secret 
Gandhi will attempt to balance India's ambitions to 
become self-sufficient militarily with its need to keep 
ahead of China and Pakistan. In the case of the light 
combat aircraft, Gandhi knows he is undertaking a 
difficult task. There is a possibility New Delhi will 
decide to shelve the program in the early 1990s 
because of increasing costs and time delays. It has the 
option to coproduce the MIG-29 or the Mirage 2000 
as an alternative. 
Computers 
Gandhi's decision to buy the US supercomputer 
probably gives US firms an additional edge in the 
Indian computer market. New Delhi expects that 
imports of US computers will stimulate domestic 
industrial development and improve its ability to 
compete in international markets. Immediately after 
the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding 
there was a flurry of activity between New Delhi and 
several US companies for coproduction agreements. 
Negotiations on several deals have been hamstrung by 
Indian bureaucratic foot-dragging and US licensing 
requirements. 
India is interested in acquiring US 
superminicomputers?such as Digital Equipment 
Corporation's VAX?to upgrade its computer-aided 
design and manufacturing capabilities and US 
supercomputers?from Cray?to satisfy their high-
speed computing needs. Control Data Corporation 
negotiated a $500 million deal for production of their 
medium-size mainframe computers in India. Digital 
Equipment Corporation is discussing a deal for Indian 
production of their MicroVAX II. 
Despite the optimism over prospects for future 
negotiations, New Delhi recognizes that its access to 
US computer technology will be limited by US 
licensing requirements. The Indians, therefore, are 
talking with Japanese and West European firms 
about everything from supercomputers to personal 
computers as an alternative to dealing with the 
United States.

The CRAY" X-MP/1 computei.s 
launch failure, and the 1JS Missile Technology 
Control Regime (MTCF,) probably will limit Indo-US 
space cooperation over the next several years. New 
Delhi's immediate program goals include a second 
launch of its augmented space launch vehicle, the 
orbiting of the remaining two Insat-I communications 
satellites and the remote sensing satellite, and the 
development of the Insa II communications satellites 
and polar and geostatior ary launch vehicles. New 
Delhi has reservations for a US Delta launch vehicle 
to place their Insat I-D communications satellite in 
orbit in March 1989. India has asked for US 
technology, including cr:iogenic engine research and 
development, liquid proreliant tanks for satellites, 
supersonic wind tunnels, telemetry equipment, and 
wheel bogies for the motile service tower for the polar 
space launch vehicle. New Delhi hs also approached 
France, West Germany, Canada, and Japan to meet 
its near-term goals. 
India's space program probably will be delayed by the 
MTCR but should achieve its goal of self-reliance in 
space applications by the end of the century. New 
Delhi anticipates that ce-tamn spinoffs from the space 
program ?such as expanded communications 
capability will contribute to economic growth and to 
an improved quality of lire. 
51 
An artist s impression of INSAT-1 
The USSR and India signed several science and 
technology cooperation agreements this year that will 
aid India's space program. In early 1988, the Soviets 
will launch India's remote sensing satellite (IRS-1), 
helping New Delhi pass another milestone in its 
ambitious program. Moscow has offered to provide 
significant amounts of advanced equipment to India. 
India, in our judgment, can produce many of the 
technologies needed for ballistic missile development, 
but it needs assistance with advanced guidance 
systems, thrust vector controls, and heat shield-
reentry vehicle technology. New Delhi is shopping for 
technology, probably intended for its ballistic missile 
program, from France, West Germany, and Japan--
testing the MTCR in the process. 
We have no direct evidence that India is receiving 
Soviet assistance for its missile development program. 
The Soviets have expressed a guarded interest in 
joining the MTCR. Indian scientists associated with 
the missile programs and their Soviet counterparts

Looking to US-Trained Indians 
Gandhi is trying, with some success, to involve 
expatriate Indians living in the United States in 
lending their skills and capital to India's 
modernization drive. Gandhi recently named Sam 
Secret 
Petroda?an Indian-born, US-trained scientist?as 
adviser on technology missions. Petroda, who will 
serve as a member of the Cabinet, has extensive 
business holdings in the Chicago area. Diplomatic 
reporting indicates US-based, nonresident Indians are 
trying to enter the personal computer business in 
India with mixed results. They are optimistic about 
the long-term payoffs but find that patience and 
persistence are required to launch a new venture in 
India, especially in areas outside Bombay and New 
Delhi. They face bureaucratic delays, red tape, and 
outright opposition from state and national officials. 
Outlook 
New Delhi and Washington will differ over the issues 
of access to and diversion of advanced US military, 
computer, and space technology?with Gandhi 
pressing for wider access, prompt clearances, and 
favorable financial terms. New Delhi will look to US 
firms for advanced avionics technology for India's 
light combat aircraft program and is likely to 
continue negotiations for the purchase of at least two 
additional supercomputers. The Indians almost 
certainly will ask that discussions to purchase 
advanced dual processor supercomputers, presently 
denied under the US-Japanese agreement, begin 
during 1988. We expect the Indians will shop in the 
United States for the specialty items they need for 
their space program?despite the obstacles posed for 
New Delhi by the MTCR?because US firms can 
compete on price with Japan and Western Europe. 
We believe New Delhi will turn to Japan and Western 
Europe rather than the USSR for the advanced 
technology denied by the United States. Gandhi will 
continue discussions with Moscow on a series of high-
technology deals to placate leftist domestic political 
interests. He, however, will move cautiously to avoid 
alienating other constituents with technical training 
or business interests favoring Western rather than 
Soviet technology. Despite India's efforts to curtail 
diversion of Western technology, we believe India's 
capacity to track foreign and domestic diverters will 
lag behind the ingenuity of the individuals or private 
firms operating in India.

Gandhi probably will be looking for an indication that 
Washington is as enthusiastic as it was in 1985 about 
the future of Indo-US cooperation in advanced 
technology. He is aware of the disagreements in 
Washington over India's intentions and ability to 
protect sensitive technology. New Delhi will continue 
to press the United States for prompt release and 
favorable financial terms for advanced avionics 
technology for its light combat aircraft program.

High-Technology Firms 
Prospering in South India 
Despite general industry fears of a drought-induced 
recession, South India's high-technology industries 
are doing well and expect to increase their 
manufacturing base and design capability. Several 
computer-based industries have doubled their sales 
over the past year and expect similar growth this year. 
The availability of skilled engineers, scientists, and 
technicians makes southern India a prime location for 
additional growth of high-technology industries. 
Companies in southern India produce software 
cheaply, which could help them gain a niche in the 
world market, but they need to overcome several 
problems associated with software design and 
marketing. One of their greatest weaknesses is their 
small-scale production, which makes it difficult for 
them to compete internationally. 
Domestic Market Versus Exports 
Computer manufacturers and other high-technology 
firms, like most Indian industries, look to the large 
domestic market for the bulk of their sales. The 
primary market is the government?state and central 
banks and ministries?and public-sector firms, such 
as transportation. Some producers have made 
lucrative sales to India's space program and defense 
industries, but they have had less success with 
educational institutions and private-sector firms. 
Most computer hardware manufacturers see only 
limited export opportunities. High customs duties and 
transport costs of imported parts frequently price 
Indian products out of the international market. 
Indian 
manufacturers indicated they are under pressure to 
look to other markets where they can earn hard 
currency to maintain essential components and 
technology. 
55 
Secret 
US Embassy officials say New Delhi hopes that 
computer software will be the new export growth 
area, 
confident. The head of software exports for one 
company told a US Embassy official that the industry 
would be lucky to reach half of the $2 billion in 
software exports projected by the government for 
1990. India can produce software cheaply, but most 
firms lack design capabilities, market knowledge, or 
financing to get into the international arena. Others 
complain that they spend most of their time meeting 
the needs of domestic clients or are too small to invest 
the sums necessary to market internationally. 
Nevertheless India 
may eventually succeed internationally because 
Indian software writers are the world's most 
productive and least expensive. 
Growing Technical Capability 
Unlike many segments of Indian industry, the high-
technology firms in the south are well informed of the 
latest developments in their field. The more 
established firms have small but sophisticated 
research and development units. One company, for 
example, designed and manufactured a minicomputer 
with a state-of-the-art microprocessor only six months 
after the microprocessor was released for commercial 
use by the Western company that developed it. 
Another firm is working on the development of 
circuits that would reduce computer size and increase 
data-processing efficiency. 
The head of Keonics, the Karnataka State Electronic 
Development Corporation, told a US Embassy officer 
that Indian firms can produce about 60 to 70 percent 
of India's personal computer and minicomputer 
component needs. Throughout southern India there 
are a large number of small-scale firms (Keonics 
estimates 500 to 1,000 in Bangalore alone) that make 
a wide range of computer components and electronic

subassemblies. Domestic supplies of electronic 
components and computer peripherals are likely to 
increase when new industries around Bangalore, 
supported by Indian private sector investment and 
foreign collaborators, go into full-scale production 
over the next few years. 
Computer firms in Madras and Bangalore are 
interested in ventures with foreign companies because 
this allows them to add to their technical capabilities. 
Software and computer manufacturers view joint 
ventures as a way of stimulating state-of-the-art 
circuit design and computer software production in 
the region. One company's representatives told a US 
Embassy officer that their firm plans to buy time on a 
foreign company's satellite communications system to 
sell software in the United States. 
India's Silicon Valley 
A strong base of skilled engineers, scientists, and 
technicians makes southern India ideal for the 
development of high-technology industries. The 
Indian Institute of Technology in Madras provides 
first-class undergraduate education and is conducting 
pioneering research in frontier areas such as 
superconducters. The Indian Institute of Science in 
Bangalore is India's leading graduate institution for 
scientific research and education. According to one 
computer manufacturer, there are a large number of 
local private and state-supported engineering schools  
producin skilled graduates. 
the state of Kartiataka alone produces 
over one-third of the nation's engineering graduates, 
many of whom specialize in the electrical and 
computer sciences. 
US Embassy officials say many computer and 
computer software firms attempt to emulate a Silicon 
Valley culture. They note that the offices bustle with 
activity, and there is a shirt-sleeved informality. Most 
managers are young, have modest-size cubicles rather 
than "power" offices, go by first names, and are easily 
accessible to their colleagues. This is in sharp contrast 
to the usually rigid hierarchies and command-oriented 
bureaucratic structures prevalent in other Indian 
private and public-sector firms. 
this environment increases 
creativity and job satisfaction.

Some industry leaders worry that India's sizable

innovative aspects of projects. Scientists at the Indian 
Institute of Sciences in Bangalore are concerned that 
some joint ventures are only a means of using cheap 
Indian brainpower to satisfy the needs of Western 
markets. They believe that, in some cases, there is 
little of technological value done in India because 
most of the designs come from the United States, 
leaving the tedious detail work to Indian 
programmers.

Secret 
Other observers criticize Indian electronics policy, 
which encourages kit imports. 
local manufacturers who took 
the more expensive route of fostering research and 
development and manufacturing capabilities are 
losing profits to companies that are importing only the 
components for assembly. Most firms particularly 
resent the sales leader "Shiva" computers, which 
produces low-cost, kit-built personal computers. 
The Down Side 
One of the major weaknesses of Indian computer 
firms is their small-scale production. A leading 
company produces only 3,000 personal computer units 
a year (Apple produces over 250,000 units) and only a 
handful of minicomputers. A US Embassy officer was 
told that computers were "handmade" at most 
establishments, with operations resembling a cottage 
industry. The quality of the products varies widely, 
leading to maintenance and service problems. 
Small-scale production has made it difficult for 
Indian computer firms to compete internationally. 
Stiff competition and low volumes have shaved profit 
margins, seriously eroding research and development 
budgets. Computer manufacturers in Madras and 
Reverse Blank 57 
Bangalore expressed concern to a US Embassy 
official that they will fall further behind international 
standards if they cannot fund future product 
development and improvement. 
Outlook 
Despite some shortcomings, economic prospects for 
high-technology industries in southern India are 
promising. The large domestic market?particularly 
government agencies and defense-related industries?
is largply untapped. If software design and marketing 
problems can be solved, India could gain a niche in 
the international market because of its low-cost 
production. 
India will have to resist the temptation to produce all 
of its computers and related components. New Delhi 
probably will reduce computer kit imports as domestic 
component producers come on line, which will 
strengthen the competitive position of those firms with 
their own research and development capabilities. It 
will have to maintain a steady inflow of technology 
and components to keep pace with fast-moving 
developments in the computer field. Otherwise, 
India's high-technology field will suffer from 
technological obsolescence and high-cost production, 
the bane of other Indian industries.

Afghanistan's Maoist Factions: 
Which Way to the Revolution? 
Afghanistan's Maoist factions have been seriously 
weakened by attacks from the Kabul regime and 
Islamic fundamentalist resistance parties. We believe 
the Maoists have lost most of the territory they 
controlled at the beginning of the war and have  
fragmented into splinter groups. 
 Maoists make up a large 
percentage of the "nonparty" supporters of the Kabul 
regime and the Afghan employees of 
nongovernmental aid organizations in Peshawar and 
Quetta, Pakistan. We believe many Maoists have 
joined the traditionalist resistance factions. In our 
view, the Maoists?organized, experienced, educated, 
and more disciplined than most resistance 
organizations?can form a small, urban underground 
and carry out such critical clandestine activities as 
intelligence, propaganda, and sabotage. Such 
operations would depend on the Maoists' unlikely 
ability to surmount internal schisms and coordinate 
operations with the main resistance groups 
The Birth of a Movement 
the Afghan Maoist 
factions grew out of the same Kabul student 
movements that, during the 1960s, produced the 
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)?
the current ruling party?and the precursors of 
today's fundamentalist resistance groups. These 
student movements fell into three general categories, 
The first, a group led 
by Islamic theologists?and current resistance 
leaders?Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Burnahuddin 
Rabbani, favored a renewed emphasis on Islam within 
the Afghan Government and society. The other 
movements?nationalist and Marxist?both split 
internally along ethnic lines. Nationalist Hazaras and 
Tajiks opposed the domination of the Afghan 
Government by the Pashtun tribes. Pashtun 
nationalists sought to carve their own country?
"Pashtunistan"?out of tribal areas on both sides of 
the Afghan-Pakistani border. Similarly, 
leftist Pashtuns joined the PDPA, 
and students from minority groups formed the 
Organization of Progressive Youth. 
59 
Although we believe the Organization of Progressive 
Youth grew out of two small factions?the Mahmudi 
and Yari cells?initially influenced by the same 
Soviet and Tudeh (Iranian Communist) writings as 
the PDPA, it soon rejected the Soviet model in favor 
of Maoist doctrine. 
the group began publishing a biweekly paper, Shula-i-
Jawed (Eternal Flame), in 1967 that became 
extremely popular. Shula 's 
readership included several military officers and 
public officials, few of whom knew that the 
Organization of Progressive Youth?soon renamed 
Shula after its newspaper?was behind the 
publication. The newspaper was banned by the 
government and the group's leaders arrested in 
November 1967  after it had incited several strikes and 
demonstrations, 
Growth and Fission: The 1970s 
During the 1970s, the surviving Shula members broke 
up into several factions as a result of personal and 
ideological disputes,  
the major 
faction?the Revolutionary Group of the People of 
Afghanistan?asked its members to go into the 
countryside and work with the farmers. Their goal 
was to found a pro-Chinese Afghan Communist 
Party. We believe the group's efforts?along with 
their pragmatic blend of Maoist rhetoric and a variety 
of regional and ethnic causes?explain the 
concentration of Maoists during the 1970s in 
relatively remote areas of Badakhshan, Nimruz, and 
Helmand Provinces. In our view, the group's successes 
were partly due to the tribal rank of its members, 
many of whom were chiefs' sons sent to Kabul for 
their education.

Maoist insurgents in Kabul 
assassinated the vice director of KHAD, the Afghan 
secret service, in 1980 in retaliation for the arrest and 
murder of SAMA's founder, Abdul Majid Kalakami. 
such urban groups generally 
make up for their small numbers with careful 
organization and target selection. We believe that 
most urban Maoist cells concentrate on intelligence 
collection and circulating shabnama (night letters) 
encouraging greater  resistance to the regime or airing 
ideological disputes. 
Maoists in the Regime  
Although Afghan 
regime members singled out Maoists in their early 
purges, we believe many Maoists are now either 
members or supporters of the government. According 
to the US Embassy in Kabul, Najibullah announced 
the PDPA's intention to absorb smaller political and 
labor groups at the 19th PDPA meeting in September 
1986. We believe most such groups are Maoist 
factions that have decided they would gain more by 
working with the regime, but who seek at least 
nominal independence from PDPA direction. 
One group absorbed by the PDPA in the early years 
of the Afghan regime was Setam-i-Melli (Oppressed 
Nation). This anti-Pashtun group?most active 
among the ethnic minorities of the north?was 
founded in the late 1960s by Mohammad Ta her 
Badakhshi. Badakhshi, a Shia Tajik, had been a 
founding member of the PDPA in 1965. He left the 
party after a dispute with Nur Mohammad Taraki. 
He dropped from sight after the 1978 coup?arrested 
and executed on the orders of Hafizullah Amin,  
according to a press report. 
many Setam members now follow 
Prime Minister Soltan Ali Keshtmand, the brother of 
Badakhshi's widow. 
According to the US Embassy in Kabul, the 
Revolutionary Organization of the Working People of 
Afghanistan (ROWPA)?led by former Setam 
member Mohammad Bashir Baghlani and, we 
believe, built on Setam's original constituency?is the 
Secret 
only proregime Maoist group to retain at least 
nominal independence from the PDPA. According to 
the Embassy report, the 5,000-member organization 
consists mostly of Turkmens, Tajiks, and Uzbeks. It is 
primarily concerned with protecting the interests of 
minorities against the Pashtuns who dominate the 
Afghan regime. Kabul press reports in late October 
1987 indicate that the PDPA is wooing ROWPA with 
promises of greater power and regime positions in 
return for closer support for the government. In our 
view, the regime's success with such tactics will be 
limited by ROWPA's size and anti-Pashtun 
orientation. 
Two earlier Maoist holdouts, the Vanguard 
Organization of Young Workers of Afghanistan and 
the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Working 
People, merged with the PDPA in late September 
1986, according to the US Embassy in Kabul. The 
leader of the Revolutionary Association of Afghan 
Working People, Mohammad Zahir Ofuq, is a 
member of the PDPA Central Committee. We know 
little about these two factions but believe them to be 
offshoots of Setam-i-Melli. 
Relations With the Resistance 
many Maoist 
groups are trying to avoid the PDPA mistake of 
appearing to be subservient to a foreign, anti-Islamic 
ideology. Maoist factions 
have reorganized and adopted such names as the 
Freedom Fighters' Front to seem more a part of the

Secret 
In 1980, 
six of the seven Peshawar-based resistance 
parties demanded that the UN High Commission for 
Refugees stop funding the Afghan Doctors' 
Association, which they claimed was using its 
humanitarian programs to conceal its Maoist 
orientation, a doctor with the 
association was kidnapped and killed becuase of his 
Maoist views, almost certainly by fundamentalist  
resistance fighters. 
some Maoists have 
been welcomed within the traditionalist resistance 
parties. Asif Kawari, chairman of the cultural affairs 
department of Mojadedi's Jabha-i-Najat-i-Milli 
Afghanistan; Dr. Haider, Mojadedi's political adviser; 
and Azizullah Ludin, Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami 
leader Nabi's political adviser were given their 
positions despite their known Maoist connections,  
many other Maoists are employed 
by nongovernmental humanitarian organizations. 
the Maoists have been 
valuable to these agencies because they are generally 
better educated and have a more modern outlook than 
most Afghan refugees. 
Contacts Abroad 
We believe the Afghan Maoists receive little or no 
significant aid from China. 
the Chinese decided in the early 1970s that 
the Afghan Maoist groups were hopelessly fractured 
and ineffective and that Afghan conditions were 
unlikely to support a Maoist revolution. In our view, 
the fact that several factions openly oppose Deng 
Xiaoping's reforms also limits Chinese willingness to 
offer support. We believe China may have 
coordinated with the Maoist Freedom Fighters' Front 
on the group's attempt in 1983 to block the seating of 
the official Afghan delegation at the Nonaligned 
Movement's meeting in New Delhi. 
The Maoist groups have far more extensive ties to 
leftist student groups in Western Europe, 
25X1 
Facing a Dead End 
In our judgment, Maoist influence will continue to 
decline. Afghan resistance suspicion of non-Islamic 
ideologies and many Maoists' disillusionment with 
Communism will, in our view, limit Maoist influence 
in the resistance movement. Similarly, the Maoists 
within the Kabul regime are handicapped by their 
minority ethnic status and lingering PDPA suspicion. 
We believe the Maoist groups?particularly the 
remaining SAMA cells in Kabul and other cities?
could contribute greatly to the Afghan insurgent war 
effort. The resistance has been hampered in the cities 
by its lack of experience in clandestine operations and 
aversion to rigid discipline. We believe the urban-
based Maoist factions have used their experience to 25X1 
create a network of cells penetrating government 
circles and carrying out sabotage and propaganda 
operations. In our view, an increase in such 
operations?whether unilaterally or in cooperation 
with the main Afghan resistance parties?could affect 
the progress of the war far more than the Maoists' 
small numbers would warrent. Such a development 25X1 
would require the Maoists to put aside internal 
ideological quarrels and accept the risks involved in 
heightened operations. Such a change would be 
unlikely to come from Afghanistan's most schismatic 
factions. 25X1
