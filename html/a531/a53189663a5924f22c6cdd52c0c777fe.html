 SYRIA-LEBANON:   Possible Troop Reduction
 I                                                             Syria is
 considering substantially reducing its military role in
 Lebanon.   The Syrians would be unlikely to reduce their
 forces there,  however,  if they believed doing so would
 trigger another civil war.
 //The degree of Arab support for Syria's role in
 Lebanon will be an important consideration for Syrian
 President Assad in reaching a decision.   The Arab League
 mandate, under which Syria receives $15 million each
 month for its forces in Lebanon, was renewed a few weeks
 ago for three instead of the usual six months.   The re-
 duction probably reflects growing Arab dissatisfaction
 with the lack of progress toward a political settlement
 in Lebanon.//

 USSR:   Reaction to US Nuclear Accident
 Soviet officials initially had little public comment
 on the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.   They have,
 however,  begun emphasizing the safety and importance of
 the Soviet nuclear power program in order to avoid public
 opposition.   The Soviets stress the absolute safety of
 their nuclear power reactors and their advantages over
 conventional thermal power stations, while charging that
 the profit motive of US companies  leads to evasion of
 safety measures and regulations.
 Igor Morokhov, First Deputy Chairman of the State
 Committee for Utilization of Atomic Energy, claims that
 Soviet safety standards rule out the possibility of any
 accident that would lead to radioactive leaks.   The So-
 viet designers believe they employ a conservative design
 philosophy, but their safety measures are not as rigorous
 as those in the US.   In addition, Soviet compliance with
 recognized safety standards is at best haphazard, although
 no serious accident involving the reactor itself has been
 reported at a nuclear power station.   An accident at a
 Soviet nuclear power station would probably have severe
 results; none of the Soviet reactors now in operation
 has the secondary containment vessel or emergency core-
 cooling system included in all US nuclear power stations.
 The Soviets are firmly committed to a major nuclear
 power program in the European USSR, where 80 percent of
 total electric power is consumed and conventional power
 plants are in short supply.   The program, however, is
 proceeding slowly because the Soviets have only a limited
 capacity to produce nuclear reactor components and plant
 equipment.
 The 10 Soviet nuclear power stations in operation
 last year provided only 3.5 percent of total power out-
 put in contrast with 12.6 percent in the US.   The Soviets
 are constructing seven new nuclear power stations and en-
 larging almost all existing stations.   Construction on
 17 more stations is to begin in the next five years.   By
 the year 2000,  the Soviet Ministry of Electric Power ex-
 pects nuclear energy to meet 20 percent of the total de-
 mand for electric power.

 CHINA:   Setbacks for Deng's Policies
 //Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping has been set back in
 his efforts to push several policies important to him.
 Although Deng himself called for postponement of a reap-
 praisal of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution and
 also for the recent crackdown on  "democratic" activity,
 it seems likely that he has been forced to beat a re-
 treat.   The current economic "retrenchment," on the other
 hand, seems motivated primarily by economic concerns and
 does not appear to be an issue being used against Deng.//
 Deng's efforts to generate a reevaluation of Mao
 and the events of the recent past stopped abruptly late
 last month when an attempt to condemn all of Mao's pol-
 icies since 1958 gave way to calls in the media to halt
 attacks on Mao.   Media discussion of some of the more
 explosive incidents of the Cultural Revolution met with
 propaganda diatribes against "imprudently" reaching con-
 clusions about the recent past before the time is "ripe."
 Party Chairman Hua Guofeng and other beneficiaries
 of the Cultural Revolution undoubtedly are championing
 the current official view that these difficult and divi-
 sive issues cannot be resolved for many years.   They see
 Deng's effort to condemn the past as a direct threat to
 themselves.   Their thwarting of Deng seems largely a de-
 fensive move and does not in itself seriously erode his
 political power.   Deng, who has been stymied on
 issues before,  is not likely to let them die.
 Potentially more damaging to Deng is the crackdown
 on "democracy."   The excesses of this movement, which is
 closely identified with Deng, probably have alarmed many
 besides Hua and Cultural Revolution holdovers.   Even
 Deng was doubtless disturbed by a breakdown in social
 order that reportedly has resulted in traffic disrup-
 tions, attempts forcibly to enter government buildings,
 and behavior that is immoral in Chinese eyes.   It is a
 severe blow to Deng's prestige, if only because it raises
 questions about his judgments,  that his efforts to pro-
 vide a sense of popular participation in politics and an
 avenue to express public grievances have proved disrup-
 tive. F7         I

 whatever political fallout this might entail for him.

 Despite Deng's recent problems, his opponents are
 not prospering.   Some aspects of the economic reassess-
 ment appear to be indirect efforts to embarrass Chairman
 Hua, Deng's other Politburo adversaries continue to main-
 tain a low profile, and recent personnel decisions have
 favored supporters of Deng.

 TURKEY:   Killing of US Serviceman
 The killing yesterday of a US Air Force serviceman
 in Izmir and the wounding of another follow a series of
 less serious anti-American incidents in Turkey in recent
 weeks.   The attack may force Prime Minister Ecevit's gov-
 ernment to institute a more harsh variety of martial law
 where it is in force--and also extend it to Izmir--in
 order to stop the street violence still plaguing Turkey.
 The shootings--the first of foreign servicemen since
 the early 1970s--is a clear departure from recent acts
 of violence in which leftists and rightists generally
 attacked each other or government officials.   The kidnap-
 ings of four US servicemen in 1971 were an important cat-
 alyst of the military "coup by memorandum" of that year.
 In yesterday's attack,  the assailants fired from a pass-
 ing,  stolen vehicle.                                   They remain at large.   As is cus-
 tomary in Turkey,  no or anization has claimed responsi-
 bility for the action.
 Izmir has long been a leftist stronghold,  and the
 25X1
 assailants could be leftists intent upon embarrassing the
 government and its relationship with NATO and the US.
 The upsurge in anti-American incidents in recent weeks--
 particularly in Izmir--may have been part of an annual
 commemoration of the deaths of leftists in the late 1960s
 and early 1970s.   US and NATO facilities are highly visi-
 ble targets symbolizing "imperialism" within Turkey,  and  25X1
 attacks on these installations and private property of
 Americans ensure media coverage of leftist exploits.
 Rightist extremist groups would also have a motive
 for killing an American.   The right has long appealed to
 the government to institute a more draconian form of
 martial law.   The previous martial law period between
 1971 and 1973 resulted in near decimation of the extreme
 left.

 SOUTH AFRICA:   Expulsion of US Officials
 The South African expulsion yesterday of three mem-
 bers of the US defense attache's office in Pretoria for
 alleged espionage reflects a growing anti-US mood in Pre-
 toria.   We expect the South Africans to continue to lash
 out at the US to vent their frustrations over the pres-
 sure being put on them to change their social policies.
 I                           I
 This increased resentment of the US involves several
 policy elements.   First is Prime Minister Botha's belief
 that his country was deceived in the development of the
 UN Secretary General's recent report on Namibia.   This
 belief,  though it is probably sincere, may provide a con-
 venient excuse for further stalling on the Namibian ne-
 25X1          gotiations.
 25X1
 25X1
 ings in the US as necessary evils.
 Botha may also be trying to represent the US as an
 enemy as part of his attempt to heal the internal rifts
 caused by the recent Information Department scandal.   He
 can justify some of South Africa's more underhanded deal-
 South African officials feel increasingly that be-
 cause of their successful management of the current oil
 crisis and their evasion of the arms embargo,  interna-
 tional economic sanctions are no longer as dreaded as
 before.   The South Africans also believe that their
 country has a wide and sympathetic audience in the US
 whose opinions are not reflected in current US policy.

 The price increases affect basic goods and services
 under government price controls.   The Marcos government
 raised prices 10 to 30 percent for petroleum products,
 rental housing, public transportation, and electricity.
 It also lifted price controls on items such as sugar,
 milk, and textiles.   The increases resulted in part from
 the government's policy of passing on to the consumer
 the higher cost of imported oil.   Pressure from domestic
 manufacturers to raise prices on their goods was also a
 factor in Marcos' decision.
 25X1
 //Marcos set the stage for the price hikes last
 month when he announced a 20- to 29-percent increase in
 minimum wages and cost of living allowances.   Only a
 third of the Philippines'  15.5 million workers are eligi- 25X1
 ble for higher wages, however, because of an array of
 exemptions and loopholes in the wage law.//
 Until now, Manila has been able to keep prices under
 control.   The inflation rate has been less than 10 per-
 cent annually since 1974.   Although the government is
 forecasting a 10-percent inflation rate in 1979,  unoffi-
 cial estimates suggest that inflation will reach 15 to
 20 percent this year.                                                 25X1

 Saudi Arabian Defense Minister Prince Sultan has
 confirmed Saudi willingness to follow through on its
 $525-million commitment to finance Egypt's purchase of
 the F-5 jet fighter aircraft from the US.   During a meet-

 Defense, the Prince raised no objections to the arrange-

 publicity surrounding the deal so as not unduly to arouse
 the radical Arab states.   Sultan also emphasized the
 F-5s would be financed over a six-year period.   The $108-
 million Egyptian order for US support vehicles, which
 Saudi Arabia agreed to pay for last year, was not men-

 CHAD:   No Political Settlement
 Representatives of Chad's recently installed pro-
 visional government adjourned their 10-day meeting in
 Nigeria on Wednesday without agreeing on a timetable for
 electing a civilian government.   Principal sticking
 points stem from personal rivalries among the various
 Muslim leaders--who seem to agree only on their opposi-
 tion to a return to southern political domination--and
 efforts by the southerners to carve out a strong position
 in the new regime.   As a face-saving device,  the partic-
 ipants agreed to send a factfinding mission to Chad and
 to convene again to hear the mission's conclusions.   The
 inability to come up with a viable political settlement
 increases the possibility of renewed fighting and a
 de facto partition of Chad along regional and religious
 lines.

 ISRAEL:   Moves Affecting West Bank and Gaza
 25X1
 25X1
 With the approach of negotiations to establish a
 self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
 the Israeli Government and unauthorized groups of Is-
 raelis are strengthening their positions in both areas.
 Israeli authorities have established Jewish regional
 councils to control existing West Bank settlements.   Po-
 litical pressure is building to establish new settlements
 on the West Bank and in Gaza.   At the same time, Israeli
 troops on the West Bank have adopted a tough,  new secu-
 rity posture and resorted to heavyhanded tactics to sup-
 press recent Arab demonstrations.   Vigilante actions by
 Jewish religious extremists and settlers--to which Is-
 raeli officials have reacted equivocaZZ --are further
 fueling local Arab resentment.
 The Israeli military government last month estab-
 lished four Jewish regional councils to control almost
 all of Israel's more than 50 settlements on the West
 Bank.   The military regime reportedly plans to establish
 similar arrangements for the half-dozen settlements in
 the Gaza Strip.
 The councils, which will remain under the control of
 the Israeli military indefinitely,  appear designed to
 ensure that the settlers will be subject only to Israeli
 law and administration.   The councils apparently will
 function much like municipal bodies in Israel proper.
 They are authorized to sign contracts,  impose local

 Agriculture Minister Arik Sharon, who has long
 pushed for more Jewish communities in the occupied
 territories, and leading hardliners in the National Re-
 ligious Party--Prime Minister Begin's key coalition al-
 ly--want quickly to establish new settlements and expand
 existing ones in the densely Arab-inhabited "heartland"
 of the northern West Bank.   They also want to push ahead

 with new settlements in the southern Gaza Strip to estab-
 lish a buffer between what will become Egyptian-controlled
 Sinai and Gaza's large Palestinian population.
 Begin knows that granting the hardliners'  demands
 would antagonize Egypt and compound Sadat's problems in
 the Arab world.   Foreign Minister Dayan is pressing that
 consideration;  in a recent briefing of Israeli Foreign
 Ministry officials, he stressed that moderation in a set-
 tlements policy is necessary to avoid undermining rela-
 tions with Egypt.   Financial and manpower constraints
 could also restrain new settlement activity.
 The radical Gush Emunim organization, which is in
 the forefront of the campaign for more Jewish settlements,
 may try to lay symbolic cornerstones for 10 new ones on
 the West Bank during the current Passover holidays.
 Gush leaders hope that the government will not interfere
 because of Begin's sympathetic ideological views and to
 avoid alienating important Gush supporters in Begin's
 Likud bloc and the National Religious Party.   Gush lead-
 ers probably would then redouble their efforts to gen-
 erate pressure within the governing coalition to approve
 the settlements.

 The harsh suppression in recent weeks of new anti-
 Israeli demonstrations by restive West Bank Arabs also
 reflects the government's state of mind.   New security
 measures included the imposition of temporary curfews in
 particularly troublesome areas--one at Hahlul north of
 Hebron lasted two weeks--and lengthy closings of all
 universities and many high schools.   Enforcement of these
 measures led to the deaths of two Arabs and the wounding
 of several others.   The government may be seeking in
 part to demonstrate to local Palestinians that the peace
 treaty with Egypt and the coming autonomy negotiations
 have not weakened Israel's resolve to maintain control.
 Even more inflammatory have been recent vigilante
 actions by Jewish extremists both in Jerusalem and on
 the West Bank.   Last month,            followers of extremist Rabbi
 Meir Kahane ransacked the office of the Supreme Islamic
 Council near the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem,  a site
 sacred to both Jews and Muslims.   Kahane has since begun
 organizing an armed "guard."   Groups of Jewish religious

 students also have attempted to pray on the Temple Mount
 in violation of a government prohibition, and have thereby
 sparked Arab rallies to preserve the religious status
 25X1    quo.
 On the West Bank, Gush Emunim settlers last month
 entered Ram Allah,  forced Arabs at gunpoint to clear
 roadblocks,  and "arrested" one Arab youth.   Apparently
 encouraged by the lack of a firm official reprimand,
 settlers at some of the largest West Bank settlements
 have since established self-defense organizations.   They

 Occupation authorities so far have been unwilling
 to clamp down on such vigilante actions.   Defense Minis-
 ter Weizman and police authorities have issued warnings,
 but they have not taken disciplinary actions.   They un-
 doubtedly want to avoid ugly confrontations with fellow
 Israelis, and they may also be influenced by a desire
 not to weaken local Jewish defense capacities.   This re-
 straint, if maintained in the face of continuing Jewish
 provocations, could lead to serious Arab counterefforts.
