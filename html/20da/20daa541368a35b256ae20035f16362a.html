HIGHLIGHTS 
Developments concerning the Atlantic Pact reached 
a new stage during the past week when western European 
public opinion began to exhibit marked concern over the 
?exact position of the US on the military provisions of the 
Pact. Soviet propagandists were quick to seize upon these 
uncertainties as they continued their aggressive campaign 
against the Pact (see page 2). Meanwhile, the rumors which 
continue to emanate from Finland concerning Soviet plans 
for military action in the Scandinavian area are probably 
a related phase of this propaganda campaign. 
The Chinese situation is continuing its Fteady deterio-
ration as the consequence of the disintegration of Nationalist 
political unity and the flat refusal of the Communists to com-
promise on their harsh peace terms (see page 10). The con-
fusion in Nationalist China, increased by Chiang Kai-shek's 
behind-the-scenes activities, is giving impetus to the estab-
lishment of semi-autonomous regimes in non-Communist 
areas. 
The continuing Argentine economic-political crisis 
will probably not result in President Peron's resignation, 
but is likely to force some of his close political associates 
out of office (see page 14). Although Peron apparently has 
found a temporary political solution for the present crisis, 
the basic economic and labor problems remain.

WESTERN EUROPE 
Atlantic Pact In continuing its aggressive propaganda attack 
against the Atlantic Pact, the Kremlin has 
asserted that French adherence would "trample on" the 
Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944. This approach suggests that 
the USSR may be preparing to renounce its treaties with 
France and the UK and possibly also bring the issue of the 
Atlantic Pact before the UN as a threat to peace. During the 
coming weeks, the USSR probably will intensify its efforts 
both to divide and intimidate prospective Pact members, at 
the same time attempting to prove the needlessness of any 
such "aggressive" alliance against the USSR. In addition to 
Norway, the USSR will probably concentrate its attacks on 
such vulnerable countries as Denmark, Iceland, France, and 
Italy. Soviet propaganda will point to delays in concluding 
the Pact in an effort to contribute to the general anxiety con-
cerning US intentions to support militarily its western Euro-
pean allies. 
FRANCE 
German Policy Although prospects for tripartite agreement 
on western Germany have improved some-
what as a result of Foreign Minister Schuraan's recent assur-
ances of increased French cooperation, settlement of the many 
outstanding issues involved in establishing a west German 
state will still be difficult Hypersensitive fear of a strong 
Germany will continue to make the French reluctant to accept 
the US and British position on such matters as the proposed 
tripartite control mechanism,
the status of Berlin in the new 
state, and the introduction of the western mark in Berlin.

ing Communist and Gaullist chances to exploit the German

Issues, will not cause an immediate or substantial reduction 
In French efforts at London to press for an acceptance of 
French views. In the matter of voting procedure for the 
tripartite military control authority, the French have appar-
ently agreed that the US shall have a predominant voice in 
issues of foreign trade and finance; however, they are attempt-
ing to obtain a veto power for the French military governor 
by insisting upon unanimous agreement in matters of "funda-
mental" occupation policy, such as security problems and 
amendments to the German constitution. .The French also 
desire the right of appeal to home governments on lesser 
questions when the three occupation powers disagree. Further-
more, the French oppose the inclusion of the western zones 
of Berlin in the new west German state; will only reluctantly 
and as a last resort agree to the introduction of the western 
mark as the sole currency for the western sectors of Berlin; 
and will continue to press for a decentralized German govern-
ment 
GERMANY 
Cartel System Growing resistance by German politicians 
and business men to attempts by AMG to 
establish "free enterprise" may eventually lead to a revival 
of the pre-war cartel system in Germany. Private business 
Interests as well as political and economic leaders in the 
Laender governments are effectively nullifying AMG policy 
directives. The newly created "Functioning Economic 
Agencies" have assumed control over imports, exports, and 
distribution of raw materials, all hitherto administered by 
the occupying powers. These German agencies are domi-
nated by the trade associations and possess almost unlimited 
powers to restrict trade practices. Moreover, despite AMG

directives abolishing all requirements for business licenses 
except those necessary to protect public health and safety, 
German legislators have thus far delayed amendbla laws 
requiring anyone who desires to open a new business or to 
enlarge an old one to prove his financial and personal relia-
bility and to demonstrate the economic need for such an 
enterprise. Continuation of these German practices will 
create conditions which would greatly facilitate the growth 
of the pre-war cartel system. 
ITALY 
Government Weakness Although De Gasperi leadership 
during the past twelve months has 
enabled Italy to hold the line against inflation and to avoid 
any worsening of the serious unemployment problem, the 
Government has given no evidence of planning a bold, compre-
hensive program of legislative action to advance the general 
public welfare. Some phases of agrarian reform have been 
discussed in Parliament and the Cabinet has promised to 
examine fundamental legislation on this subject; no early 
action can be expected, however, because of disagreement 
within the Christian Democratic Party and opposition to 
this and other reform measures from both the extreme 
Right and the extreme Left. No program appears to be in 
preparation for reorganization of the tax system and of 
state-subsidized industries. More generally, the Govern-
ment appears unable to view such individual problems in 
their relationship to an integrated solution. Another 
measure of Government inactivity is its failure to develop 
a program for effective utilization of US aid to speed long-
range economic improvements.

I 
UN Activity Withdrawal of the USSR, the Ukraine, and 
IByelorussia from the UN World Health Organi-
zation (WHO), rather than indicating a Soviet intent to leave 
the UN, probably reflects a tightening of security measures 
11 and a genuine Soviet doubt regarding the benefits of continued 
participation. Although the USSR expressed dissatisfaction 
with the heavy expenses of membership and asserted that the 
Iorganization's aims had been altered, the Soviet decision to 
withdraw was apparently prompted by: (1) fear that Soviet 
I medical technicians and scientists attending WHO conferences 
may be contaminated and defect to the west; (2) desire to avoid 
further "deviations" by Soviet scientists within the USSR 
Ifrom the doctrine of Soviet supremacy in biological and medical 
science; and (3) reluctance to permit western WHO personnel 
I to enter the Soviet Union. Although the other Satellite repre-
sentatives have not yet indicated whether they will follow the 
Soviet lead, the Yugoslav president of WHO has demonstrated 
I his readiness to work independently with the western repre-
sentatives and will probably remain at his post. 
IChina Policy Soviet desire to keep the Chinese Commu-
nists "in their place" is indicated by the 
I arrest on a charge of espionage of Anna Louise Strong, an 
American journalist who is well-known for writings favor-
able to the USSR and the Chinese Communists. Although 
I most of Miss Strong's recent writings on China have been 
shunned by the Soviet-Satellite press, her articles have been 
prominently featured in Yugoslavia, where there is some 
Idisposition to regard Chinese Communist Leader Mao Tse-
twig as a potential dissident, similar to Tito. Miss Strong 
I reportedly was refused an exit visa to travel to China via 
Vladivostok, but expressed to US officials her determination 
to proceed to Chinese Communist territory despite this Soviet

opposition. Her arrest as an "intelligence agent" and her 
deportation from the USSR seem calculated not only to dis-
credit her in Communist circles generally but also to dis-
courage Mao Tse-tung or Tito from welcoming her. Miss 
Strong's attitude toward the Chinese Communists has appar-
ently negated some 25 years of propagandizing the Soviet 
cause. Soviet leaders also probably consider her too closely 
identified with the old Communist propaganda claim that the 
Chinese Communists are independent of Moscow. This line, 
In view of the vastly increased power and prestige of the 
Chinese Communist Party, has become potentially unreward-
ing for the Kremlin and will probably be abandoned soon. 
HUNGARY 
Financial Crisis The USSR may be forced to grant a 
foreign-exchange or gold loan to Hun-
gary, as has been done recently for Czechoslovakia, in 
order to bolster the Hungarian financial position and to 
forestall serious retardation of Hungary s industrial pro-
duction. Hungary's critical foreign exchange position has 
been caused chiefly by: (1) increased orientation of ex-
ports to the USSR; (2) deliveries on account of reparations 
to the USSR; and (3) use of hard currency reserves for 
western imports. 
GREECE 
Military Situation The psychological effects of the dis-
missal of General Markos, as well as 
local military developments are providing the Greek Army

guerrillas. The signs of dissension within the Communist 
ranks which marked the ousting of Markos seem to have 
lowered guerrilla morale and improved that of the Greek 
Army, which has been further heartened by the windup of 
the prolonged anti-terrorist campaign in the Pelopomiesus. 
Moreover, the larger guerrilla concentrations now being 
led by Zachariades will provide the Greek Army with a 
better opportunity for effective operations. Although 
the army's slow action permitted the guerrillas who seized 
Karpenision to withdraw with some 2,000 forced recruits, 
the army has shown new spirit in its successful defenses of 
Serrai and of Florina, from which some 4,000 guerrillas 
are now in retreat. A newly effected revision of command 
structure for northern and central Greece may facilitate 
more rapid action against future guerrilla raids. These 
army advantages, however--both psychological and.tactical--
will be only temporary unless the army can utilize them more 
vigorously, without becoming overconfident.

NEAR EAST-AFRICA 
Rhodes Deadlock As the Egyptian-Israeli armistice nego-
tiations at Rhodes enter the second month, 
agreement appears to be as far aim as ever. The UN Acting 
Mediator's proposals for a compromise were accepted with 
minor changes by Egypt but were rejected by the Israelis, who 
are outspoken in their determination to impose a "victor's 
peace." Meanwhile, although several of the other Arab states 
have tentatively agreed to initiate negotiations with Israel, 
their full agreement is contingent upon successful conclusion 
of the Egyptian talks. The UN Conciliation Commission con-
tinues to keep aloof from the current discussions, fearing 
that if it should become identified with an unsuccessful out-
come, its subsequent efforts to reach a settlement would be 
prejudiced. On the credit side of the ledger should be entered 
the fact that hostilities in Palestine have not been resumed 
during the talks and that neither Egypt nor Israel has taken 
the decisive step of withdrawing from the parley. It appears 
Increasingly unlikely, however, that the Rhodes conference 
will provide any solid foundation for a permanent peace. 
IRAN 
Shah's Plans Following the recent attempt on his life, the 
Shah appears determined to take action which 
may have serious repercussions in Iran. Exasperated by the 
chronic irresponsibility and inaction of the Majlis, he has 
long advocated legislation and constitutional reform which 
would allocate greater powers to him. Although the Shah has 
thus far followed US-UK advice not to act precipitately, he 
Is now apparently convinced that the recent attempt on his 
life has brought about a national crisis and that strong meas-
ures are needed. He is reportedly planning to dissolve the

Majlis and to summon a constituent assembly in the near 
future. In thus attempting to gain greater powers, the Shah 
Is probably motivated by a sincere desire to strengthen Iran 
as well as by personal ambition. It seems likely, however, 
that sudden and drastic action on his part would arouse the 
anger of Iranian liberals and of those conservative elements 
opposed to granting him more power. The resultant poli-
tical confusion might well facilitate Soviet exploitation and 
infiltration, the very things from which the Shah is seeking 
to protect Iran. 
ISRAEL 
Air-Sea Traffic Despite active Egyptian opposition, the 
new Israeli state may succeed in retain-
ing Satellite-scheduled air service and in establishing ade-
quate surface transportation with the rest of the world. 
Egypt's refusal to permit commercial air operations into 
Cairo by air carriers serving Israel virtually bars all 
scheduled western air carriers from Israel, and scheduled 
service has thus far been restricted to the Czechoslovak 
airline. Acquisition by Czechoslovakia of the new Soviet 
IL-12 air transports, which are capable of non-stop flights 
to Israel from points in either Yugoslavia or Bulgaria, may 
enable the Czechoslovaks effectively to circumvent US-UK 
efforts to prevent Satellite air operations in the Middle 
East. Israel's attempts to establish surface transportation 
under its own control are also progressing satisfactorily. 
The new Israel-America line has already acquired 7 of the 
10 vessels estimated to be necessary for hauling virtually 
all US exports to Israel.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Prospects for a negotiated peace in China continue to 
deteriorate as a result of further disintegration of the National-
ist position and the Communists' refusal to compromise on their 
harsh peace terms. Meanwhile, the struggle for power in non-
Communist China is growing more intense, and the increasing 
confusion of authority within the National Government is giving 
Impetus to the establishment of semi-autonomous non-Commu-
nist regimes. 
Chiang's Role Chiang Kai-shek is still playing an important 
role in the behind-the-scenes struggle for con-
trol of the remaining Nationalist resistance forces. Despite his 
reported assurances to Acting President Li Tsung-jen that he 
would not participate in Chinese politics for the next five years, 
Chiang continues to exercise considerable influence in the opera-
tion of the National Government through his hold over many civil-
ian and military officials. He remains leader of the Kuomintang, 
which dominates the Government, and is particularly influential 
among military leaders in the Shanghai-Nanking area, Chinese 
Air Force personnel, and Nationalist administrators in Taiwan. 
The Chiang-appointed Cabinet now in Canton continues to ict 
independently of Li who has remained in Nanking. 
Kwangsi Clique A unified Nationalist resistance to the Commu-
nists is further threatened by the reported 
plans of General Pal Chung-hsi. Pal supports Acting President 
Li and commands the personal loyalty of the troops in the Hankow 
area, one of the few remaining Nationalist troop concentrations. 
Recent evidence indicates Pal does not intend to defend Hankow, 
if the Communists strike for that area, but will probably move 
far south to his native province of Kwangsi, where he may seek 
to establish his own regime.

CHINA 
Northwest Autonomy Centralized Nationalist control 
over the northwest provinces is 
threatened by the recent activities of General Chang Chill-
chung, who was sent by Li to Sinkiang to negotiate a trade 
agreement with the USSR. Chang conferred en route with 
Moslem leaders of the ncrthwest provinces who reportedly 
plan to resist the Chinese Communists and to establish a 
northwest "anti-Communist" defense bloc. Realizing the 
futility of his dealing with the Chinese Communists as a 
representative of the impotent Li, Chang has resigned from 
the official Nanking peace delegation and may be preparing 
to sever all connection with the National Government. Chang 
will presumably still proceed to Sinkiang, but he is expected 
to negotiate in his own interests. Conclusion of a Sinkiang 
agreement with the USSR would probably result in the 
creation of autonomous regimes for Sinkiang and parts of 
the other northwest provinces under the leadership of Chang 
and local warlords. 
Communist Regimes Completing the picture of the pro-
gressive fragmentation of China, the 
Chinese Communists have announced that the 45 million 
people of the recently "liberated" provinces between the 
Yellow and Yangtze Rivers will soon have a "unified demo-
cratic government" elected by a "congress of people's 
representatives." This Central Plains government would 
be the third such regime in Communist China. The forma-
tion of this latest regional government and the fact that the 
Chinese Communist armies have called a halt short of 
objectives which they could easily seize suggest that Com-
munist military conquests have outrun preparations for ? 
political consolidation. Because of this lack of consolidation, 
it may take several months for the Chinese Communists to 
create a national government for all of China which could 
claim international recognition.

INDONESIA 
Dutch Intentions The apparent intention of the Dutch 
Cabinet to accept, with reservations, 
the Security Council resolution on Indonesia may open the 
way for renewed negotiations for an Indonesian settlement. 
Fall of the Dutch Cabinet over Indonesian policy was 
averted by the appointment of a more liberal Minister of 
Overseas Territories. This selection indicates that For-
eign Minister Stikker plans to exercise greater leadership 
In the effort to reach a sediment on Indonesia. Stikker may 
also take a direct part in renewed negotiations with Indo-
nesian Republican leaders. Meanwhile, although inter-party 
agreement has not been reached on the extent to which the 
Dutch are willing to meet SC demands,the Cabinet, after 
sharp parliamentary criticism, will probably receive the 
support necessary for implementing a milder policy. 
However, despite this milder policy and Stikker's excellent 
chances of winning the confidence of Republicans in Indo-
nesia, Stikker's efforts to reach a speedy agreement will 
probably be hindered by binding Instructions from both the 
Cabinet and Parliament. 
BURMA 
British Policy The possibility that the full-scale civil 
warfare in South Burma will lead to 
anarchy and dissolution of the present Burmese Goverment 
Is a cause of increasing concern to the UK. British interests 
throughout Asia would be seriously affected by the further 
reduction of Burmese rice exports. Such a reduction would 
have severe repercussions in such areas as Malaya, India, 
Pakistan, and Ceylon. In addition, if the Burmese Govern-
ment either disintegrates completely or falls under Commu-
nist domination, some 50 million pounds in British capital

BURMA 
Investments in Burma (already nationalised or threatened 
with naticsalixation) would probably be liquidated without 
compensation. The UK is thus considering some indirect 
method of bolstering the present Burmese regime, possibly 
by means of a Joint loan front the UK and other countries. 
SIAM 
Anti-Royalist Group A more stable Siamese Government 
Is in prospect if recent moves by 
Premier Phibul to join forces with other anti-Royalists 
come to fruition. In a recent conciliatory broadcast pre-
sumably directed at Pridi, exiled former premier, Phibul 
declared that he would support any action which would unite 
Siam or prevent a national calamity. The developments 
motivating this overture probably are an increase of 
Royalist representation in the government, the Royalist 
nature of the new constitution, and Phibul's diminishing 
ability to exact the undisputed loyalty of army and police 
elements. Phibul and Pridi are the most important figures 
of the 1932 civilian-military clique which overthrew Siam's 
absolute monarchy and established a constitutional monarchy. 
Since 1932, governmental control has remained with one or 
the other of the rival factions of the clique but, despite poll-
tical differences, they have always united to prevent the 
Royalists from repining political control. If, however, the 
two factions reach an agreement, Pridi may emerge the 
dominant political figure and a Siamese government might 
result which would favor increased cooperation with the 
west and greater participation in Asian affairs.

WE HEMISPZERE 
ARGENTINA 
Crisis Continues The continuing Argentine economic-poli-
tical crisis, although apt to force some 
of Peroses close political associates out of office, is unlikely 
to result in the resignation of Peron himself. In response to 
Army pressure, Peron reportedly has agreed to dissociate 
Senora Peron from the government and to renew his hitherto 
futile efforts to deal with the country3s acute economic and 
labor problems. Indicative of Peron's problems is the current 
primers? strike, which has deprived Buenos Aires of news-
papers since 8 February. If the government persists in using 
charges of Communism as a pretext for jailing the printers, 
it will discredit this procedure as a means of resisting more 
serious and widespread inflationary wage demands in the 
future. On the other hand, if the government compels the 
publishers to grant the printers' demands, it will compromise 
its anti-inflationary stand against wage increases.

THE PLIGHT OF THE ARAB REFUGEES 
The future of the more than 700,000 Arab refugees 
remains unsettled. Israel has no intention of permitting their 
return in any substantial numbers, and the Arab states are 
neither willing nor able to absorb them. Israel is preoccupied 
with assimilating immigrants from other countries, and Israeli 
spokesmen declare that Israel's economy cannot support the 
return of the Arabs and that in any event their return would 
endanger Israeli security. In taking over Arab property for 
their own use, the Israelis assert that they are merely taking 
advantage of a situation which they themselves did not create. 
The countries neighboring Palestine have stretched 
their resources as far as possible in extending temporary 
aid to the refugees and would be unable to absorb the refugees 
permanently without assistance from outside. Iraq with 5,000 
refugees and Transjordan with over 80,000 have an additional 
responsibility for 200,000 in central Arab Palestine--a constant 
drain on almost non-existent resources. Syria with 100,000 is 
weeks behind in its dole program. Lebanon is nearly bank-
rupt; furthermore, the 90,000 refugees now in the country 
could not be integrated into its delicately balanced Christian-
Moslem grouping. The 8,000 refugees in Egypt are all that 
the Egyptians can handle; the 250,000 in the coastal area of 
Palestine occupied by the Egyptian Army endure the worst 
conditions of all. 
The danger exists that the refugees, once they are 
fully aware of their plight, will be so embittered as to become 
a source of permanent unrest in the Arab world. Scattered 
riots have already occurred, and thievery is increasing. As 
idle malcontents, the refugees could be readily exploited by 
subversive elements. Employment would go far toward dissi-
pating this danger, but it is not available in the impoverished

Arab states. Foreign financing would be necessary for 
projects which would both provide a livelihood for the refu-
gees and promote permanent resettlement. Vast undeveloped 
regions in Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Arab Pales-
tine could be utilized for such projects as irrigation, fisheries, 
roads, and oil pipe lines. Administration would be difficult, 
and the reward to investors might not be immediate, but the 
refugees would face exile with less hostility if they could look 
forward to permanent shelter and regular meals.

SOVIET PLANS FOR AN EAST GERMAN STATE 
Further Communist designs to integrate eastern 
Germany into the political and economic system of the 
Soviet bloc were apparent at the recent Socialist Unity Party 
(SED) Congress in Berlin. Speeches by Satellite delegates 
and Congress approval of the Oder-Neisse line as Germany's 
eastern boundary laid renewed stress on Communist efforts 
to reconcile the Satellite states to closer collaboration with 
the Soviet Zone and to eventual inclusion of the area in the 
Soviet orbit. Other action at the Congress indicates that the 
USSR is still attempting to insure Communist control of 
east Germany. By reviving advocacy of a "broad democratic 
front,' the Communists are seeking the political support of 
formerly uncooperative elements. The establishment of an 
SED "Politburo was designed to discipline the SED in order 
to make it a more effective instrument of Communist control. 
The reversal of the SED stand for the incorporation 
of Berlin into the Soviet Zone indicates that the Communists 
believe the Berlin impasse will continue. In line with the 
Soviet theme of a "unified Germany,' this tactical renunciation 
of Communist claims that Berlin is an integral part of the 
Soviet Zone may be designed to combat possible inclusion of 
the three western sectors of the city in a west German govern-
ment. Moreover, by omitting Berlin from a future east German' 
state, the USSR may feel that it can insure control over the 
new state by maintaining Soviet troops there to guard com-
munication lines to a Soviet garrison in Berlin. Although the 
Congress again stressed the theme of German unity, Com-
munist tactics at the Congress once more suggest that the 
USSR intends to create an east German state which will claim 
sovereignty over all Germany. The formation of such a 
state would probably be timed to counter the formation of a 
west German provisional government.
