SOURCE(S) CLASS./CONTROL(S) TDOS 314/09475 6-10 2.01xl.t/UPD 6-10 A French political analyst, considered a reliable reporter, heard from Jacques l3aumel ( Secgon of the Gaullist UDR) vho in turn got it from Jacques Foccart ( Elyse� Socgen for African and Malagsysay Affairs) that complete amnesty would be announced Tor all individuals who were convicted of crimes against the stdto involving the Algerian crisis. According to Foccart this would specifically include General Salan and Colonel Argoud both presently serving life sentences Field Cement: There have been persistent rumors that Salan and Argoud were to be released as a result of some deal between Degaulle and the military and/or rightists. These rumors have been strengthened by the return to France of former Premier Bidault who broke with Dogaulle over Al8cria in 1962 and who had since been in exile in Latin Amorica and more recently, in Belgium. Also there was the announcement by extreme rightist Jean Louis Tixior�Vignancour that he had "rallied" behind Degaulle and further rumors that Jacques Soustolle was about to return to France. It is not known whether an agreementias rumoredi was reached but reliable sources have reported that leading Gaullist ministers were raking efforts to rally veterans orgalizations behind Degaulle as well as 411persons associated with the general during tho resistance years. INR C-mment: If there was an agreement with the far right about amnesty for for,Ier Algerian opponents, it does not appear to have included any comittment by the right to either openly support the Gaullist in the current election, or oven for that natter to keep discreetly silant. ault� although declining to run for electon, spoke out in opposition to Gaullism almost the very moment he returned to F ance. Moreover, the TimPs this morning reports that Tixier�Vignancour withdrew his Kay 30 call for support of the Gaullists and called upon his gollowers to boycott the elections0 however, it is certainly possible that rightist elements would have specified comp ' amnesty as full or partial price for supporting the generalQi and the situation -,round May 30 was clearly desperate enough for him to have agreed to pay it.

SOURCE(S) 0 D13-315/02019-68 10 RNA Comment: CLASS./CONTROL(S) DA A roliAble source who reported he obtained the information from the Commanding Officer of the First Armored Division reported that the Div- ision had been provided with 200 new T-59 tanks from Communist China. Since it received there replacement T-59's, the U,rst Armored Division has made available to infantry divisions for reconnaiaance use the approx. 100 T-59 tanks it has-been using since 1966. Field comment: The source was allowed to view the tank area, and concluded from glimpses of portions of tank visible under tarpaulins that they were new or barely used. The same source had reported previously that the First Armore d Division was on Pakistan's priority list to receive new armr, The same source also reported (in July 1967) that Pakistan had 300 Chinese-provided tanks. At the. time, many fewer tanks were deployed, nn itimay be that some were stored. Another pos- sibility is that the tanks are new acquisitions,, since the Commanding Officer of the First Armor-I cc' Division told the source in ?arch 1965 that Pakistan planned to purchase more military equip ment from China, which the source presumed to refer to tanks. As of April of this year Pakistan wa., believed to have on hand at least 55 T-34 tanks China and at least 160 T-59' s, The presence of the T-34's is accounted for in this later report, which says the 12th Cavalry has about 50 T-34 tanks. The total of 300 T-59 tanks, on the other hand, far exceeds earlier estimates. The source reports that each of four regiments has about 50 T-59 tanks, and from his tour of the tank area of three of the fouri divisions he believes all these tanks to be new. Since we know that T-59 tanks a in the Pakistan Army, the report that older T-59 tanks will be sent to other regiments appears plausible. On the basis of this report the Pakistan inventory of T-59 tanks should be revised upward to 200 plus. Further report5.ng may give us a basis for further revision if the distribution of T-59 tanicc. formerly used by the First Armored Division does in fact take place. Pakistan's procurement of T-59 tanks from Communist China must be viewed in tho context of its continued difficulties in obtaining tanks in Europe, where long negotiations with Italy and Belgium have not yet resulted in th shient of any surplus M-47 tanks to Pak- istan (see IntelliOnce Note 4 f June 7, 1968).

Lately there have been some signs that the candidacy of Prieto (who broke from the governing Accion Dsmocratica --AD-- when it nominat,2d party leader Gonzalo Batrios despite Prieto's primary vic&amp;ary) has peaked a little early.

Thang There have been fundamental improvements in ARVN,- and the initiative in IV Corps appears to be in hands of the GVN rather than the VC. The VC mill position is deterioratira; he has serious morale and supply problems, and attrition and desertion rates are heavy. The VC still can and do interdict CCs, harass outposts and RD teams, and mortar air- fields and cities. But they follow economy-of-force tactics and are taking heavy casualties. There is little evidence that the new VC revolutionary ccemi tees have taken root. As long as Gen. Mang is in =emend. the VC position will continue a slow but steady deterioration and the GVN position will ireprove. However, the VC organizational structure in IV Corps is still effective and largely intact in the countryside, and there will be no mass VC defections. VC problems in IV Corps are not new. Prior to Tet the tide had turned against them, but their true strength was difficult to assess because of ARVNI1 traditional lack of aggressiveness. The VC inability to follcw up on their initial Tet attacks on urban areas gave Strong evidence of their true capabilities, and ARVN has become more aggressive . under Gen. Thang. Therefore, what may now appear to be a sudden weakening of VC forces in the Delta may be a manifestation or previous problems brought to light by the recent GVE offensive efforts. REA Comment: In onr judgment this report by CAS staff officers has considerably over- stated the GVN posture and understated VC posture in IV Corps. Indeed, CAS reporting from this area has tended to suggest an appreciable improvement in VC assets in IV Corps, even though it also has recognized that the reassertion of GVN military operations in the area has reduced the degree of success that the VC enjoyed during and shortly after the Tet - Offensive. In fact, this was the general thrust of a CAS staff officers' assessment for IV Corps as recently as June 3. For example. the June 3 report stated that Gen. Thang's widely heralded "offensive� was in some cases being conducted only in a statistical sense with ARVN making little attempt to make =tact with the eneuly; that the organization of Liberation Councils in VC-controlled areas is common; and that there is a feeling of fear in Some areas that the VC may be capable of overrunning major provincial positions inclu province capitals.

CLASS./CONTROL(s) Paris Al? filed a report from their Moscow corresFon- dent on the reported removal from office of Komsomol chief Sergey Pavlov. Report based an "well-informed" So/let source who also claimed Pavlov will head Soviet Commission on Physical Culture. Embassy Moscow ascertained that both AFF and UPI correspondents heard from different sources same story. Both correspondents puzzled by timing of such a move in view of current ideological campaign with which Pavlov must be in deep sympathy. Both speculated only on possible causes of such a move and suggested that ties with Shelepin or dissatisfaction with views and mood of Soviet youth may be possible reasons. Embassy noted identification of Pavlov as Komsomol leader on a schedule still valid an June 6, but does not rule out possibility that unconfirmed rumors might be accurate. No announcement has yet appeared of a Komsomol plenum, which has the power to uch mze personnel shifts as the replacement of the Komsomol first secretary. In s casts doubt on the authenticity of the above rumors, but does not remove the possibiliti of such a move in the near future. We agree that the timing of Pavlov's removal now would be bad in view of the regime's strenuous policy of cracking down on ideological dissent. Pavlov has served the regime faithfully in past moments of similar stress, the most notorious of which probably was his denunciation of Boris Pasternak as a pig. The most probable causes for dismissal of Pavlov would be his inclusion in the Shelopin coterie, which inspired repeated forecasts last year of his eventual dismissal, and the dissatisfaction of the regime with the degree of apathy and disaffection among Soviet youth, especially among university students. Youthful support for literary dissenters was ,an essential ingredient in the gist= events connected with the trials of Sinyayskiy and, more recently, Ginsburg. Fear that university youths and intellectuals may espouse some of the radical ideas currently endorsed by the New Left in Western Europe has inspired extraordinar� ily bitter denunciations in the Soviet press, the most of outstanding of which was Yuriy Zhukov/ tion againdtthe doctrines of Herbert Marcus() in the May 30 edition of Prnvea. Concern, youthful misdemeaneors, adoption of heterodox attitudes, and the development of local nationalism in the non-Russian republics was highlighted E in the May 8 speech of the Moldavian Party Secretary, which was discussed in our memorandum of last Monday, RS13-85. The failure of the above stories to include the name of a successor to Pavlov sugests that, even if the move is in the offing, all the necessary steps and arrangements have not yet been made and may be subject to politicking.

The President reportedly told the commission that the government was not opposed Machado's return to political life and stated that he could run for president. Leoni stated that his government does not intend to place obstacles in the political paths of the machado or any one else who shows that he is not a partisan of armed insurrection against the ernment of Venezuela. He observed that althou0 the Party is still illegal the columnists now have the Union for Advancement "which is almost the same thing." The benister of Interior also told Party members Vie same thing. AR Comment: This reflects pretty much the GOV's policy of sep- arating the less violence oriented PCV leaders from the Castroil insurgency movement. The Cubans have angrily denounced the PCN's abandonment of revolutionary warfare and their attempt to par- ticipate in the electoral process. Leoni may also be payinv off some debts as there has been some suspicion that the PCV has supplied the Government with information which has led to the capture or killing of guerrilla members. The GOV is also intent on renewing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and may. be prepared to allow some communist activity as a sign of its good faith."

The Philippine crew members of the tug-- boat will be released "without any TVITTIAll con- dition" in view of the Philippine recognition. of Cambodian borders. b. The tugboat (owned by a Philippine firm and under charter to YISTS) will not be released, since to do so would mean similar treatment for 60 Thai trawlers and foreign boats seized by Cambodia under the same circumstances. (Iegles said the Cambodian Ambassador will, how- ever, continue his effort to get the tugboat released). :Ea the two USRP's, Ingles said the RKG.had stiffened its attitude since receipt of Amb. Bowles' request for their release. Matters were not helped any by the recent US air attack in the same area where the tugboat was apprehended. � We have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the Ingles memorandum. Following the release of the Filipino crew, it would became much more diffi cult to obtain similar treatment for the,Atiiicans. Agree that Sihanouk has stiffened his terms following receppt of the Bolo s letter but even more following the two alleged US border violations on May 30-31, one of which involving a US tar attack on a Cambodian border post on the Mekong. According to a May 29 press account, Sihanouk demanded twe bulldozere in exchange for the Americans. He is now demanding a border declaration from � the US.

Arab official reaction to the shooting, an can be expected, is one of regret. Most responsible Arab officials recognize potential for anti-Arab propaganda in fact that a Palestinian Arab has been arrested for the murder. Moreover, at least until Robert Kennedy's recent speech on the Middle &amp;est, the Senator's image in the Arab world had been relatively good. Arabs have fond memories of the late President Kennedy, Whom they considered relatively sympathetic to--or at least less indifferent to-eArab IEEMEIMEKX points of view. This, as well an the Sate Senatorws views on Vietnam contributed to hopes in some Arab evertors that if nominated and elected President the Senator might review current US policies in the Middle East On the more popular and on the press level, the assassination of the Senator is being HAMM treated with some ambivalence. Most Arabs deplore the crime but allege that it has served to dramatize the Arabs' feedings of frustration with What they believe is the US' whole-hearted commitment to Israel. At the same time there is a tendency to see in the crime (as many Arabs professed to see in the assassination of President Kennedy) a "Zionist conspiracy" to dinoredit the Arabs. Although Israeli sources have speculated that the alleged murderer, Sirhan Sirhan, was connected with an Arab terratist arganiza- tion, no Arab group has thus far stepped forward to claim credit for the act.

Kosygin have health problems normal to a man of his age (64) and responsibilitie aintained a very heavy work schedule since his vacation last August0 In of his attitude toward his work as his main reason for existence, resignation on the grounds of illness, were it to occur, would be reminiscent of Khrushchev "resimation" on the grounds of old age* There have been many rumors circulated in MOSCOW within the last year of the possible removal, willing or otherwise, of Kosygin from the premiers p. hut the Ufdl Ambassador one of the sources for such rumors, has recently changed his tune and reported this May that Soviet sources no longer say that Kosygin wants to retire. On the political front, it remains true that Kosygin is the only Politburo member not to have spoken before a local audience in support of the April Plenum decisions, which officially sanctioned the crackdown on ideology backed earlier by Brezhnev and Kosygin himself in February speeches. The other oft-rumored bone of contention between factions led by Brezhnev and Kosyf n is the Soviet policy toward changes in Prague with Kosygin pictured as the counsellor of moderation.

INR/RAF Comment: The recent and continuing series of anti-American outbursts appearsto be the work of radical activists in Prime Minister Siaka 5tevens governing All People's Congress (APC) party. Though Stevens himself has sometimes taken an anti-Western anti-American line, we doubt he intended to let things go this far. But it has become increasingly apparent that the newly-seated PM is unable to exert his authority over the party, army, or police and is justifiably fearful of opponents within and outside of this regime.
