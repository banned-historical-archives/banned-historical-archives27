 Atmospherics: Waitin  for the Other Shoe To Drop
 Unity and stability have been the watchwords
 from Peking since early this year, but the Chinese
 people, accustomed to nine years of relative in-
 stability, keep looking for--and are finding--what
 they see as signs of continuinq political uncer-
 tainties.   Mao's prolonged absence from Peking,
 his still unannounced return, and Chou's long
 hospitalization have undoubtedly contributed to
 popular malaise.  Moreover, the moderate tone of
 the current campaign to study the proletarian
 dictatorship continues to be interpreted by many
 Chinese as the calm before the storm.
 Popular skepticism is perhaps best expressed
 in the apparently widespread rumor that Chou's
 hospitalization is actually the result of an as-
 sassination attempt.   Officials in Canton, evidently
 sensing differences between Mao and Chou, claim that
 Mao has taken no action against the would-be assassin.
 Chou's followers allegedly believe Mao is either pro-
 tecting the assassin or was himself behind the attempt.
 The Soviets have apparently picked up the assassina-
 tion rumor and have referred to a recent attempt to
 poison Chou.  Although there seems to be no basis in
 fact for such rumors, they pointedly illustrate Chinese
 doubts about--and perhaps disbelief in--the unity
 and stability theme.
 Further reservations about Peking's official
 line surfaced in rumors about the demotion of mili-
 tary man Li Te-sheng from party vice chairman to
 ordinary member of the Politburo.  The official ex-
 planation from Peking was that Li requested the
 demotion.  Canton officials believe, however, that
 Li had a run-in with Vice Premier Chen Yung-kuei, a
 favorite of Mao's whom Li allegedly ousted from a
 meeting of political and military officials.

 Since his elevation to a vice premiership, one-
 time model peasant Chen has turned in a creditable
 performance, most notably on. his recent trip to Mexico.
 He now seems at viable government leader rather than a
 token representativEe of the Chinese peasantry, but
 there are signs that: he is not universally popular.
 Canton officials claim that military men other than Li
 dislike Chen because the vice premier is responsible
 for the unpopular policy of sending demobilized service-
 men to work in the rural areas.
 Another sign of possible opposition to Chen is
 the propaganda play given to the Hsiaochinchuang
 production brigade in a way that might be intended
 to steal the thunder from Chen's own Tachai model
 brigade.  The Hsiaochinchuang brigade is associated
 with Chiang Ching, and it would be interesting if
 both the military and Chiang Ching dislike Chen.  If
 true, this would be another sign that Madame Mao and
 the military have found common ground and would lend
 credence to the rumor that she and other leftists in
 Peking are behind the protests of demobilized servicemen.
 Apart from rumors among local officials, there
 are some sign, of cracks beneath the surface unity.
 A military man in NCNA, using a slogan attributed
 .to Chiang Ching, reportedly attacked in wall posters
 the rehabilitated NCNA chief Chu Mu-chih as a "right-
 ist."                              The military man, placed in NCNA during the
 Cultural Revolution, has reportedly since been trans-
 ferred to another government organization and has not
 been publicly identified in his NCNA post since Decem-
 ber 1973.   Ch-4.i Mu-chih, on the other hand, continues
 to appear regularly and to be identified as chief of
 NCNA.
 Although Peking apparently moved swiftly to
 defuse the situation and support Chu Mu-chih, the
 NCNA episode is symptomatic of the continuing
 resentment by both the leftists and the military
 against rehabilitated officials overthrown during

 the Cultural Revolution.  This is a long-standing
 problem with no easy or quick solution, but Peking's
 ability to deal with it smoothly is a plus on the
 stability side.
 Local officials are understandably dubious
 about the new emphasis on unity and stability, but
 they do seem to be overdramatizing the signs of
 continuing friction and underestimating Peking's
 determination to contain those differences.  More-
 over, their doubts make unity and stability more
 difficult to achieve, a situation that Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-ping seemed to address when he told the
 Central Committee last January that the government's
 priority task is to establish a good reputation for
 itself.  Although Peking's emphasis on unity and
 stability seems genuine, it will apparently take
 some time before the government establishes the good
 reputation it needs.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/

 Cautious Rectification
 The proletarian dictatorship campaign seems to
 be moving toward the rectification phase that has
 been anticipated by many provincial cadre for weeks.
 On May 10, for the first time since the campaign
 began, a province--Kwangtung--openly called for
 rectification of its basic-level party units.   In
 addition, an article in this month's Red Flag by
 Kiangsi first secretary Chiang Wei-ching--after
 reaffirming the campaign's moderate themes and re-
 hashing its now familiar problems--seems to set out
 some guidelines for rectification work.
 Chinese leaders--still anxious about the ex-
 cesses of the anti-Confucius campaign--clearly in-
 tend to keep rectification work controlled and limited.
 Peking wants to tighten its control over the economy
 and increase cadre responsiveness to party direc-
 tives, but without sparking further disruptions; a
 new political witch hunt is being avoided.
 Moderation is the keynote.  The Kwangtung article
 specifically admonishes cadre to carry out rectifi-
 cation work in a "planned and systematic" manner and
 counsels against precipitate action.   Kwangtung ap-
 parently has entrusted local rectification work to
 special teams under the control of the provincial
 party committee, undoubtedly to maintain a tight rein.
 Chiarig's article stresses education, not purges, as
 the true objective of the proletarian dictatorship
 campaign,  intimating in the process that relatively
 few cadre are in danger of losing their jobs.   He
 also warns cadre to be alert to the "handful of people
 who make trouble" to serve their own ends.
 An effort is also being made to restrict the
 number of permissible targets.   Kwangtung Province
 is clearly limiting its efforts to cadre at the

 county level and below.  Chiang, too, is focusing
 on the activities of well-to-do peasants and basic-
 level cadre.                      Abuses at the provincial level, which
 are likely to be just as prevalent but have a far
 greater potential for political mayhem, seem to be
 carefully excluded.  Perhaps to underline the nec-
 essity for caution in carrying out rectification,
 Chiang'a  article mentions in passing the need to
 exonerate individuals unfairly criticized in the
 past.  Chiang speaks from experience, as he is a
 rehabilitated cadre.
 Criticism will apparently focus on improper
 economic practices among the peasantry and petty
 corruption and abuses of authority by low level
 cadre.   The Chiang article, in particular, lashes
 out at all individuals who ignore or subvert state
 production plans and party directives.  Peasants are
 scored for their preoccupation with "cash crops"
 and the pursuit of private gain at the expense of
 the collective.  Cadre are also taken to task for a
 variety of sins, including maladministration, in-
 fluence peddling, and showing favoritism to friends
 and relatives.  By and large, Peking seems determined
 to keep the larger question of political transgres-
 sions outside the scope of the campaign.
 As the campaign takes up rectification, Peking
 is taking pains to repeat once again that moderate
 economic policies are not changing.   In his article,
 Chiang specifically states that peasants may con-
 tinue farming their private plots and participate
 in rural free markets as long as the "predominance
 of the collective economy" is assured.  Moreover,
 Chiang asserts that these policies must continue
 for a long time because China needs "stability of
 policies"--a phrase taken from Teng Isiao-ping's
 secret address to the Central Committee plenum last
 January.

 The rectification rhetoric is likely to exacer-
 bate the factionalism in the more troubled provinces,
 despite Peking's efforts to keep the proletarian dic-
 tatorship campaign low keyed and controlled.  Accord-
 ing to 'Western press reports, rival groups in Che-
 kiang are already using the campaign to attack one
 another.  Most provinces, however, are likely to
 fare better.  Almost all seem certain to handle
 rectification work with great caution and, indeed,
 Kwangtu:ng is still the only province to speak openly
 on the subject.   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 New Pipelines
 China is involved in a multimillion dollar con-
 struction program to build pipelines to exploit its
 extensive petroleum resources. At its outset, the
 program was aimed mainly at overcoming limitations
 for transporting crude oil within China. The need
 to pay for rising imports and the sudden increase
 in world oil prices in 1973, however,  led the Chinese
 to accelerate pipeline construction to take advantage
 of new export opportunities.
 The sudden push in construction has increased the
 nation's pipeline network to more than 3,600 miles,
 five times the 700 miles that existed in 1970 when
 the program began. More than 1,500 miles were laid
 in 1974 alone.
 After the world oil crisis in 1973, Peking
 shifted the direction of the program to support
 export-oriented activities. New pipelines were built
 to link the producing oil fields of the northeast
 and Manchuria to deep-water ports suitable for tank-
 ers used in the international oil trade. At the same
 time, oil ports were improved,  and a major new port
 capable of handling supertankers is being built near
 Dairen.
 The new pipelines and associated port improve-
 ments promise to make China a major crude oil ex-
 porter to the non-communist countries of Asia. Crude
 exports have grown from 1 million tons in 1973 to 4.5
 million tons in 1974. The new pipelines will enable
 China to handle scheduled exports of 10to 12 million
 tons this year and 20 million tons in 1977.
 Crude oil earnings are now the single largest
 source of hard currency,  and this source will grow
 over the next few years.  If planned pipelines and

 port facilities are completed as expected, China
 will have the capability to export 50 million tons
 of crude oil by 1980. At current prices, exports
 on that scale would yield some $4 billion dollars
 annually.  (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 the three black Rhodesian liberation groups, based
 in Zambia, to unite under the aegis of the African
 National Council  (ANC)  and enter into talks with
 the white minority government in Salisbury.   Lusaka
 has also proceeded to make sure that the three guer-
 rilla groups in the ANC could not individually con-
 tinue their operations against Rhodesia.
 These moves have not gone down well with the
 Chinese.  Peking has backed the Zimbabwe African
 National Union (ZANU) since the 1960s, and at the
 time of the recent crackdown it seemed to be in

 the best position to wage an effective campaign
 against the Rhodesian government.   ZANU's chief
 rival is the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU),
 which is backed by the Soviet Union.
 From the time that Kaunda first began to take
 these initiatives, the Chinese did little to hide
 their feelings.  NCNA began to stress the importance
 of armed struggle in southern Africa, while dispar-
 aging negotiations as a "political deception" fos-
 tered by Rhodesia and South Africa to split the
 ranks of the black nationalists.  The Chinese have
 also used diplomatic channels to try to turn the
 Zambians around.
 Sino-Zambian relations took a sharp turn for
 the worse last month when Peking lodged a strong
 protest over Lusaka's decision to close down all
 guerrilla training camps, including ZANU's.  For
 their part, the Zambians are angered by China's
 position.   Suspicions have also been raised and
 Kaunda reportedly has told his security services to
 monitor Chinese instructors currently training the
 Zambian army.
 Peking obviously believes that the stakes are
 high enough to spend some of the political capital
 that it has accumulated over the years in Lusaka.
 The Chinese may calculate that Salisbury's days are
 numbered and whoever controls power there will enjoy
 a decisive role in shaping the future of southern
 Africa.  As things now stand,, with ZANU as part of
 the ANC, Peking's influence is necessarily diluted.
 To make matters worse, ZANU's role within the ANC
 has been eroded to the benefit of ZAPU since the
 merger.  Moreover, the Chinese probably bel4.eve
 that opposition to South Africa is an emotional
 issue on which Peking can capitalize.  Lusaka's
 willingness to work with Vorster cuts in the wrong
 direction, from China's point of view.

 At this point, the Chinese are probably hoping
 that their outspokenness will deter the Zambians
 from further undercutting ZANU.  At best, Peking
 may look for a Zambian tilt in favor of ZANU as it
 jockeys for influence within the ANC.   Should the
 talks between Rhodesian Prime Minister Smith and
 the ANC break down completely,  this, at least, would
 leave ZANU in a better position to rebuild than its
 rival, ZAPU.   Thus far, however, Peking's criticism
 of Zambian policy has earned it little more than
 Kaunda's pique.
 Peking's problem is to determine how far it can
 push Lusaka without jeopardizing, in any major way,
 the relationship it has cultivated there over the
 years.   As yet there is no indication that Zambia
 is considering cutting back China's aid program in
 the country, but Kaunda is clearly unreceptive to
 Peking's criticism.   The Chinese undoubtedly are
 carefully monitoring Kaunda's reaction to their
 protestations and probably expect they can avoid
 irreparable damage to their relationship with Zambia.

 Despite the protocol ranking of young Wang
 Hung-wen as the third man in the leadership, it has
 become increasingly clear that the man who follows
 Mao and Chou in terms of actual power is Teng Hsiao-
 ping.                       Following a shaky start after his rehabilita-
 tion two years ago, Teng has amassed a number of
 important positions, all of which he seems to be
 using with authority and confidence.   In fact, he
 has come more than full circle since his ouster in
 1966 at the pinnacle of his power.  At that time,
 he was outranked by three men in relatively good
 health; today both Mao and Chou have some health
 problems, leaving Teng the man in charge of day-to-
 day affairs, with at least some authority to make
 decisions on his own.
 Teng has moved effectively in both foreign
 affairs--his recent visit to France where he was
 accorded head-of-state treatment being a prime
 example--and in domestic politics, where he has had
 a hand in quelling political disturbances in the
 provinces.   In the latter capacity, particularly
 in his reported personal intervention in the dis-
 turbances in Chekiang Province, Teng has bested
 Wang Hung-wen, who apparently was given initial
 responsibility for handling provincial disruptions.
 At least some degree of calm has reportedly
 been restored to -troubled Chekiang, and the credit
 appears to belong to Teng rather than to Wang.
 Local officials reportedly were critical of Wang's
 inability to resolve problems there last winter.
 Two reports indicate that Teng, in his capacity
 as army chief of staff, turned to the PLA to restore
 order.   According to one account, Teng transferred
 a division of troops from Peking to Chekiang;

 another report claims he moved the 20th army, which
 remained loyal to the former Chekiang party boss
 and was therefore a major source of the problem,
 out of the province and moved a neutral army in
 from a neighboring province.   In any case, Mao
 himself reportedly criticized Wang when he asked
 both men how to handle the Chekiang problem.  After
 hearing their answers, Mao reportedly told Wang to
 learn from Teng Hsiao-ping's approach.  Whether
 the story is true, it is another indication that
 local officials put more stock in Teng's abilities
 than in Wang's and that they believe this attitude
 is shared by the leadership in Peking.
 The Chekiang "competition" between Wang and
 Teng does not mean that young Wang is in political
 trouble.   It does indicate that he seems to need
 more seasoning before handling major problems, that
 Teng is the major problem-solver for now, and that
 he has won the confidence of national and local
 officials.
 Teng's powerful positions, and his apparently
 successful use of them, have evidently transformed
 the man himself.  His open display of affection
 for his youngest granddaughter upon his return to
 Peking from France--an uncharacteristic personal
 touch almost never shown by Chinese leaders--was a
 far cry from the diffident Teng who had to be led
 by the hand into the banquet hall in April 1973
 for his first public appearance since the Cultural
 Revolution.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/CONTROLLED

 Teng Establishes a Foothold in Europe
 Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's visit to France
 in mid-May, along with China's new association with
 the European Community, has given Peking a useful
 foothold in Europe from which it hopes to encourage
 anti-Soviet policies.
 Teng's visit appears to have resulted in con-
 siderably improved relations with France, virtually
 a return to a "special relationship."   Relations had
 languished in recent years following President Pompi-
 dou's trip to China in late 1973, which exposed dif-
 ferences over Chinese hostility to Moscow and over
 French views on European cohesion.
 The French received Teng warmly, giving him
 treatment that exceeded the requirements of protocol.
 President Giscard indicated that Teng's visit under-
 scored the "exceptional quality" of French-Chinese
 relations.  The Vice Premier responded that Chairman
 Mao himself is "greatly interested" in the development
 of relations.
 The two sides agreed. to hold periodic political
 consultations at the ministerial level, including
 regular sessions prior to UN General Assembly meetings
 and to increase trade and cultural exchanges.  They
 also decided to set up a mixed economic commission,
 and Teng quickly consented to French requests for a
 change in Air France's routes over China.  The French
 agreed to return visits to Peking by President Giscard,
 Prime Minister Chirac, and Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues.
 Spokesmen from both sides indicated that they
 found more in common than either had realized.   Both
 spoke out against. "super power hegemony" and for the
 independence and maintenance of the "personality" of

 nations. Chirac noted "with satisfaction" China's
 support for European construction and solidarity,
 saying Teng's visit was a "positive element" for
 Europe.   The two countries also agreed on the need
 for reorganization of energy and raw material mar-
 kets and for new relationships between industrialized
 and Third World states.
 The visit provided Peking a highly visible plat-
 form from which to affirm Chinese views on Europe,
 the Soviet threat, the international situation, and
 the post-Vietnam role of the US.   NCNA gave heavy
 coverage to favorable comment regarding the visit
 by leading French spokesmen and the European press.
 Moscow, apparently concerned that Peking might suc-
 cessfully rally anti-Soviet forces in Europe, is en-
 gaged in a strong propaganda attack against Chinese
 diplomacy in Europe.
 Peking clearly expects to use its foothold in
 Europe, particularly its periodic consultations with
 the French and its new accreditation with the EC in
 Brussels, for similar purposes in the future.
 Perhaps with this in mind, Teng placed a more
 moderate cast on some Chinese views that have not been
 well received by the Europeans in the past.   He played
 down the inevitability of war between the US and the
 USSR, claiming instead that "super power" rivalry over
 Europe would "one day" lead to war.   Teng also ex-
 pressed optimism, citing progress toward West European
 unity, which he said would stabilize the international
 situation.   Teng stressed that China required a rela-
 tively placid international environment to develop its
 own economy, now in its infancy, and that Peking would
 prefer a peaceful and stable world.
 Tend pulled no punches regarding the Soviets,
 and the -intensity of his anti-Soviet views reportedly
 antagonized some French officials.   He made it clear

 that, of the two "super powers," Moscow was by far
 the most threatening.   He emphasized Moscow's am-
 bitions in Europe, and told the French that Peking
 was not seriously concerned about Soviet attempts
 to encircle China.    Teng said that Soviet policy in
 Asia was aimed at undermining the US position
 there, but he also used formulations which indicated
 Peking remains vigilant regarding the Soviet threat
 to China.   He particularly attacked the European
 security conference, terming it a Soviet effort to
 dupe the Europeans; Peking is concerned that agree-
 ment on this issuE: could boost prospects for the
 long-standing Soviet proposal on collective security
 in Asia.
 In contrast, Teng appeared optimistic about
 Washington's role in world affairs.  He reasserted
 a view that has become more common in the wake of
 the Indochina war that the US had been overextended
 and now, freed from burdens in Indochina, could play
 a more active role in world affairs and concentrate
 on Europe and Japan.   While he called in public for
 increased unity arnong European states, in private he
 told the French that European security depended in
 large part on close European solidarity with the US.
 Teng's strong comments on this score were reminiscent
 of the very positive line the Chinese took toward
 Washington in 1972-73.   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DIS-

 Miki Trying To Break
 Sino-Japanese Treaty Stalemate
 Japanese Prime Minister Miki has come up with
 a new "four-point" policy in an attempt to break
 the current logjam in negotiations for a peace and
 friendship treaty with Peking, but his move appears
 unlikely to satisfy the Chinese.
 The main obstacle to agreement has been Peking's
 continuing insistence on a clause opposing "third-
 party hegemony  in Asia, an obvious slam at the USSR.
 The same phraseology was accepted by Prime Minister
 Tanaka in the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint communique
 announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations;
 it also appeared a few months earlier in the Sino-US
 "Shanghai communique."
 Tokyo has been. trying to avoid repeating the
 clause for fear of harming relations with the USSR.
 The Japanese have pressed for less specific language,
 to be included in the preamble rather than in the
 main body of the treaty, on the theory that its impact
 on the Russians could be diluted.
 Miki's four points--which have apparently been
 conveyed to the Chinese as a sign of his "sincerity"
 in the matter---are essentially a reaffirmation of the
 1972 communique and its relevance to the current nego-
 tiations.  Miki's formulation also rejects the idea of
 suspending negotiations, as many Japanese leaders have
 suggested.
 .The Prime Minister's move comes shortly after the
 conclusion of a visit to Peking by leaders of the
 Japan Socialist Party, who were pressured by the Chi-
 nese not only to endorse the hegemony language of the

 1972 communique but to condemn the super powers--
 the USSR and the US--by name.   The Socialists'  ca-
 pitulation, a tradeoff for Chinese statements sup-
 porting the Socialists' campaign to get US bases
 out of Japan, has complicated Tokyo's negotiating
 problem.
 Tokyo is in a dilemma. The treaty itself is
 not immediately critical, at least in Tokyo's view,
 to further progress in Sino-Japanese relations, which
 are cordial.   But Prime Minister Miki needs it in
 time for ratification during the current Diet session
 in order to improve his sagging domestic political
 position.   The treaty is only one of six major items,
 including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Miki
 failed to push through the Diet during its regular
 session, which expired on May 25,  forcing Miki to
 obtain a 40-day extension.
 Foreign Minister Miyazawa and many of his top
 aides are concerned that Peking will be able to take
 advantage of Miki's political problems to win total
 acceptance of China's position on the hegemony issue.
 They are urging caution, using the argument that
 party hawks--anti-Peking and right-wing elements--
 may be able to block any treaty containing strong anti-
 hegemony   language resulting in damage to Miki per-
 sonally.
 For their part, the Chinese in the past several
 weeks have been claiming that the treaty cannot be
 signed unless the anti-hegemony clause is included in
 the body of the treaty.   Not long before the Social-
 ist delegation's visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Chiao
 Kuan-hua had told Japanese officials that China was
 willing to wait "five to ten years" to conclude a
 treaty if this is what was necessary to have an anti-
 hegemony clause included.,  Other Chinese officials
 have also said privately that it would be better to
 have no treaty than one without this clause in the

 body of the document.  Moreover, Chinese leaders have
 begun to talk publicly about the treaty.  Liao Cheng-
 chih recently hinted that deletion of the clause would
 be a step backward from the 1972 Sino-Japanese com-
 munique, while Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien has specifi-
 cally rejected the idea of putting the hegemony clause
 in the treaty's preamble..
 This somewhat firmer bargaining posture stands in
 contrast with how the Chinese were, behaving in late
 February at the time of the preceding round of talks.
 a Chinese official
 predicted to a confidant tKat             ng would ultimately
 agree to the Japanese demand for the elimination of
 the hegemony clause.  He said that this would be
 preferable to having the negotiations become deadlocked
 and ratification postponed indefinitely.   In fact, in
 the late autumn and early winter in the first stages
 of the negotiations, Peking showed enormous cordiality
 toward the Japanese and seemed determined to have the
 treaty negotiated and signed as quickly as possible.
 In light of Peking's previous flexibility on the
 issue, the shift to a firmer line is probably, in
 part, a bargaining ploy to draw the Japanese closer
 to the Chinese position.  China has previously used
 similar tactics in negotiating with Tokyo.  At the
 outset of the civil aviation talks in 1973-74, China
 conveyed the impression that the issue would be easily
 resolved, but hardened its position as the talks pro-
 gressed.   A compromise agreement, favorable to the Chi-
 nese, was ultimately achieved.
 In fact, the Chinese still have an incentive to
 conclude a peace and friendship treaty before the Japa-
 nese Diet finally recesses around July 1.   Peking has
 always been concerned about the durability of Miki's
 China policy and the influence of pro-Taiwan elements
 within the Liberal Democrat Party.  A treaty, of
 course, would make it considerably more difficult for

 Miki or any successor to turn Sino-Japanese relations
 from their current course.   The Chinese also have
 considerable incentive to insist that "anti-hegemony"
 language appear in the treaty.   Peking sees this as
 an opportunity to drive a wedge between Japan and the
 Soviets, putting another obstacle in the path of
 Soviet-Japanese cooperation.
 The Soviet factor, in fact, probably has played
 a part in determining Peking's bargaining tactics in
 the negotiations.   The Soviet embassy in Tokyo has
 campaigned vigorously against the anti-hegemony clause,
 and this action has undoubtedly reinforced Chinese
 determination that the clause be retained.  While the
 conservative Japanese politicians who have been argu-
 ing against the anti-hegemony language are more in-
 terested in maintaining some distance from China than
 they are in relations with Moscow, their argument that
 the clause would jeopardize Japanese relations with
 the USSR is bound to raise Chinese hackles.
 Moreover, the Chinese have almost certainly ac-
 corded higher priority to inclusion of the clause as
 a result of recent developments in Indochina.   Peking
 seems genuinely to believe that the Soviet Union's
 position in Asia has been strengthened by Hanoi's vic-
 tory and therefore probably feels that the inclusion
 of the anti-hegemony language is imperative to prevent
 erosion of China's equities in the region.   In par-
 ticular, Peking apparently believes that Moscow will
 revive its long-dormant proposal for an Asian security
 pact in the wake of the new situation in Indochina,
 and it may see the clause as an initial means of ar-
 resting any Soviet move in this direction.
 In light of these considerations, Miki's latest
 initiative is not likely to cause the Chinese to back
 away significantly from their current position.   In
 fact, the Japanese foreign office fears, with some

 justification, that Peking may now feel that the cur-
 rent has again begun to flow in its direction.  This
 does not mean, however, that at least some compromise
 is out of the question.   There is probably some flex-
 ibility in the Chinese position, particularly on
 whether the anti-hegemony language appears in the body
 of the treaty or in the preamble.   Peking may well
 believe that a compromise permitting the Japanese to
 "save face" by relegating the clause to the preamble
 would mitigate some of Miki's present political prob-
 lems.; such a compromise would give China all of the
 advantages--albeit slightly diluted--of having the
 clause in the body of the treaty.
 Much is likely to depend on Chinese readings of
 the Japanese political situation, which was accurate
 last year when the aviation treaty was negotiated, but
 which may not be so acute in present circumstances.
 In any event, the Chinese are constrained by their
 underlying concerns and to some degree by their bar-
 gaining position.   In these circumstances, extensive
 watering down of the anti-hegemony language in a way
 that would obscure the essentially anti-Soviet nature
 of the clause--a ploy that the Japanese have con-
 sidered--is probably out of the question for the Chi-
 nese.   But if Peking is indeed willing to settle for
 treatment of the issue in the preamble to the treaty,
 there is at least an even chance of concluding the
 negotiations in time for introduction of the treaty
 into the Diet this summer.   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN
