 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "A"
 25X1 C
 USSR.                   Soviet Proposals to I ran on "New"_Trade Agreement and Other Questions.
 has reported that Toward            a en  of January, Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko
 and the Director of Middle East Affairs submitted Soviet proposals to the
 Iranian Ambassador to Moscow.  These proposals envisaged a new trade agree-
 ment between the USSR and Iran and the opening of new consulates in central
 and southern Iran on a "reciprocal basis."  GGromyko was also alleged to
 have made a number of other sweeping proposals which included Soviet oil
 rights and exploration concessions in Iran; Soviet reorganization and.
 training of the Iranian Army; and neutralization of Iranian foreign policy.,
 The Iranian Ambassador reportedly agreed that the trade agreement should
 be revised, but asserted that-that part of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian treaty
 which gives the USSR the right to intervene in Iran should be abolished be-
 cause it violated the basic principles of the United Nations.
 COMMENT:   Although it appears possible that Grorryko may
 have discussed some of these subjects with the Iranian Ambassador in Moscow,
 there is no evidence that any formal proposals were advanced by the USSR at
 this time or at any subsequent time.  Since the current Soviet--Iranian trade
 agreement was only signed on 4 Nov 50, it is improbable that any questions
 concerning a new trade agreement have been raised.  Such talks would be more
 likely to concern difficulties already encountered in the implementation of
 this agreement.  In view of the known Soviet attitude toward foreign consu-
 lates within the USSR, which inclines toward their total elimination, Gromyko
 would not have proposed the opening of consulates on a "reciprocal basis.01
 Other proposals seem consistent with Soviet objectives in Iran, but no
 Iranian Government could accept them and certainly the present pro-Western
 Premier Ala is not likely to do so.  Moreover, the USSR has much to gain
 from continuance of the current conditions in Iran, particularly in relation
 to the nationalization of Iranvs oil,  Any ill-timed Soviet demands for oil
 rights and other concessions might well cause these advantages to be for-
 feited.
 PRAVDA Comments on MacArthur Dismissal, Embassy Moscow feels that the
 Pravda 18 April editoria'l-on the MacArthur dismissal (1) reiterates the
 Soviet position on the Korean war; (2) was needed to explain the removal
 of an important "symbol of US aggressive policy" to the Communist world;
 (3) and is noteworthy in asking what steps the US intends to take for
 peaceful settlement of the conflict.   (C Emb Moscow 1834, 19 Apr 51).
 COMMENT:  Pravdaos editorial comment   which was given prominent treatment,
 adds no new twists to the established line consistently supporting the
 Chinese terms for settlement.  The week0s delay before Pravda published its
 comment was probably due to a desire to be sure that the dismissal repre-
 sented no basic change in US policy.                         The question of US intentions on
 peaceful settlement is rhetorical in context and, therefore, is not in-
 tended to indicate an interest on the part of the USSR in such a.settlement.

 eb   r  1-
 reports tha  according to the
 nese Ambassador in Moscow, Sino-Soviet relations are "not very good "  The
 NBn
 25X1 C
 reason given is that the USSR entangled China in the Korean war and has not
 given the aid promised.  At a February meeting with Malenkov in Harbin, Mao
 aired his complaints.  In reply, Malenkov explained that the entry of the
 USSR Into the Korean campaign would result in World War III, to the detriment
 of both China and the Soviet Union.  Therefore, Malenkov wanted to continue
 wearing down the West on various fronts.  Mao did not press his views and
 agreed'that Soviet aid at this time would be limited to continued supplies
 for China,                                       COMMENT: Other unconfirmed reports
 also claim that the Chinese Communists are dissatisfied with the extent of
 Soviet participation in the Korean war.  In view of the high casualty rate
 sustained (probably greater than the Chinese had calculated prior to their
 entrance in the Korean war), the superiority of UN equipment, and the signifi-
 cant role of the virtually unopposed UN air force, it is quite likely that
 the Chinese Communists feel that the USSR has failed to share the burden in
 this "Communist crusade."  A new Chinese Ambassador arrived in Moscow 15 Apr 51,
 and his predecessor is believed to have been absent from Moscow for some time
 prior to that date.  Since Mao's last confirmed, public appearance on 26 Jan 51,
 he has been rumored to be at various places. One report was that he left
 Peiping 29 Jan 51 for Manchuria and later conferred with Kim I1 Sung in Harbin.
 Except for the fact that Malenkov did not attend the Chinese reception in
 Moscow 14 Feb 51, there is no evidence concerning his whereabouts during the
 period covered by the above report.                 ,

 described in 0/C2 Daily Digest, 16 Apr 51).  An Albanian now in Yugoslavia
 has stated that "Provincial Committees" of a Yugoslav "Albanian Committee"
 are now being formed, suggesting that a Yugoslav version of the Committee for
 Free Albania may be organized.  One provincial committee is specifically located

 and a deputy in the National Assembly..(N FBIS, 20 Apr 51).  COMMENT.
 Sandor Zold, as Deputy Minister of the Interior, replaced Janos Kada as
 Minister on 23 June 1950 when the latter was relieved of his ministerial
 duties to concentrate on special Party problems,  Zold had been mated a
 member of the Politburo on 31 May 1950.
 POLAND.  American Scantic Line Barred.  The Polish Government in a note
 of 18 April has specifically barred the further "carrying on of activities
 of the American Scantic Line in Poland."  The note added that the Polish
 Government held the US Government responsible for the actions of the New
 York City authorities in barring the Polish-controlled Gdynia-American
 Line vessel Bator  from berthing facilities in New York Harbor and that as
 a result the Bator was being withdrawn from the Gdynia-New York run.
 (R Warsaw 822, 19 Apr 51 ).  COMMENT:  The Bator!', had not been prohibited
 from berthing in New York Harbor as alleged in the note, since piers were
 available for the vessel in Brooklyn, Hoboken, and Jersey City. On 16 April
 the US Consulate in Gdansk was informed that the 19 April schedule departure
 of the Batory for New York had been cancelled.  At that time no date for
 a future sailing was given.  The American Scantic Line has been the only
 regular US shipping service to Poland and had already contracted for forty-
 eight voyages during 1951,  According to the statement in January 1951 of
 a Polish Ministry of Shipping official, stoppage of American Scantic
 service to Poland would completely upset the Polish Six Year Plan for mari-
 time activities.  Moreover, American Scantic had apparently recently
 .reached a satisfactory settlement with the Polish Government concerning
 taxes it owed and the debts  of the Gdynia American Line to American
 Scantic Lines,
 non    YUGOSLAVIA,  Yugoslav Note to Bulgaria,   The Yugoslav Foreign Minister
 has addressed a note to the Bulgarian Government protesting 20 frontier
 incidents perpetrated by Bulgarian frontier guards between 19 December 1950
 and 5 April 1951.  The note accuses Bulgaria of endeavoring to aggravate
 the present situation and insists that the Bulgarian Government take
 measures to prevent such aggressive acts. (R Belgrade 1549, 20 Apr 51).
 COMMENT:  In the past two weeks Yugoslavia has made similar formal protests
 to Hungary and Rumania.  Since 16 March all of Yugoslav's neighbors
 (Albania,' Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania) have despatched notes to the
 Yugoslav Government accusing it of frontier violations.
 "B"         Yugoslav-Czechoslovak Relations at Low Ebb.  The Yugoslav Charge in
 Praha has reported to US Ambassador Briggs that he foresees the possibility
 that the Czechoslovak Government may declare him per ona non grata and
 then refuse an entrance visa to his successor,  The Yugoslav Charge does
 not believe that the timing of recent incidents in other satellites and
 the case of the Yugoslav radio operator Novak, who disappeared recently
 from'the Yugoslav Embassy in Praha, are coincidental. Ambassador Briggs
 comme.ts that while the Yugoslav radio operator's presence and conduct at
 the press conference arranged by Czechoslovak authorities, during which
 Novak maintained that he had voluntarily sought asylum in Czechoslovakia,

 raises some doubts as to whether his departure from the Yugoslav Embassy
 was involuntary, the Yugoslav Charge maintains that there is ample proof
 that the Yugoslav employee did not depart the Embassy voluntarily. The
 US Ambassador adds that there is no evidence yet regarding the manner
 in which the Czechoslovak Government plans to use the radio operator,
 but a public trial of recently arrested Czechoslovak Communists with
 Novak appearing as a state witness, is undoubtedly a possibility.
 (C Praha 637 and 638, 19 Apr 51).

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 "B"  SYRIA. The_Arm_yo_ s Continuin       ,Influence upon the Government. Colonel
 Shishakli, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army, at a press con-
 ference in Damascus, on 16 April, following his return from Cairo, stated
 that his purpose for going to Egypt was to discuss military cooperation
 but that he had taken the opportunity while in Egypt to "correct erroneous
 impressions" concerning Syrian politics and to deny that the Syrian Army
 had interfered in the Syrian Government.  Concerning Syria's foreign
 problems Shishakli indicated; (a) that the whole Arab world supports
 Syria's insistence that Israelis respect the truce agreements, and (b)
 that Syria may soon receive extensive military assistance from Egypt.
 According to US Ambassador Cannon, Shishakli's reference to new elections
 and to the Nationalist Party may indicate Shishakli's intention to use
 the Nationalist Party as a counterweight to Qudsi's Populist Party.  Cannon
 concludes that Shishakli's declarations on foreign and domestic issues
 leave little doubt that the Syrian Army actually rules Syria and that it
 intends to continue doing so.  (C Damascus 539, 17 Apr 51).  COMR4EN~:
 In spite of Colonel Shishakli's statements to the contrary, all indica-
 tions have pointed to the dominant influence exerted by the Army upon the
 Syrian Government.  Syria's political instability is not likely to be
 improved by the continuing interference of the Army in the Government's
 domestic and foreign affairs.  (See OCI Daily Digest, 27 Mar and 16 Apr 51).
 "A"   IRAN. Iranians Propose Nationalization of the Iranian-Soviet Fisheries.
 Prime Minister Ala has informed US Ambassador Grady that Parliament plans
 to nationalize the Caspian fisheries on expiration of the Soviet con-
 cession in September 1952.                         Several Parliamentary deputies are now
 drawing up a bill on this subject and will introduce it shortly in Parlia-
 ment.                (S Tehran 2474, 19 Apr 51).  COMMENT: The Caspian fisheries are
 owned jointly by the Iranian and Soviet Governments with each government
 having 50% of the shares.  The terms of the contract permit the Iranian
 government, if it does not wish to renew the contract at its expiration
 date, to dissolve the company and to divide the assets between the two
 share-holders.  Under such circumstances the Iranians must exploit
 the fisheries themselves for a period of 25 years without the assistance
 of non-Soviet foreign nationals.  The Iranian Government has long planned
 to do this.  While the move might be interpreted as an extension of the
 current fervor for nationalization of foreign concessions in Iran, it is
 not comparable to the move.to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
 (AIOC), which is envisaged as taking place immediately rather than when
 the AIOC contract expires in 1993.
 "B"    INDONESIA. Security Deterioration at Surabaya 4arbor, Extensive looting
 in the Surabaya harbor area on 17 April resulted in a suspension of all
 harbor facilities for a day and a half and government arrest of 400 persons,
 Although the harbor reopened on 19 April, shippers say they will close all

 facilities again at the first sign of trouble.  US Consul Surabaya
 comments that the situation highlights-the prospect of serious diffi-
 culties and complete paralysis of the port in "time of trouble."  The
 Consulate feels that the situation is steadily deteriorating.  (C
 Surabaya 96, 19 Apr 51).  COMMENT: Security in and around Surabaya has
 been poor for months.  Although East Java is under martial law, the
 Indonesian Army has only limited control over its troops in this area.
 "A"    PHILIPPINES.  Huk Timetable Revised. According to a Philippine Military
 Intelligence Service analyst, captured Huk documents reveal th vt the Huk
 timetable no longer contemplates overthrow of the Philippine Government
 by 1952.  The documents reportedly state that, until increased assistance
 and revised orders are received from the USSR and Communist China, top
 priority will be given to recruiting, propagandizing, and conduct of
 limited raids and ambushes'to keep the movement active and bolster
 sagging morale.  (S PHILCOM USAF C-1937, 20 Apr 51).  COMMENT: Huk
 propaganda has often referred to expected external assistance.  A revised
 Huk timetable would indicate Huk leaders are coordinating their plans more
 closely with international Communist objectives and do not wish to dis-
 credit the movement by adhering to an unrealistic timetable.
 "A"          Possible Submarine off East Luzon Coast.  The Philippine Army
 received a report on 17 April (which it evaluates B-3) that about 10 men
 and some material were landed on the east coast of Luzon in Quezon province.
 The Philippine Navy also reported on 19 April that a periscDpe was sighted
 in the same general area.  Military units are conducting a r econnaissance
 in force, but neither report has thus far been confirmed.  (S PHILCOM USAF
 C-1937, 20 Apr 51; C Manila 3283, 20 Apr 51)  COMMENT: See Daily Digest
 dated 13 April 1951, page 5, concerning a report that a Russian. submarine
 left Y'ulin, Hainan on 15 March 1951 with 10 Filipino agents enroute to the
 Philippines.
 "C"   AUSTRALIA. Election Campaign. The campaign for the 28 April election is
 in full swing with the outcome for Senate seats still highly speculative.
 The Government's chances to win a Senate majority are best in Queensland
 and Western Australia.  However, Labor has won. two Queensland by-elections
 during the past week.   The emphasis on issues remains unchanged except
 for increased Labor charges that the Liberal-Country Government is court-
 ing war by its policies.  Although party leaders are drawing good crowds,
 there is considerable public apathy.  The Communists are quiet on the
 industrial front as a contribution to Labor's campaign.  (R SANA Melbourne
 C-26, 20 Apr 51).  COMMENT: As previously reported, Labor is attacking the
 Liberal-Country Government for tolerating inflation while the Government
 is standing on its anti-Communist and defense program which it hopes to
 enact by gaining control of the Senate.

 "C"  CHINA. New Version of Rumored Death of MAO Tye-tun
 25X1C                                          MAO Tse-tung died in Peiping on 19 February.
 LIU Shao-ch'i (MAO's presumptive successor) did not choose to announce
 the death at the time, ""for fear of the consequences," but the announce-
 ment will be made "very soon."                                                       25X1A

 Daily Digest of .17 April. =comments that, despite the discrepancy in
 dates, these reports are believed to be of the same origin.  Reliable
 information on MAO's health is still not available.  If MAO is indeed
 dead, the Peiping regime will probably be compelled to announce the fact
 in the near future.

 "A"  KOREA.  ommunist Prisoners Taken Recently in Korea .Extracted He,?Tr Support
 for Coming Offensive. Both North Korean and Chinese Communist prisoners,
 taken since late February, have reported overhearing or being told that a
 great quantity of air, armor, and artillery support was being assembled in
 Manchuria to be sent into Korea to support the coming major offensive.
 Estimates varied from 4,000 aircraft and 3,000 tanks to a vague reference
 of a "large number of tanks, artillery and 400 aircraft" to be'received
 in time for the "May Offensive".  (S CINGFE-DA Telecon 4619, 19 Apr 51).
 COMMENT: The large number of reports received, not only from Korea but
 also from sources within China, concerning the expected scale of Soviet
 materiel support from Communist troops in Korea lends added credence to
 the. possibility that the coming offensive will be supported by more modern
 equipment that heretofore encountered.  The possibility continues to exist,
 however, that such reports were circulated deliberately by the Communist
 authorities for morale reasons alone.
 "C"          Muccio Comments on COF Morale in Korea. Ambassador Muccio report-
 ing on the morale of. Chinese Communist Forces (CCF) in Korea based. on POW
 interrogations, cautions that all his comments are derived exclusively from
 POW attitudes and may therefore not be representative since it is of signi-
 ficance that all UN forces in Korea have taken only 3100 Chinese POWs.
 Also influencing the results may be the fact that a majority of the POWs
 are ex-Nationalists, who are believed to represent 60% or more of the total
 CCF forces in Korea.  Dissatisfaction  ith the conditions of the CCF in
 Korea have been clearly indicated, based on heavy losses, serious hardships,
 and equipment shortages.  There is little evidence that the ordinary soldier
 has any convictions concerning the war.  The Chinese POWs interviewed claim
 that physical restraint and strict surveillance rather than Communist in-
 doctrination are the major factors preventing greater defections.  Judg-
 ing from this information, in the event of a major military defeat, result-
 ing in the breakdown of discipline and surveillance, an opportunity for
 mass desertions would be provided and a majority of the CCF would probably
 take advantage of it.  (S Pusan, 21 Apr 51).

 "C"  KOREA. North Koreans Act Against "Malicious Traitors Who Betrayed the
 Fatherland."   A 20 April North Korean broadcast described portions of an
 ordinance enacted "to punish the more malicious traitors who betrayed
 the fatherland and cooperated with the American imperialistic aggressors
 and their hounds."  The decree, signed by Kim Du Bong, Chairman of the
 Supreme Peoples Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
 provided for confiscation of all properties and death in a public exe-
 cution for "national traitors".  The decree further authorized that the
 "police shall - - - conduct the trial 24 hours after a written accus^+ion
 has been issued to the accused" and that "any appeal against the sen-
 tence - - - shall not be admitted." (R FBIS Ticker, 20 Apr 51).  COMMENT;
 The severity of this decree and the manner of carrying out trial suggests
 a serious internal security problem. within the North Korean "Republic".
 Although in practice the North Korean regime has never hesitated in dis-
 posing of the opposition by such means, prior public statements have
 usually emphasized the leniency and "democracy" of the North Korean judicial
 system.
 JAPAN. Japanese Apprehensive Lest UK Delav  Early Peace Try  , Conser-
 vative JIJI SHIMPO commented on 19 April that "if Britain suceeds in her
 soft but persistent efforts for giving Communist China a voice in the
 Japanese Peace, it will be a kind of over-all peace with Communist
 countries. and it is feared that we shall be dragged into endless negoti-
 atLons."  Since the US will not recognize Communist China as long as the
 Korean War lasts and will not agree to that nation's participation in the
 peace treaty, "if Britain insists on the participation of the Chinese
 Communists, it will hinder the early conclusion of a peace treaty."'
 (R FBIS 20 Apr 51).  COMMENT: This type of comment is rather typical of
 a rather widely expressed Japanese fear that the UK's influence in peace
 treaty terms and decisions will prove to be much greater with General
 MacArthur's dismissal.  The Japanese are suspicious of the UK's motives
 with regard not only to the inclusion of Communist China but also to
 economic restrictions that might be placed on the Japanese were the UK to
 have a free hand.

 SECTION  3 (WESTERN)
 "C"  GERMANY.  Favorable Reaction to Schuman Plan Signing.  Initial
 West German reaction to the    Apri .signing of   e Schuman Plan
 in Paris has followed the previous pattern. of favorable comment
 in press and political circles, exclusive of the Social Democrats
 (SPD).  Leaders of ChancellorAdenauer's Christian Democrats and
 their coalition partners, the Free Democrats, have praised the Plan,
 as.well as the diplomatic handling of the thorny Saar question.
 The press almost uniformly commends the signing.  (P Bonn 752,
 19 Apr 51).  Meanwhile Adenauer gave a press interview on the Plan
 on 20 April, outlining the significance of Germany's participation
 as an equal partner in the negotiations, and stressing the impor-
 tance of the Plan to the European people  (P Bonn 760, 20'Apr Si).
 COMMENT:  Now that the Schuman Plan has been signed, the Chancellor
 tempt to have it ratified as soon as possible.  US observers
 .WM predict its ratification'by the Bundestag despite vehement SPD
 opposition.  (OCI Daily, 10 Apr
 "C"            Soviet Soldiers Fire on US Vehicle.  A vehicle belonging
 to the US M   ary   aison in the-  ovie  zone of Germany was fired
 on. by Red Army soldiers on 18 April.  The car, travelling with 3
 passengers along the road between Torgau and Bad Liebenwerda (in
 Saxony-Anhalt, Soviet zone, 70 miles south of Berlin), had stopped
 momentarily near the Alt Lonnewitz airfield when 2 Red soldiers
 emerged from the woods and fired three times.  A bullet missed one
 observer by ten inches, hitting the car as it sped off.   (TS Frankfurt
 8)8I., 19 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  Numerous incidents have occurred since
 the end of the war involving trigger-happy Red Army soldiers or
 East German police personnel.  In the most recent incident, East
 Berlin policemen fired on a US Army sightseeing bus on 28 March
 (0CI Daily, 29 Mar 51).

 "C"   NETIMLANDS.. Dutch Close Canton Consulate.  The Dutch Consulate
 Genera   has closed down because   ere are no more Dutch commercial
 affairs to be taken care of in South China. The Consul General,
 who had been granted an exit permit by Chinese authorities, has now
 arrived in Hong Kong.  (R FI3IS, 20 Apr 51). COIAENT:  There is no
 indication that the closing of the Consulate i`'~s'cue to Chinese
 Communist pressure.  Dutch interests in the Far East have become
 of secondary importance as a result of the transfer of sovereignty
 to Indonesia.
 "B" ITALY.  Magnani-Cucchi Movement Handica ped'by Lack of Funds.  The
 wor erst movement Headed    Communist  a ec ors Magnani and Cucchi,
 although apparently gaining ground in some localities, is reportedly
 at a standstill in Rome.  In Turin, arrangements made for the two
 dissidents to, address a meeting were cancelled at the last minute
 because Magnani and Cucchi believed the program too ambitious and
 the hall too large.  Their refusal to appear in Turin is attributed
 mainly to their reluctance to face possible large-scale disturbances
 by local Communist Party (PCI) members.
 25X1A                   COMMENT:  Lack of funds is perhaps the most crying
 e  a e need of thie Magnani-Cucchi group.  Without adequate finan-
 cial support the movement will experience great difficulty in pub-
 licizing its program and in creating an organizational structure.
 Achievement of these two objectives is essential if the movement
 is to succeed in supplanting the PCI as the champion of the workers'
 interests.
 Communists Plan General Strike in War Production Plants*
 The Communis -controlled metal workers union has called a 24-hour
 general strike for 27 April as a protest against "the Government's
 intent to demobilize,a large portion of the national production
 structure and suppress democratic freedom" among the workers.
 Specifically, the strike assails the Government's delay in settling
 the long-standing dispute over dismissals in North Italian metal-
 lurgical plants.  Management has declared the layoffs necessary
 because of lack of sufficient orders.  (R Rome 4742, 19 Apr 51;
 R FBIS, 18 . Apr 51).  COMMENT:  There is das yet no indication whether
 the two anti-Communise or organizations will support this strike,
 which is clearly designed by the Communists to obstruct Italian
 rearmament.  Without the participation of these organizations, the
 strike will probably not be successful, despite the validity of the
 economic issues and widespread public sympathy for the workers'
 grievances.

 regently announced Budget in view of its generally moderate., non-
 partisan nature and the Liberal decision to support the Government
 on this issue.  An apparent Conservative decision to withhold seri-
 ous criticism at this time is interpreted by the Embassy to mean
 at least a temporary abandonment of Conservative parliamentary
 "blitz" tactics, and a reversion to the hope that the Labor Govern-
 ment will fall of its own weight.  In this connection., the recent
 Cabinet crisis over the Budget (Daily Digest, 12 Apr 51)  is con-
 sidered by Conservatives to be a hopeful omen.  (S London 5510,
 19 Apr 51).  COMMENT:  Conservative reconsideration of their
 parliamentary tactics springs in part from the mixed reception, in
 and out of Parliament, accorded their previous attempts at a British
 version of filibustering and in part from indications of increasing
 stresses.and strains within the Labor Party.  Ernest Bevinas death;,
 Sir Stafford Cripps' serious illness, and rumors of Aneurin-Bevants
 continuing dissatisfaction with the Budget have bolstered Conserva-
 tive hopes that Attlee may not be able to avoid an inmiinent, open
 split between the right and left wings of the Labor Party.
 "C"  BOLIVIA.  Junta May Take Over Governments  A group of Bolivian army

 which is said to include five officers and five civilians. 'Another

 COI& NT:.  Should it appear that the Nationalist, Revolutionary Move-
 men would poll more votes in the 6 May presidential elections than
 the government-sponsored candidate or that it would attempt a revolt
 prior to the elections, a military junta headed by Ballivian may
 well take. over the government.     The juntais purpose would be to re-
 store order and call for and supervise another election.  At the
 present time it seems unlikely that any of the six candidates., in-
 eluding those of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement and the
 government party, will receive the required absolute majority pf
 votes.  It would then be necessary for the winner to be selected
 by the Congress., in which case the government party, with its allied

 MCOMMENT:  The stability of the present administration
 is primar  y tiepen ent upon the support of the Guardia Nacional.
 In view of President Somoza's effective interns  security service
 and the probable loyalty of key units, it seems improbable that a
 military coup could be effectively planned or carried out against
 him at the present time.  Howeve', even loyal members of the Guardia
 are undoubtedly considering the possibility of a political reaalign-
 ment when, as seems likely, Somozale health forces him to leave the
 country or otherwise incapacitates. him for office.  This possibility,
 plus discontent within the ranks, popular opposition to Somoza's
 policies of political and economic favoritism, and the unpopularity
 of his son and deputy might well cause Guardia elements (and even
 key officers) to seek. alignment with hitherto powerless anti-Somoza
 liberal factions.  Such an alignment, once established, would
 threaten the stability of Somozats administration and might even
 precipitate action against him.

 "B"   IRAN.  Iranians Highly Critical of the An lo-Iranian Oil Corn  n
 US Ambassador Grady, in reviewing Anglo-Iranian Oil Company    AIOC)
 "past differences" with the US Embassy in Tehran, stated on 18 April.
 that "those differences were only with regard to the policies of the
 Company which have led them closer to disaster".  Grady reports that
 the attitude of the most conservative Iranian leaders is far more
 extreme than AIOC and the British Foreign Office realize.  (S, S/S
 Tehran, 2465, 18 Apr 51).  COI   TT:  Although the AIOC has on the
 whole been liberal in its policies toward its Iranian employees and
 has treated them fairly when judged by labor conditions as they exist
 in Iran, the Company is now regarded throughout the country as a mammoth
 exploiter of resources properly belonging to the Iranians.  In the pres-
 ent crisis the Company appears to think that time is an its side and. that
 financial pressure will eventually force the Iranian Government to accept
 the Company's terms.  However, any concession at this time short of accept-
 ance of the principle of nationalization will. not solve the present crisis.

 fic indications of a more conciliatory attitude in the UK9s agreement to,
 priority consideration of limited economic sanctions against mainland..
 China in the Alternative Measures Committee of the UN, and in informal
 statement by the Foreign Office that the British position on the question
 of Peiping Government representation in Japanese Peace Treaty deliberations

 suggestion for avoiding this conflict, (see OCI.Daily Digest, 31 Mar 51),
 the Foreign Office is now suggesting that the US be asked by the British
 to propose a compromise on the issue.  COMMENT:  (S$  /S London, 5527,
 20 Apr 51).     C0_ :     The fundamental "principles and realities" on which
 the British see theizr. present Far Eastern policy as based are (a) the gen-
 eral British policy of recognizing as the government of a country that
 regime which is actually in control, (b) a belief that refusal to do this
 in the case of the Peiping regime would be widely regarded in Asia as an
 attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of an Asian nation, and "(c)
 the belief that for important strategic considerations, UK policy must not
 be allowed to deviate too far from that of India.  Furthermore, the exi-
 gencies of the UK domestic political situation also militates against
 great changes, since the present government has already come under some
 criticism for allegedly truckling to US pressure.
