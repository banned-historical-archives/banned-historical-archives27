FOREWORD 
This study examines Chinese policy toward both the Soviet Union 
and the US in the critical period since 1968 when the current contours 
of the Sino-Soviet-US triangle began to emerge. It focuses on the 
complex and interrelated problems of how the domestic political 
struggle within China influenced the conduct of Chinese foreign 
policy and how changes in the international environment have shaped 
the course of Chinese domestic politics. While it is generally accepted 
that there is an intimate relationship between the domestic politics 
and foreign policy of modern nations, no study exists which system-
atically investigates this difficult problem with regard to Chinese 
politics and Chinese policy toward the two superpowers since 1968. 
Part I sets forth a series of general propositions and describes an 
experimental conceptual framework which is based largely on the 
"bureaucratic politics" approach to foreign policy analysis. Part II 
uses this framework to reconstruct the Sino-Soviet crisis of 1969, a 
major turning point in Sino-Soviet relations and in the transformation 
of Chinese policy toward the US. Part III focuses on the relationship 
between foreign policy issues and the fall of Lin Piao and his sup-
porters in 1971, another key event which cleared the way for further 
progress toward the normalization of Sino-US relations. Part IV dis-
cusses the prospects and implications for the US. The focus through-
out is on the basic forces at work within Chinese politics which have 
been influential during the period of leadership by Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung, and which are likely to continue to shape China's domestic 
and foreign policies in a post-Mao era. 
It should be noted that this study is experimental and its judgments 
are often highly interpretive and speculative. While it attempts to 
synthesize a considerable amount of material, some of it only recently 
available, the study is not intended to be a definitive history of the 
subject. Indeed, on the basis of the evidence now available no defini-
tive account is possible no matter what approach to the problem is 
taken. It is hoped that the study will stimulate thought and discussion 
of the issues involved among those concerned with the subject and 
lead to a re-examination (using this and other research approaches) 
of the critical areas of disagreement which emerge.

PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS 
From the time that an opening to the US was first seriously con-
sidered as a policy option in Peking in 1968, this question and the 
related question of the proper stance toward the Soviet Union, have 
been bitterly divisive issues within the Chinese leadership. Indeed, 
a protracted, disruptive, and ultimately violent realignment of domestic 
political power within China was necessary before what came to be 
called "Mao's revolutionary line in foreign policy" could be imple-
mented. 
During this process of realignment, there were two events which 
marked major turning points: the Sino-Soviet border crisis of 1969 
and the internal upheaval that led to the fall of Defense Minister Lin 
Piao and most of China's top central military leaders in September 
1971. During the first of these, Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier 
Chou En-lai resorted to provoking a serious crisis with the USSR 
primarily in order to influence the course of the struggle for power 
within China and the overall direction of China's foreign policy. 
During the second, Lin and his supporters attempted to seize power 
rather than accept the transformation of China's domestic and foreign 
policy that was underway in 1971. While the 1969 crisis did not im-
mediately halt the march toward increased influence and power of 
Lin and his supporters, it did slow it to some degree, as well as 
provide a powerful rationale for future steps to improve Sino-US 
relations. And while the fall of Lin Piao did not end the power and 
influence of the military in Chinese politics, it did diminish it enough 
both to clear the way for progress in Sino-US relations and to reorder 
China's priorities in the key areas of military expenditures and eco-
nomic modernization. 
A reconsideration of these events and of the course of subsequent 
Chinese policy suggests the following insights into the patterns of 
interaction between domestic politics and foreign policy in China. 
The intensity of the struggle within China's leadership over policy 
toward the Soviet Union and the US reflects the fact that foreign 
policy issues have become intimately bound up with a number of 
closely related domestic policy issues; these include the central problem

lureegn 
of the proper strategy for enhancing China's power and prestige and 
the closely linked problem of resource allocation. Even more basically, 
the contention over foreign policy mirrors a struggle for political domi-
nance within China. 
? Lin and elements within the military opposed the opening to 
the US precisely because of what it implied in terms of resource 
allocation and what that meant in terms of their influence and 
power. The increased sense of security that would grow out of 
improved relations with the US, they reasoned quite correctly, 
would lead to pressures for smaller military expenditures. 
? They also saw that improved Sino-US relations would lead to 
an expansion of the influence of their principal rival, Chou En-
lai's moderate coalition, a group that both favored this line in 
foreign policy and stressed economic modernization rather than 
military strength as the most effective means of enhancing China's 
status and power in the world. 
? Following Lin's fall, China's scarce resources were allocated 
away from defense expenditures and toward economic develop-
ment, and Chou and his allies in the moderate coalition accel-
erated their march toward the strong position they now hold 
in Chinese politics. 
Tension in Sino-Soviet relations is in large measure a function of 
the intensity of the internal power struggle within Peking. 
? The March 1969 crisis, the most serious in the history of Sino-
Soviet relations, was an outgrowth of the jockeying for power 
and related debates over foreign policy that preceded the Ninth 
Party Congress ( April 1969). 
? Immediately following Lin's abortive 1971 coup, the civilian 
leadership deliberately and systematically exaggerated the 
threat of war with the Soviet Union to create a crisis atmosphere 
conducive to party unity during a purge of pro-Lin military 
figures. 
? A similar escalation of expressed Chinese fears of a Soviet attack 
came in conjunction with China's Tenth Party Congress in 1973, 
when foreign policy issues re-emerged as a central element in 
the internal power struggle. 
? Overall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations has declined since 1969, 
because the extension of control by the moderate coalition has 
produced a somewhat more stable internal situation and because

the implementation of the moderates' foreign policy program 
has resulted in a lessened sense of international isolation and a 
decreased feeling of vulnerability to the Soviet threat. 
? Nevertheless, should there be a serious future challenge to the 
moderate policy coalition, its leaders would be inclined to use 
additional provocative acts against the Soviets or an anti-Soviet 
propaganda campaign in order to exaggerate the external threat 
for domestic political purposes. 
Just as the internal power struggle has affected China's external 
actions and policies, so changes in the external environment have had 
an important impact on the course of China's internal politics. 
? The escalation of the Vietnam war undercut a trend toward 
flexibility in China's foreign policy that had emerged in 1964 
and 1965, and thereby set the stage for the xenophobic foreign 
policy of the Cultural Revolution. 
? Numerous events in 1968?the first indications of a possible 
US disengagement from Indochina, the Soviet invasion of Czech-
oslovakia, and the election of a new administration in Wash-
ington?allowed moderates in China to argue that the inter-
national situation required steps toward decreasing tension with 
the US. 
? Chinese uncertainty about the direction of US policy in Indo-
china during 1970 and 1971 gave ammunition to the opponents 
of an opening to the US and at one point the entire thrust of 
this policy was called into question. 
? The Nixon-Brezhnev summit meeting of 1973 and certain con-
comitant Soviet moves led to an intense internal debate within 
China and renewed pressure on the moderates to alter China's 
policy toward the US. 
Future changes in the external environment in general and US 
policy in particular are likely to have an important impact not only on 
Chinese foreign policy but also on the course of politics within China. 
? Any rapid or significant progress in Soviet-US relations unless 
counterbalanced by offsetting US moves toward Peking would 
lead to renewed debate within China over the wisdom of the 
present course in fore)ign and domestic policy. 
? A US action such as the establishment of full diplomatic rela-
tions with Peking could paradoxically lead to a further lessening 
of Sino-Soviet tension since this would probably strengthen the

moderates' hold on power, decrease their need to play up the 
Soviet threat, and generally decrease Chinese frustrations re-
garding their nation's influence and recognition in the interna-
tional hierarchy. 
? At the same time, full normalization of Sino-US relations would 
probably strengthen the moderates enough to allow them to 
implement pragmatic policies which could considerably expand 
economic and other ties with the US and non-Communist coun-
tries generally. Expanded Chinese relations with the US would 
by themselves sustain a certain level of tension in Sino-Soviet 
relations, as would the continuing competition of the two Com-
munist powers for influence in Asia and elsewhere. To the degree 
that expanded ties with the US provided additional technology 
and greater resources which could be used to strengthen Chinese 
military capabilities, these developments could over time de-
crease the differences between the civilian moderates and some 
elements of the military, thus producing a more stable leader-
ship coalition in China with a vested interest in maintaining good 
relations with the US.

THE DISCUSSION 
I. INTRODUCTION: ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
AND METHODOLOGY 
OVERVIEW 
The opportunities and risks to the US in its 
dealings with the USSR and China are heavily 
conditioned by the quality of relations between 
the two Communist powers. Thus the prospects 
for war, conciliation, or continued tension between 
the two is one of the most critical issues facing 
US foreign policy. It is at the same time one of the 
most complex analytical problems facing the In-
telligence Community. The purpose of this intro-
duction is to elaborate a systematic conceptual 
framework for interpreting the relationship between 
Chinese politics and Chinese policy toward the 
USSR and ? the US. The major goal is to identify 
the basic patterns of Chinese politics, as they im-
pact on foreign policy, that would be likely to 
endure in a post-Mao, post-Chou era. 
At the core of this framework is the observation 
that while all Chinese leaders are acutely conscious 
of the need to enhance their nation's status and 
power in world affairs, there has been serious and 
protracted dissension over the optimum cluster of 
domestic, economic, defense, and foreign policies 
to pursue in order to do so. The basic assumption 
is that these clusters, or policy alternatives, are 
supported by Chinese leaders representing bureau-
cratically-based policy coalitions, and that the con-
tention for power and influence among these coali-
tions has shaped and is likely to continue to shape 
the course of Chinese politics and foreign policy. 
This framework and the subsequent analysis in 
this study reflect what has come to be called the 
"bureaucratic politics" approach to foreign policy 
analysis. It views the Chinese government not as 
a rational monolith which makes foreign policy 
decisions designed solely to optimize Chinese na-
tional interests, but rather as a number of com-
peting "players"; foreign policy is the political 
outcome of the interplay and infighting among 
these players, each of which tends to interpret the 
national interest in terms of its own factional 
interests. 
A. Status Sensitivity 
Partly because of rational balance-of-power cal-
culations and partly because of the sensitivity of 
leaders in Peking about China's status as a world 
power, fear of Soviet domination has long been the 
central issue of Chinese foreign policy and a key 
to the dynamics of Chinese politics generally. 
Chinese concern about an intolerable inconsistency 
between their own image of their proper role and 
their actual ability to influence world politics 
explains in good measure the decision to break 
the bonds of economic and military dependency 
on the USSR of the 1950s.* Indeed, the final break 
in Sino-Soviet relations came in the early 1960s 
when the Soviets refused to continue their aid to 
China in developing its own nuclear weapons, the

*There is obviously a wide gap between China's military 
and industrial achievements?relatively meager as compared 
with the USSR and the US?and the massive size of its 
territory and population. This disparity, and the historical, 
cultural, and ideological mind set which in the past made 
the Chinese think of themselves as the "central" or the 
"middle kingdom" of the world, account for China's ex-
treme sensitivity over its "status inconsistent" position in 
world affairs. The concept of status inconsistency was first 
developed by sociologists working in the field of social 
stratification to explain individual and group behavior 
within a society. According to the classic definition by 
Max Weber (Essays in Sociology, Oxford University Press, 
1948), status goes beyond objective measures of achievement 
and power into such subjective areas as acceptance by key 
groups within society. Further, if the individual's perceptions 
of his own achievement and status do not correspond to the 
status ascribed to him by society, he is in a "status in-
consistent" position. When situations occur which emphasize 
the gap, the individual's psychological stress can cause 
aggressive behavior. 
In recent years, a small body of theoretical literature 
in "international stratification" has carried the status in-
consistency theme into relations among nations. For example, 
Johan Galtung ("A Structural Theory of Aggression," 
Journal of Peace Research, 1984, pp. 95-119) interprets 
Germany's behavior before World War I in terms of the 
gap between its military and industrial capability and 
its perception of denied prestige as measured by the pos-
session of a large overseas empire. The most comprehensive 
book on the subject is Michael David Wallace, War and 
Rank Among Nations (1973).

of China's debt for economic aid, an act which 
infuriated the Chinese because it demeaned their 
status and flaunted before world opinion their 
dependence on the Soviet Union. 
Since then, most Chinese decisionmakers have 
remained acutely concerned about the need to 
reduce the power advantage held by the USSR, 
in order both to relieve the threat of Soviet pressure 
and to enhance China's authority as a world power. 
There has, however, been bitter contention among 
Chinese leaders over the optimum cluster of po-
litical, economic, defense, and foreign policies to 
pursue to achieve these ends. 
B. Policy Clusters and Coalitions 
For analytical purposes, three alternative policy 
clusters can be identified, and for each of these, 
a policy coalition, which seeks to promote the ele-
ments of the cluster not only to influence policy 
but also to contend for political power. These 
policy clusters and coalitions, though obviously 
simplified for analytical purposes, are nonetheless 
believed to be reasonably accurate in their repre-
sentation of the basic general tendencies in the 
complex Chinese political scene. Indeed, much of 
the course of Chinese politics since 1968 can be 
explained by reference to the struggle for power 
and influence among the coalitions.* 
*There is increasing recognition among specialists in 
Chinese affairs that a .new and systematic analytical frame-
work is needed. On this point Professors Michel Oksenberg 
and Steven Goldstein argue in the March-April 1975 issue 
of Problems of Communism that the study of Chinese poli-
tics is at a "crossroads," and that "the governing models 
of the past . . . have been tested and found wanting." In 
their article, "The Chinese Political Spectrum," Problems of 
Communism, March-April 1974, Oksenberg and Goldstein 
present a new analytical framework which focuses on 
"opinion clusters" in Chinese intellectual history as they 
relate to the questions of how China should respond to 
the West and the challenge of economic modernization. 
In contrast to Oksenberg-Goldstein, another new approach 
developed by Michael Pillsbury of the RAND Corporation 
focuses not on ideas or issues, but rather on the patterns 
of Chinese power struggles ("Patterns of Chinese Power 
Struggles: Three Models," a paper presented at the Uni-
versity Seminar on Modern China, Columbia University, 
1974). 
The framework presented in this paper draws on elements 
of both of these approaches, accepting the idea that 
"clusters" exist, but trying to link them to the dynamics 
of the internal power struggle, especially at the nexus 
where domestic politics and foreign policy interact. 
? Policy Cluster I, the radical alternative, is in-
ward looking and visionary. It seeks to enhance 
China's status and power by creating an ideo-
logically pure nation that would be self-reliant 
economically (i.e., revolutionary spirit would 
increase production and overcome all obstacles 
to development) and would gain influence 
on the world scene through example ( and 
through supporting revolutionary movements 
elsewhere). It is inclined toward isolationist 
views and is vehemently anti-Soviet and anti-
US. It has a strong bias against "experts" and 
believes in "politics in command." The primary 
bureaucratic base of support for this cluster 
is the "radical" wing of the Chinese Commu-
nist Party. 
? Policy Cluster II, the moderate alternative, is 
by contrast outward looking and relatively 
pragmatic. It seeks to enhance China's power 
and status through a combination of diplomacy 
and economic modernization. It is less con-
cerned with ideology and makes diplomatic 
calculations in terms of their consequences 
for the global balance of power, an approach 
which led it to favor an opening to the US 
as a counterweight to Soviet power. While 
it opposes reconciliation with the Soviets, it 
does so primarily for reasons of state-to-state 
rivalry rather than for ideological reasons. 
This cluster's modernization strategy relies 
heavily on the importation of Western tech-
nology, places a heavy emphasis on "experts" 
and reverses the radical slogan by putting 
eccnomics rather than politics in command. 
Because of its heavy emphasis on economic 
development, the moderate alternative favors 
the relatively inexpensive military strategy of 
relying on an "aroused populace" rather than 
heavy expenditures on military technology to 
meet the Soviet threat; it uses the added 
argument that improved relations with the 
US would further enhance China's national 
security, thus diminishing the need for heavy 
expenditures in the area of advanced weapons 
technology. The primary base of support for 
this cluster is in the civilian bureaucracies, 
especially those concerned with economic af-
fairs and foreign policy.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
The 1950s: The Rejected Alternative 
During most of the 1950s China followed the general policy of allying and 
i 
working with the Soviet Union to further the goal of advancing the nterests of the 
communist bloc against the forces of "imperialism" in general and the United 
States in particular. To enhance China's economic and military capabties, Peking 
relied on the importation of technology from the Soviet Union and accepted grants-
and long-term loans to finance their economic modernization. Nakao ' they. 
relied on the Soviet nuclear umbrella and the importation of ad Soviet , 
weaponry such as jet aircraft. 
1958-1961: The Radical Alternative 
In the late 1950s, the Chinese became increasingly dissatisfied with their 
status in the world communist movement, and increasingly restive to assert their 
own ideological leadership against the Soviets. They were also acutely conscious-, 
of their exclusion from the thermonuclear club of great powers,-and of their 
pace of economic development under Soviet tutelage. . : ? ..,, r-t: - 
The Chinese, therefore, embarked on a course of action which reflected many., 
of the elements of the radical alternative, I that is, Policy Cluster 1). By launching' 
the Great Leap Forward, a massive effort to further the industrial sb-ength of China 
by stirring up the revolutionary spirit of the masses, they aimecftevrant becoming 
economically "self-reliant" . kr, ? 
After two years of frenzied effort, the failure of the Great Leap was increasingly 
apparent Nevertheless, during this period the Chinese had rejected thecentralized 
Soviet model for the development of their economy and had laid theglioundwork 
for a complete-break with the Soviets in other areas. 
1962-1965: The Moderate Alternative Foreshadowed 
During this period the break with the Soviets became final, and element-a' o 
Policy Cluster II came to the fore though many of the tendencies of the radica 
alternative in the foreign policy area continued. The extremes..of the Great Lea 
were abandoned and a more pragmatic economic course was set which emphasized, 
realizable goals. Foreign trade was also increased, and in 1963 and 1964, the: 
Chinese went so far as to negotiate for the purchases of whole plants from Japan' 
and Western Europe. Concomitantly, steps were taken to establish cr improve 
relations with certain non-communist nations. 
1965-1968: The Radical Alternative 
. , 
Before the elements of the moderate alternative could become established 
the external setting was altered by the increases in international tension flea 
accompanied the escalation of the Vietnam war. China's early efforts to expand 
ties with Japan and Western_Europe ran into serious trouble, and the moderate 
who had favored this opening were discredited. Frustrated in this ea* ettemp 
to enhance China's status through increased international intercaurse,- and 
fearful that even if successful, the opening to the West would lead ta a decline 
in revolutionary elan, Mao ana the nadicab launched the Crcat e.tariar, 
Revolution, a movement which in its foreign policy dimension carried the Mdica 
alternative to the extreme of cutting off virtually all forms of traditional inteicours

? Policy Cluster III, the military alternative, is 
essentially non-ideological. Its general goal is 
to enhance China's position by increasing 
China's military capabilities, especially in the 
field of advanced weapons technology. It 
opposes the opening to the US not only because 
it doubts the US can be an effective counter-
balance against Moscow, but also because 
it fears that Soviet-US "collusion," especially 
in the area of strategic arms limitation, could 
pose a serious threat to China's national se-
curity. Its advocates, therefore, reject the basic 
premise of the moderates that improved rela-
tions with the US enhance China's national 
security, and deeply resent their tendency to 
sacrifice expenditures on military technology 
in order to rechannel them toward general 
economic development. Supporters of the mili-
tary alternative generally feel that it would 
be far more prudent to decrease tension with 
Moscow to some degree while continuing to 
make the development of a credible nuclear 
deterrent a first priority. This alternative is 
advocated primarily by elements in the mili-
tary establishment, especially the air force and 
other components heavily dependent upon 
advanced technology. 
The chart on page 7 summarizes the main 
points of the three status and power alternatives 
outlined above, indicates the bureaucratic base of 
support for each alternative, compares them with 
the rejected alternative of close ties with the Soviet 
Union, and shows how each alternative vicws rela-
tions with the US. It also provides an overview of 
the periods within recent Chinese history when 
each cluster has been partially dominant, dominant, 
or in contention for dominance.

mPapENTNI?19NRAIP 
the Chinese government not as a "unitary rational 
actor" that makes foreign policy decisions solely 
through objective calculation of the best way to 
optimize national interests, but rather as a num-
ber of competing "players" who contend for power 
and influence and use foreign policy as well 
as other issues during this struggle. Power is "frac-
tionated" rather than unitary, and any given action 
is the outcome of the interplay and infighting 
among the players rather than the result of a strictly 
rational and non-partisan assessment of national 
interests. Each player becomes involved in conten-
tion over precisely what "national interests" de-
mand, and each tends to define such interests in 
terms of his own individual political goals and 
the organization or faction he represents. Indeed, 
solutions to problems seldom follow from a de-
tached and cool assessment of the alternatives; 
deadlines, events, and crises force players to take 
stands and defend them. In Allison's terms, this 
describes the "bureaucratic politics" model of for: 
eign policy analysis.* The chart on page 9 com-
pares the two models and shows how the dif-
ferent approaches pose different questions, follow 
different patterns of inference and explanation, and 
thereby tend to result in different predictions about 
future actions. 
In terms of research techniques, there is in fact 
no basic difference between working with the clas-
sical unitary actor framework and the more com-
plicated bureaucratic politics model. In both ap-
proaches, the analyst uses the best evidence avail-
able and then attempts to reconstruct the views 
of the decisionmakers whose actions or policies he 
is trying to understand. The difference is that in 
one case the analyst assumes that all decision-
makers deliberate and act as one with solely the 
best interest of the state in mind, whereas in the 
other case he assumes that there exists a group 
of decisionmakers who are contending for power 
and influence and who often act against one an-
other to enhance their own personal position even 
*Readers familiar with Allison's approach will be aware 
that what is described above are his "Model I" and "Model 
III." While elements of Model II, the Organizational 
Process Model, are reflected in the analysis that follows, 
the primary emphasis is on showing how a variation on his 
Model III can be used to illuminate a set of complex intel-
ligence problems. 
in some cases at the expense of what others may 
strongly believe are the best interests of the state. 
In one case, the analyst imaginatively reconstructs 
"China's" best interests; whereas in the other case, 
he attempts to reconstruct the goals, aspirations, 
and tactics of each of the participants in the internal 
debate over what China's best interests are at any 
given point.* 
D. The Players 
The first requirement of the bureaucratic politics 
approach is to identify the key players in the po-
litical struggle and to specify which of the three 
policy alternatives outlined above each generally 
advocated. Before doing so, however, it is important 
to note that each policy cluster represents a gen-
eral tendency, or, as the nomenclature implies, a 
cluster of tendencies rather than a dogmatic or 
clearly defined program of action. No individual 
Chinese leader adheres without deviation to all 
the tenets of any specific cluster, and individuals 
who generally support one tendency may over 
time come to alter their views and swing toward 
another alternative. With this caveat in mind, we 
can say that the principal leader of the moderate 
coalition was Premier Chou En-lai, that the radicals 
were represented by Chiang Ching and Yao Wen-
yuan, both of whom had risen to prominence dur-
ing the Cultural Revolution, and that the military 
coalition was headed by Defense Minister Lin 
Piao.** 
*This process is what historian-philosopher R. G. Colling-
wood called the "historical imagination"; Stanley Hoffmann 
calls the same process "imaginative reconstruction," Thomas 
Schelling speaks of "vicarious problem solving," and Hans 
Morgenthau uses the term, "rational re-enactment." Col-
lingwood was addressing the fundamental epistemological 
question of how we know what we know about social and 
historical reality; Hoffmann, Schelling, and Morgenthau 
are addressing how we know and judge the behavior of 
national leaders involved in the foreign policy decision-
making process. 
**While Lin had worked closely with the radicals during 
the Cultural Revolution, his identification with their goals 
and policies appears in retrospect to have been largely 
opportunistic. A Chinese official interpreting this early 
period recently observed that Lin "had tagged along with 
the left wing in the late 1960s and had gone along with 
many of their policies," but that he was not in fact a 
"leader of the leftists."

During the course of contention for power and 
influence among these leaders, Chairman Mao Tse-
tung of course played the central?and usually 
the dominant?role. Mao probably made many 
decisions in relative isolation. Nonetheless, the co-
alition leaders regularly sought to influence the 
Chairman to gain his powerful support for +their 
initiatives. He, in turn, attempted to maintain his 
overall position of primacy in part by carefully 
assessing the relative strength of the contending 
coalitions and by playing off each group against the 
others. Nonetheless, in this process, he appears at 
times to have been forced?at the very least per-
suaded by concern about the constellation of forces 
raised against him?to reverse specific policies or 
positions he had previously taken. 
The degree of Mao's dominance has, of course, 
long been a contentious issue among analysts of Chi-
nese affairs. In terms of further developments, how-
ever, this question is likely to become increasingly 
less crucial given the growing evidence that Mao 
is now decreasing his active involvement in Chi-
nese politics. With this in mind, the goal of the 
framework presented here, as well as the case 
studies that follow, is not to resolve the complex 
issue of Mao's role, but rather to illuminate to the

II. TURNING POINT: THE 1969 CRISIS IN 
SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS 
OVERVIEW 
On 2 March 1969 an unusual incident occurred 
on the frozen Ussuri river near the desolate island 
which the Chinese call Chen-pao and the Soviets 
call Damansky. On numerous occasions since the 
early 1960s, there had been periodic non-shooting 
skirmishes in this and other areas along the disputed 
Sino-Soviet border. On 2 March 1969, for the first 
time, Chinese soldiers opened fire on a Soviet 
patrol, killing 7 Soviet soldiers and wounding 23. 
On 15 March, the Soviets retaliated with a full 
scale military engagement in the same area during 
which hundreds of troops on both sides were killed 
and injured. Following these conventional military 
exchanges, Soviet spokesmen hinted in a number of 
forums that a nuclear attack on China might be-
come necessary. By August 1969, the situation had 
deteriorated so badly that some Western observers 
were convinced that war was inevitable ,in the 
near term. 
Traditional explanations of this incident focus 
either on the territorial goals of China in initiating 
the crisis, or argue that Mao wanted to so embitter 
the Chinese people against the Soviets that they 
would never again be tempted to accept the Soviet 
"revisionist" road. The argument belotv presents 
an alternative explanation: it attempts to show that 
the origins of the crisis lie in the struggle within 
China for power and influence prior to the April 
Ninth Party Congress, and in changes in the ex-
ternal setting during 1968 which opened the way 
for a basic shift in Chinese foreign policy. 
For some years prior to the crisis, the radical 
coalition had been dominant in China. During 1968, 
however, a number of events, including the opening 
of the Paris peace talks and the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, gave the leaders of the moderate 
coalition the chance to argue for a shift in Chinese 
policy toward an opening to the US. In the fall 
of 1968, basic decisions were made to move in 
this direction by Mao and Chou, but these were

apparently reversed in mid-February 1969 because 
of opposition from the radicals and elements of the 
military. 
At least in part in order to regain the domestic 
political initiative, Mao and Chou decided to 
sharply increase tension with the Soviet Union by 
provoking a border clash?the critical 2 March 
incident at Chen-pao island. Despite continued op-
position by the military and the radicals, by the 
end of /969 the moderate coalition, with Mao's 
approval, had succeeded in using the Soviet threat 
to justify and implement the steps toward an open-
ing to the US which had been prevented in Feb-
ruary. 
A. Traditional Explanations 
While the possibility exists that the 2 March 
incident was an accident, the weight of the evidence 
suggests that, at a minimum, the Chinese ordered 
a change in operating procedures which led to the 
clash.* 
The question is, why was a decision made to 
embark on this high risk procedure at a time when 
the country was still very weak internally and 
isolated diplomatically? The most comprehensive 
*Prior to 1973, only the Soviets had given a detailed 
version of the events of 2 March. During the heightened 
tension in Sino-Soviet relations in 1973, however, the 
Chinese decided to get their own version into the record. 
They invited the pro-Chinese journalist Neville Maxwell 
to visit the border area in June, and had him briefed by 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) officer who was in 
charge of the patrol involved in the fighting. Even allow-
ing for the self-serving nature of the Chinese story, the 
account adds some important new details. The most im-
portant of these is the assertion that following some Feb-
ruary pushing incidents, a change in patrolling procedures 
was ordered which provided for a concealed Chinese armed 
patrol to parallel the regular one and come to its aid if 
the Soviets repeated their previous bullying tactics. This 
was done, and when shots were fired on 2 March 1969, 
the shadow patrol stepped out of its concealed position and 
opened fire. Whether or not one accepts the Chinese claim 
that the Soviets troops fired first, the fact remains that 
a change in procedures was ordered by the Chinese which 
made an armed clash far more probable, and that this must 
have been recognized by the Chinese authorities that ordered 
the change. For a full account, see Neville Maxwell, "The 
Chinese Account of the 1969 Fighting at Chen-pao," 
China Quarterly, October-December 1973, pp. 730-739. 
intelligence study of the subject offers the follow-
ing explanation: 
Mao's purpose was not to attain a victory for internal 
use or to blacken the Soviet image internationally, but 
rather to assert his claim to the island. In wiping out a 
Soviet border guard detachment, he gambled that the 
Russians would not escalate either by launching a big 
ground-force or conventional air attack or by attacking 
with nuclears. He apparently hoped that the Russians 
would not respond at all militarily because the Chinese 
claim to Chen-pao was so clearcut and had been 
implicitly conceded in the 1964 talks.* 
Another motive, according to this interpretation, 
was to warn the Soviet Union that China could not 
be pushed around. 
The only other detailed study of the 1969 clash, 
a RAND Memorandum by Thomas W. Robinson, 
offers a variety of other possible explanations. The 
one he appears to be most comfortable with "pre-
sumes that Mao was in full control of politics in 
China," and that the Chairman "hoped that perma-
nent national hatred for the Russians would follow 
a serious military clash," thus immunizing China 
against the virus of "Soviet revisionism." ** 
As to the first of these interpretations, the Chinese 
certainly had good historical claims to Chen-pao. 
But while this might account for why that par-
ticular location was chosen for the clash, it does 
not explain why China's leaders would want to 
concern themselves with relatively minor territorial 
issues at a time when they were preoccupied with 
the far more serious business of preparing for a 
party congress. Moreover, during the history of the 
border negotiations China's actual territorial claims 
have repeatedly appeared to be less important than 
the general goal of maintaining tension in Sino-
Soviet relations. Chen-pao, a desolate, scarcely in-
habitable swamp of an island totally lacking in 
military or economic value, would hardly seem 
worth asserting a territorial claim to at the risk of 
a Soviet retaliation of unpredictable magnitude. And

Chen-pao/Damansky Island 
if the Chinese wanted to warn the Soviets that they 
could not be pushed around, they certainly failed 
since the Soviet initiated clash of 15 March proved 
exactly the opposite. 
As to Robinson's argument, there is little doubt 
that the domestic impact of the incident was a 
major consideration in Mao's calculations. But this 
explanation fails to depict the context realistically. 
Why, for example, should Mao time such an action 
in 1969 when, in the aftermath of the Cultural 
Revolution, the spread of Soviet revisionism was no 
longer a pressing issue? 
In short, both explanations see Mao as making 
a critical decision in virtual isolation from the con-
straints of either domestic or international politics. 
In contrast, the present reconstruction of the crisis 
attempts to link it both to the ongoing domestic po-
litical struggle within China and to changes in the 
global setting which occurred in 1968 and 1969. 
B. The Internal Setting 
In the period that preceded the 1969 Sino-Soviet 
crisis, China had just begun to emerge from the 
throes of the Cultural Revolution. Both the party 
organizations and the governmental bureaucracy 
had been severely weakened by that domestic up-
heaval, and the military establishment had been 
brought in to fill the resultant power vacuum. As 
Minister of Defense, Lin Piao was in charge of the 
single most powerful bureaucracy in China, even 
if it was not fully under his control. After having 
pleased Chairman Mao by working closely with 
his wife Chiang Ching and other "radical" elements 
during the most violent phase of the Cultural Revo-
lution, Lin in 1968 and 1969 used the army to re-

establish order and dissolve the Red Guards, a 
decision that must have pleased moderate elements 
in the army and displeased radical elements in the 
party. The overall effect, however, was to greatly 
enhance the influence and power of Lin and the 
military coalition. 
While Premier Chou En-lai undoubtedly saw 
the restoration of order as a step in the right di-
rection, he and his moderate coalition were none-
theless clearly fighting an uphill battle against their 
opponents. In the jockeying for power that occurred 
in the year or so prior to the Ninth Party Congress 
in April 1969, Chou often took the offensive and 
was able to influence key decisions, but the outcome 
of the Congress shows that he and other moderates 
were in a precarious position and that Lin and his 
allies were expanding their influence and strength 
at the expense of the moderates and the radicals 
alike.* The new Politburo, writes A. Doak Barnett, 
emerged from "a chaotic situation of violent 
struggle" which saw a purge of party leaders 
"wholly unprecedented" in the history of Commu-
nist China.** 
C. Foreign Policy Differences 
In terms of foreign policy, there were major 
differences among the three key players who were 
seeking to influence Mao. In the first half of 1968, 
Mao, Chiang Ching, and Lin Piao were all in agree-
ment with the dominant tendency of the period, the 
radical alternative. Among the top elite Chou En-
lai was the only major dissenter from the radical 
cluster and the principal advocate of the moderate 
alternative. While he had reluctantly accommo-
dated himself to the isolationist tendencies of the 
Cultural Revolution period, he almost certainly 
was searching for some lever to alter the basic 
lines of Chinese policy. 
It was not the first time Chou had found him-
self trying to turn the direction of policy away 
from the extremes of xenophobic self-reliance. In 
fact, in the early 1960s, he had engineered an alter-
native both to the over-dependence on the Soviet 
Union of the 1950s and to the excessive self-reliance 
*For details, see p. 20, 24 below. 
**Uncertain Passage (Brookings, 1974), pp. 204-228. 
of the Great Leap Forward ( 1958-60 ). To a degree 
far greater than is generally recognized, Chou set 
a foreign policy course in 1963 and 1964 which 
foreshadowed the opening to the West of the 1970s. 
His policy?which was explicitly endorsed by 
Mao?was to compensate for the final break in 
Sino-Soviet relations by making an opening to "the 
second intermediate zone," that is, Western Europe 
and japan, and to follow this with the importation 
of Western technology for the modernization of 
China's economy. He accepted the need for China 
to develop its own nuclear force to face the Soviet 
military threat, but he realized that this would 
have to be supplemented by diplomacy and eco-
nomic modernization.* 
At the outset, Chou was remarkably successful. 
Relations were normalized with France, talks with 
West Germany were initiated, and there was prog-
ress toward normalizing relations with Japan. Chi-
nese negotiators opened talks with West German 
businessmen for the purchase of a steel rolling 
factory, and a deal was completed with the Japa-
nese for a vinylon plant. China exchanged journa-
lists with West Germany and Japan, and trade 
offices were exchanged between Peking and 
Tokyo.** 
By late 1964, however, Chou's opening to the 
West began to encounter increasing difficulties, 
primarily because of the increase in international 
tension generated by escalation of the Vietnam war. 
Sato came to power in Japan in late 1964, and, 
bowing to US pressure, vetoed the sale of a second 
vinylon plant to China. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk successfully implored the West Germans to 
cancel the sale of the steel rolling complex to "a 
country allied with North Vietnam." Negotiations 
*While Chou also loyally pursued the more "revolu-
tionary" aspects of Chinese policy during this period as is 
clear from his tour through Africa (1964), his subsequent 
actions suggest that he was less than enthusiastic about 
their utility.

for normalization of relations with the West Ger-
mans were broken off. Chou had come up against 
a stone wall. 
In these circumstances, Chou's opponents were 
given an opportunity to challenge his position, and 
Mao himself probably was disillusioned to a con-
siderable degree. Chou had tried to enhance China's 
strength and prestige by aligning China with the 
second intermediate zone against the Soviets and 
the US, and had failed. The moderate leaders who 
had advocated that position, including Chou, were 
weakened, and therefore in a shaky position to op-
pose Mao when he decided to launch the Cultural 
Revolution, which in its foreign policy dimension 
represented a return to "self-reliance" and xeno-
phobic attacks on both the Soviet Union and the 
US. 
D. Changes in the External Setting 
During 1968, a number of events occurred which 
gave Chou an opening to resurrect elements of his 
pre-Cultural Revolution program. For one thing, 
certain Soviet actions?especially the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces in August 
and the proclamation of the Brezhnev Doctrine 
justifying Soviet intervention in the internal affairs 
of other socialist countries?offered dramatic and 
concrete evidence of the seriousness of the Soviet 
threat to China. 
Just as important, several developments under-
scored a movement towards US-Soviet cooperation. 
The Chinese naturally enough interpreted this as 
"collusion" by the superpowers which raised the 
spectre of the Soviets being freed to apply pressure 
against China with greatly diminished concern for 
their Western flank. First, of course, the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty was signed by the US, 
the USSR, and other countries in late June. In early 
July, Moscow announced its willingness to open 
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the US. Fur-
ther, the Chinese saw the US protest against the 
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August as rela-
tively mild. Most galling of all, perhaps, the US 
and the USSR had "colluded" in arranging for the 
May peace talks in Paris between the US and North 
Vietnam. Chou probably interpreted this movement 
for possible settlement of the Southeast Asian con-
flict without a Chinese role as a direct and heavy 
cost of the self-imposed diplomatic isolation of the 
Cultural Revolution.* 
If the first two trends represented challenge?a 
third represented opportunity: signs that the US 
might be interested in improving relations with 
China. This was implicit in the fact that internal 
pressures were mounting for a US withdrawal from 
Vietnam, and that the US presidential campaign in 
process centered on the theme of ending the war. 
In this crisis atmosphere the 12th Plenum of the 
Eighth Party Congress met in Peking in late Octo-
ber 1968. The agenda addressed questions of when 
to hold the Ninth Party Congress and what policies 
and personnel changes to ratify there. While all 
outstanding differences could not have been re-
solved at the Plenum, there is little doubt that the 
major issues were discussed and that the jockeying 
for power and position that precedes a party con-
gress was begun in earnest.** 
The one major foreign policy decision that fol-
lowed the Plenum represented a triumph for Chou 
and the moderates, made possible in large measure 
by the above changes in the external setting. De-
spite Mao's sympathies for the radicals and their 
policy orientation, Chou apparently convinced Mao 
to make a bold shift in the direction of Chinese 
foreign policy. Basically, Chou must have argued 
that the best way to shore up China's shaky inter-
national situation vis-a-vis the Soviets and to slow 
the pace of Soviet-US collusion was to lay the 
groundwork for improved relations with the United 
States. 
Within days of the close of the Plenum on 31 
October, Chinese media began to take a less harsh 
line in commentary on the US. When President 
Johnson announced a bombing halt over North 
Vietnam on 3 November, his speech was published

can Relations and the Struggle for Power in the Kremlin,

Party Congress of the CPSU.

in full in People's Daily without the usual vi tuper-
tive attacks on Washington. The New China News 
Agency's ( NCNA ) comment on Richard Nixon's 
election was carefully worded and avoided the 
harsh personal denunciations that had characterized 
Peking's treatment of Johnson. More significantly, 
subsequent commentaries on Nixon's election 
argued that he had won precisely because of his 
pledges to reduce the US military presence in Asia. 
With this preparation, a Central Directive was 
issued on 24 November over Mao's signature 
which contained a long section explicitly stating 
that it was often necessary to enter into negotia-
tions with one's enemies. Two days later, a Chinese 
Foreign Ministry statement was published calling 
for revival of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in 
Warsaw on 20 February.* While the statement 
made clear that Washington should expect no 
major Chinese concessions during the scheduled 
talks, it was nonetheless apparent that Peking 
wanted to open a substantive dialogue, a remark-
able turnabout given the vehemence with which 
the Chinese had denounced North Vietnam for 
making essentially the same decision a few months 
earlier. In addition to his moves to alter China's 
US policy, Chou also began in October and No-
vember to rebuild China's ties with a number of 
other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe that 
had been the victims of "Red Guard Diplomacy." 
The basic lines of the moderate policy alternative 
with its heavy reliance on conventional diplomacy 
had begun to reemerge after years of suppression. 
E. A Radical Counteroffensive 
Chou's initiative almost immediately began to 
encounter opposition within China. As Chinese in-
fighting so often appears to do, this opposition 
took the form of articles which criticized current 
policy through analogy with similar situations in 
the past. In December, a series of articles violently 
*The first ambassadorial level talks between the US and 
the People's Republic of China were held in Geneva in 
1954, the primary topic being problems related to the 
Korean war. Over time a broad range of additional bi-
lateral issues were discussed. In 1958 the venue of these 
talks was shifted to Warsaw. During the 134th session in 
early 1968, the Chinese bitterly denounced the US and 
suspended the talks indefinitely. 
Radical Leader Yao Wen-yuan 
denounced the foreign policies of Liu Shao-chi, the 
former Chief of State who had been purged during 
the Cultural Revolution for his "bourgeois" policies. 
The opening shot came on 2 December in an article 
in the radical Shanghai paper Wen Hui Pao, which 
pointedly attacked Liu for betraying China's in-
terests to the US during his visit to Indonesia in 
1963. Significantly, the article attacked those who 
opposed any new condemnation of Liu's foreign 
policies. 
Other articles, usually on subjects in the "cultural" 
sphere which Chiang Ching, Yao Wen-yuan and 
the radicals controlled, accused Liu of "capitulating" 
to the US and not fully exposing its "criminal acts." 
In a reference which had obvious immediate impact, 
one article stated that Liu's unwillingness to attack 
US policy had "amazed and startled even the 
bourgeois newspapers and periodicals of the West." 
Since Chou's muting of China's criticism of the US 
had generated considerable speculation in US 
papers over China's apparent policy shift, the 
article's target was obvious.

Approved For Release 2001/09/03 : CIA-RDP84600506R000100070009-9 
A theme of many of the articles was that Liu 
had incorrectly favored use of peacful negotiations 
in dealing with the US rather than following the 
correct line of using armed force against the US 
and its ally, Nationalist China. "Taught by our great 
leader Chairman Mao," one article concluded, "the 
Chinese people were clear headed and refused to 
believe the nice words of the US imperialists ... 
an especially ironic statement since Mao had just 
directed that the Chinese people get used to the 
idea of negotiations with the "enemy," i.e., the US. 
Clearly, both Chou and the new policy line en-
dorsed by Mao were under heavy attack from the 
radicals who opposed any change in the foreign 
policy of the Cultural Revolution and therefore any 
softening of China's stance toward the US. 
F. Lin Piao and the Military 
While abundant evidence exists that Lin had 
become an opponent of the opening to the US 
by 1971, the problem remains of pinpointing when 
and why this foreign policy issue became inter-
twined with the power struggle between Lin and 
Mao, which can be dated at least back to 1969. 
It seems highly unlikely that any Chinese leader 
charged with dealing with national security issues 
could have ignored the dramatic and threatening 
events of the spring and summer of 1968, and un-
questioningly reaffirmed his allegiance to the sterile 
radical alternative. However, Lin could have at-
tempted to counter Chou's initiative by insisting 
on an offsetting step toward the Soviet Union. 
Indeed, it is precisely this "error" that Lin and 
his fellow military conspirators were to be charged 
with following their fall from power. 
Certainly, many Chinese military leaders had 
long harbored a strong distrust of the US and 
Japan, as well as historical memories of the PLA's 
cooperation with the Soviet army, and it would 
not be surprising to find many of them gravely up-
set over a policy which advocated diminishing ten-
sion with the US while continuing to maintain 
a high level of tension with the USSR. Moreover, 
a plausible case could be made for reducing the 
immediate threat of a Soviet attack by some re-
conciliatory gesture toward Moscow, and then re-
allocating China's resources toward building the 
kind of advanced weapon's capability that would 
be a credible deterrent to Soviet aggression.* 
In addition to the internal logic of this recon-
struction of the military view in 1968-69, there is 
evidence as 
well as in the media and open statements of the 
time that suggests that Lin was indeed at odds 
with Mao and Chou over foreign policy issues dur-
in this early neriod. 
a major con-
frontation occurred prior to the Ninth Party Con-
gress concerning the drafting of the foreign policy 
section of the scheduled Political Report.** Lin,M 
insisted on char- 25X1X4 
acterizing the international situation as an "era 
in which imperialism is heading for total collapse 
and socialism is advancing to worldwide victory." 
contrasts this line with 25X1X4 
Mao's view that while the US was a paper tiger, 
it was at the same time a real tiger, a "tiger of 
iron," and that far from advancing toward world-
wide victory, socialism faced many serious problems, 
including "fragmentation." The dispute is said to 
have become so heated that Lin finally had his way 
only by threatening not to read the Political Report 
to Congress. 
While couched in ideological terms, the implica-
tions of this dispute are clear if it is placed in the 
context of an ongoing debate over whether to begin 
an opening to the US or to improve relations with 
the Soviet Union. The conclusions to be drawn from 
Lin's line were that the US would be useless as a 
counter to the Soviet threat since it was heading 
toward collapse, and that the USSR would be a far 
more appropriate country to deal with since "world 
socialism" was advancing steadily toward victory. 
Mao's line, however, saw the US as an "iron tiger" 
that could be brought into play as a balance against 
the Soviet Union in a fragmented socialist world. 
Lin's "error" was corrected at the Tenth Party Con-
gress, when, in reading the Political Report, Chou 
did not repeat Lin's formulation but rather stated

that "we are still in the era of imperialism and pro-
letarian revolution."* 
2 5X 1 X4 Other indications of a split over foreign policy 
at this time are less convincing 
but nonetheless deserve consideration. 
First of all, the re-publication on 26 November 1968 
of Mao's 1949 speech which justified negotiations 
with one's enemies could just as easily be applied to 
negotiations with Moscow as with Washington. And 
while the speech was edited prior to publication 
to exclude many historical anomalies, upon publica-
tion it still -retained the phase, "the world anti-im-
perialist front headed by the Soviet Union," a re-
markable editorial oversight given the state of Sino-
Soviet relations in November 1968. Commenting on 
the extensive justification of China's anti-Soviet 
policy in the major report at the Ninth Party Con-
gress, Thomas Robinson observes "it is possible that 
the entire Maoist anti-Soviet policy was under at-
tack during, and presumably before, the Con-
gress." ** 
Lin also had very good reasons for opposing the 
opening of talks with the US quite apart from the 
specific foreign policy implications of the move. 
Strictly in terms of the rivalry with Chou and his 
allies in the civilian bureaucracies, Lin would not 
25X1X4 
25X1X6 
**Robinson, op. cit., page 53. 
have wanted Chou to garner credit for an important 
initiative, especially at a time when critical per-
sonned decisions were being made regarding the 
composition of the Politburo to be chosen by the 
Ninth Party Congress. In the "violent struggle" that 
Doak Barnett describes as preceding the Congress, 
rivalries and differences over a host of matters 
would have motivated Lin to try to discredit and, if 
possible, reverse any policy associated with Chou, 
his most influential rival. Thus, both the military 
coalition and the radicals, each for their own 
reasons, were probably in a tacit if not overt al-
liance aimed at reversing the first tentative step 
toward the opening to the US. 
G. Cancellation of the Warsaw Talks 
Despite opposition from the radicals as well as 
Lin and the military coalition, Chou persisted in 
the course he had set with Mao's approval. As late 
as two days prior to the scheduled talks with the 
US, preparations were proceeding on schedule in 
Warsaw. Then, as abruptly as Chinese policy had 
shifted toward the opening to the US, Peking an-
nounced on 18 February 1969 that the talks would 
not be held. Soon thereafter, the restraint that had 
generally characterized Chinese media treatment 
of the US since November gave way to the virulent 
and abusive propaganda style of the Cultural Revo-
lution. 
The circumstances of this turn away from an 
emergent new Chinese policy suggests that both 
Mao and Chou may have been overruled by a coali-
tion of the radicals and the elements in the military 
responsive to Lin Piao. Alternatively, Mao and 
Chou may have reasoned that given the strong op-
position of the radicals and the military, a tempo-
rary retreat was in order. In any case, this dramatic 
reversal almost certainly reflected the growing 
strength of the Lin forces.* 
At the same time Washington raised an issue 
which hurt the moderates' case. In his press con-
ference of 8 February, President Nixon not only 
reiterated US interest in SALT negotiations with 
the Soviets, he also justified his ABM program by 
saying it was directed against the "Chinese nuclear

threat." That the President had touched a raw 
nerve of China's status sensitivity was apparent 
from the fact that NCNA did not even mention 
Nixon's remarks on the ABM system and the Chi-
nese nuclear threat in its story on the press con-
ference. While this incident should not be exag-
gerated, it does appear that the press conference 
gave opponents of Chou and Mao additional am-
munition in their campaign against the opening 
to the US. Certainly the ostensible reason given 
by the Chinese for cancelling the talks?the defec-
tion of a Chinese attache in Europe in early Feb-
ruary?is not a sufficient explanation for the turn 
around.* 
H. Bureaucratic Politics and the 2 March 
Clash 
That Mao and Chou had been reversed on an 
initiative in which they had invested considerable 
prestige is only one of a number of indications that 
they may have been politically on the defensive 
,at this time. 
25X1X4 
25X1X4 
the many delays in 
convening the Ninth Party Congress were a direct 
result of Mao's calculation that he could not count 
on the support of the military at the meeting. More-
25X 1X4 over, the 
strength Lin Piao and his supporters ultimately 
achieved in the most vivid terms, and Lin was 
obviously making major strides toward this position 
of strength in early 1969. Mao himself, for example, 
has recently stated that "Lin Piao almost succeeded 
in taking over the whole party," and Vice Premier 
Teng Hsiao-ping has gone so far as to say that 
"the Lin Piao anti-party clique was able to expand 
its influence and gradually gain control of the 
Party."

If all 
this is coupled with the obvious advances made by 
Lin at the Party Congress at the expense of moder-
ates and radicals, then one can make a case that 
both Mao and Chou were in a precarious, perhaps 
even desperate, political position in early 1969. 
*On this point Sutter, op. cit., presents a convincing case 
against the importance of the defection.

It was in these circumstances, just 12 days after 
the planned Warsaw talks were cancelled and some 
30 days before the opening of the Ninth Party 
Congress, that Chinese troops attacked Soviet 
soldiers near Chen-pao and touched off the most 
serious crisis in the history of relations between 
Communist China and the USSR. Since the Chinese 
Politburo was already debating the wisdom of a 
major shift in its foreign policy stance, this debate 
almost certainly influenced any decision regarding 
an attack on the Soviet Union. Those segments of 
the military that followed Lin Piao's lead probably 
were concerned about the initial steps taken toward 
the US and desirous of a more evenhanded policy 
which included an attempt at reconciliation with 
the USSR. It would thus seem highly improbable 
that most military men would have favored a delib-
erate provocation against the Soviets, especially at 
a time when military forces were still being used to 
restore internal order. 
On the other hand, a clash with the Soviets 
would serve the interests of Mao and Chou in a 
number of areas. Most importantly, it would be a 
strong reassertion of Mao's personal authority fol-
lowing the 18 February setback and the general 
trend toward greater power for Lin and the military. 
Secondly, it would make it far more difficult for 
the military coalition to sustain a case that Sino-
Soviet relations should be improved. Thirdly, the 
resultant increase in Sino-Soviet tension would pro-
vide dramatic justification for an opening to the 
US. And finally, it would serve the purpose of im-
peding the trend toward Soviet-US "collusion" by 
demonstrating the aggressive military nature of 
Soviet behavior. In short, it would serve both the 
foreign policy and domestic political purposes of 
these key Chinese decisionmakers. 
This line of explanation, however, raises very 
difficult questions: if Lin and his supporters on the 
Politburo had been strong enough to reverse Mao 
and Chou on the question of the Warsaw talks, 
why would they not have had enough clout to 
prevent an action which was not in the best 
interests of the policy line they advocated? More-
over, since Lin was in charge of the defense bu-
reaucracy, how could a decision requiring a military 
action be taken without his approval? 
While it is possible that Mao and Chou con-
fronted Lin directly on this decision and simply

ordered him to take steps to implement it, it seems 
more likely that, given their weak political position, 
they pursued their goals in a less direct manner 
by circumventing the normal chain of command 
and ordering Chen Hsi-lien, commander of the 
Shenyang Military Region, either to attack the 
Soviets or to alter patrolling procedures and get 
tough with the Soviets, thereby increasing sub-
stantially the chances of a clash. 
But why would Chen Hsi-lien agree to a request 
from Mao or Chou which in effect would involve 
him directly in the internal power struggle in Pe-
king? First of all, Chen's own personal ambitions 
were well served by an increase in tension on the 
Sino-Soviet border. There is a direct relationship 
between the relative military power exercised by 
China's regional military leaders and the potential 
influence they wield. As commander of the largest 
of China's military regions, except for Peking, Chen 
wielded considerable influence, but his position 
had been weakened by early 1969 because the re-
Chen Hsi-lien 
quirements of the Cultural Revolution had led to 
the transfer of two of Shenyang's eight armies 
to more heavily populated areas in China. The 1969 
border crisis, however, led to the redeployment of 
these armies back to Chen's command and this, 
along with his role in the crisis, probably influenced 
his elevation to the Politburo at the Ninth Party 
Congress. Moreover, his subsequent career sug-
gests that he has enjoyed the added trust and 
appreciation of Mao and Chou ever since the 1969 
crisis. At a crucial juncture in 1974 when Mao and 
Chou's policies were again under fire, Chen was 
made commander of the critical Peking Military 
Region, and, in early 1975 Chen was elevated to 
the rank of Vice Premier at the National People's 
Congress which was dominated by the moderates.* 
Thus, given the kind of political infighting that was 
under way in 1968 and 1969, it is plausible that 
Chen would have obeyed a direct order from Mao 
without consulting Lin Piao. 
Other aspects of the events surrounding the 2 
March incident support the view that the attack 
was not carefully planned by China's defense estab-
lishment, but, instead, was arranged on short notice, 
and executed without the knowledge of higher mili-
tary authorities in the normal chain of command. 
Chen-Pao, for example, was an unusual site for a 
thoughtful military planner to select for a clash with 
the Soviets since no sizeable Chinese military in-
stallations or airfields existed nearby, and Soviet 
forces were highly concentrated in the area. In 
addition, no major preparations were made prior 
to the attack, and there were indications that Chi-
nese military authorities in Peking were at least 
as surprised that the clash had occurred as were 
Soviet authorities. 
This interpretation of the 2 March clash, in short, 
has Mao and Chou acting hastily and for highly 
political purposes rather than deliberately and 
solely with concern for what China's national in-
terests required. That they were prepared to risk 
the death of hundreds of Chinese soldiers and con-
ceivably even war with the Soviet Union is thus 
a measure not only of how high they calculated

the stakes in the internal power struggle, but also 
of how badly they wanted to discredit those within 
China who opposed the opening to the US. Cer-
tainly the message that Mao could count on the 
loyalty of China's second most powerful military 
regional commander would not be lost on Lin in 
the continuing power struggle. 
I. Internal Politics and the Soviet Question 
It is important to note that Soviet leaders were 
closely following events in China and that their 
interpretation of Chinese politics and foreign policy 
at this time was similar to the one presented above. 
Soviet diplomats in Peking observed at the time 
that the Congress had further isolated Chou and 
the "technocrats," and expressed the view that Chou 
had emerged from the Congress with a "diminution 
of real power." Brezhnev told East European lead-
ers in the spring of 1969 that Moscow was in con-
tact with a group of leaders in China friendly to 
the USSR and that this group was becoming 
stronger, and a number of articles in the Soviet 
press at this time referred to opposition to Mao 
among military leaders.* More ominously, one So-
viet official stated in April that Moscow was closely 
watching the development of "centrifugal tenden-
cies in China," including provincial leaders who 
often found themselves at odds with the center. If 
the situation in China disintegrated further, he 
said, and "local elements" requested help from the 
USSR in its struggle with the "Maoist leadership," 
the Soviets might respond positively. Finally, Mos-
cow ordered a substantial reduction in all propa-
ganda attacks against Peking once the Ninth Party 
Congress opened, another indication that some So-
viet leaders may have believed that a less hostile 
leadership might emerge from the internal struggle 
going on within China.** 
Given this perspective, it is not surprising that 
the Soviets tended to relate the 2 March clash to 
Chinese domestic politics. Soon after the incident, 
Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin told American of-
ficials in Washington that the border clash was 
instigated with an eye toward the opening of the 
Ninth Party Congress. The 21 March issue of New 
*State, INR, Intelligence Note, "Has Moscow a Friend in 
Court in Peking?" 17 July 1969, SECRET/NFD. 
**By contrast, Moscow intensified their anti-Chinese 
propaganda during the Tenth Party Congress in 1973. 
SC 03846175 
Times, stated flatly that the clash was an outgrowth 
of the "power struggle" within China. Though 
neither Dobrynin nor the New Times article offered 
any supporting detail, their interpretations at least 
raise the possibility that Moscow's views on the 
internal Chinese political situation were being 
shaped by information supplied by highly placed 
sources within the Chinese leadership.* 
J. Aftermath 
In the immediate aftermath of the 2 March inci-
dent, many observers dismissed the clash as of 
little significance, yet another border skirmish 
which would quickly blow over. The Soviets also 
appeared initially to have wanted to avoid a major 
propaganda exchange. A border clash without some 
follow-up, however, would have served neither 
the domestic nor foreign policy goals of Mao and 
Chou. Indeed, it is interesting to note that if the 
goals had been focused primarily on territorial 
issues, then subsequent Soviet probes aimed at 
reopening the border talks would probably have 
been accepted more quickly. But instead of limiting 
themselves to sending a diplomatic protest note to 
Moscow, Mao and Chou implemented a massive 
anti-Soviet campaign. 
Nationwide demonstrations began on the day 
after the clash. By 7 March some 260 million Chi-
nese had participated in mass rallies denouncing 
Soviet revisionism and vowing vigilance along the 
border. In addition, angry demonstrations were 
staged outside the Soviet Embassy from 3 through 
6 March and then resumed on 11 March, a tactic 
which drew a parallel response in Moscow on 11 
March. Following the Soviet counterattack on 15 
March, the anti-Soviet demonstrations resumed, 
and Chinese propaganda continued to attack Mos-
cow shrilly. The message to the domestic rivals of 
Mao and Chou was unmistakable: anti-Soviet senti-
ment was strong among the Chinese people and 
anyone favoring lessened tension with Moscow was 
treading on very unpopular ground. 
During the Ninth Party Congress, which opened 
on 1 April, Mao and Chou continued to exploit the

crisis with the Soviets, even going so far as to 
have one of the officers involved in the border 
clash appear before the assembled delegates. The 
key document presented at the Congress was the 
Political Report, and in the drafting and redrafting 
that preceded the formal presentation, Mao and 
Chou almost certainly used the implications of the 
crisis in their dispute with Lin over the foreign 
policy line to be taken.* In this they were partially 
successful. The report formalized the view that the 
Soviet Union was as serious an enemy of China 
as the US, though, possibly in deference to Lin's 
demands, Moscow was not yet named China's 
principal enemy. Moreover, the denunciations of 
the US were relatively routine; the Vietnam war, 
a key cause of continued Sino-US tension, was not 
even mentioned. 
Other sections of the report, however, reflect 
Lin's influence. In addition to insisting on language 
which left the door open for improved relations 
with the USSR, the leader of "world socialism," * 
the report asserted that Peking's foreign policy was 
?`consistent" and that it was "not based on expedi-
ency," a probable slap at the moderates who wanted 
to take the expedient route of dealing with the US 
in the face of a Soviet threat. The debate over the 
contentious issues in the report continued to be a 
central issue in Chinese politics in the months 
following the Congress. 
While there were ups and downs in Chinese 
propaganda throughout the remainder of 1969, ten-
sion in Sino-Soviet relations remained high, in large 
measure because until September the Chinese con-
tinued aggressive border patrolling and this resulted 
in additional armed clashes, and because Moscow 
responded by dropping veiled hints about a nuclear

strike. By August and September a number of 
Western observers, including some intelligence 
analysts, had concluded that a Sino-Soviet war was 
inevitable in the near term. Whether or not the 
Chinese themselves expected war is not certain, 
but there is little doubt that they were alarmed 
and that the crisis atmosphere reinforced the posi-
tion of the Chinese moderates who were disposed 
to be receptive to the overtures for improved Sino-
US relations which were coming out of Washington. 
In what was almost certainly a compromise be-
tween the moderates and their opponents, the 
Chinese agreed in October to open negotiations on 
the border dispute with Moscow, and then in Jan-
uary 1970 announced they would be willing to re-
schedule the aborted February 1969 Warsaw talks 
with the US. While it almost immediately became 
apparent that they were not taking the Sino-Soviet 
border talks seriously, they tried to keep up momen-
tum in relations with the US by meeting in Warsaw 
in February 1970 and then scheduling another ses-
sion of the bilateral talks for May 1970. Thus, the 
basic foreign policy goal of justifying steps toward 
an opening to the US was well served by the 2 
March crisis; though, as discussed subsequently, 
Lin's drive toward expanding his power and influ-
ence in party affairs was not derailed but only 
slowed. He continued to oppose each move in the 
direction of Sino-US rapprochement. In this con-
text, the Sino-Soviet clash of 1969 was a prelude 
to the decisive confrontation between the moder-
ates and the military which began in 1969 and came 
to a crisis two years later?the fall of Lin Piao. 
III. WATERSHED: THE FALL OF LIN PIM) 
OVERVIEW 
By almost all surface criteria, Lin Piao had won 
a stunning victory at the Ninth Party Congress, pri-
marily at the expense of Chou En-lai, his principal 
rival. Chou's power base was in the governmental 
bureaucracies, and of the six men drawn from this 
sector on the Politburo in 1968, all but two, Chou 
and Li Hsien-nien, lost their positions at the Con-
gress. Eleven military men were added to the Polit-
buro, a majority of whom were apparently Lin 
supporters. Lin's close ally Chen Po-ta was named 
to the crucial Standing Committee of the Politburo, 
and more importantly, the Congress formally 
adopted a new constitution designating Lin by 
name as Mails successor. Lin, it appeared, was well 
on his way to supreme power within China. And 
yet, in just over two years after the Ninth Party 
Congress, Lin had fallen from power following an 
intense and ultimately violent struggle within the 
Chinese leadership. 
Lin's fall was far more than the purging of a 
single individual. It was preceded by an elaborate 
conspiracy against Mao that involved a large number 
of individuals, and was followed by a massive 
purge of virtually all of China's ranking central 
military leaders. In the context of the framework 
presented in this paper, the Lin Piao affair repre-
sented the crisis stage of the struggle for power 
between the moderate coalition and the military 
that had been under way since the winding down 
of the Cultural Revolution in 1968. In relative terms, 
the radical coalition played only a marginal role. 
Most previous explanations of the Lin Piao crisis 
have down-played the role of foreign policy issues. 
By contrast, this study presents the view that these 
issues, and more specifically what they implied 
in terms of resource allocation and the resultant 
balance of power between the moderate and mili-
tary coalitions, are central to explaining the course 
of events that preceded Lin's abortive 1971 coup. 
In brief, Lin appears to have consistently opposed 
any steps toward rap prochment with the US 
throughout 1969 and 1970. He apparently seized 
on the US invasion of Cambotlia in the spring 
of 1970 to argue for the cancellation of the sched-
uled Sino-US talks in Warsaw and to persuade 
Mao to make a series of reconciliatory gestures 
toward Moscow. This shift toward Lin's approach 
to foreign policy came to an abrupt end following 
the Second Plenum of the Ninth Party Congress in 
August 1970 when the balance of internal political 
forces began to tilt against Lin. Soon thereafter, 
there was a major change in China's propaganda 
line and by December 1970 Mao felt strong enough 
to extend the historic invitation to President Nixon. 
Lin's continued opposition to the opening to the 
US is well documented, but what is more difficult

Lin Piao presenting the Political Report at the Ninth Party Congress 
to explain is why he felt compelled to risk a con-
frontation with Mao on this issue. The answer ap-
parently lies in the fact that concomitant with the 
critical debates over foreign policy issues in 1971, 
there was an intense struggle over the allocation 
of scarce resources, with Lin and his supporters 
favoring the continuation of the high levels of mili-
tary expenditures they had obtained for 1969-1971. 
If Chou succeeded in enhancing China's sense of 
security by improved relations with Washington, 
they reasoned, a key element in their rationale for 
high military expenditures would be undercut. They 
may also have argued that Soviet-US progress in 
SALT posed a major danger to China's national 
security and that the US was, because of its "col-
lusion" with the USSR, an untrustworthy counter-
balance to Soviet power. 
These issues were so intimately linked that the 
old question of whether domestic or foreign policy 
considerations were paramount misses the more im-
portant point that in China there does not appear 
to be a wide division between the worlds of the 
foreign and domestic policymaker. In the words 
of Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua "foreign poli-
cies are inseparable from domestic policies" in 
China. 
A. Traditional Explanations 
Most previous studies of Lin's fall have concluded 
that the "central issue" in the crisis was Mao's 
decision to reassert civilian control over a military 
establishment that had grown too powerful as a 
result of the Cultural Revolution, and the military's 
ultimately violent resistance to moves designed to 
implement this decision. By contrast, these studies

"WpailimailanIPP) 
dismiss the heated debates over foreign policy 
issues among China's leaders as "more tactical than 
causative or fundamental in nature," and suggest 
that Lin's favorable references to Moscow were 
made only "to score debating points."* While the 
discussion that follows does not dispute the view 
that the Lin crisis was ultimately over whether 
"civilians" or Lin Piao and his military supporters 
would rule China, it does attempt to show that the 
debate over foreign policy was not a tactical side-
show but rather a central and fundamental issue 
in the power struggle that preceded Lin's abortive 
coup. 
B. Foreign Policy Differences 
As early as 1969, Lin had found himself at odds 
with Mao and Chou over whether or not to begin 
the process of improving relations with the US. 
After apparently derailing the first attempt to re-
new the Warsaw talks, Lin used every occasion 
possible to criticize Chou's line that improving 
relations with the US should be a priority objective 
of China's foreign policy. In the fall of 1969, he 
probably insisted that if the Warsaw talks were 
rescheduled for February 1970, Sino-Soviet border 
negotiations would also have to begin. And then 
in April 1970, the US and South Vietnamese in-
vasion of Cambodia gave Lin the leverage he 
needed to press for a major shift away from the 
opening to the US and toward some form of 
reconciliation with Moscow. Lin undoubtedly 
argued that this US action proved that a major 
premise of Chou's policy?that the US was with-
drawing from Vietnam and therefore no longer 
constituted a threat to China?was erroneous. Using 
this argument, he apparently convinced Mao not 
only to cancel the scheduled May 1970 session of 
the Warsaw talks, but also to revert to the anti-US 
rhetoric of the Cultural Revolution. In a statement 
*CIA, "Policy Issues in the Purge of Lin Piao," 
intelli-
ence Re sort October 1972 SECRET/NFD/NDA/CD/ 
approved personally by Mao and issued on 20 May, 
the US was shrilly condemned, and President Nixon 
was assaulted as a perpetrator of "fascist atrocities." 
Significantly, within hours after it was issued, Lin 
personally read this statement to a massive rally 
in Peking organized by the PLA. Moreover, an 
authoritative joint editorial in June took a savage 
swipe at Chou and the moderate coalition by stat-
ing that the "principal criterion" for judging a loyal 
revolutionary was his attitude toward the US. 
Lin was also apparently active in engineering 
a change in the direction of Chinese policy toward 
the USSR. The earliest indication came during 
Mao's and Lin's joint appearance at the May Day 
rally, an event which marked the first time the 
two leaders had appeared together in public in 
some six months. On this occasion, Mao went so 
far as to exchange comments with the chief Soviet 
negotiator to the border talks, an important sym-
bolic gesture. 
Just as significantly, there occurred at this time 
a marked and prolonged decrease in the volume 
and virulence of anti-Soviet propaganda. From 22 
April until 6 September, Peking issued no authori-
tative direct attack on Moscow and there was a 
notable restraint in the few anti-Soviet stories that 
were printed. Most remarkably, there was virtually 
no commentary on the Brezhnev Doctrine on the 
1970 anniversary of the August 1968 Soviet inva-
sion of Czechoslovakia. Indeed, the topic of the 
Brezhnev Doctrine which had received enormous 
media treatment in 1968 and 1969 was addressed 
authoritatively during this period only once?by 
Chou En-lai. While at first Moscow continued its 
propaganda attacks unabated, by early summer the 
Soviets had begun to restrain their own polemics. 
And on 15 August, the Soviets dispatched Deputy 
Foreign Minister Ilichev to Peking as their newly 
appointed chief negotiator in the border talks. 
One of the clearest indications of tension between 
the moderates and the military was the marked 
schizophrenia evident in Peking's treatment of Army 
Day on 1 August. While Chou En-lai's statement 
just prior to Army Day stressed the dangers of 
the Brezhnev Doctrine and the joint editorials on 
1 August pointed to the Soviet build-up on the

Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng, left front, reviewing PLA troops 
Sino-Soviet border, the major speech of the day 
by the PLA's Chief of Staff Huang Yung-sheng 
made almost no mention of the Soviet threat. 
Indeed, Huang concentrated his fire almost solely 
on the US and the danger it posed for China's 
national interests.* 
*Huang, who was almost certainly acting on Lin's behalf, 
was purged following Lin's abortive coup in 1971. The 
most detailed studies of the purge are: "Missing Chinese 
Military Leaders," Research Aid, August 1972, SECRET/ 
NFD; and "China's Regional and Provincial Leaders: The 
Purge of the Military, the Rise of Old Party Cadres," In-
telligence Report, April 1973, SECRET/NFD. 
Events began to move rapidly against Lin and 
his military supporters soon after Army Day. While 
Mao may have been susceptible to Lin's arguments 
in the period immediately following the Cambodian 
invasion, reasoning perhaps that a brief tactical 
shift toward the USSR would have an impact on 
US policy, he almost certainly was displeased to 
see how far Lin was carrying things. It was in 
these circumstances that the Second Plenum of the 
Ninth Party Congress convened?in August 1970. 
At the Plenum, Lin and his supporters gambled 
that they were in a strong enough position to

challenge Mao on the crucial issue of whether to 
retain the constitutional position of Chief of State.* 
They not only lost this gamble but Lin's close 
associate, Chen Po-ta was purged and branded a 
Soviet agent, a clear indication of the extreme 
dangers of even appearing to adapt a "soft" line 
toward Moscow. In addition to these setbacks, Lin 
also apparently lost out in the debate over foreign 
policy. At any rate, the communique that was 
issued following the Plenum took a foreign policy 
line that differed markedly from the thrust of 
Chinese policy in the previous four months. While 
some restraint was evident in the communique, 
Moscow was authoritatively denounced for the first 
time since prior to the Cambodian incursion, and 
the moderates' policy of improving relations with 
the US and other "friends all over the world" was 
strongly endorsed. 
The Plenum's communique was followed by an 
even harsher attack on Moscow in an authoritative 
People's Daily Commentator article on 13 Septem-
ber. The NCNA report accompanying the Com-
mentator article emphasized this sensitive issue 
of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia comparing 
it to Hitler's invasion of Poland. Moscow responded 
in kind and the brief thaw in Soviet-Chinese rela-
tions was replaced by a period of harsh invective 
which lasted until January 1971 when a new period 
of relative calm set in, as a result of a Soviet effort 
to wind down the polemics. 
Concomitant with the escalation of Sino-Soviet 
polemics, there were a number of major advances 
for the moderate coalition's program in other areas. 
In the three months following the Plenum, recogni-
tion agreements were concluded with four coun-
tries including Canada and Italy. State-to-state 
bilateral relations with Burma also improved, a 
key barometer of the influence of the moderates 
on policy. At the level of ideology, a major doctrinal 
departure was apparent in a November speech by 
Chou's close associate Chiao Kuan-hua. Chiao re-
formulated and expanded the concept of peaceful 
coexistence by stating that it applied to relations 
between "all countries whether they have the same

position abolished; Lin, reasoning that this diminished his 
own prestige as Mao's heir apparent and would impair his

this change. 
or different social systems." This contrasted sharply 
with the previous authoritative statement on the 
subject made by Lin Piao at the Ninth Party 
Congress. Lin at that time had made an important 
distinction between the principles to be applied 
to capitalist and socialist countries, stating that the 
former should be dealt with on the basis of peaceful 
coexistence while relations with the latter should 
follow the principle of "proletarian international-
ism." Chiao's statement marked a clear and unam-
biguous shift away from an ideologically based 
foreign policy to one emphasizing state-to-state 
relations, and thereby constituted a major victory 
for the moderate coalition. 
These developments set the stage for Mao's cru-
cial interview with Edgar Snow in December 1970, 
during which Mao said that President Nixon "would 
be welcome" to visit Peking. While it can be argued 
that Mao had already lined up a consensus behind 
this initiative, there are also reasons to believe 
that Mao, perhaps in consultation with only Chou 
En-lai, decided to float the concept of a Nixon 
visit and then wait to see how strong the reaction 
would be within China's top leadership. He un-
doubtedly expected strong opposition, and may have 
decided on a bold move making China's invitation 
a fait accompli that would be difficult to reverse, 
even by a leader with the political clout of Lin Piao. 
It is also important to note that Lin and his 
military supporters were faced by early 1971 not

only with rapid progress in Sino-US relations, but 
also with a major change in the direction of China's 
policy toward Japan, a nation that virtually all 
Chinese military men looked upon as an historic 
enemy and as a potentially very powerful future 
enemy.* As Chou En-lai later told a high level 
delegation to Peking, Lin Piao and his supporters 
had opposed the opening both to the US and Japan. 
Thus, moves toward improving relations with the 
Japanese were probably as hotly debated as the 
Sino-US issue. 
As these events occurred, Lin realized that the 
tide was running against him. In February, he 
approved the drawing up of a contingency plan 
to seize power forcefully, a set of papers which 
were labeled the "571 Documents." While the 
foreign policy analysis in these documents is not 
extensive, it does reflect the views of Lin's group 
on the Sino-Soviet-US triangle. They attribute 
progress in Soviet-US relations, that is the drift 
toward detente, to China's needless perpetuation 
of the conflict with Moscow. Because "China and 
the Soviet Union have become rivals," the document 
states, "the latter sympathizes with the U.S." The 
obvious conclusion of this line of argument is that 
China would be better off if it decreased tension 
with the Soviet Union. In fact, one section of the 
documents advocates "secret talks, between China 
and the Soviet Union" aimed at "a temporary pro-
tective nuclear umbrella." Interestingly enough, the 
documents also list, without elaboration, "China-
US talks" under the foreign negotiations section of 
the plan, an indication that the military coalition 
did not intend to break off communications with 
the US altogether. 
Lin's opposition to the thrust of China's evolving 
foreign policy was not confined to behind the scenes 
plotting. According to an internal party document 
issued after Lin's abortive coup, "a prolonged policy 
debate" took place during the early months of 
1971 during which Lin "violently opposed" ex-
tending an invitation to President Nixon to visit 
Peking. During this debate, Lin tried to browbeat 
proponents of the Nixon visit by saying that "he 
opposed it by virtue of the fact that he was Mao's 
successor and was the director of the People's 
*CIA, "China and Japan: Breaking the Logjam," Intel-
ligence Memorandum, No. 0833/72, 14 February 1971. 
Liberation Army." He reportedly insisted that it 
was improper to improve relations with capitalist 
countries before improving relations with the USSR. 
C. Policy Issues and Power 
At a critical point in any policy debate between 
leaders at the pinnacle of power, differences over 
issues become so intense that it is not the policy 
itself which is paramount, but rather the authority, 
power, and influence of the leader advocating the 
policy. And at this juncture the debate over policy 
is transformed into a struggle for who will hold 
the ultimate power to decide the issue. In 1973 
no less an authority than Deputy Foreign Minister 
Chiao Kuan-hua said that debates over foreign 
policy issues occur frequently, but that if one 
opposes a whole series of decisions, one becomes a 
prime candidate for being stripped of all power 
and purged from the party and government.* 
In this context, the key question is not whether 
Lin Piao opposed the opening to the US and Japan, 
but why he judged that this issue was important 
enough to run the ultimate risk of strongly and 
*Chiao, who became Foreign Minister in 1974, made his 
statement in response to the following direct question: "It 
appears that on a number of occasions in the last decade 
foreign policy issues have been a matter of serious debate 
and division. I realize that this is a sensitive question, but 
could you give us your views on this matter?"

UNIDRA 
repeatedly opposing a policy that clearly had the 
approval of Chairman Mao himself. 
Part of the answer to this question lies in the 
dynamics of the rivalry between Lin and Chou 
and their respective power bases. Very early in 
the protracted debate over policy toward the US 
and the USSR, Lin put his prestige on the line 
and probably argued that the US would remain 
deeply involved militarily in Asia and would there-
fore remain a principal enemy of China. Chou 
made a different estimate which eventually proved 
correct. Lin also probably argued that in the proper 
circumstances Moscow would be willing to make 
a significant move to decrease Sino-Soviet tension 
and that this option should be explored. Chou 
countered that Moscow would offer only unsatis-
factory gestures; and in this, also, events proved 
him right. So in policy debate after policy debate, 
a certain dynamic propelled both Lin and Chou to 
attack the positions of the other in order to dis-
credit the policymaker as well as the policy. 
The roots of Lin's intransigent position, however, 
probably lie even deeper. He and his supporters 
were prepared to risk their careers because they 
realized that the power they had attained, as well 
as the even more exalted status they were seeking, 
were jeopardized by the implications of the policies 
advocated by their rivals in the moderate coalition. 
Decreased tension with the US and Japan and 
the increased sense of security that would grow out 
of improved relations with a nuclear power like 
the US, Lin and his supporters reasoned, would 
lead to pressures for smaller military expenditures, 
especially in the areas they believed to be critical?
nuclear weapons, missiles, aircraft, and advanced 
military technology in general. And with a declining 
military budget, their influence and authority would 
also decline. Having fought his way to within a 
short distance of ultimate power in China, Lin 
saw the prospect of a reallocation of China's re-
sources away from his power base in the military in 
general and the air force in particular as a direct 
assault on his personal authority. Thus, rather than 
see their power and authority drained away by the 
thrust of the moderate coalition's program, Lin 
and his supporters first opposed this program at 
every possible juncture, and, when this failed, at-
tempted to seize power to reverse the unwelcome 
transformation of China's domestic and foreign 
policy that was gaining momentum in 1971. 
D. Resource Allocation 
Evidence for the above interpretation may be 
found in three areas:  
debate25X 1X4 
in the public media, and retrospective reconstruc-
tions of the history of military procurement in China. 
All of these are mutually reinforcing. 
First of all it is important to note that discussion 
of the parameters of China's Fourth Five Year 
Plan ( 1971-1975) had begun in late 1970 and con-
tinued until after Lin's fall in late 1971. The debate 
over allocation of China's scarce resources under 
the Plan was almost certainly sharply contested. 
Thus, concomitant with the debates over foreign 
policy issues came an intense struggle over re-
source allocation, a struggle which inevitably be-
came entangled with the specifics of the quarrel 
over foreign policy. 
25X1X6 
This version of events is corroborated by another 
25X1X6 
contemporary account 
25X1X6 
the political crisis in China revolved around the 
allocation of resources to the PLA, and in par-
ticular the share of the budget the air force was 25X1X60 
to receive. 
Like many policy debates within China, this one 
found its way into the public media, though in 
slightly disguised form. Throughout the summer of 
1971 numerous articles in People's Daily as well 
as some Radio Peking broadcasts focused attention 
on the problem of whether "electronics" or "steel 
and iron" should take priority in advancing the 
development of the national economy. A 13 June

article in People's Daily argued that one group of 
"political swindlers" within China ( i.e., Lin and 
his group) saw "atomic technology and jet engine 
technology" (i.e., electronics) as the key to enhanc-
ing China's power and status in world affairs. A 
Radio Peking broadcast on 20 August was even 
more pointed. It charged that the same group of 
"swindlers" believed that advanced weapons were 
the "key to victory," and that once China possessed 
them, "all imperialists will be finished and over-
thrown." Significantly, these views were sharply 
contrasted with those of Mao who was quoted as 
condemning any strategy which was premised on 
the concept that "weapons decide everything." 
Recent intelligence studies on military expendi-
tures for procurement of new equipment also bear 
out this interpretation.* Indeed, the rise and fall 
in the influence of the military, coalition is starkly 
reflected in the statistics presented in these studies. 
During the period when Lin and the military were 
in an ascendant position, from roughly 1968 until 
the end of 1971, military spending on procurement 
in all fields increased dramatically, with a growing 
proportion going to aircraft and missiles combined, 
that is to what in 1971 was being called "elec-
tronics." Just as significant, however, are the ex-
tremely sharp cutbacks in this same area that 
followed Lin's fall from power in 1971. While the 
amounts expended for the procurement of land 
arms and naval forces have declined only slightly, 
expenditures on new aircraft and missiles have 
fallen dramatically. In overall terms, the realloca-
tion of resources is shown by the fact that military 
procurement has decreased in relation to total in-
dustrial production ( see charts on page 31). 
It should be noted that this interpretation of 
Lin's fall from power does not argue that foreign 
policy issues were more important than the general 
*CIA, "Trends in Military Equipment Procurement in 
China, 1964-1973, in US Cost Terms," Intelligence Report, 
August 1974, SECRET; the general findings of this study 
have been declassified and published as "Allocation of 
Resources in the Soviet Union and China. Hearing before

of the joint Economic Committee Congress of the United 
States Ninety-Third Congress, Second Session, Executive 
Session, April 12, 1974." Another study based on these 
statistics is "Military Developments in China: Implications

issue of civilian versus military rule. In effect, 
foreign policy issues were so intimately linked to a 
cluster of other issues that they formed an integral 
part of the overall struggle between the moderate 
coalition and the military coalition. A debate over 
resource allocation and foreign policy was the im-
mediate catalyst because it brought to a head the 
entire question of the continued predominance of 
the military in Chinese politics and society. Mao 
and Chou were undoubtedly engaged in a broadly-
based campaign to prevent Lin and the military 
from expanding their power still further, and to 
do so they not only confronted this issue specifi-
cally, but also used the thrust of their foreign 
policy program to focus the debate on the concrete 
issue of resource allocation.* Just as in 1969 when 
they had used a foreign policy crisis to further 
their domestic goals, so in 1971 they used arguments 
drawn from the implications of their diplomatic 
program for the same purpose. 
*In this regard it is interesting to note that Mao himself 
has stated explicitly that one tactic he employs is to attack 
his opponents on the basis of issues rather than to confront 
them directly.

All of this points to a general view that there is 
not as wide a division in China as in the US be-
tween the worlds of the foreign and domestic 
policymaker; indeed, it is reasonable to conclude 
that the small number of men at the apex of China's 
political structure do not make any significant dis-
tinctions between the spheres of domestic, foreign, 
and national security policy. Indeed, Foreign Min-
ister Chiao Kuan-hua has stated explicitly that in 
China "foreign policies are inseparable from domes-
tic policies," and that no separate formal decision-
making structure for foreign policy similar to the 
National Security Council exists in China. 
E. Internal Politics and the Soviet Question 
In the immediate aftermath of Lin's demise in 
September 1971, the leadership struggle between 
the moderates and the radicals apparently inten-
sified. For about ten or twelve days between 
roughly 12 September and 25 September, the top 
leadership met in Peking to thrash out the measures 
that were to be taken in the wake of the crisis. 
During this period, the radicals may well have 
attempted to take advantage of the uncertain situa-
a6K. 
Just as in 1969 when the leadership struggle 
intensified prior to the Ninth Party Congress, 
China's central leadership resorted to playing up 
the Soviet threat in the unsettled and fluid situa-
tion that followed Lin's abortive coup. 
33 
Indeed, a crisis atmosphere 12E0(1 Dla 
transmitted not only to party cadres but also to 
China's informed public. Summing up his impres-
sions of what was going on, a resident of Canton 
stated that in September there was "a period of 
intense war alert during which hostilities with the 
Soviet Union were expected at any time." 
In reality, however, China's central leadership 
was far more concerned about possible Soviet 
manipulation of the internal conflict within China 
than any direct Soviet military action. Indeed, 
Chou told a visitor in early October that he did 
not fear immediate war with Moscow, but that he 
was concerned that the Soviets had been attempt-
ing to exploit differences within China over military 
priorities in the hope that pro-Soviet elements within 
the PLA and the Party might come to power. At 
the same time, briefings of senior Chinese officials 
strongly emphasized that they should maintain ab-
solute secrecy concerning the Lin crisis lest Moscow 
learn the details. 
Since 1971, Chinese leaders have continued to 
express their view that the Soviets not only have 
had lines of communication to certain elements 
within China, but also that the Soviets consistent195X1X4a 
try to exacerbate differences within China. In the 
IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE US 
A. The "Collusion" Theme as a Key Indicator 
Since they began the transformation of China's 
domestic and foreign policies in 1968, backers of 
the moderate alternative have had to fight a two-
front domestic war. On the one hand, they have 
been opposed by the radicals who were hostile 
to the moderate policy cluster for ideological rea-
sons. On the other, they have been opposed by the

military coalition not only because it was seeking 
supreme power in China, but also on grounds of 
"national security." 
While the leverage of the radical coalition on 
policy decisions has now been considerably re-
duced, this apparently is not the case for the mili-
tary coalition.* This is for three reasons: many 
military leaders have their own independent power 
bases; they almost certainly have sympathizers 
within the moderate coalition in general and the 
foreign policy establishment in particular; they have 
a strong argument which is cast in terms of China's 
vital national security interests. Their argument 
probably would go something like this: 
A basic premise of the moderates' national security 
program is that "contention" will always win out over 
"collusion" in Soviet-US relations, and that China can 
therefore count on a powerful US as a counterbalance 
to the USSR in world affairs. This premise, however, 
is extremely dangerous because it does not take into 
consideration two very real possibilities: 1) the first 
is that the US, because of domestic political and eco-
nomic difficulties as well as international setbacks, 
may fall seriously behind Moscow in terms of the 
global balance of power and therefore be unable 
to adequately fill the role of a strategic counterbalance 
to Soviet power; 2) perhaps in part because of the 
above, the US may well find it convenient or even nec-
essary to place such a great emphasis on improved 
relations with the Soviets, especially in the critical area 
of strategic arms limitation, that it will be willing 
to sacrifice its relations with China to attain this goal. 
Rather than rely on the US as a strategic counterbalance 
to the USSR, China must in the short term ameliorate 
tensions with Moscow to decrease the immediate threat 
of a nuclear war that China could not win, and, in the 
long term, place emphasis on building up a credible 
nuclear defense structure that could ensure China's 
security in the face of the USSR, the US, or Japan 
should it become a nuclear power. Thus, China is 
endangering its national security by placing too large 
a share of its national resources in the service of 
economic development rather than military expendi-
tures, and the diplomatic rationale for following this 
course may well be incorrect because it fails to take 
into consideration the prospect that Soviet-US compe-
tition in world affairs could well be replaced by a 
degree of cooperation that would seriously endanger 
China's national security. 
Seen in this perspective, events which signal sig-
nificant or rapid progress in Soviet-US relations, 
especially in the area of strategic arms limitation, 
*CIA, "Chinese Debate Defense Spending, Related Is-
sues," Chinese Affairs, 16 September 1974, SECRET/NFD. 
are likely to lead to renewed debate within China 
over the wisdom of its present stance, and could 
lead to an increase of the relative power of the 
military coalition.* Indeed, in the immediate after-
math of the Nixon-Brezhnev summit of June 1973 
and the signing of the Soviet-US agreement on the 
prevention of nuclear war, a "sharp and intense 
struggle" occurred within China over the implica-
tions of this event. For the first time since 1969, 
Chinese propaganda stressed the theme of "col-
lusion" instead of the standard line, reiterated by 
Chou at the Tenth Party Congress, that "conten-
tion" would always predominate over collusion in 
Soviet-US relations.** Significantly, a ranking mem-
ber of the foreign ministry establishment appears 
to have written the analysis that touched off this 
struggle, and it is probable that he was supported 
by elements within the military establishment dur-
ing the debate. Before it had run its course, the 
moderates once again resorted to a round of vitriolic 
anti-Soviet propaganda in public and dire private 
and public warnings of the prospect of an immedi-
ate Soviet threat. Indications that the military per-
sisted in pushing for some adjustment in China's 
foreign policy stance continued until December, 
when an authoritative Red Flag article, most prob-
ably approved by Mao himself, criticized those who 
**One such article accused Moscow of using the Soviet-
US agreement on the prevention of nuclear war to proclaim 
the successes of its "peace diplomacy," while still carrying 
out "nuclear intimidation and blackmail against the people 
of various countries." NCNA also replayed a caustic article 
from a Japanese leftist journal entitled "The Illusion and 
Truth of the 'US-Soviet Summit?the Real Features of Soviet 
Social Imperialism." Brezhnev's goal in the summit talks, 
the article argued, was to "strengthen the hegemonic rule 
of the two superpowers"; the article also warned that world 
issues should not be settled by the "wisdom" of the super-
powers. Similar themes were evident in a theoretical article 
in Red Flag which reflected extreme sensitivity to Brezh-
nev's boast that the political climate of the world is deter-
mined by the Soviet Union and the US. In one of the most 
defensive statements in the piece, the article asserts that the 
US and the USSR "certainly cannot determine the fate of the 
world" since the "people and the people alone are the 
motive force in the makin I of world histor ." MM.

wanted to make friends with China's close neigh-
bors rather than ally with distant nations. And 
while it cannot be demonstrated conclusively, it 
seems likely that the massive reassignment of Mili-
tary Regional Commanders that Mao ordered in 
December 1973 was partially motivated by con-
tinued opposition within the military establishment 
to Mao's "revolutionary line in foreign policy." Since 
this reshuffle, it has appeared at various times that 
Mao was preparing a massive purge of those ele-
ments in the military that were still resisting him 
and his policies, and there are some indications that 
he is presently displeased that this has not 
occurred.* 
The important point to note here, however, is 
that the military coalition remains an influential 
factor in Chinese politics, and that US policy and 
action toward the Soviet Union, especially on the 
issue of SALT, could have an important impact 
on the configuration of political power within 
China. 
B. The Level of Tension 
Overall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations has de-
clined since 1969, in large measure because the 
moderate policy coalition has extended its control, 
the internal situation has become somewhat more 
stable, and China has received greater recognition 
from the international community. Nevertheless, 
tension could easily again flare up if during the 
protracted and delicate succession process already 
under way, a group within China were to become 
predominant which judges that its interests would 
be served by a provocation such as the 1969 border 
clash. Whether or not such a situation evolves 
depends in part on events outside China in general 
and on the actions of the USSR and the US in 
particular. 
US moves which would enhance China's status, 
such as establishing full diplomatic relations, would 
probably strengthen the moderates' hold on power 
and their commitment to the policy of expanding 
ties with non-Communist countries. Paradoxically, 
such developments would probably also serve to 
lessen the imperatives pressing elements in the Chi-
nese leadership toward periodic crises with the 
USSR. Not only would the leadership have a de-
creased need to play up the Soviet threat to deflect 
attack from domestic critics, but?with more self-
confidence regarding China's status in the interna-
tional hierarchy?these leaders would probably be 
more willing to enter into serious negotiations with 
the Soviets over the border issue. If Moscow were 
careful to take Chinese sensitivities into considera-
tion by making a substantial conciliatory gesture 
( such as a sizable drawdown of its forces in the 
border area), some form of mutually acceptable 
border arrangement could conceivably be worked 
out. 
Even if some form of border arrangement were 
concluded, Sino-Soviet competition and contention 
would not cease. While the primary impact of a 
border arrangement would be to decrease substan-
tially the chances of some future border incident 
escalating into a nuclear war, China's interests 
are at odds with the USSR's throughout Asia, 
and a border agreement would not end the struggle 
for influence and power there and in the rest of 
the world. 
Moreover, even if there were some improvement 
in Sino-Soviet relations, the US would still have le-
verage for maintaining Sino-Soviet competition. The 
moderates, having been strengthened by normaliza-
tion of the Sino-US relations, would probably allow 
the logic of their thesis on enhancing China's status 
to carry them even further in their pragmatic search 
for power and prestige through conventional di-
plomacy and economic development. Indeed, given 
the right circumstances, a moderate Chinese gov-
ernment might in the future be amenable to expand-
ing substantially its cultural, economic, and even 
military ties with the West in general and the US 
in particular. Should the Sino-US relationship ad-
vance along these lines, there is little doubt that 
there would be serious Soviet concern, and that 
this would express itself in increased Sino-Soviet 
tension. 
At the same time, expanded ties with the US 
would over time directly or indirectly provide 
greater resources for meeting the military coalition's

goal of strengthening China's military capabilities. 
And an amelioration of internal antagonisms on 
this issue is likely to increase support for the mod-
erates among at least some elements of the mili-
tary, a development which in turn would con-

leadership coalition with vested interests in mail-4-
