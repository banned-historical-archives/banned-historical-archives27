 This, National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) was requested by the Depart-
 merit of State and Pacific Command. It discusses how relations between
 Chia and Taiwan will develop in the next three years-toward greater ten-
 sio and hostility or toward cooperation and accommodation? We selected
 this time frame because it encompasses the presidential election in Taiwan
 in  arch 2000, the US change of administration in January 2001, and a
 new Party Congress in China that should be held in 200
 The key assumptions, which we will hold constant throughout the period of

 Key Judgments
 China-Taiwan: Prospects for
 Cross-Strait Relations
 The most likely outcome in cross-Strait relations over the next three years
 is a dynamic and tense environment. Tension is likely to remain high or
 rise, and rising tension increases the chances of military incidents..
 } We judge that, over the period of this Estimate, chances are better than even
 tat t China will conduct a major military exercise near Taiwan as it did in
 January-March 1996. Also, chances are better than even that there will be
 small-scale incidents between the military forces of China and Taiwan
 ranging from an accidental air incident to the siezure by Beijing of a lightly
 manned offshore island. We judge chances are very low, however, that
 Beijing will actually follow through with large-scale combat operations,
 such as invading Taiwan or a heavily defended offshore island, conducting
 missile attacks against targets on Taiwan, or blockading Taiwan with air or
 naval force
 Fe assess chances of major sustained conflict are low because-
 ?LA full-scale military assault presents formidable materiel and human
 costs with a large risk of failure for China.
 ? Pomestic factors on both sides will contribute to a tense atmosphere but
 also will bound the risk each side is willing to take to gain its objectives.
 Taiwan's new leaders will try to avoid antagonizing China to the point it
 would disrupt Taiwan's economy and stability. To avoid arousing criti-
 cism within the Politburo, Chinese leaders will appear firm in dealing
 with Taiwan, but they will be wary of bold moves that could backfire and
 play into the hands of political opponent]
 ? China's perceptions of international actors-notably the power and influ-
 ence of the United States-will constrain China's behavior.(
 IW:e see prospects as likely for generally increasing tension because
 ? China sees trends on Taiwan as unfavorable and is concerned that time
 will run out on its reunification objectives. China will be inclined to
 Sec et
 r;ntinually weigh coercion as well as military ower as principal means
 of dealing with separatist sentiment in Taiwan.
 ? Taiwan will continue to press its desire for increased international status
 and freedom of action from China. The controversy that erupted over Lee
 Teng-hui's assertion of a "special stateto state relationship" with the
 mainland illustrates Taiwan's approach n
 Key Drivers
 LWe assess key drivers that will determine relations across the Strait will
 include
 nternal Politics
 Taiwan is a hot-button issue within the Chinese leadership and leaders
 Icannot afford to appear "soft" on Taiwan. Leaders on Taiwan would risk
 loss of popular support if they were perceived as jeopardizing Taiwan's
 security.
 Legitimacy and Respect
 Beijing perceives the Taiwan issue as an internal matter and expects the
 international community to accede to its wishes on Taiwan and adhere to
 "one-China" policies (that most countries have formally accepted) because
 it is an emerging great power that deserves status, respect, and, on the ques-
 tion of Taiwan, deference. Taiwan perceives it should have international
 legitimacy because it is a democracy with economic power.
 Legacy
 Leaders on both sides of the Strait perceive their personal legacies will be)
 enhanced if they can make progress on dealing with the other side. But
 their key objectives are incompatible.
 Perceptions and Expectations of the United States
 US policies are significant to the attitudes of both sides. China sees Wash-
 ngton as encouraging Taiwan's separatist stance but also calculates that it
 an restrain US actions in support of Taiwan. Taiwan perceives it has
 trong support in the US Congress and media for its objectives. Both sides
 will increase efforts to test the current or a new administration in Washing
 on-Beijing by pressing the United States on arms sales, Taiwan by look
 ng for additional security guarantees.

 Exercise Restraint
 I Military measures range from returning to normal military deployments
 along the Strait to conducting small-scale, Taiwan-focused exercises on the
 Strait. Diplomatic activity would range from toning down rhetoric against
 Taiwan's leaders and maintaining longstanding efforts to limit Taiwan's
 international activity. Economic measures would include encouraging Tai-
 wan to resume the "three links."
 ment of Taiwa
 Military measures would range from large-scale force deployments oppo-
 site Taiwan to deploying an out-of-area ground, airborne force to Fujian
 province (opposite Taiwan). Diplomatic measures would range from can-
 celing talks between cross-Strait negotiators to public hints at the need for
 a reunification timetable. Economic measures range from warning other
 countries of economic consequences of continued engagement with Taiwan
 to closing the Strait to shipping with lengthy military exercises.
 military action is impending to blockading a key Taiwan port.
 Punish Taiwan
 Military measures range from bombarding a Taiwan-occupied island to
 seizing such an island. Diplomatic measures would include demanding an i
 immediate cessation of US arms sales to Taiwan. Economic measures
 would range from spreading rumors in the Taiwan business community that,
 LLated above.
 China could attempt to blockade or invade Taiwan, but Beijing recognizes
 this would risk war with the United States. In our judgment, such a war is
 highly unlikely during the period of this Estimate because of the reasons
 political interaction.
 Movement Toward Reconciliation                             -~~
 Less likely, we assess, is a situation in which the various drivers interact to
 bring about an amelioration of tensions across the Strait. For example, eco-
 nomic interaction is seen by both sides as important, and economic interde-
 pendence could create more favorable conditions for political and military
 restraint. Also, the desire for legacy could cause leaders on both sides of
 the Strait to resume unofficial talks, hold secret talks, or even less likely,
 hold a summit to make progress on outstanding differences. In this
 outcome, China most likely would reduce its reliance on the military option
 and seek to engage Taiwan increasingly through economic, social, and

 Discussion
 China-Taiwan: Prospects for
 Cross-Strait Relations I
 Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's 9 July 1999
 declaration that cross-Strait ties are a "special
 state-to-state relationship" and Beijing's sharp
 verbal reaction-combined with the thus-far
 small-scale military posturing across the
 Strait-is the latest in a series of moves and
 countermoves across the Taiwan Strait ongoing
 since 1991 (see inset ). In our view, Lee's state-
 ment was as much designed for Taiwan's com-
 ing presidential election as for cross-Strait or
 international effect. Beijing has interpreted his
 statement as a further push for Taiwan's inde-
 pendence and has reacted vehemently. The
 ensuing crisis could worsen, especially if
 Beijing feels compelled to resort to greater mil-
 itary pressure to persuade Taiwan leaders to
 moderate Lee's statement and to influence Tai-
 wan's March 2000 presidential election. II
 A key issue for the United States is whether
 tensions can be contained in cross-Strait rela-
 tions, or whether they will move toward mili-
 tary conflict. US interests also would be
 affected favorably by a shift toward accommo-
 dation, which we see as much less likel
 LWhat China Wants
 The PRC's long-term objective is reunification.
 Within the time frame of this Estimate,
 Beijing's goal will be to prevent further
 Taiwan steps toward permanent separation
 Using Deng Xiaoping's "One Country, Two
 Systems" formula, Beijing states that Taipei
 can have a high degree of autonomy but must
 recognize it is part of "one China." Beijing's
 vision of a unified China, however, is not clear.
 China tends to identify more clearly that which
 it will not tolerate-for example, a Taiwan for-
 mal declaration of independence-than pre-
 cisely what Beijing wants.
 China's strategic objective stems directly from
 its perceived "century of humiliation," wherein
 superior powers-Western countries and
 Japan-carved out spheres of influence and
 controlled much of China's economy, politics,
 and social affairs. Territorial unification
 became a symbol of the Chinese revolution for
 both nationalists and communists. Today, the
 Chinese Communist Party sees its own legiti-
 macy as entwined with its ability to show
 progress toward the goal of reunifying Taiwan
 with the mainland. Taiwan's status also is a
 deeply emotional issue for many Chinese lead-
 ers and citizens
 yond this, China perceives Taiwan as a secu-
 rity problem. Chinese officials fear that Taiwan
 might develop closer military cooperation with
 a foreign military power such as the United
 States or Japan. Some Chinese officials have
 stated, for example, that Japan could cooperate
 with Taiwan in posing a barrier to China's
 regional and global influence. Some Chinese
 leaders point to the military alliance between
 Taiwan (the ROC) and the United States prioJ
 1                           \Sret
 :to the normalization of US-China relations on 1
 January 1979.' The PRC also wants to elimi-
 nate Taiwan as a base for subver ' n in case of
 domestic turmoil on the mainland.
 Tie assess Beijing over the next three years
 will
 ? dry to limit US support for Taiwan, particu-
 larly by pressuring Washington tease, or at
 least reduce, arms sales to Taipei. 1
 Continue to seek to undercut Taiwan's inter-
 national standing by competing with Taipei
 for diplomatic recognition, seeking to reduce
 even further the small number of states that
 recognize Taiwan as a legitimate govern-
 ment2. China's approach was clearly manifest
 when in February it vetoed a UN Security
 Council resolution continuing UN peace-
 keeping forces in Macedonia because the
 Macedonian Government established diplo-
 matic relations with Taiwan
 ?LBeijing perceives that such US support
 encourages the island to assert its de jure
 independence; by eroding US support, China
 thereby hopes to reduce the potential for Tai-
 wan to move toward ermanent separation
 from the mainland.! FI
 Oppose Taiwan's membership in interna-
 tional bodies in which statehood is required,
 including the United Nations, and try to~
 ' As part of normalizing relations with China, the United
 States not only ended its official diplomatic relations with Tai-
 wan, but also gave the one-year notice required that it was can-
 celing the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty and ending the official
 US military presence on Taiwan.0
 2 Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with 28 countries,
 mostly small countries in Central America, Africa, the Carib-
 bean, and South Pacific. Taiwan's most significant formal rela-
 tions-are with Panama. Taiwan has representative offices in 63

 tinue to insist on the "three links" (direct
 shipping, communications, and air transpor-
 tation) with Taiwan as steps toward political
 reunification.3 China's leaders also will
 encourage rapidly growing economic ties to
 Taiwan as both a source of growth and
 employment in China and as a means of
 developing a constituency in Taiwan favor-
 able to reunification. Beijing also insists that
 the reunification process begin with "political
 talks to end the state of hostilities," in addi-
 tion to the "technical" confidence-building
 talks between unofficial representatives that
 have proceeded off and on since 1992]
 -[Use rhetoric, political, and military actions
 to seek to move Taiwan leaders and voters
 away from taking steps toward greater
 independenc]
 What Taiwan Wants
 Taiwan's principal objective is to determine its
 own future, with future options including de
 jure independence, or, alternatively, some type
 of formal accommodation with China. Taipei
 wants to make these decisions on its own with-
 out bowing to pressure from China or others.
 For the period of this estimate, we assess Tai-
 wan will continue to try to maximize its free-
 dom of action while benefiting economically
 from growing cross-Strait trade and investment.
 Taiwan wants to avoid acceptance of the PRC's
 concept of "one China" and h  offered its own
 framework for cross-Strait ties
 3 The "three links" were originally proposed by China in 1979
 after its normalization of relations with the United States)
 Mina-Taiwan: Divergent Views
 on Cross-Strait Relations
 China's View
 Both sides should adhere to the principle of
 "one China."
 Taiwan is part of China. China's territory
 and sovereignty cannot be separated.
 China should be unified under the formula of
 "one country, two systems."
 Two sides should negotiate peaceful reunifi-
 cation step by step beginning with political
 talks on cessation of hostilities.
 Prefers peaceful reunification but will not
 renounce right to use force.
 Divergent Views
 We assess Taiwan, in pursuit of its strategic
 objective will: /
 ? 'Continue to promote its international identity.
 ;_.
 Besides competing with Beijing for diplo-
 matic recognition in developing countries,
 Taiwan will use "pragmatic diplomacy" to
 seek to enhance ties to the United States,
 Japan, European, and other developed coun-
 tries. Taiwan will view responsible participa-
 tion in the international community as
 strengthening its case]
 Taiwan's Viewu
 There is no "one-China " now.
 Taiwan and the mainland are separate and
 equal "states."
 Unification could come gradually after polit-
 ical democratization and economic reform
 on the mainland. .
 Substantive discussions to improve cultural,
 trade, and economic ties are mutually benefi-
 cial. Political talks are acceptable if China
 accepts Taiwan's "state-to-state " formula.
 Mainland must reciprocate Taiwan's 1991
 renunciation of force.
 -Take into account-while trying to shape-
 popular opinion in the formulation of its
 objectives. As an emergent democracy, Tai-
 wan's leaders are heavily influenced by pub-
 lic attitudes, and polls suggest that Taiwan's
 people do not favor either unification with the
 mainland or a formal declaration of indepen-
 dence that would bring down the wrath of
 Beijing. Public opinion strongly supported
 Lee's assertion that Taiwan's political status
 was equal to that of China, but the Taiwan
 public remains highly sensitive to threats to
 prosperity and stability ^
 Sec~sk
 [The View From Beijing
 China on balance sees political and social
 trends as unfavorable to achieving its objectives
 as Taiwan remains separate, and shared bonds
 gradually dissolve. Taiwan's democratic evolu-
 tion has strengthened Taiwan's de facto inde-
 pendence, particularly as Lee Teng-hui has
 asserted Taiwan's status
 (eijing is particularly concerned that the
 United States supports Taiwan's continued sep-
 aration from the mainland, as is evidenced by
 political and military support, including arms
 sales to Taiwan. China, for example, has vocif-
 erously decried Theater Missile Defense
 (TMD) for Taiwan, especially because Beijing
 recognizes the political implications of TMD.
 Wang Daohan, former Mayor of Shanghai and
 China's chief ne otiator with Taiwan's repre-
 sentatives, told a         ]delegation that
 TMD "would completely change the strategic
 equation between the United States, China, and
 Taiwan." Similarly, Chinese officials have
 observed that China could handle the military
 challenge of TMD by building more missiles,
 but that TMD would nevertheless weaken the
 deterrent that China's missile threat poses to
 Taiwan's international activities. Other infor-
 mation indicates that China intends to mount an
 all-out diplomatic offensive aga' s t TMD, spe-
 cifically TMD involving Taiwan.
 Despite unfavorable trends, however, Beijing
 does perceive that it has been able to arrest to
 some degree Taiwan's path to independence.
 ? Chinese leaders believe the 1996 missile tests
 discredited the platform of the Democratic
 Progressive Party, which supported an inde-
 pendent Taiwan, and that the numbers of
 those on Taiwan who advocate a declaration
 of de jure independence have declined
 ?CChina sees its military buildup opposite Tai-
 wan as restraining calls for independence on
 the island
 ? (.China has been able to block Taiwan's
 attempts to gain formal international recogni-
 tion. China was heartened by President Clin-
 ton's statement in Shanghai in June 1998 that
 the United States would adhere to "three
 no's" (no support for Taiwan independence,
 no support for one China/one Taiwan, and no
 support for Taiwan representation in interna-
 tional bodies where state membership is
 required) in dealing with Taiwan. China also
 reacted favorably to US statements and diplo-
 matic efforts reaffirming a one-China policy
 after Lee's 9 July statement.
 -[Beijing also is pleased with the expansion of
 trade and investment across the Strait; Chi-
 nese officials believe greater economic inter-
 dependence builds a sympathetic
 constituency for reunification on Taiwan. fl
 (Beijing nevertheless believes its efforts are only
 a holding action. Such efforts have constrained
 Taiwan's freedom of action, but its sense of a
 separate identity grows and its appeals for US
 support persist. And, in this view, time is not on
 China's side. China's power and influence are
 limited, which undermines its ability to achieve
 its objectives. Thus, a challenge for Beijing is
 to come up with a   e effective means of
 reaching its goas 7
 he View From Taipei
 Taiwan's view, as compared to that of China, is
 somewhat more optimistic. Taiwan believes
 that it has healthy security relations with th
 United States and that problems in US-China
 Srret                                     4
 SNP  t
 relations generally work to Taiwan's advantage
 (although Taipei also says that a sharp down-
 turn in US-China relations is not good for Tai-
 wan because that leads Beijing to harden its
 approach to Taiwan). Taiwan also perceives
 that its international standing, even in the
 absence of formal recognition, is relatively
 good
 [Internal Politics
 No Chinese leader can afford to appear to be
 "soft" on the Taiwan question. In the early
 1980s, Deng himself came under criticism for
 suggesting that Taiwan could be put on the
 back burner while China improved relations
 with the United States. In the era of no para-
 mount leader, Chinese officials must be even
 more cautious about any statement that would
 lead to criticism and open the door to attacks
 from political opponents
 still, in Taipei's view, not all trends are favor-
 able. Taiwan relies heavily on the United States
 but perceives that on important issues, the
 United States will side with China against Tai-
 wan's interests. Taiwan also recognizes that
 Beijing has been able to restrict its international
 presence. Taipei knows that it is vulnerable to
 punitive PRC missile attacks and that the long-
 term military balance is unfavorable, with
 much of Beijing's military modernization
 aimed atoreeppanng to deal with Taiwan crisis
 scenarios.
 Key Driversu
 U We assess several key drivers will interact in
 various ways to produce different dynamics in
 cross-Strait relations over the next three years
 but primaril will interact to sustain or increase
 tension
 of the Taiwan issue, there is little divergence
 of opinion on the need for progress toward
 reunification-1
 C On Taiwan, where leaders are democratically
 e ected, there is little support for reunification
 with the PRC. Rather, polls show strong sup-
 port for maintaining Taiwan's current status in
 the face of Chinese pressure. Consequently, any
 leader who pushed hard for reunification proba-
 bly would be defeated in an election. Neverthe-
 less, no leader wants to aggravate Beijing to the
 point that China decides to strike with military
 force. In sum, this key driver is likely to null
 China and Taiwan in opposite directions
 `Desire for Legitimacy and Respect
 Beijing sees itself as an emerging great power
 in and a legitimate member of the international
 system. It is developing its economy, political
 influence, and military capabilities. A perma-
 nent member of the UN Security Council,]
 L China deems it deserves status, respect, and,
 in the case of Taiwan, deference. Perceived
 attempts by Taiwan to separate itself from
 China are seen as causing a "loss of face" for
 China, a threat to China's sovereignty, and a
 possible precedent for other regions of China.
 China's leaders will respond accordingly. For
 example, China insists that Taiwan not enter the
 World Trade Organization before China does.
 Meanwhile, Taiwan has achieved democracy
 and economic prominence and believes it
 is equally entitled to legitimacy in the )
 \nternational community. Taiwan declares that
 it must be treated as an equal by China and that
 it will never consider reunification until China
 democratizes. Leaders in Taipei call attention
 to Beijing's lack of respect for human rights
 while pointing to themselves as responsible
 members of world societp

 Esonai reputations. Both incumbent presi-
 dents have offered proposals for dealing with
 the situation across the Strait. Jiang presented
 an eight point proposal in 1995 and Lee
 responded with a six- oint r    al shortly
 thereafter
 Jiang probably calculates that his legitimacy
 and stature will be best served by making
 progress toward the goal of reunification while
 trying to avoid major conflict. Lee, however,
 sees his legacy as requiring an enhancement of
 Taiwan's status. Both want to avoid war, but
 beyond that their goals are mutually incompati-
 ble. Although Lee will step down as Taiwan's
 president, he will remain head of the ruling
 KMT. KMT candidates probably will be reluc-
 tant to directly challenge Lee's personal legacy;
 furthermore, any Taiwan leader may have diffi-
 culty taking back some of Lee's declarations
 and positions as China has demanded. ^
 Respective Military Priorities
 eijing has been building its military capabili-
 ties for scenarios of conflict on Taiwan. The
 Intelligence Community has assessed that
 Beijing has begun a long-range program to
 develop forces that, in a Taiwan crisis, would
 be able to deter or delay US military forces if
 US intervention seems likely or inflict losses if
 US intervention actually occurs.4 In the
 interim, Beijing will use its military capabilities
 to intimidate Taiwan, which will maintain a
 state of tension across the Strait.
 .Taiwan, meanwhile, with US support, has been
 building its forces to complicate Beijing's plan-
 ning. Taiwan also will conduct modest training,
 NIE 98-05, China's Conventional Military Forces: Curre tt
 Status and Future Capabilities (1998-2008) of June 1998
 ned for political impact that probably will
 contribute to tension.
 Perceptions and Expectations of the
 United States
 US policies are significant to the attitudes of
 both sides. The perceptions and expectations of
 the United States by both China and Taiwan are
 likely to continue to contribute to tension
 across the Strait. Both expend great efforts to
 influence opinion in the United States and are
 seeking advantage in the coming US election.
 China, on one hand, sees Washington as sup-
 porting Taiwan's indefinite separation, includ-
 ing through the supply of arms; on the other
 hand, China believes it can alternatively
 threaten and cajole the United States on the Tai-
 wan issue. Taiwan knows that it has strong sup-
 port in the US Congress and media and that it
 has been effective in exerting influence on the
 United States to provide political and military
 support. Both sides will try to get at each other
 through the United States. For example, Lee
 Teng-hui issued his "state-to-state" comments
 in part because he believed that the low state of
 US-China relations following the bombing of
 the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade offered an
 opportunity
 'Both sides will increase efforts to test the cur-
 rent or a new administration in Washington.
 Taiwan, for example, could press for US legis-
 lation similar to the Taiwan Security Enhance-
 ment Act to strengthen its position vis-a-vis
 Beijing. Beijing could demand additional con-
 cessions by the United States on arms sales.
 S\ret
 Regional Factors
 any PRC officials believe Japan secretly
 plans to expand its influence on Taiwan, and
 Beijing will be wary of Japan's approach to the
 island. Beijing sees Japan's cooperation with
 Washington in the defense guidelines as an ele-
 ment of Tokyo's designs. China repeatedly
 warns that such US-Japan cooperation will pro-
 duce instability in the region.
 Moreover, the situation on the Korean Penin-
 sula will affect cross-Strait relations. North
 Korea's policies are likely to continue to cause
 the United States and Japan to worry about
 instability in the region and heighten defense
 cooperation, including over a regional TMD.
 This situation will heighten China's anxieties
 about the implications for Taiwan
 hina hopes to use Hong Kong as a model of
 success in its "one country, two systems" for-
 mula. Taipei will point to problems in Hong
 Kong as reasons why it should not accept
 Beijing's enticements
 )The Potential for Conflict
 jThe most likely outcome in cross-Strait rela-
 tions over the next three years is a dynamic and
 tense environment. Tension is likely to remain
 high or rise,land rising tension increases the
 chances of military incidents. Also, Beijing
 could posture for large-scale military opera-
 tions in an attempt to intimidate Taiwan.
 [We judge that, over the period of this Estimate,
 chances are better than even that China will
 conduct a major military exercise near Taiwan
 as Beijing did in March 1996. Also, chances
 are better than evenithat there will be small-
 scale incidents between the military forces of
 China and Taiwan. We judge chances are very
 low, however, that Beijing will actually follow
 through with large-scale combat operations,
 such as invading Taiwan or a heavily defended
 offshore island, conducting missile attacks
 against targets on Taiwan, or blockading the
 island with air or naval forces. 7
 hina has the capability to conduct large
 .scale combat operations, but we think the
 chances are very low because Beijing knows
 such operations would not necessarily be suc-
 cessful in achieving its objectives. Such oper-
 ations probably would be counterproductive
 because they would be costly in casualties,
 could destroy Beijing's regional economic
 interests, and could invite third-party
 intervention.-
 pertain circumstances will cause the key driv-
 ers to increase tensions leading to incidents of
 armed clashes short of win
 'Shifts in Internal Politics. To counter domestic
 instability in China, especially if caused by
 economic deterioration, Beijing could provoke
 a wave of nationalism leading to an even harder
 line toward Taiwan. Or, in the case of Taiwan,
 friction among rival political parties could
 cause a leader to calculate that he can gain pop-
 ular support by emphasizing Taiwan's separate
 status.

 Escalating the Desire for Legitimacy and
 Respect. Following the reversion of Macao,
 China could decide to press more vigorously on
 Taiwan by tightening the diplomatic noose.
 China could warn small countries that have
 relations with Taiwan that they will suffer con-
 sequences in the future, such as loss of trade or
 political retribution in the UN. Or, Taiwan

 toward de jure independence.
 Regional Problems. Several situations would
 exacerbate tensions across the Strait, includin
 deterioration on the Korean Peninsula
 or a decision by
 Japan to upgrade ties to Taiwan.
 Beijing's Options
 In tense cross-Strait relations, Beijing has sev-
 eral options
 many of which would be
 worrisome for the United States:
 ? Exercise Restraint. Military measures range
 rom returning to normal military deploy-
 ments along the Strait to conducting small-
 scale Taiwan-focused exercises on the Strait.
 Diplomatic activity would range from toning
 down rhetoric against Taiwan's leaders and
 maintaining longstanding efforts to limit
 Taiwan's international activity. Economic
 measures would include encouraging Taiwan
 to negotiate the "three-links."
 1
 kcret
 `Red Lines"
 China has established certain "red lines,"
 tat if Taiwan crosses, will cause a signifi-
 cant change in policy from peaceful reuni-
 fication to use of force. These red lines are
 general in nature and Beijing's use of
 force is likely to vary depending upon the
 situation. Amo g the "red lines" cited by
 Beijing include:
 ?~A4 Taiwan formal declaration of indepen-
 dence, or Taiwan's holding a referendum
 or modifying its Constitution to establish
 independence.

 WWe believe that at some point Chinese
 leaders would perceive Taiwan participa-
 tion in a US-sponsored TMD program as
 `foreign intervention in China's internal
 affairs." This could become a "red line"
 issue that would elicit a military reaction,
 *Rattle its Saber. Military measures would
 range from large-scale force deployments
 opposite Taiwan to deploying an out-of-area
 ground, airborne force to Fujian province
 (adjacent to Taiwan). Diplomatic measures
 would range from canceling talks between

 need for a reunification timetable. Economic
 measures range from warning other countries

 china could attempt to blockade or invade Tai-
 wan, which Beijing recognizes would risk war
 with the United States. In our judgment, such a
 war is highly unlikely during the period of this
 Estimate because of the reasons stated above.
 n
 Factors That Could Ease Tensions
 Although less likely in our view, several drivers
 could interact to bring about an amelioration of
 tensions across the StraiiTT
 Economic Interaction
 economic interaction between China and
 Taiwan has been impressive (see chart, page
 22). According to Chinese statistics, total trade
 has grown to $20 billion annually. More than
 14~0,000 Taiwan businessmen have invested in
 the mainland, amounting to about 20 percent of
 outside investment. Taiwan data indicate that
 the PRC is Taiwan's third-largest trading part-
 ner and 42 percent of Taiwan's overseas invest-
 ment is in China.L i
 China sees the investment not only as important
 or developing its economy but also for facili-
 tating integration between the two entities and
 building a constituency for reunification on the
 island. Taiwan's view is more mixed. Taiwan
 officials stated that, if the PRC share of total
 Taiwan overseas investment rises above 60 per-
 cent, the PRC would use this dependence to
 squeeze Taiwan at the negotiating table. At the
 same time, many Taiwan officials see the
 island's prosperity resting heavily on cl  r
 economic interchange with the mainland.
 Although we recognize the possibility of eco-
 nomic friction, on balance we judge economic
 factors will be a force for moderation. Taiwan
 will continue to place restrictions on cross-
 Strait economic flows, but Taiwan businesses
 probably will continue to channel money indi-
 rectly to the mainland through offshore banks.
 Meanwhile, China will try to pro  to reater
 trade and investment from Taiwan
 Shifts in Other Key Drivers
 We assess changes could occur in other key
 drivers that would move China and Taiwan
 toward greater accommodation
 Following Taiwan's presidential election in
 arch 2000, domestic politics on both sides
 could shift. A new Taiwan leader could soften
 Taiwan's approach by agreeing to negotiate
 the three links. Beijing could calculate that a

 after line toward Taiwan was in its interests.
 Leaders on both sides could conclude that
 resuming ARATS-SEF contacts would
 improve communications, confidence, and
 predictability between China and Taiwan.
 Although we think it unlikely, leaders could
 hold secret talks, or, even less likely, agree to
 a summit meeting to try to ease tensions.
 ? 'e two sides could conclude that economic
 interest warrant a reduction of military
 tensions
 ?Ereater stability in US-China relations could
 improve cross-Strait ties as well. Beijing's
 fear that Washington was secretly fostering_
 an independent Taiwan probably would ease.
 J,,.On balance, we assess that the key drivers are
 more likely to combine to sustain and exacer-
 bate a tense atmosphere across the Strait.
 Important constraints-notably US and inter-
 national support for regional stability-will act
 against a major conflict, but provocative tactics
 and greater use of military signaling will
 heighten the prospects for accidental or inten-
 tional armed clasheJLI
 We doubt that the PRC has set a deadline for
 achieving reunification. Nor has it devised a
 timetable with specific accomplishments along
 the way. Nevertheless, a variety of reporting
 indicates that Beijing has become more anxious
 about achievin concrete progress toward
 reunification
 We, assess that Beijing's sense of urgency will
 be influenced by China's broader strategic per-
 ception of how well it is faring in other key
 objectives. Economic growth, greater stability
 in US-China relations, international reputation,
 and political stability are of importance to
 China's leaders, and progress on Taiwan will be
 viewed in this context. Chinese gains in these
 other areas may cause Beijing to decide that it
 has more time to deal with the Taiwan issue.
 Taiwan has no timeline, but intends to preserve
 its options. Nevertheless, the Presidential elec-
 tion next year could produce a departure from
 Taiwan's present approach. Although Lee's
 preferred successor, Vice President Lien Chan,
 is unlikely to deviate significantly from Tai-
 wan's present course, other potential succes-
 sors, notably former Taiwan governor James
 Soong, have raised other options. Soong, for
 example, reportedly has discussed the possibil-
 ity of moving more directly to negotiate with
 China on the three links
 What if We Are Wrong?
 Our overall view is based on two assumptions:
 no fundamental political upheaval in China or
 Taiwan and no change in US global superpower
 status or alliance structure in the region. Major
 political upheaval in China is the more proba-
 ble of the assumptions to come under chal-
 lenge. Although highly unlikely, China's
 twentieth century history suggests significant
 political change cannot be ruled out. Over the
 next three years, serious economic problems,
 combined with a leadership succession crisis in
 Beijing, could lead to a popular uprising or a
 change in regime. A new, more nationalistic
 regime could define Taiwan's liberation a , the
 cornerstone of its legitimacy. Such a regime
 et
 Outlook Beyond Three Yearr
 'he dynamic situation across the Strait over
 the next three years, including presidential
 change in Taiwan, China, and the United
 States, precludes effective estimating about
 likely outcomes beyond this time frame. Nev-
 ertheless, the Intelligence Community agrees
 that some of the trends discussed in this Esti-
 mate are likely to persist well beyond
 three years covered by his Estimat
 r_
 Such factors as nationalism, demographics,
 face, and the personalities of leaders will
 continue to influence developments across
 the Strait, as will the perceptions of both
 sides that they are entitled to international
 recognition and suppor~t.
 j We agree that economic links will continue
 well beyond three years. We note that even
 during past periods of crisis these links have
 not diminished. We are uncertain that such
 almost certainly would increase the pressure to
 resolve the Taiwan situation. Alternatively, a
 more democratic government in China could
 adopt a more accommodating approach to Tai-
 wan. n
 Political radicalism in Taiwan leading to a for-
 mal declaration of independence or, less likely,
 a decision to reunify with China also are plausi-
 ble. In either event, the US reaction would be
 critical. Such countries as South Korea and
 Japan would measure the US response in
 assessing the stren th of their alliances with the
 f their alliances with the
 United State
 s
 Sep et
 Cb-aks would lea   political integration in
 greater China. dl
 LWe think China's power in the region will
 grow, but the power of others in the region
 including Taiwan, probably also will grow.
 ',,Although we believe unification between
 China and Taiwan is not likely over the next
 ten years, we think the possibility of progress
 on China's request for three links is good
 and perhaps some progress on CBMs,
 including military CBMs across the Strait, as
 well. All of these can be achieved, however,
 without concrete progress toward political
 unity. The main issue, in our view, will be
 whether Chinese nationalism or Taiwan
 assertiveness and manipulation leads to con-
 frontation, or whether enlightened states-
 manship on both sides decides to ca talize
 on the benefits of peace and stability (n
 Disruption of the US alliance structure could
 occur if the Korean peninsula was suddenly
 reunified. A reunified Korea would involve
 complex interaction between the United States
 and China, as well as Japan, that would influ-
 ence developments with respect to Taiwan.
 Similarly, situations that undermined the
 US-Japan security relationship could affect Tai-
 wan's security. For example, Japan, concluding
 the United States is withdrawing militarily
 from Asia, could decide to create an indepen-
 dent nuclear arsenal. Such a decision almost
 Certainly would bring about an unfavorable
 Chinese reaction, perhaps including increased
 military pressure on Taiwan. Though highly
 unlikely, such developments almost certainly
 would cause both China and Taiwan to reevalu-
 ate their ties to the United States.
