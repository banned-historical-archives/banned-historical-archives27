 PRC  IN  UNITED NATIONS
 Peking's initial reaction to the 25 October UN vote on the seating
 of the PRC came on the 26th in a speech by Acting Foreign Minister
 Chi Peng-fei, who on the same day had seen off Henry Kissinger at
 the conclusion of the latter's six-day visit.         That the Chinese
 were willing to keep the UN representation issue separate from the
 plans for President Nixon's visit seemed indicated by the timing
 of the second Kissinger visit and by Peking's failure to link the
 U.S. position on the UN question with Sino-U.S. relations generally.
 Initial PRC comment has viewed the UN vote as a "significant
 victory" in foiling U.S. efforts to bring about dual Chinese
 representation in Lne world body.  Peking has not taken the
 occasion to assess Washington's China policy in a broader context.
 in the only reference to President Nixon, a 26 October NCNA report
 cited the Western press as saying that the President personally
 wrote to many heads of state in behalf of "the 'two-Chinas' scheme."
 Peking's -action to the vote was foreshadowed in earlier authori-
 tative comment stressing firm opposition to any dual representation
 formula.  A foreign ministry statement on 20 August and a PEOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator article on 25 September, declaring categorically
 that the PRC would have nothing to do with the United Nations
 unless Chiang Kai-shek's representatives were expelled, were
 confined to the narrow issue of UN representation.  The Commentator
 article claimed that the U.S. resolutions aimed at dual representa-
 tion reflected persisting U.S. hostility toward the Chinese, but
 no implications were drawn for Sino-U.S. relations.  Similarly,
 comment on the vote has avoided broader issues involving the two
 countries and has pulled its polemical punches directed at the
 Nixon Administration.  In contrast, a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 on the vote lashed Japan's "reactiu.L.3ry Sato government" for
 baring "its ugly features in remaining stubbornly hostile
 towards the Chinese people."
 PEKING SEES VOTE AS VICTORY OVER U.S.  'n'.0-CHINAS SCHEME"
 The first monitored PRC reaction to the 25 October General Assembly
 vote appeared in an NCNA dispatch on the 26th singling out comment
 on the vote made by Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei at an
 Iranian embassy reception.  Chi hailed the favorable vote as a
 "victory of the people of the whole world" and a demonstration of
 the "bankruptcy" of the policy long pursued by "U.S. imperialism."

 28 OCTOBER 1971
 According to the NCNA account. Chi said the Chinese government
 and people were grateful to Al:lania, Algeria, and the other 21
 nations which had sponsored the resolution restoring the PRC's
 rights in the United Nationb, to those countries which have
 diplomatic relations with the PRC, and to "other friendly
 countries" which have "upheld justice."  The NCNA account of
 the reception did not include Chi's remarks to correspondents--
 reported in the Western press on the 27th--that the PRC was
 giving consideration to the question of when it would take its
 seat in the United Nations.
 Following NCNA's brief report of Chi's remarks, the first
 substantial comment came in a lengthy, heavily editorialized
 NCNA dispatch dated the 26th and carried in both domestic and
 international services.  On the 28th a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial
 discussed the Assembly vote,* echoing Chi and the NCNA dispatch
 in calling the outcome a victory for the people of the world
 and a demonstration of the bankruptcy of U.S. policy.
 Both the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial and NCNA were critical of the
 United States and the "Sato government" for engaging in "tricks"
 to gain support in the Assembly for a two-Chinas "scheme," with
 NCNA derisively observing that U.S. and Japanese representatives
 during the week-long debate "were running hither and thither,
 just like ants on a hot pan, to exert pressure and to deceive
 and woo" other delegations.  The NCNA dispatch cited Western
 press reports as saying that President Nixon personally wrote
 to the heads of many states, that Secretary Rogers and Ambassador
 Bush "rustled" around with promises of U.S. favors or hints of
 withdrawal of U.S. aid, and that U.S. senators had  threatened
 that Washington would reduce its funds to the world body if the
 Albanian resolution were adopted.  Japan also dispatched "important
 personages to join its UN delegation and coordinated with the
 United States in its vote-seeking effort," according to NCNA,
 The NCNA dispatch--which noted that the final vote was welcomed
 with "cheers" and "prolonged warm applause"--drew on U.S. news
 reports for the statements that the Administration was "caught
 *  In the three previous years, Peking's comment on the voting
 on the representation issue had been conveyed in heavily
 editorialized NCNA dispatches.  The 1967 vote occasioned a
 PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, and the votes in 1965 and
 1966 were discussed In PEOPLE'S DAILY editorials.

 by surprise" and "expressed strong disappointment."  And like
 the PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial, NCNA said that the U.S. press has
 called the vote the "worst U.S. defeat in UN history."  NCNA
 added that Ambassador Bush, in a statement after the vote, said
 "despondently that this is a 'moment of infamy,"' at the same
 time admitting that the votes which have been cast "represent
 the views of the majority of UN members."
 On the 27th NCNA transmitted the text of the Albanian resolution,
 listing the 76 nations which voted for it while singling out only
 the United States and Japan among the 35 that voted against it.
 The same NCNA transmission listed the 59 states voting against
 the "important question" resolution "concocted by the United
 States in collusion with the Sato government of Japan."
 OTHER COMMUNIST    Moscow has welcomed the outcome of the
 COMMENT            25 October vote in a moderate volume of
 comment calling it a step toward realism, at
 the same time assailing Washington's "arm-twisting" methods and
 pointing to consistent Soviet support over the years for seating
 the PRC in the United Nations.  The most authoritative commentary
 to date is a PRAVDA article on the 28th by Viktor Sokolov, which
 said   tat the seating of the PRC and expulsion of the Chiang
 Kai-shek representatives  .ie "linked with the hope that the
 United Nations will be more effectively carrying into life the
 principles of its charter."  The article replayed the pervasive
 theme that the USSR has consistently pressed for restoration of
 the PRC's rights in the organ.'zation, "whatever the state of
 relations with the Chinese leadership."  A foreign-language radio
 commentary by Yuriy Soltan on the 26th had paraphrased, without
 attribution, Soviet Ambassador Malik's remarks during the debate
 to the effect that the Soviet Union supported the seating of
 the PRC even though Soviet relations with the Chinese leadership
 have at times assumed "a sharply ideological and political character."
 A substantial body of comment by Moscow's East European allies has
 also stressed the bloc's long-standing support of Peking's seating
 and assails the U.S. maneuvers on the representation issue.  Some
 of the comment has gone beyond Moscow's in pointing up the new
 responsibility now resting on Peking.  Thus an article in Warsaw's
 TRYBUNA LUDU on the 27th expressed hope that the PRC representatives
 will join with the socialist and other peace-loving states in
 solving complicated international problems.  It should be expected
 that Chinese diplomacy will bring a constructive cor"r.ibution to
 the world body, the article sa-td, adding that it is further hoped
 that Peking will cooperate in the checking of the arms race, in the
 discontinuation of nuclear tests, and in the nonproliferation of

 Similar East German comment has also predictably taken the
 occasion to call for admission to the United Nations of those
 states which are being kept out due to the policy of "discrimina--
 tion" pursued by the United States.
 Bucharest's press and radio have hailed the vote as an expression
 of justice and political r?al:.sm, and a congratulatory message
 on the 26th from Ceausescu and Maurer to Mao Tse-tung and
 Chou En-lai cites the vote as supporting the Romanian line that
 a lasting solution of major international problems cannot be
 conceived without the participation of the PRC.  In addition
 to the Romanians, the Albanian a.td North Korean leaderships,
 Yugoslav Premier Bijedic, and Polish Premier Jaroszewicz have
 sent congratulatory messages to their Chinese counterparts.
 Lin Piao was not an addressee of any of these messages.
 The DRV's first reactiL_L came in a Hanoi domestic sexgice
 broadcast on the 28th which said public opinion in many
 countries regards the vote as a victory for the PRC and the
 peace-loving peoples of the world and "a disastrous setback
 for the U.S. imperialists."  Citing AFP, the broadcast noted
 that Secretary Rogers in his 26 October press conference had
 declared that the expulsion of the RCC from the world body
 would not affect U.S. relations with the Chiang Kai-shek
 regime.  No DRV congratulatory message has been monitored as
 of this writing.

 SING - U, S.  RELATIONS
 PEKING SAYS NIXON VISIT ARRANGEMENTS "ARE PROCEEDING WELL"
 Conveying a sense of momentum in Sino-U.S. developments in
 the wake of the second Kissinger mission from 20 to 26 October,
 Peking announced on 28 October (afternoon of the 27th Washington
 time) that arrangements for President Nixon's visit "are proceed-
 ing well" and that another announcement is expected "in the near
 future."  Unlike reports on the Kissinger delegation's arrival
 on the 20th, which were carried in the middle of Peking newcasts,
 the 28 October announcement was broadcast as the 1c=.ad item by
 the domestic radio.
 While predictably avoiding direct comment on the President's
 projected visit, Peking reported the second Kissinger mission
 in such a way as to signal that ongoing Sino-U.S. developments
 are not affected by the current internal anomalies in China.
 NCNA dispatches on 20 October, disseminated in both domestic
 and international services, reported Kissinger's arrival that
 day--to make "concrete arrangements"  for the President's visit--
 and his talks with Chou En-lai followed by a banquet on the same
 day "to entertain Dr. Kissinger and his party."  To bring the
 point even further home to the Chinese people, and perhaps to
 recalc:.trant elements in the leadership, PEOPLE'S DAILY on the
 21st carried two photographs of the U.S. delegation with Chou
 and other Chinese leaders.
 In addition to t1e premier, the Chinese officials at the
 announced talks on the 20th included Politburo member Yeh Chien-
 ying, vice chairman of the party's Military Affairs Committee,
 and Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei.  Yeh, the ranking
 military leader currently appearing in public, and CH'_ met
 the Americans at the airport on their arrival and saw them off
 on the ?6th.
 In addition to the 28 October announcement, there were three
 Peking reports on the visit, covering the arrival, the talks
 and banquet on the 2Uth, and the departure.  Apart from noting
 that the delegation came to the PRC to make arrangements for
 President Nixon's visit, there was no characterization of the
 atmosphere or the substance of the talks.  Though there were no
 other specifications of when talks were held, the departure
 announcement noted that during "intervals between the talks"

 the delegation "visited various pla.-.es" and attended a theatrical
 performance in Peking.  Chou was not reported as making any other
 appearanrpa during the period of the delegation's stay.*
 SINO-SOVIET-U.S.      The Chinese may have been pleased with the
 TRIANGLE              timing of the Kissinger delegation's arrival
 coincident with the second anniversary--
 unmarked by either Peking or Moscow--of the opening of the Sino-
 Soviet border t  ks.  In the course of the movement toward Sino-
 American negotiations, Peking has exhibited an awareness of the
 uses of this development for its position in the triangular
 relationship.  This was reflected, for example, two months after
 the Sino-Soviet talks had opened at a time when both sides were
 leaking reports of difficulties in Vie border negotiations.
 Peking's announcement on 14 Decembe_ 1969 of the chief Soviet
 negotiator's departure for home--an announcement contrived to
 put pressure on Moscow to return the negotiator soon--was
 pointedly juxtaposed in the same NCNA international service
 transmission with a belated report (three days after the fact)
 of a meeting in Warsaw between the U.S. and PRC diplomatic
 representatives.  That meeting led to the resumption, after a
 lengthy hiatus, of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks running
 parallel with the protracted Sino-Soviet border talks.
 The Warsaw talks were suspended after the U.S. incursion into
 Cambodia in the spring of 1970, but there was new movement
 in Sino-U.S. relations following the Lam Son 719 operation
 in southern Laos in February-March this year and the emergence
 of what Peking began. calling an "unprecedentedly fine situation"
 in Indochina.  After a series of developments ranging from the
 visit of American table tennis players to the PRC in April to
 the July announcement of President Nixon's forthcoming trip,
 Peking presented an analysis of its strategy as requiring maximum
 flexibility in distinguishing among its adversaries in order to
 isolate "the main enemy."  By implication, Peking identified
 the Soviet Union as its principal antagonist and Justified its
 dealings with the United States on the basis of changes in U.S.
 *  Chou appeared at an Iranian embassy reception on the evening
 of the 26th at which Chi Peng-fei offered Peking's initial comment
 on the UN vote.  NCNA reported on the 27th that Chou had "a
 friendly talk w~'.th American friendly personage John S. Service"
 that day.

 policy that offered a counterbalance to the Soviets.*  Thus
 Peking may have hoped that Moscow read the American delegation's
 arrival date as a reminder of the triangular facts of interna-
 tional life.
 SOVIET BLOC     Moscow followed the Kissinger visit with brief
 COMMENT         reports of the announced activities, but there
 has been no comment in the central media.  A
 Radio Most w broadcast to China on 26 October, discussing the
 previous day's UN vote on seating the PRC, took note of Sino-
 U.S. developments in accusing Washington of hypocrisy in its
 China policy as evidenced by its efforts to develop contacts
 with Peking while maintaining its relationship with the Nation-
 alist Chinese regime.  The day before Kissinger arrived in
 Peking, a broadcast to the Chinese contrasted what it portrayed
 as significant Soviet support for the PRC and Washington's
 hostility from the time that the PRC was founded.  The broad-
 cast contained a rare reference to the moribund Sino-Soviet
 treaty of alliance, noting that economic and other support
 provided by the Soviets in line with the treaty enabled the
 PRC to overcome the Western economic blockade.
 In a notable allusion by a top Soviet leader to Sino-U.S.
 developments, Brezhnev took the occasion of a speech in Paris
 on the 27th to warn against attempts to impose a Vietnam settle-
 ment "by way of secret combinations behind the Vietnamese
 people's back."** Current Soviet comment has not spelled out
 implications of Sino-U.S. relations for third parties, but some
 East European comment has expressed misgivings over the effects
 of these developments.  A 25 October commentary in Prague's
 RUDE PRAVO on the second Kissinger missicn explained that the
 "anti-imperialist forces" view these developments with disquiet
 because Washington undertook normalization of relations with the
 PRC out of consideration of the "schismatic and anti-Soviet
 orientation" of Peking policy.  Nothing has changed in that
 respect, "as Kissinger has seen for himself with satisfaction,"
 the commentary concluded.

 An article on 20 October in a minor Polish paper, DZIENNIK
 LUDOWY, a peasant organ, linked the anniversary of the opening
 of the Sino-Soviet border talks, the Kissinger mission, and
 Indochina in musing over the past two years' developments in
 Sino-Soviet re.ations.  After discussing Sino-Soviet develop-
 ments, the article took note of Kissinger's arrival in Peking
 that day, an event "which gives one food for thought."
 Specifically, the article suggested the thought--which "must
 be uppermost in the minds of the Indochinese people"--of how
 more advantageous would be the position of the communist states
 vis-a-vis the imperialists if the Sino-Soviet talks :.ad pro-

 INDOCHINA
 In the wake of the 24-28 September visit of Li Hsien-nien's
 Chinese economic delegation and the 3-8 October visit of
 Soviet President Podgornyy. DRV leaders are currently playing
 host to a North Korean party-government delegation led by
 Politburo member and Vice Premier Pak Song-chol.  References
 to DRV-DPRK solidarity and friendship pervade the propaganda,
 with no overt manifestation of their diametrically opposed
 reactions to Peking's invitation to President Nixcn--welcomed
 by Kim Il-song on 6 August as a "great victory" for the Chinese
 people and world revolutionary forces, at the time Hanoi in its
 vitriolic polemic was implying that the PRC had departed from
 a proletarian internationalist path.
 Soviet party chief Brezhnev at a Paris dinner for President
 Pompidou on 27 October made a thinly veiled allusion to possible
 Sino-U.S. collusion on Indochina when he warned that the problem
 cannot be solved "either by attempts to impose an alien will on
 Vietnam by means of force or by way of secret combinations behind
 the backs of the Vietnamese people."  Brezhnev again pledged
 Soviet support so long as the Indochinese struggle continues.
 And Moscow broadcasts continue to cir.e President Podgornyy's
 visit to Hanoi, during which the annual Soviet-DRV aid
 agreements were signed, as testimony of the UOSR's unabated
 loyalty to the DRV and the national liberation movement.
 U.S. failure to respond positively to the PRG's 1 July proposal
 and to totally withdraw from South Vietnam continues to be
 scored by the Vietnamese comiunist delegates at Paris as well
 as in routine propaganda   And a Hanoi radio talk characterizes
 the President's remarks on ending the war, in his 24 October
 radio talk marking Veterans Day, as "flowery words" aimed at
 deceiving American and world opinion.
 NORTH KOREAN PARTY-GOVERNMENT DELEGATION WELCOMED IN HANOI
 Pyongyang media gave no advance notice concerning the visit to
 the DRV of a party-government delegation.  On 24 October, the
 day of the delegation's departure, KCNA reported that in response
 to the invitation of the C+-ntral Committee of the VWP and the DRV
 Government, a six-man party-government delegation headed by Pak
 Song-chol, Politburo member and second vice premier, departed
 Pyongyang for a "friendship visit to the DRV."

 NCNA reported the dame day that the delegation briefly stopped
 at the Peking airport, where they were met by Politburo member
 Li Hsien-nien who hosted lunch.  Later on the 24th the delegation
 was welcomed at the Hanoi airport by a Vietnamese delegation
 headed by Nguyen Duy Trinh, Politburo member and Foreign Affairs
 Minister.  An evening banquet featured speeches by Trinh and Pak
 with Premier Pham Van Dong in attendance.
 Premier Dong participated in official talks with the delegation
 on Lhe 25th and 26th.  VNA portrayed the talks as having proceeded
 "in an atmosphere of sincerity, militant solidarity, and fraternal
 friendship."  A "grand meeting" to welcome the DPRK delegation
 was held by the "Hanoi population" on 25 Jctober at a local
 meeting hall. Trinh, who headed the Vietnamese turnout,
 stressed the theme that "Vietnam and Korea share the same
 plight of temporary division of the country, are facing up to
 the same enemy--the U.S. imperialist aggressors--and share the
 same ideal of socialism and communism."  Activities of the DPRK
 delegation on the 26th included attendance at an art performance
 hosted by the culture ministry, wreath-laying ceremonies at the
 Hanoi monument to war dead, and a visit to Ho Chi Minh's home.
 PROLETARIAN           Foreign Minister Trinh in his banquet speech
 INTERNATIONALISM      on the 24th presented an optimistic picture
 of relations with the DPRK and other members
 of the socialist world.  He referred to the fruitful development
 of Vietnamese-Korean friendship on the basis of Marxism-Leninism
 and proletarian internationalism, suggested a toast to the
 "solidarity" of the socialist countries and the international
 communist and workers movement on this basis, and carefully
 specified both the Soviet Union and China in referring to support
 from the socialist countries.  These are orthodox, standard
 formulations and are ccnsistent with Hanoi propaganda during the
 Podgornyy visit.  They are noteworthy only against the bacLground
 of Hanoi's July-August implications that Peking, in extending the
 invitation to the President, was departing from a proletarian
 internationalist path.  Even after Hanoi ceased its anti-Chinese
 polemic at the end of August, it remained reluctant to describe
 Sino-U.S. relations as based on proletarian internationalism--a
 reluctance dramatically demonstrated during Li Hsien-nieti's late-
 September visit.  While Hanoi must have been irked by Kim I1-song's
 endorsement of Peking's invitation to President Nixon,* its current
 propaganda now presents a DPRK-DRV relationship of "militant
 solidarity" and "warm" friendship.

 Pak Song-chol in his speech at the banquet referred to Korean
 "loyalty" to proletarian internationalism in a passage in which
 he said that the Korean people regard the struggle of the
 Vietnamese people as an encouragement to their own revolutionary
 cause and "will continue doing their utmost to give moral and
 material assistance to the fraternal Vietnamese people until
 their final victory."  Pak followed this assertion with a
 repetition of the line on Asian unity promulgated by Peking
 and Pyongyang which implicitly excludes the Soviet Union.  He
 reiterated that U.S. imperialism will be driven out of the
 countries of Asia in the face of the "Joint fight of the Korean
 peopl3, the Vietnamese people, the Lao people, the Cambodian
 people, and the Chinese people."  Speaking at the Hanoi meeting
 the next day, he similarly referred to Asian unity, and in
 another passage promised continued "active aid" to the
 Vietnamese people.
 Some seeming inconsistencies in Hanoi's line on Chinese adherence
 to proletarian internationalism have come to light in recent
 propaganda.  After having studiously avoided references to the
 concept during Li Hsien-nien's visit, DRV leaders did refero
 proletarian internationalism in their congratulatory message
 marking the 1 October PRC National Day.*  However, they dropped
 the declaration contained in the 1970 anniversary message that
 mutual friendship between the two peoples had been "unceasingly
 consolidated and developed" on this basis.  As reported by NCNA,
 a Vietnamese official of the friendship association at a
 29 September meeting said that the Vietnamese "are determined
 to do their utmost to nurture the fraternal friendship and
 militant solidarity between our two peoples based on Marxism-
 Leninism and proletarian internationalism. .                               . ."  Hanoi media
 failed to publicize this statement, but the omission seems less
 significant in light of a similar pledge in an article on DRV
 diplomacy by Foreign Minister Trinh in the October issue of the
 party journal HOC TAP.  Trinh said:  "We will strive to strengthen
 our militant solidarity and friendly relations with the brother
 socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, on
 the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

 BREZI-INEV IN FRANCE WARNS OF INTRIGUES AGAINST THE VIETNAMESE
 Moscow's restrained treatment of the United States in the wake
 of the announcement of the President's forthcoming visit to the
 Soviet Union appeared to have been reflected in Brezhnev's speech
 at a dinner given by President Pompidou on the 25th.  Avoiding
 criticism of U.S. foreign policy, the Soviet party chief remarked
 that his visit to France was taking place "in a complex situation"
 and added mildly that "the war in Indochina is continuing and
 the Middle East crisis is still unsettled."
 But Brezhnev showed no such restraint in a speech on the 27th
 that he hosted for Pompidou.  He called U.S. "aggression" in
 Indochina one of the most serious obstacles to peace, and said
 that the way to settle the conflict is "to end fozeign
 interference" in that part of the world.  And, in the first
 such statement by a top Soviet leader, he went on to declare:
 "This problem cannot be solved either by attempts to impose
 an alien will on Vietnam by means of force, or by way of
 secret combinations behind the Vietnamese people's back."
 As would be expected in the circumstances, he mentioned
 neither the United States nor China by name.  Gromyko in his
 28 September UNGA speech explicitly d'scussed Sine-U.S.
 relations and went on to raise the specter of "combinations"
 of states directed against others in a general context without
 mentioning Vietnam.*  Brezhnev's remarks seem particularly
 notable coming against the background of Kissinger's return
 from his second trip to Peking as well as the UN vote on the
 seating of the PRC--developments which dramatize the PRC's
 expanding role in world affairs.
 In his brief statement on the "correct" way to settle the
 Indochinese question, Brezhnev said nothing about the PRG's
 1 July seven-point proposal.  Authoritative Moscow press
 reaction in July and August to the announcement of the
 President's Peking visit had charged that it eased pressure
 on Washington to respond to the 1 July peace proposal.**
 *  This passage was included in extracts of Gromyko's speech
 distributed by TASS but it was excised from the version of the
 speech published in the central press.  See the TRENDS of
 6 October, page 41.
 ** Moscow had endorsed the PRG proposal in a PRAVDA editorial
 on 5 July--the day after PEOPLE'S DAILY's editorial endorsement.
 Both Gromyko in his UNGA speech and Podgornyy in a 3 October
 speech in Hanoi criticized U.S. failure to respond to the proposal.

 DRV DEPRECATES PRESIDENTS RADIO TAU(. HAILS ANTIWAR FORCES
 At this writing Vietnamese communist media have not publicized
 antiwar demonstrations in Washington marking the Veterans Day
 weekend.  But VNA on 27 October did report what it described
 as a "recent" message from Hoang Minh Giam, chairman of the
 Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American People,
 hailing the "fall offensive."
 President Nixon's 24 October radio talk marking the Veterans Day
 holiday prompts a Hanoi domestic service broadcast on the 26th
 which ridicules the President's remarks that the United States is
 ending the war and proceeding toward preventing the outbreak of
 others, and that there is now a greater chance to make the present
 U.S. Vietnam veterans the last war veterans.  Hanoi observes that
 the President "hoped that his flowery words" would deceive
 American and world opinion.  And it goes on to counter his
 assertion that the war is ending by describing continued U.S.
 bombing and other military action throughout Indochina.  The
 broadcast does not specify the various steps spelled out by
 the President which he said moved toward peace, and it of
 couzse ignores his remarks that hi3 trips to Moscow and Peking
 are directed toward that end.
 Hanoi also takes issue with the President's contention that the
 antiwar movement opposes U.S. servicemen and veterans.  It says
 that he "brazenly distorted the truth about the American
 people's antiwar movement" which in fact, it adds, has "gained
 the sympathy of many servicemen and veterans."  The radio
 claims that "heedless of Nixon's boastful arguments," the
 people are "actively making preparations for the fall struggle
 movement" to demand an end to the war and repatriation of all
 U.S.  troops.
 The Hoang Minh Giam message on the fall offensive--a routine
 propaganda exercise at times of U.S. antiwar campaigns--says
 that after the impetus of the spring antiwar activities, the
 "ongoing fall offensive has destroyed the myth created by the
 American warlike circles that the peace movement is dying."
 The message, carried by VNA on the 27th, claims that the antiwar
 struggle underlines the fact that the American people "will not
 be deceived by any political lie," that they will "have the last
 word to achieve their demands and will remove all those who go
 counter to their tradition of peace and justice."  Giam also
 routinely called on the U.S. Administration to respond to the
 PRG's seven-point peace proposal.

 PARIS TALKS:  COMMUNIST MEDIA CONTINUE CURSORY ATTENTTON
 Vietnamese communist media's attention to the Paris talks is
 confined to the cryptic LPA and VNA accounts of the sessions.
 Consistent with recent practice, the VNA accoun.. of the
 21 October session dismisses Ambassador Porter's statement
 in a single sentence, saying that he "continued to maintain
 his aggressive and colonialist stand."  And VNA totally
 ignores the GVN statement.
 PRG delegate Nguyen Van Tien's statement is again replete with
 criticism of Ambassador Porter, but the VNA account omits or
 softens many of his remarks.  Tien repeateuly criticized
 Porter "for over the past five sessions rehashing the shop-
 worn allegations of his predecessors, distorting facts and
 making black white."  VNA notes that Tieu denounced the U.S.
 delegate for trying "by hook or crook to prettify" President
 Thieu and the recent election.  But it ignores Tien's charge
 that Porter "even wants to negate the South Vietnamese
 people's great resistance to U.S. aggression, led by the NFLSV
 and the PRG"--an obvious reference to the Ambassador's assertions
 that the NFLSV has little real influence in South Vietnam
 militarily or politically.  VNA also ignores DRV delegate
 Nguyen Minh Vy's question to Porter asking "how he can deny
 that at this conference table he has been resorting to the
 arguments of a colonialist aggressor to continue to hinder
 the work of the conference."
 Vy's statement consisted largely of charges of "fresh U.S. war
 acts" against the Indochinese countries, and he described the
 upcoming trip to South Vietnam by Defense Secretary Laird,
 Admiral Moorer and General Westmoreland as evidence that the
 Nixon Administration "is scheming to take new military
 adventures."

 ministry spokesman protests on 9 and 16 October.  The current
 protest also says that on the 18th and 19th U.S. aircraft
 "bombed populated areas" in Tuyen Hoa and Minh Hoa districts,
 Quang Binh Province.
 The charges voiced in the foreign ministry spokesman's protest
 are echoed in a 23 October Hanoi radio commentary.  It is unclear
 why this particular protest prompted comment when none followed
 the four previous similar protests in the past month.  The
 commentary recalls the intensive 21 September raids--which had
 been protested at the higher level of a DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement on the 22d--calling them a "typical case" of repeated
 U.S. "crimes" against the people of Vinh Linh and Quang Binh.
 It also recalls that the Administration used the "extremely
 overbearing and odious allegation" of self-defense reaction
 to justify those acts.

 MOSCOW REGISTERS CONCERN OVER INDO-PAKISTANI SITUATION
 In the month since Prime Minister Gandhi's 27-29 September state
 visit to the Soviet Union,* Soviet media's treatmet   of events
 in the Indian subcontinent has evolved from an outpouring of
 Soviet public sentiment in support of the refugees streaming
 into India, underscoring sympathy with India's position, to
 expressions of unconcealed concern that the Indian-Pakistani
 confrontation may result in war.  The propaganda sustains its
 pro-Indian character, though tempered now by exhortations for
 mutual restraint.
 Declaring that "both sides were in full agreement in assessing
 the situation," the statement issued following 22-25 October
 "consultations" in New Delhi between Soviet Deputy Foreign
 Minist%r Firyubin and Indian officials, including Prime Minister
 Gandhi, reflected both the continuing Soviet support for  he
 Indian position and increased mutual concern over the explosive-
 ness of the border situation.  The "consultations," according to
 the statement released on the 27th by TASS and INFORMATION SERVICE
 of INDIA, were held "in connection with the tense situation which
 has arisen on the Indian subcontinent and which endangers peace
 in that part of the world."
 The statement specified that the discussions were held "in
 accordance with the existing practice of biannual, bilateral
 consultations and with Article 9 of the Soviet-Indian treaty of
 peace, friendship, and cooperation."  Article 9 provides that
 in the event of an attack or a threat of attack the two parties
 "will immediately start mutual consultations with a view to
 eliminating this threat and taking appropriate effective measures
 to ensure peace and security for their countries."  INFORMATION
 SERVICE of INDIA cited an official spokesman as saying it was
 India which "had invoked" Article 9.  A New Delhi broadcast on
 the 28th reported that the P.S. Kutakhov, commander-in-chief of
 the Soviet air force, was scheduled to arrive in the Indian
 capital the next day for a six-day visit.

 Soviet concern over the situation had been registered in the
 joint communique publicized on 26 October at the end of Kosygin's
 visit to Canada.  The communique called  -as Moscow has done
 repeatedly before--for a "political settlement" in East Pakistan
 "that would take into account the legitimate rights and interests
 of its populat  n and would facilitate a speedy and secure return
 of the refugees," but it added now that "this would be facilitated
 if the interested parties exerc_ied restraint."  Thus in a formal
 document to which India was not a party, Moscow sharpened the
 thrust of earlier statements by Soviet leaders on the necessity
 for both Pakistan and India to display the prudence necessary
 to forestall military hostilities.  In a speech on 14 September,
