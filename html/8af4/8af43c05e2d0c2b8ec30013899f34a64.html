China's New Group Armies: 
Adopting a Concept of 
Modern Warfare 
Secret 
Over the past decade, Beijing has moved decisively to prepare the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA) for modern combat, acquiring selected advanced 
weapons technology, trimming the armed forces by at least 2 million, and 
promoting younger, combat-experienced officers to prominent positions in 
regional and national commands. Although modernization has touched all 
arms of the military, China's ground forces are undergoing the most 
sweeping reforms. China's 35 field armies have been consolidated into 24 
more powerful "group armies," creating the framework for a modern 
Army with greater mobility, firepower, and combined-arms integration. 
The amalgamation of firstline ground forces into group armies has not 
fundamentally altered the distribution of military strength along sensitive 
borders: 
? Along the Sino-Soviet border, most combat troops from the four 
disbanded field armies were absorbed into 13 new, larger group armies. 
The group armies are still far from equal in fighting power to their Soviet 
counterparts, and we expect that group armies opposite the USSR will 
continue to have priority in receiving China's limited supply of modern 
weapons. 
? Opposite Vietnam, seven field armies were reduced to four larger group 
armies.) 
? Despite the elimination of one field army opposite Taiwan, China's 
combat capability has probably been only slightly reduced.  
As a result of resource constraints and long-term defense priorities, we 
believe that China's military modernization program may result in the 
emergence of two distinct types of group armies in the next decade. Group 
armies deployed against Vietnam and Taiwan will probably remain 
infantry-heavy forces, and primary equipment improvements will probably

consist of weapons best suited to supporting infantry operations. In 
contrast, group armies arrayed against the Soviet Union will become 
mechanized formations, and potentially offer a capability to project 
military power. 
25X1 
The amount of combat equipment and combined-arms integration of 
Chinese frontline units has improved, but even the most advanced group 
armies remain markedly inferior to their Soviet adversaries: 
? For example, the Soviet 35th Army?deployed against China's Shenyang 
Military Region?has almost three times as many tanks, four times as 
many armored fighting vehicles, and almost twice as many artillery 
pieces as one of China's best equipped group armies. 
? Soviet group armies in the Far East have an entire range of weapons un-
available to Chinese units, including short-range FROG and medium-
range Scud-B tactical missiles, mobile surface-to-air-missile batteries, 
and combat helicopters. 
Indeed, as its military strength grows, Beijing will need to avoid unduly in-
creasing friction with Moscow that could lead to an arms race that China 
cannot win. 
25X1 
Beijing's recognition of these equipment deficiencies, however, does not 
mean that China is ready to buy large quantities of military hardware from 
the West. Rather, Beijing is more likely for the next few years to seek criti-
cal technologies from the West to "leapfrog" the weapons of the 1970s and 
1980s and to revamp its defense industries to build the "smart" weapons 
capable of meeting the anticipated Soviet threat of the 21st century. The 
Chinese have already proposed joint US-China development of a sophisti-
cated antitank missile, and they have investigated coproducing the US 
Patriot advanced air defense system and relatively low-cost means of 
countering Soviet armor, such as the US Copperhead laser-guided artillery 
projectile.

Beijing is looking for assistance in developing its operations research 
capabilities, and it is currently as interested in the US management 
approach to military research and development as in hardware. Beijing's

record on producing the appropriate weapon, in the right decade to meet 
the threat, is abysmal, and China's defense industry leaders are intent on 
correcting this shortcoming 
To overcome the shortage of funds for weapons research and development, 
Beijing has increasingly sought "creative financing" arrangements in the  
West. 
the Chinese will increasingly seek Western assistance in 
areas that can make significant improvements to their group armies 
without substantial expenditures:

25X1 
25X1 
? Combat Doctrine and Operational Concepts. We believe Beijing intends 
to take full advantage of US and NATO experience in combined-arms 
operations and knowledge of Soviet doctrine and tactics. Chinese military 
leaders have asked to lecture at the newly 25X1 
formed National Defense University, and Chinese strategic and doctrinal 
planners hosted a conference in Beijing with US Army combat operations 
experts in February. 
? Combined-Armed Tactics. Beijing clearly recognizes the value of West-
ern combined-arms experience, and greater exposure to Western war-
fighting doctrine would probably improve Chinese combined-arms 
operations. 
? Force Management. As its appreciation for the cost and complexity of 
ground force equipment grows, China will probably focus on Western 
logistics management techniques. Although Beijing probably does not 
perceive a need to copy Western force-sustainment methods, the PLA 
may adopt a more centralized, demand-driven logistics system to manage 
its most expensive weapon components. 
In some cases?to explore concepts requiring modern equipment?the 
Chinese General Staff will buy a few items of military hardware from the 
West. For example, in late March Beijing purchased eight French light 
attack helicopters to form an experimental Army aviation corps subordi-
nate to a group army. This small purchase, however, will probably be the 
extent of light attack helicopter acquisitions from the West at least through 
the end of 1990.

As expected in such a fundamental reorganization of military forces, 
Beijing's short-term problems are substantial. 
although difficulties are recognized, few PLA officers are 
questioning the efficacy of the reorganization. Emphasis in the near term 
will be on low-cost areas of force restructuring, training, development of 
operational art, and experimentation. Beijing's formation of the group 
armies is only the first step in a long process to produce a truly modern 
force capable of meeting any adversary, even the Soviet Union, in the 21st 
century.

China's New Group Armies: 
Adopting a Concept of 
Modern Warfare 
Group Armies Take Shape on the Soviet Border 
Stimulated by the markedly improved Soviet military 
threat opposite its northern border and by the prob-
lems in coordination and communication that oc-
curred during its 1979 war with Vietnam, Beijing 
during this past decade has moved decisively to 
prepare the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for 
modern combat. Military leaders have acquired se-
lected advanced weapons and foreign weapons tech-
nology, trimmed the armed forces by at least 2 million 
to the current level of 4-5 million, and promoted 
younger officers with combat experience to prominent 
positions in regional and national commands. 
Applying the Lessons of Korea and Vietnam 
Origins of the current reforms date from the Korean 
war, where massed Chinese infantry formations were 
often decimated by the overwhelming firepower of UN 
forces, and US air superiority wreaked havoc with 
tenuous Chinese supply lines. The organizational 
structure that had served the PLA well during its 
guerrilla and civil wars was not readily adaptable to 
the modern battlefield and conditions outside the 
Chinese mainland: foreign "masses" could not be 
mobilized to provide supplies or intelligence to Chi-
nese combatants, and lightly armed infantry units 
ultimately could not beat artillery- and armor-heavy 
opponents. 
Although modernization has touched all arms of the 
military, China's ground forces are undergoing the 
most sweeping reforms?structural changes that have 
eliminated field armies in favor of more powerful 
combined-arms armies. The transition to these group 
armies culminates a decadelong drive to break with 
the central tenet of the Maoist People's War strate-
gy?trading land for time to mobilize China's huge 
population for guerrilla assaults on overextended ene-
my forces. 
An early indication of the transformation in China's 
defense doctrine came in the summer of 1981 with a 
series of military maneuvers near Zhangjiakou some 
150 kilometers north of Beijing.  
1 
Realization of Beijing's inability to protect regional 
interests crystallized following the Vietnamese inva-
sion of Cambodia in 1978, when the threat of China's 
military power was not sufficient to deter Hanoi from 
attacking a Chinese ally. China's invasion of northern 
Vietnam in 1979 failed to force Hanoi to withdraw 
from Cambodia and accomplished only limited mili-
tary objectives at considerable economic and human 
cost. The invasion illustrated the inadequacies of 
PLA doctrine?Chinese field commanders failed to 
adequately synchronize the actions of combat ele-
ments, and tactical flexibility was further constrained 
by a cumbersome command and control system. 
Combined-arms integration has become a central 
goal of the current reform movement.

The Group Army Goes Nationwide 
In May 1985, Central Military Commission Chair-
man Deng Xiaoping announced the consolidation of 
all remaining field armies to combined-arms group 
armies.1 
Transitional Problems 
As expected in such a fundamental reorganization of 
military forces, Beijing's short-term problems are 
substantial. The simple act of streamlining the force, 
for example, has led to severe problems in placing the 
several hundred thousand demobilized PLA officers 
in equivalent civilian posts and disgruntlement among 
many who believed that they were guaranteed lifelong 
careers in the armed forces. 
 Public speeches by China's 
highest military officials underscore that they believe 
the problems are solvable and that, in the long run, 
China's defense interests will be far better served by 
the new military organization. 
Secret 
The most serious problem facing the group armies is 
that they lack sufficient quantities of modern military 
hardware: 
? Only a few group armies have mechanized infantry 
formations, and many still lack sufficient trucks to 
move and support their soldiers on the battlefield. 
? Group armies have only limited quantities of the 
shoulder-fired HN-5 (SA-7) air defense missile. The 
HN-5 provides only a close-in defense of four 
kilometers or less, and the organic air defense needs 
are still largely provided by visually aimed, towed 
antiaircraft pieces of World War II vintage. 
? Beijing's only antitank missile deployed in any 
numbers is the HJ-73 (a copy of the Soviet wire-
guided Sagger system), which is easily susceptible to 
countermeasures and has an obsolete warhead un-
able to penetrate the armor of any tank more 
modern than the Soviet T-62. 
These and other equipment shortfalls, particularly in 
the combat support area, are unlikely to be remedied 
soon, for China's military budget is severely restricted 
by more pressing economic needs. 
Present group armies are relatively unwieldy struc-
tures. We believe the sheer size of the new formations 
and geographical separation of subordinate units are 
severely testing existing command, control, and logis-
tics systems, impeding China's drive to weld group 
armies into cohesive combined-arms organizations.' 
US Army observers at recent PLA combined-arms exercises have 
noted the lack of integration between Chinese combat teams?foot 
soldiers and tanks operate separately on the battlefield, leaving 
infantry exposed to unsuppressed enemy small-arms fire, and tanks 
vulnerable to antitank missiles.

Secret 
Moreover, the restructuring has been tremendously 
disruptive?Chinese military publications indicate 
that some infantry divisions were converted en masse 
to artillery and antiaircraft brigades?forcing the 
retraining of large numbers of officers and senior 
enlisted personnel. The massive reorganization has 
also disrupted traditional command relationships?
and crucial career ties?between officers. \ 
The impact of these 
disruptions has probably been magnified by outdated 
command and control procedures.) 
Two other notable problems are the result of a 
tradition of regional orientation. Although nominally 
national forces, China's group armies remain closely 
associated with individual military regions" 
 /Officers, for example, are trained at mili-
tary region academies and usually spend entire ca-
reers serving in a single group army or military 
region. 
China's traditional emphasis on regional defenses and 
self-reliant combat troops has produced a logistic 
system poorly suited for movement of forces national-
ly. The PLA logistic system is designed to ensure that

be overwhelmed by the wartime requirements of a 
more modern ground force. Much of China's basic 
military equipment?spare parts, calibration, and di-
agnostic equipment?is produced and managed by 
military regions, using different administrative proce-
dures. Moreover, among China's weapons and ammu-
nition factories?many of which produce identical 
items?there is little standardization in such basic 
areas as spare parts numbering systems or shipping 
container designs. These characteristics severely con-
strain Beijing's ability to move group armies away 
from the military region support network. 
But Long-Term Gains 
Despite the problems, the combined-arms army is the 
foundation upon which Beijing can build a modern 
ground army. Already, the changing structure has 
revitalized the discussion of strategy and tactics and 
forced officers in the various service arms of the PLA 
to think far more realistically about war on the 
modern battlefield. Numerous articles in China's 
premier military newspaper, the Liberation Army 
Daily, indicate that a lively discussion of combined-
arms operations is under way. 
Compared with field armies and the 1982 version of 
the combined-arms armies, the new table of organiza-
tion offers greater mobility, firepower, and combined-
arms integration (see table 1). In the past year, 
entirely new combat organizations have appeared 
throughout the PLA, and previously independent 
tank, artillery, engineer, air defense, and chemical 
defense units have been subordinated to group armies. 
Although equipment levels and readiness postures 
continue to depend on mission and location, Chinese 
main force units are probably more standardized 
under the group army structure than at any previous

requisition supplies from logistics centers, but instead receive 
regular, predetermined shipments of spare parts and ammunition.

military reorganization. The maneuvers also under-
scored Beijing's resolve to correct one of China's most 
fundamental combat weaknesses: poor coordination 
between ground forces and close air support aircraft. 
Acquiring New Weapons 
China has made considerable progress toward devel-
oping some of the new weapons and equipment needed 
to give offensive punch to group armies. In the past 
three years, Beijing has unveiled an impressive variety 
of weapons, including an improved main battle tank, 
new armored personnel carriers, self-propelled and 
towed artillery, and lightweight surface-to-air mis-
siles. China's 
most elite group armies in the northeast are receiving 
China's newest ground weapons: in the 39th Group 
Army, for example, the 116th Division?with more 
than 400 armored vehicles?became China's second 
fully mechanized infantry division last year, and the 
117th Division has received new tanks with Western-
designed 105-mm main guns and armored personnel  
carriers with West German engines.  
The new systems are being provided in small quanti-
ties, however, and China would be unlikely to fully 
equip its forces opposite the USSR for at least 10 
years. Moreover, the Soviets almost certainly would 
continue upgrading their forces during this period. As 
these new weapons are deployed, however, and until 
Secret 
the Soviets add new weapon systems to their forces 
along the border, the Chinese systems will begin to fill 
some glaring gaps in Beijing's defenses: 
? New, extended-range artillery systems provide im-
pressive fire support, equaling or exceeding the 
range of the Soviet guns facing them. 
? The new Chinese tank is superior in range, accura-
cy, and mobility to standard T-54/55 and T-62 
tanks, which make up 90 percent of Soviet tanks 
currently facing China. 
? The new infantry fighting vehicles offer a challenge 
to the BMP-1, the backbone of Soviet mechanized 
infantry forces in Asia; the automatic cannon of 
Chinese infantry fighting vehicles demonstrated at 
an arms show in Beijing late last year could destroy 
BMPs at ranges up to 3,000 meters. However, if the 
Soviets fit BMPs in the Far East with additional 
armor?as they have in Eastern Europe and Af-
ghanistan?this range would be considerably 
reduced. 
? Deployment of self-propelled antiaircraft artillery 
(AAA) and infantry fighting vehicles with automat-
ic cannons would provide Chinese mechanized 
forces with improved defense against Soviet attack 
helicopters 
Training the Modern Soldier 
The composition of the Chinese officer corps is also 
undergoing a transformation. 
Chinese officers are no longer promoted 
directly from the enlisted ranks; all new officers must 
at least be senior middle school (high school) gradu-
ates and complete a two-year officer training course 
at a military academy. Furthermore, to attract 
China's most educated youth to the military, college 
graduates can receive commissions after completing a 
one-year officer training course, or completing mili-
tary training courses now mandatory at some civilian 
universities.

Secret 
Equally profound changes are under way in China's 
enlisted ranks, aimed at increasing the number of 
technically trained soldiers by creating a career non-
commissioned officer (NCO) corps. The first NCO 
training academy was opened last year to retain 
technically skilled enlisted men who can no longer 
expect to advance to officer ranks. An NCO career 
system also provides a base for training conscripts and 
wartime mobilization of a ready reserve. Within 
group armies, a skilled NCO corps will free junior 
officers from technical and administrative tasks 
and like most Western armies---will allow officers 
to focus on improving leadership and command. 
Over the past three years, two highly specialized 
means have been used to provide very different types 
of training experiences for China's ground forces. The 
most dramatic of these is the battlefield south of the 
town of Malipo on the Vietnamese border where, 
since April 1984, troops from 
9 
throughout China have participated in Beijing's cam-
paign of military pressure against Vietnam.' During a 
recent visit to the Shijiazhuang officer academy south 
of Beijing, Chinese officers told a US training delega-
tion that duty at Malipo was considered an elite 
assignment for new officers, who can test their com-
mand abilities in combat against battle-hardened 
Vietnamese troops. Beijing is more fully exploiting the 
training opportunity provided by the Malipo cam-
paign this year

Although combat at Malipo provides battle-hardening 
for China's rejuvenated officer corps, it offers little in  
terms of combined-arms experience.) 
Moreover, the fighting 
at Malipo has provided no opportunities to improve 
the PLA's most pressing deficiencies: close air support 
and integrated armor and infantry operations. Nei-
ther side has used aircraft to support infantry opera-
tions on the battlefield, and armored vehicles are 
unsuited to the mountainous terrain of Malipo. 
China has turned to the West for advanced training 
techniques. Chinese military visitors to the National 
Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, indicated 
that China was preparing its first national combined-
arms training center near Nanjing. 
reports in the Chinese press indicate that 
the center is using selected state-of-the-art technology 
including computers to simulate battlefield conditions 
and, like Fort Irwin, uses a permanent opposition 
force, probably drawn from a tank division nearby. If 
the Chinese fully exploit the opposition force concept, 
these troops will probably use tactics designed to 
simulate those that China's ground forces would face 
against a Soviet attack. 
According to press reports, eventually every group 
army will travel to the National Training Center for 
combat evaluation. However, intensive combined-
arms training at a single national facility for China's 
77 infantry divisions would require more than five 
years, and we believe instead that the Nanjing facility 
will serve as a model for the development of other 
combined-arms training centers throughout China. 
Secret 
Implications for the Regional Balance 
We believe that reorganization and consolidation of 
the armed forces have not significantly reduced 
China's fighting strength In the past 
two years, we estimate that as many as 400,000 troops 
have been trimmed from China's ground combat 
forces (excluding cuts in the General Logistics De-
partment and the General Political Department). The 
majority-300,000--of the personnel reductions were 
a result of the elimination of four military region 
staffs and the consolidation of 35 main force armies 
into 24 larger group armies, resulting in the elimina-
tion of 11 army command staffs. Thus, net reductions 
in PLA fighting strength have probably been limited 
to 100,000 troops?roughly 3 percent of PLA ground 
forces?composed largely of China's oldest, least edu-
cated officers and soldiers. 
Moreover, China's force modernization and reorgani-
zation are aimed largely at improving defensive capa-
bilities against the Soviet Union, and thus we do not 
detect any reduction in emphasis on this sensitive 
military front. In the three military regions along the 
Sino-Soviet border, most combat troops from the four 
disbanded field armies were absorbed into 13 new, 
larger group armies. The group armies are still far 
from equal in fighting power to their Soviet counter-
parts but troop 
levels along the Soviet border now constitute a greater 
proportion of total Chinese troop strength than before 
reorganization. Moreover, group armies opposite the 
USSR will continue to have priority in receiving 
China's limited modern weapons. 
The ground force reorganization has resulted in only 
marginal changes in the distribution of Chinese forces 
arrayed against Vietnam and Taiwan. Opposite Viet-
nam, Chinese ground forces were reduced from seven 
field armies to four larger group armies, probably 
resulting in a net reduction of some 40,000 combat 
troops. This reduction is more than offset, however, by

China's military capabilities opposite Taiwan depend 
largely on the naval and air balance along the Taiwan 
Strait, and improvements in ground forces have only a 
limited impact on China's force-projection capabili-
ties there. Beijing has cut its ground forces opposite 
Taiwan largely through the 
elimination of the 29th Army. China's combat capa-
bility against Taiwan, however, has probably been 
only slightly reduced. The remaining army in Fujian 
Province is the best equipped force in southern China 
and now includes a fourth infantry division and new 
AAA, artillery, and tank brigades 
As a result of resource constraints and long-term 
defense priorities, we believe that China's military 
modernization program may result in the emergence 
of two distinct types of group armies in the next 
decade. Group armies deployed against Vietnam and 
Taiwan will probably remain infantry-heavy forces 
because their opponents are less mechanized than the 
Soviets. Primary improvements will probably consist 
of weapons best suited to supporting infantry opera-
tions?towed artillery, mortars, small arms, tactical 
radios, and artillery fire-control systems?and inte-
grated close air support coordination. In contrast, 
group armies arrayed against the Soviet Union will 
probably become highly mechanized formations with 
weapons comparable to Soviet and Western 1980s-
vintage designs, and potentially offer a major capabil-
ity to project military power. 
Implications for the United States and the West 
Beijing's recognition of the equipment deficiencies 
apparent in the group armies does not mean that 
China is ready to buy outright large quantities of 
military hardware from the West. China's priority, as 
reflected in the state budget, is not major defense 
spending but building China's civilian economy. 
Equipping the group armies soon to meet the idealized 
weapon holdings would be prohibitively expensive?
for example, China would have to build over 10,000 
Secret 
armored personnel carriers to mechanize every infan-
try division. 
very few weapon systems are in production for the 
ground forces. 
To overcome the shortage of funds for weapons 
research and development, Beijing has increasingly 
sought "creative financing" arrangements in the  
West.1 
\ In other discussions I  
the Chinese military-industrial complex is increasing-
ly insistent on exploring the possibilities of offset 
agreements or long-term loans to finance the projects. 
In some cases, to explore concepts requiring modern 
equipment, the Chinese General Staff will buy a few 
samples of selected military hardware. The Chinese, 
for example, are planning to form an army aviation/ 
army air corps structure with light attack helicopters 
subordinate to the group army. 
Rather than buying equipment, Beijing is more likely 
for the next few years to seek critical technologies 
from the West to "leapfrog" the weapons of the 1970s 
and 1980s and to revamp its defense industries to 
build weapons capable of meeting the anticipated 
Soviet threat of the 21st century (see inset). Using the 
slogan "win the 21st century," an article in the 
authoritative Liberation Army Daily in October 1985, 
authored by members of the General Staff Depart-
ment, strongly urged that the PLA should build for 
the future and concentrate its limited resources on

Secret 
China's Window of Security: 
Buying Time To Modernize 
Restricted articles by China's senior foreign policy 
advisers disclose that Beijing believes the Soviet 
Union is concentrating on rebuilding its economy and 
defending the gains it made in the 1970s before 
resuming the offensive early in the next century. At 
that time, Moscow will increase the military pressure 
on China to bend Beijing's policy to Moscow's will. 
This Chinese judgment is reflected in Beijing's con-
tinuing and determined military modernization pro-
gram designed to meet the Soviet threat in the next 
century. Chinese Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin told a 
US delegation last July that the Soviet Union re-
mains China's most severe security threat, but the 
next 10 to 15 years represent a window of security 
that allows China to reorganize its military. 
We believe that Beijing's strategy requires a low level 
of tensions with Moscow if its reform program, which 
includes the ambitious military modernization drive, 
is to succeed. This strategy will probably become 
more difficult?and more crucial?over the next 
decade. Indeed, as its military strength grows, Beijing 
will be compelled to pursue a dialogue with the 
Soviet Union to avoid unduly increasing friction with 
a powerful adversary, creating an arms race that 
China is not able to win. Beijing realizes that no 
military strategy it might choose would allow it to 
fully meet the Soviet threat. Accordingly, the Chinese 
continue to see talks as the key to controlling ten-
sions. To this end, we expect Beijing to continue to 
exchange visits and to sign economic and technical 
agreements with Moscow?without fundamentally 
altering its assessment of the Soviet threat. For more 
information on how China has chosen to manage the  
Soviet threat,

acquiring advanced military technologies for their 
military-industrial complex and delay the production 
of a lot of military hardware. The Chinese, therefore, 
are focusing their acquisition efforts on the "smart" 
weapons of the West: 
? In September 1985, Xie Guang, a senior Chinese 
arms-procurement officer, told a visiting US official 
that China was no longer interested in buying the I-
TOW antitank missile but proposed for the first 
time a joint US-Chinese development program for a 
sophisticated, laser-guided antitank missile. 
? Chinese buyers are seeking the technology for guid-
ed and unguided submunitions?designed to destroy 
massed armor formations?that can be delivered by 
aircraft, artillery, and multiple-rocket launchers. 
25X1 
25X1 
? Advanced Western air defense systems could pro-
vide a quantum improvement in the battlefield 
survivability of China's group armies. In the spring 
of 1986, officials of China's General Staff Depart-
ment, although having requested a briefing on the 
US improved HAWK air defense missile, were far 
more interested in discussing a coproduction scheme 
for the more modern Patriot system. 
25X1 
In addition to seeking the advanced technologies, 25X1 
Beijing is looking for assistance in learning systems 
analysis in the management of defense research and 
development projects. Beijing's track record on pro-
ducing the appropriate weapon, in the right decade to 25X1 
"Smart" or "fire and forget" weapons use computer microcircuits 
and heat sensors or radar to identify enemy targets without being 
aimed or controlled after firing. For example, the US SADARM

massed enemy armor and, while descending by parachute, identifies 
and fires a projectile at the heat signature of vehicle engines

meet the threat, is abysmal, and indications are strong 
that China's defense industry leaders are intent on 
correcting this problem. According to US military 
officers, during a visit to the United States last 
November, China's Political Commissar for the Na-
tional Defense Science, Technology, and Industry 
Commission, Wu Shaozu, was more interested in the 
US management approach to military research and 
development than in hardware. In fact, Wu invited a 
US joint systems analysis team to visit Beijing in 1987 
to educate Chinese scientists on the US approach. 
In the shorter term, the Chinese will increasingly seek 
Western assistance in areas where they can make 
significant improvements to their group armies with-
out substantial expenditures of funds: 
? Combat Doctrine and Operational Concepts. We 
believe Beijing intends to take advantage of US and 
NATO experience in combined-arms operations and 
knowledge of Soviet doctrine and tactics. During 
US Army Chief of Staff Wickham's visit to China 
in November 1986, Chinese military leaders ex-
pressed profound interest in exchanges of military 
academy students, and the Chinese have already 
asked the US defense attaches in Beijing to lecture 
on a variety of topics at the newly formed National 
Defense University including army aviation doc-
trine, command and control, and air defense proce-
dures for US ground forces. During meetings in 
Beijing with US Army combat operations experts in 
February, Chinese strategists demonstrated a strong 
focus on US operational art and doctrine for com-
bating massed Soviet armor. 
? Combined-Arms Tactics. Beijing has made an ex-
tensive effort to study US and NATO modern 
combat tactics. Greater exposure to Western war-
fighting doctrine?and the PLA's growing emphasis 
Secret 
on realistic combined-arms training?should result 
in improved Chinese combined-arms operations, 
especially as more modern weapons become avail-
able and younger, better educated officers move 
into command positions. 
? Force-Management Techniques. Beijing's interest in 
Western force-management techniques will proba-
bly grow with the increasing complexity of group 
army equipment. Especially in the northern military 
regions, the focus of wartime logistics management 
is shifting to providing spare parts for laser range-
finders, battlefield computers, and large-caliber am-
munition. China will probably focus on the tools 
used to manage logistics?quality-assurance tech-
nology, large-scale automated logistics management 
systems?and probably does not perceive a need to 
copy Western force sustainment methods or signifi-
cantly modify the PLA's decentralized force man-
agement practices. However, as its appreciation for 
the cost and complexity of modern ground force 
equipment grows, the PLA may adopt a more 
centralized, demand-driven logistic system to man-
age its most expensive weapon components. 
Beijing's formation of the group armies, therefore, is 
the first step in a long process?one that spans 
decades?of force modernization. Emphasis in the 
near term will be on those low-cost areas of force 
restructuring, training, the development of the opera-
tional art, and experimentation. But the new forma-
tions are designed to carry the Chinese Army into the 
21st century with the hope that, once the funding is 
available and defense industries become sufficiently 
modernized, Beijing can field a truly modern force 
capable of meeting any adversary, even the Soviet 
Union.
