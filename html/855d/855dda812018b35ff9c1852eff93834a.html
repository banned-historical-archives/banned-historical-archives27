different materials, the freight charge will be computed on the 
material of the highest cost used in making the product.

will be charged at half rate. 
b. The regulations governing excess weight in technical 
standard loading capacity is not applicable under the following condi-
tions; in which cases, the actual weight of freight must be charged 
at full rate:

(3) Uhen it is impossible to load any more freight 
on the open or box car due to the nature, shape and type of packing 
(such as machinery, fry and freight transported by open cars), the 
station master at the shipping point must acknowledge this fact and 
state the realeans on the invoice (the standard for full-load volume 
is based on the entry made at the starting point). 
3. Freight with or without technical standard loading 
capacity is subject to base weight. The weight which exceeds the 
technical standard loading capacity will be charged at half rate, 
but when the excess weight is below the base weight the freight 
charges should be computed according to base weight. 
Article 13. No additional fee will be collected for moving 
within the premises of the station freight on which freight charges 
are calculated according to carload shipment. Freight charges of 
goods moved within the premises of the station by locomotives or 
cars owned by the freight owner will be computed according to

Section II. Less-Than-Carload Freight 
Article 14. In computing freight charge, less-than-carload 
freight is the freight which is loaded in cars at less-than-carload 
with two or more copies of invoice. 
In transporting less-than-carload freight according to the 
actual weight or volume based weight, the freight:Us charged accord-
ing to less-than-carload freight rates. 
Article 15. In converting volume of goods into weight, measure 
the size of the freight as it is loaded on the car, multiply the 
length, ddth and height. Multiply the resulting figure (carried out 
to the hundfeial place and rounded out to the nearest tenth) by 300 
kilograms, enter it in the proper column of the invoice. When the 
weight of each cubic meter exceeds 300 kilograms, the freight charges 
will be computed according to the actual weight of the freight. If 
there are two columns of entries on the invoice, convert the volume 
in each column into weight; if there are two or more pieces of goods 
in one column, the volumes of all the goods must be totalled (house-
hold goods may be figured out separately according to the actual 
situation). When all the goods are of the same type or are governed 
by the same regulation, the total volume should be computed to the 
tenth place, with figure in the hundivdth place rounded out to the 
nearest tenth. 
Article 16. When several different types of goods listed on 
the invoice are shipped by loss-than-carload shipment, the methods 
of computing are as follows: 
1. Goods of the same shipping rate will be oomputed by 
total. 
2. Goods of different shipping rates will be computed 
separately according to their chargeable weight.

6,000 kilograms but more than 3,000 kilograms, its chargeable weight 
will be reduced by 10 per cent according to less-than -carload 
freight rates; and when it weighs over 6,000 kilograms, the charge-
able weight 1411 be reduced by 20 per cent in accordance with less-

Section III. Freight Charges For Goods Facceeding the Limit in 
Weight, Length, and Amount 
Article 18. 
1. When a piece of freight -which exceeds the loading 
capacity indicated an the car or exceeds the length of the car 
necessitates the use of two or more cars to traneport it, the 
freight charges will be calculated according to carload freight 
rates and the capacity indicated on the cars used for carrying 
heavy loade. If the two cars are of different loading capacity, 
the freight will be computed according to the car with the smaller 
loading capacity. When using light-burden cars, fees will be 
calculated according to the capacity of the car and carload freight 
rates. 
2. Vlhen goods shipped exceed the train load limit (the 
limit on the number of locomotives and cars as stipulated in the 
Railroad Technical Management Regulations) the freight charge is 
computed as follow: 
a. When freight cars are loaded with freights exceed-
ing the limit, based on the capacity indicated on the freight car, 
compute the freight charges in accordance with the carload freight 
rates. 
b. When using light capacity freight cars, based on 
the capacity of the freight car, Compute the freight charge in ac-
cordance with carload freight rates without, additional fee for 
exceeding the limit. 
3. It two shipments of goods are made on, one light 
capacity car and fall into the same freight rate category, computa-
tion of freight charges may be based on either shipment of goods. 
If they are of different freight rates, freight charges will be 
based on the higher freight rates. When other goods are loaded on 
open cars in lieu of light capacity cars, freight charges will be 
collected for goods on the car without the tees for light capacity 
cars. 
4. hen test-frame cars are used for carrying freight 
exceeding the loading capacity, the calculation of freight charge 
is based on light capacity car carrying extra load. When special 
Flat cars return from another station after delivering over-weight, 
over-length and over-capacity freights, in addition to collecting 
freight charges according to the methods mentioned above, foie on 
return trip will also be collected.

2. Fees for loading and unloading loss-than-carload freights: 0.01 yuan per 10 kilograms. 
3. Fees for changing loads: 
Fees for transferring freight are calculated according to the total foe for unloading and loading. Fee for rearranging not well loaded cars is calculated according to the fees for transferring freight. When part of 
the load is unloaded and then reloaded, the foe will be calculated according to fees for miscollaneoue vork. However, it does not matter -whether the whole load or part of the load is unloadedand tleen reloaded the foe should 
not be over the loading fee for the entire car calculated according to the loading fee at that particular station. 
4. Charges for moving freights: 
When fevights are moved for distance of less than thirty meters, freight charges will be 60 per cent of the loading fee for freights being =Mad; if the distance exceeds thirty meters, the charges for each additional 
30 =tore or fraction thereof will. be 30 per cent of the loading fee for the freights being moved. 
5. aiscellaneous Dee: 
Such fee is computed on the total rumber of hours spent by the entire crew (fraction of an hour is considered an hour) and each hour is charged on the basis of freight rate for one ton of ordinary freight. 
Note: a. The applicability of loading and unloading charges: loading refers to loading or freights from a point designated for the sbabking of freight by the station to the freight car. Unloading refers to the unloading 
of freights from the freight car to a point designated by the station for the stacking of freights. Heeeever, the point for the lo-ding of lumber and the freight stacking point which is for the exclusive use of 
the freight owner must he thirty .meters away from the freight car. If the point is more than thirty metera away from the freight ear, additional roving fee will be 'charged, (the standard far determining the 
distance is based on the actual dieter= from the cantor of the pile of freights to the center of the freight ear). 
b. The coverage of freight moving charges: The moving of cargo from anc . to the points designated by freight. teener (including loading and unloading charges). 
C'. When carload freights of different loading and unloading rates are handled as one ahipment, the computation uill be based on the freight that has the highest freight rate. tioeever, heavy weight freights such-as 
vehicles, caskets with or without corpse, or arty other typos of cargo when handled as one shipment, the charges must be calculated separately. 
d. Additional work relating to loading and unloading is not chargeable. (Such as opening and closing of freight carte front and roar doors, window? and railinge; the arrangement of poles, rails and supporting 
boards; moving of tarpaulin, ropes, covering and =covering cargoes: stacking, binding and unbinding; moving of waterproof' ties), cargo arrangements general clean-up of freight cars, -warehouse and freight ccepounds.) 
a. All charges for loading and unloading of cargoes are corouted on basis of this regulation whether guch service is by manual labour or, machines. 
f. index tb In the chart is in reference to urtcrated goods as in the freight classification chart for uncrated goods. Other goods that are packed in box or crated will be charged as ordindaz7 freights.
