 Buddhist and "struggle force" leaders in Hue and
 Saigon are continuing to denounce both the US and
 the Ky government, despite the collapse,. of rebel
 resistance in Da Nang.  Communist propaganda is en-
 couraging the dissidents to focus opposition on a-nti-
 Americanism rather than on the more limited objective
 of bringing-down the Saigon go~,~ernment.  Government.
 troops, meanwhile, have maintained pressure on elusive
 Communist units in widespread sections of -South Viet-..

 to the relatively high levels of mid-March.  The Com-

 Buddhist and "struggle force"
 leaders in Hue and Saigon are con-
 tinuing their opposition to the Ky
 government, despite the collapse
 of rebel armed resistance in Da
 Nang.
 After government action was
 temporarily stalled by confusion
 among government commanders: in
 Da Nang, Saigon troops on 19 May
 began moving in on sectors held
 by "struggle" forces.  Street
 fighting erupted, and gradually be-
 came more severe during the next
 several days as government tanks
 and aircraft were utilized.  Armed
 resistance in the city finally
 collapsed on 23 May with the
 surrender of two main pagodas which
 had been serving as dissident
 command posts.
 Although precise casualties
 resulting from the action at Da
 Nang are not known, antigovernment
 elements probably suffered close
 to 150 killed and 700 wounded
 during the nine days of resistance.
 Government forces captured former
 a supporter of the antigovernment
 movement, this week declared his
 loyalty to the Saigon government.
 Thus far, however, he has been
 unable or unwilling to take any
 positive action in the face of the
 strong dissident leadership in Hue,
 including Buddhist monk Tri Quang
 and former I Corps commanders Thi
 and Dinh.
 The Buddhist leadership in Hue
 and Saigon maintained its all-out
 opposition to the Ky government this
 week through speeches, communiques,
 and demonstrations.  In Hue, Tri
 Quang continued his efforts to
 enlist US support.  However, as the
 Ky government gained momentum
 following the Da Nang defeat, there
 was increasing criticism of the US
 political position in the public
 remarks of Quang and other "struggle"
 leaders.  This resumption of anti-
 Americanism, beginning with a
 hunger strike before the US Consul-
 ate, and culminating in the sacking
 and burning of the USIS library
 by militant students, has led the
 consulate to consider the evacuation
 of most US citizens and employees
 from the Hue area.         25X1

 Numerous demonstrations against

 Although the Liberation Front

 `~   SE G''RE T
 POWER STRUGGLE MAY BE UNDER WAY IN CHINA
 Signs are growing that China's
 leaders may be locked in a behind-
 the-scenes power struggle.  This is
 implied by the mounting sharpness
 of attacks on "antiparty elements"
 and "right opportunists within the
 party,"'`builcling up to a charge on
 19 May that these people had been
 plotting to seize the leadership
 of the party central committee.
 Specific charges have so far
 been leveled only at a few lesser
 officials, all members or former
 members of the Peking city party
 and government apparatus.  They
 .include--Teng To, a party secretary,
 Liao Mo-sha, a recently dismissed
 department head; Li Chi, head of
 the propaganda department; and Wu
 Han, vice mayor of Peking.  Since
 15 May the role of the Peking city
 party committee itself has been
 called into question, increasing
 the possibility that its first
 secretary and responsible officer,
 Peng Chen, is the real target of
 this power play.
 Peng Chen is a member of Mao's
 inner circle of advisers.  Neither
 Peng nor the second secretary of
 the city party committee, Liu Jen,
 has been seen in public since 29
 March.  In fact, Peng is the only
 important politburo figure who has
 not appeared in recent weeks and
 who failed to see the Albanians
 during their recent visit.
 The authoritative journal Red
 Flag. charged on 15 May that par~Ey
 ournals published by the Peking
 city committee had been serving
 as tools of the "antiparty elements"
 for years.  Red Flag went on to
 warn that those who have been ac-
 tively supporting these elements--
 Tc~ng To, Wu Han, et al.--and
 directing Peking party organs to
 cover up for them with "sham crit-
 icism" will not be able to conceal
 themselves much longer.  Embroider-
 ing this theme, a provincial broad-
 cast on 21 May demanded:  "What has
 the Peking municipal party commit-
 tee been doing all this time?"
 The official People's Daily .was
 even more pointed.  It asserted
 that someone in the committee
 w~~s supporting and protecting
 Tang and his friends.  "Who and
 to what end and with what ambi-
 ti.on?" the daily wanted to know.
 The attacks have been devel-
 oX~ed slowly and with care.  They
 point unmistakably at Peng but  ?
 strop short of naming him.  This
 suiggests -that the attackers are
 st:i11 not entirely sure of their
 ground or that they want to impli-
 cate other men and do not want to
 bring Peng down just yet.  The cir-
 cu~.mstances also suggest that this
 is not a case in which a unified
 leadership under Mao is purging an
 errant comrade.  In the past when
 Mao has found such a step necessary,
 he has moved first and published
 afterward.
 A power struggle at the level
 where Peng operates means a-loss

 JAPANESE COMMUNIST PARTY MOUES TOWARD 1V[ORE INDEPENDENCE
 Japan's Communist Party is
 adopting a more "independent"
 line in an attempt to gain do-
 mestic support and end the in-
 ternational isolation that has
 resulted from its close identi-
 fication with Peking.
 Party publications are
 stressing the desirability of
 "autonomy and independence." On
 11 May the party newspaper Aka-
 hata criticized both Peking's
 "doctrinairism" and Moscow's
 "modern revisionism."
 In a recent gesture of in-
 dependence, a high-level dele-
 gation led by Secretary General
 Miyambto apparently told the
 Chinese that the JCP supported
 the Soviet proposal for united
 actions by-all anti-imperialist
 forces against US "imperialism"
 in Vietnam.  As a result, no
 joint communique came out of the
 several-weeks' talks in Peking.
 Although the JCP followed Peking
 in boycotting the 23rd Soviet
 party congress,;:Miyarnot'o returned to
 Japan still calling for the
 "solidarity of all socialist na-
 tions" in Vietnam.
 The JCP is also showing a
 new interest in the Communist
 parties of Eastern Europe, par-
 ticularly now in Rumania, where
 a party delegation has arrived
 for an extended goodwill visit.
 The Japanese may join the Ruma-
 nians in calling for greater
 autonomy for national parties
 within the international Commu-
 nist movement.  Lately, the JCP
 has stressed the example set by
 Rumania, North Korea, and Cuba
 in standing up to one or both
 of the two major Communist powers
 and asserting their national in-
 dependence.
 There are indications that
 the Japanese .Communists will
 expand their role in interna-
 tional fronts not controlled by
 Peking, while dropping out of--
 or being excluded from--those
 where Peking calls the tune.
 Recent difficulties with Moscow,
 however, plus painful memories
 of Soviet dictation to the party
 in the 1950s, militate against
 a rapprochement- with the Soviet
 party.  The JCP will probably
 remain on most matters closer
 to Peking ideologically.
 tion with the JCP.
 The new line may well in-
 crease the JCP's presently cir-
 cumscribed influence in Japanese
 politics.  A new "Japanese look"
 will aid it in working through
 broad popular movements and in
 joint action with other polit-
 ical parties, where it can
 exert meaningful influence.
 Peking, on the other hand, may
 now work with receptive ele-
 ments in the Socialist and rul-
 ing Liberal Democratic parties, 25X1

 Malaysian Deputy .Prime Minis-
 ter Razak and Indonesian foreign
 Minister Malik are slated to meet
 in Bangkok in the next few days
 for official talks aimed at end-
 ing confrontation.
 In recent weeks Malik and
 other Indonesian leaders have pub-
 licly declared their firm inten-
 tion to put an end to the three-
 year-old paramilitary campaign,
 On 23 May, Radio Indonesia an-
 nounced that President Sukarno,.
 who has been urging the continua-
 tion of confrontation, had
 "agreed" to the peace talks.
 At Bangkok, Malik will re-
 portedly abandon Indonesia's oft-
 stated demand for a reascertain-
 ment of public opinion in Malay-
 sian Borneo.  In order to reach
 a settlement, however, he will
 still need some "face-saving" de-
 vice and the Bangkok talks will
 provide a test of Indonesian
 eagerness for a formal settlement
 and Malaysian flexibility.
 On the domestic front, plan-
 ning is again under way for an
 early convening of the Provisional
 People's Consultative Assembly
 (MPRS)--Indonesia's "policy deter-
 mining body."  An earlier sched-
 uled 12 May meeting of the body
 was indefinitely postponed in the
 face of opposition from Sukarno,
 Responding to strong student
 agitation, the Indonesian Parlia-
 ment on 23 May recommended. to
 President Sukarno that the MPRS
 be convened on 1 .Tune.  In a pub-
 lic  statement the same day Gen-
 eral Suharto stated that the
 MPRS would meet "sometime" in
 June,.  The regime hopes to use
 the session to discredit Sukarno
 further and possibly to rescind
 his  life-time  term of  office.
 Peking is attempting fro make
 propaganda capital out of the
 continuing anti-Chinese atmos-
 phere in Indonesia.  Lurid atroc-
 ity stories are being given wide
 dissemination and "indignation
 rallies" have been held in a
 half-dozen Chinese cities.  To
 discredit the new anti-Communist
 government in Djakarta and im-
 prove China's image among Chinese
 in Southeast Asia, Peking also
 appears to be making preparations
 to repatriate some Overseas Chi-
 nese from Indonesia.  In a note
 on l8 May, Peking announced it
 would send ships to Indonesia
 in "the near future" and proposed
 immediate bilateral talks to
 work out detailed repatriation
 arrangements..

 USSR PUSHES INTERNATIONAL FISHING OPERAT[ONS
 The USSR has indicated that
 it intends to continue vigorous
 expansion of its world-wide com-

 has met with protests from free
 world countries whose tradi-
 tional fishing grounds have been
 penetrated by the increasingly
 mobile Soviet fishing fleets.
 The USSR has announced
 that, during the next five years,
 it plans an increase of at least
 50 percent in the catch from its
 ocean fleet operations--which in
 1965 accounted for 80 percent of
 the 5.7-million-ton total Soviet
 catch.  The Soviets have turned

 DOMINICAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN NEARS END
 The outcome of the 1 June elec-
 tions in the Dominican Republic re-
 mains uncertain.  Joaquin Balaguer's
 campaign has picked up and many ob-
 servers feel a last-minute surge
 in his favor has brought him at
 least even with Juan Bosch.  The
 outcome may well depend on such
 imponderables as the weather, which
 could prevent many pro-Balaguer
 rural voters from reaching the polls.
 On the whole the campaign has been
 rather dull and neither candidate
 has seemed to generate great enthu-
 siasm except among hard-core back-
 ers.
 Balaguer's energetic stumping
 throughout the country during re-
 cent weeks has given the campaign
 of his Reformist Party (PR) a boost.
 He has sought to reinforce his image
 as a candidate of moderation who will
 place primary emphasis on restoring.
 law and order.  He cited the April
 1965 revolt, which he called "es-
 sentially negative," as proof of
 the futility of all violence.
 In addition to the emphasis on
 stability, Balaguer `s campaign
 speeches have contained grandiose
 promises of benefits to the rural
 peasant and urban poor.  In each
 town he has visited Balaguer has
 promised  ptablic works  to benefit
 the locality.
 Balaguer's entourage has
 stepped up its attempts to link
 Bosch with Communism.  Last week
 Balaguer's running mate said Bosch's
 election would lead to a repetition
 of the Cuban experience in the Do-
 minican Republic.
 Balaguer has continued his re-
 fusal to make a deal with "third
 force" presidential candidate Ra-25X1
 fael Bonnelly and has succeeded
 in wooing Bonnell  su  orters to
 his candidac .
 ~~ Other Bonnelly-supporters
 h~.ave already announced their
 switch in allegiance.  Bonnelly
 may still announce his withdrawal
 from the race at-the last minute.
 Bosch continues to proclaim
 the imminent victory of his party
 but other statements suggest his
 c,onf idence  maybe  shaky .     He
 seems to be laying the groundwork
 f'or a possible refusal to accept
 defeat by claiming his supporters
 a~,re being subjected to bribery
 a~.nd intimidation.
 Sporadic campaign skirmishes
 between opposing political fac-
 tions continue to occur.  The most
 ~~erious was what PR members claim
 was an ambush of Balaguer`s cam-
 Iaaign caravan in the eastern town
 of La Romano on 19 May.  Political
 passions will probably heat up
 during the last-days of the cam-
 ~~aign and some scattered inci-
 dents are likely to take place on
 Election day.  Nevertheless, the
 elections should be reasonably
 i'ree of fraud and violence-since
 I~rovisional President Garcia
 C~adoy, top ranking security force
 commanders, and the Central Elec-
 i;ion-Board are determined to make
 i.t so.

 POLITICAL CONFLICT CASES OUSTER OF BRAZILIAN ARMY COMMANDER
 General Justino Alves Bastos
 was relieved of command of Bra-
 zil's Third Army on 19 May ap-
 parently because of an intemper-
 ate public speech in Pvrto Alegre
 an 17 May in which he strongly
 criticized President Castello
 Branco's policies.  In his speech,
 Alves Bastos appealed to the press
 to fight against establishment
 of a dictatorship of the right
 now that the danger of a dicta-
 torship of the left had been
 eliminated.  He called the elec-
 toral domicile law a "monstros-
 ity" and severely criticized the
 government's economic and finan-
 cial policies.
 Alves Bastos' frequently
 expressed desire to be governor
 of Rio Grande do Sul has been
 frustrated by the domicile law,
 which requires a candidate to
 have been a state resident for
 at least two years.  Both Alves
 Bastos and Se-cond Army commander
 General Amaury Kruel, who has
 aspired to be governor of Sao
 Paulo, have been pressing the
 government to change the law,
 Both generals had important roles
 in the overthrow of the Goulart
 regime in 1964.
 General Kruel, although he
 has denied supporting Alves Bas-
 tos, has been closely associated
 with his position.
 Bastos has been replaced
 by General Orlando Geisel, the
 army's chief of personnel, a
 competent officer who will prob-
 ably reduce the Third Army's
 involvement in southern Brazil-
 ian polities.  The smoothness
 with which the change of com-
 mand was carried out indicates
 that neither the move against
 Bastos nor one against Krue1
 will affect stability. .The po-
 litical aspirations of bath arE

 COMMUN l ST EFFORTS TO UNIFY UF,UGUAYAN -LABOR MOVEMENT
 Unless economic conditions
 improve or effective opposition
 to Communist initiatives devel-
 ops, the Uruguayan Communist
 Party (PCU) is likely soon to
 organize and control a unified
 Uruguayan labor confederation.
 On 21 May the heavily Com-
 munist-influenced Center of Uru-
 guayan Workers concluded a five-
 day congress, with representa-
 tives in attendance from most na-
 tional and many international
 labor organizations.  The con-
 gress, trading on genuine worker
 grievances and widespread na=
 ivete' concerning Communist in-
 tentions and capabilities, re-
 ceived support from independent
 unions as well.  It planned
 strategy for "future struggles"
 to solve Uruguay's recurrent
 economic crises and called for
 creation of a unified labor move-
 ment..  Communist domination of
 this key sector would increase
 the danger of crippling strikes
 and labor agitation and pose a
 long-range threat to national
 stability.
 Most non-Communist labor
 leaders are committed to unify-
 ing the labor movement and ap-
 parently hope that a confedera-
 tion can be kept from falling
 under PCU domination..  There is
 little to prevent this, however,
 because only the PCU appears
 able to guide and manipulate
 such a federation and is plainly
 determined to do so.  Leadership
 of the prodemocratic unions is
 scarce, divided, and self-seeking.
 Although most Uruguayan
 workers traditionally vote for
 one of the two large democratic
 political parties, there. has
 bE~en a continuing turn toward
 Communists or pro-Communists
 f~~r labor leadership because
 they produce results.  The PCU
 a:Lready controls Uruguay's two
 l;~rgest labor federations, but
 h;~,s  newer  been able  to  trans-
 l;~,te  this  control  into  votes.
 T'he Communists have, however,
 apparently managed to secure
 enough signatures to put their
 constitutional reform project
 for reorganizing the national
 government on November's? ballot.
 Recent successes in union
 elections indicate-that the
 Communist Party is gaining
 strength at the expense of non-
 communists.  Tlie PCU has con-
 centrated-its efforts- on key
 unions, such as those represent-
 ing transport and government
 employees, which it has used to
 paralyze government and private
 economic activity with strikes.
 Communist and pro-Communist
 labor leaders have astutely ex-
 ploited the worker's feeling
 that he is bearing the brunt of
 the government's attempts to
 stabilize the economy.  This ap-
 proach may be even more success-
 ful if a recently concluded
 =standby agreement with the In-
 ternational Monetary Fund re-
 =~ults in a further decline in
 consumer purchasing power.

 ECUADOR'S VELASCO RETURNS TO POL[T[CAL SCENE
 Former Ecuadorean president
 Velasco returned to Guayaquil from
 exile on 24 May and, despite minor
 opposition demonstrations, spoke
 with vigor to a small crowd esti-
 mated at 7,000.  He depreciated
 the Communist threat and-told his
 audience that a fifth presidential
 term for him would cure all the
 nation's ills.  Velasco was fol-
 lowed on the platform by his ex-
 tremist henchman, Manuel Aratijo
 Hidalgo, who demanded a revolu-
 tion "even if we are described as
 Communists," and concluded by ask-
 ing interim President Yerovi to
 step down in favor of Velasco.
 To thwart Velasco, the gov-
 ernmen-t has approved the armed
 forces" new antisubversion plan,
 but the military have yet to evi-
 dence a firm plan to oppose Velasco
 openly if he should try to grab
 power with mob support.
 Velasco may attempt to gain
 office legally by agitating for
 direct election of the next presi-
 dent.  The government has issued
 a call for the convening of a
 constituent assembly on 3 November
 to which Yerovi would deliver
 power.  Most politicians favor
 having the assembly name the next
 president in order to frustrate
 Velasco's hope of a popular elec-
 toral triumph.
 The course Velasco takes
 should become clearer after the
 28 May convention, since by then
 he presumably will have assessed
 the extent of his support among
 the masses and the military.
