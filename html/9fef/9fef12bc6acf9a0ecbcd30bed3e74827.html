FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
VIETNAM 
There is near unanimous agreement 
among senior South Vietnamese civilian 
and military officials that President 
Thieu's decision to resign was a good 
one and that a new government should 
be formed immediately to attempt to 
arrange negotiations with the commu-
nists. Nguyen Ba Can 
would resign and 
assist in any way possible to form a 
new cabinet. Beyond this, however, 
there are few specifics on what form 
the new government will take or who 
will serve in it. 
General "Big" Minh, probably the leading can-
didate to head a new cabinet, is calling for a new 
government, which would include staunch anti-Thieu 
members of the Catholic and Buddhist opposition 
groups. Former vice president Ky wants to lead a 
new government, which would include General Vien, 
the chairman of the Joint General Staff, and former 
prime minister Khiem. 
There is also some 
maneuvering in the Senate to replace Tran Van Lam 
with Buddhist leader Vu Van Mau to allow Mau to 
become president when Huong resigns. 
The South Vietnamese foreign ministry today 
called for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations 
without preconditions for a political settlement. 
The communists immediately rejected the pro-
posal, however, and their reaction to Thieu's re-
signation provides no encouragement for the prospects 
of meaningful negotiations. The Viet Cong's Pro-
visional Revolutionary Government dismissed Thieu's 
departure as a "clumsy and deceptive trick." Hanoi's 
radio and party daily, Nhan Dan, focused on the 
continuation of American support for the new govern-
ment and stated that the US in effect had replaced 
one loser with another. The North Vietnamese com-
mentaries also gave considerable attention to the 
withdrawal of Americans from South Vietnam. They 
stated that all Americans could be evacuated "in a 
very short time, even in one day, without any dif-
ficulty or obstacle." They went on to condemn 
strongly US expressions of concern about communist 
reprisals and warned against any US effort to evacu-
ate large numbers of South Vietnamese. US naval

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
vessels moving toward South Vietnamese waters, it 
was stated, are far more than would be needed simply 
to evacuate Americans. 
In short, the communists are continuing to de-
mand a totally new South Vietnamese government and 
a quick and total US withdrawal as the price for a 
negotiated surrender. At least in their public com-
mentary, there is no hint of give in their position, 
but there is the clear implication that time is 
quickly running out. 
The level of communist shellings and ground 
attacks has fallen off sharply as both sides appear 
to be getting ready for the next round. The only 
significant military action yesterday was the re-
opening of Route 22 south of Tay Ninh city, which 
allowed the remainder of the South Vietnamese 25th 
Division to withdraw from Tay Ninh city to govern-
ment lines nearer Saigon. 
A South Vietnamese estimate of communist inten-
tions and capabilities as of April 22 indicates that 
the current lull in military activity is only to 
permit the communists time to prepare their forces 
and coordinate plans to launch simultaneous attacks 
on Saigon and Bien Hoa. The estimate of the ability 
of the government forces to resist the final thrust 
toward the capital city is bleak. 
if the attack is well coordinated, the 
government's defenses could crumble in a matter of 
hours. 
The estimate views Saigon's remaining forces 
as battle-weary and understrength and unlikely to 
make a determined stand. Many South Vietnamese pi-
lots are believed ready to fly out of the country, 
and the military planners are not counting heavily 
on their support in a final battle. It is also ex-
pected that most of the territorial forces, police, 
and many of the regular soldiers will desert to 
look after their families. 
Reports of communist plans to move on Saigon 
include a coordinated attack of artillery, armor, 
sappers, and infantry against the city's Tan Son 
Nhut airbase. 
 the plan calls for a three-
pronged attack against the base from the north, 
west, and southwest. The attacking force could in-
clude the North Vietnamese 9th Division, which has 
moved into position for an assault on Saigon from 
the west.

The communists also are moving on Saigon from 
the east in strength, following the abandonment of 
Xuan Loc by government forces. The communist plans 
apparently call for thrusts toward Vung Tau as well 
as direct moves at Bien Hoa and Saigon. The conso-
lidation of forces and the steady overrunning of 
government field positions to the southwest of Sai-
gon suggest the communists are about ready to move 
at least three divisions up the Route 4 corridor--
the southwestern approach to Saigon. 
The North Vietnamese are also moving their 
air defense units closer to Saigon. 
communists have moved an antiaircraft 
fire control radar to within eight miles of Tan Son 
Nhut airbase. Several transport aircraft were fired 
upon yesterday near Tan Son Nhut but none were 
damaged. 
The North Vietnamese may soon reopen additional 
airfields in central South Vietnam. Communist ground 
units were ordered in an April 21 message not to 
fire on "our aircraft" which will be active at a 
number of southern airfields. The message did not 
specify the types of aircraft, but helicopters and 
transports probably will be the first to use the 
southern bases. Such aircraft have been flying into 
Phu Bai and Da Nang airfields on a daily basis for 
the past two weeks or so.

CAMBODIA 
In recorded statements carried by 
Phnom Penh radio yesterday, Defense Min-
ister and Deputy Prime Minister Khieu 
Samphan and Information Minister Hu Nimm 
congratulated insurgent forces for "final 
victory.. .in the people's war" and thanked 
foreign allies for their support. The two 
leaders called for "national unity" to 
build an "independent, neutral, nonaligned, 
and prosperous" Cambodia, but omitted any 
specific mention of reconciliation with, 
or amnesty for, those who fought or served 
on the side of the former government. 
There are indications that the communists are 
moving ruthlessly against former government of
and Cambodian army officers in at least some 
parts of the country. 
There is no evidence so far that the commu-
nists are carrying out mass reprisals against the 
civilian population. A number of messages, in 
fact, have warned occupation forces against actions 
that would alienate the civilians. Nonetheless, 
communist forces in Battambang city--and presumably 
in other recently "liberated" urban centers--are 
segregating the population according to "class," 
a move which probably portends at least a period 
of indoctrination and "re-education."

There is still no firm evidence as to the fate 
of senior figures captured by the communists in 
Phnom Penh, but most westerners in the capital are 
safe. Six UN staff members got word out yesterday 
that they were in the French embassy compound--the 
only foreign installation still operating in the 
capital. Twenty-six foreign journalists, including 
five US newsmen, are also there. The mood in Phnom 
Penh, however, appears to be far from hospitable. 
,Prince Sihanouk still shows no sign of pre-
paring to leave Peking. 
  Most 
of the Prince's information is apparently coming 
from press services in Peking.

CHINA 
Strains in Peking's relations with 
Hanoi have become more evident in recent 
weeks. 
The rapid South Vietnamese military collapse, 
coupled with the Cambodian insurgents' victory, ap-
pears to have forced the Chinese to come to grips 
with problems they probably would have preferred 
to postpone. The Chinese seem to fear that Hanoi 
may extend its hegemony over Cambodia and Laos as 
well as South Vietnam. Peking also is wary of the 
possibility that Moscow will expand its influence 
in the area. 
Speeches by Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and 
Defense Minister Yeh Chieng-ying at separate func-
tions in Peking over the weekend reflect the high 
level of Chinese concern over Hanoi's intentions. 
Both referred to the importance of the Paris Agree-
ment--a theme the North Vietnamese recently have 
been downplaying--and Teng pledged Chinese support 
to the South Vietnamese communists in their efforts 
to "defend their national rights." 
Moreover, throughout the ceremonies surround-
ing the visit of North Korean President Kim Il-song 
and the celebrations of the insurgent victory in 
Cambodia, there was a notable absence of any refer-
ence to Hanoi's role in recent Indochina develop-
ments. While the oversight is probably in part 
related to the fiction that only South Vietnamese 
are engaged in the fighting there, it is neverthe-
less striking that the Chinese failed to mention 
Hanoi during ceremonies that were intended to demon-
strate Asian "revolutionary unity." 
It is clear that Peking is concerned that Hanoi 
will now move promptly to unify Vietnam. Given 
Chinese concern that the North Vietnamese regime has 
tilted in the direction of Moscow, Peking probably 
hopes that reunification will be postponed until 
well in the future. The Chinese almost certainly 
recognize, however, that they can do little to 
thwart Hanoi on the reunification issue.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
Chinese leaders also appear to be working ear-
nestly to maximize Peking's influence over the new 
Cambodia government, as well as to limit both North 
Vietnamese and Soviet influence. By playing up the 
importance of their long-time ally Prince Sihanouk, 
the Chinese are clearly indicating that they hope 
the Prince will play an important role in the new 
government. The relationship appears to be recipro-
cal at this juncture. Sihanouk's Prime Minister 
Sarin Chhak has emphasized the importance--both past 
and future--of Chinese assistance to Cambodia, re-
ferring specifically to a recent statement attrib-
uted to Mao that the Chinese would stand by the Cam-
bodian people "in the struggles ahead." The impli-
cation is that these "struggles" may involve the 
Vietnamese and perhaps the Soviets. 
The Chinese have 
about their influence 
probably believe they 
some of the Cambodian 
Vietnamese hostility.  
long appeared to have doubts 
with the Khmer communists, but 
are in position to exploit 
rebel leaders' latent anti-
  The Chinese certainly be-
lieve that some Khmer communists are oriented pri-
marily toward Hanoi. 
Both Teng and Yeh decried Soviet actions with 
regard to Cambodia. Yeh pointed out that Moscow 
had maintained diplomatic ties with the "Lon Nol 
clique" after Sihanouk's ouster and that it had 
changed its tune only at the last moment. Despite 
this, the Chinese are concerned, perhaps somewhat 
irrationally, that recent developments in Indochina 
will work to Moscow's advantage. 
The North Vietnamese themselves seem to antic-
ipate increasing difficulties in their relations 
with Peking, at least so far as Cambodia is con-
cerned.

OPEC 
Holdings of US assets by OPEC coun-
tries jumped from $2.7 billion at the end 
of 1973 to an estimated $14.5 billion at 
the end of 1974. Last December, US hold-
ings made up 20 percent of OPEC foreign 
assets, compared with 13 percent a year 
earlier. 
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Kuwait, and 
Iran accounted for 85 percent ?of OPEC's US assets 
as of December 1974. The composition of their US 
assets differed substantially: 
Saudi Arabia held about 50 percent in govern-
ment securities, half of which were medium and 
long term. 
Venezuela kept more than 90 percent in bank 
deposits, mostly time deposits. 
Nigeria placed about .95 percent in short-..term 
government securities. 
Kuwait held almost 45 percent in the form of 
eTITITTIes, real estate loans, and corporate. 
bonds. 
Iran placed 90 percent in short-term assets, 
divided about equally between government se-
curities and bank deposits. 
Among OPEC members, Indonesia and Venezuela 
had the largest share of their assets in the US, 67 
percent and 41 percent respectively. Holdings by 
Algeria, Ecuador, and Qatar were negligible. 
The flow of OPEC investment almost certainly 
will decline during most of 1975, as demand for oil 
remains weak and the oil-producing countries con-
tinue to boost imports. OPEC's available surplus 
for 1975 as a whole will approximate $55 billion, 
compared with $58 billion in 1974. The US should 
attract a substantial portion of these funds in 
spite of the recent decline in US interest rates 
relative to rates in Europe and the drop in the 
value of the dollar. Barring a serious deteriora-
tion* in Arab-US political relations, OPEC states 
probably will invest another $10 billion in the US 
in 1975, raising their US holdings to $25 billion.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The Arab for-
eign ministers, who 
met in Cairo Mon-
day, agreed to form 
a technical commit-
tee to investigate 
Iraq's charge that 
,yria is withhold-
sng water from the 
Euphrates River. 
Syria acknowl-
edges that it took 
this step in March 
to retaliate for 
Baghdad's apparent 
involvement in a 
recent attempt to 
overthrow President 
NOTES 
Asad. 
the Syrian action is affecting 
2 to 3 million people in the river valley. 
both Syria and Iraq are mov-
ing military units to the border area. While the 
Syrians are said to fear Iraq will try to sabotage 
the Euphrates Dam, 
the Iraqis might try to seize the 
oil and gas fields in northeastern Syria. 
The West European states, although disappointed 
at the breakdown of the producer/consumer talks in 
Paris last week, believe the oil-consuming nations 
could not have made further concessions to the 
Algerian-Zed coalition of oil-producing and develop-
ing states. 
Some of the West European states--West Germany 
in particular--maintain that Algeria had intended 
from the start to bring about a collapse of the 
talks and was more interested in bolstering its 
claim to leadership of the Third World than in se-
rious negotiations. The British and Dutch feel 
that the failure of the French-sponsored meeting 
will strengthen the International Energy Agency. 
France has indicated that it will continue to work 
with the agency.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
The North Koreans are taking steps to strengthen 
their naval forces near South Korean waters and are 
increasing their naval exercises and training. We 
have no evidence that Pyongyang is planning aggres-
sive moves against the South, but North Korea's navy 
is now better prepared to respond to any further in-
cidents near the disputed islands off the west coast. 
With 18 guided-missile boats and eight torpedo 
attack submarines, the navy is the North's only mil-
itary service with a clear superiority over its 
Southern counterpart. Seoul's navy currently lacks 
both missile boats and submarines, and no South Ko-
rean ship can match the firepower of the 20 to 25-
nautical-mile-range Styx missiles carried by North-
ern missile boats. 
Honduran Chief of State Lopez, buffeted by the 
impact of a major scandal and the determined oppo-
sition of a group of reform-minded lieutenant colo-
nels, was ousted yesterday by the Superior Defense 
Council. 
His replacement, armed forces commander Juan 
Alberto Melgar, is likely to play only a temporary 
figurehead role because of his past close associa-
tion with Lopez and because the ascendant lieuten-
ant colonels have not yet agreed on a member of 
their own group to replace him. These officers re-
sent the image of their country as a corrupt and 
backward "Banana Republic" and are determined to 
promote economic development and agrarian reform. 
They can be expected to maintain Honduras' close 
ties with the US.
