 Decision Making: The System

 Key Judgments      The Philippine economy faces a difficult decade. The outlook for foreign-
 lnformation available                             exchange-earning agricultural crops is poor, and the country faces a rapid
 as of 18 February 1983 rise in the labor force at a time when increasing obligations on its foreign
 was used in this report.
 debt-which now exceeds $17 billion-will make it difficult to provide
 investment funds to create jobs.
 The ability of the Philippines to weather these economic challenges will
 depend in large measure on the efficacy of the economic decision making
 structure. The strengths of Manila's decisionmaking system include:
 ? President Marcos's willingness to consult an honest and generally
 competent staff of technocrats when the economy is under stress.
 ? Marcos's strong political skills and relatively secure short-term political
 position, which permit him considerable latitude in formulating economic
 policy.
 ? Manila's recognition of its dependence on foreign capital and a good
 long-term relationship with the international financial institutions.
 At the same time, the system has weaknesses that could prove troublesome
 in the years ahead. These include:
 ? The nonconfrontational style of Philippine policymaking, which permits
 more assertive ministries undue influence in the design of policy and
 produces a weak chain of command in long-term policy planning.
 ? Insufficient policy coordination, which produces internal inconsistencies
 in balance-of-payments management.
 ? Nationalism among the technocrats, which compromises financial plan-
 ning by limiting foreign investment.
 ? The prominence of business interests close to the President, which
 compromises financial and industrial policy by undercutting the decisions
 of the technocrats)
 On balance, Manila's management is unlikely either to improve the
 performance of the economy dramatically or to produce economic crisis.
 This judgment could change, however, if Manila fails to follow up on plans
 to curb the growth of public-sector equity capital contributions to the
 private sector-thus expanding the government's portfolio of financially
 troubled firms. Over the short term, the technocrats' approach to exchange
 rate policy will be the key to avoiding financial crisis. Failure to allow
 sufficient depreciation of the peso could produce even more severe balance-
 of-payments strains than the country now faces.

 The Economic Decision Making Apparatus
 Question: "What three parties run the Philippines? "
 Answer: "Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos,
 and the International Monetary Fund. "
 (Joke making the rounds in Manila)
 Balance-of-payments strains and sluggish growth
 since 1980 have rapidly shifted the process of econom-
 ic policy formulation in the Philippines in favor of two
 groups: the technocrats-led by Prime Minister (and
 Finance Minister) Cesar Virata-who collectively run
 the key government policymaking agencies, and inter-
 national financial institutions-headed by the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund and the World Bank-that
 require changes in economic policy in exchange for
 continuing balance-of-payments support.' The spon-
 sorship of the Fund and the Bank and the advocacy of
 the technocrats account almost exclusively for recent
 trends in economic policy.
 Three other institutional interests influence economic
 policy. The most important are the politically well-
 connected-especially business interests close to Pres-
 ident Marcos-who collectively manage most process-
 ing industries for primary commodities. Government
 ministries and state enterprises outside the control of
 key technocrats. also have numerous policy responsi-
 bilities and comprise the rest of the government
 decisionmaking patchwork. Outside of government,
 several private think tanks and lobbying groups are
 prominent advocates of various approaches to eco-
 nomic strategy. Although they have been especially
 active during the past few years stimulating a lively
 public intellectual debate about policy, they hold
 widely divergent views and do not present a united
 front.
 How the Marcos System Works
 Manila's actual policymaking is the product of inter-
 action among the individual players. US Embassy and
 intelligence reporting since the early 1970s shows that
 Marcos favors a collegial style of decisionmaking in
 which he reads numerous position papers prepared by
 his staff. Though it is often difficult to tell how
 actively he is involved in the economic policy process,
 we are certain that all major decisions require his
 approval. Less critical decisions are determined by the
 relative influence Marcos awards key coordinating
 agencies in the decisionmaking system.
 The current decisionmaking framework is the product
 of constitutional amendments of Marcos's own design
 that closely followed the dismantling of martial law in
 January 1981. The executive branch was reorganized
 along the lines of the French-style strong presidential
 system. Marcos's choice of Virata as Prime Minister
 was dictated, we believe, largely by economic events
 at the time-especially the ongoing financial crisis.
 Assessing the Technocrats' Performance. Aside from
 its managerial competence, the gang of four's chief
 strength is its reputation for being apolitical and

 honest. Several are extremely wealthy, but none has
 vested interests that compromise policymaking. Mar-
 cos has even claimed he is grooming Virata for a
 possible role as successor, though most astute political
 observers doubt the Prime Minister's political acu-
 men.
 Their record indicates that the technocrats bring to
 policymaking a healthy pragmatism and the will to
 resist tailoring their judgments to what the President
 would like to hear. Virata and Ongpin, unlike many
 other presidential advisers, are candid with Marcos,
 They are also willing to confront entrenched economic
 interests when they believe the integrity of policy is at
 stake and are thus ideally suited to the role of
 engineers of economic and social policy reform. They
 have long been advocates of overhauling government
 trade and industrial policy, for example.
 The technocrats are adept at using their excellent
 international reputations to bolster confidence in the
 government's policies. Laya, for example, is credited
 by international bankers with saving the country from
 financial calamity with ad hoc measures in 1981. We
 believe the lynchpin of his strategy was successfully
 shifting blame for the crisis onto a financier who had
 fled the country, while Manila defended the peso in
 the face of an estimated $800 million in capital flight.
 As a result, the government's international credit
 rating remained unblemished, and Manila bought
 valuable time in which to implement a financial
 rescue operation.
 Though their prominence has unquestionably im-
 proved policymaking, in our judgment the gang of
 four has weaknesses that prevent them from living up
 to the image Manila has created in the eyes of private
 foreign bankers. We believe the formulation and
 execution of policy are slow, so the policy response
 lags changes in international economic trends. In
 addition, uneven administrative performances impair
 policy coordination. Even though he heads the tech-
 nocracy, Virata's record suggests that he is among the
 least dynamic of its members. Meanwhile, Ongpin in
 our judgment has developed into an empire builder,
 reflecting his training as a manager rather than as an

 market left the private sector without short-term
 financing and the existing government decisionmak-
 ing apparatus with severely damaged credibility both
 at home and abroad. Best known among them is a
 group respectfully referred to within government as
 "the gang offour'-Prime Minister and Minister of
 Finance Virata, Central Bank Governor Jaime Laya,
 Minister of Trade and Industry Roberto Ongpin, and
 Planning Minister Placido Mapa (see appendix A for
 personal profiles). Through their individual minis-
 tries, they are jointly responsible for budget manage-
 ment and fiscal policy, exchange rate and trade
 policy, investment regulation and industrial policy,
 money supply control and financial regulation, devel-
 opment planning, and economic policy coordination.
 Except for Virata, the technocrats are young and less
 tradition bound than their predecessors.
 A background of training in US graduate schools and
 a strong inclination towards nationalism mark the
 technocrats' intellectual makeup. We believe all rec-
 ognize the strength of market forces in designing
 policy, but all are essentially Keynesian in philosoph-
 ical outlook. Thus, fiscal policy designed to boost
 domestic spending is consistently an element in their
 policy design along with a preference for prices set by
 market forces. According to many Philippine govern-
 ment officials, the technocrats see this approach as a
 way of reducing the role of influence and corruption
 in the daily running of the economy, thereby increas-
 ing economic efficiency.
 In our judgment, nationalism rather than laissez
 faire, however, rules the technocrats' decisions on
 financial planning. We believe Manila's current cor-
 porate rescue program is designed largely to keep
 management in Filipino hands while improving cor-
 porate efficiency, because the technocrats regard for-
 eign investment as competition for indigenous entre-
 preneurs. When the investment treaty governing US
 investments expired in 1974, for example, Virata as
 Minister of Finance successfully lobbied for a foreign
 borrowing program to fuel development rather than
 to liberalize foreign investment regulations. The
 country's foreign investment procedures remain
 among the most complicated in Southeast Asia, as a
 result, according to US Embassy officials.
 The Official Creditors
 Though executed by the technocrats, the most far-
 reaching changes in domestic economic policy since
 1979 have been undertaken at the insistence of the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
 the country's two leading creditors. The Philippines is
 among several developing countries engaged in a
 jointly sponsored IMF-World Bank industrial re-
 structuring program requiring adjustments in tariffs,
 interest rates, foreign exchange controls, and ex-
 change rate policy-combined with limits on growth
 of the money supply and on foreign borrowing. Pro-
 fessional journal articles and academic treatises by
 technocrats less influential than the current group
 show that they advocated similar measures during
 the early 1970s. In exchange for policy reform,
 initially resisted by the government because of antici-
 pated objections from the politically powerful private
 sector, Manila is receiving credits from the Fund and
 up to $850 million in World Bank loans covering
 1981-85 to modernize key industries.
 The Well Connected
 Economic oligarchs have run key sectors of the
 economy-ensuring operational control and policy
 influence for the well connected. Through control of
 state enterprises, personal associates of Marcos set
 policy in two critical agricultural sectors, the sugar
 and coconut industries, which provide income for an
 estimated half the population. Sugar production,
 processing, financing, and marketing are controlled
 by former Ambassador to Japan Roberto Benedicto,
 and similar activities in the enormous coconut indus-
 try are controlled by National Assemblyman
 Eduardo Cojuangco and Defense Minister Juan
 Ponce-Enrile. The Ministry of Agriculture has no
 role, even as a coordinating agency.

 Marcos has relied on other political allies to develop
 the domestic construction, finance, and heavy indus-
 tries, thereby constraining, in our judgment, the
 latitude of important government ministries in setting
 financial and industrial policy. This intensifies the
 charges by political opponents of cronyism and cor-
 ruption. Manila's decision to provide up to $650
 million in financial assistance to failing private firms
 in early 1981 was criticized by less influential busi-
 nessmen who claimed that financial policy was com-
 promised to bail out friends of the President. Most
 businessmen, however, according to US Embassy
 officials, believed Manila had little choice but to
 intervene to prevent the economic dislocation that
 would have resulted from a string of corporate bank-
 ruptcies. Moreover, the government required stream-
 lining and management reorganizations as precondi-
 tions for financial assistance and injections of
 public-sector equity capital. As a result, one promi-
 nent US banker told US Embassy officials in July
 1982 that cronyism had been reduced.
 Key Players in the Public Debate
 Over Economic Policy
 Best known of the research groups is the privately
 funded Center for Research and Communications
 (CRC). Largely a consultant to investors, the CRC
 nevertheless publishes widely on national policy mat-
 ters and economic trends, providing the government
 an informal indicator of the private sector's expecta-
 tions and preferences on policy. The CRCs publica-
 tions show that it has been supportive of the techno-
 crats and their policies and has occasionally
 criticized Marcos. It has advocated limiting the role
 of government and avoiding the development of an
 industrial policy it refers to as "lemon socialism-
 keeping inefficient firms afloat with publicfunds. The
 CRC has told US Embassy officials that the role of
 cronyism in diluting policy formulation is on the
 wane.
 The CRCs only direct ties to the government are
 informal contacts with presidential assistant Alejan-
 dro Melchor. Some US Embassy officials believe,
 moreover, that the CRC has succumbed to political
 pressures recently by altering the conclusions of its
 research to make them more acceptable to the gov-
 ernment. For this reason, we believe the CRCs value
 in the policy debate is declining.
 A group of leading businessmen known as The Ma-
 kati Business Club has tried to develop its own
 dialogue with the government. Established in mid-
 1982, the club's chief purpose is to persuade Manila
 to improve the integration of the private sector in
 national development as a way of defusing political
 instability and halting the country's economic slide.
 Its plan calls for the adoption of a labor-intensive
 growth strategy, deregulation of key industries, accel-
 erated land reform, and a halt to state capitalism.
 The club, which includes businessmen with ties to
 Marcos's political opposition, has been critical of
 government corruption and inefficiency, cronyism,
 limits to free expression in the media, and even the
 technocrats because of the current trend toward
 larger government. US Embassy reports and press
 coverage reveal that the government has been toler-
 ant-if not always receptive-to the club's views,
 which have been repeated with increasing frequency
 as the economy performs poorly and the rural Com-
 munist insurgency expands.
 Among several persuasive lobbying organizations is
 the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry
 (PCCI), a group of manufacturing interests heavily
 oriented toward the domestic market. The PCCI
 takes positions reflecting its own interests on a wide
 variety of issues, ranging from domestic energy prices
 to interest rate policy. Most of its recent energies
 have been focused on opposing the IMF- and World
 Bank-sponsored economic liberalization program. It
 has taken its case aggressively and persuasively to
 the press, and we believe it is taken seriously by
 government officials.

 times placed too many loans in the international
 capital market at once, making potential lenders
 nervous and occasionally aborting the borrowing plans
 of state agencies. The board's efforts to develop local
 capital markets by reforming financial regulations
 have sometimes been at odds with growing govern-
 ment deficits, which have soaked up an increasing
 share of national savings even as reforms in financial
 regulations were implemented to stimulate savings.
 Last year, for example, the public-sector deficit
 reached 4.2 percent of GNP, and the sector accounted
 for over half the economy's net credit creation. In our
 judgment, economic nationalism has also compro-
 mised financial planning by limiting the role of
 foreign investment in tapping new sources of capital.
 We believe the budget process has become unwieldy
 under Virata and Budget Minister Manuel Alba, who
 have yet to adapt the process to the recent growth of
 public-sector investment spending.' Last year imple-
 menting ministries and state corporations prepared

 Development Authority (NEDA), which resets devel-
 opment priorities every five years, and Planning Min-
 ister Mapa, who is the only formally trained econo-
 mist among the technocrats, have lost influence
 recently to the Ministry of Trade and Industry be-
 cause of Ongpin's aggressiveness. NEDA's chief role
 is that of coordinator between the Central Bank and
 key ministries. The coordination process is described
 by NEDA officials as "consensus seeking" and non-
 confrontational, and, for this reason, we believe the
 chain of planning authority is weak.
 Recent Developments. Even at the height of Virata's
 authority, economic policy has emerged only after
 continued battles between the technocrats and well-
 connected interests that control key sectors of the
 policy battles, however, suggests to us that the techno-
 crats are prevailing over crony interests more fre-
 quently than they did during the 1970s.
 The most widely reported and controversial contest
 over the past several years has concerned the coconut
 levy-a tax on processed coconut that finances a price
 stabilization scheme for farmers. Several financial
 institutions run by Eduardo Cojuangco administer the
 program, and the scheme has financed industry con-
 solidation under an umbrella organization controlled
 by Cojuangco and Enrile. Worried by the rapid
 growth of the Communist insurgency in the coconut-
 growing regions in late 1981, Virata persuaded Mar-
 cos to drop the levy in favor of higher prices for
 farmers. Industry management prevailed several
 months later to have the levy reinstated, however,
 Virata
 threatened to resign. In January 1982 he persuaded
 Marcos to "float" the levy on a sliding scale dictated
 by international prices, and later in the year succeed-
 ed in suspending the levy completely when prices fell

 to be rekindled when international prices again rise. In the
 meantime Marcos has chosen to help the severely depressed
 coconut industry with other policies, including a privately admin-
 The President has also allowed the technocrats to
 have their way recently on a variety of other matters.
 The business empires of Marcos allies Herminio
 Disini, Rodolfo Cuenca, and Ricardo Silverio have
 been reorganized, despite their objections, under tech-
 nocrat management to achieve economic efficiency.
 Ongpin was also successful in 1981 in a bid to scale
 back the controversial and publicly financed gasahol
 program to be directed by Roberto Benedicto. There
 remain limits to the technocrats' power, however. For
 example, Virata's $2.4 billion ceiling on the country's    25X1
 foreign borrowing for 1982 was breached by govern-
 ment guaranteed foreign loans secured, by private
 corporations receiving government financial assis-
 tance.
 On balance, we believe the strength of Virata's politi-
 cal position-and perhaps eventually his ability to
 make economic policy independently of political pres-
 sure-has eroded since early 1982. His relationship to
 Imelda Marcos a political ower in her own ri ht is
 tenuous.
 When Marcos appointed his
 wife to the Executive Committee in August 1982,
 against his pledge to Virata that he would not do so,
 Virata's prestige suffered considerably,
 The Executive Committee
 under Virata's leadership, moreover, has yet to con-
 sider its first sensitive political or economic issue.
 The Decade Ahead: A Notional
 View of Economic Policy
 The Necessity for Choosing Wisely. In our judgment,
 Manila's economic policy making during the coming
 decade will depend critically on the degree of urgency
 Marcos attaches to the economy's problems and the
 potential political fallout they may produce. We
 believe that the outlook for the economy over the next
 several years is poor and that the most formidable
 tests of Marcos's economic decision making system
 are just beginning. As a result, the technocrats are

 likely to continue as prominent actors in the policy
 arena during the next several years, and official
 creditors such as the IMF are likely to continue
 exercising substantial leverage on Manila's decisions.
 Most pressing among the economy's problems are
 those caused by a factor beyond Manila's control-
 the global recession. Manila's rescue program for the
 private sector has succeeded so far in sparing the
 economy the worst of the slowdown in international
 growth, although some sectors, especially the mining
 industry, have been hit very hard. Two long-term
 problems, in our judgment, may turn out to be more
 serious than the recession: demographics assure ex-
 tremely rapid labor force growth during the 1980s
 while the maturity structure of the foreign debt
 assures continuing balance-of-payments strains. Fur-
 thermore, the outlook for several agricultural crops,
 and thus rural incomes, is very dim, according to
 commodity forecasts (see box).
 The Broad Objectives of Policy. The World Bank
 believes the economic policy strategy embodied in the
 government's 1983-87 Development Plan is broadly
 appropriate to face these challenges. The plan identi-
 fies five key elements of economic policy for the
 1980s:
 ? Effective exploitation of development potential in
 agriculture, including food production, agro-energy
 crops, and export crops.
 ? Industrial development to exploit industries in
 which the country enjoys a competitive advantage,
 particularly labor-intensive enterprises, accompa-
 nied by the development of capital-intensive inter-
 mediate-good industries, such as steel and machin-
 ery, with investment risk born by the public sector.
 ? Continued development of supporting infrastructure
 for both agriculture and industry. NEDA is firmly
 committed to what its director refers to as "human
 infrastructure development," meaning the develop-
 ment of labor force skills and public health systems.
 ? Import substitution coupled with conservation mea-
 sures in the energy sector to release foreign ex-
 change for use elsewhere.
 Long-Term Constraints on Economic Policy
 Roughly half the population of 51 million is under 16
 years of age, and this group will provide the bulk of
 labor force entrants during the next 10 years. On the
 basis of likely trends in labor force participation
 rates, the World Bank projects that labor force
 growth will reach 3.7 percent annually-Asia's high-
 est. The economy will thus have to create at least
 700,000 jobs annually to prevent growing unemploy-
 ment and further deterioration in real wages. This
 would require that the rate of job creation be nearly
 doubled
 At the same time, our calculations show that interest
 payments on the foreign debt will consume about 5
 percent of GNP over the next several years without a
 dramatic drop in global interest rates. Furthermore,
 without a sharp and immediate decrease in the trade
 deficit, we estimate that annual debt service is likely
 to almost, triple to about $6 billion by the end of
 Marcos's current term in 1987. Thus foreign re-
 sources for job creation will be available only to the
 extent that new loans exceed these levels, and the new
 loans will produce a further debt service burden later
 in the decade.
 In agriculture, the price outlook for sugar and coco-
 nut is dim. Sugar faces new competition from high
 fructose corn sweeteners, and commodity specialists
 believe that international tropical cane sugar prices
 have seen their peak. Coconut oil faces competition
 from LDC suppliers of other edible oils that entered
 the market in the late 1970s. In our judgment, weak
 prices for both commodities are promoting the steady
 growth of the Communist insurgency which has oc-
 curred during the last several years-a trend Manila
 will eventually have to reverse.
 ? Greater mobilization of domestic savings through
 financial reform and more efficient use of funds
 available for investment.
 The Plan has drawn three basic criticisms. Official
 creditors, and even the Philippine National Assembly,
 have criticized it for ignoring the need for population

 planning. This, however, is unlikely to change while
 Planning Minister Mapa-a staunch Roman Catholic
 opposed to birth control-runs NEDA.' The Plan also
 contains few specifics regarding the use of individual
 policy instruments, according to the World Bank. The
 Bank has also suggested that the Plan does not
 adequately consider the costs of the expanding role of
 the public sector, as investment in state enterprises
 consumes a growing share of scarce investable re-
 sources
 Key Philosophical Choices. With the specifics of
 policy yet to be laid out, the fundamental decisions
 facing Philippine policymakers over the next decade
 will concern the choice between "crony capitalism,"
 "lemon socialism," and a more realistic approach to
 economic policy. No one, we believe, including high
 officials of the Philippine Government, knows how
 The technocrats' suggestions have yet to slow the
 momentum to larger government, however. Govern-
 ment investment in state enterprises, according to
 government data, reached 5 percent of GNP last year,
 up from 3 percent in 1978. At the same time, the
 public sector has significantly expanded its holdings
 of equity in the private sector because of the techno-
 crats' rescue program. Manila thus faces the task in
 the 1980s of divesting itself of inefficient enterprises if
 expertise provided by government financial organiza-
 tions proves insufficient to sort out their problems.
 A more awkward choice financially, in our judg-
 ment-and one more fundamental philosophically-
 may turn out to be whether to divest the public
 portfolio of sound enterprises, thus resisting the trend
 ' Marcos is also believed by US Embassy officials to use the threat
 of family planning as a trump card in his efforts to neutralize the
 to state capitalism. We believe the technocrats' na-
 tionalism and professional expertise as managers rath-
 er than economists may work against divestiture.
 Foreign investors are unlikely to be given.a prominent
 role providing capital and expertise in sectors in which
 Manila holds substantial equity, according to US.
 Embassy officials. At the same time, Ongpin's minis-
 terial track record suggests he believes that turning
 the financial corner for these firms will award the
 government a mandate to run them permanently.
 This, we believe, would virtually assure continuing
 economic problems by stifling private-sector invest-
 ment.
 In our judgment, Marcos's decisionmaking system
 must also find ways to revitalize the deteriorating
 rural economy, which will not be able to capitalize on
 the full effects of recovery in industrialized countries
 without substantial restructuring.' The shift out of
 sugar and coconut production-a stated objective of
 government agricultural experts-promises to be re-
 tarded by vested interests close to the President.
 Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture is not suffi-
 ciently influential to force the adjustment over en-
 trenched interests. A rural investment program begun
 in 1981, the $125 million National Livelihood Move-
 ment sponsored by Imelda Marcos, appears to be the
 decisionmaking system's primary response, and we
 believe it is not sufficient to offset the effects of
 otherwise weak agricultural policy.
 We believe the key indicator of the decisionmaking
 system's ability to deal with economic and financial
 strains during the next several years will be manage-
 ment of its most powerful policy instrument-the
 foreign exchange rate. We believe rising debt service
 obligations and a weak balance of trade, however, will
 demand more rapid depreciation of the peso than
 Manila has permitted in the past. The country's
 estimated $1.1 billion balance-of-payments deficit for
 1982 and the simultaneous failure of the peso to
 depreciate rapidly against currencies other than the

 defense of. the exchange rate. We believe failure to
 allow sufficient depreciation for any reason could
 produce serious foreign debt management problems
 by expanding the trade deficit and thus the demand
 for new foreign loans beyond a sustainable level of
 financing. This would also delay the development of
 labor-intensive export manufacturing at a time when
 political stability requires rapid creation of jobs.

 dent Marcos and is one of his closest and most trusted
 advisers. US Embassy officers state that Ongpin has
 been an effective supporter of Marcus's development
 programs since he joined the Cabinet in 1979 as

 the style of Korean development. E.xtremcl~ national-

 planning organization, he also serves as Minister of
 State for Finance, a position he has held since 1965.
 According to a senior official of the US Embassy in
 Manila, Mapa lacks administrative ability and would
 probably be more effective in a financial, rather than
 a planning, position; he has, however, surrounded
 himself with some very capable deputies. US Embassy
 officers emphasize that Mapa's cooperation is crucial
 in the implementation of many bilateral aid programs.
 Mapa advocates that foreign aid should build on a
 developing country's socioeconomic base rather than
 to try to change or eliminate that base. A staunch
 Roman Catholic and active member of the conserva-
 tive religious group Opus Dei, Mapa is well known for
 his rabid opposition to family planning programs. In
 May 1982 he and the Archbishop of Manila were
 successful in getting a contraceptive-oriented family
 planning program deleted from the country's draft
 economic plan for 1983-87. He earned a Ph.D. in
 Economics with specialties in development and inter-
 national finance at Harvard in 1962. He believes
 government budget policy is the key to balance-of-
 payments management.

 Appendix B
 The Last Decade in Economic
 Decision Making: A Report Card
 Manila's Most Astute Decisions
 The Decision To Monitor the Foreign Debt. Manila
 began to track the maturity profile of the country's
 foreign debt soon after rescheduling of the public-
 sector foreign debt was required in 1969. As a result,
 Manila has been able to avoid abrupt increases in the
 country's repayment obligations, and thus the need
 for sudden fluctuations in the exchange value of the
 peso. We believe it is precisely the recognition of
 Manila's competence in debt management on the part
 of private foreign bankers that has enabled the coun-
 try to continue commercial borrowing on relatively
 data, currently limits the domestic income generated
 by each dollar of foreign exchange earned to about 25
 favorable terms even as the debt grew rapidly.
 The Energy Program. Manila's domestic energy pro-
 gram, a response to the OPEC oil price hikes of 1973-
 74 and 1978-80, has two objectives: to reduce domes-
 tic oil consumption through conservation measures
 and to develop domestic supplies of nonoil energy-
 chiefly hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power.
 We believe the government is unlikely to reach its
 goal of reducing the Philippines' energy dependence
 on imported oil from 84 percent currently to 44
 percent in 1987, and outlays on imported capital
 equipment will probably exceed savings in the oil
 import bill during the next three or four years.
 Nonetheless, we believe the program is likely to
 provide large foreign exchange savings by the end of
 this decade. It has already succeeded in making the
 Philippines the world's second-largest producer of
 geothermal power, behind the United States.
 The Decision To Begin Diversifying Exports. Export
 earnings are still vulnerable to sharp fluctations in
 international primary commodity prices, but less so
 than in the early 1970s. Manufactured exports consti-
 tuted 23 percent of merchandise export earnings in
 1982, up substantially from 16 percent in 1975. The
 government's structural adjustment program is de-
 signed to remove the remaining weakness in the
 manufactured export sector, such as heavy reliance on
 imported inputs, which, according to World Bank
 Manila's Mistakes
 The Decision To Borrow at the Expense of Foreign
 Investment. When the bilateral treaty giving preferen-
 tial treatment to US investments expired in 1974,
 Manila chose to develop industry through foreign
 borrowing rather than to open the economy to foreign
 investors, as many other LDCs-such as Brazil, Tai-
 wan, and South Korea-have done to develop their
 industrial base. The borrowed funds generated rela-       25X1
 tively little repayment capacity, however, while sad-
 dling the Philippines with a foreign debt that exceed-
 ed $17 billion by the end of 1982. In our judgment,
 Manila still regards foreign investors as a threat to
 indigenous entrepreneurs, despite lipservice to the
 contrary. We believe protection of indigenous entre-
 preneurs at the expense of wage earners, moreover,
 has contributed substantially to the country's skewed
 income distribution.
 The Decision To Prolong Import Substitution. Ma-
 nila pursued exchange rate and trade policies that
 subsidized importers of capital goods and manufac-
 turing for the domestic market beginning after World
 War II. This strategy produced rapid postwar growth,
 but the manufacturing sector never became interna-
 tionally competitive and began to stagnate in the early
 1970s. Rather than reform domestic manufacturing,
 Manila confined support for manufactured exports to
 export processing industries, and local manufacturing
 interests required further protection to remain finan-
 cially viable. Under pressure from official creditors,
 this strategy has started to change gradually, but the
 balance of payments remains weak, and the domestic
 economy is under great stress from the adjustment.

 The Decision To Rely on the Well Connected To
 Develop Industry and Finance. President Marcos
 relied on personal associates to develop certain heavy
 industries, food processing activities, and financial
 services beginning in the early 1970s. Philippine
 economists say his strategy was to develop key sectors
 of the economy by building Philippine versions of the.
 "zaibatsu," the Japanese pattern of vertical industrial
 integration. Several associates proved inept business-
 men, however, leading to near financial collapse in
 early 1981, when the international economic slow-
 down first hit the Philippines and short-term local
 financing dried up. Government rescue operations
 have saved several large firms, but saddled the public
 sector with ultimate financial responsibility should the
 firms. still prove unsalvageable.
 The Economic Track Record
 Grading Philippine economic performance depends
 critically on a choice of criteria. The country has done
 better than most of Africa and much of Latin Ameri-
 ca, but has almost entirely missed East Asia's eco-
 nomic success. Real wages in manufacturing are no
 higher than they were in 1970, and, on a per capita
 basis, exports are among the lowest in East Asia.
 Real economic growth is slightly above average by
 middle-income, oil-importing LDC standards. Philip-
 pine financial performance has been weak, however,
 with a doubling of the foreign debt as a share of GNP
 since 1970-worse by half than the middle-income,
 oil-importing LDC average.
