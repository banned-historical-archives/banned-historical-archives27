of "none" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some 
instances, no short-form name exists�then the long-form name must

GNP/GDP methodology: GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the OECD 
countries, the USSR, Eastern Europe, and a portion of the developing 
countries, are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations 
rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The 
PPP methods involve the use of average price weights, which lie 
between the weights of the domestic and foreign price systems; using 
these weights US $100 converted into German marks by a PPP 
method will buy an equal amount of goods and services in both the 
US and Germany. One caution the proportion of, say, military 
expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency accounts 
may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP is 
expressed in PPP dollar terms, as, for example, when an observer 
estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures 
Similarly, dollar figures for exports and imports reflect the price 
patterns of international markets rather than PPP price patterns 
Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the popula-
tion, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the 
balance of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be 
positive or negative. 
Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs�narcotics,

Notes, Definitions, 
and Abbreviations (continued) 
Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural 
and semisynthetic narcotics 
Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature 
dried opium poppy 
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha 
edulis and is chewed or drunk as tea 
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy 
and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines 
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate 
(Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate) 
Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year 
of age in a given year per 1,000 live births occurring in the same year 
Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable 
land�land cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest 
(wheat, maize, rice), permanent crops�land cultivated for crops that 
are not replanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber), meadows 
and pastures�land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops, 
forest and woodland�land under dense or open stands of trees; and 
other�any land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, 
roads, desert) The percentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion 
of the entire amount of land area that is artificially supplied with 
water 
Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who 
represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not 
Involved with the day-to-day activities of the government The head 
of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-
day activities of the government In the UK, the monarch is the chief 
of state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, 
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government. 
Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by 
a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age 
remains constant in the future. 
Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent 
some national claims from being fully extended 
Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All 
commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which 
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc Also, a grouping of 
merchant ships by nationality or register. 
Captive register�A register of ships maintained by a territory, 
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships 
owned in the parent country Also referred to as an offshore register, 
the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive 
register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant 
of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the 
offshore territory Although the nature of a captive register makes it 
especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country, just as in 
the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive 
register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it is 
not the register of an independent state 
Flag of convenience register�A national register offering registra-
tion to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of 
convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees,

and Abbreviations (continued) 
low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning require-
ments True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few 
of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state Thus, while 
virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of 
circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the 
merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an open 
register 
Flag state�The nation in which a ship is registered and which 
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or 
abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how 
a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be 
placed on the register 
Internal register�A register of ships maintained as a subset of a 
national register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag 
and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime 
rules from those on the main national register These differences 
usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by foreign nation-
als, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state (when it functions 
as an FOC register) The Norwegian International Ship Register and 
Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of 
an internal register Both have been instrumental in stemming flight 
from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting 
foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags 
Merchant ship�A vessel that carries goods against payment of 
freight Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurate-
ly restricted to commercial vessels only 
Register�The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as 
listed with the maritime authorities of a country Also, the compendi-
um of such individual ships' registrations Registration of a ship 
provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the 
country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the national-
ity of the ship's ultimate owner 
Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars 
unless otherwise indicated 
Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons 
entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons 
(based on midyear population) An excess of persons entering the 
country is referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 
population), an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigra-
tion (-9 26 migrants/1,000 population) 
Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census 
based on statistics from population censuses, vital registration sys-
tems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on 
assumptions about future trends 
Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be 
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing 
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age 
Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless 
indicated as fiscal year (FY)

Economy 
Overview: Fundamentally, Afghanistan is 
an extremely poor, landlocked country, 
highly dependent on farming (wheat espe-
cially) and livestock raising (sheep and 
goats) Economic considerations, however, 
have played second fiddle to political and 
military upheavals, including the nine-
year Soviet military occupation (ended 15 
February 1989) and the continuing bloody 
civil war Over the past decade, one-third 
of the population has fled the country, 
with Pakistan sheltering some 3 million 
refugees and Iran perhaps 2 million

Economy 
Overview: As the poorest country in Eu-
rope, Albania's development lags behind 
even the least favored areas of the Yugos-
lav economy The Stalinist-type economy 
operates on the principles of central plan-
ning and state ownership of the means of 
production In recent years Albania has 
implemented limited economic reforms to 
stimulate its lagging economy, although 
they do not go nearly so far as current 
reforms in the USSR and Eastern Europe 
Attempts at self-reliance and a policy of 
not borrowing from international lend-
ers�sometimes overlooked in recent 
years�have greatly hindered the develop-
ment of a broad economic infrastructure 
Albania, however, possesses considerable 
mineral resources and is largely 
self-sufficient in food Numerical estimates 
of Albanian economic activity are subject 
to an especially wide margin of error be-
cause the government is isolated and 
closemouthed

Economy 
Overview: The exploitation of oil and natu-
ral gas products forms the backbone of 
the economy Algeria depends on hydro-
carbons for nearly all of its export 
receipts, about 30% of government reve-
nues, and nearly 25% of GDP In 1973-74 
the sharp increase in oil prices led to a 
booming economy that helped to finance 
an ambitious program of industrialization 
Plunging oil and gas prices, combined 
with the mismanagement of Algeria's 
highly centralized economy, have brought 
the nation to its most serious social and 
economic crisis since independence The 
government has promised far-reaching 
reforms, including giving public sector 
companies more autonomy, encouraging 
private-sector activity, boosting gas and 
nonhydrocarbon exports, and a major 
overhaul of the banking and financial sys-
tems In 1988 the government started to 
implement a new economic policy to dis-
mantle large state farms into privately 
operated units

Economy 
Overview: The mainstay of Andorra's 
economy is tourism An estimated 12 mil-
lion tourists visit annually, attracted by 
Andorra's duty-free status and by its sum-

duction is limited by a scarcity of arable 
land, and most food has to be imported 
The principal livestock activity is sheep 
raising Manufacturing consists mainly of 
cigarettes, cigars, and furniture The rapid 
pace of European economic integration is 
a potential threat to Andorra's advantages 
from its duty-free status

geographic location, highly developed 
transport network, and diversified indus-
trial and commercial base Industry is 
concentrated mainly in the populous 
Flemish area in the north, although the 
government is encouraging reinvestment 
in the southern region of Walloon With 
few natural resources Belgium must im-
port essential raw materials, making its 
economy closely dependent on the state of 
world markets In 1988 over 70% of trade 
was with other EC countries During the 
period 1986-88 the economy profited from 
falling oil prices and a lower dollar, which 
helped to improve the terms of trade Real 
GDP grew by an average of 3 5% in 1986-
89, up from 1 5% in 1985 However, a 
large budget deficit and 10% unemploy-
ment cast a shadow on the economy

Economy 
Overview: The Bolivian economy steadily 
deteriorated between 1980 and 1985 as La 
Paz financed growing budget deficits by 
expanding the money supply and inflation 
spiraled-peaking at 11,700% An austere 
orthodox economic program adopted by 
newly elected President Paz Estenssoro in 
1985, however, succeeded in reducing in-
flation to between 10% and 20% annually 
during 1987 and 1989, eventually restart-
ing economic growth President Paz Za-
mora has pledged to retain the economic 
policies of the previous government in or-
der to keep inflation down and continue 
the growth begun under his predecessor 
Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be one 
of the poorest countries in Latin America, 
and it remains vulnerable to price fluctua-

Economy 
Overview: The economy has historically 
been based on cattle raising and crops 
Agriculture today provides a livelihood for 
over 80% of the population, but produces 
only about 50% of food needs and contrib-
utes a small 5% to GDP The driving 
force behind the rapid economic growth of 
the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining 
industry This sector, mostly on the 
strength of diamonds, has gone from gen-
erating 25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50% 
in 1988 No other sector has experienced 
such growth, especially not that of the 
agricultural sector, which is plagued by 
erratic rainfall and poor soils The unem-
ployment rate remains a problem at 25%

Economy 
Overview: The economy, a mixture of pri-
vate enterprises of all sizes and extensive 
government intervention, experienced 
enormous difficulties in the late 1980s, 
notably declining real growth, runaway 
inflation, foreign debt obligations of more 
than $100 billion, and uncertain economic 
policy Government intervention includes 
trade and investment restrictions, wage/ 
price controls, interest and exchange rate 
controls, and extensive tariff barriers 
Ownership of major industrial facilities is 
divided among private interests, the gov-
ernment, and multinational companies 
Ownership in agriculture likewise is var-
ied, with the government intervening in 
the politically sensitive issues involving 
large landowners and the masses of poor 
peasants In consultation with the IMF, 
the Brazilian Government has initiated 
several programs over the last few years 
to ameliorate the stagnation and foreign 
debt problems None of these has given 
more than temporary relief The strategy 
of the new Collor government is to 
increase the pace of privatization, encour-
age foreign trade and investment, and es-
tablish a more realistic exchange rate 
One long-run strength is the existence of 
vast natural resources

Economy 
Overview: Growth in the sluggish Bulgar-
ian economy fell to the 2% annual level in 
the 1980s, and by 1989 Sofia's foreign 
debt had skyrocketed to $10 billion-giv 
ing a debt service ratio of more than 40% 
of hard currency earnings The 
post-Zhivkov regime faces major problems 
of renovating an aging industrial plant, 
keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding tech-
nological developments, investing in addi-
tional energy capacity (the portion of elec-
tric power from nuclear energy reached 
37% in 1988), and motivating workers, in 
part by giving them a share in the earn-
ings of their enterprises A major decree 
of January 1989 summarized and 
extended the government's economic re-
structuring efforts, which include a partial 
decentralization of controls over produc-
tion decisions and foreign trade The new 
regime promises more extensive reforms 
and eventually a market economy But the 
ruling group cannot (so far) bring itself to 
give up ultimate control over economic 
affairs exercised through the vertical Party/ 
ministerial command structure Reforms 
have not led to improved economic perfor-
mance, in particular the provision of more 
and better consumer goods A further 
blow to the economy was the exodus of 
310,000 ethnic Turks in mid-1989, which 
caused temporary shortages of skilled la-
bor in glassware, aluminum, and other 
industrial plants and in tobacco fields

Economy 
Overview: Burma is one of the poorest 
countries in Asia, with a per capita GDP 
of about $280 The government reports 
negligible growth for FY88 The nation 
has been unable to achieve any significant 
improvement in export earnings because 
of falling prices for many of its major 
commodity exports For rice, traditionally 
the most Important export, the drop in 
world prices has been accompanied by 
shrinking markets and a smaller volume 
of sales In 1985 teak replaced rice as the 
largest export and continues to hold this 
position The economy is heavily depen-
dent on the agricultural sector, which gen-
erates about 40% of GDP and provides 
employment for more than 65% of the 
work force

Overview: Cambodia is a desperately poor 
country whose economic development has 
been stymied by deadly political 
infighting The economy is based on agri-
culture and related industries Over the 
past decade Cambodia has been slowly 
recovering from its near destruction by 
war and political upheaval It still 
remains, however, one of the world's poor-
est countries, with an estimated per capita 
GDP of about $130 The food situation is 
precarious, during the 1980s famine has 
been averted only through international 
relief In 1986 the production level of rice, 
the staple food crop, was able to meet 
only 80% of domestic needs The biggest 
success of the nation's recovery program

Economy 
Overview: Over the past decade the econ-
omy has registered a remarkable perfor-
mance because of the development of an 
offshore oil industry Real GDP growth 
annually averaged 10% from 1978 to 
1985 In 1986 Cameroon had one of the 
highest levels of income per capita in trop-
ical Africa, with oil revenues picking up 
the slack as growth in other sectors soft-
ened Because of the sharp drop in oil 
prices, however, the economy is now expe-
riencing serious budgetary difficulties and 
balance-of-payments disequalibrium Oil 
reserves currently being exploited will be 
depleted in the early 1990s, so ways must 
be found to boost agricultural and indus-
trial exports in the medium term The 
Sixth Cameroon Development Plan (1986-
91) stresses balanced development and 
designates agriculture as the basis of the 
country's economic future.

the population lives in rural areas, agricul-
ture's share of GDP is only 16%, the 
fishing and manufacturing sectors are 4% 
each About 90% of food must be 
imported The fishing potential of the is-
lands is not fully exploited (the fish 
catch�mostly lobster and tuna�came to 
only 10,000 tons in 1985) Cape Verde 
annually runs a high trade deficit, 
financed by remittances from emigrants, 
cash grants, food aid, and foreign loans

Economy 
Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chi-
nese leadership has been trying to move 
the economy from the sluggish Soviet-
style centrally planned economy to a more 
productive and flexible economy with mar-
ket elements�but still within the frame-
work of monolithic Communist control To 
this end the authorities have switched to a 
system of household responsibility in agri-
culture in place of the old collectivization, 
increased the authority of local officials 
and plant managers in industry, permitted 
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in 
services and light manufacturing, and 
opened the foreign economic sector to in-
creased trade and joint ventures The most 
gratifying result has been a strong spurt 
in production, particularly in agriculture 
in the early 1980s Otherwise, the leader-
ship has often experienced in its hybrid 
system the worst results of socialism (bu-
reaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of 
capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up 
inflation) Beijing thus has periodically 
backtracked, retightening central controls 
at intervals and thereby undermining the 
credibility of the reform process Open 
inflation and excess demand continue to 
plague the economy, and political repres-
sion, following the crackdown at Tianan-
men in mid-1989, has curtailed tourism, 
foreign aid, and new investment by for-
eign firms Popular resistance and changes 
in central policy have weakened China's 
population control program, which is es-
sential to the nation's long-term economic 
viability

of the highest rates in Africa The world 
decline in oil prices, however, has forced 
the government to launch an austerity 
program to cope with declining receipts 
and mounting foreign debts

Economy 
Overview: Agriculture provides the eco-
nomic base The major export earners are 
fruit, copra, and clothing Manufacturing 
activities are limited to a fruit-processing 
plant and several clothing factories Eco-
nomic development is hindered by the iso-
lation of the islands from foreign markets 
and a lack of natural resources and good 
transportation links A large trade deficit 
is annually made up for by remittances 
from emigrants and from foreign aid 
Current economic development plans call 
for exploiting the tourism potential and 
expanding the fishing industry

the regular flow of goods to Cuba Re-

ment currently is encouraging foreign in-

Overview: Ecuador continues to recover 
from a 1986 drop in international oil

Economy 
Overview: Egypt has one of the largest 
public sectors of all the Third World 
economies, most industrial plants being 
owned by the government Overregulation 
holds back technical modernization and 
foreign Investment Even so, the economy 
grew rapidly during the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of 
world oil prices and an increasingly heavy 
burden of debt servicing led Egypt to be-
gin negotiations with the IMF for 
balance-of-payments support As part of 
the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the 
government agreed to institute a reform 
program to reduce inflation, promote eco-
nomic growth, and improve its external 
position The reforms have been slow in 
coming, however, and the economy has 
been largely stagnant for the past three 
years With 1 million people being added 
every eight months to Egypt's population, 
urban growth exerts enormous pressure on 
the 5% of the total land area available for 
agriculture

considerable sums of hard currency from 
the 250,000 tourists who visited each year 
In 1987, however, after two military 
coups, the economy went into decline 
GDP dropped by 7 8% in 1987 and by 
another 2 5% in 1988, political uncertainly 
created a drop in tourism, and the worst 
drought of the century caused sugar pro-
duction to fall sharply In contrast, sugar 
and tourism turned in strong 
performances in 1989, and the economy 
rebounded vigorously

Economy 
Overview: One of the world's most devel-
oped economies, France has substantial 
agricultural resources and a highly diver-
sified modern industrial sector Large 
tracts of fertile land, the application of 
modern technology, and subsidies have 
combined to make it the leading agricul-
tural producer in Western Europe France 
is largely self-sufficient in agricultural 
products and is a major exporter of wheat 
and dairy products The industrial sector 
generates about one-third of GDP and 
employs about one-third of the work force 
During the period 1982-86 economic 
growth was sluggish, averaging only 1 4% 
annually This trend was reversed by late 
1987, however, with a strong expansion of 
consumer demand, followed by a surge in 
investment The economy has had diffi-
culty generating enough jobs for new en-
trants into the labor force, resulting in a 
high unemployment rate, but the upward 
trend in growth recently pushed the job-
less rate below 10% The steadily advanc-
ing economic integration within the Euro-
pean Community is a major force 
affecting the fortunes of the various eco-
nomic sectors

Economy 
Overview: The economy, dependent on 
timber and manganese until the early 
1970s, is now dominated by the oil sector 
During the period 1981-85 oil accounted 
for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export 
earnings, and 65% of government revenues 
on average The high oil prices of the 
early 1980s contributed to a substantial 
increase in per capita income, stimulated 
domestic demand, reinforced migration 
from rural to urban areas, and raised the 
level of real wages to among the highest 
in Sub-Saharan Africa The three-year 
slide of Gabon's economy, which began 
with falling oil prices in 1985, stabilized 
in 1989 because of a near doubling of oil 
prices over their 1988 lows The agricul-
tural and industrial sectors are relatively 
underdeveloped, accounting for only 8% 
and 10%, respectively, of GDP in 1986

Note: The war between Israel and the

rael in control of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan 
Heights As stated in the 1978 Camp Da-
vid Accords and reaffirmed by President 
Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initia-
tive, the final status of the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip, their relationship with 
their neighbors, and a peace treaty be-
tween Israel and Jordan are to be negoti-
ated among the concerned parties Camp 
David further specifies that these negotia-
tions will resolve the respective bound-
aries Pending the completion of this pro-
cess, it is US policy that the final status of 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has 
yet to be determined In the view of the 
US, the term West Bank describes all of 
the area west of the Jordan under Jorda-
nian administration before the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war With respect to negotiations 
envisaged in the framework agreement, 
however, it is US policy that a distinction 
must be made between Jerusalem and the 
rest of the West Bank because of the 
city's special status and circumstances 
Therefore, a negotiated solution for the 
final status of Jerusalem could be different 
in character from that of the rest of the 
West Bank

Economy 
Overview: The GDR is moving rapidly 
away from its centrally planned economy 
As the 1990s begin, economic integration 
with West Germany appears Inevitable, 
beginning with the establishment of a 
common currency The opening of the 
border with the FRG in late 1989 and the 
continuing emigration of hundreds of 
thousands of skilled workers had brought 
growth to a standstill by yearend 1989 
Features of the old economic regime that 
will quickly change (a) the collectivization 
of 95% of East German farms, (b) state 
ownership of nearly all transportation fa-
cilities, industrial plants, foreign trade or-
ganizations, and financial institutions, (c) 
the 65% share in trade of the USSR and 
other CEMA countries, and (d) the de-
tailed control over economic details exer-
cised by Party and state Once integrated 
into the thriving West German economy, 
the area will have to stem the outflow of 
workers and renovate the obsolescent In-
dustrial base After an initial readjust-
ment period, living standards and quality 
of output will steadily rise toward West 
German levels

Economy 
Overview: West Germany, a major eco-

highly urbanized and skilled population 
that enjoys excellent living standards and 
comprehensive social welfare benefits The 
FRG is poor in natural resources, coal 
being the most important mineral The 
FRG's comparative advantage lies in the 
technologically advanced production 
stages Thus manufacturing and services 
dominate economic activity, and raw ma-
terials and semimanufactures constitute a 
large proportion of imports In 1988 man-
ufacturing accounted for 35% of GDP,

Economy 
Overview: Supported by substantial inter-
national assistance, Ghana has been im-
plementing a steady economic rebuilding 
program since 1983 Good harvests in 
1988 featured the 6% growth in GNP 
Moves toward privatization and relaxation 
of government controls continued in 1988-
89, although at a slower-than-expected 
pace In 1988 service on the $2 8 billion 
debt was equivalent to 75% of export 
earnings As Ghana obtains concessional 
loans and pays off high-interest debt, how-
ever, debt service is expected to fall below 
30% of export earnings in the early 1990s 
The economic rebuilding program has 
both helped and harmed the manufactur-
ing sector, for example, by improving the 
supply of raw materials and by increasing 
competition from imports The long-term 
outlook is favorable provided that the po-
litical structure can endure the slow pace 
at which living standards are improving 
and can manage the problems stemming 
from excessive population growth
