 SEGRET
 THE SOVIET PARTY LEADERSHIP .
 .   The composition of the new central committee of the
 Soviet Communist Party and its presidium, secretariat and
 bureau for the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic
 (RSFSR) reflects the political relationships already
 established in the Soviet Union as a result of Khrushchev's
 rise to a predominant position.  Collective rule at the top
 continues with Khrushchev clearly "first among equals."
 All of the full members of the presidium were re-elected,
 and there is unusual continuity in the secondary levels of
 leadership.
 MAIN POLICY THEMES
 OF THE 20th PARTY CONGRESS .  .                                      Page  4
 The 20th Party Congress, taking its cue from
 Khrushchev's authoritative political report, spelled out
 the main themes of Soviet policy---collective leadership,
 peaceful coexistence, rapid development of industrial
 strength, maintenance of military power at a high level,
 and promotion of popular fronts in non-Communist countries.
 One of the principal aims of speakers at the Congress was
 to strip the Soviet regime of the more repugnant aspects
 25X1      of Stalinism.
 ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION .  .  .  .  .  .  ?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  7
 The possibility that Arab-Israeli border incidents
 could expand into major hostilities has been increased
 as a result of the concentration of Egyptian, Syrian and
 Lebanese troops on Israel's borders.  Firing on Israeli
 fishing boats on Lake Tiberias and new incidents on the
 Gaza front have also contributed to this situation.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Yugoslavs Pleased With Soviet Party Developments:   Yugoslav
 Communist leaders believe t at the Soviet 20th Party
 Congress proves the present Soviet leaders are really
 trying to set the USSR on a new course.  The way
 has therefore been made much easier for the resumption
 of relations between the Soviet and Yugoslav Communist
 parties.                       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  1
 Soviet Spokesmen Reaffirm Sino-Soviet Solidarity:                The
 tribute accorded Communist China by speakers at the
 20th Party Congress climaxes the slow development
 over the past several years of Soviet recognition
 of the Chinese road to socialism, and marks authori-
 tative Soviet acceptance of established Chinese
 Communist thought on the subject.

 Chinese Communist Party Now World's Largest:   The Chinese
 Communist Party membership of 9,   0,0 0, as announced
 by politburo member Chu Teh in his speech to the
 Soviet 20th Party Congress, makes the Chinese party
 the largest Communist party in the world.  The Soviet
 Communist Party has about 7,200,000 members.

 Soviet Technical Training for Asian-African Countries:
 New Soviet offers to provide technical training for
 Asian and African countries and the USSR's sponsor-
 ship of technical institutes in Bombay and Rangoon
 confirm that Moscow intends to make educational
 assistance one of the mainstays of its policy toward
 the economically less developed countries.  This
 program will in the long run increase Soviet in-
 fluence among the technical elite and may place the
 USSR in a position to compete with the West in the
 training of technical students from the underdevel-
 oped areas.   F-           I .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .               .  .  .  .     Page  3
 Afghanistan: Of the $100,000,000 Soviet credit to
 1A ghanistan, $60,000,000 is reported to have already
 been committed to projects in all parts of the
 country.  Arms from the USSR are apparently arriving
 in Kabul, and the long-delayed Afghan military
 mission to discuss Czech arms may soon depart for
 Prague.  The USSR may also be preparing to launch a
 campaign designed to give its economic program
 maximum political impact.                        .  .  .  .     Page  5  25X1

 Pineau is apparently ready to make extensive con-
 cessions on the Saar in his talks with Foreign
 Minister Brentano in Bonn on 3 March.   In general,

 the area's early political and economic reintegra-

 Debate in Soviet publications on the problems of
 Soviet literature shows that official policy toward the

 tolerable balance in official policy between ideological
 conformity and artistic creativeness continues.       Differ-
 ences of opinion as to the extent to which the party
 should regulate creative activity, evident within the
 literary fraternity for some time, may be reaching into
 the upper levels of the party as well.  Khrushchev, in
 his speech to the 20th Party Congress, made it clear,
 however, that during a period when cultural interchange
 with the West has been allowed in the interest of propa-
 ganda and diplomatic objectives, the party must guard
 against a relaxation of ideological discipline and the in-
 filtration of "alien" influence.  Literature in the USSR
 always has been the servant of the state, and Soviet writers
 will be expected to stay within party-defined limits.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 The composition of the new
 central committee of the Soviet
 Communist Party and its presid-
 ium, secretariat and bureau for
 the Russian Socialist Federated
 Soviet   Republic reflects the
 political relationships already
 established in the Soviet Union
 as a result of Khrushchev's rise
 to a predominant position.   Col-
 lective rule at the top contin-
 ues with Khrushchev clearly
 "first among equals."  All of
 the full members of the pre-
 sidium were re-elected and there
 is unusual continuity in the
 secondary levels of leadership.
 The new central committee
 was elected on 24 February at
 the 20th Party Congress.   On
 27 February the 133 voting
 (full) members of the 255-man
 committee met in plenary ses-
 sion to elect the party's pre-
 sidium and secretariat.   This
 presidium,  assisted in an ex-
 ecutive capacity by the secre-
 tariat, constitutes the col-
 lective dictatorship of the
 Soviet Union.   The central com-
 mittee is actually chosen by
 the top leaders long before the
 formal election and includes
 their important political friends
 and proteges.
 Khrushchev's predominant
 position was established be-
 yond doubt by the election of
 a large number of his friends
 and proteges to the new central
 committee and as candidate mem-
 bers of the presidium and mem-
 bers of the secretariat.   His
 power is further illustrated by
 his being appointed to head the
 central committee's important
 new "Bureau for the RSFSR"
 (Russian Republic).   A liberal
 sprinkling in the new central
 committee of probable support-
 ers of the other top leaders
 (Mikoyan, Bulganin, and Kag-
 anovich) attests, however, to
 the continuation of collective
 rule.
 Since the election of the
 previous central committee in
 1952, the top party hierarchy
 has changed considerably as a
 result of Stalin's death, Beria's
 execution, Malenkov's demotion
 and Molotov's humiliation.   The
 secondary leadership, however,
 has remained remarkably stable.
 Almost 60 percent of the new
 central committee served on the
 old one.   This percentage is
 larger than at any time since
 the 17th Party Congress in 1934,
 the last congress before the
 great purges.
 The relative position in
 the central committee of the
 government administrator and
 the party official has not changed,
 but among the government
 representatives there has been
 a shift from the police and the
 military to other functionaries.
 The cut in police representation
 from nine to three is in line
 with the reduced political role
 of the police in the post-Stalin
 period.   The effect of the cut
 in total military representation
 from 26 to 18 is somewhat offset
 by the military's net gain of
 one among the full members of
 the central committee and the
 election of Zhukov, a profes-
 sional soldier, as a candidate
 member of the party presidium,
 where he may be able to exercise
 some personal influence on policy.

 The new central committee
 contains six more ambassadors
 than the one elected in 1952,
 but nearly all of these are
 former party careerists turned
 diplomat since Stalin's death
 and assigned to posts within
 the Sino-Soviet bloc.

 Ukrainian representation from
 8 to 19.   Nine other members
 of the committee had only re-
 cently transferred from the
 Ukraine to jobs elsewhere in

 probably due to Khrushchev's
 influence, since he spent many
 years as party secretary in the

 promotion is probably due to
 the influence of Khrushchev,
 who had helped her become Mos-

 singled her out for honors at
 public fetes and receptions

 probably be strengthened.
 Bureau for the RSFSR
 The central committee's
 "Bureau for the RSFSR," called
 for by Khrushchev in his speech
 to the congress, was presumably
 organized by the central com-

 MAIN POLICY THEMES
 OF THE 20th PARTY CONGRESS
 The Soviet Party Congress
 has clearly spelled out main
 trends in Soviet policy, trends
 that had their origin in the
 period following Stalin's death
 and which became more clearly
 defined with the purge of Beria
 and the rise of Khrushchev.
 Khrushchev dominated the
 congress.   His eight-hour, 50,-
 000-word political report was
 a demonstration of authority.
 His report as well as the other
 speeches at the congress, notably
 Mikoyan's, add up to the fact
 SECRET
 SUMMARY
 10-man bureau also includes
 RSFSR premier M. A. Yasnov,
 Moscow Oblast party boss I.
 V. Kapitonov, Leningrad Oblast
 party boss F. R. Kozlov, and
 A. P. Kirilenko, a Ukrainian
 recently transferred to head
 the Sverdlovsk (RSFSR) Oblast
 party organization.
 The RSFSR bureau will prob-
 ably act as a junior presidium,
 making republic-level policy de-
 cisions for the Soviet Union's
 largest republic.   The creation
 of a special body to perform this
 function, formerly a responsi-
 bility of the all-Union presidium,
 followed apparently successful
 experimentation with departments
 in the all-Union party apparatus
 especially created to deal with
 RSFSR matters.  While the new
 bureau is probably designed to
 relieve the presidium as a
 whole of administrative detail,
 the  political  importance  of
 RSFSR  affairs  is  so  great
 that  Khrushchev has  chosen
 to  keep  them  under his
 Personal  jurisdiction.
 that the present leadership has
 revised Soviet policy in order
 to strip the regime of the more
 repugnant aspects of Stalinism.
 These aspects were:
 An absolute dictatorship
 based on naked police power.
 rather than on party authority.
 A primary reliance on force
 and the threat of military
 power to achieve Communist
 ends, coupled with the grim
 thesis of the inevitability
 of war.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 A belief in the necessity
 of violent revolution in
 every nation.
 These   ideas          have  been
 formally repudiated,      and have
 been replaced by:
 Collective leadership. The
 veterans of Stalin's tyranny
 have now at least outwardly
 committed themselves to "col-
 lective leadership," with
 Khrushchev the dominant per-
 sonality.   This is not likely
 to work indefinitely, but
 while it does, it will prob-
 ably give a flexibility to
 Soviet policy that will make
 it more dangerous to the non-
 Communist world than the
 "hardened arteries" period
 of Stalin's last years.
 Peaceful coexistence and de-
 nial of the "fatal inevita-
 bility of war."  These are
 policy-propaganda themes
 likely to last a good many
 years, because the Soviet
 leaders recognize that Stalin
 was making things easier for
 the West by frightening
 small nations into co-oper-
 ation with the United States
 from a dread of general war
 or direct Soviet military
 aggression.
 Possibility of peaceful
 transition to socialism in
 some countries.   The admis-
 sion that the "transition to
 socialism" may be achieved
 in some countries by peace-
 ful parliamentary means is
 a signal for full speed a-
 head with the "popular front"
 in unstable political arenas
 such as France,  Italy,  and
 Indonesia.   It reflects a
 belief on the part of the
 Soviet leaders that, with-
 out war, they can push A-
 merican influence off the
 Eurasian continent and per-
 haps all the way back home
 by political, economic and
 subversive pressures alone.
 It is unlikely that the
 Soviet leaders would have under-
 taken the delicate and potential-
 ly dangerous task of revising

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Communist dogma if they were
 contemplating only some short-
 term, narrow tactical shift in
 line.
 Authoritative pronouncement
 of this new policy line will
 have many reverberations in
 Communist circles throughout
 the world.   (See article on
 Yugoslav reactions,  Part II,
 p. 1  )   While some local Com-
 munist leaders have probably
 been shaken by Soviet repudia-
 tion of Stalinism, they now
 have a chance to revitalize
 their parties and win back re-
 spectable Lntellectual and work-
 ing-class support, previously
 dwindling because of the unfail-
 ing subordination of local in-
 terests to Soviet policy.
 The congress also reaffirmed
 that the regime is dedicating it-
 self to maintaining a rapid pace
 of development of industrial
 strength.   The economic goals
 cited permit the USSR simulta-
 neously to keep the home base
 solid and secure in both econom--
 c.and  military contexts,  even
 though at some cost in improve-
 ment of living standards; to
 export capital to the places
 where  it  will  do the  most
 political good--especially to
 the former colonial countries
 anxious to industrialize rapidly;
 and to distribute arms to coun-
 tries abroad, wherever such ac-
 tion will cause the most trouble.
 Mikoyan and Zhukov asserted
 that the USSR's military strength
 will be maintained at a high lev-
 el, although they stated that
 Soviet military power would be
 employed defensively or as a
 deterrent to Western initiation
 of hostilities.
 Soviet policy is also
 calculated to enhance Soviet
 prestige in Asia and Africa.
 Khrushchev included "peace-
 loving" neutral states in
 both Asia and Europe, along
 with the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 in a vast "zone of peace"
 which now, and especially in
 the future,  Soviet leaders
 expect to play a decisive role
 in world affairs.   Soviet policy
 is designed to slow down the
 growth of Western strength
 and exploit weaknesses in the
 Western coalition.  At the
 same time,  it is intended to
 increase Soviet influence on
 the world's uncommitted and
 neutralist nations  and to
 manipulate them in support of
 Communist foreign policy.   The
 final   congress   resolution
 carefully  grouped  the  main
 nations  of  the world  in ways
 that reflected these policy aims.
 All the speeches of the
 Soviet leaders make it clear
 that the capture of power,
 establishment of "dictator-
 ships of the proletariat," and
 the revolutionary transformation
 of society will  remain  the
 ultimate aims of Communist
 parties.   Khrushchev's re-
 visions of Communist dogma
 constitute mainly an admission
 that long-term Communist ob-
 jectives can be reached by
 means hitherto considered un-
 realistic and for that reason
 wrong.
 Finally, all the speakers
 at the congress sounded a note
 of deep confidence in the
 strength of the Communist world
 and  in  the inevitability of
 its ultimate  triumph  over
 capitalism.   In Khrushchev's
 words:   "The Soviet State is
 growing and gathering strength.
 It  towers  like  a powerful
 lighthouse  showing  all  hu-
 manity                                                                 the road to  a new

 world .... Our cause is invin-
 cible .... The future is ours."
 Or,  as Mikoyan put it:
 "Not a single major interna
 tional question can now be
 solved by the will of the West-
 ern powers alone without re-
 gard for the views of the Soviet
 Union, China, and all the coun-
 tries of socialism.   In the minds
 of humanity,  socialism is now in-
 comparably stronger than capital-
 ism.   That is why it is not for
 us to fear a struggle between
 the ideas of socialism and capi-
 talism."
 The possibility that Arab-
 Israeli border incidents could
 expand into major hostilities
 has been increased as a result
 of the concentration of Egyptian,,
 Syrian,  and Lebanese troops on
 Israel's borders.   Firing on
 Israeli fishing boats
 on Lake Tiberias and
 new incidents on the
 Gaza front have also
 contributed to this
 situation.
 Almost all major
 Syrian army units
 are now stationed at
 or near the Israeli
 frontier, and Egypt
 has 42,500 men, over
 half its army and a-
 bout 80 percent of
 its actual combat
 strength,  in the
 Sinai Peninsula near
 Israel's southwest-
 ern border.   The Leba-
 nese also have moved
 infantry and artil-
 lery closer to the
 border.
 Syrian officers
 admit that the dis-
 position of their
 forces makes them
 vulnerable to an
 Israeli breakthrough
 in the event of hos-
 tilities, but they
 claim the recent move of their
 units is demanded by public
 opinion.  Both the Syrian and
 the Egyptian reinforcements of
 frontier areas appear to stem
 from  fear  that  Israel  will
 take some  action  inside  the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Yugoslavs Pleased
 With Soviet Party Developments
 Yugoslav Communists be-
 lieve that the Soviet 20th
 Party Congress proves the pres-
 ent                   Soviet leaders are really
 trying to set the USSR on a new
 course.
 The Belgrade newspaper
 Politika,  in an editorial typi-
 cal o he Yugoslav press re-
 action,                    says that the speeches
 and resolutions at the con-
 gress, and particularly the
 condemnation of the "cult of
 personality," point to "a new
 page in Soviet history, a
 technical and modern, progres-
 sive and elastic, and also more
 humane stage than the previous
 one."  The only point with
 which the Yugoslav press has
 expressed disagreement was the
 continued Soviet insistence
 that the world is divided into
 two camps, a position the Yugo-
 slavs have consistently opposed
 as only sharpening tensions.
 Ambassador Riddleberger
 reports that Yugoslav officials
 have concluded that the Soviet
 "threat" is no longer imminent,
 if in fact it exists at all.
 They based this conclusion
 mainly on Soviet references to
 peaceful intent and the state-
 ments that a socialist state
 can be achieved from capitalism
 through parliamentary procedures.
 Prior to the Soviet party
 congress,  the most important
 areas of ideological difference
 between Belgrade and Moscow
 were in concepts of how so-
 cialism can come to power, and
 how socialism can develop once
 in power.  On the former ques-
 tion, the Yugoslavs claim that
 all countries will inevitably
 achieve socialism in their own
 way, and that already some
 countries in Western Europe
 are developing socialism in an
 evolutionary fashion through
 legislation rather than rev-
 olutionary seizure of power.
 Mikoyan's statement at the
 party congress clearly con-
 tinued the historic Bolshevik
 objection to an evolutionary
 course, calling it mere re-
 visionism or reformism, and
 "fruitless jibbing."  Mikoyan
 and Khrushchev did, however,
 accept the idea of a. "revolu-
 tionary" takeover by the
 "workers" (i.e.,Communists)
 without actual resort to vio-
 lence.   In other words, they
 said,.it is possible "to reach
 socialism by peaceful means...
 using existing parliamentary
 institutions."   Mikoyan cited
 the Czechoslovak coup of 1948
 as an example of successful
 parliamentary transition to
 socialism, and it was in this
 sense that Soviet leaders
 accepted the possibility of
 "peaceful revolution."
 On the second point, the
 Soviet leaders made into of-
 ficial party doctrine what they
 had accepted on their Belgrade
 visit--that is,  that there are
 many roads of socialist develop-
 ment once the "workers" are in
 power.   This makes the Yugoslav
 and other possible "roads of
 socialist development" as
 respectable as the USSR's own
 road.
 The ideological gap has
 thus been narrowed between
 Moscow and Belgrade, and the
 way made much easier for the
 establishment of new party-to-
 party relations.   The Yugoslavs
 deny that any have been estab-
 lished yet.

 The message of greetings
 to the Soviet "comrades" sent
 by Tito on behalf of the Yugo-
 slav party and Socialist Front
 in one sense constitutes a
 party contact.   It may be
 a forerunner of more direct

 Rea.  irm  Sino-Soviet Solidarity
 The tribute accorded Commu-
 nist China by speakers at the
 20th Soviet Party Congress
 climaxes the slow development
 over the past several years of
 Soviet recognition of the Chi-
 nese road to socialism, and
 marks  authoritative Soviet
 acceptance of established Chi-
 nese Communist thought on the
 subject.  The Soviet leaders
 confirmed that the USSR and
 China. are continuing to co-
 operate harmoniously.
 The speakers discussed
 China separately from the
 other "people's democracies"
 and indicated its order of
 priority within the Sino-Soviet
 bloc by consistently placing it
 immediately after the USSR.
 References to Communist
 China's world position strongly
 emphasized peaceful Chinese
 initiative.   Communist China's
 claim to Taiwan was given
 secondary emphasis, although
 it figured prominently in
 speeches by Molotov and Zhukov.
 Khrushchev ignored the Taiwan
 issue and placed Chinese exter-
 nal policy entirely within the
 context of the bloc's general
 peace initiative.
 He.credited China with
 contributing to the termination
 to have relations with all
 "socialist" groups, provided a
 satisfactory basis can be es-
 tablished.   They probably now
 believe this is possible with
 the USSR in light of statements
 at the congress.   They will
 probably remain adamant against

 which Belgrade strongly criti-
 cizes as being dominated ideo-
 logically by one form of

 Korea and proposing a. collective

 declared Soviet support.   Both
 Khrushchev and Molotov endorsed
 the "five principles," ori-
 ginally co-authored by China
 and India, as the best formula
 for peaceful coexistence in
 the world.
 Within the general frame-
 work of increasingly broad
 acceptance of past and future
 methods of arriving at social-
 ism, the party congress speakers
 gave the fullest recognition
 thus far extended to the ideo-
 logical correctness of the Chi-
 nese road to socialism.   Sev-
 eral speakers, including
 Khrushchev, endorsed China's
 program of "peaceful" trans-
 formation from capitalist to
 socialist ownership.

 foremost of the Soviet ideol-

 Communists for their "masterful

 segment of the technical elite
 in Asia and the Far East.         The
 USSR may soon be in the posi-
 tion of training as many Indian
 and Burmese students as the
 West.
 The USSR's technical train-
 ing program may well fall under
 the jurisdiction of the new
 Chief Directorate for Economic
 Relations (GUES) .,which also
 controls Soviet foreign econom-
 ic aid and enjoys a priority
 place directly under the Council
 of Ministers.
 .P. A. Ma.letin, a deputy
 chief of GUES, who headed the
 Soviet delegation to the con-
 ference of the Economic Com-
 mission for Asia and the Far
 East (ECAFE), which recently
 met in India, has said that the
 USSR is ready to receive spe-
 cia.lists from the ECAFE coun-
 tries and to share Soviet tech-
 nical and economic experience
 with them.   He also said the
 USSR would send experts to
 those countries either as a
 part of the Soviet contributions
 to the United Nations Expanded
 Technical Assistance Program
 (UNETAP) or under bilateral
 agreements.
 A Soviet spokesman report-
 edly told the conference that
 the Soviet government was ready
 to grant 200 scholarships to
 students from the ECAFE coun-
 tries for study in Soviet in-
 stitutions.
 The USSR, through UNESCO,
 will provide technical assist-
 ance and equipment to the value
 of six million rubles ($1,500,-
 000 at the official rate) for
 the proposed Western Technologi-
 cal Institute at Bombay, which
 will be opened in mid-1957, ac-
 cording to the official Indian
 information service.   The USSR
 PART II
 also will provide the institute
 with 15 Soviet professors for
 five-year terms, translators to
 prepare English versions of So-
 viet technical literature, and
 training facilities for 20
 Indian teachers in the USSR.
 The institute appears to
 have been worked out between
 India and the USSR early last
 year.  The amount allocated for
 it is almost double the expendi-
 ture originally anticipated
 when the project was approved
 last November within the frame-
 work of the UNETAP for 1956.
 The deputy director general of
 UNESCO has stated,  however,
 that if UNESCO is to be associ-
 atedwith the Bombay institute,
 the USSR will be informed that
 the project must be worked out
 on a multilateral basis.
 The Soviet Union also
 plans to furnish similar
 facilities and, apparently,
 personnel for a technological
 institute it is to construct
 in Rangoon.  The Burmese in-
 stitute was promised by Bul-
 ga.nin and Khrushchev during
 their visit to Burma, in December
 and has been planned outside
 United Nations channels.   The
 institute,like the one the USSR
 is to construct for India., will
 accommodate about 1,000 students.
 The Soviet Union probably
 will endeavor to make these in-
 stitutes the most advanced in
 South and Southeast Asia.  With
 the expanded educational ex-
 change program, they will be
 effective means of promoting
 Soviet technical methods and
 Soviet-type planning for coun-

 influence is already in ascend-

 students, and a by-product of

 Soviet offers has apparently
 inspired a certain amount of
 public enthusiasm in Kabul.
 Recent informal protests by the
 Afghan Foreign Ministry to the
 American embassy against "en-
 croachment upon Afghan sover-
 eignty" by American balloons
 and USIS propaganda against a
 country "with whom Afghanistan
 has friendly relations" may
 also reflect Kabul's more fa-
 vorable attitude toward the USSR.
 On the other hand, unusual
 publicity has been given to the
 signing of a $2,500,000 techni-
 cal assistance agreement with
 the United States, and top Af-
 ghan officials have stressed
 their desire for more American
 assistance.   This suggests Ka-
 bul is eager to keep its rela-

 in some kind of balance.
 Radio Kabul has announced
 the beginning of Russian lan-

 is also a report that Soviet
 cultural magazines in Russian
 and Persian are to be printed
 in Kabul and that Soviet agri-
 cultural magazines in Persian
 are to be. distributed in the

 the Afghan government is not
 resisting Soviet efforts at
 cultural penetration as vigor-
 ously as it has in the past.

 position in the Coal-
 Steel Community.
 At the begin-
 ning of the current
 negotiations in Feb-
 ruary, France demanded
 that political rein-
 tegration of the Saar
 with Germany be slowed
 to keep pace with
 economic integration
 which France had
 wanted to extend over
 a decade.   There are
 indications, however,
 that the French may
 now be prepared to
 come close to a Ger-
 man counterproposal
 for a two-year political inte-
 gration period, possibly with
 some arrangement permitting Saar
 participation in the 1957 Bun-
 destag elections,
 Remarks made by Secretary
 of State for Foreign Affairs
 Maurice Faure to American of-
 ficials on 24 February suggest
 that Paris is now prepared to
 write off the whole territory
 as a French economic asset.
 Faure pointed to the "magnitude
 of France's sacrifice" of the
 Saar,  its second most important
 foreign customer, and hitherto
 a key factor in the maintenance
 of the franc zone's favorable
 trade balance with West Germany.
 Faure considers German willing-
 ness to try to "maintain" French-
 Saar economic relations as
 mostly "theoretical."
 Paris'   two minimum demands
 in return are German acquiescence
 in canalization of the Moselle
 River and confirmation of the
 existing French-Saar agreement
 on exploitation of the rich
 Warndt coal field.   The German
 negotiators' current position
 on Moselle canalization is con-
 fined to objections on purely
 economic grounds:   that the
 French can attain their objective
 of making the Lorraine steel
 industry more competitive by
 electrifying the Moselle rail
 lines or even sooner by inter-
 national agreement to lower
 existing rail rates.
 The German negotiators,
 however, admit the "symbolic
 value" of the  Mo

 The Benelux countries--

 Continuation of the exist-

 coal field is seen by the French
 as essential for the future
 of the Lorraine metallurgical
 industry, but is strenuously
 objected to by the Saarlanders.
 Most of this coal field under-

 mined from pitheads in France.
 The Saarlanders accuse the
 French of mining only the veins
 closest to the surface, leav-

 The Masjumi-led cabinet,
 having won parliamentary ap-
 proval of the bill to abrogate
 the Netherlands-Indonesian
 Union, plans to resign shortly
 and assume caretaker status.
 It may resign before the elected
 parliament is installed between
 10 and 20 March.
 The three major non-Commu-
 nist parties are engaged in
 informal discussions.   The Na-
 tional Party (PNI), which heads
 the opposition, the Masjumi,
 and the Nahdiatul Ulama (NU)
 reportedly have agreed in prin-
 ciple to form a coalition gov-
 ernment but they have not yet
 agreed on a program.
 The Masjumi,  which had
 been isolated from other non-
 Communist parties through the
 tactics of President Sukarno
 and the PNI, now appears to
 have increased its prestige by
 bringing about an end to the
 Netherlands-Indonesian Union.
 This achievement, combined with
 the Masjumi's reported endorse-
 ment of the more nationalistic
 policies of the party's Vice
 Chairman Sukiman as opposed to
 those of Chairman Natsir, may
 have reduced difficulties be-

 two parties.

 The large area of disagreement
 among the three parties, how-
 ever, particularly in regard
 to personalities and the issues
 of foreign investment,  foreign
 policy, and tolerance of Com-
 munist activity, foreshadows
 difficulties.   Should this
 effort fail, the alternative of
 a PNI-NU-small party coalition
 probably will be accepted.
 This would be a return to the
 so-called "Ali formula" of
 1953-55 whereby the government
 depended on Communist parlia-
 mentary support.
 Meanwhile, Vice President
 Hatta--probably the best in-
 formed and most moderate
 individual in the Indonesian
 government and a strong anti-
 Communist--has definitely
 decided to resign.   He hopes
 to combat Communism through
 the medium of the co-operative
 movement, which, under his
 guidance, is developing fairly
 rapidly among the villages.
 His departure will remove the
 most important restraining in-
 fluence on President Sukarno,
 who appears to believe that
 he can use the Communists for
 his political advantage and
 eventually discard them.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 March 1956.
 Thai Government Reaffirms
 Anti-Communist Policies
 The Thai government's
 crackdown last week on ele-
 ments agitating for closer po-
 litical and trade ties with
 Communist China appears to be
 a result of a decision not to
 alter its strongly anti-Commu-
 nist policies at this time.
 On 21 February, the police
 arrested parliamentary member
 Thep Chotinuchit and members
 of his party at the.Bangkok
 airport on their return from
 a month's tour of Communist
 China.   This action is in
 marked contrast to the govern-
 ment's equivocation prior to
 Thep's departure.   Thep has
 warned that he will use public
 hearings on his case to compare
 favorably conditions in Commu-
 nist China with those in Thai-
 land.
 The government, which re-
 portedly intends to try Thep
 for "treason," can if it so
 chooses, however, prevent the
 press from publicizing Thep's
 statements.   The police also
 arrested leaders of.the weekly
 gatherings at Bangkok's "Hyde
 Park," which these elements
 have used as a forum for.attacks
 against the government and
 noisy pleas for a Sino-Thai
 rapprochement.   The government
 has since lifted its temporary
 Chinese Communists Occupy
 island in Sou       na Sea
 The Chinese Communists in
 the past six months have occu-
 pied at least one island in the
 Paracel group in the South
 China Sea, midway between Viet-
 nam and the Philippines.   The
 Paracels, claimed by several
 countries, are made up of a
 ban on further such meetings.
 Bangkok newspapers were warned
 that writers commenting favor-
 ably on China would be subject
 to prosecution under Thailand's
 stiff anti-Communist law.
 These actions follow a
 six-month period in which there
 were strong indications that
 the government was re-examin-
 ing its anti-Communist policies,
 possibly feeling its way to-
 ward a normalization of rela-
 tions with Peiping.   The rea-
 sons for the sudden about-face
 are obscure.  Thai leaders may
 have concluded that the public
 agitation for a Sino-Thai rap-
 prochement, which some of them
 seemed to have stimulated, was
 unduly embarrassing Thailand
 in its relations with the
 United States, especially in
 view of the approaching SEATO
 meeting at Karachi.
 The arrest of Thep and
 related moves will be highly
 unpopular with many Thai in-
 tellectuals, whose neutralist
 and pro-Communist tendencies
 became apparent after the gov-
 ernment relaxed its authori-
 tarian controls last summer.

 Inflation Again Threatens

 Rhee has taken cognizance

 black-market exchange rate,
 which has been rising steadily

 inflation was caused by fluctua-

 following the receipt in January
 of an additional $25,000,000
 in American aid to encourage
 anti-inflation efforts, Korean
 counterinflation measures ap-
 pear to have weakened consider-
 ably.
 Certain recent develop-
 ments--such as the action by
 the Bank of Korea. raising the
 ceiling on commercial loans,
 the delay in the sale of govern-
 ment dollars to businessmen,
 and  the   failure   to  raise
 fertilizer and monopolized com-
 modity prices--promise to weaken
 the currency further.
 The chronic inflation re-
 suits  largely  from  South
 Korea's  attempts to live be-
 yond its means.   It maintains
 a 720,000-ma.n military estab-
 lishment and has an unrea.listi-
 cally ambitious investment
 program. The current year's
 budget is expected to show a,
 deficit of about $140,000,000..
 Among the effects of this in-
 flation is the fact that it
 has discouraged the accumula-
 tion of capital essential to
 any private investment in
 Korean development and has
 priced Korean goods out of
 world markets.
 Instability Continues in Peru
 The ending of the Iquitos
 rebellion on 25 February leaves
 the Peruvian regime of General
 Odria still threatened by under-
 lying disaffection.  New dis-
 turbances can be expected if
 Odria fails to satisfy important
 elements in the country that
 the presidential and congres-
 sional elections scheduled for
 .June will not be rigged.
 The Iquitos uprising,  like
 the strikes and student demon
 stra.tions at Arequipa last
 December, reflected the growing
 popular concern that Odria. in-
 tends to rig the elections in
 order to perpetuate himself in
 power, despite the constitu-
 tional ban on a. president suc-
 ceeding himself.   Most top
 military leaders apparently
 desire free elections

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 NEW CONSTITUTION NO CURE FOR PAKISTAN'S POLITICAL PROBLEMS
 Pakistan's long-awaited
 constitution seems to be on the
 verge of approval by the Constit-
 uent Assembly.  The perennial
 conflict between East and West
 Pakistan will probably continue,
 however, even after approval of
 the document.   The struggle for
 personal power among individual
 politicians in both parts of
 the country will also continue.
 The result is bound to be a
 politically fragmented govern-
 ment whose policies will re-

 Iskander Mirza defeated this
 move by threatening to declare
 martial law in East Pakistan,
 home province of Fazlul Huq,
 leader of the United Front.
 Price of Success
 However, Chaudhri Mohammad
 All and Mirza have had to ac-
 cept dangerous modifications in
 the original draft to effect
 passage of the constitution.
 The executive power on
 which the government has in
 the past relied to deal with
 parliamentary and provincial
 obstructionism has been greatly
 weakened.   The wealthy West
 Pakistani landowners and indus-
 trialists on whom the ruling
 Moslem League must rely for
 support have succeeded in lim-
 iting the government's right
 of eminent domain.   No deter-
 mination has been made of the
 crucial issue as to whether
 Moslem and non-Moslems should
 vote in the same or separate
 electorates.
 Constitutional Progress
 Prime Minister Chaudhri
 Mohammad Ali's unrelenting
 pressure on the Constituent
 Assembly has resulted in ap-
 proval of all but a few clauses
 of the draft constitution.
 The most serious challenge
 of the constitution was the
 United Front's threat to with-
 draw from the government coa-
 lition and to join the opposi-
 tion Awami League to form a
 united East Pakistani resist-
 ance to the passage of  the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Interdir Minister r United Front Leader
 Fazinl hurl
 Designation of Pakistan
 as an "Islamic Republic" and
 denial of the presidency to
 anyone except a Moslem are im-
 portant and potentially dan-
 gerous concessions to extremist
 religious groups.   Mirza has
 steadfastly opposed these pro-
 visions and has managed to de-
 lay the crucial second read-
 ing of them in the assembly,
 but Chaudhri Mohammad All and
 other West Pakistani politica.ns
 who have been using the ortho-
 dox elements to increase their
 power have been afraid to in-
 sist on a secular constitution.
 Inclusion of the Moslem
 provisions will continue to
 isolate the large Hindu minor-
 ity in East Pakistan and has
 already resulted in the three
 Hindu minority parties instruct-
 ing their ministers to resign
 from the central and East Pak-
 istani governments.
 Opposition in East Pakistan
 This Hindu withdrawal,  to-
 gether with the defection of
 some key Moslem leaders of the
 United Front,  leaves less than
 half of the East Pakistani mem-
 bers of the assembly in favor
 of the constitution and lends
 support to the charge that the
 document is being imposed on
 East Pakistan.   The opposition
 is carefully recording this fact
 by demanding roll-call votes
 on all important issues.   Polit-
 ical posters to this effect are
 reportedly already appearing
 in East Pakistan.   The intensity
 of this opposition makes the
 fall of the United Front pro-
 vincial government in East Pak-
 istan likely if the provincial
 assembly convenes as scheduled
 in mid-March.
 The fall of the East Pak-
 istani government may be pre-
 vented by the appointment of
 Fazlul Huq as governor and by
 dissolution of the provincial
 assembly, with the present min-
 istry continuing as a caretaker
 government.   This presumably
 would be less inflammatory than
 direct rule by the central gov-
 ernment, which could also be
 undertaken.   Nevertheless, the
 struggle between the eastern
 and western parts of the country
 will probably be renewed almost
 immediately after passage of
 the constitution on the issues
 of joint Hindu-Moslem.or sepa-
 rate electorates and the selec-
 tion of a provisional president
 of Pakistan.

 state and separate electorates.
 East Pakistan is eager for a
 joint electorate to erase Hindu-
 Moslem divisions and to enable
 formation of a united East Pak-
 istani bloc.
 Political Struggle
 The challenge of discon-
 tent in East Pakistan will
 have to be met in the first
 national election  under the
 constitution.   This election,
 which is supposed to take place
 within a year after approval
 of the constitution, appears
 to be the opportunity that op-
 position leader Suhrawardy now
 hopes to seize to effect his
 Moslem League President
 Abdur Rab Nishtar
 return to national prominence.
 He alone has support in both
 parts of the country, and he
 alone has championed East Pak-
 istan in the debate on the con-
 stitution.
 The present leaders of the
 Karachi government have little
 reason to look forward to an
 election.  Mirza has no polit-
 ical following, and although
 his selection as first provi-
 sional president is likely, he
 is apparently already being by-
 passed by politicians maneuver-
 ing for power in West Pakistan.
 Chaudhri Mohammad Ali also
 has little popular support.   Al-
 though he now seems to be in
 alliance with newly elected
 Moslem League president Nishtar
 and seasoned Punjabi leader'Daul-
 tana,  he may find himself dis-
 carded if the outcome of the
 election  raises the possibility
 of his replacement as prime
 minister.
 Prospects

 likely that the Pakistani gov-
 ernment's stability will be in-
 creased by adoption of a con-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
 Pre-election political
 maneuvering in South Korea is
 centered on competition for
 the vice-presidential nomination
 of the dominant Liberal Party.
 A party convention to name the
 candidates is reportedly planned
 for 5-6 March and the election
 for some time in May.
 Rhee's Role
 The assumption that 80-
 year-old President Rhee will
 be re-elected but will not
 live out his four-year term
 has made the vice presidency
 the immediate goal of South
 Korean politicians.
 Split-ticket voting being
 permitted, it would theoret-
 ically be possible for Presi-
 dent Rhee to be re-elected
 with a member of the opposition
 as vice president.   However,
 although, Liberal Party officials
 have reportedly expressed con-
 cern over popular gains by the
 opposition, the fact that the
 Liberal Party controls patron-
 age and the instruments of co-
 ercion make its retention of
 both posts likely.
 Any Liberal vice-presi-
 dential nominee will benefit
 from identification with Rhee,
 who, although the target of
 increasing criticism since the
 armistice, is still regarded
 as the embodiment of Korea's
 national aspirations.   None-
 theless, should Rhee pass over
 party chairman Yi Ki-pung, re-
 garded as the leading contender
 for the vice presidency, disap-
 pointment among Yi's followers
 could disrupt the party organi-
 zation.   In 1948 and 1952 Rhee
 chose weak running mates rather
 than risk any challenge to his
 authority.
 Liberal Party Tactics
 In 1952 Rhee received 75
 percent of the popular vote in
 an election in which the free
 ballot was considerably neutral-
 ized by the intimidation of
 antiadministration groups.
 Such tactics may be kept to a
 minimum this year in view of
 the increased efficiency of
 the Liberal Party organization
 and the country's greater in-
 ternal stability.
 Opposition Groups
 The main opposition to
 the Liberal Party comes from
 the Democratic Party--whose
 considerable popular support
 is somewhat offset by rivalries
 --and from the incipient Republi-
 can Party, which may endorse
 Rhee but compete for the vice
 presidency.   The Liberals are
 portraying Rhee as the person
 most qualified to deal with
 American officials;  and Am-
 bassador Yang in Washington
 has stated that American aid
 to South Korea would end if
 Rhee were not re-elected.
 Meanwhile, the possibility
 that the recent assassination
 of South Korea's counterintelli-
 gence chief was politically
 motivated has brought into the
 open a power struggle between
 two factions: a moderate, pro-
 American group centering about
 Yi Ki-pung, Defense Minister
 Son and Army Chief of Staff
 Chong;  and a group which includes

 THE DILEMMA OF SOVIET LITERARY POLICY
 Continuing debate in Soviet
 publications on the problems of
 Soviet literature shows that
 official policy toward the arts
 remains unsettled.   Differences
 of opinion as to the extent to
 which the party should regulate
 creative activity, evident with-
 in the literary fraternity for
 some time, may be reaching into
 the upper levels of the party
 as well.
 Propaganda Instruments
 The regime has always rec-
 ognized literature as a vital
 instrument of propaganda, and
 Soviet writers, whom Stalin
 called "engineers of the human
 soul,t" are considered employees
 of the state just as much as
 factory managers.   In recent
 years, however, the popular ap-
 peal, and therefore the effec-
 tiveness, of the officially
 subsidized product has notice-
 ably declined.   Frequent signs
 of impatience among creative
 artists with the deadening re-
 straints imposed by the party
 and of consumer resistance to
 a. dull product have presented
 the regime with a dilemma--how
 to maintain ideological con-
 formity without choking off all
 creative inventiveness.
 The violent postwar liter-
 ary purge directed by the late
 politburo member, Andrei Zhdanov,
 which attempted to place Soviet
 literature in a rigid party
 strait jacket, had run its
 course before 1952.   Deliver-
 ing the central committee re-
 ports to the 19th Party Con-
 gress, in October 1952, Georgi
 Malenkov scored the prevalence
 of hack writing and called on
 Soviet writers to give their
 work more variety and interest.
 He suggested a  revival  of
 satire as a means of exposing
 the "negative" in Soviet life.
 While moving away from the ex-
 tremes of the "Zha.ndovshchina,"
 however, he emphasized that
 the basic standard of Soviet
 literature was "party-minded-
 ness."
 Appeals for Relaxation
 Following Stalin's death,
 there were signs of a changed
 atmosphere.   During the period
 of the so-called "thaw" in late
 1953 and early 1954, there were
 several rather bold appeals for
 a relaxation of political con-
 trols over the arts.   In the
 spring and summer of 1954 the
 regime answered with an emphatic
 "no."  Total repression was not
 revived, however, and the
 Second Congress of the Union
 of Soviet Writers, which met
 in December 1954, heard a
 relatively uninhibited expres-
 sion of divergent views.
 Discussion at the congress
 steered clear of the basic
 issue of political control,
 but frequently called for
 greater aesthetic latitude and
 a more imaginative approach

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1 March 1956
 within the orthodox political
 framework.       The defenders of
 the status quo counterattacked,
 but in the absence of an au-
 thoritative pronouncement from
 the party, the congress ended
 on an inconclusive note.
 During 1955, the debate
 between the "conformists" and
 the "reformists" continued at
 literary conferences and in the
 Soviet press.   The argument
 ostensibly centered around
 questions of aesthetics, that
 is,  how much latitude of style
 and method a writer may exer-
 cise in his portrayal of "so-
 cialist reality." However,
 behind the narrower issue of
 style, argued out in the tech-
 nical jargon of Marxist liter-
 ary criticism, a faction of
 Soviet writers who are chafing
 at the bit of party control
 may be raising the question of
 substance.
 Literary Gazette Editorial
 A clear statement of the
 conformist position can be
 found in an editorial which
 appeared in Literary Gazette
 in April 1955.   Socialist
 realism permits originality
 of form and style, the editori-
 al contended, and no one seeks
 to impose a single,  inflexible
 standard.   "But," it continued,
 "diversity is not omnivorous-
 ness, diffuseness.....It is
 necessary that the diversity
 of means of which art disposes
 should serve one purpose--the
 affirmation of socialist life,
 of socialist ideology."

 Articles published in
 Pravda and Literary Gazette in
 November 19i , on the M th an-
 niversary of the publication of
 Lenin's work on Bolshevik lit-
 erature, likewise strongly re-
 affirmed the propagandistic
 function of Soviet literature.
 They referred to the militant
 Zhdanov decrees on culture,
 asserting that they would re-
 main the basis of party policy
 for a long time to come.
 Kommunist Editorial
 Ignoring these strictures,
 however, an editorial in the
 December issue of the party's
 theoretical journal, Kommunist,
 carried the claims for aesthet-
 ic flexibility further than any-
 thing that had appeared in the
 party press since the end of
 World War II.   Without mention-
 ing Malenkov,  the editorial dis-
 cussed and took issue with many
 of the views expressed by him
 at the 19th Party Congress.
 While not denying its
 political function, the article
 argued that literature is a
 unique.-form of expression and
 is not''bound by the rules of
 exposition applied in the social
 science's.   The creative writer
 should,  in other words, have
 some freedom to decide how his
 message is to be presented.   A
 strictly literal interpretation
 of official literary precepts
 can lead to schematization and
 oversimplification which, the
 author implied, are among the
 major defects of Soviet litera-
 ture
 It is the writer's duty to
 portray what is typical in So-
 viet life, the article conceded,
 out it is not tree, as Malenkov
 asserted in his party congress
 speech, that only that which
 corresponds to "the essence of
 a given social force" is typi-
 cal.   Literature should,  in-
 stead, reflect actuality in a
 "concretely sensuous form, em-
 bodying the general in what is
 individual."   Stripped of its
 Marxian terminology,  this a-
 mounted to a 'ball for humanized
 characters living in a recog-
 nizable world instead of stere-
 otyped  party paragons acting
 out abstract Communist formulas,
 Equally narrow and harmful
 is the approach which equates
 "typical" and "party-minded,"
 Kommunist continued, again tak-
 ing issue with Malenkov.   It is
 not true, the article argued,
 that the merit of a creative
 work depends at all times and
 all places on the extent to
 which it applies a conventional
 party analysis to every politi-
 cal, social and economic prob-
 lem.                                                            Some of the works of pre-
 revolutionary writers and of
 contemporary foreign writers,
 for example, can be called
 "progressive" even though they
 do not have a strictly Marxian
 point of view.
 The argument was carried
 no further than this.   It is
 not clear whether the author
 was suggesting indirectly that
 Soviet literature should be
 judged by the same standards.
 On this point nevertheless he
 had at least skirted a basic
 issue, for it is insistence
 on "party-mindedness" which
 lies at the core of party con-
 trol of the arts.
 Issue Remains Unsettled
 Expression of these views
 in Kommunist, and subsequently
 in the regional press where
 the editorial was republished,
 suggest that they have some
 support within the party.   The
 rejection of views expressed
 by Malenkov may be an attempt
 to saddle him with responsi-
 bility for the woes of Soviet
 literature.   It seems more
 likely, however,  that the at-
 tack was directed against the
 literary position represented
 by Stalin and Zhdanov, and may
 have been intended as a state-
 ment that the present leadership
 dissociates itself from the re-
 strictive policies of the past.

 The issue has-not been
 settled in favor of a relaxa-
 tion and liberalization of
 literary policy.   The keynote
 speeches at the recent regional
 party congresses, for example,
 gave no hints of a softer line.
 A. I. Kirichenko, a member of
 the all-Union party presidium
 and first secretary of the
 Ukrainian party, speaking to
 the Ukrainian congress, on the
 contrary, asked the party to
 increase its influence on
 literature.   He noted a slack-
 ening in "implementation of the
 historical decisions of the
 CPSU concerning literature and
 the arts--decisions which have
 formulated principles of party
 policy in ideological work," a
 reference to the Zhdanov de-
 crees.
 The Soviet press only
 recently attacked a prominent
 writer who, following the
 party's demand for exposure of
 "negative outlook" and "bour-
 geois survivals," had written
 a novel on life in the new ag-
 ricultural lands which over-
 emphasized the "negative."
 Past experience should have
 taught Soviet writers to move
 carefully until a clear, un-
 ambigious line has been laid
 down by the party.
 State Continues Control
 The regime, recognizing the
 value of literature as a medium
 of persuasion among a people
 which still has memories of a
 splendid literary tradition,
 may be tempted to make limited
 concessions in order to lift
 Soviet literature from its
 present depressed state and to
 prevent erosion of the alle-
 giance of its intelligentsia.
 Literature in the USSR, however,
 always has been the servant of
 the state and Soviet writers
 will be expected to stay within
 party-defined limits.
 Khrushchev, in his speech
 to the party congress, made it
 clear that, during a period
 when a limited extension of
 cultural interchange with the
 West has been allowed in the
 interest of propaganda and dip-
 lomatic objectives,  the party
 must guard against a relaxation
 of ideological discipline and
 the infiltration of "alien" in-
 fluiices.   The search for a
 more tolerable balance between
 ideological conformity and
 artistic creativity remains,
 therefore, a troublesome
 problem for the regime.
