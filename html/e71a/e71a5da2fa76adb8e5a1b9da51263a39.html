"ROLLING THUNDER" AND BOMB DAMAGE 
TO BRIDGES 
Kenneth C. Fuller, Bruce Smith, and Merle Atkins 
The program known as Rolling Thunder, a systematic but restrained 
air offensive against selected economic and military targets in North 
Vietnam, began on 2 March 1965. The basic objectives of Rolling 
Thunder were to reduce the ability of North Vietnam to support the 
Communist insurgencies in South Vietnam and Laos; to increase pro-
gressively the pressure on North Vietnam to the point where the re-
gime would decide it was too costly to continue directing and support-
ing the insurgency in the south; and to bolster the confidence and 
morale of the South Vietnamese. As the days of the air campaign over 
North Vietnam stretched into months, the requirement developed in 
Washington and particularly in the White House for independent 
assessments of the results. As a consequence, CIA was asked to make 
its own assessment of the bombing campaign as well as to join the 
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in the preparation of an analysis 
for the Secretary of Defense. The work on bomb damage to bridges, 
which is discussed in this paper, is one example of the reporting on 
the Rolling Thunder program. Although the extent of damage and the 
cost of repair are the principal topics discussed here, the White House 
was equally concerned to find out how much time would be needed 
to restore lines of communication (LOCs ). 
Background 
North Vietnam's major contributions to the war in the south have 
been its military manpower, its function as the control center for the 
insurgency, and its function as the logistics funnel through which 
materiel, mostly from the USSR and Communist China, has moved 
into South Vietnam. Consequently the attainment of the first objective 
of Rolling Thunder hinged almost entirely on the ability to impede 
or stop the flow of men and supplies from North Vietnam to South 
Vietnam. Although a number of different target systems were taken 
under attack, the Rolling Thunder campaign was essentially and at

times almost exclusively an interdiction program. A standard bombing 
strategy to achieve such a goal was to stop or slow military traffic in 
rear areas by interdicting critical choke points along heavily used 
LOC's. Bridges of course qualify as such, and during Rolling Thunder 
more attack sorties were flown against bridge targets than against 
any other fixed target system. 
As the bombing campaign progressed, policy-makers and high-level 
Presidential advisors started asking the intelligence community to 
assess the effectiveness of the effort. Among the questions posed were 
those on the status of damaged bridges and North Vietnamese counter-
measures to bypass the bridges. The Secretary of Defense specifically 
wanted to know the number of bridges damaged, the estimated cost 
of repairing the damage, whether or not the flow of traffic south was 
being effectively impeded, how quickly the bridges could be re-
stored, and the net impact on logistics capabilities. Answering these 
questions proved to be a knotty problem. 
Number of Damaged Bridges 
In one of his columns in 1966, Art Buchwald pointed out that avail-
able statistics suggested that the US apparently had destroyed all of 
the bridges in North Vietnam many times over. He concluded that we 
must be "dropping our own bridges on North Vietnam and then bomb-
ing them." Buchwald's quips contained much truth. During the early 
months of the bombing campaign, depending on the sources being 
used and the degree of discrimination exercised, one could get an 
extraordinary variety of estimates of the total number of destroyed 
bridges in North Vietnam, ranging from as low as 657 to as high 
as 7,000. When total "bridge-kills" began approaching these incredible 
numbers, it became apparent that a new basis of intelligence assess-
ment was in order. Before we could get at the matter of the true 
extent and nature of the damage and the impact of the program on 
the enemy's logistic activities, however, there were fundamental prob-
lems to be resolved including such basic questions as when is a 
bridge a bridge. Within CIA the job was given to the Construction 
Branch of the Office of Economic Research (OER). 
Analysts from OER, in consultation with DIA, discovered that early 
estimates of destroyed bridges were compiled almost exclusively from 
pilot reports. Now it is very difficult for a pilot to assess accurately 
the results of a strike while traveling at high speed and when the

target area is obscured by smoke and dust. To narrow the credibility 
gap concerning the number of bridges damaged, OER analysts decided 
that the only reliable method was to use "hard" evidence provided 
through the eye of a camera rather than the fleeting evidence pro-
vided through the eye of a pilot. Starting in September 1965, there-
fore, a special task force consisting of personnel from OER and DIA 
and the Imagery Analysis Service (IAS) spent many man-hours re-
viewing all reconnaissance missions flown over North Vietnam search-
ing for damaged bridges. This intensive search, completed in March 
1966, revealed that 216 bridges actually had been destroyed during 
the first year of the interdiction campaign, compared with 657 in what 
were at that time the currently most conserative assessments. The 
figure rose to a high of 541 destroyed bridges by the end of the bomb-
ing program in October 1968. 
Once the principle of using aerial photography was adopted as the 
sole source of information from which to make hard estimates, a 
group of CIA/IAS photo interpreters was assigned the tedious but 
important task of scanning all photographic missions looking for 
damaged bridges. Each bridge crossing was measured and cataloged, 
and a photograph of each was prepared for later analysis by OER. 
During the three years of bombing, personnel in the Construction 
Branch analyzed and filed over 2,500 prints covering some 600 bridges. 
These photographs provided the basic input for answering many ques-
tions posed by the Department of Defense and the White House on 
the effectiveness of the interdiction campaign. 
Conceptual Problems 
Before an accurate bridge count could be attempted, a number of 
conceptual problems had to be solved. One such problem was how to 
define precisely what constituted a bridge. It appeared somewhat 
irrational to place a 10 or 20 foot water crossing in the same category 
as the 1,000 foot bridge at Viet Tri or the mile-long Paul Doumer 
bridge crossing the Red River near Hanoi. Many of the smaller cross-
ings could more accurately be described as culverts, causeways, or 
simply improved fords, and thus were excluded from the bridge count. 
Another problem that arose concerned the definition of a "destroyed" 
or "damaged" bridge. Mere cratering of bridge approaches or "near 
misses" in adjacent rice paddies could not be counted as damage 
serious enough to interdict a water crossing. The concept of Severe

SECRET "Rolling Thunder" 
Damage Occurrence ( SDO ) was developed, therefore, to assess bomb 
damage. An SDO was defined as damage sufficiently severe to deny 
a crossing to users until a significant amount of repairs had been 
performed, requiring considerable time, materials, and labor. For ex-
ample, serious damage would include a dropped span, a destroyed 
pier, or a destroyed abutment. Holes in a deck, cratered approaches, 
twisted superstructure, or a slight shifting of spans was not considered 
serious damage. 
In 1967 a study of the effectiveness of bombing bridges in North 
Vietnam was made by OER analysts. A sample of 46 Joint Chiefs of 
Staffs ( JCS ) target bridges which had severe damage was used. The 
study covered the period from the start of bombing through January 
1967. Photography provided most of the information for the assess-
ment of the extent of damage to the bridges, and bomb damage assess-
ment reports provided data on the volume and types of ordnance 
used. The study revealed that there were 249 hits out of 11,744 
bombs dropped, for an average of one hit for every 47 bombs dropped. 
In other words, slightly over 2 percent of all bombs dropped succeeded 
in damaging a bridge to such an extent that it needed extensive repairs. 
Cost of Repair 
In addition to an accurate count of interdicted bridges, policy-
makers wanted to know what it would cost to rebuild destroyed 
bridges to their original state. The best method to arrive at an aggre-
gate cost figure would to be use North Vietnamese costs for bridge 
construction in terms of dongs and then convert the dong figure 
into US dollars according to an appropriate dong-dollar construction 
ratio. This ideal approach could not be followed because of our com-
plete lack of statistical data on North Vietnamese construction costs. 
The procedure finally adopted was therefore a compromise, but it did 
enable the calculation of relative values. 
The costing methodology involved selecting a number of US 
bridges for which construction costs were available and which were 
similar in design to many bridges in North Vietnam. Unit costs for 
labor, materials, and equipment were calculated and then adjusted 
to reflect construction inputs available to the North Vietnamese. The 
result of these calculations indicated that $700 per lineal foot would 
provide an order of magnitude for the cost of building permanent 
Apprived For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000MEM008-4 
ApproffalrfoiRtplope 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000%9k44008-4 
highway bridges in North Vietnam.' This figure was tested by 
referring to reports from a prominent US engineering firm that had 
estimated the construction cost of building 205 highway bridges in 
Southeast Asia. These estimates averaged $740 per lineal foot, which 
was within about six percent of the figure obtained by the OER 
method. 
In estimating the cost of repairing damage to a bridge, the struc-
ture was broken down into its component parts: abutments, piers, 
and superstructure. Relative costs for each of these components were 
then derived for each damaged bridge, and only the destroyed 
components were considered in estimating the cost of both tem-
porary and permanent repair or replacement. The estimated total 
cost figure for rebuilding all bridges to their original state rose 
from about $10 million after the first year of bombing to over $30 
million by the end of the Rolling Thunder campaign. 
A similar approach was used in estimating the cost of construction 
and repair of temporary wooden bridges. These crude, relatively 
cheap structures of simple design were easy to build. It was calcu-
lated that the cost of construction averaged $50 per lineal foot 
and required 30 men for each 20 feet of bridge under construction. 
During the entire campaign, 292 temporary wooden bypass bridges 
were built at an estimated cost of $10,000,000. 
In addition to bridges, over 500 bypasses of other types were 
constructed. These consisted of pontoon bridges, causeways, ferry 
slips and fords, at a cost of approximately $3,000,000. In this instance, 
the real burden was the requirement for large numbers of personnel 
to construct, maintain, and repair these crossings. Manpower re-
quirements were far more burdensome than material costs, especially 
during 1966 and early 1967. In these years it is estimated that 72,000 
full time and nearly 200,000 part time workers were required to keep 
the LOC's open. At the same time there were several Chinese en-
gineer battalions totalling more than 20,000 troops working on the 
roads and railroads north of Hanoi. 
Highway bridges were used as the basis for all estimates. The cost of recon-
structing railroad and combination (rail/highway) bridges was obtained, generally 
.speaking, by doubling highway bridge costs. Railroad bridges are designed to carry 
much- heaver loads than highway bridges, which means a significant increase in 
the volume of materials used and much heavier foundations.

StCKt 'Roiling Thunder" 
Countermeasures 
One of Newton's laws states that "for every action there is a 
reaction that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the 
action.' Three years of examining photographs of destroyed bridges 
indicated that this dictum also applied to the North Vietnamese 
program to counter the effects of the bombing. During the early 
months of the Rolling Thunder program, the North Vietnamese were 
unable to repair LOC's as fast as they were damaged. It took them 
several months to organize their labor force and pre-position ma-
terials near anticipated areas of attack. After two years of bombing, 
however, they had so organized their construction effort that they 
built and repaired bridges and other bypasses faster than the crossings 
could be interdicted. Their modus operandi was to rely on labor in-
tensive repair techniques and local building materials. They stockpiled 
stone, bamboo, and timber near expected targets and assigned con-
struction personnel to nearby semipermanent work camps to maintain 
and repair allotted segments of the LOC's. As the campaign neared 
its end the North Vietnamese countermeasures had been perfected 
to a point that many of the serious damage occurrences could be 
repaired in hours rather than days. The main emphasis in the North 
Vietnamese countermeasures program, and the main reason for its 
ultimate success, however, was, the strategy of building multiple by-
passes for all important crossing points. 
Types of Bypasses 
The type of bypass chosen for construction was generally determined 
by the nature of the terrain, and the number of bypasses constructed 
at a crossing point depended on the importance of the route. Fords 
were common in the mountainous regions where streams are shallow 
and narrow. Cable bridges with removable decking were usually 
constructed where the stream banks were high, and where the 
streams were fairly narrow but deep. Temporary wooden bridges, 
pontoon bridges, and ferries were predominent in the lowlands 
where the rivers were too wide and deep to ford. Constructed fords 
were the most common means to bypass damaged highway bridges, 
especially in the early months of the bombing campaign. They 
could be quickly built and repaired with local materials. They 
could, of course, only be employed at shallow crossings where banks 
were low. The construction of alternate bridges was also an effec-
tive countermeasure. The virtue of these bridges was their simplicity.

They were built from salvaged components and locally procured 
timber, lumber and rock. Because of their short span design they 
were easy and quick to build and repair, but difficult to destroy. 
One innovative variety which appeared, unique to North Vietnam, 
was the cable bridge, which proved to be a very effective method 
for repairing or bypassing highway bridges. Parallel steel cables 
drawn taut between anchorages on each bank were covered by 
prefabricated wood sections which provided a removable deck. The 
only method of interdiction was to bomb the cable anchorages 
buried in the river banks, which proved to be a most difficult 
assignment. Ferries and pontoon bridges were used at the 'largest 
water crossing. Ferries are a relatively inefficient means of rapidly 
moving a large volume of goods and were used mainly to carry 
rail traffic over major river crossings. Pontoon or float bridges proved 
to be effective bypasses for truck traffic. They were difficult to 
interdict because they could be divided into sections and hidden along 
river banks. 
Number of Bypasses 
The trend of the North Vietnamese countermeasures effort can 
be illustrated by the change in the average number of bypasses 
built for important JCS-targeted bridges. Repeated aerial photography 
indicated that the numbers steadily increased, as shown in the

Why Bypasses? 
The North Vietnamese preoccupation with the construction of 
bypasses was a well-conceived response to the bombing campaign. 
In effect, they dispersed their LOC chokepoints just as they had dis-
persed their POL storage facilities and other targets which gave their 
system a built-in redundancy that greatly lessened its vulnerability to 
effective air attack. Multiple bypasses at a single crossing generally 
were placed so far apart that the dispersion pattern of a bomb stick 
would bracket only one bypass at a time. ( See Figure 1.) Therefore, 
where it may have taken one raid to interdict a crossing during the 
early days of the bombing program, in later periods it took two or 
three raids to interdict the same crossing. The most important rail/ 
highway crossing in North Vietnam is the Paul Doumer Bridge over the 
Red River at Hanoi; at one time it was supported by 20 bypasses. 
Multiple bypasses thus increased the probability that at least one 
crossing at a site would always remain serviceable. In addition, 
because it normally took as much ordnance to interdict a bypass as 
to interdict the original bridge, the cost of bombing a water crossing 
in North Vietnam increased much faster than the cost of repairing 
it with cheap local materials. At the same time, US aircraft were 
subjected to the same risks when attacking bypasses as when at-
tacking the original bridge. 
After the Bombing Halt 
The story of estimating bomb damage and analyzing North Viet-
namese countermeasures abruptly ended on 31 October 1968 when 
the bombing program was stopped. However, the expertise and 
voluminous files that were built up over three years of work are 
still useful. These assets now provide the basis for estimating the 
extent and speed of reconstruction rather than the cost and effect 
of destruction. Also, they will provide a valuable data base for 
the historian or anyone doing a post-mortem on the Rolling Thunder 
program.

CLOUD NINE: A PROBLEM IN 
INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION 
James W. Featherstone 
On the 24th of January, 1969, there descended upon the Directorate 
for Intelligence at CIA a document that for a brief but frantic period 
was to try the resources of the Directorate in some ways more 
severely than they had ever before been tested. This document 
was a National Security Council directive, later dubbed by those 
who became affected by it, with appropriate irony, "Cloud Nine." 
This directive called for an inventory of the international situation 
as of 20 January 1969, in the form of a "current assessment of the 
political, economic, and security situation and of the major problems 
relevant to US security interests and US bilateral and multilateral 
relations" world-wide. It demanded, in addition, "a discussion, where 
appropriate, of the data upon which judgments are based, uncertain-
ties regarding the data, and alternative possible interpretations of 
the data." To make certain that the response was properly pointed, 
the directive posed, in 52 pages, a total of 893 probing questions 
touching almost every country on the globe. The answers were to 
be in the President's hands by the 20th of February, a matter of 
26 days, including weekends. 
Obviously this was a task of formidable magnitude, one that at 
first glance appeared almost impossible of fulfilment in the time span 
allotted. Of course, certain short cuts could be taken. It is always 
tempting, for example, when confronted with a requirement of 
large dimensions, to look on the shelf for already canned material 
that could be dusted off, updated if necessary, and ladled out 
lukewarm to the consumer. Another timesaving device is to by-pass 
the usual processes of editing and review, sending forward imme-
diately from the typewriter the analyst's sweaty draft. Unfortunately, 
although in many instances, at least, the analyst views the draft as 
perfect, the editor thinks it is merely perfectible, and his ministrations 
toward that laudable end take time. 
In this case, it was decided that there would be no short cuts. 
A really fresh look at the situation would be taken, candid judgments MORI/H RP

would be rendered, and the answers would be made as incisive and 
unequivocal as it lay in our power to make them. Each answer 
would be responsibly edited, and the entire lot would be reviewed 
by two senior officers?one of them the chairman of the task force 
established to complete the project?who would ensure that, sty-
listically and substantively, the whole massive response met the high 
standards set by the DDI. In appearance the response was to be 
neat and attractive, if not as psychedelically colorful as a Madison 
Avenue product, and it was to be carefully packaged. And finally, 
in the words of the Director, as far as CIA was concerned, at least, 
the deadline would be met. His determination in this respect may 
have been influenced somewhat by knowledge that the directive 
had been levied also on the Departments of State, Defense, and 
Treasury, putting the Agency, in a sense, in competition with them 
for timely production of a quality product. 
The manner in which inter-Office and inter-Directorate teams 
were manned and organized ?to prepare the answers and get them 
edited and coordinated is a complex story in itself. Here, however, 
we propose to deal with a different aspect of the Cloud Nine problem, 
one with which we are well acquainted especially in current in-
telligence production, but which is not generally thought of until 
it becomes potentially a major obstacle, as it did in the case of 
Cloud Nine. This aspect embraces the mechanics of reproduction, 
the process of getting a clean draft typed, a final draft printed, and 
a finished product ready for distribution to meet a deadline. 
Anyone with any experience in the management of current in-
telligence is likely to be more familiar than he likes with the 
sentence, "It's in the typewriter." This sentence, usually uttered 
in a tone of bored indifference by a writer who has been asked what 
has happened to an item that has a rapidly approaching deadline, 
typifies an all too common feeling among professionals that once 
the draft is written, the work is done and the project completed. 
Would that it were so; our task would be much easier. Few, of 
course, would buy the proposition that the clerical process is as 
difficult or complex or even as valuable as the analytical/writing 
process. But the fact remains that in many instances, unless the 
analyst's work is typed and reproduced and distributed at the 
right time, the analyst might just as well not have done it at 
all, for all the effect it will have. So from this point of view, the 
clerical process, whatever else its level in the scale of values in

the profession of intelligence, is just as essential as the analytical 
one. And it is played down or disregarded only at the peril of 
derailing the entire train of intelligence production. 
In the case of Cloud Nine, it was clear from the outset that 
the production process, unless carefully managed, would unques-
tionably defeat us. This was partly the result of the sheer bulk of 
the project. It stemmed also from the decision to start from scratch 
and to apply the full editorial review machinery to the final product. 
It was closely related, obviously, to the shortness of the deadline: 
less than three weeks remained after the writing teams had been 
organized in which to finish and deliver the product. And, of course, 
the fact that all of the production personnel involved in Cloud 
Nine had other duties that normally occupied them full time, duties 
that still had to be carried on simultaneously, compounded an already 
difficult situation. Given all of these factors, it was legitimate to 
question whether the deadline would, in fact, be met as we plunged 
into work. 
It was estimated originally that CIA's response to the NSC di-
rective would require about 1,000 pages, and in actuality this estimate 
was only slightly below the mark. Each original contribution would 
be subjected to at least two levels of editing. No one, least of all 
the analyst, was hopeful that minimum alterations in the first or 
any subsequent drafts would suffice. The average editor is said to 
live by the principle that the pen is mightier than the sword, and 
it is commonly held that he forgets that both can be equally lethal 
against their natural targets. So it was conceivable that every con-
tribution to the aggregate response would have to be typed a minimum 
of three times and quite possibly, when finally reviewed, for a 
fourth. The massive size of this typing load made it potentially a 
serious obstacle to our meeting the deadline, a built-in impediment at 
every stage of production between the writer, the reviewer, and 
finally the print shop. A backlog of any consequence at any stage 
of the process could cause us to miss the target date by a wide 
margin. 
In fact, the key to the success of any large operation of this 
sort is to establish and adhere to a realistically phased writing-typing-
correction schedule that will ensure a smooth, steady, and controlled 
flow of material from the writers through the editors to the printers. 
This began, in the case of Cloud Nine, with scheduling the actual

writing so that the answers to the easier questions would be prepared 
and edited first and the more difficult ones deferred until close to 
the deadline. It was hoped, and indeed it turned out to be the 
case, that the senior reviewers would be confronted on any given 
day with no less and if possible very little more than they could 
plow through in around ten hours. Since these two gentlemen con-
stituted a marked constriction in the pipeline, having to read every-
thing, it was mandatory that their part of the operation proceed 
smoothly. 
To ensure the essential control of the flow of material, a control 
center was established in OCI's Publications Support group. Here 
a number was assigned to each question in the NSC directive ( they 
were unnumbered in the document itself) and notation made of 
the team and office responsible for producing the answer and of 
the scheduled date of delivery to the senior reviewers. As the 
various answers were written, edited, and typed in second draft, 
they were sent to the control center. The center, in turn, passed 
them to the senior reviewers. When the latter had finished massag-
ing them, they were returned to the control center, which then 
had them put on mats in final form and sent them to the print shop 
for reproduction. The control center could tell at any time, and kept 
the Task Force Chief informed, whether the production schedule 
was being maintained, where any particular answer was at any 
time, etc. The system made it possible also to have the individual 
answers printed as they were completed, regardless of sequence, 
and to ensure that assembly and pagination of the entire response 
could be done in orderly fashion at the very end of the process. 
Obviously it would have been fatal to hold the drafts until all 
parts of the response were in and had been put in the sequence 
required by the NSC directive before beginning to print them. 
The production schedule was extremely tight, and there was little 
latitude for slippage. We were fighting the clock to such an extent 
that, rather than hand carry, we used the pneumatic tube system to 
get papers from one part of the building to another without delay, 
and to keep everyone busy. At one point, the tube system broke 
down, causing a certain amount of panic until the missing papers 
were located and extracted, and business could go ahead again. 
Despite this and a few other lapses, our attack on the Cloud 
Nine problem was well-organized, and it proved to be effective. The

flow of manuscripts actually began earlier than expected, and no 
large backlog developed at any time. But even with the best or-
ganized and most rational schedule, we would still have failed to 
deliver on time if we had not had the MTST?Magnetic Tape Se-
lectric Typewriter. We had eleven, and sometimes twelve, of these 
machines at our disposal, five of them in OCI's Publication Support 
group and the remainder elsewhere in the Intelligence Directorate. 
We could have used more, since not all of the substantive teams 
had one available to them. The answers to the vast majority of 
the questions, however, were put on magnetic tape after initial editing 
and review had been completed by the substantive teams. The tapes 
and the corresponding typed drafts were then delivered to the Con-
trol Center in OCI, where the tapes were retained while the senior 
reviewers were working independently on their copies of the drafts. 
The revisions made at this level were then, with the aid of the 
MTST, incorporated in a finished, corrected tape and a final draft 
typed simultaneously. 
The advantage that the MTST has over the ordinary manual 
or electric typewriter, and its unique contribution to Cloud Nine, 
may not be apparent from this generalized description of procedures. 
So to be a little more specific: At a reasonable estimate, probably 
less than five percent of all the pages in the analysts' original type-
scripts were completely untouched in both levels of review. Retyping 
all of these pages by hand would have been enormously time-consum-
ing, not to mention the strain it would have imposed on the typists 
themselves. But when a draft on tape is run through the machine, 
the MTST retypes automatically at a very high rate of speed. The 
trained operator stops the machine wherever a correction is neces-
sary, enters the change on the new typed draft and the corrected 
tape, simultaneously, and directs the machine to proceed until the 
next change is encountered. By this means a clean, corrected draft, 
together with a new tape, is rapidly produced with a minimum 
of effort compared with what would be required without the MTST. 
Depending upon which stage of production we are talking about, 
this new draft is either a typescript designed for further review 
or a mat for printing, if final review has been completed. We believe 
that without the MTST, it would have taken about twice the num-
ber of typists twice the time to do the same job. 
A final factor bearing on our success with Cloud Nine?intangible 
but nonetheless critical--was the morale of the machine operators.

Theirs was an exacting task, and, despite the magic of the MTST, 
a nerve-racking one because of the constant pressure on them to 
get the thing done, and done accurately. Their performance was 
splendid, their pride in their work obvious and justified. At one 
point when the Task Force Chief inadvertently referred to them 
as typists, he was politely but firmly told that they were machine 
operators. The distinction is a valid one. The girls do have to be 
trained to operate the MTST, and certain stages of their work are 
somewhat akin to computer programming. 
Between February 3, when Cloud Nine drafts began to pile into 
Publication Support's office, and February 16, when the mats were 
finished, the machine operators worked every day. The five in the 
Publication Support group, alone, together with three proofreaders, 
racked up a total of 378 hours of overtime. Their supervisor had to 
watch them closely?a pleasurable occupation in any event?for signs 
of exhaustion and falling efficiency. Occasionally he had to tell one 
to pack up and go home. But he was most impressed by their energy 
and drive and their devotion to duty, which clearly went beyond 
any desire for overtime compensation. 
Once the mats were done, the only remaining hurdles to be 
surmounted were printing and assembling the answers. These tasks 
were performed in Printing Services Division's plant on the seventh 
floor of Headquarters Building, operating around the clock. Con-
sidering ?that the various parts of the project were delivered to 
the plant piece-meal and were printed on arrival, without regard 
for final order of the answers, the job of collation alone was staggering. 
Small changes in the texts, moreover, were being introduced up 
to the very last moment. Printing Services Division designated a 
Control Officer for Cloud Nine who, in close coordination with 
the Control Center in OCI, monitored the flow of mats into the 
seventh floor plant and ensured that the printing schedule was main-
tained. High standards of appearance were demanded and met. And, 
of course, in this as in other Agency components engaged in Cloud 
Nine, regular routine work requirements had to be carried on at the 
same time. 
When Cloud Nine was finished and put together, it filled 7 volumes 
and 1030 pages, counting inserts. The product was the result of a 
team effort probably unparalleled in the Agency's history, involving 
cooperation?smooth at all times?between elements of the DDP,

Tracking down Soviet 
underground nuclear 
explosions. 
WINNOWING WHEAT FROM CHAFF 
James R. Shea 
Every year hundreds of seismic events occur in the Soviet Union 
and are detected by sensors of the US Atomic Energy Detection 
System (USAEDS ). Finding out which of these disturbances are 
earthquakes and which are the dozen or so underground nuclear 
events conducted each year by the Soviets is a major task for the 
intelligence community. This has been of particular importance since 
the signing of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which 
required the Soviets to conduct all their nuclear tests underground. 
Prior to the signing of the Treaty the Soviets were known to 
have conducted only two underground nuclear tests, one in 1961 
and one in 1962, although they may well have conducted some 
additional underground nuclear events at yields below the detection 
threshold. The Soviets probably did not, however, make major use 
of underground testing from 1949 to 1963; after all they had well-
established atmospheric proving grounds at Semipalatinsk and Novaya 
Zemlya and conducting weapon development tests in the atmosphere 
was both easier, faster, and cheaper than to do them underground. 
This all changed in 1963, and our interest in underground test 
detection increased as a consequense. 
A major factor spurring on improvements in seismic detection and 
identification techniques was the possibility that a treaty banning 
all nuclear testing, including that conducted underground, might 
be signed between the US and the USSR. Such a treaty has been 
discussed, off and on, for a number of years. An alternate proposal, to 
ban all underground testing above a certain size or magnitude, has 
also been discussed extensively, but no agreement has yet emerged. 
Both of these approaches keep raising the question?how can you 
tell if a distant seismic rumble from behind the borders of the 
USSR is a natural event or a nuclear explosion, and can you be 
confident enough in your identification to rely on national means 
of verification rather than on-site inspection of suspect nuclear tests?

Wheat From Chaff 
When a seismic event is picked up on USAEDS sensors, it is 
recorded ultimately in Washington as a seismic wiggle which is 
then decoded by experts who decide, first, whether a seismic event 
has in fact occurred, and second, whether receipt of the signals 
by several separated seismographs enables an approximate location 
of the event to be determined, much in the same fashion that 
direction-finding is done to determine the source location for elec-
tromagnetic signals. 
Once an event is established as Soviet in origin, various methods 
are employed to determine whether it was an earthquake or an 
explosion. For many events the "depth of focus" can be found (the 
depth beneath the earth's surface at which the disturbance occurred), 
and often this turns out to be so great that there is no question 
that the event was natural, simply because no one can drill shot 
emplacement holes to, e.g., depths of tens of kilometers. Other 
seismic analysis tools such as "complexity" ( earthquakes normally 
produce more complicated seismic records than do nuclear tests) 
and "first motion" ( shock direction at the focal point is normally 
outward, or compressive or an explosion and is compressive and 
rarefactive in opposing quadrants for an earthquake) also help identify 
some events. Shallow earthquakes put more energy into surface wave 
motion than do explosions. Although deep earthquakes have about 
the same surface wave motion as explosions they can be identified 
by their depth as earthquakes. This method of discrimination becomes 
ineffective for events of low magnitude because the seismic signal 
becomes too small. 
The Soviets conduct a number of tests each year at known proving 
grounds, and these are the easiest of all to identify. The first Soviet 
underground test was detected in 1961 in an area some 40 nautical 
miles south of the normal atmospheric test area at Semipalatinsk. 
Prior to this event the area in question had not been recognized as 
a test site. After consideration of all the evidence, however, including 
the fact that the area in which the event occurred was not a seismic 
zone, was located close to a known test area, and contained sizable 
mountains suitable for underground testing ( the Degelen chain), 
the community concluded that this was indeed a probable underground 
test site. Since then, of course, the Soviets have conducted many un-
derground tests. The total detected from 1961 to 4 July 1969 now 
stands at 76. Most of these have been in the Degelen Mountains, 
but a number have been at other areas within the Semipalatinsk

Test Site. In general, a seismic event anywhere in the vicinity of 
Semipalatinsk is presumed to be a nuclear test unless shown other-
wise. The same is also true of Novaya Zemlya, where the Soviets are 
known to have conducted five underground nuclear tests, the first 
in 1964. Although the Soviets used Novaya Zemlya for atmospheric 
testing up to 1962, there was by no means unanimous agreement 
that they had opened an underground test site when the first two 
seismic events were detected there in the fall of 1964. The events 
were, of course, brought under intensive intelligence scrutiny because 
of the past history of Novaya Zemlya in atmospheric testing, the 
relative lack of seismic activity in the area, and the presence of 
sizable mountain peaks suitable for underground testing. The Soviets 
confirmed for us that this was a test area by detonating there in 
the fall of 1966 their largest nuclear test?about 1 megaton. A 
clandestine report was also received describing rock slides from 
this event and providing evidence of tunnelling by the Soviets 
for emplacing their nuclear devices. 
Probably the most interesting of the Soviet seismic events are 
the so-called "out-of-area" tests they have conducted in the past few 
years primarily for peaceful purposes. Here the assets of intelligence 
were brought fully to bear on identifying what were presumed from 
the start to have been probable explosions because of their oc-
currence in non-seismic areas of the Soviet Union distant from the 
normal test sites. All told there have been six such events since 
1965, one each near the towns of Ufa and Tyumen (slightly west 
and east of the Urals, respectively), two near Karshi (just north 
of the Afghanistan border), and two near Azgir at a site north 
of the Caspian Sea. In some cases it took months of analysis 
to establish that the events actually were nuclear explosions. 
Although they were for peaceful purposes, the Soviets maintained 
press silence about the events, making the job of tracking them 
down much more difficult. We were aided in the case of the first 
Karshi event in 1966 by Soviet articles about the great difficulties they 
had had in shutting off a wild gas well in the Urtabulak deposit, 
which was quite close to the location of this event. They had tried 
a number of different techniques to seal off the well, but all had 
failed, and it was at least conceivable that they might resort to 
a nuclear explosion to stop the runaway well. The matter was thrown 
into doubt when the Soviets listed this seismic event on their pub-
lished earthquake list, contrary to their previous practice. We finally

received good information indicating that this was indeed a Soviet 
nuclear explosion to put out a runaway gas well. Because of its 
proximity to this event, a seismic disturbance near Karshi in 1968 
was also considered to be probably an explosion to seal off a wild 
well. Other out-of-area events have generally been harder to pin down 
as to identity and purpose, but information from intelligence sources 
has provided a valuable supplement to that provided by the USAEDS 
seismic net. 
There remains the problem of the "unidentifieds," the much larger 
number of events that are detected, but for which there is no ready 
or probable explanation. Seismic means alone are unable to distinguish, 
for example, between chemical and nuclear explosions. The Joint 
Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee regularly examines small seis-
mic events that often later turn out to be Soviet high explosive 
detonations (sometimes with yields as high as several kilotons) for 
canal and dam construction. If the yields are large enough, tens of 
kilotons or more, there is no question of their nuclear nature, but 
at low or modest yields collateral evidence has to be brought to bear 
to sort out the wheat from the chaff. 
When all the foregoing techniques have been applied, the usual 
result is that there are perhaps 20-30 seismic events per month of 
magnitude 3.8 ( equivalent to a nuclear explosion yield of about 1 
kiloton if fully coupled in bard rock) or greater that are not iden-
tified. We usually can in time identify the largest events. Those that 
remain unidentified are for the most part rather small events. As 
a result of progressive improvements in seismic detection method, 
events of smaller and smaller magnitude are being detected. 
This raises another question: at what point on the scale do these 
small events become insignificant to us? If the Soviets are conducting 
a few tests annually in the fractional to low kiloton range without 
detection, is our knowledge of their nuclear progress, which has 
already been severely hampered by lack of debris from their under-
ground tests, seriously reduced? The answer to this question is of 
utmost importance in defining the seismic level below which under-
ground nuclear tests would not be allowed under a threshold test 
ban treaty. A decision about such a definition would also be affected 
by the possibility that underground shots could be "decoupled," that 
is, conducted in an underground cavity in such a way that the 
seismic signals from the explosion would be weakened by the time

AppwngtFifaeLeiw 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000??181M9008-4 
they reach the cavity wall. This would result in distant readings of 
seismic signals suggesting a substantially smaller shot than was ac-
tually fired. Indeed, such a decoupled shot might not be detected 
at all. Such a technique could permit the Soviets to experiment with 
larger yields, and therefore possibly make more progress in the de-
velopment of nuclear weapons, than they would legitimately be en-
titled to under a threshold test ban treaty. 
As matters stand at present, most of the unidentified events have 
occurred in seismically active areas of the USSR, i.e., areas in which 
earthquakes are relatively frequent. These events in seismic areas are 
therefore presumed to have been earthquakes. An attempt is made 
to develop collateral evidence that would indicate whether any of 
these were nuclear tests, but because of limitations on intelligence 
capabilities and resources, normally no firm conclusions about them 
are possible. As a result, it is possible that the Soviets have "gotten 
away with" some nuclear tests in seismic areas in recent years without 
our knowing about it. 
It is, however, fair to conclude that a combination of seismic record 
analysis and intelligence analysis has been reasonably successful in 
identifying seismic events occuring in the USSR, particularly those 
in seismic areas. For events in seismic areas our capabilities are 
less good when the yields are small, but fortunately, our concern 
about missing a limited number of small yield tests is least in this 
area. Any improvements in present intelligence capabilities to identify 
small events in seismic areas probably will be limited and costly 
to achieve.

More on the theory and 
practice of estimating. 
ON THE ACCURACY OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES 
Abbot E. Smith 
Whenever I talk about National Intelligence Estimates to an in-
telligence training course, or to any other group, someone always 
asks; How accurate have these estimates been; what is your score? 
The question is perfectly legitimate but my answer is usually vague 
and unconvincing. The purpose of this article is to try to explain 
why the answer is so unsatisfactory, and then to explore the problem 
further. 
It would seem reasonable to suppose that one could get a truly 
objective, statistical verdict on the accuracy of estimates. Go through 
the papers, tick off the right judgments and the wrong ones, and figure 
the batting average. I once thought that this could be done, and I 
tried it, and it proved to be impossible. The reasons are various. 
The Number of Estimates 
Since National Intelligence Estimates began to be produced by 
their present methods in late 1950, there have been some twelve or 
fifteen hundred of them. Each of these papers, however, contains 
a multitude of "estimates," that is, of statements setting forth an ex-
plicit or clearly implied judgment. Many of them also include one 
or more footnotes of dissent, conveying an opinion in conflict with 
the judgment in the text. I am sure that if one were to try and work 
out an accuracy score covering the product of nearly twenty years 
he would have to scan not less than 25,000 judgments, and prob-
ably far more. Even if one tested no more than ten or a dozen 
NIE's he would find several hundred statements to be checked. 
Most of these are restricted judgments, frequently appearing 
in subordinate clauses, and usually introduced because they con-
tribute background to a more contentious or consequential estimate. 
Most of them were probably not questioned or discussed. I would 
guess that the vast preponderance of them were quite correct. And 
if we assume for the moment that they could all be checked, and 
that 95 percent of them did in fact turn out to be right, I still doubt

that we would be justified in swelling with pride. Most of them 
were simply too easy. Although indubitably matters of judgment, they 
were not matters of difficult judgment. In short the batting average, 
if it were arrived at, would be worth about as much as the batting 
average of a major league team playing against a scrub outfit in 
a sandlot. This is why a complete, objective, and statistical tally 
would not be worth doing. 
To be sure, we must not presume that because an estimative judg-
ment appears in a subordinate clause it is necessarily inconsequential. 
Consider a sentence beginning: "Since the Soviet leaders will not 
in the near future cease to distrust the United States . . ." If this 
clause should prove wrong, not only would the rest of the sentence 
be unsound but the foundations of most estimates about Soviet 
policy would be undermined. Nevertheless, this is not a judgment 
which anyone would score high on a list of estimative triumphs. 
But suppose again ( as might well have happened) that sometime 
in 1958 or so a sentence had begun: "Since no change is to be 
expected in the Sino-Soviet relationship . . ." Such a clause would 
certainly in hindsight rank high on a list of egregious errors, yet 
it is not likely that in 1958 it would have been seriously questioned. 
Common sense tells us that a box score of estimates must be 
selective if it is to mean much; it must take account only of the 
important judgments. In saying this, however, we have left behind 
the wholly objective approach. Doubtless there are many estimates 
which everyone would agree to be important, but there are many 
others on which opinions would differ. The hard fact of life is that 
the high-level consumer of NIE's?the only person whose opinion 
really matters?is apt to judge the whole output on the basis of 
two or three estimates which strike home to him. If they prove 
correct, NIE's are good; if incorrect, they are bad.1 
Incidentally, from a strictly professional point of view the intelligence esti-
mator would often rank his successes and failures differently from the way the 
consumer would. For example, I know of several difficult estimates which proved 
wrong, and wrong because they showed a failure to grasp the nature of forces 
at work in a situation; these grieve me greatly, though so far as I am aware no 
high-level consumer ever noticed them. And there have been some which received 
high praise, but gave me little satisfaction; they were too easy, or they were merely 
lucky.

The Difficulty of Checking 
A great number of the judgments rendered in NIE's cannot be 
checked at all as to validity; the facts are not available. This is 
bound to be so; it is no reproach to intelligence collection or research. 
We estimate, for example, that political leader X is in serious trouble, 
but then it turns out that nothing much comes of it, and we may 
never know whether he really was in trouble, or, if he was, whether 
it was serious. Or we estimate that if the United States undertakes 
a given course of action the response of other countries will be 
such and such; but the United States never undertakes that action, 
and we never know whether we were right or wrong. There are 
of course a great number of "contingency" estimates, in sentences 
beginning: "If such and such happens, then so and so will probably 
follow." But the contingency never occurs, and the estimate can never 
be objectively checked. 
Often those judgments which can be checked have to be scored as 
partly right and partly wrong; we would view them as "right on the 
whole," or as "wrong by and large." Or again, suppose we have made 
an imprudently precise estimate, as that the Soviets will at a given 
time have 500 missiles of type X, and then they turn out to have 510. 
Conceivably this might be an important error; more likely it would be 
considered negligible. But how many more than 500 would they have 
to have before the estimate should forthrightly be deemed wrong? 
Estimative Formulations 
The drafters of estimates are deeply conscious of two obligations: 
to distinguish between statements of estimate and statements of fact, 
and to convey as clearly as possible the degree of confidence with 
which an estimate is delivered. On the second point Sherman Kent 
has written in this periodical. His injunctions may be simplified as 
follows: since the degree of confidence must usually be conveyed in 
words, these words should as far as possible be uniformly used and 
with full understanding of their meaning; for example: 
a. Something "is possible" or "may be" true. This constitutes no judgment 
of probability; it is in effect a statement merely that the thing under con-
sideration is not out of the question. But the fact that it is mentioned at all 
constitutes a judgment that it is something worth bearing in mind. 
b. Something is "probable" or "likely"; this means that there is about a 60 
or 65 percent probability of it's occurring or being true. 
Let us see how this affects the matter of scoring.

SECRET On Accuracy 
First, suppose that an NIE says that "it is possible" that such and 
such may occur, and then it occurs. We could score this as a correct 
estimate, which it was. But since a very large number of things are 
"possible," was it really the kind of judgment that deserves to register 
a plus for the perspicacity of the estimators? Perhaps it was, and 
perhaps it wasn't; that will depend on what we were talking about. 
Now suppose that the NIE says that something will "probably" 
occur, and it does not. The estimate was strictly not 100 percent 
wrong, for it only gave the event about a 60 percent chance of occur-
ring; perhaps it should be scored as 60 percent wrong. But pause a 
moment, and suppose that somehow we come to realize that there 
never had been any appreciable chance of the event occurring; then 
the estimate was really about 100 percent wrong. Or suppose that we 
come to know that there was indeed a 60 percent chance of its occur-
ring but that something happened?perhaps even an act of US 
policy taken as a consequence of the NIE?which prevented it from 
occurring; then the estimate was 100 percent right?or was it? 
It ought to be observed that while the subtleties of the preceding 
paragraph complicate the problem of making an objective and sta-
tistical study of the validity of NIE's they are of no consequence in real 
life. The high-level consumer pays little heed to qualifications. If he 
is interested in a judgment that something "probably" will happen, 
and if it turns out not to happen, he denounces the estimate as 100 
percent wrong, period. The saddest example of this was seen in the 
ill-starred estimate of 19 September 1962, issued as the Cuban missile 
crisis approached. That paper discussed at some length the possibility 
that the Soviets would put "offensive" surface-to-surface missiles in 
Cuba. Nowhere does the estimate declare even that the Soviets would 
"probably" not do so; the presentation was obviously labored, difficult, 
and inconclusive. Yet the late Senator Robert Kennedy, after the dust 
had cleared away, wrote as follows in his book, Thirteen Days: 
"No one had expected or anticipated that the Russians would deploy surface-
to-surface ballistic missiles in Cuba. 
"No official within the government had ever suggested to President Kennedy 
that the Russian build-up in Cuba would include strategic missiles. . . 
"The last estimate before our meeting of the 16th of October was dated 
the 19th of September, and it advised the President that without reservation 
the U.S. Intelligence Board, after consideration and examination, had con-
cluded that the Soviet Union would not make Cuba a strategic base. . ." 
This brings me to the next point.

On Accuracy 
The Discrete Statement and the Context 
Neither Senator Kennedy nor the many others who condemned 
that NIE on Soviet missiles in Cuba were altogether wrong in doing 
so. The text of that paper was labored and inexplicit. I think that a 
reader might well have understood that it showed the intelligence 
community to be beset by the gravest doubts and concerns. Never-
theless it conveyed an unmistakeable impression that the Soviets 
would probably not do what they did. One may well say that in draft-
ing those passages we ought to have followed Sherman Kent's edicts 
and come out with a clear-cut statement that the act was improbable; 
as it turned out we might as well have been killed for a sheep as a 
lamb. But it was the weight and impact of the context that carried 
the judgment, rather than any explicit statement. What the estimators 
probably wanted to convey was something like this: "We really think 
it unlikely that the Soviets will do this thing, because it would be out 
of accord with their conduct of affairs in the past, and probably turn 
out to be disastrous for them; nevertheless, with the evidence as it is, 
and bearing in mind the gravity of the matter, we think that the risk 
of their doing it is so great that the US Government should provide 
for the contingency that it may happen." My concern at the moment 
is with the question: Supposing that the estimate had in fact said 
these words or their equivalent, how would its validity have been 
objectively scored? Still, I suppose, as wrong. 
Most NIE's are not so dramatic in their implications, yet a great 
many convey their message by the context, or rather by the total text. 
They are something more than collections of discrete statements. 
Many address questions such as these: what is the situation and what 
the prospects in country X; what is the trend of Soviet military policy; 
what is the nature and dimension of revolutionary potential in Latin 
America; and so on. The validity of such papers depends only partly 
upon the accuracy of each particular statement in them. It must also 
be judged by the impact and tone of the document as a whole--the 
choice of facts which are cited, the distribution of emphasis, the 
cogency of argument, even the literary quality. I think that such a 
paper could be basically correct even though it had a great many 
statements which proved incorrect, and basically wrong even though 
many statements were accurate. 
Sophisticated estimating indeed ought almost always to be some-
thing more than bald prediction. The course of events is seldom

SECRET On Accuracy 
inevitable or foreordained, even though hindsight often makes it look 
that way. A good paper on a complicated subject should describe the 
trends and forces at work, identify the contingent factors or variables 
which might affect developments, and present a few alternative pos-
sibilities for the future, usually with some judgment as to the relative 
likelihood of one or another outcome. Occasionally such a paper can 
afterwards be deemed precisely "accurate"; more often it will be 
difficult to arrive at a verdict in any fashion which can in the strictest 
sense be called objective. It may be a very long time indeed before 
we "know" the causes and background of great events. We still get 
a new analysis, every year or so, of the forces that led to the American 
Revolution; how soon shall we arrive at objective truth about the 
forces currently at work in Southeast Asia? 
What it comes to is this: a complete, objective, statistical audit of 
the validity of NIE's is impossible, and even if it were possible it 
would provide no just verdict on how "good" these papers have been. 
Like the Bible, the corpus of estimates is voluminous and uneven in 
quality, and almost any proposition can be defended by citations from 
it. Obviously, if we are to make estimates at all we shall sometimes 
make wrong ones. An assiduous and hostile critic could certainly make 
up an extensive list of errors, some of which would be grievous. And 
a friendly compiler could counter with a massive collection of correct 
judgments. I usually say to the training course that, being knowledge-
able about the contents of NIE's, I believe that on the whole they have 
been "good." But it may well be thought that mine is a biased verdict, 
and moreover that since I am a maker and not a consumer of esti-
mates my opinion does not matter anyway. 
Seldom if ever does a consumer of consequence pronounce on the 
virtue of NIE's as a whole, though comments on particular papers or 
particular judgments have been frequent. The more emphatic of these 
comments are almost always adverse, since attention seems more 
likely to be gripped by an important estimate that has gone sour 
than by one that has turned out right. This is natural enough; it 
distresses but does not astonish the estimator. Once in a while, how-
ever, the temptation to some sort of rejoinder is almost irresistible, 
and in the following section I indulge myself. 
On 1 August 1969, Senator Thomas J. Dodd delivered a speech in 
the Senate during the debate on the Safeguard program. A part of this 
Appraed For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A00031E0tRIM08-4 
AprEfAv5Wctpaplease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A0OIStaalr0008-4 
speech was devoted to the achievements, or non-achievements, of US 
intelligence, and the theme was essentially in the following sentence: 
The American intelligence community, although it has performed well in 
certain situations, has not been impressive when estimating the intentions and 
plans of our adversaries. 
The Senator went on to support this contention by a list of specifics, 
beginning with the failure to warn of the North Korean Communist 
attack on South Korea, the subsequent intervention of the Chinese 
Communists, and the earlier Soviet initial explosion of the A-bomb. 
Leaving these aside ( because they occurred prior to the existence of 
the present machinery for coordinating National Intelligence Esti-
mates) let us examine some of the others. 
a. The intelligence community "failed to predict . . . accurately 
the Soviet H-bomb." 
Our performance in this respect represents in fact one of those 
many instances where we were either good or bad, depending 
on the way one looks at it. We did fail to predict it "accurately." 
Yet an estimate in March 1953 said that field testing of a 
thermonuclear device was possible by mid-1955, and further 
that it would be unsafe to assume that the Soviets would not 
have a workable thermonuclear weapon by mid-1955. On 18 
August 1953, another NIE said that field testing might occur 
at any time. Soon afterward it was confirmed by analysis that 
the first test had in fact taken place on 12 August. 
b. "In 1956 [the intelligence community] failed to alert us to the 
Soviet invasion of Hungary . . . And, despite warning signs 
which many of our lay experts took seriously [it] was also dis-
posed to discount the possibility that the Red Army would invade 
Czechoslovakia to depose the Dubcek regime." 
It is true that neither the invasion of Hungary in 1956 nor that 
of Czechoslovakia in 1968 were forecast in National Intelli-
gence Estimates, which represent the consensus of the intelli-
gence community; in fact no such coordinated papers were 
prepared on these situations in the months immediately pre-
ceding the invasions. In both cases, however, and especially 
that of Czechoslovakia, various estimative memoranda and 
current intelligence publications reported the state of high ten-
sion and the Soviet military build-up. Without saying that 
invasions were likely, these papers emphasized that they were

un Accuracy 
possible, and were surely under consideration by the Soviet 
leadership. The US Government was made aware that the 
invasions might occur, though it was not assured that they 
would occur. 
C. "In the period immediately before the Cuban missile crisis, 
the advance consensus of the intelligence professionals was that 
the Soviets would not tempt the fates by deploying nuclear mis-
siles in Cuba." 
I have discussed this above, concluding that despite various 
qualifications that might be made, the Senator's verdict is 
essentially correct. With respect to the performance of the in-
telligence community, however, an additional quotation from 
Senator Kennedy's book is appropriate: "The important fact, 
of course, is that the missiles were uncovered and the informa-
tion was made available to the government and the people 
before missiles became operative and in time for the US to act." 
d. "In 1957, the intelligence community was completely without 
advance information on the Soviet Sputnik." 
Strictly construed, the Senator's words seem to condemn the re-
sults of collection rather than of estimates, and in this sense 
they may be correct. Nevertheless, in December 1955 an NIE 
said that the Soviets could put an earth satellite into orbit by 
1958, and in March 1957 another NIE estimated that they could 
do so by the end of the year. They did, in October. We have 
always considered this a praise-worthy example of good esti-
mating on the basis of very scanty informatoin. 
e. "[After 19571 our intelligence community lapsed into one of its 
very rare periods of overstatement when it advised the Eisenhower 
administration that there was a massive missile gap between the 
Soviet Union and ourselves. Today it has been documented that 
the so-called missile gap was a Soviet-engineered hoax, and that 
our intelligence community fell for phony information put out by 
Khrushchev for the purpose of intimidating us." 
We certainly overestimated the number of Soviet ICBM's which 
would be operational around 1961. But we certainly did not 
fall for a phony plant by Khrushchev. There was virtually no 
hard information available, beyond the fact that the Soviets

had successfully tested an ICBM in 1957. The principal basis 
for the overestimate was probably the opinion of the best US 
missile experts in those early days as to the number of ICBM's 
that could be manufactured in a given period of time, granting 
a previous successful test. Nevertheless, the estimates were 
wrong. 
f. "In more recent years, conversely, . . . estimates of Soviet in-
tentions regarding the size of Soviet ICBM forces have turned 
out to be woefully conservative." 
A just criticism, despite a few defenses that could be put up. 
These exhaust the Senator's list of specifics. Consider now some 
further general observations which he made: the following quotation 
combines three passages which were separate in his speech: 
"When it comes to estimates of Soviet intentions, however, there is admittedly 
a lot of guesswork involved. . . I think it pertinent to point out in this con-
nection that our intelligence community has erred far more frequently on the 
conservative side than otherwise in their estimates of Soviet capabilities and 
intentions. . . over and over again, the Soviet performance in the field of 
armaments has either surprised us completely or substantially surpassed our 
estimates." 
As I have tried to show in preceding parts of this article, it would 
be idle to attempt to prove or disprove these statements by objective 
and statistical analysis. With respect to numbers of Soviet weapons, 
one could easily make up a list of projections which were too low, 
another of those which were too high, another of those which were 
substantially correct, and a final one?very short?of those which, 
thanks more to luck than wisdom, were precisely correct. The projec-
tion of numbers, however, is the most precarious of all estimative 
exercises; there is indeed "a lot of guesswork involved," especially as 
one looks beyond the two or three years subsequent to the date when 
the estimate is written. 
Suppose we try one test, however, using the somewhat non-objective 
criterion of "importance." Probably all would agree that it is im-
portant to forecast with reasonable accuracy the appearance of new 
Soviet weapons systems, and to do so well ahead of their initial opera-
tional dates. Probably most would agree further that the weapons 
systems mentioned in the following list were the most important to

forecast, though others might certainly be added. Here is the record 
of NIE's in this matter: 
a. In 1950 (the first year of National Intelligence Estimates in present 
form), jet medium bombers were forecast for the Soviet forces in 1952; they 
appeared in 1954. 
b. In 1951, thanks to the appearance of a single aircraft identified as a 
heavy bomber ( the so-called Type 31, never thereafter seen) heavy bombers 
were thenceforth estimated to be brought into Soviet forces; they were in 
1954. 
c. In October 1953, an NIE said that a Soviet surface-to-air missile of 
native design could be developed by 1955; the first SA-1 missiles (based 
on a German design) became operational around Moscow in 1953; all sites 
were operational by 1956. The first SA-2 battalion became operational in 
1958 or early 1959. 
d. In October 1954, an NIE said that the Soviets could have an ICBM 
ready for series production about 1963, or at the earliest possible date in 
1960; the SS-6 became operational in 1960. 
e. In 1957, an NIE said that the Soviets could not have an ABM by 1962. 
In 1959 the estimate was that the Soviets were pushing hard on the prob-
lem and could have a first operational capability with an ABM in the period 
1963-1966; the Moscow ABM system began to be operational in 1968. 
f. In 1965, an NIE said that the Soviets would probably produce a new 
class of ballistic missile submarine, that it would almost certainly be nuclear 
powered, and that it would carry perhaps 6-12 missiles of an improved type. 
That NIE also judged that a new missile with about 1,000 n.m. range would 
come into service in 1967-1968. These estimates were made purely on the 
basis of Soviet requirements; there was no hard evidence of such develop-
ments at the time. In 1966 we saw the first unit of the new Y-class submarine 
having 16 launch tubes, and the Soviets began testing a new missile with 
an estimated range of 1,300 n.m.; this system?submarine and missile?be-
came operational in 1968. 
g. In 1965, an NIE said that the Soviets could probably attain an opera-

I think it true to say that in the past fifteen or twenty years no im-

heralded in advance in National Intelligence Estimates. The initial 
operational dates have often been wrong, but as the above citations 
indicate they have usually been wrong because they have set the date 
too early; they have not "erred far more frequently on the conserva-
tive side than otherwise."

To attack Senator Dodd's contentions is not to prove anything con-
clusively about the validity of National Intelligence Estimates as a 
whole. There are a good many people within the intelligence com-
munity ( and probably outside as well) who feel that the net impact 
of NIE's over the years has been to over- rather than under-estimate 
Soviet military capabilities and intentions. If one of these persons were 
to draw up a documented indictment, it could probably be countered 
in the same fashion that I have tried to counter Senator Dodd's 
charges; and still nothing would be finally demonstrated. The esti-
mator himself finds it useful to look into his record, not merely for 
the satisfaction or chagrin he may derive from the exercise, but because 
it may help him improve his performance in time to come. But the 
man whose opinion counts most?the "high-level policy-maker"?
will never get his evaluation of NIE's from an exhaustive study of 
them. He will have no more than a vague impression?an impression, 
however, which will suddenly and emphatically crystallize whenever 
an estimate crucial to his immediate concern proves wrong. Once his 
view is thus formed it may take a long time to change.

NON-ELECTRONIC AGENT COMMUNICATIONS 
Gabriel M. D'Echauffour 
Consider the following situations, all of which are possible. As a 
matter of fact, all of them have actually occurred in the not too distant 
past, and all may occur again at rather surprising places and times: 
Situation: Outbreak of hostilities, closing of stations, evacuation of 
station personnel, loss of contact with station assets. 
Situation: Defector walks into station and requests asylum. Defector 
agrees to return home for a specified sum of money. He ap-
pears legitimate and valuable, but his value would be 
greater if he were in place. 
Situation: Agent is recruited in country X, is transiting country Y on 
the way home to the denied area. Station Y directed to meet 
agent, provide certain clandestine training, and send agent 
on his way. 
Situation: Agent working for us in friendly area, in rather relaxed en-
vironment which permits face-to-face meetings with the 
case officer. One day the agent finds that he is being trans-
ferred to a hostile area where face-to-face meetings will no 
longer be possible. 
Situation: Station recruits agent who is member of the local Com-
munist party. Agent's position precludes contact locally 
without jeopardizing agent's position. 
Situation: Local asset has friend or relative in denied area who he 
feels is amenable to recruitment. Asset sent as legal traveler 
into area to attempt recruitment. 
Situation: Agent traveling for short vacation trip into a denied target 
area. 
Situation: Station asset, member of local Communist labor union, going 
to Bloc country to attend Communist-sponsored labor 
conference.

SECRET Secret Writing 
The above situations all have one thing in common: a means of 
agent communications is needed. Secure communication is a vital fac-
tor in any clandestine operation, whether it be face-to-face or other-
wise. 
In the above situations, one solution is to have recourse to non-
electronic agent communications techniques, also called chemical com-
munications, or in the slang of technical tradecraft, secret writing (SW). 
The purpose of this article is to describe briefly the various methods 
available and to outline considerations affecting their application. Our 
object is to provide some guidance to those who may at some time be 
confronted with the subject of SW, whether it be from a positive 
collection viewpoint, counterintelligence, or in some other connection. 
Note-Taking Devices 
The first type of SW device we will consider?note-taking employ-
ing direct writing implements?has restricted, but very useful appli-
cation. Such implements consist generally of a chemical substance in 
the form of a piece of ordinary pencil lead, or other various camou-
flaged hardware items containing secret ink, which may be used to 
apply secret writing directly to paper materials. Since the devices are 
used to write directly on paper, there is inevitably some disturbance of 
the fibers of the paper. In some countries methods are known for de-
tecting such disturbances, and therefore direct writing is normally not 
employed for correspondence transiting international borders through 
mail channels in which effective chemical censorship may be encoun-
tered. 
Even with this restriction, however, the direct writing technique 
has many uses. It may be used for dead-dropped notes, or for notes 
to be carried by case officers traveling internationally or in a difficult 
operational area. This method has been used very successfully by 
agents and cut-outs, who may carry the writing on newspapers, 
magazines, and the like through border points, thus avoiding routine 
chemical censorship, for passage to the case officer in the form of a 
direct report, or in the form of debriefing notes containing data 
which one would not trust to memory. The devices have been used 
successfully by ships' crewmen, train conductors, aircrew members, 
and legal travelers. Use of these devices might be considered in 
preparing correspondence to be left in dead-drops as a precaution 
against accidental discovery, perhaps by a child at play, or by the 
AppPaved For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A006N110008-4 
Apprveff.lepirNsase 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A0003sTegy08-4 
passer-by who kicks over a can and finds the drop. The technique may 
perhaps also be considered for use by agents or case officers carrying 
written material to forestall the possibility that severe illness, acci-
dental death, or some other untoward event might bring incriminating 
written materials in their possession to the attention of local authori-
ties. In rare cases, the devices have been used within internal mail 
channels where the chemical censorship is generally less effective 
than in international mail channels, but in general this is not advisable. 
The time required for training in the use of these devices usually is 
from one to two hours, but as with other techniques the time varies 
in direct proportion to the abilities of the agent. 
Microdots 
A more intricate method of SW, and one of the most fascinating to 
amateurs as well as to students of tradecraft, is the microdot, a photo-
graphic reproduction of textual material reduced to one by two milli-
meters or less. This method is well-known to most of the sophisticated 
intelligence services and continues to be widely and securely used. 
Although microdots can be used both as an agent sending and a 
receiving technique, they are primarily used in the latter application 
due to the complexity of preparation. 
In general, it takes almost the same time to train an agent to 
receive microdots as it does to instruct him in the use of direct writ-
ing devices, but about two to four hours should be allowed. In ad-
dition, the media selected for carrying dots should be appropriate, 
such as an envelope, a postcard, or some other plausible object. Most 
important, however, the agent needs either natural access to a micro-
scope of approximately 100 power magnification or must be furnished 
a microscope or other readout device. Scientists and doctors can easily 
receive mocrodots since they usually have a microscrope and are well 
versed in its use. Possession of such equipment is not so unusual, 
however, that other individuals cannot plausibly have it. 
The security of microdots obviously lies in the difficulty of de-
tecting them. ( Try spreading an ounce of black pepper on the floor 
and finding a dot mixed into it.) This is not to imply, however, that 
a microdot in a postcard or letter could not be found if the censors 
were sufficiently interested in the particular item suspected of con-
taining one. This consideration is discussed at greater length below.

Approved For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010008-4 
SECRET Secret Writing 
It is also practical to have agents "send" microdots. The difficulties 
involved, however, are somewhat greater than in receiving, as the 
agent must have some photographic dexterity, photographic equip-
ment, either normal or specially provided equipment, and some 
degree of privacy. In addition, considerably more training time is 
required. The Soviets frequently train their staff agents to send as 
well as receive microdots, but after they are in place they usually 
only receive. In the nature of the technique, microdots are not 
generally appropriate for mass transmission of intelligence informa-
tion. Individual burying of each dot is required, and their use in 
quantity would tax the agent's eyes as well as his nerves. 
For ease of readout, a dot usually contains several hundred words or 
less. Usually only one or two dots are sent at a time. As indicated 
above, they are not pasted on the surface of the carrier but imbedded 
within it to reduce the possibility of detection and avoid risk of de-
tachment in the course of normal handling. 
Examination for the presence of microdots generally consists of 
holding the suspect item in front of a strong light to look for small 
dark objects buried within it. Since well-hidden dots cannot be 
detected in this way, other tests may often be necessary. 
Latent Image 
Another photographic technique employed in clandestine commu-
nications uses a latent (invisible) photographic image, e.g., of a 
secret message or picture, which is processed into a photographic 
print such as a snapshot and rendered insensitive to light, but remains 
recoverable by the agent by means of a photographic chemical 
process. The process is well known to photographers and has been 
described in open literature. Its security lies in careful calculation 
of where and how it is to be used. It may be employed in agent 
sending or receiving channels, but like the microdot, is more readily 
used for the latter. Any agent who can normally receive photographs 
in mail could be considered for this technique. 
Liquid Ink Secret Writing 
Historically, invisible inks have been used in secret writing since 
antiquity. References to this can be found in ancient Greek and Roman 
literature as far back as 230 B.C. The principle is relatively simple: 
a chemical is dissolved into a quantity of solvent, usually water, to 
Applaved For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A00813088T0008-4 
Apprgogi,Fffrgaease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000neM008-4 
provide a colorless, or nearly colorless, liquid ink which is used to 
write invisible messages with a stick or quill pen. Development is 
usually by application of a different chemical which reacts with ?the 
dried ink to produce a visible color which may then be read. There 
are, of course, many different chemical combinations which behave 
in this manner. Liquid secret writing is primarily restricted to agent 
receiving, and the preparation of messages is by the technical staff. 
One consideration in the choice of which of the many liquid SW 
systems to use is the relative ease of recovery of the message by 
the agent. The ease of recovery of the systems that may be selected 
will vary considerably, and the choice will depend in part upon 
how much privacy the agent has. 
Carbon Writing 
Although liquid inks still find operational application, they have 
in recent years given way to carbon writing techniques. Apart from 
the gains in chemical security which many, but not all, carbon systems 
offer over liquid inks, there is a substantial gain in simplicity since 
it is inherently easier for an agent to use a carbon. Liquid writing 
is much more time-consuming in all respects, particularly in training 
time and in the preparation of messages. With liquid secret inks, 
it becomes difficult to maintain continuity in writing the message as 
the ink dries, and what has previously been written disappears. 
An SW carbon is essentially a piece of paper of normal appearance 
which has been impregnated with small quantities of secret writing 
chemical. When used in a manner similar to a black office carbon, 
small quantities of the SW chemical transfer to another sheet, form-
ing a secret message. The many carbon systems differ chemically. 
Messages prepared from some are easily developed, while others 
require complicated and time-consuming treatment. For some, indeed, 
a laboratory is needed. Each SW carbon may normally be used for 
as many as fifty messages, and may be mounted in a pad of ordinary 
writing paper for concealment. Training time required for carbon 
writing is normally four to six hours. 
The carbon technique is normally used by the agent to write to 
his case officer, and most of the sophisticated intelligence services 
have a good many systems of the kind. In this field, as in others 
in the SW business, there is stiff competition to produce ever new 
systems defying detection by hostile services. This involves a con-

SECRET Secret Writing 
tinning quest for new and more secure chemical combinations as 
older methods become compromised. The object, of course, is to 
stay ahead of the research of the opposition, and to outwit its 
chemical censors. 
Agent Training 
As we have noted, the training time required for introduction of 
SW techniques varies, depending on the aptitude of the agent, and 
the nature of the techniques he is being taught. In many operations, 
the time available for training is limited. It will be evident, however, 
that training should not be slighted. Obviously, SW ought to be 
taught to an agent in advance of his actual need to use it in an 
operational situation. Time should be allowed not only for practice, 
but for corrective re-training or instruction in an entirely new tech-
nique. Most SW methods appear relatively simple, but lacking 
adequate training, the agent may make mistakes resulting in illegible 
development of the SW, or at worst jeopardizing his personal security, 
that of the SW system, and of the operation as a whole. 
Since agent communications are a critical link in most operations, 
pre-planning and introduction of techniques?including training and 
establishing of practice channels?are certainly in order. It is rec-
ommended that an SW specialist be consulted at an early stage 
in the planning and that the training be conducted by the specialist. 
Prior planning in most cases will offer the opportunity for tailoring 
the SW techniques to the case situation. Adequate training can help 
avoid events such as the recent one in which the agent mistook 
blank paper for his carbons and wrote twelve blank SW "messages" 
over a year's time. Needless to say, this proceeding generated much 
concern among his correspondents not to speak of the paper work. 
Censorship and Operational Security 
No discussion of SW would be complete without a consideration 
of the security environment in which it is to be employed. In the 
most general sense, this involves the matter of censorship. By defini-
tion, censorship means to withhold information or materials, which 
are judged to be morally, politically, or otherwise inappropriate 
or undesirable. With respect to programs designed to uncover secret 
writing channels, one should use the term technical ( or chemical) 
censorship, or even more appropriately "interception for technical 
Appraed For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000??56g008-4 
ApprfiofiltWrigglease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000gpectiq008-4 
examination," since the process usually involves extraction of the sus-
pect item for physical examination, and its re-introduction into the 
normal channel. 
A large number of countries exercise censorship in varying degrees 
in an effort to control the flow of written information, to provide in-
telligence leads, or in some areas, to control anti-regime activities 
and the criminal element. To these ends some of these countries, 
but not all, have developed technical facilities of varying effectiveness 
for searching out and resolving secret writing. Most technically ad-
vanced countries have some capability in these respects. 
Thus, the use of SW in an operation is predicated on one or all 
of the following: a) to make the transmittal of information secure 
against accidental discovery because of misrouting or accidental loss 
by the carrier of the message; b) to protect intelligence against 
discovery during mass, random, or selective opening of mail by 
authorities or others who are only concerned with reading the 'visible 
text; or c) to maintain security against efforts directed at uncovering 
secret writing. 
The security of an SW operation depends upon a number of factors: 
a) the proper use of the SW materials which is related to training 
time and quality; b) the technical ( or chemical) security of the 
secret writing method employed; which is in turn related to c) 
the technical capability of the opposition in the areas where the SW 
is being employed. A method providing total security in Borneo 
may not be secure in Russia. Equally important for security are the 
non-technical operational circumstances, such as the agent's physical 
security, how he posts his SW, and the consistency with which all 
other non-SW security practices are observed to avoid attracting at-
tention to the operation, and to avoid stimulating a specific exami-
nation of the agent's mail, even though such examination should prove 
fruitless. 
In planning an SW operation, all these angles must be considered. 
Generally, under-developed countries do not have a capability for 
detecting SW, although they may be opening mail. Also, a liaison 
service from a technically sophisticated country will not generally 
provide a "friendly" country with its most effective methods for 
detecting secret writing, because defensive chemical techniques are 
inherently related directly to knowledge of offensive techniques. Thus,

ECKET Secret Writing 
the service that detects and analyzes a system will logically incorporate 
it into its battery of counterintelligence techniques. 
Upon occasion, when routine mass opening of mail is taking place, 
the examiners may be told to look for evidence of SW, such as writ-
ing impressions, or for letters which make no sense or appear other-
wise suspicious. Letters selected may then be passed to a technical 
laboratory for chemical examination. Success will then depend upon 
the relative security of the SW method employed and the capabili-
ties of the laboratory. Some countries, such as China, for example, 
with its large manpower reserve, can afford to open and scan large 
quantities of mail. None, however, can afford the manpower to look 
for technically sophisticated secret writing on more than a fraction 
of a percent of the total volume. 
The risks in using SW can thus be minimized if the choice of 
technique is properly made. The selection of a secret writing system 
for a particular case depends upon the reliability of the agent, his 
area of operation, the training time available, the privacy of the 
agent, and the channels involved. 
As noted above, the chemical security of SW systems and tech-
niques varies. Obviously the most secure and complicated system 
cannot be given to every case, nor is it needed in every case. To 
do so would insure that it would be quickly picked up in any 
double-agent operations, or by other means, and would become 
known to the opposition. The loss of a particular SW system in 
one application, however, does not necessarily mean that it cannot 
continue to be used in some other area. Indeed, depending on the 
circumstances, it may even continue to be used in the same area. 
Operational Considerations 
SW should not normally be used except when an agent must have 
clandestine means to communicate or when caution dictates provision 
for contingencies. On the other hand, there have been instances where 
SW was introduced to an agent merely to improve his reporting by 
forcing him to be more concise. There have also been instances in 
which SW was introduced to impress the agent with the profes-
sionalism of the organization. The writer handled a case in which 
the agent was introduced to SW purely as a means of shocking him 
into the realization that he was indeed involved in clandestine ac-
tivities. This helped induce him to take more seriously other opera-
Appriked For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000-M8kb008-4 
Apprf4981tFoorr1Dlease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000nelin008-4 
tional matters, such as surveillance and solicitation of information. 
The Soviets apparently prepare their staff agents in SW communica-
tions as a matter of routine. SW does make demands on the time 
of the case officer and agent and in some instances, introduces some 
added risks to the operation. These can and should be minimized, 
however, by careful training, planning, and selection of techniques 
to be used. 
The main questions to be answered when planning and selecting 
SW systems can now be summarized. What countries of operation 
are involved, that is, what are the SW channels? What is known 
about the censorship and SW capabilities of the countries involved? 
What is known about the importance of the agent in terms of access? 
How reliable is the agent? Where will the SW message from and 
to the agent be processed, and by whom? How much privacy will 
the agent have? What is his profession? Who will train him? What 
can he legitimately or plausibly have in his possession? What can 
he carry across the border? In his position, would it appear logical 
for him to send and receive mail? Is an accommodation address 
available for the agent to write to? What languages will be used? 
Normally the agent who writes SW messages should not reveal 
his true identity in the visible part of the letter. In some cases 
where the text of the secret writing may pinpoint the agent and 
where it is feared local censorship can detect and develop SW, 
it may be desirable to encypher the SW text. Generally, however, 
the large volumes of mail being sent offers such a formidable task 
to censors that only select suspect letters can be given thorough exami-
nation. Thus, the sheer volume of mail provides a great deal of 
safety, and if proper attention is given to other security considerations 
the agent's mail normally will never be suspected of carrying secret 
messages. In areas where more stringent technical censorship is 
expected, more secure techniques would need to be considered. 
Accommodation addresses, which serve as the receiving point for 
the agent's SW to his case officer, must be carefully chosen and 
should as far as possible appear to be legitimate normal mail 
channels. Generally, a letter to a country considered neutral or 
friendly from the viewpoint of the country of origin is less suspect 
than one to an unfriendly area. SW to the agent may directly iden-
tify him if intercepted and developed or otherwise detected. There-
fore, it is advisable to minimize the volume of SW messages sent

to the agent, and desirable when possible to mail SW to the agent 
internally in the country, thus circumventing international censorship. 
It may be desirable where possible to have the agent write with SW, 
but receive by encyphered radio broadcasts, with SW receiving only 
as an emergency back-up technique. 
Contingency Planning 
Past experience has proven the value of establishing SW "stay 
behind" capabilities in areas where direct contact with the agent may 
be lost. This situation has arisen many times in the past. Equally 
important is provision for the possibility that an agent may sud-
denly be transferred to an area where personal contact is precluded. 
This also happens frequently. In many such instances, adequate 
preparation for the use of SW may not be possible, especially 
preparation through practice. Therefore, whenever SW may be a 
possibility, steps should be taken to have the agent trained at the 
earliest opportunity. 
The writer has encountered a number of cases where SW was not 
given to an agent because it was thought that the agent would 
continue to be able to "travel out" frequently for personal meetings, 
or that the agent was only going away for a "short period of time" 
or that the agent's "present access doesn't warrant SW reporting." 
Subsequently it developed that the agent could no longer travel 
out, or found himself cut off for several years from personal con-
tact, or his access suddenly became valuable. Sometimes the con-
sequences of such changes may subsequently be corrected by train-
ing the agent through a third party or by having written instructions 
dead-dropped to him. These are inevitably poor substitutes for pre-
planning. Case officers often tend to regard techniques such as carbon 
writing as too simple to warrant the expenditure of time for training 
and practice sessions. There are, however, many case officers who 
have lived to rue this oversight, having experienced the frustration of 
agents who cleverly have made technical innovations on their own 
or, more commonly, have failed to remember technique, such as the 
agent who wrote his message with his carbon and mailed the carbon 
to his case officer. There have been successful SW cases after an 
absolute minimum of training, or even training by written instruction, 
but these are exceptional. In SW it is best to play it safe.

In the dynamic scene of clandestine operations, technical tradecraft 
in general will continue to expand and develop. Certainly secret 
writing continues to evolve and to play its role in operational ac-
tivities, growing ever more complex, or as simple, as the situation 
demands. The purpose of this article has been to enlighten and to 
establish guidelines and a philosophy for non-technical personnel 
who may be confronted at some time with situations?such as were 
sketched at the outset of this paper?in which SW is the best 
available solution.

Some guidelines for 
secret agents. 
DEFENSE AGAINST COMMUNIST 
INTERROGATION ORGANIZATIONS 
Michael L. Mineur 
The suggestions offered herein for practical defense against Com-
munist interrogation organizations are designed to be used very selec-
tively and with caution in the briefing of anti-Communist secret 
agents running the danger of Communist imprisonment'. Because some 
of the tactics outlined could be of use to other categories of persons, 
such as prisoners of war, political prisoners, and noncombatants, this 
study is offered with the reservation that it is not to be construed 
either as a modification of official US Government doctrine or an 
exhaustive treatment of the Communist system of prisoner manage-
ment and exploitation. 
The Importance and Techniques of Preparation 
Most of the available guidance on this subject is too much con-
cerned with the tactics of the conflict between the prisoner and 
his interrogator after arrest, and not enough with the preparations 
that the endangered agent can and should make in advance. His 
preparations are very often decisive in determining the outcome of his 
resistance effort. The agent must be prepared physically, organiza-
tionally, and mentally. 
Among the most important physical preparations is to separate one-
self as far as possible from incriminating materials such as commo 
plans, one-time pads, radios, secret inks, weapons, special cameras, 
documents, and money in bulk. Linkage to incriminating persons must 
be adequately covered, and all the standard procedures of operational 
security and conspiratorial discipline must be understood and main-
tained. Plans for emergencies must be worked out in advance and 
rehearsed. These plans should be set up for use under unfavorable 
conditions, when one is under surveillance or suspicion. 
Organizationally speaking, the agent should have made all possible 
arrangements for the support and safety, rescue or warning of his 
Briefers should bear in mind that some agents, getting the full briefing, might 
decamp rather than take the risks.

family and others dependent upon him. He should have set up some 
system whereby his sponsors will learn of his arrest?if it occurs?
at an early date, so that they can begin to help him. He should have 
arranged a simple code for concealing information in any letters or 
messages he might be able to send to his family, if the family is 
witting of his secret activities or affiliations. 
This is a grim subject, and part of the mental preparation?a most 
important part?consists in accepting and living with these possibili-
ties. An agent conditioned to face them honestly is likely to be far 
more capable and careful than the chance-taker who hopes somehow 
to get by without self-discipline and without the intensive prepara-
tion that is the only way to success in any clandestine operation. 
The agent should have studied the security service and interroga-
tion systems operating in his area and should have prepared himself 
against surprise. The agent must prepare and thoroughly rehearse 
his cover story and his fall-back cover story for his status, action, and 
associations, and backstop them as far as possible. He will usually be 
able to get help with this work from his sponsors. There is an inward, 
or psychological aspect of imprisonment for which the prisoner must 
be fortified. Prisoners with a high ideological motivation are able to 
defend themselves and to continue to struggle against the opposition 
longer than others, even under conditions of extreme hardship. Per-
sons who have strong religious beliefs are able to resist much more 
effectively than those with a weak faith or none. A person under-
taking the dangerous work of the secret agent should in any case 
develop an ideological basis. If not religiously inclined, he should 
review in his mind the great cause of human freedom and the 
price that others have willingly paid to defend and advance it. 
Patriotism, the welfare of families and friends, and concern for his 
own future self-respect, all help to reinforce the will to resist. Very 
few persons are aware of how much hidden strength they actually 
have. The medical profession, which has the opportunity to observe 
persons fighting for their lives?often against incurable ailments?
can testify to the fact that, when a person makes up his mind to 
resist, he can accomplish miracles. 
The Arrest 
It is, of course, essential that the agent, as a standard procedure, 
maintain a level of preparation for ?arrest. However, since he has 
to take chances in order to accomplish anything, it becomes important

to know something of the signs of impending arrest. History is replete 
with accounts of agents arrested with incriminating evidence in their 
possession long after they themselves had good reason to expect arrest. 
Any change, however subtle, in the attitude of persons with whom 
one is in everyday contact must be fully reviewed as to possible causes. 
From the point of view of preparation, the agent should carefully 
study people with whom he has casual contact, such as an apartment 
house janitor, a storekeeper, a barber, for example. In a totalitarian 
country, people of this sort are keenly alert. If they have been ap-
proached under some cover by a local security officer to provide 
information about the agent, they will have received a tremendous 
shock and their attitude toward the agent is bound to change. He 
may observe signs of fear, sudden prying curiosity, avoidance, or 
even unusual pleasantness, on the part of such persons. He ma:y have 
nothing but a feeling that their attitude has changed. Such warning 
signs should never be ignored. 
If the agent is carrying out proper countersurveillance procedures 
he may detect signs that he is under observation. Although one would 
think that an agent detecting such signs would take strict measures 
to remove evidence, in many cases he has simply continued on his 
way?often with unfortunate results. 
From time to time the agent may detect that his quarters, or his 
place of work, have been tampered with. He may discover articles 
out of place or missing, or signs of the rumpling of clothing in 
drawers, and the like. There are simple methods of so arranging 
various objects that their movement can be detected. Very frequently, 
the secret search of one's premises is an important warning that 
one is suspected. However, inquisitive persons and thieves also en-
gage in this kind of activity. 
The arrest or disappearance of confederates or accomplices is, of 
course, a warning that no one could misunderstand. 
It is often possible for the sponsor of a secret agent to warn him 
through some prearranged system of communication that he should 
suspend operations, flee immediately, or the like. The most careful 
preparation and planning is essential to assure that the agent will be 
able to verify the authenticity of a warning, as well as to understand 
it correctly. From time to time persons have been trapped by "warn-
ings" fabricated by the local security service and intended to stampede

them into some unwise action. Persons who should have known better 
have fallen for such simple tracks as an anonymous telephone call 
from "a friend," an anonymous letter dropped into the mailbox or 
shoved under the door, even a visit by an unknown well-wisher. Of 
course, in the areas where resistance to Communism is high there 
will be a person here and there who, out of the goodness of his 
heart will assist an enemy agent. But in the vast majority of cases, in 
a totalitarian country, fear of the consequences and general suspicions 
of everybody effectively prevent people from helping each other 
secretly?which is one of the main reasons why totalitarian govern-
ments survive. 
Arrest occurs in two basic forms: overt and secret. In overt arrest 
actions, the Communist services tend to use a good deal of manpower 
to bar escape and to crash into the rooms of the suspect with the 
minimum loss of time. Occasionally they will have access to the keys 
to the suspect's lodging and use them for even swifter invasion of 
the premises. Sometimes these services deliberately create a great fuss 
during the arrest action, presumably in order to intimidate and 
impress the population. Arrest in this form indicates the intent of the 
authorities to liquidate the operation and formally charge and sen-
tence the persons apprehended. The agent is advised to plan his 
resistance toward minimizing the offense, trying to get the charges 
changed to criminal charges and in general to aim at leading the 
arresting authorities to conclude that common crime is in fact the 
principal activity of the arrested persons. 
In case of overt arrest, the prisoner in Communist hands in a civil-
ized area can expect standard criminal processing, including photo-
graphing and fingerprinting, body search, replacement of belongings 
with a prison uniform, medical check, a hot shower bath, and assign-
ment to a cell under close guard. In case of espionage suspects, these 
procedures will be very thoroughly carried out. The arrestee can ex-
pect to confront one or more interrogators for a long time to come. 
In the case of secret arrest, quite a few of these procedures may 
be omitted. The prisoner may find himself in a safehouse, and the 
physical search may concentrate on depriving him of the means of 
suicide. The search for evidence may thus be a good deal less 
thorough than it might otherwise be. There may be evidence of con-
cern for his state of mind in many cases; but in others the sternest 
and most thorough processing will occur. The prisoner should keep

ApprimafgocrtiAlease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T031WRA9.AX9.008-4 
alert to every nuance of the processing, as he can often gain clues 
as to how much is known and what is intended. He should be par-
ticularly alert if he is left in the company of talkative guards or "fellow 
prisoners" for long periods of time, as these persons will in all proba-
bility be plants trying to elicit information from him, and influence 
his attitudes. 
In secret arrest operations, the person detained is usually accosted 
on the street by a number of men who "escort" him to prison or a 
safehouse as inconspicuously as possible. Secret arrest as a rule means 
that the arresting service has plans which require that the fact of the 
suspect's arrest be concealed as long as possible. This does not neces-
sarily mean he is to be turned loose to be used as an informer, for the 
intent may only be to gain time and avoid scaring others before 
arrests can be made. It may mean that the arrestee is expected to pro-
vide evidence leading to the identification and arrest of persons not 
yet known to the security service. Occasionally a person is arrested 
on trumped up charges in the hope of getting him to provide evi-
dence against himself by surprise and under high pressure. The pos-
sibility also exists that the arrest has been undertaken secretly in 
order to avoid embarrassment if the prisoner has to be released for 
lack of evidence later?that is to say, the arrest is a bluff. But in a 
good percentage of the cases there is a substantial prospect that the 
person detained may be let loose to function as a doubled agent, and 
the arrested person should take comfort from this circumstance and 
plan his defense accordingly. 
Interrogation 
While the prisoner is being processed into his cell, last minute 
preparations for his interrogation will be under way. The interrogators 
who are to deal with the prisoner will be putting the finishing touches 
on their interrogation plan and examining the materials recovered 
during arrest and body search. Frequently, the prisoner will not be 
interrogated for some time after entering his cell. During the interval 
the prisoner should review the main points of his cover story and of 
his fall-back story and decide what his attitude toward the interroga-
tors will be. He may be fed, briefed on the rules, and allowed to go 
to sleep, only to be suddenly awakened and hurried off to an interroga-
tion cell.

CONFIDENTIAL Interrogation 
If the prisoner has been secretly arrested, his handling can vary 
widely. He may not be searched. He may be brought to a safehouse. 
He may be given a very friendly reception. On the other hand, he may 
be subjected to very harsh and violent treatment, in an effort to force 
or frighten a confession out of him. Harsh or violent treatment and 
hasty interrogation are indications that the arresting authorities are on 
a "fishing expedition" and do not really have sufficient information 
and evidence in hand. 
/n the initial stages of any interrogation it is best for the prisoner 
to play the role of a well-intentioned, but confused and innocent 
victim. The jails are full of prisoners who made the mistake of being 
clear and precise in their replies to seemingly harmless questions. 
The first thing every interrogator has to determine is whether his 
prisoner can tell a straight story about anything, or whether he 
is in a state of confusion. Prisoners are under no obligation to 
collaborate with their captors by exhibiting good memories and 
making coherent statements. This is the time to forget as much as 
possible. 
In all interrogation sessions, the prisoner should try to discover 
the following: 
a. What is known about him; more specifically, what evidence 
does the interrogator have? Even Communist interrogators have 
to have evidence to convict suspects, and they seldom have as 
much as they pretend to have. Nothing should ever be admitted 
unless the evidence that the interrogator exhibits is overwhelming. 
In such cases the admission should be framed in such a way 
as to mislead the interrogator as to the true nature of the evidence. 
One should never assume that the case is hopeless and that one 
might as well tell all. 
b. Where did the interrogator get his information? The prisoner 
often overlooks the fact that the interrogator may let slip information 
which will indicate who betrayed the operation. By feigning 
stupidity and confusion and pretending not to understand ques-
tions, the prisoner may maneuver the interrogator into making 
further disclosures which may indicate the source of the betrayal. 
c. What are the intentions of the authorities? By the time the 
prisoner is in his cell, he will have many clues to analyze: The 
arrest procedure, the search procedure, the remarks which the 
Appi56ved For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03C62k1ateN40008-4 
ApprimgRaNlease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T031a/AFRAmoo8-4 
arresting authorities may have made within his hearing, and other 
circumstances preceding the arrest which he may call to mind. 
Thinking these things over as calmly and as thoroughly as pos-
sible can help the prisoner to plan his defense. 
d. How much importance do the authorities attach to the 
prisoner? When the prisoner faces his interrogators, he can gain 
valuable clues as to how much effort the opponent intends to 
make in his case. He may find himself confronted with an expert 
interrogator who knows the prisoner's language and background 
very thoroughly, or he may find a relatively inexperienced and 
ignorant interrogator working against him. The type of custodial 
handling, such things as the number of persons making the arrest, 
the speed and efficiency of his handling, ?the level of rank of 
officers dealing with him, all provide clues in this direction. 
In the period before arrest?and certainly before interrogation?
the prisoner should have made up his mind as to what facts he must 
conceal at all costs. Such facts would include: the identity or hiding 
places of other agents, the hiding places of items of evidence, the 
true objectives of the operation, and important information concern-
ing his superior officers and his sponsoring organization. 
Some General Rules 
The rules which will help a prisoner to deal with his persecu-
tors fall into two general categories: rules concerning attitudes and 
psychological defenses, and rules covering practical actions and de-
fenses. 
The first psychological rule is never to give up hope, no matter 
how desperate the situation appears to be. One must always bear 
in mind that the opponent is not only human but in all likelihood 
under heavy pressures of doubt and handicapped by fragmentary 
information. In espionage matters so much is cloudy and confused 
in even the clearest cases, that prisoners who know the game can 
frustrate their opponents--if they persist. 
The second psychological rule is to view oneself in custody as 
continuing the fight with other weapons and on another basis. 
The third rule is to view oneself as a patriotic hero fighting to free 
his people. After all, the soldier fights in groups, from which he 
draws courage. The secret agent generally spends most of his time

CONFIDENTIAL Interrogation 
fighting singlehanded without this type of strong support. His fight 
is waged against great odds; hence he deserves extra credit for 
heroism?not condemnation as a "cowardly spy." One's own evalua-
tion of oneself tends to get across to associates?and guards and 
interrogators are de facto associates of a sort, who may come to 
respect the prisoner who respects himself in spite of themselves. 
The safest pose is the pose of calm equality: "We are both doing our 
duty according to our principles." 
Rule four is in many ways the most important: Care must be taken 
not to slip insensibly into the attitude that there is no world except 
the prison, no future, and that the time scale of the prison is all that 
counts. It must consciously be remembered that there is another 
world and that one day the prisoner will have to face that world and 
its rewards or punishment. Liberation may be very sudden and 
soon?then what? 
Rule five is to remember one's own importance. The agent, con-
fronted with the vastness of the prison and the clandestine activity, 
tends in any case to come to consider himself and what he does as 
unimportant. This is both a harmful attitude and an error: the agent 
is often very important and never unimportant. He can within limits 
continue to have an effect upon the world even while tied hand and 
foot, possibly even a greater effect than when he was at large. He 
cannot know what is going on behind the scenes of the opponent's 
organization. His case may be a cause c?bre, or even the subject 
of international negotiations. The prison administration, however, will 
make every effort to make him appear to himself as the forgotten man. 
Combatting Environmental Influences 
The tactics of most Communist services are designed to weaken the 
prisoner through relatively simple but highly effective methods. 
"Brainwashing" as commonly understood is an inexact notion. The 
prisoner can expect to be confined in a bleak and uncomfortable cell 
illuminated with a very bright light 24 hours a day. He will be under 
constant observation but unable to communicate with anyone. He 
will be required to obey minute, irritating, and senseless restrictions. 
His food supply will be inadequate and particularly deficient in vita-
mins. He will be deprived of sleep, required to sleep in a certain posi-
tion when he does get a chance to lie down, and may have to stand 
for many hours on end. Interrogators and others will suggest that he

Apprearcil.oFasia?lease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03186fi4iRFRAI2008-4 
is guilty of all sorts of things and may alternate their treatment with 
sudden, unexpected interludes of kindness and even friendliness. The 
alternation of this treatment, especially when one is not prepared 
for it, can induce a state of mind gravely weakening the power to 
resist. Many former prisoners have stated that they were most weak-
ened by friendly approaches after a long period of hardship. They 
found themselves forgetting that the interrogator was their enemy. 
They found themselves accepting the idea that they had to exonerate 
themselves and rehabilitate themselves, succumbing to intense feel-
ings of guilt. 
The interrogators, while they have a great deal of latitude and 
authority over the prisoner's situation, nevertheless would get into 
trouble, possibly quite serious, if the prisoner died or became de-
mented or crippled as a result of the treatment he had been subjected 
to. The interrogator is not all-powerful. Prisoners should eat what-
ever food is placed before them to sustain their strength. With a little 
practice, however, some persons can vomit at will, and it could be 
effective if the prisoner suddenly did so upon the interrogator or in 
his presence. No interrogator enjoys close and continued contact with 
a prisoner who has lost control of his bowel movements. Fainting is 
sometimes an effective gambit. This interrupts the interrogation and 
creates time-wasting interludes while the prisoner is revived. The 
prison administration takes care to forestall attempts by prisoners 
to commit suicide. However, people have committed suicide in prison 
through dashing their heads against the walls, through biting their 
wrist arteries open, through inhaling items of food causing strangula-
tion, and through other ingenious methods. There is nothing to pre-
vent the prisoner from experimenting with suicide attempts in such 
fashion as to alarm the interrogator, and it takes a pretty determined 
interrogator to avoid making the prisoner's lot easier when this 
threat becomes evident. 
Immediately upon imprisonment the prisoner should devise some 
method of keeping track of time. This is most difficult if there is no 
daylight in the prison cell. The prison schedules and routines are often 
deliberately varied in order to distort the prisoner's sense of time. 
The prisoner can pass the time he records very profitably by engrav-
ing upon his memory, through the process of repeated recall, important 
details about his opponents which will be valuable later on. Unless 
the prisoner makes a conscious effort to memorize these details, when

he gets out of prison he will usually be unable to recall important 
facts, dates, and the like. The prisoner should memorize the features 
and mannerisms of the interrogators, particularly unusual items such 
as an accent, a deformity, or some striking habit. He should attempt 
to find out as much as he can about the building in which he is 
housed, particularly its location. He should attempt to become familiar 
with the guards, who in a sense are also prisoners. The "friendly" 
guard, of course, is usually a provocateur, so he should be told noth-
ing of significance except what the prisoner wants to reach the ears 
of his interrogators. However, cultivation of the guard can be used 
to elicit interesting details from him and may enable the prisoner 
to ease his own lot a little. Now and then the guard will be found 
who is in fact sympathetic to the prisoner. The prisoner should at-
tempt to identify the vulnerabilities of interrogators and, of course, 
always look for clues as to their identity. The intelligence services of 
the free world are very well informed as to the identities of inter-
rogators and can match the information the prisoner supplies with 
the information they already have to identify the interrogator fully 
later. 
People captured by Chinese or other Asian Communists may find 
themselves imprisoned with a group of "reformed" prisoners, rather 
than isolated. The other prisoners are under heavy pressure to "re-
form" the victim. They will endlessly argue with him, plead with 
him, and abuse him, exerting moral pressure, and surrounding him 
with an ideological environment that will cause him to feel deserted, 
guilty, and hopeless. A person caught in such a situation can play 
for time, as this process takes days and often weeks to be effective. 
He can also use the situation to create confusion. For example, he can 
tell different individuals "in confidence" very different stories, and if 
he is good at dealing with people, he can create feuds amongst the 
people seeking to "reform" him, playing one off against another. 
The effects of isolation and inactivity quickly weaken all?espe-
cially persons who are congenial and like human company. We all 
depend to a great extent on our associates for moral support and for 
a feeling of reality. When held in a dark cell, all alone, day after 
day, the desire for human contact, which can be satisfied only by the 
interrogator, grows very strong in many persons. Worry becomes an 
incessant companion. The tendency to see the interrogator more and 
more in a heroic light and as a friend also develops. Most prisoners

Interrogation iuttsJII  
expect to find the enemy to be vile and revolting, and their resistance 
is greatly weakened when they discover that the interrogator can be 
a fine, clean-cut, idealistic, and quite charming person. The best de-
fense against this approach is to keep telling oneself this is just an-
other trick. If one can develop insight into one's own human weak-
ness, much of the effect of this trick will be lost. The prisoner should 
realize that it is normal for a person in isolation to feel that he is 
losing his mind, to feel extremely guilty, to feel terribly lonely and 
anxious. The prisoner's fear that he is losing his mind is the best 
guarantee that he will not lose it. 
The personal equation in the relationship with the interrogator must 
be borne in mind. Most people do not have dominant personalities or 
great powers of leadership and persuasion. Some interrogators have 
a great deal of such power. They are persons who exercise natural 
authority over others, and the prisoner will find himself emotionally 
affected by the demands of such commanding persons. Here again, 
insight into one's own weakness is the best defense. 
It is also particularly hard to resist the blandishments of an inter-
rogator who is obviously convinced of the justice of his own cause, 
and sincerely attempts to "reform" the prisoner. It is well to remember 
that some of the most sincere persons in history have been the most 
vicious, such as, for example, Adolf Hitler. Sincerity is no guarantee 
of the justice of a cause, but unless one is on one's guard against 
it, one can become persuaded. 
As long as possible, and certainly until the pressure becomes in-
tolerable, the prisoner should stick to his cover story. If he has worked 
up a plausible story, and has learned it reasonably well, and has lived 
his cover, he may be able to make the interrogator believe it. This 
happens more frequently than most people think. The interrogator is 
just another human being. In any case, as the interrogation proceeds, 
the prisoner can elaborate and develop the legend or cover story, 
especially if he has had the foresight to appear to be very confused and 
mixed up in the beginning. If gaps in the cover story become appar-
ent, the prisoner can think up lies to insert. As the interrogation pro-
ceeds, he can rehearse these lies with the interrogator until the prisoner 
himself begins to believe the story. If, after a long time, the prisoner 
is forced to make a false confession he can use his fall-back cover 
story and go through the same routine as he did with the first story. 
Finally, if and when the prisoner is brought to admit that the fall-

CONFIDENTIAL Interrogation 
back cover story was a lie, he should go back to the original cover 
story, telling the interrogator that he had told the truth the first time 
and then had been forced to lie and now can think of nothing but 
to tell the truth. It should be noted, and remembered, that the truth 
would quite possibly not be believed in any case. It has been the 
experience of many prisoners who, at an early stage, made a truthful 
confession, that they received the same treatment as if they had lied. 
The reason is that the opponent expects the prisoner to lie and very 
often has no way of telling how much of his story is true and how 
much is false, most cover stories being a mixture of truth and false-
hood. 
During interrogation it is well to try to distract the attention of the 
interrogator from sensitive items of information. This can be done 
by pretending to conceal information of secondary importance in such 
a way as to get the interrogator interested in prying it out of the 
suspect. For example, a prisoner who has no confederates can tell his 
story in such a way that the interrogator will conclude the prisoner 
must have had help. Eventually the prisoner can involve innocent 
persons?preferably persons loyal to the regime?thus causing the 
investigative apparatus to waste a great deal of energy and, quite 
possibly to arrest and interrogate persons who cannot possibly pro-
vide assistance. 
Combatting Arguments 
The prisoner can expect to be assailed with many arguments, all 
intended to persuade him to cooperate. One argument that is fre-
quently effective is the statement: "We know all about your activities 
anyway. What I am doing is giving you a chance to explain and justify 
yourself." While this argument seems silly to a man who is not in 
prison, it has been extremely effective with many prisoners. Threats and 
promises are often made in a linked fashion. For example, the prisoner 
may be told he will be executed as a war criminal unless he cooper-
ates, in which case he may be redeemed and even allowed to go free. 
Particularly effective is the trick of minimization. The interrogator 
takes the position that the prisoner was a dupe, really did not intend 
to commit a terrible crime, was victimized by his superiors, did not 
understand what he was doing, and so forth. The interrogator says 
that he fully understands the prisoner's activities and reasoning and 
might do the same if he were in the prisoner's shoes. This technique 
Apprtged For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T031caVRARP4008-4 
Appritoyeercil.oFggigielease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T031e68gRitip008-4 
is quite effective in inducing a prisoner to make small admissions. Once 
such small admissions have been made, they are used to pry more 
and more information out of the victim. 
Another argument which is very effective when several persons in 
the same network have been arrested is based upon the natural dis-
trust people have for each other. The interrogator will say or imply 
that the other persons arrested have long since confessed, putting the 
blame on the victim now being interrogated. The prisoner is then 
asked what he has to say in his defense, and if he believes he has 
been betrayed, he may easily fall into the trap of trying to put the 
blame on his accomplices. The only safe rule, no matter how over-
whelming the evidence may be that others have confessed, is to stick 
to the story, and under no circumstances to attack one's associates. 
Political arguments are often effective, especially against prisoners 
who do not know the inside story of Communist activities. People will 
be confused by long quotations from political authorities attacking 
their beliefs. It should be remembered that the devil himself can 
quote Scripture to his purpose. Often quotations from very great men, 
such as Abraham Lincoln, are twisted and edited to suit such pur-
poses. Very effective is the "inevitable victory of Communism" ap-
proach. The prisoner is told that soon his homeland will be occupied 
by Communist forces and that he will be personally responsible for 
what happens to his family and friends if he does not cooperate. He 
will be told that Communist success is only a matter of time, and that 
he is wasting himself trying to prevent it. He will be told that he is 
pulling the chestnuts of other countries out of the fire, that he is a 
dupe of the capitalists, that his superiors are quislings and that the 
only way out is for him to help his enemies. 
A particularly dangerous interrogator is a convert to Communism 
who was formerly on the prisoner's side of the fence. He can say, 
"I used to believe the same way that you do. I changed my mind for 
such and such reasons, and you can do the same." The convert can 
persuade the prisoner to hope that he too can be redeemed by con-
version. After a long and miserable time in prison, this temptation 
becomes very strong. The best defense for the prisoner is to remember 
that conversion under duress is always suspect, and that, if the man 
interrogating him is a genuine convert, the circumstances of his con-
version could not have involved duress.

A prisoner can sometimes waste a great deal of the interrogator's 
time by long and involved descriptions of trivial affairs and matters. 
This is particularly effective if, from the beginning, the prisoner has 
used complicated constructions and confusing non sequitur in his ex-
planations. When stopped in a rambling discourse, the clever prisoner 
flounders and gets mixed up, loses the thread of what he was saying 
and then winds up starting at the beginning once more. Most inter-
rogators tend to let the prisoner talk in the hope that he will say 
something of value. In most Communist prisons the interrogator is 
required to report the prisoner's statements in writing. The more con-
fused and rambling the information is, the more time-consuming and 
repulsive the task of transcription becomes. 
In some circumstances it may be profitable for the prisoner to tell 
the interrogator that the day may come when the interrogator?like 
a number of the Nazi Gestapo?may find himself on trial as a war 
criminal. Some interrogators fear this ultimate fate. A prisoner can 
sometimes profitably attempt to involve the interrogator in an ideologi-
cal discussion. Most Communists render lip service to Marxist ideology, 
but know as little about Marx as the average religious person knows 
about the Bible, the Torah, or the Koran. It does no harm to ask for 
Marxist literature. Anything which will delay or sidetrack the inter-
rogation can be useful. Sometimes such literature will be supplied 
on demand, and the ingenious prisoner can contrive to waste the 
interrogator's time and energy in fruitless ideological discussions. The 
prisoner who knows the laws pertinent to his case can often quote 
it to help himself. Communist law is usually a farce, but it is a farce 
that Communists are expected to maintain. 
Warning 
In all cases, whether or not the prisoner undertakes to arouse the 
curiosity or the fears of the interrogator, great care must be taken 
not to arouse personal hostility. One of the most foolish and dangerous 
things a prisoner can do is to incur the personal hatred of the guards 
or the interrogators. 
It is customary in most Communist prisons for the prisoner to be 
required to sign the written protocol of each day's interrogation. If 
the prisoner has had the foresight not to carry specimens of his own 
handwriting with him, he can sign the protocol in a distorted hand-
writing (which he should have memorized). However he signs, he

Interrogation 
should always first write, "I have read this document," and then cross 
his signature over this line of writing. This is legal in most Communist 
prisons and hinders the use of the signed protocol as if it were a 
signed confession. To the limits of his ability, the prisoner should 
refuse to countersign documents written in a language he does not 
understand. 
Coping With Interrogator Tricks 
In addition to environmental influences, direct accusation, and 
moral pressure, the prisoner will have to deal with a great many 
tricks of the interrogation trade. There are so many of these that a 
full catalogue is impossible. Most of the tricks, however, are relatively 
simple, and once one has studied the pattern of trickery and types of 
common tricks outlined below, one should readily be able to spot 
most of them. It should be noted that these tricks are not confined 
to Communist interrogators, but are used by police and other interroga-
tors all over the world. The defense suggested will be discussed in 
connection with the individual approaches. 
A most obvious trick which is still surprisingly effective is to ask 
the prisoner why he thinks he has been arrested. The trick is very 
simple and very often provokes the prisoner into making disclosures 
which the interrogator had never suspected. The best defense is some 
statement which fits into the cover arrangement. If, for example, the 
prisoner is posing as a national of some other country, he may infer that 
he has been arrested because it is the policy of the local government 
to persecute citizens of his country. Whatever explanation the prisoner 
volunteers should be along the line of imputing persecution, or error, 
or blackmail, or some other discreditable motive to the arresting au-
thority. This is part of the basic posture of the prisoner of rejecting 
any implication that he could be guilty of an offense. As always, the 
reply should not be conspicuously clear. It is always safe to say one 
has no idea, but this reply is negative, and attacking is usually a 
better defense. 
Sometimes the prisoner will find himself accused or suspected of 
activities in which he has never engaged. This can be a trap, for it is 
quite possible that the prisoner, in his haste to establish an alibi by 
proving where he really was at a given time, will provide the arrest-
ing authorities with information of great importance which they 
did not have and may not even have suspected to exist.

Interrogation 
Sometimes elaborate scenarios are set up to induce the prisoner 
to believe that he is not, or not yet, under interrogation. For example, 
he may find himself awaiting processing in a cell with two or three 
other "prisoners," one or more of whom are actually informers. These 
persons will seek to involve him in a harmless conversation. The wise 
prisoner never forgets that there is no harmless conversation in. prisons. 
The prisoner may be asked to fill out some simple form concerning 
his belongings, and involving notification of relatives, employer, or 
friends. By filling out such a form the prisoner may provide the inter-
rogator with a specimen of his handwriting and often a great deal of 
useful information. If forced to fill out any forms, the prisoner is well 
advised to use a distorted handwriting and to put in false or mis-
leading information. Occasionally an interrogator will pose as a tech-
nical specialist. That is to say, a "guest" of the interrogation staff rill 
be left alone with the prisoner on the pretense that the interrogation 
has been interrupted to "talk shop." Depending on the cover story that 
the person under interrogation is supporting, he should or should not 
go along with this trick. 
A particularly devastating trick is to compel the prisoner to tell his 
cover story or legend backwards. It is, therefore, a good idea, when 
memorizing a cover story, literally to learn it forwards and backwards. 
When a question of alibi arises, that is to say, a determination of 
where the prisoner was at a certain time, the prisoner who has not 
lived his cover is especially vulnerable. For example, the prisoner may 
state that at a certain time he was at a certain hotel in a certain 
city. The interrogator makes a note of this and then, after some hours 
or days have passed, calls the prisoner in and says that he has in-
vestigated the alibi and asks the prisoner whether he noticed any 
unusual event during his alleged stay at the hotel. Conversely, the 
interrogator may tell the prisoner that at the time he was supposedly 
at the hotel, there was a hold-up or some other spectacular event. 
This he will do in the course of a "conversation" and the prisoner, in 
his effort to sustain his alibi may go along with the interrogator's 
fabrication and so trap himself. The interrogator, of course, may not 
let the prisoner know that he has been trapped. The best defense of 
a prisoner who has not been at the place he claims to have been is 
to plan in advance to claim a place where he could have been sleep-
ing at the time something unusual occurred. He could, for example, 
in the hotel situation, easily have missed even a fire in some other 
part of the hotel through being asleep.

Appri?nvOrg6:::?critiNlease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T031t048MM008-4 
The interrogator may have an enormous file on his desk and look 
into it from time to time as if reading about the prisoner. He may 
speak as if he knows a great deal, dropping names, mentioning 
addresses, even telephone numbers. This type of technique can be 
exploited to the prisoner's advantage, for the interrogator, in his 
efforts to impress the prisoner, may let slip many valuable items of 
information, including the extent of his own ignorance. 
Some interrogators have success with very simple tricks such as 
staring silently at the bridge of the suspects nose. This gives the 
suspect the feeling that the interrogator is looking through him. Most 
persons cannot stand a sustained silence. The wise prisoner will simply 
sit and stare back. 
Sometimes interrogators resort to very persistent and detailed ques-
tioning about matters about which the prisoner has no knowledge, 
with the result that, when a question is slipped in to which the 
prisoner can provide a satisfactory answer, he will feel relieved and 
let fall information he should keep to himself. 
Sometimes a prisoner is plied with questions which make no sense. 
Most persons worry about losing their minds or at least self-control 
in such situations and naturally assume that they themselves are slip-
ping, when in fact the interrogators are deliberately talking nonsense. 
It is a good idea to play around with this trick to keep the interrogator 
talking nonsense as long as possible, as this gains one time. 
On occasion prisoners are stripped naked and made to stand before 
one or more interrogators for long periods of time. Sensitive individ-
uals find this extremely trying. We all rely upon our clothing to sustain 
our image and our status. One good defense against this kind of thing 
is to begin to cough and sneeze and tremble and to show preoccupa-
tion with the physical rather than the mental result of such indignity. 
A common expedient is to upgrade the prisoner's living conditions 
as he becomes more cooperative. He may begin prison life in a dank 
or mosquito infested cell and advance to a cell which may even have 
a carpet and a private toilet. He may be confined with other prisoners 
who pretend to have a dreaded disease, such as tuberculosis, a venereal 
disease, or a skin disease, or even leprosy.2 
Persons who have visible leprosy are no longer infectious. Tuberculosis bac-
teria exist everywhere in prisons anyway. Venereal disease cannot generally be 
communicated without the cooperation of the victim.

Interrogation 
A prisoner of importance may find himself in the hands of a 
"medicarspecialist who gives him psychological examinations and may 
tell him he is on the verge of insanity and suggest that he take some 
injection. Everyone has heard rumors of the use of truth serums 
and other debilitating drugs, "brainwashing" drugs, and the like, and 
many persons are disposed to feel that no one could blame them for 
confessing when confronted with or injected with drugs. 
As a matter of fact, a determined person can successfully resist 
truth serums and other chemical gadgets. It is obviously very frightening 
to be visited by a soi disant medical specialist suggesting shock treat-
ments, nerve resection, frontal lobotomy, or castration as a means of 
"helping" the prisoner to become "normal." These expedients lose 
their effectiveness, however, if the prisoner realizes they are tricks, 
and that a prison administration will not usually countenance any 
such activities. 
The Cuban interrogators have used a particularly devastating 
expedient to break the will of prisoners who resist: the false firing 
squad. A common variation of this trick is to have the prisoner 
brought out to witness the execution of some other prisoner. Some-
times the execution is real and sometimes it is staged. He then is 
told his turn is next, he is blindfolded and led to the stake, a volley 
of blank cartridges is fired. The effect of this is naturally overwhelming, 
and is heightened when the prisoner is told, after he discovers he 
is still alive, that the next time he may not be so lucky and then 
he is given one more chance to tell his story. One defense against 
this trick is the knowledge that he will not be executed as long as 
he has not provided the information the regime seeks. As a matter 
of fact, prisoners nowadays are seldom executed without some form 
of trial, even in Communist areas, because of the effect upon the prison 
administration of allowing too much arbitrary mistreatment of 
prisoners. As far as is known, Communist services make little use of 
electromechanical "lie detectors" or polygraphs, apparently because 
the general hypocrisy and paranoia of Communist societies make it 
impossible to get reliable results. On occasion some trickery employ-
ing a machine represented to be a "lie detector" may be employed. 
The person interrogated is best advised to deny any imputations by 
the machine that he is lying. 
A variant of interrogation trickery that is as old as the hills but 
still traps many persons is the "good guy", "bad guy" trick. This 
66 
Approved For Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03S9V6MMI10008-4 
Apprmy@ichFotalease 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T0318WARWAn008-4 
is worked as follows: One interrogator consistently harasses, insults 
and badgers the suspect, accusing him of lying, threatens him with 
violence, pushes him around and in general behaves very badly. The 
other interrogator is a friendly and rather well-intentioned man 
who plays the role of the friend of the prisoner, attempting to re-
strain the "bad guy" and protect the prisoner. Eventually the prisoner 
is left alone with the "good guy" who then attempts to win the prisoner's 
confidence by condemning his colleague. Strange as it seems, many 
a prisoner falls for this trick. Most persons are now aware of the 
existence of mirror windows or two-way mirrors and realize that 
someone may be watching them. Ordinary mirrors, however, are 
occasionally used so that the interrogator can watch the prisoner 
and his reactions while appearing to look elsewhere. The interrogator 
may go to some other part of the room to fumble with a drawer or 
some other object and casually make a remark to the prisoner which 
contains frightening implications, and observe how the prisoner reacts 
when he does not believe he is under observation. 
Interrogators often seek to aggravate a prisoner by pointing out 
such signs of guilt as sweating, crossing and uncrossing of legs, nail 
biting, blushing, or aversion of the eyes. Persons not guilty of anything 
become exceedingly nervous and uncomfortable when under inter-
rogation. In point of fact, only hardened criminals and aberrant 
personalities of certain types behave calmly in such a situation. The 
best defense is to say one is always nervous and ill-at-ease when in-
terrogated or questioned or even in conversations. The display of 
horrible photographs of bombing victims, murder victims, or other 
atrocities occurs occasionally. The interrogator calls to the prisoner's 
attention that he is responsible for atrocities. This provocation has 
two objectives. It can make a person feel guilty, or it can provoke 
him into attempting to justify the acts of the power he supports. 
The best defense is to deplore these misfortunes and to take no 
stand whatsoever with regard to them. 
The prisoner finds himself in a particularly hazardous situation 
when he makes some small admission and the interrogator tries to 
use this to pry more information out of him. Of course, "the longest 
journey begins with a single step," but there is no law that says 
that a person, having made one step, necessarily has to take further 
steps. An admission or a slip of the tongue can be used by the 
resolute prisoner to lure the interrogator up a false trail.

CONFIDENTIAL Interrogation 
Some interrogators will provide the prisoner with pencil and paper 
and demand that he write his life history. This is a very tiring and 
time-consuming activity. If the prisoner has maintained his posture 
of confusion effectively, there is nothing to prevent him from preparing 
a most confused biography. A great deal of time can be gained in 
this way, as well as much peace and quiet for recovery of equilibrium 
and review of the situation. 
The prisoner should conceal all knowledge of foreign languages, 
as far as possible. The interrogator will be very interested to identify 
the foreign languages spoken by the prisoner and may use a number 
of tricks, such as suddenly addressing the prisoner in a language 
he is suspected to know, or speaking to a third person in this 
language, while observing the prisoner. He may say something uncom-
plimentary or startling about the prisoner, seeking to cause a visible 
reaction. If a strange language is spoken in his presence, the prisoner 
should always make the appearance of trying to hear and understand 
what is said. Many prisoners who know a foreign language act ostenta-
tiously uninterested in such a situation, but the normal behavior of a 
man who does not know a language is to listen attentively in the effort 
to catch a word here and there, finally to give up and lose interest. 
Prison informers are not usually brought forward while there is 
intensive interrogation, but may be after the prisoner has been in-
terrogated or if he is held indefinitely in detention pending investiga-
tion. The prison informer can be exceedingly dangerous or useful 
depending upon the skill of the intended victim. It is wise to regard 
all fellow prisoners as informers. Especially suspect, however, should 
be persons who warn the prisoner against other inmates of the jail, 
persons who are quite healthy in spite of the miserable prison con-
ditions. The informer often has the task of discouraging a resistant 
prisoner. The prisoner should never lose sight of the fact that con-
tact with an informer or other provocator gives him an opportunity 
to supply deception information to the interrogation staff, while 
pretending to be telling the truth in confidence. 
The interrogator will tell the prisoner, "we are alone and can 
talk completely privately." A tape recorder may be ostentatiously 
displayed and turned off so the prisoner can talk "off the record." 
Many tall for this although common sense should tell them that no 
prisoner is ever alone with any interrogator. Even if several people 
are not listening in on concealed microphones and recording on

concealed machines, what the prisoner tells the interrogator will 
be told to everyone needing to know and often enough to the world-
at-large. In fact, no prisoner can ever be sure he is truly alone 
anywhere. Not only are peepholes and audio devices easily employable, 
and closed circuit TV a possibility, but the prisoner may find himself 
quartered in a cell with a person he has every right to trust and who 
is in fact trustworthy, in order that concealed devices can pick up 
their conversation. Stool pigeons confined in a cell with a prisoner 
may point out a "hidden" microphone and involve him in a discus-
sion outside its range, where another microphone is known to them 
to be hidden. 
Propaganda Exploitation 
One of the most painful ordeals the agent-prisoner has to undergo 
is the attempt of the apprehending service to exploit him for propa-
ganda purposes. Efforts may be made to get him to denounce his 
sponsors and the regime he has been serving in favor of the Com-
munist system, both on paper and in public before cameras. De-
pending on the intentions of the Communists, the prisoner may have 
to undergo a show trial or some other legal farce. Show trials usually 
require that the prisoner rehearse his part in the show until it is 
letter perfect. Commonly, he will be rehearsed in a story which 
displays him as pleading for mercy and as the victim and/or accomplice 
of a capitalist machination. 
One gambit used with success in many cases is to invite or allow 
the prisoner ?to write one or more letters to his loved ones. These 
letters must conform in many parts to a prescribed text. If the agent 
has prepared for this contingency in advance by arranging a simple 
open code with his loved ones, he can use this opportunity to convey 
useful information. The code must be simple, and cannot convey 
complicated ideas. Provision in such a code should be made to 
send at least the following messages: 
a. What is stated about my situation is (is not) true. 
b. I am ( am not) being severely maltreated. 
c. I suspect (know) I was betrayed by   
d. The enemy knows ( does not know) who my accomplices 
were.

Interrogation 
In some show trials, prisoners have had the courage to denounce 
their rehearsed pleas. In the case of a prominent prisoner this 
action may have some value, as the foreign press may be represented 
or hear of it. However, in the average show trial no reporters other 
than Communist sympathizers will be in the courtroom. The most 
heroic conduct on the part of a prisoner ordinarily will not be men-
tioned by such persons. As a rule, therefore, the prisoner should aim 
to make himself as uninteresting and useless for propaganda purposes 
as possible. The propagandists do not like to put on a show with 
unreliable persons?or persons who show of symptoms of crippling 
mental or physical mistreatment which might arouse the sympathy 
of an audience. All trials end with a predetermined verdict on which 
courtroom conduct, unless it is bitterly hostile to the Communists, 
will have no effect. 
The thing to bear in mind in refusing cooperation in propaganda 
exercises is that in the long run it will have no effect on the fate 
of the prisoner whether he complies or not. On balance he will prob-
ably be better off if he does not comply. For some reason, the 
Communists tend to inflict more suffering and demands on the 
weak than on the strong. 
At times the prisoner may be trapped by technical devices used 
without his knowledge. He may be asked to review some progaganda 
statement out loud and then state what he thinks of it. A secret 
tape recorder will be set up to record his voice apparently saying 
what in fact is merely being read. It is, therefore, advisable for anyone 
given anything to read to read it in silence. Sometimes statements of 
the prisoner are taken out of context and merged with something he 
said elsewhere to make a damaging statement. There is little the 
prisoner can do to guard himself against an effort of this kind unless 
he says nothing at all, which is always a method to be tried but 
can seldom be sustained long if the interrogator chooses to employ 
drastic measures. 
Penitentiary, Escape, Release 
Once the prisoner has passed through the sentencing procedure, the 
interest of the authorities in his case declines very sharply, although 
attempts may later be made to recruit him as an informer. The pris-
oner should bear in mind that entry into a penitentiary with a long 
sentence does not necessarily mean that he will serve this sentence.

Important captured Communist agents are from time to time ex-
changed for agents of the West. From time to time there are diplo-
matic negotiations, as in the case of the Cuban and the East German 
prisoners, resulting in the release of thousands of individuals: who 
had resigned themselves to many years in prison. There is the pos-
sibility of escape. There is the possibility of the overthrow of a Com-
munist regime. This is a danger that the regime is constantly preoc-
cupied with. In the recent case of Czechoslovakia, an explosion of 
the entire Communist system in Europe was thought to be imminent. 
This can and will happen again and again, possibly with increasing 
frequency. The prisoner should bear these consoling factors in mind. 
In the penitentiary or concentration camp the prisoner will again 
find human association. Among the prisoners he meets there will be 
persons with whom he can cooperate, but there will also be secret 
informers against whom he must defend himself and whom he can 
also exploit by telling them whatever it is he wants the authorities 
to believe. The prisoner should always beware of special officers in 
the prison who have a stature higher than the guard personnel, es-
pecially "welfare officers" or "morale officers", or "political indoctri-
nation officers". These are very often state security service men re-
sponsible not only for keeping an eye on the prisoners, but for watching 
the guards. Some of the guards will be extremely venal and others 
will hate the regime. 
The prisoner should look upon himself in the penitentiary as con-
tinuing the fight in a special situation, not simply as a man who is 
out of action until release. His conspiratorial skills and training can 
be used to good advantage in the prison. He can learn a great deal 
more about conspiracy in the prison. This is, after all, the school of 
conspiracy in which the Communists learned their trade. A prison is, 
in a very real sense, a typical Communist country in miniature. Skill-
ful and determined prisoners have effectively operated within such 
penitentiaries safely and for long periods of time to create great diffi-
culties for the prison administration, organize escapes, subvert guard 
personnel, and sabotage the installation. 
In considering escape plans and confederates, the prisoner must 
never forget that the prison administration from time to time may 
induce provocateurs to suggest escape, and thus dupe the prisoners, 
later visiting heavy additional punishment on them. A provocation 
of this kind generally destroys escape ideas for quite a long time.

Interrogation 
A provocation which is elaborate, but sometimes is used, is to 
allow the prisoner to escape in company with another prisoner who 
is actually a member of the security service. Usually the escape is 
"miraculous" and the prime mover is the provocateur. The intent is 
to win the confidence of the prisoner. In a variant of this trick, 
the prisoners escape, and meet the confederates of the provocateur, 
who profess to distrust the prisoner, consider him a stool, become 
very angry, and threaten to kill him unless he can prove his loyalty 
by proving that he has been operating against the regime. The temp-
tation to betray operations and contacts under such conditions is 
strong. The best defense is to say nothing on the grounds that one 
can never trust anyone and take one's chances, for it is after all 
by no means unusual for one prisoner to help another escape without 
ulterior motives. 
The prospects and conditions governing physical escape and sub-
sequent evasion of controls vary so widely that only very general rules 
can be given here: 
a. Be careful whom you trust ( see above on types of provoca-
tions). 
b. Be realistic as to the prospects of success: it is one thing to 
get out of a prison; it is quite another to get out of the country, 
and it may be foolish to try physical escape if other factors are 
tending to promote the chances of early release. Prison guards may 
be lax because there are other obstacles to escape beyond the 
perimeter. 
c. Do not aggravate your situation by committing serious crimes 
in the escape effort; for example, murdering a guard will usually 
result in a death sentence. Of course, there may be occasions of 
active warfare in which the prisoner in his escape action is in effect 
undertaking guerrilla warfare. This is not commonly the case, how-
ever, for a secret agent arrested in alien territory. 
d. Beware of becoming involved in escape plots from which 
you may later want to withdraw. The others plotters may decide 
you know too much. 
e. Above all, never become involved with persons who are sin-
cere but indiscreet. 
Release from prison can come about, as already mentioned, through 
a number of factors over which the prisoner has no control. One

of the ways to get out of enemy custody most easily is to get oneself 
recruited as a double agent, that is to say, to let oneself be "turned". 
The hostile service, of course, is aware of this, but sometimes has 
no choice but to try to recruit agents from among its captives. It 
is well for the agent to memorize the factors which can make him 
a desirable "turn around" for his captors: 
a. Special access or other capability to accomplish something 
for them. 
b. Lack of publicity in his case. 
c. Fundamental "job loyalty." If a man conveys the impression 
that he has desperately and loyally defended the interests of his 
sponsor so long as he thought the sponsor was in the right, only 
turning his coat when he came to see how wrong his sponsor was, 
he will win a great deal more trust than if he gives the impression 
of merely yielding to pressure. 
d. "Unpacking." In general, before a person will be considered 
really "doubled," he will have had to make a full confession of 
his activities. It is possible to display the appearance of this pro-
vided the planning has been thorough, even while concealing vital 
information. The agent can best plan his ultimate "confession" ( really 
a third cover story) at his leisure in his cell after he has had many 
sessions with his interrogators and has discovered what they 
actually know. He can devise a story which explains the known 
factors and makes him look attractive from the point of view of 
potential to do things the opponent wants him to do. Woven into 
the story should be factors which induce the opponent to think 
he can control the potential "double agent" through blackmail. For 
example, the prisoner in the course of "unburdening his soul" can 
confess to serious but not easily checkable misdeeds, such as em-
bezzlement or fraud. Confession to crimes such as murder is fine, 
provided investigation by the opponent will confirm that such a 
crime was in fact committed, the guilty person not apprehended, 
and the prisoner could have committed it. The prisoner may "betray" 
an ambition to become a figure of power in his homeland which can 
only be realized by collaboration with the enemy. The prisoner 
must be very careful in pretending to become "converted" to the 
opponent's faith. Protesting too much is usually suspect, but true

ulation is, of course, fatal to any hopes of emerging as a double 
agent. 
Most prisoners in jail for clandestine operations find themselves 
free as a result of one or another event unexpectedly and suddenly. 
A word of caution is in order: There is a tremendous temptation to 
share one's joy and information with all one encounters in the first 
wild elation of release. This should be rigorously suppressed, for 
only harm can come from spontaneous disclosures, even when fully 
true, to unauthorized persons before coordination with the original 
sponsor has been effected. Publicity may for example alert the person 
who betrayed the prisoner, so that he may escape or destroy evidence. 
Whatever is said will be twisted by certain publications to the det-
riment of sponsors, friends, and relatives and thus may endanger in-
nocent persons. Public recriminations against the Communists for 
treatment received in prison can hinder the release of other prisoners, 
and possibly damage secret operations which are under way. For 
maximum effect, release stories have to be enriched with information 
not known to the released or escaped person, and publicized at the 
right time and place. It may be desirable to avoid any publicity, as 
this may be just what the opposition hoped to achieve. 
Above all, the prisoner should never forget that one can turn 
almost any situation to one's advantage with a little luck and care-
ful planning.

THE BOGOTAZO 
Jack Davis 
On the afternoon of 9 April 1948, angry mobs suddenly and 
swiftly reduced the main streets of Bogota to a smoking ruin. Radio 
broadcasts, at times with unmistakable Communist content, called 
for the overthrow of the Colombian government and of "Yankee 
Imperialism." Many rioters wore red arm bands; some waved ban-
ners emblazoned with the hammer-and-sickle. A mob gutted the 
main floor of the Capitolio Nacional, disrupting the deliberations of 
the Ninth International Conference of American States and forcing 
Secretary of State Marshall and the other delegates to take cover. 
The army regained control of the city over the next day or two. 
But not before several thousand Colombians had been killed. It was 
the bogotazo. 
The reaction in Washington was also dramatic and swift. Congress-
men and commentators alike lamented that Communist Russia had 
scored a signal victory in the Cold War. The recently organized 
Central Intelligence Agency in particular was rebuked for having 
provided no warning of this "South American Pearl Harbor." And 
on 15 April the Director of Central Intelligence defended the Agency's 
performance, first before a congressional subcommittee investigating 
the failure of US intelligence, and then before the Washington press 
corps. 
This article attempts to assess the impact of the bogotazo on the 
history both of Colombia and of the CIA. The passage of two decades 
is a mixed blessing in this undertaking by one who was not a partici-
pant. Some formerly disputed aspects of the affair seem clear in 
retrospect; other aspects remain or have become murky. Those among 
the readers who personally experienced this dramatic episode, either 
in Bogota or in Washington, are urged to transmit comments to the 
editors of the Studies, so that a more definitive account can be 
written for the history of the Agency. MORI/HRP

Bogotd: The Aborted Revolution 
One thing now seems clear amidst the confusion that still surrounds 
the bogotazo: Colombia in 1948 was closer to social revolution than 
it has ever been before or since. The old order was under challenge 
from a forceful and extremely popular politician, Jorge Eliecer Caftan, 
and the poor in the cities, especially Bogota, were in a rebellious mood. 
But it was the assassination of the one that turned on the dreadful 
violence of the other. No one else was able to harness the savage 
energy of the mob; certainly not the feckless Colombian Commu-
nists, though they tried. The government preferred to blame the 
riots on Communist agitation and foreign intrigue, rather than to 
address itself to the underlying causes of popular discontent. Today, 
some twenty years later, the same elite, somewhat expanded and 
more enlightened, still controls Colombia. Indeed the bogotazo has 
served as an antidote to revolution, because the ruling classes now 
tend to avoid the excessive partisanship and disdain for the welfare 
of the masses that helped set the stage for the rising of the poor 
on 9 April?"Black Friday"-1948. 
Throughout nearly all its history, political and economic power in 
Colombia has been monopolized by a small elite which has ruled 
through either the Conservative or Liberal Party, or through some 
combination of the two. Leaders of national stature who attempted 
to organize the masses against the oligarchs were rare. Caftan was 
one such. He was himself of humble origin and mixed blood. He 
was a staunch antagonist of oligarchical rule and a spellbinding orator. 
His keynote was "I am not a man, I am a people." 
Yet by 1948 Caftan had captured control of the Liberal Party, 
which was the majority party even without his broad personal fol-
lowing. Only a split of the Liberal vote between Caftan and an 
oligarch nominated by the Party had enabled the Conservatives to 
capture the presidency in 1946. Caftan was a strong favorite to 
win the presidency in the election scheduled for 1950. His role as 
Liberal Party leader, naturally enough, somewhat curbed his license 
to attack the oligarchs of both parties. 
The bogotalios, usually resigned to their poverty, had turned bitter 
in the years immediately following World War II. Times were bad; 
the rich made their clever adjustments, but, the poor suffered simul-
taneously from soaring prices and declining job opportunities. Also, in 
the usual pattern of Colombian history, the return of the Conservative

Party to power in Bogota in 1946 meant that its partisans in the hin-
terland, with the help of the army and police, were intimidating 
their Liberal counterparts. Early in 1948 Caftan had addressed a 
rally of 100,000 in Bogota and demanded an end to government per-
secution and violence. 
The gaitanistas were angered still further by the fact that their 
hero had not been appointed to the Colombian delegation to the 
International Conference of American States which convened in 
Bogota on 30 March. Moreover, Foreign Minister Laureano Gomez, 
to the Liberals the most feared and hated Conservative leader, had 
been selected to head the Colombian delegation and thus had been 
"elected" president of the Conference. There is evidence that some 
supporters of Caftan, apparently with his knowledge and perhaps 
mild encouragement, were considering the possibility of a coup d'etat 
for 1948. This probably reflected their awareness of the growing popu-
lar discontent and their doubts that a fair election would be held 
in 1950. In any case Gaitan's murder on 9 April also put to death 
a potentially revolutionary moment and the bogotazo was no more 
than its wake. 
The assassination took place on a downtown street as Caftan was 
walking to lunch. The murderer was apparently one of those fanatics 
or psychopaths we say may never be excluded from calculations on 
the safety of dignitaries. His motives cannot be known for certain, 
for he was battered to death on the spot by frenzied bystanders. 
Inevitably, charges were raised of the complicity of the Conserva-
tive Party, of the Communists, and of the US. But no strong evidence 
of a political plot has ever been produced. 
Naturally enough the outraged populace of Bogota was convinced 
that the Conservatives were the culprits, and its vengeance was di-
rected primarily toward the Party's symbols, though also toward 
those of the oligarchy generally. Laureano Gomez's newspaper build-
ing and his suburban estate were destroyed. The mobs that attacked 
the Capitolio were looking for Laureano (though they were also 
The assassin was identified as Juan Roa Sierra. The Colombian police indicated 
that he was seeking revenge for a relative slain by an Army officer, who had been 
acquitted on 8 April on the strength of a legal defense by Caftan. A subsequent 
government-sponsored study of the affair by Scotland Yard agents does not men-
tion this story, but pictures Boa as a mystic with delusions of grandeur who had 
sought a political appointment from Callan and had been given a run-around.

shouting anti-US slogans). Cathedrals and priests as well as public 
buildings and commercial establishments were made targets, be-
cause the Church was associated with both the Conservative party 
and the old order. 
What of leadership? Caftan's stalwarts gave the mob some early 
political direction, hoping to topple the government. The red arm 
bands were the traditional symbol of the Liberal Party. The Commu-
nists had long planned to disrupt the Conference but before the as-
sassination had attempted nothing risky or substantial. After the 
start they also did what they could to enlarge the disorders and 
to give them a political direction. From time to time they gained 
access to the microphones at radio stations captured by rebel forces. 
Through the Soviet Embassy they also had access to clandestine 
stations and to printing presses. But the Communists were neither 
strong enough nor popular enough to take command. Caftan had 
stolen most of their thunder through his own populistic appeals. 
In terms of both radio time and street leadership the bogotazo was 
mostly a gaitanista affair. In any case, frenzy and drunkenness soon 
diverted the mob from its interest in political vengeance and revolu-
tion, to violence and looting as ends in themselves. 
There were many foreign radicals in Bogota at the time, to 
advertise their causes in the publicity extended to the Conference 
of American States. Fidel Castro, then 22 years old, happened to 
be one of them. Thorough investigations indicate that he played only 
a minor role. Castro subsequently reported that he tried to turn the 
mob into a revolutionary force, but was defeated by the onset of 
drunkenness and looting. The episode may have influenced his 
adoption in Cuba in the 1950s of a guerrilla strategy rather than 
one of revolution through urban disorders. 
Most of the police in Bogota were pro-Liberal and gaitanista in 
their political loyalties. Many joined the mob or handed over their 
arms soon after the rioting began. In contrast, the army, slowly aug-
mented from provincial barracks, stood by the government. The 
soldiers followed the orders of their officers and shot volley after 
volley, point blank, into the crowds. This?together with the stead-
fastness of the Conservative president, the growing concern of many 
Liberal leaders about the anti-oligarchical nature of the affair, and 
the unwinding of the mob's fury?brought a sharp reduction in vio-

lence within a day or two. But continued sniping, dislocations brought 
on by a general strike, and a dispute over the burial site for Gaitan 
kept the capital city unsettled for another week. 
Events in the outlying cities were much less significant, though not 
devoid of drama. Some Communists were able to raise the Soviet 
banner over the town hall of Barranquilla. Apparently it took but 
one army officer to tear it down. Liberal partisans gained control of 
Cali temporarily. A presumptuous group of local Communists: then 
declared the establishment of the "Soviet Socialist Republic of 
Colombia." Here too the army swiftly reestablished government con-
trol. The officer in charge was the then obscure Colonel Gustavo Rojas 
Pinilla, whose effectiveness and devotion to duty were duly noted 
in Bogota. 
As it turned out the bogotazo probably had its most lasting impact 
on the countryside. Political violence involving feuding Liberal and 
Conservative bands, never completely absent in Colombia, had been 
increasing in tempo since the return to power of a Conservative gov-
ernment in 1946. (The Liberals previously had ruled since 1930.) In 
the period before April 1948, the Conservatives, with help as we 
have indicated from army and police, had been getting the best of 
it. With the news of the bogotazo, Liberal partisans struck everywhere 
with fury. But soon Conservative bands had better arms and were 
able to retaliate. Rural warfare reached a new high level known as 
La Violencia, which was to claim more than 200,000 lives in the 
following decade. This remarkable bloodletting, stimulated by the 
bogotazo and nourished by the deeply rooted feuds between Conser-
vatives and Liberals, also reflected the hard times economically, the 
attractiveness of violence as a way of life for many peasants, the 
ineptness of the government, and the senseless factionalism of the 
country's more civilized politicians. 
The inability of the civilian leaders to curb either the rural violence 
or their own bitter political disputes opened the way for Rojas 
Pinilla, now a general, to take control as military dictator in 1953. 
He made progress in reducing rural warfare; but by 1957 his regime 
had become so arbitrary and corrupt that he was put out of office by 
the oligarchy and the military establishment. The former in particular 
feared Rojas' efforts to organize a mass anti-oligarchical party. In 
1958, to curb such tendencies and to preclude future bogotazos, the 
civilian leaders set up a remarkable coalition government called the

National Front that has prevented Liberals and Conservatives from 
competing for office directly.2 They have over recent years considerably 
curbed their partisanship, and worked, with modest success, toward 
improved conditions for the poor. The National Front is scheduled to 
run to 1974. Another bogotazo is possible; but for the moment there 
is no revolutionary leader of stature, and the poor, while perhaps 
discontented, are not seething. 
Washington: The Aborted Investigation 
The- Washington reaction to the Bogota riots was heavily influenced 
by the initial responses in Colombia of the Conservative government 
and of Secretary of State Marshall. The Colombians charged that 
both the assassination and the riots were parts of a "premeditated 
movement inspired by Communists and undesirable foreign elements" 
to sabotage the conference. Marshall reported to the press that the 
riots had been Communist-inspired and as such were an extension 
to the Western Hemisphere of the tactics of subversion and violence 
that the Soviet Union was employing in Europe. He insisted that the 
conference continue in Bogota (as it did), so that international com-
munism would be denied a victory over the free countries of America.3 
In 1948?the year of the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, 
of concerted Communist drives to gain power in France and Italy, 
and of the beginning of the Berlin blockade?a deliberate Soviet ex-
tension of the cold war to the Western Hemisphere was indeed a cred-
ible phenomenon to many US observers. The following is from a New 
York Times editorial (April 14): 
"Backing up the findings of the Colombian Government, Secretary of State 
Marshall and other delegates to the Inter-American Conference have now 
likewise accused Soviet Russia, and its tool, international communism, of in-
stigating the riots that wrecked Bogota and cast a pall over the whole West-
ern Hemisphere. Basing their judgment on first-hand information and per-
sonal observation on the spot, they see in the tragic events which interrupted 
their deliberations the same powers and patterns at work as in the attempted 
insurrections in France and Italy. And that makes Bogota, as Mr. Marshall 
said, not merely a Colombian or Latin American incident but a world affair, 
and a particularly lurid illustration of the length to which Russia is willing 
to go in its no longer ( cold war) against the democracies." 
Among other features, the office of president is rotated between the parties and 
the congress is divided equally between them. 
Within a few days after the riots the Colombian government began reporting 
that the assassination had been a non-political act. In time Marshall indicated that 
he believed that the Communists had taken advantage of the disorders but had 
probably not directly initiated them.

The US reaction to the bogotazo?in particular the talk of an in-
telligence failure and the search for a scapegoat?was conditioned 
not only by cold war jitters but also by election year politics. The 
Truman administration was already under attack from its Republican 
adversaries for, among other things, being inept and naive in the 
ways of combatting Communism. Governor Dewey, campaigning for 
the Republican presidential nomination, had been attacking Truman 
for the shortcomings of the recently-established Central Intelligence 
Agency even before the Bogota riots. Then on 12 April he let loose the 
following blast: 
"If the United States had the adequate intelligence service it should, it 
would have known about Communist plans for the Bogota uprising in ad-
vance. Knowing what goes on in the world is just as important as know-
ing how to handle it. The Panama Canal is vital to our security. Yet because 
of the dreadful incompetence of our present government, we apparently 
had no idea what was going on in a country just two hours bombing time 
from the Panama Canal. 
"During the war the United States had the finest intelligence service 
operating all over South America under J. Edgar Hoover. After the war 
Mr. Truman ordered the entire service discontinued. He cut off our ears 
and put out our eyes in our information service around the world." 4 
Dewey's attack in good measure reflected the prevailing attitude 
in this country toward the role of intelligence organizations. The shock 
of the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent 
wartime emphasis on prediction of enemy attack led many Washing-
ton observers to believe that all crises should be predicted in advance. 
Thus, only a grievous intelligence failure would have caused us not 
to have had prior warning of the Bogota riots ( especially insofar as 
they were part of a well-planned Communist conspiracy). 
At least several congressmen thought so, including Rep. Clarence J. 
Brown ( Republican, Ohio). On April 10, the day after the riots, 
Brown urged an investigation of the intelligence community by the 
House Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. 
This committee had sponsored through the House the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 under which CIA had been established. Brown let 
it be known that he intended to call first Admiral Roscoe H. Hillen-
koetter, Director of Central Intelligence, and then representatives of 
the State Department and of the military intelligence services.

Bogotazo 
At this point the motives, actions, and interactions of participants 
become private and complicated. Hillenkoetter made some abortive 
attempts to quash the investigation. He apparently also became con-
vinced that the CIA record on the matter was a good one. He dis-
cussed strategy with President Truman who apparently encouraged 
him to confront the congressional critics with the CIA record. Truman 
and his political advisors, qua Democrats, may have decided that 
such a course might strip Governor Dewey of a political issue and re-
dound to the credit of the Administration as well as of the Agency. 
In any case Hillenkoetter did appear on 15 April before an executive 
session of a special subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures. 
Representative Brown, chairman of the subcommittee, opened by 
stating that it was authorized to investigate the CIA to "learn whether 
the Secretary of State and other high officials were promptly warned 
that a revolution was impending in Colombia, and that their attend-
ance at the Bogota Conference might endanger their lives and bring 
embarrassment to the United States." 
From his hard charging testimony the Admiral appeared to be any-
thing but a reluctant witness. He rebuked his critics by stating that 
CIA had known of "unrest in Colombia" and of the "possibility of 
violence and outbreak aimed primarily at embarrassing the American 
delegation and its leaders," and that this information had been trans-
mitted to officials of the State Department. 
He then read excerpts from classified CIA intelligence reports, 
based on information received from agents in Bogota during Janu-
ary-March 1948. These talked of Communist plans to demonstrate 
against and block the progress of the conference. Some of the reports 
indicated that at least one advisor to Caftan was an advocate of 
social revolution and was in contact with Colombian Communists 
and the Soviet Embassy. 
IIillenkoetter in his testimony charged that Embassy officials in 
Bogota had blocked the transmission to the Department in Washing-
ton of a key report. He said that this report, dated 23 March, indicated 
"confirmed information that Communist-inspired agitators will at-
tempt to humiliate [the] Secretary of State and other members of 
[the] US delegation . . . by manifestation and possibly personal 
molestation," upon their arrival in Bogota. ( This would of course have 
taken place late in March.)

Apprggsltripor Release 2005/01/26 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000gp60008-4 
This was a period of endemic wrangling between State and CIA. 
Some Department officials believed that the Agency was trying to 
build an "empire" abroad; Agency officials for their part resented 
State's reluctance to provide cover for Station personnel and the 
interference of ambassadors with the transmission and dissemination 
of CIA reports. Thus, Hillenkoetter may have raised the issue of inter-
ference to spark congressional support for the Agency's position. 
Also, the Admiral apparently felt that he had erred in not disseminat-
ing this particular report (which had been transmitted to CIA Head-
quarters) on his personal authority as Director of Central Intelligence, 
and he may have wanted to present the facts of the case to the 
congressional investigators in the most favorable light. 
In any case, his charges served to give the critics of the administra-
tion a new target for attack in the Bogota affair?the State Depart-
ment. Representative Brown made a big point of the intereference 
issue at the hearings ( and subsequently before the House and at 
press conferences). He said that Congress in establishing CIA had not 
intended for State to have the power of veto over Agency reporting 
and that he would work to see that the will of Congress prevailed on 
the matter. State, moreover, was now subjected to criticism from 
Brown for not having called off the conference after being warned by 
CIA of pending disorders. 
Then, after the executive session, someone called in the press, 
perhaps Representative John W. McCormack ( Mass.), the only Dem-
ocrat at the hearings. And Hillenkoetter at the subcommittee's direction 
read his testimony?complete with excerpts from top secret reports 
and charges against State?to reporters at dictation speed. 
State reacted the same night with its own news briefing. The 
State spokesman cited classified reports from the Bogota Embassy 
warning of possible disorders and molestations of delegates during 
the Conference. The State reports were more general than the CIA 
documents but covered similar ground. The Department said that 
Secretary Marshall had known of these warnings before his de-
parture, and had brushed them aside with "salty remarks," stressing 
that it was "quite ridiculous to suppose that the twenty-one Ameri-
can republics should even consider being intimidated by the protesta-
tions of one kind or another from Communists, or anyone else." State 
made it clear it had received no warnings of assassinations or major 
rioting.

The story?of explanations, charges, and countercharges complete 
with release of classified information?became the lead item in major 
newspapers around the country on 16 April. That afternoon, for 
the benefit first of the House of Representatives and then of the 
Washington press corps, Representative Brown repeated his charges 
of an intelligence fiasco, now directing his fire mainly against the 
Administration and the State Department. The story thus again got 
prominent newspaper coverage on 17 April. Next came a period of 
weeks during which editorialists, political columnists, and radio 
commentators turned their attention to the story. Officials of CIA 
reported that the more perceptive journalists came around to sup-
porting its role in the affair. Officials at State made the same claim. 
When Secretary Marshall heard of the rousing events in Wash-
ington he ordered an end to the public dispute between State and CIA, 
and to the airing of classified documents. His authority was sufficient 
to have his will prevail, though he probably was aided by growing 
embarrassment among senior White House advisers and leaders of Con-
gress. The Brown subcommitte never reconvened?despite the Chair-
nan's public statements that he planned to call witnesses from State 
and the military intelligence organizations, and even Marshall himself 
when he returned to the country. Marshall's success in continuing the 
conference despite the devastation of Bogota and in obtaining a reso-
lution condemning international Communism soon produced news 
stories of US diplomatic successes and decreased attention to charges 
of intelligence failures. 
Inside CIA 
As dramatic an event as the bogotazo was in the first year of the 
Agency's history, it is difficult, twenty years later, to point with 
confidence to any specific impact on the course of affairs. Admiral 
Iillenkoetter was convinced that the Agency's record of warning was 
a good one, and a number of critics were disarmed by his testimony. 
Yet some within the Agency appear to have reacted as if the Bogota 
affair had indeed been an intelligence failure, or at the least a warning 
of institutional vulnerability to charges of not having adequately 
forecast one or another crisis. The bogotazo thus appears to have 
been one event?perhaps a pivotal early event?that led to a strong 
emphasis in reporting upon "beating the newspapers" on any story

of crisis involving Communists. One veteran observer speaks of a 
"Bogota syndrome," that is, an extraordinary concern with early warn-
ing of crises and emphasis on the Communist angle. 
There apparently was soul searching on the intelligence side of 
the house as well. The Office of Reports and Estimates ( so remembers 
one veteran) had discussed in staff meetings the possibility of dis-
orders during the conference. The consensus was that the Colombian 
government would be able to control the disorders, and no warnings 
were published in the monthly Review of the World Situation as 
it Relates to the Security of the United States, or in other serials or 
special reports. The bogotazo may have produced considerable pres-
sure for greater attention to the publishing of warnings of possible 
crises, especially those with any Communist connection. Considering 
the Cold War atmosphere at the time and the mandate of the 
collectors to concentrate on Communist affairs, such developments on 
both sides of the Agency were probably inevitable, with or without 
the stimulus of the bogotazo. 
The bogotazo may have been one factor ( doubtless a minor one) 
leading to the establishment in 1950 of the Board and Office of 
National Estimates. Some observers and commentators during 1948 
concluded that the Bogota affair revealed weaknesses in the analysis 
and coordination of intelligence that exceeded in importance any 
weaknesses in collection. The Eberstadt Report to the Hoover Com-
mission (i.e., the Report of the Committee on National Security 
Organization to the Commission on Organization of the Executive 
Branch of the Government), of November 1948, made this point 
without specific reference to Bogota: 
"The greatest need in CIA is the establishment at a high level of a small 
group of highly capable people, freed from administrative detail, to con-
centrate upon intelligence evaluation. The Director and his assistants have 
had to devote so large a portion of their time to administration that they 
have been unable to give sufficient time to analysis and evaluation. A small 
group of mature men of the highest talents, having full access to all informa-
tion, might well be released completely from routine and set to thinking about 
intelligence only. Many of the greatest failures in intelligence have not been 
failures in collection, but failures in analysing and evaluating correctly the 
information available." 
The assassination of Gaitan was very probably a private and irra-
tional act and, as such, an unpredictable event. To that extent, so

attitudes of Caftan and his devout followers, and less about the plans 
of the small and far from bold Communist forces. Secretary Marshall, 
however, would probably have dismissed warnings of political tensions 
as summarily as he did warnings of Communist disorders. 
This is not to say that at the time all hands within CIA were 
attributing too much importance to the Communists as a factor 
in Latin American instability. The 12 May 1948 issue of the Review 
of the World Situation as it Relates to the Security of the United 
States presents an analysis which has withstood the test of history: 
'The disturbances which interrupted the Bogota Conference are more 
properly attributable to the basic political and economic tensions prevalent 
in Latin America than to international Communist conspiracy. Without ques-
tion the Communists were conspiring to embarrass and discredt the Confer-
ence, and they were quick to seize the opportunity afforded by the outbreak 
of violence. That outbreak, however, was clearly the spontaneous reaction 
of Liberal partisans, already on edge as a result of acute political tensions 
and party violence, to an assassination no doubt erroneously attributed to 
the Conservative government.-
There are perhaps some lessons in the bogotazo for assessing con-
temporary crises in Latin America: 
(1) When a critical situation is as fully developed as was the 
case in Colombia in 1948 (i.e., the presence of a rebellious popular 
mood, of a virile radical leader, and of reports of coup plotting), 
the intelligence community with its current resources on Latin 
America will almost certainly be tuned in generally. Complex prob-
lems of timing and interpretation, however, will probably still rise. 
(2) The actual moment that gives birth to revolutionary violence 
or to violence without revolution will often depend on a chance 
combination of circumstances and will thus be largely unpredictable. 
(3) Many potentially revolutionary situations will not produce 
social revolutions; strong leadership with broad popular appeal 
will almost always be an essential ingredient. 
Richard L. Stokes, in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 17 April 1948, attributes 
the following to a State Department official: "Only Superman and Steve Canyon 
combined could have learned that, at 1:15 p.m., on April 9, six blocks away from 
the meeting place of the conference, Jorge Eliecer Caitan would be shot to death 
by a personal enemy named . . . Sierra. Such pinpoint predictions of acts virtu-
ally unpremeditated are beyond the power of any human intelligence service."

(4) Assessing the role of Communists in a revolutionary situation 
takes special care; their noise and dramatic presence may not be 
based on much actual strength and popular appeal. 
(5) Finally, an outbreak of violence, even of dreadful violence, 
need not permanently weaken the reigning regime.

PLATT'S LAW 
All old-time analysts in the profession have heard of Platt's Law; 
few are familiar with its exact terms. Like Darwin's theory of evolu-
tion, it has often been distorted or misrepresented, giving rise to 
grave errors. For the guidance of the young we publish herewith the 
original formulation of this seminal discovery, as recently exhumed 
from ancient files. 
25 August 1951 
Mr. Sherman Kent 
Office of National Estimates, CIA 
My dear Mr. Kent: 
As one of the earliest purchasers and most constant readers 
of your classic on "Strategic Intelligence," I am writing to invite 
your attention to the omission from your ( otherwise) excellent book 
of a fundamental principle in the production of intelligence. 
Assume the following situation: 
1. You have prepared after much thought and wide discussion 
the first draft of an Intelligence Estimate. This draft contains certain 
details and statements which your careful study of the problem leads 
you to believe should be included. 
2. This first draft is reviewed by the first echelon above your 
own. Members of this echelon read your details. After thus getting 
the benefit of your explanations, they find these details self-evident and 
so eliminate them from the paper along with many of your other 
pet phrases. So the second draft is prepared stripped to the bare es-
sentials. 
3. The second higher echelon, on reviewing the second draft 
thus cut to the bone, finds many of the bare statements lacking in 
proper justification or background. This second echelon therefore 
insists on the inclusion of more explanation and details. So the third 
draft is prepared, restoring the details and pet explanatory phrases 
which echelon No. 1 cut out. 
4. In turn, the next higher echelon reviewing this third draft 
and receiving the benefit of the explanations now once more included, 
finds these details unnecessary and cuts them out. . . .

infinitum. 
General Principle derived from the above universal experience: 
Whether or not the necessary explanatory details and pet phrases 
of an, intelligence paper appear in the paper as finally published, 
depends entirely upon whether the number of higher groups which 
successively review the paper is even or odd respectively.

Intelligence during a 
Presidential transition. 
DDI/NEW YORK 
Paul Corscadden 
Within hours after the polls had closed on 7 November 1968, Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson invited President-elect Richard Nixon to the 
White House to plan for the smooth transition of power by Inaugura-
tion Day 1969. Summoned to attend the meeting of the two men on 11 
November were a number of President Johnson's key policy advisers 
and administrators?including the Director of Central Intelligence, 
Richard Helms. 
Decision at the White House 
President Johnson had determined at the outset of the 1968 cam-
paign to provide intelligence briefings for the major candidates, After 
the nominating conventions, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, 
Mr. Nixon, and the independent George Wallace had received brief-
ings from Mr. Helms on Soviet strategic farces, the political situation 
in South Vietnam, and the Russian intervention in Czechoslovakia. 
Now, prior to the inauguration, Mr. Johnson proposed to make avail-
able to his successor the same intelligence product shown to him. 
Consequently, he instructed the Director of Central Intelligence to ar-
range intelligence support of the President-elect and key members of 
his staff at their temporary headquarters in New York City. 
Such arrangements had proved make-shift in the past. An impro-
vised situation room at the Commodore Hotel in New York had been 
visited no more than a few times by Governor Sherman Adams prior 
to the inauguration of President Eisenhower in 1953; John F. Kennedy 
had been briefed two or three times by Allen Dulles before he took 
office on 20 January 1961. Mr. Helms 'determined, in keeping with 
President Johnson's wishes, that Mr. Nixon should benefit from a more 
sustained effort. The DCI assigned to the Directorate of Intelligence 
responsibility for providing support to the incoming administration. 
The Office of Current Intelligence would be the executive agent, col-
laborating with other Agency components as required.

SECRET DDI/New York 
The DCI decided to send a three-man team to New York to confer 
immediately with the President-elects chief aide, Robert Haldeman, 
at the Hotel Pierre at Fifth Avenue and Gist Street. The Deputy Di-
rector of Intelligence, the Director of Security, and the Deputy Chief 
of the Office of Current Intelligence left for New York the next day. 
On the advice of the Secret Service, the President-elect had estab-
lished offices on the 38th and 39th floors of the Pierre. Access was by 
way of an elevator that was monitored at lobby level by special agents 
with short-wave radios and a direct telephone line to a command post 
on the 39th floor. Security's New York office had arranged with the 
Secret Service for the Agency officers to be admitted and also for the 
installation in the suite occupied by the President-elect, himself, of a 
safe for storage of classified documents. 
The Nixon staff agreed that CIA should establish at its own expense 
a secure area to house a combination Situation and Reading Room to 
which members of the staff could come to read classified documents 
after they had received their security indoctrination. Space was not 
readily available in the Pierre, which, in any event, the Secret Service 
had already discovered could not be rendered truly "secure"?so it 
was decided to locate the Agency's outpost, dubbed "DDI New York," 
in the basement of the Nixon Campaign Headquarters at 450 Park 
Avenue, at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and 57th Street. This 
site, which was formerly the world headquarters of the North American 
Missionary Alliance and was slated to be demolished, would attract 
far less attention than the Pierre. It also served as the office of Richard 
Allen, who then functioned as the President-elect's principal staff ad-
viser on foreign policy. 
The DCI, the Executive Director, and the DDI approved plans for 
the facility, and OCI assigned two officers to man it. The staff was 
completed by a secretary drawn from the New York Domestic Con-
tacts field office plus two experienced communicators from Head-
quarters. 
The area selected for the Agency's facility was adjacent to an ele-
vator and not far from the building's boiler room and heating plant; 
it had served during the campaign as a mimeograph room and now was 
used as a catch-all for broken office machinery, discarded press re-
leases, and a wide assortment of debris. The Office of Logistics was 
given 72 hours, a weekend, to transform the area into a habitable

office. Logistics personnel hauled furniture, safes, and office equip-
ment by van from Washington, arriving on Park Avenue early on a 
Sunday morning?shortly after a special security team had "swept" 
the premises. They quickly emptied the area, painted walls and ceil-
ing, sealed off air ducts leading to other floors of the building, installed 
window air-conditioners below sealed street-levels grills, and rewired 
all of the electric circuits to allow for the installation of communica-
tions equipment. 
Such frantic activity had not gone unnoticed by other occupants of 
the building, who assumed that the "Secret Service," ?the "Federal 
Bureau of Investigation," or some sensitive military agency had 
moved in and would, inter alia, assume responsibility for the physi-
cal security of all the President-elect's staff offices and even for the 
protection of Mr. Nixon's family. The Office of Security had decided 
not to identify the operation as Agency-sponsored but, rather, to allow 
anyone who learned of its existence to draw whatever conclusions he 
chose. Before long, staff secretaries were calling to ask that someone 
"behind the Black Door" investigate the disappearance of office sup-
plies and even find a purloined television set. The supervisor of the 
staff mailroom demanded one day that an Agency communicator 
"taste" canned hams sent as a Christmas gift to the President-elect. 
Effective 19 November with an eye to production schedules in the 
Office of Current Intelligence, communications between New York 
and Headquarters were open from 0500 to 2100 each weekday, from 
0500 to 1300 on Saturdays, and from 1700 to 2100 on Sundays. Ex-
cept for a one-day interruption because of power failure, communi-
cations remained open until late on the morning of 17 January 1969. 
The daily Vietnam Situation Report arrived the evening of its pub-
lication in Washington; the Central Intelligence Bulletin and The 
President's Daily Brief came soon after five o'clock each. morning. 
Ad hoc, crisis reporting could be sent at any time, and the Agency 
Operations Center was able to alert staff officers in New York to critical 
developments during non-duty hours. Daily courier service, which 
had begun on 13 November, continued through 25 November as a 
stand-by measure. 
Flexibility and availability were to be the keynotes of the operation. 
A complete set of publications in a sealed envelope marked "Eyes 
Only - the President-Elect" would be delivered daily to Rosemary

Woods, the President-elect's secretary, in Mr. Nixon's office. Nixon 
staff members who had access to the intelligence publications were 
to come to the facility whenever convenient. Current publications, 
along with appropriate National Intelligence Estimates, special 
memoranda, intelligence handbooks, and various graphic aids were 
prominently displayed. 
For the first ten days, only "finished" intelligence was made avail-
able. It soon became apparent, however, that the needs of the new 
administration did not coincide in every detail with those of the 
Johnson administration. The foreign press had begun to speculate 
openly about the incoming administration, its personnel, and its policy 
options. This and other information was available to the White House; 
little of it would reach the Nixon staff unless some vehicle were de-
signed to convey it. 
The Director of the Office of Current Intelligence on 29 
November compiled the first "Nixon Special," an "Eyes Only," all-
source intelligence memorandum for the President-elect. The Foreign 
Broadcast Information Service transmitted directly to New York 
foreign press treatment of the new administration. 
On 2 December, the "intelligence portfolio" was passed to Harvard's 
Professor Henry J. Kissinger, whose appointment as Special Assist-
ant for National Security Affairs was announced by the President-elect 
at a news conference at the Pierre. The same afternoon Kissinger came 
to the Agency facility on Park Avenue for a briefing. He was shown cur-
rent issues of all of the intelligence publications available in the fa-
cility, told what had been delivered to the Presientelect, and was 
pledged the utmost cooperation on the part of the DCI. He was also 
assured that the Agency was prepared to be as helpful as possible in 
shaping the types and subject matter of reports and publications and 
their format to meet the wishes of the new administration. Kissinger 
asked for time to become familiar with the demands that would be 
made on him by the incoming Chief Executive, but promised to ar-
range as part of his daily schedule a 15 minute intelligence briefing. 
He also accepted the offer of Agency officers to advise him immediately 
of any critical world development requiring the attention of the 
President-elect. Two days later, at a meeting at the Pierre, Kissinger 
requested a series of one-hour briefings on major problems confronting 
the new administration?briefings to be fitted into his schedule where-
ever possible.

DDI/New York 
At a meeting with DDI/New York officers on 14 December, Kis-
singer directed that Attorney General-designate Mitchell was to re-
ceive The President's Daily Brief, The Central Intelligence Bulletin, 
and all other reports in which he had expressed an interest. He had 
been one of the first for whom Haldeman had requested a security 
clearance on 12 November but subsequently was not available for in-
doctrination by Agency officers until after the President-elect unveiled 
his cabinet. Mitchell, a towering figure in the Nixon staff, was to be-
come a major consumer of these publications. One of the Agency offi-
cers met almost daily with the Attorney General-designate until the 
last day the Nixon staff worked in New York. 
The President's Daily Brief had been uniquely tailored to the needs 
of the outgoing administration?just as its predecessor had been 
shaped to the reading preferences of President John F. Kennedy. The 
authors Of the PDB 'could assume that President Johnson and his prin-
cipal advisers were familiar with the background of most of the sub-
jects covered each day and were often able to employ a shorthand style 
without sacrificing clarity or breadth. The President-elect and Kis-
singer, however well read, lacked familiarity with many of the prob-
lems dealt with in the PDB. 
This situation had not been unanticipated by the Agency. In fact, the 
Office of Current Intelligence already had begun to devise a new ver-
sion of the PDB for Mr. Nixon and his aides. Considerably expanded in 
length, the new brief had been circulated for comment to the DCI, 
DDI, and other principal officers in the Agency. With their 'concur-
rence, it was decided to send a new PDB to New York. 
Because of Kissinger's crowded schedule, his briefings were held 
on a somewhat ad hoc basis. The probing questions of the incoming 
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, his insatiable 
demands for assessments of the significance of even isolated develop-
ments on a low order of probability, meant that far more speculative, 
estimative 'analysis than normally characterizes current intelligence 
reporting was required. It was therefore decided to supplement the 
topics covered each day in the PDB and the occasional briefings by 
the DDI/New York officers with more detailed backup pieces by 
DDI analysts. These reports were written as soon as the makeup of an 
issue of the PDB was known in Headquarters and were sent to New 
York at convenient hours during the day. On 'several occasions senior 
analysts with special competence in the areas dealt with in these an-
nexes came to New York to meet with Kissinger. By the middle of

January The President's Daily Brief had been totally redesigned to 
meet Mr. Nixon's preferences. The new brief would consist of three 
sections?Major Developments, Other Important Developments, and 
occasional annexes?all double-spaced and printed on legal sized 
paper bound at the top. 
The first section, Major Developments, was subdivided into sections 
on Vietnam, the Middle East, Soviet Affairs, and Europe. This was 
not a static listing. As developments warranted, some areas could be 
dropped, others added. The second section, Other Important Devel-
opments, was intended to highlight problems which?though not yet 
critical?could in time engage US policy interests. The annexes were 
to fulfill the same role as the "problem papers" that had been sent 
to New York. 
Under the Johnson Administration, the PDB had been published at 
five o'clock in the morning, six days a week, and delivered to the White 
House an hour later. However, in order that he and his National Se-
curity Council staff would have time to mull over the intelligence re-
porting before meeting the Chief Executive, Kissinger proposed that 
the PDB be released at 5 or 6 in the afternoon, for delivery to him that 
same night and to the President the following morning. Changing the 
publication time meant an additional lag of 12 hours in the reporting 
time, but Kissinger pointed out that so-called "late starters" could be 
reported in The Central Intelligence Bulletin and specifically called 
to the President's attention. This arrangement, he believed would 
most satisfactorily meet the new President's plan to hold regular 
meetings with his key advisers at nine or nine-thirty each morning. 
Kissinger surmised that he would brief the President for 30 minutes 
each morning, immediately following these staff conferences. 
By the middle of January, DDI/NY had served its purpose. The 
Offices of Security, Logistics, and Communications stood by to re-
move files and communications equipment and to transport them under 
guard to Washington over the weekend. At 0730 on 17 January, a two-
man security team was already guarding a moving van that had been 
loaded with most of the furniture from the basement suite. Inside the 
building, packers were boxing the last of the files, and a communi-
cations technician stood by to dismantle the teletype equipment once 
Headquarters approved a request to do so. The last message, request-
ing this permission, was sent at 0840 EST. It was the 523rd message 
sent or received since the facility had opened and the 2,179th page of 
text.

Retrospective reflections inspired

THE 30 SEPTEMBER MOVEMENT 
IN INDONESIA 
John T. Pizzicaro 
Early in 1969, the Special Research Staff of the Directorate of In-
telligence published an extensive analysis of the Indonesian upheaval: 
Indonesia - 1965, The Coup that Backfired, by Helen Louise Hunter. 
It is classified SECRET-NO FOREIGN DISSEM, and may be obtained 
from the Directorate of Intelligence with appropriate authoriza-
tion. Mrs. Hunter's study is reviewed in the following pages by 
a senior officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who served in In-
donesia throughout the coup period. His observations on the events 
described are sublective, and the conclusions summarized are his own. 
The publication of Indonesia - 1965, The Coup that Backfired is an 
important event for serious students of the Asian scene. Before it be-
came available to the intelligence community there existed no reliable 
analysis of an episode that not only defied full comprehension at the 
time it occurred, but has since retained an aura of mystery and, indeed, 
controversy among observers in and out of government. We are there-
fore grateful to Helen Louise Hunter for her impressive accomplish-
ment in distilling out of masses of intelligence reporting an orderly, 
coherent and historically defensible treatise. Mrs. Hunter has gone well 
beyond the limitations of conventional research, and has produced a 
book?readable, intelligible, enormously interesting. 
The question has been raised?and it remains valid?could not this 
analysis have been produced without heavy classification or, better, 
with none at all? The need for a definitive treatment of the subject has 
been acute, for reasons that will be indicated below. And certainly 
Mrs. Hunter's study could hold its own in the public domain with ap-
propriate modification. The fact of the matter is that virtually all 
source material used in The Coup that Backfired was obtained origi-
nally via clandestine channels, and its release would have entailed 
serious complications. Hence, the decision to stand on Secret classifi-
cation. 
It must first be noted that almost no one these days is objective about 
Indonesia. People who have lived there either love it Or hate it; many MORI/HRP

of them leave bewitched. Scholars who have never set foot in the 
country adopt it sight unseen, and fight for eventual access. The excep-
tion to all this is Helen Louise Hunter. She speaks no Indonesian, has 
never been to the country, and has no axe to grind. But she has done 
her homework with painstaking thoroughness, and has developed 
cogent answers to all the important questions. Although Mrs. Hunter 
would be the last to claim final say on the complexities analyzed in 
The Coup that Backfired, it is hard to visualize a more definitive treat-
ment of that historic event on the basis of information currently 
available. Her paper was submitted in draft to a cross-section of CIA 
and State Department officers who had served in Indonesia during the 
coup period, thus permitting minor changes in detail and atmos-
pherics; as far as substance and the logical flow of the narrative are 
concerned, her account cannot be faulted. 
The key questions, of course, are relatively few in number, and have 
been asked repeatedly by interested observers since 0730 hours on 1 
October 1965. Who was Untung, and what was the 30 September 
Movement? Why were the generals murdered? Was the Indone-
sian Communist Party the prime mover, or was it an innocent by-
stander on the sidelines of an internal army upheaval? Was there a 
Generals' Council? What was President Sukarno's role? Answers 
to these basic questions emerged a very short while after the event, 
fragmentary at first, but gradually achieving perspective, and have gen-
erally withstood the scrutiny of time and the availability of new in-
formation. But the picture is not complete, and it may never be. 
A curious feature of the upheaval was that while the march of 
events was fairly dramatic and at times noisy, most developments?
especially in the early stages?were shielded from public scrutiny and 
made little sense to the unassisted observer. Overt sources were 
limited in access and utility. Even the redoubtable American press 
corps had a rough time of it during the early weeks, and was able to 
meet its reporting requirements effectively only by extensive piggy-
backing on US mission sources for both background and detail. In time 
the situation eased. The Indonesian press began to flex its muscles 
under Army supervision. People began to talk, and the rumor mills 
resumed operations. By and large, though, throughout the eight to ten 
months following the coup attempt, overt information remained 
inadequate and decidedly inferior to that available to the US Govern-
ment from clandestine sources,

Inevitably, there were periods of uncertainty and speculation as to 
what was happening and why, and what would happen next. The 
25X1 most striking of these occurred during the first 24 hours. Contact with 
ources had long before been 
placed on a maximum security basis, owing to the extreme tension and 
sustained threat to the American presence that characterized the months 
of mid-1965; prearranged schedules applied until such time as they 
could be adapted to meet the requirements of the new emergency. 
Should the latter have been foreseen? Ideally, yes. In practical terms, it 
would have been asking a great deal to predict an event that, for all 
its similarity to the traditional fire and brimstone drama of the Ramay-
ana, defied both the logic of historical dialectic and the apparent drift 
of Indonesian politics. An interesting facet, however, is that for weeks 
25X1 in advance of the coup,I reporting on developments within 
the Indonesian Communist Party?the so-called PKI?gave a graphic 
and detailed picture of its activities which led directly and, as we see it 
with the advantage of hindsight, inexorably to the events of 1 October. 
These included the caching of arms and grain, military training of 
youth and women cadres at Halim Air Base, and?most important?
the reorganization of party structure in the greater Djakarta area 
along military-tactical lines. The signs were clearly there, and a field 
appraisal of the situation was being coordinated in draft with the Em-
bassy when the coup brake. 
In Java, where ironies compound themselves, the wayang kunt 1 is 
normally cited by foreigners to explain the inexplicable or to account 
for whatever in Indonesian behavior defies Western comprehension. 
Late in the evening of 30 September, this writer attended a wayang 
in the suburban district of Manggarai. It was held outdoors in the 
village market place under the auspices of the mayor, and attended by 
a throng of contented-looking Indonesians from the neighborhood. The 
handful of foreigners present sensed no hostility whatsoever. As the 
show went on, the seats grew harder, and by 0100 the period of en-
chantment had passed; the next day was a working day. The road 
home was along Djalan Krakatau, past the house of the Army com-
mander, General Yani, and farther on past that of Brigadier General 
Sutojo, both scheduled for execution within a few hours. There was

happen on Friday. The route from Kebajoran to the city seemed nor-
mal enough until reaching DjaIan Thamrin and turning east on Mer-
deka Square. At that point the mood changed with the scenery. Strange 
troops guarded the intersections. Why strange? It is difficult to 
say, but they were not the usual custodians of local peace and order 
that Djakarta residents grew to recognize. They were infantry with 
serious faces and unfamiliar shoulder patches, armed and deployed 
tactically. The gates of the Gedung Telekomunikasi were closed 
and the area swarmed with troops. Further on, the American Em-
bassy was similarly encompassed. Instead of the khaki-uniformed Mo-
bile Brigade who customarily guarded the outer premises, infantry 
held the line, a heavy machine gun at the gate, although making no 
attempt to interfere with people arriving for work. It was a perplexing 
sight for seven-thirty in the morning. The next few minutes witnessed 
a rump staff meeting in the Embassy lobby, chewing over a story told 
by the Assistant Air Attache about a firefight behind his house in 
Kebajoran shortly before dawn. His servants reported that a general 
had been killed. Which general, he did not know. It turned out later to 
have been Pandjaitan. 
After comparing notes briefly with Embassy colleagues and officers 
reporting in, I felt that some personal reconnaissance was in order, 
particularly since the telephones were all dead. A meandering route by 
Volkswagen past the houses of key generals and other points of mili-
tary interest proved revealing. General Yani's house was cordoned 
off at each end of the block by military police. General Nasution's 
house was likewise inaccessible. The residence of Major General Par-
man was apparently deserted, but not under guard. A short distance 
away, Brigidier General Sukendro's residence was closed up tight?
not surprising since he was away on a visit to Peking?and that of 
Brigadier General Magenda showed no signs of life. The streets 
throughout that sector of the city were remarkably empty and quiet. 
Nearby commercial districts lacked their customary bustle, although 
they were by no means deserted. Approaching the Square again, green 
uniforms abounded. They swarmed about the Gambir railroad station 
on Merdeka Timur and on up toward Army Headquarters. Strategic

Command Headquarters (KOSTRAD) across the street had its share 
too, and although they looked like the others to the unpracticed eye, 
there was a difference. It was discernible, though hardly appreciated 
at the time, in the small patch of white cloth the former wore on their 
left shoulder bar. (By morning on 2 October Suharto's men were 
wearing a similar identification, but colored red.) Lastly, the For-
eign Department, its 'attractive white facade and pillars gleaming in 
the morning sun, was 'observed under heavy guard. Exactly what all 
this unfamiliar military pomp added up to became a little clearer when 
the writer returned to the Embassy to hear that Radio Indonesia 
had come on the air, proclaiming the existence of the 30 September 
Movement. The name of Lt. Col. Untung was on the way to becoming 
a household word, and the activities of the so-called Generals' Coun-
cil appeared to have some bearing on the events of that unusual 
Friday morning. 
To fathom the sequence of events thereafter, there is no better way 
than to sit down with The Coup that Backfired and follow Mrs. 
Hunter's tracing of its labyrinthine path. She has much to offer, 
even to those of us who, having been there, profess to understand 
what happened and why. Her paper is organized rather uniquely and 
in a way that lends itself to the layman's comprehension. The first of 
its four main sections deals with the events of the coup itself. The 
second focuses the movements of all leading personalities from the 
time of the coup until the curtain rings down on their particular 
act of the melodrama. Next she examines the plot itself as it un-
folded during the critical month of September, the period when 
plans were made and in a sense the outcome of the coup fore-
ordained. The fourth section, and in Mrs. Hunter's opinion the 
most important, concentrates on the final sequence of events lead-
ing up to the coup, including the decision to carry it out. An 
extremely helpful summary and statement of her conclusions are 
provided at the end. There is also an evaluation of the primary source 
material on which the entire analysis is based, namely, the pris-
oner interrogation reports produced by the Indonesian Army. Mrs. 
Hunter is careful to distinguish between her categories of material?
fact as established in the public domain, testimony of the coup par-
ticipants, and conjecture, whether her own or that of others. The key, 
of course, to any 'serious interpretation of 'the kaleidoscopic and some-
times contradictory pattern underlying this episode devolves on the 
validity of the Army interrogation material. The author accepts it as

essentially valid, and her reasons for doing so are cogent. The reader's 
task is further facilitated by a first-rate graphics representation of the 
coup highlights, including the only effective map analysis this writer 
has seen, plus some helpful time-and-movement diagrams, and, last 
but not least, a host of excellent photographs. 
With respect to the Communist Party, the author makes it crystal 
clear that PKI bore the major responsibility for planning and implemen-
tation of the entire operation. Other important Indonesians, not 
necessarily Communist, were also intimately involved. The ultimate 
question, and one which Mrs. Hunter scrutinizes with care, bears on 
the role of President Sukarno. She concludes that the evidence re-
flecting his full involvement is not conclusive, and from a legal stand-
point she is probably correct. Yet as a practical matter the evidence 
Mrs. Hunter marshals so graphically in these pages can hardly be 
construed as signifying anything less than Sukarno's intimate involve-
ment from the outset. The question is admittedly not open-and-
shut, and from the Indonesian standpoint there have been valid grounds 
for abstention from full and public attribution of responsibility to 
the former president. Witness General Suharto's extremely careful 
handling of the issue. 
As a problem of intelligence acquisition and analysis, it is interest-
ing to note how Sukarno's role in the 30 September affair became at 
once the central and vital question for both the Indonesians and those 
of us foreigners who were engaged in looking over their shoulders. 
Initially it was approached rather cautiously in discussion, sometimes 
pointedly avoided. Before long, however, it was clear that the question 
was under discussion in high cabinet circles, civilian and military. As 
diffidence faded, similar reflections appeared at lower levels of govern-
ment. It was soon apparent that in Army circles talk on the subject 
had taken on a brutal frankness. Well placed sources quoted Nasution 
and Suharto directly, notwithstanding the fact that those personages 
remained fairly circumspect in their public utterances. By late October 
there were indications that Sukarno's removal on grounds of his in-
volvement in the coup was already under consideration. As attitudes 
of leading Army figures crystallized, with General Nasution figuring 
as the hard-liner, the pattern was reflected in extensive reporting from 
a wide variety of extremely well-placed sources. Throughout Novem-
ber the pressure intensified and talk of an Army move to eliminate 
Sukarno, by assassination if he would not acquiesce, echoed in both 
military and political circles.

This period, it will be recalled, coincided with the killing of vast 
numbers of Communists or presumed Communist sympathizers 
throughout the country. Although Djakarta was spared the horrors of 
that nightmare, the city was by no means exempt from the emotions 
that gave rise to it. Thanks to tight Army discipline and intensive se-
curity measures sustained over many months, an explosive situation 
was kept under control. On the other hand, bitterness against the 
President continued to mount. More and more people believed! that 
he was just as guilty as PKI leader Aidit. And yet Sukarno, recovering 
from the state of shock that characterized his behavior in early Oc-
tober, had once again begun to play his cards skillfully. He refused 
to panic. He temporized on critical issues, minced his words on all 
possible occasions, and gave no sign of willingness to concede another 
inch to General Suharto. Many observers at the time believed he held 
the current edge in what was clearly a struggle for ower. His da s, 
however, were numbered. By mid-December 
undertook a detailed analysis of the situation, an a vise 
 that events were moving toward a showdown. Information t en 
available left most of us convinced that Sukarno was in-
deed a witting participant in the 30 September conspiracy. Whether 
the move against the Army leaders had been his original idea, or 
whether he merely responded to the advice of his henchmen, was con-
sidered essentially immaterial. The critical point was that Sukarno's 
endorsement of the coup plot made it feasible; his participation gave 
it an excellent assurance of success. Without him the plan would have 
been totally unrealistic. Headquarters was told that an appreciable 
number of highly placed Indonesian leaders had reached similar con-
clusions. Under the circumstances it was felt that the objective va-
lidity of their views was far less important than the fact that they en-
tertained them. Grounds for direct action were thus available; the 
showdown was believed to be near at hand. 
Two courses of action appeared open to the Army, each predicated 
on the assumption that history could not be turned back 'and that Su-
karno could never regain his former ascendancy. On the one hand, 
Suharto might opt for gradual assertion of authority over the operation 
of government; Sukarno could be neutralized slowly but steadily and 
relegated to figurehead status while the Army tightened its 'control. 
Or, Suharto could undertake more or less immediate action to 'strip 
Sukarno of his authority. His decision,  was be-
ing made for him?in part by the desperate economic situation of the

country which cried out for ameliorative action, and even more so by 
the intensifying political pressures converging on him, both within the 
Army leadership and among the younger political elements beginning 
to emerge as factors to be reckoned with. The latter included organi-
zations of university and high school students, already quite vocal in 
their attacks on the President. 
25X1 The analysis of the situation was discussed at some 
length within the Mission. Embassy opinion leaned toward the first of 
the two alternatives proposed.I I the grad-
ual approach would not suffice under the circumstances facing Gen-
eral Suharto. Thus, in concluding its rather lengthy commentary, 
25X1  bri 23 December that the next few wee, 
would probably see a resolution of the impasse, with the Army taking 
direct steps to terminate President Sukarno's control over the govern-
ment. Mid-January 1966 saw the crisis come almost to a head, precipi-
tated by student demonstrations over the cost of living. But the Army 
failed to follow through, and Sukarno was given another month or so 
in which to attempt his final maneuvers. The redoubtable old tyrant 
did his utmost in the cabinet reorganization of 21 February; he fired 
General Nasution as Minister of Defense, and appointed more leftist 
sycophants to ministerial posts than anyone realized were still above 
ground. That was the beginning of the end. In a few days the stu-
dent upheaval, under Army patronage but a remarkable phenomenon 
in its own right, engulfed Djakarta and paved the way for Suharto's 
move on 11 March when he forced the President to sign over to him 
authority for all measures required for the safeguarding of security 
and government stability. 
Not all Indonesians today view Sukarno's elimination with equa-
nimity. Pockets of support and even affection for him can still be 
found, particularly in the Nationalist Party strongholds of Central 
Java. By virtue of them Sukarno remains a. factor in Indonesian poli-
tics. He is, of course, no more than a factor; he is certainly not a 
power. 
An interesting sidelight on Sukarno's role in the 30 September 
Movement is the almost total lack of interest in it displayed by the 
American academic community. The latter, strongly influenced by 
George McT. Kahin and the Modern Indonesia Project of Cornell's 
Southeast Asia Program, have been much more attentive to the role 
of the Indonesian Communist Party in the coup and to the fate it has

suffered as a consequence. The fascinating thing about this rather un-
usual bias is that it developed in full bloom very shortly after the coup 
itself. It was couched then, and has been ever since, in language par-
alleling that used by the PKI when the latter on 2 October explained 
its relationship to the 30 September Movement: The Party merely 
endorsed the patriotic action of Lt. Cal. Untung in forestalling the 
expected counterrevolutionary coup of the Generals' Council sup-
ported by CIA. What happened was an internal Army affair, but in 
the words of the leading Communist newspaper the support and sym-
pathy of the people were on the side of the 30 September Movement. 
Over the ensuing weeks this theme was developed in greater detail 
at Cornell, but except for an occasional article bearing on it, almost 
nothing reached print. There was method in Corneffs cautious ap-
proach to the matter, based on concern lest the Indonesian military 
learn of the latter's hostility and decide to curtail access to the coun-
try. To date the so-called Cornell "white paper" remains unpublished, 
though it is available in the form of an unsigned dissertation dated 
1 January 1966, classified STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL, entitled A 
Preliminary Analysis of the October I, 1965 Coup in Indonesia. The 
Indonesians are naturally aware of the Cornell position, and they re-
sent it. The scholars predicate their position in large measure on a 
total rejection of the Army reports of prisoner interrogation, claiming 
that they are based on torture and fabrication, and they place little 
or no credence in the published confessions of the coup principals or 
testimony of other witnesses before the Military Tribunal. They ar-
gue that since the interrogation reports are not openly available, who-
ever gains access to them must be in league with the Army. In ac-
tuality, the trial evidence covers much of the same ground and offers 
ample food for thought to the interested reader. And there is the 
nub of the problem. Are the Cornell scholars really interested? Are 
they willing to consider any radical deviation from their own pre-
conceptions? This is a harsh insinuation, but it must be weighed. Ruth 
McVey, who for many years has been a major luminary and authority 
on Indonesian Communism closely associated with the Cornell group, 
took the firm position in 1965 that the PKI would not move directly 
to seize power, being content to settle for the slow but steady progress 
it had registered in the preceding ten years. 
This view has by no means been confined to the Cornell group. 
Donald Hindley of Brandeis and J. M. van der Kroef of Bridgeport 
took similar positions in their respective books published in 1965 be-

fore the coup. It has been the Cornell group, nonetheless, that has 
held most dogmatically to the idea that the PKI became the scape-
goat in the Indonesian upheaval and was unjustly saddled with re-
sponsibility for it. In this writer's opinion there is a serious question 
of intellectual integrity involved in the issue. How better to defend 
the thesis that the PKI would not do what it did than to argue that 
it did not in fact do so? 
A reflection of the amount of vitriol that can still pervade a gather-
ing of intelligent men and women over an issue of this character was 
noted in last April's meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of the Con-
ference on Asian Studies, in a confrontation between Guy Pauker of 
Rand Corporation and several proponents of the basic Cornell thesis. 
Pauker is an authority on the Indonesian Army and well read on the 
subject of the coup, his views on the latter being generally compatible 
with those depicted in Mrs. Hunter's analysis. After presenting his 
brief but cogent monograph, The Rise and Fall of the Communist 
Party of Indonesia, Pauker was attacked viciously for his reliance 
upon Army interrogation reports which according to one of his inter-
locutors (Roger Padgett, then of Cornell), Pauker knew were doctored. 
The attack was snide and ad hominem, a clear aspersion on his in-
tellectual integrity. Donald Hindley arose subsequently and criticized 
Pauker's reliance upon the doctored reports, but conceded that he now 
agreed with Pauker's conclusions regarding PKI involvement. The cha-
rade was carried further when another participant needled Hindley 
for endorsing Pauker's conclusions while disparaging his sources. 
To allay any reasonable doubts about the authenticity of the in-
terrogation material, the Appendix to Mrs. Hunter's study should be 
ready with care. She treats the matter with detachment, concluding 
that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the charge of doctor-
ing or fabrication on the part of the Army. Convictions die hard, 
though, and one may safely surmise that were The Coup that Back-
fired to be declassified and made public, it would be attacked by the 
academicians with a ferocity at least equal to that aimed at Pauker, 
and for the same reasons. Among the better known writers on In-
donesian developments, Ruth McVey has had comparatively little to 
say in print since October of 1965. She is said to be working on the 
definitive book concerning the coup and its denouncement, hopefully 
to establish the PKI's innocence of responsibility for the 30 Sep-
tember affair. It will be welcomed by the many scholars who share her 
views and who look with disdain upon the opinions of Guy Pauker

and Arnold Brackman, both of whom are working on books of their 
own on the same issue, and who maybe presumed to reflect a pro-
Army bias. 
This academic skirmishing might perhaps be safely ignored were it 
not for the difficulty in which it leaves the informed reader who has 
no access to classified material, as well as the serious student of Asian 
history and politics who seeks to evaluate the Indonesian upheaval of 
1965-66. Of the two, the man in the street who reads books is in the 
more advantageous position. He now has Robert Shaplen's Time Out 
of Hand: Revolution and Reaction in Southeast Asia (Harper and 
Row, 1969), most of which also appeared in The New Yorker (Is-
sues of November 23, 1968, May 24 and May 31, 1969). Shaplen does 
an excellent job of making a complex subject readable. It is clear that 
he has been briefed in great detail by Indonesian military sources and, 
not impossibly, by US officials conversant with the same material, 
covering events up to late 1968. The latter point is of particular in-
terest because Shaplen is thus able to draw upon information of quite 
recent vintage, which he exploits to great effect in asserting the 'com-
plicity and responsibility of former President Sukarno. He does this in 
sharper terms than Mrs. Hunter has seen fit to adopt, notwithstand-
ing her vastly more detailed and incisive analysis of Sukarno's 
role. In both, the key element is the testimony of Brigadier General 
Sugandhi (Sukarno's Minister of Information), the details of which 
were not known until comparatively recently, and then only through 
clandestine channels. It is difficult to take the Sugandhi testimony 
at face value and sustain any doubt about Sukarno's intimate involve-
ment. 
One curious feature of Shaplen's otherwise extremely well-informed 
survey is his acceptance of the original story of the kidnapped gen-
erals' maltreatment at Lubang Buaya. Whether for purposes of dra-
matic heightening of his account or because he actually believes it, 
Shaplen holds to the tale of torture and multilation of the generals 
by frenzied Communist women. The story is untrue, although in the 
early days following the coup attempt it was bruited around widely 
and given general credence. Apart from this, Shaplen's observations are 
strikingly consistent with Mrs. Hunter's. The similarity is in fact so de-
tailed that one is led to wonder whether or not Shaplen was given 
access to the classified account. 
On balance, The Coup that Backfired constitutes a unique contri-
bution to intelligence annals. It is regrettable that an analysis of corn-

parable quality is not overtly available to serious students of Indo-
nesian affairs. While Pauker and Brackman may in time produce books 
capable of dealing frontally with the proponents of the Cornell thesis, 
it is doubtful that either version will match The Coup that Backfired 
in depth or scope. At some future date it might therefore be well to 
reconsider the possibility of declassification. Until that occurs, MTS. 
Hunter's study must remain the province of a somewhat limited pro-
fessional audience, much of it already entertaining preconceived views 
of what the 30 September Movement was all about. As one of the 
worst offenders in the latter respect, this writer is now happy to claim 
a clearer perspective and even stronger convictions on the how and 
why of that event. 
Let it first be noted that the year 1965 saw the Indonesian Com-
munist Party embark on a collision course with the Army. The gauntlet 
was thrown down brazenly by Chairman Aidit in January when he be-
gan to press for NASAKOM-ization of the armed forces.2 This was 
followed not long afterward by a proposal made to President Sukarno 
for arming the peasants and workers, the so-called Fifth Force. The 
initiative was Aidifs, and it contrasted sharply with the apparent 
passivity of the Army leadership. Sukarno's initial response was some-
what diffident. He purported to be unimpressed, made occasional am-
bivalent observations on the subject, but avoided commitment. As the 
weeks wore on, however, he displayed increasing signs of interest in 
the Aidit proposals, and the Army was not slow to take the hint. Major 
General Mokoginta, Panglima of the North Sumatra Regional Com-
mand and anything but pro-Communist, began training local militia?
i.e., peasants and workers?in what he described as anticipation of 
President Sukarno's forthcoming instructions. 
The point is that there was nothing in the posture or behavior of 
the Army leadership during those critical months to suggest concerted 
initiative, whether in the form of resistance to Sukarno's domination 
or in active response to the PKI challenge. The existence of the Gen-
erals' Council is said to date from that period, but the testimony of 
the coup principals and other Sukarno supporters is extremely vague 
as to where the idea originated. In any event, out of it came the story 
NASAKOM is the acronym representing Sukarno's basic concept of the State, 
predicated on representation and participation by the key elements of Indonesian 
society?the Nationalists, those of religious persuasion ( i.e., Islamic), and the Com-
munists. NASAKOM-ization of the Armed Forces would have entailed full Com-
munist participation in command and administration.

of the generals' plot to take over the government, which subsequently 
served as the ostensible basis for planning and implementation of the 
30 September Movement. While the charge of coup plotting can be 
dismissed as without foundation, the idea of a secret grouping of gen-
eral officers had some basis in fact. In approximately January, 1965, 
a number of generals closely associated with Army Commander Gen-
eral Yani began to meet with some regularity to discuss a variety of 
problems facing the Army. I on the delib-
erations of this group, described colloquially by its members as the 
"brain trust," reflected an acute concern on their part with what all 
recognized as a determined PKI effort to force them to the wall. The 
group included Generals Suprapto, Harjono, Parman, Sukendro, and 
Sutojo, all of whom, with the exception of Sukendro, were killed on 
1 October. Most of the officers were official members of the Army 
General Staff, and in that capacity they had every reason to meet 
regularly. None was a commander of troops, without which no coup 
attempt could be successful. Over and above these considerations, 
to argue that the brain trust was at least 'construable as a conspira-
torial body, while it has a certain plausibility, is to ignore the basic 
fact of life prevailing in the first nine months of 1965, namely, that 
the morale and political 'outlook of the army leadership at that period 
were so bad, and its leadership so divided and at odds with other 
elements of the armed forces, as to render it incapable of pursuing 
an adventurous course of action. 
A flurry of concern unquestionably developed in midsummer over 
Sukarno's health. But it cannot be shown for certain that it did any-
thing more than stimulate the basic drift of events already under way, 
which, however one chooses to read the signs, represented a syste-
matic effort on the part of President Sukarno and his principal con-
stituents to neutralize any capacity for independent action that the 
army may have possessed. The role of President Sukarno during that 
phase of the development has been variously interpreted. In attempt-
ing to reconstruct it following the coup,  gen-
erally saw the President as a witting and willing participant, and to 
some extent swept along under pressure from the Aidit and probably 
the Subandrio forces. His role as we saw it was to provide 'authority 
and legality for the action undertaken and to provide insurance against 
failure. 
Today Sukamo's role ?stands Out in much bolder relief. The im-
pressive testimony of key communist members of the conspiracy, plus

new reporting from Army sources showing extensive involvement in 
the 30 September Affair on the part of important military figures 
previously thought to be above suspicion, offer an image of Sukarno 
as a prime mover, a dominant force in the enterprise. In retrospect, 
there is no other satisfactory explanation for the dynamics of the year 
1965. Without Sukarno as an active sponsor, the PKI would never have 
embarked on its collision course with the army. It is almost incon-
ceivable that Subandrio, regardless of his dreams of ultimate succes-
sion to the presidency, would have moved ahead of his master. The 
same applies to Air Force Marshal Omar Dani. The cleavages within 
the armed forces were indeed real; but only under Sukarno's active 
instigation would senior non-Communist military leaders have dared 
to participate in a violent move against their colleagues in the top 
army command. 
Why would Sukarno have seen fit to accelerate a process already 
going well under his full control? Perhaps he was simply in a hurry. 
The Indonesian revolution was no ball of fire. After twenty turbulent 
years its energies had flagged. Sukarno may have taken his cue from 
Mao Tse-tung. Certainly, had the coup succeeded, there would have 
been Red Guards aplenty to scour the archipelago in a massive purge 
of counterrevolutionaries. 
Why did the coup fail? The answer is simple according to the basic 
tvayang motif: The wicked giant, supported by witches from the for-
est, tried to seize the kingdom; but ?the good prince, in alliance 
with friendly gods, prevailed. The triumph of good over evil. Some 
say that the coup wag poorly planned and badly executed. By West-
ern standards, that may be so. Yet, notwithstanding its short and futile 
life, the coup failed by a hair's breadth. The pivotal factor was prob-
ably the killing of the generals. Had they not been killed, but merely 
sequestered, and thus in Indonesian style eliminated from public life, 
the coup would almost certainly have been carried off successfully. 
Conversely, if the Untung forces in accordance with the plan had suc-
ceeded in killing all the generals, the operation would probably have 
accomplished its objective. Nasution's survival not only frustrated the 
plotters and shattered their composure. More importantly, it provided 
a continuity of authority within the Army and lent moral assurance 
to Suharto in the critical early hours. Success might still have been 
achieved in the face of Nasution's survival had Sukarno himself not 
lost his nerve. Instead of holing up at Halim Air Base for twelve 
critical hours, the President's logical move would have been to return

of the grim reality staring them in the face. Yani and his strongest 
officers were gone, presumably dead. Whatever the name of the game

himself together it was too late. The Suharto/Nasution duuravirate 
was firmly established and the transition had begun.

INTELLIGENCE IN RECENT PUBLIC LITERATURE 
POWER IN THE KREMLIN. By Michel Tatu. (London: Collins, 
1969. 570 pp.) 
Looking back, one finds it a little hard to tell now whether the 
figure of Khrushchev looms so large in our memories because his suc-
cessors somehow seem so small or because he was in fact a man of 
considerable political 'stature. Whatever the, truth of the matter, the 
years from roughly 1957 to 1964 were certainly lively ones on the in-
ternational scene, and we can thank Khrushchev for some of our most 
anxious and entertaining moments. Bu i now along .comes Michel Tatu, 
a Frenchman who spent most of these same years in Moscow watch-
ing the Kremlin at close range, and we can thank him (among others) 
for the news that while Khrushchev was so busy bedeviling his ene-
mies abroad, his opponents at home were just about as busy bedevil-
ing him! 
Tatu's book, Power in the Kremlin, From Khrushchev to Kosygin, 
is an unabashed exercise in Kremlin?logy. As one reviewer has already 
observed, moreover, it is Kremlin?logy at its best. And it may be more 
than that: it may indeed be the best Kremlin?logy, i.e., one of the best 
single works ever written about domestic Soviet politics. This book 
does for the political scene in the USSR?in particular, the "Unmaking 
of a First Secretary"?approximately what the first of The Making of 
the President series does for the American, a feat all the more remark-
able because Tatu, quite unlike White, had no real access to Soviet 
leaders and no entree into the closed, murky world of Soviet politics. 
I praise this work highly in full awareness that its author is a com-
petitor of sorts, as well as a colleague. And I should mention that 
William Hyland, co-author of The Fall of Khrushchev, 'a shorter work 
which covers some of .the same territory, and which, alas, was pub-
lished at about the same time, perhaps would not agree with me. But 
I also praise it because I wish to make clear at the outset that Tofu's 
volume is an excellent study and?as we say in the trade?should 
be must-reading for all students of the Soviet scene. But this is a serious 
book and it deserves a serious critical review. 
Power in the Kremlin ( a crisp and apt title) surveys its subject 
under five major headings: The U-2 Affair and Its Consequences, The 
22nd Party Congress, The Cuban Fiasco, The Fall, and The Collective

Leadership on its Own. Emphasis in the first three of these sections 
is placed on the struggle of Khrushchev's opponents to resist his poli-
cies and to restrict his powers and, in the fourth section, on their ulti-
mately successful efforts to remove him from office. Thus, for exam-
ple, in the discussion of the U-2 incident, Tatu makes the point that 
it "played a decisive role in the reversal of Soviet policy," and in ad-
dition, helped to lead to the formation of an informal but effective 
anti-Khrushchev coalition (including Kozlov and Suslov) among 
Khrushchev's top colleagues. The fifth section concerns itself with the 
post-Khrushchev collection and is much less interesting than the 
others. 
It does not really matter that most of Tatu's central theses are 
familiar and that a fair amount of what he has to say concerns pre-
viously explored territory. His notions about the domestic political 
impact of the U-2 affair, for example, coincide quite nicely with simi-
lar sentiments expressed earlier in Karl Linden's book, Khrushchev 
and the Soviet Leadership 1957-1964, which deals essentially with the 
same period. But Tatu arrived at his conclusions independently of 
Linden, and indeed Linden's ideas were by no means unique when 
they first appeared. Moreover, it should be recalled that Tatu did 
not wait until the publication of Power in the Kremlin to reach judg-
ment. He did so, in fact, as the events were actually taking place, 
both in Le Monde and in conversation with Western diplomats in 
Moscow (including US diplomats). He thus helped at the time to 
shape everyone's ideas about politics in the Kremlin, including those 
of intelligence analysts in Washington (this one included). In any 
case, the validity of Tatu's examination and the importance of his 
ideas does not rest on when they appeared or, for that matter, on 
their originality. 
Tatu's theme is grand, but along the way he by no means neglects 
small but nonetheless illuminating episodes. He reminds us, or tells 
us for the first time, of some fascinating incidents. As late as 6 May 
1960, for example, after the U-2 had been brought down, Khrushchev 
publicly reasserted his oft-repeated belief in the sincere desire of 
President Eisenhower for peace. But later in the same month, a 
spokesman for conservative interests in the CPSU had this to say: 
-Yes, we wanted to believe Eisenhower, we wanted to believe him for the 
sake of peace on earth . . . But unlike certain simple-minded persons, we 
were not exactly moved to enthusiasm by the President's foggy, evasive state-
ments." (reviewer's emphasis)

"In order to appreciate the outrageousness of such statements," com-
ments Tatu, "it should be noted that the Chinese themselves went no 
further in their criticism of Khrushchev at the time, and occasionally 
used the same words." 
Tatu also occasionally throws out an interesting and provocative 
question which he leaves the reader to answer for himself. Sometimes 
these questions are rather startling in their implications. He asks, for 
example, whether the Berlin crisis of 1961 brought about the subse-
quent increase in Soviet military expenditures, or whether, conversely, 
the need of the military to strengthen the armed forces brought about 
the crisis. 
As is perhaps already evident, Tatu's work is not for those who like 
their political analysis in the manner of Mary Barelli Gallagher or who ? 
are seeking a light summer entertainment. It is overly long, and will 
surely tell most readers more than they want to know. And, almost as 
if he could not bear to discard notes he had made during the event, 
Tatu sometimes overburdens his account with detail which seems 
irrelevant and inconclusive. 
A more serious charge is that, to paraphrase the clich?Tatu ne-
glects (although he does not completely ignore) the forest for the 
trees. As indicated, many of the trees which he studies with such en-
thusiasm are simply of little account as timber. The part of the forest 
most neglected is, not surprisingly in a book of this character and in-
tent, foreign policy. But Tatu overdoes it; he tends to regard interna-
tional problems almost wholly in a domestic light. The following sen-
tence, for instance, strikes me at least as decidedly odd: "Nothing else 
of any significance was in fact touched on kat the Congress) apart 
from the Albanian and Chinese problem, which was only a form of 
the struggle for power projected on to the international scene. . ." (re-
viewer's emphasis.) 
A part of the problem is that, as described by Tatu, there is a certain 
lack of connective tissue between events, especially international 
events. Links between domestic and foreign events are too often simply 
referred to in passing, if at all. Thus, for example, in the sections deal-
ing with Khrushchev's difficulties during the winter of 1963, there 
are few references to Soviet foreign policy. This is important for several 
reasons, but notably because developments in this area clearly rein-
force Tatu's thesis that Khrushchev's policies?e.g., de-Stalinization 
and economic reform?were in trouble. There was a close parallel be-

tween Khrushchev's internal setbacks and what was happening to his 
principal foreign policies. These too, were running into effective op-
position. Clearly, the conservatives led by Kozlov wished to retrench 
abroad as well as at home. It will be recalled, for example, that Khru-
shchev's interest in a nuclear test ban treaty, strongly expressed in the 
immediate aftermath of the Cuban missile 'crisis, came to naught until 
he was able to pick up the thread again in June, after his defeat of the 
conservatives. 
In a larger sense, a similar fault can be discovered in Tatu's treat-
ment of the missile crisis itself. The period leading up to that crisis 
is covered in some detail on the home front ( though perhaps inade-
quately explored on the international scene). But since he attributes 
almost everything to the lure of Berlin, Tatu tends to neglect the two 
principal Soviet motives in the affair: Khrushchev's desire to overcome 
US strategic superiority and to damage US prestige; and his more per-
sonal, though equally important wish to improve his own position. 
Tatu does not discuss in this context the whole discouraging pattern 
of events, domestic and foreign, in the two years preceding Cuba. He 
thus does not explore the notion that the Cuban gamble reflected 
Khrushchev's extreme frustration and even desperation, that in fact 
Khrushchev was impelled by his failures on both the internal and in-
ternational fronts, and that he sought in this way to recover lost mo-
mentum abroad and to forestall his ouster at home. 
It may be an occupational fault of Kremlinologists and Kremlinology 
to neglect, relatively speaking, the international scene and its impact 
on Soviet politics. This is perhaps not surprising, given the rigors and 
necessary emphases of the art. There is also the matter of time. Tartu 
admits that Kremlinology must grope, and that takes time, a lot of it. 
Precious little may be left for explorations of the foreign field, except 
insofar as it may seem to intrude on the convoluted world of internal 
Soviet politics. In any case, few practicioners seem very much con-
cerned with the need for looking very far beyond the walls of the 
Kremlin itself. 
The importance of this work does not lie, however, in the marginalia 
mentioned above. And it was admittedly not Tatu's purpose to pro-
vide us with a full account of Khrushchev's foreign policies. The signifi-
cance of the book is twofold: it is the most thorough and persuasive 
account yet of the nature of Soviet politics during the Khrushchev 
era?an era described at the time by many Kremlinologists (includ-

ing many within the US Government) as politically placid and lack-
Mg in high-level contention; and it is as such the one account most 
likely to make an impression, even indirectly, on those in the West 
whose business it is to respond to and contend with the Soviet chal-
lenge. In Tofu's words: "No policy of relations with Moscow can be 
planned intelligently without regard to the capital question of how it 
affects the struggle for influence at the top level of the Soviet Union. 
For this purpose, the symptoms of that struggle which are visible to 
the outside world must be taken seriously however slight they may 
seem."

WESTERN ECONOMIC WARFARE, 1947-1967: By Gunnar Adler-
Karlsson. (Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell. 1968. 319 pp. 64 Sw.-kr.) 
This book is an analysis of the postwar trade control programs of 
the US and its allies against the USSR and other Communist coun-
tries. The major portion of the book is devoted to the historical de-
velopment of the trade control programs. The most interesting por-
tion, however, is the evaluation of the impact of the controls and the 
judgment that these failed overwhelmingly to achieve their objectives. 
The author's argument is well documented, but his conclusions are 
overstated and need to be substantially qualified. 
Controls on exports to the Communist world have been with us for 
two decades. The two chief systems of export controls applicable to the 
Communist countries are the unilateral controls based on the US Ex-
port Control Act of 1949; and the multilateral controls administered 
since 1949-50 in cooperation with our European allies and japan 
under the aegis of the Coordinating Committee (COCOM). These 
two sets of controls, designed principally to delay and complicate the 
ability of the USSR (along with the Warsaw Pact countries and Com-
munist China) to ,augument its military potential, were adopted 
during the height of the cold war. 
The scope of both lists has been reduced and interpretation of con-
trols has been liberalized over time; nevertheless, there has been con-
siderable friction between the US and its allies over what should be 
exported to the Communist world. In the early postwar period when 
our allies were economically dependent on the US, when Stalin was 
molding his "closed" economic bloc, and during the Korean war, there

was closer official adherence by the allies to the stricter US inter-
pretations. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the Korean armistice, 
and the growing economic recovery in Europe which produced compe-
tition for foreign markets, there was pressure in COCOM for a re-
laxation of trade controls. 
All COCOM countries, including the US, are in general agreement 
concerning the embargo of items on the international Munitions and 
Atomic Energy lists, but broad disagreements exist on the COCOM 
International List I, where items have both civilian and military uses. 
The COCOM International List I is the lowest common denominator 
for export controls, and any participating country is free to apply a 
higher level of controls. US controls are wider in scope and more vig-
orously enforced than those of Western Europe and Japan, because 
the US is more inclined to look on the Communist countries as posing 
a strategic threat, while other Western countries tend to regard the 
Communist countries as a vast potential marketewhich must be ex-
ploited before US competition makes it impossible to do so. 
It is Mr. Karlsson's purpose, he says, to look at the history of this 
"embargo" policy "reluctantly adopted by the West European govern-
ments.. . to analyze both the political forces which created the policy, 
and the economic effects which it may have had on East-West trade 
and on the balance of power between the Communist bloc and its 
Western adversaries." The generous proportions of his book testify to 
the fact that he approached his task with a vengeance. The 8"x101/2" 
volume has more than 200 double-columned pages liberally interlarded 
with diagrams and tables; there are more than 1,000 source refer-
ences and footnotes (many rather long and fortunately relegated to 
the back of the book), and more than 50 pages of trade statistics in 
the appendix. Ostensibly the author also consulted numerous sources 
in his research, including more than 100 periodicals in a half-dozen 
languages. His bibliography includes about 200 authors?from the 
best known experts on the Soviet economy to numerous lesser lumi-
naries. 
The history of the controls programs, which takes up roughly half 
of the book (all or major portions of chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10), 
is the strongest part of the book. The obvious painstaking research 
using unclassified materials has resulted in a well-documented unclas-
sified history of the trade controls program. Those of us who have ac-
cess to classified sources and particularly those who at least are gen-

orally aware of the trade controls program and some of its history 
might question the utility of Mr. Karlsson's monumental effort. The 
book's chief distinction would appear to be its encyclopedic proper-
tions rather than any new contributions or insights into the question 
of the merits or lack thereof of the trade controls prop-am. Our col-
leagues in academia, however, who are not privy to classified mate-
rials, may well regard Karlsson's book as a major contribution to the 
literature on Western export controls, particularly its historical de-
velopment. This is not to say, however, that some of the motives and 
reasoning for various trade controls actions that he attributes to policy 
makers are necessarily true. Thus, there is some reason to doubt that 
during the period 1947-53 American leaders "had no vision of peace 
beyond the collapse or defeat of Soviet power . . . and that the Ameri-
cans hoped to achieve a collapse after which the Russians would come 
and beg for renewed trade relations, now on American conditions." 
(pp. 88-89). 
The theme which runs throughout the book is that the embargo 
policy, which Karlsson says was instigated by the US and perpetrated 
on its allies over the last two decades, has been futile; that numerous 
diversions have undermined the controls; that the embargo has caused 
considerable ill feeling among our allies; that depriving the Commu-
nist countries of Western goods helped Stalin consolidate his Eastern 
European domain, promoted autarky, and affected development of 
East-West trade up to 1953; that the costs imposed on the USSR by the 
denial of certain goods were negligible; and finally that it failed to af-
fect perceptibly the growth of the Soviet economy and Soviet military 
power. The book, in fact, is an almost unrelieved indictment of the 
Western trade controls programs allegedly nurtured by the United 
States and foisted on our hapless allies in the early postwar period. 
It is certainly true that there have been many diversions. This fact 
has been well documented in classified and unclassified sources. It is 
also true that much ill will has been generated because of trade con-
trols. However, it is highly debatable that Western trade controls 
were more than marginally influential in fostering the creation of 
Stalin's economic bloc in the East. As to the development of East-West 
trade up to 1953, we can only be sure that trade controls had a major 
impact on US trade with the Communist world. Commodity scarcities 
pursuant to the Korean conflict, inward direction of trade among the 
USSR and Eastern European countries, and the liberalization of trade

among Western European countries all played a role in the stagna-
tion of trade between East and West at that time. 
Karlsson's thesis that controls have had little impact on Soviet eco-
nomic growth is based on a comparison of "non-realized imports" (the 
difference between actual imports from the West and the estimated 
value of imports in the absence of controls) with Soviet GNP. This, 
he says, would have affected only one-tenth to one-half of one percent 
of GNP during the height of the embargo period (pp. 189-90). He 
states that the bottleneck effects of the embargo restrictions may have 
affected a greater share of the economy and that an exaggerated esti-
mate might be a slowdown in growth from the "potential 8 percent to 
the actual 7 percent" during the 1950's. Based on "these exaggerated 
assumptions" the effects of the embargo policy would have been to re-
tard economic development during the decade of the 1950's by one 
year. 
A study undertaken in the intelligence community several years 
ago confirmed the thesis that controls have had little impact on growth. 
It concluded that a complete embargo by NATO would have caused, 
under generous assumptions of impact, the equivalent to the loss of 
only a few months' increment to output in the USSR and Eastern 
Europe. It has not been possible, moreover, to identify any of the items 
imported from the COCOM countries by the USSR and Eastern Eu-
rope for which there would be no possible substitute. 
The principal justification for export controls for many years has 
been their contribution to or maintenance of the technological lag in 
the USSR. It is in this area that Karlsson's arguments are weakest. 
The denial of some goods undoubtedly has had an impact on those 
economic capabilities that lie at the edge of advancing technology. In 
this sense, the quality of Soviet economic growth must be inferior to 
what it would be otherwise. The current pattern of trade controls is 
aimed primarily at those goods whose technology the USSR has had the 
most difficulty mastering. 
The technological gap between the USSR and the developed West 
is large and is probably widening, as a recent classified study inch-
cates. This statement is at odds with Karlsson's evaluation of Soviet 
technological prowess, which he attributes in part to the "efficient 
organization of R & D work" there (p. 124). On the contrary, he 
sees little point in controlling exports of technology to the USSR, other 
than those clearly possessing strategic significance. Karlsson's argu-

ments seem to be derived mainly from statements made in the 
Gaither report in 1958 regarding the rapid pace of Soviet military 
development (p. 123). Indeed, the USSR has achieved near-parity 
with the US in technology for producing many types of weapons 
and space equipment, and even superiority in a few areas. Soviet 
priorities, however, have favored the military sector. According to 
the above-mentioned report, second priority has been given to the 
basic industries whose output directly supports both military produc-
tion and the investment programs essential to rapid growth--steel, 
fuels, electric power, producers' equipment, and more recently, chem-
icals. The bulk of the output of these industries is produced with tech-
nology obsolescent by a number of years relative to that predomi-
nantly in use in the West; e.g., technology for producing computers, 
peripheral equipment, and solid-state electronic components (a 5-
year lag and widening); the Soviet technological composition of 
machine tools is inferior because of its poor quality and preponder-
ance of general-purpose tools; production technology and product 
mix of the Soviet automotive and tractor industry are obsolescent; 
all aspects of Soviet petroleum technology lags well behind the US 
as does much of Soviet chemical technology. 
Contrary to Karlsson's evaluation of the efficiency of Soviet II & D, 
the technological gap exists and is largely due to the Soviet system 
of planning and economic administration which retards innovation. 
The importation by the Soviets of Western technology and equipment 
valued in billions of dollars during the 196(Ss has been designed to 
help overcome this gap. The denial of key advanced Western tech-
nology and equipment via export controls, moreover, has contributed 
td the technological lag. The lag is in some degree attributable to the 
US unilateral trade program because a substantial amount of key 
advanced Western technology is covered by US patents and licenses. 
The relaxation of Western controls undoubtedly would lead to 
changes in the ,composition of Communist imports from the West. 
Such imports would feature equipment and technology for priority 
sectors where the lag is greatest, e.g., computers, microelectronics, 
petroleum refining and exploration, metal finishing, thermal power, 
and certain chemicals. The contribution that such imports would make 
to Communist economic growth is, of course, unquantifiable. In-
directly, such imports would help to improve the general economic

performance of the USSR and Eastern Europe and, thus, would 
make it possible for them to allocate more resources to military pro-
duction than otherwise would be the case. Some of these items, com-
puters, for example, have military as well as civil uses and, thus, would 
directly strengthen the Soviet strategic/military posture. 
As noted above, denial of strategic goods for two decades did not 
prevent the USSR from building a formidable military establishment 
at home as well as in Eastern Europe. The military sector is the first 
claimant of goods and services in these countries. Denial of Western 
technology and equipment, therefore, has had minimal impact on the 
size of Soviet military programs. On the other hand, the denial of 
Western technology and equipment probably has increased the costs 
and reduced the effectiveness of Soviet military programs, and delayed 
development and deployment of some weapons systems. Technolog-
ical lags appear to have been absorbed in Soviet military systems at 
a cost of reduced effectiveness, e.g., through weight penalties in 
aircraft; more cumbersome command, support, and communications 
systems; limited flexibility; and reduced reliability. 
Controls in the past decade probably have retarded Soviet produc-
tion technology in semiconductors and other electronic components 
by denying access to silicon and germanium metals, the processing 
machinery for these metals, and transistor and diode production lines. 
This delay, in turn, has probably contributed to present lags in digital 
computer production technology, which has remained embargoed. 
The Soviet lag in production technology for large high-speed com-
puters probably would be a constraining factor in the size and pace 
of deployment of a nation-wide ABM system. The US lead in de-
veloping a MIRV system may also be attributable in part to computer 
superiority. Optimal nuclear warhead design requires large com-
puter capacity. 
The current Soviet lag in the field of microelectronics contributes 
to computer deficiencies. The USSR does not yet produce integrated 
circuits on a commercial scale. Failure to acquire adequate supplies 
?of integrated circuits may retard the deployment of on-board missile 
guidance packages and reduce the accuracy of missiles. In the general 
field of military applications, unrestricted access to Western micro-
electronic components and/or technology would enable the USSR to

replace existing Soviet-made components in a wide variety of military 
gear with smaller, lighter, and more reliable Western components. 
The quantity, quality, and variety of Communist output of telecom-
munications equipment falls far short of meeting Communist require-
ments. As the USSR increases its investment in sophisticated weapons 
systems, such as ABM and offensive missile systems, increasing re-
quirements will be generated for a wide variety of telecommunica-
tions systems for strategic application. Included among these systems 
are hardened communications facilities in target areas, under 
ground control links for hardened missile sites, automated nation-
wide command and control functions, and facilities for rapid and 
secure data and voice transmission. The USSR's capability in the 
telecommunications techniques needed to satisfy these requirements 
is deficient, and numerous attempts to acquire Western technology 
and equipment have been made in recent years. The lack of adequate 
high-rate data transmission equipment in particular is a serious 
hindrance to the deployment of an ABM system, which requires an 
intricate network of communications facilities, connecting radars, 
computers, command and control centers, and defensive missiles. 
The impact of US and Western trade controls on the USSR and 
other Communist countries has been less than originally hoped for. 
However, they were never intended to bring the USSR to its knees, as 
implied by Karlsson. They have not slowed Soviet economic growth 
noticeably in the past but they have contributed to the technological 
lag which is the major factor in the current economic slowdown. 
The have not prevented the USSR from becoming a formidable 
military power, but they have denied it equipment and technology 
which would have upgraded some weapons systems, and in any 
case probably have helped delay the deployment of certain weapons 
systems. What this has meant in terms of costs to the Communist 
world cannot be quantified. The costs to the Western alliance, par-
ticularly with respect to the loss of political capital by the US, should 
be weighed in the balance, of course. The viewpoints of our Western 
allies in assessing the strategic significance of exports relative to com-
mercial gains are different from that of the US. Protected by the US

ASSASSINATION BUREAU, INC. By L. Natarajanan. (New Delhi: 
Perspective Publications, 1967.) 
This book is a lurid account of five political assassinations in Asia 
during the past twenty years. It is a reprint of articles previously 
serialized in the nominally independent Indian leftist weekly, Main-
stream (circulation, 4,000). It cannot be treated as a serious work. 
What we can discern of the motives behind such a publication may, 
however, he of some interest. 
L. Natarajanan is a pen name of Nikil Chakravarty, an Indian 
Communist Party member for more than 30 years. An Oxford Uni-
versity student in the 30's, when he joined the British Communist 
Party, he had personal acquaintances among India League and 
Congress Party leaders that have stood him in good stead over the 
years. The first fifteen years of his party work were devoted to "com-
bining legal and illegal activity"; he was a party journalist and, when 
occasion demanded, a wartime member and later (1948-50) a leader 
of the clandestine technical apparatus of the CPI, under various aliases. 
From 1952, when he wrote American Shadow over India for the 
party press, his career followed a different course. Aligned with 
Ajoy Ghosh, the new Secretary-General of the party, he was used in 
party contacts with Soviet Bloc embassies, and eventually became 
head of the India Press Agency, a Communist Party "news" outlet 
created with Soviet financial backing. After Ghosh's death he moved 
away from open association with the party but strengthened his rela-
tions with the Soviets, who also financed the establishment of Main-
stream. At one point in 1959-60, it was reported that he was taking 
on "counterintelligence duties" with Americans as his target, when 
the party took new steps to create a secret mechanism. What is known 
is that he has for 'several years published numerous articles on CIA 
in Asia in various outlets, virtually all of them elaborate fabrications. 
The first case treated is the assassination in 1947 of General Aung 
San, the leader of the nationalist Executive Council that governed 
Burma in the first post-World War II period, and the subsequent 
execution of the organizer of his assassination, U Saw. The second is 
the murder in 1949 in South Korea of Kim Koo, a leading political 
opponent of then President Syngman Rhee, and the third the shooting 
in 1951 of Liaquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan. The last two 
cases are those of Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike who met

violent death at the hands of two Buddhist monks in September 1959, 
and of the Japanese Socialist Party leader Asanuma, stabbed at a pre-
electoral meeting in September 1960. 
Soviet apologists and agents of influence have special problems 
in dealing with the question of political assassination. One difficulty 
is, as Khoklov and other Soviet defectors have stated, that the USSR 
has resorted to assassination for many years, although mainly of 
political ,oppositionists who fled from Soviet territory. In this book 
the author addresses another problem, the fact that not all victims 
of political assassination operations attributed to the imperialists can 
be identified as simonpure fighters against capitalism and imperialism. 
The central idea appears to be that the British and the Americans 
use political assassination against erstwhile puppets, a theme which 
is consistent with Soviet efforts in the CENTO, SEATO, and OAS 
treaty areas to drive wedges between the US and cooperating political 
leaders. In the Burmese case, it is U Saw, the organizer of the assas-
sination of Aung San, who is betrayed by his masters. An interesting 
sidelight in this case is the fact that the Soviet Union, in its attack in 
early 1969 on the Chinese and their Southeast Asian puppets, 
claimed Aung San as the leader of the "good" Burmese Communists 
at the end of World War II, whose death made it possible for 
Maoist sectarians to break up the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom 
League, thus playing into the hands of the imperialist enemy. 
In the Korean case, the Americans are cast as the villains behind 
both the elimination of Syngman Rhee and the death of his opponent, 
Kim Koo. The idea that no Korean should trust the US is reiterated. 
The stream-of-consciousness account of Syngman Rhee's thoughts sug-
gests that the author of the piece?Indian or Soviet?has found a 
way of communicating with the spirit world. 
The Pakistani case is built around a supplementary theme used in 
Soviet wedge-driving?that the British and Americans will use any 
means necessary against each other in their struggle for colonialist 
hegemony, and that their failures to expose each other's crimes arise 
in the last 'analysis from the fact that they are tied together by their 
crimes. Apparently the person who inspired this piece believes in the 
validity of the old Nechayev principle of conspiracy, that the best way 
of making a fellow conspirator reliable is to lead him to commit a crime 
and to hold the knowledge of his guilt over his head.

The case of "Sword" (S.W.R.D.) Bandaranaike, again suggests the 
theme that a collaborator will be liquidated if he begins to see the 
error of his ways and to move away from his subordination to the 
imperialists. Again Anglo-American mutual jealousy and mistrust is 
woven into the story along with the idea that an agent shared between 
the two may be the local villain of the piece. 
In the Japanese case, which in one or two places also suggests either 
spirit-world sources or a penetration in the US Embassy in Tokyo, 
the book again plays on the theme of an assassination as a sequel to 
an unsuccessful American effort to influence a political group, in 
this instance, the Socialist Party of Japan. 
Neither the "facts" presented, the professional ability of the writer, 
nor the interpretive analysis of why these assassinations were neces-
sary to the US and Britian are likely to have impact even in India. 
They are, however, useful for Indian Communists who need a ration-
alization that can be acceptable from a Marxist-Leninist point of 
view for the fact that the opponent they condemned yesterday as an 
imperialist puppet may be today's forgotten man, as far as the "im-
perialist beast" is concerned. Some erstwhile friends of the West in 
South Asia who turn against the US or Great Britian also may find 
the stories handy polemic aids when they cannot frankly explain 
to their associates why they have turned toward the USSR.
