 Key Judgments China's foreign policy has long been a complicated brew of realpolitik,
 Information available xenophobic nationalism, and economic calculation. Security considerations
 as of 15 June 1983 have been the primary force shaping China's foreign policy, but there have

 been periods, such as the early 1950s, when the PRC's need for economic
 ties abroad have been an influential factor.-The bitter experience with the
 Soviet Union, however, convinced the Chinese that they must avoid
 becoming economically reliant on any one country and accounts for
 Beijing's current efforts to spread its trade and investment relations over a
 broad range of Western countries.
 We believe the importance of economic factors in China's foreign policy is
 likely to increase substantially over the coming decade as trade, foreign
 investment, and other commercial relationships with the outside world
 expand. Some of these arrangements would be vulnerable if Beijing's
 domestic politics shift radically in a post-Deng era. New economic
 challenges, however, are emerging that should make commercial dealings
 with the West more imperative for the Chinese-particularly for export
 markets, as a source of advanced technology, and for assistance in energy
 development.
 The Chinese may need Western help more than they currently anticipate.
 Beijing expects that its economy will grow during the latter half of the
 1980s at a rate approximating the 1952-77 average of 5.7 percent, but our
 calculations suggest that overall growth will have difficulty reaching 5
 percent. We believe China's energy shortage will become more acute with
 oil production starting to decline by 1985. Moreover, the Chinese seem to
 be overestimating their ability to conserve energy in the future.
 As these constraints become increasingly evident to Chinese economic   25X1
 planners over the next two to three years, it will reinforce the leadership's
 decision for Western companies to be deeply involved in energy develop-
 ment, particularly offshore oil.' US firms, which are world leaders in
 offshore drilling as well as surface mining, would be in a strong position to
 broaden their involvement in China.                                   25X1
 ' This paper proceeds on the assumption that US companies will be significant participants
 in a commercially viable offshore oil program. ARCO has already begun exploration in the
 South China Sea, and US companies are participants in all consortiums still bidding on
 blocks.

 Over the next decade China's economy also will become more dependent
 on foreign trade. The Chinese recognize that without substantial industrial
 and infrastructure imports, capital productivity will continue to stagnate,
 retarding overall development. We believe that China is counting heavily
 on the US market and that the US share of Chinese exports may well dou-
 ble over the next decade. On the import side, the Chinese will be
 particularly in need of transportation, electronics, mining technologies, and
 grain from the United States.
 These economic stakes will work to reinforce moderation in Beijing's
 political dealings with the United States. Beijing will be increasingly
 sensitive to the possibility that its growing commercial equities with the
 United States could be jeopardized by a major imbroglio over US links
 with Taiwan. Specifically, we believe China will be less likely to exert
 heavy pressure on the United States to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan as
 long as these transfers avoid clear violation of the "quantity and quality"
 provisions of the 17 August 1982 communique. Such moderation will be
 particularly evident during the latter half of the 1980s, when Chinese
 dependence on US oil technology will peak.
 Nevertheless, in our view, there will be definite limits to US economic
 influence. For many influential Chinese, Taiwan's divided status remains
 an emotional issue, symbolizing their country's continuing subservience to
 Western power. If the Chinese perceive an unambiguous trend toward
 strengthened US defense or political ties with Taipei, they may well force a
 general retrogression in Sino-US relations and sacrifice important elements
 of their economic and technological ties. In a worst case scenario, we
 believe the Chinese have sufficient commercial options through Western
 Europe, Japan, and the USSR to enable their economy to weather a major
 reduction in US oil-production assistance and trade.

 China-United States:
 Political Implications of
 Growing Economic
 Interdependence F-1
 Over the past decade China's economic interdepend-
 ence with the world has reached unprecedented pro-
 portions. Foreign trade, primarily with the non-Com-
 munist world, has become more important to the
 country's economic growth than at any previous time
 in its history. In the early 1970s export earnings
 constituted only 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product
 (GDP), but within the decade this figure has more
 than doubled to nearly 7 percent. Western 2 technol-
 ogy and know-how have become key to China's
 development. Despite the economic retrenchment of
 the past three years, advanced technology imports by
 value now stand at more than 10 times their 1970
 level. The number of officially sponsored Chinese
 scholars sent to study abroad have gone from a mere
 with any other country. Close to 100 Chinese delega-
 tions, mostly scientific and technological, visit the
 United States every month, while officially sponsored
 students currently studying in the United States
 number over 5,000.3
 China's Commitment to Its Present Course
 China's economic opening to the West is driven by
 political as well as developmental considerations. The
 long-term threat from the Soviet Union remains a
 compelling reason for China to have the Western
 democracies participate in its economic development.
 Domestically, China's reform-minded leadership has
 built much of its political power base on a repudiation
 of the xenophobia fostered by Cultural Revolution
 radicals and on promises of a genuine economic
 takeoff by the 1990s.
 handful a decade ago to some 8,000.
 During the past four years, Beijing has turned to
 foreign investment-historically a symbol of exploita-
 tion-to increase its access to both technology and
 capital. So far over $1 billion has been invested in
 China by foreign firms. Perhaps most significantly,
 China is poised to conclude a number of long-term
 joint ventures with foreign energy companies that
 could result in undertakings valued in the tens of
 billions of dollars.
 The United States has played an important role in
 China's economic development-as a source of ad-
 vanced technology, agricultural products, and foreign
 exchange earnings. US-Chinese trade has risen from
 near zero in 1971 to $5 billion in 1982. Overall, the
 United States now ranks second as a source of imports
 and third as a market for China. A substantial
 amount of US-origin high technology has been ac-
 quired by the Chinese over the past several years,
 most prominently computers and aircraft. Beijing's
 scientific and technological exchange program with
 the United States is substantially larger than that
 We believe that China's economic interdependence
 with the West is likely to grow under Deng Xiaoping's
 political tutelage. Indeed, there are signs over the past
 year that the leadership consensus for the economic
 opening to the West is strengthening:
 ? China's recently released, long-term economic goals
 are predicated on a heavy infusion of foreign capital
 and technology.
 ? Media articles allegorically sniping at foreign in-
 volvement in China's modernization have dimin-
 ished markedly over the past year.
 ? In recent months Beijing has introduced a major
 liberalization of its economic regulations, facilitat-
 ing investment by foreigners and providing larger
 financial incentives.
 Although these trends are encouraging, a post-Deng
 leadership may not be as favorably disposed toward
 such substantial foreign involvement.

 some influential Chinese remain
 deeply troubled by what they regard as China's
 excessive dependence on the West and the negative
 cultural byproducts that have accompanied commer-
 cial ties. Deng's chosen successors, Hu Yaobang and
 Zhao Ziyang, will lack their mentor's broad power
 base and could find themselves having to make some
 concessions to these critics. A worst case scenario
 might envisage the Chinese leadership becoming in-
 creasingly xenophobic, yielding to an instinct that is a
 familiar part of the country's history.
 We believe, however, that the 1980s and 1990s will
 pose major economic challenges for China and sub-
 stantially lessen the likelihood of Beijing turning
 inward again. A continuing problem with energy
 supplies-despite new production in the South China
 Sea-and the country's increasing need for foreign
 trade to help underwrite economic growth should push
 Beijing toward greater economic interdependence
 with the West.

 China's Energy Bind-
 A Force for Interdependence
 China's most difficult economic problem during the
 next decade will be a continuing slowdown in the
 growth of domestic energy supplies. For several years
 insufficient energy output has been an important
 constraint on industrial production. Energy shortages
 will probably continue, particularly if heavy-industry
 growth rates continue to exceed plan targets
 Energy output is now growing at about 4 percent per
 year, almost all from coal. The outlook for other fuels
 is bleak-natural gas production has already fallen
 about 20 percent below its peak in 1979, and the
 critical oil sector is struggling to maintain production
 at its current level of 2 million b/d. We expect that
 China will face a decline in oil output by 1985. Recent
 studies by the World Bank conclude that China could
 become a net oil importer as early as 1985.

 Secret
 Over the past five years the Chinese have begun to
 appreciate more fully their energy squeeze and the
 difficulties of boosting domestic production. They
 have turned increasingly to the West for technology to
 spur development of energy supplies, while emphasiz-
 ing more stringent conservation practices at home.
 Since 1980 Beijing has allocated increased investment
 funds and designed new incentive programs to pro-
 mote energy savings. We believe the Chinese are
 aiming at a conservation rate that averages between
 3.5 and 4 percent per year over the next decade. The
 World Bank projects that China's long-run rate of
 energy conservation is, however, unlikely to exceed
 2 percent annually, while a recent forecast by Whar-
 ton Econometric Forecasting Associates concludes
 that annual gains in energy efficiency are likely to be
 in the 2.5- to 3-percent range for the rest of the
 century.
 Indeed, recent Chinese data indicate that the rate of
 energy savings is already slowing (see figure 1).' Early,
 relatively easy gains in efficiency wrung from China's
 outmoded industrial base must now be achieved
 through the costly acquisition of energy-efficient
 plants. Indeed, to sustain an average annual savings of
 3 percent through the 1990s-about the rate achieved
 by the technologically advanced and more investment-
 oriented Japanese economy since 1973-would proba-
 bly require more sustained purchases of capital equip-
 ment than are now planned.
 Even allowing a generous 3-percent-energy-savings
 rate, however, the Chinese may be surprised by the
 constraint that energy places on economic activity
 during the next decade. Assuming that China is able
 to achieve the ambitious energy-production targets
 published in its media, our calculations suggest that
 the economy will be hard pressed to exceed a 4.4-
 percent average rate of agricultural and industrial
 increase through the mid-1990s (see figure 2, "Base-
 line Energy Scenario"). This rate is well short of
 Beijing's growth targets for the period and inconsider-
 ably below the average annual growth of 5.7 percent,
 which China achieved between 1952 and 1977.5F_
 ' This is in part a result of the upswing in the energy-intensive
 heavy-industry sector. Q
 ' Subject to hard currency requirements, China could generate
 more growth by eliminating oil exports and importing more oil.
 In completing these calculations, we assumed that
 agriculture would grow at 4 percent per year-the
 target for the Sixth Five-Year Plan-through 1990.
 This estimate is about I percentage point above the
 historical growth path for agriculture. We also as-
 sume that light industry grows at 5 percent annually
 through 1995, again extending the Sixth Plan target.
 Energy demand in the residential-commercial sector
 is assumed to grow 4 percent annually, reflecting the
 increases in real disposable income available to the
 Chinese. Variations of I percentage point up or down
 in these assumptions did not materially modify our
 results. Changes outside of this range produced im-
 balances in sector performance that would ultimately
 constrain economic growth.
 We have also constructed high and low scenarios in
 the event that energy output varies from the plan over
 the decade. In the high scenario, should the Chinese
 surpass the energy-production targets by 15 percent,
 they could add about half a percentage point to their
 average rate of economic growth between 1983 and
 1995, bringing it up to 5 percent. In the low scenario,
 a substantial shortfall of 25 percent in expected
 energy production-brought on, for example, by a
 slowdown in the acquisition of hydroelectric power
 plants, problems in developing new coal mines, and
 lower production from the offshore oil program-
 would cut the rate of economic growth by about 1
 percentage point annually over the period. This would
 bring it down to about 3.5 percent. To match China's
 historical growth rate would require a combination of
 high energy growth and efficiencies that we consider
 unlikely.
 Enhanced Role for Western Firms
 As they come to recognize the full seriousness of the
 energy bind, the Chinese will be reinforced in their
 decision to have Western companies deeply involved
 in energy development. Beijing may rely more heavily
 on foreign equipment, technology, and investment to
 develop its coal sector, where production can be
 boosted within a relatively short time. An acceleration

 of the coal program would require additional large
 amounts of investment, which could only come from
 foreign partners. Increasing petroleum production
 would be a longer term proposition, but the Chinese
 may try to speed up offshore development timetables
 and expand the number of blocks in which foreign
 firms are operating. It may also launch a more
 ambitious program for secondary and tertiary recov-
 ery at onshore fields.
 US firms, which are world leaders in the petroleum
 industry as well as in surface coal mining, stand to
 benefit most by China's urgent needs. Beijing has long
 been attracted to US oil firms, not only because of
 their strong position as a supplier of technology, but
 more importantly because of their unrivaled manage-
 rial and engineering experience with offshore oil
 projects. These assets will almost certainly win US oil
 majors a significant portion of the South China Sea
 blocks now in bidding.
 Although Beijing looks very favorably on US petro-
 leum companies, five or six major non-US companies
 will also play a long-term role in China's offshore

 programs as China seeks to diversify its dependency.
 British, French, and Japanese firms have already
 signed contracts, and Royal Dutch Shell also has
 sufficient technology and know-how to be highly
 competitive in offshore development work. Neverthe-
 less, their management and engineering experience is
 more limited than that of the US companies, and the
 non-US companies may well encounter some techni-
 cal difficulty operating in deepwater areas. Such
 shortcomings might be offset, however, by subcon-
 tracting specialized operations to US exploration com-
 panies or their foreign subsidiaries.
 In nonpetroleum energy projects, such as coal, gas,
 and nuclear and hydroelectric power, the Chinese will
 also retain a diversity of foreign partners. Although
 US firms have an advantage in surface-mining tech-
 nologies and possibly nuclear power, the Europeans
 and Japanese are at least equal in underground
 mining and hydroelectricity. The Soviets are also
 capable of assisting the Chinese in hydroelectric
 development.

 ing heavily on offshore petroleum production to help it
 through its energy bind, but our calculations suggest
 that supplies will constrain economic growth in any case.
 Foreign Trade: Pressures for Expansion
 Over the next decade China plans to place more
 emphasis on foreign trade in its efforts to increase the
 pace of overall growth. Authoritative Chinese officials
 predict that in this period trade will expand twice as
 fast as domestic production.' The Chinese recognize
 that expanded equipment imports from the West are
 key to their ability to compete with quality products
 in the international marketplace while conserving
 energy and raw materials.
 as much as 50 to 60 percent
 of the country's plant is highly inefficient by Western
 6 Countries with large populations and geographic size tend to have
 lower foreign trade ratios (exports plus imports divided by GNP)
 than smaller countries. Thus, China, like the United States and
 USSR, will never be as dependent on foreign trade as South Korea,
 standards. The World Bank calculates that productiv-
 ity has stagnated since 1957. Its studies show that
 between 1957 and 1979 industrial output growth has
 been achieved almost entirely by increasing the quan-
 tities of labor and capital employed rather than by
 improving the quality of inputs or the efficiency with
 which they are being used. In this regard, China's
 performance is far worse than the 1952-57 period    25X1
 when capital and labor productivity rose substantially.
 China's plans call for its large-scale import program    25X1
 to be financed over the next decade primarily out of     25X1
 export earnings. Statements by Chinese officials im-
 ply that they expect exports to rise as a share of GDP
 from 6 percent to approximately 9 percent. Without
 expanded earnings, China would be forced to go into

 heavy debt-an option still anathema to China's
 leadership-or be prepared to accept a more modest
 import program that would retard overall economic
 growth.
 Increasing problems of providing employment within
 China, possibly of unprecedented proportions, will be
 an additional pressure on Beijing to expand export
 industries. According to Chinese demographers, the
 number of people reaching working age over the next
 decade will average more than 3 million annually in
 the urban areas and some 20 million per year in the
 countryside. It is doubtful that these new workers can
 be absorbed by China's virtually fixed agricultural
 base, and Beijing is investing more heavily in export-
 oriented industries to bring some relief.
 China Looks to the United States for Markets ...
 These pressures will impel China increasingly to
 cultivate the West, particularly the United States, as
 a source of export earnings. The United States now
 stands as China's third-largest export market, ac-
 counting for 10 percent of its total foreign exchange
 earnings, and China still considers the United States
 to have a large, relatively untapped appetite for
 Chinese goods. The complementarity of the US and
 Chinese economies suggests that China might be able
 to obtain as large a share of the US market as its
 present share of the world market, and maybe more.'
 China today accounts for 1.4 percent of world ex-
 ports-nearly double its 0.8-percent share of the US
 market (see appendix A). We would expect stronger
 Chinese sales to the United States of light industrial
 goods, consumer electronics, machine tools, finished
 wood products, and textiles.
 Despite this growth, China is not likely to become
 heavily dependent on any particular export market.
 Beijing will continue to trade substantially with
 Japan, Hong Kong, and Western Europe. Moreover,
 recent trends suggest that China's trade is becoming
 more diversified in the direction of the Soviet Union
 and Eastern Europe. Declines in trade between China
 and the USSR and Eastern Europe over the past two
 decades leave much potential for Chinese sales of

 Asian economies, which achieved their economic takeoff through
 exporting, largely to the United States.
 light industrial goods, including textiles and hard
 wares. Exports to the debt-ridden LDCs probably will
 grow the least over the next decade.
 ... and Technologies/Food Grains
 On the import side, by 1990 US sales can be expected
 to be running two to three times the present level of
 some $3 billion per year. This is a conservative
 estimate, based on the assumption that China only
 partially achieves its trade expansion goals and that
 the United States simply retains its current 20-
 percent share of the market. Given Chinese develop-
 ment priorities, American equipment and technologies
 in the transportation, mining, electronics, and energy
 sectors will be highly attractive. In addition, over the
 long term, China probably will have to increase grain
 imports as it grapples with the problem of trying to
 feed a growing population that now exceeds 1 billion
 people on 100 million hectares of arable land.' Higher
 incomes in China will add to the problem by raising
 the demand for meat, which requires large amounts of
 grain to produce. We believe, however, that the
 United States is unlikely to retain its current 60-
 percent share of the Chinese market as other grain-
 exporting countries expand production. The United
 States, however, will remain the largest single suppli-
 er, providing a larger share if Chinese harvests suffer
 severe shortfalls.
 Political Implications of
 Growing Economic Interdependence
 China's foreign policy has long been a complicated
 brew of realpolitik, xenophobic nationalism, and eco-
 nomic calculation. In the post-1949 era these forces
 have vied with one another, sometimes sharply, as
 China struggled to chart its course in the world.
 Security considerations have been the primary force
 shaping China's post-1949 foreign policy, but there
 have been periods when China's need for economic
 ties abroad has been an influential factor.

 ~ecrvL
 Moscow's substantial economic assistance to China
 during the 1950s was clearly an important stimulus
 for Beijing's concessions to the USSR on a number of
 fundamental political issues. By any accounting, the
 1950 Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty was a bad politi-
 cal deal for the Chinese. After two months of hard
 bargaining, China:
 ? Recognized Outer Mongolia's continued "independ-
 ent status," which constituted tacit acceptance of
 Soviet control of territory that the Chinese believed
 was theirs.
 ? Agreed not to change the status of Dalian, which
 the Soviets were then occupying as a naval base. F-
 The Chinese occasionally hint that there is a direct
 link in the leadership's thinking between their own
 moderation on bilateral political issues and economic
 gain from the United States. In a recent conversation
 with senior US officials, Ambassador Zhang Wenjin
 strongly implied that China would not push Taiwan-
 related matters if the United States were more gener-
 ous in authorizing technology sales
 During the past year the Chinese have underscored 25X1
 the value they attach to the US economic relations by
 taking pains to insulate them, for the most part, from
 the political differences that have beleaguered bilater- 25X1
 al political relations. Senior Chinese officials, includ-
 ing Deng, have emphasized their intention not to
 allow these tensions to jeopardize overall trade and
 investment. In fact, the Chinese recently committed
 themselves to two large-scale, long-term joint ventures
 with US firms.
 Economic Leverage and the Taiwan Issue
 The importance to Beijing of continued access to US
 technological assistance and markets is likely to build
 over the next several years-reaching a high mark
 during the late 1980s. At that time China's energy
 shortage will have grown more acute, and US oil
 firms will be starting to move from exploration to the
 crucial developmental phase. The large amount of
 funds required for development will cause China to
 depend heavily on the international financial markets
 in which the United States plays a strong role. If
 Sino-US political relations were to veer off course
 before 1985, it would be easier for the Chinese to pull
 back from involvement without sustaining inordinate
 losses of time. After 1990, China may be better
 positioned to move ahead independently of US compa-
 nies as it gains experience with offshore development.
 The Soviets. subsequently delayed withdrawal from
 Manchuria and Lushun-both of which were to be
 vacated on dates established in the Treaty. Later,
 after having urged the Chinese into the Korean
 conflict, Moscow reneged on promises of compensa-
 tion for war expenditures. Nevertheless, as Chinese
 officials would later recall, China endured these
 affronts, in large part because they feared the loss of
 Soviet economic assistance.
 As the 1950s unfolded, Moscow's use of its economic
 ties to extract political and economic gains from
 China took its toll, ultimately helping precipitate a
 total break. This bitter experience convinced the
 Chinese that they must avoid becoming economically
 reliant on any one country again. Further, it explains
 Beijing's efforts to spread its trade and investment
 relations-as seen by its opening to the West in the
 1970s-over a broad range of countries.
 Despite this concern, there is some evidence that, as
 development has become a higher priority for the
 Chinese leadership in recent years, economic consid-
 erations have played an increasingly influential role in
 China's foreign policy. Expectations of a major expan-
 sion of Sino-US economic ties seem to have been an
 important element in the Chinese decision to drop its
 precondition for a termination of US arms sales to
 Taiwan and to move ahead with the establishment of
 full diplomatic relations in 1979. During the year
 prior to normalization, senior American officials
 painted a promising picture of liberalized trade and
 technology flows that would follow diplomatic recog-
 nition.
 The key question is how US economic leverage will
 influence Beijing's treatment of bilateral political
 irritants, especially the US-Taiwan relationship. Al-
 though China's assessment of the United States as a
 strategic counterweight to the Soviets will remain
 paramount in shaping Beijing's policy, we believe its
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/30: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000200130003-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/30: CIA-RDP84SO0553R000200130003-1
 growing economic interdependence with the United
 States will help to moderate Beijing's reaction to what
 it sees as adverse developments in US-Taiwan ties.
 The Chinese appreciate the separation of private
 enterprise and government in the United States, but
 they almost certainly will worry that a major falling
 out may cause Washington to actively discourage US
 companies from making additional commitments for
 offshore operations or take steps to retard the transfer
 of petroleum-related technologies. Unsettled US-Chi-
 na relations could, in any case, cause US oil firms and
 bankers to be less willing to risk committing them-
 selves to long-term projects with Beijing. Moreover,
 the coming decade will be a period when China's
 foreign trade with the United States is of greater
 importance to China's economy than it is now, adding
 pressure on Beijing to try to ensure that its exports
 and imports are not constrained by a serious dispute
 over Taiwan.
 The Chinese also will want to avoid a highly charged
 Sino-US political atmosphere, fearing that this could
 in time adversely affect trade and investment, ties with
 Japan-a country that has traditionally followed the
 American lead. Japan would almost certainly be more
 wary of extending large concessionary loans if rela-
 tions between Washington and Beijing appeared to be
 heading for a sharp decline. Such a turn of events
 could also complicate Chinese efforts to acquire ad-
 vanced technology from Tokyo and cause private
 industry in the United States and Japan to become
 more wary about making long-term investments.
 We believe these new economic pressures on Beijing
 will help shape a more tolerant attitude toward US
 arms sales to Taiwan. Given the ambiguities of the
 17 August 1982 communique, during the latter half of
 the 1980s China will have a greater incentive to take a
 flexible view of these sales as long as they do not
 clearly violate the "quantity and quality" provisions
 of the communique. In interpreting the "gray areas"
 of the agreement, the Chinese may be more receptive
 to US accounting of quantitative trends as well as our
 judgment as to what constitutes a qualitative improve-
 ment of arms. Moreover, in reacting to individual
 political initiatives that appear to favor Taipei, Bei-
 jing may be more predisposed toward pro forma
 responses and extremely cautious about boxing itself
 into hardline positions.
 The Limits of US Economic Influence
 Even in the late 1980s, however, US economic influ-
 ence in China will have definite limits. China's his-
 torical sensitivity to infringements of its sovereignty,
 reinforced by its negative encounter with the Soviet
 Union in the 1950s, has left a deep and lasting scar.
 Many influential Chinese, despite their ostensibly
 pro-Western outlook and their enthusiasm for stron-
 ger economic and technological ties with the United
 States, continue to harbor a deep resentment of
 China's humiliating partition by the West during the
 past century. For them, Taiwan's status symbolizes
 their country's continuing subservience to Western
 power and denies China its respect as a great nation.
 Hence, for much of the past three decades, one of
 Beijing's major foreign policy objectives has been the
 military and political isolation of the Government of
 Taiwan. During the 1950s this aim lay behind two
 major military crises in the Taiwan Straits and since
 1970 has been a central issue in every major set of
 political negotiations between China and the United
 States. China's relations with Japan, Europe, and the
 Third World have also been dependent on their tacit
 agreement not to strengthen official ties with Taiwan.
 In Beijing's view, the progress that has been made
 toward reunification has been hard won, and it would
 regard an unambiguous trend toward stronger US-
 Taiwan defense or political ties as a fundamental
 threat to the gains for which it has worked so long. In
 this situation, we believe the Chinese would be pre-
 pared to force a general retrogression in Sino-US
 relations and to sacrifice some important elements of
 their economic and technological ties.
 Viable Commercial Alternatives to the United States
 Although Beijing's economic links with the United
 States will be highly valued, particularly during the
 latter half of this decade, China would have viable
 commercial options if a major rupture of its commer-
 cial relations with the United States were to occur.
 The Chinese could proceed with their offshore oil
 exploration and development program by utilizing
 non-US companies, principally European. Once devel-
 opment is under way, a switch away from US firms

 Secret
 would be a time-consuming and expensive undertak-
 ing that could result in China's having to cut back the
 scope of its offshore program. Beijing's greatest chal-
 lenge would be to locate non-US companies willing to
 invest large amounts of capital and to pick up where
 the US companies left off. Much would depend on
 prospects at the time for oil recovery in the US blocks.
 In a seriously deteriorating political situation, China
 could also weather a sharp reduction in trade with the
 United States. The Chinese appreciate that, short of a
 state of war, the US Government would be unlikely to
 impose anything resembling a cutoff in bilateral
 trade. More realistically, a US administration could
 withdraw trade preferences, such as most-favored-
 nation treatment, which is extended annually to Chi-
 na. It could also use its discretionary authority to
 curtail the importation of textiles and other high-
 volume Chinese exports. At most, we estimate such
 actions would cut China's foreign exchange earnings
 by 5 to 10 percent-enough to significantly constrain
 development plans but not cripple the economy. A
 portion of this loss could be offset by short-term
 borrowing, and the Soviet Union might take up some
 of the slack in China's exports as a political gesture.
 The imposition of US restrictions on technology and
 grain exports would no doubt put a crimp in China's
 development program, but would not be an insuper-
 able obstacle. In a number of industrial and military
 projects requiring advanced computer and electronic
 technology, the Chinese may well have to settle for
 less than state-of-the-art equipment. A cutoff of
 advanced technology from the United States would
 also inhibit China's efforts to learn how to replicate
 those embargoed items. On the other hand, over the
 next decade the Chinese will develop a much stronger
 capability to acquire advanced technology through
 illegal means, and strict enforcement of COCOM
 regulations is a problem that will probably become
 increasingly difficult. China's sources of grain will
 remain diversified, and, at worst, it could end up
 having to pay higher prices from other suppliers such
 as Canada, Australia, and Argentina
