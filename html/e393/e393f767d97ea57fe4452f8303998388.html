 THE AIRLINES STRIKE-POLITICS
 VERSUS PUBLIC INTEREST
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, I invite
 the Senate's attention to an excellent
 editorial about the airlines strike, which
 was published in today's New York
 Times. Clearly, it is high time that the
 White House actively intervene in efforts
 to bring this intolerable strike against
 the public interest to a prompt conclu-
 sion. I ask unanimous consent that the
 editorial be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the New York (N.Y.) Times, July 28,
 1966)
 POLITICS VERSUS PUBLIC INTEREST
 The only conclusion possible from Secre-
 tary of Labor Wirtz' testimony on the air-
 lines strike is that politics is the chief yard-
 stick the White House applies in determining
 when the cut-off of an essential service cre-
 ates a national emergency.
 The Secretary's recommendation that Con-
 gress scrap plans for an immediate back-to-
 work law and give "free collective bargain-
 ing" another chance was a clear capitulation
 to the dictates of organized labor.  Twenty-
 four hours earlier, while the Senate Labor
 Committee held off its hearing at the Ad-
 ministration's request, George Meany had
 given the White House its cue.
 "No danger to the nation's health and wel-
 fare and no threat to national defense have
 been demonstrated," the A.F.L.-C.I.O. presi-
 dent declared.  "The air traveling public has,
 of course, been inconvenienced, but incon-
 venience is a small price to pay for free-
 dom."
 Mr. Wirtz put it differently, but came up
 with the same answer: Do nothing right
 away.  This a week after President Johnson
 had declared that the strike was trying "the
 patience of the American people"-and that
 the time had come for a settlement.  Mr.
 Wirtz acknowledged that the tie-up already
 has had "a serious, substantial, adverse Im-
 pact on the national interest" and that its
 prolongation would bring the country to a
 "crisis" stage at some point.
 Why the nation must wait until the hard-
 ship  becomes  Intolerable  before  Congress
 acts, the  Secretary failed to  make clear.
 Even more obscure was his idea of how "free
 collective bargaining" can be secured in a
 dispute that has already been reviewed by a
 Presidential emergency board.   That board,
 headed by Senator WAYNE MoRsE, recom-
 mended wage increases that went beyond the
 Administration's  anti-inflation guideposts.
 The President urged both labor and manage-
 ment to follow these proposals; the airlines
 not only accepted them, they bettered them.
 The striking machinists still say no.
 Presumably what Mr, Wirtz means by his
 prescription that Congress send both sides
 "back to the woodshed" with a settlement
 deadline is that pressure will now be ex-
 erted          on  management  to  save  the union's
 -face by giving It more money.  Such ap-
 peasement of labor under White House aegis
 has been the historic road to instability in
 industrial relations and to wage-price in-
 flation, The airlines, as a regulatep industry
 enjoying record prosperity, are In poor posi-
 tion to hold out against what th  Adminis-

 August 8, 1966, issue of Look magazine

 at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the inter-

 RECORD, RS follows:
 VIETNAM:   SUPPOSE  THE  PRESIDENT  ASKED
 You "WHAT SHOULD WE Do Now?"-FivE
 EXPERTS GIvx THEIR ANSWER
 (Produced by Leo Rotten)
 (NOTE.-We are at  war  in Vietnam.
 Whether we should have gotten into it or
 not is a separate issue.       We are in Vietnam.
 (Americans  have always backed their
 armies with the moral certainty that in our
 victory right would triumph.       But to many
 today, our cause seems stained by doubt.
 Never, during a foreign war, have Americans
 debated our national policy with such pas-
 sion:   "Get   out, . . . Escalate.. . . Nego-
 tiate.     . 'Hole in' at coastal enclaves.,
 Blockade Haiphong.... Push 'hot pursuit'
 into Laos"  The bitterness of the partisans
 consolidates the confusion.
 (Look invited in five experts, who hold
 varying views about Vietnam, to answer this
 question:  "Suppose  the  President  today
 asked you, 'What should we do now?"'    We
 urged each to reply in the Intentionally brief
 space of 1,000 words-for we sought not a
 pablum of agreement but sharp, specific
 proposals.
 #Here are their answers.  Each man pre-
 sents a program that millions  would no
 doubt support.)

 and Military Policy; has served as consult-
 ant to the Department of State and the

 Defense of the National Interest," "The
 Purpose of American Politics," etc.)
 President Johnson is wont to ask the critics
 of his Vietnam policy, "What would you do
 if you were in my place?" This is a legitimate
 question, and it deserves an answer. Having
 been a consistent critic of our Vietnam poli-
 cies for more than four years, I have tried to
 answer that question before and am glad to
 do so again.
 Mr. President, I would say, you must choose
 between two alternative policies.  You can
 start with the assumption that in Vietnam
 the credibility of the United States and its
 prestige as a great power are irrevocably en-
 gaged; that the war in Vietnam is a test case
 for all "ware of national liberation"; and that
 in consequence, the fate of Asia, and perhaps
 even of the non-Communist world at large,
 might well be decided in Vietnam.  if you
 believe this,  then you must see the war
 through to victory.  That is to say, you must
 escalate the wax both in the South and in
 the North by committing what will amount
 (according to authoritative estimates) to a
 million    American  combat  troops and  by
 bombing, without restrictions, the industrial
 and population centers of North Vietnam.
 By doing this, you will destroy Vietnam,
 North and South, and risk a military con-
 frontation with China or the Soviet Union
 or both.  Yet these risks are justified by the
 magnitude of the Issues at stake,
 This Is the policy that the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff have been advocating and that you have
 pursued since February, 1965, even though
 you have been anxious to differentiate your
 policy from that of the Joint Chiefs.  In
 truth, the difference between the two has
 not been one of kind but rather of degree.
 You have been escalating the war at a slower
 pace than the Joint Chiefs recommended.
 But escalate you did, and you will continue
 escalating  because  the  assumptions  from
 which you have started leave you no choice.
 There  is  another  policy,  Mr. President,
 which you could and, in my view, should
 have pursued. This policy assumes that the
 war is primarily a civil war; that its global
 significance is remote; that, far from con-
 taining China and communism, it opens the
 gates to both-by destroying the social fabric
 of Vietnamese nationalism, which is implac-
 ably hostile to China; and that, in conse-
 quence, the risks we are taking in the pursuit
 of victory are out of all proportion to the
 interests at stake.
 We should never have gotten involved in
 this war, but we are deeply involved in it.
 The aim of our policy must be to avoid get-
 ting more deeply involved in it and to extri-
 cate ourselves from it while minimizing our
 losses.  Recent events In Vietnam offer us
 the opportunity of initiating such a new
 policy of disengagement.
 These events have clearly demonstrated
 two facts: The Saigon government is hardly
 worthy of the name; and the great mass of
 the people of South Vietnam prefer an end
 to the war rather than a fight to the finish
 with the Vietcong.  The two main arguments
 with which our involvement has been jus-
 tified have thus been demolished: that we
 have a commitment to the government of
 Saigon to assist it in the fight against the
 Vietcong; and that the people of South Viet-
 nam want to be saved by us from the Viet-
 cong-even at the risk of their own destruc-
 tion.  The prospect of elections to be held
 in South  Vietnam  provides  us  with the
 chance to use these new facts for the initia-
 tion of a new policy of disengagement. Such
 a policy would proceed on two fronts, the
 political and the military.
 Politically,  we  ought  to work for  the
 achievement of four goals.
 1. We must promote the establishment of
 a broadly-based government in which the
 elements seeking an end to the war would
 have decisive influence.  This government
 would have the task of organizing elections
 for a constituent assembly and a legislature
 at an early date.   It must be recognized
 that such elections will neither be represent-
 ative nor "free."                                                                                                                                  The group that organizes
 them is likely to win them.   Hence, the
 crucial importance of the composition of the
 government presiding over the elections.
 2. We must see to it that the government
 that emerges from these elections will nego-
 tiate with the Vietcong for a modus vivendi,
 Such a settlement would no doubt increase
 the risk of a complete takeover by the Viet-
 cong.  However, it is quite possible to vis-
 ualize a coalition government under which
 different sections of the country, after the
 model of the Laotian setlement, would be
 governed by different factions.  One can even
 visualize a South Vietnamese government
 that would be anxious to maintain its inde-
 pendence vis-a-vis the North.
 3. We should put United States military
 forces stationed in South Vietnam at the
 disposal of  the government that  emerges
 from the elections, to be used as bargaining
 counters in negotiations with the Vietcong.
 In other words, we would honor our commit-
 ments and would leave it to the South Viet-
 namese Government to interpret them-in
 order to bring the war to an end.
 4. Our ultimate goal would be the with-
 drawal of our armed forces from South Viet-
 nam.  Such a withdrawal would be coor-

 dinated with the progress of negotiations be-
 tween the government of South Vietnam and
 the Vietcong. Our military forces would be
 gradually  withdrawn, and  our  military
 presence   would' always be commensurate
 with the political purposes it is intended to
 serve.
 Pending such a withdrawal, our military
 policy would come in three parts:
 1. We would stop both the bombing of
 North Vietnam and the search-and-destroy
 operations in South Vietnam that seek to
 kill the Vietcong and occupy territory con-
 trolled by them.  For the continuation of
 such operations in the North and South is
 compatible only with a policy aiming at vic-
 tory, not with one seeking a negotiated set-
 tlement among the Vietnamese factions.
 2. We would hold the cities and coastal en-
 claves that we and the South Vietnamese
 military now control.  That is to say, we
 would be satisfied with a de facto division
 of South Vietnam.
 8. We would expect the Vietcong to recipro-
 cate by ceasing attacks upon the perimeter
 of our positions and by stopping sabotage
 within them.  It can be assumed that we
 and the Vietcong have a reciprocal interest
 in maintaining the military status quo pend-
 ing negotiations.
 The policy here advocated, Mr. President, is
 anathema to the men who advise you.  Yet
 it has always been supported by officials
 fairly high in your administration.  It now
 has the support of a number of senators who
 in the past have been "hawks" rather than
 "doves."
 You, Mr. President, will have to decide
 whether the present policy-morally dubious,
 militarily hopeless and risky, politically aim-
 less and counterproductive-shall be contin-
 ued or whether a better policy shall take its
 place.  You aspire to be a great President.
 Whether you remain the prisoner of past
 mistakes or have the courage to correct them
 will be the test of your greatness.

 ment, Harvard, and member of the Center
 for International Affairs; consultant to the
 National Security Council under President
 Kennedy; author of "The Troubled Part-
 nership," "Nuclear Weapons and Foreign
 Policy,"' etc.)
 The war in Vietnam is dominated by two
 factors: Withdrawal would be disastrous, and
 negotiations are inevitable.  American pol-
 icy must take both of these realities into
 account,
 'I. The impossibility of withdrawal.  An
 American withdrawal under conditions that
 could plausibly be represented as a Commu-
 nist victory would be disastrous for these
 reasons:
 Within the Communist world, Chinese at-
 tacks on Soviet "revisionism" have focused
 on the Russian doctrine of peaceful coexist-
 ence.                         A victory by a third-class Communist
 peasant state over the United States must
 strengthen the most bellicose factions in
 the internecine Communist struggles around
 the world.
 In Southeast Asia, it would demoralize
 those countries-especially Laos, Malaysia,
 the  Philippines  and  Thailand-that have
 supported our effort.
 The long-term orientation of such coun-
 tries as India and Japan will reflect to a con-
 siderable extent their assessment of Amer-
 ica's willingness and ability to honor its com-
 mitments.  For example, whether or not In-
 dia decides to become a nuclear power de-
 pends crucially on its confidence in American
 support against Chinese nuclear blackmail.
 A demonstration of American Impotence in
 Asia cannot fail to lessen the credibility of
 American pledges in other fields.  The sta-
 bility of areas geographically far removed
 from Vietnam will be basically affected by
 the outcome there,
 In short, we are on longer fighting in Viet-
 nam only for the Vietnamese.  We are also
 fighting for ourselves and for international
 stability.
 2. The inevitability of negotiation,  His-
 torically, the goal of a war, for the United
 States, has been the destruction of enemy
 forces.  Negotiations could start only after
 the enemy had been crashed.  But the pri-
 mary issue in Vietnam is political and pay-
 chological, not military.
 What makes the war so complicated is the
 existence of a Communist "shadow govern-
 ment," permeating every aspect of Vietnam-
 ese life.  A favorable outcome depends on the
 ability to create a political structure that can
 command the loyalties of the Vietnamese
 people.
 A purely military solution is impossible
 also because Vietnam directly engages the
 interests and the prestige of so many major
 powers,   Finally,  the  Administration  has
 stressed its unconditional readiness to re-
 spond to any overture by Hanoi for negotia-
 tions.
 In these circumstances, the political pro-
 gram-both within Vietnam and for negotia-
 tions-is  crucial.   Military  victories  will
 prove empty if they are f}ot coupled with
 an effort to build political structures. Nego-
 tiations will be sterile or dangerous unless
 we enter them with significant areas of the
 country substantially free of terror.
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
 1. Negotiations are likely when Hanoi real-
 izes that its political apparatus in the coun-
 tryside is being systematically reduced, and
 that this process will accelerate the longer
 the war lasts.  It follows that the primary
 goal of military operations should be the
 creation of secure areas.  It is better to have
 100-percent  control  in   40  percent of the
 country than 40-percent control in 100 per-
 cent of the country.                                                                                          This is not to say that
 we should adopt a static "enclave" theory,
 'which would leave us with three Hong Kongs
 and two Berlins in the midst of hostile popu-
 lations.  Nor does it mean that we must write
 off all the territory that we cannot securely
 control. We will always retain a capacity
 for preventing the consolidation of Commu-
 nist control even in areas that we do not con-
 trol ourselves.  It does mean that the high-
 est priority must be given to creating "se-
 cure" zones that contain a maximum of pop-
 ulation-zones that can be expanded if the
 war continues and that will give us reliable
 negotiating counters at a conference.
 2. We must understand that political in-
 stabiilty in Vietnam reflects the transforma-
 tion of an essentially feudal structure into
 a modern state--a process that took centu-
 ries in the West.  Such a process involves a
 profound shift of loyalties-a task. that would
 be searing in the best of circumstances, but
 is compounded by the pressures of civil war.
 This imposes two requirements on us:  (a)
 We must have compassion for the travail
 of a society that has been wracked by war
 for two decades and not use its agony as an
 alibi for failing in our duty; and ('b) we must
 give special emphasis to building political
 structures from the ground up.
 3. The notion drawn from our experience
 in Europe, that economic assistance auto-
 matically produces political stability, does
 not apply in Vietnam.  On the contrary, there
 is a danger that our enthusiasm and our con-
 cern with technical refinements .will over-
 whelm slender administrative resources and
 compound political demoralization.  The test
 should be whether a program can enlist local
 support and thus give the rural population
 an incentive to defend it.  Efforts should be
 concentrated in areas of maximum military
 security and spread out from there.
 4. It may prove impossible to settle the
 war at a large conference that deals with all
 issues simultaneously.  If the negotiations
 are conducted in a forum consisting of many
 nations  that are already rivals  (e.g.,  the
 U.S.S.R. and Communist China, or the U.S.
 and France), energies may be dissipated in
 duly 2,, 1966
 political jockeying that is peripheral to the
 central problems in Vietnam.   It may be
 wiser to separate the issues into their com-
 ponent elements, each to be settled by the
 parties primarily involved. A larger confer-
 ence could then work out guarantees for set-
 tlements already achieved in other forums.
 5. The war in Vietnam is a crucial test of
 American maturity.  In the lives of nations,
 as of individuals, there comes a ;point when
 future options are limited by past actions.
 The choices of 1966 are not those of 1961.
 We must recognize that to be on the de-
 fensive often forces us to be  engaged in
 places chosen by opponents for their diffi-
 culty and ambiguity.
 We do not have the privilege of deciding
 to meet only those challenges that most flat-
 ter our moral preconceptions.  If we cannot
 deal with political, economic and military
 problems as an integrated whole, we will not
 be able to deal with them individually.
 (By Hanson W. Baldwin, military editor of
 the New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winner

 It's the eleventh hour in Vietnam.  The
 United States must decide to win or get out.
 It is not too late to win, but it soon may be.
 Victory means, first of all, a Governmental
 and national determination to will.
 Congress should declare a state of national
 emergency and authorize a limited mobiliza-
 tion.                                                                                                                                                   Our trained and ready military power
 is spread thin all over the world.  Limited
 mobilization  would  provide-more quickly
 than any other means-a pool of at least
 partially trained manpower and organized
 logistical training and combat units to sus-
 tain a rapid buildup in Vietnam and, uti-
 mately, to strengthen our weakened positions
 in other parts of the world.
 The  President should  be  authorized  to
 mobilize up to 500,000 reserves for two-year
 service,  Draft calls should be increased as
 necessary.   All enlistments should be ex-
 tended for a minimum of six months.
 South     Vietnam,  North  Vietnam, Laos,
 Cambodia and Thailand must be regarded as
 a strategic whole.  The war in South Viet-
 nam  is                                                                                                                                                  clearly  nourished  from outside.
 Soldiers, medicines, supplies, and especially
 arms and ammunition, today reach South
 Vietnam by sea, from Cambodia, through
 Laos, and from North Vietnam by any and
 all methods.  Most of the small arms now
 used by the Vietcong "main-force" units are
 standardized on the Soviet 7.62-mm caliber
 basis and are Chinese-manufactured,  All of
 the heavy arms-mortars, antiaircraft guns,
 SAM missiles, MIG's, IL-28 bombers, and the
 world's  largest  helicopter,  the  MI-6--are
 either Chinese- or Russian-manufactured.
 We must shut off, to the best of our abil-
 ity, the stream of Communist supplies into
 North Vietnam.   We should  turn off the
 faucet, not merely put a stopper in the drain.
 This  means blocking  the  seaborne  arms
 traffic to North Vietnam-by mining, bomb-
 ing, naval gunfire; the sinking of a dredge
 in the narrow, silted ship channel to Hai-
 phong;  by so-called "pacific blockade"                                                                                                                                                  or
 "quarantine" or other means.
 The land supply routes, even more impor-
 tant to the Communist war effort, must also
 be interrupted.  Past limitations upon the
 bombing of railroads and roads, and of the
 choke points and  communications bottle-
 necks in North Vietnam's extensive road net-
 work, must be removed.  We must reduce the
 flow of supplies from North Vietnam through
 Laos and Cambodia. Many of these supplies
 move partway by truck; we have been bomb-
 ing the trucks but, until recently, not the
 fuel-oil  supplies  that  power  them.   We
 should bomb all the fuel-oil depots in North
 Vietnam.  Electric power plants, which pro-
 vide power for a variety of war purposes,
 should also be bombed.

 in our streets and also toward some inno-
 cent bystanders.
 The  junior  Senator from  Ohio,
 throughout his rather long life, has never
 liked people who push other people
 around. There were, in some instances,
 individual policemen who acted irrespon-
 sibly.
 For Instance, in Newsweek of August 1
 is pictured a Negro woman seated in an
 automobile, riddled by police bullets.
 Caption of the lady with blood stream-
 ing from her face is "Hough: Police Bul-
 lets Riddled a Car and Wounded a Young
 Mother." Surely that is evidence of irre-
 sponsible action by police.
 Mr. President, I stand by my statement
 of last Tuesday.  We have a fine police
 department in Cleveland.  We have a
 fine fire department.  In my statement
 of last Tuesday I was careful to state it
 was a minority of policemen who did not
 conduct themselves as responsibly as they
 should under the circumstances.  The
 great majority of the Cleveland police
 force is to be commended on its restraint
 during that difficult time.
 Years ago I was a private in the Ohio
 National  Guard.  Those    guardsmen
 called from their civilian vocations per-
 formed an unpleasant duty in a highly
 creditable manner. It is a fact as stated
 by me, and I reaffirm every statement I
 made last Tuesday, some of these guards-
 men, most of them very young men, are
 unaccustomed to handling weapons in
 combat.   A  few  appeared  "trigger
 happy," as the saying is; and in a couple
 of instances their guns were fired acci-
 dentally.                    Fortunately, they injured no
 one.
 For instance, the Cleveland Press re-
 ported an incident in which a National
 Guardsman fired several rounds from a
 machinegun at East 55th and Harlem
 Court when he thought he heard prowl-
 ers.  Firing several rounds from a ma-
 chinegun in a heavily populated neigh-
 borhood appears to me to have been the
 act of a trigger-happy guardsman.
 I do assert that there was no nation-
 wide conspiracy or Communist conspir-
 acy, so-called, involved.  While there
 may have been organized bands of hood-
 lums who took advantage of the riots to
 pillage and loot; while there may have
 been extremist groups who grasped the
 opportunity to exploit the violence for
 their own selfish ends; I am convinced
 that the riots themselves did not begin
 as a result of any conspiracy or organized
 plan.  To state the riots were Commu-
 nist, or otherwise, inspired appears to me
 to be a lame excuse to salve the con-
 sciences of those who do not want to,
 or refuse to, face the conditions that pre-
 cipitated this disaster and similar ones
 in other great cities of our Nation-rat-
 infested slums, unemployment, poverty,
 hopelessness, frustration, and despair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time
 of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that I may be
 permitted to speak for an additional 3
 minutes on another matter.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 D - SENATE            July
 PRIME MINISTER KY
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President,
 Prime Minister Ky, of the Saigon regime,
 has been in power since June 1965, when
 10 generals conspired and overthrew the
 civilian government of South Vietnam.
 I realize that at the Honolulu Con-
 ference, earlier this year, our President
 embraced him and made a sort of sweet-
 smelling geranium of him.  Evidently
 power has gone to the head of this flam-
 boyant so-called air marshal.
 Shortly after the 10 generals made him
 Prime Minister, in an interview by an
 American reporter he was asked:
 Who are your heroes, Marshal Ky?
 His answer was:
 I have only one-Hitler.  I admire Hitler
 because he pulled his country together when
 it was in a terrible state in the early thirties.
 The situation here in South Vietnam is so
 desperate that one man would not be enough.
 We need four or five Hitlers in Vietnam.
 When his fellow countrymen were
 fighting for liberation against the French
 colonial oppressors from 1946 to Septem-
 ber 1954, where was Ky?  Not only was
 Ky one of the tories in the war for libera-
 tion in Vietnam at that time, as he was
 being trained in the French Air Force,
 but the startling fact is that 9 of the 10
 generals who overthrew the civilian re-
 gime at Saigon served with the French,
 fighting against the forces of the Na-
 tional Liberation Front, or Vietminh.
 We Americans have regarded ourselves
 as the most revolutionary people in the
 world. We revere those patriots who won
 the Revolutionary War against England.
 We have always held low opinions of the
 American tories of that time who op-
 posed those Americans who fought for
 the liberation of our country from colo-
 nial oppressors. However, we seem to be
 adhering at the present time to the tories
 in Vietnam.
 Unfortunately at present time our Na-
 tion in the estimation of heads of state
 of most Asiatic countries has become the
 neocolonial oppressor. We are carrying
 on with our military might where the
 French left off.  The United States has
 long been regarded as the most revolu-
 tionary nation in the world. We Ameri-
 cans revere the memory of those patriots
 who won the war for independence and
 then demanded that the first Congress
 write into our Constitution the first 10
 amendments which we affectionately
 term our Bill of Rights. In our Revolu-
 tionary War the tories fought against the
 patriots.
 We have alined ourselves directly with
 the tories of Vietnam in the civil war
 that is raging there. It is my hope that
 our President would disassociate himself
 from his involvement with Prime Minis-
 ter Ky. Ever since the Honolulu confer-
 ence earlier this year where the Com-
 mander in Chief of our Armed Forces
 embraced this egotistical Prime Minister
 he has been too big for his britches.
 Last October I interviewed him per-
 sonally and I have followed his opera-
 tions as best I can.  Now this man, who
 himself was born in Hanoi and presently
 holds a position of power in Saigon
 which was usurped by the general's coup,
 28, 1966
 apparently wants to go home.  He has
 even had the effrontery to state that
 war between the United States and Red
 China is inevitable within 5 or 10 years.
 Why wait, he says.  Talking as a native
 of what is termed North Vietnam he said
 ultimately the people of the North would
 overthrow the Communist regime there.
 Then he posed the question:
 Does the free world have the patience to
 aid and build South Vietnam for the neces-
 sary period of waiting?  If not, we must de-
 stroy the Communists in their lair-
 He said.  Then he said that he did
 not believe that the Chinese Communists
 would intervene directly in the Vietnam-
 ese war at this time.   He said, however,
 it was certain they would intervene di-
 rectly in Vietnam or elsewhere in Asia
 in 5 or 10 years unless they were stopped.
 Very definitely Ky should be removed
 as Prime Minister of South Vietnam.
 We  Americans should repudiate his
 statement that the U.S. Government
 should join in an allied invasion of North
 Vietnam and an armed conflict now with
 Communist China.  Administration of-
 ficials and Secretary of State Rusk
 should immediately dissociate our Gov-
 ernment from the irresponsible state-
 ments made by our South Vietnam pup-
 pot Ky.  If he wants so badly to return
 to Hanoi, let him do it on his own two
 feet and not by reason of the untimely
 death of thousands of killed and wounded
 young American fighting men presently
 involved in a miserable civil war in Viet-
 nam, a far-off country which is of no
 strategic importance whatever to the
 defense of the United States.
 FORTUNE MAGAZINE WARNS THAT
 ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, our
 economy is slowing down.   Despite a
 lingering tendency for prices to creep
 upward, the overall pace of economic
 activity is slowing dramatically.
 Instead of being worried about wheth-
 er to impose a restraint in the form of
 a tax increase, as so many were this
 spring, we ought to be making sure we
 do not sit on our hands as we head into
 a recession.
 In recent statements, I have cataloged
 in detail the movement of several eco-
 nomic indicators showing clearly that
 the steam is going out of the boom.
 Consumer demand has fallen.  The In-
 dex of Industrial Production and the
 gross national product have been in-
 creasing at far slower rates.                                                                                                   Housing
 starts have plunged sharply.
 An excellent, thorough review of the
 current economic situation has- just been
 published in the August issue of Fortune
 magazine. It begins:
 The change in the pace of economic ex-
 pansion is now unmistakable.  Most people
 welcome  it  as  a relief  from inflationary
 pressure. Many of the readjustments loom-
 ing up, however, look to be more painful
 than has been generally recognized.  Each
 month's new business statistics are revealing
 further deterioration in the prospects for
 underlying demand in the domestic econ-
 omy.  The figures begin to suggest a change
 in direction, not just a change in pace.

 being converted into a dollar deficit and
 a gold drain-while at the same time we
 are continuing to draft more of our
 American sons to send them to South

 It seems to me that we should reduce
 our troop commitments in Europe very
 drastically, and call on those countries
 which have greater gold reserves than
 we to assume a greater responsibility and
 a greater share of the burden in defend-
 ing themselves.
 Those are two things which can be
 done immediately.  Those things can be
 done, in my judgment, by executive de-
 cision; and then whatever is necessary in
 addition to that to bring some semblance
 of order into the high interest rates that
 are slowing down the economy of our
 country, and in my judgment will place
 hundreds of thousands of people out of
 jobs in the not too distant future, cer-
 tainly should be done.
 I compliment and commend my dis-
 tinguished fellow Senators for raising
 their voices in this matter.
 Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr.
 President, interest rates are of concern,
 or at least should be of concern, to every
 American.  But we should not overlook
 the fact that interest represents the cost
 of money, and when a commodity is in
 short supply, prices rise.  It so happens
 that there is a greater demand for money
 than the existing supply.
 One great contribution this Federal
 Government could make to reduce that
 excessive demand and thereby reduce in-
 terest rates, is in line with what the
 Senator from Georgia has just said; and
 that is, to stop trying to carry on all of
 the expansive Great Society spending
 programs  and  financing  them  with
 deficit spending.
 The Kennedy-Johnson administration,
 in the last 5 years, has spent $30 billion
 more than it has taken in, and $1.5 billion
 of our interest burden today goes to pay
 the interest costs on the deficits created
 by the Kennedy-Johnson administra-
 tion.
 There is one difference between the
 high interest rates today and the records
 of high interest rates in previous admin-
 RACE RIOTS IN CLEVELAND
 Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I have
 here a letter dated July 24, from an
 Edward A. Spelic, 2848 Lorain Avenue,
 Cleveland, Ohio.  The letter is a simple
 expression of what seems to be a humble
 citizen's view of problems confronting
 our metropolitan areas.  I wish to read
 the letter:
 Hon.  Senator   FRANK  LAUSCH$:  I  would
 like to know if you could recommend medals
 for bravery for all the police and firemen of
 the city of Cleveland, Ohio,  because the
 police and firemen this last week have been
 through hell because of these Communist-
 led race riots.  Also, if you are going to take
 up a collection for the President's daughter's
 wedding, how about a collection for the
 police and firemen who are trying to help
 save an American city called Cleveland, Ohio,
 from being destroyed?
 This letter has great significance: to me
 in  the  thought  that  it  expresses.
 Throughout the country, all too fre-
 quently, at the end of every riot, the
 charge is made of police brutality.
 It has been sought to lead public opin-
 ion into the belief that the culprits of
 the riots are innocent, and that the fire-
 men and especially the police are the
 guilty ones.
 On Tuesday, July 19, at a meeting in
 what is known as the J.F.K. Club, in the
 Hough Avenue area of Cleveland, a group
 was assembled.  In that group was pres-
 ent an individual who was a friend of
 the Government.
 The subject of discussion of the group
 was the development of ways and means
 to snipe at firemen trying to put out
 blazes, and at policemen maintaining law
 and order.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. LAUSCHE. I ask unanimous con-
 sent that I may have 3 additional
 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  While the meeting
 was in progress, policemen entered. With
 the policemen's entry, the gathering was
 dispersed.  Hence it is not known what
 ultimately happened in the development
 of a design and plan for sniping at police
 16625
 and firemen.  All we know is that while
 the firemen were facing the fire in the
 buildings, they were also facing the fire
 sent forth from the gun barrels of the
 rioters.
 The time has come. Mr. President,
 when we had better stop denouncing po-
 lice and firemen.  At this point, I wish to
 take exception to what my colleague
 from Ohio stated about the Ohio Na-
 tional Guard.  He stated that some of
 the members of the Ohio National Guard
 were trigger happy.
 It is a tragedy that we had to bring
 them in.  They were there in the face
 of danger. They performed valiant and
 proper service for the maintenance of law
 and order.
 I thank Mr. Spelic for his letter.  I
 cannot start a collection for the police
 or the firemen.  I cannot secure awards
 for them for their courage and their
 adherence to duty.
 I bow and express my gratitude as a
 citizen of Cleveland to the police, the
 firemen,  and    the  National  Guard,
 who brought order to Cleveland, after
 96 buildings had been destroyed, some
 wholly and others partially, after vio-
 lence had run rampant, and Govern-
 ment had been defied.
 I regret to say this, but, in my opin-
 ion, Cleveland, Rochester, and Brooklyn
 are  clearly  training  grounds for  the
 worst that is yet to come.  There are
 drills, trials, and maneuvers. Unless we
 back our Government and demand that
 the full force of law be used, including
 the police, the firemen, the National
 Guard, and the morale of the people,
 there is no foretelling what the end will
 be.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 some years ago I was chief criminal pros-
 ecuting attorney of Cuyahoga County,
 Ohio.
 I believed then and I believe now that
 punishment, like a shadow, should follow
 the commission of any offense against
 law and order in our country.
 I am, of course, opposed to mob vio-
 lence, whether it be in Mississippi, Ala-
 bama, Ohio, or any other place in our
 Nation. On Tuesday of this week, I spoke
 out at some length on the disorders in
 Cleveland and on the frustrations, the
 helplessness, and hopelessness of those
 who live in what we term the Hough
 Avenue area of Cleveland. I mentioned
 their pent up frustrations which finally
 erupted in violence.
 We in Cleveland have always been
 proud of our great city.  It is a melting
 pot of all ethnic groups which have come
 here from the old country, seeking lib-
 erty and seeking to free themselves from
 oppression and to escape the hopeless sit-
 uation they faced in the old country.
 I stand by every statement I made on
 Tuesday in a rather lengthy speech which
 was referred to by the distinguished sen-
 ior Senator from Ohio. I shall be happy
 to have any of my colleagues read that
 speech in its entirety, and not just take
 one sentence out of context:
 In my opinion, the police of the city of
 Cleveland in some instances were guilty
 of acts of violence and of unnecessary
 brutality toward those who were vio-
 lating the laws, burning buildings, rioting

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE            July 28, 1966
 Confronted with such self-evident facts,
 the civil rights leaders tend to retort with
 the argument that if they did not promote
 civil disobedience, nothing would be done to
 Improve the squalid surroundings in which
 many Negroes live.  Anyone contemplating
 civil  disobedience, however,  in a society
 whose existence depends on respect for law
 is obligated to ask himself what alternatives
 exist before he turns to that last resort.
 Here again, the President put it well: "The
 ballot box, the neighborhood communities,
 the political and civil rights organizations-
 aye the means by which Americans express
 their resentment against intolerable condi-
 tions.  They are designed to reform society,
 not to rip it apart."
 And the truth is that many individual
 Negroes, even before the past decade's civil
 rights legislation, have come up from poverty
 and gotten out of the "ghetto."  (The term,
 incidentally, is a loaded one; by connota-
 tion if not denotation it suggests the false-
 hood that some governmental authority is
 ,compelling Negroes to stay in segregated,
 walled-in areas.)
 Many more can be expected to make a
 decent living for themselves without the
 leaders having to rip up society.  What can-
 not be stressed too often, and what the ro-
 manticists fail to understand, is that for the
 most part they will have to do It on their
 own; the leaders would be better occupied
 helping them help themselves than In cre-
 ating the climate for riots.  Even then,
 there will be some members of any society,
 regardless of color, who for one reason or
 another will not be able to make a go of

 dent Johnson's significant speech on our
 obligations in Asia, and the early re-
 action is strongly favorable.
 I have here editorials from three
 newspapers-the Baltimore Sun, Phila-
 delphia Inquirer, and Washington Eve-
 ning Star-praising various aspects of
 the President's speech to the American
 Alumni Council.
 Each comments with approval on his
 call to Communist China for an atmos-
 phere of conciliation.
 There is firm agreement with his dec-
 laration that the United States Is a Pa-
 cific power with responsibilities that
 cannot be shirked in Asia.
 And there is hope that Hanoi and
 Peking will get the point.
 This was a message reflecting our de-
 termination and our fervent desire for
 peace,
 I ask that these editorials discussing
 ,the President's speech be inserted in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objections, the edito-
 rials were ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Baltimore (Md.) Sun,
 July 14, 1966]
 THE UNITED STATES IN ASIA
 That the United States Is a Pacific power,
 as President Johnson called in his speech
 on Asia, must be obvious to everybody, in-
 cluding the Chinese.  We did not at some
 moment make a decision to become a Pa-
 cific power; we were forced into becoming
 one by the interests of our own national
 security, and by the vacuum left in that part
 of the globe after World War If.  If a date is
 to be set, we can say that on December 7,
 1941,  the  Japanese  made  inevitable  the
 emergence of the United States as a major
 factor in all developments in the Pacific,
 among the islands of its seas and on the
 mainlands that border it.
 It was on the fact of American power that
 the President built his examination of Asia
 and his view of its future.  It is true, as he
 said, that Asia is now the crucial arena of
 "man's striving for independence and order,"
 and true that if peace cannot be established
 there it cannot be secure anywhere.   Mr.
 Johnson's listing of heartening signs in Asia,
 from Indonesia through Japan, and of ex-
 amples of Asian cooperation, from Manila
 to the valley of the Mekong, was an impres-
 sive list.  And his call to China to accept
 an atmosphere of conciliation was fervent
 and eloquent.
 If the Chinese cannot be expected to see
 the sense of this, and to respond soon in
 the same spirit, still most of our allies will
 follow the President this far, in thorough
 agreement.  What they might argue about Is
 his statement that the Asia he sees so well
 "is the new Asia that Is taking shape behind
 our defense of South Vietnam."
 In the eyes of some of our allies, the
 defense of South Vietnam, while it may
 be necessary, is but one element of many
 in the Asian condition today.   And then
 there is a question of how power is to be
 applied.  Some of our allies believe that the
 very fact of the existence of vast American
 power, by sea and air, and if worst should
 come to worst, In nuclear terms, might suf-
 fice as a deterrent to the Chinese, without
 an American ground presence.
 But would it serve further to persuade
 the   Chinese   toward   conciliation?   And
 where lies the point beyond which American
 efforts at conciliation would be taken by the
 Chinese as a sign of weakness, and by now-
 friendlier Asians as a signal of betrayal?
 This is the kind of tortured question the
 makers of policy  have  constantly to ask
 themselves.  To pretend that the answers are
 easy is to assume an omniscience no one can
 possess.
 [From  the   Philadelphia  (Pa.)   Inquirer,
 July 14, 19661
 THE PRESIDENT'S Os         a OF PEACE
 President Johnson's call for reconciliation
 with Communist China and for peace with
 North Vietnam marks  an    important turn
 in U.S. policy in Asia. The President, in his
 televised address, made it clear that, if the
 proffer of peace is rejected by Hanoi and
 Peking, the war in Vietnam may last a long
 time.
 Mr. Johnson,  It  Is evident, is  stepping
 beyond  the  previously  stressed   policy of
 "containment    without  Isolation" of  Red
 China and is looking beyond the present
 conflict in Vietnam to the situation In Asia
 after the war ends.
 "A peaceful mainland China Is essential to
 a peaceful Asia," he said.  "A hostile China
 must be discouraged from aggression.  A
 misguided China must be encouraged toward
 understanding of the  outside  world and
 toward policies of peaceful cooperation."
 "The  peace  we seek in  Asia," he said
 further, "is a peace of conciliation." He
 added that he did not mean a peace of con-
 quest, or the simple absence of armed hos-
 tilities, but a settlement based on a broader
 concept of international relations.
 He talked of the peace that could be sus-
 tained through international trade; through
 the free flow of people and Ideas; through
 "the full participation by all nations in an
 International community under law."
 Meanwhile, there Is the wax in Vietnam.
 The President defined the American position
 in blunt terms directed at Hanoi: "Victory
 for your armies Is Impossible.  You cannot
 drive us from South Vietnam by force, The
 minute that you realize that a military vic-
 tory Is out of the question, and turn from
 the use of force, you will find us ready to
 reciprocate.  We want to end the fighting.
 We want to bring our men home."
 President Johnson's message to the Com-
 munists was one of peace, backed by de-
 termination to press on in Vietnam, if our
 peace offers get nowhere.
 Will Hanoi and Peking get the message?
 Past history furnishes little ground for op-
 timism.                                                                                                                                  We still must make the effort.
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star,
 July 14,19661
 AMERICA IN ASIA
 President Johnson has held out the hand
 of conciliation to Red China,-but the chances
 are that the response will continue to be
 hostile as long as the Mao Tse-tung hard-
 liners remain in power.  Not until a younger,
 less  doctrinaire group takes over will  a
 change for the better In Sino-American re-
 lations be likely.
 Meanwhile, however, as the President has
 Indicated to the American Alumni Council,
 measures can be taken by the United States,
 in concert with the free Asians, to prove that
 aggression is a losing game and to bring
 nearer the day when the Chinese Commu-
 nists will be persuaded to come out of their
 self-imposed  isolation,  abandon force  and
 cooperate with neighboring lands-and with
 America-to  promote  peace and economic
 progress throughout  Asia.   Among     other
 things, our government might well go along
 with proposals offering Peking a seat in the
 United Nations, provided of course that this
 would not affect the membership or security
 of the other China, Taiwan.
 In any event, with more emphasis than any
 of his predecessors, Mr. Johnson has pro-
 claimed to the Chinese and the rest of the
 world that the United States is a Pacific
 power determined to meet its obligations in
 Asia.   He has pretty well demolished the
 arguments  of  those  domestic  critics who
 hold that Europe, not the Far East, is Amer-
 ica's main "sphere of interest" and that the
 Asians can be safely forgotten. In the Pres-
 ident's words, "We are bounded not by one
 but by two oceans-and whether by aircraft
 or ship, satellite or missile, the Pacific is as
 crossable as the Atlantic ... The economic
 network of this shrinking globe is too inter-
 twined-the basic hopes of men are too re-
 lated-and the: possibility of common disas-
 ter is too real-for us to ignore threats to
 peace in Asia ... Asia is no longer sitting
 outside the door of the Twentieth Century.
 She is here, in the same world with us, to be
 either our partner or our problem."
 The President, in effect, has given Asia
 a status at least equal to Europe's in terms
 of its bearing on our country's well-being.
 Other Americans have made the same point
 In the past, but not so effectively.  We think
 Mr. Johnson Is altogether right.
 POLITICS AND THE FBI
 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, a great
 deal has been said in recent months
 about the attempted eavesdropping by
 agents of the Federal Government in my
 State of Nevada and many other places.
 These incidents have been carefully and
 systematically brought to the surface
 largely through the efforts of the dis-
 tinguished junior Senator from Missouri
 and the staff of the subcommittee he
 heads which has been holding hearings
 on the subject.
 Of late, a distinction has been made
 between the term "wiretapping" which
 was the term used in the 1934 law and
 the term "bugging" which represents an

 with recognition of the existing cultural
 values to be preserved.
 When I first announced that a grant had
 been received for public housing here at
 Leech Lake, one commentator raised the
 question whether such an effort did not mis-
 takenly create an enclave of Indians on the
 teservation.  He asked whether we weren't
 making reservation life too attractive, and
 whether we    might  not better  build the
 houses in cities to which Indians were mi-
 grating.  I think that these questions miss
 the point.
 Some of Minnesota's Indians want to leave
 the reservation now, and some will want to
 leave in the future.  Our Government ought
 to be able to help house and train them for
 life off of the reservation.  But many others
 want to stay on the reservation, and I don't
 think that Indians or any other citizen of
 this country ought to be told that they have
 to leave their home environment and move
 a few, hundred miles to enjoy the basics of
 good housing and good education and a job.
 We shouldn't treat any citizen that way.
 There Is even more to it.  Legally, the In-
 dian has been free to leave the reservation
 for years.  But this is a terribly hollow right
 when the life he leaves has failed-by lack of
 housing, education, health and social serv-
 lees-to prepare him for life in the modern
 economy of our cities.  The sad unemploy-
 melit figures of Minnesota's Indians both on
 and off the reservation testify to that fact.
 So far, the Indian has been "free" to remain
 in poverty on the reservation., or to go to live
 unemployed In a city slum.  This choice is
 the  indefensible  product  of  a  bankrupt
 policy.
 So I think that there is only one reason-
 able direction open to us,                           It is to build on
 the reservations the kind of economy which
 will support jobs for Indians, the kind of
 housing which will permit a healthy life,
 and, above all, the kind of education which
 will motivate and provide skills for a produc-
 tive job.
 Our effort must place the reservation itself,
 and the Indians on it, in the mainstream of
 our economy.  Then there will be real free-
 dom,  Freedom to leave the reservation, or to
 stay on it. And all America will be the better
 for it.
 Such a program of economic and educa-
 tional development will have to come, but
 it is not here yet.  It can't be worked out
 from a distance, but must be done with initi-
 ative and cooperation of the Indian commu-
 nity here.  It can't be the Washington plan;
 It has to be your plan.  And let's not fool
 ourselves-it isn't going to happen overnight.
 It will take long, hard work by all of us,
 Indian and non-Indian. I want to help, and
 hope that you will ask me to.  It Js a hard
 job, but it can be done. And it will be worth
 It to make the reservation a good place to
 live and work.  We'd better get to it.  As
 President Kennedy said in 1963: "The Amer-
 ican Indians hold a romantic grip on our
 Imaginations, but I hope that they also hold
 a practical grip upon our efforts."
 REMEDIAL        READING             RECOM-
 MJ INDED FOR JOHN BIRCH SOCI-
 ETY
 Mr. McINTYRE.  Mr. President, on
 June 6, t informed the Senate that I saw
 no need to go to extremes to discredit the
 John Birch Society because I thought
 that that organization was perfectly ca-
 pable of discrediting itself.
 The occasion for that remark was the
 receipt of a letter from a John Birch
 Society official who accused me of going
 to extremes in an attempt to discredit
 the society. The extreme to which I had
 allegedly gone was the insertion in the
 RECORD of an editorial published in a
 newspaper in my State, the Rochester
 Courier, of Rochester, N.H., commenting
 on the aims of the John Birch Society.
 It was my opinion at that time that
 the John Birch Society could be relied
 upon to discredit itself, and my opinion
 turned out to be justified.  I had the
 letter which I had, received printed in
 the RECORD for June 6, and commented
 upon one phrase which seemed to me to
 illustrate the society's philosophy. That
 phrase was :
 A benevolent dictatorship clearly implies
 complete justice and complete freedom.
 Mr. President, the letter writers of the
 John Birch Society seem to want to
 amuse themselves in their idle time, and
 this morning my mail contained yet an-
 other letter from the same society offi-
 cial who had written me before.
 It is addressed to:
 DEAR SENATOR MCINTYRE's GHOST READER-
 And it goes, in relevant part, as fol-
 lows :
 On May 24, 1966, senator McINTYaE in-
 serted a scurrilous newspaper editorial in
 the RECORD.  It was from the Rochester (New
 Hampshire) Courier, and In essence accused
 the John Birch Society of proposing "dic-
 tatorship" as the ideal form of government
 for the United States of America.
 I replied to the newspaper with a correc-
 tion, and sent a copy to the Senator, which
 he inserted in the RECORD on June sixth, to-
 gether with -his own strange remarks.  Since
 the Senator obviously cannot read, and I do
 not know your name, please excuse the
 anonymous salutation,
 The letter then goes on to some more
 material which is not particularly in-
 formative, and concludes as follows:
 Enclosed is $1, which I hope will Initiate
 a fund to send Senator McINTYRE to a re-
 medial reading class.
 Now, I happen to think this is a most
 intriguing contribution.  I am particu-
 larly interested In the fact that the John
 Birch  Society  recommends  remedial
 reading, in view of the very clear fact
 that the John Birch Society official who
 wrote to me is apparently unable to read
 the text of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 As can be noted from the first para-
 graph of his letter to me, he refers to a
 newspaper editorial from the Rochester,
 N.H.,, Record.  I am certain that, with
 only the most rudimentary reading abil-
 ity, this gentleman would have been able
 to glean from the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
 of either May 24 or June 6 that the edi-
 torial  in  question  came  from  the
 Rochester, N.H., Courier.
 As, this letter indicates, it is the John
 Birch Society official who has trouble
 reading.
 I stated a few weeks ago, as I restated
 today, that the John Birch Society was
 perfectly capable of discrediting itself.
 Once again, the society has proved its
 own point, by sending me a letter about
 remedial  reading  which  conclusively
 shows the society's own problems with
 reading.  I feel that this is the most
 generous interpretation which can be
 placed on this matter, although at least
 one member of my staff has suggested
 that this error merely shows the John
 Birch Society's careless attitude toward
 facts.
 In any event, I emerge from this cor-
 respondence $1 the richer, and, consid-
 16647
 eying the source of the contribution, I
 feel that this is truly an embarrassment
 of riches.  I have decided to donate this
 contribution to the Anti-Defamation
 League, where the funds gleaned from
 the dues of John Birch Society members,
 I am certain, may be used to help stem
 oncoming waves of extremism.
 A TIME FOR CANDOR
 Mr. ERVIN.  Mr. President, the Wall
 Street Journal for July 27, 1966, carried
 an editorial in which the writer made
 some timely observations in respect to
 the rioting and looting which has been
 going on in some of our major cities and
 the attempts of some persons to justify
 it.  I ask unanimous consent that such
 article be printed at this point in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed as follows:
 A  TIME FOR CANDOR
 This summer's harvest of horror--murder,
 arson, looting in city after city, week after
 week-is  prompting  ever  more  insistent
 questioning.  Why?  Who   Is  to   blame?
 Strangely enough, the response of a good
 many people is that it is not the fault of
 the rioters but of the general society and, if
 you please, the Federal Government.
 One editorialist was moved to express the
 sentiment in the following extremist fash-
 ion: "The (Federal) housing program is too
 small.  The poverty program is too small.  It
 is not the riots in the slums, but these lane
 and inadequate programs that are the real
 disgrace of the richest nation on earth."
 We submit that attitudes of that sort are
 an unmerited rebuke to America and the
 millions whose hard work and hard thinking
 have made it the most abundant and just
 nation on earth.  We are glad that President
 Johnson, at least, is not thus beguiled; while
 commiserating   with  the  plight  of  slum-
 dwellers, he is forthright in his condemna-
 tion of riots that tear at the very fabric of
 of the community.    "Our country can abide
 civil protest . . . it cannot abide civil via-
 lance."
 Let us.look a little more closely at the
 catalog of charges against the "inadequacy"
 of Federal efforts.
 Large-scale Federal housing aid for low-
 Income families has been going on for many
 years at a cost of many billions in tax dol-
 lars.   It has failed Indeed, but Its inade-
 quacy is not in terms of cost but in terms
 of concept.  The same applies to the bulk
 of the activities launched by the more re-
 cent antipoverty program.
 The fundamental conceptual flaw is a sen-
 timental view, reminiscent of Rousseau, of
 the nature of man.  According to this inter-
 pretation, man is inherently good and per-
 fectible and is held down only by the ex-
 ternal forces of society.  Put him in pleasant
 surroundings, or give him enough money,
 and all will be well.
 The inescapable corollary Is that the so-
 ciety rather than the individual is respon-
 sible for his behavior, however ambition-
 less, venal or criminal.  The doctrine has
 been preached with so much vigor, and not
 only in connection with civil rights, in con-
 temporary America that it is hardly surpris-
 ing to find some of the listeners taking it
 literally.
 Experience, to put it mildly, lends little
 credence  to the  romantic view  of  man's
 nature; left entirely to our  own devices,
 relatively                    few  of  us  would  qualify for
 sainthood.                     In  that context, the political
 triumph of the American design of 200 years
 ago is that it engineered a maximum of per-
 sonal liberty with a minimum of govern-
 mental compulsion.  But the order is there,
 and it has to be, else the design falls.

 CAPTURED U.S. PILOTS IN NORTH
 VIETNAM
 Mr. JACKSON.   Mr. President, an-
 other indication of public outrage over
 Hanoi's mistreatment of captured U.S.
 pilots  appears  in  the  Philadelphia
 Inquirer.
 The North Vietnamese have paraded
 these valiant airmen through the streets
 of Hanoi and threatened to execute them
 as war criminals.  Should they think
 such a monstrous act would discourage
 the American military effort, the Inquirer
 asserts in an editorial, they would be
 making one of history's monumental
 errors.
 Secretary of State Rusk has warned
 that we would consider the abuse of
 prisoners held in North Vietnam as a
 very grove development. The newspaper
 suggests it would unite the country be-
 hind a hugely stepped-up policy of force
 in Vietnam.
 I request that its editorial be included
 in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 IF THEY KILL CAPTURED FLIERS
 The North Vietnamese should have it
 spelled out for them in unmistakable terms
 just what the consequences will be if they
 carry out their threats to try and to execute
 captured American fliers as war criminals.
 Ifr they think for one. moment that such
 a monstrous act of reprisal would put a stop
 to American bombings and otherwise discour-
 age American military effort, they are making
 one of history's monumental errors.
 The American public  has  already been
 shocked by the mistreatment given captured
 fliers by the North Vietnamese Communists.
 It has been angered by pictures showing the
 shackled prisoners  paraded through men-
 acing crowds on the streets of Hanoi.
 But this reaction will be nothing com-
 pared to the horror that will sweep this coun-
 try if the helpless captives are thrown to the
 firing squads after drumhead trials.
 Secretary of State Rusk has warned that
 the U.S. would view as a "grave development
 indeed" the abuse of prisoners held in North
 Vietnam, and will insist on humane treat-
 ment under the Geneva accords.
 If Ho Chi Minh does not want this coun-
 try united behind a hugely stepped-up policy
 of force in Vietnam, he had better call off
 his would-be killers of prisoners before it is
 too late.
 FOREIGN AID
 Mr. ERVIN.  Mr. President, pursuant
 to a request made of me by it, I wrote
 a letter to the Forensic Quarterly on
 April 26, 1966, in which I set forth my
 views in respect to foreign aid.  A copy
 of this letter was printed in the Forensic
 Quarterly for May 1966.
 By way of explanation of my vote
 against the foreign aid authorization bill,
 I ask unanimous consent that a copy of
 this letter be printed at this point in the
 body of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE OPINION OF SENATOR SAM J. Ea lie, JR.
 American opinion is now forcing a close
 reappraisal of our foreign aid policies.  The
 time has come when the American people
 must adopt a harsh test of self-interest in
 dealing with foreign aid.  Earlier, American
 aid sought nothing greater than to provide
 the war-torn countries of the world with
 greater economic stability in order to help
 these nations resist communist pressures.
 At that time this policy served our self-in-
 terest and the interest of humanity.  How-
 ever, now that the program of rehabilitation
 of Western Europe and Japan has been com-
 pleted, there is no reason, twenty years after
 the Second World War, for the United States
 to be giving away over three billion dollars
 annually forforeign aid.
 Under our Constitution the power to tax
 and to appropriate monies raised by taxation
 can be exercised by the Congress only for
 a public purpose.  Congress does not have
 the power to spend beyond the ambit of
 this constitutional authorization.  Therefore,
 in order to justify the Congressional appro-
 priations for foreign aid programs on the
 grounds that they are for a valid public pur-
 pose, these programs must strengthen either
 the economic, or military, or international
 position of the United States.  Our present
 foreign aid program does not have a valid
 public purpose because it cannot be justi-
 fied on either of these grounds, and for this
 reason I cannot support the Administration's
 present foreign aid policies.  I maintain that
 our foreign aid programs do not aid the
 United States or the free world. On the con-
 trary, the economy of the United States on
 which the defense of the free world depends,
 is actually weakened by these expenditures.
 Foreign aid amounts to a substantial part
 ,of our federal budget. Therefore, because of
 our seemingly permanent policy of deficit
 financing, our government has actually bor-
 rowed a substantial amount of the money
 which the administrators of post-war foreign
 aid programs have scattered among the na-
 tions of this earth.  By increasing our budget
 deficits, foreign aid dollars have contributed
 to monetary inflation In this country.  The
 buying power of our dollar constantly is
 being eroded.  If this continues, our econ-
 omy will be irreparably damaged.
 Our dollars have found their way into
 many foreign treasuries and now these for-
 eign governments are clamoring at our doors
 demanding gold in repayment for these dol-
 lars.  These foreign aid dollars are claims on
 the goods and services produced by the in-
 dustries of the United States and no one can
 say that the resources of this country are not
 being drained when we give away dollars
 abroad and they return as demands on our
 nation's wealth.
 For example, since World War II we have
 given France approximately nine billion dol-
 lars in foreign aid.  This does not include
 the other billions which ground their way
 into the French economy through the main-
 tenance of our military forces in France. Now
 the French government is demanding pay-
 ment of gold for this money which has been
 drained from our economy and added to our
 national  debt.  Our balance  of payments
 dilemma which has largely resulted from our
 foreign aid policies, weakens the value of the
 dollar and the public welfare of the country
 is, of course, damaged.  This is In direct
 violation of the requirement that money
 Congress appropriates for any purpose, in-
 cluding foreign aid, must be spent in a way
 to aid the public welfare.
 No matter what the currently fashionable
 Keynesian economists say, there is a limit to
 government spending and if we are to con-
 tinue budget deficits, certainly we have an
 obligation to our own poor superior to any
 obligation we assume year after year to care
 for the poor of other nations.  We should
 satisfy this superior obligation before we
 look for other countries to assist.
 Foreign aid does not strengthen the mili-
 tary position of the United States.  Actually,
 it impairs the build-up of our own forces on
 which the survival of the United States and
 the free world may depend.   Many times
 military leaders have come before the Con-
 gress and requested authorizations for na-
 tional defense purposes In excess of those
 asked by the civilian authorities.  They felt
 the appropriations were necessary to main-
 tain our ground forces at proper levels and
 to equip them with modern weapons.  Civil-
 ian authorities have always said on these
 occasions that the Congress ought not take
 any such action because it was essential to
 keep the United States fiscally sound and
 the actions urged by the military men were
 beyond the financial capacity of the United
 States.   For example,  we have  been told
 that the United States was not financially
 able to develop both the B70 bomber and
 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The B70
 project was dropped and while no one doubts
 the necessity for the .developing intercon-
 tinental ballistic missiles, it Is also a military
 fact that the B70 bomber had a very neces-
 sary place in  our arsenal  because                                                                                                                                of its
 flexibility.   Another example is our parsi-
 monious development of an anti-missile mis-
 sile which would be so vital to our defense
 against a hostile intercontinental ballistic
 missile attack.
 Every time members of the Senate Com-
 mittee on Armed Services have insisted on
 these projects, the response of the Depart-
 ment of Defense has been that the United
 States does not have even the financial re-
 sources available to provide our ground forces
 with modernized weapons.  In reality, the
 money that has not been available for main-
 taining adequate ground forces and obtain-
 ing essential weapons has been devoted to
 foreign aid.
 The inevitable conclusions one must draw
 from these facts is that foreign aid has ac-
 tually  prevented  the  United States  from
 building up the armed forces and acquiring
 weapons which are absolutely essential for
 the survival of the United States and the
 free world.
 Also, running directly against our military
 strength Is the military and economic aid
 we have given our non-allies.  Millions of
 dollars have been given to aid countries such
 as Yugoslavia and Egypt.  This aid could
 certainly come back to haunt us much as
 the scrap metal we gave Japan before the
 Second World War.

 POLITICS AND THE FBI
 (By William F. Buckley, Jr.)
 The FBI Is in trouble because an agent in
 Las Vegas bugged a suspected criminal back
 in 1963 and Sen. Boast KENNEDY, asked on a
 network  television  program  whether  he
 knew, as Attorney General at the time, that
 the gentleman in Las Vegas was being wire-
 tapped, replied that he did not.  That reply
 raised the question whether the FBI had
 acted illegally. If so, the situation is scan-
 dalous Indeed, it being the job of the FBI to
 enforce the law, not to break it.
 The relevant background: There is, under
 the law, a distinction between "wiretapping"
 and "bugging." There is no reason why this
 should be so, except that wiretapping was
 the earlier of the two inventions, and Con-
 gress acted on it, but has not got around to
 acting on the other.
 In 1934, Congress passed a law regulating
 the use of the wiretap by Federal crime-
 prevention agencies. The law was defined by
 supplementary executive decrees in 1940, and
 again in 1965.  The governing regulations
 are that the FBI may use a wiretap only in
 cases involving the national security (e.g.,
 spies), threatening bodily harm (e.g., Mur-
 der, Inc.), or life and limb (e.g., kidnaping).
 But in each case the Attorney General must
 personally authorize the wiretap, and any
 prosecutions that develop as the result of
 overheard evidence may not Introduce that
 evidence in any court of law.
 Not knowing that technology would come
 around with sophisticated devices that would
 permit eavesdropping through the olive in a
 suspect's martini, Congress dealt exclusively
 with the wiretap.  The FBI, however, has
 proceeded all along on the assumption that
 the rules governing the wiretap ought to
 regulate the use of the bug; i.e., the FBI has
 not taken advantage of the opening left by
 Congress.  But this does not mean that Sen.
 KENNEDY failed to take advantage of that
 difference. Indeed, there are those who be-
 lieve that that is exactly what the Senator
 did when asked whether he had authorized
 the Las Vegas "wiretap"  No, he said--a
 technically correct answer inasmuch as there
 In the absence of an elucidation from the
 former Attorney General, one is left to spec-
 ulate.  It is reasonable to suppose that J.
 Edgar Hoover would not jeopardize his repu-
 tation or that of the FBI In pursuit of a felon
 in Las Vegas, and it is unreasonable to sup-
 pose that if asked permission to use the bug,
 Attorney General KENNEDY would have de-
 nied it, since he has never denied using the
 tap during his tenure.
 Perhaps the Senator's memory is defective,
 Perhaps he sought refuge in the technicality.
 In due course the matter should be cleared
 up.  One supposes that the FBI, which Is a
 highly efficient organization, could, if abso-
 lutely necessary, prove that Attorney General
 KENNEDY had knowledge of the Las Vegas
 incident.  One doubts it will come to that.
 There is left a general issue of consider-
 able importance.  Reasonable folk agree that
 the FBI should utilize all technological in-
 ventions available to it In order to safeguard
 the national security and to frustrate the
 assassin or the kidnaper.   The trouble is
 that once it sets up a bug, the FBI becomes
 a sort of omnium-gatherum, because the bug
 does not distinguish between conversation
 about how to steal a state secret, and con-
 versation about how to make contact with a
 lady of easy virtue.
 Inevitably, other branches of the Federal
 Government hunger to know whether the
 bug has picked up information of particular
 interest to it.  For instance, Internal Reve-
 nue.
 At the moment a petitioner, Fred Black
 Jr., has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to
 overturn his conviction as a tax dodger on
 grounds that the prosecution had available
 to it information gleaned by an FBI bug.
 The Government has maintained that noth-
 ing got up by the bug was used in the Gov-
 ernment's case.  All very well.  But the fact
 remains that the Attorney General author-
 ized the transmission of FBI-bugged infor-
 mation to Internal Revenue, and that flouts
 the intent of the 1934 law.
 One can hardly blame Mr. Hoover for the
 communication of the bugged information.
 He did only what his superior-once again,
 Attorney General KENNEDY-Ordered.  But
 surely a law should be passed, and one as-
 sumes the FBI would welcome it, to the ef-
 fect that no information should be given to
 collateral divisions of the Government which
 is picked up by wire tap, unless it Is neces-
 sary to prevent acts of violence.
 NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS
 Mr. KENNEDY of New York.  Mr.
 President, employment figures for the
 month of June show a heartening rise
 in the number of jobs held by teenagers.
 The more than 2 million youths who
 found jobs last month will be learning
 skills and accumulating earnings to help
 themselves and their families and in
 many cases, to enable the youths to re-
 turn to school in the fall.
 Part of this success can be traced to
 the Federal Government's efforts to en-
 courage private industry, community or-
 ganizations and public agencies to hire
 youths.  The most outstanding of these
 efforts has been the Neighborhood Youth
 Corps  program  which  put  575,000
 youngsters to work in the past year.
 Neighborhood Youth Corps is making
 it possible for young people who cannot
 afford to stay in school to continue on             RAISES ASPIRATION
 with their education by offering them      Regusters called the Smithsonian program
 part-time jobs.  It helps those who have                "the beet in Washington" and said he knows
 had to drop out of school to get a job                  of no equivalent in the United States.
 and develop a useful and needed. skill.                 "It raises the general aspiration level," he
 said "Most kids never even knew these jobs
 in Washington.  Under a Neighborhood
 Youth Corps grant and in cooperation
 with Washington's United Planning Or-
 ganization, the Smithsonian is training
 40 youths in skills needed in museums
 and laboratories.
 The Washington Post recently pub-
 lished an article about the program.
 This kind of project demonstrates that
 training of this kind is needed, can be
 used, and will offer many of our young-
 sters an exciting and rich future.  I ask
 unanimous consent that the Post article
 be printed in the RECORD.

 SMITHSONIAN         OPERATES  ANTIPOVERTY  UNIT,
 Too
 (By Stuart Auerbach)
 A  19-year-old  Washington,          girl  whose
 horizons once stretched no farther than a
 clerical job bent over a microscope in a lab-
 oratory at the Smithsonian Institution and
 tossed out $50 words that only a botanist
 could understand.
 On another floor in the same building, sev-
 eral youths were making silk screen prints
 for some of the Smithsonian's new exhibits
 and two sisters were carving up a penguin
 with scalpels to prepare it for scientific study.
 They are among 40 youths being trained in
 skills that are in great demand by museums
 and laboratories in a small but remarkably
 successful anti-poverty program.
 STARTED LAST JULY
 The program was started last July by S.
 Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Institution,
 under a Neighborhood Youth Corps grant
 and in cooperation with the United Planning
 Organization.
 The Labor Department supplied funds for
 26 youths to work at the Smithsonian.
 Trainees work 32 hours a week and earn $1.25
 an hour.
 Many officials were dubious that the youths
 could fit into the Smithsonian's atmosphere.
 Now, however, officials at both the Smith-
 sonian and UPO are loud in praise of the
 program.
 "Rather than bring these kids in and have
 them cut grass and pull weeds, we decided
 we would give them meaningful jobs," said
 Jack Whitelaw, who heads the program for
 the Smithsonian.
 FEW DROP OUT
 Most of the 26 who started at the Institu-
 tion last July have graduated to other jobs
 as a result of their experience.   Very few
 have dropped from the program.
 "There is some kind of adhesive here that
 seems to hold people," said Don Regusters,
 coordinator of out-of-school programs for
 UPO who was counselor for the Smithsonian
 project.
 The training given at the Smithsonian pre-
 pares the youths for jobs in other museums,
 store display departments and in scientific
 laboratories, Regusters said.
 "It not only helps them find jobs," said
 Whitelaw, "it gives them a sense of working
 on something important.   When they are
 ready to go out and get a job, they can offer
 references from some of the Nation's leading
 scientists.  It's a bit different than giving
 the name of a couple of high school teachers."

 CONGRESS   SHOULD   DENOUNCE
 POSSIBLE   TRIAL  OF AMERICAN
 AIRMEN IN NORTH VIETNAM
 (Mr. LANGEN was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. LANGEN.  Mr. Speaker, of grave
 concern to Members of Congress and,
 indeed, every American citizen is the
 news that U.S. military personnel are
 being help captive in Vietnam.  It has
 been implied that the captured American
 airmen might be brought to trial by the
 'Communist regime of North Vietnam.
 For this reason I have joined my col-
 leagues in introducing a House concur-
 rent resolution to make clear that the
 people of the United States condemn any
 trial, punishment, or execution of these
 servicemen.
 Our strong and unwavering position in
 this matter must be forthrightly com-
 municated to the leadership of North
 Vietnam and to the governments of for-
 countries which lend aid and com-
 eign
 fort to Communist aggression in South
 Vietnam.  Unless the Communist re-
 gime of North Vietnam adheres to the
 Geneva Conventions of 1949, the accepted
 concepts oI international law and stand-
 ards of international behavior, the op-
 portunity for achievement of a just and
 secure peace in Vietnam and southeast
 Asia will be diminished..
 Therefore, every effort must be made
 to prevent Hanoi from undertaking in-
 humanitarian acts in connection with the
 captured American servicemen. It is my
 earnest desire that the Congress will take
 expeditious action to dramatize the con-
 viction and concern of the American
 people in this crucial situation.
 NEW   YORK   MEDICAID - "THE
 GREAT TREASURY ROBBERY OF
 1966"
 (Mr. BATTIN (at the request of Mr.
 REINECKE) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. BATTIN.  Mr. Speaker, in my
 newsletter of June 24, 1966, I discussed
 the New York State Medicaid program.
 Since that time I have had numerous re-
 quests for copies and under unanimous
 consent I place it in the body of the
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:
 Dear Friends: The total welfare'state may
 be nearer than we think.  A bulletin pub-
 lished by the Mount Sinai Hospital of New
 the finest complete medical care is now free I"
 A note in the bulletin adds that:
 "This is new and in addition to the Medi-
 care Program of the Federal Government.-
 . The bulletin goes into minute detail of
 ow most New Yorkers "unless your income
 is considerably above the national average"
 will be entitled to the total cost of almost
 all medical care, services and supplies which
 will be "fully paid for by your state."    -
 Any person of any age may apply under
 the new state law which the bulletin points
 out enacts a "dramatic change in the tradi-
 tional relationships between patients, doc-
 tors, hospital and state."  It also proclaims
 the (apparent) glad tidings that "from now
 on, you are financially responsible only for
 your wife or husband and children under 21
 years old.  You are no longer financially re-
 sponsible for the medical expenses of your
 parents."
 Also in the anouncement was a breakdown
 of wage brackets and eligibility which extend-
 ed to a family of six with a net income of
 $8,550 and this was net income les Federal
 and state Income taxes and health insurance
 premiums.
 Actually, New York has had a very liberal
 state medical assistance program for some-
 time, but has now lowered the eligibility
 requirements and added almost complete
 medical benefits including the cost of trans-
 portation  necessary  to  obtain  care  and
 services.
 Under provisions of  the Medicare bill
 passed last year, the Federal government will
 pay a good part of the New York State pro-
 gram.  Several other states have similar pro-
 grams although none are as extensive as the
 New York plan. Other states have applied
 and, unless Congress plugs some loopholes
 in the Federal assistance provisions of the
 Medicare  legislation, original  estimates of
 the cost to the Treasury will have to be re-
 vised upward by more than $500 million a
 year, and that could be only a start.
 The New York plan does not completely
 socialize medicine, but leaves little to be
 done before those who must foot the bill
 will demand at least equal treatment.  The
 expanded New York program alone will add
 something like $100 million in Federal cost
 to the Medicare program.  Other states are
 not likely to stand by and watch as New
 York drains the Treasury but will, as several
 already have, demand their shares.
 Of course this plan is also costing the State
 of New York a tremendous amount in tax
 money in a state where taxes and more taxes
 seem to be the order of the day.
 New York subway riders are subsidized by
 the state and city government and business
 and industry, including the New York Stock
 Exchange, threaten to leave the area if taxes
 continue to rise.  But rather than providing
 necessary medical assistance to those who
 cannot afford to pay, New York law extends
 total benefits to millions who have an annual
 income of about three times what the Presi-
 dent has set as the poverty level in the Great
 Society war on poverty.
 The New York plan should be called the
 great Treasury robbery of 1966 and if adopted
 by other states could break the Treasury,
 Sincerely,
 JIM BATTIN.
 FLEXIBLE LEAD-ZINC QUOTA BILL
 (Mr. SKUBITZ (at the request of Mr.
 REINECKE)  was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. SKUBITZ.  Mr. Speaker, for a
 good many years we have asked for, been
 promised, and still await a long-range
 minerals policy for our natural resource
 try in my State and one important to
 many States, the mining of lead and
 zinc, has suffered from rapidly changing
 cycles of price and supply caused by a
 lack of appropriate import controls.  We
 have proposed to correct this with legis-
 lation but, to date, have had no encour-
 agement from executive agencies.
 Today I join with other interested col-
 leagues in introducing a flexible lead-
 zinc import quota bill designed to serve
 as a deterrent should we again face the
 possibility of excessive imports.  We do
 this as an action necessary while we
 await the enactment of a minerals pol-
 icy by our Government.
 The industry has operated during the
 last 11/2 years at reasonable and sta-
 bilized prices that encouraged both pro-
 duction and consumption of both metals.
 We hope this continues but, with expan-
 sion of supplies abroad and particularly
 for zinc in Canada, we can see the need
 for a quota plan on the books now, to
 become effective when or if metal stocks
 in the United States reach abnormal
 levels.  The bill we introduce today does
 this and has the active endorsement of
 essentially all the domestic mining and
 smelting industry. Furthermore, the leg-
 islation has a term of 5 years to give the
 Congress and the executive department
 an opportunity to examine the need for
 continuing the plan and also to assess
 its operation if called into action.  I
 urge speedy consideration and approval
 to assure continuing stability of this im-
 portant industry.

 THE INDIANS' STAKE IN
 GRAND CANYON

 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-

 Mr. SAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, in a des-
 perate effort to gain sympathy for their
 scheme to sacrifice the beauty of the
 Grand Canyon in exchange for two un-
 necessary and uneconomic hydroelectric
 projects, promoters of the central Ari-
 zona project have resorted to blue sky
 promises designed to attract the support
 of American Indians.
 So far as substance is concerned, the
 picture as presented may as well have
 been etched on the shifting sands, and
 those of us who through the years have
 fought for better opportunities for our
 Indian friends are resentful of this tactic.
 In response to the appeal, which in-
 cluded the generous offer to change the
 name of Bridge Canyon to Hualapai, Mr.
 George Rocha, chairman of the Hualapai
 Council, wrote an excellent letter based
 .upon the information given to him by
 propagandists for the proposed dams.  I

 HUALAPAI TRIBAL COUNCIL,
 Peach Springs, Ariz., June 30,1966.
 DEAR FRIEND: My people have lived in iso-
 lation and poverty so long that we have al-
 most forgotten how to hope for a better way.
 The progress and prosperity of the Nation
 have not touched our lives.  Our world is the
 canyon country of the Colorado River in Ari-
 zona.  There are no jobs for us.  We have no
 business to run and no resources to sell, but
 now there is a new hope for us. I will tell
 you about it because we need your help to
 make the dreams of my people come true.
 The Congress of the United States has a
 bill before it to build a dam on the Colorado
 River in Bridge Canyon, a part of our Reser-
 vation.  It will be called Hualapai Dam. and
 it will make a beautiful lake in our canyon,
 far removed from the Grand   anyon Na-
 tional Park.  A good road will                                built from
 Peach Springs to the lake.   Thousands of
 people will come to take boat rides on the
 lake and to fish in it, and we plan to make a
 fine place for them to stay and to sell them
 the supplies they will need. This will make
 jobs and business for us and we will not be a
 poor and forgotten people any longer.  The
 dam and the lake and the road across our
 Reservation are the only hope we have of
 ever being able to help ourselves out of our
 ancient misery into a better life and into
 the main stream of our Great America.
 All we ask you to do if you want to help us
 is to write a letter to your Congressmen and
 ask them to vote "Yes" for Hualapai Dam.
 It is in a Bill called H.R. 4671-The Colorado
 River Basin Project Act.
 We need your help now.
 GEORGE ROCHA,
 Chairman.
 ALBUQUERQUE, N. MEx.,
 July 8, 1966.
 Mr. GEORGE ROCHA,
 Chairman, Hualapai Tribal Council,
 Peach Springs, Ariz.
 DEAR MR. RocIIA: Your recent letter has
 touched me and many others in the Sierra
 Club deeply.  I feel that you should know of
 what we believe to be our basic agreement,
 We are both concerned about people; we
 are both moved by a reverence for the land,
 and a belief that man loses contact with the
 natural world at the peril of his spiritual
 health.  It is quite possible that the Indians
 in the Southwest have much to teach Amer-
 icans in general about this belief.  The Taos
 Pueblo in its effort to regain title of its sacred
 land around Blue Lake, the Navajos in their
 determination to open their land without
 lowering  its value, the White Mountain.
 Apaches in their decision to devote a section
 of their reservation to wilderness; these are
 current examples of the way that the South-
 western Indians have demonstrated, in the
 midst of a world too often devoted to short-
 term gain, their hope that the land and the
 people can mutually benefit each other.
 The Sierra Club holds this hope firmly:
 The land can be enhanced by the love of peo-
 ple who respect it; people can he refreshed
 by land which has not been wounded or
 scarred for limited purposes.
 In this particular case, I do not believe our
 conflict to be basic.  The condition of your
 tribe as you describe it is deplorable.  It is
 shameful that those who knew of your plight
 and might have helped you in past years
 turned their faces away from you.  I sincerely
 hope that those who rush in with their help
 now have more than their own ends in view.
 I do wish that the National Park for the
 Grand Canyon could originally have included
 the whole of the Canyon.  As you know, the
 Peach Springs-Diamond Creek Canyon was
 once a mecca for visitors to the Canyon be-
 fore the South Rim was chosen for full devel-
 opment.  What a difference it would have
 made to your people if instead of closing off
 the lower part of the Grand Canyon, the Fed-
 eral Government had opened it up back in
 1920.
 That is a lost opportunity; now there is a
 new one-the hope that you can benefit from
 the construction of Hualapai Bridge Canyon
 dam & reservoir.  But this new opportunity
 is hollow.  Hollow because by destroying part
 of a unique piece of Creation, the dam will
 be destructive of those spiritual values that,
 as you know so well, can come only from land
 which affords peace and the chance for man
 to conceive of his wholeness.  You above all
 must feel that since recreation in the reser-
 voir will be in motorboats, that their me-
 chanical racket in that narrow gorge will cut
 off forever the chance to enjoy the quiet of
 the Canyon & the chance to enjoy the sounds
 that are natural to it.   Surely you must
 know, with your long history in the region,
 how foolish it would be to sacrifice that part
 of the inner gorge, when in only about a cen-
 tury-a moment to your tribe-the reservoir
 area will be silted in, becoming a phreato-
 phyte jungle.  Thus would all people be de-
 prived of opportunity to know this land as
 it should be.
 Let me emphasize my anger at the shoddy
 treatment you have received up to this point.
 Let me also strongly state that I believe that
 both your tribe and the Canyon can be saved,
 and therefore I urge, in the name of all the
 people-who need  this piece  of undefiled
 land-that we work together.  I believe that
 your entranceway to the Canyon need not be
 spoiled for your and all other Americans to
 benefit from it.  I therefore ask you to turn
 away from those who tell you that this de-
 structive, unnecessary project will help you;
 to realize that these are the same people who
 ignored you for so long;  to turn to the
 Canyon itself, which if it is left unimpaired,
 can forever be a tangible resource for your
 ,people and a spiritual resource for all people.

 They are pushing ahead with develop-
 ment plans, subdividing more land than
 their sales warrant, in preparation for
 the time that they will be able to demand
 a higher price from the Federal Govern-
 ment.
 Recently the Wall Street Journal pub-
 lished an article pointing out the prob-
 lem evolving out of the delay in obtain-
 ing the necessary funds for acquisition
 of lands for the park.  Also, the Sunday
 Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J.,, has ex-
 pressed  concern  about  making  Tocks
 Island a paradise for promoters. These
 articles are included as a part of my
 remarks and I commend them to you for
 careful reading.
 In an effort to ease this situation, I
 have introduced a bill which would per-
 mit the Delaware River Basin. Commis-
 sion, being composed of representatives
 from the States of New Jersey, New York,
 Pennsylvania, and Delaware, to enter
 into a contract with the Department of
 the Interior, to advance funds to the
 Secretary of the Interior for the purposse
 of expediting land acquisition at Tocks
 Island, which would be repaid to the
 Commission from the Land and Water
 Conservation Fund Act over a period of
 years.
 I am hopeful that the Committee on
 Interior and Insular Affairs will consider
 this bill, H.R. 15193, prior to the adjourn-
 ment of this Congress.

 COSTLY PLAYGROUNDS-DEVELOPERS DRIVE UP
 PRfCE OF LAND PICKED FOR NEW NATIONAL
 PARKS-FUNDS Now AUTHORIZED LIKELY To
 FALL SHORT;  REAL ESTATE MEN CALL U.S.
 PLANS   VAGUE-SUDDIVISIONS   AT   Tocks
 ISLAND
 (By Douglas Bedell)
 WALLPACK CENTER, N.J.-This sylvan com-
 munity is at the heart of an area that is
 scheduled to become a national                           ark within
 easy reach of 30 million Eastern seaboard
 residents.  Officially designated the Delaware
 Water Gap  National Recreation Area  but
 commonly called Tocks Island, the park will
 embrace 72,000 acres of lakes, forests and
 hills.  It will offer city dwellers swimming,
 boating, trout fishing, camping, hiking and
 glimpses of white-tailed deer, beaver and rac-
 coon..                    -
 Pay a visit here today, however, and you
 would never know a national park was in the
 making.  Up on nearby Blue Ridge Moun-
 tain, within the boundaries of the planned
 park, private developers are bulldozing a new
 road  and clearing homesites. A hemlock
 swamp, envisioned by park planners as the
 climax of a  hiking  trail,  has  just  been
 drained as the basin for a lake for the use of
 cottage  owners.   Salesmen  are    peddling
 choice lakefront lots in the growing summer
 colony of Blue Mountain Lakes for $5,500
 each, and the developers are registering new
 blocks of  subdivisions with the Wallpack
 township clerk.
 All this activity is causing frustration and
 deep concern in Washington.  While Federal
 planners have picked sites for a series of new
 recreation areas near turban centers to round
 out the national park system, funds for land
 acquisition have been slow in coming.

 velopment of the very acreage the Govern-

 URGENCY AT TOCKS ISLAND
 (Mr. SAYLOR (at the request of Mr.
 REINECKE)  was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. SAYLOR.  Mr. Speaker, last year
 the Congress approved the establishment
 of the Delaware Water Gap National
 Recreation Area in the States of New
 Jersey and Pennsylvania, commonly re-
 ferred to as Tocks Island, which is the
 first national park to be established east
 of the Mississippi River.
 The approval of this park has touched
 off a land speculation war among devel-
 opers which is most regrettable since
 they are fully aware of the Federal Gov-
 ernment's intention to acquire the entire
 area for creation of the new park.
 Plans to develop the area have been
 widely publicized, and maps showing the
 boundaries of the park and the area of
 the dam to be constructed by the Corps
 of Engineers are available to all con-
 cerned.
 Unfortunately, these park plans seem
 to have given impetus to some real estate
 men and land developers eager to make
 a "fast buck" at Uncle Sam's expense,
 'knowing full well that it will take 6 to
 10 years for the Federal Government to
 complete acquisition of the land involved.

 fended the desecration of the American
 flag.  In an article in yesterday's New
 York Times which I am including with
 these remarks, the ACLU is reported to
 have defended flag burning as "a con-
 stitutionally protected activity" akin to
 sit-ins and other forms of civil disobedi-
 ence. As if to reach for a straw in the
 manner of the proverbial drowning man,
 the ACLU spoke out of the side of its
 month and said, in effect, "After all, the
 law provides that old flags shall be de-
 stroyed in a dignified way."
 'What contempt for our flag and our
 Nation? It is unconscionable that any-
 one except Communist sympathizers and
 those who would destroy our Nation
 should advocate a theory that it is a
 proper means of protest to desecrate the
 stars and stripes.  The ACLU adds one
 more footnote to a history which already
 is full of questionable chapters.
 It is groups like the ACLU which gives
 a rationale to those who advocate dis-
 obedience, rioting and contempt for au-
 thority.  I wonder where they will ever
 draw the line.  One of these days they
 will be telling us that academic freedom
 includes the right of indecent exposure
 in the classroom. Their questionable po-
 sition Is in totally bad taste, Mr. Speaker,
 and I strenuously object to their views.
 Unfortunately, the Supreme Court will
 probably uphold their twisted, wierd
 theory which they propound in this of-
 fensive unpatriotic and despicable beat-
 nik-type protest.
 The article in the Times indicates the
 immediate need for the Congress to act.
 I am joining many of my colleagues in
 signing the discharge petition offered by
 my good friend, the gentleman from In-
 diana [Mr. ROUDEBUSI]. His bill would
 make the desecration of the flag a crime
 and I have introduced a companion bill
 on this same subject. It is high time we
 call a halt to these people who flaunt law
 and order by desecrating its symbol, old
 glory.

 BURNING  OF  FLAG  IS  DEFENDED  HERE-BUT
 ACLU     FAILS To  SWAY   COURT  ON  CIVIL-
 RIGHTS ISSUE
 (By David Anderson)
 The New York Chapter of the American
 Civil Liberties Union contended yesterday
 in a Brooklyn courtroom that burnl,ng an
 American flag on a street corner could be "a
 most practical and effective way" to demon-
 strate for civil rights.
 Flag-burning, it was argued, is "a consti-
 tutionally protected activity" akin to sit-ins
 and other forms of civil disobedience.  Fur-
 thermore, the organization asserted, the law
 provides that old flags "shall be destroyed in
 a dignified way, preferably by burning."
 On trial before Judge Ludwig Glows, in
 Criminal Court was Sidney Street, a 47-year-
 old bus driver who won the Bronze Star in
 World War II.  Defending him was David T.
 Goldstick of the Civil Liberties Union.  Here
 is the story, as was given in court:
 his father-in-law, Fernandez Decora, a World
 War I veteran, at his funeral 20 years ago,
 and on the corner of Lafayette Avenue and
 St. James Place, Mr. Street lit a bonfire of
 newspapers topped with the flag.
 Patrolman James Copeland drove up in a
 squad car around 7 P.M. and demanded:
 "What the hell's going on here?"
 "If they did that to Meredith," Mr. Street
 replied, "we don't need an American flag."
 Mr. Street was arrested and charged with
 malicious mischief and disorderly conduct.
 Mr.  Goldstick,  the  lawyer,  said  to the
 court: "This man was enjoying a constittt.-
 tionally protected  activity                                                                       to  be  equated
 with civil rights protests.  He adopted a most
 practical and effective way of calling atten-
 tion to a very grievous deed.  It was no act
 of desecration; he did not defile the flag but
 burned it with all dignity, not contempt."
 Mr. Street, the defense said, was "engaged
 in symbolic speech, protected by the First
 Amendment to the Constitution."  Accord-
 ing to the Civil Liberties Union, this is the
 first prosecution in New York under a Penal
 Law provision, enacted in 1892, prohibiting
 public mutilation of the flag.
 Judge Glowa found Mr. Street guilty on
 the malicious-mischief charge, but dismissed
 the disorderly-conduct count because every-
 one agreed that the few people who had wit-
 nessed the flag-burning paid it little heed.
 Mr. Street, who could receive the maximum
 penalty of $500 and three years in prison,
 Will be sentenced Aug. 9.  The Civil Liberties
 Union said it would appeal.

 PRESS CONFERENCE
 The value of the presidential press con-
 ference, not of the impromptu sort but on
 a rather formal basis, was well demonstrated
 in Mr. Johnson's meeting with the press,
 and through television with the country, on
 Wednesday afternoon.  The President called
 this gathering at a molnent when the nation
 was much agitated over the issue of the
 American fliers held captive by the North
 Vietnamese, and was fearful and uncertain
 as to what might happen next.  Also part of
 the background were Mr. Johnson's speeches
 of three weeks ago in Omaha and Des Moines,
 which had seemed to some to suggest that
 the United States, in a change of policy, had
 decided to seek a military solution in Viet-
 nam.  It was a moment when the country
 needed information, and reassurance.
 These the President provided, with the in-
 formation that in the face of great difficulties
 our policy remains the same, and with reas-
 surance that severe enemy provocations had
 not driven our Government to such a degree
 of frustration that major and perhaps ir-
 revocable decisions might be made hastily
 and in passion.  The President's demonstra-
 tion of the profound concern we all share and
 at the same time of the thoughtful steadiness
 his office calls for especially at the hardest
 times was healthy for the country, and help-
 ful to the press and to our friends elsewhere
 in the world.  We venture to believe that Mr.
 Johnson for his part may have found the
 exchanges of this meeting useful.

 of the 30 VISTA outposts in Alaska earlier
 this year.  The Yukon River is the only air-
 strip: the bush planes, which drop in once
 or twice a week in good weather, can land
 on either water or ice.  But when the ice
 breaks up during the spring thaw, there is
 a  period of  about three  weeks  when  no
 planes can land.  The flight schedule may
 also be interrupted (and frequently is) by
 rain, snow or fog. Temperatures in the win-
 ter go down to 40 or 50 degrees below zero.
 Don hever dreamed he'd be heading for
 Alaska when he joined VISTA: he was sup-
 posed to work in the slums of Chicago.  He
 joined the domestic Peace Corps last June.
 after a three-year hitch in the Marines and
 a year at Hartford University.  (lie had a
 scholarship to Providence College when he
 graduated from La Salle Academy, and went
 there for a year, but left to join the Marines
 at the age of 18.)   But when they asked him
 to go to Alaska, Don said sure, if that's
 where they wanted him.  In the Marines, he
 was stationed in Hawaii.  Going from there
 to Alaska was "a pretty cold transition," as
 his mother put it.
 But  he seems to have no regrets.   He
 was interested in social work, his mother
 reported, so when he felt he wasn't getting
 anywhere in college, joining VISTA seemed
 the natural thing to do.  "This suits me,"
 Don said.   "I like these people. They're
 good, honest and intelligent.   They're not
 complex.  They're eager to please."  He also
 spoke admiringly of the Eskimos' ability with
 their hands.
 According to his mother, Don is no slouch
 in that department. himself.  He was a radar
 technician in the Marines, and between his
 schooling and hitch in the service he worked
 at various trades, from landscaping, stone
 wall and cesspool building to short order
 cook,  turret lathe operator and  surveyor.
 Once in VISTA, his skills were sharpened by
 six weeks of intensive training at the Uni-
 versity  of  Alaska  and  Fort  Yukon.                                                                                                                                                  He
 learned the basics of the Eskimo language
 there and is picking up more all the time
 from the villagers. Several of the Eskimos
 knew English already, and others are learn-
 ing it from the VISTA team.
 VISTA is winding up it first year in the
 49th state with 60 volunteers, some of them
 working alone in villages even smaller than
 Emmonak.  The state has now requested 200
 volunteers, and it looks as though Don will
 still be there when the new group comes in.
 His mother wants him to come back and
 finish college.  But thoughts of college seem
 far from his mind when Don starts talking:
 "We get into the homes- of these people and
 got  to  know    them  and  their  problems.
 That's what VISTA really is."  And that's
 why Don Annotti is building a refrigerator
 for the Eskimos this summer.

 PEACE IN ASIA
 (Mr. MACKAY (at the request of Mr.
 REES) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. MACKAY.  Mr. Speaker the At-
 lanta Constitution reviews editorially
 President Johnson's policy for peace on
 Asia and concludes that he has clarified
 an evolving, policy toward Red China
 aimed at ending the isolation of its 700
 In the words of the newspaper:
 He has pointed the way to peace in a forth-
 right expression of this country's national
 will.
 If the Red Chinese accept, the Consti-
 tution believes, they could indeed open
 the door to lasting peace in Asia.
 I include the editorial in the RECORD:
 LASTING PEACE IN ASIA
 President Johnson has spelled out a four-
 point policy for peace in Asia, combining U.S.
 commitment against aggression there with a
 continuing effort for improved relations with
 Red - China.          Such overtures have been re-
 jected in the past but the President is trying
 to open a door looking to an end of Peking's
 isolation and Red China's paranoid tenden-
 cies.
 "The peace we seek in Asia," the President
 declared in a speech Tuesday night to the
 American Alumni Council, "is a peace of
 conciliation.  Communists in Asia still be-
 lieve in force to achieve their goals and the
 United States, as a Pacific power, will not
 retreat from the obligations of freedom and
 security in Asia" and particularly in Viet
 Nam.
 His proposals for achieving lasting peace
 in Asia included international trade, the free
 flow of people and ideas, the full participa
 tion of all nations in an international com-
 munity and a common dedication to human
 progress and development.'
 A peaceful mainland China is central to a
 peaceful Asia, the President declared, and
 Peking must be discouraged from aggressive
 hostility and encouraged toward peaceful co-
 operation with others.  He cited U.S. efforts
 to open up travel between the United States
 and mainland China-efforts which so far
 have been unsuccessful.   He will continue
 such initiatives in spite of rebuffs.
 Referring to the U.S. effort in Viet Nam
 as part of the four essentials he cited for
 peace in Asia, he said our purpose there is
 "to prove to aggressive nations that the use
 of force to conquer others is a losing game."
 His other three points were:
 "The determination' of the United States
 to meet our obligations in Asia as a-Pacific
 power,     . the building of political and eco-
 nomic strength among the nations of free
 Asia" and "reconciliation between nations
 that now call themselves enemies."
 The President thus has clarified an evolv-
 ing policy toward Red China aimed at ending
 the isolation of the country's 700 mililon
 people  from  the  outside  world.   He  has
 pointed the way to peace in a forthright ex-
 pression of this country's national will.                                                      Ac-
 oeptance by the Red Chinese could indeed
 open the door to lasting peace in Asia.
 APPROPRIATIONS BUSINESS OF THE
 SESSION
 (Mr. MAHON (at the request of Mr.
 REES) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include tables.)
 [Mr. MAHON'S remarks will appear
 hereafter in the Appendix.]
 WATCH THOSE INTEREST RATES
 (Mr. MONAGAN (at the request of
 Mr. REES)  was granted permission to
 extend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. MONAGAN.  Mr. Speaker, the
 current period of high interest rates is
 causing  serious  dislocations  in  our
 economy.
 One of the results of the rising interest
 rates has been to divert funds from
 savings banks and savings and loan as-
 sociations to commercial banks or to
 other forms of investment.  As a result
 of this flow, the institutions which nor-
 mally provide money for the homebuild-
 ing industry are discovering that their
 deposits which provide the funds for
 lending are sharply reduced from last
 year. 'The results of this policy have al-
 ready been seen in the movement of
 loaned money from home mortgage to
 short-term and commercial loans.
 This heating of the economy must be
 met on many fronts.  There must be
 determination to control spending on
 the part of the Congress, there must be
 restraint in the appropriation requests
 on the part of the executive branch, and
 there must be a broad national policy to
 discourage abnormal threats to the sta-
 bility of the economy.
 In addition, the Congress can and
 should take prompt action by legislation
 to redress the balance between commer-
 cial and savings institutions and keep
 their dual operation functioning effi-
 ciently without undue discrimination.
 In this way the housing industry can
 continue to provide employment and eco-
 nomic activity, as well as furnish the
 necessary homes for our growing popu-
 lation.
 I urge the House Committee on Bank-
 ing and Currency to take prompt action
 to deal effectively with this problem.
 RUBBER FOOTWEAR
 DEVELOPMENTS
 (Mr. MONAGAN (at the request of Mr.
 REES) was granted permission to extend
 his remarks at this point in the RECORD
 and to include extraneous matter.)
 Mr. MONAGAN.  Mr. Speaker, since
 the meeting of the New England delega-
 tion which convened on May 24 to for-
 mulate plans for action on the Treasury
 Department's recent reduction of the
 . 16771
 tariff on rubber-soled footwear imports,
 several important steps have been taken
 in pursuit of this objective.
 As chairman of the committee which
 was appointed to coordinate House and
 Senate  efforts  in  this  matter,  I  am
 pleased to inform the Members of this
 body that our committee members have
 been joined by other Members of Con-
 gress in our response to the Treasury
 Department action.
 Through the committee, we were able
 to mobilize  substantial  congressional
 participation and representation at the
 June 8 Tariff Commission hearings on
 the American selling price system of tar-
 iff evaluation of rubber-soled footwear.
 At this hearing, through the testimony
 and statements of Senators PELL and
 EDWARD  KENNEDY,  and Representative
 BOLAND, as well as my own, the economic
 consequences of the tariff change were
 firmly presented to the Commission.
 Immediately following this hearing, on
 June 9r the committee called for discus-
 sion with Assistant Secretary of' the
 Treasury True Davis, Commissioner of
 Customs Lester D. Johnson, and Mr.
 Edwin F. Rains of the Customs Bureau,
 and requested administrative restoration
 of the original tariff.
 The presence at this meeting of 14
 Members and their representatives from
 a cross section of New England and Mid-
 western States including Representatives
 BATES, BURKE, O'NEILL, FOGARTY, MONA-
 GAN, Senator RIBIcoFF, and representa-
 tives of Speaker MCCORMACK, Senators
 EDWARD KENNEDY, MUSKIE, and SALTON-
 STALL,   and  Representatives  MORSE,
 TaoMPSON of Wisconsin, and ADAIR em-
 phasized the importance of this issue to
 the Congress.
 It should be noted that a. complaint
 against the new appraisement procedure
 has been made to the Customs Bureau by
 nine of the major footwear firms, and
 the Commissioner of Customs has as-
 sured the committee that in this pro-
 ceeding a thorough reexamination of the
 Bureau's previous decision will be made
 and the points made by the Committee
 will be considered.
 In addition to these measures, we have
 sent to the President the letter proposed
 by Senator RIBICOFF and signed by 37
 Members, protesting the Treasury De-
 partment's  unilateral  tariff  reduction
 and emphasizing the threat that this
 action poses to the domestic footwear
 industry and its workers.
 We have recently recived a reply to
 this letter from Secretary Fowler on be-
 half of the President which raises some
 doubt that administrative relief from
 the Treasury Department's decision will
 be forthcoming and from it the inference
 may be drawn that corrective legislation
 or judicial relief may be necessary. Hav-
 ing noted the disregard of the Treasury
 Department for the evidence of the act-
 ual and potential impact of increased
 imports and the dismissal of this argu-
 ment by the Department as "not persua-
 sive," it is difficult not to conclude that
 legislative action will provide the only
 practical solution of this problem.
 Many members of the committee and
 other Members of Congress have spon-
 sored legislation identical to my bill,
 H.R. 12983, which would reverse the
 No. 122-22

 Treasury Department's decision.  This,
 legislation is pending before the Ways
 and Means Committee and we have made
 and will continue to make organized at-
 tempts to bring these bills to a hearing.
 Also, Chairman DENT of the General
 Subcommittee on Labor has planned to
 schedule hearings next month on the
 impact of imports on American industry
 and employment.
 Although the task we have undertaken
 is a difficult one, the broad support that
 our efforts have received from workers

 are doing on our fabric shoe tariff problem.
 We at the Naugatuck Footwear Plant know
 that this has taken a great amount of time
 and effort on your part, and I affil certain
 that without your interest and the interest
 of Senators DODD and RLBIcoFF and others,
 there would be very little hope for. eventual

 tangible results as yet, I hope that some-
 thing beneficial will come of this.
 Your activity on our behalf in this matter

 DEAR CONGRESSMAN MONACAN:  I want to
 extend to you my thanks and deep apprecia-
 tion for the extensive effort you have put
 forth to protect domestic rubber footwear
 fobs through continuation of a fair tariff
 practice.  Although this matter can affect
 your own State, much is at stake in other
 areas of the country.
 As President of the United Rubber Work-

 RESOLUTION No. ,7,  URW  DISTRICT  No. 2
 COUNCIL MEETING, APRIL 23, 1966, BOSTON,
 MASS., ON TARIFF DUTY ON IMPORTED RUB-
 BER-SOLED FOOTWEAR
 Whereas: The approach of the AFT -CIO to
 the participation of the United States in For-
 eign Trade, and to the inevitable problem of
 competition  of  imports with  domestically
 produced goods, has been to support, on the
 one hand, the maximum flow of goods be-
 tween countries via Foreign Trade-while in-
 sisting, at the same time, that those Indus-
 tries and those workers adversely affected by
 foreign imports be protected via tariff du-
 ties and Import quotas, and/or via govern-
 ment subsidy or retraining and. displacement
 allowances; and
 Whereas: Imports of rubber-soled footwear
 with canvass or fabric uppers began to enter
 the American domestic market in increasing
 numbers in the decade following World War
 II-and in recent years have risen to the
 point where such imports now command a
 substantial segment of the domestic market
 (particularly at the low end of the price
 scale); and
 Whereas:  Such  imports  of rubber-soled
 footwear have adversely affected both pres-
 ent and future employment opportunities for
 United Rubber Worker Members-and mem-
 bers of sister AFL-CIO Unions-engaged in
 the  domestic   production  of  rubber-soled
 footwear.  Foreign competition at low wage
 levels is particularly severe in the case of
 rubber-soled footwear, because of the rela-
 tively high labor content of such production
 which is approximately 45%; and
 Whereas: Imports of rubber-soled :footwear
 continued to inundate the American domes-
 tic market in spite of tariff duties imposed
 on the basis of the highest American Selling
 Price for a comparable domestically produced
 shoe; and
 Whereas:  The  unilateral  action  of  the
 Bureau of Customs of the U.S. Treasury De-
 partment, in February, 1966, In effectively
 reducing the tariff on imported rubber-soled
 footwear  by 20-25%,  by  establishing   the
 American Selling Price basis for valuation of
 such imports on the lowest-priced compar-
 able domestic shoe-compounded by making
 such reduction retroactive for three years-
 can only result in even more serious effects
 on the market for domestically produced
 footwear-and, therefore, on the job security
 of United Rubber Workers and other AFL-
 CIO members.  The effect of this change has
 been  to establish  non-union  shoes,  pur-
 chased by low paid American workers, as a
 basis for levying the tariff on imported shoes.
 This is a further and flagrant affront to the
 American Labor Movement and to its union
 label problem,  geared to encouraging the
 purchase  of products made under decent
 wages and working conditions; and
 Whereas: The announcement by a respon-
 sible spokesman for the American negotiating
 group, which will go to Geneva this spring
 for the Kennedy round of tariff negotiations
 under  General  Agreement  on Tariffs  and
 Trade (GATT), indicating that the American
 Selling Price basis for valuation of imports is
 subject to negotiation during the Geneva
 meetings, can only lead to a further reduc-
 tion in the tariff duties on Imported rubber-
 soled footwear; and
 Whereas:  Congressman  JOHN  MONACAN
 (D-Conn.) has  introduced  a  bill  in  the
 United States House of Representatives (the
 bill, H.R. 12983, is now pending before the
 House Ways and Means Committee;) whose
 purpose is to reverse-by legislative action of
 the Congress-the decision of the Treasury
 Department and the Bureau of  Customs.
 This bill would re-establish the use of the
 highest comparable American Selling Price
 as a basis for valuation of imported rubber-
 soled footwear.  We note with appreciation
 the bills introduced by other friendly Con-
 gressmen to accomplish this same purpose,

 IRS and the Grand Canyon
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 .HON. JOHN R. SCHMIDHAUSER
 OF IOWA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 28, 1966
 Mr. SCHMIDHAIISER. Mr. Speaker,
 action by the Internal Revenue Service
 has threatened to block exposition of
 conversation groups' views on the pro-
 posed Grand Canyon dams.
 The ,appearance early this week of an
 advertisement in the New York Times,
 sponsored by the Sierra Club and pre-
 senting the reasons for the club's op-
 position to the Grand Canyon dams, is
 an encouraging sign.
 Discriminatory action by the Internal
 Revenue Service has failed to stop the
 defense of Grand Canyon, and I am glad
 of it.
 An editorial in the Idaho Statesman of
 June 14, 1966, raises the question of
 whether the IRS action may result, in
 effect, in taxation of free speech:
 THE "CLUB" OVER TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS
 A provision in the Internal Revenue Code
 pertaining to tax-exempt organizations pro-
 hibits such groups from attempting to in-
 fluence legislation.  If they  take political
 action,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  is
 charged with enforcing the law and with-
 drawing the tax-exemption status.
 It is assumed that federal agents investi-
 gate  organizations before  granting               such
 status in the first place.  However, the pro-
 cedures they entertain in removing organiza-
 tions from tax-exempt classifications may be
 questionable.
 As an example, the Sierra Club, a Cali-
 fornia-based organization which promotes
 studies and programs on preservation of wi-
 derness and national scenic monuments, has
 a public record of intervening in conserva-
 tion acts, such as wilderness, wild rivers, sea-
 shore, redwood forest preservation and pre-
 venting damage to certain national scenic
 monuments.
 Last Thursday, the club placed ads in the
 New York Times and Washington Post, re-
 cruiting public opposition to the construc-
 tion of two federal reclamation dams in the
 Grand Canyon as now proposed in Congress.
 Twenty-four hours later the Internal Rev-
 enue Service issued a summons to the club
 declaring its advertising was an attempt to
 influence Congress.  Thus the club is to lose
 its tax-exempt status, unless a hearing pro-
 duces a different interpretation.
 There is no intent here to argue the pros
 or cons of the Sierra Club's stand on the
 But  if the IRS      grants' tax-exemption,
 knowing the purpose of an organization-
 religious, charitable, public service, political,
 business or conservation-is to comment and
 stir opinion on public issues, has the gov-
 ernment the right to take away such a status
 because of influential and capricious com-
 plaints from opposing interests.
 The law must not be enforced by "shotgun"
 tactics.
 Most prized in this nation is the ability
 61 the people to speak out and organize to
 protest or support various actions of govern-
 ment.
 This is the service the Sierra Club and
 other foundations perform.  If the IRS holds
 a club over their activities and threatens,
 possibly the law should be changed to pro-
 vide that a modest tax be imposed.  If any
 orgaliization operates commercially in com-
 petition with private business or holds in-
 collie property, then it should be taxed in a
 comparable manner to assessment of private
 interests.
 As it is now, the IRS code can be unjustly
 enforced on, groups which have taken posi-
 tion on public matters, while allowing other
 organizations to continue without punish-
 ment.
 Congress should inquire into the intent of
 the tax-exempt law and whethe  it is being
 ,administered fairly or not, or sjhether free
 Arabs To Fight A*iVt American Troops

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 28, 1966
 Mr. MULTER.                               Mr.  Speaker,  Vice
 President HUBERT                          HUMPHREY   recently
 spoke before the American Jewish Press
 Association here in Washington and
 during the course of his address pointed
 out that American tax dollars are going
 to support the members of an Arab army
 being organized to fight against Israel
 and whose officers are being sent to Viet-
 nam to fight against our troops as train-
 ing for an eventual attack upon Israel.
 This incredible story is reported edi-
 torially in the July-August 1966 edition
 of the National Jewish Monthly and I
 commend that editorial to the attention
 of our colleagues:
 ARABS WE ARE FEEDING ARE PREPARING To KILL
 AMERICANS  IN  VIET NAM  AND  To  INVADE
 ISRAEL
 To the overwhelming major.ty of our read-
 ers, who are American citizens, we address
 this question: Are you aware that part of
 your tax money is now being used to support
 men who are in an army that is openly pre-
 paring to fight against Americans in Viet
 Nam and later attack the State of Israel?
 This shocking statement is literally true.
 The army referred to is the so-called Pal-
 estine  Liberation   Organization   (P.L.O.),
 which the   notorious   Arab opportunist
 Ahmed Shukairy has formed with Arab ref-
 ugees from Palestine.  That army is receiv-
 ing weapons from Communist China, and
 some of its officers aie being sent to North
 Viet Nam to fight against the Americans de-
 fending South Viet Nam-and at the same
 time to receive training in guerrilla warfare,
 to be applied later against Israel.   These
 soldiers in the P.L.O., and their families, are
 living in the Arab refugee camps in Egypt
 and Syria which are supported by the United
 Nations.  And the United States contribu-
 tion to the support of those camps is 70%
 of the total.
 This is no idle theory; Shukairy himself
 boasts of it.  During the recent annual con-
 vention of the American Jewish Press Asso-
 ciation in Washington, B'nai B'rith tendered
 nation.  We receive arms from the Chinese
 People's Republic.  The P.L.O. has military
 officers being trained in the arms of -libera-
 tion and the experience of the Chinese."  He
 added: "We and our army are a threat to
 Israel." Shukairy, usually unreliable, ms.y
 be telling the truth now.
 THE UN SHOULD STOP SUPPORTING AN ARMY OF
 AGGRESSORS
 The U.S. Government has now urged the
 UN to remove from its relief rolls all Arab
 refugees who are involved in such military
 activities.   All we can say to that is:  it's
 about time!  Sen. EDWARD KENNEDY heads a
 Senate subcommittee which has been investi-
 gating  UN                                                                                                                                  relief  activities  in  general in
 Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan, and he has esti-
 mated that between 10,000 and 14,000 Arab
 refugees are in the P.L.O.-all of them receiv-
 ing food and supplies from the UN.  We wel-
 come his demand that they be stricken from
 the relief rolls.   "It is .incompatible with
 United States policy and with the funda-
 mental concept of the United Nations," he
 declared, "to supply aid in any way to mem-
 bers of any army whose purpose is to work
 against a member nation of the UN."
 We also welcome the action of King Hus-
 sein of Jordan, who has banned the P.L.O.
 in his country.  He called it "an extremist
 group," and was promptly attacked by Egypt
 and Syria.  But the King went even further,
 and made a statement of the utmost sig-
 nificance: he demanded that all the Arab
 refugee camps now being maintained by the
 UN be liquidated, and that those living in
 them should be integrated in the countries
 where those camps-are located.
 This is, of course, the policy which Israel
 and  many   leaders  in   other   countries
 throughout the world have been advocating
 for years.  It just does not make sense-nor
 is it humanitarian-to keep on maintaining
 hundreds of thousands of refugees in "tem-
 porary" enclaves, supported by the charity
 of the world-when the vast empty stretches
 of Arab territories are crying out for man-
 power to develop them-and especially man-
 power of their own religious and linguistic
 kind.  King Hussein himself has shown the
 way; almost half of all the Arab refugees are
 living in his kingdom, and he has incor-
 porated them into his country.  If _ Egypt and
 Syria were to do the same, the problem would
 be solved.  But Egypt and Syria have found
 the "refugee problem" too convenient for
 their political purpose to do that, so far.
 It is now more than 18 years since the Pale-
 stine Arabs fled from the new State of Israel,
 after being told by their leaders that follow-
 ing an Arab victory they could return and
 seize all the Jewish property for themselves.
 The intolerable refugee camps should  be
 closed, and their inmates integrated into the
 countries of their Arab brothers.
 That cannot be done overnight.  But what
 can and should be done at once is to remove
 from the UN relief rolls every Arab refugee
 Who, through the Palestine Liberation Orga-
 nization, is being supported by American tax
 dollars while he trains to fight against Amer-
 icans in Viet Nam and prepares to invade
 Israel.

 POWEa OF NONSENSE
 Konrad Heiden was so early an anti-nazi
 publicist that his first book, "History of Na-
 tional Socialism" [1932], was published in
 Germany and publicly burned by Nazis there
 before Hitler's party came to power. Heiden's
 death in New York the other day has re-
 minded the public that it was he who first
 -pop{vlarized the term Nazi, in place of the
 earlier current. Naso.
 The expression "National Socialist" was
 ,,naturally first abbreviated to the first two
 letters in each of the two words-Naso.  As a,
 satiric thrust, Heiden preferred to use the
 first four letters in the German word mean-
 in, "national,'"' as in Bavarian slang Nazi had
 the established meaning of "bumpkin" or
 "simpleton."  Some  say  that  the      Nasos
 quickly adopted the term Nazi, successfully
 seeking by their acceptance of the word to
 blur the bite it had in Heiden's first use of it.
 In writing of Hitler's speeches, which he
 heard as early as 1920, Heiden said they
 -impressed him as a "flood of nonsense."
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLEMENT J. ZABLOCKI
 OF WISCONSIN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 ' Wednesday, July 27, 1966
 Mr. ZABLOCKI.  Mr. Speaker, it was
 indeed welcome news that the regime in
 North Vietnam has reconsidered its pre-
 viously  announced intentions to try
 American pilots shot down over their
 territory as war criminals.
 Such a step would have produced an
 increase of tensions and probably escala-
 tion of the war itself. The execution of
 American fliers, as the Milwaukee Jour-
 nal said In a recent editorial, would be
 a "calamity,"
 'The Journal pointed out that the re-
 straint which has marked the conflict
 thus far might be snapped by such trials
 and executions.  For that reason, such
 actions not only would violate interna-
 tional law on the treatment of prisoners,
 but also would imperial world peace.
 At this point I wish to'insert in the
 RECORD the thoughtful comments of the
 newspaper's editorial:
 TRIAL or AMERICAN FLIERS CERTAIN  To
 ESCALATE WAR
 lence, insults and public curiosity. Measures
 of  reprisal  against them are prohibited.
 The United States ratified the convention
 in  1932.  ,Russia,  Communist  China  and
 North Vietnam have never signed it.
 The 1949 Geneva convention, signed by 61
 nations including the United States, specifl-
 caily provides that war prisoners be pro-
 tected against intimidation. and reprisal for
 acts of war performed in the lime" of duty.
 And it forbids reprisals against prisoners in
 "all cases of declared war or any other armed
 conflict which may arise between two or
 more of the high contracting parties, even if
 the state of war is not recognized by one of
 them,"  Among the signers was North Viet-
 nam.  The date: June 5, 1957.
 The history of this conflict is ugly enough
 already. At least one American prisoner of
 war has been murdered by the Vietcong.
 There also have been published reports of
 atrocities, some against prisoners of war, by
 the South Vietnamese.
 This is no polite gentleman's game covered
 by polite rules.  The only rules observed at
 all are those imposed by the fear that if one
 side breaks them, the other will retaliate
 and thus escalate brutality with more bru-
 tality.
 It would be disastrous If this slender thread
 of sanity in the midst of war should be
 snapped by the trial and execution of Ameri-
 can airmen, or of any prisoners of war on
 either side.  It could result in an even more
 ominous threat to the peace of the whole
 world.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JULIA BUTLER HANSEN
 OF WASHINGTON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, July 28, 1966
 Mrs. HANSEN of Washington.  Mr.
 Speaker, Wednesday, July 6, in the Daily
 Olympian is a letter written by a very
 articulate and thoughtful man in my
 district which expresses the thoughts,
 spirit, and decency of a sizable number
 of people in my district.
 It is a distinct pleasure to place this
 in the RECORD today so that others may
 have the opportunity of reading his
 message.
 May I particularly call attention to
 the last paragraph:
 RIGHT OR WRONG, THEREADERS ALWAYS WRrrE:
 WHOSE RIGHTS?
 EDITOR, the DAILY OLYMPIAN:
 I am angered, nowadays, every time I hear
 the  word  "rights"   Whose  rights?   The
 rights of a tiny minority to scorn, abuse, and
 undermine the welfare, peace, and safety of
 the vast majority?
 This nation was founded on a Bill       of
 Rights, but those rights were, and are, de-
 signed to protect the majority and the na-
 tion as well as the individual or the few,
 When the sometimes mistaken, often de-
 liberate, assertion of so-called "rights" by a
 comparatively small minority take away from
 the large majority of our citizenry the Tat-
 ter's own rights-just whose "rights" are we
 talking about?
 Is it too "reactionary" to say that the
 youth of America have the right to peaceably
 and orderly attend our universities without
 being obstructed, annoyed, and insulted by
 a few protesting, obscene malcontents-who
 contribute nothing to the national welfare?
 Many, not students at all, but merely Idle
 agitators.  Is it too much to say that the
 average American has the right to traverse
 our streets without the hazard of riots and
 lethal lawlessness on the part of those who
 seek to take the law into their own hands
 under the pretense of fighting for some as-
 sumed right?
 How long must we stand idly by and see
 our police, whom we empower to maintain
 law  and  order,  attacked,  abused,  under-
 mined and ridiculed by the criminal few, and
 those who choose to prostitute the meaning
 of the word rights?     Our Supreme Court
 recently split 5 to 4 In deciding the "rights"
 of the criminal suspect and the resulting
 decision brought the strong protest of the
 minority judges as well as the near com-
 plete dismay of a very sizeable segment of
