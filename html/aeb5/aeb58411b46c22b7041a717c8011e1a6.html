 Because the struggle in Vietnam is so important and because it
 demands daily so much of our national thought and effort, we run the
 risk of neglecting areas of the world which are at least equally crucial.
 But we cannot afford to be totally preoccupied with the conflict in
 Vietnam.  The North Atlantic area is still the decisive area and it
 needs our national attention.
 The cooperation of the North Atlantic nations in building a com-
 mon defense, the steady progress toward a Western European economic
 community, and joint efforts of these and other nations in reducing
 trade barriers and strengthening the international financial system
 have helped to create a center of stability in an unsettled world.
 Recently, however, there have been signs that the solidarity of the
 Atlantic community is weakening.
 It is not surprising that the winds of change are freshening in the
 North Atlantic region when they have reached gale force in so many
 parts of the world.  Nor is it surprising that the nations of this region
 have not found the full answer to the problem of reconciling national
 sovereignty with the need for joint action in many fields.
 If it remains true, however, and it does, that the hopes of the world
 for peace with freedom continue to depend chiefly on a strong and
 confident Atlantic community, the problems it faces deserve high
 priority on the agenda of the Executive Branch and Congress.
 Authorized by resolution of the Senate, the Subcommittee on Na-
 tional Security and International Operations is reviewing the conduct
 of national security policy, with special reference to the Atlantic
 Alliance. Its approach is nonpartisan and professional.  During the
 first session of the 89th Congress, the subcommittee held hearings
 which laid the foundation for the present phase of the inquiry.
 At my request, the staff has taken a first-hand look at North
 Atlantic Treaty installations, and conferred with ranking civilian and
 military authorities, in this country and in Europe.  This subcom-
 mittee staff report, drawing on these studies and interviews, examines
 a number of key issues on which the subcommittee will hold hearings
 during the current session of Congress.

 Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security
 and International Operations.

 THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE : BASIC ISSUES
 I. The Problem
 The North Atlantic Alliance had its origins in the inability of the
 victor powers in World War II to make a European settlement.
 With Germany's defeat-and the presence of Soviet armies in the
 center of Europe-Stalin believed that Soviet power and influence
 could be extended deep into Western Europe.  The United States
 diagnosed the danger correctly, thanks to the interplay of minds
 between Marshall, Lovett, Clayton, Acheson, Senator Vandenberg,
 and President Truman.
 In 1947 and 1948, with the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall
 Plan, the United States undertook the two-fold task of halting Soviet
 expansion and rebuilding the strength of Western Europe.  Shortly
 after the coup in Czechoslovakia establishing a communist regime,
 Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United
 Kingdom, on March 17, 1948, signed a 50-year agreement for economic
 cooperation and common defense against aggression-the Brussels
 Treaty.  On the same day, referring to this action in a special message
 to a joint session of Congress on the threat to the freedom of Europe,
 President Truman declared that-
 the determination of the free countries of Europe to protect
 themselves will be matched by an equal determination on
 our part to help them to protect themselves.
 Soon thereafter General Marshall and Mr. Lovett held a series of
 consultations with Senator Vandenberg and other Senate leaders,
 and on June 11, 1948, the Senate adopted the Vandenberg Resolution
 affirming the objective of
 association of the United States, by constitutional process,
 with such regional and other collective arrangements as are
 based on continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid,
 and as affect its national security.
 The words had been carefully used in the order of their importance:
 "continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid".
 During July 1948, in the midst of the Berlin blockade, Mr. Lovett
 was authorized to begin exploratory talks in Washington with Canada
 and the parties to the Brussels Treaty.  By September the partici-
 pating representatives had reached agreement on the desirability and
 necessity of a treaty for the collective defense of the North Atlantic
 area and on the general nature of the treaty.  The governments
 concerned approved the recommendations of their representatives
 and the negotiation of the treaty was started in December and com-
 pleted on March 15, 1949.  Early in March, Norway joined the nego-
 tiations and that month invitations to become original signatories of
 the treaty were issued to Denmark, Iceland, Italy, and Portugal.

 2                THE ATLANTIC ALLIA     :  BASIC ISSUES
 Throughout the talks and negotiations, first Mr. Lovett and, after
 January 20, 1949, Mr. Acheson consulted regularly with Senator
 Vandenberg, Senator Connally, and other Senators.
 On April 4, 1949, the United States and Canada joined ten European
 states in signing the North Atlantic Treaty (Greece and Turkey
 became parties to the Treaty in 1952 and the Federal Republic of
 Germany in 1955).
 Articles 3 and 5 are the heart of the North Atlantic Treaty.
 The parties agreed (Article 3) that "in order more effectively to
 achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, separately and
 jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual
 aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity
 to resist armed attack."
 In addition it was agreed by the parties (Article 5) "that an armed
 attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall
 be considered an attack against them all" and consequently agreed
 "that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the
 right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51
 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties
 so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the
 other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use
 of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North
 Atlantic area."
 Like the Brussels Treaty, the North Atlantic Treaty also recognizes
 the interdependence of economic cooperation and a common defense.
 Article 2 obliges the parties, among other things, to "seek to eliminate
 conflict in their international economic policies" and to "encourage
 economic collaboration between any or all of them."
 The North Atlantic Treaty has no specified duration and continues
 in force for an indefinite period.  Article 12 provides that after 1959
 "the Parties shall, if any of them so requests, consult together for the
 purpose of reviewing the Treaty."  Article 13 stipulates that after
 twenty years-that is, in 1969-"any Party may cease to be a party
 one year after its notice of denunciation."
 The North Atlantic Alliance has worked-superbly.  It is the most
 effective peacetime alliance of modern times-perhaps since the
 Hanseatic League of the 14th and 15th centuries.       Unfortunately,
 however, in the politics of alliance it may be that nothing fails like
 success.
 The historic association of North America with Western Europe
 and the commitment of the United States and Canada to the defense
 of their allies in Europe contributed notably to their recovery. West-
 ern Europe has enjoyed a period of high prosperity and rapid growth.
 It has made important progress toward building a Western European
 economic community and together with the United States, Canada,
 Japan, and other nations it has reduced barriers to trade and devel-
 oped impressive practical measures of international monetary co-
 operation.  In their economic and financial relations these nations
 are demonstrating that collaboration and sovereignty are not mutu-
 ally exclusive but that one may reinforce the other.
 At the same time American strategic power and the other defensive
 forces of the Alliance have been greatly strengthened, both absolutely
 and relatively.  The balance of forces thus created since 1949 and the
 resolute response to Soviet expansionist probes-especially in Berlin
 and in the missile crisis in Cuba-have made the policy of deterrence

 effective.  It has closed the door to Soviet westward expansion.                  No
 armed attack has been made on Western Europe or North America,
 and provided an appropriate balance and resolve are maintained, none
 is likely.  What justifiable hope there is of a genuine European settle-
 ment rests on Soviet recognition of, and respect for, the durability of
 this balance and the constancy of this resolve.
 Nevertheless, the very success of the Alliance in influencing Soviet
 behavior has partly obscured the relationship between the forces and
 firmness of the Alliance and the moderation of Soviet policy, and has
 encouraged wishful thinking about the possibilities of a European
 settlement, if not of more far-reaching agreements, with the Soviet
 Union.  In some quarters the advantages of alliance are now being
 discounted, while the disadvantages loom larger-it limits freedom
 of action, it complicates diplomacy, it costs money, the stability it
 affords is mistaken for rigidity.  A desire to experiment-with nation-
 alism, with arms limitation, with rapprochement-is gaining support.
 Manlio Brosio, Secretary General of NATO, made this comment to
 the 1965 NATO Parliamentarians' Conference:
 * * * all of us are agreed that the world has changed since
 1949, and that the Alliance may have to change with it,
 though here, of course, is where the divergencies start, in
 that all of us have our own ideas on why it should change and
 in what directions.
 There is no one NATO problem: there are as many as there are
 allies who want changes, and allies who are asked to accept changes
 the-,r believe unwise.
 But if there is no one problem, there are four key questions:
 1. How do the allies perceive the Soviet threat?  Does
 a united effort still have priority as a means of deterring
 Soviet domination of Western Europe and of winning even-
 tual Soviet acceptance of a genuine European settlement?
 2. How does France perceive the Atlantic Alliance in
 relation to the achievement of French aims?  As a vehicle
 in need of repairs?  Or as one ready for the scrap heap?
 3. What lessons can be learned from experience with
 the decision-making processes of the Alliance?
 4. Can the inter-allied dialogue be moved onto a prac-
 tical footing-away from theoretical questions and back to
 brass-tacks issues of real concern to governments?
 II. The Soviet Threat
 Twenty years after the end of World War II, a genuine European
 settlement is still far distant.  As C. B. Marshall told the subcom-
 mittee:
 The most salutary thing for the strength and durability of
 NATO is to get our perspectives straight about the probabili-
 ties-rather the improbabilities-of coming to an acceptable
 settlement with the Soviet Union.

 4                THE ATLANTIC ALLIA BASIC ISSUES
 Since Stalin and the start of the cold war, a major goal of American
 policy has been to bring it to a conclusion on terms that serve the
 legitimate interests of all the parties concerned.  The relative tem-
 pering of Soviet behavior under Stalin's successors has led some
 Americans and some Europeans to believe that at long last the Soviet
 Union is ready to move toward a genuine settlement.  Some people
 even see Communist China as the one disturbing and aggressive
 world power and the Sino-Soviet quarrel as a doorway through which
 the Soviet Union may step to rejoin Western civilization.
 The Atlantic allies must of course be ready to welcome any and all
 serious moves by the Soviet Union in the direction of a European
 settlement, but the watchword of allied policy should remain vigi-
 lance-for it is not weakness but strength that exerts an attractive
 force in world affairs.
 Moscow now appears to have some understanding of the need for
 preventing nuclear war by accident, miscalculation, or failure of
 communication.  There are cases, like the hot line and the limited
 nuclear test-ban treaty, where we may find common ground with the
 Soviets on specific problems.  But there is as yet no hard evidence
 that the Soviet Union has given up the contest for Europe, or aban-
 doned its goal to break up the association of Western Europe and
 North America, or is ready to turn to serious efforts to settle basic
 political conflicts with the West.  On the contrary, the contest for
 Europe-in low key for the moment-is still with us, and Soviet
 forces remain in the center of Europe.  The Soviet government con-
 tinues to invest an increasing share of its resources in arms, to push
 hard for major advances in critical new weapons, and to reject in-
 ternationally inspected and controlled arrangements for the limitation
 of arms.
 It is evident that the law of change is at work inside the Soviet Union
 and in Eastern Europe as elsewhere.  Not so easy to see is how it will
 affect Soviet ambition and policy.      We cannot be confident that a
 Soviet Union which may enjoy some political stability with less use of
 repression, and which may maintain a favorable rate of economic
 growth, will exert less political influence around the world or be less
 determined to prevail.  Nor can we discount the danger that the
 reassertion of the national interests of the Eastern European countries
 will lead to new forms of crisis to which the West has given little
 thought.  There is always the possibility that Moscow may try to
 restore the unity of the Eastern European nations by manufacturing
 a crisis centered on Germany.
 Nor does discord between Moscow and Peking necessarily increase
 the likelihood of substantive settlements in Europe.  In fact, the
 incessant Chinese criticism of Soviet leadership as insufficiently
 militant, and whatever gains for Red China her combativeness may
 produce, are generating pressures on Moscow to demonstrate its own
 militancy.  Events in Asia could have a backlash in the Atlantic
 area. Soviet leaders, of course, are not unconcerned with Chinese
 expansionism.   On some problems and in some areas of Asia, Western
 nations and the Soviet Union may find it desirable-in terms of their
 own interests-to follow roughly parallel courses.  But we cannot
 assume that Moscow and Peking are headed for a final separation.
 In time, with the passing from the scene of Mao Tse-tung, some
 reconciliation is conceivable.

 If Soviet policy in Europe continues to be relatively moderate, it is
 because "objective conditions", as the Communists say, impose such
 a policy.  Should the balance of forces be upset, for example, should
 there be major confusion in NATO or a break-up of the Alliance so
 that the Soviets do not confront a strong, united front of Western
 Europe and North America but rather a Western Europe divided
 again into a number of weak and competing nations, "objective
 conditions" would encourage the Soviet rulers to take bolder actions
 and run greater risks-and Berlin is always there, if no other target of
 opportu;uty is handy.  We could expect a European crisis of un-
 predictable magnitude.
 The key issue is the division of Germany.  The reunification of
 Germany has been a goal of Western policy because, so long as
 Germany is split, the division will be an unsettling factor in European
 and, indeed, world affairs.  In the words of President Johnson in
 December 1964:
 * * * our friends and comrades throughout Germany deserve
 assurance from their allies that there shall be no acceptance
 of the lasting threat to peace which is the forced division
 of Germany.  No one seeks to end this grim and dangerous
 injustice by force.  But there can be no stable peace in
 Europe while one part of Germany is denied the basic right
 to choose freely its own destiny and to choose, without
 threat to anyone, reunion with the Germans in the Federal
 Republic.
 Unfortunately, however, there is no way to make the reunification
 of Germany a practical short-run goal of Western policy.  It cannot
 be bought with any concessions consistent with German national
 interests or Western interests.  It cannot be compelled by measures
 short of war.  It cannot be imagined except in the context of~a general
 European settlement.  And such a settlement requires it change in
 the Soviet conception of Russian national interests-at a minimum a
 reliable change in the means by which the Soviet leaders pursue their
 goals.
 A European settlement will be the product of Western strength,
 firmness, and patience, coupled with a willingness on each side to give
 and accept appropriate guarantees of the security of the other.  The
 failure to obtain a settlement is not to be explained by a refusal of Vie,
 West to recognize the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union.  It is
 not explained by a lack of imagination in the West.  It is not, as
 some now find it fashionable to say, a lack of "bright ideas" or "bril-
 liant policy proposals" but a lack of Soviet interest in any terms that
 do not take as a premise the continued Soviet hold on the Warsaw
 Pact countries, and, in particular, East Germany.
 There are some doubts in Western Europe about the steadiness and
 coherence of American policy toward East-West relations.  The
 United States has not yet brought its foreign o receipts about and the payments
 grow
 into balance, with the result that doubts
 ability of the United States to support its European policies.  In its
 enthusiasm for a European settlement, the United States government
 has pursued the will-of-the-wisp of rapprochement with the Soviet
 Union, even though this raises in Western Europe, especially in West
 Germany, the specter of bilateral Soviet-American deals at the

 expense of European interests.  In their zeal for arms control and
 disarmament American officials have b(,r"i truing to n~~gotiato it non-
 proliferation agreement with the Soviet Union-as though the West
 had reason to fear that the Soviet Union might be about to assist its
 satellites or other states to acquire nuclear capabilities!  An obvious
 danger is that major concessions will be made on our side without any
 compensating change of policy on the Soviet side.
 For the United States to show unsureness and unsteadiness in its
 perception of the continuing Soviet threat is especially disturbing.
 Despite the remarkable recovery of the Western European allies, they
 do not have, separately or jointly, the strength to counter Soviet
 pressures.  For the United States to toy with the idea of rapproche-
 ment, therefore, is to tempt its allies into unilateral exploration of the
 possibilities of transforming their relations with the Soviet Union-
 and thus to create new opportunities for Soviet diplomacy to achieve
 what Soviet arms and pressures have been unable to win.
 The West must not overlook any signs of willingness on the Soviet
 side to move towards a European settlement.  There may be useful
 initiatives to take in finding specific measures to reduce the danger of
 war, and in such fields as East-West trade. But the West should act
 together-or it will risk upsetting the balance on which the hopes of a
 genuine settlement rest.
 President de Gaulle advocates what he calls a "European Europe"
 existing "by itself for itself"-a phrase which seems to mean a Europe
 independent of America.  But for a long time to come a Western
 Europe isolated from the United States would not exist "by itself for
 itself" except at the sufferance of the Soviet Union.  And, of course,
 the French President knows this.  A Europe effectively protecting
 itself "by itself" is far from De Gau]]e's thoughts.  He is assuming the
 constant protection of American nuclear power, no matter what he
 says or does.
 The United States also wants an independent Europe, meaning
 that we see no necessary conflict between European independence
 and Atlantic cooperation.
 The original American conception, in the time of Marshall and
 Lovett, was of one Europe-"the European world", "Europe as a
 whole".  That is still the American objective.  As in the past, the
 United States hopes for a genuine European settlement, one which
 would make possible, among other things, the reciprocal withdrawal
 of American and Soviet forces from central Europe.
 There is, in short, no real inconsistency between a truly independent
 Europe and the objectives of the United States and other allies.  But
 no member of the Alliance will advance this goal through bilateral
 dealings with the Soviet Union on the security of Europe--it will
 jeopardize them.  Even the most expert judo artist cannot make
 "united we fall, divided we stand" a formula to advance the integrity
 of Europe as a whole.
 Now, as in 1949, the foundation of the Alliance is a working agree-
 ment among the allies on what the Soviet threat is and how to deal
 with it-together.

 III.  The French Challenge
 No one, possibly including President de Gaulle, knows exactly
 what, in practical terms, the French position on allied cooperation is.
 In the judgment of its partners in the EEC, France has been less
 than faithful to its obligations under the Treaty of Rome-but it has
 not slammed the door.  Similarly, in international financial matters,
 its on-again, off-again policies-now shaking confidence in the gold
 exchange standard, now assisting to shore it up in a crisis-reflect both
 French reluctance to cooperate and also to sacrifice the benefits of
 cooperation.
 With respect to NATO, France has, on the one hand: withdrawn
 its Mediterranean and Atlantic Fleets from NATO; assigned to NATO
 only small French air and ground forces (about 60,000 men) ; refused
 to permit non-French controlled nuclear weapons on French territory;
 withdrawn French naval personnel from certain high NATO command
 posts; not accepted the 1962 NATO Council  idelines for the use of
 nuclear weapons; not committed itself to consult with its allies on the
 use of these weapons in contingencies of an ambiguous nature;
 announced its refusal to participate in the 1966 FALLEX program;
 not participated in the ten-nation special nuclear committee.
 On the other hand, France took a strong stand in both Berlin crises
 and gave immediate support to President Kennedy at the time of
 the Cuban missile crisis.  It continues to provide valuable facilities
 to NATO, a French officer is Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces
 Central Europe, and other French officers participate fully in the work
 of several international commands.  It engages, on a bilateral basis,
 with its allies on various projects, such as joint French-American
 space research.
 President de Gaulle himself states the French position on NATO in
 these terms:
 Above all, it is a question of keeping ourselves free of any
 vassalage.  It is true that, in many areas, we have the best
 reasons for associating with others.  But on condition of re-
 taining our self-determination.  Thus, so long as the soli-
 darity of the Western peoples appears to us necessary for
 the eventual defense of Europe, our country will remain the
 ally of her allies but, upon the expiration of the commit-
 ments formerly taken-that is, in 1969 by the latest-the
 subordination known as "integration" which is provided for
 by NATO and which hands our fate over to foreign author-
 ity shall cease, as far as we are concerned.
 When war can mean anything between instant, massive destruction
 and a limited probe with conventional forces, deterrence requires an
 instant readiness to respond appropriately.  This, in turn, has dic-
 tated the deployment of large allied forces in Western Europe and of
 allied naval forces in Atlantic and Mediterranean waters.  A corol-
 lary requirement has been the creation of some kind of allied com-
 mand organization.  Allied Command Europe and the Supreme Head-
 quarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) were activated by General
 Eisenhower on April 2, 1951.  Allied Command Atlantic and Head-
 quarters, Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) were
 activated a year later.

 8             THE ATLANTIC ALLI        BASIC ISSUES
 In peacetime the international commands, like SHAPE and
 SACLANT, are primarily planning agencies with such duties as the
 development and recommendation of force requirements.  They also
 have certain responsibilities for developing and maintaining bases and
 supply and communication facilities, for training and exercises for an
 emergency and, in the case of SHAPE, for training inspection of
 assigned units to ascertain if they meet agreed standards, and for
 operational control of certain forces, such as air defense forces.  These
 must be ready for operations on very short notice, have certain on-
 going patrol responsibilities, and must be dispersed on bases in several
 countries.  The fundamental justification of the international com-
 mands is to be ready and able to take charge, within minutes, of the
 forces which would come under their control in an emergency-and
 thus, by virtue of such readiness, to strengthen the deterrent power
 of the Alliance.
 In peacetime, however, until a certain stage of alert exists, national
 forces (with a few exceptions) remain under national command.  The
 international commands do not infringe upon the sovereignty of the
 members nor do they violate the principle of the equality of all mem-
 bers.  No member can be compelled to accept a plan with which it
 does not agree, or to provide facilities against its will, or to designate
 forces which would be assigned to the international commands in an
 emergency.  There is, in short, no "integration" except as members
 freely agree to coordinate their policies and forces.  It may be won-
 dered whether the objection to "integration" is really a way of deny-
 ing the need for coordination.
 To date, the French have talked about NATO in such abstract,
 ambiguous, and theoretical terms as "vassalage", "subordination",
 and "integration", and the discussion has not been put on what Secre-
 tary General Brosio calls "a practical footing".
 Of course, France may bow out completely from the unified mili-
 tary commands.  If France insists on moving NATO military facili-
 ties out of France, or on an effective veto on their use, it will become
 extremely difficult to devise a sound plan for the defense of Western
 Europe.  One need only look at a map to learn why the facts of geog-
 raphy make France an important member of the Alliance.  But allied
 contingency studies show that it would be possible-though costly-
 to replace the bases, lines of supply and communication, and other
 facilities now located in France.
 France may decide to request a review of the North Atlantic Treaty
 in accordance with Article 12.  That has been the right of any mem-
 ber since 1959.
 France may even withdraw from NATO in accordance with Article
 13.  It would be unwise to assume, however, that French withdrawal
 is a fixed and unalterable intention.  It is not, after all, likely that
 the "solidarity of the Western peoples" will appear unnecessary for
 the defense of Western Europe in 1969.
 And even French withdrawal need not mean the end of NATO.
 On the contrary, the appropriate policy for France's allies would
 then be the policy of "the empty chair"-to leave a place for
 France at the table and to await, and work for, her return.
 The French President now deliberately displays a policy of inde-
 pendence from allies, while accepting the benefits of the American
 nuclear umbrella.  He is playing a very risky game-counting on

 the American commitment regardless of what he does or what happens
 to the Atlantic Alliance.  The risks include a real possibility of
 alienating the United States.
 The American commitment to help the allies to defend themselves
 was made on the assumption that each of the allies was determined
 to do its part in a cooperative undertaking.  But, in the words of
 Dirk Stikker, former Secretary General of NATO:
 This vaunted complete independence of action has created an
 atmosphere of incompatibility of both aims and methods be-
 tween France and nearly all of its allies.                                     He who insists on
 retaining his complete independence of action can never be
 counted on as a devoted and staunch member of any alliance.
 Much clarity on all sides is needed about the price of "going it
 alone."  If the French government does not consider the Alliance
 important enough to do its part, then the importance of France as an
 ally will unavoidably diminish-as the other allies do what they can
 to make the Alliance work without France.  It may become necessary
 to revise and reduce the American commitment to the defense of
 France.
 Under the circumstances, the United States must work closely with
 Great Britain and West Germany and the other allies who can and
 do see their common interest in a common defense.  If the key
 Atlantic allies move ahead together on the urgent issues-as they
 have the right and duty to do-sober second thoughts may in time
 prevail in the great and ancient French nation.
 IV.  The Consultative Process
 The membership of the Atlantic Alliance includes great powers and
 lesser powers, each with its own economic and military potential, its
 own geographical and historical associations, and its distinct per-
 spective: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany,
 Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg,  the Netherlands, Norway,
 Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States.
 The Alliance in operation is a group of governments-that is, of
 officials-on-the-job with particular responsibilities and particular
 interests who have varying hopes and expectations about how the
 Alliance may be useful in advancing their concerns.  Because allies
 are governments, their actions are the product of internal bargaining
 among the bureaus, lobbies, and personalities comprising their own
 political system.  As Richard Neustadt said to the subcommittee:
 The impulse to collaborate is not a law of nature.  It
 emerges from within, arising on the job, expressive of a need
 for someone else's aid or service * * * if one government
 would influence the actions of another, it must find means to
 convince enough men and the right men on the other side
 that what it wants is what they need for their own purposes,
 in their own jobs, comporting with their own internally
 inspired hopes and fears, so that they will pursue it for them-
 selves in their own bargaining arena.  This is what we did,
 with Stalin's help-and economic crisis-in Europe nearly
 20 years ago.

 Alliance institutions, civil and military, are not sovereign author-
 ities, but creatures of the member governments-and governments
 alone possess the ability to act. Thus, the importance of the North
 Atlantic Council and other Alliance organizations, beyond their ob-
 vious symbolic value, turns on their usefulness as quiet corners
 where ministers from different capitals get together, and on their
 actual capacity to produce results of utility to key men inside member
 governments.  If the views of the Council, the international com-
 mands, and other agencies are to attract the top-level attention of
 national governments, they must point the way to the practical
 compromises which are the very heart of joint action.
 The organization of NATO is, therefore, an important but secondary
 subject-the cart, not the horse-of allied concerns.
 It sometimes appears to be more important than it is because the
 processes of consultation within the Alliance are not producing
 agreement-and because, as often happens within our own govern-
 ment, disputes over high policy are cloaked as disagreements over
 organizational issues.  Things cannot be worked out that way.
 Consultative processes produce an alliance's decisions-they are
 its surrogate for executive authority.  If they are not effective, the
 alliance will lack direction and energy.
 Within our own government, we are painfully aware of the difficulty
 of deciding on new policies.  Decisions are difficult enough when the
 decision-making process culminates in  a President.  Within  an
 alliance, not only are the issues inherently more difficult (because a
 wider variety of interests are affected) but also decisions have, in the
 nature of things, the character of a common denominator.  That is,
 they must be acceptable to a group of governments and must be
 watered down or compromised until they are acceptable.
 There is, of course, no rule of unanimity in NATO, despite the
 widespread belief to the contrary. The emphasis of the Treaty is on
 separate and joint action to maintain and develop the individual and
 collective capacity to resist aggression (Article 3), and on such action,
 individually and in concert with others, as each ally deems necessary
 in response to an attack (Article 5).  The only requirement in the
 Treaty for unanimity is for the admission of new members.  In
 practice, the operations of the Alliance have confirmed. that each
 member does not have to participate in everything the others do-
 and that no member can prevent the others from taking a joint
 action they wish to take.
 The absence of a rule of unanimity does not diminish, however, the
 desirability of unanimity. A member may be unable to block a joint
 action by the others, but if it feels strongly, it may refuse to cooperate
 on other matters or even denounce the Treaty.  Practical wisdom
 dictates that a great effort should be made to reach full agreement on
 important issues and programs, particularly those relating to the
 credibility of the deterrent and relations with the Soviet Union.
 In the happiest circumstances, crisp decisions by a group of gov-
 ernments are hard to come by, and the accommodations made in
 arriving at agreement should be treasured, not lightly discarded.
 Continuity with a second-best policy may be better than to push a
 better one at the cost of not agreeing on any policy at all. As General
 Norstad testified :

 We should not destroy the foundation under which we are
 working until we know we can produce a better one.  Not
 that there is not a better one, because there is always a better
 one, but the criterion against which we judge this is not
 whether or not there is a better policy, a better plan, or a
 better strategy.  The criterion must be: Can we get a better
 one accepted?
 Unfortunately, the United States government has not always
 taken this view.
 A case in point: in 1962 the United States abruptly shifted to a
 strategy of. "flexible response."  There was little or no consultation
 with our allies, and the shift was explained in terms which, to say the
 least, caused doubt and confusion about what kind of counterblows
 the United States might be planning in the event of a Soviet attack
 on Europe.  To some in Europe it looked as though the United
 States would rather switch than fight.  The change in American doc-
 trine forced modifications in allied military doctrine as well, thus
 painfully underlining for the allies how little influence they had on
 American policies of life and death importance to them.  The diffi-
 culties thereby created have not yet been overcome, especially perhaps
 in relations with France, whose President, like most chiefs of state,
 does not accept short shrift easily.
 This advice to the allies from the Committee of Three in 1956 is
 still good advice:
 * * * any variations in plans and strategic policies which may
 be required need not weaken NATO or the confidence of its
 members in NATO and in each other; providing, and the
 proviso is decisive, that each member retains its will and its
 capacity to play its full part in discharging the political com-
 mitment for collective action against aggression which it
 undertook when it signed the Pact; providing also-and
 recent events have shown that this is equally important-that
 any changes in national strategy or policy which affect the
 coalition are made only after collective consideration.
 At present, nuclear questions are troubling and dividing the allies.
 The problem is complex, involving considerations of national prestige,
 inter-allied confidence, strategy, and East-West relations.  The time
 is past, certainly, for trying to deal with this problem on the basis
 that our European allies are equal but that one is less equal than
 others.  It is not difficult to define what is wanted: a strategy which
 will effectively support the policy of deterrence, and arrangements
 which will win the confidence of the European allies in American
 support of the strategy in an emergency.  Clearly, Soviet pressure
 should not deter the allies from doing what needs to be done-on
 that basis NATO itself would never have been created and West
 Germany would never have been permitted to join-but at the same
 time there is no point in taking militarily unnecessary measures unless
 it is clear that the political advantages outweigh the political disad-
 vantages.
 Beginning with the hasty improvisation of the concept of the multi-
 lateral nuclear force, organizational salve has been prescribed for a
 distressing political irritation-but the salve has converted the
 irritation into a five-year itch.

 12              THE ATLANTIC ALLIME:  BASIC ISSUES
 Clearly, since the United States has 95 percent or more of total
 Western nuclear capabilities, it necessarily and unavoidably has the
 decisive power, positive and negative, with respect to the use of these
 nuclear weapons.  And that power is and will be located in Washing-
 ton; no President can delegate it to anyone else.
 However it may be accomplished, therefore, Canada and the Euro-
 pean allies need greater access to the policy counsels of the United
 States-and vice versa-not just regarding the more remote con-
 tingencies of nuclear war, but also the ambiguous challenges that a
 flexible communist strategy makes probable.  What the allies, in-
 cluding West Germany, need is confidence that they are, in fact,
 involved in major issues of strategic and political planning in such
 ways as to influence the actions of the United States government in
 a crisis.  And again, vice versa.
 Here is where organizational imaginativeness is needed, rather
 than a managerial pseudo-science which formally locates power in
 bodies to which no member government will in fact delegate real
 authority.
 For example, there is every good reason why the allied capitals in
 Europe and. North America should be linked by the most effective
 communications arrangements that modern technology has made
 possible.   There is still much to be done to update present
 arrangements.
 For another example, we should be able to find ways of involving
 allied military officers more deeply in strategic planning that will
 receive a President's attention-without altering in any essential way
 the President's final powers of decision.  SHAPE and SACLAN T now
 participate in the Joint Strategic Planning System, based on the U.S.
 Strategic Air Command at Omaha, Nebraska, and allied officers are
 stationed at the headquarters of U.S. Strategic Air Command.  In
 addition, since 1963, the United States has committed three POLARIS
 submarines to the planning control of SHAPE.  The United Kingdom
 has similarly committed RAF Bomber Command.  Such arrange-
 ments are a good start.
 The steps now being taken to develop a special nuclear committee
 may also be useful, especially if such a committee can be located in
 Washington where it could involve key men in the central and most
 worrisome problems of strategy and give them access to each other
 on matters high on the agenda of national governments.
 What is required is access of key men to key men-at the North
 Atlantic Council and by new consultative arrangements close to, or
 closely linked with, the centers of national decision-making.
 Lord Ismay, first Secretary General of NATO, paid a well-deserved
 tribute to the statesmen who negotiated the North Atlantic Treaty:
 They did not attempt, at the outset, to draw up a blueprint
 of the international organization which should be set up,
 or to lay down any hard and fast rules of procedure.  They
 realized that these could only be evolved step by step in the
 light of practical experience * * *

 V.  A Practical Footing
 The North Atlantic Alliance remains what it was created to be in
 1949-an agreement among sovereign states for their defense, with
 all that implies in terms of political, economic, and military collabora-
 tion.
 It does not exist in isolation, however.  OECD, the Group of Ten,
 EEC, EFTA, the Kennedy Round, and other bodies and arrangements
 are concerned with economic and financial problems of the North
 Atlantic allies and like-minded states around the world.  Normal
 bilateral relations-private and governmental-between all these
 countries deal with political, economic, cultural, and military affairs.
 In short, difficult though it may be to name or define, these nations
 form a community and their community of interests finds expression
 in a rich variety of relationships.
 The North Atlantic Alliance is but one link, albeit an extremely
 important link, in this chain of institutions, arrangements, and re-
 lations, and there is no point in trying to make NATO into something
 more than it is by duplicating the work of other agencies, or to find
 artificial tasks for it, such as the promotion of cultural exchanges, to
 keep it busy or enhance its importance.
 Moreover, for the United States or any other member to expect
 help from its allies on matters outside the scope of the North Atlantic
 Treaty, and outside the obligations undertaken by the members in
 other alliances and arrangements, may put a heavy strain on the
 Alliance.  Members can, of course, properly seek to win understand-
 ing and support for their policies outside the North Atlantic area
 through bilateral channels, and NATO organs may provide useful
 opportunities for one ally to explain to others what it is doing and
 why, but the Alliance itself does not entitle one ally to claim the
 support of others on matters outside the Treaty.
 In the words of Secretary General Brosio:
 To extend the scope-geographically and otherwise-of the
 obligations the allied countries undertook in 1949 would not
 be easy.  It would have to be very carefully considered and
 the pros and cons very cautiously weighed.  In any event
 we must beware, lest in seeking to improve the Alliance and
 strengthen our ties, we bring about precisely the opposite re-
 sult and cause a split in it.
 If the threat to the allies changes or if their interests would be
 served by a change in the scope of NATO's concerns-if, for example,
 Communist China proves in due course to be the principal threat to
 their survival in freedom or if economic, social, and cultural develop-
 ments make closer political links between the allies desirable-the
 time will come when the allies may wish to re-form NATO to meet the
 new challenges and opportunities.
 But at the moment the urgent task is to put the inter-allied dialogue
 on a practical footing-to cope with the hard issues of the present.
 Getting to work on them is, in any case, the only way of building a
 foundation for the future.
 All agree, President de Gaulle included, that the Alliance has un-
 finished business.  Its record since 1949 is one in which all can rightly
 take pride.  But alliances are mortal.  Like old generals, they may

 14              THE ATLANTIC ALLI    BASIC ISSUES
 simply fade away unless they are used by, and useful to, national gov-
 ernments in dealing with their real, pressing problems.
 The North Atlantic Alliance has not yet achieved its initial, and
 still its fundamental, purpose-which is a genuine European settle-
 ment.  The phrase is too easy to utter, perhaps, to suggest what a
 drastic change for the better a genuine settlement would mean in
 the world environment.  It would be tragic were the Soviet Union
 to accomplish, by allied default, its long-standing goal of destroying
 the Alliance at a time when a potentially stable balance of forces-
 the essential precondition of a genuine settlement-has been achieved.
 The foremost issue facing the Alliance is, therefore, a working agree-
 ment on policies toward the Soviet Union.
 Another real issue is an understanding with our allies on what it
 may be necessary and desirable to do to simplify the over-proliferated
 international command structure-preserving its essential elements
 and strengthening its effectiveness while discarding the tinsel and
 furbelows-and to meet the costs, political as well as economic, of
 doing so.
 Another down-to-earth issue is burden-sharing.  In viewing national
 shares in the costs of protecting the North Atlantic area, inequities
 are apparent: the burden falls more heavily on some, including the
 United States, than the others.  The problem is bound to become
 of more concern for the United States because of its relation to our
 payments difficulties and of our mounting expenditures for defense
 of other areas of importance to the entire free world.  The time is not
 far off when the allies must squarely face this problem in line with
 their obligations under Article 3 of the Treaty for "continuous and
 effective self-help and mutual aid."
 Other practical issues are allied military strategy, including the role
 of nuclear weapons, the role of the non-nuclear powers in nuclear mat-
 ters, the size and composition of conventional forces, and such ques-
 tions as procurement and weapons standardization.
 The Alliance, like any other political arrangement, requires leader-
 ship, and the facts of power impose a special responsibility for
 leadership on the United States.
 Leadership is needed within a national government if divergent
 interests are not to stymie progress.  It is even more necessary in an
 alliance, where decisions must be the product of the round table and
 where the highest position any ally can attain is primus inter pares.
 The United States will have no one but itself to blame if our
 preoccupation with other important areas of the world keeps us from
 showing imagination and sound judgment in the affairs of the Atlantic
 community-and from showing the largeness of mind needed to
 reconcile national interests with the needs for joint action.
 It may be that under the pressure of events the conduct of Atlantic
 affairs has gotten into a rut, that issues and approaches have become
 stereotyped, and that our responses to events have become almost
 ritualistic.  Some new heads may be needed to get the dialogue back
 onto a practical footing.
 In any event, the problems of the Atlantic Alliance call for more
 and better attention on the part of our government than they are
 receiving.
