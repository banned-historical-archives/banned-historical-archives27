 Mao's Legacy and China's Foreign Policy
 On April 15,  1977, China's new leadership released
 Volume V of Mao Tse-tung's Selected Works to the public
 with great fanfare and ceremony.   Unlike the earlier
 volumes of Mao's speeches and articles,  this is the first
 time Mao himself did not control the final selection and
 annotation of articles.   The conclusion drawn from this,
 most succinctly stated by Ross Munro in the Christian
 Science Monitor, is that "by analyzing how the works from
 1949 to 1957  (the years covered in the new edition)  are
 compiled and annotated, it will perhaps be possible to
 gain some clues for understanding in what direction the
 post-Mao Chinese leaders plan to take the country."   This
 is not an unwarranted conclusion, but a few caveats must
 be mentioned.
 First of all, the preparatory work for the new edition
 did not begin with Mao's death in September 1976.   Accord-
 ing to an article by Hua Kuo-feng, Mao himself expressed
 interest in compiling a fifth volume of his works as early
 as 1969, and delegated the task to Chou En-lai and Kang
 Sheng.    It should be assumed that at least a portion of
 this work was completed by 1976, and that Mao was con-
 sulted along the way.  A second consideration is the po-
 litical hazard involved in altering Mao's works, using
 them too selectively or distorting them.   The "gang of
 four" attacked Teng Hsiao-ping for doing this, and the
 Hua regime has accused the "gang" of exactly the same
 crime. The present leadership would leave itself open
 to later attack if it were to perform such surgery on
 Mao's canons.   In that regard, it is interesting to note
 that, in comparison with earlier volumes,  there are fewer
 explanatory footnotes and annotations in Volume V.   Mao's
 words are allowed to stand by themselves, with little
 exegesis.
 The most important consideration in analyzing Volume
 V is, of course, the selection of articles and speeches

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/26: CIA-RDP79T00912A001100010024-1
 from the vast body of Mao's words over this eight-year
 period.   Mao, of course, is nothing if not a flexible
 theoretician.   His words have been used, with or without
 his consent, to bolster lesser leaders at all points
 along the Chinese political spectrum.   It is beyond doubt,
 then, that the new regime has selected those speeches
 and articles which best support their policy intentions.
 Certainly, Volume V would have been markedly different
 if Chang Chun-chiao had been in charge of compiling it.
 In the realm of foreign relations, Volume V does
 not appear to signal any shifts from current policies.
 This in itself is significant insofar as the 1949-57
 period can be generally described as the period of the
 greatest Sino-Soviet amity and greatest Sino-US hostility.
 In other words,  the Hua regime editors have used the
 1949-57 Mao to support the 1960-76 Mao in the realm of
 foreign policy, a piece of historical revision with which
 Mao himself probably would have concurred.   This is accom-
 plished in two ways in Volume V.   One is in the exclusion
 of certain speeches or articles from this period
 The other method is in the rat er
 calm, detached, and generally bland discussion of the
 Soviet Union and the US that is included in the new
 volume.

 There is, not surprisingly,  little in Volume V that
 could be construed as even the faintest of praise for
 the US or its allies.   The discussion of the US, however,
 could have been a great deal harsher than it is.   Volume
 IV, for instance, ends up with a series of articles per-
 sonally denouncing various US leaders and their policies.
 This theme does not continue in Volume V, nor are Volume
 V readers treated to the kind of vitriolic condemnation
 of American society that became such standard fare in
 the Chinese press during the Korean war.   Mao in Volume
 V mentions "contradictions" within US society on several
 occasions, but does not go into any detail.   It is quite
 possible that certain portions have been edited out of
 this discussion.   To be sure,  the attitude toward the
 US is consistently antipathetic and derogatory, but many
 of the criticisms, even during the Korean war period,
 seem somewhat unemotional and stereotyped.   There are
 many strong statements, of course, such as in "The Atomic
 Bomb Cannot Frighten the Chinese People," and "US
 Imperialism Is a Paper Tiger," but given the nature of
 the US-Chinese relationship at that time, they seem rather
 mild.
 There is a noticeable lack of material on Chinese
 relations with the rest of the world.   Although there
 are various references to solidarity with the oppressed
 peoples of the world, support for revolutions,  and unity
 with all who oppose imperialism, there is a lack of de-
 tail.  Mao, of course, left the majority of the detailed
 work on foreign policy to Premier Chou En-lai, who was
 quite active during this period seeking recognition and
 normalized relations with the nonaligned world.
 In sum, Volume V, as far as foreign policy is con-
 cerned, is rather bland.   Mao is not lavish in his praise

 of the Soviets before 1956, nor harsh in his criticism
 of them thereafter.   His discussion of the US is often
 derogatory, but usually desultory.   Mao's chief interests
 during this period were not foreign policy related--that
 came later.   From 1949-1957, Mao was chiefly concerned
 with economic recovery and development, party consolida-
 tion, and suppression of opposition.   He linked these
 interests to China's relationship with the Soviet Union
 only later, though some dissatisfaction is evident in
 these writings.
 It is interesting to note that the regime has thus
 far done little to direct Chinese readers toward the
 foreign policy articles in Volume V.   The introductory
 article by the compilation committee selects passages
 which criticize both the US and USSR, and Hua Kuo-feng's
 long People's Daily article of May 1,  1977 does like-
 relations
 with the US and USSR.   "In the 1960s and 1970s,
 a change took place in the world situation.   The emer-
 gence of Soviet social-imperialism provided the world
 with another outstanding teacher by negative example.
 Likethe other superpower, it became the common enemy
 of the world's people....   The role which Soviet social-
 imperialism is playing as a teacher by negative example
 cannot be matched by anyone in the world today."   It is
 possible that such statements reflect the regime's con-
 cern that even their careful selections of Mao's writings
 not lead to any confusion concerning the main anti-Soviet
 A May 7 People's Daily article seeks to correct the
 impression that the Chinese are attempting to balance their
 orientation of China's present foreign policy.

 Yu Chiu-li's Message to Taching
 The national Taching industrial conference, which
 reaffirmed, in general, the pragmatic developmental goals
 usually associated with the late Chou En-lai, closed in
 Peking on May 13 after a series of well-organized but
 rather unspectacular meetings, speeches, and reports.
 Although both Party Chairman Hua Kuo-feng and Minister of
 National Defense Yeh-chien-ying spoke at the Taching con-
 ference,  it was State Planning Commission Chief Yu Chiu-li
 who provided the most informative report.
 In his report, Yu Chiu-li complained that despite the
 serious damage done to China's industrial production--es-
 pecially within the iron and steel industry--by the "gang
 of four," most industries had made impressive gains since
 the purge of the leading leftists.  However, instead of
 complementing the iron and steel industry, Yu merely as-
 serted that it was now in a position to "end its stagna-
 tion and advance steadily."
 The overriding message of Yu's report was as straight-
 forward as the famous "Taching spirit," itself: strict dis-
 cipline and hard work are essential for China's immediate
 economic recovery and future modernization.  However, Yu
 did make reference to the sensitive issue of wage reform,
 an issue which has created many serious tensions between
 the leadership and the workers in recent years.   But Yu's
 reference to the wage reform issue was both indirect and
 noncommittal.  He first condemned material incentives in
 general as incorrect Soviet-style practices that had been
 mistakenly applied to the Chinese economy in the early
 1950s.   Yu then dodged the issue completely by announcing
 that a "special conference" would be held sometime in the
 future to "tackle the problems involved in employment and
 wage rates."
 Yu Chiu-li's report was a remarkable combination of
 Mao Tse-tung's "great leap forward" spirit and Chou En-lai's
 reasoned pragmatism.   At one point, Yu quoted from a Mao

 speech originally given to a meeting of leading party
 cadres in advance of the eighth national party congress
 in 1956, but first released only recently in Volume V of
 the Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung.   In this speech Mao
 instructed the cadres that it was  "an obligation" to over-
 take the US economically "in 50 or 60 years."   Yu then
 referred to Chou En-lai's report to the fourth national
 people's congress of 1975 where the late premier laid
 down the pragmatic but ambitious program for modernizing
 China before the turn of the century.  Finally, in his
 own words, Yu asserted that rapid industrial development
 through hard work and strict discipline was  "not only
 absolutely necessary but entirely possible."
 Yu's skillful use of the "legacies" of both Mao
 Tse-tung and Chou En-lai appears to be a deliberate attempt
 to create the memory of a competent but faithful Chou led
 by a visionary but rational Mao.  This image of Chou,
 apparently created by a man with close connections in the
 past to Chou and Teng Hsiao-ping, may, however, be the
 creation of Hua Kuo-feng, who would stand to gain the
 most by "keeping Chou in his place."

 Military Debate Continues
 The debate over how much stress to place on modern-
 izing the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has surfaced
 again.   This time,  it appeared most clearly at the re-
 cently concluded Taching conference in the issue of
 whether the danger of war should be featured as an im-
 portant reason for speeding up industrialization.
 Chairman Hua,  in his major address on May 9,  stated
 two reasons for accelerating industrial development:
 time is rapidly running out if China is to achieve Mao's
 and Chou's goal of modernizing China by the year 2000;
 and,  since war is inevitable, China should be made
 "strong and prosperous as soon as possible."   Hua did
 not dwell on the danger of war, however, and he reminded
 his audience that the PLA had overcome its stronger
 enemies with "millet plus rifles" in the 1940s,  suggest-
 ing that the military should be content for the time
 being with the weapons it already has.
 Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying's speech at the
 Tachinng conference, although emphatically stating that
 modern industry must be developed as a basis for mili-
 tary modernization, laid considerably more stress on the
 war preparations theme than Hua's.   Yeh expanded the
 Maoist dictum that industry should support national de-
 fense as well as agriculture.   Furthermore, he noted
 that "we must ceaselessly strengthen national defense
 capabilities."  Elsewhere, Yeh predicted that "a big
 war will break out at an early date (emphasis added).
 Finally, Yeh referred to Mao's 1956 speech on the "Ten
 Major Relationships" only in the context of geographical
 redistribution of industry.   Yeh made no reference to
 another section of Mao's speech that directed reductions
 in military spending in order to spur industrial develop-
 ment.   Earlier this year, Mao's speech formed the con-
 text for sharp differences over the relative priority
 that should be assigned to "economic" construction and
 defense industry.

 Cracking Down in China's Schools
 Since the purge of the gang of four in October 1976,
 the Chinese government has made a number of efforts to
 improve the quality of China's educational system.  One
 of the most important of these has been an attempt to re-
 store discipline in the schools, many of which have been
 torn by factional struggles and undermined by lax educa-
 tional policies since the Cultural Revolution.
 Plans to tighten educational standards and restore
 discipline were formulated as early as 1973 by the archi-
 tects of China's "four modernizations," including Chou
 En-lai and Teng Hsiao-ping.   These, however, were scuttled
 as a result of strong opposition from an alliance of top
 leaders-led by the "gang of four."  The campaign that led
 to the purge of Teng Hsiao-ping in April 1976, in fact,
 began when leftists attacked reform measures proposed by
 Teng and the late minister of education, Chou ,Jung-hsin.
 The purge of the gang of four has led to renewed efforts
 to reform educational policy.
 One of these efforts is the attempt to restore dis-
 cipYine in the schools.   It first became apparent in
 early 1977 in a number of news articles attacking the
 gang of four for undermining the authority of teachers
 and encouraging students to revolt.  An article in Peo-
 pZe's DaiZy on February 23, for instance, denounced the
 gang for wanting to "make revolution without teachers"
 and for encouraging students to believe that their job
 was only to transform other people's attitudes, not their
 own.  A piece in Kuangming Daily on March 28, was even
 harsher, charging that the gang had "upset the regular
 order of schools," abolished school discipline and "ra-
 tional rules and regulations," and "tried by every means
 to create chaos in schools."   This was contrary to Mao
 Tse-tung's principles.   "Revolutionary school discipline
 and rational rules and regulations," the article said,
 "are a guarantee for carrying out Chairman Mao's prole-
 tarian revolutionary line in education and fulfilling the

 and discipline, according to the article, are as essential
 to schools as to the state.
