LE DUAN AND THE POST - HO CHI MINH LEADERSHIP 
I. Principal Judgments 
Le Duan, First Secretary of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, appears to 
be fairly secure in his position as "first among equals" in the collective 
leadership that runs North Vietnam. He faces some generally muted opposi-
tion, chiefly from the party's doctrinaire wing, but thus far has commanded 
enough support from colleagues to make his views prevail. The central issue 
for the leadership in Hanoi since 1954 has been and remains the question of 
how to "liberate" South Vietnam, and how much of the North's resources 
should be put into the effort. The Hanoi leaders have worked hard to achieve 
a take-over and have been reluctant, even since the cease-fire, to defer 
progress toward that aim. At the same time Le Duan, Premier Pham Van 
Dong, and some others are eager to push ahead with the job of rebuilding the 
North. Thus the leaders will be faced with a policy dilemma as long as the 
Communists remain so far short of their goals in the South. 
Next to Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan apparently has had more influence than 
any other North Vietnamese leader in determining Hanoi's strategy toward 
the South since 1945. His strategic views have been relatively flexible. He has 
never been identified with a strategy of protracted guerrilla war (the strategy 
the Viet Minh followed against the French in the North), at least as a 
long-term policy. After the US entered the war in 1965, Le Duan generally 
advocated and supported large-unit, sustained offensive warfare in the belief 
that it could force a collapse of US and South Vietnamese resolve to keep 
fighting. Earlier, there had been periods (e.g., 1955-1957 and 1961-1962) 
when Le Duan seemed to share with Ho Chi Minh the belief that the North 
had nothing to gain by stepping up the war; at those times Le Duan 
supported a policy of refraining from major violence, while letting the 
political pot simmer. 
The evidence since the cease-fire suggests that the Politburo under Le 
Duan's leadership is taking the second, "political" tack, at least for the time 
being. Hanoi is also maintaining major North Vietnamese forces in the South

capable not only of defending Communist-held territory (their immediate 
mission), but also of mounting a strong offensive should the Politburo decide 
that it could force the South Vietnamese into a weakened negotiating 
position. The currently somewhat ambivalent policy is apparently the best 
mix the Politburo can agree on to preserve some military options in the 
South while improving opportunities for pushing postwar construction in the 
North. 
A Record of Unity, Despite Internal Differences 
The record of stability in the Vietnamese Communist leadership is 
unmatched by that of any other ruling Communist party. There has never 
been an open power struggle or an extensive purge in the top leadership. The 
men at the top have been waging war most of the time since 1941, and have 
tended to submerge differences for this reason. A more important unifying 
force has been the skillful leadership provided first by Ho Chi Minh and then 
by Le Duan. The hallmark of their leadership style has been a willingness to 
tolerate differences in the Politburo, combined with an ability to keep 
dissenters in line. 
Differences have existed among Politburo members over both domestic 
and war policy. There have usually been some leaders who have regarded 
specific decisions as too aggressive and others who believed they were not 
aggressive enough. Such differences apparently persist despite efforts by Le 
Duan to broaden the base of agreement. In 1972 and 1973, for example, Le 
Duan reportedly had only a majority of Politburo members with him in his 
decisions to launch the Easter 1972 offensive and then, again, to make 
concessions to reach agreement at Paris in 'January 1973. 
Le Duan's chief rival over the years has been Truong Chinh, who was 
party secretary-general from 1941 until 1956. when he was demoted for 
errors in domestic policy. Under Truong Chinh the party had operated in 
consonance with Chinese precepts in both domestic affairs and war strategy. 
In 1957, Le Duan was brought to Hanoi to replace Chinh. The Southern-
oriented policy he began to develop owed little in the way it was applied to 
either the Soviet Union or China. 
Since then, Le Mum has gathered around him a group of men who had 
worked under him in South Vietnam while other leaders were fighting the 
French in the North. Among them are Le Due Tho, Hanoi's highly com-
petent negotiator and chief of the party's powerful Organization Depart-
ment, and Pham Hung, who heads COSVN. There are indications that Chief 
of Staff Van Tien Dung has been particularly close to Le Duan and shares 
some of his views. If Le Duan were able to form a new Politburo in the near

future, e.g., at the long-rumored 4th Party Congress, these men might well be 
key figures. 
Le Duan's Strengths and Weaknesses 
Le Duan has several things going for him: 
? More than any other leader, he had Ho Chi Minh's trust and 
backing. It was Ho who in 1960 conferred on Le Duan the title "First 
Secretary"?the title then held by the head of the CPSU and that of 
nearly every other ruling Communist party except China. 
? Le Duan's long tenure at or near the top (since 1937) gives him 
prestige and authority. He made good use of the years he served as party 
boss under Ho to put his men in key spots. 
? Although lacking Ho's charisma, Duan has solid qualities of intel-
lect and leadership that seem to command respect and loyalty in the 
VWP apparatus. 
? He has never been tainted by association with an officially dis-
credited policy nor did he ever publicly incur Ho's displeasure, as did 
Truong Chinh, Premier Dong, and General Giap at one time or another. 
? Le Duan is an astute political maneuverer who has acquired enough 
proteges and allies in the power structure to give him majority support. 
He has edged his old opponent Truong Chinh into an isolated position 
that provides little opportunity to challenge him effectively. 
Nevertheless, Le Duan's failure to restructure the Politburo suggests 
that the potential for opposition to his policies, if not to himself, remains 
strong. The present Central Committee and Politburo were both created by 
Ho Chi Minh at the last party congress in 1960, and changes seem overdue. 
The failure to hold the long-delayed 4th Party Congress now that the 
cease-fire has reduced hostilities in the South is reminiscent of delays often 
seen in Chinese affairs which have usually masked an unresolved power 
struggle. As long as solid progress is not apparent in the reconstruction of the 
North and the revolution in the South, the opposition could coalesce against 
Le Duan. This will become increasingly likely if the regime is unable in 
another year or so to show reasonable progress toward its goals in the South 
or should it decide to put the main emphasis on development in the North 
and fail to make some solid economic progress there.

II. Unity, Differences, and Groupings 
The leadership in North Vietnam is remarkable for its cohesiveness and 
for the determination with which it has pursued its nationalist and Marxist 
goals. The senior members of the Politburo of the Vietnam Workers' Party 
(VWP) all began their revolutionary careers in the 1920s, rose to prominence 
in the Stalinist Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) in the 1930s, and have 
worked as a leadership team for about three decades. The fact that they have 
been fighting wars most of the time since 1941 has been a unifying force. 
More important has been the skillful leadership provided first by President 
Ho Chi Minh until his death in 1969, and then by Party First Secretary Le 
Duan. The hallmark of their style of leadership?unusual among ruling 
Communist countries?has been a willingness to tolerate dissent among 
colleagues, combined with the ability to reconcile differences. 
The smoothness of Politburo teamwork has been marred occasionally 
by personal antagonisms and sharp behind-the-scenes disputes. These have 
sometimes led to shifts in relative positions within the power structure. But 
there has never been an open power struggle among the men at the top, a 
purge reaching into their group, or a major defection (like Trotsky and 
Chang Kuo-t'ao). This Vietnamese record of stability and continuity is 
unmatched by any other Communist state. 
The party leaders are clearly tough-minded people; they have had their 
differences, but they have also demonstrated that they are able to submerge 
or resolve their disagreements and to work together once a decision is 
reached. Differences stem from several causes. There is diversity in tempera-
ment, background, and experience. Some individuals have at times been 
more receptive than others to Soviet or Chinese influence. Some, often the 
same individuals, have been associated with mistakes in domestic policy or 
have opposed key war decisions. 
In the past, diversity was encouraged by Ho Chi Minh's unusual style of 
leadership. He seems to have tolerated a spectrum of views in the Politburo, 
while generally taking a central position himself. Thus during the Vietnam 
war some leaders usually regarded particular decisions as too aggressive, 
while others believed they were not aggressive enough. 
Le Duan apparently is continuing Ho's practice of keeping around him 
men who do not always see eye-to-eye. It is doubtful, though, that Le Duan 
is pleased at having potential rivals on the Politburo. Perhaps, lacking Ho's 
great personal authority, he acquiesces in their presence on the Politburo for 
reasons of prudence or because he really has no choice. Whatever the reason,

Approved For ReleasiladI1DWNE 314211.1AFf7,91301737A002100040001-4 
differences persist under Le Duan and are not always welcome. In late May 
1972, for example, the party journal Jim Tap complained of "rightist and 
leftist tendencies? in the party. This was possibly a reference to reservations 
of sonic of the leaders about the wisdom of the 1972 offensive, especially in 
view of the strong US retaliation that resulted. The decision to launch the 
Easter 1972 offensive reportedly did not have the unanimous support of the 
Politburo, only the "majority.?
It has never been easy to identify with certainty the individual members 
of groupings within the Politburo, but it was not quite so difficult when lb 
Chi Minh was :WI, e. Ile allowed considerable information about factional 
views to circulate within the party, chiefly through political lectures and 
dissemination of political indoctrination material. Much of this type of 
information ultimately leaked out through captured documents. prisoner 
interrogations, and agent and other intelligence reports. Such reports have 
been rare since Ilo's death. Their near-disappearance suggests either that Le 
Duan has clamped down on circulation of dissenting views within the party 
or that, with the passage of time, groupings have become less distinct and 
contentious. 
The views of leaders on war policy have shifted over the decades. In the 
early years of the s.var, when the leadership as a whole was deciding to 
escalate the war, General Giap and, to a lesser degree, Premier Pham Van 
Dong apparently tended to urge caution and were more ready than others to 
make concessions to negotiate an end to the war. Their counsel resembled 
the advice Hanoi got from Moscow throughout the war, and they were 
labeled by their more militant adversaries in inner party circles as "pro-So-
viet? and "revisionist.? In 1967. when Ilanols war strategy changed to the 
launching of big offensives (either to win a quick victory or to gain a strong 
position to negotiate), both Giap and Dong apparently became strong team 
players again. Giap almost certainly played a major part in the military 
planning of the Tet 1968 and Easter 11.172 offensives. 
At the other extreme, early in the war, was a group of men who 
opposed any concessions and advocated instead a classic "people's war" that 
would continue until a complete military victory was achieved. This was 
what the Chinese Communists were advising too until 1971, and it seemed to 
be a view widely held (and probably still held) in the army and in the 
southern apparatus. The most vociferous advocate of this position in the 
Politburo was COSVN chief General Nguyen Chi Thanh, who died, reputedly 
in an air raid, in July 1967. I lis chief backer ( besides lb o Chi Minh) was the 
then number-three man. Truong Chinh, who had been party secretary-gen-
eral from 1941 to 1956. In that era flo Chi Minh and the Vietnamese 
Communists accepted Chinese political and ideological guidance more or less

uncritically and with great enthusiasm. Their illusions came to an end, 
however, in 1956 when a land reform program conducted along lines 
specifically recommended by Mao Tse-tung had disastrous results. The fail-
ure of the program also led to the downgrading of Tatung Chinh, although 
Chinh later made a partial comeback. 
The year 1957 was a watershed for Hanoi. A sobered Ho Chi Minh, by 
now determined to pursue an independent Vietnamese course in domestic 
affairs and also impatient to take over South Vietnam, brought Lc Duan, the 
Communist Party boss in the South, to I fanoi to replace Truong Chinh. Le 
Duan was given the job of reorienting the party toward a southern-directed 
policy, which was independent of both the Soviet Union and China. Over the 
next few years a third grouping coalesced under Le Duan, and this is the 
dominant group today. Besides Lc Dual'. it includes party organization boss 
Le Due Tho and COSVN chief Pham Hung. The background of these three 
differs significantly from other senior members of the Politburo. They were 
in jail in Indochina during World War II and thus did not participate in the 
building of the Viet Minh organization. After 1945. they all stayed in the 
South to work in the underground. Le Duan and Lc Due Tho remained there 
until 1957. Pham flung returned to the North in 1955, but was not placed 
on the Politburo until 1957. Thus none was serving in the center of power 
during the many years the Vietnamese were particularly close to the Chinese 
Communists. 
The record indicates that one additional member of the Politburo 
Chief of Staff Van Tien Dung has been close to Le Duan he worked under 
Le Duan in the South in 1955-56) and shares some of his views. Like Thu 
and Hung, Van Tien Dung was not at the center of power until after 1956. 
Dung was only a lowly divisional commander during the war against the 
French and was not even at Dien Bien Phu. Despite his inexperience and 
youth (he was 37), he was promoted to chief of staff in mid-1954, displacing 
a favorite of Giap's (Mang Van Thai, who became Deputy Chief of Staff), 
and was immediately transferred South. Several prisoners have stated that 
Ifo Chi Minh in his last years held Dung in higher esteem than Giap because 
of Dung's consistently aggressive stand. 
Other members of the Politburo are specialists who exercise varying 
degrees of influence. In order of precedence. they are Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Duy Trinh, a political light-weight: economic specialist Le Thanh 
Nghi, a loyal Le Duan man: the aging specialist on China and an associate of 
Truong (Minh, lloang Van Hoan: and Security Minister Tran Quoc lloan, the 
only one of the four who appears to have a strong power base of his own. 
Tran Quoc floan is a shadowy figure not aligned with any faction. He has 
held his sensitive post since 1953, well before Le Duan's rise, and there are 
tenuous signs that the relationship between the two is an uneasy one.

III. Le Duan's Policy Record 
For many years the DRV has been generally consistent in its broad 
policy directions. Apparently Le Duan saw eye to eye with Ho Chi Minh on 
most issues, and thus felt no reason to institute fundamental changes after 
Ho's death. Le Duan, unlike Khrushchev under Stalin, was more than just an 
executive officer carrying out Ho's orders; he was a junior partner, helping 
form policy. The main elements of Le Duan's policies are: 
? In foreign affairs, he has continued the policy started by Ho of 
pursuing a line independent of Moscow and Peking, while, so far as 
possible, maintaining good relations with both. The Sino-Soviet doctrinal 
split on war issues that existed from 1957 to 1971 enabled the Viet-
namese to play one ally against the other and ensure continuing support 
from both. Hanoi has not been able to do this as effectively in the 
current era of Soviet and Chinese detente with the US, but it still 
maintains its independence of the two big Communist powers. 
? His policy toward the South has been innovative and flexible. 
Military strategy has sometimes been daring and sometimes cautious, and 
the mix of political and military measures employed in each phase of the 
war has varied. Le Duan, with Ho Chi Minh's approval while he lived, 
apparently has had a dominant role in determining most strategy shifts, 
Virtually all the recurrent changes?from the 1954 Geneva agreement to 
the 1973 cease-fire agreement?met with opposition from groups be-
lieving that the decision was either too militant or not militantenough. 
Le Duan, and Ho Chi Minh before him, dealt skillfully with dissenters to 
induce them to submerge their differences. They also showed consider-
able talent for dealing with conflicting demands of their big allies. 
? In the domestic field, Le Duan's prime objective is to build a 
modern, industrialized state as rapidly as possible, and to do so in an 
efficient way unencumbered by excess ideological baggage. He has op-
posed efforts to restrict "capitalist tendencies" if this hurts the econ-
omy, and he believes that "revolutionary enthusiasm" and experience in 
guerrilla warfare are a poor substitute for managerial and technical 
expertise. He is sometimes pragmatic to the point of being non-Marxist. 
More doctrinaire leaders, whose most vocal spokesman is Truong Chinh, 
have understandably taken exception to some of Duan's positions. Since 
1960 policies generally have borne Lc Duan's stamp, but the occasional 
appearance of mixed strands suggests a flexible amalgam of the two 
approaches. The doctrinaire wing of the VWP is strong enough to make 
its influence felt, particularly because the cease-fire has not ended

lighting in the South. So long as that conflict continues, Le Duan 
probably will hesitate to make the policy shift he almost certainly would 
like to initiate - that is, to give the North top priority for attention and 
resources. 
On Strategy Toward the South, 1945-1972 
The Vietnamese Communists have paid due obeisance to Mao Tse-
tung's precepts of guerrilla warfare. The precepts, which have been set out in 
textbooks by Truong Chilli' and Vo Nguyen Giap, in fact governed Viet 
Minh strategy against the French from 1946 to 1954. Le Duan, however, 
seems never to have been an unqualified admirer of either the Chinese 
Communists or their revolutionar doctrine. lie has developed a complicated 
and flexible doctrine of his own that gives a place to classical rules of 
"people's war,- but stresses the political and psychological effects of a given 
course of action. Thus, while the Communists have consistently emphasized 
political measures including subversion and terrorism- in their struggle in 
the South, they have been far more willing to initiate heavy military action 
for its political impact than classical doctrine dictates. The aspect of 
"people's war- that has received short shrift is guerrilla warfare -a fact duly 
noted by proponents of classical strategy such as Truong Chinh, who 
reportedly criticized the offensive of Tet 1968 as a costly, "adventurous" 
act. 
Some of Le Duan's views on strategy undoubtedly have their roots in 
the essentially political nature of his party experience from the 1930s 
through the 1950s. During those decades, Le Duan was engaged primarily in 
legal and clandestine political organization work, not in organizing forces for 
armed rebellion. 
Between 1936 and 1939, for example, when the Communist parties of 
France and its colonies were permitted to operate legally and their leaders 
were given amnesty, the Indochina Communist Party was a tightly knit 
group of intellectuals-urban-based, bicultural, and responsive to the French 
Communist Party and the Stalin-controlled Comintern. In contrast, by 1935 
Mao Tse-tung's Communist Party had left the coastal cities to organize 
peasants for armed revolt, in defiance of the Comintern. Le Duan held high 
positions in the ICP between 1936 and 1939; this was in fact the only period 
between 1931 and 1945 when he was not in a penal colony. 
After 1945, during the war against the French, Le Dual) served as 
secretary of the party's southern region, away from the main fighting in the 
North. Le Duan's area of responsibility simmered along at "stage one- of 
people's warfare -the stage of political preparation.

After the French left in 1954, strong pressure built up in the southern 
branch of the VWP to expand guerrilla forces and to work to overthrow the 
Diem regime by violence. For several reasons, however, the VWP leadership 
in Hanoi ordered the Viet Cong to bide their time and restrict themselves to 
political activities: Hanoi was under pressure from both China and the USSR 
not to renew armed conflict; building the North had been given priority for 
resources; and it was felt that as a result of Diem's repressive policies and 
resultant unpopularity, time was on their side. 
It was Le Duan's job to keep the lid on the restive southern apparatus, 
and this he did. Subsequently he justified his action in a widely circulated 
pamphlet issued late in 1956, South Vietnam's Revolutionary Line. In the 
pamphlet Le Duan said that the VWP fully supported the thesis of the 20th 
CPSU Congress (February 1956) on pursuing revolution through a "peaceful 
line." Le Duan specifically ruled out armed violence in South Vietnam, 
stating that "only" political action was permissible. 
On Strategy Before the US Entered the War, 1958-1965 
By 1958, however, the VWP Politburo, with Ho and Le Duan setting 
the line, began moving in the direction of a policy of more violent resistance 
to the Diem regime. Two developments brought about this change: the Diem 
regime, with US aid, was growing stronger, not weaker; and Hanoi was being 
pushed hard by one of its major allies, Peking, to pursue a militant anti-US 
policy. 
Hanoi's shift was made slowly because of persistent opposition from 
Moscow and concern over provoking US intervention, and also because of 
what captured documents have referred to as "hesitancy" within the ranks 
of the Politburo itself.* 
Le Duan signaled the beginning of the shift early in 1958, when he 
made a series of speeches criticizing Soviet ideas on "peaceful" means of 
*According to available evidence on the 1958-60 strategy arguments, Gen-
eral Giap and Premier Dong urged caution and delay in stepping up the 
conflict; at the other extreme, Truong Chinh and General Nguyen Chi 
Thanh, backed by Peking, argued that as long as it was being decided to fight 
a "people's war" they should go all-out and fight it in the way they had 
fought the French and the Chinese had fought their revolutionary wars. Ho 
and Le Duan opted for a third course, which in most respects was a 
compromise between two extremes.

acquiring political power. Reversing his 1956 position, Le Duan asserted that 
the Soviet theses did not apply to South Vietnam. 
Captured documents and other evidence indicate that the Politburo 
spent the next two years working out the strategy for the southern struggle 
and the amount of support the North should contribute. What was finally 
agreed upon was a cautious mix of political action and "armed struggle- at 
the level of guerrilla warfare, backed by limited logistic and manpower 
support from the North. Le Duan spent most of these two years in the South 
preparing the apparatus for an intensified conflict. He evidently played a 
direct role in forming the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in 
December 1960; its manifesto incorporated verbatim whole passages from 
his September 1960 report to the Third Party Congress in Ilanoi. 
By the end of 1960, Ho Chi Minh and Le Duan apparently were 
satisfied that the insurgency in the South was on the right track and that 
they could safely turn their attention to economic development of the 
North. Over the next two years the Politburo held several plenums on North 
Vietnam's economy. and Le Duan spoke frequently on problems of industri-
alization, which seemed now to be his chief area of concern and interest. 
Relations with the USSR warmed, Truong Chinh stayed out of the limelight, 
and in March 1961. the hawkish General Nguyen Chi Thanh was quietly 
transferred to a position in rural affairs. 
The lull in attention to the South ended in the spring of 1963, when 
the Politburo perceived that the Diem regime was on the verge of crumbling 
and decided that the time had come to make contingency plans for a 
military take-over. According to a captured document, Ilanoi then reached 
the conclusion that it would have to send NVA forces South to ensure a 
decisive victory. 
Le Duan once again signaled the change in a speech delivered in March 
1963. The speech so closely followed the Chinese line on use of violence in 
revolutionary situations that it was broadcast by Radio Peking. As before, 
however, there was delay in acting. General Giap, backed this time by 
Khrushchev, argued that overt North Vietnamese intervention would invite 
US retaliation. (Khnishchey did, in fact, cut hack Soviet military support in 
the spring of 1964.) General Nguyen Chi Thanh, back in Ho's good graces 
and now commander of all Communist forces in the South, believed with the 
Chinese that the North should quickly send enough of its own troops south 
so that ARVN could be defeated before the US had a chance to intervene 
effectively. 
The final decision to send NVA forces South, made at the 9th Plenum 
in December 1963, mixed boldness with caution. Large-scale support?about

six NVA infantry divisions?was planned, but the Politburo (including Le 
Duan, according to a captured document) did not believe that the US would 
introduce ground forces, and thus had no sense of urgency. NVA combat 
units were formed, trained, and dispatched South so deliberately and cau-
tiously that they were not in position to fight until mid-1965. By then the 
US had entered the ground war, and the Communists had lost their chance 
for a quick victory. 
On Strategy Against Combined US and GVN Forces, After 1965 
Captured documents and public statements strongly suggest that Le 
Duan was the chief architect of North Vietnam's strategy in the next stage of 
the war. It was apparent to Le Duan that the war no longer could be won by 
military means alone. His idea, as reported in captured documents and 
prisoner testimony, was to fight hard for two or three years to soften up the 
US (particularly US public opinion) and then to negotiate a favorable 
settlement of the war from a position of military/psychological strength. 
Basically, it was the same strategy that had been used successfully against the 
French. Le Duan called it a strategy of "fighting and negotiating." 
The strategy was immediately opposed by Peking and Moscow, for 
different reasons and Le Duan took issue with both allies. 
25X1C he viewed the Chinese as extremists who wantedanoi to 
tie down US forces by dragging out the war indefinitely, and who dismissed 
any possibility of negotiations in the future. In a speech published in August 
1966, Le Duan attacked basic Maoist principles of warfare, which had been 
spelled out?apparently largely for Vietnamese benefit?in an article by Lin 
Piao. Le Duan took two of Mao's points?fight defensively when the enemy 
is stronger, and do not risk losses by pitting weak units against strong?and 
turned them around. He asserted that the Vietnamese Communists were on 
the offensive and had been throughout the war, and had "invented" methods 
that enabled them, even with a weak force (a ratio of "one to 10, or more") 
to overpower a stronger enemy force. Le Duan was justifying two basic 
elements of his strategy: to maintain the option of negotiating, which can be 
done only from an offensive position; and to be prepared to strike military 
blows, even when one's forces are weaker, for psychological effect. The Tet 
1968 offensive launched 19 months later was based on these premises. 
Soviet advice to negotiate an end to the war immediately was rejected 
by Le Duan in 1966. He argued privately and publicly that the US was not 
yet as war-weary as the French were at the time of Dien Bien Phu. In a 
speech given at the 23rd CPSU Congress in Moscow in April 1966, he 
carefully pointed out that the time was not ripe for negotiations.

According to a credible report the 
Politburo met in the fall of 1966 and, over tbe objections of I ruong tinh 
and General Nguyen Chi Thanh. adopted a contingency plan for stepped-up 
military action that would lead to negotiations. The cadre said that Hanoi 
sought and readily obtained Moscow's support for the plan, but that Le 
Duan was unable to get Chinese approval. The Politburo went ahead with 
contingency planning despite the reported opposition of the Chinese. Gen-
eral Thanh's death, on July 7. 1967, may have removed one obstacle to the 
plan, for specific planning at COSVN headquarters for the Tet Offensive 
began soon after he died. The 1968 Tet offensive consisted of surprise 
attacks on nearly every city and military base in South Vietnam. Since in 
most battles the attacking forces were weaker than defending forces, no 
lasting military gains were possible. The boldness of the stroke, however, did 
lead to a dramatic rise in anti-war sentiment in the US, but not enough to 
force the US to withdraw on Ilanoi's terms. So a second country-wide 
offensive was launched on NI aV 5, 1968. Its failure and the failure of two 
subsequent country-wide of compelled the Politburo to abandon the 
Le Duan strategy in April 1969 and to retreat to the concept of "protracted 
war- that Truong Chinh and the Chinese had been advocating all along. 
The failures almost certainly eroded Lc Duan 's leadership authority for 
25X1C a while. According to prisoner reports, many senior COSVN 
commanders were openly complaining as earl as as the summer of 1968 that 
the cost of the offensives was not worth the gains. (Le Duan reportedly 
visited COSVN headquarters in June 1968 to argue in person for continua-
tion of his strategy.) The publication that September of a major speech by 
Truong Chinh criticifing the big-offensive strategy implied that the Politburo 
(and Ito Chi NIinh) were dissatisfied with Le Duan's direction of the war. 
But after Ilo Chi NIinh's death in September 1969, Le Duan managed to 
reassert his authority. A major policy statement published in February 1970, 
and his subsequent war policies, demonstrated that his faith in the basic 
validity of his approach had not been shaken by the need to retreat in 1969. 
In his 1970 article he again rejected Maoist military tactics and reiter-
ated his concepts of strategy and war goals. For example: 
? Le Duan: Our general tlf,?ory of warfare is to maintain steady 
offensive pressure. with occasional leaps forward. even though the enemy 
is superior in troop strength and equipment. Mao: Fight the war in slow 
stages, and do not risk going on the stra.tegic offensive until the military 
balance of forces has tipped in your favor. 
? Le Doan: It is our strate* to attack the enemy on all fronts. Mao: 
Never disperse your forces. Concentrate superior forces for every battle 
and destroy enemy units one by one.

? Le Duan: We attack the enemy anytime and anywhere, when he is 
weak and uncovered and even when he is strong and on guard. Mao: 
Strike the enemy only when he is weak and off guard. 
? Le Duan: In a passage underlined ?for emphasis, Le Duan claimed 
that the Vietnamese have learned the military art of using a small force 
to fight a great force. Mao: In every battle, concentrate an absolutely 
superior force (2,3,4, and sometimes even 5 or 6 times the enemy's 
strength.) 
On negotiations, Le Duan was flexible. "To take advantage of the 
enemy's internal contradictions...our Party, on the basis of holding fast to 
principles, has flexibly and wisely employed various strategies." He cited 
approvingly past occasions when the party had made "principled com-
promises" in dealing with the French. 
Le Duan's 1970 article laid the doctrinal basis for the 1972 Easter 
offensive and its aftermath, the January 1973 cease-fire. As of early 1974, it 
was Communist strategy to refrain from major military action, except to 
defend territory already under Communist control, and, instead, to turn to 
"political struggle." But GVN-controlled territory is fairly stable politically 
and also well-policed. With little opportunity for effective subversion a 
"political struggle" policy, in effect, means acquiescence of the status quo. 
Le Duan vs. Truong Chinh on Building the North 
Le Duan's views on domestic policy are shaped by his vision of creating 
a modern industrialized country in a brief period of time. In March 1973 he 
wrote that "the greatest scientific and technological revolution in mankind's 
history is now in full swing over the world," and expressed his determination 
to take full advantage of the opportunity to share in these benefits. He said, 
"We will not spare any effort or money in this field, which plays the most 
decisive role.. .in the present era." 
Le Duan's pragmatic and energetic proposals for building a strong state 
are not always enthusiastically received by others in the leadership. Some 
fear that economic development may be achieved only at the expense of 
traditional Marxist goals and lead to a resurgence of "capitalist and bourgeois 
tendencies." 
Debates on domestic policies, like those on war policies, have been 
sharp and polemical. The key issues in dispute show up most clearly when

The Three Revolutions 
The "three revolutions"--"the revolution in production relations, the 
revolution in technology, and the revolution in ideology and culture"?is a 
slogan that has been popular in Vietnam since at least 1961. The slogan 
expresses, somewhat cumbersomely, the same idea embodied in the Chinese 
slogan "Red and expert." 
It has been standard practice for Le 
Duan, especially since 1970, to 
word the slogan in a way that sin-
gled out technical expertise as the 
most important aspect. For exam-
ple, he says that the only way to 
build socialism is by "successfully 
carrying out the three revolutions, 
of which the technical revolution is 
the key." (Le Duan's underlining) 
(1970). 
The general line of building social-
ism in the North consists of 
"strengthening dictatorship toward 
the people's enemy, repressing coun-
ter-revolutionaries, maintaining se-
curity and order. ..and carrying out 
the following three revolutions: the 
revolution in production relations, 
technical revolution, and ideological 
and cultural revolution." In the 
ensuing discussion of the "three rev-
olutions" Truong Chinh typically 
gives more extended treatment and 
emphasis to the third revolution, 
that of ideology and culture. (1968) 
The Struggle Between the Capitalist and the Socialist Road 
The struggle between the two roads 
is primarily a problem of economic 
production. "Only" by expanding 
production through the three rev-
olutions?of which the technical rev-
olution is the main one?can the 
conditions that foster capitalism be 
eliminated. "Carrying out the three 
rev olutions...represents the basic 
content of the class struggle." 
(1970) 
"The struggle between the socialist 
road and the capitalist road is still 
going on to determine definitely 
who will defeat whom.... This is a 
protracted, hard, and complicated 
struggle. Such movements as the 
movement to suppress counter-rev-
olutionaries...are the content of this 
struggle." (1968)

Lenin on "Building Socialism-
Praises Lenin for having boldly 
changed from a policy of war com-

icy in 1921. Lenin, he said, "had to 
exert immense effort to persuade 
communists who were imbued with 
revolutionary enthusiasm but un-
aware of economic laws? that "the 
New Economic Policy was not a pol-
icy of restoring capital km but the 
only possible single policy for the 
USSR at that time.? (1970) (similar 
reference to Lenin's NEP was made 
in 1968)

main task of a revolutionary regime

Twice Le Duan states that it is party 
policy not to do anything that "re-
stricts? the sideline economic activ-
ities of peasants. Cadres should even 
help promote family farming by see-
ing that peasants get seed and tools, 
and should not find this a "frighten-
ing? trend. (1968 
Although it is very important to 
eliminate capitalist elements, this is 
not the crucial thing: it is imperative 
that labor and materials are 
"managed so as to expand produc-
tion most rapidly.? (1970)

duction that increases the social pro-
duct is acceptable is not the view of 
the working class and the Party....

Old cadres, trained in revolutionary

"This is not right." (1970) 
"Easing vigilance against.. .counter-

quelling (these forces) while losing 
sight of the essential task of...carry-
ing out the three revolutions, we 
would commit a serious error." 
(1970) 
It is "necessary to use violence 
against counter-revolutionaries and 
exploiters who refuse to submit to 
reform." We must strengthen "the 
repressive apparatus." (1968) 
On Revolutionary Enthusiasm 
"Without revolutionary enthusiasm, 
there can be no revolutionary acts. 
But with only revolutionary enthusi-
asm, the most we can do is eliminate 
the old; we cannot build a new soci-
ety." (1970) 
"Revolutionary enthusiasm is very 
important. But if we think that we 
can build socialism with.. .our enthu-
siasm alone and if we disregard all 
objective laws and economic facts 
which are sometimes cruel and hard, 
we are grossly mistaken." (1970)

On Ideology 
But something winch deserves our 
attention is that no small number of

ideological indoctrination and view 
that as the only and the best meas-

clear that this method of operation 
cannot meet the requirements of 
production.? (1968) 
"If we simply acquiesce to gener-
alized ideological appeals.. we will 
be unable to complete the great task 
of building socialism.? ( 968) 
Cadres are already imbued with 
enough zeal and enthusiasm. The 
main danger now hes in the fact that 
"many? party officials, at all levels. 
"have substituted general ideological 
and political tasks...for the organiza-
tional task.? (1970) 
Formerly, the party relied heavil 
on propaganda to get things done. 
hut now we should use modern 
methods of management. "I lowever. 
most of our cadres do not yet know 
or are still unfamiliar with this 
fact." (1970) 
It has "become a way of life? with 
some people to talk incessantly 
about ideology in a loose way that 
ignores practical organizational 
problems. "This is an inherent sick-

Criteria for Selecting Party Cadres 
Previously, cadres had to know how 
to lead revolutionary struggles, how 
to operate clandestinely, how to 
lead guerrilla warfare. Today, in the 
era of construction, problems are 
different. Now, in order to lead eco-
nomic development, party officials 
"must know how to manage the 
economy and must study science 
and technology." Today, criteria for 
judging performance are different: 
"We cannot recognize any party 
organization.. .as good, as long as its 
production is slow." (1968) 
The old guard must be replaced by 
men who have the energy, health, 
know-how and managerial skills re-
quired in this "new era." Thus: 
Experience acquired in decades of 
revolutionary party work is "valu-
able,...however, this definitely can-
not compensate for what we need 
most badly?the ability to organize 
economic development." (1970) 
The key party mission today is the 
"technical revolution," and this will 
be the "only" criterion by which 
party members are judged. (1973) 
"We have often heard abstract and 
fuzzy talk about 'class stand and 
class ethics." There is no need to be 
unclear, because the issue is simple. 
In the past, one's class stand was 
manifested by revolutionary activ-
ities. Today, in the North, class 
stand is manifested mainly by ef-
forts to create modern industry and 
agriculture. (1973) 
"The task of party-building must be 
closely tied to mass revolutionary 
movements. New cadres must be 
selected on the basis of their rev-
olutionary background.... On the 
one hand, look for the most zealous, 
most select elements of the working 
class and make them party mem-
bers. On the other hand, draw into 
the party outstanding elements of 
the laboring masses who have 
emerged in the long and arduous 
struggle against imperialist aggres-
s o rs .... Simultaneously with the 
admission of new party members, 
quickly expel from the party the 
provocateurs, the antiparty ele-
ments, the factionalists, and those 
who are politically backward, as 
well as those poorly qualified, party-
wise." [Says nothing about techni-
cal or managerial expertise and ex-
perience] (1968)

IV. Le Duan's Position Since Ho Chi Minh's Death 
Le Duan appears to have strengthened his political position con-
siderably since Ho Chi Minh died in 1969. He was even then "first among 
equals"; now the gap has widened between him and his potential rivals on 
the Politburo. Le Duan's decisions do not always command unanimous 
support, but he seems strong enough to make his views prevail. There is a 
similarity in the rise of Le Duan and that of Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. 
Neither is a figure who rules through the force of his personality, but both, 
after somewhat shaky starts, have gradually consolidated control so that 
they now effectively lead their respective Politburos. 
For a few months after Ho's death in September 1969, it was unclear 
who was more powerful, Le Duan or his chief rival Truong Chinh. In fact, 
during that period VWP policy guidelines seemed to be inspired more by 
Truong Chinh's ideas than by Le Duan's. Truong Chinh set out his thoughts 
in a long speech in mid-1968 (the exact date was never clear) that was 
published in full in September. The speech was promptly hailed by Hanoi as 
"a new contribution to the treasury of theoretical works on the Vietnamese 
revolution," attesting to its authoritative character. It was a programmatic 
speech calling for greater commitment to ideological goals in the North, and 
in the South for a shift from the big offensives espoused by Le Duan to a 
more orthodox "protracted war." The speech is generally considered to have 
been the basis for the VWP decision in the spring of 1969 to reduce the level 
of fighting so as to test the new US administration and at the same time to 
get a breathing spell. This long-overdue retreat was almost certainly adopted 
with Le Duan's approval?in February 1970 he publicly endorsed the prin-
ciple of sometimes shifting to the defensive to gain time. Nevertheless, it was 
Truong Chinh's name, not his, that was associated with originating the policy 
of retrenchment. 
Uncertainty over Le Duan's status increased late in 1969 when, after 
delivering the funeral oration for 110 Chi Minh, he went into seclusion for 
five months, making only one routine public appearance in October. Truong 
Chinh, in contrast, remained publicly active, and made a few speeches on 
ideological issues. Understandably, Western observers began speculating that 
Truong Chinh was winning a power struggle. 
That theory became untenable in February 1970 when Le Duan 
showed up to give an important speech on the occasion of the party's 40th

anniversary and Nhan Dan published a long statement* by him spelling out 
the party line on strategy and domestic policies. That article firmly estab-
lished Le Duan's primacy. It was immediately given nearly the same authori-
tative standing as Ho Chi Minh's writings. A Nhan Dan editorial described 
the article as an important basic document that correctly set forth "the 
party's lines and policies," and all party cadres were instructed to study it. 
Its emphasis was on a flexible strategy toward the South and a pragmatic 
approach to economic development at home. In setting forth these broad 
new party guidelines, the article clearly was intended to put Le Duan's own 
stamp (and his gloss as well) on the strategy outlined in Truong Chinh's 1968 
speech. As such, it was a vigorous assertion of Le Duan's leadership. 
In subsequent months several leaders found occasion to affirm their 
loyalty to Le Duan. On May 3, 1970, Truong Chinh himself instructed 500 
senior cadres attending a seminar held to study the February article to 
"unite around the Central Committee which is headed by Le Duan." Shortly 
after that, Foreign Minister and Politburo member Nguyen Duy Trinh 
privately told a visiting foreigner that Le Duan's stature was far above 
Truong Chinh's. The foreign minister was quoted as saying that Le Duan was 
popular and flexible, while Chinh was considered dogmatic and pro-Chinese. 
Premier Pham Van Dong in his annual National Day speech, given on August 
31, 1970, quoted only Le Duan and Ho. Dong confirmed Le Duan's 
authority in the area of economic development?the main theme of the 
speech?by saying that "in his February article.. .Comrade Le Duan already 
made clear the party's line concerning.. industrialization." 
Le Duan Encounters Resistance, February to August 1970 
Although Le Duan clearly had nailed down his claim to the number-one 
spot by February 1970, for several months expressions of support for 
Truong Chinh and some of his 1968 views indicated that Duan was still 
facing opposition powerful enough to introduce sour notes in the propa-
ganda. The public discussion dealt only with domestic issues, but it seems 
likely that long-term strategy toward the South?the most crucial problem 
facing North Vietnam in the spring of 1970?was the chief issue. 
*On February 14, 1970 the normally 'bur-page Nhan Dan published an 
extraordinary 12-page edition devoted to Le Duan's article, entitled "Under 
the Glorious Party Banner, for Independence, Freedom, and Socialism, Let 
Us Advance New Victories."

In mid-1968 a public debate had been conducted on domestic matters 
and only on them) while the Politburo in fact was preoccupied with a 
heated argument over whether to continue the big offensives strategy.* In 
brief, the evidence suggests that in mid-1968 Truong Chinh was calling for a 
return to the classic people's war doctrine, arguing that big offensives had 
proved "adventurous" and too costly. Le Duan defended the big-offensive 
strategy. With Ilo Chi Minh mediating, it was apparently decided to launch 
two additional coordinated country-wide offensives (August-September 
1968 and March 1969). In April 1969, after these offensives also had failed 
to achieve satisfactory gains, the Politburo adopted the Truong Chinh line. 
The classic strategy to which Communist forces then returned was the 
cautious and defensive stance that people's war doctrine prescribes for 
combat with a militarily superior enemy. It was essentially designed to 
conserve manpower Sc) that the Communists could, if necessary, fight for a 
long time. The Politburo was still committed to this course in the spring of 
1970. when Le Duan again asserted his primacy. In his February 1970 
article. Le Duan approved the retrenchment strategy -as a temporary ex-
pedient. Ile urged that ilimoi retain its flexibility and be ready to seize 
promising opportunities of any kind: either to resume the offensive, or to 
make "principled compromises" with the enemy under certain circum-
stances. 
At that point, the Politburo seems to have been wary of giving Le Duan 
the authority to move in one of these directions. On the one hand, it had 
had enough of "adventurous" offensives for the time being, but on the 
other, it probably saw no advantage in making concessions. Without Ho Chi 
Minh around to mediate, it was not surprising that Le Duan apparently had 
trouble selling his strategic views. 
Whatever the issue, he was certainly having trouble convincing his 
colleagues to accept Ins recommendations. Ills own February article ac-
knowledged the existence of "differences in view" in the collective 
leadership, and said that "some comrades must learn to make concessions." 
It is significant that the Ilanoi leadership as a collective body withheld public 
affirmation for Le Duan's program through most of 1970. During that

period, the program was not endorsed in part or in whole by a Central 
Committee communique, Politburo resolution, or Secretariat directive. 
Not only did Le Duan fail to get a clear endorsement from his peers, 
but two Politburo resolutions issued in March and one in August actually ran 
against the grain of his February article. In March, the Politburo issued 
resolutions on improving the quality of party members and on strengthening 
cooperative management of farms. In their emphasis on ideological purity, 
both echoed Truong Chinh's 1968 speech, and both conspicuously failed to 
pick up Le Duan's standard emphasis on practical results and on the 
importance of technical expertise over ideological purity. 
Treatment of this so-called "Red and expert" issue became a measure 
of support for Le Duan's position. With typical pragmatism, Le Duan has 
generally treated technical expertise as more important than ideology, but 
his February 1970 article was exceptionally categorical. It stated flatly that 
of the three revolutions (the revolution in production relations, the revolu-
tion in technology, and the revolution in ideology and culture), "the tech-
nological revolution is the main one." The slogan, which appeared repeatedly 
in his article in this form and was even underlined several times for emphasis, 
thereafter appeared routinely in articles and editorials in the party press. The 
two Politburo resolutions of March 1970, however, withheld endorsement of 
Le Duan's formula, by mentioning merely "the three revolutions" without 
indicating that one aspect had priority over another. 
Le Duan apparently was running into substantial opPosition in August 
1970, when a Politburo resolution came out instructing cadres to study both 
the 1968 Truong Chinh and the 1970 Le Duan statements. Party officials 
almost certainly interpreted this as a sign that pressure was being put on Le 
Duan to make concessions to those who shared Truong Chinh's more 
fundamentalist philosophy. 
Another important clue that Truong Chinh's standing vis-a-vis Le Duan 
remained strong in that period surfaced in the treatment given the two in

official histories published at the time.* As in histories before Ho's death, 
both men continued to he given more or less equal attention in passages 
describing their roles in the party's early history. After August 1970, Truong 
Chinh's name rarely appeared in historical reviews and attention to Ho Chi 
Minh himself diminished. leaving Le Duan the paramount figure in early 
party history. 
In sum, there were enough mixed signals in propaganda as of August 
1970 to conclude that Le Duan's power position was less firm than he 
desired. Nothing in the propaganda indicated that his hold on the number-
one spot in the VWP party structure was in doubt, but it appeared that he 
was having difficulty enlarging his authority and winning over colleagues to 
his policy viewpoints 
Le Duan Acquires More Power and Silences 
the Opposition Alter August 1970 
A review of political events in the last third of 1970 suggests that late in 
the summer Le Duan did manage to strengthen his position. Probably the 
immediate pressing issue he was able to exploit was the mounting GV/US 
military threat to Communist logistic bases in Laos. In any event, from the 
autumn of 1970 through the beginning of 1974. war strategy and policy 
pronouncements carried Le Duan 's stamp and propaganda comments on him 
were more adulatory. Central Committee documents, instead of under-
cutting him, reinforced his authority. What political opposition persisted was 
not clearly defined.

Politburo to make a major decision on how to respond to the threatened

allied invasion of Laos. A few months earlier, allied forces had invaded all 
Communist bases in Cambodia, and Communist forces retreated in con-
fusion. By late summer 1970, Hanoi realized from the logic of the situation 
(and probably from agent reports as well) that the allied command was 
planning to follow up with a massive invasion of Laos. 
The Politburo had a choice to make. It could continue the strategy of 
?.protracted war"?falling back when strongly attacked, encouraging the 
enemy to extend his lines of communication, and then moving to inflict 
heavy losses on him. After the enemy has withdrawn, friendly (Communist) 
forces would then rebuild their bases and resume the slow process of 
building up greater military strength, in preparation for an ultimate con-
frontation after the balance of forces had tipped in their favor. It was 
recognized that this process probably would take many years. 
The strategy actually adopted was much more daring and aggressive. It 
was plainly devised by Le Duan, who once before (1966-1967) had shown 
little patience with "protracted war" doctrine as a long-term policy. In 
high-level debates, Le Duan argued successfully for adoption of the "fighting 
and negotiating" strategy that became firmly identified with his name. The 
crux of the strategy was to strike hard military blows so as to be in a 
position of strength during peace negotiations. 
The final decision to launch another big military/psychological offen-
sive in 1972 was probably reached at the 19th Central Committee Plenum* 
convened about December 1970. The Hanoi leadership apparently decided 
to resist the coming allied invasion with all possible force (elements of 13 
divisions were used) and, if all went well, to follow up with preparations to 
launch a large country-wide offensive of its own. 
The allied operation, Lam Son 719, failed to achieve its objectives and 
was successfully thrown back in March 1971. On March 27,1971, just after 
the operation ended, Le Duan went to Moscow where he stayed 43 days, 
arguing successfully for Soviet support of Hanoi's own plans for its offensive. 
As with previous offensives launched against a militarily superior force, the

in firm control at the Plenum.

aim of the Easter 1972 offensiNe was as much psychological as military. The 
purpose was to break ARVN'S resolve to keep fighting and to induce a 
demoralized Saigon government to negotiate an end to the war on Com-
munist terms, namely. to accept a coalition government dominated by 
Communists. It was the sante fight-to-compel-negotiations strategy Le Duan 
had pursued, with only partial success, in the big offensives of 1968 and 
early 1969. 
When the 1972 offensive lost momentum in September 1972._ Moscow 
and Peking concerned that the war was interfering with their separate 
efforts to develop a detente relationship with the US urged Ilanoi to come 
to terms with the Saigon government. As a result, the collective Politburo 
made political concessions it had been unwilling to consider at the time the 
offensive was first planned a time when the Vietnam war was still politically 
backed by Peking. Le Duan as party leader, must have approved the final 
cease-fire arrangements, but sonic Vietnamese leaders reportedly opposed 
any new concessions. The vacillation in Hanoi between October 1972 and 
January 1973 over signing the agreement suggests that Le Duan had diffi-
culty getting the support of the Politburo for the concessions. 
Hanoi Radio went out of its way immediately after the signing of the 
cease-tire agreement to describe I.c Duan Ill an exceptionally effusive way. 
apparently to scotch any thought that his authority was in jeopardy. In 
reporting on a celebration of Tel 1973 attended by Le Duan, Truong Chinh. 
and others, Hanoi Radio said that those who attended "together with

into two countries would be perpetuated. This prospect was anathema to 
die-hards in the leadership, and Le Duan himself probably was unhappy 
about it. One positive note from his point of view was the opportunity the 
cease-fire gave him to push economic development and modernization in the 
North. This had long been a subject dear to his heart, and Le Duan wasted 
no time announcing plans for postwar development.* A prominent feature 
was a comprehensive plan to reshape the party at all levels, possibly in-
cluding the Central Committee, in a mold of his own choosing. A Politburo 
Resolution?on which Le Duan published a lengthy exegesis?was issued in 
February 1973. It set out guidelines for changing the Party apparatus so that 
it would be better prepared to direct the economic and technical revolution 
that Le Duan envisaged in the "new era" ahead. One basic precept was that 
tired old revolutionaries should be replaced by vigorous managerial and 
technically oriented people. Le Duan had argued before, notably in his 
February 1970 article, that personnel changes were overdue. Numerous 
articles touching on aspects of this theme and quoting one or both of the 
1970 and 1973 Le Duan articles appeared in North Vietnamese media after 
February 1973. 
The North Vietnamese media also bolstered Le Duan's position relative 
to his colleagues by rewriting an early period of party history so as to give 
him, rather than Ho Chi Minh and Truong Chinh, major credit for setting the 
line on "armed struggle" that was followed in the three decades since 1940. 
A series of articles played up the importance of the 6th Plenum of the 
Central Committee, convened in November 1939 near Saigon, and attended 
by Le Duan and a few other leaders (now all dead). The articles, published in 
the autumn of 1972, asserted that the 6th Plenum, rather than the 8th 
Plenum attended by Ho Chi Minh and Truong Chinh in 1941, set the party 
on its wartime course. Hitherto, party histories had invariably treated the 
8th Plenum as the "historic" occasion when the party firmly embarked on 
its revolutionary course. 
The Status of Truong Chinh 
In past years, when Le Duan gained political strength, Truong Chinh 
tended to fade into the background, and vice versa. This pattern has held 
true since August 1970. 
*Progress on this front has been slow, probably because of the persistence of 
uncertainties in the military situation. These uncertainties have strengthened 
VWP elements opposed to making a wholesale shift to a peace-time footing 
until political prospects in the South look better.

Truong Chinh has ceased to be identified with major policies, either 
those actually adopted or those espoused by the regime. His 1968 speech 
his last important contribution to policy has not been mentioned in the 
Hanoi press since August 1970. Chinh did make one long speech in Decem-
ber 1971 at a Vietnam Fatherland Front meeting, but it does not appear to 
have been a major one. Although it was mainly a pep talk designed to rally 
popular and international support for the new phase of the war the Commu-
nists were about to initiate. Truong Chinh made his first capitulation on the 
"Red and expert? issue. acknowledging that the aim of socialism in the 
North was "to achieve the three revolutions of which the technical revolu-
tion is the key." 
An early sign that Truong Climb's position in the power structure was 
insecure was his absence from public view from October 26. 1970 to January 
26, 1971. This was unusual for Truong Chinh: his ceremonial posts require 
him to carry a heavy schedule of public speaking, receiving foreign dele-
gations, and so forth. Truong Chinh may have been abroad for medical 
attention during at least part of his absence: on January 11. 1971, the East 
German radio made a brief and unusual announcement that Chinh was there 
taking a rest cure. In any case, it appears that Truong Chilli' missed the 
crucial 19th Plenum. which is reliably reported to have been held in Decem-
ber 1970. (Hanoi held up announcement of the plenum until February 2, 
1971: such announcements are often not made for a month or more after 
the event.) Another Politburo member who apparently missed the plenum 
was Chinese specialist Hoang Van Man, a long-time associate of Truong 
Chinh. !loan. who was traveling in Europe in the autumn of 1970, did not 
return to Hanoi until December 30. 1970. Whatever the precise facts of their 
whereabouts and the timing of the Plenum. Ifanoi apparently was willing to 
give the impression that the presence of these two Politburo members was 
not necessary at key leadership deliberations. 
Shortly after the Easter 1972 offensive began, Truong Chinh told a 
visiting Scandinavian ambassador that "events have passed me by." This 
remark was interpreted in the diplomatic community to mean that his views 
on the offensive had been ignored. 
Fruong Chinh continued to make frequent routine public appearances 
during the rest of 1972 and 1973. He made one trip abroad, to Moscow in 
December 1972. but the highest ranking official he met was Suslov. an 
influential party secretary but not one of the "troika.? Occasionally Chinh is 
still quoted in the media, but not on really major matters. In general. Truong 
Chinh's activities and speeches show that his post-1970 role has been to serve 
the propaganda purposes of the regime. not to initiate or influence policy.

Le Duan's Strengths 
In the competitive atmosphere that characterizes high-level politics in 
Communist regimes such as North Vietnam, it takes strong and astute men 
to survive at the top. Le Duan, although lacking the oracular authority of Ho 
Chi Minh, seems to have the necessary strength to survive. He has: 
? the mantle of Ho Chi Minh's approval; 
? a long tenure at or near the top; 
? solid qualities of intellect and leadership, which seem to command 
respect and loyalty in the VWP apparatus; 
? an unblemished party record, unlike some of his colleagues; 
? enough proteges and allies in the power structure to give him 
majority support. 
How and when Le Duan earned Ho Chi Minh's esteem is something of a 
mystery. According to party history, the two did not meet until after World 
War II. Even then, for the 12 years that Le Duan was party boss in the South 
their personal contacts were limited to Le Duan's infrequent visits to Ho Chi 
Minh's headquarters in the North. Le Duan must have made a good impres-
sion, for when the first postwar Central Committee was formed in 1951, he 
was given the number-three position, immediately below Secretary General 
Truong Chinh, 
In 1957, Ho Chi Minh, disenchanted with Truong Chinh's disastrous 
handling of land reform and wishing to develop a more aggressive policy 
toward the South, summoned Le Duan north and gave him his first postwar 
job at the national level. It could not have been easy going for Le Duan at 
first. Although listed ahead of the now demoted Truong Chinh in protocol 
appearances, Le Duan was not given a formal title to enhance his status and, 
moreover, had to spend much of his time in the South preparing the 
apparatus for the new war effort. (The new course did not get fully launched 
until 1960.) While Le Duan was diverted to this task, Truong Chinh was able 
to make a strong comeback. In 1958 and 1959, Chinh again became regime 
spokesman on land reform and sharply criticized "rightists" and "revi-
sionists" in the areas of ideology and culture. Chinh apparently retained a 
scat on the Secretariat and was named (over General Giap, for one) senior 
vice premier, a position that automatically made him acting premier when 
Pham Van Dong was out of the country or ailing.

Such signs of preferment ended abruptly for Truong Chinh in Septem-
ber 1960 at a party congress held, IH part, to confirm Le Duan as First 
Secretary. Chinh was dropped from the executive side of government and 
from the Secretariat in a reshuffle that left him chairman of the legislature. a 
prestige job carrying no responsibility. He did, however, retain his number-
three spot on the Politburo. 
Le Duan, now formally chief party executive, gave the major political 
report at the congress, while Truong (Minh gave only a minor report on 
ideology. By conferring the title "First Secretary- on Le Duan, Ho Chi Minh 
showed that he had reached a firm decision to groom Duan to succeed him 
as party leader; in 1960 "First Secretary" was the title held by party bosses 
in most C'ommunist states. In reserving the rarefied position of Party Chair-
man for himself. Ho C'hi Minh was only following Mao Tse-tung's special 
example, and Ilo probably intended to let the position lapse on his death. In 
25X1C fact, a secret provision to 
this ctiect was appended to the 1960 party statutes. 
Although Le Dual) now held the title of First Secretary, he was still 
little known among party officials. Steps, almost certainly approved by Ho 
Chi Minh, were therefore taken to enhance Le Duan's party prestige. His 
works were quoted more than those of any leader except Ifo, and the party 
press gave rave reviews to some of Le Duan's books, a practice not usually 
accorded anyone else except Ho. For example, a book by Le Duan on the 
peasant problem among Chinh's long-time specialty) was praised in the 
January 26, 1965 .Vhan Dan as a "great work'' and an "important contri-
bution to the revolutionary dialectic.- The review took special note of Le 
Duan's leadership qualifications b.v observing that he had participated in the 
"leadership- of the party since its inception, had done extensive work in all 
three regions of Vietnam, and had successfully applied basic Communist 
principles to actual conditions in Vietnam. 
Again, the June 1969 issue of lloc Tap described a book by Le Duan on 
the economy as "a valuable theoretical and practical book on developing the 
socialist economy in North Vietnam.- By asserting that Le Duan's precepts 
are "practical- as well as "theoretical.- the reviewer seemed to be pointing 
up the limitations of Truong (Minh, who is known chic 11 as a theoretician 
and whose famous 1968 speech was praised only for making a "theoretical-
contribution. 
Le Wan acquired more than just the trappings of power in 1960. 110 
Chi Minh allowed him to name his mk..n to key positions and gave him a 
virtually free hand in determining policy toward the South. In personnel 
matters, for example, besides edging Truong Chinh away from center stage,

Le Duan was able to place two colleagues from the South (Pham Hung and 
Le Due Tho) on both the Politburo and the Secretariat. 
Captured documents and prisoner reports make it clear that most of the 
time Le Duan has been the architect of North Vietnam's war policy. At the 
first major COSVN conference held in early 1 966 after the US entered the 
ground war, the VWP representative said he was speaking on behalf of Le 
Duan; the major report presented was a letter written by Le Duan; and the 
COSVN commander expressed satisfaction that, in Hanoi, his conduct of the 
war had the full support of "Comrade Secretary," meaning Le Duan. Ho Chi 
Minh's name came up only in a general propaganda context. 
25X1C reporting on leadership arguments over the war, 
sam tnato urn iviinn tended to equivocate but left everything to Le 
Duan"?probably an accurate statement at that time. 
By the time Ho Chi Minh died in 1969, Le Duan had had years of 
opportunity to use the party's formidable resources for indoctrination?
secret party documents and political lectures as well as public media?to his 
advantage. He was able both to enhance his own stature and also subtly to 
weaken the political standing of potential rivals. The cumulative effect of his 
skillful indoctrination was revealed in interrogations of several politically 
sophisticated prisoners after September 1969. Asked to assess the relative 
standings of top leaders, their consensus was that Le Duan had enough 
control in the VWP to succeed Ho. They said that Truong Chinh was better 
known and commanded respect, but could never regain the prestige lost after 
the land reform failures; General Giap, they said, was just a military man; 
and only Premier Dong had enough political strength to offer competition to 
Le Duan. 
25X1C rundown of Le Duan 's political assets at the time 
25X1C 
"Le Duan is extremely skillful, is trusted by the party and respected 
by the people. Furthermore, he has the reputation of being a close 
follower of Ho. It had been generally understood and accepted among 
the North Vietnamese people that when Ho died, Le Duan would assume 
the leadership role. Le Duan is recognized as being the most "perfect" 
member of the VWP. He is the highest ranking party member to have 
taken direct part in the struggle in South Vietnam, having been active in 
the South against the French." 
Such statements faithfully repeated the theme of indoctrination ma-
terial issued since 1960. Le Duan was considered "perfect" simply because

Approved For ReleasetRibNidiMiltiaddit',91301737A002100040001-4 
political reports that he had made a mistake or incurred Ilo's displeasure 
were never allowed to circulate. By contrast, political officers reportedly 
have freely referred to Tatung Chinh's tendency to be inflexible and too 
pro-Chinese, and both General Giap and Premier Dong came under criticism 
early in the war for counseling caution when Ho Chi Minh (and Le Duan) 
wanted to enlarge the North's war commitment. 
Le Duan's Weaknesses 
Although Le Duan's political assets are formidable, there are some 
liabilities in his position. 
As already noted he has less than a charismatic personality and must 
therefore work harder, and perhaps make more compromises than Ho Chi 
Minh in order to retain control. His basic policies have prevailed in the past 
two years, indicating that he has the majority of the powor structure with 
him, and probablt commands personal loyalty from men like Le Due Tho 
who owe their risc to Le Duan. The evidence also suggests, however, that he 
must contend with a certain amount of stubborn opposition. 
The opposition at present apparently lies mainly on Le Duan's left 
flank, where he seems to be vulnerable as a result of the political concessions 
he made to reach the cease-fire agreement. The evidence tenuously suggests 
that opposition is centered in the army and the southern Communist 
apparatus. 
The result presumably is a divided Politburo, over which Le Duan 
presides with something less than unquestioned authority. 
One would expect a leader with Le Duan's experience to be doing more 
to surround himself with able, loyal subordinates. The top party organiza-
tions?the Politburo and the Central Committee are all of 1960 vintage and 
were largely created by ho Chi Minh. Le Duan's failure to rearrange the 
leadership in a mold more to his liking may be another sign of weakness.

V. Structure of the Present Leadership and the Outlook 
The leadership structure of the VWP has been very stable over the past 
15 years. People have tended to be frozen in jobs because of wartime 
requirements and there has been little upward mobility. 
Most Politburo members are in their mid-60s, well below the age of 
retirement or senility in communist countries and a decade younger than 
their Chinese counterparts. Le Duan was 66 on April 7, 1973. The oldest 
(and least influential) member is the 69-year-old former ambassador to 
China, Hoang Van Hoan. The inner circle of six senior Politburo members 
are all first-generation revolutionaries who rose to prominence in the ICP of 
the 1930s. 
Second-level leaders can be neatly stratified on the basis of when they 
first made their mark on party history. The older group is composed of men 
who came to the fore in the war against the French. They include 25 
generals, men who now hold key command and staff positions. Some 
probably will be transferred to civilian tasks to meet the need for executive 
talent as extensive postwar reconstruction programs get under way. Civilians 
in this category include two members of the Secretariat: Hoang Anh and To 
Huu. Both are candidates for a future Politburo. Anh is the regime's top 
agricultural specialist, and To Huu is responsible for propaganda and educa-
tion and possibly also for science and technology. 
A younger group of men, so-called "new blood," is 'composed mostly of 
economic managers who have risen to key positions since the mid-1950s. 
Prominent men in this list include Nguyen Con, a Secretariat member who 
also apparently serves as executive deputy to Premier Pham Van Dong, who 
is in frail health; Nguyen Lam, Chairman of the State Planning Commission; 
Tran Quang Huy, deputy head of the party's Science and Education Depart-
ment; and Tran Quynh, reportedly Le Duan's personal secretary, who also 
has responsibilities in the area of science and technology. Con and Lam are 
clearly Politburo material. Do Muoi, who was named minister of a reorgan-
ized and enlarged Ministry of Building in June 1973, is an important senior 
economic manager. 
A change in the leadership is long overdue. The list of men who look 
like "corners" is sparse, and the Central Committee?last formed nearly 14 
years ago?is full of deadwood. Less than half the 41 full members of the 
Central Committee appear to meet Le Duan's criteria for men he wants to 
have around him. In March 1973 he wrote that "general leadership" cadres 
should be youthful or at least vigorous, loyal to the top leader (himself), and

competent to manage major economic and technical developmental projects. 
Rumors circulate from time to time in Hanoi that a 4th Party Congress will 
he held to revitalize the leadership and mark the changeover from a war to a 
peace footing. They have not yet been confirmed, but the long-delayed 
congress may be held in the coming year. 
When a 4th Party Congress finally is convened, some diplomats in 
Hanoi expect to see an "explosion- in the leadership ranks. Presumably, Le 
Duan, if still in the saddle, would try to strengthen his position as much as 
politically feasible. The outcome could be less than an "explosion,- how-
ever, for Le Duan has shown considerable prudence in the past when moving 
against political adversaries. Assuming he retained control of VWP, he might 
settle for a few crucial selections of loyal, competent men for the Politburo 
and Secretariat. Le Duan might not even try to purge his old opponent 
"Fruong Chinh, hut agree to a compromise that left Chinh on the Politburo, 
while reserving for himself the right to pick his own number-two man. In this 
case, he would probably choose Le Due Tho, who seems to be Duan's closest 
associate on the Politburo. 
Barring the unexpected, there will continue to be two influential bodies 
of opinion in the 'VP. One, centered in the military and the southern 
apparatus. will argue for the return to a higher level of military activity (a big 
offensive or perhaps guerrilla warfare). The other, the group headed by Le 
Duan and Le Due Tho. though not entirely unsympathetic to the aims of the 
first group. will take a more moderate position. 
Stabilizing factors are also at work. Hanoi media continue to make 
frequent references to a "new era- of "peaceful struggle.- and Le Duan. 
Premier Dong, and some other leaders want very much to get on vi th the job 
of "building socialism- in the North. Le Duan. who has dominated policy 
toward the South under a variety of conditions during the past 28 years, has 
acquiesced before (1955-57 and 1961-621 in a static situation when the 
North seemed to feel it had nothing to gain by intensifying the war. 
Moreover. China and the USSR both want to see the conflict dampened, to 
let the political yeast ferment and count on time being on the Communists' 
side. Their advice has adherents in the Hanoi Politburo, but it is probably 
not decisive. A "political action- strategy is in fact the course being followed 
now. It was adopted after the cease-fire and reaffirmed by the Central 
Committee at its 21st Plenum which was held toward the end of 1973. 
The strategy has forced the Politburo to make difficult compromises. 
I,e Duan has joined with the Politburo in a major effort to maintain a large 
North Vietnamese fighting force in the South. Although the immediate 
mission of this force is defensive, it is large enough with relatively little

reinforcement to allow the Politburo to keep open the option of renewing 
the military offensive. There may be strains in the North Vietnamese 
leadership over just how much more effort should be put into support of the 
South and how much into construction of the North. 
Such strains could get worse if the present strategy fails to produce 
results in the South, and especially if reconstruction in the North lags as 
well. A continued failure to make substantial progress toward both goals 
could make the next few years a period of serious challenge to Le Duan's 
leadership.

FULL MEMBERS 
Hoang Anil Member. Secretariat; Vice-Premier (April 1971); Chair-
man, Central Agricultural Commission (April 1971); Politburo material. 
Held key military administrative posts in the 1950s and economic jobs 
ter 1959. Currently the regime's agricultural specialist. 
Major General Le Quang Ba Chairman, National Minorities Board, a 
ceremonial post. 
A distinguished montagnard who commanded the 316th Division of 
montagnards at Dien Bien Phu. Born 1907. His presence on the central 
committee is probably honorary. 
*Nguyen Luong Bang Vice President of the DRV, a figurehead posi-
tion. 
Born in 1904. a founding member of the ICP, but no recent important 
jobs. A prestigious party elder. 
Duong Quoe Chink Minister of Interior (1971), an unimportant post. 
In the DRV the Interior Ministry has the lowly job of handling social 
welfare. Chink was first noted July 1960 when he was identified as Minister 
of Water Conservancy and Electric Power. His subsequent decline suggests 
that he failed to measure up as an economic manager. 
*TRUONG CHINII Number two on the Politburo; Chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National Assembly and Vice Chairman of the 
Vietnam Fatherland Front. 
See Figure 1, page 24 for details of his career and his rivalry with Le

tNguyen Con?Member, Secretariat; Vice Premier; member, Standing 
Committee of the Council of Ministers (June 1973); and member, National 
Defense Council (June 1971); Politburo material. 
Before June 1973 Nguyen Con was Chairman of the State Planning 
Commission?a Politburo-level responsibility. Several reports have stated that 
he was a rising figure. The first reference to him was a January 1957 report 
saying that he was a member of a land reform committee. His transfer to the 
Council of Ministers in June 1973 may mean that he now directly assists the 
often ailing Premier Dong. 
tMajor General Le Quang Dao?Deputy Director, General Political 
Department (May 1956); commander, Lao war front in 1971. Named alter-
nate member of the 3rd central committee in 1960, he has been regularly 
identified as a full member since March 1973. A prominent and politically 
important general. 
*PHAM VAN DONG?Premier of the DRV since 1955; third ranking 
member of the Politburo; older than Le Duan and in frail health. 
Born 1906, Dong was a member of Ho Chi Minh's "Revolutionary 
Youth" in the 1920s, and studied in Canton under Ho Chi Minh. From 1936 
to 1939, Dong was in Hanoi, along with Truong Chinh and Vo Nguyen Giap 
writing for Front publications. He attended the 8th Plenum in 1941 but, 
curiously, was not named to the Central Committee until 1949. 
He demonstrated skill as a negotiator in dealing with the French in 
1946 and 1954. Reportedly held dovish views early in the 1960s, but gave 
wholehearted support to the war after 1965. He has ably negotiated with 
Peking and Moscow for support. He appears to be in good standing with Le 
Duan. 
Vo Thuc Dong?Ambassador to USSR (January 1972); one of the least 
prominent Central Committee members. 
Was Party Secretary of Nghe An Province before 1972 and has held 
other regional posts. Dong is higher ranking than his predecessor, an alter-
nate member, and the DRV Ambassador to Peking, also an alternate Central 
Committee member. Dong's assignment nicely reflects Hanoi's desire to 
show some warming (but not too much) in relations with Moscow vis-a-vis 
Peking. 
t *LE DUAN?VWP First Secretary; member, National Defense Coun-
cil (June 1971), his only government position.

See Figure 1, page 24 for a sketch of Fe Duan's career. 
+Tran Huu Duc Minister at the Premier's Office (April 1965); member, 
National Defense Council (June 1971); a senior economic manager. 
Born 1904, but still active and vigorous. Began his revolutionary career 
in 1929. Has held many planning and economic jobs since 1954, and is 
obviously held in high regard by Premier Dong and Le Duan. 
Colonel General VAN TIEN DUNG Army Chief of Staff since 1954; 
close to Le Dunn; younger and less prestigious than Giap, but political 
standing may be higher. 
Dung fought with the Viet Minh in World War 11 and commanded the 
320th Division after 1950. Though not at Dien Bien Phu, he apparently 
impressed Ho Chi Minh, for in 1954 Dung was named Chief of Staff. lie then 
went South to serve under Le DUall for two years. According to interroga-
tion reports, Ilo Chi Minh, in his last years, praised Dung for being more 
aggressive than Giap. According to a captured Nhan Dan reporter. Dung 
publishes under the pseudonym Chien Thang, author of important, pre-
dictably hawkish statements on military policy in 1972 and 1973. The 
youngest member of the Politburo (born 1917). Dung may be slated to 
replace Giap, who has been inexplicably absent from public view much of 
the time in the past year. 
*Ha Huy Giap Vice Minister of Culture (January 1963). 
A veteran Communist whose career goes back to the 1930s. Giap writes 
theoretical articles, often travels as a representative of the VWP. He does not 
seem to carry much political weight though. He was reported to have come 
under criticism in 1967 for opposing the war. 
*Senior General VO NGUYEN GIAP Minister of Defense, victorious 
commander at Dien Bien Phu. and author of "People's Army. People's War." 
Giap is probably the VWP leader best known outside Vietnam. He has been 
commander in chief of the VPA since its formation on December 22. 1944. 
Giap probably devised the military strategy used in the big offensives of 
1968-69 and 1972. 
Giap has quarreled with other Politburo members. His record of rivalry 
with Truong Ching goes back to 1950. According to interrogation reports, 
Giap, in opposition to both Hu Chi Minh and Le Dunn, was against sending

NVA troops south in 1964. Although Giap is the fifth-ranking member of 
the Politburo, his name was sixth on the list of those attending Ho Chi 
Minh's funeral, Le Duc Tho (normally number six) having been placed ahead 
of Giap. The downgrading of Giap's Politburo standing at that important 
ceremony is consistent with recurrent reports that Giap, though respected 
for his generalship, has little say in Politburo decisions. Illness probably 
accounts for his periods of absence from public view?especially prolonged in 
the past year?but he could be in political trouble. 
t Lieutenant General Song Hao ?Director, VPA General Political 
Department (March 1961), making him the army's top political commissar; 
Deputy Secretary, Party Military Affairs Committee; Vice Minister of Na-
tional Defense (March 1961). 
Song Hao got his job of Director, GPD, after a struggle for power in 
1960-61 between Senior General Giap and the then GPD head, Senior 
General Nguyen Chi Thanh. The major public issue was army professionalism 
vs. party primacy. Giap won that round, Thanh was retired to rural work, 
and the rank of GPD chief was reduced two steps, from Senior to Lieutenant 
General. 
Song Hao's subsequent career has been uneventful, suggesting that he is 
a career officer accepted by and responsive to the professionals who dom-
inate the VPA today. 
*HOANG VAN HOAN ?Chinese specialist, and probably the least in-
fluential member of the Politburo; Vice Chairman of filo National Assembly 
Standing Committee, a prestige position. 
Born 1905, Hoan had an illustrious early party career, culminating in 
the 1950s with appointments to the Politburo, the military high command, 
and concurrently Ambassador to China (1950-57). Apparently a casualty of 
Ho Chi Minh's 1957 decision to become more independent of China, Hoan 
has since then never been given a really important assignment, although he 
was retained on the 1960 Politburo as its most junior member. He now 
spends much of each year visiting other Communist countries, but is not 
known to be entrusted with important negotiating missions; he may, how-
ever, play a useful liasion role with the Chinese. 
*TRAN QUOC HOAN ?Minister of Public Security since 1953. 
Tran Quoc Hoan was probably born about 1910. His long tenure as 
Minister of Public Security has given him an opportunity he undoubtedly has 
used to build an independent power base.

In addition to running the large, conventional police apparatus in North 
Vietnam, as Minister of Public Security (MPS) he directs the People's Armed 
Security Forces. the DRV militia organization. Trim Quoc Howl's public 
appearances and speeches give the impression that he is a powerful member 
of the Politburo. Although Le Duan probably would prefer to have his own 
man in the MPS post. there have been no reports of friction between the two 
men. A hint that Le Duan intends to tighten control over the management of 
the MPS appeared in Politburo Resolution 225 of February 1973. The 
resolution entrusted the Organization Department (headed by Le Due Tho) 
with the broad task of selecting party cadres and singled out cadres directing 
security work for special attention, saying that they "must necessarily be 
selected with care.?

Pham Ilung, who was born 1912 in Vinh Long Province, is the only 
southerner in the Politburo. Ilis career through the mid-1950s paralleled 
those of Le Duan and Le Due Tho. All three were in jail during World War II, 
and remained South after the war and after the DRV was established in 
1954. After Lc Duan returned North in 1957. Pham Hung's rise was rapid. 
Ile was named to the Politburo in 1957, and was given a series of agricultural 
and economic assignments. Ile became senior Vice Premier in 1960, served as 
Acting Premier in Premier Dong's absence, and apparently was being 
groomed to succeed him. At the end of 1967. however, it became necessary 
to send him South to replace the recently deceased COSVN chief, General 
Nguyen Chi Thanh. 
After that. Pham Hung dropped from public view. 
25X1C report has confirmed that he remained Secretary of COSVN 
through 19 13. The last reported statement he made was in 1969, when he 
endorsed COSVN Resolution 9 justifying the retreat from the big offensive 
strategy. His apparent recent silence is puzzling, inasmuch as one would 
expect the Communists to use the authority of Pham Ilung's name (he is 
number four on the Politburo) to add weight to political indoctrination 
material. Instead, all reported speeches exhorting cadres in the South to 
implement cease-fire policies have come from other leaders of COSVN or 
from representatives of the VWP sent from Ilanoi. The absence of statements 
from Phalli Ilung raises the possibility that he does not fully support the 
"political action" line COSVN has been ordered to take.

To Huu, who was born in 1920, joined the ICP in the 1930s and made a 
name for himself as a poet and propagandist. He toured South Vietnam in 
the spring of 1973, explaining the VWP party line on the Paris agreement 
(only "political action" was authorized except in self-defense) and reassuring 
cadres on Le Duan's policy on retiring old cadres (don't worry about it; the 
policy will be gently applied in the South). 
*Nguyen Khang?No known positions. Apparently retired. 
A veteran Communist, Khang is one of several Central Committee 
members who, after a promising start, have lost stature for no readily 
apparent reason. 
Khang held key posts with the Viet Minh, was Ambassador to China 
from April 1957 to April 1959, and then held fairly important posts in the 
Office of the Premier from 1960 to 1965. Khang is the only known Catholic 
in the Central Committee. 
Ung Van Khiem?Rethed, in political disfavor. 
Khiem is an old revolutionary who became a casualty of the "anti-
revisionist" witch-hunts of the mid-1960s. For eight years after 1946 he 
commanded Viet Minh forces in the South. On his return North, he rose to 
become the VWP's leading foreign affairs specialist. In 1961-63, the peak of 
his career, he was concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs and chairman of 
the VWP Foreign Affairs Department. Then, according to several reports, he 
came under attack for being a leading member of a "pro-Soviet" group of 
revisionists. He was reassigned in April 1963 to the Ministry of Interior, 
where his responsibilities consisted of dispensing social welfare. He lost that 
job in June 1971, and as far as is known now holds no position. 
*Nguyen Van Kinh?Retired and under a political cloud, though still 
President of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association. 
Under the pseudonym of Thuong Vu, Kinh served in South Vietnam 
from 1951 to 1957. Then he was named Ambassador to Moscow, probably 
with instructions to argue that Hanoi was determined to use violence if 
necessary to take over the South. At some point, however, Kinh may have 
been persuaded by persistent Soviet arguments to play down violence, 
because in February 1967 he was recalled and retired from active party and 
25X1C government work. has reported that in 1967 Kinh 
was accused of being revisionist an 'pro-Soviet."

mistakes during the 1956 land reform. 
An old revolutionary. Le Van Luong was removed in disgrace from the 
Politburo and government positions in the fall of 1956. Although kept on 
the Secretariat, he has had no specific job assignment since then. 
+Major General Tran Luong?A deputy commander at COSVN. 
Tran Luong was one of the first commanders of COSVN, which was 
formed in 1961. and stayed on as deputy when higher ranking generals came 
South to direct the enlarging war.

included the Western highlands. In 1966 he was named both Commander 
and Political Officer of the just-created B-3 Front, positions he held until

A founding member of the ICP, Le Thanh Nghi worked with the Viet 
Minh in the North during the war against the French. Has held several 
economic and industrial positions since 1956. He is also one of the Polit-
buro's principal aid negotiators with Peking and Moscow. He published a 
long article in Nhan Dan in June 1973, which followed the Le Duan line on 
rational handling of management problems and reliance on "economic 
levers." 
tMajor General Tran Van Quang?Vice Minister of National Defense; 
Deputy Chief of Staff; and member, Military Affairs Committee of the VWP 
Central Committee. Identified for the first time as a member of the Central 
Committee in the newspaper Hanoi Moi on January 26, 1974. He may have 
been an alternate member of the 1960 Central Committee and have been 
recently promoted to full membership to fill one of the three vacancies 
created by deaths since 1960. 
Major General Quang was the first commander of COSVN, when it was 
established in 1961. In the late 1960s he served as commander of DRV 
Military Region 4 (southern North Vietnam). 
Mrs. Ha Thi Que?Vice President, Vietnam Women's Union.

*Bui Quang Tao?Has held economic posts, but current position un-

Tao was Minister of Construction from 1958 until June 1973 when he 
was reassigned to "other duties." These have not yet been specified, though 
he continues to make occasional public appearances, identified only as a 
member of the Central Committee. The failure to give him a title commensu-
rate with his party rank suggests that his political importance has declined.

1963-67, and was reassigned to command forces under COSVN in 1967. 
Thai, like his patron General Chip. was an enthusiastic supporter of the big 
offensives strategy in 1968-69, and presumably also in 1972. Born in 1906. 
he is probably the oldest general on active duty. 
+Le Quoc Thanh Chief of Hanoi police since 1955 and Vice Minister 
of Public Security since 1958. Other than that he is the senior Vice Minister, 
putting him in line to succeed Tran Quoc Hoan. little is known about Le 
Quoc Thanh. 
*Ton Duc Thang President of the DRV, a figurehead position. 
Born 1888, Thang is the hero of the legendary Black Sea incident. (In 
1919 he took part in a Communist-inspired mutiny on a French vessel). That 
is his chief claim to fame. 
*Mrs. Nguyen Thi Thap Chairman. Vietnam Women's Union. 
*LE DUC THO Member, Secretariat: Director, Organization Depart-
ment of the Central Committee: the DRV's chief negotiator at Paris since 
1968. Although ranked sixth on the Politburo. Tho appears to be Le Duan's 
closest associate. 
A founding member of the ICP, Le Due Tho was named to the Central 
Committee in 1945. and has since been something of a protege of Le Duan. 
Tho served as Le Duan's deputy in the South in the 1950s. In 1960. Tho was 
named to the Secretariat under Le Duan, and given the crucial post of chief 
of the VWP Organization Department. At the 3rd Party Congress, Le Duc 
"Iho gave the second most important speech. on party organization. (Le 
Duan gave the principal report). 
About that time, a rumor began circulating of frictions between Le 
Duan and Le Duc Tho, an allegation that has often been repeated by Western 
observers of the North Vietnamese political scene. The story originated in 
the emigre community in France, and has never been substantiated by 
evidence from Vietnam. 
In February 1973 the Politburo issued a resolution spelling out criteria 
for selecting cadres and reorganizing the government and party in the "new 
era" of postwar construction. Le Duc Tho's Organization Department was 
assigned the task of implementing the resolution, and Le Duan published a 
lengthy report endorsing the resolution. 
At the Paris talks, Le Duc Tho has demonstrated considerable skill and 
diplomacy. The talks have made him one of the best known Vietnamese 
leaders outside Vietnam.

*Xuan Thuy ?Chief of the DRV Delegation to the Paris peace talks, 
since they began in May 1968. Member, Secretariat, and head of the Central 
Committee's Foreign Relations department. He is evidently held in high 
regard by the Politburo as an international expert. Thuy's chief problem is 
chronic ill health. 
Born in 1912 and an ICP veteran. Before 1968 his specialty was 
maintaining liaison with international Communist organizations. He was 
Foreign Minister from 1963 to 1965, but resigned for health reasons. He was 
often too ill in Paris to attend meetings. 
t *Nguyen Van Tran ?Member, Secretariat; Secretary of the Hanoi 
Party Committee since 1968, and publicly very active in this role. Politburo 
material. 
Tran used to hold key military industrial jobs. He was Minister of 
Heavy Industry, 1960 to 1967, and concurrently on the Military Affairs 
Commission and the National Defense Council. He dropped all these posts 
when he took the equally important post of Hanoi Secretary. Born in 1916, 
he is one of the younger members of the power structure. 
*NGUYEN DUY TRINH?Vice Premier since 1960 and DRV Foreign 
Minister since 1965, but does not seem to carry much weight. Really 
important negotiations are handled by others on the Politburo. 
A founding member of the ICP, Trinh was the regime's leading eco-
nomic specialist in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but his career appears to 
have peaked then. In 1957 he was the regime's leading land reform specialist 
and was named to the Politburo the same year. He was named head of the 
State Planning Commission the following year and led major trade delega-
tions abroad. In 1963, in addition to his other duties, he became chairman of 
the State Scientific and Technological Commission. All these jobs were 
dropped in 1965 when he became Foreign Minister, a job that in itself carries 
relatively little responsibility in the DRV. In the absence of evidence that he 
has ever been in political trouble, his decline may simply reflect dissatisfac-
tion of the Politburo with his work. 
t Major General Phan Trong Tue ?Minister of Communications and 
Transport (1960), a key post in Vietnam. Still fairly young (born 1917), Tue 
was in the ICP, served under Le Duan as a commander in the South 1945-54,

An official in the Ministry of Labor from 1955 to 1959, Chan was 
promoted to the job of First Secretary of the Hanoi Party Committee in 
1960, when he was elected alternate member of the Central Committee. In 
1962 he was demoted to a provincial post. which he held until his March 
1967 assignment to Moscow. He was the first DRV ambassador to Moscow 
who was not a full member of the Central Committee; his assignment 
evidently was intended to show displeasure with Moscow -for refusing to

especially angry at Peking in April 1967 (in May 1967 MC' Tap published a 
polemical attack on Mao Tse-tung's leadership style), and probably selected 
Loan to go to Peking because he was only a minor party official.

Ngo Thuyen?Ambassador to China since January 1970. 
In rural work 1954-56, when many party officials were tainted by 
errors committed during land reform. Then assigned to Thanh Hoa Province, 
perhaps a mild form of exile, where he stayed until going to Peking. If he is 
actually under a political cloud in Hanoi, as his background suggests, this

*Nguyen Khanh Toan?Vice Minister of Education (January 1963). 
Educated in the USSR, a professor and linguist, and the architect of the 
DRV educational system, loan is one of the VWP's best known intellectuals. 
His political importance, once considerable, has declined in recent years, as is 
evident from his drop in Central Committee rank from full to alternate 
member in 1960. Since he is 71 years old, it is not likely that he will make a 
comeback. 
t Lieutenant General Tran Van Tra?Commander or 1st Deputy Com-
mander, COSVN, since about 1963; achieved international prominence in 
February-March 1973 as PRG representative to the Four Party Joint Military 
Commission in Saigon. 
Tra joined the ICP in 1940, held several command positions in the 
South under Le Duan from 1946 to 1954, and then reportedly went to the 
USSR and China for further military training. 
Was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1962, just before receiving his 
assignment to command COSVN. When the war expanded and more senior 
generals were sent South, Tra stayed on as 1st Deputy Commander. 
During 1973, Hanoi Radio treated Tra as a hero and chief military 
spokesman for the South, suggesting he was being groomed to replace his 
superior, the 68-year-old COSVN Commander Lieutenant General Hoan Van 
Thai. Tra is 56, and clearly slated for larger responsibilities.

most of his career. lie served under Le Duan in the South from 1946 to 
1954, and in 1960 became head of the two Reunification Commissions, 
created to help direct the insurgency in the South. Captured documents
